All these gaming companies, no clear winner.\\n00:52:05.910 - 00:52:50.500, Speaker A: We start a season portfolio company kind of tells us where are people building? It seems like a pretty evenly footed race at the moment between Polygon, Solana, Immutable, X, and I would say those are kind of the four. The ones that we don't see are like the app chains. Game developers are just trying to figure out how to build stuff on chain. You talk to them about having their own token, running their own ballot, they're like, no, absolutely not. And so do we think that they're going to want their app chains eventually? Probably the biggest ones. I would also say things like board Ape Yacht Club and how big and how impressive they are. They weren't even able to do this, so it's harder than you think.\\n00:52:50.500 - 00:53:04.520, Speaker A: But yeah, it seems like kind of they're all fighting it out. Avalanche as well, is another one. Kind of the ones with the best BD are the ones that seem to be kind of like winning. I don't know if any of them are the long term gaming, though.\\n00:53:04.890 - 00:53:10.266, Speaker C: Yeah, it's possible. We still haven't seen that long term gaming winner I would say probable that.\\n00:53:10.288 - 00:53:11.034, Speaker A: We haven't seen that.\\n00:53:11.072 - 00:53:12.780, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fair.\\n00:53:13.950 - 00:53:16.060, Speaker B: Vance, how's the Adam 2.0 research?\\n00:53:16.510 - 00:53:17.580, Speaker A: It's good.\\n00:53:18.910 - 00:53:20.406, Speaker B: You talked to our analysts yet?\\n00:53:20.528 - 00:53:57.970, Speaker A: Didn't talk to the analysts. Did all the research myself, not some boomer who gets somebody else. Read the white paper for me. I think it's super interesting. I think I came away from my Cosmos research like super bullish on Tendermint, less bullish on Adam. Effectively. What the value prop for Adam is, is that, number one, there's this concept of shared security or being able to rent security from kind of like Atom stakers.\\n00:53:57.970 - 00:54:39.586, Speaker A: And if you're trying to bootstrap your own chain, just renting security from Adam is like a pretty easy way to start. I think that's interesting. You have to pay for the security with your own native token, which kind of makes it seem a little bit akin to polkadot in many ways, where you have to rent a parachain slot.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Private Order Flow is the new MEV\\nchannel_name: Bell Curve\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9FmmsW9cHY\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-07\\n\\n01:09:26.968 - 01:09:29.060, Speaker B: Taking vacation, but good message.\\n01:09:30.710 - 01:09:36.150, Speaker C: Yesterday we were joking.

We offer the ability to filter based on different skills, we offer civil protection so you know that every user you get is actually a unique human and can be a strong partner in helping Aave strengthen their community moving forward. As I mentioned, we're really pleased with the excitement from our Rabbit Hole community about the Ave quest we did a few weeks ago and look forward to more and more hopefully successful ventures down the line.\\n01:05:55.270 - 01:05:56.018, Speaker D: Awesome.\\n01:05:56.184 - 01:06:03.990, Speaker A: Thank you so much for that awesome intro, Ben. And just so people know how to get in touch with you, what is the best way to learn more?\\n01:06:04.140 - 01:06:35.950, Speaker G: Yeah, if you'd like to reach out to me personally at Ben Schechter on Twitter. But for Rabbit Hole, you can go to Rabbit Hole GG and complete our quest, credential yourself through our skills. If you've done different actions on chain, we provide credentials for that which can then be used to unlock new opportunities, unlock new quests in the future, and to dive further into being a Web Three user and citizen.\\n01:06:36.610 - 01:06:39.246, Speaker A: Amazing.

What the value prop for Adam is, is that, number one, there's this concept of shared security or being able to rent security from kind of like Atom stakers.\\n00:53:57.970 - 00:54:39.586, Speaker A: And if you're trying to bootstrap your own chain, just renting security from Adam is like a pretty easy way to start. I think that's interesting. You have to pay for the security with your own native token, which kind of makes it seem a little bit akin to polkadot in many ways, where you have to rent a parachain slot.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Private Order Flow is the new MEV\\nchannel_name: Bell Curve\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9FmmsW9cHY\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-07\\n\\n01:09:26.968 - 01:09:29.060, Speaker B: Taking vacation, but good message.\\n01:09:30.710 - 01:09:36.150, Speaker C: Yesterday we were joking.

And you can read more about that on our docs or L2 beat. But we don't want to mislead by emphasizing one thing and not another.\\n00:11:38.282 - 00:12:15.400, Speaker A: So those other things contract upgradability the power, validators have, those are the things that you if you want to spam our discord about something, those are the more important things. Don't spam our discord, you know what I mean? Okay, important follow up. Obviously, having a centralized sequencer is not ideal. Looking at the time, I'm going to try to speed up a little. What can a centralized sequencer do that's bad? Well, even if it's honest, honest mistakes happen, right? So even an honest sequencer could have downtime because of infrastructure failures and server issues. And that's bad because it sort of slows the whole system down. It's very inconvenient going to skip over one thing in there.\\n00:12:15.400 - 00:12:44.622, Speaker A: The juicier stuff is what if the sequencer is actually malicious? It just turns evil. What can it do? Well, it can equivocate. In other words, it can make one of these promises and then not make good on it later. It can make inconsistent promises to different users, right? These fast transactions are trusted. It can violate that trust. It can't censor you technically, but it can temporarily censor you, right? So if it stops processing your transaction, you'll be able to get it through eventually. And we like emphasizing that fact, but the also important fact is there is a short window of time that you'll have to just wait.\\n00:12:44.622 - 00:13:08.438, Speaker A: And that also could suck, right? Being unable to transact for some number of hours might be a real problem. The sequencer can do that to you. And then finally, the kind of elephant in the room here is mev. Mev. Okay? So all I want to say here, there's plenty of other talks about mev, people who have more and more interesting things to say about mev than I do. I'm not an expert. I don't even know what the M stands for.\\n00:13:08.438 - 00:13:55.078, Speaker A: It's unclear. At this point it was minor, now it's maximum. I learned when I was procrastinating this, this is called an orphaned initialism if it stops meaning anything tangent. But when we talk about mev, we're talking about the power you get when you have the power of ordering transactions, particularly the power to order them in such a way that benefits you, the orderer to extract value from them. And what I would say is this whole architecture of introducing a sequencer has this side effect that the sequencer has control over transaction ordering, which means if it's economically interested, it might use this to extract value. Whether this is a bad thing we need to fix or an opportunity to take advantage of is sort of a philosophical debate.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nBut when we introduce a sequencer, the sort of lifecycle of a transaction looks something like this. In the sort of normal state of affairs, the user kind of gives their transaction off to the sequencer. The sequencer immediately gives this promise, totally trusted, that says, I will impute your transaction later. At some point later, in the case of Arbitrum, usually every few minutes, it'll post a batch of transactions on chain. And at that point, the sequencer is kind of out of the picture.\\n00:07:27.094 - 00:07:53.522, Speaker A: Once it's on chain, we're in full roll up mode, full trusted mode. It's committed to this particular ordering. And as far as a user is concerned, your transaction is as finalized as a layer one transaction, right? Because all of the data is available there. Anybody can execute it. Anybody can see what the final state will be. The actual explicit claim or commitment to what that final state actually is happens later, and the sequencer is not involved. And that's that third step there.\\n00:07:53.522 - 00:08:33.354, Speaker A: The validator asserts the state, but there's no rush to do that. That's really just so that we can communicate back to layer one and process withdrawals, but from the layer, if you're just interacting on layer two, once your data is on Chain, you're done. So that gives us this way that we can get this nice fast, low latency fast transaction path thrusted if you want to. But it's optional and that's very important. So just to drill that point home, because you should be suspicious when I start saying it's optional. What does it mean that using the sequencer is optional? Well, in the sort of normal case, the system's working well, if the sequencer gives you this fast promise, you can just ignore it and say, screw you, I don't care what you say, I'm going to wait for you to post on chain. So it takes another few minutes and then you get the full sort of trustless finality.\\n00:08:33.354 - 00:09:16.122, Speaker A: In the unhappy case where the sequencer just goes rogue and isn't even answering anything, there is still a way that you can do anything you want on Arbitrum. There's this sort of alternative path, basically. Long story short, it's a lot slower. I think Patrick talked about this, well, I'm going to stop talking about him, but it's on my mind. But yeah, the point is, the system can work in a sort of slower way, in a slightly more inconvenient way. It can work without the sequencer entirely, so it's entirely optional and that's why we can still call this thing a layer two and sleep at night. So I've just been talking about the sequencer like it's my friend or something, but what actually is it? And basically we just define the sequencer as this entity that can give these fast promises.\\n00:09:16.122 - 00:10:03.770, Speaker A: That has all the properties that I had. But you might ask, how does it decide which transactions to include, who controls it, in what order these transactions go and so on.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nThey do this distributed key generation. So you encrypt your transactions, give it to the sequencer, the sequencer commits to an ordering blindly. It doesn't know the contents of the transactions, commits to it off chain. Right? And then only after it commits to them do we sort of reveal the contents of it. So now the sequencer can't easily extract value because it doesn't know what it's looking at.\\n00:16:12.818 - 00:16:41.654, Speaker A: So this is cool. And there's some added levels, some potential concerns. Let's say the parties that are in charge of this distributed key generation. The idea is you distribute it so that they can't easily collude. But if they do collude, they could, for example, reveal the contents of the transactions to the sequencer before you want to. Also, if they sort of don't reveal keys in time, things like that, there's certain ways that they can delay things further. And remember, this was kind of all about improving latency.\\n00:16:41.654 - 00:17:09.560, Speaker A: So we do want to take latency concerns seriously. Even in the sort of normal case, when you're doing this threshold encryption stuff, there's rounds of communication that are required, so it's inevitably going to add some latency. So that's one concern in our eyes. But, yeah, cool stuff. So, I mean, these two techniques so far, again, you could apply these to a centralized sequencer. We haven't really talked about decentralizing, it just limiting its power. Now, let's get to some ideas for more properly decentralizing it.\\n00:17:09.560 - 00:17:49.138, Speaker A: So one design space, let's say, is that of mev auctions, as it's known, proposed by some of the folks at Optimism, along with a few others some years ago. I'm going to describe it sort of in the abstract. I'm not claiming this is their plan or anything like that, just sort of talking about the design space. So the idea here is you can imagine at any given time we can point to who the sequencer is. It's still one specific party, even a centralized party, but every so often over time, we hold an auction and you can buy the right to become the sequencer. Okay? In that sense, it becomes, in the big picture, permissionless. Now, why would you want to be a sequencer? Seems like a thankless job.\\n00:17:49.138 - 00:18:36.900, Speaker A: The answer is, by being a sequencer, you have the power and the ability to profit by extracting mev. So this design kind of leans into the mev thing and kind of says, yeah, let's take advantage of this and use mev as a revenue source. Again, that's sort of a philosophical distinction or an ideological one even in terms of how we want to handle it. I think important in the mental model for these is that these auctions kind of have to be infrequent. It's not as though these potential sequencers are sitting, looking at transactions, seeing ways to extract value from particular transactions and then bidding on the rights to order them. It's more like they're bidding on their future potential for ordering.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Julien Niset Why account abstraction on L2 is critical for mass adoption\\nchannel_name: [EthCC] Livestream 6\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDrT3s9PrY\\nrelease_date: 2022-07-20\\n\\nAll these become possible because with account abstraction, every account is a smart contract. And what I think is very exciting is that there's actually two leading layer two solution starquare with StarkNet and Mata Labs with ZK Sync that have decided to launch with native account abstraction.\\n00:08:35.518 - 00:09:17.082, Speaker A: So we actually have very soon in production two systems that are both ZK rollup so that can scale and that enable native account abstraction, which means that we can also scale the user experience. And of course, that's why at Argent we've been very excited about these two projects and that's why we've started building on them. So, of course, if every account is a smart contract. That's fantastic. But it cannot be any smart contract. Of course, there needs to be some certain interface that the operating system, the EVM, the Kros, whatever, understand to interact with accounts. And so we've been working with OpenZeppelin and Starquare on defining that interface in StarkNet.\\n00:09:17.082 - 00:10:01.482, Speaker A: So I will illustrate the rest of this talk with StarkNet. But of course, a lot of it applied to ZkSync. And so we came up with the following interface that every account needs to satisfy. So having a quick look again, PDF are not a great idea. But anyway, there's two important method on the interface of your account is a method to validate and a method to execute transaction. The goal of the validate method is actually it's a way for the operating system dos or the sequencer to quickly validate that a transaction will be valid and that it will be paid on ethereum. This is typically done by DVM, by just checking the signature, checking the nons and making sure that you have enough ease to pay the minor fee.\\n00:10:01.482 - 00:10:31.830, Speaker A: And that's why you typically pay 21,000 gas for that validation execution. And so with account abstraction, you can actually program the rules of that validation. And once the transaction is validated, there's a second method to execute. So typically when you submit a transaction, the Kos in this case will call validate and then we'll call execute. So these are the two central method of an account. There's a third one which I believe is very important. It's a way to verify offchain signatures.\\n00:10:31.830 - 00:11:02.174, Speaker A: If your account defines the logic of what a valid transaction is or what a valid signature is. Of course, if you sign an off chain message, like an EIP 712 for example, you cannot verify the validity of that signature locally using, say, EC recover. If you build a DAP, the only person or the only object that knows if the signature is valid is the account itself. And so you need a way to contact the account. And that's why we build a method called doing is valid signature. For those who know it. It's exactly? EIP 1271 in ethereum.\\n00:11:02.174 - 00:11:40.366, Speaker A: So this has been designed for smart contract wallet, but on StarkNet it will be really at the interface of every single account.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nI think important in the mental model for these is that these auctions kind of have to be infrequent. It's not as though these potential sequencers are sitting, looking at transactions, seeing ways to extract value from particular transactions and then bidding on the rights to order them. It's more like they're bidding on their future potential for ordering. They're taking a bet on their own mev powers in the future.\\n00:18:36.900 - 00:19:23.390, Speaker A: They can't really be frequent for a few reasons. These auctions, you can't have frequent sequencer turnover. The main reason being that we sort of at any given point have to know who the sequencer is so that it can give these fast transactions, right? Otherwise, again, it sort of defeats the whole purpose. So imagine on the order of maybe hours, maybe days, I don't know, we hold these auctions. So I'll talk about why myself, I'll just speak for myself. But generally us at off chain labs are sort of resistant to this design space because it depends on the ability to order transactions and extract mev. This is sort of inherently at ODS with the other thing that we want Sequencers to do, which is give low latency simply because you need some time to figure out the optimal order of transactions to extract value from them.\\n00:19:23.390 - 00:20:00.038, Speaker A: So there's some tension there in practice. Maybe that won't matter, maybe they only need a few extra seconds. But it's not nothing, right? And again, the way I kind of see it, latency is the name of the game with sequencers. That's one thing because these auctions sort\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nSo even if we said, hey, we decentralize the sequencer, if we didn't take care of those other things, it sort of doesn't really give you anything. And you can read more about that on our docs or L2 beat. But we don't want to mislead by emphasizing one thing and not another.\\n00:11:38.282 - 00:12:15.400, Speaker A: So those other things contract upgradability the power, validators have, those are the things that you if you want to spam our discord about something, those are the more important things. Don't spam our discord, you know what I mean? Okay, important follow up. Obviously, having a centralized sequencer is not ideal. Looking at the time, I'm going to try to speed up a little. What can a centralized sequencer do that's bad? Well, even if it's honest, honest mistakes happen, right? So even an honest sequencer could have downtime because of infrastructure failures and server issues. And that's bad because it sort of slows the whole system down. It's very inconvenient going to skip over one thing in there.\\n00:12:15.400 - 00:12:44.622, Speaker A: The juicier stuff is what if the sequencer is actually malicious? It just turns evil. What can it do? Well, it can equivocate. In other words, it can make one of these promises and then not make good on it later. It can make inconsistent promises to different users, right? These fast transactions are trusted. It can violate that trust. It can't censor you technically, but it can temporarily censor you, right? So if it stops processing your transaction, you'll be able to get it through eventually. And we like emphasizing that fact, but the also important fact is there is a short window of time that you'll have to just wait.\\n00:12:44.622 - 00:13:08.438, Speaker A: And that also could suck, right? Being unable to transact for some number of hours might be a real problem. The sequencer can do that to you. And then finally, the kind of elephant in the room here is mev. Mev. Okay? So all I want to say here, there's plenty of other talks about mev, people who have more and more interesting things to say about mev than I do. I'm not an expert. I don't even know what the M stands for.\\n00:13:08.438 - 00:13:55.078, Speaker A: It's unclear. At this point it was minor, now it's maximum. I learned when I was procrastinating this, this is called an orphaned initialism if it stops meaning anything tangent. But when we talk about mev, we're talking about the power you get when you have the power of ordering transactions, particularly the power to order them in such a way that benefits you, the orderer to extract value from them. And what I would say is this whole architecture of introducing a sequencer has this side effect that the sequencer has control over transaction ordering, which means if it's economically interested, it might use this to extract value. Whether this is a bad thing we need to fix or an opportunity to take advantage of is sort of a philosophical debate.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nBut when we introduce a sequencer, the sort of lifecycle of a transaction looks something like this. In the sort of normal state of affairs, the user kind of gives their transaction off to the sequencer. The sequencer immediately gives this promise, totally trusted, that says, I will impute your transaction later. At some point later, in the case of Arbitrum, usually every few minutes, it'll post a batch of transactions on chain. And at that point, the sequencer is kind of out of the picture.\\n00:07:27.094 - 00:07:53.522, Speaker A: Once it's on chain, we're in full roll up mode, full trusted mode. It's committed to this particular ordering. And as far as a user is concerned, your transaction is as finalized as a layer one transaction, right? Because all of the data is available there. Anybody can execute it. Anybody can see what the final state will be. The actual explicit claim or commitment to what that final state actually is happens later, and the sequencer is not involved. And that's that third step there.\\n00:07:53.522 - 00:08:33.354, Speaker A: The validator asserts the state, but there's no rush to do that. That's really just so that we can communicate back to layer one and process withdrawals, but from the layer, if you're just interacting on layer two, once your data is on Chain, you're done. So that gives us this way that we can get this nice fast, low latency fast transaction path thrusted if you want to. But it's optional and that's very important. So just to drill that point home, because you should be suspicious when I start saying it's optional. What does it mean that using the sequencer is optional? Well, in the sort of normal case, the system's working well, if the sequencer gives you this fast promise, you can just ignore it and say, screw you, I don't care what you say, I'm going to wait for you to post on chain. So it takes another few minutes and then you get the full sort of trustless finality.\\n00:08:33.354 - 00:09:16.122, Speaker A: In the unhappy case where the sequencer just goes rogue and isn't even answering anything, there is still a way that you can do anything you want on Arbitrum. There's this sort of alternative path, basically. Long story short, it's a lot slower. I think Patrick talked about this, well, I'm going to stop talking about him, but it's on my mind. But yeah, the point is, the system can work in a sort of slower way, in a slightly more inconvenient way. It can work without the sequencer entirely, so it's entirely optional and that's why we can still call this thing a layer two and sleep at night. So I've just been talking about the sequencer like it's my friend or something, but what actually is it? And basically we just define the sequencer as this entity that can give these fast promises.\\n00:09:16.122 - 00:10:03.770, Speaker A: That has all the properties that I had. But you might ask, how does it decide which transactions to include, who controls it, in what order these transactions go and so on.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nThey do this distributed key generation. So you encrypt your transactions, give it to the sequencer, the sequencer commits to an ordering blindly. It doesn't know the contents of the transactions, commits to it off chain. Right? And then only after it commits to them do we sort of reveal the contents of it. So now the sequencer can't easily extract value because it doesn't know what it's looking at.\\n00:16:12.818 - 00:16:41.654, Speaker A: So this is cool. And there's some added levels, some potential concerns. Let's say the parties that are in charge of this distributed key generation. The idea is you distribute it so that they can't easily collude. But if they do collude, they could, for example, reveal the contents of the transactions to the sequencer before you want to. Also, if they sort of don't reveal keys in time, things like that, there's certain ways that they can delay things further. And remember, this was kind of all about improving latency.\\n00:16:41.654 - 00:17:09.560, Speaker A: So we do want to take latency concerns seriously. Even in the sort of normal case, when you're doing this threshold encryption stuff, there's rounds of communication that are required, so it's inevitably going to add some latency. So that's one concern in our eyes. But, yeah, cool stuff. So, I mean, these two techniques so far, again, you could apply these to a centralized sequencer. We haven't really talked about decentralizing, it just limiting its power. Now, let's get to some ideas for more properly decentralizing it.\\n00:17:09.560 - 00:17:49.138, Speaker A: So one design space, let's say, is that of mev auctions, as it's known, proposed by some of the folks at Optimism, along with a few others some years ago. I'm going to describe it sort of in the abstract. I'm not claiming this is their plan or anything like that, just sort of talking about the design space. So the idea here is you can imagine at any given time we can point to who the sequencer is. It's still one specific party, even a centralized party, but every so often over time, we hold an auction and you can buy the right to become the sequencer. Okay? In that sense, it becomes, in the big picture, permissionless. Now, why would you want to be a sequencer? Seems like a thankless job.\\n00:17:49.138 - 00:18:36.900, Speaker A: The answer is, by being a sequencer, you have the power and the ability to profit by extracting mev. So this design kind of leans into the mev thing and kind of says, yeah, let's take advantage of this and use mev as a revenue source. Again, that's sort of a philosophical distinction or an ideological one even in terms of how we want to handle it. I think important in the mental model for these is that these auctions kind of have to be infrequent. It's not as though these potential sequencers are sitting, looking at transactions, seeing ways to extract value from particular transactions and then bidding on the rights to order them. It's more like they're bidding on their future potential for ordering.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Julien Niset Why account abstraction on L2 is critical for mass adoption\\nchannel_name: [EthCC] Livestream 6\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDrT3s9PrY\\nrelease_date: 2022-07-20\\n\\nAll these become possible because with account abstraction, every account is a smart contract. And what I think is very exciting is that there's actually two leading layer two solution starquare with StarkNet and Mata Labs with ZK Sync that have decided to launch with native account abstraction.\\n00:08:35.518 - 00:09:17.082, Speaker A: So we actually have very soon in production two systems that are both ZK rollup so that can scale and that enable native account abstraction, which means that we can also scale the user experience. And of course, that's why at Argent we've been very excited about these two projects and that's why we've started building on them. So, of course, if every account is a smart contract. That's fantastic. But it cannot be any smart contract. Of course, there needs to be some certain interface that the operating system, the EVM, the Kros, whatever, understand to interact with accounts. And so we've been working with OpenZeppelin and Starquare on defining that interface in StarkNet.\\n00:09:17.082 - 00:10:01.482, Speaker A: So I will illustrate the rest of this talk with StarkNet. But of course, a lot of it applied to ZkSync. And so we came up with the following interface that every account needs to satisfy. So having a quick look again, PDF are not a great idea. But anyway, there's two important method on the interface of your account is a method to validate and a method to execute transaction. The goal of the validate method is actually it's a way for the operating system dos or the sequencer to quickly validate that a transaction will be valid and that it will be paid on ethereum. This is typically done by DVM, by just checking the signature, checking the nons and making sure that you have enough ease to pay the minor fee.\\n00:10:01.482 - 00:10:31.830, Speaker A: And that's why you typically pay 21,000 gas for that validation execution. And so with account abstraction, you can actually program the rules of that validation. And once the transaction is validated, there's a second method to execute. So typically when you submit a transaction, the Kos in this case will call validate and then we'll call execute. So these are the two central method of an account. There's a third one which I believe is very important. It's a way to verify offchain signatures.\\n00:10:31.830 - 00:11:02.174, Speaker A: If your account defines the logic of what a valid transaction is or what a valid signature is. Of course, if you sign an off chain message, like an EIP 712 for example, you cannot verify the validity of that signature locally using, say, EC recover. If you build a DAP, the only person or the only object that knows if the signature is valid is the account itself. And so you need a way to contact the account. And that's why we build a method called doing is valid signature. For those who know it. It's exactly? EIP 1271 in ethereum.\\n00:11:02.174 - 00:11:40.366, Speaker A: So this has been designed for smart contract wallet, but on StarkNet it will be really at the interface of every single account.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution\\nchannel_name: Ethereum Foundation\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-12\\n\\nI think important in the mental model for these is that these auctions kind of have to be infrequent.

These auctions need to be infrequent because frequent sequencer turnover would defeat the purpose of having a known sequencer for fast transactions (source: Speaker A).\\n\\nThe sequencer's ability to order transactions gives them the power to extract value through MEV. MEV refers to the ability to order transactions in a way that benefits the sequencer, allowing them to extract value from the transactions. However, there are concerns about the tension between MEV extraction and the desire for low latency in transaction processing. Optimizing for MEV extraction may introduce latency, which goes against the goal of fast transaction processing (source: Speaker A).\\n\\nTo address the potential issues with a centralized sequencer and the extraction of MEV, there are discussions and proposals for decentralizing or limiting the power of the sequencer. One approach is the concept of MEV auctions, where the rights to be a sequencer are auctioned off. This introduces the possibility of practical centralization, where a single party keeps winning the auction repeatedly. There are also concerns about the potential for censorship or griefing by random parties who gain the power to order transactions (source: Speaker A).\\n\\nIn order to decentralize the sequencer, some proposals suggest replacing the single party sequencer with a fixed federation or committee of sequencers. These sequencers would need to come to consensus, similar to a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, in order to give a receipt for the transactions. This approach aims to distribute the power of ordering transactions and reduce the potential for MEV extraction (source: Speaker A).\",\n        \"metadata\": \"[Title]: Understanding L2: Ordering and Execution, [Channel name]: Ethereum Foundation, [Video Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcOaH9GL-78, [Published date]: 2022-10-12\\n[Title]: Julien Niset Why account abstraction on L2 is critical for mass adoption, [Channel name]: [EthCC] Livestream 6, [Video Link]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpDrT3s9PrY, [Published date]: 2022-07-20\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n        \"retrieved_context\": null,\n        \"previous_answer\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"event_type\": \"LLM end\",\n        \"LLM_response\": \"Thought: I can answer without using any more tools.\\nAnswer: L2 sequencers work by introducing a centralized entity called a sequencer that is responsible for ordering and executing transactions on Layer 2 (L2) solutions. The sequencer receives transactions from users and periodically posts batches of transactions on the L2 chain, finalizing the transaction ordering. This centralized approach allows the sequencer to extract maximal extractable value (MEV) from the transactions.

It seems like a pretty evenly footed race at the moment between Polygon, Solana, Immutable, X, and I would say those are kind of the four. The ones that we don't see are like the app chains. Game developers are just trying to figure out how to build stuff on chain. You talk to them about having their own token, running their own ballot, they're like, no, absolutely not. And so do we think that they're going to want their app chains eventually? Probably the biggest ones. I would also say things like board Ape Yacht Club and how big and how impressive they are. They weren't even able to do this, so it's harder than you think.\\n00:52:50.500 - 00:53:04.520, Speaker A: But yeah, it seems like kind of they're all fighting it out. Avalanche as well, is another one. Kind of the ones with the best BD are the ones that seem to be kind of like winning. I don't know if any of them are the long term gaming, though.\\n00:53:04.890 - 00:53:10.266, Speaker C: Yeah, it's possible.

And this collaboration doesn't work without strong privacy because you always have to be very aware that others can steal your bundles and kind of steal money from you.\\n00:39:56.954 - 00:40:10.298, Speaker B: And so it turns out that privacy is just of fundamental importance for the mev supply chain. And yeah, we couldn't kind of achieve our goals if we don't solve the privacy puzzle.\\n00:40:10.394 - 00:40:21.710, Speaker A: Yeah, and mev share, which went live relatively recently, I think is a super cool example of that, as well as something that wouldn't be possible without the power of privacy.\\n00:40:21.790 - 00:41:23.698, Speaker B: Yeah, so Mev share is a new order flow auction that differs kind of from all existing products in the sense that searchers can basically run on encrypted user orders. So searchers submit their backgrounds without actually seeing all of the information about the user order. So right now we reveal some amount of information not enough to front run, but just enough kind of to constrain the search space so that searches are not completely blind. And then the block builders are in charge of running this simulation and matching the orders together, which is very cool. And for searchers, it's a completely new paradigm. Kind of searching on private data is not what they are used to, but we think it yields fundamentally better outcomes for users. And if you kind of continue this line of thought, then the next step here is kind of searchers searching on searcher orders, not just on user orders.\\n00:41:23.698 - 00:42:10.566, Speaker B: So, for example, one searcher could do an arbitrage and another searcher could kind of do another part of the arbitrage that maybe the first searcher was not willing to take because of risk limits or because they had a different ability to hatch or search us kind of back running each other or matching complementary traits together. I think we are looking at ways that kind of order flow can be aggregated in a trustless way that doesn't require trust from anyone and also kind of removes trust in the auctioneer itself. And yeah, I think that's kind of the next big item on our yes.\\n00:42:10.668 - 00:43:14.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to get into order flow auctions because that was a great episode that we did with Quintess and Barnaby. But before we do, I have one question for you because this was I actually thought one of my it was a telling moment in the series, I think, when it was the searcher episode and you asked both Dean and Anish, are you using private order flow? And there was probably a five second pause and anish, you know, very diplomatically said, I think you'd be hard pressed to find any and one sort of trend that privacy sort of is definitely this good market primitive. I'm also, to be honest, to just be transparent, I'm ideologically in the camp of privacy. I sort of find myself rooting for more privacy.

If several files are matched across several years of release dates, favor most recent content. Now answer the question: Do an exhaustive breakdown of the MEV supply chain\\nAnswer: \"\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM end\",\n                \"LLM_response\": \"The MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) supply chain can be broken down into several components and processes. Here is an exhaustive breakdown of the MEV supply chain based on the provided context information:\\n\\n1. Searchers: Searchers are the participants in the MEV supply chain who actively search for and extract value from blockchain transactions. They analyze the transaction flow, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades or other actions to maximize their profits. Searchers can be individuals or entities that have the necessary technical expertise and resources to perform these activities.\\n\\n2. Order Flow Auctions (OFAs): Order Flow Auctions are a mechanism used in the MEV supply chain to facilitate the interaction between searchers and block builders. In an OFA, searchers submit their orders, which can be encrypted to protect privacy, and block builders match these orders to create blocks of transactions. The goal is to achieve better outcomes for users and remove the need for trust in the auctioneer. (source: \\\"Season 4 Finale: An MEV Masterclass\\\" - Bell Curve)\\n\\n3. Block Builders: Block builders are responsible for creating blocks of transactions that are added to the blockchain. They receive the orders from searchers through the OFA mechanism and construct blocks that include these transactions. Block builders play a crucial role in determining the order and inclusion of transactions in the blockchain, which can impact the MEV extracted by searchers.\\n\\n4. Privacy: Privacy is a fundamental aspect of the MEV supply chain. Strong privacy measures are necessary to protect sensitive information and prevent front-running or other malicious activities. Privacy enables collaboration between small and large parties in the MEV extraction and block building processes. (source: \\\"Season 4 Finale: An MEV Masterclass\\\" - Bell Curve)\\n\\n5. Data Availability: Data availability is another important consideration in the MEV supply chain.

Here is an exhaustive breakdown of the MEV supply chain based on the provided context information:\\n\\n1. Searchers: Searchers are the participants in the MEV supply chain who actively search for and extract value from blockchain transactions. They analyze the transaction flow, identify profitable opportunities, and execute trades or other actions to maximize their profits. Searchers can be individuals or entities that have the necessary technical expertise and resources to perform these activities.\\n\\n2. Order Flow Auctions (OFAs): Order Flow Auctions are a mechanism used in the MEV supply chain to facilitate the interaction between searchers and block builders. In an OFA, searchers submit their orders, which can be encrypted to protect privacy, and block builders match these orders to create blocks of transactions. The goal is to achieve better outcomes for users and remove the need for trust in the auctioneer. (source: \\\"Season 4 Finale: An MEV Masterclass\\\" - Bell Curve)\\n\\n3. Block Builders: Block builders are responsible for creating blocks of transactions that are added to the blockchain. They receive the orders from searchers through the OFA mechanism and construct blocks that include these transactions. Block builders play a crucial role in determining the order and inclusion of transactions in the blockchain, which can impact the MEV extracted by searchers.\\n\\n4. Privacy: Privacy is a fundamental aspect of the MEV supply chain. Strong privacy measures are necessary to protect sensitive information and prevent front-running or other malicious activities. Privacy enables collaboration between small and large parties in the MEV extraction and block building processes. (source: \\\"Season 4 Finale: An MEV Masterclass\\\" - Bell Curve)\\n\\n5.

There's definitely been, I feel like, a bit of a change. And this was a lot of what we spoke about at Vienna, particularly after ECC. So a lot of the reason to do enshrine PBS EPBs for a long time was thought of as, okay, we'll do EPBs and then the relays go away. That's kind of the reason to do it. And there's starting to be more, I would say, realization lately is that, okay, even if we do EPBs, relays probably stick around or something very much like them in a reduced role, I would say, from where they are today, where they're significantly less systemically important and less relied upon.\\n01:27:36.746 - 01:28:51.686, Speaker C: And they provide less of an advantage, but where there is probably still an incentive to use some sort of out of protocol solutions that are probably more optimal than using the Enshrined PBS protocol. So some of the simple examples are even if we do this Enshrined PBS, where there is this canonical P to P pool where this is where the bids are and this is where you're supposed to listen to what are some advantages that some sort of out of protocol actor like a relay could still potentially provide you. So a couple of the simple ones that seem to be pretty important are one of the really simple ones is just flexible payments of, like, the way that you would do the payments in this kind of epps world. Would be like the main idea is probably to do something called tob Top of block payments, where I would be able to, as a builder, send you a bid that even if I don't give you the block body, you could take the payment. So that works well in most cases. There are certain times where you would want more flexible payments of, let's say this is like a gigantic mev block where I'm going to get 1000 ETH in the block or whatever and I'm only going to be able to give you the bid for that 1000 ETH after the execution payload. So I can't send you the 1000 ETH in the top of block payment because I actually don't have it yet.\\n01:28:51.686 - 01:28:58.470, Speaker C: The only way I can send it to you is you need a check at the end of the block like, hey, I made the money and I can actually send it to you.\\n01:28:58.540 - 01:28:59.810, Speaker B: So that's a service that really the.\\n01:28:59.820 - 01:29:06.922, Speaker A: Relay is fronting the money but only atomically for the relay. It's trustless. Right? But that is something that the protocol cannot do.\\n01:29:06.976 - 01:29:53.466, Speaker C: Yeah, they're effectively guaranteeing to the proposer like, hey, don't worry, the builder is good for this the block, they definitely capture it, we're going to pay it to at the end. And so that is one scenario where it is still potentially useful to have some sort of third party who's mediating this fair exchange between the proposer and the builders. That may be more of like an edge case.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nThe main pressing result of that though is okay, we do need to figure out funding for a lot of the tangible stuff, particularly for relay funding. That is the main question out of this. PBS Gildon similar ideas is that this is part of the benefit of EPBs in my mind is it gets rid of the relay funding issues. At that point you should not get any funding.\\n01:39:24.266 - 01:40:18.098, Speaker C: Like you are a latency optimization service, you're not fundamental to the protocol. But the big question today is that we're not there and the relays are pretty fundamental to holding up the PBS process, at least for the untrusted participants. So in the absence of relays you would have today like the top 90% or whatever number of validators and top 90% of builders, they're fine, they could trust each other. Lido and Beaver build like hey, we know each other, we could trust each other, is fine. But the relays are fundamental to upholding the hey, that last 5%, 10%, whatever that number is of like they would not be trusted to receive something from a builder. So they are fundamental for that and as of right now, they're not a business that's able to monetize that. So the question is how do we try to fund these? Hopefully we have a upvs at some point in the next couple of years, whatever it is.\\n01:40:18.098 - 01:40:28.626, Speaker C: But for today, people have to run these relays. It costs some money and it may not be profitable for them to do so. So figuring out that is one of the main directives of something like this.\\n01:40:28.808 - 01:41:20.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. I mean, I think how static you can make it, how close you think you are to something that can be static. I think for me that is a key determinant to whether you want to pull it into the protocol. I think before that point it really makes sense to address kind of the relay sustainability issues. Why are we talking about this? I mean, it's because relays basically have a hard time monetizing in a market driven way because they basically become too like if some relays charge fees they become too easy to bypass and you really create an incentive just for a builder basically to run their own relay or for a pool to run their own relay. And at that point they can do it cheaper and better and faster basically. So it's like the current market structure really doesn't support monetization through fees.\\n01:41:20.594 - 01:42:04.500, Speaker A: And to me this suggests that what we need is kind of an entity, like an independent entity that can support relays to grant funding. And in my view, this could also solve some of the other issues. It could make the governance of mev boost more open. It could support development work and yeah, possibly even govern not just Mev boost, but kind of more the umbrella idea of PBS that we have been talking about and kind of, for example, help layer twos figure out what they should be doing with regards to this.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nBut yeah, the kind of long tail goal here is to get to a point where we can explore and kind of forerun some of the features that would be present in an enshrined PBS mechanism through the existing relay market that we have today. So that's kind of the high level goal of optimistic relaying generally.\\n00:52:09.762 - 00:52:23.114, Speaker E: Yeah, let's stick with that for a bit here. So EPBs, Enshrined PBS, what is it, what is really the central problem that it's trying to solve or that needs.\\n00:52:23.152 - 00:52:24.998, Speaker A: To be solved to have Epps?\\n00:52:25.174 - 00:52:40.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the high level problem is just trying to eliminate the need for the relay market. Ideally we want some way to facilitate the auction between the proposer and the builder without needing a trusted third party.\\n00:52:41.330 - 00:52:44.100, Speaker E: And why is it difficult to do that?\\n00:52:45.270 - 00:53:36.110, Speaker D: Yeah, it's difficult because the relays provide some services that the protocol actually we can try to provide them in the protocol but they're slightly different in the way they actually manifest themselves. So in our recent EPBs relays post EPBs post I think we described PBS as kind of a two part mechanism. It has a commit reveal scheme which is to enforce that the proposer commits to a bid before seeing the actual block and then it has an unconditional payment mechanism. The relays enforce the unconditional payment mechanism through basically checking the contents of the block because the relays have the block in the clear they can see. Okay, the balance before and after the block is executed increases for the proposer.\\n00:53:36.950 - 00:53:42.500, Speaker E: What do all of these things tell us about what's the minimum viable EPBs going to look like?\\n00:53:43.350 - 00:54:35.010, Speaker D: Yeah, so the minimum viable EPBs would be a commit reveal scheme to allow the proposers to commit to a builder block and then an unconditional payment mechanism. So the unconditional payment mechanism is important because we no longer have the relay to verify that the payment goes from the builder to the proposer. So the kind of easiest version of this is what we've proposed called top of block payments. And the requirement here is that the builder submits along with their bid a valid transaction that pays the proposer the amount that is associated with the bid. So this along with just enforcing that the proposer kind of at the protocol level can sign onto a block header without seeing the block contents is the minimal EPBs instantiation that we're considering.\\n00:54:35.450 - 00:54:43.014, Speaker E: So I assume that would require then changes to how blocks work basically in Ethereum like the format of them.\\n00:54:43.212 - 00:55:43.500, Speaker D: Yeah. So the important enforcement mechanism here is that if a proposer commits to a block and the builder has a chance basically to reveal their payload and that payload can make it on chain.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nIt could make the governance of mev boost more open. It could support development work and yeah, possibly even govern not just Mev boost, but kind of more the umbrella idea of PBS that we have been talking about and kind of, for example, help layer twos figure out what they should be doing with regards to this.\\n01:42:05.430 - 01:42:23.498, Speaker C: Yeah, certainly on the base layer, depending on where the EPBs road kind of goes. I mean, I definitely see that being valuable. I've mentioned this before, I don't see this needing to play a role for layer twos at all in my mind. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.\\n01:42:23.584 - 01:42:59.334, Speaker A: Yeah, why not? I give you my case. The case is not it's not at all about sustainability. Right. I'm not saying that entities should fund the research for layer two. So they would be crazy. I think the layer twos can pay for it and I think it's like especially they could contribute to something like that as the grants actually like the grantees, if you will. I mean, more in the sense that there isn't a whole lot of expertise right now in building this.\\n01:42:59.334 - 01:43:03.446, Speaker A: Right, so you basically want to bring parties together. You want to bring the parties who.\\n01:43:03.468 - 01:43:04.646, Speaker E: Need it and who can fund it.\\n01:43:04.668 - 01:43:20.940, Speaker A: With the parties, who actually can build it and who understand deeply what goes into making kind of an efficient and robust kind of implementation of this. And yeah, that's my thinking behind it. What about you?\\n01:43:21.790 - 01:43:32.990, Speaker C: So what exactly would the L two S involvement in this really be then? I mean, they would be funding it, if anything, not like being a recipient of it. I don't see why you need another.\\n01:43:33.060 - 01:43:53.560, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, I mean, I maybe used the wrong word. Yeah, no, they would be funding it and they would outsource the building of their form of PBS possibly to the same parties who do it on layer one or like kind of this body. Do you think they want to own the building and maintenance of this?\\n01:43:54.650 - 01:44:46.534, Speaker C: Yes, one, I'm influenced by the fact that I think that they are very different problems in many ways, layer ones versus layer twos. And I think that different roll ups also have probably makes sense for them to have very different opinionated designs at PBS. Like it can look very different from one roll up to another. So part of it is that part of that is also I think that is something that fundamentally they do kind of want control over. For some of them it is a pretty important selling point of what they're going for. Like Arbitrarim being kind of the simplest example of a lot of their research around first come, first serve and how that's evolved over time.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: PBS and Beyond\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk2tQA_Pxfo\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-08\\n\\nIf we just go straight into Enshrine PBS, I think that would have been a bigger problem that we probably have to do some crazy hard work in the middle. So yeah, personally I'm very grateful of Medboos and because it basically allow us to learn so much.\\n00:16:47.570 - 00:18:01.350, Speaker B: Yeah. I also wanted to add you asked about what's coming down the pipeline in the next few months. One thing that I've been working a lot on and thinking a lot about is kind of as we do this blue sky research around Enshrined PBS and kind of think about the top down approach of really fixing this at the protocol layer. We also have the advantage of having the relays already running and we have kind of this whole ecosystem in place. So we've been working on this thing called optimistic relaying where we can kind of mold the behavior of the relays to look to kind of both derisk some of the EPBs design aspects but also to make the relays perhaps more sustainable and just better at servicing the builders and the validators. So I guess the overall theme of the optimistic relay roadmap is to remove some of the roles from the relay and replace those roles with a collateral that kind of enforces the builder behavior at the relay level. So I think in the short term that's like the easiest path to both making relays more sustainable and derisking some of the EPBs stuff.\\n00:18:01.350 - 00:18:06.630, Speaker B: But longer term I still hope that we go the\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nAnd it's been interesting.

Hopefully we have a upvs at some point in the next couple of years, whatever it is.\\n01:40:18.098 - 01:40:28.626, Speaker C: But for today, people have to run these relays. It costs some money and it may not be profitable for them to do so. So figuring out that is one of the main directives of something like this.\\n01:40:28.808 - 01:41:20.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. I mean, I think how static you can make it, how close you think you are to something that can be static. I think for me that is a key determinant to whether you want to pull it into the protocol. I think before that point it really makes sense to address kind of the relay sustainability issues. Why are we talking about this? I mean, it's because relays basically have a hard time monetizing in a market driven way because they basically become too like if some relays charge fees they become too easy to bypass and you really create an incentive just for a builder basically to run their own relay or for a pool to run their own relay. And at that point they can do it cheaper and better and faster basically. So it's like the current market structure really doesn't support monetization through fees.\\n01:41:20.594 - 01:42:04.500, Speaker A: And to me this suggests that what we need is kind of an entity, like an independent entity that can support relays to grant funding. And in my view, this could also solve some of the other issues. It could make the governance of mev boost more open. It could support development work and yeah, possibly even govern not just Mev boost, but kind of more the umbrella idea of PBS that we have been talking about and kind of, for example, help layer twos figure out what they should be doing with regards to this.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nBut yeah, the kind of long tail goal here is to get to a point where we can explore and kind of forerun some of the features that would be present in an enshrined PBS mechanism through the existing relay market that we have today. So that's kind of the high level goal of optimistic relaying generally.\\n00:52:09.762 - 00:52:23.114, Speaker E: Yeah, let's stick with that for a bit here. So EPBs, Enshrined PBS, what is it, what is really the central problem that it's trying to solve or that needs.\\n00:52:23.152 - 00:52:24.998, Speaker A: To be solved to have Epps?\\n00:52:25.174 - 00:52:40.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the high level problem is just trying to eliminate the need for the relay market. Ideally we want some way to facilitate the auction between the proposer and the builder without needing a trusted third party.\\n00:52:41.330 - 00:52:44.100, Speaker E: And why is it difficult to do that?\\n00:52:45.270 - 00:53:36.110, Speaker D: Yeah, it's difficult because the relays provide some services that the protocol actually we can try to provide them in the protocol but they're slightly different in the way they actually manifest themselves. So in our recent EPBs relays post EPBs post I think we described PBS as kind of a two part mechanism. It has a commit reveal scheme which is to enforce that the proposer commits to a bid before seeing the actual block and then it has an unconditional payment mechanism. The relays enforce the unconditional payment mechanism through basically checking the contents of the block because the relays have the block in the clear they can see. Okay, the balance before and after the block is executed increases for the proposer.\\n00:53:36.950 - 00:53:42.500, Speaker E: What do all of these things tell us about what's the minimum viable EPBs going to look like?\\n00:53:43.350 - 00:54:35.010, Speaker D: Yeah, so the minimum viable EPBs would be a commit reveal scheme to allow the proposers to commit to a builder block and then an unconditional payment mechanism. So the unconditional payment mechanism is important because we no longer have the relay to verify that the payment goes from the builder to the proposer. So the kind of easiest version of this is what we've proposed called top of block payments. And the requirement here is that the builder submits along with their bid a valid transaction that pays the proposer the amount that is associated with the bid. So this along with just enforcing that the proposer kind of at the protocol level can sign onto a block header without seeing the block contents is the minimal EPBs instantiation that we're considering.\\n00:54:35.450 - 00:54:43.014, Speaker E: So I assume that would require then changes to how blocks work basically in Ethereum like the format of them.\\n00:54:43.212 - 00:55:43.500, Speaker D: Yeah. So the important enforcement mechanism here is that if a proposer commits to a block and the builder has a chance basically to reveal their payload and that payload can make it on chain.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: An Incomplete Guide to PBS - with Mike Neuder and Chris Hager\\nchannel_name: Uncommon Core 2.0\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEbK9AX7X7o\\nrelease_date: 2023-09-02\\n\\nIt could make the governance of mev boost more open. It could support development work and yeah, possibly even govern not just Mev boost, but kind of more the umbrella idea of PBS that we have been talking about and kind of, for example, help layer twos figure out what they should be doing with regards to this.\\n01:42:05.430 - 01:42:23.498, Speaker C: Yeah, certainly on the base layer, depending on where the EPBs road kind of goes. I mean, I definitely see that being valuable. I've mentioned this before, I don't see this needing to play a role for layer twos at all in my mind. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.\\n01:42:23.584 - 01:42:59.334, Speaker A: Yeah, why not? I give you my case. The case is not it's not at all about sustainability. Right. I'm not saying that entities should fund the research for layer two. So they would be crazy. I think the layer twos can pay for it and I think it's like especially they could contribute to something like that as the grants actually like the grantees, if you will. I mean, more in the sense that there isn't a whole lot of expertise right now in building this.\\n01:42:59.334 - 01:43:03.446, Speaker A: Right, so you basically want to bring parties together. You want to bring the parties who.\\n01:43:03.468 - 01:43:04.646, Speaker E: Need it and who can fund it.\\n01:43:04.668 - 01:43:20.940, Speaker A: With the parties, who actually can build it and who understand deeply what goes into making kind of an efficient and robust kind of implementation of this. And yeah, that's my thinking behind it. What about you?\\n01:43:21.790 - 01:43:32.990, Speaker C: So what exactly would the L two S involvement in this really be then? I mean, they would be funding it, if anything, not like being a recipient of it. I don't see why you need another.\\n01:43:33.060 - 01:43:53.560, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, I mean, I maybe used the wrong word. Yeah, no, they would be funding it and they would outsource the building of their form of PBS possibly to the same parties who do it on layer one or like kind of this body. Do you think they want to own the building and maintenance of this?\\n01:43:54.650 - 01:44:46.534, Speaker C: Yes, one, I'm influenced by the fact that I think that they are very different problems in many ways, layer ones versus layer twos. And I think that different roll ups also have probably makes sense for them to have very different opinionated designs at PBS. Like it can look very different from one roll up to another. So part of it is that part of that is also I think that is something that fundamentally they do kind of want control over. For some of them it is a pretty important selling point of what they're going for. Like Arbitrarim being kind of the simplest example of a lot of their research around first come, first serve and how that's evolved over time.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEVday Paris: PBS and Beyond\\nchannel_name: Frontier Research\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk2tQA_Pxfo\\nrelease_date: 2023-08-08\\n\\nIf we just go straight into Enshrine PBS, I think that would have been a bigger problem that we probably have to do some crazy hard work in the middle.

So I guess the overall theme of the optimistic relay roadmap is to remove some of the roles from the relay and replace those roles with a collateral that kind of enforces the builder behavior at the relay level.

Sorry, Danning. Okay. I'm Robert Miller. My slides will hopefully appear at some point in the future, and until then you are stuck in silence with me. I'm told they are running. Okay, so I'm Robert Miller.\\n05:00:11.060 - 05:01:46.628, Speaker A: I have a talk here, obviously, and in thinking about what to talk to you all today about, I thought first, should I say something about PBS? It's PBS day and I thought, no, you probably have heard something about PBS before. At this point, you know about it, someone else will talk about it. Then I thought, should I talk about Suave? We just released a new blog post outlining an architecture introducing the mevm. I thought, well, I'm not sure that's the most interesting thing since you can go and read my blog post on how the mevm and our latest design for Suave works. And looking at the past schedule that I had this week, it seemed that there are a lot of new chains and domains that are interested in integrating PBS and they're interested in knowing about how Suave can support them if they do support PBS. And so that's sort of the premise of my talk, is how does Suave support many different domains, heterogeneous domains that have different virtual machines, different ways of ordering, and what is the architecture that enables that? And I'm going to begin by giving you a little bit maybe these slides are a little different than I expected, but I will begin by giving you some context on the thinking behind Suave and where we were a few years ago when the early ideas of Suave started to coalesce for Flashpots, something like late 2021. So this is kind of the first idea.\\n05:01:46.628 - 05:02:40.470, Speaker A: Mev is fundamental, it's fundamental to every domain, and that's for a few reasons. The first is this ability that blockchains give you to make commitments and you can commit to pay for some arbitrary state and that then alters the incentives of the party that's ordering transactions. Second is that we use this ability to commit as a part of a common design pattern in building permissionless systems. So these commitments are a fundamental part of something like DeFi in liquidations. You give a permissionless bribe to anyone who will update the state of your collateral when prices have moved. Or in CryptoKitties, you give a permissionless payment to anyone who calls a function to update the state of the system. So this permissionless bribe, this permissionless commitment that anyone can capture, is kind of this common design pattern to the systems that we're building.\\n05:02:40.470 - 05:03:30.756, Speaker A: And lastly, mev is fundamental because even if you don't have mev on one domain, there exists mev between the boundaries of different domains and that creates value extraction opportunities. If there was no mev on Ethereum, there would still be mev between Ethereum and BSc as an example. So that was the first idea. Second idea, mev has these negative effects.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: SUAVE - Turning Zero-Sum to Positive-Sum Game - Robert Miller\\nchannel_name: Celestia\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEaXyF6xSg0\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-28\\n\\nSo that was my talk. Slides got a little bit screwed up, so I had a little bit more content, but that's okay. So thanks for listening. That's how we plan on addressing many different domains for Suave, regardless of whether you are PBS or not PBS.\\n00:12:58.574 - 00:13:24.380, Speaker A: We have a couple different call outs here, so if you're interested in integrating as a roll up, please reach out. If you're a developer interested in building Mev applications on Suave, please reach out as well. Wallets if you're interested in Mev Redistribution, searchers for private order flow, and that is a QR code if you want to work at Flashbots. So thank you so much. We really appreciate it. I think we have Mike coming and talking about PBS next.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: S4 Premiere: A Journey Into The Dark Forest | Hasu\\nchannel_name: Bell Curve\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8DkRO60fvw\\nrelease_date: 2023-03-28\\n\\nSo yeah, I'm really looking forward to digging into it. And we've got a great first episode lined up with Justin and Tarun, so we'll dig into it more then.\\n01:05:28.188 - 01:05:32.006, Speaker B: Yeah, sounds great. I look forward to that episode as well.\\n01:05:32.108 - 01:05:39.090, Speaker A: All right, my friend, I'll talk to you sooner.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: MEV in a Modular World | Jon Charbonneau, Robert Miller\\nchannel_name: Bell Curve\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3o2YP6sxpg\\nrelease_date: 2023-04-18\\n\\nBut we're not prescriptive on one way or another. That's the starting point. Got it? And different users will have different levels of risk that they're willing to take. So some users will be willing to take the risk of hey, maybe one leg will fail and the other will not.\\n01:00:49.114 - 01:02:08.642, Speaker C: And I'm willing to execute one part of the trade and not another. On the other side of this market, there may be executors that are willing to take that risk and they may charge some payment if one leg is successful, but not the other. And some users may be willing only to pay or to make their trades if both sides of their trade are executed. And the sort of abstraction of Suave supports both of these different types of models where it's all or nothing even with your trade or only one side of your trade being executed. The complexity with that is if you want all or nothing with both of your trades being executed, if you want it to work in this way, then I think the assets actually need to be settled on Suave, the domain itself instead of on polygon or Arbitrum. And that may be unacceptable to some users, but this is a possibility at least. And Suave is trying to support all these different potential models of who is taking on what risk, how much they're paying for it, and what sort of execution is happening in the background, whether that's Typhoon, whether that's shared sequencing, whether that's a market maker that's really good at evaluating risk on many different domains.\\n01:02:08.642 - 01:02:10.786, Speaker C: So did that answer your question, Michael?\\n01:02:10.898 - 01:02:11.894, Speaker A: Yeah, it did.\\n01:02:12.092 - 01:02:14.054, Speaker C: Appreciate it. Yeah.\\n01:02:14.092 - 01:02:49.460, Speaker B: So the way I think we think about Swab internally, I think is definitely more as the demand side for these cross domain transactions and then kind of expose a lot of tools that allow for supply side also to emerge. Right. And these definitely include the shared sequences that John was talking about at length earlier, but also any other form. And they kind of get easier to build and integrate because swap provides kind of the tools for trustless collaboration on private data, basically.\\n01:02:50.950 - 01:03:36.630, Speaker C: And what I would say too, is that by aggregating this demand side, by creating, to your point, Michael, standards for how this sort of bid or value that users are willing to pay for cross domain atomicity by exposing that to the world, you then provide incentives for proposers to pursue cross domain atomicity solutions like Typhoon. Like shared sequencing. Because they see, hey, there is all this value that I can get as a proposer if I integrate solutions that make it less risky for users to execute on these types of preferences. So in that way, it creates a market that I think incentivizes the exploration of more cross domain solutions.\\n01:03:36.810 - 01:03:56.006, Speaker A: Excellent.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Private Order Flow is the new MEV\\nchannel_name: Bell Curve\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9FmmsW9cHY\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-07\\n\\nThat, I think, is a really huge onboarding experience. That's what Robert and Stanny are referring to.\\n00:51:56.310 - 00:52:05.170, Speaker B: All right, let's get it. So what l one is winning the gaming. All these gaming companies, no clear winner.\\n00:52:05.910 - 00:52:50.500, Speaker A: We start a season portfolio company kind of tells us where are people building? It seems like a pretty evenly footed race at the moment between Polygon, Solana, Immutable, X, and I would say those are kind of the four. The ones that we don't see are like the app chains. Game developers are just trying to figure out how to build stuff on chain. You talk to them about having their own token, running their own ballot, they're like, no, absolutely not. And so do we think that they're going to want their app chains eventually? Probably the biggest ones. I would also say things like board Ape Yacht Club and how big and how impressive they are. They weren't even able to do this, so it's harder than you think.\\n00:52:50.500 - 00:53:04.520, Speaker A: But yeah, it seems like kind of they're all fighting it out. Avalanche as well, is another one. Kind of the ones with the best BD are the ones that seem to be kind of like winning. I don't know if any of them are the long term gaming, though.\\n00:53:04.890 - 00:53:10.266, Speaker C: Yeah, it's possible. We still haven't seen that long term gaming winner I would say probable that.\\n00:53:10.288 - 00:53:11.034, Speaker A: We haven't seen that.\\n00:53:11.072 - 00:53:12.780, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fair.\\n00:53:13.950 - 00:53:16.060, Speaker B: Vance, how's the Adam 2.0 research?\\n00:53:16.510 - 00:53:17.580, Speaker A: It's good.\\n00:53:18.910 - 00:53:20.406, Speaker B: You talked to our analysts yet?\\n00:53:20.528 - 00:53:57.970, Speaker A: Didn't talk to the analysts. Did all the research myself, not some boomer who gets somebody else. Read the white paper for me. I think it's super interesting. I think I came away from my Cosmos research like super bullish on Tendermint, less bullish on Adam. Effectively. What the value prop for Adam is, is that, number one, there's this concept of shared security or being able to rent security from kind of like Atom stakers.\\n00:53:57.970 - 00:54:39.586, Speaker A: And if you're trying to bootstrap your own chain, just renting security from Adam is like a pretty easy way to start. I think that's interesting. You have to pay for the security with your own native token, which kind of makes it seem a little bit akin to polkadot in many ways, where you have to rent a parachain slot.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"event_type\": \"LLM start\",\n                \"tool_output\": \"Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Modular Summit Day 2 (Galois Stage)\\nchannel_name: Celestia\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYH7n4M016A\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-22\\n\\n04:59:22.320 - 04:59:30.700, Speaker C: Okay, cool, thanks.\\n04:59:34.690 - 05:00:11.060, Speaker A: No memes today, unfortunately.

And so do we think that they're going to want their app chains eventually? Probably the biggest ones. I would also say things like board Ape Yacht Club and how big and how impressive they are. They weren't even able to do this, so it's harder than you think.\\n00:52:50.500 - 00:53:04.520, Speaker A: But yeah, it seems like kind of they're all fighting it out.

Fantastic, guys, welcome to the workshop. My name is Alex Kuholzkam, CEO, co founder of Metal Labs, which is the company behind ZK Sync. And we're going to talk about what ZK Sync is. We're going to talk about ZKsync version two. So we have ZK Sync as a ZK roll up for payments and swaps for basic specialized operations on Mainet since two years, with some 200 million dollar value locked. But that's not what we're excited about.\\n00:00:33.302 - 00:01:15.202, Speaker A: We really are looking forward to launching Zkync V Two, which is going to be a lot more interesting. So we'll touch on that, what it is, why it's important, and then we will discover user experience, like how it will feel to your end users. If you're going to build on ZK Sync, then we will deep dive into the actual developer perspective, like what it means to build on it, what nuances you have to observe. And then we're going to talk about security aspects because security is the paramount concern of ZKsync. This is why we're building a ZK roll up specifically. And then we will also touch on the ecosystem and some support programs which we can offer from our side. Now.\\n00:01:15.202 - 00:01:47.086, Speaker A: Okay, so what is ZK sync? ZK sync is an L two powered by ZK EVM. So it has the benefits of EVM. It's fully EVM compatible. You can take anything that is written for EVM in Solidity or Viper or U and just plug and play. And it should work out of box in most cases. It has full web3 API supports your front end, your APIs, your packet services will also work. And the most important thing is that it inherits security from layer one.\\n00:01:47.086 - 00:03:10.380, Speaker A: What this means is your logic of the contracts and your authorizations by the users are verified not by ZKsync Validators, but by Ethereum itself. Every single transaction that happens on ZKsync is checked by all of the Ethereum Validators through verifying the zero knowledge proof. So you can think of zero knowledge proofs. How many of you are familiar with zero knowledge proofs? Okay, so the zero knowledge proofs are, or snarks more specifically, are protocols, cryptographic protocols that enable compression of computation into a very small piece of data that you can check with simple arithmetic operations, which take something like 30 milliseconds on any smartphone. And you can be sure that the result of the computation we've done on arbitrarily large array of data with arbitrary many steps is valid. You don't have to redo all this computation. You can just check the results, get your, for example, your commitment to state merkel root hash and you will be sure that this new root hash is actually in a new state of the blockchain by applying 1 billion of transactions, like all of the world's financial transactions that happened over the last hour or day or whatever.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Why GameFi\\u2019s Best Apps Will Outperform DeFi | Roundup\\nchannel_name: Bell Curve\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1feJXH0_9k\\nrelease_date: 2023-04-21\\n\\n00:00:00.090 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve.

Tell us about the trip.\\n00:01:27.290 - 00:02:06.574, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Like I said, used to live in Japan, so have some experience out there and went to ETH Tokyo. And then I did a quick trip to Korea and also met a bunch of the people who had come from the other crypto conference in Hong Kong. So it was a good kind know view of the entire landscape and seeing everyone.\\n\\ntotal_pages: 20\\nsource: 6\\ndocument_type: research_paper\\ntitle: An Automated Market Maker Minimizing Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\\nauthors: Conor McMenamin, Vanesa Daza, Bruno Mazorra\\npdf_link: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10601v2\\nrelease_date: 2022-10-19\\n\\n3.2\\nLoss-Versus-Rebalancing\\nLVR, and its prevention in AMMs is the primary focus of this paper. The formal-\\nization of LVR [14] has helped to illuminate one of the main costs of providing\\nliquidity in CFMMs. The authors of [14] provide various synonyms to concep-\\ntualize LVR. In this paper, we use the opportunity cost of arbitraging the pool\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: LVR: Loss versus Rebalancing (Tim Roughgarden @ SBC '22)\\nchannel_name: Tim Roughgarden Lectures\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5vyJJb-Uyw\\nrelease_date: 2022-09-07\\n\\nThis, of course, has implications for the design of automated market makers. This says if you want your liquidity providers to be properly incentivized their rewards, their fee revenue should be scaling with the lever. Now remember, lever depends in particular on volatility, actually as sigma squared. So if the volatility doubles, all of a sudden you need the fee revenue to go up by four x. So if you want to design an AMM so that the fee revenue generated is scaling with the lever, you might want to think about dynamic fees. You need to be worried about volatility, you need to be worried about volume.\\n00:25:44.694 - 00:26:31.602, Speaker A: You could either have fees that depend directly on those two quantities, or you could even just measure what the historical lever has been recently and use that to adjust fees. Another implication sort of all else being equal, you obviously want to make the lever as small as possible. The less lever the LPs are losing, the less you need to incentivize them to get them to add liquidity to your pool. So how would you reduce lever keeping all else equal? Well, one idea would be to quote prices not naively using the AMM curve as we're used to doing, but rather using sort of more updated prices than what the naive AMM calculation would give you. For example, by incorporating some kind of pricing oracle. That, of course would open up a whole nother can of worms. But our work does sort of quantify how much better things would be if you could safely incorporate a price oracle into your AMM.\\n00:26:31.602 - 00:26:43.520, Speaker A: I'm told there are already several groups sort of working on these ideas. They're definitely not new ideas to us, but hopefully this work does put these ideas on sound mathematical footing. So I think I'm out of time. Let me stop there.

This says if you want your liquidity providers to be properly incentivized their rewards, their fee revenue should be scaling with the lever. Now remember, lever depends in particular on volatility, actually as sigma squared. So if the volatility doubles, all of a sudden you need the fee revenue to go up by four x. So if you want to design an AMM so that the fee revenue generated is scaling with the lever, you might want to think about dynamic fees. You need to be worried about volatility, you need to be worried about volume.\\n00:25:44.694 - 00:26:31.602, Speaker A: You could either have fees that depend directly on those two quantities, or you could even just measure what the historical lever has been recently and use that to adjust fees. Another implication sort of all else being equal, you obviously want to make the lever as small as possible. The less lever the LPs are losing, the less you need to incentivize them to get them to add liquidity to your pool. So how would you reduce lever keeping all else equal? Well, one idea would be to quote prices not naively using the AMM curve as we're used to doing, but rather using sort of more updated prices than what the naive AMM calculation would give you. For example, by incorporating some kind of pricing oracle. That, of course would open up a whole nother can of worms. But our work does sort of quantify how much better things would be if you could safely incorporate a price oracle into your AMM.\\n00:26:31.602 - 00:26:43.520, Speaker A: I'm told there are already several groups sort of working on these ideas. They're definitely not new ideas to us, but hopefully this work does put these ideas on sound mathematical footing. So I think I'm out of time. Let me stop there.

Chris, thank you so much for coming on the show and sharing with us your sort of the history of intents.\\n01:13:04.050 - 01:13:05.778, Speaker D: You mean his intensity?\\n01:13:05.954 - 01:13:32.960, Speaker A: His intensity about intents. Oh, dear. But, yeah, no, thanks so much for sharing with us. And this is very helpful to give context to these ideas because I've known about the Noma project since its inception, but this idea of intense, even though I think we've even had it in ads on this show, I wasn't always clear on where this is coming from or what exactly you mean by that. And this has been really helpful to understand that.\\n01:13:33.270 - 01:13:57.254, Speaker C: Thank you. I hope it was interesting. And yeah, Tarun, we, you know, speaking here at Sonoma, we definitely owe you some good mathematical characterizations of some of these problems. So hopefully hoping that we can provide those and answer some of the very good questions around, like, what are the bounds for different efficiency classes of intent centric applications? I think that's a good one.\\n01:13:57.372 - 01:14:31.822, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I still think it is the right mental model, though, because I think it does get at this all the marketplaces that exist that people have apps for do kind of do this right. Like, you're never really saying a precise thing. You just get matched to something. And I think inevitably, any way of describing that makes sense. It's just more a question of, yeah, what does this look like in ten years? And it does feel like there is some actual new research to come out of that. So looking forward to it.\\n01:14:31.876 - 01:14:33.758, Speaker A: Cool. All right, thanks again.\\n01:14:33.844 - 01:14:34.526, Speaker C: Thank you.\\n01:14:34.628 - 01:14:41.970, Speaker A: And I want to say thank you to the podcast team, rachel, Henrik, Tanya and Jonas, who edited this episode, and to our listeners. Thanks for listening.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Episode 285 - Intents with Chris Goes from Anoma\\nchannel_name: Zero Knowledge\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBc3ck7p2Y\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-19\\n\\nRight. And that might be a way in which you can get specific kinds of efficiency or fairness guarantees. I think that's particularly important when dealing with fungible assets. Let's say a lot of the things people use uniswap or Cowswap to do today and might be for tickets or something like train tickets, hotel tickets.\\n00:41:12.094 - 00:41:31.602, Speaker C: These things are a little it's harder to define what a kind of fair price would be and maybe also a little bit less important because there is mev scalping. I don't know. There are weird things, but there's less immediate concern for exact best price execution in some batch.\\n00:41:31.746 - 00:42:02.802, Speaker A: I want to just go back. So we've mentioned sort of Cowswap a few times and when I started learning about this concept, cowswap was floated as like if you want to know how an intense system kind of works, cowswap sort of does that. But what is different from what they are doing and what you're like? Is there some sort of central actor in their system? Is it because it's including ZKPs that it becomes more interesting? Yeah, I'm just curious how you'd differentiate your new ideas about intents from what that is.\\n00:42:02.856 - 00:42:35.806, Speaker C: So Enoma really just aims to kind of generalize and protocolize the architectural problems faced by Intent centric applications. So Cowswap is already an intent centric application. They have users sign intents. They submit them to some kind of aggregator, I think, as far as I understand, like the last version of the system someone explained to me, so it could have changed. But the last version I understood, someone users submit their intents to an aggregator. The aggregator takes a batch of intents, then solvers compete to submit solutions for that batch. Right.\\n00:42:35.806 - 00:43:13.114, Speaker C: So Cowswap has built all of this extra infrastructure. They've built this aggregator, they've built this intent language, they built this kind of way to rank solutions from solvers. People have built solvers. And Enoma really just tries to build protocols that can handle many of those things without special cased intent systems for each application. So Cowswap has their own RPC API and own network for submitting intents. And Cowswap intents are calswap specific. They're not composable with intents of other applications, at least not easily, because they're kind of being handled by this separate network and sort of off chain execution selection system.\\n00:43:13.114 - 00:43:46.370, Speaker C: And Enoma tries to make things composable at the intent layer. Right. So you could have intents for one application and intents from another application and know in some cases they might not even be solvable unless you compose the applications. Right. Let's suppose that I want to buy a ticket but I want to pay in some different currency other than what the ticket seller wants to accept. Right.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Episode 285 - Intents with Chris Goes from Anoma\\nchannel_name: Zero Knowledge\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBc3ck7p2Y\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-19\\n\\nRight. So I think there's kind of a natural correspondence here.\\n00:21:19.100 - 00:21:28.706, Speaker A: Is there any intent stuff in IBC? Or would you say you shelved that for that project and then kind of came back to it know, it depends.\\n00:21:28.738 - 00:21:54.686, Speaker C: On whether some of the messages in IBC are kind of formally intense or not. Depends on how exactly you define the term and some of them might be. But if they're intense, they're not really user level intents. They're like protocol level intents, like subject to these conditions, update the state atomically on this other chain. Right. So yes, but not at the kind of holistic, user centered understanding of intents level.\\n00:21:54.788 - 00:22:08.950, Speaker A: I think it's probably a good moment to really define it and maybe define it as you define it today. I think you've just given us a really kind of nice human example of the Thai food lunch plans. But tell us your definition of intense today.\\n00:22:09.100 - 00:23:10.498, Speaker C: Right, so I want to give two definitions here because I think they're actually the two slightly different. So another reason why I think intense has recently become popular, and it's clearly not due to anoma because we've been talking about it for a long time and it never became popular. So I think credit for Intense becoming popular is much more due to kind of what you alluded to tarun, but that it's this kind of unifying concept or universal concept which is a great way to describe what many of these systems are doing that you can view from a lot of different angles. Right? So the first definition of intent I'll give here is the way that I think people use the word on Twitter, let's just say like in the discourse and I think there people use the word intents to refer to basically credible commitments to preferences over the state of some system, right? And what the system is. The kind of boundaries of the system vary. So someone might be talking about intents on ethereum. Then the system they're talking about is ethereum.\\n00:23:10.498 - 00:24:18.238, Speaker C: Someone might be talking about intents across all the ethereum roll ups. Like maybe Suave is interested in this then the system they're talking about draws boundaries around all the ethereum roll ups. Someone might be talking about intents in Cosmos or like some Cosmos chains and then the system they're talking about draws sort of bounds the system around these Cosmos chains. Right? But in particular, the first part of that definition credible commitments to preferences distinguishes intents from transactions in this useful way. Right? So intents don't specify an exact path of execution, right? They specify some executions of a system or some future states of a system which a user is, let's just say, happy with or which a user authorizes. That's what makes the commitments credible and then how precisely what exact path the system takes, what exact computations the validators execute or including solvers and other parties to get from A to B, let's say, is not fully constrained by the intent.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Episode 285 - Intents with Chris Goes from Anoma\\nchannel_name: Zero Knowledge\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBc3ck7p2Y\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-19\\n\\nAnd that requires standardization of more than what IBC standardizes. Right? It requires standardization of this privacy preserving VM layer. On top of mean, tyga is kind of relatively agnostic to the languages in which you write or something. You just need to be able to compile them circuits. So on top of that, you could have other VMs or other things going on.\\n00:51:55.390 - 00:51:59.026, Speaker C: But you do need to deal with your state in this way, if that makes sense.\\n00:51:59.128 - 00:52:45.620, Speaker A: Continuing on that topic of privacy, I actually had a question from before. I think it was like you were speaking about something earlier about kind of hinting at a Dex or a ZK swap. I think when you were talking about that, I started to know like two years ago. Tarun, Guillermo, you guys did a bunch of work and I think Alex did a bunch of work around these private DEXes. And some of the challenges when you get into these intent based systems. Is it a completely new landscape where we can start to really think about private swaps in a different way? Or are those problems that you had highlighted and this is also to you to in a little bit, but do they still stand in a system like this? The fact that you'd often have to reveal something in order for a proper marketplace, or at least in the way that we've thought about it in the past?\\n00:52:46.230 - 00:53:31.822, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not extensively familiar with that specific paper, but I think in general, intents don't intents are a way of designing an architecture and a way of designing, in our case, a virtual machine. They don't break any impossibility results or whatever. Someone needs to see enough information to combine the intents. Right, so that someone could be like someone inside an SGX. Right, or it could be someone inside Fhe, although I still think we're many years away from that. But some logical party needs to be able to see the intents and see at least the information about what the users want to trade so that they want to trade A for B and B for A in order to match them.\\n00:53:31.876 - 00:53:58.930, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't think this changes any of that. In some sense this gets more complicated because it's like non atomic, so you're in fact more likely to have these privacy problems. I think the key thing that people have accepted is that any financial transaction fundamentally has to have some public data, like a price and interest rate, a fee, and some private data at least like what people expect normally.\\n00:53:59.090 - 00:53:59.462, Speaker C: Right?\\n00:53:59.516 - 00:54:45.560, Speaker D: Like people aren't expecting to always be showing that they're making some transaction and the public data always has some information about the private data. And the key is just like allowing the user to choose how much they make public and then they get a price based on how much they give publicly. Right, because obviously if they gave all of their information, you could get the best possible price.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Are Intents, SUAVE, Account Abstraction, & Cross-Chain Bridging all the same thing? - Uma Roy\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-26\\n\\n00:00:10.220 - 00:00:53.112, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Uma, and I'm going to be talking about how cross chain Bridging account abstraction, Intense and Suave are related. And I promise I didn't just throw together four of the most popular things that people are talking about right now. There's some actually interesting connections. So to start off with, I want to talk about how did we at Succinct get here? So Succinct, we're a company, we think about the future of Bridging. And we started by thinking a lot about how current bridges really suck. They're all multi sigs, they get hacked all the time and they generally have really bad security properties. And so the thing we first worked on was ZK Snarks basically for improving security properties of bridges.\\n00:00:53.112 - 00:01:18.240, Speaker A: But that's not what I'm going to talk about today. I'm actually going to be talking about the future of Bridging UX, not the future of security. And so there will be no fancy ZK math. So I'm sorry about that. But basically the thesis is bridge security is broken today, but also Bridging UX is broken today. And I think a lot of people really acknowledge that. And so we're going to walk through basically fixing Bridging UX in four parts.\\n00:01:18.240 - 00:01:51.036, Speaker A: So part one is going to cover why does current Bridging UX suck? The next part is going to talk about maybe fixing Bridging UX with account abstraction. Part three is going to be kind of a defense of intents and why having this intent language is important and why account abstraction isn't enough. And then the last part is going to be about Suave.

Chris, thank you so much for coming on the show and sharing with us your sort of the history of intents.\\n01:13:04.050 - 01:13:05.778, Speaker D: You mean his intensity?\\n01:13:05.954 - 01:13:32.960, Speaker A: His intensity about intents. Oh, dear. But, yeah, no, thanks so much for sharing with us. And this is very helpful to give context to these ideas because I've known about the Noma project since its inception, but this idea of intense, even though I think we've even had it in ads on this show, I wasn't always clear on where this is coming from or what exactly you mean by that. And this has been really helpful to understand that.\\n01:13:33.270 - 01:13:57.254, Speaker C: Thank you. I hope it was interesting. And yeah, Tarun, we, you know, speaking here at Sonoma, we definitely owe you some good mathematical characterizations of some of these problems. So hopefully hoping that we can provide those and answer some of the very good questions around, like, what are the bounds for different efficiency classes of intent centric applications? I think that's a good one.\\n01:13:57.372 - 01:14:31.822, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I still think it is the right mental model, though, because I think it does get at this all the marketplaces that exist that people have apps for do kind of do this right. Like, you're never really saying a precise thing. You just get matched to something. And I think inevitably, any way of describing that makes sense. It's just more a question of, yeah, what does this look like in ten years? And it does feel like there is some actual new research to come out of that. So looking forward to it.\\n01:14:31.876 - 01:14:33.758, Speaker A: Cool. All right, thanks again.\\n01:14:33.844 - 01:14:34.526, Speaker C: Thank you.\\n01:14:34.628 - 01:14:41.970, Speaker A: And I want to say thank you to the podcast team, rachel, Henrik, Tanya and Jonas, who edited this episode, and to our listeners. Thanks for listening.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Episode 285 - Intents with Chris Goes from Anoma\\nchannel_name: Zero Knowledge\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBc3ck7p2Y\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-19\\n\\nRight. And that might be a way in which you can get specific kinds of efficiency or fairness guarantees. I think that's particularly important when dealing with fungible assets. Let's say a lot of the things people use uniswap or Cowswap to do today and might be for tickets or something like train tickets, hotel tickets.\\n00:41:12.094 - 00:41:31.602, Speaker C: These things are a little it's harder to define what a kind of fair price would be and maybe also a little bit less important because there is mev scalping. I don't know. There are weird things, but there's less immediate concern for exact best price execution in some batch.\\n00:41:31.746 - 00:42:02.802, Speaker A: I want to just go back. So we've mentioned sort of Cowswap a few times and when I started learning about this concept, cowswap was floated as like if you want to know how an intense system kind of works, cowswap sort of does that. But what is different from what they are doing and what you're like? Is there some sort of central actor in their system? Is it because it's including ZKPs that it becomes more interesting? Yeah, I'm just curious how you'd differentiate your new ideas about intents from what that is.\\n00:42:02.856 - 00:42:35.806, Speaker C: So Enoma really just aims to kind of generalize and protocolize the architectural problems faced by Intent centric applications. So Cowswap is already an intent centric application. They have users sign intents. They submit them to some kind of aggregator, I think, as far as I understand, like the last version of the system someone explained to me, so it could have changed. But the last version I understood, someone users submit their intents to an aggregator. The aggregator takes a batch of intents, then solvers compete to submit solutions for that batch. Right.\\n00:42:35.806 - 00:43:13.114, Speaker C: So Cowswap has built all of this extra infrastructure. They've built this aggregator, they've built this intent language, they built this kind of way to rank solutions from solvers. People have built solvers. And Enoma really just tries to build protocols that can handle many of those things without special cased intent systems for each application. So Cowswap has their own RPC API and own network for submitting intents. And Cowswap intents are calswap specific. They're not composable with intents of other applications, at least not easily, because they're kind of being handled by this separate network and sort of off chain execution selection system.\\n00:43:13.114 - 00:43:46.370, Speaker C: And Enoma tries to make things composable at the intent layer. Right. So you could have intents for one application and intents from another application and know in some cases they might not even be solvable unless you compose the applications. Right. Let's suppose that I want to buy a ticket but I want to pay in some different currency other than what the ticket seller wants to accept. Right.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Episode 285 - Intents with Chris Goes from Anoma\\nchannel_name: Zero Knowledge\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBc3ck7p2Y\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-19\\n\\nRight. So I think there's kind of a natural correspondence here.\\n00:21:19.100 - 00:21:28.706, Speaker A: Is there any intent stuff in IBC? Or would you say you shelved that for that project and then kind of came back to it know, it depends.\\n00:21:28.738 - 00:21:54.686, Speaker C: On whether some of the messages in IBC are kind of formally intense or not. Depends on how exactly you define the term and some of them might be. But if they're intense, they're not really user level intents. They're like protocol level intents, like subject to these conditions, update the state atomically on this other chain. Right. So yes, but not at the kind of holistic, user centered understanding of intents level.\\n00:21:54.788 - 00:22:08.950, Speaker A: I think it's probably a good moment to really define it and maybe define it as you define it today. I think you've just given us a really kind of nice human example of the Thai food lunch plans. But tell us your definition of intense today.\\n00:22:09.100 - 00:23:10.498, Speaker C: Right, so I want to give two definitions here because I think they're actually the two slightly different. So another reason why I think intense has recently become popular, and it's clearly not due to anoma because we've been talking about it for a long time and it never became popular. So I think credit for Intense becoming popular is much more due to kind of what you alluded to tarun, but that it's this kind of unifying concept or universal concept which is a great way to describe what many of these systems are doing that you can view from a lot of different angles. Right? So the first definition of intent I'll give here is the way that I think people use the word on Twitter, let's just say like in the discourse and I think there people use the word intents to refer to basically credible commitments to preferences over the state of some system, right? And what the system is. The kind of boundaries of the system vary. So someone might be talking about intents on ethereum. Then the system they're talking about is ethereum.\\n00:23:10.498 - 00:24:18.238, Speaker C: Someone might be talking about intents across all the ethereum roll ups. Like maybe Suave is interested in this then the system they're talking about draws boundaries around all the ethereum roll ups. Someone might be talking about intents in Cosmos or like some Cosmos chains and then the system they're talking about draws sort of bounds the system around these Cosmos chains. Right? But in particular, the first part of that definition credible commitments to preferences distinguishes intents from transactions in this useful way. Right? So intents don't specify an exact path of execution, right? They specify some executions of a system or some future states of a system which a user is, let's just say, happy with or which a user authorizes. That's what makes the commitments credible and then how precisely what exact path the system takes, what exact computations the validators execute or including solvers and other parties to get from A to B, let's say, is not fully constrained by the intent.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Episode 285 - Intents with Chris Goes from Anoma\\nchannel_name: Zero Knowledge\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALBc3ck7p2Y\\nrelease_date: 2023-07-19\\n\\nAnd that requires standardization of more than what IBC standardizes. Right? It requires standardization of this privacy preserving VM layer. On top of mean, tyga is kind of relatively agnostic to the languages in which you write or something. You just need to be able to compile them circuits. So on top of that, you could have other VMs or other things going on.\\n00:51:55.390 - 00:51:59.026, Speaker C: But you do need to deal with your state in this way, if that makes sense.\\n00:51:59.128 - 00:52:45.620, Speaker A: Continuing on that topic of privacy, I actually had a question from before. I think it was like you were speaking about something earlier about kind of hinting at a Dex or a ZK swap. I think when you were talking about that, I started to know like two years ago. Tarun, Guillermo, you guys did a bunch of work and I think Alex did a bunch of work around these private DEXes. And some of the challenges when you get into these intent based systems. Is it a completely new landscape where we can start to really think about private swaps in a different way? Or are those problems that you had highlighted and this is also to you to in a little bit, but do they still stand in a system like this? The fact that you'd often have to reveal something in order for a proper marketplace, or at least in the way that we've thought about it in the past?\\n00:52:46.230 - 00:53:31.822, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not extensively familiar with that specific paper, but I think in general, intents don't intents are a way of designing an architecture and a way of designing, in our case, a virtual machine. They don't break any impossibility results or whatever. Someone needs to see enough information to combine the intents. Right, so that someone could be like someone inside an SGX. Right, or it could be someone inside Fhe, although I still think we're many years away from that. But some logical party needs to be able to see the intents and see at least the information about what the users want to trade so that they want to trade A for B and B for A in order to match them.\\n00:53:31.876 - 00:53:58.930, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't think this changes any of that. In some sense this gets more complicated because it's like non atomic, so you're in fact more likely to have these privacy problems. I think the key thing that people have accepted is that any financial transaction fundamentally has to have some public data, like a price and interest rate, a fee, and some private data at least like what people expect normally.\\n00:53:59.090 - 00:53:59.462, Speaker C: Right?\\n00:53:59.516 - 00:54:45.560, Speaker D: Like people aren't expecting to always be showing that they're making some transaction and the public data always has some information about the private data. And the key is just like allowing the user to choose how much they make public and then they get a price based on how much they give publicly. Right, because obviously if they gave all of their information, you could get the best possible price.\\n\\ndocument_type: youtube_video\\ntitle: Are Intents, SUAVE, Account Abstraction, & Cross-Chain Bridging all the same thing? - Uma Roy\\nchannel_name: Research Day\\nvideo_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw\\nrelease_date: 2023-05-26\\n\\n00:00:10.220 - 00:00:53.112, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Uma, and I'm going to be talking about how cross chain Bridging account abstraction, Intense and Suave are related. And I promise I didn't just throw together four of the most popular things that people are talking about right now. There's some actually interesting connections. So to start off with, I want to talk about how did we at Succinct get here? So Succinct, we're a company, we think about the future of Bridging. And we started by thinking a lot about how current bridges really suck. They're all multi sigs, they get hacked all the time and they generally have really bad security properties. And so the thing we first worked on was ZK Snarks basically for improving security properties of bridges.\\n00:00:53.112 - 00:01:18.240, Speaker A: But that's not what I'm going to talk about today. I'm actually going to be talking about the future of Bridging UX, not the future of security. And so there will be no fancy ZK math. So I'm sorry about that. But basically the thesis is bridge security is broken today, but also Bridging UX is broken today. And I think a lot of people really acknowledge that. And so we're going to walk through basically fixing Bridging UX in four parts.\\n00:01:18.240 - 00:01:51.036, Speaker A: So part one is going to cover why does current Bridging UX suck? The next part is going to talk about maybe fixing Bridging UX with account abstraction. Part three is going to be kind of a defense of intents and why having this intent language is important and why account abstraction isn't enough. And then the last part is going to be about Suave. Lightly touch on it and basically argue that Suave is actually really important for UX. And so this is kind of like the outline in meme form. Okay, so yeah, let's just get into part one. Current bridging.\\n00:01:51.036 - 00:02:13.812, Speaker A: UX really sucks. Okay, so say I'm a user and I go to GMX on Arbitrum and I want to do some levered. Okay? So I connect my wallet.
