It is often discussed in the context of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and is relevant in the context of blockchain intents, L2 sequencers, and Layer 2 solutions.

These include searchers, order flow auctions (OFAs), block builders, privacy measures, data availability, trustless aggregation, security and trust assumptions, and resource intensity. Searchers actively search for and extract value from blockchain transactions, while OFAs facilitate the interaction between searchers and block builders. Block builders construct blocks and determine transaction ordering and MEV opportunities. Privacy and data availability are crucial for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the effectiveness of the MEV supply chain. Trustless aggregation aims to remove the need for trust, and security and trust assumptions are essential for the overall security of the MEV supply chain. The MEV supply chain is resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power, technical expertise, and financial resources.

It is the risk of losing value due to price imbalances between the AMM pool and the external market. Liquidity providers face the potential loss when arbitrageurs exploit the price difference by buying or selling assets in the pool, leading to a rebalancing of the pool. To properly incentivize liquidity providers and align their rewards with the level of risk, fee revenue should scale with leverage, which is influenced by factors such as volatility and volume. Reducing leverage can be beneficial for liquidity providers, and strategies such as dynamic fees and improved price quoting mechanisms can help mitigate the impact of LVR (source: research_paper, \"An Automated Market Maker Minimizing Loss-Versus-Rebalancing\" and youtube_video, \"LVR: Loss versus Rebalancing (Tim Roughgarden @ SBC '22)\").",

This ordering is important for transaction processing efficiency, prevention of front-running and back-running, and the extraction of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). L2 solutions typically use sequencers to collect and arrange transactions in a specific order before including them in a block or batch. Optimizing transaction ordering on L2s can improve transaction processing speeds, reduce congestion, and ensure fair and equitable transaction processing. Transaction ordering on L2s also follows the ordering on Layer 1 (L1) to maintain consistency. (Source: Ethereum Stack Exchange - \"How is transaction ordering determined in Layer 2 solutions?\")",

The purpose of MEV burn is to introduce a mechanism that redistributes the extracted value to other participants in the network, creating a more fair and equitable system. This concept has gained attention and discussion within the Ethereum community as a potential solution to address the issue of miners or validators underreporting the amount of MEV in a block to maximize their own profits. The implementation of MEV burn would require the involvement of a disinterested party, such as a proposal committee, to ensure the credibility and accuracy of the reported MEV value. The goal of MEV burn is to remove instability in block rewards and prevent incentives for equivocation or reorganization attacks, ultimately leading to more consistent rewards for validators.

It enables the integration of complex logic and additional features into an account, improving the user experience and expanding the capabilities of self-custody. With account abstraction, users have the ability to subsidize fees for specific transactions or types of transactions, authenticate users in different ways, and even implement governance actions with arbitrary logic. Account abstraction also allows for cross-chain operations, batched operations, and atomic or delayed operations. Overall, account abstraction enhances the functionality and flexibility of accounts in blockchain systems.

Account abstraction, as specified in ERC-4337, refers to the ability to create a general smart contract wallet with advanced validation and execution logic, allowing for the separation of gas payment from the user who initiates the transaction. On the other hand, intents are messages that express the desired actions or transactions of a user and can be used in the SUAVE protocol for executing transactions on L2 sequencers. Account abstraction focuses on the structure and functionality of smart contract wallets, while intents focus on expressing user actions and executing them on L2 sequencers.",

On Ethereum, making changes to the protocol to address MEV-related issues can be challenging due to the large state and the need for backward compatibility. However, on Solana, it is easier to unbundle the chain and have more control over MEV. Solana's design allows for faster changes and updates compared to Ethereum, and validators on Solana have more control and can enforce rules and constraints on the network to address MEV concerns effectively. Additionally, Solana has the potential for shared block space auctions (Suave) to mitigate MEV. [source: \"MEV and Ethereum's Future\" (Uncommon Core 2.0) panel discussion]",
