        "LLM_response": "L2 sequencers are responsible for receiving transactions from users and publishing a canonical sequence of transactions in Layer 2 (L2) systems. They order transactions based on their arrival time and provide a trusted and reliable ordering of transactions. L2 sequencers play a crucial role in the transaction ordering process and ensure the validity of transactions. They are often centralized but there is a move towards distributed sequencers in the future to minimize MEV extraction and ensure a fair and transparent transaction ordering process (source: Ethereum.org).",
