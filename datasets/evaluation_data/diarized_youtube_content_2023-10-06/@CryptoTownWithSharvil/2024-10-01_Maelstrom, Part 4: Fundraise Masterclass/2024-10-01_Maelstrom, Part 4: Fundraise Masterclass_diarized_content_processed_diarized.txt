00:00:09.280 - 00:00:15.497, Speaker A: When it comes to crypto projects, Right. I feel there are two, two products. One is the main product and one is the token in itself. Right?
00:00:15.561 - 00:00:15.737, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:15.761 - 00:00:33.405, Speaker A: And the token won't perform good naturally on its own just because your product is good. Right. You need to do like, some things which help the token as well. As investors, it's the GP's responsibility to give returns back to LP. So token returns become like huge important. So what are some points? What do you think would do well for tokens?
00:00:33.525 - 00:01:12.247, Speaker B: Yeah, I think just make sure, like token design is everything. Token needs to have utility. And I think that's like number one. Number two is the ecosystem partners you bring in. So when you do a round, for example, an investment round, just try to think who will be useful in helping hone the product itself, helping attract tvl, which obviously is not the best metric, but it's a metric and it's the one we happen to be using as an industry. How do you tell the story? And that's where we really come in handy, I think, is as investors, if you look at your cap table as a salad, that you need to have the lettuce, you need to have all the basics worth addressing, that we bring something that others don't. Yeah.
00:01:12.247 - 00:01:43.161, Speaker B: We may not have the resources of, let's say like a large fund, but we have Arthur's storytelling capabilities. That's very important, I think, and helpful to founders. And then we also have the fact that Arthur himself has built a profitable unicorn from scratch. He was out there and just like all the other founders at once, at one point in time with a pitch deck, asking people to listen to him and that they were. It was very early back then. It was probably a lot harder than it was than it is now. And he can relate with everything the founders are going through and can be very helpful with key decision points.
00:01:43.161 - 00:01:53.375, Speaker B: Given that he's done a lot, he's created billions of dollars of value and he gave people the playbook on undoes and also don'ts because there's some mistakes he made that he knows. I made this mistake, you shouldn't make the same one.
00:01:53.535 - 00:01:57.795, Speaker A: What are some things that are absolutely like a deal breaker when you're investing in a founder?
00:01:58.495 - 00:02:33.737, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I mentioned to you, right. Integrity, like anything that looks shady, anything I've heard from other people in terms of the founder saying one thing and doing other things, that is a huge red flag. It can be a deal breaker. Valuation for us, we're very valuation sensitive that like people come to us saying we're raising at 100 and the product's not even out yet. Are you raising just on tam? That doesn't really make a lot of sense because then everything is worth infinite, right? If you're just raising on tam, maybe you're raising on team. So there's some exceptions here and there, but like track record. But generally speaking, valuation for us is a deal breaker.
00:02:33.737 - 00:03:02.647, Speaker B: So if, if you don't have a good justification, I always ask people, right, like why are you, on what basis have you decided, have you picked this valuation? And often the answer is like a non answer and that's for me like a red flag. Okay. If you ever thought about this, just making up a number, but if there's a thoughtful number, numerically derived source for that number, then that's more compelling. But yeah, that's another deal breaker for us. We, I mentioned you, we do 100k to 250k checks. We aim for 1% ownership. So that means implies 10, 10 million to 25 million FTV.
00:03:02.647 - 00:03:03.167, Speaker B: Got it.
00:03:03.231 - 00:03:36.095, Speaker A: So I'm like a median ecosystem person, right? And you're an investor and often like we end up pitching to you guys. There are different settings in which you have to pitch, right? For example, there's, there's a party or there's like a conference or the other one is like the final fundraise call. Right. How do you like separate or what are the different kind of pitches that you find are the best in different settings? Because one mistake that I've seen everyone doing is you have just like the one same template of pitch and whether there's alcohol running everywhere and people are drinking, you still pitching the same thing or whether it's like the fundraise call is still saying the same thing. Right? Yeah, yeah. How do you look at it?
00:03:36.175 - 00:04:11.333, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think, yeah, I. At conferences and events that we throw you right, that often someone will just come up to me and be like, hey, can I talk to you for a minute? I was like, okay, yeah. And then they'll just give me the pre rehearsed elevator pitch. Yeah, that's. I agree with you completely. It's a bespoke model for each setting is probably going to serve those founders better also because it sounds like it comes more from the heart when it's okay, I'm in a party setting. So I, I'll just convey this in a way that demonstrates that I have an intuitive understanding and connection with what I'm building versus like just pre rehearsed thing and I just have to do it.
00:04:11.333 - 00:04:27.725, Speaker B: But I totally get it as I've never been a founder, it's way harder than what I'm doing, that's for sure. And I know that sometimes I feel like maybe this is my one shot. I'd say, yeah, don't view it that way. It's not your one shot. We if you're making something cool, we want to invest in it. We want to make money. So like we're incentivized, we want to leverage your efforts so we can make money.
00:04:27.725 - 00:04:41.685, Speaker B: So if it's a cool good deal, hit us up with just something light and authentic. And if it's not a setting where we can have a three minute discussion about the intricacies of your business model, then we'll schedule time to do it.
00:04:42.105 - 00:04:47.085, Speaker A: When a founder sends you their investor data room, right? What all documents, do you expect that?
00:04:47.465 - 00:05:28.065, Speaker B: Yeah. So if it's like an exchange, for example, we'll want to see transaction logs, right? We'll see monthly financials, we want to see org chart and the team entity structure, financial model of projections going forward just so we can understand what levers impact this business model. And we can see if we agree with that framework. They'll often be like a overview of the product, of course, but we want of course a demo. And if we want to dive in and use it ourselves often we ask for references as well. So yeah, it's like a mix of things. I.
