00:00:00.240 - 00:00:26.470, Speaker A: So you were a PhD candidate for cryptology. You were the research leader at Polygon. Now your co founder at awail. Right? Let's try to break down the art of being a researcher or a co founder of a project. That's so technical. What are some things that in the journey, you had to do to upskill yourself, and how do you keep upskilling yourself constantly? Because we're in a space where literally every day there's something new happening. Right.
00:00:26.470 - 00:00:27.930, Speaker A: So how do you keep up with.
00:00:37.250 - 00:00:44.706, Speaker B: I think mainly the journey, and I. And I keep saying that to my fellow R and D team as well.
00:00:44.778 - 00:00:47.778, Speaker A: Qedk, I met him. I love, love that.
00:00:47.914 - 00:01:48.102, Speaker B: So I keep telling them is that one of the core skills of a researcher is the ability to keep on learning. Right? Like, till, like, again, I regretfully spend lesser time right now reading stuff, but anytime that I get any time that I like, I keep having a very big reading list, and I keep going back to that reading list to kind of read stuff because there is no way that you know enough. And the moment you think that you know something, things just change. And that's the beauty of it, which means that you can challenge notions. You have the ability and you feel the authority to challenge, no matter who is saying what under the circumstances. Like you, if you are confident that you know what you're talking about and you have a good, logical framing around it, you can actually challenge the status quo, which is. Which I feel is very enabling, but at the same time, you just cannot, you know, rest on your laurels.
00:01:48.102 - 00:02:02.232, Speaker B: You. You have to keep on studying. You have to keep on reading new material. Whoever one writes, you will have your own opinions. Like, when you read something, you wouldn't agree, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't read it, just to understand the counter opinions as well.
00:02:02.296 - 00:02:08.520, Speaker A: Right. And what are some resources that you would suggest for devs or for people who are getting into research right now?
00:02:08.680 - 00:02:49.762, Speaker B: I think as a researcher, some things like Iser archive, those are the kind of pre print, like places where people upload their papers before even it gets published. Of course, there's a lot of chatter right now there. In terms of quantity, there is so much that you need to essentially filter, and it gets very hard, but then you can just, you know, look into a few famous venues and conferences that you. That really aligns with the kind of things that interest you and then keep looking at what. What was the latest edition, what got published there, and so on. So that's on the research side, on the dev side, I think some things like ETH research and. And those kind of.
00:02:49.762 - 00:03:16.654, Speaker B: I think right now, Twitter is somehow one of the richest sources of information, good or for bad, which is a bit chaotic. But again, you cannot get today, like, there's an information like overflow, and there is no way that you can get very good filtered information in any place. So either you have to do your filtration yourself, or you have to subscribe to something which is biased.
00:03:16.822 - 00:03:19.850, Speaker A: Another resource I'd like to add is the whale whiteboard series.
00:03:20.510 - 00:04:00.064, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there are a lot of good whiteboards. Like, for example, the one, the ZK podcast by Anna. Some of the, you know, the podcasts that are being happening right now, they are really, really helpful. Like, I have, of course, learned a lot from a few of those podcasts. Again, you agree or not? You should definitely listen to all these podcasts. The Whiteboard series, I think we got a lot of inspirations from the near Whiteboard series, which was done from a very long time. And, you know, these kind of, somehow something like audio sometimes is a little less elaborate.
00:04:00.064 - 00:04:08.040, Speaker B: And that's why we chose to have like a whiteboard session where we can actually go in deep, explain stuff. Go deep into one thing, right?
00:04:08.120 - 00:04:16.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Especially I've seen the manta with Victor one and the Polygon maiden one. Very helpful. Because the diagrams and the architecture, otherwise, you can't just say it without a whiteboard, right?
