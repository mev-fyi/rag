00:00:00.240 - 00:00:04.790, Speaker A: In BD, what we do is we always tailor the pitch according to the person who's in front of us.
00:00:04.830 - 00:00:05.410, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:06.030 - 00:00:23.334, Speaker A: Let's consider people building in different ecosystems other than polygon. I'll point out different ecosystems. And your pitch to a person building in that ecosystem, why should they leave that ecosystem and build on polygon instead? What is it that polygon has that that other ecosystem doesn't have?
00:00:23.382 - 00:00:23.638, Speaker B: Sure.
00:00:23.694 - 00:00:25.542, Speaker A: Yeah, first one. Solana.
00:00:25.686 - 00:00:58.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the problem is, if I say anything, everyone's like, oh, you're knocking. You're knocking other ecosystems. Like, ultimately, the pitch. The pitch has less to. I mean, I'll answer that in a second, but the pitch has less to do with what ecosystem they're in and more to do with what they want. So, like, I tell, this is how I always approach things. And I've told our BD people this first, like, many times, like, don't.
00:00:58.100 - 00:01:24.946, Speaker B: Don't look at, like, what you want to sell. Like, look at what, like, the dev actually needs. Right? So, like, the answer is, like, what do you, what do you want? What are you, what are you trying to do? Right. And, like, most of the time, like, what they're building is, is maybe some, like, a lower level, like, infrastuff. But, like, generally, you can assume it's some kind of Dap that they want, like, a lot of adoption on. Right, right. And so if you, like, work from that premise, then what you'll often understand is, like, they want to make sure that fees are low.
00:01:24.946 - 00:01:45.550, Speaker B: Okay, well, you can get that in the polygon ecosystem. You can either get it on Polygon, pos, or you could launch a. You could get on ZKVM, but it's not as low as pos. So you could launch, like, a CDK. Second, you're going to want something that ends up being fast. Right. And so, like, you can go to pos and you can get, like, very fast transactions.
00:01:45.550 - 00:02:29.170, Speaker B: Same thing on ZKVM, CDK. Ultimately, you want something that is, like, secure, and you can get that in all three ecosystems. But ultimately, the thing that distinguishes us from other ecosystems is, one, is that we build on Ethereum. And so when you look at Solana, the answer is, I think most people in the Solana system would agree that you are getting a more secure network in Ethereum. They would argue that it's not as performant, but you would get a more secure network in Ethereum. And so, like, at the base layer, that's the core thing that we want is, like, you're going to get that security. But then ultimately, like, what you also want, if you're an app builder is you don't want to be, like, impacted by other applications in any way whatsoever.
00:02:29.170 - 00:03:17.258, Speaker B: You want to be able to, like, have an application and use it. And this becomes, like, this is becoming, like, more and more true, right? And so, like, you don't get that in pos, you're impacted by everyone else. You don't get that in, like, ZkvM, but then you get that in CDK. So if that's, like, something that's important to you and you're building in, like, the Solana ecosystem, then what you're going to say is like, yeah, it would actually make sense to just launch a CDK. I don't have to, like, worry about any other application on the chain whatsoever. I don't have to worry about, frankly, anything because I'm in full control of that environment, but I'm still relying on the security of Ethereum, and so that's like, a much better spot for, like, apps to be at. But then there's, like, a scenario in which, like, I could talk to a dev and I could potentially reach the conclusion that, you know, for you, you can be, like, on Solana.
00:03:17.258 - 00:04:12.310, Speaker B: Like, sure, stay there. I still think, like, honestly, most of the time, if you're on Solana, you might as well be on Polygon Pos. Why would you want to do that? Well, you've got more tooling over there. You've got, like, the liquidity from, from Ethereum, and frankly, like, major exchanges that come into on POS, you've got a massive diversity of apps on Polygon Pos, but frankly, you don't have just no other ecosystem has it whatsoever. So I can see a world in which I'd be like, you know what? Solana would work for you. That's okay. There's just because of what we've built, and at least on the polygon Pos side so far, is that ecosystem is so broad and diverse that, like, if your application in any way wants to rely on the rest of the ecosystem, you've got more to rely on in the polygon Pos ecosystem than you get, frankly, almost anywhere else, including Solana.
00:04:12.310 - 00:04:43.972, Speaker B: And so you're probably better off being on polygon Pos. So which polygon protocol you use and how it compares to Solana just frankly depends on the developer and what their use cases. In some worlds, it's like, you know, Solana is going to be fine for you and, like, you can keep building there and like, hey, you already have devs who only know rust, then, like, okay, well, probably makes sense for you to like, stay there. But in other situations, like, and I think most there is something in the polygon ecosystem that makes more sense.
00:04:44.116 - 00:04:46.720, Speaker A: Got it. Avalanche.
00:04:47.380 - 00:04:50.840, Speaker B: I don't think, I don't view this, the analysis as being like that different.
00:04:51.660 - 00:04:55.172, Speaker A: Honestly, it's like identical avalanche, arbitrum Zk sync op.
00:04:55.236 - 00:04:56.324, Speaker B: Well, I think once you get, I.
00:04:56.332 - 00:04:57.356, Speaker A: Think there's a, once you get into.
00:04:57.388 - 00:05:39.304, Speaker B: The Ethereum ecosystem, things become different, right? So, like, when you, when you're talking about like Solana and Avalanche, like, to me, like, that discussion is the same. You can, they're gonna have different discussions, but I don't really care about their differences. Like, ultimately the difference with Pos is what, and CDK and CKDM is what matters, right. Once you get to like, the ethereum ecosystem, then things get, start getting different, right? So, like, then you start needing different differentiate between, like, are you talking about a system that's using like fraud proofs or like validity proofs, right. And the second you get into like a fraud proof discussion, like, first you talk about op proofs that are not life. It's that simple. I'll say it, optimism should not be called an l two.
00:05:39.304 - 00:06:03.206, Speaker B: It's literally that simple. It literally has less security than polygon. PoS, which is not an l two, though it will be once we upgrade it to a volume, but it's not right now. And so to me, that's like a very comical thing. But like, honestly, kudos to them. They did a good job of like playing the Ethereum ecosystem and they got to the outcome. That's good for them.
00:06:03.206 - 00:06:49.654, Speaker B: Arbitrum is different, right? Because like, arbitrum actually, they are good builders. They've built something that has like, fraud proofs. It works well. There's actually like a good system there. The question, though is do you want to go into the arbitrum ecosystem where they are betting on fraud proofs, and frankly, there is no viable path for them to go to anything other than fraud proofs. Like, they've shown no desire to do that. And like, the downside of being in that ecosystem is you are going to wait seven days if you ever want to escape the arbitrum ecosystem, like, you're going to, if you ever want to launch like an, any trust chain, are you ever going to have any kind of like cross chain transactions that are being done in like a very trust minimized way? Like, the answer is no.
00:06:49.654 - 00:08:03.070, Speaker B: And even if it does happen, you're going to wait like seven days for that cross chain transaction. So, like, you're going into an ecosystem that like, has frankly just taken the wrong bet on the technology, even though they've done a really good job with the technology that they have. So that's like the fraud proof ecosystem, right? Then once you get to the validity proof ecosystem, right? You're talking about like scroll, ZK, sync, Linea, and then you've got Polygon, CKVM, and like CDK. And ultimately over there, like, I think when you look at like, what the teams have built, look, they've all built systems that have sequencers and in most cases provers, and they work. The question then becomes, what's the difference between these ecosystems, right? And I think, like, big one is like, our ecosystem is just much, much bigger. And so you've got a big benefit from coming into the polygon ecosystem. Second is like, you have to look at like, do I want to be here long term? And when you look at, like, the prospects of each of them, what you see is like, Polygon has been a leader in ZK tech, frankly, ever since acquired Hermes and Xero.
00:08:03.070 - 00:08:50.010, Speaker B: Um, we have probably the best ZK researchers. I mean, there's a reason why everyone uses all or a part of like, Polygon, like ZK technology in their systems. And so obviously that's like a key player, because basically what that means is like, we get to stay ahead of others, and therefore the ecosystem gets to stay ahead of others. And that's very important when you actually, like, look at like, our roadmap, right? So, like, one of the biggest things that we're developing is kind of what we refer to as like, the aggregation layer. This is basically like the layer that is going to allow for interoperability between the chains. And this is going to be interoperability that's going to be like, probably sub 5 seconds. And so you can actually engage with like, real cross chain transactions.
00:08:50.010 - 00:09:39.030, Speaker B: So you can sit on one transaction, you never have to, like, worry about where the liquidity actually exists, right? Because you can pull it from another, like another chain. Now, this has huge benefits for, like, the chains themselves in terms of like, fees that they can generate. It also has huge benefits from like, a UX perspective for the users. Because honestly, if that was not going to happen, ultimately you would end up being like, hey, solana, avalanche. That's probably a better ecosystem if you're never going to actually have any of these chains talking to each other. And so being in the polygon ecosystem, when you compare it to ZK sync or you compare it to scroll. The fact that Polygon is the leader in DK technology already has this on this roadmap, and moving towards its development gives you a lot more confidence than if you're kind of working with.
