00:00:08.480 - 00:00:10.645, Speaker A: What is like the playbook of crypto bd?
00:00:11.545 - 00:00:31.107, Speaker B: Well, I think initially just starts with a really good product, right? Like Lido was easy to sell. Athena is incredibly easy to sell. I'm a very lazy person. Like, I'm like, I'm so lazy it is ridiculous. So I don't get out of bed unless I can easily do something. And when I see a product that's easy to sell, I go for it. That's the first thing.
00:00:31.107 - 00:00:57.469, Speaker B: The second is I think it's important to play the game. I don't judge anyone that much. But like I feel like if you're in crypto and you don't have an incentive program points something that would make it attractive initially, you're missing out because you're basically not. Imagine you're like a big company. You're like, my marketing department is going to be completely understaffed and under budgeted. Like that doesn't make any sense. Encrypted incentives are the marketing.
00:00:57.469 - 00:01:35.117, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people just avoid, especially dollar denominated asset products are like, we're not going to do any tokens, especially BlackRock. Like it's really hard to do that. So I think it's important to tap into crypto, you know, the incentives and stuff. And then I think creating certain hype on Twitter is there's a nuanced thing. Like there's the, there's the way that most people do it, which is you just do cheap shills and stuff like that. But what works better, I'll find is actually in depth conversations and disclosures of risks tend to work because people, okay, there's an actual product there.
00:01:35.181 - 00:01:48.271, Speaker A: Right. Getting money out of someone is like the most difficult part of it. Right? Like you really need to ace your pitch at the time. You must have like come across so many BD people or ecosystem people in the space were pitching. But like, they're probably like really bad at it. They really suck at it. Right.
00:01:48.271 - 00:01:52.415, Speaker A: What are like probably the three pointers that comes to your mind for like a perfect pitch?
00:01:53.475 - 00:02:17.099, Speaker B: Yeah, like, yeah, most, most of you guys suck balls. I have to say. I go to happy hours and you come to me selling that's just so bad. I could sell it better than you guys, but I'm not even that smart. Like I feel like what really lacks is like a bespoke approach. Like you have to understand what these people want from the get go. It's a lot of people just do the kind of the same pitch everywhere, everywhere.
00:02:17.099 - 00:02:21.331, Speaker B: You have to adjust it because it's like. It's like dating, I guess.
00:02:21.403 - 00:02:21.787, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:21.851 - 00:02:35.123, Speaker B: You don't go with the same thing to every single guy or girl. Right. You have to adjust the pitch a bit. Sales is exactly the same thing. Adjusted. And I always prioritize long term relationships over sales. I feel like first of all, I'm.
00:02:35.139 - 00:02:39.427, Speaker A: Like dating, but as I do, I.
00:02:39.451 - 00:02:58.995, Speaker B: Keep that for blue. But like, because I feel like a lot of people think this deal is so important, but it fucking ain't. Whatever you do now isn't as important as you think it is. I always prioritize long term relationships and I never push too hard. Like I come in. If you like it, great. If you don't, let's stick around and help each other out.
00:02:58.995 - 00:03:16.489, Speaker B: That is so much more a value additive to both people rather than. This deal is really important. I need to sell it. No. Whatever you do is not as important. Five years from now, you're not going to remember it. What you're going to remember is you're surrounded by friends and people that want to help you out because you help them out.
00:03:16.489 - 00:03:17.729, Speaker B: That's how I think about it.
00:03:17.817 - 00:03:29.881, Speaker A: Right. Since you mentioned. Right. A lot of people come to parties and just like have a shitty pitch. Right. What would you have? Like, what are. What's an advice for people who want to pitch in? Let's say a party or a conference setting versus like actually on call.
00:03:29.881 - 00:03:37.953, Speaker A: Right. Because I feel there are two very different things. Right. Not everyone, especially in a party environment. For example, the Arthur Race event. No one's. No one was there to like listen to.
00:03:37.953 - 00:03:38.289, Speaker A: Sh.
00:03:38.377 - 00:03:52.757, Speaker B: Listen. If you pitch me shit at the Arthur Hayes event, I'm fucking standing up and leaving. Okay? I don't give a shit who you are. If you're a billionaire or like the guy that walked in the moon, I don't care who you are. I'm standing up and leaving. I want to have a good time. So that's number one.
00:03:52.757 - 00:04:04.285, Speaker B: Number two. Yeah. I think if you're like a. Sometimes I just get really tired. You know, you walk into places and restaking points and I just want to stab myself. But I kind of go through it. But I'm just.
00:04:04.285 - 00:04:21.091, Speaker B: I'm just bitching that, by the way. Don't listen to what I'm saying. But I think the point is just say if, you know, the person reminds the recall what they're pursuing, what they want. Fine. Just start chatting and see if there's something there. It really be like dating, you know, like just flirt a little. Just.
00:04:21.091 - 00:04:28.139, Speaker B: Just have actually honestly just have fun. Like, just people see what they like and see how you can help each other out. That's how I think about it.
00:04:28.227 - 00:04:32.215, Speaker A: And what are some growth hacks that have been, like, really helpful for you initially?
00:04:33.635 - 00:04:36.715, Speaker B: For Athena particularly, or just anything just for your brand?
00:04:36.755 - 00:04:41.705, Speaker A: Now I feel like you've built a personal brand as well. And now there's Athena's brand that's, like, sort of coming together.
00:04:42.805 - 00:05:06.625, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like it's important to test boundaries. I like to test boundaries a lot on Twitter. Just 90% of the shit I write isn't real. Like, I don't believe the stuff I'm saying. I'm just testing you out, how sensitive you are to it. So I can see how much further can I keep pushing so I'm free as a person? I always prioritize my freedom of expression.
00:05:06.625 - 00:05:36.095, Speaker B: And that's why I think what helped me a lot is just to test boundaries and see where that limit is and keep pushing it. And once I find that limit, which tends to get pushed by a lot farther, by somebody like Arthur Hayes a lot, I can find myself a spot there where I can be free to be myself and not put in a suit and pretend like, you know, like, I'm just a business guy. I'm so much more than the business. Okay. So I think, yeah, just make sure your personality stays intact and you can be yourself. That's what helped me a lot.
