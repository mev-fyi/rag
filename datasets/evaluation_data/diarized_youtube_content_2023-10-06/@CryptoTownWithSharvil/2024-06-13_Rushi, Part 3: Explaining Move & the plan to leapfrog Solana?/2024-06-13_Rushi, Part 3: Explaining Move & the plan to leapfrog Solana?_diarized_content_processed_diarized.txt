00:00:10.240 - 00:00:12.734, Speaker A: All right, let's start, like, talking about movement, right?
00:00:12.782 - 00:00:13.198, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:13.294 - 00:00:20.174, Speaker A: So you describe movement as a network of move based modular chains, right? But before all of that, what is move?
00:00:20.302 - 00:00:38.136, Speaker B: Yeah, so move started from the DM project at Facebook back then. This was before, basically, with meta. Zuckerberg was like, we believe in the metaverse. We're going to go all in on the crypto thesis. This is like 20, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21. That era. And the Facebook team really want to do a stable coin on the Facebook app.
00:00:38.136 - 00:01:00.056, Speaker B: So imagine, like, you have money, you want to send to your mom, WhatsApp, you want to send to Facebook. Enon on Facebook. You can do that within the app itself. You have stablecoin there. So that was generally the thesis of DM Libre project. They realized they couldn't use the EVM because it just wasn't secure. If they were going to put a 14 year old's assets on chain or, like, a 64 year old grandma, it couldn't get hacked.
00:01:00.056 - 00:01:20.856, Speaker B: It had to be high throughput. But it has to be custom blockchain. So they choose EVM. They didn't choose Solana. They built their own vm from scratch called move. The thesis was VM and Libra, which is the same thing, want to build the fastest and most secure blockchain to Paris, Facebook. And then seC, when it went to production, was like, no, you can't do that.
00:01:20.856 - 00:01:46.614, Speaker B: Crypto sucks, and it still is going through all the regulations in the United States. And they struck down on it. It spilled into absinthe sui, which were the two main research divisions of Libra project. And both are still, like, try to figure out things. It's like the first year Solana, where the wall was horrible, the user experience, awful. There's no liquidity, no developers, really. So when people were saying, like, oh, move is dead or language is dead, I would say, look back at Solana.
00:01:46.614 - 00:01:51.240, Speaker B: Everyone said, solana is dead. And now everyone's like, oh, Solana's bullish. People will be surprised what happens with them.
00:01:51.350 - 00:02:00.684, Speaker A: Aptos and soy have been in the market for a while now, right? But arguably, you've done a much better job at, like, just pushing the move ecosystem. Right? What do you think has been going on with those guys?
00:02:00.772 - 00:02:12.220, Speaker B: I think, like, we work with Aptos. They're actually investors and turning around and, like, hacks off to Mo and Erie. I think, like, they really focus on what. They're good research. They're really good technical team. They're very good. This, like, Silicon Valley partnerships.
00:02:12.220 - 00:02:30.488, Speaker B: Blackrock. Blackrock. I don't announce anything here, but there's a lot of institutional partnerships coming to these systems. But I think one thing they need help with, frankly, is a community building approaching in a web3 native way. And I think that's actually more complimentary to app dos, where app dos can. They're better engineers than us. They're better like Facebook team than us.
00:02:30.488 - 00:03:03.418, Speaker B: They know how to bring in retail and institutionals. We're focused on the meme coin Dex. We're focused on like, how do we get people in CT talking about us? How do you get mind sharing crypticity? Because I think the one mistake that these DM programs started off with is like when they launched, they focus on Google Cloud, not the Dex. So as a builder in app DoS, early on, that was my big frustration. They weren't really caring too much about the ecosystem. Now they're doing a much better job. But back then, it was the focus on how do we Google cloud, on how do we get Amazon on, and didn't really focus on the random 21 year old builder.
00:03:03.418 - 00:03:17.830, Speaker B: So I think we're approaching it from a bottoms up approach, like being web3 native, being very crypto native, and bringing the g ten culture to move. And I think if we can bring that in combination with what app is doing, then you have the opportunity to make leapfrog, move over Salana.
