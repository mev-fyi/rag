00:00:00.160 - 00:00:14.950, Speaker A: If we were to do sort of like a quick masterclass on fundraising. Right. For like early stage founders. New founders who are entering the space. Right. Let's discuss the art of fundraising and what tips would you have for new founders? Right. First of all, when it comes to the deck, right.
00:00:14.950 - 00:00:18.462, Speaker A: What are some key important things? And an investment memo as well.
00:00:18.486 - 00:00:18.622, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:18.646 - 00:00:29.402, Speaker A: So what are some key pointers that they should definitely not miss outd?
00:00:29.456 - 00:01:11.350, Speaker C: So see, if you create the deck, there are two ways to create the deck. Either you're following the certain framework, and there's the framework that we use in the head of every investor. And if you miss any element of this, they will ask you, or you are becoming super creative and you make some kind of unique deck. So probably, like I've seen the deck is like, first slide, one sentence, second slide, one sentence. And you're like, who are these guys who feel that they have that much courage to pitch me the deck like that? So that's the way you're like a super interested.
00:01:11.390 - 00:01:11.566, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:11.598 - 00:01:41.898, Speaker C: Okay, so and then we are going to the traditional framework and it should be market. You're explaining the market, the potential of the market, the problems of the market. Then the solution that you provide. Then you explain your product, of course, less text because, you know, and especially lots of founders, they don't realize that you get on call with investors. I should look at this like this at the laptop, like, and trying to figure out the letters that they read and nobody will read it.
00:01:41.954 - 00:01:42.530, Speaker B: Yeah. Right.
00:01:42.570 - 00:02:20.154, Speaker C: So it's always like, graphic elements work the best. And especially when it comes to some like, you know, schemes and like graphics. That is something that you do remember. Because in general, what I want to understand and how it works and why it works. And then good thing to understand who are your clients. So and like, explain what is your business model, because again, market is very mature right now. So we have this traditional approach that we as an investor, it's not about like investing in some high base project.
00:02:20.154 - 00:02:26.484, Speaker C: It's about understanding what is the business model they have and what kind of revenue they could generate.
00:02:26.532 - 00:02:26.716, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:26.748 - 00:02:30.060, Speaker C: So, because if they generate the revenue, it means I can make money as an investment.
