00:00:08.480 - 00:00:26.944, Speaker A: As you mentioned, stablecoins. Right. And Dragonfly has invested in new age stablecoins like Athena and Aurora. Right. What is your thesis on these new stablecoins? Do you feel that the existing ones, like USDT, USDC, who have like the market share, like they're dominating, right. The giants, how will these compete and why are they required right now?
00:00:27.062 - 00:01:05.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, Athena is already the second biggest on chain stable coin in crypto linemaker. Right. It's just been, you know, an absolute amazing, you know, kind of first few months being live. Agora is a little bit different in that I see it more as like a USDC type competitor. So I'll mention the two of them, like, you know, a little bit differently. I think the reality is on the centralized stablecoin side is it's been a duopoly for a while. Tether obviously being kind of the first and been around for a long time, circle being around since 2018 or so.
00:01:05.780 - 00:02:14.960, Speaker B: And these markets or these companies have essentially dominated the market in such a way that they haven't had to adapt or evolve. And so tether is interesting because I think tether continues to be between 70 and 80% of the market, depending on the time, and has found just amazing product market Fitzhen, especially in emerging markets for trading use cases, for peer to peer payments use cases. So you see it with over $40 billion of USDT on TrOn being used in places like Southeast Asia and then emerging markets. Yes, a lot of these emerging markets. Exactly. USDC is interesting because, and I'm going to the risk of being kind of, I guess, bearish circle like they have in my mind, not really found like their niche because they continue to kind of try to go and have it the best of all ways. So they've tried to pitch themselves as a more regulated stablecoin, but they're not actually regulated in even the same way Paxos is.
00:02:14.960 - 00:03:30.920, Speaker B: If there is stablecoin legislation that were to require stablecoins to be a bank, JP Morgan, or one of these types of players would come in and I think really put a big dent in their business. And for things like trading use cases and payments use cases, they are starting. USDc is the most dominant stable coin on Solana and it's the most dominant stable coin on Cosmos and DyDX. But it's paled in comparison to the use case of USDT. And they haven't really adapted to things like sharing, have some revenue share with their customers. And so one of the things that Agora, I think, is doing really well, and I think will have a lot of, will be able to incentivize a lot of customers to use them over something like USDC, is that they have this model where they can do revenue share with their customers, and that they can do so in a better and more regulatory compliant way than someone like a circle can adapt to right now. We believe strongly that in that model, Agora is essentially adapting to the market and putting pressure on the market in a way that just hasn't existed for a while.
00:03:30.920 - 00:04:02.876, Speaker B: But also with the institutional packing needed for that type of stablecoin, with Vanek obviously being the entire back end there, Athena, totally different monster. There's an obvious need and use case for a on chain decentralized stablecoin. And there's also just obviously a lot of hunger for yield on chain. And bringing that basis trade on chain has clearly shown a lot of product.
00:04:02.988 - 00:04:09.170, Speaker A: But we've seen how that hunger for yield can go wrong with Luna and Terra as well. Right? So how do you address the risks associated with that?
00:04:09.260 - 00:04:43.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, listen, it's different. Right? So Luna and Terra, the UST, only was able to hold its peg if there was continuing new issuance. And you had to be able to incentivize that continuing new issuance. And the collateral that was continued to put into, like Luna was things like bitcoin. Right? And we saw this with, and we've been seeing this with the jump trial that's been going on right now, but I. They had to cut very big deals with these large market makers so that it didn't spiral out of control.
00:04:43.180 - 00:04:45.540, Speaker A: Then. Athena also added bitcoin as collateral recently.
00:04:45.660 - 00:04:45.916, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:45.948 - 00:04:46.892, Speaker A: So how do you look at that?
00:04:46.956 - 00:04:58.260, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So Athena is entirely different. Right. Because I can talk about the basis rate a little bit, but like, when you do a basis trade, right, you go long spot, you go short the future.
00:04:58.300 - 00:04:58.452, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:58.476 - 00:04:59.324, Speaker B: So you're delta neutral.
00:04:59.372 - 00:04:59.604, Speaker A: Right?
00:04:59.652 - 00:05:33.704, Speaker B: Right. You, because you're short the future, you're getting paid the funding rate, whatever that is, because the people who are on spot wanna or want to go long, they want to be lent that collateral. Right? So whether that's eth or bitcoin, you're delta neutral. Not. You're not just using bitcoin as collateral to be able to sell into the market when you know the token needs to be to repay. Right. And the concern around Athena has always been not does whether or not you can keep the peg during the basis trade while the funding rates are positive.
00:05:33.704 - 00:05:55.652, Speaker B: But what happens with the funding rates? And so the funding rates have actually gone negative the last couple of days for the first time. And we've seen, you know, slight deeps, but they've been very slight and been able to repay as either one, the funding went positive again, or you can sell down things like an insurance fund, and you can unwind the trade.
00:05:55.716 - 00:05:59.572, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it was deep, like 30 minutes, and it was just like at 0.97, correct?
00:05:59.636 - 00:06:41.528, Speaker B: That's right. And so the difference with the basis rate is that you can unwind it. You know, there's a lot of debate about how quickly you're going to want to unwind these things. But anybody who's been in a shop like golden tree or anybody else who's done this type of trade understands that depending on market liquidity, you're going to be able to unwind that trade within some reasonable time frame. And even if the annualized funding rate is negative, at some deep discount for that period of time, the actual total amount of loss, relatively small. And you can either one, socialize that risk, or you can two, put in an insurance fund. Athena is today topping up an insurance fund to cover people for that period of time.
00:06:41.528 - 00:07:16.810, Speaker B: But the likelihood of the funding rate staying negative for such a time that there is going to be some sort of long term peg issue has never happened before in crypto. Now there's black swan events and et cetera, and that's why you have a large insurance fund. But the type of thing we are talking about is something that would be so out of the realm of what has ever happened in crypto that, you know, you stop the plan for the black swan event. But it seems it's very unlikely that we would have a sustained deep.
