00:00:00.680 - 00:01:09.914, Speaker A: So as you develop your projects, you may notice every once in a while that if you try to get an airdrop from the dev network, it doesn't always work. This is because if you make a lot of requests in a row, it'll basically time you out and it won't let you do it anymore. So there is a way to get around this, and this is actually a way of testing your program that I encourage you to do regardless. So what you can do is create a local validator that you can run on your computer. And to do that, what you would do is type Solana test validator and then just go, and this is going to go ahead and create a local network for you, a local Solana node, and then these boxes you can go ahead and just close out. And so once this loads, you'll see it provides us with a JSON RPC URL. So we'll go ahead and copy that.
00:01:09.914 - 00:02:14.754, Speaker A: That's the URL that we're going to want to connect to. So if we go to our connection variable here, we'll go ahead and remove this cluster API, because we're no longer going to be connecting to a default cluster, we're going to be connecting to a custom connection. So in these quotation marks we'll put our local host and port, save it of course. And from there you can go ahead and create a new terminal by pressing the plus symbol here. Now I should note that we are using this on Gitpod right now, but if you are working in a local development, say you're using versus code, this will work for you too. So now if we go ahead and run our code by typing node index js, you can see it works perfect. So it's connecting to our local network, performing these operations and generating the desired result.
00:02:14.754 - 00:02:25.334, Speaker A: You can see we created our key pair, we airdropped. So if you encounter this error, no worries, just create this local network for yourself and you'll be all good to go.
