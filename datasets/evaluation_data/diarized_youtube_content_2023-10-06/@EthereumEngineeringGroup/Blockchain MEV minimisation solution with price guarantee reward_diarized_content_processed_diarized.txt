00:00:03.690 - 00:00:26.550, Speaker A: Hello and welcome everyone, my name is Peter Robinson and today we've got Babu here or Dr. Babu who recent PhD graduate and you're going to talk about your thoughts on mev and incentivization. So please introduce yourself a bit more and tell us a little bit about your topic and then please present your slides.
00:00:26.890 - 00:01:33.714, Speaker B: Yeah, as Peter said, I recently finished my PhD last year. Again my PhD was not on mev, my PhD was on cross chain and I was looking into some of the security areas of Blockchain as we work on blockchain then I came across this security issue in this mev causes some security issues in Blockchain. That's how I start looking into mev and this is where my research I just present my research and some of the challenges which I identified as well. So let me share my screen. Yeah, hopefully you can see my screen. Okay let's get this to the way. All right so the name I given is mev minimization solution with price guarantee reward.
00:01:33.714 - 00:02:37.302, Speaker B: So we will see the solution which I presented there for a challenge which I identified. That's the reason why this name is like that. I'm a lecturer at Southern Coast University and I do cross research with Griffith University. My PhD supervisors are in there so I do cross research with Griffith as well. Now what are we covering today? We will talk about mev, what is mev? Try to dive into that we will talk about some mev prevention or minimization solutions especially the one I am interested in is this PBS model. I think that is the one which everybody is sort of working on the PBS model right now. Within that there are many research challenges and one of the research challenges I identified and I propose an addition to address those research challenges.
00:02:37.302 - 00:03:38.170, Speaker B: So that's the topic for today. To get the context going. Blockchain transaction flow a user broadcast a transaction it goes to a main pool and minus pick those transaction order them and minus prioritize those transaction based on transaction fee in a picture form it looks like that we have many transaction 1234 but different prices going into this main pole and minor pick them and prioritize based on the fees because higher fees goes up, fees goes down. Is there any problem here? Right? Okay, that's what we're going to look at now. Transaction order dependency. Now, blockchain state update with each transaction. Each transaction the state of the blockchain update, the balance update.
00:03:38.170 - 00:04:31.514, Speaker B: Now there is this token trading and token transfer. This mainly affect in the token trading situation. In blockchain, how Token trading happens is through this market maker. So this automated market maker system where it makes up the market of how much token is worth for the other one, that is where this kind of transaction affects. Now in simple form, how it works is there is a pool of two different type of coins and it predefines the price of it and based on the balance of these different pools the price will change. So if there is less on the other side, the price will be higher for everyone. So that's how it works.
00:04:31.514 - 00:05:06.200, Speaker B: That's called the market makers. I'm not going detail into that one but the sense of that it is now in that kind of market making situation. For example, if a user make a transaction to buy a large amount of tokens and one other user so that user makes a transaction based on the price he can predict, so he can sort of see the balance there. See, look, that will be the price of that one. Maybe $10 or $5, $6. So that will be the price of that one. He will make that order there.
00:05:06.200 - 00:06:09.050, Speaker B: Now, adversaries can see that or anybody can see that transaction he making the order that comes in the adversaries. Simply what he can do is he can buy up that order that tokens beforehand. So say for example in this case the user put up 4000 tokens the adversary can buy up before that other transaction hits. So this is where that ordering of transaction make different. So the adversary can pay a bit more and make his transaction go first and he buy all the tokens or the majority lot of tokens in that pool. So what's going to happen is when the user's transaction comes in because there is not much in the pool, users will pay higher fee in there and the advisory can sell back that at higher fee. So this is where it affects the transaction in the flow.
00:06:09.050 - 00:07:26.690, Speaker B: Now, there are different type of attacks or different type of form of things out there. Either the front running, back running and sandwiching front running is where somebody can buy up before you so they can push their transaction before you and then they buy up that the back running is the other way around they will sell once you sell that they will sell that drops your price down and things like that happen. The one we are mainly interested in here is or we're talking more about here is Sandwich track where I send a transaction to buy. Say for example, in this case, transaction three is my transaction which I am buying thousand dollars, thousand tokens. And this three prime is an advisory transaction where he comes and buy before me that affect the tokens on my price. That means I will pay higher fee because he bought most of the tokens and there is less token in that pool so I pay high fee and then straight after that he will sell his token with that high five fee and this is what he makes. Now, what is mev? Mev is initially started as minor extracted value.
00:07:26.690 - 00:07:58.890, Speaker B: This was originally figured out by miners. And miners were extracting this value because miners can see the transaction in there. Later on, there are a lot of different actors came in because there are not only miners. Anybody can sit there and look for this transaction and they can extract this value. So later on the acronym changed to maxima extractable value. Recently I saw a paper, they're talking about blockchain extractable value as well. I think maximum extractive value is mostly used terminology.
00:07:58.890 - 00:08:52.234, Speaker B: Mev is that value, that difference value a participant can extract within the system being in a privileged position or in the privileged position by placing the transaction in an order where it benefits them. Now users when they send a transaction to the network, especially in this trading scenario, they do not predict, do not know exact value of the coin. So it may be $5, it may be $10. So they cannot say that exactly, okay, I'm happy to buy this for $5. They can say that. But because of the pool balance situation when that transaction hit the network, price may be vary. So their transaction will be invalid and they still have to pay the transaction fee.
00:08:52.234 - 00:09:43.902, Speaker B: So the way it works is people send transaction to the network, users send transaction to the network and they will say look, I'm happy to pay five to $10 for this code and that is to accommodate the variation in the trading variation in that this is called slippage and this is what the MAB. So users create unintentional MAB. This is a part of the trade. They wanted to get this coin, they wanted to buy this. They intentionally create this MAB, privileged participant in the network. So as the miners or people can have a full view of the network, they can make profit of this mev. And it is sort of first base who get it first.
00:09:43.902 - 00:10:22.454, Speaker B: They extract it and goes like that. Now, this is the one, I got it from the internet. The amount of values that has been extracted from as mev is lot. It's a huge amount of value that has been extracted during the last. Now MEB risk and benefits. So what is the risk here? Of course the first risk is financial loss for users. These are the values which user should be getting, but it has been lost.
00:10:22.454 - 00:11:14.858, Speaker B: Now I should be buying that coin for probably $6 or $7 in the natural market situation but it has been pushed down to the maximum. So it is that extra money I'm losing which is somebody else benefiting. That's a financial loss of users. Consensus instability. So there are situations where there has been mev sitting in the past block where miners will tick for that block and then they extract the block by reordering the transaction, reordering the block. That is the situation of consensus instability, validation centralization. Now, the amount of value which extracted through mev is a lot.
00:11:14.858 - 00:12:12.014, Speaker B: It's a huge amount of value. So the miners or the validators can quickly be rich and they can buy up equipments or they can stake and buy up the staking part so it is a big risk there. Now, the benefit part of it is this kind of trade happens in many networks and all this network have its own way of making the market, making value. So if there is in one network the token value is token pool amount is less then the value of that is high and in maybe some other network it may be high. There is a lot of token in the pool so that is less. So in that situation somebody can buy from the pool there is a lot more and bring it here. So that actually makes the balance, the market balance that's a benefit there.
00:12:12.014 - 00:13:04.474, Speaker B: So for example, Unisope and OpenShot that's a good one where the token price will be balanced between different networks. Now, what is the goal here? We would like to minimize mev as much as possible. I don't think we can avoid mev. Mev will be there but we will try to minimize mev as much as possible and provide fairness as possible. Fairness is a property where in the context of users users in the transaction but they don't have a say on where their transaction will be landing on. It is decided by the miners and again what factors decide that it is the fee attached to that one. Now in the mev case it's not really the fee.
00:13:04.474 - 00:14:05.490, Speaker B: There are two values that the miners try to extract. There is fee but there is mev. So in most of the cases mev is a large amount so they will go for that. So we'll see how somehow we can bring the fairness as much as possible. Now users, as we discussed before, users unintentionally make this MEB and how can they benefit from the MEB that they generate. Now one of the proposal for that is called proposal builder separation PBS model and this is the architecture where we are separating the block building and the block proposing the mining part within the core Ethereum protocol. This research is mainly happening on the Ethereum network.
00:14:05.490 - 00:14:52.900, Speaker B: Now, what we have previously is we have users and we have miners. So users send transaction to the miners and the miners pick the transaction, put them into block and then they propose the block. This mainly two actors in the network. In the PBS architecture we have users and we have a builder. The builder's job is to put together the task action. They order the task action in the way it is benefit for users or builders that will come to that once the builders order the block and the proposal propose the block. The way it works is the proposal doesn't know what is builder built at the beginning and like that but at high level the architecture looks like that.
00:14:52.900 - 00:15:36.110, Speaker B: Now, one of the key weakness what we can clearly see here is a builder centralization. The builder can see us transaction what is in it and they can extract Mev there. That's one known limitation or weakness here. Now to get there, we have gone through many different models. Mev Kit, mev Boost and the PBS model. So this is all being done by a research team called Flashpots. As part of their research, they developed separate algorithms and separate blind for that one.
00:15:36.110 - 00:16:19.370, Speaker B: That's how they done it. Now getting through this Git model. So users how does it works is users send a transaction I think I'm losing some parts here. Okay, I'll explain from here. Now users send their transaction privately to a relayer and relayer collect all the transaction and then they bundle them. Right? Now what is the benefit here is in before users send a transaction to the network, the public main pool. So say for example, if I wanted to buy say 1000 it I send a transaction to the main pool.
00:16:19.370 - 00:17:18.986, Speaker B: The whole world can see the transaction. Everybody is after that I will pay $5 fee and somebody else will come say look, I will pay $6 fee and somebody else come on top of that and $7 fee. It just keep going on, keep going on. So at some point there were lot of transaction network, I mean lot of transaction network where this kind of war between different people or ports to capture NAVs. In this situation users are sending this transaction privately to this layer pool where they can see and they order the transaction in a way that it partly may be benefit user partly maybe benefit layer. So they have different actors called searches will search in that, participate in that and they extract MAV in there. And then they send that bundle order in where transaction go to the miners.
00:17:18.986 - 00:18:03.600, Speaker B: And the miners put them in the block that it was started. And when they implemented that all of a sudden the transaction fees came down, all this congestion came down. It was kind of working. Then after that they propose this Mev Boost where they introduce another actor called builder in between. So user send a transaction to the builder and again the builder will put the block together and builder will give the block to a relayer. And the relayer will option that to a validator. This is the proof of state model validators and validators will pick from one of the older will pick the pick from that layer and then they work on that.
00:18:03.600 - 00:18:46.666, Speaker B: Now later on the PBS model is the current research happening where the builder will do the same role. The builder will build the block and builder will auction it to the validators. Now how it works is the builder will build the block and builder will only reveal the block header to the validator. Then say look, have this block and this is a value within the block, do you want it? And the validator will accept or reject. Once validator accept the block, the builder will reveal the body to the validator. And from at that point the validator won't be able to reorder or don't be able to reject the block. That's how the combination is.
00:18:46.666 - 00:20:14.694, Speaker B: I just want to skip through this one because there were some actions happening here it is happening so it is user flashboards explained here. Now in the current post merge it was user send it to the builder and builder and validator are connected to the layer. Any questions so far? We'll come back to that if there are some possible research direction the separating the building and the mining that's a good one. The PBS model proposed builder separation looks makes sense to us in this situation the builder create the block content order the block and the proposer propose approves the block. Now one important thing for us to understand is the blockchain works in an incentive scheme. Every participant are incentivized to participate in the system. Now some research challenge in here we know that the PBS model help in producing mev and some fair ordering system.
00:20:14.694 - 00:21:00.600, Speaker B: We will be able to achieve that one. But in this model this builders and the miners I should change that to proposer it should be changing. The builder and the proposer need to trust each other. These are the two actors they should work together in order for the transaction to be approved. So they need to trust each other. Now the incentive scheme is the weakest one here. Now I will explain how the incentive scheme currently proposed is the user send a transaction to the builder and the builder build the block and the builder will say to the proposer saying that look I got this block, you want this block and this block has this much value in there.
00:21:00.600 - 00:22:20.430, Speaker B: Now the proposer will say okay yes I will take that block and there is a reward for the builder to give the proposer a good block. There is a reward for that and the builder will once the proposer accept the block the builder will release the body to the proposal and the proposer will propose that block and then the reward will be paid back to the builder. So this is the adjustment between or the trust between builder and proposal where the builder has to trust that the proposal will give them reward and the proposal will trust that the builder will give them a good block and that block could contain MBB. Could not contain MBB. It's not really predictable that how much it is there. That kind of trust should be there. And in the case of proposal proposer has got a slot in say next slot and proposer will approach and a builder approach the proposal saying that he has a block and the proposal say look I'm going to take this block.
00:22:20.430 - 00:23:18.304, Speaker B: Now builder has to release block very quickly because the proposal slot is very quickly there. If the builder didn't release the block very fast as in the time or delayed then the proposal actually lost that slot. So in this case there is no reward for the builder to release the block. There could be a delay in there. Now, how can we minimize a trust assumption between different parties in this model? That's what I was looking at. So this is where I thought of having a new price reward scheme to protect the user's interest. Now, technically when I send a transaction to the network saying that I am happy to pay ten to 15 slippage, I'm happy to pay the whole amount that's technically we are happy to pay the slippage.
00:23:18.304 - 00:24:24.640, Speaker B: That's what I was expecting. Now we can design a system where I'm seeing the slippage but there is a reward for getting a lower slippage. So we need to design a reward scheme. If a user get a minimum slippage, then a percentage of the slippage he's saving will have to go back to the builder. So the PBS model price reward can help this new model. The block builder will get the minimum slippage margin what he's making because blockbuilder is the one he's proposing. So he can see what is slippage where it is and instead of he tried to extract the slippage, he will try to minimize the slippage where if he minimizes slippage he will get the person.
00:24:24.640 - 00:25:18.408, Speaker B: So block builder will get the reward for minimizing page and the miner get the reward for transaction fee. So this is all the assumption that all the MEB has been extracted, there is no MEB comes out, it's all being gone through this builder model. So the idea is to incentivize block builder to retain the value the user's interest and get them the minimum page. I'll take you through this one. So user send a transaction. So in this model what I would see is users have a bigger transaction so there are many builders and users can go and ask different builders look, I have this transaction, how much you are quoting me? Some builders say I got two percentage slippage or three percentage. The builder will promise a price back to him.
00:25:18.408 - 00:26:10.404, Speaker B: The builder can make the promise based on the current price. Builder can see what is in the pool or he can also see where are different pools and he have a visibility of what is in there and this transaction could hit in the network in the two minutes or three minutes. So builder could say okay, based on all these statistics, this could be the price winner hits. So I can offer this guy this price, okay? And the builder will come back and tell the user look, I'll give you this much saving on this slippage and then whatever slippage is saying you will give me a reward back. So that's arrangement here. So builder users can go and pick whichever builder either he echo and pick a builder which he trust. The builders can make over time, builders have accumulated trust transcriptions, and then builder users will pick those trust builders.
00:26:10.404 - 00:27:02.284, Speaker B: Or users can go and pick the builder, which is quoting very less. That's up to the builder users to decide on that one. Now once the builder got the block then he will have different users transaction comes in and he will build the block. Getting maximum saving to the users and he will build the block. And same way as PBS model currently he will auction that block to the proposal and saying that I got a block here, now you want that block. The proposer as I said before the proposal builder that there should be a connection between them not in the way of trust because the proposer has a slot the builder has to release a block and that has to be fast. There are lot of builders there and there are a lot of proposals there.
00:27:02.284 - 00:28:21.940, Speaker B: Proposal will pick the builder's block based on some trust assumptions they built or the fees what is in there. So the builder will auction that same way before to the proposal proposer pick the block and once they pick the block the builder will release the body that is the time where the proposer can see the body but he can't do anything, he can't reorder anything. He will put together the he will approve the transaction and all those things happens and once the transaction is approved blocks everything done. Then the builder get based on how much slippage the user saved the builder get the percentage in that one and the proposer get the other rewards and everything so that's how that model kind of works. Now, there are mainly three properties I've identified that kind of addresses this one now block withholding. Now, this was the property I was talking about. The builders can withhold the property withhold the block, and there was no reward for them to release a block very fast because in this model, the builder made a promise to the user based on the current price, every second count for it.
00:28:21.940 - 00:29:16.752, Speaker B: So as soon as a proposer accept a block, it is builder's interest to push that block to the proposer and get it accepted very fast because it is based on the price. He predicted that it could change anytime. So there is a push from the builder to get that to run. So there is no incentive for builder to hold back the other way. The builder is pushing that back to be done there. Now the second property is a trust minimization. Now in this case they do not need to trust each other on paying them right? So builder get its own payment, the proposer get its own payment, they don't need to share any payment and once the proposer accept a block if there is no fees then he may not pay none of this drama will be there, both of them will be paid separately in that one and lastly fair ordering.
00:29:16.752 - 00:30:06.870, Speaker B: Now here users have a say, users can increase their percentage to say that, look, he can buy the fairness, can say, look, I'm happy to pay more percentage on the mev I'm saving, so he is able to buy more fairness in that sense. Now, in conclusion, what we look at is is mev good, bad or illegal? Not sure about that. But there are good part in mev, there are bad part in MBV. Can know mev is going to be part of trading system because that's how a lot of trades are going to work. But mev exploitation is not really fair. That's not really what we wanted to do. Now, this PBS model aimed to solve part of that.
00:30:06.870 - 00:30:26.356, Speaker B: Now I think with the price reward scheme attached to the previous model, we'll be able to make the system much more better in the space of NAV. Now, that's all from me. Yeah.
00:30:26.398 - 00:30:31.020, Speaker A: So are there any questions? Is the thing that you're wondering?
00:30:34.420 - 00:30:39.248, Speaker B: Yes, hello.
00:30:39.334 - 00:30:53.140, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you, Babu, for sharing. I'm Lekilao, I'm also doing the same physics. And you started a PhD also in MUV minimization.
00:30:53.720 - 00:30:55.172, Speaker B: Well done. Okay.
00:30:55.226 - 00:30:55.830, Speaker C: Yes.
00:30:57.660 - 00:31:13.964, Speaker B: I'm sure because my diving into this different PBS model, not sure I have gone enough or the things I raised are not much valid. But I'm happy to get some criticism on that one. If some of the things is not.
00:31:14.002 - 00:31:29.890, Speaker C: Really I'm happy to share some of my thoughts and my research. So one of the things you didn't mention is two things you did.
00:31:36.720 - 00:31:38.110, Speaker B: You'Re breaking out.
00:31:46.240 - 00:31:49.310, Speaker C: Is the moving.
00:31:50.280 - 00:31:59.830, Speaker B: Maybe it's not. Is it me or.
00:32:04.120 - 00:32:05.264, Speaker A: I can't hear lucky.
00:32:05.312 - 00:32:08.230, Speaker C: Unfortunately is true.
00:32:08.920 - 00:32:10.260, Speaker B: Lucky we can't.
00:32:14.120 - 00:32:15.870, Speaker A: Lucky maybe.
00:32:17.680 - 00:32:18.204, Speaker B: At the.
00:32:18.242 - 00:32:20.190, Speaker A: Moment we can't really hear you.
00:32:20.800 - 00:32:22.620, Speaker C: Yes. Moving the profit.
00:32:24.800 - 00:32:25.820, Speaker B: The prophet. Yes.
00:32:25.890 - 00:32:28.750, Speaker C: So that they another government.
00:32:35.720 - 00:32:36.592, Speaker B: How frustrating.
00:32:36.656 - 00:32:42.310, Speaker A: Lucky we had you for a SEC there and it was golden. It had been breaking up. Breaking up and then it was good.
00:32:43.640 - 00:32:54.170, Speaker B: I think he's talking about mev smoothing. I remember I heard about this mev smoothing thing, but I can't recall what was it, but really interested to look into.
00:32:55.500 - 00:33:13.170, Speaker A: So lackey maybe get in contact with me directly and maybe we can slot you in in a month or two's time to present what your literature review has shown. Because I know just even in the literature review part of a PhD, you learn a lot and can probably tell us a lot.
00:33:18.180 - 00:34:09.504, Speaker B: Ron has put a hands up. Ron, hi. Yes. I'm just wondering if I'm a miner and I have the alternative of mining the mev myself and participating in this system, what's the incentive for me to participate in the system? I think the assumption is here, after some time you will not be able to most of the mev goes through the PBS model goes through there. So the bigger transaction, all of them will only go through mev. Only go through this proposal builder model where you will not have mev lying around in the main pool bigger transaction. So you're saying that the users are going to say I'm not going to send my transactions directly into the mempool, I'm going to go through one of the builders? Yeah.
00:34:09.504 - 00:34:36.350, Speaker B: Okay. That's what the assumption is. You can throw in the bigger mev and that's the same way people will be fighting for that. It's going to be the same. But the assumption here is if you have bigger transaction you will send through some builder. Okay, thanks. Yes Frank, thank you for the talk.
00:34:36.350 - 00:35:24.270, Speaker B: So adding builders and miners and so on, it adds another layer of intermediaries I would say. So what is the impact in terms of latency or resources as well? You share with lots of different people. Yeah, I don't think it may much difference in there because it's going to be on different layers and everything so it will be fast and they're looking at this PBS model to be integrated into the ethereum in the next one. So this is how it is going. There is no other way we can go with that here. Okay.
00:35:24.340 - 00:35:26.960, Speaker A: And I think we've got Roberto with a question.
00:35:30.070 - 00:35:43.270, Speaker D: Thank you for the talk. I just want to ask would you able to explain again why with the MEB price model you proposed build there has no incentive in the block.
00:35:46.330 - 00:36:43.230, Speaker B: In the one. So my understanding is the builder is paid by the validator or the builder put through the block and builder isn't paid by the validator because what we have is only the block. Either the fees or the block reward is incendi which is coming out right now. That only will be given at the end to the validator. When the validator validates the thing, he will get the fees, he will get the block reward, then he has to pay back the builder for giving him the block. That's how I understand the payment system works. There is a payment system works.
00:36:45.200 - 00:36:56.800, Speaker D: Thanks. Why with your proposed model the builder has no incentive in withdrawal block. How do you solve this problem?
00:36:56.950 - 00:37:50.640, Speaker B: Yeah. In my proposed model, the builder has another incentive so validator, there may be a scheme where Valderator can pay back. But what I'm morely proposing is go back to here. In the builder case, the builder will put together the block, right? And builder can see all the mevs in there and he will put together the block in such a way that user is going to save mev. So if I send a transaction to the network, I'm buying 1000 coins. And then I say, look, I'm okay with 10% slippage. And if you save me with 5% slippage, you know, then the the 5% I'm saving within the saving, I'm going to pay you back.
00:37:50.640 - 00:38:13.050, Speaker B: I'm going to give you that so that's including that so builder is going to be paid by this savings from the mev from different users. And that will be paid to him. And the proposer will get. The other proposal, the fees and other things, he will get it. Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:38:13.660 - 00:38:21.390, Speaker D: Just another question. When does the builder get the payment? At which point?
00:38:23.120 - 00:38:24.350, Speaker B: Sorry, say again?
00:38:24.720 - 00:38:27.310, Speaker D: At which point does the builder get the payment?
00:38:27.840 - 00:38:40.290, Speaker B: At which point? So once the transaction is completed, that's a point. We know that, okay, this was a slippage at that time and this was the price, and then that much he saved. So that's at that point there.
00:38:42.760 - 00:38:59.592, Speaker D: All of this needs to be baked into the ethereum. Layer one. This whole protocol is not something that can be applied on top of ethereum, it's something that must be embedded into the ethereum trust, correct?
00:38:59.646 - 00:39:14.190, Speaker B: Yeah. So wherever this previous model is going to be embedded, that's where it's going to be embedded. Either can be L2 or layer one. I'm not sure about that at this stage, but wherever this PBS model is going to be embedded, that's where this can go as well.
00:39:17.760 - 00:39:19.520, Speaker D: Do you have a paper on this one?
00:39:19.670 - 00:39:21.490, Speaker B: Yes, I do have a paper on that.
00:39:23.460 - 00:39:25.170, Speaker D: If you have the link, you can.
00:39:26.580 - 00:39:32.100, Speaker B: Yes, please get in touch with me, I'm happy to discuss further from there. Christopher.
00:39:34.200 - 00:40:04.270, Speaker E: Hello. Thank you for the talk. Really interesting stuff you mentioned. Sushi, swap and uniswap. I have some experience with those two exchanges. I guess if the current slippage standard is like 15% and you said people are willing to pay that on average, obviously they want to be able to buy into these tokens. My experience in particular is with BSc, where there's been plenty of network issues, you've had to set your slippage to 20%, 30%.
00:40:04.270 - 00:40:30.548, Speaker E: If this kind of guarantees that they're going to be paying those higher end slippages, would you not just be incentivizing the block builders, they're now going to be advertising the slippage percentages right. With the PBS solution, would they not just advertise higher and higher slippages because they're going to be getting the difference from that? They're going to be making money the higher the slippage is. Correct?
00:40:30.714 - 00:40:47.068, Speaker B: Yeah. But they are not making the slipage up because it is coming from the protocol. Right. So they are publishing, but it is coming from the pool. So based on what is in the pool, they're publishing that. Okay, so whatever is in the pool, only they can do. If a pool slippage is high, they.
00:40:47.074 - 00:40:53.976, Speaker E: Can'T do much in, they can't artificially advertise a higher slippage, they cannot advertise.
00:40:54.088 - 00:41:13.990, Speaker B: What they can do is they can change the pool coins to make the slippage out, but they can't advertise it because it's coming from the pool. Right, got you. I don't think they have in this model, the builder don't have any control on the pool. That all stays as it okay.
00:41:16.040 - 00:43:01.700, Speaker C: The problem is they can reorganize the transaction so that they can increase the slippage. So the problem with this reward schema is it doesn't really solve the problem in the case of they can get the same reward with or without your reward because as long as it's the same slippage allowance, the transaction can go through. They can get this by front running, they can change the slippage, they can have the just in time liquidity and all sort of these different way. They could still get the reward from the slippage, doesn't really necessarily taking the reward schema. But I do understand your approach and it's similar to my approach. It's introducing a Dutch option on the price that it's currently doing on the calf I protocol sulfur and a one inch fusion order with sulfur so I'm currently running both sulfur and with sulfur on Calfi and one inch and that also will be part of my physics. It's a similar approach but it is with the Dutch auction that the Mev board no longer attacking the user but competing to settle the order and then that way the user can be benefit from the competition that is more bought and can be solved the order on chain with a better slippage.
00:43:02.460 - 00:44:19.784, Speaker B: Okay interested to see I also thought about having there is nobody stopping the builder from extracting the maybe but there is one thing could be possibilities where there is a handful of builders there and then the builders will eventually build up a credibility. And if I send a transaction with this builder and he saved me a good slip page, then that is where I built the thing. So this kind of credibility builders built and that will be one point where they get more transactions. So if I build the credibility I have more transaction coming in then I don't need to extract mev otherwise I can build enough profit from that saving mev set. So if I don't have much transaction then I only let getting less transaction I will only get percentage from that one. My intention as a builder is to attract more users and giving them less slippage that way I have more customers. More customers means it is better for me because I have a pool of lot of pool of things.
00:44:19.784 - 00:44:35.420, Speaker B: So I built the trust there. That was kind of trust model I have thinking about right, any more questions?
00:44:38.510 - 00:44:46.426, Speaker A: There were some questions or some discussion in the chat but I'm not sure if they're answering their own questions a.
00:44:46.448 - 00:45:17.266, Speaker B: Bit yeah right if any of these things are not answered please bring it up we can discuss why don't you.
00:45:17.288 - 00:45:21.122, Speaker A: Flip to the last slides? Did you integrate those last slides in?
00:45:21.256 - 00:45:24.100, Speaker B: No, I'm sorry, Peter. I didn't couldn't do.
00:45:28.870 - 00:45:31.030, Speaker A: I'll find them. Don't worry.
00:45:33.210 - 00:45:47.900, Speaker B: I've been put into this. We are participating in this CBDC pilot project with the RBI. So I'm in that committee and I'm heavily into that. So when you just send me a reminder, I just thought oh, we had to do the talk.
00:45:48.750 - 00:45:52.522, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it's good that you're into.
00:45:52.576 - 00:45:53.180, Speaker B: The.
00:45:56.210 - 00:45:58.094, Speaker A: Helping advise on that.
00:45:58.212 - 00:46:02.510, Speaker B: Definitely. We are in favor of CBDC now because we are working for RBA.
00:46:03.730 - 00:46:06.720, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, here we go.
00:46:08.370 - 00:46:08.830, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:08.900 - 00:46:10.400, Speaker A: So what I'll do.
00:46:12.470 - 00:46:13.602, Speaker B: Copy that from.
00:46:13.656 - 00:46:35.580, Speaker A: That computer to this computer and it's just going to magically work. Start from the beginning. No, that was the wrong one. Present as view. All right, close that so you don't have to see a whole heap of Immutable stuff. Right. Share my screen.
00:46:35.580 - 00:46:41.290, Speaker A: And of course, I don't have the sharing access set up. Bummer.
00:46:42.670 - 00:46:42.986, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:43.008 - 00:46:49.038, Speaker A: You know how all right, open System Preferences. Is it going to let me do it?
00:46:49.204 - 00:46:50.462, Speaker B: Yeah. All right.
00:46:50.516 - 00:47:22.850, Speaker A: And then I'm going to need to race over here. All right. And then it says quit and reopen. All right, so believe me, there are more talks next, but not next week. We've got a week off and then the following week we've got Barnabay, who's from Ethereum Foundation. And it's going to be, I think, something like 05:00 p.m., Brisbane, but it's about PBS as well, but his thoughts on where the future is going with it and what's coming over the horizon.
00:47:22.850 - 00:47:33.206, Speaker A: So, Lecky, given you're doing a PhD on this, you might want to catch that one live so you can quiz Barnabay live. And with your obvious interest fabu, I'd.
00:47:33.238 - 00:47:41.040, Speaker B: Suggest coming email to I send a message, lucky, please connect and we can discuss some.
00:47:43.890 - 00:48:29.690, Speaker A: Yeah. And then in two weeks time after that, I'm down for finally getting around to doing my solidity inline assembler talk and showing you how to jump from one function to another function without doing a function call. So essentially hyper spacing between functions in solidity. And I've only just started a new job, so I've started a job as head of Blockchain Research at Immutable. So, as you can imagine, I'm a bit busy, but I think I'm going to aim to do that because that's like four weeks away. So that's heaps of time. Week after that, we've got Philip Zetner from Lefi, and he's going to talk about bridge.
00:48:29.690 - 00:49:27.502, Speaker A: So having aggregated bridges, so that's where you've got a bridge and underneath it, you've actually got, say, half a dozen other actual bridges, so not just relying on one bridge. And he's actually going to say that maybe this is what should be used generally and not just say, for value transfer. So Lefi does value transfer at the moment, but he's going to state the case for just general purpose messaging as well as being part of that. And then we've got Leo Lau, he's going to talk on the 3 May about automatic market makers. So he's going to take us, I think, from Nothing to Multidimensional AMMS and all sorts of really cool stuff. So for those people who like a bit of maths or people who like a bit of DeFi, that will definitely be a good talk. So, anyway, Barbu, thank you again for delivering a talk.
00:49:27.502 - 00:49:46.600, Speaker A: And I reckon you're going to have to be able to come up with a great topic for late 2023 or early 2024. So we can have you on again. So thank you very much for your talk today. We should all give you a clap and the virtual claps as well.
00:49:48.250 - 00:49:48.774, Speaker B: All right?
00:49:48.812 - 00:49:54.060, Speaker A: Are there any final questions for Babu before we close the call?
00:49:56.190 - 00:49:58.886, Speaker E: Did you post a link to your paper in the chat?
00:49:58.998 - 00:50:14.350, Speaker B: Okay, there you go. All right.
00:50:14.420 - 00:50:31.190, Speaker A: And I'll put that link into the YouTube notes as well. YouTube description. And Barbie, if you can get the PDF version of your slides to me, then I'll be able to post a link to them from the the description as well.
00:50:31.340 - 00:50:32.280, Speaker B: Okay. Correct.
00:50:32.730 - 00:50:36.198, Speaker A: All right, thank you, everyone. Talk to you two weeks time.
00:50:36.284 - 00:50:37.570, Speaker B: Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.
