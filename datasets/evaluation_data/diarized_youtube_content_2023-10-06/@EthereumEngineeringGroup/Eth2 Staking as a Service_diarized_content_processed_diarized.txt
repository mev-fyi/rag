00:00:03.450 - 00:00:17.790, Speaker A: Hello and welcome everyone. This is the Ethereum Engineering group meetup, I'm Peter Robinson and today we've got Lekki here who's going to tell us all about e two Staking. So before you jump in and start presenting could you please introduce.
00:00:20.790 - 00:00:55.138, Speaker B: Yeah sure, yeah. Thanks Peter. Hi everyone. Nice to meet everyone here. My name is Lekkilao, I have been doing software engineer for more than ten years. Has been worked for traditional software company top 500 like IBM, Telcha, Fujis and also being a Zero entrepreneur since 2016. Joined the D five 2016 and has been more hands on smart contract development for the last two years.
00:00:55.138 - 00:01:22.140, Speaker B: Has been worked for Instadev, Dhedge and synthetics. So recently just left synthetics to work on my own project and it's about Ethereum staking service. So would like to share more about that area. We'll be more high level on the talk so that hopefully everyone can understand.
00:01:22.910 - 00:01:30.910, Speaker A: Yeah that sounds really great and I know I'm looking forward to it. So please present your slide.
00:01:32.770 - 00:03:20.494, Speaker B: Sure. We'll talk about Staking as a service shop or SAS and also touch a bit about the merge which has been talking about for years and finally is more likely to coming middle of the year. So we'll talk about some background on the if one that they also renaming to sorry they renamed on the if two. So if one is the same if one is proof of work consensus and then the problem is it's a slow speed full put and transaction per second that is 12 seconds and then energy inefficiency it caused like loss of electricity energy and then it's difficult to contribute, upgrade and maintain. And then also highly centralized hash power as on the right hand side it's majority on spark pool and Ethermine. And then when the miner I also have a mining rig in my garage. So in order to have more reward I just simply choose the big one.
00:03:20.494 - 00:05:11.170, Speaker B: Like if a mine as that way I can get more reward as they was basically in a big pool so that once they got the mine the block they will split the reward to everyone. Yeah and then if two has phrase zero launched December 2020 so it has been running for more than a year. So currently it become POS the consensus layer that need to stay 32 e for a validator. Last year actually year 2020 that it was like $400 but now it dropped a bit to 2000 but peak time was 4000 which would cost a lot to spin up one validator. So there's a bit of overhead and then on the other side is more technical overhead to set it up as need to run the consensus layer client and after merge there will be also execution. Client in comparison for the POW you just buy the graphic card or buy the mining rig and plug in the power and then it connect the wallet and can start mining. Yeah the third one is once the eva got deposited, it's hard to withdraw or being liquid but that's a general pain point or problem for all the POS network.
00:05:11.170 - 00:06:15.846, Speaker B: That's why the liquid staking is general solution for the POS chain and then low Issuance. Low Issuance is the current problem. We'll talk about more detail later. On the right hand side we can see the majority is unknown which is this is a pie chart group by deposit address. When people deposit so unknown, basically the one that their deposit address not being recognized and then you can see the other one will be exchange. So exchange still a majority and then there's 30% others and state fish that's also like some sticking surface solution. And then Lido is about 10%.
00:06:15.846 - 00:07:33.966, Speaker B: That's the largest liquid staking that has the highest TVL, like more than 3 billion in the liquid stake industry. And then underneath the Lido there are just some providers that's selected by Lido like partnership. So Lido's Validator is like a selected nodes that they choose. So this is Ethereum Roadmap published by Vitalik like a few weeks ago. So the left hand side is just capturing the top. The merge part from the right hand side and how to read this roadmap is basically everything in parallel and then the green part means how far it has complete. So currently today we just focus on the first one, the merge.
00:07:33.966 - 00:08:56.890, Speaker B: And then as you can see, the testnet is like halfway. It's already tested that the merge is working on the testnet. So they just need more tests and then they can deploy and you can see the distributed validator demo is done. That's the one that with the merge and then they will have the deployment and then after merge there's a post merge which is there, it will enable withdraw. Okay, so if to ultrasound money, that's like a meme worth that I think created by Justin Drake, but not sure this is more I heard from his talk from the bankless. If you want learn more detail, you can watch the bankless show the talk with Justin Drake. So the ultrasound money, from my understanding, is what he talked about.
00:08:56.890 - 00:10:06.866, Speaker B: Is there's a sound of the money? Like a goal is when you hit it with another goal, you have like a clear sound. And then when you hit a coin with another coin, you have a sound of a coin. And then they're talking about what will be the sound for ethereum. But basically what they mean ultrasound money is when the burning rate is higher than the issuance rate so that it will become deflation and that's when ultrasound money ah, let me move a bit. Okay, so this is a chart I get from the watch, the Bun watcher. As you can see, currently it has burned one point million. Revolt is 2.2
00:10:06.866 - 00:11:17.494, Speaker B: million eva net issuance is 685,000. So we want to talk about the net production is 70% so when the 70% become 100% so that's where burn rate over issuance rate and that become ultrasound money at the top it just talk about on Ethereum One. So currently on Ethereum One the issuance is 4.5% issuance rate with two eva per block and an additional 1.75 eva per uncle block. And then on the bottom right we have the if two issuance rate. So currently we have 9 million eva stated out of 119,000,000 eva circulating.
00:11:17.494 - 00:12:10.090, Speaker B: So that's around 7.85% has been stated. So the maximum issuance rate is zero point 54%. So as you can see in comparison, so the actual one I will have for the slide after it's currently like 0.4. So if you compare 4.5 reduced reduction after the merge reduction to like 0.4 to five, that means more than 10% issuance rate reduction so that will most likely the net production will become 100% so that most likely will become ultrasound money after the merge.
00:12:10.090 - 00:13:21.120, Speaker B: Um, yeah, this is a historical supply and issuance rate. So back to 2016, we have 14% issuance rate and then it keep dropping and then the supply keep growing. So currently the supply is 119,000,000 eva and then it can see like the percentage currently is 8.9 million stated and then it's like 4.5% and then after the merge it would drops to 0.4.5. So as you can see that's a huge reduction for the issuance. It may be a problem with low issuance but as long as it's more decentralized it should be fine.
00:13:21.120 - 00:14:48.982, Speaker B: Okay, this network dashboard, I grabbed it from Oppo Tech. This is built by Oppotech Technology. As you can see on the top right the network issuance is zero point 39%. So this data is they have a spreadsheet and then it get it real data when you refresh. So this is like one week ago like the total valid data and then they calculated everything like a real time data and then it gets the network issuance to zero point 39%. And this is also from the calculator that with the state stating eva, the more eva stated on if two, it's actually higher network issuance rate but as you can see it grows like really slow like zero point 39, 0.4 and 0.5.
00:14:48.982 - 00:15:58.158, Speaker B: So as you can see it will still be more than ten times reduction on the issuance rate after merge and this is a calculator on the reward side. So currently if two will have two reward, one is the current consensus layer reward is at 5% at the moment and the more eva got stated the lower reward it will get. So it can drop to 3% or 2% when staking rate more than 50%. Currently with staking rate is 7.85 and on the right hand side you can see that on the top right that the staking reward was 5.27% and then there's a fee reward 8.21%. So that's the mev fee that comes in after merge.
00:15:58.158 - 00:17:55.730, Speaker B: That basically the transaction fee that can get collected after merge and that's from their calculator is 8.21% so that comes in total with all will be 13% and then they minus some cost so it become 12% so 12% POS we war with ethereum POS staking which is quite low risk but relatively high return. So these are some of the the current if two staking service solutions. So the co phi from the consensus is validated as a service on the API solution. So basically you can see one is obviously the exchange that they just stay and then they do everything but it's like highly centralized. And then the other solution is like self running red data which is required, you have some technology to run the client and there's also like pre configured where data nodes they configure that you can just buy and run but you still need some knowledge to maintain it. One will be you need to upgrade like there's a patches, there's a box and there's a version upgrade that you need to run the upgrade also like to manage the storage as the storage will keep growing.
00:17:55.730 - 00:19:24.514, Speaker B: Currently on the POS site is not much, but there's a saying when post merge, you need to run the execution client. And that's where the gaff coming. Like you need to run the gaff and then that would take like two terabytes on the storage side. Validator as a service is more like enterprise solution as semi custodial we'll talk about more on the staking pools as that's the one I been working on. So this is another surface comparison. So currently mostly custodial and semicastodial even you go through the pools it's still custodial as both more just in comparison of a Lido and rocket pool that's the one that I have researched the most. They were using a deposit pool.
00:19:24.514 - 00:20:37.530, Speaker B: So the custodial way is when you put in the eva, it's all collected in the deposit pool and then you spin up the validator after work in batching and then for lido they just batching 32 eva getting from the deposit pool. And then for rocket pool has similar but they take 16 from one side for the validator side and 16 from the public micro pool side. We can talk more later as well. Yeah, we talk about more on the staking pool run. Yes. So mainly just this is a Lido validator on the Beacon Chain so you can will this is a public information in the Explorer on the Beacon Chain Explorer. So as you can see, to spin up valid data, you need 32 eva and then on the Lido pool, the deposit side, it just have 32 eva from address.
00:20:37.530 - 00:22:01.720, Speaker B: It's just Lido 1234. So basically they just batching to spin up validator and getting the 32 ether from the deposit pool. And then this is example for rocket pool. So rocket pool has been developing for years but they recently launched to mainnet two months ago and their success is by reducing the overhead from 32 Ether to 16 but from address is the same because they are still doing a deposit pool that still batching the valid data afterward. But they have successfully getting more than 100,000 Eva in one month and also getting more than 10% validator nodes across the network with this success with half a reduction. So next one is the one I work for. Currently I work for the Swell network, the side project I'm working for but now it's a full time I work for.
00:22:01.720 - 00:23:08.090, Speaker B: So we're using atomic transaction. The benefit is that's how you can see all 32 Ether like where they come from all on chain data that you can see the from address is from different user. So all the user is a direct depositor and then on the left hand side you will see all the address would be tagged by ether scan as if to depositor and that's the main differentiator between self running redditor. As a direct depositor against you running for a service provider. As a service provider. Usually going for a deposit pool so that the direct depositor is the service provider. But for us you know, that where your money coming from and into which validator so you can watch the validator performance and everything is on chain transparency, decentralized and noncustodial.
00:23:08.090 - 00:24:16.942, Speaker B: Next we'll talk about a little bit about SSV. So the SSV secret share web data was designed by Ethereum Foundation and then there's two companies working on it. One is box app, one is Ovotech and then SSV, this is a testnet so it's a side chain. So what's SSV? SSV is a side chain sharing the validator private key by four parties. So on the left hand side you will see this validator is running across four operator by sharing their validator private key. So on the right hand side you will see even one operator go down. As long as other freeze up you can still get attested.
00:24:16.942 - 00:25:44.220, Speaker B: So it's a protection for slashing by sharing the validator private key. So that way we can enable third party validator to be still collecting the 32 ether on the micro pool and still putting like one Eva like lower the overhead from 16 to one. So basically why would choose 16 Eva is because the maximum slashing will be down to 16 and your balance will not lower than 16, it will just exit. As you can see there's a gray exited state so if you have a slashing penalty your balance will keep reducing and then once it hits 16 it will force it to exit. So that's why rocket pool has choose to 16. But with the SSV protection side chain that we're planning to integrate we can lower the overhead to one Eva because of the sharing the web data priority that can still ensure they are in good health. Yes.
00:26:06.810 - 00:26:39.950, Speaker A: Thank you. Let's go through the questions first. So maybe we'll take them in order that they were put into the chat. And so the first one that I had was so you said that the current return rate is going to be 5% or something. And so what happens if, say, deposit interest rates in banks go to 10% or more than 5%? And so people aren't incentivized to stake money in ethereum.
00:26:43.910 - 00:27:33.322, Speaker B: That's a good question. But the bank is centralized. It may have a bank run maybe potentially, I'm not sure. So bang run will be one potential. Another thing is it's a centralized as there can be recall, like the transaction can be recalled and the transaction is not fully transparency or your account can be blocked. If some like money, could the Ethereum.
00:27:33.386 - 00:27:46.920, Speaker A: Community say hey, we need to do a hard fork so people are incentivized to say increase the return to match what people could get outside. Is that going to be possible, do you think? Or is that going to be really hard?
00:27:48.170 - 00:28:37.398, Speaker B: I don't think so. The reward will keep reducing. The reward is to encourage more decentralized with more operating nodes and the more stated eva, the more nodes the less reward. Which makes sense. And the way half of is only like there was a discussion on half four last year that the miner disagree on the transition on the POW transition to POS. But the Ethereum say we'll just half forward it and then people will follow us. But the way they see half of is not about interest.
00:28:37.398 - 00:28:49.900, Speaker B: It will be more like fixing bugs or have one consensus or something more technical, more than just interest rate.
00:28:51.230 - 00:28:57.530, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. So the next question was put in by Sandra. So Sandra, do you want to talk about mev?
00:28:59.790 - 00:29:00.154, Speaker B: Yes.
00:29:00.192 - 00:29:15.234, Speaker C: So it's just that leki I thought you mentioned something about mev payments at the time the merge and I didn't quite get understand the context or the relevance of that statement. Can you just expand a bit on that?
00:29:15.352 - 00:29:59.678, Speaker B: Yeah. The simple way to understand is just transaction fees. So currently the transaction is still happening on if one on the POW execution layer. So that's why the current if two consensus layer only 5% return but after merge. So what merge is basically the execution layer to transition from POW to POS. So that means the execution client will run on if two. So that means the MGV basically transaction fees will be collected on the if two as well.
00:29:59.678 - 00:30:23.480, Speaker B: So that is a variable way return. But according to Oppo, tax calculation is around 8% at the moment. So that's the collecting like a minor fee in a way.
00:30:27.950 - 00:30:31.370, Speaker C: Mev that's the maximum.
00:30:34.190 - 00:31:18.470, Speaker B: Value, minor extracted value. So that's the value that the miner get and that's getting from the transaction fee that the user pay. So when you submit a transaction you need to pay the gas for the transaction and they collect it to the minor. Of course there's a burning rate. It's really high. Currently the burning rate is like 80% burning rate but there's still some tips for the miner to collect.
00:31:20.970 - 00:32:01.158, Speaker C: The other question was not really a question I had, it was more a comment. It's just that apparently SSV is better known lately they decided to call it distributed validated technology just to not confuse with the SSV dow yeah I mean my confusion with mev is that as I understood it, mev is all about sort of front running, back running and sandwiching that whole feature there. But I see the way you position it. It's talking about the payment of yes.
00:32:01.324 - 00:32:24.320, Speaker B: That'S also terminology using there. Yeah the minor extractive value is using for both case you're right, it's using for both also sandwich and also it's basically everything the miner can get the return from. So that's like a turn in general.
00:32:27.570 - 00:32:58.300, Speaker A: Manipulating ordering, so manipulating the transactions maybe to try and get more value out of them. All right, so those were the questions in chat but I suspect there may be other questions. Are there other questions? And I'm going to ask Richard because Richard McKeown is on and I know he was going to run a e two staking service at one point. So Richard, did you do that? Are you able to talk?
00:32:59.390 - 00:34:04.080, Speaker D: Hi Peter and everyone. Yeah, we have a couple of validator nodes running still and yeah, we've gone through various sort of issues but yeah, no it's going quite well. Storage seems to be the main thing we've got to keep on top of and alerts that once it runs out of storage. But yeah, look we're running it internally with a view to looking at maybe from an enterprise point of view doing it. So yeah, very interesting to see all the variations of the pooling and the yeah so yeah economics wise it seems to be fine but we just need to see how it goes and follow it as we go along. Really.
00:34:04.850 - 00:35:07.010, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So currently the platform is to help we do a smart contract to help paying on the protocol layer to help the staker to map with the validator. So, like, the validator like yourself can spin up a validator with 16 or even down to one eva, and then you can have other eva from the staker on the micro pool to spin up. So that way can increase to scale up the validator nodes or operators to be more nodes on the network so that the if two network can be more decentralized and it's more easier for people to spin up validator. So the goal is minimum one eva and then 32 people can spin up a validator.
00:35:12.630 - 00:35:33.260, Speaker D: Yes, I know we're still monitoring it. It's definitely a technical feat. It's not something that I think I couldn't do it on my own, put it that way. So I do need the guys with the infrastructure and it knowledge to do it.
00:35:37.630 - 00:36:04.290, Speaker A: I know we're going to have a talk soon about the actual merge. So it feels like there are going to be multiple terabytes of solid state disks needed and probably some extra compute needed to be ready for the merge. I don't know. Lekia, you were saying you're getting ready, did you, and adding two terabytes worth of storage?
00:36:05.370 - 00:36:38.270, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the plan for post merge. Yes, because that's for running the execution client. So that's the gaff. I'm planning to use lighthouse on the consensus layer and then gaff on the execution layer. It seems to be more stable. You need to have that for the execution layer.
00:36:39.410 - 00:37:20.220, Speaker A: Yeah, it should be interesting to see. I know within consensus, I saw someone mapping out all the possible combinations of consensus layer and execution layer. I get the feeling that when we actually get there, there's going to be a much broader set of combinations than there currently is. Like, at the moment, I think there's a lot of the market Is geth and maybe Besu and others have only a smaller percentage of the market. But I think there's a good possibility that we'll have lighthouse and running and others running. And I think that'll be interesting to see.
00:37:21.970 - 00:37:36.640, Speaker D: I'm just still on. But Ken or Lockheed happy for you to jump in if you want to add anything to that from the tech side storage and how we monitor. Yeah.
00:37:39.030 - 00:38:24.100, Speaker B: What I do is I use cloud service provider and they provide like alert and dashboard. That's really helpful. And then I set up alert for the storage to alert me more than 85%. The storage is actually the main issue I have been keep increasing. I think to start with would be 100 gigabyte to 200GB for the consensus and then two terabyte for execution layer. Yeah.
00:38:30.310 - 00:39:27.282, Speaker E: I'm Ken. I work with Richard. What we use currently is we've only using like 80GB worth of storage. We run Teku currently, so it's a substantial jump in resource usage from 80GB to over two terabytes of storage. We've been running over a network, so our disks are iSCSI. We don't actually have any local SSDs in our system. So if it's a two terabyte SSD that's local, then I guess rather than network attached, I guess there'd be some challenges in our infrastructure or infrastructure upgrades that we'd have to perform in order to us to support that configuration.
00:39:27.282 - 00:39:52.670, Speaker E: So it'd be interesting to know if you can run it over sort of distributors over iSCSI or like NVMe over iSCSI or something like that to get it to scale. To get the infrastructure to scale rather than just having a local machine with all the storage locally.
00:39:54.290 - 00:40:22.070, Speaker B: Yeah, that's probably a good question. I'm not sure. The most common is just SSD, as if you go for the network. It might be the scaling issue. I'm not sure. It might need a really high speed.
00:40:25.370 - 00:40:45.790, Speaker E: So it'd be interesting to know what the actual I ops were. Say how many I ops per second, like read versus write I Ops. And then how many milliseconds does it need to respond back to disk? Sort of like more granular specifics around those disk I OS, rather than just you need an SSD.
00:40:46.450 - 00:41:17.270, Speaker A: I wonder if that's available for any of the existing ETH One clients. Because the number of I Ops for the execution layer is going to surely be pretty similar to what's currently being used. So I guess if you know what it is for hyperledger besu when it's just running an E One client, then that's probably going to be a good indication. So if you can get that to work over your network, then it's probably going to work for the execution layer.
00:41:20.330 - 00:41:48.530, Speaker E: Yeah, we had a Geth client running because we need one. So we had one running local and it was working okay, but we sort of ended up migrating to the consensus hosted, I guess. So we know that does work locally. It took a while to sync, but it did actually work and it was okay about our network.
00:41:50.790 - 00:41:51.890, Speaker A: Sounds good.
00:41:52.040 - 00:41:52.980, Speaker B: So look.
00:41:54.870 - 00:42:35.250, Speaker A: I think you've asked a few questions there and I think that the thing is that it is using the Staking as a service thing. I think that's a true answer for yeah, and I'm seeing Nodding from Loki, so that's good. So look, I'm going to quickly share the last two slides and I think that's yeah, so we've already done questions. So the Ethereum engineering group meetup. So this talk is going to be available on YouTube in a few hours, probably. We've got a Slack Workspace, so please introduce yourself and have discussions on that. Slack Workspace.
00:42:35.250 - 00:43:32.594, Speaker A: And if you're watching this on YouTube, you can join the Meetup group by hitting that link. There is example code which you can also execute and run, which is in that repo. Future Talks we have got a Bazillion future talks coming up, so Roberto is going to talk about Qbft in two weeks time. And then we've got Niraj talking about NFTs and his analysis of the NFT ecosystem, which is going to be really interesting. It's a TBA, but I'm pretty sure on March 9 we're going to have Nikhail here talking about the merge and his understanding of what's likely to happen. So he's one of the people helping to drive the actual merge, so he should have a pretty good idea. On the 23rd, we'll be up to our hundredth talk and it's going to be a surprise that we're going to have come along.
00:43:32.594 - 00:44:29.880, Speaker A: And so I'm still negotiating that on April the 6th, we're going to have a talk about real world companies that are doing blockchain stuff. And so we've got one company already signed up, and if you're a company that's doing something in the blockchain space, please send me a message, email slack or whatever and say, look, I'm interested in presenting 30 seconds about what your company is, and then maybe a minute or two about what your application is, and then talk about your architecture. Because that's what people are interested in, this group. Like what are you doing, how does it work, how is it working for you overall? And then there's some more solidity talks coming up, so that's the general plan. So before we sign off, are there any last questions before we say see you later?
00:44:34.220 - 00:44:59.070, Speaker F: One question probably I'll ask now. When we use a staking service, we basically invest in and we give our money to a service and they make a mistake and Slash happens and we lost the ETH. So basically I lost the ETH if that happens or who take the responsibility because I have given my money custodian to somebody else to manage.
00:45:00.880 - 00:46:10.650, Speaker B: Yes, that's a good question. So on the on the website you put in 16 Eva. You also need to present, for example, apps like 1.6 value of the token to stay for protection of the Slashing case down to spill out as that 16 will be from the well data side and the other 16 from the micro pool. And then the 1.6 if value of the RPL will get sell and as compensation interest on the other 16 if public micro pool user. So that's how protection for Slashing works.
00:46:10.650 - 00:46:54.550, Speaker B: And then with the SSV is something more protection so that the validator site could just stay with one Eva and then just buy like 100% of the Dow token value, which is like another e value for protection for Slashing, but it's much less overhead as well.
