00:00:00.410 - 00:00:46.954, Speaker A: You. Hello and welcome, everyone. This is just a quick talk to get everyone ready who's going to be joining the advanced solidity test talk. Share my slides. Okay, so preparing for the advanced solidity test. So I guess the first thing you want to think about is how advanced are you really? And so if you're just a beginner, then watch the whole of this video and there's some suggested reading as well. Have a look at that and look at the code right now and start trying to understand how the code works and what could be wrong with it.
00:00:46.954 - 00:01:37.398, Speaker A: If you're intermediate, then watch the video and have a look at the suggested reading as well. And then maybe just have a look at the code maybe the day before. And if you're advanced, well, hey, you don't need any help at all. And so I think you should just be able to look at the code a few minutes before the talk. So the actual code, so the starting point code is at that link. So there's some annotated code that I've got that explain how I fix it all up so that it didn't have all the bugs in it. So the code is a flash loan and behind a transparent upgrade proxy.
00:01:37.398 - 00:02:27.450, Speaker A: And, oh, that should be the one at the bottom there should read V two. And so the idea is you've got a version, one of the contract, and then you add an extra feature and then you have V two. And so the idea is that you're maintaining all your data between V one and V two via that transparent proxy. That's the idea of what the code is. I guess, for those people who don't know what is a flash loan, so it's a loan that is uncollateralized. So you have no collateral. And what you do is you go to a contract and you say, could I borrow, say, 100 ETH? But I'm going to give you 100 ETH back plus some interest, and I'm going to do it all inside this transaction.
00:02:27.450 - 00:03:21.350, Speaker A: And so if you can't give back the money plus interest, then the whole thing is reverted, but it allows you, as within one transaction, to suddenly be a millionaire. And so what's a transparent upgrade proxy? So have a look at that link there. And so that was the more advanced solidity design patterns talk that I did, and it includes information about what a transparent proxy is and what an upgrade proxy is. So the talk itself is on December the 14th. So that's Australia time zone, which will be the 13th if you live in the Americas or Europe. And there's a whole stack of talks coming up. This is on YouTube.
00:03:21.350 - 00:03:41.500, Speaker A: If you want to join the slack, there's the link. If you want to join the meetup so you can be on the talk live and proffer your thoughts on what's wrong with the code, then please join the meetup. And yet this example code is there. Thank you and have a great day.
