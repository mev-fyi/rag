00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.470, Speaker A: So okay. Hello and welcome, everyone. This is the Ethereum Engineering Group. Meetup. And thank you, Darren, for coming along and telling us all about Ethereum Two Staking. Over to you, Darren.
00:00:14.130 - 00:00:31.282, Speaker B: Thank you very much, Peter. And thank you for inviting me to talk today. I love this subject, so I'm very happy to be here. So ethereum 2.0 staking me. Before I begin, a very small disclaimer. This is not financial advice.
00:00:31.282 - 00:00:54.202, Speaker B: If you want financial advice, speak to a financial advisor and opinions are my own. So let's kick off. So why am I here talking about ethereum? 2.0 staking. So, just slightly about me. My name is Darren Langley. I'm a software architect, blockchain consultant, and software developer.
00:00:54.202 - 00:01:30.600, Speaker B: So over the last two years, I have worked in the blockchain industry and I have been extremely lucky with the companies, projects and people that I've worked with. So Brisbane has some really good blockchain companies. One of those is rocket pool. So rocket pool are building an ethereum 2.0 staking platform. I no longer work at Rocket Pool, but I'm very close to the guys and I will try to contain my bias. But just so you know.
00:01:30.600 - 00:02:20.780, Speaker B: So when I was working for Rocket Pool, it was a very interesting time. We were preparing the beta program to test with real users the platform that we'd built out, all based on the Casper contract, which was the original way of doing proof of stake on Ethereum. So then suddenly, the research team changed the architecture completely. So going from the Casper contract to what is now the Beacon Chain and all of that stuff. And at the time it was a big shock, but wasn't completely a shock. The Casper contract just wasn't going to scale. It was going to exacerbate the Ethereum One performance issues.
00:02:20.780 - 00:03:12.090, Speaker B: It wasn't going to be as kind of decentralized as it probably needed to be. Rocket Pool was very supportive of the move to the Beacon Chain kind of architecture. So I kind of led the Ethereum Two research and got very, very deep into Ethereum Two. I wrote some of the first explainer medium articles that vitalik retweeted. Then Rocket Pool was invited to help workshop solutions at an event in Prague. And I managed to kind of meet a lot of the Ethereum Foundation team working on Ethereum Two and a lot of the client teams as well, which was really exciting. So it's been a really fun and interesting ride.
00:03:12.090 - 00:03:58.054, Speaker B: Why do I love this topic so much? So it is all the things you love about blockchain, but taken to all the things you love about blockchain. So cryptography, economics, distributed computing, all of that stuff, but taken to the bleeding edge. So it's a very exciting time to kind of be in the community. So what are we going to cover today? So we're going to cover proof of stake very quickly. There are hundreds of articles about proof of stake, so I won't spend too long on it. And I'll kind of highlight what I think is important. Ethereum 2.0.
00:03:58.054 - 00:04:39.058, Speaker B: So the roadmap and a bit about the timeline and that sort of stuff so that we kind of understand when we'll be able to validate and all of that sort of thing. Economics. So I say economics very loosely. I use that term very loosely. So the economics of being a validator, what it means to the network and what it means to the ecosystem. And then I'll talk about what you need to be a validator and then also some options because there are different options in terms of being involved. So proof of stake.
00:04:39.058 - 00:04:50.554, Speaker B: So Ethereum 2.0 uses a proof of stake based consensus protocol. So proof of stake is actually kind of one element of the consensus protocol. There's other elements as well.
00:04:50.592 - 00:04:57.260, Speaker A: Things like we can only see that first slide. Should we be seeing another slide now?
00:04:59.310 - 00:05:01.370, Speaker C: Yes, you should be seeing more slides.
00:05:03.090 - 00:05:22.180, Speaker B: 1 second, let me restart the sharing because it's definitely on my side. Can you see now?
00:05:23.510 - 00:05:25.990, Speaker A: Can see a slide which says contents.
00:05:26.570 - 00:05:28.920, Speaker B: And what can you see now?
00:05:30.090 - 00:05:32.034, Speaker A: Still the slide which says contents.
00:05:32.082 - 00:05:34.520, Speaker B: For me, that's no good.
00:05:38.010 - 00:05:38.870, Speaker C: MMM.
00:05:41.310 - 00:05:47.978, Speaker A: Maybe just have it in just show the slides rather than trying to do it in presenter mode, maybe.
00:05:48.064 - 00:05:52.000, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, maybe. Okay, cool. Let's do.
00:05:56.280 - 00:05:57.190, Speaker C: All right.
00:06:10.620 - 00:06:12.730, Speaker B: Can you see proof of stake now?
00:06:14.060 - 00:06:14.810, Speaker A: Yes.
00:06:15.340 - 00:06:47.670, Speaker B: Right, okay. So you'll be able to see my speaker notes. That's okay. So what does proof of stake do? So it incentivizes untrusted validators to maintain a consistent and secure blockchain. It protects the blockchain by providing economic security. So economic security underpins it all. So it means that to tamper with the blockchain ledger, an attacker risks a huge amount of money.
00:06:47.670 - 00:07:33.700, Speaker B: It makes sure that the attack is economically and feasible, and we'll talk about the amount that's going to be staked and the ramifications of that a little bit later. So proof of stake. So technically speaking, it means that it requires validators to stake Ether and then run a validator node proposing and attesting new blocks of transactions. So validators are rewarded with interest on their stake if they actively follow the protocol's rules. If they act dishonestly, their stake is burnt. So we'll talk about slashing and penalization later. So there's two ways that your stake can be affected.
00:07:33.700 - 00:08:25.204, Speaker B: One thing I wanted to kind of say is proof of stake is actually like a general tool. It's a crypto economic mechanism that is used in lots of different places. In Ethereum 2.0, it's both carrot and stick, but it's used in lots of different decentralized participation networks and blockchain based products and protocols at kind of some level. As a consensus protocol, it's arguably more egalitarian than proof of work because proof of work benefits from economies of scale. So because proof of work relies on hardware, the more you spend, the more of an advantage you have. And the more return essentially you get.
00:08:25.204 - 00:09:03.810, Speaker B: Whereas with proof of stake everyone gets the same proportional return. The other thing with proof of work is it also has a very high barrier of entry. Whereas proof of stake, in theory anyone with ETH can participate in securing the network and earning rewards. So Ethereum 2.0, so there are lots of client teams working on Ethereum 2.0 and I wrote an article a little while ago, quite a while ago about how it's being built. So some of the teams have changed a little bit but the kind of Ethos is still the same.
00:09:03.810 - 00:09:44.060, Speaker B: It's a community building. This whole thing not like a company or anything else. Many have their own kind of public testnets now and they're actually today Prismatic is doing essentially a final build preparing for a multi client testnet. So public interop is not too far away. So we're really getting to the pointy end of delivery for Ethereum 2.0. So why is Ethereum 2.0 a big deal? So they're building a highly secure piece of public infrastructure.
00:09:44.060 - 00:10:21.396, Speaker B: There are obviously many layers to security but from a base blockchain level it means incorruptibility and availability. Imagine that your home ownership is on the blockchain. You'd want it to be pretty incorruptible. In a blockchain world particularly with proof of stake, participation equals security. So ethereum 2.0 maximizes participation. So it's estimated to be around 16,000 to 300,000 plus validators.
00:10:21.396 - 00:11:11.316, Speaker B: That will kind of participate in the security of Ethereum 2.0. And that's important because the more people that participate the more expensive it is for the bad guys to do damage. In Ethereum two point zero's case it needs more than a third of the total stake to even kind of affect the protocol. When we look at the estimates later on the security of that will make sense. So here's the kind of roadmap for Ethereum 2.0. The Engineering Meetup has some great videos on this but I'll kind of go through it as kind of an overview. So the phase zero is the beacon chain and that is just doing staking and validating.
00:11:11.316 - 00:12:01.432, Speaker B: So there are no smart contracts, there's no state execution or at least no user state execution. There is a one way deposit into the beacon chain and its sole purpose is to run the beacon chain. Next there'll be phase one, which is the shard chains. So there'll be 64 shards with this kind of shared consensus and it is kind of data only. So again, there's no smart contracts, no state execution. But it does mean that it is a highly available incorruptible data source for stuff to be built on top of it applications to be built on top. And in actual fact L2 technologies are really kind of maturing now.
00:12:01.432 - 00:12:45.430, Speaker B: So L2 technologies, off chain execution and that sort of thing are really starting to mature. So that's where things like roll ups and application specific execution engines and CK snarks will kind of come into play a little bit. A lot of the interesting stuff will probably be built with the L2 things on Ethereum 2.0 in Phase One. So the general timeline so Phase zero is the next couple of months. So as I was saying, we're working towards multi client testnets, getting that kind of interop ready. So we should be seeing that in the next couple of months.
00:12:45.430 - 00:13:15.490, Speaker B: Phase one, the research is really mature. It's been mature for a long time. Sharding, they've kind of tweaked it along the way. But there's a draft spec. There's even a validated guide that's being written as we speak as well. Then comes Phase Two, which is state execution with smart contracts and being able to withdraw your funds and that sort of thing. And all the good stuff, a lot of the good stuff will be in Phase Two.
00:13:15.490 - 00:14:00.510, Speaker B: There's kind of a phase in between which may or may not happen but there's effectively an Ethereum One merge where Ethereum One becomes a shard chain and a cut down version of an Ethereum One client will be like an EVM execution engine that sits on top. That's still very much early days but they're starting that discussion now about how that might work. One thing to say is Phase Two is definitely an ongoing piece of research. So it's not quite to a point where there's like a spec that we can write to at the moment but it will be starting to formulate very soon.
00:14:03.120 - 00:14:47.720, Speaker C: So economics, as I said, I use that term loosely but how much you earn as a validator that kind of depends on the depends on a few different factors. The main factor, though is the total amount of ETH that's put into the system. So the total amount that everyone states in the beacon chain that's kind of like the biggest kind of factor in how much you return. Also things like whether you're online or offline and that sort of thing. That also makes a big difference with the kind of ethnoids. Ethereum 2.0 aims to balance participation which is what you said security and network issuance.
00:14:47.720 - 00:15:15.320, Speaker C: And I'll come into that in the next slide. So this is what it means for the network and I mean the Ethereum network. So proof of stake rewards initially will come from network issuance which is effectively new money. So later on it will also include fees and that sort of thing. But at least initially it'll be driven from network issuance.
00:15:16.060 - 00:15:51.250, Speaker B: So just as a baseline Ethereum One increases its supply by 4.5% to every I think it's annualized. So every every year. So Ethereum One spends 4.5% each year on security. Ethereum Two will spend a lot less. And the reason there's several reasons for that but the main reason is because Ethereum One is proof of work they have to incentivize miners a lot more.
00:15:51.250 - 00:16:17.452, Speaker B: And especially as there is no stick, it's pretty much just carrot. So that everyone's chasing the carrot. There is not really a stick. So you have to kind of incentivize people more plus also the equipment and all that sort of stuff that you need for proof of work. It's a lot more expensive. The barrier entry is high so with Ethereum 2.0 that's a lot lower and so you can actually reward people less.
00:16:17.452 - 00:17:06.040, Speaker B: Especially as there's also a stick that you can use which is the slashing and penalization. So the amount of issuance depends on the total amount staked but effectively Ethereum Two will spend less than 0.5% each year on security so it'll increase its circulating supply by much less which is kind of good for people who would hold ETH. So this is a very rough kind of reward sort of chart. So validator rewards depends on the total ETH state. So this graph is a little bit misleading. There's a minimum amount of ETH that will kick off this whole process.
00:17:06.040 - 00:18:17.090, Speaker B: That is the Genesis amount and it's just over 500,000 Ether or $78 million US dollars. So we start at the Genesis amount and the validator reward is around 20% and then as more Ether is staked that reward decreases. So this is that whole thing about balancing participation and issuance. So you want to kind of balance those two factors. So at some point along this curve it'll come to a natural equilibrium and it will just sit at that level somewhere between four and 20% depending on the total ETH staked. Remembering that in phase zero it's kind of an indeterminate locking period because there is no withdrawal so that's not going to appeal to a lot of people. So Staking may be less popular at the beginning and more popular as the phases start being developed and you get withdrawals and that sort of stuff.
00:18:20.180 - 00:18:41.944, Speaker A: So Darren, is this diagram showing so if we assume that, say right at the start you only have, I don't know, say 1 million ETH staked, then you're going to be getting a higher reward than say later on more people decide that it's not that dangerous. So then you have more people join to the actual rewards less.
00:18:41.982 - 00:18:43.624, Speaker B: Is that what that's right?
00:18:43.662 - 00:18:43.864, Speaker C: Yes.
00:18:43.902 - 00:19:46.590, Speaker B: So as more ease get staked so as more people come on board, effectively the reward rate goes down or it goes down and then levels out. But that's exactly it. The rewards are actually so this is kind of annualized numbers but the rewards are delivered or kind of actualized on a per epoch basis. So it's on a per EPOC basis depending on the validator set that's currently invalidating. Obviously these numbers may change but these are the current numbers that are based on the main net configuration. There also is another outcome and that is that there's a huge amount of interest in Staking and it could end up somewhere on this curve. But yeah, that's the thing we don't know.
00:19:46.590 - 00:20:55.830, Speaker B: So what do you need to become a validator. So you need a minimum of 32 E per Validator. I've kind of put the caveat there of kind of we'll talk about some staking pools later, but currently 32 Ether is the minimum you'll need per Validator and that's around 5000 USD or 8000 AUD. You've got to kind of be willing to deposit that from Ethereum One chain. And once you deposit it, the ether on the Ethereum One chain, it's effectively burnt from the Ethereum One chain and then ends up in Ethereum Two. Now, as said, withdrawals won't necessarily be available until Phase two, but there may well be liquidity providers that you can effectively sell your locked up ETH to. But I would kind of expect a reasonable liquidity discount on that.
00:20:58.520 - 00:21:54.380, Speaker C: Again, we don't know what it's going to look like, but I suspect there will be liquidity providers so that you could sell your locked up E in phase zero. You are kind of locked up for an indeterminate staking period. But later on, in multiple phases, in different phases, you'll be able to kind of vary the periods that you lock up your kind of lock up your E effectively or stake your E. Okay, so the technical aspects so the Spec doesn't really separate Validator and Beacon Chain, but many of the Ethereum 2.0 client teams have kind of implemented separate processes. So technically you just need to run a validator. So whether that's kind of Prism, Lighthouse, Nimbus, Peku, Lozar the Validator client is quite lightweight in terms of machine spec.
00:21:54.380 - 00:22:03.790, Speaker C: It's very lightweight. It can be run on I think they said it would run on a mobile. Nimbus can be run on a mobile.
00:22:05.810 - 00:23:01.220, Speaker B: But then you also need access to a beacon chain. Beacon chain needs a better spec machine. Prism released their specs today and they need a minimum of an I Five. They recommend an I Seven kind of equivalent, four to eight gig of Ram and definitely an SSD and a really good network connection. So it's actually three things you need for running a Validator participating as a validator, you need a Validator, a beacon chain and an ETH One client. One thing to consider though, is later on they may well be people offering beacon chain similar to what Infuria does for ETH One clients. They may well be a beacon chain provider for that.
00:23:01.220 - 00:24:23.142, Speaker B: Obviously it's important that you trust the beacon chain and you need to have very good connection to it and all of that sort of stuff. So ideally you would be running the beacon chain and an Ethereum One client yourself to kind of secure the network properly. So, as said before, a very good internet connection is essential. The beacon chain in particular is well, both the Ethereum One client and Beacon chain are quite network heavy and you can so it is possible with some of the clients to run multiple validators, all pointing to one beacon chain. And so we're seeing people looking at running like hundreds and thousands of Validators, all pointing to a small number of beacon chains and Ethereum One clients. So you could have very simple setups or you can have much more complex setups. So if you're going to be running lots of Validators and so you've got quite a lot of Ethereum at stake, it's highly likely that you want to consider redundancy load balancing lots of multiple clients.
00:24:23.142 - 00:25:13.014, Speaker B: So for example, don't just have one type of client, so have Lighthouse and Prism and Nimbus for example. Mix and match your clients. If there's a bug in one of them, it's going to affect all of them. So it's really about spreading out that if you've got lots and lots of Validators, it's about spreading out that risk and having a very robust setup. If you've got a lot of Validators running, then orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes makes a lot of sense. It's kind of cluster based, it has auto scheduling, self healing, so infrastructure is code, so there's kind of quick point in time recovery and all that sort of stuff. But obviously there is a cost consideration.
00:25:13.014 - 00:25:59.260, Speaker B: So depending on where you're hosting your solutions. Do you use a cloud provider, do you use data centers, do you do it from home? So there's obviously trade offs between all of those three things, especially being in Australia where we are quite far away from kind of things. But I'll kind of elaborate on some of the things in the next section. So each of the Ethereum Two clients has some sort of CLI and API. There is a big movement now to make the APIs a bit more consistent between the different implementations. So there's a big kind of push for that. Ongoing at the moment.
00:25:59.260 - 00:26:28.978, Speaker B: Sigma prime has also recently launched a movement to focus on the user experience for Staking. Currently it's very CLI and very technical heavy at the moment. And also we need kind of better education in terms of making sure people are aware of all of the concepts and the risks and all of that sort of thing. That work is going to be really important. Really interesting.
00:26:29.144 - 00:26:34.486, Speaker C: Rocket Pool have been doing some amazing work on both the staker and node operator experience.
00:26:34.668 - 00:26:36.262, Speaker B: If you check out their latest Dev.
00:26:36.316 - 00:26:39.782, Speaker C: Update, there's some really good stuff that they're doing.
00:26:39.836 - 00:26:49.930, Speaker B: They're actually building products that people can use, which is really good. So some risks.
00:26:50.350 - 00:27:23.158, Speaker C: So a massive risk that needs to be kind of mitigated or managed is key management and security. There are two keys. There's a signing key and a withdrawal key. And if someone gets your signing key, they can get you slashed. If somebody gets your withdrawal key, they can get access to your funds, obviously. So you don't want that to happen. If you're running lots of Validators and that sort of thing, it becomes more of an issue.
00:27:23.158 - 00:28:02.370, Speaker C: So definitely having some sort of plan in place to how you're going to generate those keys, store those keys and move them around is really important. Hardware keys don't support BLS at the moment and cloud HSMs don't either. You have to have kind of some sort of strategy in place. There are two ways your state can be affected. So there's flashing, which in theory only ever happens to a bad actor. If you're using one of the standard ethereum two clients, they have things in place or that they've gone through a lot of effort to make sure that you don't get slashed.
00:28:04.230 - 00:28:32.860, Speaker B: It should never happen that you get slashed. If you're using a Dodgy client or something, then maybe that happens. So then there's penalties. So penalties in general inactivity penalties are kind of not harsh at all. So you can actually be offline for quite a while without eroding your original stake. But it obviously will definitely affect your return. If you're offline, you won't get anywhere near as much of a return.
00:28:32.860 - 00:29:44.734, Speaker B: There is a kind of major asterisk to that or a major caveat to that. And that is in the quadratic leaking situation, if you are offline when a large number of Validators are also offline, you will get punished quite heavily. So that's a mechanism in place to stop kind of centralization to a certain degree. It's also a mechanism to stop long running attacks and that sort of stuff. But you'll definitely get hit hard if finalization stops. So if you get more than one third of Validators kind of inactive then finalization stops, all reward stops and inactive Validators are punished quite heavily. So again, the other kind of risk is that there is no withdrawal until probably phase two, but it may come in sooner.
00:29:44.734 - 00:29:54.600, Speaker B: But that's at the moment when withdrawal is kind of planned for. So if you're going to be running a Validator, testnets are your friend.
00:29:56.810 - 00:29:57.126, Speaker C: Run.
00:29:57.148 - 00:30:40.274, Speaker B: Your Validator, set up on testnets, make sure it's battle hardened, make sure you know how to run it, make sure you know how to monitor it, make sure you can operate it effectively. Testnets are definitely your friend. So then options. So we've kind of covered running your own Validator. But there are some other options. Obviously there will be some custodial as a service offerings that if you don't have technical knowledge you can kind of pay somebody else to do it and they will probably take custody of your ether and then give it back to you. But then there are kind of other options as well.
00:30:40.274 - 00:31:09.200, Speaker B: There's a staking pool as well. So that has the benefit that there is no minimum staking or sorry, there's a very low minimum. Usually kind of one e is kind of the minimum with the staking pool. There are kind of generally two types, centralized versus decentralized. So you have to kind of weigh up the trade offs between those sorts of things. Again, kind of mentioning rocket pool, but rocket pool is a staking pool. But it's slightly different.
00:31:09.200 - 00:32:04.560, Speaker B: So it's actually a staking pool network. So what it does is it is a two sided market. So it has people who want to stake ether but don't have any technical knowledge on one side and people who want to run nodes on the other side. So what they do is they bring those two parties together and there's kind of some good benefits for both. So the people without technical knowledge, they get to pay a low fee for staking their ether. The node operators need a minimum of 16 ether rather than 32 because Rockpool matches 16 ether from other clients funds. But they also get part of the fee from charging the staking customer.
00:32:07.730 - 00:32:08.094, Speaker C: Who.
00:32:08.132 - 00:32:32.566, Speaker B: Are staking on their no. So effectively what that means is that they make more of a reward through rocket pool than they would do kind of on their own. So that's it really. There are the options. A lot of talented people have been working tirelessly over the last few years to bring Ethereum 2.0 home and the.
00:32:32.588 - 00:32:50.400, Speaker C: Future looks really bright. I'm really excited to see what happens going forward. So here's my contact details if you want to get in contact with me. So thank you very much. Any questions?
00:32:56.320 - 00:33:10.100, Speaker A: So are there any questions? You've answered everything for us already.
00:33:10.950 - 00:33:13.380, Speaker D: I have one if no one else does.
00:33:14.250 - 00:33:15.400, Speaker C: Go for it.
00:33:18.810 - 00:33:19.560, Speaker B: The.
00:33:21.770 - 00:34:22.940, Speaker D: Phase One technologies on developing the shards and implementing rolling them out. It seems to me there are some gaps in the maturity of the existing technologies. So we can certainly do buying selling across a shard as it exists today. But trying to do any kind of cross shard transfers still seems to be quite an active area of development. It's quite clear to me how a user knows what shard they're on and knows what the friction is if they're trying to pay someone on a different shard, et cetera. You made the comment, I think that Phase One technologies were very mature but I wonder what you think about that particular aspect of it.
00:34:24.110 - 00:35:37.140, Speaker B: Yeah, that's something that is definitely still being kind of researched. One of the things that may make that a lot easier is because it's layered and when I say layered, I mean the kind of application stack. So the blockchain is obviously the base layer, it's the kind of data layer effectively. But then we'll have other stuff that sits on top of it to kind of smooth out the UX a little bit. So those things may make that easier but to be honest, asynchronous cross links and stuff are still kind of, I think, minutes to get something over to another shard. So I don't know at this stage that is definitely something that's still being worked on. But I'm thinking that some of the things that we layer on top of it may make it a lot easier in terms of the user experience.
00:35:39.590 - 00:35:39.954, Speaker C: If.
00:35:39.992 - 00:35:41.810, Speaker B: It doesn't get fixed at the base layer.
00:35:42.950 - 00:35:44.440, Speaker D: Yeah. Thanks very much.
00:35:50.280 - 00:36:36.530, Speaker A: So I've got a question too. I guess it looked like ETH Two was going to be really ready. About a year or two ago when I think you and I first crossed paths and all the staking it sounded like very hot and it must be really hard for a company like Rocket Pool that was getting a platform together two years ago, not a few months ago. And so I don't know how is that company going because I guess there'll be finally the staking happening in probably June or something like that, I think is when the beacon chain supposed to start.
00:36:38.340 - 00:37:22.512, Speaker B: I can't because I don't work for Rocket Pool anymore, I can't necessarily speak for them completely. So Rocket Pool have actually been working on Staking for even longer than that. David, the founder, was actually kind of starting the project when the move paper came out, when Vitalik first did it, which I think was 2017, 2000. Yeah, something like that. So they've actually been working on it for a lot longer. No, all I can say is that they are heads down working very hard. I know that for sure.
00:37:22.512 - 00:37:40.650, Speaker B: So they are producing some really good stuff. They've got some really good ideas for how this will kind of look. So that's all I can really say is that they are working really hard and doing some really good stuff. That's the only way that's the only thing they can do.
00:37:42.780 - 00:38:06.800, Speaker A: So the contracts that you could deposit your money into I guess they're still being audited and I guess until those go live and then we can actually see ether going in we're not really going to know how much ether people will initially stake. So we won't know whether we're going to have a million ether, 2 million ether, 10 million ether or just 100,000 ether.
00:38:07.300 - 00:38:26.784, Speaker B: That's right. We should gauge quite quickly what the takeup is in the first few days, I would imagine. But although some of the indications something to look at if you want to kind of gauge interest is the participation.
00:38:26.832 - 00:38:51.630, Speaker C: On the test nets and that sort of thing. That is kind of a leading indicator. Although I would probably say that testnets are a lot easier to get involved in than actually putting your own money in. But at the same time that could be a leading indicator into how popular it will be from kind of day one, D plus M, whatever.
00:38:52.080 - 00:39:01.452, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Do you want to move to the next slide?
00:39:01.596 - 00:39:02.610, Speaker C: Yeah, I do.
00:39:05.220 - 00:39:49.088, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So whilst people are thinking about extra questions they're dying to ask I'll quickly talk about the forthcoming talks. So Ali from QT is going to be along in two weeks time to talk about IoT and blockchain and then in two more weeks time after that we're going to hear about the formal verification of the E Two beacon chain using Daphne and some combination of. Roberto Frank, joanne and David are going to talk about that. And I can see Joanne's on the call and David's on the call, so I'm sure they're all raring to go on that. So that's good.
00:39:49.088 - 00:40:27.610, Speaker A: And then Harathio has put his hand up to talk about polynomial commitments and commitment compression, which is another ethereum two related thing. So they're coming up. They'll all be via zoom. I don't think we're going to be meeting in person. Well, definitely not this side of June. So, anyway, are there any questions for Darren? Okay, well, look, Darren, thank you very much for presenting. It's been very interesting, and hope to see everyone in two weeks time.
00:40:28.380 - 00:40:33.696, Speaker B: Cool. Thank you very much, guys. It was great to kind of present. Cool. Thank you.
00:40:33.838 - 00:40:34.592, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:40:34.726 - 00:40:39.836, Speaker B: Thank you for the presentation. Thanks, Dan. Very good. Bye.
