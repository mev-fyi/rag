00:00:00.330 - 00:00:22.382, Speaker A: So what is the number theoretic transform? So, conveniently, you know, a few weeks before I was slated to give this presentation, I saw that the YouTube channel veritasium had actually made a video on the fast Fourier transform, which is very.
00:00:22.436 - 00:00:25.858, Speaker B: Related to the number theoretic transform.
00:00:26.034 - 00:00:44.714, Speaker A: The Fourier transform in general is, you can think of it as a way of decomposing a function or a signal down into sort of component parts. In the case of the Fourier transform, the traditional Fourier transform, those are sort.
00:00:44.752 - 00:00:49.020, Speaker B: Of these sine waves that you can see here.
00:00:49.970 - 00:01:04.466, Speaker A: And it's something that's useful across many domains of engineering, signal processing. It's really a sort of very broadly useful mathematical idea, and it comes up.
00:01:04.648 - 00:01:06.260, Speaker B: In starks as well.
00:01:06.950 - 00:01:15.670, Speaker A: And so what we'll learn today is sort of more about the specific version of the Fourier transform that is used.
00:01:15.820 - 00:01:17.080, Speaker B: In risk zero.
00:01:19.210 - 00:02:25.370, Speaker A: And that is the number theoretic transform. So the veritasium video also mentions briefly the so called discrete Fourier transform, which is the idea that if you're working on a computer, computers are sort of these digital machines that take in discrete data, they discrete chunks of data. And so instead of a continuous signal, a computer is only going to see a bunch of samples out of that data. And so the discrete Fourier transform is an algorithm that can process a signal in that form and break it down into a bunch of constituent sine waves. The number theoretic transform is sort of a modified version of the discrete Fourier transform, but with two big distinctions. And the first is that rather than a continuous signal, right, sort of an amplitude, that's a real number. The number theoretic transform works more over groups and finite fields.
00:02:25.870 - 00:02:28.090, Speaker B: So if you came to the study.
00:02:28.160 - 00:02:44.946, Speaker A: Club a couple of weeks ago, Paul introduced you to finite fields. And so that's the first major difference between the number theoretic transform and the discrete Fourier transform. The other sort of major distinction is that the concept of sine waves, or.
00:02:44.968 - 00:02:48.130, Speaker B: Cosine waves, gets replaced by polynomials.
00:02:50.230 - 00:02:58.198, Speaker A: You have a composition of sine waves, or you can have an addition of a bunch of polynomials, and it turns out that polynomials are the right sort.
00:02:58.204 - 00:03:07.160, Speaker B: Of analog for a sine wave when you're talking about finite fields. And of course, polynomials are very important for zero knowledge proof systems in general.
00:03:07.930 - 00:03:13.234, Speaker A: And so I imagine some of you have come to the talks on previous.
00:03:13.282 - 00:03:22.140, Speaker B: Weeks on these, but Paul has some nice YouTube playlists that sort of go over these things. If you want to go over those.
