00:00:00.090 - 00:00:37.620, Speaker A: We look at the ZKVM, is there a way to sort of make the program execute in a way that we can make scale? And so our approach is basically, let's split the execution up into separate parts. We call these segments. Once you split them up into separate parts, you can now prove each one of these parts independently. So there's a first phase where we have to basically run the entire thing in serial. But once that's done, we can do the proving of each part in parallel. And then, of course, we can use recursion to do a roll up where we get a single succinct sort of proof at the very end and.
