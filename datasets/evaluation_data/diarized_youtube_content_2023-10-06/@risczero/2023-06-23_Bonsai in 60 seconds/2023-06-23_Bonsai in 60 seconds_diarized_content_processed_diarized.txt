Everybody likes paying less for computations executed outside the EVM, but because this is ZK, after we take care of the off chain computation, we're going to give you some results that anybody can easily validate without having to run the computation themselves. Your contract lives on the blockchain, talks to a relay contract also deployed on the blockchain. So we're going to start out reaching out through that relay contract, which will communicate through the ETH relay onto Bonsai, and we'll manage the calls between the blockchain and the proving service for you. And then we're going to run your program off chain using inputs from that smart contract call, prove your code was executed in a way that anyone can verify, and get it back to you right in a callback function.
