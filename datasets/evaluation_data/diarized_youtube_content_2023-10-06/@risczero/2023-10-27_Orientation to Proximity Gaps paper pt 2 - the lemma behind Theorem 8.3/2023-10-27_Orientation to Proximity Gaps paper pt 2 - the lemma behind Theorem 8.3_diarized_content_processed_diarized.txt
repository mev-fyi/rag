00:00:00.650 - 00:00:41.962, Speaker A: So theorem 8.3 is supported primarily by lemma 8.2. Lemma 8.2 describes the error for the commit phase, which includes or I guess, I don't know what the c is, whether it's commit or constant, but anyways, it's everything but the queries. And if we look at the proof of lemma 8.2, we can dig in a little bit more. So the proof of lemma 8.2
00:00:41.962 - 00:01:42.218, Speaker A: spans a couple of pages, and towards the end of this proof, I guess it spans. Yeah, this far. This is the end of the proof of lemma 8.2. This section of the algebra feels like particularly accessible. We have some event that depends on a bunch of randomnesses that's just a single event, and then we have additionally a number of events that's indexed by the number of rounds. So this is our batching error, which includes randomness over. This is the number of things that we're batching together, and this is the folding error.
00:01:42.218 - 00:03:10.418, Speaker A: And in each round of randomness, there's just a single random element that we're drawing. So I'll comment that this batching is what's described as affine batching in the paper, and this batching is what's described as parametric batching. More explicitly, we use powers of a single random element as like well, we choose a random point on a degree one parameterized curve for this batching, and we choose a random point in an affine space spanned by these vectors, whatever, in the affine batching. Okay, so we have these two terms, I guess whatever. We have this one term and these r terms, but I'm going to call it this term and this other term. They each have an epsilon that appears here. And looking at how this ends up resolving the shape of this equation, this epsilon is what I was referencing.
00:03:10.418 - 00:03:13.330, Speaker A: We're, I think, going to get to basically replace.
