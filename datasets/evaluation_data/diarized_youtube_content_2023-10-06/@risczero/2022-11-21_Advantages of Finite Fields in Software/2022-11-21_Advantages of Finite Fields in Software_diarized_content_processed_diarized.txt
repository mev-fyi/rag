00:00:00.570 - 00:01:13.886, Speaker A: Let me step back from the concrete hands on how do you play with fields and step a little bit into the like, why should I care? What are fields good for? Why are fields used in computer contexts? And there's a few kind of really nice advantages of fields. If you are writing a typical program and are going to write division, you have to worry about your types. If you take two integers and divide them, you don't get another integer, and that's kind of annoying and that just doesn't happen here. So there's no concern about being able to do division. Similarly, if you're doing arithmetic in a typical program and you want to compute say like seven to the 82nd power, you're going to have to switch from an int to a big int, or somehow take advantage of. Or you're going to have to deal with the fact that big numbers take a lot more space to represent. And in this context, where everything just wraps around, nothing takes more space to represent than anything else.
00:01:13.886 - 00:01:27.060, Speaker A: And there's no overflow errors, and there's no issue about needing to allocate a different amount of memory for a large number or a small number. If.
