00:00:01.880 - 00:01:15.684, Speaker A: Okay, so the last part of this foundry template that I want to walk through the code for is the publisher app, which is going to be responsible for requesting a proof from Bonsai and then publishing that proof onto the blockchain. So the publisher app lives in this apps directory. And I'm just going to take a look at the main function here. So here's the off chain proof request to the bones side proving service. We're going to specify the binary file that we're proving and the input that we're proving here. And then here, once we get back the proof, we're going to be able to extract the journal from the receipt. So we're going to send a request to Bonsai.
00:01:15.684 - 00:01:58.404, Speaker A: Bonsai is going to send us back a receipt. The public outputs of the program are in the journal. And so we can decode the journal and then we're at the end gonna send a contract to, or send the call data to Ethereum. So there's a little bit of extra meat in the middle that you can take a look at the details of. But the gist of this is that we're gonna send a proof to Bonsai, we're going to extract the journal from the proof, and we're going to send what we want to send to Ethereum. So that's all I'll say in this video. Happy building.
