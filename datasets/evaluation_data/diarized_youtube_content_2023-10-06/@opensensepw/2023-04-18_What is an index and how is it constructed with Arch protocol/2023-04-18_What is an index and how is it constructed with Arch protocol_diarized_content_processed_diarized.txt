00:00:07.560 - 00:00:23.674, Speaker A: You tell me when we're ready. It's recording now. Also, can you, can you see my screen?
00:00:24.854 - 00:00:26.438, Speaker B: Yes, we can see your screen.
00:00:26.566 - 00:00:29.294, Speaker A: I think he will text you back.
00:00:29.334 - 00:00:29.914, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:30.254 - 00:00:33.870, Speaker A: Okay, so this a little bit to.
00:00:33.902 - 00:00:48.254, Speaker C: Talk about what arch finance is. So I'll present myself first. Well, I'm known as many names. I have a. In this course, I'm known as Archduke, you see, or pompous nature. But in the Twitter that you'll find.
00:00:48.294 - 00:00:51.518, Speaker A: Me over there, I'm called Rodrigo Gauna.
00:00:51.646 - 00:00:58.064, Speaker C: I'm a dev from Chile, and I'm building architecture, which is a diversified investment protocol.
00:00:58.404 - 00:01:02.492, Speaker A: So we are the passive investment platform of web3.
00:01:02.628 - 00:01:11.740, Speaker C: We want to become the main passive investment tool of web3, and that's why we offer expert led investment opportunities. We have a very simple to use.
00:01:11.772 - 00:01:17.028, Speaker A: Platform, either on mobile or on desktop, and we will be, it can be.
00:01:17.036 - 00:01:21.584, Speaker C: Very easy to start building your own diversified crypto portfolio in minutes just by.
00:01:21.884 - 00:01:25.944, Speaker A: Connecting your wallet and start diversifying.
00:01:27.044 - 00:01:40.732, Speaker C: This is very simple. You can just connect your wallet. We have a lot of different methods so that you can connect to our platform. You can use either stuff like magic.
00:01:40.788 - 00:01:44.764, Speaker A: That associates a wallet with your email.
00:01:44.844 - 00:01:54.698, Speaker C: Or your social media login, like Twitter or stuff. Or we have the typical crypto connections, which is like wallet connect, coinbase wallet.
00:01:54.746 - 00:01:56.762, Speaker A: And the typical metamask.
00:01:56.898 - 00:02:01.218, Speaker C: After that, you can just use whatever token you have in your wallet, either.
00:02:01.266 - 00:02:08.066, Speaker A: USDC or maybe matic, if you're in polygon or if you're in Ethereum.
00:02:08.130 - 00:02:09.634, Speaker C: We are active on both of those.
00:02:09.674 - 00:02:12.362, Speaker A: Networks with liquidity on both of them.
00:02:12.418 - 00:02:13.802, Speaker C: And you can buy any of the.
00:02:13.898 - 00:02:15.174, Speaker A: Products that we offer.
00:02:15.924 - 00:02:37.180, Speaker C: So to talk a little bit more about what we're building and why are we building this, is that the index products in crypto are not yet that very common. People just buy tokens that they find interesting without a specific methodology. But we know that in the traditional world of finance, ETF's also known as.
00:02:37.212 - 00:02:40.020, Speaker A: Indexes, or maybe ETF's are very attractive.
00:02:40.052 - 00:02:57.452, Speaker C: To different types of investors because they provide you a way to like, just invest in the index and it will regulate itself, rebalance itself as, as, like, as the market goes by. And it's a passive investment product because you don't have to take much action. You just buy that product and just let it be.
00:02:57.508 - 00:03:00.252, Speaker A: And the product will like act according.
00:03:00.308 - 00:03:01.852, Speaker C: To the market, go up in price.
00:03:01.908 - 00:03:15.866, Speaker A: Go down and change its components. And also this way you're diversified and it's way better to like, uh, minimize risk. And uh, and it's, and and it.
00:03:15.890 - 00:03:18.170, Speaker C: Provides different opportunities to hedge, like your.
00:03:18.202 - 00:03:19.770, Speaker A: Positions and stuff like that.
00:03:19.922 - 00:03:29.706, Speaker C: So to build a good product of investment, we have to first create a classification standard. So I don't know how many of you guys have heard of the s and P 500, which is the most.
00:03:29.730 - 00:03:31.854, Speaker A: Typical ETF that people buy.
00:03:32.434 - 00:03:34.242, Speaker C: To build that type of ETF's, you.
00:03:34.258 - 00:03:35.642, Speaker A: Have to go through three steps.
00:03:35.738 - 00:03:40.926, Speaker C: The first is the classification standard. Then you need a benchmark index, and then finally you get the product that.
00:03:40.950 - 00:03:44.926, Speaker A: You can buy with your money. So that's why at Arch we created.
00:03:44.950 - 00:03:50.022, Speaker C: The Arch token classification standard for all of the cryptos that are in the ecosystem.
00:03:50.118 - 00:03:50.798, Speaker A: Not all of them.
00:03:50.846 - 00:04:10.556, Speaker C: We have a sort of filter that not all of the, like scan coins, like sheet coins, like coins that have less than I think is 50 million market cap. We don't take those, we take only the big ones. And we classified all of those tokens using a specific methodology, which I can.
00:04:10.580 - 00:04:11.744, Speaker A: Talk more about later.
00:04:13.244 - 00:04:34.060, Speaker C: And using that classification standard, we built a lot of indices that you can see on our platform. You can have the blockchain indexes, which is the major l one, s a stablecoin index, to see all the stable coins used in the Ethereum network, like USDT, USDC, BUSD and stuff like that. And then there's like more indexes that we have built.
00:04:34.092 - 00:04:36.560, Speaker A: But these are not tokens that you can buy.
00:04:36.592 - 00:04:39.296, Speaker C: This is just indices that are able.
00:04:39.320 - 00:04:45.560, Speaker A: To track the market according to specific, like, I don't know, types of tokens that you have.
00:04:45.592 - 00:04:53.616, Speaker C: Maybe you want the infrastructure sector and, and you'll have like tokens like chain link, like the graph and stuff like that. Maybe you want to like metaverse industry.
00:04:53.680 - 00:04:59.164, Speaker A: And you have stuff like the sandbox token, and, I don't know.
00:05:00.304 - 00:05:07.316, Speaker C: And using those indices are, that's how we build the investable products.
00:05:07.460 - 00:05:11.864, Speaker A: Right now we have four investable products.
00:05:12.284 - 00:05:17.396, Speaker C: Three are indexes and one is a portfolio. So these are the three big tokens.
00:05:17.420 - 00:05:20.204, Speaker A: That we offer on our platform, and.
00:05:20.364 - 00:05:58.250, Speaker C: They can be bought, minted and redeemed in our platform in a decentralized way. All of these tokens that you buy, you can redeem them yourself, you can interact with the smart contract. All of this is completely decentralized. We hold no control over the assets that compose these tokens. If you buy, you mean your token, you have the collateral, you can have everything controlled by your wallet. So we want to put emphasis on that because we want people to know that they can be self custodial and have the tokens, like not trust anyone because that's the ethos of crypto. And these are the top three tokens that we offer in our platform.
00:05:58.250 - 00:06:32.602, Speaker C: So the first one is the arch blockchains, which is the major tokens of the l one for l two. So you can see that we have bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and polygon. We sometimes cannot add a lot of the tokens because there's not enough liquidity in the chains that we manage. So for example, there's not enough avalanche liquidity to be added to the token. So for now, that's how we manage the, the compositions. The arches here on web3 is kind of, we sold it as the s and p 500, but of crypto because it's the big projects that are.
00:06:32.618 - 00:06:34.850, Speaker A: Built on top of Ethereum and that's.
00:06:34.882 - 00:06:37.802, Speaker C: Like the most known token that we.
00:06:37.818 - 00:06:42.474, Speaker A: Have and where most of the people are invested in.
00:06:42.634 - 00:06:48.690, Speaker C: And then we have the ADI, which is the arch USD diversified yield, which is a new product that we launched.
00:06:48.802 - 00:06:55.070, Speaker A: Just recently, which is an exposure to yield using stablecoins.
00:06:55.142 - 00:06:59.782, Speaker C: So this is more on the safe side, like less risky type of tokens.
00:06:59.878 - 00:07:12.582, Speaker A: Just yield with USDC and using those are, we are how you can start building your own, like diversified portfolios. So this is Dutch Ethereum web3.
00:07:12.678 - 00:07:17.638, Speaker C: Here we have some sort of specs based on the market, as you can see. Well, it hasn't been, we're in a.
00:07:17.646 - 00:07:24.172, Speaker A: Bear market, so of course, like year long performances aren't very good, but well.
00:07:24.228 - 00:07:40.644, Speaker C: All of the market is like that, so. But we have been able to tell that you can minimize risk by having these tokens in the downside of the markets. This is some fact sheets of the tokens. You can see all of these in our platform.
00:07:40.764 - 00:07:42.684, Speaker A: So I don't want to like mess.
00:07:42.724 - 00:07:54.270, Speaker C: You up with so many data. So now, yeah, we're backed by great investors, digital currency group upload, and we went through the Defi alliance accelerator, which.
00:07:54.302 - 00:07:55.902, Speaker A: Incubates web3 projects.
00:07:56.078 - 00:08:00.638, Speaker C: And yeah, that's what Arch is now. I want to show you, this is.
00:08:00.686 - 00:08:04.198, Speaker A: My socials, if you want to, I.
00:08:04.206 - 00:08:07.182, Speaker C: Don'T know, ask me a question or keep in touch. You want to add me on Twitter?
00:08:07.238 - 00:08:11.462, Speaker A: That's my Twitter handle, if you want to discuss anything, and I'll show you.
00:08:11.478 - 00:08:19.620, Speaker C: The platform itself working and then we can go through the smart contracts, which I think it's what you'll find the most interested in. If you have any questions right now.
00:08:19.652 - 00:08:20.824, Speaker A: You can just ask me.
00:08:33.364 - 00:08:38.344, Speaker C: Oh, this is the. Are you guys able to see this well, hear me well?
00:08:39.964 - 00:08:42.770, Speaker A: Yeah, great. Yes.
00:08:42.802 - 00:08:44.626, Speaker B: Sir, we hear you very well.
00:08:44.770 - 00:08:45.410, Speaker A: Nice.
00:08:45.562 - 00:08:47.882, Speaker C: So this is the platform that we built.
00:08:47.938 - 00:08:50.890, Speaker A: This is Archfinance architect finance.
00:08:50.922 - 00:08:52.954, Speaker C: You can come here and start buying.
00:08:52.994 - 00:08:54.330, Speaker A: Anything, as you can see.
00:08:54.362 - 00:08:56.254, Speaker C: You can get started and.
00:08:57.954 - 00:08:58.546, Speaker A: Come here.
00:08:58.570 - 00:09:19.414, Speaker C: And connect your wallet to see whatever tokens you have. I already have my wallet connected. And here you can see all the assets that you have. Here you can see the products that we have. You have three different index tokens, with which is the token study. I show you the best of word three, the backbone of crypto, which is the largest ones, and the USD stablecoin yield. And you can buy like, you can see the performance.
00:09:21.274 - 00:09:22.854, Speaker A: Like in one year.
00:09:23.834 - 00:09:38.486, Speaker C: From one day, you can see the location, which are the tokens. We can see Uniswap, Chainlink, Lido, the biggest protocols on Ethereum right now. Also another product that we have that's very interesting.
00:09:38.590 - 00:09:40.394, Speaker A: Sorry, do you want to say something?
00:09:46.934 - 00:09:58.422, Speaker C: Okay, so this is another product that we offer, which is a portfolio, moderate risk. We want to offer now a more risky one and a less riskier one, which is a combination of the tokens, the index tokens that I just showed.
00:09:58.438 - 00:10:01.830, Speaker A: You, this ones so different, based on different like percentages.
00:10:02.022 - 00:10:06.278, Speaker C: We can build different portfolios that are more risky or less riskier, because we.
00:10:06.286 - 00:10:08.902, Speaker A: Know that the l one tokens, the.
00:10:08.918 - 00:10:23.350, Speaker C: Big tokens, are less risky than the tokens of specific protocols. And we know that the stable coins are the least riskier ones. So the more of these you have, the less risky. And the more of these you have.
00:10:23.382 - 00:10:25.394, Speaker A: The more risky is your portfolio.
00:10:26.054 - 00:10:34.010, Speaker C: And for now, we offer just one portfolio, which is the moderate portfolio. And this is the composition of the three of them.
00:10:34.042 - 00:10:36.218, Speaker A: You can see the location, the percentages.
00:10:36.306 - 00:10:37.634, Speaker C: As we can see, as it's moderate.
00:10:37.674 - 00:10:40.594, Speaker A: It has a lot of the USD.
00:10:40.634 - 00:10:43.050, Speaker C: Coin and the arch blockchains, it has.
00:10:43.082 - 00:10:50.174, Speaker A: USD, not the other index we had, because we built this portfolio before having the yield token.
00:10:50.834 - 00:10:58.346, Speaker C: And you can trade with any currency that you have right now, matic USD coin, you can deposit with USDC, with cash or card.
00:10:58.370 - 00:11:01.922, Speaker A: We have an oramp partner that allows us to do this.
00:11:02.098 - 00:11:07.602, Speaker C: And as you can see, all of these tokens that you buy are held in your wallet, is completely decentralized.
00:11:07.698 - 00:11:18.374, Speaker A: So you can trust that nothing can happen. Only smart contract exploits can maybe provoke some sort of problem with the platform.
00:11:18.714 - 00:11:25.490, Speaker C: So this is the platform, and yeah, you can check it out yourself. Also, another interesting thing that I don't know how many of you may be.
00:11:25.522 - 00:11:27.014, Speaker A: Interested in, but.
00:11:28.834 - 00:11:37.186, Speaker C: In terms of financial stuff, is the intelligence side that we have. Which is what I talked to you about before. All of the classification of the tokens.
00:11:37.330 - 00:11:40.946, Speaker A: That exist in crypto, in Coingecko, and.
00:11:40.970 - 00:11:44.734, Speaker C: You can see all of the indexes that we have built. This is the tokens that we offer.
00:11:45.514 - 00:11:47.570, Speaker A: And yeah, if you want to see.
00:11:47.602 - 00:11:48.906, Speaker C: More of the financial side of the.
00:11:48.930 - 00:12:00.054, Speaker A: Stuff, this may interest you. And if not, it's just like the products that you can buy in the platform. Okay, now, any questions until now?
00:12:00.134 - 00:12:03.074, Speaker C: Or we can go into the smart contracts and show you how it's built.
00:12:06.054 - 00:12:08.414, Speaker A: Yeah, we wanted to build a very.
00:12:08.454 - 00:12:23.734, Speaker C: Smooth platform so people can like enjoy the use of it to buy, to like use it frequently to buy the token, sell the token, see their performances of the, of all their portfolio. You can see like the beginning balance, you can see everything, how it's working.
00:12:24.194 - 00:12:48.134, Speaker D: I wanted to ask you something to help people that will see this in the future. Can you please explain to us what is an index? What factors are taken in consideration when creating an index and if it's risky or less risky are the percentages. There's any math to that? That's, you know, there's any formula, get you that. Let's start with what is an index? I guess.
00:12:49.314 - 00:12:49.746, Speaker A: Sure.
00:12:49.810 - 00:13:18.406, Speaker C: Okay, so basically an index is a composition of different assets. The idea of an index is that you can diversify yourself instead of like for example, let's say you're buying only Ethereum. Sometimes it can be good to only buy Ethereum because you know that it's not that volatile. But maybe if you only buy Ethereum, you don't get the upside of altcoins, because we know that altcoins sometimes give.
00:13:18.430 - 00:13:20.854, Speaker A: You more, more returns than Ethereum.
00:13:21.014 - 00:13:25.398, Speaker C: So if you want to like manage that, but you don't know which token to buy, you don't have the time.
00:13:25.446 - 00:13:27.394, Speaker A: To do the, like the research.
00:13:28.054 - 00:13:32.314, Speaker C: The index is the product that you're looking for because it provides you like.
00:13:32.694 - 00:13:36.076, Speaker A: A set of tokens that the market.
00:13:36.190 - 00:13:39.056, Speaker C: That according to a certain methodology have.
00:13:39.080 - 00:13:43.344, Speaker A: Been chosen to like be the tokens that, I don't know, have the most.
00:13:43.384 - 00:13:56.912, Speaker C: Liquidity, are the most trustable, have expected good returns, and different like parameters. And that's why you can compose an index, which is basically like a basket of different assets. That's, that's the definition of an index.
00:13:57.008 - 00:14:04.724, Speaker D: And usually your second question was usually how big is the basket? Because let's say.
00:14:05.064 - 00:14:11.568, Speaker C: Yeah, good question, good question. It depends, it depends on what you aim to do with the basket.
00:14:11.616 - 00:14:13.400, Speaker A: So for example, as you can see.
00:14:13.432 - 00:14:17.880, Speaker C: Here, this is the indexes that we offer. If you look at this one, this.
00:14:17.912 - 00:14:21.444, Speaker A: One has just four tokens, you see?
00:14:22.064 - 00:14:23.328, Speaker C: But if you go to the other.
00:14:23.376 - 00:14:29.156, Speaker A: Products that we offer, which is this one, you can see that the location has, like, tons of different tokens.
00:14:29.180 - 00:14:34.348, Speaker C: That's diff. 17, you see, and different percentages are 2%, 3%, 4%.
00:14:34.516 - 00:14:37.396, Speaker A: So it's because the type of token.
00:14:37.420 - 00:14:45.556, Speaker C: That you want to reach, it's the. What determines how much tokens you have. And also you can, like, say, okay, so I want the top five projects, for example.
00:14:45.620 - 00:14:47.244, Speaker A: Then it will be like five, maybe.
00:14:47.284 - 00:14:48.824, Speaker C: It depends on what you want to.
00:14:49.164 - 00:14:54.504, Speaker A: What's your aim with the, with the, with the index token?
00:14:56.534 - 00:15:05.874, Speaker D: That's really interesting, you know, and how do you know if there's any difference from web3 indexes to web two to traditional stock indices? You know.
00:15:09.014 - 00:15:15.454, Speaker C: There'S not that many, like, differences, like, in financial terms, because they.
00:15:15.494 - 00:15:17.034, Speaker A: Both follow the same rules.
00:15:17.494 - 00:15:27.804, Speaker C: I mean, I think the difference is that the space of indexes in crypto is not that yet developed. It's not that many people buy indexes right now.
00:15:27.844 - 00:15:29.664, Speaker A: It's not that big of a market.
00:15:30.004 - 00:15:46.940, Speaker C: But in the traditional financial world, it's huge. And in crypto, it hasn't taken off yet. So that's why we're building this, because we believe it's something that's necessary. And it also helps a lot of normies or people who want to get into crypto buy good products and diversified products.
00:15:47.012 - 00:15:49.936, Speaker A: Because sometimes, as someone who wants to.
00:15:49.960 - 00:15:52.568, Speaker C: I don't know if you have a friend that you want to maybe tell.
00:15:52.616 - 00:15:55.176, Speaker A: Him to, like, get into crypto, he.
00:15:55.200 - 00:16:03.216, Speaker C: Has no clue what to buy. He has. He has maybe no time to, like, go to Twitter, get the alpha, see what token to buy, and, like, stuff like that.
00:16:03.240 - 00:16:13.674, Speaker A: And that's why we offer these type of products, because as it follows a specific, like, financial research, you know, it's a, like, good product.
00:16:13.864 - 00:16:17.294, Speaker D: Really nice, man. Really interesting. For real, like, really interesting.
00:16:17.374 - 00:16:18.554, Speaker A: Keep going, keep going.
00:16:20.814 - 00:16:24.674, Speaker C: And I think you had two other questions, but I forgot which ones they were.
00:16:25.854 - 00:16:34.910, Speaker D: The other question I had is, when building these indexes, you need to take in consideration, you know, risk factors for each one of the assets.
00:16:35.102 - 00:16:36.830, Speaker C: There's a. Yeah, yeah.
00:16:36.902 - 00:16:44.354, Speaker D: There's a mathematical rule to do that, or it's just like, someone sits down with a lot of knowledge, you know, like fundamental analysis, you know?
00:16:45.654 - 00:16:46.102, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:46.158 - 00:17:26.533, Speaker C: So we have the docs, the archdocs, and here you can see all of the, all of the methodology that we use to build the tokens. And you can read this here, I'm not an expert in this because, well, I want to like more technical side, not the financial side. So this is, I don't know exactly any much of this, but the main factor that we have is the eligibility. So the main factors to say a token can be considered to be in an index. How much this token is traded, how much liquidity does it has? What's the market capitalization, for example? It has to have more than 50 million in market capitalization. It has to be traded.
00:17:27.633 - 00:17:28.977, Speaker A: I don't know an example.
00:17:29.065 - 00:17:36.744, Speaker C: I don't know how much that really interesting. It has to be traded a certain amount every day. There has to be a trade volume.
00:17:37.764 - 00:17:40.412, Speaker A: And those are the main requirements for.
00:17:40.428 - 00:17:49.796, Speaker C: It to be considered to be part of an index because these markers tell you that it's a good token that people actually want. Okay.
00:17:49.820 - 00:17:50.932, Speaker D: Okay, bro. It makes a lot of sense.
00:17:50.988 - 00:17:54.664, Speaker C: You can read all of the research that we have here.
00:17:56.524 - 00:17:59.212, Speaker A: It's completely open in our docs, and.
00:17:59.268 - 00:18:04.464, Speaker C: This is the atcs, which is the classification standard. And you can see how we divided the tokens.
00:18:05.314 - 00:18:09.682, Speaker D: Are you one of the founders or no? Okay.
00:18:09.778 - 00:18:12.986, Speaker A: No, I'm a core, core developer, but.
00:18:13.010 - 00:18:14.698, Speaker C: I was in charge of building most.
00:18:14.746 - 00:18:17.826, Speaker A: Of the protocol, which is my contracts.
00:18:17.850 - 00:18:18.414, Speaker C: And.
00:18:20.194 - 00:18:21.050, Speaker D: I want to see that.
00:18:21.082 - 00:18:23.426, Speaker A: Let's go. You want to see the code?
00:18:23.450 - 00:18:24.746, Speaker C: Okay, let's go to the code.
00:18:24.890 - 00:18:29.522, Speaker A: That's my domain. Okay. Yeah.
00:18:29.658 - 00:18:34.944, Speaker C: And here we have all the contracts that you can see of the tokens. But let's go to the GitHub.
00:18:36.084 - 00:18:39.244, Speaker A: So arch protocol chambers.
00:18:39.324 - 00:18:49.012, Speaker C: This is the, what the repo is called. This is public because it was audited, and people have to be able to look at the code to trust it and be able to, like, see it.
00:18:49.028 - 00:18:52.164, Speaker A: For themselves if there's no box or stuff like that.
00:18:52.324 - 00:18:53.984, Speaker C: We were audited by.
00:19:00.174 - 00:19:02.114, Speaker A: I know the term called Nomoi.
00:19:02.454 - 00:19:03.654, Speaker C: I don't know if you've heard of them.
00:19:03.694 - 00:19:07.774, Speaker A: They're building what's called a tool for.
00:19:07.854 - 00:19:13.046, Speaker C: Developing tests in foundry called Vulcan. It's pretty interesting.
00:19:13.190 - 00:19:22.622, Speaker A: I think they're on Twitter somewhere. But I can maybe send you the.
00:19:22.638 - 00:19:23.902, Speaker C: Link of them if you want to.
00:19:23.918 - 00:19:30.868, Speaker A: Check them out as to what they do. So, yeah, this is the chambers repository.
00:19:30.956 - 00:19:56.814, Speaker C: Of how we build the smart contracts. I can maybe show you. First of all, this is the smart contract architecture. It's maybe verbose has a lot of pips, but it's funnier that way. This is what we used to initialize how we wanted to build the smart contracts. So basically the way it works is that we have a lot of wizards which are in charge of different operations.
00:19:56.894 - 00:19:59.434, Speaker A: In the, in the tokens.
00:20:00.294 - 00:20:06.206, Speaker C: The main core of this one is these two. The first one is the chamber. A chamber is just a token, an.
00:20:06.230 - 00:20:18.736, Speaker A: Index token that holds in itself components. So as you can see, it's a chamber has instate components. We can see the code.
00:20:18.880 - 00:20:20.536, Speaker C: I'll be going back and forward between.
00:20:20.600 - 00:20:24.424, Speaker A: This diagram and the code to tell.
00:20:24.464 - 00:20:25.352, Speaker C: You everything about it.
00:20:25.368 - 00:20:30.784, Speaker A: So this is the chamber, the main component of the protocol. The chamber.
00:20:30.824 - 00:20:33.208, Speaker C: Basically, it's a smart contract that.
00:20:33.336 - 00:20:40.896, Speaker A: It's an ERC 20 that's allowed to hold constituents, which is the different part.
00:20:41.000 - 00:20:42.604, Speaker C: Constraints of the token.
00:20:42.704 - 00:20:45.596, Speaker A: Like for example, if I go back.
00:20:45.620 - 00:20:50.292, Speaker C: To Arch and I see like the Ethereum web3, the constituents are all.
00:20:50.308 - 00:20:55.940, Speaker A: Of these and in a like, grouped in addresses and by how much.
00:20:56.052 - 00:20:57.396, Speaker C: Like, as you can see, this number.
00:20:57.460 - 00:21:03.236, Speaker A: Here, wait, I went back to this number here is the amount per token.
00:21:03.300 - 00:21:05.356, Speaker C: Like in one unit of, like the.
00:21:05.380 - 00:21:07.624, Speaker A: Index token, you have this amount of unit.
00:21:08.064 - 00:21:11.696, Speaker C: So we had to manage all of those quantities. When people want to mint, people want.
00:21:11.720 - 00:21:19.264, Speaker A: To redeem and stuff like that. So, yeah, so this is all the.
00:21:19.304 - 00:21:22.240, Speaker C: Main storages that the contract has to have.
00:21:22.352 - 00:21:26.104, Speaker A: It has to have the constituents, the constituent quantities.
00:21:26.224 - 00:21:34.204, Speaker C: Then we have the wizards and the managers. The managers are all the allowed wallets that can perform actions on the.
00:21:35.104 - 00:21:36.152, Speaker A: The chamber.
00:21:36.328 - 00:21:48.964, Speaker C: The wizards allow you to. It's like mods or extensions which allow you to do specific things on the, on the chamber. Allowed contracts is what contracts you can perform actions with from the chamber.
00:21:50.664 - 00:21:51.312, Speaker A: And.
00:21:51.448 - 00:21:52.152, Speaker C: Yeah, this is.
00:21:52.208 - 00:21:55.264, Speaker A: Sorry, yeah, sorry, I got a question.
00:21:55.424 - 00:21:57.896, Speaker B: A chamber, it's an index.
00:21:58.040 - 00:22:00.684, Speaker A: Yeah, a chamber is an index. Perfect.
00:22:02.924 - 00:22:13.348, Speaker C: So this is the main part of the chamber. It has the wizards and you can add constituent, you can remove constituents. Who then you can, like, who has.
00:22:13.396 - 00:22:16.184, Speaker D: The custody of the tokens?
00:22:17.324 - 00:22:21.812, Speaker C: It's in the smart contract. We, we don't have any custody on the.
00:22:21.908 - 00:22:25.516, Speaker D: But it's the chamber contract or.
00:22:25.700 - 00:22:28.244, Speaker C: Yeah, the chamber contract holds all of the tokens.
00:22:30.384 - 00:22:32.204, Speaker D: Is this audited already?
00:22:33.064 - 00:22:33.976, Speaker C: Yeah, it's audited.
00:22:34.040 - 00:22:34.804, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:22:35.744 - 00:22:37.084, Speaker C: So if you go to.
00:22:37.824 - 00:22:51.444, Speaker A: Let me check. I have to find the addresses. Maybe the addresses are here, for example. Let me, let me find the.
00:23:02.484 - 00:23:09.144, Speaker C: I'll show it afterwards. The, like, the contract address deployed in Polygon. I don't have it right now. I'll find later.
00:23:10.204 - 00:23:13.972, Speaker A: And then we have the chamber. Go.
00:23:14.028 - 00:23:44.342, Speaker C: This is what the people interact with, will interact with in our platform when they. Maybe they can. For now, we don't have this feature allowed. We are the only ones allowed to create new chambers. But then we want to open it so that people can start building their own index tokens for whatever purpose they want. Maybe you just have a specific strategy that you follow every day and you want to maybe automatize it and have it in an index. So you start just minting that index and it buys all the tokens that.
00:23:44.358 - 00:23:48.590, Speaker A: You want for you. So that's why the chamber God was created.
00:23:48.622 - 00:23:51.006, Speaker C: So it creates the specific chambers that.
00:23:51.030 - 00:23:54.894, Speaker A: People can buy can.
00:23:54.974 - 00:23:55.734, Speaker C: Simple as that.
00:23:55.774 - 00:24:07.834, Speaker D: Can I make a boring question for you? But maybe, and you don't have to have the answer because this could really be like something stupid. But what if one of the tokens inside the chamber is compromised?
00:24:10.494 - 00:24:29.310, Speaker C: Yeah, so, yeah, we have that under control. We made a lot of tests on the audit based on vulnerable ERC twenty.
00:24:29.342 - 00:24:32.422, Speaker A: S, and for now, we have found.
00:24:32.478 - 00:24:38.286, Speaker C: No problems removing them or adding them. Like, for example, if a person wanted.
00:24:38.310 - 00:24:44.996, Speaker A: To trade a token and like, I don't know, there's a call to, I don't know, dry the smart contract and.
00:24:45.020 - 00:25:25.712, Speaker C: Removal of the tokens. That's not possible because of some like, restrictions that we put on the, on the smart contract. Yeah, no, no, token. Like we want like the tokens that we built as the protocol, as arch. We ensure that the tokens that we are adding to the smart contracts are not vulnerable for that. We also have the requirement of like the 50 million trading volume and like market cap and stuff like that. But yeah, we know that it can happen that maybe, I don't know, a user wants to mint their own chamber and maybe they, by mistake, who knows.
00:25:25.848 - 00:25:29.448, Speaker A: Added like vulnerable ERC 20.
00:25:29.576 - 00:25:35.526, Speaker C: Yeah, we have that key case in mind and we have like, dealt with that problem in the code.
00:25:35.670 - 00:25:47.034, Speaker D: And how does one add liquidity? I mean, when I buy the token automatically, the smart contract, buy all the underlying assets or how that process happens.
00:25:47.694 - 00:25:48.846, Speaker A: Yeah, great question.
00:25:48.910 - 00:25:51.994, Speaker C: Because that's why. That's where the wizards come.
00:25:53.014 - 00:25:54.034, Speaker A: Normally.
00:25:55.734 - 00:26:10.754, Speaker C: To create a chamber, you need to have all of the tokens in your wallet. So that's not efficient. And that's pretty like, nobody wants to do that. So that's why we created these two wizards. This one allows you to just mint.
00:26:12.054 - 00:26:15.878, Speaker A: The mint the token having all of the components.
00:26:16.046 - 00:26:26.302, Speaker C: And this one is the most interesting one because this one allows you to just buy mint the chamber from, let's say, ethereum, and it performs all of.
00:26:26.318 - 00:26:29.172, Speaker A: The swaps for you, performs all of.
00:26:29.188 - 00:26:36.252, Speaker C: The traits needed to get the tokens that are part of the index token that you want to part of the chamber, for example.
00:26:36.388 - 00:26:42.624, Speaker D: And does this swapping happen? So how you guys deal with the exchanges, how you guys select those?
00:26:44.164 - 00:26:50.020, Speaker A: Oh yeah. So we have to calculate all of.
00:26:50.052 - 00:26:53.060, Speaker C: That in a, in a frontend that we have, it performs all of the.
00:26:53.132 - 00:27:02.636, Speaker A: It says, like for example, okay, let's say you want to mint the chamber from USDc and there's like five tokens.
00:27:02.700 - 00:27:15.664, Speaker C: And there's different exchanges in which they have to buy. For now we're using these exchange aggregators like Xerox and Pyroswap.
00:27:16.204 - 00:27:18.788, Speaker A: Those give you the most efficient routes.
00:27:18.836 - 00:27:19.972, Speaker C: To buy all of the tokens we.
00:27:19.988 - 00:27:23.158, Speaker A: Need for the, for the chambers, for.
00:27:23.206 - 00:27:32.966, Speaker C: Specific tokens that cannot be bought. Like for example, vault tokens that you have to deposit the token in a smart contract to get like a receipt.
00:27:33.150 - 00:27:39.766, Speaker A: Like for example, if a component is of a USDC, we also need to.
00:27:39.950 - 00:27:53.404, Speaker C: Get the specific function call in the contract to perform that type of operation. And all of that has to be calculated from outside the smart contract. Like we created a frontend.
00:27:55.624 - 00:27:56.384, Speaker A: For users.
00:27:56.424 - 00:28:08.164, Speaker C: To mint any token they want and it will fetch all of the codes needed, all of the function calls needed to get all of the tokens needed for the chamber.
00:28:08.744 - 00:28:12.444, Speaker D: Really nice, man, really nice. Do you guys plan to offer flashlights?
00:28:14.444 - 00:28:15.252, Speaker A: How so?
00:28:15.388 - 00:28:17.664, Speaker D: You guys plan to offer flash allowance?
00:28:20.724 - 00:28:22.692, Speaker C: No, no, we don't use flash loans.
00:28:22.828 - 00:28:34.436, Speaker D: Because you know, as you have all these tokens could be maybe a viable business model for you guys to offer flash loans from the chambers. But ah, you understand.
00:28:34.580 - 00:28:39.582, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I got your point. Yeah, no, never thought of that. Yeah, that's interesting.
00:28:39.708 - 00:28:50.490, Speaker A: Maybe we can, wow, that's a, yeah, yeah, we'll put like a little misantropic.
00:28:50.522 - 00:28:53.306, Speaker C: There name in the like you can.
00:28:53.330 - 00:29:00.774, Speaker D: Give like zero, 3% like Uniswap does and just offer flash loans and then you have one more way to, to make money.
00:29:01.474 - 00:29:02.130, Speaker A: Great question.
00:29:02.202 - 00:29:03.586, Speaker C: Yeah, great, great.
00:29:03.770 - 00:29:04.226, Speaker A: Nice.
00:29:04.290 - 00:29:05.134, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:29:05.314 - 00:29:06.354, Speaker A: Yeah, cool.
00:29:07.574 - 00:29:25.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I got a question, another question. The collateral token is minted on the fly or they're seized on a liquidity pool, kind of liquidity pool of the allocations. How the collateral token works.
00:29:26.134 - 00:29:34.116, Speaker C: So it depends. It depends. For example, if you have a liquid token that's like, I don't know, collateral.
00:29:34.180 - 00:29:36.556, Speaker A: Is ethereum, you can just buy Ethereum.
00:29:36.620 - 00:29:43.572, Speaker C: From Adex or anywhere. Depends on the token that you want to mint. So let's say the case is you.
00:29:43.588 - 00:29:45.460, Speaker A: Want to mint a chamber that has.
00:29:45.492 - 00:30:03.886, Speaker C: Only ethereum and you have USDC. Then to mint it you have to buy the USDC from a Dex and then you put it as collateral and mint the chamber. Then for tokens that are not liquid that you cannot buy in the dex, those require specific actions. So for example, this token that we.
00:30:03.910 - 00:30:08.314, Speaker A: Have right here, not this one, but.
00:30:09.094 - 00:30:17.998, Speaker C: This one, this one has allocation the yvault of Dai, USDC and USDT. The new yearn volts of v, I.
00:30:18.006 - 00:30:19.114, Speaker A: Think it's v three.
00:30:19.494 - 00:30:21.394, Speaker C: So it's not the ones that were hacked.
00:30:22.014 - 00:30:25.826, Speaker A: But yeah, to use these vaults, you.
00:30:25.850 - 00:30:28.322, Speaker C: Just have to call the deposit method with the token.
00:30:28.378 - 00:30:31.210, Speaker A: So the process is, for example, for.
00:30:31.242 - 00:30:36.242, Speaker C: This specific thing, if you want to buy with USDC, you have to.
00:30:36.258 - 00:30:38.122, Speaker A: First you buy the die and then.
00:30:38.138 - 00:30:40.554, Speaker C: You put it in the vault without the function call.
00:30:40.634 - 00:30:42.346, Speaker A: You put the boss in, and then.
00:30:42.370 - 00:30:45.402, Speaker C: You get the collateral and then you put it on the chamber. Then you do the same thing with.
00:30:45.418 - 00:30:47.426, Speaker A: USDC, where if you have, you have.
00:30:47.450 - 00:30:48.898, Speaker C: Already USDC, you just put it in.
00:30:48.906 - 00:30:50.982, Speaker A: The vault and you don't have USD.
00:30:51.038 - 00:30:52.758, Speaker C: You have to buy it from a dex, and then you put it in.
00:30:52.766 - 00:30:55.086, Speaker A: The vault and then you get all three collaterals.
00:30:55.150 - 00:30:57.406, Speaker C: And then you can mint the chamber, and then you get the unit of.
00:30:57.430 - 00:30:59.474, Speaker A: The chamber in your wallet.
00:31:02.094 - 00:31:02.834, Speaker C: Nice.
00:31:03.494 - 00:31:13.834, Speaker D: One more question regarding the auditing process. Were you there at that point and was it complicated? A lot of findings, any surprises that you had?
00:31:15.354 - 00:31:21.026, Speaker C: Oh, what was the first question regarding the auditing process?
00:31:21.130 - 00:31:32.334, Speaker D: I mean, if you were one of the core developers during the auditing process, and if you had any surprises with the findings, any things that, you know, any important, you know, feedback?
00:31:32.834 - 00:32:06.336, Speaker C: Yeah, it was very interesting. They found, I think, four high vulnerabilities. We fixed all of them. There were specific cases that, like, didn't apply to the products we were building. It was very interesting, like the different methods they used to find vulnerabilities which were stuff that we didn't thought of. But yeah, it was a very interesting process. That's why I got very interested in starting myself, the path of becoming auditor myself.
00:32:06.440 - 00:32:20.604, Speaker D: Nice, man. I love it. I love the product, I love the smart contracts. I don't know if anybody has any questions, but for me, it's pretty good. What do you guys think? I like it.
00:32:25.984 - 00:32:26.392, Speaker C: Bro.
00:32:26.448 - 00:32:39.084, Speaker D: Thank you so much. And also, we're going to be able to trade the swap, the index tokens, right? I can go on uniswap swap and just trade that?
00:32:39.164 - 00:32:40.220, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:32:40.292 - 00:32:40.572, Speaker A: We.
00:32:40.628 - 00:32:47.188, Speaker C: For now, we like, in our front end, you can, you can buy it from here. You can trade it like, like format to buy.
00:32:47.236 - 00:32:48.504, Speaker A: I don't know, this one.
00:32:49.044 - 00:32:51.868, Speaker C: And because we have liquidity pools on.
00:32:51.956 - 00:32:55.332, Speaker A: Uniswap and you can just buy it.
00:32:55.348 - 00:33:00.624, Speaker C: From here, but it's also on Uniswap, you can just find it. I don't think we have the links.
00:33:01.844 - 00:33:05.964, Speaker A: Let me check. So details.
00:33:08.184 - 00:33:22.160, Speaker C: So we have the address of the tokens in restrictive networks, but I don't think we have the links to the Uniswap pools. Maybe we can add them afterwards. But yeah, they're all of the liquidity of these tokens in Uniswap B, three ports.
00:33:22.232 - 00:33:36.584, Speaker D: How does the price rebasing happens? Like what if a token gets hacked and goes like 90% down? Some pool got hacked, nor not necessarily the token. So somebody was selling a lot of tokens. How does the pricing, eBay happens.
00:33:38.564 - 00:33:50.704, Speaker C: So the pricing is mainly based on the collateral. So the price is, it just follows the price of the allocations of the tokens. So for example.
00:33:52.684 - 00:33:56.876, Speaker A: Yeah, there's. Yeah, yeah, we track the prices that way.
00:33:57.020 - 00:34:05.796, Speaker C: That's exactly. An interesting problem that we have is that there's disparity all of the time between the liquidity pools and the minting.
00:34:05.940 - 00:34:13.744, Speaker A: Because, for example, if the token, I don't know, let's say this one. So this one right now is 184.
00:34:14.044 - 00:34:31.088, Speaker C: But for example, if the token inside goes up in price, then it reaches $2. If nobody bought that token in the pool, it will stay at 184 in the pool because nobody bought it. So it's at the tick in the liquidity. So there's that price disparity that people.
00:34:31.136 - 00:34:35.032, Speaker A: Can like get advantage of to like.
00:34:35.088 - 00:34:37.544, Speaker C: Do some math, some arbitrage.
00:34:37.704 - 00:34:39.804, Speaker A: That's an interesting problem that we face.
00:34:46.284 - 00:34:57.252, Speaker C: Oh no, just like if you're interested, combine the tokens we offer. It's very nice to be have some sort of index in your portfolio. It's good financially.
00:34:57.388 - 00:34:59.484, Speaker A: So, no, nothing.
00:34:59.524 - 00:35:13.454, Speaker C: I invite you to come use the platform and maybe show it to your friends that are scared to invest in crypto and they don't know what to buy, they can come here and start getting themselves in wedding, what's called crypto world.
00:35:17.354 - 00:35:19.618, Speaker D: So thank you so much and see you later.
00:35:19.706 - 00:35:24.654, Speaker C: Okay, thank you. Bye bye guys, for having me.
