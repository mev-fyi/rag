00:00:00.800 - 00:00:54.972, Speaker A: Hello guys, one more fast tip today. And today we're looking at one given by Rajkumar when he states that whenever defining an enum, the default value is always the first. In his example that he keeps here, given the order of the enums, the active will always be set to all the elements in his mapping. So let's take a look here on how that looks in the code. So here we have this conceptual whitelist that is used to control who gets and who not gets into a NFT presale. So let's just consider that I'm just going to deploy this contract right now and let's take a look at the functions. We have a function to set the user status takes the address of the user and the status if he can or cannot participate.
00:00:54.972 - 00:01:26.076, Speaker A: In the presale we have a user, a function to check if the user is actually allowed. So this user is looking at the allow list passing in the user that we sent and verifying if he's allowed. Curious thing here is if I just copy any address like this one and check it, it will be true by default. And this is wrong. Shouldn't be the case. We just deployed the contract. We never did a call to actually go and set this user to true.
00:01:26.076 - 00:02:01.424, Speaker A: And this is all happening because the way we order our emails here, ideally the email should start by not allowed. That way all users would have zero by default when verifying their statuses. So let's take a look at that. So now if I verify the same user, again, false. So remember, ordering is important when dealing with unknowns, especially talking about statuses. Okay, see you guys.
