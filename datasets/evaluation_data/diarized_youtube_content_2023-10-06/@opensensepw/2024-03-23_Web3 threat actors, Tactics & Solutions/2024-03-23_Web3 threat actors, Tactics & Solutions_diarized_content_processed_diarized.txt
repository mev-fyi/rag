00:00:04.480 - 00:00:49.330, Speaker A: Hey, folks, litendscore invited me to share with you some of the stuff that I do day to day, which is threat intelligence. And I hope I can share something special with you today, something unusual, and that's information about threat act. Basically talking about who are we building defenses against, what are we protecting? It gets and what we should focus. So feel free to queue up questions. I'll watch those. And let's get into it just a little bit. Background about me I am a part of onbase unit zero x, but we are a team of researchers watching investigators.
00:00:49.330 - 00:01:48.718, Speaker A: We try to understand what's happening in the ecosystem, who gets compromised, how and what defense it needs to be built, and also the author about the blockchain credit Intelligence newsletter, where I do pretty much the same thing, where week after week I track who is the uncompromised, what is the latest blockchain security research and trying to share it with the community. So to help inform for the last more than four years. So, I mean, the pasta. Did malware versus engineering and team at the time resurface? A quick summary of what are we going to discuss today. So first we're going to talk about what is threat intelligence as a practice and why it's useful to you as an auditor, why it's useful to you as a defender. If you build a project, we'll talk about specific threat actor ttps. So ttps are tactics, techniques and procedures.
00:01:48.718 - 00:02:12.022, Speaker A: We'll discuss that in a bit. Let's talk about why it's very important to build. And just think about security, not just in general, like, see what sticks, but like really intelligence driven to give you a better focus and effectiveness. And we'll talk about future trends. All we got. Okay, let's talk about threat intelligence. First things first.
00:02:12.022 - 00:02:49.304, Speaker A: Threat intelligence is a source of actionable, actionable truth on adversary tactics, techniques and procedures. The key here is actionable. We don't want to just talk about, hey, like, this attacker does this and, you know, these are the techniques that they use and this is how they launder their funds. And this is how, you know, they, they try to get in. It's very important to give actual feedback to products that you're trying to defend, to say, what is it that you can actually do? Or if you're an auditorium, what is it that you really should focus on? Because that's what attackers are doing. So you want to, if you want to save a project, you can't look at every possible thing. You have to focus.
00:02:49.304 - 00:04:09.104, Speaker A: So what as a threat intelligence analyst, what you do is you definitely track all unchecked incidents, you allies, what do attackers do exactly? What is the exploitation vector ideal? Like price or manipulation, or idea like dropping malware in your machines? Or are they taking over your social media accounts and so on. You track the full funds, see where they end up. So different attackers, they have different preferences for where they launder their assets, where they, which bridges they use, which change they use, which exchanges. And then you come up with, as I mentioned, actionable intelligence, which is like, what is the actual outcome of your research? What can you learn from it? You said the outcome, why you understand who you're dealing, right? You can't fences without knowing who your adversaries. Then you can, once you understand who they are, you can prioritize where you have limited resources. If you're working with a project, you're advising them, you can tell the budget, why don't you invest a budget to defend against this adversary and these techniques, as opposed to just depending on everything possible, and then we can also prepare for the response. No, no, defenses are 100%.
00:04:09.104 - 00:04:34.954, Speaker A: So at the very least, you know who your adversaries are and you have some idea of how they operate and what you can do in case of an incident, then it also helps set expectations. So if you're hoping to recover money from like nation state fair actor, like North Korea, that could happen. If you're dealing with like maybe a lone wolf researcher, maybe there's some techniques that you can use to help you recover.
00:04:36.654 - 00:04:44.874, Speaker B: That's really interesting, Roy, so far. Yeah, I mean, very interesting talk. I have a question about the Federal Reserve, red team. What's that?
00:04:46.894 - 00:05:45.382, Speaker A: Federal Reserve. So Federal Reserve is a central bank of the United States. Basically, this is. This is the partnership US treasure union, which is responsible for the monetary policy in the United States. Red team, is it with compositions you have? Hey, this is its scope. And this is either scope. Do this, but don't do that.
00:05:45.382 - 00:05:47.146, Speaker A: You have that with red tv.
00:05:47.290 - 00:05:47.858, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:05:47.946 - 00:06:05.410, Speaker A: You have. You have a goal. Like you need to take over banks president's computer and how you deal with this, man. Are you going to troll through the air ducts and get in their office? You know plenty, you know, in this b key or key logger or something like that. Do it. Or h and e need to.
00:06:05.562 - 00:06:07.690, Speaker B: That's awesome. Do that.
00:06:07.762 - 00:06:18.486, Speaker A: So they're not. I need. There's some rules, but they're very few rules. You have an objective, you're stipulating not a hypothetical attacker, but a real attacker who can basically do whatever the hell.
00:06:18.510 - 00:06:22.194, Speaker B: They want to that's with amazing man.
00:06:25.214 - 00:07:06.624, Speaker A: So that's maybe that's a separate topic to discuss with like about the stand of I guess audit industry within DeFi. And like all the competitions, they're very like projects are very scared about like opening up the gates to or you know, for participants to do what needs to be done. And that comes from I think misunderstanding of what, what threat actors actually do and the degree to which they can go. They would target you. But that's why I think it's important to look at talks like this to get some exposure of their capabilities because it goes a lot beyond the standard spark contract attacks.
00:07:11.184 - 00:07:12.004, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:07:15.064 - 00:07:21.824, Speaker A: Okay, any other questions on threat intelligence? I can dive into some profiles of the tabs otherwise.
00:07:21.984 - 00:07:24.964, Speaker B: Yeah, let's, let's dive into it. Let's leave the questions to the end.
00:07:26.064 - 00:08:04.482, Speaker A: Sure. Keep tracking up. Okay, so let's talk about who are the actual, who are these folks? Well, they classify them in roughly four categories. The first lot, that's probably who we're thinking of the most. When we think of who's attacking DeFi projects and the, you know, the shadowy super colors as this is the FD that you get by the way. And these are, that's basically us. This is you the auditor.
00:08:04.482 - 00:08:40.636, Speaker A: This is you being a DeFi developer, highly capable in terms of development. They understand solidity, they understand development environment of how to deploy contracts. They have strong security capabilities as well. Then we have criminal apts. These are hardened criminals. They for decades they traditionally operate things like ransomware, they credit cards. And obviously now that they're watching the crypto summer then like ha, that's where the money's at.
00:08:40.636 - 00:09:14.334, Speaker A: So let's focus on that. So they're bringing both loads of experience and I guess knowledge of how to attack systems to this new domain. Then of course we have nation state apt. He said, when we talk about Asia state apts, we basically talk about North Korea. These are state sponsored actors who are given a sign that they're usually in the military. They're told this is your job now. You need to deliver x amount of millions of dollars per month or per year.
00:09:14.334 - 00:10:19.066, Speaker A: And last but not least is just something to consider is an insider trick. You know, you have someone who is just pissed off, you know, working for you and wants to do some damage or just someone who feels they're, they deserve more and they start stealing from just enforce the large privilege is there on the inside. These are roughly four categories. So what we're going to do is we got to look for a few case studies for each of these categories and pay attention to why, the type of techniques that they use to target projects, how they get caught and pay attention to what would you do to catch an attacker like that. Let's talk about shadowy supercoolers. This is probably what we hear about the most, some examples. So obviously, the Raju Khan apple.
00:10:19.066 - 00:10:41.454, Speaker A: That's epic story. The hack that they go for happened back in 2016. So there was no, like, there were no real smart contracts like that. And Ethereum was just born. So we talked about good old web two infrastructure exploitation. So that was in Bitfix, uh, that they sold $72 million from. I think it's worth like 10 billion at this point.
00:10:41.454 - 00:11:15.148, Speaker A: And again, the background of these folks are, you know, the techies, the coders, investors, uh, you know, they've been known in this. In the hatchet community before that they dabbed in, you know, targeted projects, but this was their big hit. And the way they got fathers, they. They were not very good at wondering. Stolen assets. They deposited some of their funds to Alphabet. That was the marketplace, I guess, dark web marketplace, which was seized by police.
00:11:15.148 - 00:11:49.454, Speaker A: And they just went through the entire list of who was participating in their marketplace and went after another participant. So after 20 years in jail, again, various, larger, technically as person, that's not a very good crypto. Then we have Toby. So this is the infamous the Dow hack, right? $3.6 billion. The first. Well, actually, the second instance of re entropy exploitation, the most well known one, obviously, this caused a big split.
00:11:49.454 - 00:12:12.444, Speaker A: And again, this is the blockchain developer ten X. Found their CEO. There's an amazing article written about him, like where they. How he got caught, exactly how they identified him. Basically, just. Just as the transaction anonymization evolves. So he used wasabi transactions.
00:12:12.444 - 00:12:30.736, Speaker A: They traced noodles. It also evolved so they were able to trace through. They got to the, uh, one of the. No searching, crashed with the fudge to and interacted with. Saw that it was also the same ip addresses. It's Aubrey, Project X. He still denies allegations.
00:12:30.736 - 00:12:41.624, Speaker A: I'm not sure where those with the law enforcement, but that was an amazing book, uh, by Lauren Land from Han. She published about this whole thing, so. Highly recommend it.
00:12:41.704 - 00:12:49.084, Speaker B: Yeah. One question, though. Uh, those values are not. Not updated, right? Like the Dell hack. These. Those are the old values, right?
00:12:50.384 - 00:13:00.336, Speaker A: Yeah. This is the shib values. Yes. But you can. You can definitely put it as that. Lesser than the belly.
00:13:00.440 - 00:13:01.244, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:13:04.944 - 00:13:29.104, Speaker A: Yeah. Whenever I'm tracking compromises, I always look at the value and the time of the compromise. Otherwise, the numbers just become insane crazy what we got. So we obviously are ambien. So this is the famous coders law arguments. So canadian kids. So he targeted index finance, $16 million.
00:13:29.104 - 00:14:24.662, Speaker A: This is another smart contract exploitation. So pool price manipulation that was back in 21 and again like smart kids, Nissan Canada back math major at University of Waterloo and again caught very good at exploitation, not very good at upset. The way he got caught was he was publicly discussed in the vulnerability before the act, addressed war in Canada and was certainly on the rot said he's a fugitive. Avi. Of course we have to mention Avi on that's the mega markets theme and the techniques that he used. It's price manipulation. And this background is he's just well known for pulling drugs in the past ought discussing vulnerability again in the chats.
00:14:24.662 - 00:15:18.894, Speaker A: Arrested up to 20 years in prison. Again, crypto native, not really hardened criminal, not trying to launder assets he was found out very quickly and then we know the rest of history. Bikini. So this is the nirvana and Crema hacker priority manipulation, reward manipulation in those two inches. And again, he's a security engineer, he's a security professional at Amazon. Just decided to go breakfast, so to say bat criminal caught wandering funds and googling things like what is the Defi hacks prosecution? How do we evade? What countries you can buy censorship from so bad OPSEC and arresting it up to five years prison. The latest one.
00:15:18.894 - 00:16:21.834, Speaker A: This is the most curious one, right? This is 2023, the pipe Maz hack again. Smart contracts exploit logic here valid x phenologic area. I think they locked up most of the funds that they stole, so they couldn't really get much out. And their background is their two french brothers, self sauds, crypto enthusiasts and again, bad criminals. COD foundry funds transacting with the KYC exchange so required belt to law enforcement arresting the foul not guilty because in France they do believe code is lost. I'm going to keep in mind this gives you just some profile, some information, just some high level thoughts about our train activists who are individual lone wolves or small groups really, who are targeted at DeFi projects. So they're financially ego motivated sometimes.
00:16:21.834 - 00:17:00.674, Speaker A: So ego sometimes you see those hunching messages. There's a lot of ego in there. Like, I remember a quote from the Kyber Schwab attacker where he said something like, you know, Mai is right. Like, yeah, there's like very strong belief. And what they did primarily smart contract attacks. So the first one was the exception just because weren't that many smart contracts back in 2016 and the DAO was the first big one, which kind of, like, showed everyone how you can target these systems as well. Usually get caught due to that OPSEC and just being careless while laundry funks.
00:17:00.674 - 00:17:39.064, Speaker A: And just to give you an idea of, like, the scope of it, most of the DeFi projects today, I think, are executed by basically one of us, which is crypto natives, developers watching security researchers. $1.3 billion sold from DeFi projects back in 2023 of this type. And they're more like 300 different hacks. So we're dealing with similar repeats, but around 300 individuals involved in this. Thoughts on shadowing super coders? Does this align with what you folks expected?
00:17:39.404 - 00:17:43.674, Speaker B: Yeah, very. That's very interesting. One of the best talks we had so far brought keep on.
00:17:45.614 - 00:18:11.074, Speaker A: All right, so things are about to get dark. So, you know, I'll look at shadow supercoders. You know, we're just exploring new territory. We're experimenting. We're doing. Sometimes we do stupid things, but now we're getting into darker things. So let's quickly talk about BFAD sense against them, and then we'll dive into other tractors.
00:18:11.074 - 00:18:57.584, Speaker A: How do you defend yourself against shadow supercoders? Well, audits, contests, for the love of God, please repeat those things on all changes that you make. A lot of projects don't really have unchained auditing or incident response programs, as in, basically know when you get hacked. Just at the very least know when a bunch of money starts moving away from your project. You don't want to find out that you get hacked because someone is tweeting at you and know what to do so you're not in complete shock. Practice whatever you build and think that you should do, practice it. The incident response should definitely both seal 911. If you're not familiar, look at Sam and CZ Sum's tweet, post and project.
00:18:57.584 - 00:19:33.906, Speaker A: That's the security alliance. Do the root cause analysis. Understand how you don't have do the on chain analysis. I would see negotiations. So this is where the end of this ransom negotiating issue where you say, hey, you can have 10% on 20% economy, like all the market, how much accuracy before they give back the rest? They usually work in legal and law enforcement action. They also work well. So we saw quite a few individuals get caught doing those attacks.
00:19:33.906 - 00:20:26.074, Speaker A: So law enforcement and I guess anchi investigators are becoming better and better at identifying perpetrators behind these attacks. So definitely consider referral to law enforcement. Okay, let's talk about insider threat. This is something that we don't think about. We always say of someone from the outside we have this, you know, native Castle is protected. We built so many defenses with watering everything, and then you forget you just hired someone who maybe is less ethical or malicious or maybe by design, they were trying to get a job on your place to steal money from you. So we know North Korea has been involved in trying to infiltrate the companies through fake identities, basically to get access without needing to hack anything.
00:20:26.074 - 00:21:13.062, Speaker A: I'll just cover one example. So this individual was part of full finance this last year that had permissions to the smart contract, updated the rights to redirect the funds that are being deposited in smart contract. Almost $2 million background from our contract developer. So at large, I don't think it was ever caught, but it was absolutely identified. And that's the thing about insider threat, is that it really like if you have some kind of logging or you see who executed the action, it's usually pretty easy to identify who is who on the inside did this or could have done this. And then you can usually by cost of elimination, arrive to the insider. Usually they're financially motivated.
00:21:13.062 - 00:21:53.490, Speaker A: I'm not saying malicious, like, they're just pissed at a company, so they just look at like self destructive. Or they could have then, you know, destroy code or delete stuff or, you know, dump all your funds to zero, zero j. That said, they're limited resources and they have limited logic capabilities. So I would say most of the cases of insider thread, they didn't get caught pretty quickly. That's still something to consider. You don't want to go through this whole process. Defenses, background checks, make sure that you know who you're dealing with.
00:21:53.490 - 00:22:48.242, Speaker A: Do the kyc you saw in the previous incident. Like the guy hands voting cards, so immediately who you're dealing with. So when you're dealing with anonymous developers, anonymous employees, you really don't know who is this person? What's the skin in the game if they did something malicious? XFI's principle of least privilege. So does everyone need access to smart project and everyone really need to update parameters in a smart contract or change settings on your infrastructure? Probably not. Make sure you have logging and alerting on all administrative actions, both web two and web3. Key management. There's no reason why a sickle individual can single in Italy, retrieve funds or move funds or deep do any kind of like unilateral action which is censored and that relates to signal points of failure.
00:22:48.242 - 00:23:15.074, Speaker A: Everything should be approved. Everything should include some kind of consensus. Just like even if there's chances of multiple malicious insiders, which happens Artemo so you really want to defend against every swan, you know, one bad individual and then hopefully additional multi sync roles or some other control will cash up. Any questions on the inside chat?
00:23:16.574 - 00:23:36.284, Speaker B: Yes, one question that I have is how to control that. I mean, it seems pretty hard. Developers always have access and if you need to have the right infrastructure protections, you need to have a bigger team. Right. Founders are so they are falling to everything. They are hiring these people, putting them to work. They take very little carry that.
00:23:37.904 - 00:24:39.324, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a hard problem to solve if we really in zoom out. The security industry exists since this time that computers were deployed by cells where we're at it for 60 years now, at least they still didn't solve this. The best you can do is we can minimize the risk and these are the checklists that you can follow. Just don't give all control and all access rights in everyone on your team. Have some kind of retain as a founder, retain some kind of administrative control that only you make sure that you also make sure that the developers that you hire, they require some kind of consensus. So they can't, they can't just update me for, update a smart contract or update settings in a contract without some kind of review. I mean, that's, that will get you 90% there and then the rest becomes very hard.
00:24:39.324 - 00:24:40.784, Speaker A: You do background checks.
00:24:41.764 - 00:24:42.664, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:24:46.444 - 00:25:31.966, Speaker A: And the incident response reach out to law enforcement, are doing three lots, see what happened when build the timeline. I figure out where did this happen, who figured it in action and where is it coming from. Back to funds again. We were dealing with, usually with folks that they're not farting criminals, they're just individuals that went this route. So they don't know how to launder funds as effectively as hard and privileged, but they usually get caught that way. But legal and law enforcement actually works. So I know there are a few other insider threat cases right now.
00:25:31.966 - 00:25:58.744, Speaker A: They're ongoing losses flying around and we'll see how they resolve. But at least you can take legal action. The guessing slow. Okay. So I promise for you to that things will get dark. You know, it's all been kind of like we're dealing with just individuals, they've got kind of rogue now. We're dealing with hardened criminals.
00:25:58.744 - 00:26:25.270, Speaker A: Games are over. These guys are professionals. They know what they're after, they know what they're doing. And they are now looking at our ecosystem, our domain, as prey. So some examples of the famous FTX. $4 billion stolen in the midst of the bankruptcy proceedings. It was crazy, a mess.
00:26:25.270 - 00:26:41.240, Speaker A: Someone was able to get in simp swap. One of the employees took over the account, perform a hot wallet compromise. And so we're on million dollars. It's a really good article. If you're feel free to reach out. Paul. The team was racing to say even good morning.
00:26:41.240 - 00:27:09.624, Speaker A: It was like million dollars at risk. So it was a hot mess. The people that were dealing with were caught recently. So Robert Powell and his sin swapping crew. Robert was operating out of Chicago, somber. The way that they got caught is, well, they were kind of on law enforcement radar for a long time. They associated with Choppa boy, so that's like drug training and other things.
00:27:09.624 - 00:27:46.054, Speaker A: He was living just the exuberant lifestyle. There was no source of income. And I think at one point, the mail person showed up at his doorstep and sounded like there was a wad of cash in his mailbox. It was like ingenious cash just laying in the mailbox. That's apparently how you paid rent. Well, this person is resident, so it's very curious to learn more about what happened, how he targeted FCX that say we're dealing with something like a seasoned career criminal. And they graduated into sip swapping.
00:27:46.054 - 00:28:15.882, Speaker A: They grabbed into atos. They're not really. They're not really tempers size. Like, if you look at the actual transactions of how someone after this war laundering, they were using more traditional eastern european techniques and shells, more likely than not. Like Robert was part of one of the crews. The way that criminal atos work is they are very specialized. This is the ATO coupe.
00:28:15.882 - 00:29:00.374, Speaker A: They gain initial access and they head it off that activists to more experience folks for the actual fund staff. And then they hand over whatever funds they stole into laundry groups and so on. This is just one view of one of the groups. The other one that we should discuss is octopus. Again, idly season threat actor. So ATP, by the way, is, I mentioned a few times, is advanced apt vascular system threat, that this is what in the security community would classify like threat actors, that they're at it for a long time, they will not back down. They'll keep coming after you.
00:29:00.374 - 00:29:51.514, Speaker A: So Octopus was responsible for the fortress, hacked $60 million. This was part of the larger campaign where they targeted retool. So that's one of the third party services that we all rely on retail. They took over again, sip swapping, took over the employee. And then from that employee access, they couldn't get customer data from fortress and a dozen other crypto related projects. They looked through their data from API keys, hot wallet compromise and $16 million. They got again we're dealing with like traditional criminal organization that is going targeting traditional businesses where ages less.
00:29:51.514 - 00:30:14.498, Speaker A: We're talking plans where dealing assets, deal with credit cards, whatever. And now they're looking at it. We're like this fresh piece of meat that's just been sitting there. And now that we're in crypto summer, they get very excited. It's like, wow, we can target all this. This is the easy way. And they're responsible for being other companies.
00:30:14.498 - 00:31:05.170, Speaker A: Okta, Cloudflare, Twilio and so on and so on. Now, whenever they target these projects, which are always data available, they look to see who are the crypto customers and then see if they can target them. So we're dealing with, this is probably what I'm worried about most, like professional criminal organizations as opposed to like they go individuals because they're looking at our industry level. And that's something that points out like a lot of compromises that I've seen lately. They're related to not smart contract exploits, just third party risk. We don't just run smart contracts. We have slack, we have discord, we have Okta, whatever other things that we use for within our companies just to operate right.
00:31:05.170 - 00:32:10.068, Speaker A: And those are all very much wet to infrastructure that we rely on. And whatever we put in there, we have to understand that we are leaving the decentralized world and we're entering this very centralized and very habitable environment where whatever we put in there may get compromised. At one point, without you doubting, I would have the smart contract within minutes to hours. The whole ecosystem that solved the smart contract I have. When someone like Ritu will be a compromise, it'll be in months or even years that those actors will be persistent. There will be stealing stuff without any which, okay, so this high level deal, financially motivated, they usually have disruptive, they're added for money. Usually criminality teams are organized in specialized groups so they have a crew for money blockery.
00:32:10.068 - 00:33:09.064, Speaker A: They have someone that can outsource getting atos and doing zip swapping or even cutting fake credit card or fake sorry id, subtracting licenses so they can reform sim swapping someone face really nice driver's license with your identity when they walk into a cell phone store with nicely credit driver's license to take over your account. So far they're still sticking to traditional exploitation of centralized entities. So they're very good at infrastructure hacking. So they stick to centralized financial institutions. So exchanges basically, and they're users, so they sit for them, they ato, but we'll talk about in the future. There's no reason why they can't start contract just how. It's all very decentralized, right? That's why they call like various names like Hydra or Octopus, because they're very decentralized.
00:33:09.064 - 00:34:01.790, Speaker A: There's no reason why they can't outsource a web3 exploitation as well. We'll talk about it in a bit in a future section, but very strong money laundering capabilities. So they don't, they don't make a simple mistake. As individuals, they have known channels, ugly laundry assets, they have ready made accounts, and now KYC exchanges and KYC exchanges that they can activate on loan sodas. They know how to move money because they've been doing this for decades. So when you're dealing with something like this, it's not so much how safe are your smart contracts. So you should still do smart contract audits and competitions, but you really should step back and start looking your employee.
00:34:01.790 - 00:34:36.633, Speaker A: Endpoint security. Can you please get fish? What happens when they get fished? Can they throw malware? Are you going to detect malware that they throw on your. On your employees? Infrastructure security. If you're. If you have the safest smart objects in the world, but you're storing your private keynotes or you're storing some kind of sensitive API keynie in a third party database, you may get compromised when you do that. How do you hear that? Think again, web two world. This is the boring traditional security.
00:34:36.633 - 00:35:18.060, Speaker A: They have signal points of failure. If one engineer gets stochastic by these folks, you know, like in that faith. According to the Department of Justice, complete. It was just one employee that got. Why was the single employee at FTX able to ciphon out close to a billion dollars? Why was there such vast assets available? Single punishment to consider an incident response. I mean, you have to talk to one enforcement. So wherever your base, FBI, your poll, whatever are doing the infrastructure, forensic analysis, finding track bonds.
00:35:18.060 - 00:35:58.848, Speaker A: But most likely they will be laundered professionally and will be hard to recover. Loyalty negotiations will fail. These folks, they know they can get away with it. And when you threaten that with law enforcement, they're just gonna just in a lack of you third law trains helping me in whatever non exhibition country that I'm based out of. Law enforcement action may work as we learned. So that was still a scenario with bit tonight, Sacker, where after a year, so 2016, hacking was discovered. I mean, years after one of the marketplaces got compromised.
00:35:58.848 - 00:36:25.166, Speaker A: And then law enforcement eventually was able to link the two together. But don't expect for law enforcement to work fast. It'll probably be years and years until you can recover those funds, if at all. You have to start thinking like, what are you going to do with a project criminal APC's? Any questions on both folks? These guys are dark and I'm worried about those different.
00:36:25.350 - 00:36:28.034, Speaker B: No questions, bro. Just keep on. It's very interesting.
00:36:28.934 - 00:36:58.442, Speaker A: All right. And of course we arrived to nation state and that's a whole next one, right? I mean, we're dealing here. We're dealing with milk. Okay. Like these are, these are humans that started creators and we'll start. We're talking about crypto related threat actors which are sponsored by nation state. Really are talking about North Korea.
00:36:58.442 - 00:37:52.394, Speaker A: So Lazarus is the name of the apt group within Lazarus, the various subdivisions. The one that we are particularly worried about is the names of vehicle Blue Norf or Apt 38. Defending which security company talked to these? I specialize in targeting crypto businesses anywhere from defi to crypto individuals to like a few example, Ronin network, $600 million. Again, as you know at the time, Melissa war Army horizon. Those are stolen private keys. They're capable of performing smart contract exploitation if necessary. So in one of the hacks, they found a flaw that allowed a single compromised key to escalated privileges beyond what a single key should have done.
00:37:52.394 - 00:38:17.154, Speaker A: Very proficient at centralized, extreme tracking. So hot wall compromise. Think alpha bolt whistles on and on individuals which are targeted by them. They are security professionals. So you and I were targeted by them to steal latest exploitation code or Rio keys as well. We're dealing with military organization. We're very well funded.
00:38:17.154 - 00:38:42.156, Speaker A: They start these kids early on. They teach them computer science. They're very patriotic, they're motivated. Some are external contractors who are onboarding and they are very well paid. When we're dealing, they should say teenage. They're very financially, but also intelligence motivated, and they can also be disruptive. The widow and willing sphere.
00:38:42.156 - 00:39:21.744, Speaker A: Start with the crypto ecosystem. But I mean, one example where North Korea was pissed off. But if you recall, years back, the Sony, Sony Pictures made a funny comedy about their leader, right? The movie is called the interview, if you want to check it out. Well, North Korea's got body, so they basically obliterated internal solubicious systems where they shut down the company as a piece. So piss these guys out. Niche estates are extremely well funded. If you think about.
00:39:21.744 - 00:39:51.284, Speaker A: If you're thinking like the individuals, like, sure, the best they can do, maybe they can stand up some infrastructure to host their fishing kits and so on. These guys can go on the open market and buy all the vulnerabilities costing millions of dollars to target you. Specifically, the vulnerability that not a single avengine can catch that Google or Apple, whatever product they use, doesn't know about. They won't get it.
00:39:53.224 - 00:39:54.684, Speaker B: It's very interesting.
00:39:55.904 - 00:40:05.084, Speaker A: They're very well resourced. So, latest report that I've read, the team that you're dealing with. So just the ETT 38, the 17 audit people.
00:40:05.924 - 00:40:06.704, Speaker B: Wow.
00:40:07.164 - 00:40:17.548, Speaker A: Just, just saying about that, that 1700 people is the number of people they can throw against your project if they think that you are valuable enough.
00:40:17.716 - 00:40:18.228, Speaker B: Wow.
00:40:18.316 - 00:40:22.836, Speaker A: How many people participate on an average competition? Hundreds.
00:40:22.940 - 00:40:44.528, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, 200, 300? Yeah. Maybe three, four person. Yeah. For at max. One question, bro. How they got so good? Because when you think North Korea, you don't think a lot of technology, you don't think that they have access to the Internet.
00:40:44.528 - 00:40:53.404, Speaker B: And when then I heard they go to China to training there, didn't come back with how they got so good. I mean, this, this is weird. You know.
00:40:55.344 - 00:41:42.114, Speaker A: The program started in the nineties. They recognize that new domain, which obviously later said, but they've been targeting just traditional web two infrastructure for decades. They recognize early on that they can't compete against the United States or western countries through traditional warfare. So they developed a new domain which is cyber warfare. So they have been collecting intelligence, they've been involved in espionage. But then the latest discovery happened and said they seem, wow. We can actually not only steal information, which is what they've been involved in until recently, but we can actually generate huge amounts of funds from these projects.
00:41:42.114 - 00:41:58.546, Speaker A: They look at the crypto ecosystem as basically this new industry barely protected. Crazy amounts of money involved. For them, this is a walk in the park. They've been targeting much more difficult systems.
00:41:58.650 - 00:42:00.054, Speaker B: I see. Nice.
00:42:01.114 - 00:42:28.554, Speaker A: That said something to keep in mind. We are dealing with a soldier, right. It's basically his job we're contracted with. If you're contracting with someone like this. Yeah. I gonna go around and try experimenting with my contact hacks. Although we've seen, we're seeing a few indications that they're like diving into like, governance hacks weekly before they stick to what action brings light.
00:42:28.554 - 00:42:44.994, Speaker A: And it makes sense, right? Like you're. You're a soldier and you're told we need to steal a billion dollars per buck. And if you do that, you get promoted. And if you don't do that, we get demoed. Maybe you're going to go suck the toilets because you're not good at hacking anymore.
00:42:45.074 - 00:42:45.610, Speaker B: I see.
00:42:45.682 - 00:43:21.424, Speaker A: So as a soldier, your incentive is to deliver consistently. Then it's not really incentivized to do chasing smart contract hacks, which sometimes work, sometimes don't work. You go for tried and true things like private keys. You have an arsenal of malware and your social or compromised hawk wallet. You know how to hack wax to the infra. So you're just going to go after hot wallets. That's why whenever you hear private key or hot wallet compromise and you see certain laundry techniques, there's a very good indication that this is a north korean actor.
00:43:21.424 - 00:43:47.404, Speaker A: Laundering techniques were very strong. Again, they've been doing this for a very long time. They know what's going on. And just an estimate of how much they need collected so far and why this will be a continued threat. I mean, they sold almost $3 billion in a few years. Of course, they are going to throw and dedicate more and more resources because it's a proven source of funds for the nation.
00:43:48.664 - 00:43:51.288, Speaker B: I wonder how they laundered it. But yes, that's Wayne.
00:43:51.296 - 00:44:50.750, Speaker A: You the government there? No, really? I mean, okay, well, if we roll back time before crypto, before tornado, cash, before all those things, we, they literally have the individuals under sub individuals positioned by ATM machines, right, waiting for a signal to deposit debit cards into ATM machines within minutes of each other to withdraw own assets which just arrived in cash. So great. We're not talking about like, this is industrial grain operation, the latest thing, like with Torino and, you know, dealing with going through non KYC exchanges. This is their latest stake. But they're more than capable of doing other things. Like, they've been doing this for a long time. I know, I see specific tactics that they use and that's how we profile.
00:44:50.750 - 00:45:23.690, Speaker A: Like, oh, this is ground advisory, is they're going to hopping the chain. They got bitcoin and they're swapping here and then go to this exchange. They're like certain else. It's like, okay, I know we're good work. That's how we identify what is behind acting, looking at those techniques. But from a defender perspective, most importantly, a kind of scoop like, you're dealing with a country, okay? And I told you about, they're very well resourced, very well funded. If they target you specifically, they will get.
00:45:23.690 - 00:45:52.684, Speaker A: They won't get. So the best they can do is to be just a little bit harder like the other guy. It's a horrible thing to say. You have to be just more distended, more protected than other Defi projects out there. They can become a harder target to exploit. So hopefully they'll move on to somewhere else again, just like with criminal apts employee and endpoint security is the focus. They don't really hacked smart contracts yet.
00:45:52.684 - 00:46:07.208, Speaker A: So focus on your web two stuff. Web two and pinkle infrastructure security key match. We showed that a single compromise of a single multi set key cannot steal everything. Things like that.
00:46:07.336 - 00:46:19.504, Speaker B: When we talk about, when we talk about hacking web true infrastructure, we're talking about leakage keys. Right? Because they cannot just hack Amazon like that. They have actually a bigger team of security and a very strong one, right?
00:46:22.524 - 00:46:40.104, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. Yes, they can hack Amazon. It depends what is the, like, what is the target? Right. If you're valuable enough target, sure. They'll come after Amazon. They'll come after any infrastructure that you support. They'll come after Cloudflare, they'll come after.
00:46:40.104 - 00:47:31.864, Speaker A: We saw a retool that's from criminal apts. But there's no reason why the nation state actors can't target just like your dependency where understand that you don't access. Yeah, 17 other people, large waste resource, do a wider print. At the same time, you can have a team dedicated to your infrastructure that can have a team dedicated to your smart contracts, your people, your, your employees and so on. Yeah. Interpret incident response infrastructure friends. You can also so assume it's a key bridge being where the kings will then try to move funds to cold storage as quickly as possible just to minimize losses.
00:47:31.864 - 00:48:13.496, Speaker A: Obviously, bounty negotiations will fail. Right. I mean, can you imagine, like said, hey, congratulations guy, you stole August from being job. Can you keep 10% and give me the rest? No, I mean, the soldier will you dealing with someone in the military like. No, they're like they're going to get like executed or something and they give back a soul might. There was one time they, they were moving slow enough and they got some of the assets stolen back from them. And I'm sure someone in their convention was pissed because that was a few extra million dollars that they could have provided for the regime.
00:48:13.496 - 00:48:42.886, Speaker A: So not, don't want to be there. So obviously not going to get any money back by Trump to ping some and cone white hats or whatever other things. Legal action is not going to work where you're going to sue North Korea. Law enforcement actually rules of our work. I mean, where's they going to sanction? Maybe. I think there was like one person within the APG group that was identified. I mean, they're going to sanction.
00:48:42.886 - 00:49:09.250, Speaker A: What are you going to do? There's nothing you're going to do. You're dealing with a sovereign nation, with the nukes. That's going to happen. Yeah. So this, this is the hard one and this is this. And the reason why they call them that's persistent trick is that this, this drug will continue indefinitely. They know this is a good source of funds and they will continue using this.
00:49:09.250 - 00:49:24.394, Speaker A: And you should be worried about that. This is a serious bleeps about maybe there's some perception that they're not vents, that they're very advanced, very capable. Any questions on the nation state?
00:49:24.974 - 00:49:28.114, Speaker B: No questions, bro. I'm just saying. No, it's in all.
00:49:32.294 - 00:50:30.804, Speaker A: Well, let's talk about the future then a little bit of takeaways and then we can open maybe up for more general questions. The future, the place where I'm, I guess what I'm worried about really like we should recognition of what, like where something is going to just look at the past. So if we look at the past at traditional security, right? Traditional security are in a bottle. The same way we first had individuals hacking around. Like if you look through the tree books of computer hacking or the eighties or basically kids like messing around, playing with systems. A lot of it was just for the hell of like can I do this? Can I, can I actually break into the system? And so on, diaries. We slowly started seeing criminal groups taking interest because just simply like as these kids were put in jail, they slowly started interacting with criminals.
00:50:30.804 - 00:51:15.248, Speaker A: We started looking at, they started collaborating and then in two thousands and later we saw this. An explosion of just professional criminal groups eliminating millions of billions of credit card and just really operationalizing this crap like they were industrial level theft of credit cards, data and so on. We're seeing unfortunately the same trend, but we're still dealing with these portfolios and the one yet. It sucks that they're doing this, but I get it. They're just experimenting. This is an exciting thing. I just wish we'll spend more time maybe on security contests, their money, which in the fleet.
00:51:15.248 - 00:52:12.774, Speaker A: But I get what's going to happen though is that criminals, real ardent criminals, are going to take interest and they're going to start collaborating with these individual security researchers and they're going to offer them their laundry capabilities and stealth capabilities and they slowly will start working together. So we're seeing already like the rise of web chain phish kits is already this industry adopting what's happening in traditional security where there are snaking kids which are distributed with profit sharing. So we're talking about multi trainers, pink trainers, all those great iPads. We're basically adapting the same traditional exploitation techniques into the web3 world. And then finally the last stage you'll notice pool adoption of web3 and d five. A hacking by criminal criminal groups where becomes aren't what they do. They focus on it full time.
00:52:12.774 - 00:52:59.764, Speaker A: They will graduate from what they know, which is web two hacking hot wallet and t theft, to actually targeting DeFi projects. It's still a little bit hard to do, and the return on investment is hard to justify right now. It's so much easier to steal tens of hundreds of millions of dollars by just taking over someone's ex account and dropping efficient. But in the future, as projects get more and more value stored in them, they will become much more attractive for these trends. So, some takeaways. I wouldn't freak you out. The goal here was just to get an understanding of what we're dealing with.
00:52:59.764 - 00:54:03.464, Speaker A: Who are your threat actors, who you should be worried about when you're focusing on defenses and this auditor, what are the things that you should be focusing on in your limited time that will most likely get exploited and without an actual mental image of who's going to, who's competing against you on the outside? This is an auditor. You are part of the defense solution. You're being asked to perform an analysis based on kind of like simulating what the bad guys will do, and you're paid to do what they do. So you should try to simulate that as much as possible. What you do is you understand what is your business and what kind of threat actors you will attract. So if you're a Grinch, you should start thinking about effect and, and the nation state. Threat actors, my contractors, is always there, but these are the people that will be very interested in you with much stronger capabilities.
00:54:03.464 - 00:54:37.364, Speaker A: And once you realize that, then you can prioritize. Where does your budget go? What are you building? What kind of bond did you build? Would you look for? Because as you mentioned, a lot of the teams in our space are tight. We have limited speed, we have to survive, and security is important. But oftentimes we have really time to spend on security. Just the reality of it. This will give you a plan of what you need to focus on. So understand, what are the threat doctors and what are the tactics most important they need to protect against.
00:54:37.364 - 00:55:06.544, Speaker A: And shameless plug stay on top of threat intelligence, what is actually evolving, what is happening, because it should be all the time. The shameless plugin is a newsletter that I published weekly where I didn't talk about what are the latest hacks, how folks are getting compromised, and most importantly, with defenses we should be focusing on and it's tough. Slave mode is based. It's always something which is awesome.
00:55:08.284 - 00:55:56.784, Speaker B: And without any questions, brother, I just want to say this is one of the best talks we ever had here. I made over 100 videos and this is really complete, really cool. A lot of new knowledge I don't have because I'm one of these marker track guys and I'm not from traditional security, so I learned a lot just from atps and how these guys work and how they have these different creels, you know? I'm just amazed. Thank you so much. We don't have a lot of people in the audience, but I'm pretty sure this is going to be a hit on YouTube. I don't know if Junior has a question. If he doesn't have a question, bro, feel free to drop any last thought, any less words, any message you want to leave to the community, and I recommend everybody checking block traffic as soon as possible.
00:55:58.884 - 00:56:13.936, Speaker A: Wait. Well, thank you so much for the hide and opportunity to share. I always. I care deeply about the community, so it's good to share as much as I'd work on the journey with any of some and so that.
00:56:14.120 - 00:56:20.544, Speaker B: Thank you so much, brother. We're going to leave with that and see you guys later. Bye.
