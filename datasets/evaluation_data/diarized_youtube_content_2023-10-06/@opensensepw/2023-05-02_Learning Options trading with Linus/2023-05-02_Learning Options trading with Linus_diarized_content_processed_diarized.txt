00:00:00.160 - 00:00:21.470, Speaker A: And today my topic is about bitcoin option trading and arbitrage. And my name is Linus and I'm a retail trader and investor on the bitcoin. And before we started, and I have to have to say something is cryptocurrency investment is really high risk.
00:00:21.542 - 00:00:24.518, Speaker B: If you understand, please don't touch it.
00:00:24.566 - 00:00:29.294, Speaker A: Everything Saturday, it's not financial advice, it's on the education purpose.
00:00:29.834 - 00:00:30.346, Speaker C: Okay.
00:00:30.410 - 00:00:33.418, Speaker A: And before we started and you should.
00:00:33.506 - 00:00:38.482, Speaker B: Understand some basic concept about the option option.
00:00:38.538 - 00:00:42.786, Speaker A: The top level of the option. And you need to understand the call.
00:00:42.850 - 00:00:51.262, Speaker B: And put corruption is, excuse me, the corruption is mean.
00:00:51.418 - 00:00:55.126, Speaker A: Do you allow the buyer to have.
00:00:55.270 - 00:00:59.274, Speaker B: The right, the certain price.
00:01:01.054 - 00:01:10.434, Speaker A: Or before the export right regardless whatever what happened in the market. Let me give you an example.
00:01:10.974 - 00:01:11.558, Speaker C: Okay.
00:01:11.606 - 00:01:21.394, Speaker A: Oh no, wait a second. And I was prepared to opening this bit right now. And the dare bit is a option trading platform.
00:01:21.554 - 00:01:27.898, Speaker B: And we open this option chart and here is a different date option.
00:01:28.026 - 00:01:30.694, Speaker A: And because option have the different.
00:01:32.514 - 00:01:33.254, Speaker C: Side.
00:01:33.554 - 00:01:54.524, Speaker A: In the after more side with the different side with the future. The future without the date, the perpetual future. But in the option we have the different expired date. And you can see here in the.
00:01:54.644 - 00:01:59.704, Speaker B: 23 days later and this option going to be zero.
00:02:00.044 - 00:02:12.103, Speaker A: It means you're not going to treat this option available. And this is some basic concept about the option. And the call option at the ITR.
00:02:12.603 - 00:02:16.155, Speaker B: Side is a call option is and.
00:02:16.179 - 00:02:20.623, Speaker A: The right side is a put option. And you need to understand this concept at first.
00:02:48.624 - 00:03:06.364, Speaker B: It means you need twice a price. You're going to hang on now the price is fine. All right.
00:03:06.904 - 00:03:18.776, Speaker A: If someone don't know what is trading view. And the trading view is you could watch the financial market price market situation.
00:03:18.960 - 00:03:26.768, Speaker B: And because we have the different price action on this and someone trading option.
00:03:26.816 - 00:03:34.354, Speaker A: And without watching the price chart but my personally I have to watch the price chart to make the trading decision.
00:03:34.974 - 00:03:35.714, Speaker B: And.
00:03:39.934 - 00:03:41.274, Speaker C: How to make.
00:03:42.014 - 00:03:44.494, Speaker A: And the call option is allow you.
00:03:44.574 - 00:03:47.734, Speaker B: To you have the right to buy.
00:03:47.774 - 00:04:12.550, Speaker A: Your underlying asset and a specific price. And the put option is give you the right to sell the underlying asset at the specific price is different with the car option. But this situation is only happen when you be an option buyer. But if you selling an option, the.
00:04:12.582 - 00:04:16.954, Speaker B: Situation will be different such as like this.
00:04:18.254 - 00:04:37.417, Speaker A: Let me give you an example. Here is 33,000 and right here this option will expire on 23 days later. And if you selling this option, this.
00:04:37.505 - 00:04:42.769, Speaker B: Is the bid side and option is a contract.
00:04:42.881 - 00:04:53.034, Speaker A: We going to sell to the bid side and buy from the ask side. And you using zero, one or 0.1.
00:04:53.494 - 00:05:09.950, Speaker B: Bitcoin as a initial capital to sell this option. And you will gain 0.008 bitcoin. But this price will go to be.
00:05:10.022 - 00:05:20.944, Speaker A: Changed based on the bitcoin price. And when the price go up, this will be against you. And if the bitcoin price go down, this will be benefit for you.
00:05:21.764 - 00:05:25.504, Speaker B: And I want to make sure I make it clear.
00:05:26.884 - 00:05:27.624, Speaker C: And.
00:05:29.484 - 00:05:31.344, Speaker A: Let'S just move. Keep moving.
00:05:32.844 - 00:05:33.660, Speaker C: Okay.
00:05:33.812 - 00:05:53.616, Speaker A: And I know you are the. You guys are searching on the the chain industry and teaching about people how to manage their. Their code or something else like this. You guys are really, really smart. And to understand this.
00:05:53.760 - 00:05:54.444, Speaker C: And.
00:05:55.464 - 00:06:01.024, Speaker B: And the premium price. The premium price is the price we.
00:06:01.064 - 00:06:03.360, Speaker A: Going to pay for the option or.
00:06:03.472 - 00:06:08.618, Speaker B: We selling for the option just like this.
00:06:08.746 - 00:06:15.894, Speaker A: And there sig. 36,000. 36,000. We're closing this.
00:06:17.594 - 00:06:24.466, Speaker B: When this strike price is at the $36,000.
00:06:24.610 - 00:06:29.402, Speaker A: And if we selling this option, we're going to collect $83.
00:06:29.538 - 00:06:37.550, Speaker B: And if we buy this option, we going to spend 153.85.
00:06:37.622 - 00:06:42.354, Speaker A: But actually, this money is calculated by the bitcoin.
00:06:43.014 - 00:06:46.914, Speaker B: And you could choice like this.
00:06:47.214 - 00:06:48.638, Speaker A: Let me see. Yes.
00:06:48.686 - 00:06:58.874, Speaker B: Right here. Just showing the bitcoin. Show it. Just using.
00:06:59.284 - 00:07:08.380, Speaker A: But you. You want to visualize the actually how much price you command. How much premium you going to cost or collect.
00:07:08.572 - 00:07:15.444, Speaker B: You could turn this. Turn on this and yes, and let's.
00:07:15.524 - 00:07:41.034, Speaker A: Just go move forward. And don't worry about if you have any question. I have the Q and a section in the final, so. So don't worry about it. And we'll give you. I will try to answer your question and try my best if I don't know how to answer that question right now. And I will figure out and give you the great answer.
00:07:41.614 - 00:07:45.382, Speaker B: Everything is just based on from my.
00:07:45.478 - 00:07:54.454, Speaker A: Personal trading experience and in the bottom of paramount and we have the ITM.
00:07:54.534 - 00:07:56.002, Speaker B: Is mean in the money.
00:07:56.198 - 00:08:27.630, Speaker A: ATM at the money and OTM out of the money. And before this presentation, I'm prepared for this. I'm trying to google it on what is ATM? The Google give me the answer is ATM is a situation where options strike price is identity to current market price of underlying security. Maybe you hear this concept. You don't. You mean, what the fuck is this?
00:08:27.702 - 00:08:28.198, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:28.326 - 00:08:43.834, Speaker A: And being this, I will give you an easy to understand. What is ATM? What is ITM? What is OTM? We could understand ATM as a border.
00:08:44.294 - 00:08:45.634, Speaker B: Border of the.
00:08:46.014 - 00:08:46.870, Speaker A: As a border.
00:08:46.942 - 00:08:51.478, Speaker B: Border of the OTM and out of money.
00:08:51.526 - 00:08:53.542, Speaker A: OTM. And ITM.
00:08:53.718 - 00:08:54.670, Speaker B: It is a border.
00:08:54.742 - 00:09:09.166, Speaker A: We have the different country. Country with country. Have the have the border and the border is the. You could thinking that the border is ITM and the OTM is out of money option.
00:09:09.350 - 00:09:10.606, Speaker B: Out of money option.
00:09:10.710 - 00:09:15.082, Speaker A: Here is a simple way to understand what is OTM.
00:09:15.238 - 00:09:18.134, Speaker B: OTM in the expiry date.
00:09:20.234 - 00:09:20.634, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:20.674 - 00:09:23.434, Speaker B: Just we give you an example and.
00:09:23.474 - 00:09:34.306, Speaker A: This option will be expiry 21 hours later. And after 21 hours later you couldn't reading this option contract and you see.
00:09:34.370 - 00:09:39.722, Speaker B: This, those contracts are going to be worthless, right.
00:09:39.778 - 00:09:47.114, Speaker A: And you couldn't, you. You couldn't sell it. And something has some have to still have the value.
00:09:49.094 - 00:09:52.158, Speaker B: But most of this option is common.
00:09:52.206 - 00:09:53.614, Speaker A: And this is put option.
00:09:53.734 - 00:09:59.190, Speaker B: Most of their option going to be going to be worthless and some option.
00:09:59.262 - 00:10:07.922, Speaker A: On the expiry date going to be worthless or going to be zero. It is called the OTM.
00:10:07.978 - 00:10:10.458, Speaker B: This is called out of money option.
00:10:10.586 - 00:10:21.666, Speaker A: And some option, some option is called have to still have the value. And such as like this is have the green side here.
00:10:21.730 - 00:10:23.458, Speaker B: And it is.
00:10:23.586 - 00:10:26.054, Speaker A: You could still have the when the.
00:10:28.474 - 00:10:32.642, Speaker B: Contract expired and still have the value.
00:10:32.698 - 00:10:57.580, Speaker A: It is called by card is in the money option. And let me just go to further and here is the difference between the derby and bytebeat. I'm sure a lot of guy trading future on binance or the bytebeat. And the bytebeats still have the option. And my personally trading on the dare.
00:10:57.612 - 00:11:06.594, Speaker B: Bit on the Darabit. You could using your bitcoin to trade the option. Because.
00:11:11.134 - 00:11:38.534, Speaker A: Proof of work and doesn't like the Israel after. After the merge is rhythm is becoming to the proof of stake. And you couldn't using your bitcoin just stake somewhere to making more bitcoin. And the reason why I chose to trading on derbit is because I could using my bitcoin to make more bitcoin.
00:11:39.394 - 00:11:40.730, Speaker B: And here's a bybit.
00:11:40.802 - 00:12:00.866, Speaker A: And bybit allow you trading on USDC everything. The option contract is trading based on the price is USDC. You could trading on the bybit us using the USDC. But you couldn't treating it trading by bet on using your bitcoin.
00:12:00.970 - 00:12:02.574, Speaker B: And here's a difference.
00:12:03.634 - 00:12:11.174, Speaker A: And. And here is a repeat again.
00:12:13.874 - 00:12:14.282, Speaker C: Okay.
00:12:14.298 - 00:12:14.974, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:33.334 - 00:12:37.394, Speaker A: It is going to be same same last. Here is.
00:12:39.374 - 00:12:43.686, Speaker B: A P and er chart right here.
00:12:43.790 - 00:12:46.326, Speaker A: And if you going to.
00:12:46.390 - 00:12:50.230, Speaker B: And I will go into an example right here.
00:12:50.422 - 00:12:53.502, Speaker A: And you say, I understand your mean.
00:12:53.558 - 00:12:59.674, Speaker B: Is if the market against you, right. And what we're going to happen, right sir?
00:13:03.934 - 00:13:10.134, Speaker C: Yes. Taxes.
00:13:10.214 - 00:13:24.930, Speaker B: Tax. What's mean tax such as the role is.
00:13:25.002 - 00:13:26.054, Speaker A: The role is.
00:13:28.074 - 00:13:29.306, Speaker B: In China we don't.
00:13:29.330 - 00:13:31.774, Speaker A: Pay tax to trading option.
00:13:34.874 - 00:13:35.258, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:35.306 - 00:13:36.294, Speaker B: Maybe it is.
00:13:41.534 - 00:14:06.554, Speaker A: In China, if you're selling your asset or your stock, you don't pay any tax. I know in the United States you have to pay something, right? Yes. And this is you could using some such as like VPN to.
00:14:08.424 - 00:14:09.272, Speaker B: To avoid.
00:14:09.328 - 00:14:11.688, Speaker A: The tax or something else like this.
00:14:11.856 - 00:14:12.328, Speaker C: And.
00:14:12.416 - 00:14:19.656, Speaker A: But in China we're treating, treating, treating the financial derivative. We don't pay anything.
00:14:19.840 - 00:14:20.644, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:25.504 - 00:14:27.644, Speaker B: You can move it down.
00:14:31.024 - 00:14:31.456, Speaker C: Okay.
00:14:31.480 - 00:14:39.634, Speaker A: Okay. And here is a really exciting part is about the arbitrage strategy. And today I'm going to sharing.
00:14:41.814 - 00:14:42.174, Speaker C: A.
00:14:42.214 - 00:15:10.104, Speaker A: Strategy I often use in the bear market is called a cover call. The COVID call is maximized with two items. One is your coin. You're holding your coin and selling call option. And above the certain price. I give you an example.
00:15:12.884 - 00:15:13.764, Speaker B: So like this.
00:15:13.844 - 00:15:18.464, Speaker A: Now the bitcoin price is right here.
00:15:23.444 - 00:15:26.836, Speaker B: And when you go to the option.
00:15:26.900 - 00:15:32.140, Speaker A: Chain and you choosing that after one day, you betting on the bitcoin price.
00:15:32.212 - 00:15:37.144, Speaker B: Won'T go to the 29, 500.
00:15:37.304 - 00:15:39.672, Speaker A: And you going to sell an option.
00:15:39.728 - 00:15:44.984, Speaker B: Here, the delta, maybe I couldn't speak.
00:15:45.104 - 00:15:47.044, Speaker A: I couldn't. I couldn't.
00:15:49.104 - 00:15:53.072, Speaker B: Find to describe anything in.
00:15:53.088 - 00:16:07.694, Speaker A: The option such as comma, what is comma, what is Vega, what is theta or what is a row. And I could give you an basic information about how I built the portfolio. And if I betting on.
00:16:07.814 - 00:16:12.678, Speaker B: If I thinking, oh, the price won't.
00:16:12.766 - 00:16:14.314, Speaker A: Go above the.
00:16:18.574 - 00:16:19.634, Speaker B: Second I.
00:16:31.074 - 00:17:00.564, Speaker A: 9500. And this is, I think the, this the price after 20. After one day it won't be go above this line. So I'm going to sell this option and I collective $48 it means zero or 0.003 bitcoin. And when you're selling a selling option you have to using 0.1 as a margin.
00:17:02.744 - 00:17:09.992, Speaker B: And let's be check about this. And this is almost 5% already.
00:17:10.128 - 00:17:14.872, Speaker A: And you thinking that, oh, this price won't go about this. And you could sell it.
00:17:15.048 - 00:17:18.080, Speaker B: And cause you sell it.
00:17:18.112 - 00:17:36.586, Speaker A: You collect the premium as about is right here. And when the option going to exprite and go to the. Because because of the time and going to be the volume, the value of the this option going to be let.
00:17:36.770 - 00:17:37.898, Speaker B: Going to be less.
00:17:38.066 - 00:17:38.774, Speaker C: So.
00:17:41.474 - 00:17:46.882, Speaker A: You have to buy this by you selling something and you have to buy it down.
00:17:46.938 - 00:17:49.962, Speaker B: But here is no ask price.
00:17:50.058 - 00:17:52.734, Speaker A: So this is not good trade.
00:17:52.854 - 00:17:56.846, Speaker B: So we need to make, make another.
00:17:56.910 - 00:17:59.354, Speaker A: I give you another example.
00:17:59.814 - 00:18:05.214, Speaker B: Selling this the delta is 33,000.
00:18:05.294 - 00:18:08.634, Speaker A: And I still thinking that this couldn't be about that. And.
00:18:10.974 - 00:18:20.576, Speaker B: This is, this is not a financial advice. And this is just for the education purpose.
00:18:20.640 - 00:18:37.164, Speaker A: All right, guys. And because we on the bull trend and betting on the price won't go above this line and I will using this. That's right. And let's we see the expiry date May 26.
00:18:39.144 - 00:18:39.884, Speaker C: May.
00:18:42.184 - 00:18:59.354, Speaker A: What? Based on the technical analysis to make a decision. But it still need to the building. The long short portfolio is on the.
00:18:59.774 - 00:19:02.550, Speaker B: Greeks such as the delta.
00:19:02.742 - 00:19:04.634, Speaker A: I will talk about this later.
00:19:08.794 - 00:19:19.654, Speaker C: Yeah. Six. That's right.
00:19:23.874 - 00:19:25.082, Speaker B: And just like that.
00:19:25.138 - 00:19:34.090, Speaker A: And this is the daily candle I'm going to show you. And you're watching right now is a daily candle. And when the price is nearly to.
00:19:34.122 - 00:19:37.140, Speaker B: The expiry date and if, if the.
00:19:37.172 - 00:19:42.924, Speaker A: Price is not go above the $33,000.
00:19:43.004 - 00:19:47.984, Speaker B: And we selling this contract for the.
00:19:48.924 - 00:19:58.356, Speaker A: For the 0.008 bitcoin is going to be zero. And so we make the. We make this profit but we have.
00:19:58.380 - 00:20:06.072, Speaker B: To bought it back on the different price or we could bought it when.
00:20:06.128 - 00:20:08.404, Speaker A: The prices still go down.
00:20:09.704 - 00:20:10.360, Speaker B: If the.
00:20:10.432 - 00:20:16.688, Speaker A: If the price. If the bitcoin prices go down and the option price is also go down.
00:20:16.776 - 00:20:25.324, Speaker B: And we could buy it just during. Before it or before it.
00:20:25.784 - 00:20:28.044, Speaker A: Before the option going to be worthless.
00:20:28.474 - 00:20:47.090, Speaker B: Yeah, just like that. And the main risk is that if the price is go above, is go above the. You go above this the strike price, you're going to lose.
00:20:47.202 - 00:21:00.654, Speaker A: And even if right now, if the prices go up right now is you're still going to lose. But with the time decline, you maybe have some profit or like that.
00:21:00.774 - 00:21:01.414, Speaker B: And.
00:21:01.574 - 00:21:09.074, Speaker A: All right, the one thing I want to share with you guys is before you're trading it, you have what to chart?
00:21:10.054 - 00:21:25.482, Speaker B: What the option price chart. Option price chart is not. Is not the same as the spot chart. Because of the option is a contract.
00:21:25.578 - 00:21:26.894, Speaker A: They have their own.
00:21:27.394 - 00:21:29.058, Speaker B: They have their own price.
00:21:29.226 - 00:21:41.454, Speaker A: And absolutely right now selling an option is not a good choice based on the history district, the price action. And we could sell it right here or something.
00:21:45.474 - 00:21:46.194, Speaker B: No, no, no.
00:21:46.274 - 00:21:48.754, Speaker A: This is. We couldn't. This is not a financial advice.
00:21:48.794 - 00:21:52.942, Speaker B: I couldn't say more than that.
00:21:52.998 - 00:22:07.638, Speaker A: And before we make the decision to sell or buy an option, we have to watch a chart and the option price chart. And this is something I learned from some major mistake.
00:22:07.726 - 00:22:08.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:09.854 - 00:22:13.074, Speaker A: And let's, we just keep moving forward.
00:22:15.274 - 00:22:17.734, Speaker B: And this.
00:22:19.874 - 00:22:24.586, Speaker A: For the option, your position. And if we.
00:22:24.770 - 00:22:27.370, Speaker B: This is here is a premium we.
00:22:27.402 - 00:22:57.594, Speaker A: Selling on a car option short car. Yes. A short car is. Is different side with your, with long car. The long car is you, you thinking the price will go up and if the prices go above your strict price and you're going to make a lot of and but your shorting call if the prices go above your streak, you're going to lose a lot of. This is the same concept in the future.
00:22:58.174 - 00:22:58.686, Speaker B: All right.
00:22:58.750 - 00:22:59.674, Speaker A: Risk management.
00:23:03.134 - 00:23:06.462, Speaker B: In the option trading option, another item.
00:23:06.518 - 00:23:15.818, Speaker A: Is really important is the volatility. And we building the option position. First thing we need to think about.
00:23:15.866 - 00:23:16.974, Speaker B: Is hedge.
00:23:19.674 - 00:23:31.054, Speaker A: Different with the future. Future only could choice. If the price go up you make money. If price goes down, you only have the long or short.
00:23:31.434 - 00:23:34.546, Speaker B: But the option have the three side.
00:23:34.690 - 00:23:37.378, Speaker A: Have the difference with future.
00:23:37.546 - 00:23:44.046, Speaker B: Even the mark it with a sideline.
00:23:44.230 - 00:23:47.974, Speaker A: Just not go up or not go down. I give you an example here.
00:23:48.134 - 00:23:52.246, Speaker B: And just like right here, we didn't.
00:23:52.270 - 00:23:53.994, Speaker A: Go up or we didn't go down.
00:23:57.134 - 00:24:00.634, Speaker B: Just like in this range.
00:24:05.994 - 00:24:37.434, Speaker A: This range we the prices didn't go up or go down. And we could make a really great profit as a option seller because the time is moving and we make the zeta zeta and getting profit from the time decline. And if you want to learn more about option, and I will recommend some youtuber is the really great option educator.
00:24:39.054 - 00:24:51.118, Speaker B: And here is a portfolio. And before we making the trading decision.
00:24:51.246 - 00:25:13.254, Speaker A: And we need to make a plan. When to open a position, when to close a position. And if you are really good at trading trading and you need to build a long short portfolio. And because of building the long short portfolio is using to the hedge to protect your position.
00:25:13.714 - 00:25:15.574, Speaker B: Okay, here is an example.
00:25:16.274 - 00:25:22.294, Speaker A: And this is option. This is a trade I was made. And.
00:25:24.914 - 00:25:26.758, Speaker B: This trade is this.
00:25:26.806 - 00:25:49.874, Speaker A: That day is April, April 2. April 2. And after the go up higher it is based on the probability.
00:25:50.454 - 00:25:55.340, Speaker B: And because of this we, because we're.
00:25:55.372 - 00:26:08.708, Speaker A: Not in the bull market and we couldn't just strictly go to the star rocket, go to the moon or something like that. And I know something, maybe we have continued to rally something like that.
00:26:08.836 - 00:26:20.950, Speaker B: And I decided to buy the two corduroy option. Cause of the orderly option have the.
00:26:21.062 - 00:26:26.834, Speaker A: Really slow time decline. It won't be really hurt me. So I buy the.
00:26:29.774 - 00:26:35.758, Speaker B: Long the one call option and long put option, whatever.
00:26:35.806 - 00:26:47.832, Speaker A: The price is, go up or go down. In the future I still going to make profit and upside. And the upside under the downside I.
00:26:47.928 - 00:26:52.632, Speaker B: Short the two monthly call option and.
00:26:52.688 - 00:26:55.844, Speaker A: Short the three monthly put option.
00:26:57.424 - 00:27:09.204, Speaker B: And because the fundamental this is based on the still based on the volatility.
00:27:09.744 - 00:27:12.084, Speaker A: As you could see it right there.
00:27:12.584 - 00:27:12.960, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:12.992 - 00:27:19.004, Speaker A: This is a bitcoin. Bitcoin historical volatility index. Just like the VIX.

00:27:28.920 - 00:27:30.192, Speaker B: Because of the volatility.
00:27:30.288 - 00:27:56.744, Speaker A: The volatility is still a really important part of to affect the option price. I know when I bought the option and it's going to be cheap. So I bought the two quarterly option and short two monthly option. And I already I make a really.
