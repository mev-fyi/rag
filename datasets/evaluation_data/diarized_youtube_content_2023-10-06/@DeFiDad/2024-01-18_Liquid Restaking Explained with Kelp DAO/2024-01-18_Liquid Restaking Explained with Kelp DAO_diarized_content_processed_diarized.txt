00:00:00.330 - 00:00:16.890, Speaker A: Today's show spotlights one of the first liquid restaking protocols to emerge, called Kelpdao. In this episode, we'll review Kelpdao's liquid restake token RFE, designed to offer liquidity to ill liquid assets deposited into restaking platforms such as Eigen layer.
00:00:16.970 - 00:00:59.770, Speaker B: A lot of users actually use liquid staking tokens today, and they participate in DeFi. And then when restaking kind of emerges, it going to conflict with DeFi. Users are going to have to choose between restaking or DeFi. They can't have the best of both the worlds. How can we solve that? That's where the design of RSC came into play, where we wanted to create this single receipt token that gives users access to staking and restaking, rewards liquidity as well as opportunity to is paid in DeFi, and also eliminate the complexity of all of these, all of the complexity of claiming these different types of reward tokens given by the ABSs.
