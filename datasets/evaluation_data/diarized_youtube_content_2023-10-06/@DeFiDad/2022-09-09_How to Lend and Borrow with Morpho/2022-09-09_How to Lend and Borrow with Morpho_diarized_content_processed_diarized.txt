00:00:03.480 - 00:00:48.009, Speaker A: Hey everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi Dad. Hey. It is Thursday, September 8, 2022. Thanks for joining us. I am going to be speaking here today with Paul Frobu, which I probably mispronounced his name. Paul is the co founder and CEO of Morpho. So Morpho solves a very familiar but somewhat hidden problem for us as Defi lenders and borrowers.
00:00:48.009 - 00:01:25.245, Speaker A: So if you've ever used AAVE or Compound, you probably have noticed there's a rather large spread or difference between the rate that you lend at versus the rate that borrowers are paying. And cleverly, Morpho has come up with this, I want to call it like a middle layer where it matches lenders and borrowers peer to peer. And the benefit of this is of course, that as a lender you earn a higher rate and as a borrower you borrow at a lower rate. So we're going to talk all about that today, how it works and get to screen share it. So Paul, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:25.415 - 00:01:32.885, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. And the pronunciation was right, but there we go.
00:01:33.905 - 00:02:31.815, Speaker A: Yeah, excellent man. No, funny enough, we, we met at ECC really briefly and I was just recounting that when Paul explained it, you know, it, it was like a problem that again was like somewhat familiar to me, but I don't think I ever paid as close attention to how large that spread was. And so it's just a really interesting new protocol solution that they've come up with because I think it's just a win win all around as, as soon as more folks adopt this. Why would I as a lender, not want to earn higher lending interest? And why as a borrower wouldn't I want to pay lower interest? So before we get started screen sharing, Paul, do you want to share a bit about your background? Like what were you doing before Morpho? And then. Yeah, how did you get started on Morpho?
00:02:32.915 - 00:03:40.279, Speaker B: Yes. So probably the good thing is to start on where I got into crypto, like most founders. And for me it was first through blockchain. So I worked and researched consensus algorithms at first and from there I sort of went up the stack, started working on Ethereum, coded in Solidity, and finally DeFi, where in 2020 I started modeling some protocols like Compound Pool and basically have fun from a theoretical point of view, modeling protocols, modeling their inefficiencies. And when the Lending Pool models came out, I was really impressed by the solution that they had and the design choices that they had done. But at the same time, the first thing that popped into my mind is, well, you have this very big spread. You have a lending API on Compound and Avela is quite low and a borrowing API that is quite high and a 2, 3% spread.
00:03:40.279 - 00:04:37.193, Speaker B: And my first question when looking at it was, why is that so? And really, at the time, what they solved was a problem that you could experience in Eastlands Dharma and those protocols that were very illiquid. So you had to lend and borrow money. You had to post an offer and then wait for someone to actually match your offer. And that was what you could call a peer to peer system. And Compound came out with a pool to peer system where everybody is put into a single smart contract, such that matches are done automatically with the pool itself. And I was impressed by this, but at the same time I realized that, well, you have very few borrowers and you have many, many lenders. And in such model, lenders are going to share the interests paid by the few borrowers.
00:04:37.193 - 00:05:24.655, Speaker B: So if you have three lenders, one borrower, the borrower is going to pay 3% and the lender are each going to earn 1%. So yeah, from there started working on a new solution with some researchers in the research center here in France and built the company mofolabs to work on the protocol. And we raised funds in two rounds recently with Andreessen Horowitz and Environment Co leading our late round. And yeah, we've been live for two months now, growing at 130 million liquidity. We're very happy with how things are going and all the integrations going on and people basically using Morpho to optimize their compound rates and their average rates.
00:05:25.445 - 00:06:26.855, Speaker A: Yeah, I've got lots more questions about how this works under the hood, just what we can expect from like the, from a user experience. But I, I know firsthand it's better to actually show this. So before we actually screen share, just a quick reminder, if you're enjoying this, you know, free content On DeFi and Web3Education, thank my team at 4th Revolution Capital. They are the ones supporting me and enabling me to continue to make content like this. So you can always reach out to us at fourthrevolution Capital if you are a talented builder or creating the next great protocol. That said, Paul, do you want to go ahead and walk us through the dashboard that we're looking at here? Oh, sorry, Paul, you're unmuted. Actually, I think I can unmute you.
00:06:26.855 - 00:06:29.987, Speaker A: There we go. I just did it.
00:06:30.011 - 00:06:30.523, Speaker B: Yep. Sorry.
00:06:30.579 - 00:06:30.979, Speaker A: Okay.
00:06:31.067 - 00:07:02.185, Speaker B: I was struggling anyway. Thank you. So you have to think of morpho as a gateway to compounds. So you have morpho compound for compounds, you have morpho AAVE for aave. And it's really an access point to compound, which is optimized. And it's optimized because it's going to enable you to be matched peer to peer. So remember, you have this compound pool which provides an APY for lending and a different APY for borrowing.
00:07:02.185 - 00:07:55.545, Speaker B: But you can see that here for USDT, for example, you have 3% lend and 4, 5% to borrow. So you have a 1.5% spread, which is due to the fact that you have less borrowers than lenders in that market. What Morpho is going to propose is really simply you're going to lend on morpho and morpho is going to try to, is going to put you into the lending pool compound. And then when a borrower comes in, well, morpho is going to take you out of the lending pool in order to match your peer to peer. And by matching your peer to peer, you, you're just going to agree on a rate where you don't have to share earnings with the rest of the pool, in which case you're going to earn this 3.7%, which is a Pareto improving rate, which means that lenders are going to earn more and borrowers are going to pay less.
00:07:55.545 - 00:09:04.593, Speaker B: And coming to compound through the morpho compound gateway, you'll be provided with the exact same interface, meaning that you can supply and borrow crypto assets, you have the same liquidity available, meaning that, for example, Here you have 77 millions of liquidity that is inherited from the compound liquidity pool. So if you want to make large borrowing positions, you can create large borrowing positions thanks to mofo because it taps directly into compound's liquidity. Same if you want to withdraw at any time, you can withdraw at any time. And we replicate the exact same collateral factors, oracles. So it's really the exact same product as compounds, except that you get this rate improvement. So there's really no trade off in switching from compound to more for compound, basically. So of course you have the two sides of the market, the borrowing rate, the borrowing rate, lending rate, and for example, here on MoFo at the moment you have more borrowers than lenders because rates are kind of attractive.
00:09:04.593 - 00:09:34.321, Speaker B: You could think of eth, for example, heath, it's 3.5% to borrow due to the high utilization of eth because people are farming eth bow well on mofo it's 0.5 and for lending it's 0.5 as well. So yeah, that's the overview. Of course the workflow is really similar to compounds like he supply crypto assets and you borrow some. And that's, that's pretty much it.
00:09:34.321 - 00:09:35.761, Speaker B: That's as simple as that.
00:09:35.953 - 00:10:04.243, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. What's, what's awesome about this is it's just a very simple story to tell. You look on the left and you see, you know, per usual and compound or AAVE that you are able to lend. But what you're looking at in this case, so this is the compound morpho market. You're looking at the base rate that compound. So currently compound is you can lend tether at 3.12%, you can lend comp at 0.26%,
00:10:04.243 - 00:10:59.463, Speaker A: you can lend, we've at 0.31% but on the right side we've got the borrowing rates. And again, if you look market by market, there's a rather large spread. I mean it's probably most distinct when you look at something like the ether market there. And so what's really been like my light bulb moment is thinking about other products that are going to be built using this as more liquidity deposits into morpho. Because right now if you're borrowing on compound, I mean, you're borrowing ether at 3.58% and we're all excited for, you know, this, the transition to proof of stake, which will ultimately, you know, lead to what I think will be an uptick in staking rewards, at least for a short time until more people start staking eth.
00:10:59.463 - 00:11:52.257, Speaker A: And so anytime I could borrow eth myself at a lower rate, significantly lower than what I'm going to earn with staking, that presents a potential opportunity. And so here you, you can borrow. Why would you borrow ether directly on compound at 3.58% when you can pay 0.56% using Morpho? 1 thing though, probably to call out here and we can talk through some more of the risks is obviously morpho is newer, it's only about two months old. So you know, I definitely would paint using AAVE and compound smart contracts as more battle tested. But yeah, this is a tool that I personally think we're going to see more lending and borrowing activity on as, you know, as it matures.
00:11:52.257 - 00:11:59.065, Speaker A: It's, it's, it just, it's a no brainer for me. Like why, why wouldn't you lend at higher rates and borrow at lower rates?
00:11:59.225 - 00:12:20.989, Speaker B: Also just wanted to emphasize Quickly that those improvements as you mentioned, are not like this 20% API improvements. You look at them, it's like a 3% API improvement, but that's native. Right. It's not liquidity mining. It's not, you know, incentives that are given out by the protocol. We do have also more for tokens on top. Right.
00:12:20.989 - 00:12:41.545, Speaker B: But here it's really an innovation that is pushing the capital efficiency of DEFI further. And it's not about providing 10% on your money, it's about providing 2 additional percent, but that are 2% earned through innovation and capital efficiency. TRAC.
00:12:42.245 - 00:13:39.657, Speaker A: Yeah, so that middle column, I want to emphasize this. This all isn't being facilitated by token rewards. You know, this is what the underlying protocol was designed to do. So, you know, this for me is very aligned with the, I don't, I hate to call it a trend because it almost sounds like it's something that's short lived, but I think there's been a major shift in the defi community to think about what can we design that is long term sustainable that, you know, is, let's say, more realistic without having to provide, you know, some insane token rewards. And so this, this is why I think, Paul, when you call this an innovation, like this is an innovation in defi lending and borrowing, that, that really does improve our existing experience as lenders and borrowers.
00:13:39.811 - 00:14:25.445, Speaker B: Yes. And to be honest, I think one of the reasons why people did not notice the Compound and AAVE spread in the first place is because it was hidden by token incentives in the first place. You had so much token incentives that you could not realize that actually the underlying protocol was not so efficient. And if you compare the spreads that AAVEN Compound is proposing compared to traditional finance. Well, actually traditional finance is doing much better than DEFI at this point. And this is basically what we're trying to do is bringing new mechanisms that are closer to the efficiency of traditional finance to say, hey, not only we're decentralized, but we have an efficiency that is competitive with what traditional finance is trying to offer. And that's hard because blockchain is a constrained environment.
00:14:25.445 - 00:14:30.881, Speaker B: But that is not going to stop us from trying to find new ways.
00:14:30.913 - 00:15:26.355, Speaker A: To improve this, Paul. So one thing I'm leaving out here is, you know, when you deposit or when you are borrowing, you're not guaranteed from the start, depending on again which of those you are that you're going to be matched. So for example. Well, actually, could you just walk us through, like which side of the market are we needing more liquidity on and then we can kind of talk through, like if, for example, I'm a lender and I don't and there isn't enough borrowing activity, I might be lending at the base rate on something like AAVE or compound, but once I get matched at a later date, whenever it is that that happens, I'll then be earning a higher rate as a lender or similarly on the borrowing side, I'll benefit from the lower rate.
00:15:26.655 - 00:15:57.141, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So maybe let's do a quick user journey here. So let's say I'm the very first user on the MOFO compound. So what's going to happen is that I'm going to provide some, let's say 100 dai. Okay? So I provide my dai and mofo is going to look for a match, right? But there is no match happening. So what mofo is going to do is just going to put me on compound. So maybe there is this nice give that we usually show, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to find it quickly.
00:15:57.141 - 00:17:08.171, Speaker B: But yeah, there it is. So I supply liquidity, I get the pool apy, but then a borrower comes in and Morpho is going to take me out of the pool and have me experience that peer to peer rate because I'm going to be matched with the borrower and then what's going to happen is that if at some point the borrower decides to leave, or if I decide to leave, well, Morpho is going to either rematch me with another borrower or is going to take me back to the pool. So this GIF is actually showing that worst case scenario for Morpho compound is being compounds and average case scenario is having a better apy. So it's really what we call a parallel improving situation where everything remains the same for you, same liquidity, same parameters, same liquidation parameters, but better rates. And the funny thing is that we've actually proved it like in a formal way and we're about to publish more for yellow paper, which is a 70 pages long formalization of the protocol and formal proving the actual improvements that we're making. But in more rigorous terms I would.
00:17:08.203 - 00:17:17.895, Speaker A: Say you'll have to remind me on the website there are some references to a token. So there isn't a token live though yet. Right.
00:17:18.475 - 00:18:14.433, Speaker B: So on Morpho you have let me do it. There is a MOFO token, but the MOFO token is not transferable. So the token is a bit the same way EULER has launched their token, so it's transferred to users. So you can currently farm, you can currently farm the MoFo token here. Here you have a rate of how much Morpho token you'd be getting if you, if you supply $1,000, assuming this rate does not move and the token is going to be distributed to users and at some point those users will be able to decide for the transferability of the token. And I think to me is quite neat way to decentralize a protocol while still incentivizing it in a clean way. So yes, there is a token, but it's not currently listed.
00:18:14.433 - 00:18:25.795, Speaker B: It does not have a price because it's not transferable. But once it has a price, it will most likely have a market. Once it's transferable, sorry, it would most likely have a market and thus will have a price.
00:18:27.055 - 00:18:54.213, Speaker A: Got it. So, okay, so we'll look forward to the paper coming out right now. If we're a lender or borrower, we're earning a non transferable token. So nothing to really take action on there. And I think just to underscore once more, everything, all of the sort of like benefits wrapped up in this. This is based on the fundamental mechanics of what's in the protocol.
00:18:54.309 - 00:19:08.425, Speaker B: Tokens are just. Tokens are just extra. Yeah. So on top of the strict improvement that we do from compound, you get another improvement which is the API in tokens. But really this is not the most important thing.
00:19:08.805 - 00:20:11.755, Speaker A: Yeah, there's been quite a few protocols like, let's say Instadap. Instadap had these Instadapp light vaults which for a time were doing well and then I, I would say got started to get blown up when ether rates skyrocketed. And so those have actually corrected since then. But my point is being able to borrow at better rates is obviously something that more would seek out, especially to incorporate into different sorts of products where let's say you're borrowing against a like asset where let's say we, we borrow against staff like the Insta Dap light vault. And so yeah, I just, I keep looking at the rates here and thinking to myself like it's just a matter of time before someone designs a product here. But built taking advantage of the, the better rates here offered on Morpho.
00:20:12.655 - 00:20:15.471, Speaker B: Actually many are already working on it, so.
00:20:15.623 - 00:20:17.271, Speaker A: Oh, excellent. Oh, that's great.
00:20:17.343 - 00:20:45.091, Speaker B: Yeah, that's. Yeah. So we're in touch with most of the lending pool users. Like, I mean the biggest protocols out there that are working with lending pools. And it was, you know, Morpho is really an educational problem. You know, you have to explain to people how it works, well, you get better rates. But then once people understand, it's a complete no brainer to use Morpho rather than Compound, for example.
00:20:45.091 - 00:21:15.885, Speaker B: So mofo compound for compound and mofo AAVE for aave. And when you explain to those protocols, they're like, hey, it makes sense, let's do our due diligence regarding the code, which is something important to do. And by the way, I would encourage anyone to look at our security and audits documents here. We've done more than 12 audits in total with the best auditors in the world. And yeah, and so they do their due diligence and then they say, hey, that's just an obvious thing to do. So we just integrate.
00:21:16.425 - 00:21:28.925, Speaker A: What are some of the other risks that you should consider as a user? So smart contract exploits per usual. But yeah. Anything else that's more top of mind here?
00:21:29.365 - 00:22:03.895, Speaker B: No. So really smart contract risk is the like is the one that in any protocol you have to be taken care of. But really Morpho reproduces the same oracles. So there is. You don't have this oracle risk thing that you have in lending pools because basically we don't claim to be completely safe. We claim to be as safe as compound for Morph for compound or as safe as AAVE for Morph. AAVE for oracles, for example.
00:22:03.895 - 00:22:33.605, Speaker B: Same for liquidation parameters. We have the same parameters. So morpho is really about replicating the exact product but with improved rates basically. But I would say that the most important one is obviously smart contract and this is why we take so much care about it. By the way, we're formal proving as well the morpho protocol. So the protocol on top of being audited is formally proven, meaning that we have researchers internally that are going to prove mathematically that the code is correct.
00:22:34.625 - 00:23:18.855, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. And just to reemphasize any of the risks that you would incur in using compound or aave, you know, just, you can assume that you're inheriting those because this is really a layer that sits on top of that. And what's exciting here is I think that this is a part of that next wave of DEFI that is going to fuel new interest in using these products. It was Compound and AAVE and Maker and others that really were radical visions for building when they launched. Now that we've got something like dai, that's very battle tested, you know, even for.
00:23:19.015 - 00:23:19.359, Speaker B: For.
00:23:19.407 - 00:24:03.135, Speaker A: For what downside some of the other stable coins have, you know, let's, you know, remind ourselves of just how long they've existed and you know how much of a stress test they've been through. But my point is, is the, the dependability of an AAVE or compound is part of the reason that we're able to start to now build these layers on top of it. And there will be others that, that are building on top of what in the future, I would expect others will be building on top of Morpho. So Paul, anything else in terms of call to action that you'd recommend for folks who want to learn about Morpho or get involved with the protocol?
00:24:03.635 - 00:25:12.763, Speaker B: I think we have a pretty cool website. It just takes you through the explanation of what Morpho is, what it does, and explaining step by step what you should be aware of. So I would encourage anyone that want to learn more about Morpho to basically go through this website and, and read through it. I think educating yourself about Morpho is more important than actually using it. And once you understand it then it would feel obvious if you actually need to use it for your personal usage or for your protocol, for example. But yeah, just coming back to what you just said on avencamp, I think it's very interesting to see that in the first place, in 2017, 18 you had this peer to peer era that was sort of initiated with Eastland Domo and all those peer to peer protocols and resulted in the first age of Defi, if I may, that resulted in some sort of what some, some would could say it's a failure because it was not adopted. But then those pool models came over.
00:25:12.763 - 00:25:50.375, Speaker B: It was really a complete paradigm shift because they realized that peer to peer that was directly inspired from traditional finance was capital efficient, but it was not liquid. And so they brought the lending pool and they brought Uniswap that is much more liquid and much more suited for the Ethereum blockchain constraints. But then by bringing pools you lose a little bit of capital efficiency. So here we go. Morpho brings back peer to peer on top of the landing pool in order to bring efficiency on top while preserving the good properties of a lending pool.
00:25:51.875 - 00:26:06.735, Speaker A: Paul, also, any future integrations that we should be looking to like, you know, I'm thinking of like Defi Saver, Instadap. Any other power tools that are already in the works?
00:26:07.395 - 00:26:46.775, Speaker B: No, so actually a lot of them. I think one of our co founders tweeted that autumn is going to be the intent integration season for Morpho and basically all that I can talk about were already announced. But for the rest it's still work. In progress. And I would encourage anyone to follow at Morpholabs where we announced integration that were done on the Morpho protocol or partnership announcement between Morpho and another protocol. But you could think of any potential compound users that we're already in discussion with them. I mean every big one.
00:26:46.775 - 00:26:55.175, Speaker B: So yeah, does not mean that everyone is going to come over, of course, but many are already work in progress. Yes.
00:26:55.595 - 00:27:44.135, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, dude, congrats on all the success so far. It's crazy to see you're, you're at, what was it, like 130 million has been deposited into the protocol. I mean that, that, that's a, that's a huge number compared to just a few weeks ago. And like I said, I'm not an investor in Morpho. Just per usual ran into it exploring new Defi products and thankfully we talked at ECC and it's really solving an obvious challenge in Defi lending and borrowing. So I'm hoping that more will sort of have the same light bulb moment because like I said, it's just a no brainer, win, win for lenders and borrowers.
00:27:44.135 - 00:28:33.105, Speaker A: Well, if you all enjoyed this, don't forget to subscribe@bigiedad.com be sure to follow my profile. Defi dad on Lens Tube so Lens Tube is a new web3 media that is powered by the Lens Protocol and it's built with Airweave and it's powered on Polygon. Anyways, it basically looks like YouTube, but you're, you know, 100 in control of, of, you know, your data and you don't have to ultimately depend on a centralized entity to allow you to stay on the platform or kick you out. So we're really excited to start putting out more media on Lens Tube. But that all said, Paul, anything else you wanted to share before we go?
00:28:33.525 - 00:28:46.305, Speaker B: No, just wanted to thank you for having me here and for having this light bulb. As you said about Morpho, I'm excited about more and more people having it and I'm expecting that more and more are coming.
00:28:47.365 - 00:29:12.955, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. And one last shout out again to my team at 4th Revolution Capital. If you're a builder like Paul, if you're Creating next great D5 protocol, please reach out to me and my team here at FourthRevolution Capital. All right, we're going to end the broadcast there. Thanks everyone for joining. Thanks, Paul.
00:29:12.955 - 00:29:16.235, Speaker A: Actually, we'll be in a green room in a sec. Bye everyone.
00:29:16.815 - 00:29:17.045, Speaker B: By.
