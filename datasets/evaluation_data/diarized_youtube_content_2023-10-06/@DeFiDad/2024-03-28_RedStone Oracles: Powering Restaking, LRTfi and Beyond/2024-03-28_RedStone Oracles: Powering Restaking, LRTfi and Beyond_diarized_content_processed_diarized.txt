00:00:00.280 - 00:00:31.794, Speaker A: So we are very pragmatic at our approach and basically listen to the Defi builders. We attend every single call for us. We just go there, ask what people want, and deliver that within the time frame they expect to get. So days or weeks instead of months. So every single opportunity to listen to what people actually need is our bread and butter. And these are the main reasons that protocols such as Pendle, Morpho, Silo, Venus decided to use Redstone Oracles.
00:00:34.414 - 00:00:38.726, Speaker B: Welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad here with nomadic from four rc.
00:00:38.870 - 00:00:42.006, Speaker C: Today's show spotlights Redstone Oracles, the leader.
00:00:42.070 - 00:00:45.774, Speaker B: In oracles powering lsts and LRT Defi.
00:00:45.894 - 00:00:48.182, Speaker C: Redstone supports many of the most popular.
00:00:48.238 - 00:00:57.570, Speaker B: Defi protocols in 2024, including Etherfi, Renzo, Pendle, Athena, and Morpho. In this episode, we speak with the.
00:00:57.602 - 00:01:05.586, Speaker C: Founders of Redstone about the vision behind this younger Oracle protocol, how they compete with incumbents like Chainlink, and what plans.
00:01:05.610 - 00:01:09.530, Speaker B: They have to grow to serve even more defi in 2024.
00:01:09.682 - 00:01:11.450, Speaker C: But before we do, just a quick.
00:01:11.482 - 00:01:14.614, Speaker B: Word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.
00:01:17.794 - 00:02:04.104, Speaker C: Introducing flat money, the first decentralized delta neutral flatcoin built on base with sustainable yield that's completely untethered from legacy finance. Because Defi needs an uncensorable based unit of currency, you can mint unit with Reth, which is held in the protocol's shared liquidity pool, where it's borrowed by leveraged traders. As a leveraged trader, you can deposit your margin collateral and go long on re. If you're trading in the perpetual futures market, you'll pay unit holders to open leverage positions. If you're holding unit, you'll earn yield from liquidations, borrow rate and trading fees, preserve your purchasing power, and offset your exposure to crypto market volatility. Learn more at flat money restaking summer.
00:02:04.144 - 00:02:33.044, Speaker D: Is dawning and swell is expanding. Harnessing the power of rsuite, swell is building the L2 for liquid restaking. That means native restaking yield on a chain built with polygons, ZkevM technology in collaboration with Alt layer chainlink and Eigen Da. Look out for swells. Layer two in swell city.
00:02:35.904 - 00:03:07.606, Speaker E: Introducing the mantle liquid staking protocol mantle LSP, a permissionless, non custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum l one and governed by mantle. With mantle, LSP, users can stake ETH to instantly receive meat, earn yield, and accumulate rewards. The longer you stake meth is the value accumulating receipt token that will give you access to expanded yield opportunities. Stake and watch your yield grow with.
00:03:07.630 - 00:03:46.294, Speaker C: Mantle LSP introducing Kelp Dao, the first liquid restaking platform for lsts. With kelp, anyone can deposit Steth by lido, ethex by stator or SfRx, ETH by Frax and mint, a liquid restaking token called rseth. With RSETh, you can participate in your favorite DeFi platforms and get 100% of all Eigen lair points plus kelp miles. A fresh wave of restaking is here. Restaking that's liquid, rewarding and convenient. Learn more today at Kelpdao Xyz Restake.
00:03:47.724 - 00:04:29.054, Speaker F: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multichain UX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas. One gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadapp's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:29.914 - 00:04:34.474, Speaker C: All right, let's introduce Jakob and Marcin, the founders of Redstone Oracles.
00:04:34.634 - 00:04:37.946, Speaker B: Jakob and Marcin, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:38.050 - 00:04:39.714, Speaker A: Very well. Thank you for having us.
00:04:39.834 - 00:05:34.418, Speaker B: So what prompted this conversation is we were recently at ETH Denver and nomadic, and I had been taking notice of the fact that with all of the different liquid restaking defi that we've been using, what's powering that is Redstone Oracles. And so it's been really a nice surprise to see a team that we've known the brand over the years, and now we're seeing the result of all of that hard work. And so when I think of Redstone, I think of the leading oracle system for liquid restaking Defi. And so that's what we're going to talk here today about with Marcin and Jakob. So we're going to let you tell the rest of the story here. So would either of you be willing to kick off with just a little bit more about the background of Redstone? Like, when was Redstone founded? And I guess, like, what was the mission and getting started with it.
00:05:34.506 - 00:05:54.494, Speaker G: So, first of all, thanks for having us. It's a privilege to be, to be on your podcast, a big fan of everything you've built in the space. Especially, I recall you from the Defi summer when I was playing as a couch hedge fund manager.
00:05:55.474 - 00:05:56.214, Speaker A: And.
00:05:58.494 - 00:06:49.008, Speaker G: Obviously at that moment, I was also a smart contract auditor. It's good to match both skills as we are seeing new food coins, some with a very elegant mechanism to rug pull users, other which are secure and safe to invest. But also what struck me then was the fact that you got like hundreds of tokens being issued every, every week and training was offering prices for, I don't know, maybe like top 20 of them. So it gets me to the question like, there must be something we can innovate in that space and maybe some structural issues. So I started to think about a new model that is more scalable. That was the late 2020. And then we came with the idea of restaurant Oracles.
00:06:49.008 - 00:07:06.400, Speaker G: And before that I'm a software engineer by trade, spend more than ten years in traditional finance. So banking, insurance, all of this boring stuff. And then since 2016 in the blockchain, which is like super, super exciting.
00:07:06.592 - 00:07:44.498, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks. So myself in late 2017, I was writing my bachelor thesis about blockchain technology and bitcoin and potential future applications. I got hooked in. I graduated quantitative methods in economics. So statistical and economical background led me to first product manager in various startups, then as a product manager in Google Cloud. And late 2020 was when my old fellow Jacob reached out to me saying, hey, Marcin, they want to team up to disrupt the oracle space. And I was like, this is the adventure of the lifetime, so let's go.
00:07:44.498 - 00:07:49.002, Speaker A: And then together we kick off the Redstone journey.
00:07:49.138 - 00:08:11.084, Speaker B: Guys, before we talk more about Redstone, I'm thinking we should give some context around just oracles. So if you're newer to defi, it's a word that comes up quite a bit. It has often come up in relation to exploits. So can you just give us a high level overview of the importance of oracles in Defi?
00:08:11.194 - 00:09:06.952, Speaker G: In my view, it's like one of the most important building blocks for this defi puzzle is a core element. This is responsible for the security. So if you are using any lending protocols, like depositing some extra funds on AAVE or compound, etcetera, there needs to be a mechanism that can make sure that the amount you deposited is larger than the amount you are taking out of the protocol. So in other words, like, there needs to be a mechanism that makes the protocol solvent. In oracle, with the ability to provide accurate pricings of whatever assets is inside. The Defi protocol can help us to operate still trustlessly and also give us the freedom to move assets around as we always get the access to their real market value.
00:09:07.088 - 00:09:24.368, Speaker H: Guys, let's dig into Redstone, maybe give us the high level of what you're doing and what you think is special about your approach. And then also if you can kind of tell us, like, how do you begin to compete with like Chainlink and, and then PiF, who's made up a lot of ground recently as well.
00:09:24.456 - 00:10:10.418, Speaker A: So we are very pragmatic at our approach and basically listen to the Defi builders. We attend every single conference. Recently came back from Eve Denver. We've been to devconnect in Istanbul, previously in Defcon and Bogota. So every single opportunity to put the ear on the ground and listen to what people actually need is our bread and butter. And whenever we hear a new trend like we spotted in approximately March, April 2023, the LST five boom. So liquid staking tokens narrative, we partnered up with swell to be the first and only Oracle to provide their liquid staking token, which is sweat.
00:10:10.418 - 00:11:28.210, Speaker A: And then we went down this rabbit hole with other partnerships like Stator stakewise, redacted Cartel stake zone. And right now we are the major LST provider on the market and we basically focus on delivering what people ask, not creating like fluffy advertisements on our website or Twitter. We just go there, ask what people want and deliver that within a time frame they expect to get so days or weeks instead of months. Another advantage that gives us a lot in the market is that we offer the two most popular Oracle models, which is that pull based Oracle and the push based Oracle. So we started with the first one and then as the market needed, also like more versatile assets in the push Oracle, we expanded into that too. And these are the main reasons that protocols such as Pendle, Morpho, Silo, Venus decided to use Redstone Oracles. This is also the reason why we are the main Oracle right now on networks like Monta mode, Avalanche subnets, and we also recently won the Blast Big Bad competition.
00:11:28.322 - 00:11:39.414, Speaker B: I think this is one of the things that really struck me about your team is the ambition to carve out a part of this sector.
00:11:39.994 - 00:11:42.710, Speaker C: And so one thing that I've wondered.
00:11:42.742 - 00:12:42.190, Speaker B: About is, as you've continued to integrate with more and more of the liquid restaking sector of Defi, can you talk about some of the benefits of that? I'm thinking of the composability, but I'm also thinking for every new application that you integrate with, I guess, does it make it that much easier for other protocols to want to integrate? Like, I'm not referring to a confidence or reputation sort of aspect, of course, as folks see the name Redstone getting used more and more, they're going to be that much more willing to want to sign up and work with you. But from a technical standpoint, or maybe a composability standpoint, what sort of benefits are there as Redstone continues to proliferate working with as many teams as you do?
00:12:42.302 - 00:14:13.750, Speaker G: I think technically, if you are looking at the LST space from that angle, it's a very interesting type of assets. It's a different kind of animal if you compare it to other tokens like BTC or F, which are very often traded as LSTs are supposed to be pegged the basic underlying token, which is mostly ethereum, and they are designed to be a store of value rather than the speculative asset. So a lot of methodologies used to discover the price of an asset so far, which are based on the trading volumes, etcetera, didn't work well for lsds. So we needed to design a new methodology which is based on the liquidity that is stored on dexs and takes into account the slippage in the real time so we can automatically add new data sources or detach the pools where the liquidity drops and the price is no longer robust. Help us to specialize in the price provision for lsds. So the knowledge of preparing a price discovery mechanism for the first project help us with the second one, etc, etcetera. And we believe that we already get a good knowledge and experience like how to offer a stable and secure pricing mechanics for LSD's I want to quickly.
00:14:13.782 - 00:14:29.532, Speaker H: Go back to something Marcin said. You mentioned two terms. You mentioned push and pull oracles hoping that maybe one of you can, just at a very high level, as non technical as possible, just explain briefly what those two are.
00:14:29.628 - 00:15:37.774, Speaker G: The push model is the first original model that was introduced by chain link. And if you need a price on chain in the protocol, there is an external service that is pushing the update on chain on certain conditions, like every few hours, or when the price deviates from the one that is already on chain by a certain percentage, etcetera. So you get this magical external helper that is pushing the price regardless if it's going to be used or not used. So it's always available on chain, but also so it's very convenient for protocols to use it. The price is always on chain, but you need to pay for pushing that actively, and you need to pay the same price if the data is being used actively or not. And obviously you cannot push it every block, so there is always some delay or some deviation from the outside world. In the pool model, there's a different assumption.
00:15:37.774 - 00:16:18.960, Speaker G: Like everyone can bring the price only when that's necessary. So the data is being injected on chain together with a user transaction. There are like a small technical differences, but basically when you need a price, you just need to take it and then verify it on chain and consume it. But obviously it's got some advantage, like the price is more up to date, it's more accurate by the process of using that together with users transaction. Sometimes it's a bit more complex, so it's harder for protocols to switch to the new model to integrate, etcetera. Got it.
00:16:19.032 - 00:16:20.204, Speaker A: I appreciate that.
00:16:21.304 - 00:16:41.398, Speaker H: I think I'm also just curious about where Redstone is. I'm not sure how big of a net you're casting throughout all the different, I guess, l one s, l two s, ethereum, where are you primarily focused right now? Is it mostly Ethereum and l two s? Or like how far out have you deployed Redstone?
00:16:41.526 - 00:17:26.999, Speaker A: So the Redstone core, the pool model, is natively compatible with any EVM network. So it's compatible with Ethereum, it's compatible with Arbitrum, Optimus, Zksync. Also in the future, l three s and force, as you are going to keep the stack going up. Therefore, we are also a fantastic partner for rollup as a service providers such as Caldera, Gelato, conduit, Alt layer. So whenever a new roll up pops up and it's an EVM compatible one, we can very quickly make our pull model available over there, because we are not dependent on any bridging or other service. It's natively EVM compatible. So EVM is our bread and butter with the push model of ours.
00:17:26.999 - 00:17:56.482, Speaker A: Redstone Classic. It depends where people need us. And apparently chainlink in the past months became a bit slower to deploy to these networks. Therefore we are the main Oracle, as I mentioned on Manta blast mode. So to deploy to the all editors on top of bitcoin, like Merlin chain, B squared, Bob botanics, and basically we want to be very nimble and support all of the new ecosystems that are popping up in the defi space.
00:17:56.618 - 00:19:04.504, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like from what I've known firsthand, watching you work with teams like term finance, there was Etherfi among some of the others that you've mentioned. I mean, I wanna call out the fact that there are some interesting differences in the tech, but I also just recognize there is that nimbleness that you called out and we needed more oracle providers in the space. And honestly, Pith surprised me. Pith was not a team that I was tracking closely until they just became that much bigger. And so I think the Defi space really everything benefits from that much more competition. And again, you've now carved out this sort of brand or reputation as the nimble oracle protocol. The folks that are working with the bleeding edge of lrts and lots of l two defi.
00:19:04.504 - 00:19:23.572, Speaker B: That said then, I'm curious, with the lead that you've created within the liquid restaking sector, how are you thinking to capitalize on that? How do you use that advantage that you've created to grow more?
00:19:23.708 - 00:20:49.654, Speaker G: Yeah, I think liquid risk taking, but in general, the risk taking or the shared security movements like a super interesting topic because it opens a new design space on the blockchain. So it gives new tools, new possibilities. Something that we are actively pursuing right now is the ability to create, let's say an own consensus model within the space of rest taking. It's all often goes by the acronym AV's. So a dedicated validation service that could be used to basically give you an extra power of performing some computation, borrowing the security from the rest taking, but also running and having access to all of the network of operators. So translating that to the, let's say an example how it could be utilized by an Oracle like Redstone. So the Oracles you mentioned usually gets their own networks, like Chainlink is running their own off chain reporting network.
00:20:49.654 - 00:21:17.150, Speaker G: They've obviously utilized Solana heavily, but the risk taking and avss with the operator networks give us this amazing environment to borrow the security and use it to aggregate the information about prices, but also aggregate the signatures. And in that way we can make the consumption of data published by restaurant nodes even cheaper and more accessible.
00:21:17.302 - 00:21:42.234, Speaker B: So while we're on the topic of security, it is a top priority, I would imagine, for any Oracle protocol. What can you share about how Redstone approaches security? I'm curious also, will Redstone ever look to basically draw upon the security of Eigen lair once it's fully up and running?
00:21:42.614 - 00:23:17.514, Speaker G: Yeah, you are absolutely right. Security is king in the business and we are trying to do absolutely our best to offer robust and stable prices to the customers. Obviously we utilize multiple sources, we get different redundancy mechanisms, we got a network of data providers. But there is like a question like how can you make sure that the data providers are acting as they are supposed to be? So they are like providing the correct prices? Like what's the incentives for them, what's the carrot, what's the stake? And how can you basically punish them for not doing the job as they promised to? So the common mechanism is with the token incentives. So we need to have like a collateral and in case you are just running naughty and providing correct prices, then you are risking to be slashed. But obviously another question is like what's the total value on stake was the market cap of a newcomer like Reston compared to the incumbents like Chainlink, which is a great project, and they managed to already build a strong capital into their market cap and therefore a very strong security mechanism. So the possibility that's currently open with rest taking is the fact that you can flexibly manage the security level.
00:23:17.514 - 00:24:04.122, Speaker G: So for the new projects like Redstone, you can borrow security from all of the stakers so all of the LRT tokens can contribute to rest on security at the beginning. And when we grow and when we start increasing the value of our internal tokens, then we can rebalance that because the AV's and the eigenvalue rest taking allow a double token model when the security could be derived from the internal tokens of protocols, but also borrowed from all of the risk takers. So it's like an amazing launchpad for the new projects to pair with the existing and major protocols.
00:24:04.298 - 00:25:11.284, Speaker I: Maverick protocol provides innovative liquidity solutions for token projects to customize, automate and incentivize their liquidity with the highest efficiency in DeFi, all powered by Maverick Amm why has Maverick become the first choice for all kinds of token projects, from stablecoins to lrts as the first dynamic distribution Amm Maverick AMm provides automated liquidity movement modes which move your liquidity to follow price, keeping it where it does the most good. This enables Maverick powered pools to process higher volume with lower TVL requirements and means that Maverick supports the highest capital efficiency for lrts. Like we ETH. Maverick Amm also supports non uniform liquidity distributions, making it easy to concentrate liquidity in shapes that fit each projects individually needs. Finally, Maverick boosted positions maximize incentive efficiency for protocols looking to bootstrap their token liquidity to precise strategic areas of a liquidity pool. Token communities like Lido, Aave, Swell, Ethify and Kelpdao have been bootstrapping TVL and maintaining peg using Maverick tools ready to build liquidity with maximal efficiency.

00:25:13.534 - 00:25:35.990, Speaker H: Guys a few months back I learned a new term that I'd never heard about and it was this oracle extractable value oev. Kind of became a hot topic when UMA launched Oval. I would love if you guys can break down for us. What is OEV and maybe how is Redstone thinking about it in the most.
00:25:36.022 - 00:27:15.892, Speaker G: Of the customers of oracles currently are the lending protocols, and from time to time they need to liquidate part of their position, for example, if the value of the collateral drops below a safe level. So in a scenario when if is dumping and the value of collateral is dropping, then there is opportunity for liquidators to come in and help to remove the collateral from the protocol, helping the solvency of the protocol, but also to incentivize the liquidators that are capable to take some bonus, some benefit as a percentage of the liquidated collateral. And it's a very lucrative business. So last year it was more than 150 millions generated through liquidation bonuses, and usually the first come, the first to get the reward. So if the price is moving very rapidly and there's opportunity for liquidations, all of the liquidation bonds are competing for the block space, therefore paying a lot to MeV bots, a lot of gas fees, etcetera, to be the first one to execute liquidation. And OEV is a concept to move the value accrual from the MEV bots and blockbuilders to the hands of protocols and oracles. And it was like super interesting idea by Uma.
00:27:15.892 - 00:28:16.568, Speaker G: It's great that they opened this new discussion, like how could it be implemented? We are not certain that's the best way to do it right now because Uma was piggybacking of chainlink prices and I'm not sure if chainlink or the lending protocols were like super happy about it, but also it was like a very well explained possibility for the fact that you can utilize the data that is held by oracles to create that value. And we at Redstone we get a different layer for data distribution so we can make the data accessible really quickly to all of the potential solvers in a mechanism very similar to for example cow swap, so they can propose a solution, etcetera, without introducing like an unnecessary delay. So that's our goal. And it will be like prototyping that soon with the partnering lending protocols.
00:28:16.656 - 00:28:50.272, Speaker B: Guys, we'll probably begin to wrap up soon. But ive got to ask one question. Imagining as a listener hearing about Redstone learning about oracles, theyve got to be wondering why do I choose this over chain link? So if I were a protocol considering integrating, and obviously you dont have a whole lot of other context there, but whats somewhat of the elevator pitch there around why I might choose Redstone over Chainlink.
00:28:50.328 - 00:30:06.684, Speaker A: So Chainlink was one of the major building block of defi summer back in 2020 and delivered a lot of goods for the whole ecosystem. But as the company grew bigger, right now they are definitely slower to innovate and pick up the new narratives. So if you're a builder of a Defi protocol, what excites you the most in 2024 is probably liquid restaking or alternative La one S or l two s roller business service or maybe Athena, which also offers very interesting model and yield. So we partner with all the upcoming players because we have way quicker speed of execution. It's in terms of, again, days and weeks instead of months. Second thing is, Chainlink right now is very actively pursuing the bridging strategy with their CCIP product, and we hear from our customers that their requests for Oracle sometimes get neglected and we are very happy to support them in their journey of expansion. Another thing is Redstone is picking the market share very rapidly, especially in the last months.
00:30:06.684 - 00:30:56.716, Speaker A: Recently, Gauntlet and open Zeppelin have performed an audit on Redstone of both market risk and security risk perspective and gave green light to integrate by one of the largest protocol out there in the Defi space. Redstone as an oracle for a new market similar to Lama risk for Prisma. And right now Prisma LRT is utilizing only Redstone oracles. So these are very important gains and it also shows like the traction where the innovation happens. Right now, I want to keep this nimbleness, but for sure not giving up on security, because Jacob as ex opens Zeppelin Kochak auditor, he keeps a very tough hand on all the security aspects whenever we want to expand in the market.
00:30:56.820 - 00:31:21.000, Speaker H: Guys, I just want to also bring up pith here as well. Another oracle provider, they leverage wormhole for their cross chain functionality. But I'm curious how Redstone achieves this. Like, how were you able to expand to so many l two s and do what you did and are you using an external provider like pith is or. Yeah, basically, how are you achieving that?
00:31:21.072 - 00:32:43.434, Speaker G: We really respect it because in terms of the data latency and data quality, they've done an absolutely amazing job and what they achieve on Solana is remarkable. But also we are not convinced that using an existing technology from bridging assets or moving tokens from one network to another and applying that to move data is that is the best choice because that's, that's technology like super heavy and we are, when we are running benchmarks, I think it's just expensive to take the wormfold bridge, which is a amazing technology, but for moving assets and apply it to moving like small data pieces, sometimes it's too expensive. So what we've done, we've developed our own technology for a super lightweight verification of data it's like amazing, let's say puzzles for us. So we got ten developers in the teams and we're like trying to skip every extra unit of gas, just never getting out of the call data, manually shifting bits so we can be as cheap as possible because we believe that in the long term that's what matters. I think all of the L two protocols is really looking for efficiency and you can save even a tiny piece of their codes. That's going to help.
00:32:43.514 - 00:32:59.932, Speaker H: Guys, one thing I wanted to ask is we've kind of seen you be early to this LST wave and then early to the LRT wave as well. I would love to ask what's the next trend you're seeing forming or what are you getting excited about in the space right now?
00:33:00.068 - 00:33:44.718, Speaker A: One of the things we have to go into more details probably in the next weeks also is utilizing of restaking for oracles. From the three players we mentioned, Chainlink, Pif and Redstone. We are the only one really positioned to tap into the restaking shared security and utilize all of that ETH. I think right now it's like $10 billion to protect our oracle and validate data feeds. And this is massive overlook, period. I wouldn't say it's going to happen overnight because these are very delicate pieces, but over a longer period it will give us like an unfair advantage. Another thing I want to mention is the bow of Itina.
00:33:44.718 - 00:34:33.563, Speaker A: Like the guys got almost $1 billion in TvL over, I don't know, three, four, maybe seven weeks. And we are the main oracle for their both products, USDe and susde. And now very important thing not only on Ethereum, you can use that, but we also deliver it already on Montel, which is n two. But also we are going to bring it to other ecosystems and maybe to close with one of the ideas I cannot tease fully. We are partnering with one of the major l two right now to create a unique utilization of Redstone as the oracle for their specific ecosystem. I cannot tell you which one it is and what it does, but within the next one or two months, expect something big from us.
00:34:33.643 - 00:34:34.659, Speaker C: Guys, I think this is a great.
00:34:34.691 - 00:35:04.893, Speaker B: Place for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners that they should learn about Redstone by going to Redstone finance. They should follow Redstone defi on Twitter. For updates on Redstone, they can follow Martin's Twitter handle. We'll put that into our show notes. It's just his first and then underscore part of his last name. One, three, and then we've got Kuba ETH for Jakob.
00:35:04.893 - 00:35:33.550, Speaker B: So again, you can find that all in our show notes so you can easily reference it. Guys, thanks so much for going into the weeds on really something that I'll admit I am no expert in oracles, but I benefit from using them with all of the defi that we use daily. That said, what would be your recommendation for folks that want to get involved with Redstone or possibly integrate with Redstone Oracles?
00:35:33.702 - 00:36:33.482, Speaker A: So one closing thought that we haven't measured that much is also we work very closely with Etherfi and we are cooking in the books like a special integration with them. So be on the lookout. And also in 2024 most likely we will be planning to launch our Redstone token. There is no concrete date and we are thinking about incentivizing the projects that are actively using Redstone Oracles. But we of course, can I cannot confirm like any speculation on airdrop because it's a sensitive topic, but we have some plans to replicate the common ground on the market. If you want to get into the weeds of Redstone, we are launching right now season one of the Redstone expedition. If you go to our website on the top tab, you can go to expedition and see what tasks and activities you can perform for the involved community members.
00:36:33.482 - 00:37:15.612, Speaker A: We have the call Redstone Miners ambassador program so you can become a Redstone miner. And there are going to be tons of incentives for users of the dapps that are utilizing Redstone oracles on many of the networks. Last but not least, you can always be on the lookout of the red vests and red swag because on conferences we give out pretty interesting merchandise. Defi dad and pneumatic Edith Devere got from me not only socks and napkins like for the glasses, but also underwear. So we try to be creative with the swag as well because we know this is how DeFi ecosystem rolls.
00:37:15.708 - 00:37:27.464, Speaker B: And every time I transact with lrTs, I wear that Redstone underwear, you know, to feel more secure. Guys, thanks so much. This was fantastic.
00:37:27.584 - 00:37:40.104, Speaker C: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
