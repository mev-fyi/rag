00:00:03.210 - 00:00:20.750, Speaker A: All right, we'll give it a second. All right. There we go. We're live. Cool. Hey, so welcome, everyone. This is a new segment I'm going to be experimenting with called Defi Talks with Defi dad.
00:00:20.750 - 00:01:07.214, Speaker A: This will be hosted on my YouTube channel@defydad.com, the goal is just to be able to hit upon some of the biggest news events in Defi, to be able to screen share with founders that are building the future of Defi. And so today seemed like a good day to kick this off. We've got Hugh Karp, who is the founder of Nexus Mutual. Nexus Mutual is the leading provider of, I would call it DeFi insurance, but it's more properly called cover. It allows you to protect the value of your assets in different DeFi protocols, whether you're on Ethereum or now on any chain. And we're going to talk all about what this new protocol cover offers.
00:01:07.214 - 00:01:14.146, Speaker A: And. Yeah, Hugh, just excited to have you. Thanks for joining me. How's it going?
00:01:14.328 - 00:01:26.214, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's great to be here. Thanks. Yeah, I'm excited to give a go of your new stream. Yeah, exciting day for us at Nexus. So, yeah, a big product update. It's been great.
00:01:26.332 - 00:01:59.902, Speaker A: Yeah. And to clarify, yield TV isn't going, uh. There are lots of conversations that I have outside of the scope of yield TV that I've always wanted to host conversations around. So this is it. We'll be hopefully doing some more ad hoc discussions. And if you ever have ideas or there's topics you'd like to be covered, just shoot me a message on Twitter. Also, though, I would remind you to check out yieldtv at TV Zapper Phi.
00:01:59.902 - 00:02:17.830, Speaker A: And yeah, otherwise we'll get right into it. Hugh, in case anyone is new to Nexus, why don't we talk about what's your background? Like, when did you start Nexus? And maybe you could help them to come up to speed on what's the mission behind Nexus.
00:02:18.330 - 00:02:47.826, Speaker B: Yeah, so whirlwind tour. I'm an insurance professional. I'm an actuary. I've been doing insurance stuff for a long time, 15 years before doing starting Nexus. And I guess I got really interested in the tech, like bitcoin and being able to pay people without anyone else in the middle. And that's kind of what really drew me in. But then we had Ethereum launch and I guess that's when it really clicked for me.
00:02:47.826 - 00:03:51.746, Speaker B: Because if you could write an if then statement, then you could essentially do an insurance contract. And if we had technology to coordinate people, especially around financial incentives, then that's basically just an insurance company. It's a group of people sharing risk together and deciding how they share that pot of money or what they do with that pot of money. Insurance is always fundamentally about a community sharing risk with each other. It's about people sharing risk with each other. And so big shareholder based insurance companies have come in because that's actually the most efficient way we have of sharing risk amongst communities right now. But I guess Nexus's philosophy is that now we have this new tech that can do it in a much more efficient way and just coordinate the people directly rather than rely on the centralized entity with all of its fat and excess waste within the system, I guess, is what we're trying to strip out and bring it right back down to the community driven incentives.
00:03:51.746 - 00:04:31.138, Speaker B: And if we can do that, we can really make it scale and we can really do this on a global scale and actually have people coordinate together on a global scale and just do it themselves. Nexus's vision is to basically become the decent centralized version of Lloyds of London where anyone can coordinate together and share risk. Doesn't matter what it is. Right now we're focusing on crypto risks, but it could be anything in the future. It could be real world stuff, earthquakes, hurricanes, home, auto, all that type of stuff. We're a fair way off that, to be honest, but we're progressing towards it and we've got a strong vision to try and get there.
00:04:31.304 - 00:05:32.118, Speaker A: So the most important update I think that's come today with protocol cover is that you've added more comprehensive coverage. And I don't know why I say you have. I'm a part of the Nexus mutual community too. I've always thought that Nexus is one of the most important projects for us to be able to grow in Defi, because if you can buy cover, you know that you can at least risk, I think, larger amounts of money that you would put into defi otherwise. So like an know, I can speak personally to the fact that I was very careful about how much I might have put into Aave a year and a half ago. I think I'm still a little bit cautious with any DeFi protocol, but I know that I can risk more for my own portfolio because of the fact that I always have cover through Nexus. And I know that there's a track record of Nexus paying out that cover.
00:05:32.118 - 00:05:57.230, Speaker A: But what's changed? We used to talk about is it a bug and what is a bug and what does that mean? Whether smart contracts were used in a way that they were not. Intended to be used. Now you have what Oracle failures covered financial exploits or flash loan attacks. Anyways, can you summarize what's the new cover term definition?
00:05:59.410 - 00:06:47.690, Speaker B: Basically, the original product was designed basically after we'd seen just the Dow hack and the parity multi SIG wallet issues, which were pretty much just like coding error bugs. Protocols didn't work as intended. And obviously DeFi has expanded and done a whole lot more stuff over the past few years and risks have grown and changed and all the rest of it. So protocol cover is an updated version of smart contract cover and it replaces the old product and it's much more comprehensive. So rather than just covering the smart contract bugs, basically that shouldn't have been able to get in there and drain all the money straight away just by a simple exploit. It also covers things like oracle manipulation. So where you push a price oracle off to some extreme and then exploit the protocol in a kind of economic fashion.
00:06:47.690 - 00:07:31.290, Speaker B: It also covers economic attacks where the economic incentive mechanisms fail in an extreme way that leads to your funds that are in the protocol being stolen or taken. And the other one is actually governance attacks. We haven't really seen one of these yet, but say that there's a group of people that managed to maliciously alter the system and then extract some of the funds out of the system as a result of that, then that's something that we also cover. And so the first part of protocol cover is really this expansion from just the smart contract bugs to also cover these other risks.
00:07:31.870 - 00:07:55.410, Speaker A: Actually, maybe a better question is what is not covered? Like what's some examples? I know, for example, if there is a rug pool, you wouldn't be covered. What happened with Sinlev, I think was the name of like that wouldn't be covered. What happened with easyfi recently? Wait a sec, would that be covered?
00:07:55.830 - 00:08:36.610, Speaker B: That wouldn't be covered. No, that is the one thing that's not covered. We've designed the protocol to try and basically cover all the extreme events, but we have to specifically exclude rug pools. And that's basically where someone or some key controls access to the funds, some administrative function. And so regardless of whether that team did it or the key was hacked and somebody else did it, regardless of how that might happen, that type of attack is excluded. Unfortunately, it's just a massive moral hazard. You can exploit Nexus as a system.
00:08:36.760 - 00:09:12.774, Speaker A: Yeah, you could incentivize founders to do a rug pull and then collect having bought cover through Nexus. I think to caveat that though, let's say that someone's funds are just locked. It's not an actual rug pool. There are some terms in there to cover you for that. Right. Okay, so custodial cover had been launched a while ago. If I have my assets in Coinbase or let's say finance, and I can't withdraw them for 90 days, then I'm covered.
00:09:12.774 - 00:09:31.118, Speaker A: Right. I can actually get a payout because that's the point of custodial cover with this new protocol cover that is specifically for DeFi protocols. Are there any terms like that? If your funds are just locked? Let's pretend it's not a rug pool, but for some reason they're not allowing you to withdraw your funds.
00:09:31.294 - 00:09:45.986, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically proof of loss means you actually lost funds, someone took them out or the funds are permanently irrecoverable. Either way, they're lost and you can't access them, so that counts.
00:09:46.178 - 00:10:45.994, Speaker A: Yeah. And then one last point to make on all of this is I'm trying to navigate this with your guidance, but at the end of the day, the way these will be voted upon is. Or the way it gets decided is there's the terms the community has agreed upon, but Nexus is run by a Dow. So it comes down to NXM holders voting on, is this covered or not? What I think the real advancement here is you've made the terms much more comprehensive and I think it's easier to understand what is covered. Whereas before we all have had these discussions of, well, is that a bug? Is it not a bug? Is it covered by the terms that have been laid out as a community? So this is huge. To me, it is the difference between having, if I bought liability insurance for my car, versus comprehensive. This is us going to that more comprehensive level with protocol cover.
00:10:46.192 - 00:10:53.566, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And the whole D five space has evolved and we need to evolve with it, basically. So that's the big story here.
00:10:53.668 - 00:11:03.360, Speaker A: Yeah. So I've got your screen up here. Could you walk us through? We don't have to buy cover live, but if someone's new, if they go to.
00:11:04.050 - 00:12:13.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll pick just because it's interesting, because it's got lots of chains. Basically, you just pick the protocol that you want some cover against and then you can choose how much color and you can choose in ether or die. So this is basically what you would get paid if there was a mahak. So say you're putting some stable coins in sushi swap, then you can buy 1000 die worth of coverage and you can choose to buy it for say, 90 days, any days, and then you can get a quote over here and you can purchase it in Dai or you can purchase it in NXM. So I won't go ahead and do that now. But I think one of the interesting, just going through the terms and conditions, you can see that there's contract a lot economic attacks, we've got oracle failures and governance attacks. And one of the really cool things, which is why I brought up Sushiswap, actually, is all of a sudden we are now covering sushi swap on all of these chains.
00:12:13.270 - 00:12:32.910, Speaker B: So if you are interacting with sushi swap on either Ethereum, binance, smart chain, Xdai, Phantom or Polygon, we cover that. So not only are we covering a wider array of risks, but we're also covering protocols running on different chains.
00:12:34.210 - 00:12:39.360, Speaker A: Hugh, can you zoom in on those terms? By the way, if you just zoom in, they'll be able to see it.
00:12:46.290 - 00:12:49.314, Speaker B: There we go. Is that a bit better? Hopefully that's a bit better.
00:12:49.432 - 00:13:10.102, Speaker A: Very cool. There we. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Lot has been added there as opposed to what was just the contract bugs. So you don't show Solana here, but if someone launched on Solana or like, that's also covered polkadot, basically everything under the sun.
00:13:10.102 - 00:13:20.198, Speaker A: As long as Nexus is offering cover for them in the front end here, then we should have that cover on any chain.
00:13:20.374 - 00:13:28.078, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. We're just trying to provide more clarity about exactly what's covered and all the rest of it. So we list it in the UI, but yeah, it covers any chain. That's correct.
00:13:28.244 - 00:13:29.120, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:13:29.730 - 00:13:30.154, Speaker B: Jeez.
00:13:30.202 - 00:13:53.026, Speaker A: I think we just about covered everything there on the front end. We got the terms. The fact that we're multi chain now, does armor insurance also inherit this then, like for those that do pay as you go cover, which is really, to me, like, that's the ultimate advantage of armor being a distributor of Nexus. Do they inherit all of this same coverage?
00:13:53.138 - 00:14:29.220, Speaker B: Yeah, they mean armor are distributing Nexus cover, so they get the upgraded terms. But I think one of the important aspects here is everyone that already had smart contract cover automatically get upgraded to the new terms, except for some very old policies that didn't require proof of loss. So those have kind of been grandfathered, but there aren't very many of them left either anyway. But basically all policies get upgraded to the new term, so you don't have to do anything. If you bought cover last week and now there's a new one, you don't have to worry about.
00:14:30.070 - 00:15:28.226, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great. And I know you had a layover period where anyone could choose to as a Nexus staker and NXM staker, you could pull out of those pools or pull out of that cover to say, actually I don't want to cover this more extensive version, but I think it's a huge opportunity in terms of staking. I stake using the 15 X leverage. So if I have 100 NXM, I can stake. Technically I'm staking 1500 NXM up to 100 NXM against any single contract. Which means at the end of the day, I think we've talked a lot before about this is a leverage model that helps Nexus to offer more coverage. But it's only because I did it over the weekend with how low gas was, and I was like, I never had really considered how that leverage was benefiting me as a staker.
00:15:28.226 - 00:16:06.174, Speaker A: The fact that I'm able to, I would describe to someone, pretend that you can lend your stablecoins in multiple places at once. Now I don't want to pretend like the rates that you'll earn as an NXM staker aren't comparable to the rates of lending like a stable coin. But nonetheless, if you're willing to go to that 15 x leverage point and put like, let's say 100 NXM against 15 different protocols, well, you're earning yield. Assuming that people buy that cover, you're earning yield. So it's pretty cool.
00:16:06.372 - 00:16:34.860, Speaker B: Yeah, and hopefully our goal in the future is to actually increase that leverage over time as we expand the mutual and cover more risks. So in theory we should be able to get that up to like maybe even 30 times in the future. That may seem on the surface really crazy risky, but it's actually not that bad. When you're talking about insurance in kind of leverage terms, it's not like leverage, like a leverage long on a particular asset. So it's a bit into.
00:16:37.150 - 00:17:19.042, Speaker A: Know. Well, there's, there's two different folks that might be interested in all that we're talking about. One is the person who needs cover. So if you started participating in AAve yield farming today, with the lending and borrowing on either side of the market, you can earn. I think it's staked Ave. So if you're earning that, that's great, but you're also putting your assets at risk and so you can buy cover for Ave. Actually, could you just quickly show that, Hugh, just maybe this is a good way to sort of wrap up is let's say I want to buy cover for, let's say I have ten ether of assets on Ave.
00:17:19.042 - 00:17:20.278, Speaker A: How would I do that?
00:17:20.444 - 00:17:41.966, Speaker B: So just select Ave and then we've got ETH. So you put ten ETH in. So you get some coverage with ten ETH and say you want it for 30 days because you're not quite sure how long it's going to last. And then that's basically it. You get a quote, tells you your quote price over here, accept the terms and conditions and go for it.
00:17:42.148 - 00:18:10.870, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. How much do I want as a payout? Which I would caution anyone, don't put in more than what you actually have because that's not good. The product has changed over time. It's not meant for you to be able to speculate and get a payout on assets that don't actually need protection. You do have to prove that you had ten ether in there that was compromised.
00:18:12.170 - 00:18:14.346, Speaker B: You got to prove your loss at claim time. That's right.
00:18:14.448 - 00:19:07.580, Speaker A: That's it. Yeah. And another thing to consider is if you do use the Nexus front end, you can do this for any other wallet. So I only use one wallet to buy my cover unless I'm using armor, which is awesome pay as you go coverage, but it's underwritten by Nexus, which actually, I guess there was one point here that I left out. So I guess lately it was someone in the community posted a proposal to take the dow to this point of no longer being, what do I want to say? Registered in a way that required mutual members to Kyc. Can you share anything more about that? And maybe what are some updates that we might look forward to in the next year or so?
00:19:07.950 - 00:19:58.486, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. So one Kx, basically a VC in the crypto space, but also like an early supporter of Nexus and a very active member of our community. They've put together a proposal to dissolve the legal entity that Nexus that sits around Nexus. So Nexus is a DaO, but it also has a legal wrapper, I guess. And that's a UK company. And so basically when you sign up to join Nexus, you undergo KYC, you pay a small membership fee and you become a member of that legal company, and that gives you some protections and it also gives a bunch of regulatory clarity and a whole bunch of other kind of benefits, but it also is not really in line with the decentralized ethos.
00:19:58.486 - 00:20:44.298, Speaker B: So it was kind of set up in a certain way to kind of launch the protocol in a safe way and see where we go to from there. And so one KX are proposing that we dissolve the legal entity and therefore after that you can remove the KYC requirement and go from there. So there's quite a few steps to actually do that. First step is get some legal advice, then work out what we want to do and then implement and stuff. It's not necessarily going to be a quick process, but it's a very important discussion that I believe all members need to get involved in over the coming months, because also it's a one way decision. You can't really go back. I think there's definitely pros and cons either way.
00:20:44.298 - 00:21:21.534, Speaker B: I'm definitely going to be on the fence on this one and just kind of let the community drive it and the decisions. So, yeah, that's a good one to get involved in and keep an eye on. I guess another really big thing that's coming up that we have been working on for a little while is actually enabling investment earnings on the asset pool. And so basically nexus has a shared pool of funds. The liquidity, it's pretty much all held in ETH right now. And that ETH's just basically being held. And so at the moment, the mutual is earning its surplus.
00:21:21.534 - 00:22:19.794, Speaker B: So premium, like essentially cover cost less claims, but it hasn't turned on. The second revenue stream, which is what all insurance companies use and is actually really big, is earning investment returns on the float. As an example, US auto, most auto lines, they run at claim ratios of 100%, which means the only thing that the insurance company is making money on is the float is the investment earnings. So not all product lines are on that, but the point being that this is huge. And so we're going to be starting slowly and starting to increase it over time. And there's a really big opportunity here. Like if we were to earn even like net four or 5% on the float, we have, as you're pulling it up now, we have whatever ETH is right now, we have about 400 million in the capital pool.
00:22:19.794 - 00:22:20.198, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:20.284 - 00:22:52.340, Speaker A: Yeah. In terms of ETH. And you consider like this mountain of ETH has been there since ether was at a much lower US dollar price. It's nuts to think about what if this could be earning one, two, 3%, I mean, anything at all. And it's a very large amount of money to bring in for the mutual, which then ultimately the community, the Dow, can decide what to do with that excess over time.
00:22:52.790 - 00:23:04.870, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So default is it just flows into the capital pool and increases the MCR. And so that means the token price goes up. So that would be the default. If nothing else changed.
00:23:06.730 - 00:24:30.430, Speaker A: That'S it for me. The bonding curve allows us to align the interest of mutual members and those who seek to buy cover, basically those that are like just holding NXM or they're staking because they're helping to provide that cover versus those that are actually buying it. So it has worked beautifully in many cases. This is really one of the, I think the challenges that will be solved with turning on the faucet and allowing that ether to earn yield, because as the capital pool grows without us going into the weeds here, because most people aren't going to want to discuss it, but it means that you're now creating excess capital. And that excess capital because of the way the NXM token works. It allows the NXM token then to appreciate, because the whole point of this, again, is like it's supposed to grow if the mutual is providing cover and is succeeding in that mission and growing cover, and it has. But this capital pool, we're like this close to seeing it really take off once the underlying capital is able to earn more and more yield.
00:24:31.010 - 00:24:58.202, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And another benefit is if the underlying capital pool is earning returns, then everyone who's staking NXM basically effectively can kind of add that return to. That's right, staking returns as well. It's a very important aspect of what we're doing. We deliberately hadn't turned it on yet for variety of reasons. Do the first things, most important things first. But now it's getting to that time.
00:24:58.202 - 00:25:05.918, Speaker B: And yeah, it's going to be a big step and we'll do it gradually over the next six to twelve months, but it's going to be starting soon.
00:25:06.084 - 00:26:23.718, Speaker A: It's funny because every time I've interviewed you, I've said what's next? And we have just crossed a big bridge here with protocol cover going live. This is something that we've all been looking forward to for some time, but this last step of allowing ether to earn more ether, or if in the future, I don't know if we'll see like a pool of die grow, but right now it's ether that's huge. That is really going to allow the mutual to continue to grow and to continue to offer more cover. Because the one thing I left out here is, just in case anyone's missed this, the annualized premiums in force is around 20 million. So just think of it as like if you took all the different cover that's been bought and you looked at that from a yearly perspective, this is what we're looking at in terms of a revenue for Nexus. The active cover is insane at 704,281,000 ether. And then whatever you can gloss over these charts and they're fun to look at because it's just crazy to look at.
00:26:23.718 - 00:26:41.980, Speaker A: July 2020, that was an exciting time in DFI, but we only had, what is that? 5.3 million in active cover versus now take whatever multiple that is. That's how much cover has grown since then.
00:26:42.290 - 00:27:20.502, Speaker B: Yeah. Past year has been an amazing journey, and there's a lot more to go. One of the things we can do that's really interesting is we could probably write about double the amount of COVID without any more capital, which is kind of. I think that's really important because I think especially with uniswap V three coming out soon, there's going to be more of a focus on capital efficiency being a thing in DFI rather than just TVL. So that's going to be an interesting aspect as well. And we've always focused on the capital efficiency side of things from the start.
00:27:20.636 - 00:27:39.386, Speaker A: Yeah. I've got just one question. Someone was asking. Will the NXM staking requirement always be 20 or will it eventually be lowered? If anyone's wondering, like, if you go into nexus to stake NXM to offer cover, it's a minimum of 20 NxM to deposit.
00:27:39.578 - 00:28:01.240, Speaker B: Yeah. So our goal is to remove that. It basically causes quite a lot of gas costs to actually process the rewards. And we're looking to revisit how the staking rewards mechanically work. And once we've done that, the idea is to remove those types of limits so it becomes essentially up to the user if they want to do it at lower amounts, if they.
00:28:01.930 - 00:28:21.658, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Good stuff. Well, Hugh, I think we covered everything then, so I'm just going to thank anyone for tuning in. This was, like I said, first of, hopefully, many. What did I call it here? Defi talks with Defi. Dan, I don't even. Clearly, I've thought a lot about this and.
00:28:21.658 - 00:28:51.138, Speaker A: Yeah, no, please join us in the future. I'll continue to host interviews through yield TV and other channels. But hopefully this is another place where you can enjoy learning more about Defi with some of the biggest founders in Defi, like Hugh. So, Hugh, I'll let you say, oh, just remind everyone, too. Make sure you learn more at app nexusmutual IO slash cover. And follow nexus mutual on Twitter.
00:28:51.314 - 00:28:57.798, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yep. Twitter discord, come and say hi. We'll be happy to help you out if you have questions. Cool. And thanks again.
00:28:57.964 - 00:29:05.140, Speaker A: All right. Hey, thanks so much, everyone. I'm going to just hit the end broadcast and we'll be back in a green room. Bye. Everyone have a great day.
