00:00:03.770 - 00:00:44.060, Speaker A: Hi everyone. You're watching Defi talks with Defi dad. Hey, thanks for joining us. It's Wednesday, June 1, 2022. Today I am joined by DfI land Irwin, who is a co founder of DFI land. DFI land is a gamified DFI platform. It's been out, I think, for close to six months now, but been in building for well over a year.
00:00:44.060 - 00:00:59.054, Speaker A: I've actually had the privilege of getting to know the team and being a part of the community and working on DeFi land. So this will be a lot of fun for us to sort of walk through the platform today. But Erwin, how you doing? Thanks for joining me.
00:00:59.252 - 00:01:19.574, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for inviting me here. Thanks for a great intro, and thanks for having this podcast interview. I'm super happy to be here. And indeed, we've been building over one year, having live for over six months. So yeah, pretty excited to show the people what we have been building and just kind of share some thoughts about defile land.
00:01:19.772 - 00:02:11.522, Speaker A: Absolutely. And full disclosure before we get started, my team at Fourth Revolution Capital, we have been advisors to DeFi land. So we do have exposure to the DFL token. This isn't a recommendation or endorsement to invest in that token. We're going to strictly talk about the game and how one can basically play games which are currently built on Salana and are also being built on other chains, including some Ethereum l two s, hopefully in the near future. But then what's really interesting about the platform, what drew me in as DFI dad, is I have experienced firsthand, of course, getting to learn all these different deFi applications, and they're just not easy to learn. There's a lot of nuances which we've inherited from traditional finance.
00:02:11.522 - 00:02:39.520, Speaker A: And so what's really refreshing about DeFi land is that you're able to just play a game which it feels a lot like Farmville, and we'll kind of show you here in a second. So it's a little bit more fun just to show it off versus talk about it. But Erwin, why don't we start with your background before we dive into DeFi land? How did you get started in crypto? Like, what was your background before building DeFi land?
00:02:41.170 - 00:03:32.874, Speaker B: Indeed. So we've been kind of really involved in all different industries, starting from the finance gamification, gaming, esports, like the AI and a lot of different things. And the team that we have, the core team, we have been building together for almost six plus years together. We're coming from the same school, same universities, and then we have been basically working all the way up just since we were kids. Like, we started from the hackathons, like contests, startup contests and stuff like those. And basically before jumping on crypto, so we basically become really active in crypto since 2017. And basically we before that were super active in the machine learning and computer vision as well as in the financial industry.
00:03:32.874 - 00:04:30.690, Speaker B: So most of us were working on a startup that we had with, we were working with AWS, Nvidia, Microsoft, HoloLens, some really great names out there. And basically after 2018, we got kind of super wrecked with the crash of the market and we had really bad coins by the time holding and we were kind of giving up. But since DeFi summer, we got really heavily involved in DeFi. And because of that, Defi's nfts kind of became part of our lives. As we have done huge research how everything works, we decided to kind of have some kind of exposure ourselves personally to these activities. And because of that, we have spent countless of hours explaining DeFi and NFTs to our friends and family members and they just could not understand how everything works. It was super complex for them to even get the idea of how swaps work, why there is no centralized entity behind anything.
00:04:30.690 - 00:05:15.326, Speaker B: So it was kind of challenging for us explaining all the different things. And because of that, we had idea that we really want to somehow change and create something that would help the people understand how DeFi or NFTs or the crypto world works. While it would be just really easy to use, it would be fun to use, and also it would be kind of really rewarding to use as well. So it kind of felt like just an unreal thing. But we came up with the idea of Defile and literally one year ago we just had yesterday the anniversary, one year anniversary. And we were super happy to have these amazing things built in defile land. Like the staking game, we have been building many different things.
00:05:15.326 - 00:05:26.920, Speaker B: So yeah, that's just kind of the story behind Defile land and the rest. This one year has been a huge thing for us as we have learned a lot from our experiences and yeah, it's been an amazing year.
00:05:27.530 - 00:06:04.494, Speaker A: Yeah, and I've got quite a few follow up questions to that, especially about lessons learned, things that hypotheses that you built the platform on and already how we've seen changes in the market over the last twelve months. But let's go ahead and show it off because it's just fun to walk through it. I think you hear it's like a farmville style of DFI game but you got to actually see it to understand how it works. So let me know if it's okay if I can share your screen and then we can start to talk through it.
00:06:04.612 - 00:06:47.966, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I believe it's best to show to the people so they see how it works and see how everything looks. So everyone thinks that default is just another gamified Dax or just the UI that they can just go and have some kind of cute animals around. But actually default is a game that you actually can play and it's kind of getting better and better daily. So yeah, I would love to show those to you can go to play defilen app and it's publicly open, everyone can. Currently we're in the beta version and we're kind of creating and adding new features all the time, but you can already access the game like this. We have the kind of great background that we are changing all the time.
00:06:47.966 - 00:07:04.020, Speaker B: And here is the list of the wallets as our game is on the Solana blockchain. Currently we are supporting the majority of Solana wallets and personally I'm just going to go ahead and use my phantom wallet. You just connect your wallet and you just click on the play and you're good to go.
00:07:05.110 - 00:07:40.320, Speaker A: I would recommend if anyone's never used a Solana application, try Phantom. It's super easy. And then also worth noting here as the game is loading. So the team is building on other chains now, right? I'm not sure what the latest is whether you had narrowed down the choice, but I know there's Ethereum l two s, there's other L1s like Polygon or avalanche. So lots of, I would imagine, EVM compatible choices coming in the future.
00:07:40.930 - 00:08:13.514, Speaker B: Yeah. So we've been building on Solana for one last year, and I believe we have kind of built a strong foundation and we do believe the Solana is one of the best choices still. But we believe that the future is the multichain as well. So we're going to be building on top of other chains as well as time goes. The end goal for us is to have to be live on at least three different chains by the end of 2022. We're going to see how it goes, but we have not confirmed the final decision, which we're going to be going for in this summer. But we have several options.
00:08:13.514 - 00:08:31.440, Speaker B: As you have mentioned, Ethereum L2s as well as we have some layer ones as well, that have shown that they have good potential. And we want to capture as many users as possible to kind of bring the defi and crypto to the masses. So we're going to be building on the different chains as well.
00:08:32.210 - 00:08:56.070, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. So we could just start to walk through. There's all sorts of games, but also very familiar defi farms that we use just normally in different applications. Or like a platform like Zapper. Gosh, if you click around here, I wonder if we could start to show off some of the more popular games.
00:08:56.890 - 00:09:11.470, Speaker B: First, I'm going to then just dive into the more kind of defi part. Not the games, but just the defi, but how we can gamify those and then we'll be just kind of going into the game part. Or should we just straightforward dive into the games?
00:09:12.370 - 00:09:50.198, Speaker A: You know what? Well, let's see here. Whatever's closest, we could hop right into a game. One of the points I mean to make here is that the game isn't like, you do this to be an LP, you do this to stake there. Is that available. And I think that was the point of the platform, is to make DeFi easy and fun and allow someone to be a little more motivated by a gamified platform. But there are just good old fashioned games here to enjoy. I'm wondering, I haven't played the shooting game in a while.
00:09:50.198 - 00:09:53.610, Speaker A: Is that still up, the hunt type game?
00:09:53.680 - 00:10:16.370, Speaker B: Yeah, actually we remastered that, so I'm going to be showing you that as well. So you just explain. We have really interesting approach to play and earn. So first of all, we don't call this play to earn because we believe that games should be fun. And then on top of that, you should be earning money. Not to just play, just to purely earn money, because that's how games lose popularity as soon. As soon as possible.
00:10:16.370 - 00:11:06.514, Speaker B: And also, another thing is that we created, instead of creating one single NFT, for example, the NFT character or NFT land, we created the idea that every single different game in defilent will have its own NFT. So currently we have eight different types of NFTs. So we have different five different types of pets, and also we have three different kind of tools. Like we have a shooting gun, we have a fishing rod, and we have a harvester. And those different games have their own NFTs because of these NFTs have a really low entrance fee. So if you're a user who doesn't really have thousands of dollars to get started into play and earn, and basically the guilds are making the most of the money because that's the reason guilds exist. We decided that we would not be going that way.
00:11:06.514 - 00:11:40.826, Speaker B: And we want to fully be facing the retail facing and we want the people to enjoy play and earn. So basically the entrance fee for default can be like $25, something like that currently. And even if you don't have that money, even with a free NFT play, which everyone has, this is a free NFT. Whenever you register, you're going to get the NFT and you can for free play the game. So I'm going to just go and just play the shooting game as promised. And I have the three different NFTs, which are the epic NFTs. And you have like four different attributes which kind of tell you how much you can score or different power ups that you can get.
00:11:40.826 - 00:12:14.662, Speaker B: So I'm going to just click on the game and just not talk too much and just show you by the actions, I guess. So, yeah, we have pretty great customization mechanism here, so you can kind of customize your sensitivity or your mouse. Like the pointer increase, decrease. It's going to choose the way that you want to shoot. So I'm just going to use this one, I think vinyl one, and just going to start the shooting, I guess. So we have different kind of targets that you should hit. And the more you hit, basically the better score you're getting.
00:12:14.662 - 00:12:33.370, Speaker B: You should also reload so you can control the amount of the poles that you have in the magazine and also kind of hit as many targets as you can. So I'm not the best in here. I'm actually the best Fisher, but not the best shooter. So I'm going to. Just going to play. So we have a timer.
00:12:33.450 - 00:13:21.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it kind of harkens back to all sorts of games that we've all played. So this is just one example of a game where someone could get started for free playing this. It just happens to be built, in this case on Solana, whatever other blockchains is built on in the future, it just happens to be accessible because it's built on that blockchain. I'm curious then, could we walk through maybe like an LP, something that's a little more complex in the world of DFI because you all have done quite a bit to kind of abstract away that complexity and make it a game?
00:13:21.824 - 00:13:44.910, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. The thing I want to finish the game because we have like 45 more seconds so people can see that you can actually earn the money. So it's kind of not just for fun, so you can actually also earn the money with this. And we have launched our new Goldie token for playing there. And also you'll be able to get the DFL as well. So we have 25 more seconds. So I'm not going to being super active.
00:13:44.910 - 00:13:56.280, Speaker B: So I want to show that even if you are not really great shooter that you are getting started, you can still earn good amount of income that you can use for the upgrades or repairs of the NFTs and stuff like that.
00:13:56.730 - 00:14:21.450, Speaker A: And by the way, when you say earn, so they're earning through the DFL token. So this is one of the uses of the token. I mean, in the end, I guess ultimately when you cash out or maybe you could walk through, what's the difference between earning like XP or just points within the game versus when you actually earn DFL?
00:14:21.610 - 00:14:44.614, Speaker B: So yeah, there are three different things that you are earning. The one is XP. So XP is basically for the leaderboards. And the better XP you have, the higher any leaderboard you are and the prices you're never getting. Second one is a Goldie token that we just got the 48. So it's basically like with this just one gameplay, I can play this for multiple times. It's something like just calculates per quick.
00:14:44.614 - 00:15:08.542, Speaker B: It's just like $0.10. So you just actually get the $0.10 out of just the one two minute gameplay. And the thing with just this slow gameplay that I did, and there also is a DFL token rewards, which are kind of super rare. And those DFL. So DFL has way more use case in the game to be spent and earned. So basically it's not that, it's being inflationary actually.
00:15:08.542 - 00:15:41.418, Speaker B: So I'm going to kind of show you what actually people have been spending way more DFL and the goldie that they are earning currently because you can upgrade your NFTs like you can see here. So you can kind of level up your NFTs like just kind of cost me this much. So I'm going to actually go and just level up my NFT. So you actually spend the rewards that you got into the upgrades. You can also repair the NFTs as you use them. They break down, so their health HP is actually decreasing. So you should spend the money to repair them as well.
00:15:41.418 - 00:16:26.898, Speaker B: So there are different mechanics to burn Goldie as well as DFL. So I believe that what default is doing really great is that for example, just everyone wants to compare with the Axio infinity. Axio Infinity didn't really have much burning mechanisms and it was just like just single one. I do believe that in default currently we already have five different mechanisms to burn the DFL and the Goldie. And there are more coming like crafting, upgrading NFTs, kind of forging and so on. And I believe they're going to be really great use case for default as a driver, as a buying power. And already in just like two weeks of the play and earn being out, we already have burned 10 million DFL tokens just by purely upgrading.
00:16:26.898 - 00:16:41.200, Speaker B: And there has been not any campaign around that. People are just generally enjoying to kind of play the game, their DFL and the Goldie to upgrade their NFTs, customize their NFTs and lends. So I believe that's pretty great.
00:16:42.290 - 00:17:19.218, Speaker A: Yes. So there's a few different styles of gameplay. One is you can just get started for free and obviously enjoy some of the games there, like the shooting game, but then there's also games that, or what do I say, parts of the platform that involve using NFTs and others where you're strictly using the basics of Defi. For example, you can create an LP and then stake the LP and earn that. So talk us through. Yeah, what are we looking at here with seeds in the laboratory?
00:17:19.394 - 00:18:04.662, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a great point that you have brought up. So basically, as I said, we've been trying to gamify all different experiences. So here you see the laboratory building that we have. So it's called the seed laboratory. And if you go here, maybe if you're a defi, you're going to be feeling somewhat like maybe it's going to looks familiar. The thing is that it's going to LP creation UI where you choose different assets and then you kind of combine those into the one of, we call that the seed creation. So you choose in default, the different tokens are represented as different fruits and vegetables so that it kind of feels more fun and it's kind of easier for the people to understand.
00:18:04.662 - 00:18:51.538, Speaker B: And the thing is that you can actually combine different fruits and vegetables and they give you the seeds. So let me actually just go and just create something like the grape USDC LP, which in default feels like you're creating the seeds. So I'm going to just go in and create the seeds. You're just going to click on the approve on your wallet and as soon as the Solana blockchain going to confirm the transaction, hopefully it's going to be soon, it's going to be just on chain without any centralization or anything else. We just got the confirmed. You're going to see the car bringing from your house to the seed laboratory both the grape as well as the broccoli, which is USDC. And it's going to be creating the seeds.
00:18:51.538 - 00:19:23.630, Speaker B: And here we have the farms that I have already planted my plants. So if you click on that, you're going to see that it's Ray USDC farm. So it's basically, I have staked my LP tokens in this farm and you can visually see those rewards growing. So here I have Ray is actually promig grenade. So I can see the prom grenade and I can see that I have totally planted $1.69 worth of the LP and I have already gained the reward of $0.1. So it is 0.1
00:19:23.630 - 00:19:46.120, Speaker B: ray. And let me actually just kind of hide this one and I'm going to be planting a new one. So as we have just created the LP, the thing is that the grape USDC that we created doesn't really have the farm, so I cannot plant that. But let me actually just create something like DFL USDC and I'm going to be planting those.
00:19:48.350 - 00:20:47.260, Speaker A: I can speak to having used it, it's very satisfying as you create seeds and you plant them and you harvest them. It's funny too, because the seed in this case is just what you would normally do to create an LP, pairing two tokens together. But then when you plant it in this area here, you get to whatever see plants grow and then to actually harvest it, obviously you can collect the yield then from, let's say, some incentivized LP where you're earning some reward token, or it could just be trading fees. So yeah, it's funny how it just plays tricks on your mind, because again, I'm used to using DeFi on Zapper, but in this case, it just turns it into a little bit more of a fun game.
00:20:48.030 - 00:21:30.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. And the thing is that we are trying to have really small details that make sense. I'm not sure if you can hear the sound of the UI and stuff, but it's kind of satisfying as well as everyone is joking on buying the lambo with their first money in the crypto, we have the Lambo harvester as well in here. So we're having some kind of references all around so people can, who are new to crypto and Defi can have the references, all the memes and all the CT things going, so they kind of feel native in here. So we're trying to kind of make that fun. And as I have shown, so we have just planted LP, basically seeds in the farms and they have already grown. So it's like sticking LP in the farms of the radium currently.
00:21:30.250 - 00:22:03.810, Speaker B: And the thing is that in defilent, you don't really access defilent farms or defilent swaps and stuff. We are running on top of already existing protocols. So you don't really have to choose should I use radium or should I use defile land? Because you can actually, I'm not going to bash on anyone, but we are going to gamify Zapper, where you can basically access all the different projects and different protocols directly from defile. You can swap on orca, just plant on the farms on the radium, and just do all the different stuff just from the Defi land.
00:22:03.960 - 00:22:08.658, Speaker A: Erwin, could you show that? What does a trade look like? Just so everyone else can see?
00:22:08.744 - 00:22:37.306, Speaker B: So, yeah, here we have a market building, and the UI is also just somewhat the same as you might have seen. So I'm going to actually be buying some DFL, so I'm going to choose three. And also here we have the road optimizer. We're running through the Jupiter swap. So you can just see all the different roads that there are and kind of give you how much you will be getting. So I'm going to just go with the best one. And as you see, if I sell three broccoli, I'm going to be getting 448 DFL.
00:22:37.306 - 00:23:13.030, Speaker B: So I'm going to click on the swap and I'm going to approve this transaction. And we also integrated the memes into the games. Like, we have this trade offer guy meme as well in here where you see funny. And we are planning to add as many more memes as possible. So we're trying to make for the retail the best place in default and to kind of have fun, earn, and just kind of get used to crypto. So as soon as the transaction gets confirmed on Solana blockchain recently, it was having some kind of problems with the clock and stuff like that. But as you see, it just got confirmed.
00:23:13.030 - 00:23:27.310, Speaker B: And you're going to see that from your house. The broccoli is taken to the marketplace and the DFL from the marketplace is taken to your house. So we're trying to gamify all those little things which matter. And I believe that's why users really love to interact with defilent.
00:23:29.330 - 00:24:24.434, Speaker A: You would have to have looked at this six months ago, but it's just wild, all the progress that's been made and all the detail that's gone into this. And I do think now that we're in a bear market or whatever, I just said the B word, whatever sort of market we're in, I'm hoping that for those that are new to defi that this becomes a tool to make it seem less scary and just allow folks to start to learn a bit more about how it works. But like through the eyes of a pretty familiar game because it looks and feels like parts of Farmville and other types of games that I think we've all played. Erwin, anything else here you think that we should covered? I think some of the major parts of the game.
00:24:24.632 - 00:24:59.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe we can show basically just the one thing is that we already started building on the mobile. So default and mobile is coming and basically people will be able to just play and do all those stuff from the mobile which I believe is super massive as like you'll be able to access all the defectivities play and learn everything directly from your mobile, both Android and iOS. So that's a huge thing. And also if we have a time I can just show all this different small features that we have that make sense maybe just the people going to love.
00:25:00.370 - 00:25:09.726, Speaker A: Absolutely. Here. So I will stop sharing your screen unless there was anything else you wanted to show here. Yeah, go ahead.
00:25:09.908 - 00:25:30.962, Speaker B: I'm just going to quickly just basically rush as much as I can. So we have here the price feed. So you have here the price which you're covered. In here we have a house building where you can track your portfolio and just see what you have. Just kind of see top performance, bottom performers. Also you have achievements. So you are getting incentivized for doing different defi and in game activities.
00:25:30.962 - 00:26:00.606, Speaker B: For example like here is like planted seed NFT, single seed NFT in your garden and you're getting some achievements for that. We have a leaderboards for different achievements both for play in there and then also free to play users. You can actually reallocating the buildings in a game that you have here. We have a bank building. It's basically staking for DFL. You can just kind of go when we have gamify the bank experience of the staking as well. Like we have a 3d environment for this as well.
00:26:00.606 - 00:26:23.014, Speaker B: Like with the secret safe that you go into and you can see your staked DFLs and stuff here. We have some kind of memes in here as well. We have here the audio tower as well where we have kind of integrated with audios. We have different channels for different kind of genres. Really cool. You can listen to the music directly to the audios in Defile land, by the way.
00:26:23.052 - 00:26:48.510, Speaker A: That's one thing that if anyone's watching this in the future, you're missing all of the sound. So if you hop into Defileand at Defileland app, you'll right away recognize there's a lot of background sounds to the game, all the sort of farm sounds you would expect. But then you can actually play music here through audience.
00:26:48.930 - 00:27:20.280, Speaker B: Yeah, also we have, if you can look here, it's just kind of Sam statue that we have here. So Sam kind of wise guy, kind of gives the kind of quotes every day randomly. Your salary is your company subscription fee to you. Basically we have the kind of random things the Sam is saying always. So we have team challenges as well. You're competing in teams with different other teams. Currently we had the fishing festival and the more you were catching your competitor with the teams and you're earning DFL if you catch some good ones.
00:27:20.280 - 00:27:47.954, Speaker B: But basically we also have this one thing. We have banners. You can showcase your NFTs on the banner, so you can choose the NFT that you wish to showcase. And basically just you're going to be able to customize your land. You have pets, you can feed them, get the money, basically Goldie from them, the ducks, the cows and stuff. And also we have one of the most important things. We have fiat on ramp and off ramp as well.
00:27:47.954 - 00:28:12.780, Speaker B: So you can basically directly deposit from your credit card account to the game and just going to buy Solana or DFL or the different token that you wish and you're just going to see your NFTs. And there are many different, many things that you can explore as you join defile land. But if you have not yet explored, I would really recommend to kind of come in and just try to explore all the things that we have in here yourself.
00:28:13.710 - 00:29:10.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I am hopeful that Defi land is also a way to sort of demystify defi and finance for newcomers. But I think also to allow. Yeah, show us this. To allow those two who are maybe know the folks who have a more cynical view of DeFi, whether they're from traditional finance or just whatever, picking up sound bites from uninformed members of the US Congress, whoever they are. I think this is just a reminder that this is about making finance actually more understandable and easy and I think fun for the average person. It's just we're really early. Building this has been a challenge the last year just because DFI is still early.
00:29:10.378 - 00:29:49.640, Speaker A: I mean, we only saw a mainstream surge of interest since summer 2020. And so we're just sort of getting to a place where there's just that many more builders building new protocols. And I feel like you all have been sort of on the bleeding edge of this hybrid of gamifying DeFI and using blockchain permissionless applications to give people more access to what they want to do with their money. By the way, I haven't played this game. What is the purpose here? We just trying to harvest as many crops as quickly as possible.
00:29:50.270 - 00:29:51.978, Speaker B: You can see my mouse, right?
00:29:52.144 - 00:29:52.954, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:53.152 - 00:30:23.666, Speaker B: Basically here you have orders. So basically the cars are coming to the market building here and you basically have to deliver the recipes to these cars. So you see the queue here. Basically here it shows what you have the stock in the supply market and this is like what they want. So currently it has its time before you have to satisfy those. So you have to harvest those, deliver there. And you also are running out of the fuel as well.
00:30:23.666 - 00:30:42.780, Speaker B: So if you kind of manage the fuel, because if you run out, then you're becoming super slow. So basically the goal is to kind of deliver as many orders as possible. And people have been enjoying this. It's basically a super new game. It's like been out on for ten days. People are loving this and we have more games coming.
00:30:43.230 - 00:30:47.980, Speaker A: This looks really fun. This is nice just to tune out.
00:30:48.510 - 00:31:18.786, Speaker B: Yeah. You can also use music to the audios while you're kind of harvesting and basically default. The thing is that we are trying to kind of have the games that are not super competitive, they are not super stressful. So you can just at the end of the day enjoy to play the game. Just having the good sounds and just play the game while also it's kind of pretty skillful. It's not like you just have to press one button. It's like there are road optimizations you can use to basically maximize the reward that you generate.
00:31:18.786 - 00:31:45.870, Speaker B: So it's both basically fun and chill as well as it's actually kind of really challenging to play as well. In just 3 seconds, we're going to be ending this thing and then we're just going to see that we delivered 19 and just missed, failed five different things and we still got the 48 Goldie, which is like more than $0.10 as well. It's like $0.12. So pretty good income, I guess, just by enjoying.
00:31:46.770 - 00:31:59.220, Speaker A: Really interesting. Yeah, I'm curious too, how many people end up playing games like that versus some of the other more like D five oriented games within the game.
00:31:59.590 - 00:32:31.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Actually currently play and earn is super on hype as always, whenever there is new game. So people mainly are playing, they're interacting with their pets, they're playing fishing, harvesting, shooting games. But also 75% of those are using the swapping and LP and the farming functions as well. So there are more users playing the game, but also 75% of them are using those things. And we actually have just crossed 10,000 daily active user count. So I'm super happy for that.
00:32:31.614 - 00:32:38.160, Speaker B: And I believe as we go for mobile and for the multichain, I believe this number will be going up.
00:32:38.610 - 00:33:07.960, Speaker A: Yeah, we're so early still, obviously these numbers, I'm sure we'll look back at this in the future and sort of laugh about it, but it's a real milestone actually to reach like 10,000 daily active users right now, just given how early we are. Erwin, I've just got one last question for you then. It's very broad. What are some of the lessons you've learned over the last twelve months in building DFI land?
00:33:08.430 - 00:33:48.374, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been a ride. And we have had our highs and lows as well. And there are multiple different things that we have learned by the kind of hard lessons. So I do believe that what we have learned is that not to chase the hype, but actually fully focus on what the community actually cares about and what they really love and want to see. So at the beginning, we were trying to kind of capture the hype, kind of move around, do the trends and kind of try to maximize the attention and everything. But on the other side, the product was not being developed that much. And as soon as we actually realized that the community is the number one priority that we should be having, everything changed really well.
00:33:48.374 - 00:34:40.658, Speaker B: And the game has been developing really actively since that and everything been going fine as well as. The thing is that we have learned from the other projects and market is that if you actively build and if you don't really listen to the haters at the beginning, we were getting discouraged by all the negativity and everything that we were receiving. And also, even though there was a huge positivity as well. But what we did that, we kind of focused on the building and we have seen an amazing products who have been building in the beer market have been always successful if you just keep delivering and keep building and listen to the community. And finally, what we have learned is that the play and earn, play to earn is not the way to go. And we believe that play and earn is the way. So the games that people mainly use to just earn the money will always fail and they will never be successful.
00:34:40.658 - 00:35:43.530, Speaker B: And if you want to kind of build the successful game that people will be actually playing in the long term, you should first create the game that people would play the game even without earning the money and then on top of that earning money because if there are just everyone wants to just get some money out of it, that's not sustainable. And we have been seeing in default and that even before there was play and there, and even before we had some different multiple games, people were just generally enjoying to do swaps or how manage their portfolios and just do some different activities in default and just to interact with different people as well as just to kind of have these gamified things. And we have in communities like different people, like women the age of 50, men, like a married couple with their grandfathers and grandmothers, you can truly enjoy these games as well as we have all different people from around the world. I believe that's like number one priority for us to not to listen to the haters, but actually deliver the real amazing product for those, all the people who believe in us. And we're going to be showing that we deserve the attention.
00:35:44.190 - 00:37:12.102, Speaker A: Yeah. I also think it's fair to say that previously I think a lot of investors were putting pressure on builders to sort of shoehorn in play to earn mechanics. I think recently I've seen a return to some more rational thinking and I'll say, like myself as an investor, my team at four RC, we always think how can we help? But also at the same time let you do, let you build what you're building, because that's why you invest in a builder, you're there to support them. But not what I want to say, like to drive the ship or to steer you in any wrong direction. Anyways, yeah, I definitely can attest you all have really been focused for much longer on building what is the community actually wanting in a fun game that happens to benefit also from being able to have exposure to different DeFi protocols, to make use of NFTs, to use all the benefits that we have with tokens, and using an application that has crypto assets incorporated. So Erwin, thanks so much for joining me. This is, like I said, total pleasure to get to finally walk through the game.
00:37:12.102 - 00:37:53.678, Speaker A: It's funny, we've been wanting to do this for many months and I'm really kind of grateful that we waited because there was so much in testing and there's been so many improvements, so much detail has gone into the game. And obviously, again, I would argue it, we're still really early. So thanks for walking us through all of that. For anyone who is interested to try Defi land, you can go to Defilen app. If you need a Solana wallet, I'd recommend downloading something like Phantom. It's a wallet that I personally enjoy using. And then just a reminder that the team is exploring.
00:37:53.678 - 00:38:17.820, Speaker A: And I think soon we'll be beginning to build on some other chains as well. So we'll look forward to wherever else there are options to access Defi land. And then also make sure you follow Defi land on Twitter and you can find the discord link on their Twitter account there if you want to learn more about the game. But Erwin, anything else you want to share before we go?
00:38:18.350 - 00:38:47.606, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe that's kind of the major part. And if you want to join Defile and play the game or just kind of have fun, make sure you join the defile and discord community as well. We have really amazing people in here with really talented people who are really always welcoming. So we would love to welcome you as well. And, yeah, that's it. I believe that was kind of great episode as we have covered the major part of default land. And yeah, thanks for inviting me here.
00:38:47.788 - 00:39:19.646, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah, thanks so much, man. And everyone, if you come back in about 30 to 40 minutes, I'm actually going to be interviewing the Xerion team about a new product they launched called Xerion DNA, which also, I would argue, is meant to help gamify DFI, make it a little bit more friendly. So just getting two for one today here with Gamified Defi. So thanks so much, Erwin. I'll end the broadcast here. And everyone have a great day.
00:39:19.646 - 00:39:20.490, Speaker A: Bye. Likewise.
