00:00:05.970 - 00:00:06.614, Speaker A: Hey, everyone.
00:00:06.732 - 00:00:07.062, Speaker B: Hey.
00:00:07.116 - 00:00:42.722, Speaker A: Welcome to Defi talks with Defi, dad. This will be a weekly series I'll be doing with, really the leading thinkers in the Defi and NFT space. I am honored here today to be able to talk here with Brian Flynn. So Brian is an Og of ethereum. He is the co founder of Rabbit Hole, which we're going to talk all about today because v two is about to launch. But Brian can tell you about his background. But in a nutshell, Brian was on the cutting edge of NFTs before.
00:00:42.722 - 00:01:14.762, Speaker A: Really. I think they were trendy. And he originally had created this newsletter called Nifty News. I learned a lot about NFTs early on from Brian. I think it was you, Brian, and then probably the token smart community that taught me everything. And, yeah, just, we're excited to sort of learn from what they've been doing to help folks get educated on crypto and Defi and help them to earn rewards for learning about crypto. So on that note, Brian, welcome to the show.
00:01:14.762 - 00:01:16.154, Speaker A: And how you doing?
00:01:16.352 - 00:01:25.386, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm great. Thanks for having me. Excited to be here and dive and talk more about rabbit hole and future of education and university of the metaverse.
00:01:25.578 - 00:02:20.626, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're going to obviously talk a little bit in the weeds about rabbit hole, but I really want, for those who are new to rabbit hole, you have to think about this in the grand scheme of where the world is headed. Digitizing everything. I made the comment before we hopped on that there is a divide right now in society of being able to work remotely versus not being able to work remotely. And we saw that divide, especially during the pandemic. But I think in the future, there's a whole nother sort of generation that we will work in the metaverse and you will have folks who have never worked in the metaverse. And I really feel like that's what DFI, NFT, I mean, what we're building for web three, that's what we're sort of enabling, is a more familiar and realistic virtual world.
00:02:20.626 - 00:02:26.434, Speaker A: So, Brian, why don't we start with just the obvious? Can we talk about your background a little bit?
00:02:26.552 - 00:02:27.362, Speaker B: How did you.
00:02:27.496 - 00:02:28.526, Speaker A: Crypto.
00:02:28.718 - 00:02:39.320, Speaker B: Yeah, so my background is actually in gaming. I was a professional gamer doing various first person shooter games for a bunch of years in high school.
00:02:39.770 - 00:02:44.360, Speaker A: I did not know that. That's cool. Whoa. Never talked about that.
00:02:46.350 - 00:03:09.374, Speaker B: Oh, man. I was team Fortress two. It was counterstrike. Those are kind of my big two. And then there was sort of this fall off with the first person shooter scene, sort of like 2011 to 2014. And then games like Overwatch kind of made a big comeback. And that's when I decided to, instead of going on to the next game, to actually get into startups instead of continue to game.
00:03:09.374 - 00:04:15.190, Speaker B: I was starting to get pretty bad at corporal tunnel syndrome, so it was hard to keep gaming at the time. This is like 18 hours a day. What happened was like, every sort of college student have their own college delivery startup. But what's interesting was I tried building it in smart contracts in 2016, sort of, kind of realizing the potential of like a peer to peer delivery platform after doing a thesis on Uber Eats and Grubhub's business models, realizing the margins were pretty bad, and realized that was obviously like 1015 years too early. But eventually a crypto network will exist where you actually don't need someone like a company like Uber. Everyone in crypto space kind of talks about this as a prime example. And one of the big problems though is sort of like, how do you incentivize and acquire these types of workers in sort of these very niche crypto networks? And that was something I've been kind of thinking about for various years now with sort of like gamified incentives to actually have people do things that benefit a network.
00:04:15.190 - 00:04:41.710, Speaker B: So that was kind of like my foray into crypto afterwards. Cryptokitties launched in December 2017, and that was kind of like the holy shit moment, at least for me in crypto, saying that NFTs were sort of this first use case that actually made sense. I remember looking at the user numbers for crypticitties. They had like 500 dau. 500 daus at the time was like crazy. Everyone was going nuts. This is like, wow, look at these numbers.
00:04:41.710 - 00:04:51.730, Speaker B: It looked like. It looked like a huge bubble. It was the only application at the time that had above like 50 dAU besides ether delta or some ICO decentralized exchange.
00:04:52.550 - 00:05:22.326, Speaker A: Actually, just in case if anyone is unfamiliar with this, just DaUs as daily active users. And then when we're talking back in 2017, like you mentioned, ether Delta, this was a Dex that preceded uniswap. And if you were trading on a Dex, like, you were a weirdo at that point, no one, including myself, you're a hardcore djen. Yes. Yeah. You were a dgen of. Anyway, so you're there at dapper Labs.
00:05:22.326 - 00:05:30.182, Speaker A: You guys are hitting record numbers. This is what really originally broke Ethereum, right? Like the amount of congestion on the network.
00:05:30.326 - 00:05:50.020, Speaker B: Yeah. I wasn't on the team at that time, so I started to do this NFT newsletter sort of writing about the NFT journey, and then Roham, who's CEO of Dapper, reached out, was like, hey, you should come work with us because you're writing about NFDs. We're doing some cool stuff in NFTs, and it's like, okay, sure, let's do it.
00:05:50.330 - 00:05:51.800, Speaker A: How long were you there?
00:05:52.730 - 00:05:54.040, Speaker B: About a year and a half.
00:05:55.690 - 00:06:00.054, Speaker A: That's like ten years in crypto years.
00:06:00.252 - 00:06:05.420, Speaker B: It was sort of. Right, the entire bear market. I was there, essentially. Wow.
00:06:06.270 - 00:06:30.900, Speaker A: We talked about this before. This was right before top shot. Yeah, right before top shot, which now I'll say at least I think it's been a huge success. But anyways, how did you end up pivoting to rabbit hole? What was the genesis of the idea? And I'd love to kind of backtrack to some of the milestones you guys have hit over the last few years.
00:06:31.350 - 00:07:49.340, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of the big realizations I had at Dapper was they were sort of building mainstream experiences to get people into crypto. The problem was that a lot of people using those crypto applications didn't actually know they were using crypto. They sort of abstracted a lot of those user experiences, which is great. And it works for certain types of things, like topshot, but for users who actually want to learn the space and actually get involved and understand they have agency and ownership of these applications to make decisions, it was kind of a problem. And so I tried tinking around with this adapter, but eventually just saw an opportunity to sort of break off and do my own thing with rabbit hole that was actually focused on the same gamification elements that I kind of learned at dapper and kind of played with various video games in the past and incorporate them into crypto and really just focus on how do we use the power of gamification to actually bring more people into crypto. It's sort of not even hitting on these intrinsic motivators of kind of these financial incentives, but more, I want to actually do this thing because it benefits me as a user, as someone who wants to learn more about the space.
00:07:49.340 - 00:08:03.520, Speaker B: So that was sort of the idea in the beginning. I didn't know where we were going to take it yet, but I knew it was really about, how can we just keep people pretty engaged into the.
00:08:06.530 - 00:08:35.210, Speaker A: Oop, there we go. Sorry, I was muted. And I'm, like, playing with, maybe I should zoom, Brian, just to let people see the man, actually talk about what he's. We're. We're at the point of where Rabbit hole is finally launched. I guess. What are some of the lessons you've taken away from? Just like the last year in building the last year, but the last twelve months has been exciting.
00:08:35.210 - 00:08:58.250, Speaker A: It's been a year of seeing the mainstream come back to realize that, hey, there's applications now that actually work in crypto, especially in terms of DFI and NFTs. Yeah. We could start to talk through Rabbit hole and learn a bit about what are some of those lessons you've learned.
00:08:58.330 - 00:09:05.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I would actually love to share my screen here. I have kind of three different variations of rabbit hole. I could kind of show you the whole.
00:09:07.670 - 00:09:10.990, Speaker A: All right, there you go, Brian. We can see your screen.
00:09:11.160 - 00:09:45.354, Speaker B: Good. This was actually the first version of Rabbit Hole that we built kind of at end of my time at dapper, but it was called drip score. And what was interesting, so this was created February of 2020. And what was interesting is that we actually awarded points for people to do simple actions. Right. And remember, in February of 2020, there was only about 15 to 20 total applications on Ethereum. Right? This was before D five summer.
00:09:45.354 - 00:10:19.734, Speaker B: This was before kind of everything started taking off. So it was really about how can we have all this content and incentivize people to interact with specific smart contract interactions. Right. So the way this would work is that we would actually track to see if someone did these actions. We would link out to these projects and then they would come back and see that their points have increased. So this was sort of like the original iteration. Right? So we took that one step further in rabbit hole and projects started coming to us and they said, hey, you're actually driving a ton of usage to our platforms.
00:10:19.734 - 00:10:51.586, Speaker B: We'd love to work with you and distribute tokens to users that you're bringing into our platform. And then we're like, okay, well, this is interesting. We have sort of this score and XP gamification element. We have this user acquisition channel. How can we kind of combine the two together? And so we launched the next version of Rabbit hole back probably in August of 2020. The problem that we ran into was civil resistance. And this is like a really big problem that spans the entire space.
00:10:51.586 - 00:11:22.146, Speaker B: But civil resistance basically means that users can create multiple addresses. They don't have to prove that they're unique and can kind of just farm as many tokens as possible. Right. It's a problem with retroactive airdrops today. It's a problem with anytime where you actually want to reward specific user with a specific amount of tokens. So we started integrating bright ID at that moment, which was kind of the leading suburbs of syn solution. So we launched that version with bright ID to actually able to do these token distributions in November of 2020.
00:11:22.146 - 00:12:03.002, Speaker B: And so that is basically the version that you see on the platform today. So this was, for example, the last quest that we did with pool together. And the way this works is that you are to do a specific task. This was actually depositing USDT in a pool together pool on polygon. And once you do that task, you have to come back to rabbit hole, sign a message confirming your proof that you did the task, and then you'd be airdropped pool tokens and some XP for completing the task. And you could also see all everyone else who completed the task as well, kind of along with you. So that's sort of we did today.
00:12:03.002 - 00:12:17.390, Speaker B: We've worked with all these different projects so far. We did a quest with Opensea uniswap, actually, that's one's coming soon. Gnosis index, we did Mstable matcha. So all of these we kind of worked with that. We're kind of working in a deeper.
00:12:19.090 - 00:13:10.450, Speaker A: Now. What I love about this, Brian, is if someone knows how to use metamask, I mean, they don't have to sit around and watch a bunch of videos. Which as much as I enjoy being able to interview you and other folks in the community, and I like making tutorials, I think it's really important that you get your hands dirty, because once you try compound, pull together, Ave, whatever, that's it. You start to sort of get some familiarity with it. In a way, it's kind of like watching videos about playing video games, and that's fun, but at some point you really ought to just play the game yourself and try it. So I love the fact you really are pushing people out of their comfort zone and just getting their hands dirty.
00:13:10.950 - 00:14:07.774, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And so going back to your original question, what was your biggest learnings? And so from this version, one thing that we realized was that the users who are actually completing these quests aren't sometimes the best users for these protocols. Right. And really what they're trying to find is that the best users for their platform, not just any type of user, right. Someone who's going to be, has a high LTV lifetime value or would be retained for a user for a long period of time. So we were kind of like thinking about how can we actually start to figure out, how can we get the right type of user involved into a platform? How could we actually start? It started to look more like a talent marketplace where you're trying to build sort of this on chain resume of a user and then connect them to protocols who are looking for that type of user.
00:14:07.774 - 00:14:41.726, Speaker B: Right. And so we thought of this feature called skills. Right. And that's sort of this new feature that we're launching the platform this week. And the way skills work is that you do a bunch of tasks similar to quests and you get a credential. And the credential is then used to do a quest like a prerequisite. So here is an example of a request that we're on from this week where you do a uniswap quest and it requires an identity credential and you get two unit NFT and you do these tasks, right.
00:14:41.726 - 00:15:14.680, Speaker B: But what's interesting is that uniswap, if they wanted to, can require multiple credentials and start filtering the user down even more. So they can require things like a protocol politician credential. Have you actually voted on snapshot? Have you passed the proposal? Right. Those are things where they can actually start filtering users down and get a much more specific type of user that they want. Right. This actually becomes much more useful. Things like token distributions where you can start requiring multiple credentials in order to do a quest.
00:15:14.680 - 00:16:11.370, Speaker B: And that way you can have much more transparent token distribution and know the type of user that you're looking for in the first place with much more targeting going on as well. So this was kind of the biggest lesson that we learned was that it's not just about getting any type of user, but really we're trying to find the type of user that benefits the protocols as well. You kind of want to balance this out though, right? Because you want these brand new users to the crypto space, obviously don't have these credentials yet and need to kind of work their way towards there. So you need to have kind of content on both sides of the spectrum, both for power users and also for sort of top of the funnel new crypto users to the ecosystem. And that's really where sort of this education angle comes into play that we can talk more about. I think you're muted.
00:16:12.270 - 00:16:30.270, Speaker A: Oh, my bad. There you go. I was muted. If we go back to your screen there just a moment, Brian, I just wanted to zoom in a little bit. You can start to dig in. Just zoom in on the requires and rewards there. Basically you're giving people snapshots.
00:16:30.270 - 00:17:44.600, Speaker A: Know, you can start to actually categorize some of these quests or tasks based on this criteria. I guess my point is here is that it feels like phase one was, I mean, you validated that people do, in fact, want to learn more about crypto by getting their hands dirty. Now you can almost start to play with some of these attributes to help people organize and discover new skills that they can acquire and really build up, like an on chain resume. I'm curious though, gosh, where was I going with that? I had a question here for you about is it required? So if I'm building a defi protocol, I have to come to you to have you all sort of customize this. Right now I'm wondering, how far away are we from a future where I, as a DeFi builder, have different Lego pieces and I can come in without asking permission, or at least being able to do it without having to have a bottleneck of going through the team.
00:17:46.730 - 00:18:29.190, Speaker B: It's a great question. Yeah, it's definitely something we're thinking about of how does this actually roll up into its own smart contract with different parameters? I think we're still a long ways away to actually get there, but that's where we ultimately want to end up, where you could basically start to just filter your users down to different credentials and have it basically as a smart contract and then pay out to users after verifying that they've done the tasks themselves. It's a bit tricky right now because the actual checking of the on chain interactions aren't on chain. It's actually done via the graph and the API. So it's a bit tougher to do smart contract right now until we have some much more robust, decentralized indexing infrastructure.
00:18:30.090 - 00:19:10.850, Speaker A: And then, Brian, there's also a collaborative aspect to this. Like if a team works with you and they end up creating quests or mean, obviously they're benefiting from all the lessons you've learned from working with other teams. It's not like they're left to their own devices with this. So I would imagine this is something that if you want to get your users interested in, if you want to get more new users interested in using your application, don't be overwhelmed or hesitate. Because of the workload here. It feels like you guys kind of do some of the heavy lifting there to help think about how to design that.
00:19:10.920 - 00:19:56.898, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have a few people on our BD team, or kind of act like consultants almost, right? So we'll actually create the proposals on each of these protocols and figure out what are the types of tasks that they want incentivize, what is the right reward incentive, what are the credentials that they want to actually have. And so we take all that heavy lifting off the projects themselves, they shouldn't be the ones pouring a powder. They want to actually be decentralized anyway, so they would rather outsource it completely to someone else to kind of figure that sort of stuff out. Right. So that's kind of in our relationship with projects. And as long as we're showing results, and even in our last pull together quest, we drove 95% new users and 300% increase in unique deposits on the platform.
00:19:56.984 - 00:19:57.620, Speaker A: Wow.
00:20:01.110 - 00:20:27.520, Speaker B: Yeah, it's awesome. And because it's actually on chain, we could actually prove that this is new users that we're driving as well, right? It's not just us saying that's new users. We're basically looking on chain and seeing that it's new users, right? And we can also guarantee that they're unique users because it's civil, resistant, with bright ID. So it's sort of these metrics that can't be gained. That sort of has been a problem with a lot of projects in the past with these sorts of things.
00:20:28.130 - 00:20:48.980, Speaker A: Can we pivot to talking more about what does the future look like where you have like a rabbit hole university in the metaverse? What does that look like? And then I'm also curious to understand what pieces are sort of missing in the building stack today, what needs to still happen, you think?
00:20:51.030 - 00:22:05.850, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. Right now, in crypto, sort of the only thing these crypto networks really need, it's Defi, right? We're really talking about DeFi right now is capital, right? And Defi is not the kind of like end all be all. There will be other types of crypto networks that eventually exist as blockchains start to scale, right? That is sort of like our massive debt as a rapid all team. One really good example of that is like the graph, right? So the graph, for example, requires multiple role types. And so you could imagine a future when blockchain starts to scale, that you will need multiple role types that are much more niche and much more, require much more skilled work in itself. And how are you going to find those people to do that skilled work? Right now, the way people do that right now in the context of the graph is through Twitter. That's the only way they find people to become an indexer or a curator or whatever, right? And so eventually, if we have hundreds, if not thousands of these crypto networks that require really nice roles, we need something like rabbit hole to basically allocate this talent into these different roles to perform certain functions.
00:22:05.850 - 00:22:59.886, Speaker B: And so we think that with layer two is coming out and sort of in the next year or two that this will become much more common. Right. We've sort of been focused on this demand side of scripture networks, basically the end users who are swapping, staking, voting. But really, what's more important is sort of the supply side, which is people like urine strategists, for example, who actually need to do sort of the heavy lifting on the protocol in the first place. So you could imagine a quest in the future in rabbit hole, which is create a urine strategy and get $2 million locked in your strategy, or create an enzyme fund and have a return of 600% with some minimum amount locked up as well. Right. So you can actually start to have this much more skillful type of work measured to an actual KPI in itself.
00:22:59.886 - 00:23:49.550, Speaker B: And that's when things get really interesting, because now it's actual skillful work that you're proving to in some aspect. Right? And so when we talk about this concept of a university of the metaverse, what we're really saying is that crypto is the metaverse, and that eventually in the metaverse, there will be thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of digital jobs. Kind of like what we're talking about right now with the different role types. And so there is going to be a need to basically start to educate and allocate people into these different roles. It's sort of a step function. So you get into sort of the level one of the university, and it's kind of what you see in rabbit hole today, right? It's the swapping, it's the staking, it's the voting. Very simple actions that require very little capital.
00:23:49.550 - 00:24:36.730, Speaker B: And as you do those actions, that's basically building out your on chain resume and saying you have these different credentials because you've done these level one tasks. Now it's saying, okay, you've done these level one tasks, now you need that level one credential to then go do these level two ones, which are a little bit more complicated, like providing liquidity, for example. Right? And now protocols can start to filter down into who has these credentials to find who are the best fit to perform these certain roles. And so at that point, rabbit hole becomes a lot like a talent allocator. And that's kind of what universities are today, if you think about it, right? They're basically just starting to credentialize people and then put them into the workforce. So it's a very similar kind of way we're going with this.
00:24:36.880 - 00:25:20.102, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we're talking about creating a new economy. And that's what's really exciting about it. And I think, like, as, by the way, I should have mentioned this earlier, if anyone's hearing it, we've moved into a new house and there's, like, flooring and all sorts of stuff. So thanks for putting up with that. When you think about the metaverse, think about it in the context of what happened when the Internet exploded in the mean, really, like the 2000s. Suddenly you have all this new business, and it's just creating all these new jobs. And there's a lot of people today, many of us, who are able to work remotely because of what took place over decades.
00:25:20.102 - 00:25:56.630, Speaker A: And I think this is a similar sort of, like, this is a new sort of industrial revolution. I mean, that is actually, not to get too corny, but that's why fourth Revolution capital, the team I just joined, it refers to this being the fourth industrial revolution with decentralized computing networks like Ethereum and other blockchains. Brian, anything else you think folks should know, though, about rabbit hole or really maybe interesting narratives and projects that they should be following in this space aside from rabbit hole?
00:25:56.970 - 00:27:19.918, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question to touch on the Dow narrative for a second, because it's a pretty hot topic right now. So one thing that's happening with dows is that it's sort of permissionless work, right? And we say by permissionless work is that you're able to just join a dow or basically raise your hand and say, I want to start helping you, and then proving your contribution by doing work until you get a salary. Right. This is kind of happening across a number of Daos, index co op, llama seed club, a couple of others. And so how it really relates to rabbit hole is that we can basically start to start credentializing users first and then allocate into these dows after, as opposed to people dropping into discords, kind of out the get go, right? Because the big problem happening now is that as people realize that these dows are actually growing, like index co op, for example, is getting 100 people in their discord every single week, just asking to help out. And they can't handle that demand, right? They can't scale that much. So they're going to start to need a way to start filtering users in the same way that kind of like a resume started filtering users based off kind of different things.
00:27:19.918 - 00:27:32.206, Speaker B: And so we're just reaching that tipping point. So it's interesting, kind of seeing where the Dow space is going and sort of like the work that we're doing and how they kind of fit together on some mean.
00:27:32.248 - 00:28:44.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I get asked probably daily, by the way, if you're ever needing help, just dm me on Twitter. I really do try to respond to everyone because I remember being new to the space and I was reaching out to people and those few people that replied to me, really, I probably wouldn't be in the career I am if they hadn't replied to me. Anyways, people ask, how do I get a job in Defi, in NFTs and crypto? And I'm like, hey, pick out a bunch of teams that you admire, a bunch of teams where you already use the application and just get in their discord and ask questions. One of the best things you can do is if you are knowledgeable enough, or at least if you're trying to learn more, if you start answering other people's questions, you will absolutely get noticed in there. And then really just being bold enough to say like, hey, I want to be involved. You'll start to pick out the key voices in the community. Frankly, if people are unresponsive to you, I would say it's probably not a great place then to try to go work.
00:28:44.042 - 00:28:55.642, Speaker A: But gosh, there's so many great places like Index co op is a great. Just they have such a vibrant community. And I think his name, I don't know what his real name is, but he goes by Big sky.
00:28:55.786 - 00:28:57.454, Speaker B: Yeah, Simon. Yeah.
00:28:57.492 - 00:29:24.920, Speaker A: Oh, Simon. That's it. Oh, man. You hop in there and you say you want to get involved? That guy will hop on a call with you in 15 minutes. So, yeah, that's the future. I think it's a future that's rewarding those who are courageous enough just to raise their hand and say, I want to get involved. So, Brian, we probably should wrap up here soon as the nails continue to be pounded around me.
00:29:24.920 - 00:29:41.870, Speaker A: But, yeah. Anything else you think that folks should be following in the space? I think the Dow narrative, like you mentioned, is really interesting. Like any other projects that you've been super excited about lately that maybe are building tools or applications that are tangential.
00:29:43.410 - 00:30:41.682, Speaker B: I think what's also really interesting is sort of this combination of primitives revolving. The multisig and money streaming superfluid is a great example of this. And what's been happening is sort of the NFT space in terms of royalties and grants payments is that they sort of been these one time payments in a lot of aspects. Right. And this new money streaming primitive super fluid, they actually announced a new round today of $9 million, but they're actually able to split that one time payment into kind of a constant stream and make it dynamic as well. So they can either speed it up or slow it down over a period of time based off some on chain metrics being hit as well. And that opens up a ton of new possibilities with things like creator dows, which is sort of another hot narrative going around.
00:30:41.682 - 00:31:14.938, Speaker B: Right. We're actually coming together as a group of creatives, minting NFTs together, selling them. Right. And imagine getting a stream of revenue kind of paid to you over a long period of time instead of getting to you just in one batch. So I think this sort of combination, again, of multi things come together on layer two, superfood money streaming. And these creator dows is going to be a really hot thing, especially for creatives over the next six months. And I'm really excited to kind of watch it grow.
00:31:15.104 - 00:32:13.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the past where you're a talented creative person and you go work for however large of a company, I think the future is being able to coordinate more of these individuals and being able to really just continue to work for yourself. But not I want to say I have started my own business multiple times. I failed at many of them. And I will say the sweet spot for me is I like working alone. I also like working with teams of less than ten and I really feel like web three, namely like Ethereum. When you think about Gitcoin grants, Gitcoin Grants has probably been one of the most impactful things in my life over the last few years. It was really what sort of gave me the confidence that the community is behind me and that I can go out and do this.
00:32:13.934 - 00:32:54.086, Speaker A: I can work more independently across lots of different teams. And Ethereum in general is such a broad community, so that support can be life changing. The goal, though, is to get that support to more people. Mine is one story, but we need to find ways to allow more of these creators, no matter what field they're in, to be able to do what they love. Brian, thanks so much for your time. And this is awesome to learn about rabbit hole and mean generally. You definitely are one of the few, I think, who's thinking of original thoughts.
00:32:54.086 - 00:33:10.290, Speaker A: I'm trying to get past the same conversations over and over again about DFI, and I always get lost in metaverse conversations. So when will rabbit hole v two launch? Is it expected sometime today or this week?
00:33:10.360 - 00:33:11.842, Speaker B: Yeah, this week.
00:33:11.896 - 00:33:38.742, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So everyone, you should follow Rabbit hole on Twitter and then the actual website is Rabbit hole gG. So go there, check it out again. What's up there is about to change quite a bit. The new UI is really pretty, Brian. Got to walk me through that. And Brian, anything else folks should know about you to get in touch? Are you guys hiring anyone at Rabbit Hole right now?
00:33:38.876 - 00:33:57.600, Speaker B: Yeah, we are hiring so you can check out our jobs website. It's on our Twitter page. We're also doing this Pathfinder program. So if you're a content creator, NFT artist, subgraph developer, or even like creating proposals, you can apply for the Pathfinder program. It's sort of the V one of our dow, but it's a good way to get involved if there's no job openings that kind of fit you.
00:33:58.050 - 00:34:22.790, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I'm just going to close out here with. Don't forget to subscribe@defydad.com.
