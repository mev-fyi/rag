00:00:00.250 - 00:00:25.170, Speaker A: Today's show features Infinity pools, a new decentralized exchange designed to offer unlimited leverage on any asset with no liquidations, no counterparty risk, and no oracles. In this episode, we'll interview the cofounder of Infinity Pools about this promising zerotoone innovation for decentralized perps with unlimited assets to be listed faster permissionless listings, and ten X more leverage than you'll find anywhere else on chain.
00:00:25.290 - 00:00:59.980, Speaker B: The problem that we very, very quickly realized is that perp Dexes is a product that, okay, didn't have KYC didn't have custody of your assets, but it had a way worse performance and no tangible ten X benefits. Derivatives are going to absolutely explode. We need to be positioned such that we can benefit from that grow of. We need to change something about the status quo of defi derivatives, right? We need to actually find a way to make defi derivatives ten x better than doing.
