00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:10.930 - 00:00:46.746, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. This is DFI talks with DFI. Dad, thanks for joining us today. It's Wednesday, September 14, 2022. I'm joined here by Marcos Varemis, who is a partner at Accolade Partners, which is a premier fund of funds that invests specifically in crypto native funds. And so I'm excited to talk more with Marcos here, just about their billion dollar blockchain fund of funds, how they've invested across both liquid and venture strategies. And so, Marcos, on that note, thanks for joining me.
00:00:46.746 - 00:00:47.562, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:00:47.696 - 00:00:51.120, Speaker A: Defi dap? Thank you. I'm doing great. Good to see you again.
00:00:51.650 - 00:01:21.670, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. So your story has a very personal beginning to it, as I found with most who really have stuck with crypto for the long term. So, yeah, I'd love to just kick off with maybe a bit about your background at Cambridge associates and Evanston capital and eventually how you found your way to accolade. But maybe start with what was your beginnings with crypto? How did you first run into bitcoin?
00:01:22.330 - 00:01:49.920, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm greek. I was born and raised in Athens until I was 18 years old. Then I moved out. I came to the states. But in around 2010, Greece went into, for those who are not familiar with the situation, went into a very prolonged depression. It wasn't just a recession, it was a depression. GDP fell 25% to 30%.
00:01:49.920 - 00:02:20.102, Speaker A: It stayed there for a period of seven to eight years. It was brutal. And although I lived abroad and I had most of my assets abroad and all that, my family was there, and we also had assets there as a family. Right. Either my mom, my brother. I had some of, you know, those assets were greek government bonds. Some of them were greek government bonds.
00:02:20.102 - 00:03:06.390, Speaker A: Right. I saw things happen around that period that you could not have envisioned in a country in the European Union suffering through it. You saw government debt being haircutted by three quarters. You saw capital controls, you saw illegal audits happening on people. Retroactive 2025 years. You saw a huge budget crisis, and you saw the rule of law being completely bended due to the situation. And around that time, I bumped into bitcoin through a friend who suggested that I read this book by Andres Antonopoulos, mastering bitcoin, which was not an easy read.
00:03:06.390 - 00:03:53.830, Speaker A: It was not an easy read, I can tell you that. But on the other hand, I took the time to read it, and I got really fascinated by it. I realized that there's this asset that lives outside of the financial system and a distributed network of computers, and that can be a hedge on the shortcomings of the financial system. So to put it kind of more as an example, like, what if next to your government bonds, you had some bitcoin? Bitcoin would have helped you tremendously in a cris like Greece, or in a cris like Argentina, with inflation or what have you. So that's what caught my interest initially.
00:03:54.330 - 00:04:22.000, Speaker B: Any similarities that you've been drawing between what happened in Greece and in Europe versus where we are today post COVID? We're dealing with a lot of challenges in the macro environment. So, yeah. What sorts of lessons are you bringing forward to living today in 2022?
00:04:22.550 - 00:05:37.990, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question, because right now, crypto, bitcoin, ethereum, like all crypto assets, are highly correlated to markets and interest rates, right? So you're like, what's the hedge here? Like, for example, when I bought into bitcoin, I was thinking of it as a hedge, and it happened to be in cases like the haircuts on the depositors in Cyprus, bitcoin popped very substantially during that period. Now you have this big correlation, but in some ways, everything has been correlated, right? Even gold is down, bonds are down, gold is down, stocks are down, real estate is going to be down, everything is down. It's a general broad liquidity crunch, and that has taken crypto with it for the time being. But a few things. Number one, that doesn't say much to me with respect to what correlation the future holds. The correlation of crypto and bitcoin and ethereum has been very volatile over the years, and it's been rolling from negatively correlated to very correlated. And now we're in a period of high correlation.
00:05:37.990 - 00:06:42.526, Speaker A: That's, number one, I think that would change over time. Number two, I think that in some ways it's a positive that you're seeing this correlation. It means there's probably more institutional adoption now, and it's part of broader portfolios. So it means the space has grown versus a few years back. So if it's a part of institutional portfolios and it starts becoming more, in a way, at least short term, correlated to market movements, those are two things. On the other hand, I would say that this space has a very long ways to grow, and jumping into conclusions about what its role is as an asset is very premature. Like, you can't call it bitcoin a hedge, I think, although initially that's what caught my interest.
00:06:42.526 - 00:06:58.930, Speaker A: You can't call it a hedge for financial markets, but you can call it a hedge for the financial system and a breakdown of the financial system. But maybe not day to day correlation in terms of normal environments.
00:06:59.910 - 00:08:22.990, Speaker B: Yeah. I think that narrative of bitcoin being a hedge in downtimes, that has officially been put to rest, I think, in 2022. And to be fair, all other digital assets are correlated even with. I think ETH has arguably led during this bear market, at least over the last few months here leading up to the merge. But regardless, the self custody aspects of digital assets is just so powerful. And I want to say, I think you've pointed out a really clear example when you really do need to be able to circumvent institutions and government that you've believed was in your best interest, but now have seemingly made mistakes or turned against you, it's good to be able to know that you have 100% control of those digital assets. Marcos, can we talk a little bit, then, about early on your time going back to Cambridge associates? Can you talk about some of the early theses that you started to form as you did more research on this sort of emerging space of what was bitcoin and eventually evolved into more digital assets?
00:08:23.730 - 00:09:09.242, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely. That was back in 2017, 2018, when I started researching the space for Cambridge associates. And back then, most people were super skeptical in the institutional world about this. Right? People thought that, at best, this was a tulip bubble. At worst, like a scam, the whole space. But the reality of the matter was that I obviously had done a bit of research with bitcoin earlier, but I saw many things converging in my mind at the time that made me think this could be a massive space. And also, number two, which we can talk about later.
00:09:09.242 - 00:10:06.480, Speaker A: From a pure investment perspective, it seemed to me like a no brainer that it should be included in institutional portfolios. But what value did I see then? As I said, many things converging. First of all, I could see the concept of value being ported and created on the Internet, on open global networks, versus the offline system of thousands of little closed systems that are trying to communicate with each other. I saw that as something of huge potential. These are subtle innovations. Most people don't understand them immediately because, for example, double entry bookkeeping, like, if you had told people back then that it was a massive innovation, they probably would not have realized, because it's not evident physically in their life. But the idea of creating this open system of value exchange is massive, and it's the first time this has happened.
00:10:06.480 - 00:11:18.210, Speaker A: Number two, talent flow into the space. Just saw some very smart people going into the space, and that's typically a preview of these outsized outcomes historically, in terms, at least, of investment returns, the open source nature of the space, which means that it meant, in my mind, that it will likely move like wildfire in terms of growth. I don't think people realized that back then. The power of that open source nature. And then another important trend that was, in my mind, kind of overlooked at the time by institutions and others, was the social aspects and trends around this space. And what do I mean by that? Well, even despite the nasancy of the technology, people don't only care about experience and efficiency. There are millions of people who don't only care about user experience and efficiency, they also care about ownership.
00:11:18.210 - 00:11:58.418, Speaker A: Right. They care about being able to own their data, own their assets, have a say in their Internet communities and so on. So these were important social aspects around this technology that I think were being overlooked. It was easy to say Web two has better user experience, right? Sure. But it doesn't have owners. And to me, it's important. I don't know about others, but I think there are millions of people to whom this in itself is important.
00:11:58.418 - 00:12:21.900, Speaker A: It's an important part of the whole value proposition of crypto. Yeah, I think I threw a lot at you, but I think there were so many different things converging that I started seeing at the time that resonated with me, and I thought that it was important to focus a lot of time on this.
00:12:22.590 - 00:13:43.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I think many of us growing up would have never appreciated the sort of controls that the government has on money and that they are one and the same, that money has its value imbued through whatever government issued it. And I think what's really compelling about bitcoin, ETH, and some other digital assets is it presents a separation of the state and money. It presents the idea that maybe money could be a public good today. I still think of bitcoin and ETH, especially as these public goods that happen to be owned, I would say owned by a decentralized network of participants, all playing, like, their different roles. And that decentralization aspect, it takes quite a while to wrap your head around it. I truthfully don't think I've appreciated more of that until probably just the last year. It's been four to five years in crypto before you really start to understand what it means to have all these different players coordinating around a single crypto asset network.
00:13:43.830 - 00:14:24.590, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm with you there 100%. I think it takes a lot of time. You need to start using some of it as well. I think many folks who misunderstand this space, I think, have never used it or have never attempted to use it, have never owned a wallet, have never used a DeFi protocol, connected with a DeFi protocol, have never joined a Dow, have never bought an NFT. I think many folks just criticize this space without even having tried it. And I think if you tried, you learn about it. I can explain to it.
00:14:24.590 - 00:14:36.680, Speaker A: I can explain to people, like, in so many words what all these things are, but if they don't use it, it won't mean much to them. Right? So I think people should try to use it.
00:14:37.450 - 00:15:34.630, Speaker B: Absolutely. So if we go from, we were talking earlier about some of the crypto landscape and the theses that you were forming going back to 2018, if we fast forward to, let's say, like, 2020 and beyond, we now have endless use cases that are starting to pop up. And at the time, it was mostly DFI, some early NFT use cases, but this is really the rise of DFI in 2020. So I guess what starts to change in your conversations with clients or investors, I guess, were they starting to notice this shift in terms of real utility using crypto asset based networks? Or I guess, what was compelling beyond just a store of value that previously bitcoin had really owned?
00:15:35.210 - 00:16:16.530, Speaker A: That's a great question. And I think in 18, it was really hard, right, to have this discussion with folks, especially those who were very skeptical of the space. It was really hard because they always asked you, okay, so what is this used for? Right. What's the point? You told them your thoughts about bitcoin, but in their minds, it didn't resonate with everyone. It resonated with me. I had the greek experience, but didn't resonate with many others. So they were like, okay, so, okay, we have this, but what does it do? And Ethereum, what does it do other than ICOs? And kind of effectively crowdfunding.
00:16:16.530 - 00:17:10.150, Speaker A: That in itself was a huge use case, in my opinion, even though it was misused by many. But it was huge thought about, took a step back and really thought about it. But in any case, back then, kind of telling people that, yeah, we see talent going in here, this technology is very powerful, and the combination of the two will create applications in the future was a tough sell. Right, because there weren't any. But then what happened? DfI, as you said, 2020, DfI, then NFts, dows. Now we have web, three types of companies of all sorts out there that are well known at this point by folks like helium, for example. Whatever you believe about helium, people know about it.
00:17:10.150 - 00:18:22.378, Speaker A: They use it even companies are putting helium hotspots in rent tech companies, for example. So all of this happened really during the bear market, right? So the idea that talent and a powerful technology can come together to build applications did play out. So now you have much more proof than you did back then about what's to happen going forward. At least now you have the groundwork and you have several applications that have been used by millions of people. They've exchanged trillions of dollars in value. Defi now you have all this. So the question is, will the next wave be even better, even more powerful? And I have no doubt whatsoever if this space went from zero to having all these applications in a period of two years, from 2018 to 2020, now in the next two to three years, I think this is going to be an order of magnitude larger.
00:18:22.378 - 00:18:29.920, Speaker A: And I think that's easier to sell now to P two, to institutional investors, because there's a story to be told.
00:18:32.550 - 00:19:51.434, Speaker B: Marcos, what stories do you find then are most compelling? When we talk about DFI use cases or web3 use cases, we talked about the 2020 sort of era. Fast forward then even further to today, and we start to think more about an application layer that goes beyond the very popular l one narrative. That was a very prosperous era. Honestly, we're still in an era where there's probably a lot of money to be made investing in L1s. But I know I'm personally most excited about that application layer becoming richer, that DFI has just laid down some of the more foundational money Legos. When you have something like a compound or ave that is reliable, when you have stable coins by maker Dai that are reliable, now you can start to have more interesting experimentation, because again, it's a house with a foundation that is actually coming together. So anyways, what is starting to move the needle for investors you speak with in 2022?
00:19:51.632 - 00:21:09.730, Speaker A: Yeah, they generally want to see what they call real world use cases, which it's a flawed concept in my mind, but let's assume that we need real world use cases. And I think you're starting now to have, maybe we're not exactly there yet, but it's pretty evident that DeFi, for example, is very close at this point to be able to become embedded with a real world. Right. And what I mean by that, banks connecting people, putting their savings in various applications, of course there are risks. We can talk about that separately, but all of a sudden you have all, I think, the groundwork for the real world to start connecting to DeFi, for example, and you see it also with cases like things like Goldfinch or Credex maple, et cetera, where DeFi rails are being used for real world purposes. Right. Lending to emerging markets, companies lending to market makers, et cetera, et cetera.
00:21:09.730 - 00:21:45.134, Speaker A: So I think we're at the early stages of this. But I mean, the end game here is that DeFi will be a central hub for economic activity. Whether it's digitally native, whether it's speculative, whether it's non speculative, whether it's real world. It will be at the heart of initial. The first wave was obviously kind of more digital native, more speculative. But now we're going to move further. Of course, you need the infrastructure to be built alongside that.
00:21:45.134 - 00:22:20.060, Speaker A: You need kind of better more. You need Legos like insurance. These need to develop smart contract auditing. These happen, but you need more regulatory clarity is another thing that obviously we're relying on governments around the world to do that. But I think you have all these other things that need to be solved for it to become kind of a core piece of global infrastructure at this point.
00:22:20.830 - 00:23:19.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you make an interesting point about the real world use cases versus building for the digitally native economy. I can say I am very biased to building for that digitally native economy because I think that there's a thriving, urgent audience that wants to use these applications. And interestingly enough, their wealth has emanated from those opportunities on chain, and that's home. And it's kind of like the separation going back to the 90s. Early two thousand s of you had a newspaper would have a website, but it was very alternative to have a website. The real newspaper was the newspaper you got. If you got the New York Times, it was in paper format, and they would show and highlight certain stories online.
00:23:19.100 - 00:24:36.550, Speaker B: But now, today, really the New York Times, the paper is more of a relic, and everything sits within their app or on their website. And so I feel like we're sort of in that era where we're trying to bridge to these real world use cases. Maple, for example, looks like a platform that is issuing real world loans through market makers who use the infrastructure, and they issue under collateralized loans to their folks that they're really already doing business with. But the truth is, it's all happening on chain now. There's an element, of course, of trust there in terms of them doing due diligence on these folks, and they've got a whole sort of application that happens off chain. But at the end of the day, the loan is being originated on chain, it's being paid back on chain. And I think it sort of reinforces this idea that I think what we think of today as the digitally native economy that is probably going to eat the legacy sort of finance world.
00:24:36.550 - 00:25:21.598, Speaker B: Everything eventually, I don't want to say, ends up on chain, but everything eventually seizes the benefits of digital assets, the speed, the availability of them, the sort of like frictionless, permissionless opportunity to basically build and do whatever you want with it. But I guess, do you have a preference then, as you're talking with the funds that you invest with? Do the real world use cases excite you because that's what the larger capital allocators that invest in accolade are interested in? Or again, yeah. Do you see a greater urgency in the digitally native economy?
00:25:21.774 - 00:25:42.774, Speaker A: In my opinion, and that's why I said before, it's a flawed concept, in my opinion. I think you nailed it. I think you described it really well. In my opinion. You're creating kind of an artificial kind of debate here. Like, oh, I don't see any real world use cases yet. And it's all these speculative.
00:25:42.774 - 00:26:59.522, Speaker A: No, actually, these speculative. You call them speculative. Let's say they are. Okay, fine. These speculative use cases are creating an infrastructure that is going to be much more efficient, much more open, much more innovative for real world assets or for any asset, real world or digital or the metaverse or whatever. It's going to create something that is much more global, much more open, much more frictionless, much more composable, and it's going to enable all sorts of businesses and applications to flourish on top of that, versus now, where you have basically, don't quote me on this, but I would think, like in the hundreds of thousands of bookkeeping systems around the world, right, of hundreds of thousands, probably, where they're not communicating with each other. Everybody's asking for everybody else for permission to connect with each other.
00:26:59.522 - 00:27:25.290, Speaker A: They don't see what the other network is doing. And it creates this kind of messy situation where there's so many layers of intermediaries and hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, effectively what we will find out in the future, wasting their time. That's where it's heading, in my opinion.
00:27:25.790 - 00:28:18.998, Speaker B: Yeah. I get most excited about just the open nature of what's being built in the decentralized digital economy, because it comes down to the fact that any sort of value can essentially be tokenized. And if you throw out the buzwords again, it's value that's represented. It gives us liquidity. You could have liquidity around an individual who's, I guess, meaning to raise money so that they can go to college or go to university and basically tokenize themselves. We started to sort of see that narrative play out a few years ago. We've seen all sorts of new applications with NFT based loans.
00:28:18.998 - 00:29:44.358, Speaker B: So whatever an NFT means to someone, whether it's a piece of art or it's music or virtual land, whatever, I'm not concerned about that. We're so early right now where it's hard to explain to someone what Uber is when smartphones don't exist yet. And so when we think about where we are, I think it's about those really early building blocks that let you do what you want, move value, where you will be able to swap that value in the simplest sense, and be able to ultimately create more value. And that is what's remarkable about the last few years in DeFi especially, is we've seen Defi emerge on Ethereum, move to other chains. Now it's moving to more of the Ethereum based l two s. And you just see these economies continue to sort of create new and interesting applications for those that are already there. One thing I want to make sure we cover is before we talk a little bit more about how you think about crypto based funds, can we talk about accolade? Maybe a bit about the history of accolade, why you joined, what's the mandate there?
00:29:44.524 - 00:30:09.200, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely. So accolade is a fund of funds, venture capital, growth, equity, and crypto. Really, these are the three areas we're invested in. And we started out in 2000. That's way before I joined. It was Joel Caden who founded the firm back in the day. She's still around in the company here.
00:30:09.200 - 00:30:59.674, Speaker A: Now, we're 18 people. We're still a pretty small shop in terms of people. We manage about 5 billion in assets, and we have a very large presence in the blockchain crypto space. So we've launched several fundo funds around the space. We've backed several of the managers in the venture space, primarily meaning closed ended funds investing in crypto since 2018. So at this point, many of our investors are institutions, and they come to us to allocate the amount of capital they want to allocate to crypto and blockchain. They allocate it to us, and we allocate it to managers.
00:30:59.674 - 00:31:09.940, Speaker A: Right? So they delegate, they outsource that allocation decision to accolades. So that's in a nutshell, what we do.
00:31:13.270 - 00:31:38.506, Speaker B: Where do you think about value accrual? Moving beyond the L1 space? That's, again, been an area in the crypto space where there's been just incredible returns made. What else is really compelling to you and your partners at accolade in terms of value accrual moving forward?
00:31:38.688 - 00:32:45.454, Speaker A: Yeah. So let me say first that the value accrual in layer ones, and I can comment a little bit further on that, I don't think it's nowhere is anywhere near where it will eventually be, right. So I think there's an immense amount of upside for some of these assets still. And why? Because for some layer ones, basically their local asset is a form of money, a store of value. Right? And because it's a store of value kind of capturing, because they're layer ones capturing kind of the entire blockchain economy. It's a store of value for an entire blockchain economy. That's why I think they're much more powerful than payment tokens, for example, which are, there's one specific app or one specific application that uses this payment token to enable activity within its small ecosystem.
00:32:45.454 - 00:34:13.600, Speaker A: But then people immediately convert to the broader economy's asset, which is ethereum or bitcoin or salt. Having said that, I think the store of value money side of crypto has in my mind, like, immense upside because it's uncapped effectively, right. I can't recall exactly the numbers, but they're only like 50 million active users of crypto. Just imagine if more people starting to use and considering these assets as a store of value. I think other than that, there's all sorts of experiments being made on token kind of value accrual. I mean, back in the day we had the concept of the work token, right, which still exists, but something like live peer, you have staking, you have burning mechanisms. All these mechanisms, effectively what they try to do is they try to either decrease the velocity of the asset, which increases its value, or connect it kind of to the actual economic activity in a more direct way.
00:34:13.600 - 00:34:27.154, Speaker A: And I think people have progressed a lot with that, and there are all sorts of models. I mean, Ethereum is going to become partly that as well. Now, aside from a store of value.
00:34:27.272 - 00:35:22.450, Speaker B: Can we drill down into that a moment? So what are some of the conversations you're having around ETH as a store of value with larger capital allocators that would invest in the likes of accolade? A lot has changed with EIP 1559. We have now a burning mechanism, which has very cleverly tied a mechanism that makes ETH scarcer as the network becomes more used, as there's more transactions. And then we are. Hopefully I'll publish this later today, but we're actually recording this on the day of the merge. So the Ethereum network is about to go through the biggest upgrade in its history, which means there will be a 99.95% reduction in the carbon footprint, which is, I think, very friendly. I'm hoping for larger investors.
00:35:22.450 - 00:35:49.370, Speaker B: And then we're of course moving to proof of stake. This ultimately will reduce the issuance daily of ETH by about 90%. So just lots of different levers there being pulled. But to sum it up, ETH becomes exceedingly more scarce after the merge. So is this a conversation that you're having with capital allocators?
00:35:49.890 - 00:36:51.550, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think this is something that people are asking about a lot. They're asking about the new economics of ETH. I think everybody in the institutional world understands supply demand, right? Other things being equal. So if there's a certain value in the activities being performed on Ethereum, and you believe that these are valuable economic activities, then the native asset, if its supply starts decreasing or its growth starts decreasing as usage starts increasing, then it becomes more and more valuable supply demand. So I think people understand that. They also understand, they've started to understand proof of stake, what that means and staking, and how it's an activity that accrues yield.
00:36:51.550 - 00:37:44.500, Speaker A: So it's another way of connecting the local asset to the actual activity of the network. I think they understand these things. They love the reduction in energy consumption of Ethereum. I think we can talk about that in so much detail, and I have my own personal opinions around proof of work and proof of stake, bitcoin versus Ethereum. But the fact of the matter is that for institutions it's a big deal. I think it's a huge landmark, and I think in my mind it's very bullish long term for Ethereum. Now let's see.
00:37:45.750 - 00:38:52.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the reduction in the carbon footprint happens to be a very timely benefit from the merge or moving to Ethereum 2.0. I'm pretty optimistic that. I think the greater Ethereum community too will probably not. I want to say it's not a time for us to sort of stomp down then on proof of work. But I think, as you pointed out, there's a lot of really interesting discussions then to have about the impact of continuing with proof of work, which has been very reliable for keeping bitcoin and Ethereum decentralized and secure. But we do live in a world where obviously we have severe climate change and there's concerns about fossil fuels and their usage and so on, and how it relates back to. Yeah, I'm kind of grateful as an Ethereum community member that we just happen to be having this upgrade now.
00:38:52.694 - 00:39:08.860, Speaker B: Marcus, we only have a few more minutes here, so just a few faster, shorter questions here for you. What are some of the best practices that you've noticed among the crypto funds managers that you've worked with?
00:39:09.970 - 00:40:39.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a few things that some managers have been very good at. I think this is a space, obviously, that has a ton of upside potential. So you can spread your bets like really thin and invest in hundreds of things, and this whole portfolio can work out really well, as it did in 2018, for example. But I think some of the most interesting managers try to concentrate their bets to a certain extent, right, and have relatively high ownership versus their fund sides, which generally sets them up for potential for substantial outperformance. Because if you have a $20 million fund, like, just an example, theoretical, and you own, like, it wouldn't happen with a $20 million fund, but it's, again, theoretical example. If you own 3% of a network and your fund is a $30 million fund, you need a couple of, or one big, large outcome to return your fund, rather than multiple kind of large outcomes to return your fund. So I think some managers have put a lot of thought into kind of constructing a smart portfolio in that sense, with their highest conviction ideas, which is diversified enough.
00:40:39.260 - 00:41:43.022, Speaker A: It sounds more scientific, it's more an art, but that's one observation. Number two, I think some managers have been smart about returning capital to investors, at least derisking them. And I think that's something folks in the closed ended world should think about in the next bull market. I think you have all these outside investors who believe in the space, but who also view it kind of as an option. If you're up ten X and you have liquidity, I think it's smart to give some money back. Even if you think that the upside long term is much higher, at least give an amount that is their cost basis back, or double their cost basis back, or three times their cost basis back, and then they're riding with this massive option thereafter for further gains. Right.
00:41:43.022 - 00:42:23.930, Speaker A: So the reason I mentioned this is because in the recent downturn, some 20 X type returns became like two X type returns, and it will just take a long time to get back to it. So I think when there's a bull market, try to take advantage of it more. Sounds simpler than it actually is, and it's always easier after the fact to say these things. But that's something for people to think about. I think so. Portfolio construction and smart return of capital. Not excessive, but smart return of capital.
00:42:25.150 - 00:42:37.600, Speaker B: Makes sense. Makes sense. And then lastly, since the markets turned bearish, how has that affected your view, if at all, of DFI and web3?
00:42:38.850 - 00:43:13.100, Speaker A: I think I'm as bullish as ever, personally, because I think that the mechanics that we described before are in full force. Right. You have a very powerful technology. You have more developers coming in, net inflow of talent coming in, even though there are people who are going to drop off. It's a net inflow versus two years ago. You have a more mature stack upon. People are going to be, which people are going to be building for the next two to three years.
00:43:13.100 - 00:43:38.994, Speaker A: You have better prices, so you're setting yourself up for outsized returns again, I think, so long as you're patient. Like if it's not going to happen in three months or a year, but in three, four, five years. So I'm as bullish as ever at this point. Yeah.
00:43:39.112 - 00:44:37.000, Speaker B: There's just so much opportunity right now. I think what's been probably the silver lining over the last few months is seeing a lot of the coveted Defi foundational money Legos hold up despite the market crash, despite some really tragic sort of contagion from the collapse of centralized crypto market participants like Celsius and a few others. But, Marcos, we can go and end here. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today just about how you and your partners are thinking about what's investable now in 2022 in crypto and moving forward. Want to remind everyone they can learn more about accolade here@accoladpartners.com. I guess. Anything else, Marcos, before we go?
00:44:37.690 - 00:45:29.240, Speaker A: No, I think I really appreciate the invitation. It's great to chat live with you defied that this time. We've had several conversations before. What I would say is that I think maybe as a closing note here that, yeah, it's a bear market, yet there's inflation. Yes, interest rates are going higher. Yes, this is probably going to be worse in the near term, but in the grand scheme of things, it's a very small, a very short period of time. And if you have kind of a longer term time horizon or even a medium term time horizon, this is an interesting time to invest and to build, actually.
00:45:29.240 - 00:45:30.582, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:30.636 - 00:46:26.486, Speaker B: And if anything, I think you reiterated the idea that you should get out there and you should try some of these applications. Download a crypto wallet, keep it simple. I'm not endorsing or recommending that anyone make any type of investment here, but play with some very small amount of money and you can really start to see the magic of both DFI and web3 applications, especially some of the emerging web3 games that are in development. And then just quick reminder, if you enjoyed this, you can subscribe@dfidad.com follow me though on lens tube. This is where I'm posting all this content moving forward, which is web3 media powered by lens protocol. And then lastly, if you are a talented builder, please reach out to me and my team at Fourthrevolution Capital because we'd love to partner with you if you're building for DFI or web3.
00:46:26.486 - 00:46:32.420, Speaker B: So, Marcos, I'll end it here, but just thanks so much for your time and everyone, thanks for tuning in. We'll see you next time.
