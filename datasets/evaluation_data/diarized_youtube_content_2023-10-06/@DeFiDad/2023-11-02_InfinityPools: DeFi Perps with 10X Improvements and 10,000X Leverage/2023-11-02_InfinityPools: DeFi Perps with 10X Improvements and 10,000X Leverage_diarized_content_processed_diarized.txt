00:00:00.170 - 00:00:11.786, Speaker A: You know, derivatives are gonna, like, absolutely explode. We need to be positioned such that we can benefit from that, you know, growth. We need to change something about the status quo of d five derivatives.
00:00:11.818 - 00:00:12.062, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:12.116 - 00:00:23.150, Speaker A: We need to actually find a way to make defi derivatives ten x better than their off chain or, you know, traditional finance CFI equivalents.

Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:03:02.650 - 00:03:19.178, Speaker C: All right, so let's introduce Matu, the co founder and CEO at Infinity Pools. He previously graduated from Columbia University with a degree in computer science, and after graduation would go on to work as a quant, a researcher, and a product manager. Matu, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:19.264 - 00:03:21.950, Speaker A: Thanks for having me on, guys. Pleasure to be here.
00:03:22.020 - 00:04:23.902, Speaker C: We are just really excited for infinity pools because it seems like a new design that's going to actually transform the way that we trade perps on chain. And so today, what we're going to do, given the fact that infinity pools is still in beta and we hope or think that it's coming out very soon. So we're going to talk through what we can while the product is not fully live and try to dumb down how we as users might look to use it, while also covering all of the information you need to know to understand the design and of course, some of the risks to using infinity pools. But, Matu, could we talk then about your crypto story? We always love to get people's background and just learn a bit about what drew you in. It's kind of the common starting point for all of us in crypto. So anyways, how did you get started with crypto and what led you ultimately to start on infinity pools?
00:04:23.966 - 00:05:25.334, Speaker A: Yeah, so that story goes a long way back. I've always kind of had 1ft in crypto, but I really, really started my freshman year at college. I was on engineering only floor, so everyone on my floor was actually an engineer, which is an incredibly nerdy thing to do. But one of my neighbors was like one of the first users of Coinbase and pitched bitcoin mining to me as a quick way to make $30 a month. And back then we were using the college campuses electricity, which was free. And so, yeah, just started like bitcoin mining in my dorm room on my laptop, which obviously wasn't incredibly powerful, but still made the little money, eventually got more and more into it, especially as the price went up. And yeah, that's kind of like how I originally got into it.
00:05:25.372 - 00:05:33.800, Speaker D: Matu, love the backstory. That's one of the cooler crypto backstories I think I've heard so far. But did you get caught doing.
00:05:34.890 - 00:05:35.446, Speaker A: Did.
00:05:35.548 - 00:05:37.634, Speaker D: Were the electricity bills noticed?
00:05:37.762 - 00:05:59.760, Speaker A: No. So they weren't actually, because a few different reasons. Number one, it was like a building wide electricity bill, I think. So it wasn't like, anything that you could track back to one room and number two, back then, it was like, 2013, nobody knew what bitcoin was, so I think they assumed that I was, like, grilling food for something.
00:06:00.210 - 00:06:04.842, Speaker D: So this is, like, your public admission. Hopefully, nothing comes of this now that you've.
00:06:04.906 - 00:06:06.690, Speaker A: That's limitation, baby.
00:06:08.390 - 00:06:36.394, Speaker D: All right, let's get into infinity pools a bit. I think maybe before we jump into describing what it is, I still kind of want to know how it came together. Like, okay, you're doing this bitcoin mining in your dorm. Obviously, some time passed and you had this idea, but, yeah, how did it come together? I know you raised money, like, two years ago now, and presumably you've been working on it ever since. So maybe fill us in on kind of those missing pieces as well.
00:06:36.512 - 00:07:38.298, Speaker A: The interesting story is that when we originally raised money for a company, which know, technically, Lemma Labs is the company building the Infinity Pools protocol. So when we raised money for llama Labs originally, we were building a completely different protocol, and we kind of came in, it was like, 2021, I believe. And I had this thesis that DFI derivatives were about to absolutely explode. I saw perpetual protocol starting to get some volume back then. They were still on XDI, which is big throwback for the OG derivatives people. And Defi and DygX still hadn't started their liquidity mining campaign, which is what really started it all. And we were like, yeah, derivatives are going to absolutely explode.
00:07:38.298 - 00:08:31.342, Speaker A: We need to be positioned such that we can benefit from that growth. And so our original protocol was built on top of these different perp Dexs. The problem that we very quickly realized is that perdexes were not like uniswap. They were essentially copy and paste of what was already existing off chain and essentially just transported on chain. So what you ended up with is a product that, okay, didn't have KYC, didn't have custody of your assets, but it had a way worse performance and no tangible ten x benefits. And so we didn't really see the growth that we wanted to see.
00:08:31.396 - 00:08:31.710, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:31.780 - 00:10:02.320, Speaker A: Like, volumes definitely exploded for a while, but then were stagnant. This was compounded with other things that obviously led to us thinking, like, okay, well, we need to change something about the status quo of d five derivatives, right? We need to actually find a way to make D five derivatives ten x better than their off chain or traditional finance CFI equivalents, alternative. And so actually, originally, the way that we started researching the protocol and the original problem that we were trying to crack is just how do we have futures on the long tail of assets? And that's how we originally really kind of got into the infinity pools architecture. And we found out that, turns out that it could do way more than just that. It had five different ten x improvements. That was kind of like how we originally started working towards the problem of solving some of the things that we had seen in the perptex landscape. So then you asked about raising money.
00:10:02.320 - 00:10:18.222, Speaker A: I think that raising money in that environment 100% was easier to do. I think that a lot of VCs, a lot of investors agreed with us on our thesis that derivatives were going to explode.
00:10:18.286 - 00:10:18.562, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:18.616 - 00:10:48.700, Speaker A: And we still maintain that this thesis is true. I think that the only thing that's changed is the timescale. Right. So we still believe that this is going to happen, but instead of happening in one or two years, it's going to happen over a five year horizon. In the end, yeah. For us, it was honestly quite easy raising money. We had more term sheets than we knew what to do with.
00:10:48.700 - 00:11:00.606, Speaker A: We ended up picking the people that we believed were the best fit. That was kind of it.
00:11:00.708 - 00:11:36.650, Speaker C: In the intro, I mentioned that there's unlimited leverage. You can trade any asset once this is live. There's no liquidations, there's no oracles. I mean, it's kind of like a wish list of what we all are looking for from Defi perps. Now, nomadic, and I have actually reviewed, I think, really all of the major perps trading protocols, maybe other than like Dydx on the show this year. And they all have their own flavor, but they look pretty similar. You tend to see a bunch of liquidity pooled.
00:11:36.650 - 00:12:26.490, Speaker C: That pool, whether it's segregated by markets or it's all in one, acts as the counterparty to traders. Traders are ultimately borrowing, they're paying borrowing fees, they're paying funding rates, and at the end of the day, it's player versus player, and it's all happening within that protocol. There's no liquidity being sourced other than maybe Contango we just reviewed where they loop it on Aave. So the fact that you actually are benefiting from the liquidity within uniswap here is what's really interesting. So, I don't know, maybe we could start there. Or again, however you want to talk through that piece by piece, how those features differentiate from the legacy trading experience.
00:12:26.640 - 00:13:44.100, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think that the best way to think about it is that the reason that we're so different, that infinity pools is so different from every protocol out there, is because we rebuilt really, the notion of derivatives and what a derivative is supposed to be from the ground up, right. We essentially thought about what futures are, what perpetual futures are, and essentially, from a first principles perspective, rebuilds the entire stack from the ground up. So maybe an easy intuitive way to think about it is what is a perpetual future? A perpetual future is essentially just a one day future that gets rolled over automatically. That gets rolled over every single day, right? And the payment for that future that traders pay is called a funding rate, right? So when you pay that funding rate, what you're actually doing is that you're paying for this one day future that gets rolled over. Right. Or that's easy, intuitive way to think about it.
00:13:44.100 - 00:14:31.038, Speaker A: What we did is quite similar, but instead of futures, what we do is that we roll over something like options. So it looks like perpetual futures in the front end, but in the back end, it's actually much more similar to an options protocol, and there's obviously a lot more nuance to it. But in this case, options are just a much better instrument to create derivatives than futures. And there's a bunch of different reasons for that, but at a super high level, because it's such a different mechanism. That's why we can offer all these new features. So is this maybe a good time to start sharing my screen, to walk people through the protocol?
00:14:31.134 - 00:15:01.030, Speaker C: You read my mind. I was thinking that I'd much rather see it in action than talk through it in theory. So, yeah, if you don't mind sharing your screen, by the way, for folks who are listening to this in the future, you can go to our link tree at edge, underscore pod, and then if you just find the YouTube link to this, you can find this and it'll be marked according to chapters in YouTube. So anyways, Mattu. Yeah. Talk us through or describe what we're looking at here with the infinity pools beta.
00:15:01.110 - 00:15:39.674, Speaker A: Sure. So you know this is one of the pools that you'll be able to access, right? This is a very classic EQSDC pool here. You'll have access to any token, right? You'll be able to look up all markets right now because it's a beta. We just have EPSDC, but you can imagine that pretty much any token pair you can think of, you'll have access to here. Then you have the docs and the dashboard. The dashboard really is just while tracking your portfolio value, et cetera, et cetera, like positions, stuff like that. And then this is really the meat of the trading experience.
00:15:39.674 - 00:16:57.458, Speaker A: And most people should feel as if this is a very familiar experience, right? This is nothing drastically new. You have the price, you have trade, earn, earn is what we call providing liquidity, right? So if you go on earn, very soon, you'll be able to see how you're able to provide liquidity. It's extremely simple once again, but maybe can do a separate video for that later. Then if you're trying to trade, you've got long short. You can deposit either ETH or USDC with collateral. So anytime you have a pool, right? So if you have, for example, if you're trying to trade chain link BTC, right? Like, and so you have a pool that's link BTC, then you would be able to deposit either link or, you know, we'll have multi collateral from the get go, which is kind of a cool feature that a lot of exchanges currently do not have. But in this case, as you can see, my balance of USDC is 800 or $900.
00:16:57.458 - 00:17:28.586, Speaker A: I'll deposit, let's say 100, and then, yeah, I can select the leverage or my position size. In this case, usually I can go up to 1000 x leverage, I think with our beta. Or let's maybe start with a more conservative 500 x. Seems like we change some of the liquidity things in the pool because this is all like real simulate. Oh, sorry, I'm putting 7000 x leverage right now.
00:17:28.688 - 00:18:10.394, Speaker C: I was going to say. I was like, oh, wow, we're up to 7000 x leverage. Mattu, as you're punching this in, this is a very familiar setup. Really simple looking user interface. For those of us who would want to long or short ETH, we would come to infinity pools. You've already pointed out we have the ease of depositing as collateral, like we do on every other perps trading UI we would deposit here, either USDC or ETH. So one of the two tokens in the pair, and then, per usual, now we're picking our leverage, which determines our total position size.
00:18:10.394 - 00:18:56.162, Speaker C: And in this case, you've got 700 x leverage. What I'm wondering here then is what are the considerations here below as I look at the order details of interest rate, hourly and so on? Because this is different. This is really what stands out to me other than the humongous number available for leverage. I'm used to looking at that and knowing that, okay, my liquidation is here, or I'm going to set a stop loss here. That's really an enormous incentive or driving force in other designs of perps that's not here. We can't be liquidated. So is it strictly the interest rate hourly.
00:18:56.162 - 00:19:04.362, Speaker C: That's going to scare folks off from doing stupid things with super high leverage. Anyways, can you take it away from there?
00:19:04.496 - 00:19:53.642, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. As you said, this is definitely where things get super interesting. Right? So number one, you've got the execution price and the market impact. Actually, the two kind of go in hand in hand, right? So the execution price and the market impact is really just you opening your long or short position, right. It's like you getting positioned into your long or short. And we actually use one inch on the back end to do this, which means that on any coin that you trade on infinity pools from day one, you'll actually have access to the best liquidity in the entire spot market. Which is why what you're seeing right now is actually what you're going to get on day zero of infinity pools on main net.
00:19:53.696 - 00:19:53.914, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:53.952 - 00:20:00.362, Speaker A: And actually, what's real interesting, do you see how the market impact just turned green? That's positive slippage.
00:20:00.426 - 00:20:00.702, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:00.756 - 00:20:55.310, Speaker A: So you could actually get positive slippage on infinity pools when entering a position. So that's the first thing to keep in mind. And then below that, you get the interest rate hourly. So it seems like a lot, right? It's one point percent, which is crazy. But then again, you have to remember that you're borrowing 700 x what you're putting down, which means that you put down $100 and you're borrowing $70,000 going wow, on Ethereum, which is a volatile asset. So it makes sense that the interest rate would be quite high. I think the best way to think intuitively about the interest rate is by looking at the estimated time to close.
00:20:55.310 - 00:21:33.254, Speaker A: And actually, the estimated time to close is probably the main thing that I look for when I select my leverage. So when I see that the estimated time to close for a position is about two minutes, that means that I expect more or less that the price will go up in the next two ish minutes. Right. It doesn't mean if it goes up after two minutes, I could still make money. Right. Because my position doesn't close immediately. Actually, with 700 x, it does close immediately.
00:21:33.254 - 00:21:51.422, Speaker A: So, yeah, like two minutes is about the amount of time that you have before the price goes up before your position closes. And then for 700 x is actually much longer than you would get on most, like, perked X's, right? Yeah.
00:21:51.476 - 00:22:44.622, Speaker C: Could I flip that on its head? So I like the way you framed it up in this case. This is a really extreme example, but this is also one of the. I think this is a really good example of how you've modified the user experience for trading with leverage on chain. And so now you could also think of it as I've got two minutes before the 100 USDC that I deposited as collateral is eaten up by the hourly interest rate. So you really can start to think very differently about how you open these positions. I'll say I personally tend to trade with stop losses and I don't look at my liquidation as like, okay, that's a failed trade. I'm not looking to risk the entire position, but folks will.
00:22:44.622 - 00:23:36.094, Speaker C: That's one way to trade is to trade with a position that you can get liquidated on and say okay, that was the maximum amount of money I plan to lose on that trade. And so this is really cool for me. It's like a new way to think about it. It makes sense to me too, like the way you described it and seen it on screen. I also just want to point out the fact that people in crypto generally love leverage. I mean, I'm not going to say that's a good quality that our users seem to all have, but it's giving people the tools to do what they want when they want with their money. And so if you want to go 708 x leverage with 100 USDC for a two minute trade, you can do that here with infinity pools.
00:23:36.222 - 00:24:24.606, Speaker D: I think it's super intuitive and interesting, like tapping into an aggregator like one inch to kind of source liquidity all throughout DeFi. I mean, we always talk about composability and that's the dream, protocols building on top of other protocols. And I've kind of see us gone away from that a little bit as other protocols have gotten maybe more greedy to kind of have the whole stack or something like that. But in this case you can't really just spin up a one inch and kind of do what they're doing. But I would imagine they're pretty happy with this arrangement. Kind of like you funneling I guess, volume and activity through them. Is there any other aggregators you'd be able to use or is kind of one inch going to be the de facto?
00:24:24.798 - 00:24:57.434, Speaker A: Yeah, any. Right, once again, for infinity pools, as long as the transaction is atomic, it means we could use any decks whatsoever, right? So we could use GMX, we could use matcha, we could use Arc zero x, I guess. Yeah, literally anything works. We just chose one inch because that's where the first one we thought of.
00:24:57.472 - 00:25:25.722, Speaker C: But can we talk about what's happening under the hood here? So let's pretend I just opened up along I deposited my USDC. I'm longing ETH USDC. And let's pretend like the market goes up during the two minutes, and I'm going to eventually close this out with a profit. Can you walk us through from start to finish, from opening to closing? What's happening under the hood?
00:25:25.806 - 00:25:56.878, Speaker A: Sure. Also, I actually want to address something that you said earlier that I didn't really get a chance to, but you said that when you get liquidated, or that's kind of like how you tend to close your positions, it doesn't go well. A big difference between infinity pools, and I would say most perpetuxes, is that we don't have liquidations. We have what we call a closing of the position.
00:25:56.964 - 00:25:57.214, Speaker B: Right?
00:25:57.252 - 00:26:49.470, Speaker A: Like when your collateral runs out, and some people might be like, well, aren't those the same thing? Essentially, your position gets closed against your will. There's actually a huge difference. Really important to get the terminology on this rate, because liquidations come along with liquidation penalties. Liquidation penalties, they can be anywhere from when FTX was around and we all knew that they were scamming everyone, right? And people were like, oh, liquidation penalties are not that bad. Well, there's a reason that they weren't that bad is because they weren't actually liquidating anyone. And look where we ended up. So basically, it can go from 50 bips all the way up to 3%, right? And I'm talking like 3% of your entire position, not your collateral.
00:26:49.470 - 00:27:49.906, Speaker A: That means that when you get liquidated, you're actually losing a lot more money than you're supposed to. So basically, using stop losses, actually way better way to get out of a position rather than just letting the market do its thing. And sometimes even those don't work, right, just because the market moves so fast that the exchange just decides that it's time to liquidate you before your stop loss kicks in. Okay, so what's happening with infinity pools behind hood is that. What's happening is that when you click long here, if I were to click place order here, a couple of things would happen. The first thing that would happen is that our back end would see that order. It'd be like, okay, this person is trying to go long, this amount of money.
00:27:49.906 - 00:29:05.014, Speaker A: So this is how much they're trying to borrow. They would look at the infinity pools liquidity, right? So, like, at our amm, and see how much liquidity is in this amm, and then basically pick and choose which lp positions need to be borrowed in order to get the trader the exposure that they want for the lowest interest rate. And the process, when our back end essentially picks and chooses which lp positions get borrowed, we call that a routing engine or a matching engine. You can kind of think of it as a uniswap router type thing, but for interest rates. So what it's really doing is that it's optimizing the interest rates that you pay for borrowing these different LP shares. So very much like margin trading, what happens is that to go long Ethereum, for example, in martian trading, what's happening is that you're borrowing cash, you're borrowing USD, and then you're swapping the USD over to Ethereum. To go long Ethereum.
00:29:05.062 - 00:29:05.274, Speaker C: Right?
00:29:05.312 - 00:29:50.200, Speaker A: So that's what happens with martian trading with infinity pools. What you're doing is that you're borrowing LP tokens, you're backed by USDC, backed by USDC, and then you're taking that USDC and you're swapping it for Ethereum. And that's how you go long ethereum. So the borrowing of these LP tokens once again is done taking liquidity from our Amm. Then we're taking that USDC that backs these LP tokens and we're swapping them over to Ethereum using one inch. So this is how you're entering into the launch position and yeah, that's all there is to it.
00:29:51.230 - 00:30:32.310, Speaker C: What happens then when we close that position? So I think I'm understanding the entering it. We borrow an LP, you're doing some swapping, and that's what enables me to get that leverage. And actually, if we can talk about the two different examples here, let's say I'm long and the market moves in my favor, so now I'm in profit and we're going to close the position. And then can we talk about if the market moves against me and let's say my position is closed out in two minutes because the market's down and I'm at a loss.
00:30:32.730 - 00:32:09.698, Speaker A: Sure. So let's actually make this concrete, right? So let's say I've got ten X leverage, right? So here per month, for example, okay, so what happens when I want ten X leverage? Well, basically what happens, and let's say that the market price in Ethereum is $1,000. Just so it makes things super simple, market price of Ethereum is $1,000. What happens here is that once again, our back end is going to look at our Amm. It's going to be like, okay, I need to borrow lp positions to enable ten X leverage. And in order to do that, it needs to borrow lp positions where the midpoint is $900, right? So like 10% below market price, right, because 10% below market price is where the theoretical liquidation would be otherwise with ten X leverage, right? So matching engine routing, routing engine looks at DMM, goes, okay, I need to combine Lp tokens such that the midpoint is $900. What that means is that it can either borrow lp positions at $900, right? Or it can borrow lp positions at 850 and 950 and combine them to create that $900 liquidity position, right? So that's the first step.
00:32:09.698 - 00:33:47.910, Speaker A: It'll borrow this LP position. And then let's say that this lp position is backed by 1000 USDC, right? So it will take this thousand USDC, swap it for ETH at the current market price, which is one ethereum, right? So basically the trader will be long one Ethereum. At this point, if the price goes up, the trader can sell that one Ethereum for, let's say the price of Ethereum goes up to $1,500. The trader can take that one Ethereum, sell it for $1,500, and then take that $1,500, pocket $500 in profit, and then use the remaining thousand USDC to mint back dlp positions at $900. Because once again, nothing's changed there, right? All you need to do is pay the loan back if the price moves against you, that's where things get interesting, right? So let's say in this case, the trader borrowed a single lp position at $900. Well, the price goes down to $900. Then the trader who has one Ethereum on their balance sheet can only sell that one Ethereum for $900, right? So they need $1,000 to pay back the loan.
00:33:47.910 - 00:34:44.402, Speaker A: So basically they're $100. They dipped out $100 loss. So let's call that the max loss at $900, right? So here it means that their starting collateral has to be at least $100. If the, if the, if the price of Ethereum falls below $900, what happens? Well, the liquidity provider, right? That was at $900, no longer expects back $1,000 back, right? They're no longer expecting 1000 USDC back. What they're expecting back is 1000 USDC converted into Ethereum at the $900 price point, which means that it's 1.1 ethereum, right? 1000 USDC converted to Ethereum, and $900 is 1.1 ethereum.
00:34:44.402 - 00:35:21.678, Speaker A: Trader already has one ethereum on their balance sheet, which means that all they need is an extra 0.1 ethereum. 0.1 Ethereum is always worth less than $100 below $900. So no matter where the price goes, the maximum loss for the trader versus their debts, which is denominated in this LP token, is $100. If the maximum loss is $100 and the maximum amount of money they can borrow is $1,000, as we saw in this example, then that's ten x leverage.
00:35:21.854 - 00:35:50.974, Speaker C: For the estimated time to close here. Is that going to be changing on us? Like, I'm looking at that right now, estimated time to close is four months. If the price of ETH changes, which it's always changing. Let's pretend it goes down. Let's pretend we go from $1,800 per ETH to $1,000 per ETH. Would our estimated time to close change then on that open position?
00:35:51.092 - 00:37:18.010, Speaker A: So the estimated time to close is specifically if the price doesn't move. If the price goes down, then yes, the estimated time to close would also go down, potentially, because it's a little bit complicated. But essentially, infinity pools uses unrealized PNL to keep the position going, right? So, like, for example, on top of your collateral that you put up front. On top of that, what happens is that we also use unrealized PNL to keep your position going, right? So, for example, if I go long 700 x Ethereum, and my position makes a shit ton of money, well, doesn't mean that it's actually going to close in two minutes, right? Because once again, infinity pools is just going to use all the unrealized PNL to keep the position going. So, theoretically, I could keep that 700 x position open as long as I could as I can, or as long as it permits me to, right? Like even days or weeks or whatever. Similarly, when the price doesn't move, we basically use kind of like that unrealized PNL that's kind of there, but not really there to keep your position going. So it keeps it going for four months.
00:37:18.010 - 00:37:38.398, Speaker A: In this case, if it goes down, that unrealized PNL no longer exists. So basically, it's a little bit hard to understand, but you start with positive unrealized PNL, and then if the price goes down, then you no longer have that starting positive, like unrealized PNL. So it does go down.
00:37:38.484 - 00:39:16.958, Speaker C: This makes sense. You're opening a position, and you can think of it as the unrealized PNL is being eaten up if the market's moving against your directional bet. And once you get down to no PNL, you're now in the negative and you're eating up your collateral. So I really am starting to understand that there's just a reframing of how you view your position here, but you're using, and I think this is using some of the wording in the white paper and some of your blog posts. You use just a very concrete or certain math here to ensure that the position can be paid back without going the route of liquidation penalties. It really is like a huge shift in the way that we've seen perps designed. And I'm looking at this and I'm thinking like, this is a great way for someone who wants to access the deep liquidity on something like uniswap to open up a levered position for an extended period of time with what I'm hoping is a more stable funding rate, a less volatile funding rate.
00:39:16.958 - 00:39:30.626, Speaker C: Maybe that's actually something you should speak to, is how stable or volatile you expect the funding rate here in comparison to existing decentralized perps products.
00:39:30.808 - 00:40:11.710, Speaker A: Yeah, that's actually a fantastic question. So there's really two perspectives to this. But specifically, I'll talk about the trading perspective. Right. So as a trader, what can I expect the funding rate to be like? In a perfectly efficient market, this funding rate should be very close to options premiums, right? So it should be very close to options premium. Now, will it actually always be that case, or will that always be the case? Well, not necessarily. Okay, so there's really two scenarios.
00:40:11.710 - 00:41:03.790, Speaker A: The funding rate goes below the options premiums, or it goes above the options premiums. So let's say that the funding rate goes below the options premiums. Well, in that case, there's actually a super simple arbitrage that you can do on infinity pools. You'd probably have to use the API to do it really well. But if the funding rate is too small or too cheap, basically what you can do is that you can create simultaneously a long and a short position that takes advantage of this cheap funding rate. And essentially what you're betting on is that the price is going to move more by more than what you're paying in funding up front. And then you can just like, it's what's commonly referred to in options as a strangle.
00:41:03.790 - 00:41:56.670, Speaker A: So you basically just create like 1000 x leverage strangle, and in expectation you make money. So kind of like a statistical arbitrage to push the funding rate up. So that's super capital efficient arbitrage to push the funding rate up. So that's one thing. If the funding rate is too high, or you perceive it to be too high. The cool thing about infinity pools is that there's really two things as a trader that you can do. The first thing is that we're actually working on implementing this feature, but we're going to have what's called an interest rate threshold or tolerance, where basically your position just unwinds once a funding rate exceeds a certain threshold.
00:41:56.670 - 00:43:02.194, Speaker A: So basically, unlike perps, where you're obliged to pay the funding rate or you have to exit the market, with us, it's just you stop renewing your position. So you kind of exit the market with no slippage. But then the other thing that also conceptually makes sense is that you can just provide liquidity, right? If the funding rate is too high, well, guess what? You can just click on earn here and provide liquidity instead of trading. And you might ask, well, why don't you just do that in perp markets, right? Well, it can perp markets. Providing liquidity is much more difficult, right. Because you need to have an entire setup and you don't get fully paid out on all the fees if you have limit orders, et cetera, et cetera, right. It's a much more involved process with us, you're providing liquidity to amm.
00:43:02.194 - 00:44:19.680, Speaker A: So from a retail perspective in particular, it's much, much easier. And on top of that, and there are a bunch of reasons for this, but we're really targeting passive liquidity providers, right? So there's going to be zero, in fact, market makers. We're working with zero market makers, and a lot of people are going to be like, oh, shit, isn't that really bad? Well, yes and no, right? There's a reason that a lot of people, for example, refuse to trade on exchanges where Citadel is the market maker, right. Because they know that Citadel is almost never going to give them an edge. Or one of the things that I always hear from market makers is like, oh, the dumber you are in finance or you're looking stocks, the better of a price we're going to give you. It's quite well known that the more uninformed low is like, what gives you the best prices. And so, yeah, basically not having market makers on the other side is actually also potentially a good thing.
00:44:19.680 - 00:44:37.526, Speaker A: In particular here could be a very good thing. And I kind of went on the tangent there, but hopefully that makes sense that if funding rates are high, just go provide liquidity. It's super easy and we'll make you a ton of money.
00:44:37.628 - 00:45:06.654, Speaker D: Matthew, something I wanted to ask you about when you were going through an earlier example. Just using high leverage is just about latency and how you're thinking about that or if that's even important in this whole arrangement. For some of this stuff, I'd imagine it's got to be pretty timely. And maybe that's like a broader question of like, I don't know what chain you're building on or kind of like where you're building. So if you could kind of package all that together with your answer, that'd be awesome.
00:45:06.772 - 00:46:01.310, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So first of all, I'm going to give a huge shout out to our engineering team because we've managed to get real lucky with our hires. We haven't really published a team page so far, but our team is incredibly impressive and obviously everyone's going to say that, but we've managed to build an extremely high performance system. It's all built in scala from head to toe. Basically the back end, like the front end, everything is extremely high performance, like some of the top engineering in the HR space. So from the get go, we've been super mindful with performance latency, especially when it comes to this super high leverage. Right.
00:46:01.310 - 00:46:44.270, Speaker A: You want to be able to see stuff updating extremely, extremely fast. If you want. I can go a little bit deeper into the backgrounds of our teams, but we have people from the top exchanges that came to work with us. We have actually a guy who's a professor at Cambridge in the math department that just joined us. Part time professor there. We've been very mindful of that. As for the chain, the cool thing about Pinney pools is that it's a bit like uniswap.
00:46:44.270 - 00:47:08.214, Speaker A: It's EVM based. We can launch anywhere we want. Doesn't really matter. What's going to matter is the liquidity. Right. We don't want to fragment liquidity too fast. So we're going to choose the chain a couple of weeks before we launch, stick to it for a while and then that'll be all.
00:47:08.214 - 00:47:22.554, Speaker A: But, yeah, we're going to choose like a pretty high performance chain. But yeah. Right now we have mostly leaning towards the big L two s. You can probably guess which ones.
00:47:22.672 - 00:47:33.870, Speaker D: Got it. Blockchains aren't always notoriously fast. So is there off chain elements to this? I saw something going through the docs about a matching engine.
00:47:34.020 - 00:47:49.342, Speaker A: Oh, that was just the interest rate router that I was talking about. That's it, yeah. Once again, you can think of it as the equivalent to a uniswap router. Right. It's really just giving you the best interest rate, but except for that, doesn't really serve a purpose.
00:47:49.486 - 00:48:01.318, Speaker D: One other thing that stood out is obviously this absence of oracles, could you just tell us how you solve for that? I think I kind of understand it, but maybe just walk us through that.
00:48:01.404 - 00:48:17.798, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So really there would be two areas where you would need an oracle with a protocol such as this. Right, so this is margin trading, or the easiest analogy is margin trading.
00:48:17.814 - 00:48:17.946, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:17.968 - 00:48:46.790, Speaker A: So you're borrowing and then you're swapping. So for the borrowing and the swapping, you would need, potentially you need prices, right? So for the borrowing, you need to know when to liquidate people. There you go. For the borrowing, you need to know when to liquidate people. And for a swap, you need to know what price to swap. Right. So let's start with the swapping.
00:48:46.790 - 00:48:55.702, Speaker A: Well, we use one, and theoretically we can use any spot decks that's available out there.
00:48:55.756 - 00:48:56.022, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:56.076 - 00:49:25.758, Speaker A: So you don't need an oracle quite simply because you can use whatever spot price you want. Or like, you can use whatever spot decks you want, which means that once again, it's completely in the user's hands. They can use whatever they want. In our case, we use one inch in the back end. So you don't need oracle quite simply because we're not the ones doing the swap. And then for the borrowing. Right, which is where you would get liquidated.
00:49:25.758 - 00:50:42.890, Speaker A: Well, where do we get our price? Well, once again, this is happening by borrowing liquidity out of the infinite pools amm, right. And so that means that we need to essentially be able to tell when the infrared pools by borrowing out of the liquidity. We're borrowing liquidity out of the infrared pools amm, which means that we need to be able to liquidate it at a given price point. Right, and what is that? Price point or not liquidated, but we need to know when it crosses certain threshold. What is this threshold? Well, once again, because it's an amm, it has its own internal price. So basically we just use the internal infinity pools amm price to take care of this price that's needed. Essentially, it's kind of like uniswap, right? Why doesn't uniswap need a price or an oracle? Why doesn't uniswap need an oracle? Well, quite simply because it has its own internal price that gets arbitraged to the correct thing.
00:50:42.890 - 00:50:44.106, Speaker A: And same for us.
00:50:44.208 - 00:51:08.930, Speaker C: Matu, can we talk a bit about the infinity LPs? If I'm an LP, am I going to deposit a uniswap LP or can I deposit single tokens? And I'm also concerned, if I deposit a single token, am I now exposed to impermanent loss for an LP. Anyways, what can you tell us about what we can expect as future LPs?
00:51:09.270 - 00:51:36.954, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. So if you remember, in my earlier screen, on each USDC, right, there was a trade and then there was an earn, and the earn was kind of like grayed out. When you click on earn, this is more or less where you're going to see. I think the only part that was changed was this one, actually. Well, specifically this one, actually. But the rest, including this, is going to be pretty much the same.
00:51:36.954 - 00:52:09.542, Speaker A: So I'll kind of run you through it. Okay. A couple of different things are happening. Number one, as you can see, this is like the link USBC price, right? And then you got two little best way to call these lines, or little sliders. Sliders is the correct word here that you can use. And what these sliders are doing is that they're actually the price range. So here, the price range here corresponds to where these sliders are.
00:52:09.542 - 00:53:43.070, Speaker A: Right. So if you increase your price range, you're increasing the slider width here, then you're depositing link and USDC, right. So this is just how many assets do you want to deposit to actually provide liquidity to the pool? And then obviously you can just go full range, which, by the way, for most beginner retail LPs, we would recommend not financial advice, but it's just kind of like easiest way to get started. So what is actually happening? Right. Like behind the scenes, what's the easiest way to conceptualize this? Basically, when you're providing liquidity on a spot, amm or on infinity pools. But on infinity pools in particular, because you're getting paid upfront, what you're really saying is like, hey, I believe that the price is more or less going to stay within this range, right. So basically what you're selecting here is you're selecting within which range you believe the price will stay, more or less, and then you're getting paid a bunch of fees for how long the price actually stays in that range.
00:53:43.070 - 00:53:52.466, Speaker A: Right. And so, yeah, that's like the super high level way to think about it. And then this is where current liquidity is deployed.
00:53:52.498 - 00:53:52.694, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:52.732 - 00:54:51.722, Speaker A: So if you guys know how uniswap does it, they just have this part flipped horizontally. And so in this case, you can kind of see, okay, most people deploy most of their liquidity closer to the midpoint. Okay, so that's the first part. And then there's another really interesting part here, which is the utilization ratio and the seven day historical APR. So the seven day historical APR, super easy to understand. In this given range, what have people been getting paid? Right? What is the average APR that I'm getting paid for providing liquidity in this range for betting on the fact that the price is more or less going to be within this range. And then the utilization ratio is actually much more interesting.
00:54:51.722 - 00:56:14.258, Speaker A: So the utilization ratio essentially tells you, well, how much of the liquidity within this range is currently being used to trade, right? Like how much of this liquidity, how much of the LP tokens in this range have been borrowed to actually create trades. And the higher the utilization ratio, the more likely it is that you're in expectation going to make money. Because what that means is that basically the interest rate that you get paid as a liquidity provider is made up of two parts. The first part is very similar to like black Shoals type, actually when your liquidity gets borrowed as a liquidity provider. So that's like when you get paid like an actual interest rate directly from traders, which is okay, so in that case there's really two parts, the interest rate that you get paid. The first part is once again this black holes type, what we call a floor rate, right? So this is like the minimum that you can get paid. And you can really think of it as like, hey, I'm selling options, what am I going to get paid? This is the options premium, right? So the options premium is this floor rate.
00:56:14.258 - 00:57:46.660, Speaker A: So the options premium is the minimum that you can get paid. And then what the utilization rate does is that if a lot of people are trying to buy, or if a lot of people are trying to borrow LP tokens, if a lot of people are trying to get leverage, if a lot of people are trying to create trades on the other side, right? So like on the trade side, then the utilization rate is going to go up and it's going to increase this base rate, this floor rate. So basically you're going to get paid more than options premiums. So the higher the utilization rate is, the more you're going to get paid than options premiums. And the more you get paid than options premiums, then the more you can expect to essentially make, the more you can essentially expect to get back in return, right, because this is simple math, right? Like if I'm getting paid way above options premiums, then it means that I'm getting overpaid. So as an LP, a good strategy or something that I would look out for is pools with high utilization rates, right? Because what that most likely means is that somebody is getting like LPs in this particular pool are getting overpaid. I'll stop here for a second and just see if there are any questions.
00:57:47.110 - 00:57:59.170, Speaker C: What sort of risks do we face as LPs? I'm trying to understand, is there any risk of bad debt?
00:57:59.250 - 00:58:04.470, Speaker A: Zero. Bad debt, zero counterparty risk? That's correct.
00:58:04.620 - 00:58:17.990, Speaker C: Right. Zero counterparty risk. You are exposed as an LP, you are exposed to impermanent loss, which is standard for the LP experience in uniswap.
00:58:18.070 - 00:58:37.786, Speaker A: Yeah. What people call impermanent loss is just whenever the price goes outside of this band, right. So, like, if the price goes outside of this band, people call that impermanent loss. Right. So there's a trade off that happens. The first thing is that you get paid more than uniswap.
00:58:37.818 - 00:58:37.966, Speaker D: Right.
00:58:37.988 - 00:59:18.798, Speaker A: The yields. Or actually, let me start with the con, right. Let me start with the bad news first. The bad news is that, and this is kind of like a good news, bad news kind of situation where you cannot withdraw your liquidity immediately, right? So unlike uniswap, let's say that I want to withdraw my liquidity. I cannot do that immediately unless I pay a small fee. So if I really, really think that shed's going down immediately with Luna, then I can pay a small fee to withdraw my liquidity. But if I want to withdraw my liquidity immediately, I cannot do it for free.
00:59:18.798 - 00:59:51.222, Speaker A: So that is the one thing that people are taking risk on. If people do want to withdraw their liquidity for free, then what they can do is that they can start the withdrawal process, and then it's exponential. So basically, it just goes down like this, right? So every day you get 60% back. So you get 50% back the first day, and then 25% back the second day, 12.5%, et cetera, et cetera. And in seven days, essentially 99.9, I think, is like.
00:59:51.222 - 01:01:22.498, Speaker A: Or like 99 or more than 99% is back. So in less than seven days, essentially, you get almost all of your assets back. So that is one kind of con that people might see to it. This is also a pro in some sense, right? Because what it means is that you don't have people like SCT or really big lev market makers coming in and essentially taking all the profits by doing just in time liquidity, right? Like, nobody can come in and steal your yields, right? So this is fantastic for retail and people that are really just trying to make passive yields, right. This is much better avenue to do that. And then the good news is also the fact that in return for locking up your liquidity like this, you get paid more than uniswap, right? Like the yields are just higher than uniswap because even when your liquidity is out of range, right? So let's say that, for example, instead of my slider being here, my slider was here, right? So nowhere near the current price range, I would still get paid yield. And that's pretty crazy, right? I get paid yield even when my liquidity is out of range.
01:01:22.594 - 01:01:39.078, Speaker D: Mattu, we've kept you way over here, but we just have a few more questions that we want to hit you with. One that I was just thinking of is, is there going to be a token with infinity pools? And have you thought through how it will function within the protocol?
01:01:39.174 - 01:02:33.790, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. We've definitely seen what's happened recently with Uniswap and the equity company trying to take a cut, and then the complaints from the token holders is very different as a protocol from uniswap. So I don't want to draw too many parallels because there are a lot more ways to monetize basically both for the equity and for the token. So there is a future where both could receive a fee. Unlike once again, uniswap, we haven't really made any decisions yet on that front. We kind of want to see how it plays out. And, yeah, once again, there's no hurry.
01:02:33.790 - 01:02:49.874, Speaker A: If anything, we really see the token as a mix of a growth lever and a way to govern the protocol when it launches. But, yeah, all I can say, this bias, no decisions have been made.
01:02:49.992 - 01:03:29.034, Speaker C: Well, Mattu, this is a good place for us to start to wrap up. I first want to remind listeners that they should learn more about infinity pools at Infinitypools finance. You can enter your email there, too if you want to get updates on the project, including the anticipated launch, which as of the recording here at the end of October. We're hopeful that it might be live in November December, but we'll find out in just a moment from Metu. Also, you can follow Infinity pools on Twitter. It's in pools. You can follow Mattu.
01:03:29.034 - 01:03:58.186, Speaker C: We'll flash his handle here on screen as well, or you can find it in the show notes. And then metu we'd love to just hear, as a closing to the podcast, what does the roadmap look like for the next, let's say, six to twelve months? Of course. When are we going to see Infinity pools go live? It's currently in this sandbox beta that we've been excited to look through today with you.
01:03:58.288 - 01:04:46.598, Speaker A: So, as I said, yeah, we should be ready with our testnet, honestly, extremely soon. Definitely before the new year. And then we're thinking Q 120 24 for the main net release. There's so many unknown unknowns that I'm still staying pretty vague with my estimates. We've honestly screwed that one up several times, but when you're building a protocol from the ground up like this, that's just never been done before. It's just really hard to give estimates because of all the unknown unknowns. So that's the current plan.
01:04:46.684 - 01:05:34.710, Speaker C: It's going to be an exciting new year. We recently talked with the team at Instadap, and they've got this new protocol, fluid and so between fluid and infinity Pools 2024 could be very fun. Nearly no liquidations on some of the loans they're going to put out are super high LTV and now with Infinity pools, we're looking at no liquidations and also the highest leverage at least I've ever seen, of any defi product out there. But Matu, thank you so much for taking the time to walk us through everything we need to know about infinity pools, and I hope that we can have you back in the future once the product is live, and talk about some of the lessons learned from the new design.
01:05:34.860 - 01:05:41.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I would love that too. It's been great chatting with you guys once again. I really appreciate you guys having me on.
01:05:41.612 - 01:06:06.570, Speaker C: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge Underscore podcast.
