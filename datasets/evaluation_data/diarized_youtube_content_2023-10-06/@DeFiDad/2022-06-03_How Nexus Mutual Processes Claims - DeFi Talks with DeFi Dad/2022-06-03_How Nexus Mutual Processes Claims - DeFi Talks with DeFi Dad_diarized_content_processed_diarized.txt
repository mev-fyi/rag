00:00:03.740 - 00:00:42.670, Speaker A: Hi everyone. You're watching DeFi talks with Defi. Dad. Hey, thanks for joining. It is Thursday, June 2, 2022. Today I am joined by Brave new DFI, who is the marketing lead at Nexus Mutual. I've done lots of interviews and videos previously, but if you're new to Nexus, it's a decentralized alternative to insurance.
00:00:42.670 - 00:00:58.208, Speaker A: We're going to talk mainly today about how claims and payouts work when there's an exploit or any sort of failure within the protocol that qualifies for a payout. And so anyways, brave new DeFi, how are you doing? Thanks for joining me.
00:00:58.374 - 00:01:04.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm doing well. Happy to be here. Always happy to talk about Nexus and all the work that we're.
00:01:06.580 - 00:02:01.350, Speaker A: So. Actually, what prompted this was recently there was an exploit of Rari Capital, and there was, I believe, the largest payout to date. There was almost 5 million for a single cover holder. And then there's actually a few other payouts, I think still coming. But yeah, I think it's a process that deserves a spotlight, just so folks understand what does and does not qualify under protocol cover. And then basically what happens? How does a Dow organize on chain to qualify what is or isn't a payout? And then how have we voted to pay out at this point? We've paid out about 8.1 million in the past three years, which is based on ether being valued at around $1,800 US dollars.
00:02:01.350 - 00:02:38.892, Speaker A: So we've paid out quite a bit. We've paid out more than anyone else to date. And, yeah, kind of excited to dig into that. So, actually, before we get started, though, everybody always identifies with how you got into crypto in the first place. And funny enough, what do I want to say? Your origin story actually has some involvement with me in getting involved with Nexus. So anyways, how did you get involved in crypto in the first place? And then maybe you can talk about how you started working with Nexus.
00:02:39.036 - 00:03:11.084, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think I got started in crypto the same way that everybody gets started in crypto. I had a friend that was talking to me about bitcoin and so we started talking about this. But the way that he framed it was that blockchain technology brings with it a better, more efficient way at scale to store data and transmit data for the long term. And for me, that really clicked with me. And so then I started researching the bitcoin network. I got into the ethereum network, and then once I found DeFi, it was just like, it blew my mind.
00:03:11.084 - 00:04:01.400, Speaker B: So then I got started and was looking at all the different market sectors within Defi, and I came across nexus and looked at kind of this insurance sector and just saw that it's very underserved and that there was just kind of this one team that was working on solving this in a way that I thought was sustainable and could grow considerably. So I started digging in and learning more. And then from there, I read through the docs and noticed that some things were out of date from some governance proposals that were passed. And so I just kind of started making some edits and collected those in a Google Doc. And then I sent those over to Hugh and then I kind of got started just working on the documentation. Yeah. And then from there, my first post was about a bug bounty type service thing that didn't really go anywhere, but I've thought a lot about that recently.
00:04:01.400 - 00:04:38.810, Speaker B: And then I kind of helped build out this model that we use for working groups called the Nexus Hub model. And then I ended up launching the first hub last year in August of 2021. And since then I've been leading the marketing and communications hub and helping do marketing and manage the docs, getting out communication for the mutual. I think like most people in DFI, I do several things within Nexus. But yeah, very active and always trying to answer people's questions as they come through the discord or Telegram on Twitter. I try to be everywhere all at once if I can.
00:04:39.180 - 00:05:23.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I think your origin story too is a testament to just, if you're into something in DFI web three, just find a way to get involved. Think about what's my skill set and how can I add value. And I remember you have a background as a writer. You identified that the documents for Nexus at the time were pretty lacking. And so I remember you stepping up, just talking a bit about where were some of those gaps, and you just reached out too, I think, through, like, that's how we got to know each other. And it's cool to see how you've risen up to now. You're a part of the core team and really a key leader in the community.
00:05:23.430 - 00:05:44.364, Speaker A: Okay, we've talked very briefly about Nexus. Before we do talk about how payouts and claims work, maybe we should level set with what exactly is protocol cover? Like, what does it protect against? And this might also be a good time to share your screen and talk through the git book.
00:05:44.562 - 00:05:52.240, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So let me share here. I will share my window.
00:05:54.740 - 00:05:55.650, Speaker A: All right.
00:05:56.180 - 00:05:57.696, Speaker B: You can see the docs here.
00:05:57.798 - 00:05:59.408, Speaker A: Yes. Good to go? Yeah.
00:05:59.494 - 00:06:29.048, Speaker B: Okay, well, let's look through protocol cover. So if you go in the docs here from the top down, there's the overview and the facts and everything. And if you scroll down to Nexus fundamentals, you can find the types of COVID section. And then here we have an entry on protocol cover talking about what is covered. I'll dive right into the language as well. But we also have the annotated protocol cover wording that I've worked on. I still have some edits here that I want to make, but I have the annotations here.
00:06:29.048 - 00:06:39.260, Speaker B: And then you can scroll down, drop down this menu, and there's more like an expanded view of what these things that are covered and how they got to be that way.
00:06:39.410 - 00:07:35.824, Speaker A: So that's a great one word that we use in the mutual is cover, to clarify. And again, I think cover is obviously, it is a more specific and appropriate word to describe how this works. But to drop that for a moment, the TLDR is, I think about this almost like car insurance, except with car insurance I have to buy six months or more at a time. And in this case I can buy cover for a minimum of 30 days. So like for example, I hold a position in Ave most days and hopefully I can continue to hold it with the way the markets are. And so what I'll do is I'll buy a minimum of 30 days of COVID And then I know that if there's an exploit of Ave, I've got an assured payout and I base that on the amount of ether or die. I can choose the payout either way.
00:07:35.824 - 00:08:26.736, Speaker A: Some prefer that they would get a payout in ether, some prefer that they would get it in a stable coin, being dai. And so it's also very important that I cover what I actually could lose. So if I bought a million dollars of COVID I don't have a million dollars. I wish I did in Ave, but if there were an exploit and I was holding a million dollars of COVID and I don't have that amount of money in there, then I'm not going to qualify for a million dollar payout, which is a little bit more like a prediction market. So anyways, this is truly designed to provide protection and payout against actual value that you have deposited in a protocol controlled by your own wallet that could be potentially lost to some unforeseeable event. Okay.
00:08:26.838 - 00:08:31.330, Speaker B: Yeah. So with protocol cover, and you can see the COVID wording on my screen, correct?
00:08:32.180 - 00:08:34.300, Speaker A: That is right, yes, I can see it in plain English?
00:08:34.380 - 00:09:13.208, Speaker B: Yes, perfect. So we have the plain english overview, which is that claims should be paid when users of the protocol suffer material financial losses due to failures, neither the protocol code, economic design, governance setup, or oracles. I'll go through some of the wording and talk about some of this as well. But important to note that coverage from Nexus mutual is not insurance. We are a discretionary mutual where members share risk with one another and members can stake NXM and participate in claims assessment. We'll talk about claims assessment in a little bit, but because it is cover, it is paid out on a discretionary basis. There's a very secure design behind claims assessment.
00:09:13.208 - 00:10:03.856, Speaker B: And again, we'll talk about that in a bit. But first, let's go over some of the protections in the COVID wording, and I can talk a bit about how this has evolved from the initial smart contract coverage that we launched with in 2019. So protocol cover was drafted and shared among members. It went through a couple of iterations and then it was voted on through governance and launched in April of 2021. So it has the most comprehensive coverage available that you can get in DFI, and it protects assets on EVM compatible chains. So if you're deploying funds in AAVE and it's AavE on Polygon, or maybe it's aave on Avalanche or Mainnet, if you buy a protocol COVID policy, you can cover those assets that are deposited in AAVE. So the different wording we have in here, so we have code being used in an unintended way.
00:10:03.856 - 00:11:21.432, Speaker B: And in this instance, before, it was limited to bugs within a smart contract system that didn't capture certain outlier events like reentercy attacks, which we recently covered for the Rari exploit. So because it was a little bit more limiting, we went and reviewed this when we were drafting the protocol cover wording, and we wanted to expand that coverage to reflect the risks that were in the market. One thing that we're always doing within the mutual is having discussions on what risks are emerging and how can we cover those things so that broader cover wording reflects that, so we can capture more kinds of risk. So code being used in an unintended way that leads to an exploit or a hack economic design failure resulting in the unintended confiscation or seizure of funds deposited into the designated protocol for either collateral liquidity provision or staking purposes only. So in this sense, this provision was designed specifically to cover events like the Makerdao Black Thursday event where the actual code didn't fail. But what was able to happen, because few people were participating in the keeper liquidations, was that people could submit zero die bids and win which created bad debt within the system. So at the time, this wasn't covered with smart contract cover wording, and that wasn't a covered event.
00:11:21.432 - 00:11:53.888, Speaker B: But we looked at that, and when we were reevaluating things, we thought this should be something that's protected, because sometimes the failure isn't actually in the code, but in the design of the system. Since then, this provision has protected partially for the cream exploit that happened in October 2021. And then with the perpetual protocol claims that we've paid out. So we've paid out one so far. There's another one that should be paid out in a couple of hours today that has consensus among claims assessors and then severe.
00:11:53.984 - 00:12:51.572, Speaker A: I think also, it's worth pointing out here, too, that's a good example of the way that protocol cover evolved. The community at the time when the maker collapse happened, whatever you want to call it now, it was very clear that we didn't cover it, the policy did not cover it. And the way that cover works, you stake NXM, which like most of us have, unless you bought WNXM and unwrapped it, most of us put ether in to the capital pool. And then you stake this NXM, which you can stake with leverage up to 20 x against different protocols. And as you stake it, there's an understanding. It's two sides. You've got those buying cover with an understanding of what's protected, and then there's those of us who are putting up ether to protect them.
00:12:51.572 - 00:13:38.704, Speaker A: And, yeah, I think this was a really good example of, like, the community wants to cover any of these unexpected sorts of events. The question is they should be events that are, of course, probabilistically less likely to happen. And so, yeah, that sort of comprehensive coverage, though, is definitely a lifesaver for quite a few events now that we've been able to pay out, including cream. And then technically, if something like that maker event happened again in the future now, and you held this cover, there would be a full payout on that. It would just clearly qualify. But anyway, sorry, I interrupted you there. So you want to next bullet?
00:13:38.832 - 00:14:05.208, Speaker B: Yeah. And then we have severe oracle failure, or when the Oracle price is manipulated that causes liquidations or has some loss event that it affects. Of course, in 2020. Right. When Ave first came out with the flash loan, no one had protection against these type of attacks. And this was incredibly common. We still see flash loans as a major attack factor that leads to losses within defi.
00:14:05.208 - 00:14:33.888, Speaker B: So this protection is really important. It wasn't included before, and it was added in because that's the way that risk in the market was evolving. And that's something that members agreed upon that we should be covering this risk. So that's a big protection. And then we have governance attacks. So to date, there hasn't been a claim where there's been a governance attack, but we've seen a couple of notable ones. There was the build finance governance attack where somebody voted and took over the treasury and the contracts and was able to steal funds.
00:14:33.888 - 00:15:04.652, Speaker B: And then I think the most notable one that's happened recently is the Beanstalk exploit that happened where it was a governance attack where they essentially did the same thing. They were able to take over and remove funds. So I think as time goes on, that governance attacks will likely become more prominent. It's just about getting the votes and then passing them through kind of under the radar in order to take over the contracts of the treasury. So that's something that we cover as well. And of course, we cover things that are on other chains. And then.
00:15:04.652 - 00:15:12.700, Speaker B: Yeah, really quickly, I can just scan through some of the exceptions because I think it's just as important to talk about what we don't cover and why we're not able to cover those risks.
00:15:12.780 - 00:15:13.410, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:13.880 - 00:16:05.830, Speaker B: So if we go down to the exclusions, you can see like six is anything that's due to phishing, private key security breaches, anything where your wallet is compromised and funds are taken out of your wallet. The reason we can't cover this particular risk is that a claim assessor cannot verify whether or not a claim is legitimate because somebody can just transfer funds to another wallet and say that their wallet was compromised. Pretty much anything that we can't cover is something that we can't verify whether or not it's a legitimate claim. We can't cover rug pulls for the same reason, because somebody could execute a rug pull, which is kind of more of social engineering, and then buy cover and then file a claim. There's no way for us to determine whether or not the person filing the claim is the same person that executed the rug pull.
00:16:06.840 - 00:16:39.084, Speaker A: Simply, it has to be provable on chain with cryptographic evidence. I think Badger would be a good example where there was a front end attack. And so that goes beyond what's happening on chain. And so the origin of that attack isn't possible for us to prove out. And that's why we don't protect against that. It goes beyond the confines of what's provable based on the way our, I guess, cover works today.
00:16:39.202 - 00:17:01.568, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And one of the things too, with front end exploits like what happened with Badger, it was very unfortunate. I really commend the badger team on how they responded to that attack. But it was a signing attack. So if you signed that transaction, if you didn't, you were fine. But if you signed it and approved it, you signed a malicious contract or address that was able to remove funds from your wallet because you granted permission.
00:17:01.568 - 00:17:23.288, Speaker B: So this is something that's the reason why I use a grid plus is to avoid those types of things. I tag the contracts that I'm approving so that I can kind of reduce that attack vector. But with that specifically, unlike the back end. Right. The protocol itself, the smart contracts where it's auditable, you can look at it, it's fully open source. Most front ends aren't open source. They're not decentralized.
00:17:23.288 - 00:18:05.370, Speaker B: And there is no audit of the front end. So there's no way for us to review and see how much risk is with any given front end. Not to mention the fact that if you look at different protocols like uniswap where there's multiple front ends, for Uniswap, there's the official one, but there's also community hosted front ends. And there could also be the malicious ones that we always see on Google Ads which for some reason these other aggregators don't get rid of. So somebody can throw up a front end that's not the official one. But I think that's something over time that we'd like to cover and maybe that we can kind of work on expanding decentralized front ends, having an auditing standard and have it be something that can be reviewed. So that this is a risk that we could potentially cover in the future.
00:18:06.060 - 00:18:34.124, Speaker A: Absolutely. So then is the appropriate term. I'm forgetting it now. Is it risk assessing or claims assessing? How does that next step work? Let's assume that there's been an exploit. Actually, I'll give an example. Rari's exploit had happened. What happened next? Then on our end, in order to start to assess what's going on, this is actually prior to a claim even being submitted.
00:18:34.252 - 00:19:15.856, Speaker B: Yeah. So if we go to the claims history and we go to the Rari capital fuse market exploit, you can kind of look through, we can see how much has been paid out for this particular loss event. But then I have an overview here where we talk about what happened. Right? So after this exploit occurred, claims assessors discussed this loss event in the mutual's discord server. When these exploits happen, there's a three day cooldown period that occurs before people can file claims. This cooldown period is there so that we can look at analysis. A lot of times a post mortem isn't available even after the three days, but there's been enough analysis from people in the community to look at what happened.
00:19:15.856 - 00:19:47.720, Speaker B: And with the rarity exploit, we had a lot of analysis right up front. It was a reentrancy attack. There were multiple sources. What I tend to try to do is collect all of that and have it in one thread once somebody files a claim so that it's kind of all in one spot on Twitter. Sometimes there's a lot of disparate information. And so I try to collect that and provide that for claims assessors and include that in the claims discussions channel in discord. So people will have that discussion, talk about what happened, talk about if it's covered or not, and then in this case it was.
00:19:47.720 - 00:20:24.452, Speaker B: Then we talk about reviewing individual claims. And so here I've got, here's what happened. It's covered under this section of COVID wording, which is code being used in an unintended way because that covers range attacks. Then we've got the statement for claims assessors with instructions on how to file a claim and information about active COVID policies. So I try to put those together in a Google sheet so that people can kind of track those more seamlessly. You can also look in the Dapp as well as directly on chain if you'd like. And from there we just kind of go through and look at claims as they come in.
00:20:24.452 - 00:20:44.364, Speaker B: And so filed claims and outcomes. I've got a summary of that, too. Right. So two claims were filed for Rari. I think maybe two or three. So maybe that needs to be updated. But with this specifically, if we're looking at this is did they have a policy during the time of the exploit? Right.
00:20:44.364 - 00:21:37.580, Speaker B: Did they have one before? Did they buy one after? Did they provide proof of loss? Did they provide an affected address where we can go and check directly on chain? Did they have money in a fuse market that was affected? Luckily, Rari came out with this very detailed post mortem that had the affected addresses and the amounts that they had lost. So that was something that we used in risk assessment as well. And then did the COVID holder lose 20% or more of the covered account or the covered amount? So right now we're not able to process partial claims. When claims assessors vote, it's a yes, this is covered or no, this is not covered. And if we say, yes, it is covered, then we're going to pay out that full claim amount. Partial claims are coming in nexus fee too. But until then we have that 20% threshold to maintain that we can pay out claims where there's been a genuine loss.
00:21:37.580 - 00:22:12.250, Speaker B: In this particular, not in this event, but in the cream exploit, someone had a very large COVID policy and we couldn't cover them under the COVID wording because it was like, I think, 2% of their total policy. But then the community put up a vote and we used our discretion to pay out the genuine loss, which is around ten e from the community fund, because we felt that there was a genuine loss. They had a protocol COVID policy before they had funds in there, and we wanted to compensate that member for their loss. So we used the discretion in a positive way.
00:22:13.020 - 00:23:06.810, Speaker A: This is part of the reason too, that Hugh Karp, the founder of, I mean, he can talk circles around, know insurance is not a new industry. Obviously, it's literally hundreds of years old. And so there's a lot of lessons and guidelines that are derived from that legacy industry. But we're also sort of in a new wild west space because of just the newness of DeFi and crypto. So this is one of the things I really like as an NXM holder is I know what strict guidelines are there. I know how to vote strictly based on that. But then we have had a few exceptions here where I'm happy that in that case we voted to cover someone that was a pretty substantial loss for that individual.
00:23:06.810 - 00:24:09.628, Speaker A: And yeah, it also too informs, of course, how we update protocol cover and some other types of COVID like yield token cover, which just continue to evolve. So at a high level, then we've got an exploit happens 72 hours later, folks can start to file claims who had active cover. Those folks, once they file the claim, I can speak to, like, there's quite a bit of conversation that happens in discord because the Dow, like many other dows, centers around a lot of discussions within discord. And then after, there's a lot of digging into the smart contracts, verifying cryptographically, like, did this person actually lose X amount? Do they own the wallet address? And so on. Eventually this gets put up for a vote. And that's where you're voting with your actual NXM. And there is, I guess, sorry, I might have missed this.
00:24:09.628 - 00:24:32.468, Speaker A: Did we highlight the fact that when you vote, there is an incentive to vote what is truthfully the correct vote based on the evidence in front of you? Someone could maliciously try to vote for or against something, against what they know to be true and in that case, there is like an actual penalty, right?
00:24:32.634 - 00:25:13.632, Speaker B: There is, yeah. So let's talk a little bit about how claims assessment works in the first place. The system itself is designed a lot like an optimistic oracle. So in that sense, it's more costly to attack the system than any value that could be gained or preserved. This is really important, too, going back to in risk assessment, people stake and share risk with one another when they're underwriting COVID policies. So any one COVID policy likely has limited exposure for any individual participating in risk assessment. But if somebody were to try to attack the system, we can see here that the voting period lasts for a minimum of 36 hours if there is staking of ten times the COVID amount.
00:25:13.632 - 00:25:49.020, Speaker B: Right. So if there's a million dollar claim, at least 10 million or greater in stake, like NXM, staking for claims assessment has voted or 72 hours have passed. So we need that and then that'll end it in 36 if there's ten times the COVID amount. If not, it's 72 hours. And we're currently on that window for one of the perpetual protocol claims. But the minimum is having voting consensus that's at or above 70%. So 70% in agreement on an outcome and having the voting weight of five times the COVID amount.
00:25:49.020 - 00:26:37.580, Speaker B: So if you have a $1 million claim and someone's trying to deny that claim, there needs to be $5 million of NXM staked in voting weight, and 70% would need to vote against a legitimate claim or for an illegitimate claim to try to fraudulently push something through or deny something. So in this case, you have to put $3.5 million on the line to save a million. And in that sense, you likely only have staked against that million, a fraction of that. So it's more costly to attack that system because the advisory board has the power to burn that NXM stake. This has happened once in the past, so that's something that people risk having if there is an exploit.
00:26:38.960 - 00:26:53.936, Speaker A: Super helpful. Yeah, that's what I mean. The economics behind it, you are incentivized to basically vote in the best interest of the protocol. And those who hold that active cover, there's also two.
00:26:53.958 - 00:26:58.316, Speaker B: I was going to say, let me just grab my charger really quick and plug that in so my computer doesn't die.
00:26:58.348 - 00:26:59.392, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, go right ahead.
00:26:59.446 - 00:26:59.856, Speaker B: Once.
00:26:59.958 - 00:27:01.250, Speaker A: Take your time. Yes.
00:27:04.980 - 00:27:05.730, Speaker B: All.
00:27:24.720 - 00:27:35.490, Speaker A: We go. We've all been there. You're like watching the battery run down. You're like, am I going to finish this interview before the battery runs out?
00:27:36.100 - 00:27:36.928, Speaker B: All right. Okay.
00:27:37.014 - 00:27:37.552, Speaker A: Cool.
00:27:37.686 - 00:27:38.480, Speaker B: Cris.
00:27:39.540 - 00:27:54.250, Speaker A: Yes. I was just saying, I was like, we've all been there where you're watching the battery run down and you're like, am I going to finish this on time? Sorry. Brave new defi. Would you like me to reshare that getbook screen, or can we just talk through this?
00:27:56.940 - 00:28:00.088, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we can just talk through this.
00:28:00.174 - 00:28:00.520, Speaker A: Cool.
00:28:00.590 - 00:28:27.970, Speaker B: At this point. But, yeah, you can look directly in the Nexus docs. So if you go to nexusmutual IO and go over to docs, that'll open up our gitbook. There's lots of information there, how to buy a COVID policy, how to file a claim, types of COVID You can review all of the COVID products. There's quite a bit of information in our documentation. And if you have any questions, you can just jump into the discord or the telegram and ask those. You can tag me too, and I'm happy to answer, absolutely.
00:28:29.800 - 00:28:46.868, Speaker A: I feel like we've nearly covered everything. Is there anything else in that process of the actual payout? I guess we could highlight, ultimately, once those votes come in, then how does the payout happen? How does that get dispersed from the capital pool?
00:28:47.044 - 00:29:28.196, Speaker B: Yeah. So in the sense of the 72 hours passes, you have the majority approving at that point. After that 72 hours ends from the capital pool, NXM and risk assessment is burned. And then that facilitates a claim payout, which goes to the member's address. So then that member receives that claim, it's paid out automatically at the end of that 72 hours cover period after claims assessment goes through, and then that member gets the payout and they're made whole for their loss. So it's a relatively simple process. I have very detailed documentation on how to file a claim and how to go through the process.
00:29:28.196 - 00:30:12.772, Speaker B: What ends up happening is you go through, you file a claim, you provide proof of loss that's hashed on IPFs. Claims assessors can review that. You can upload screenshots and include a description. And then you're going to, when you're providing proof of loss, either sign a transaction from your affected wallet or you're going to send a zero value transaction just to prove ownership over that wallet. And then claims assessors will review that wallet's history to determine proof of loss directly on chain. The first time I assessed a claim, it took me like five minutes. And again, it just kind of blew my mind at how quick that was, because if anyone's ever had to deal with a traditional insurance company, it takes much longer than that.
00:30:12.772 - 00:30:54.044, Speaker B: It takes a lot of submitting evidence and going back and forth to finally get something. And then once you get it, I feel as though you're almost made to feel bad that you got to pay out in the first place. So our process is very simplified, and because we use human claims assessors, right, we use human oracles, we can cover other kinds of risks. So the development team is working on Nexus V two right now. And one of the things that we can expand to once V two goes live is a lot of things, but we can start to cover real world risk, things like liability. We've been working with planner Dow. They're working on the DFI toolkit for financial advisors.
00:30:54.044 - 00:31:37.356, Speaker B: And with that they're going to be buying coverage from the mutual to cover their positions in a certain predetermined number of protocols. And then in the future, what we're hoping to do through a syndicate is offer Arizona omissions coverage, which is a kind of liability coverage for financial advisors. Now it would be hard to do something because that would be triggered if there was litigation happening. And so that evidence would have to be defined and filed. COVID policy would have to be drafted up and approved by members. But with that, if we are able to provide eno coverage for financial advisors, it would help bring more money on chain. So the way I see Nexus evolving is we can cover other kinds of risk.
00:31:37.356 - 00:32:20.588, Speaker B: Traditional insurance can probably offload some risk, and we can act as like reinsurance as a service. We can start to have integrations with major protocols like AavE and balancer or whoever wants to have an integration. And with that, these protocols can actually earn a commission when people are buying cover through their front end. And you can buy cover on Ave or any of these protocols without actually leaving their front end, without leaving their UI. And you can buy cover directly at the point where you're depositing funds. So V two is a very powerful model. It's still no date TBD on launch, but man, the minute I know I'm going to tell everybody, it'll be everywhere soon.
00:32:20.674 - 00:33:45.940, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely addresses some improvements to being able to distribute nexus cover through like a syndicate model, which hearkens to, if anyone's familiar with Lloyds of London, it'll be a lot more familiar to that legacy setup and then it really know takes some of the complexity out of topping up cover. Normally every few months I'm buying a new policy when really I could just continue to hold that policy for a certain amount and just top it up anyways. Yeah, we'll be really excited and interested to see that as well as like partial payouts as well, which is definitely needed. And then one last note in terms of if you're interested to learn more about all of this, obviously you can go to nexusmutual Gitbook IO docs or go to nexusmutual IO. I also would highly recommend the Nexus mutual tracker, which is really interesting to show because you can start to just see how much cover is out there, how much ether is in the capital pool. It's cool, like per usual in DeFi, that everything is instantly auditable. And so the capital pool being made up mostly of ether.
00:33:45.940 - 00:34:06.460, Speaker A: You can check that out. You can see active cover based on USD versus ether. Yeah, there's a lot of growth happening. And I know this past week we sold about 71 million in new active cover, which is that a record new week. What's the most we've ever sold in a single week?
00:34:06.530 - 00:34:41.400, Speaker B: Oh, I know that we've sold 100 plus before, 100 million plus in a week and everything. But as far as cover buys, largest cover buy to date is 20,335 E as an enzyme cover buy. That happened just last week, Celsius X. So the DFI arm of the custodian, Celsius, bought that COVID policy that broke the previous record that they set when they bought a COVID policy for roughly 18,000 E in February. So we're seeing a lot of record cover buys come through record claim payouts. The system that we have is working. We're seeing a lot of growth in cover sales.
00:34:41.400 - 00:35:13.012, Speaker B: Even in the down market. We're still seeing consistent cover buys for people protecting their productive crypto assets deployed across deFi. And then we have custody cover as well. So seeing a lot of people protecting their assets on places like, you know, binance, Coinbase. So there's a variety of different covers coming through. But some of the majorities that we see coming through Ave is always popular curve convex. The MIm curve pool we have yield token cover for.
00:35:13.012 - 00:35:17.220, Speaker B: So we see a lot of consistent cover buys coming through for those as well.
00:35:17.370 - 00:35:57.312, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say the secret, that's really not a secret. But if you're new, if you buy WNXM from the open market and you follow there's directions in the discord, you unwrap it to NXM, and then you pay with that because of an ARB opportunity there you can end up. I've paid as little as, I think, 0.5% as a premium, I think. I'm not quite sure based on the price of it today, but the lowest premium is currently 2.6% annually for cover also. That's something, too.
00:35:57.312 - 00:36:15.144, Speaker A: We won't talk about it today, but there's a change there that's coming with Nexus fee, too, which is really exciting. So different ways to price that cover versus this bottom line price of 2.6% annually, even despite the hack of being able to use WNXM and unwrap it.
00:36:15.262 - 00:36:58.996, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's also important to note that we do have a working group that's looking at tokenomics and looking kind of a redesign of the bonding curve and how people can enter and exit the mutual to give people the ability to exit as well. So there's been a lot of work going into that as well. So it takes a little bit of time to make sure that it's secure and it's scalable and that we can plan for these different scenarios. But there's a lot of work being done there as well. And Dopey or Jack is kind of leading that working group. So anybody that's interested that wants to get involved there, just jump in discord and tag dopey and ask about getting involved. So there's a lot of members contributing to that working group.
00:36:59.178 - 00:37:48.800, Speaker A: He definitely, having met Jack in person, he doesn't look like a, a pretty tall person, doesn't look like the little turtle avatar I expected him to look like. Well, brave new Defi, thank you so much for being really generous with your time today here. And yeah, I'm glad we were able to dig through some of these topics, which I think, again, are the less sexy topics around nexus that don't get discussed as much. But this is why I always hold cover. This is also why actually, we at fourth Revolution Capital have held cover to protect assets in the fund. And I know lots of other funds, obviously, that use Nexus to protect their assets. And for anyone, again, who's interested to learn more, you can follow Nexus Mutual on Twitter.
00:37:48.800 - 00:38:13.310, Speaker A: You can also check out the documents here at nexusmutual IO, which is in their gitbook. And then if you enjoyed this, please subscribe@dfid.com. We'll continue to interview builders, founders, investors, Dow contributors, anyone who's building something cool in the web. Three D five space. Lee, anything else before we go?
00:38:14.000 - 00:38:50.730, Speaker B: No, I think the only thing I'd like to say is, if you want to know more, too, just jump in the discord and ask questions. There's a lot of people who are active, but I will say that I am very excited for a lot of the things coming for Nexus with some of our Dow scaling initiatives with Nexus V two, with redesign of the bonding curve and tokenomics. There is despite what people might say, there is a lot happening within the mutual and we are working to onboard the next wave of institutional and retail capital into DFI and allowing people to protect their assets so we can protect more users in DFI as well.
00:38:51.260 - 00:39:32.420, Speaker A: Absolutely. And then per usual, one last reminder. None of this should be a recommendation or endorsement to buy any tokens we discussed, including NXM, which I'm a holder of as a member of Nexus Mutual going back to 2019. So none of this should be interpreted as financial advice. But as a DFI nerd, it's been a privilege the last few years, like just watching the focus and evolution of Nexus. So I hope folks get more interested and there's a lot there to learn, not just from you, but Hugh is just a savage founder. He's one of the most focused people in all of web three.
00:39:32.420 - 00:39:41.650, Speaker A: So just continue to really enjoy getting to learn so much from all of you. So anyways, everyone have a great day. We'll see you next time. Take care.
