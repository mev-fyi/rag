00:00:00.490 - 00:00:02.286, Speaker A: And so we had this staking fund.
00:00:02.468 - 00:00:04.522, Speaker B: And as part of that, we evaluated.
00:00:04.586 - 00:00:08.826, Speaker A: A lot of the other options that were available. Of course, centralized staking. We looked at some of the DeFi.
00:00:08.858 - 00:00:21.710, Speaker B: Protocols, so we wanted a product that actually made sense. We wanted a product that we ourselves would actually use and a non negotiable criteria. There was self custody. We wanted a product where we would have the keys.
00:00:25.370 - 00:01:10.046, Speaker C: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad from Fourth Revolution Capital, and I'm here with my co host and colleague from four RC nomadic. Today's show is a quick hit where we spotlight new and trending DFI projects and teams. Our goal is to produce these when new opportunities in DFI reveal themselves, so that you might gain some edge on your peers. Now, if you listen to the Edge podcast regularly, you may have heard previous episodes covering LSTs or liquid staking tokens like Rocket Pool and LSTFi like Gravita. In this episode, we'll review a newer ETH liquid staking protocol called Ether Phi. As of this recording, ether Fi is the only liquid staking protocol where stakers keep control of their keys while delegating staking to node operators and earning rewards.
00:01:10.046 - 00:02:12.870, Speaker C: We'll also cover how Etherfi has created a fun way to stake your ether called Ether fan, where you mint a provably rare NFT that you can use to earn membership points and get boosted staking rewards. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the Edge podcast possible at Origin protocol, DFI is an art form. Origin invented the yield bearing stablecoin in 2020 with OUSD delivering boosted stablecoin yield with unparalleled usability, no lockups, no wastage, no guesswork. Using Ousd's battletested code, origin launched oeth. Oeth is a liquid staking yield aggregator backed by ETH and LSTs. Swap for oeth with rocket Pool's r ETH, Lido's Steth, Frax's FRx ETH, or ETH, to earn top yield on ether with a 30 day trailing Apy more than twice that of Steph. With Origin's best in class yield strategies, Oeth holders enjoy the best ETH yield in DFI, deposit any supported LST mint Oeth and earn automatically with yield delivered directly to your wallet.

00:04:47.130 - 00:05:47.974, Speaker C: Adam, have I ever told you about my first time home buying experience? This was years ago, when my wife and I lived in the Bay Area. Prices for single family homes were going up, and we were just trying to scrape together whatever we could for a down payment. But it wasn't long before we realized we had been priced out of buying in our own neighborhood. Now, the most frustrating part of this story is that we knew prices were going up, and yet there was nothing we could do to benefit from it. If I could have been long real estate prices in my region, then at least we could have participated in the market upside with even a lesser amount of money to invest. So when I stumbled upon parcel, I immediately recognized a solution for many of us who have been locked out of real estate markets and looking for an alternative way to get exposure. Parcel is a decentralized perps amm, where I can long or short real estate synthetics based on the median price per square foot in some of the most sought after cities in the world, meaning I can get exposure to real estate markets like Boston, Washington, DC and Chicago.
00:05:47.974 - 00:06:51.038, Speaker C: For example, if I had Parcel years ago and I was bullish on real estate prices in San Francisco, I could have longed Parcel's San Francisco index with a minimum of one USDC. Or if I had just bought a home and wanted to hedge against the price of our home crashing, I could have shorted the same real estate index. To learn more about Parcel, go to Parcel CC Edge all right, in just a moment, we'll introduce Mike C. Lagadza, the founder and CEO of ether Phi. In 2009, he founded Top Hat, an engagement platform for educators and institutions to deliver interactive and personalized learning, which he grew to over 500 employees before exiting to a private equity firm. He has been an angel investor for over ten years and a venture partner at Ripple Ventures since 2021, no relation to Ripple, the blockchain or XRP. In October 2022, he founded Ether Phi, which we'll talk all about here today.
00:06:51.038 - 00:06:55.042, Speaker C: So let's kick it off. Michael, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:06:55.176 - 00:06:56.674, Speaker B: Great. Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:06:56.712 - 00:06:58.370, Speaker A: Excited to talk about everything.
00:06:58.520 - 00:07:44.006, Speaker C: We've been meeting and interviewing lots of LSTFI founders lately, like Gravita was one. And depending on when folks listen to this in the future, there will be an upcoming episode on Prisma. So anyways, really excited to get to learn more about a newer LST protocol for ETH and just understand how it differentiates from other LST protocols. But Mike, you have a really interesting background. I want to note that you were already very successful by any sort of measure with top hat. And so how did you end up in crypto or web3? Was it something you got into while you were building top hat? And then I would love to talk more about what prompted you to build ether phi.
00:07:44.138 - 00:08:00.158, Speaker A: Yeah, so I actually got into crypto fairly early on. I bought my first bitcoin back in 2011. This was before there were even any exchanges at the time. I just PayPal a guy on an Internet forum, $20 and he sent me.
00:08:00.184 - 00:08:02.278, Speaker B: 20 bitcoins and I thought, hey, this.
00:08:02.284 - 00:08:13.286, Speaker A: Is kind of cool. So I played around with mining and did a bunch of other random stuff kind of in parallel to working on top hat. And I was passionate about the crypto.
00:08:13.318 - 00:08:15.414, Speaker B: Space from the beginning, preaching the choir.
00:08:15.462 - 00:08:33.502, Speaker A: Here, self sovereign money, the ability to create a truly decentralized financial system was at least exciting, kind of as a prospect. But for the first, let's call it, ten years of crypto's existence, it really.
00:08:33.556 - 00:08:39.278, Speaker B: Wasn'T much more than a global, decentralized casino. I think, if we're being honest, that's.
00:08:39.294 - 00:08:43.090, Speaker A: Pretty much still what it is, 95% of it, at least.
00:08:43.240 - 00:08:44.626, Speaker B: And that wasn't something that I was.
00:08:44.648 - 00:08:57.394, Speaker A: Particularly excited to work on. I mean, there's lots of gambling sites out there. I didn't want to build another one. But what got me really excited about crypto as an actual product and vehicle.
00:08:57.522 - 00:09:06.826, Speaker B: For change was the emergence of DFI. So around 2019 2020, when the first few protocols started to get launched, I.
00:09:06.848 - 00:09:10.414, Speaker A: Saw that as kind of like the moment of crypto. In other words, it wasn't just people.
00:09:10.452 - 00:09:29.346, Speaker B: Gambling on one token or another. It was people actually building products, like actual software on the blockchain that made things possible that were not previously possible. And that was actually a big part of my motivation for exiting from top hat and wanted to switch gears to.
00:09:29.368 - 00:09:31.106, Speaker A: Focus on crypto full time, because I.
00:09:31.128 - 00:09:41.238, Speaker B: Felt that this transformation, where smart contract platforms would become the value settlement layer of the world, is arguably one of.
00:09:41.244 - 00:09:51.594, Speaker A: The most significant things to happen in my lifetime. And so I felt like I had to be part of that. There wasn't anything else that I thought could be more important or that I was more excited about working on.
00:09:51.712 - 00:10:36.982, Speaker C: When I got into the space, it was only 2017. It feels like a longer time ago now, but still, I feel like a crypto newbie in comparison to you. And I thought it was a difficult choice for me to get into crypto just because we had really young kids or we had our first child. So our first child, I think, was about one year old. But then I hear stories like this where you've built a tech company that's got about 500 plus folks, and it's really a sign to me of how bright the future is with crypto. I would say specifically defi, because we just continue to see the smartest people in the world pile in.
00:10:37.036 - 00:10:42.886, Speaker A: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I mean, I think the amount of talent density in crypto is pretty extreme.
00:10:42.998 - 00:10:47.674, Speaker B: And the so called bear market, by.
00:10:47.712 - 00:10:55.680, Speaker A: Any measure, I don't know that I'd call what we're in a bear market, but that has only actually served to.
00:10:56.290 - 00:10:58.542, Speaker B: Further concentrate the level of talent, because.
00:10:58.596 - 00:11:13.234, Speaker A: A lot of the speculators and gamblers are kind of getting washed out en masse. So I think that bodes really well for the space that there's just a ton of really smart, passionate people building in it.
00:11:13.352 - 00:11:53.534, Speaker C: Before we talk about Ether fi, can we also cover what drew you specifically into the Ethereum community? Because I will say you feel like someone I've met already. In fact, when we first got on the call, I thought maybe there was some sort of common connection there. But I do recognize there is a warmth among a lot of builders within Ethereum, and I'll say specifically those that work on the more mission driven, larger addressable, market type projects like LSTs. So anyways, yeah, anything about that you can share that really drew you in?
00:11:53.732 - 00:11:55.098, Speaker B: It's hard for me to talk about.
00:11:55.124 - 00:11:56.786, Speaker A: This because I always end up going.
00:11:56.808 - 00:11:59.022, Speaker B: Down the path of criticizing other communities.
00:11:59.086 - 00:12:00.580, Speaker A: And I don't want to do that.
00:12:01.270 - 00:12:03.982, Speaker B: But it was not a hard choice.
00:12:04.046 - 00:12:08.454, Speaker A: I guess when I looked at whether.
00:12:08.492 - 00:12:11.298, Speaker B: We'Re talking about different smart contract platforms.
00:12:11.474 - 00:12:16.806, Speaker A: Blockchains, or the OG bitcoin community, it.
00:12:16.828 - 00:12:18.102, Speaker B: Was not a hard choice.
00:12:18.246 - 00:12:27.850, Speaker A: It was just pretty obvious that Ethereum was in some ways the safe bet. So that seems in fact more so.
00:12:27.920 - 00:12:29.146, Speaker B: Now the safe bet.
00:12:29.248 - 00:12:31.322, Speaker A: I would say that a year ago.
00:12:31.376 - 00:12:36.926, Speaker B: Two years ago, there were a lot of contenders and one could have argued technical merits of one versus the other. But in the end, I think the.
00:12:36.948 - 00:12:38.782, Speaker A: Community is what really won out.
00:12:38.836 - 00:12:53.700, Speaker B: I mean, the Ethereum community, the Ethereum foundation, as stewards, are consistently making the right choices for the long term rather than optimizing for a short term token pump, for lack of a better word.
00:12:55.450 - 00:13:21.290, Speaker A: The builders and the community around the space is what made it a pretty easy decision to focus on Ethereum. So Etherfi, we're not doing staking on any other chains. We're not planning to do staking on any other chains. I think Ethereum is going to have 90 plus percent of the market and it's going to continue to have that market share. And so it's just kind of obvious to build here.
00:13:21.360 - 00:13:37.282, Speaker F: Mike, let's talk a bit about why you set out to build ether phi. We were talking a bit about this offline and I think it's a cool story to tell and a very organic path to you starting. So maybe give our listeners some background on that.
00:13:37.336 - 00:13:41.278, Speaker B: It's not the only founding story, but some of the more successful founding stories.
00:13:41.454 - 00:13:49.942, Speaker A: That work out well are ones where the founders solving their own problem rather than just going kind of as a tourist into some other kind of random space.
00:13:49.996 - 00:13:52.934, Speaker B: And so for us, for me, when.
00:13:52.972 - 00:13:56.182, Speaker A: I first pivoted and decided to focus.
00:13:56.236 - 00:14:00.378, Speaker B: Full time on crypto and Defi. The way we actually got started in.
00:14:00.384 - 00:14:05.526, Speaker A: The space was by starting a hedge fund, which we're still operating.
00:14:05.638 - 00:14:09.980, Speaker B: And one of the funds that we run is a staking fund.
00:14:10.750 - 00:14:11.834, Speaker A: There were a number of reasons why.
00:14:11.872 - 00:14:13.286, Speaker B: We chose to start as a fund.
00:14:13.328 - 00:14:18.510, Speaker A: Honestly, it was just the easiest way to go. There was a lot of capital around.
00:14:18.580 - 00:14:20.314, Speaker B: I had some capital I needed to deploy.
00:14:20.362 - 00:14:25.326, Speaker A: So it was just kind of straightforward path to start building in crypto.
00:14:25.358 - 00:14:27.314, Speaker B: But the plan from day one was.
00:14:27.352 - 00:14:37.138, Speaker A: To start a fund and use that as a way to build both product, because that's what, ultimately, I'm passionate about. And so we had this staking fund.
00:14:37.304 - 00:14:44.920, Speaker B: And as part of that, we evaluated a lot of the other options that were available. Of course, centralized staking, whether it was coinbase, binance, whatever.
00:14:45.770 - 00:14:47.106, Speaker A: We looked at some of the DeFi.
00:14:47.138 - 00:14:49.938, Speaker B: Protocols, whether, know, lidar or rocket pool.
00:14:49.954 - 00:14:52.234, Speaker A: Were the two that were active at the time.
00:14:52.352 - 00:14:55.930, Speaker B: And it was pretty clear to us, and, frankly, to other people who were.
00:14:56.000 - 00:14:59.386, Speaker A: Staking with us, institutional investors who were.
00:14:59.408 - 00:15:02.386, Speaker B: Staking with us, that there really wasn't.
00:15:02.438 - 00:15:05.120, Speaker A: A product out there that we were actually comfortable using.
00:15:05.730 - 00:15:11.134, Speaker B: There were a number of issues associated with that. But in particular, one big thing that.
00:15:11.172 - 00:15:18.702, Speaker A: We focused on was custody. You put your ETH into some centralized.
00:15:18.766 - 00:15:29.510, Speaker B: Exchange, you're getting 4%. If the exchange goes belly up, you lose your ETH. It made no sense. I mean, and these exchanges, even before SBF, were kind of shaky.
00:15:32.170 - 00:15:44.860, Speaker A: We were very hesitant to keep any capital on any exchanges, because there was not a lot of transparency in CFI, which ended up being correct.
00:15:46.830 - 00:15:53.210, Speaker B: And then when we looked at the DeFi space and it had this sort of, like, a lot of DeFi protocols.
00:15:53.290 - 00:15:54.526, Speaker A: I would say it had a lot.
00:15:54.548 - 00:16:05.934, Speaker B: Of decentralization theater, where you have a dow and you've got governance, and you have a token, and there's lots of smart contracts. But then when you actually do basic.
00:16:05.982 - 00:16:07.506, Speaker A: Level of diligence, like, you read the.
00:16:07.528 - 00:16:13.746, Speaker B: Code, see how this stuff works, you realize, like, no, it's fully custodial, or.
00:16:13.768 - 00:16:16.610, Speaker A: At least semi custodial, depending on the protocol.
00:16:16.690 - 00:16:19.640, Speaker B: And if this thing blows up, I lose my e, full stop.
00:16:22.170 - 00:16:26.150, Speaker A: You're putting all your eggs into this one basket.
00:16:26.890 - 00:16:31.606, Speaker B: And it wasn't worth it, because, again, 5% yield. Just keep your ETH in your wallet.
00:16:31.798 - 00:16:34.250, Speaker A: It's not worth the 5% yield.
00:16:34.590 - 00:16:46.830, Speaker B: So we wanted a product that actually made sense. We wanted a product that we ourselves would actually use, and a non negotiable criteria. There was self custody we wanted a product where we would have the keys.
00:16:47.730 - 00:16:49.818, Speaker A: Node operators are great, but I don't.
00:16:49.834 - 00:16:53.620, Speaker B: Want the node operator to have sole discretion on whether I get my ETH back.
00:16:54.630 - 00:16:56.670, Speaker A: We wanted to have our keys.
00:16:56.750 - 00:17:01.874, Speaker B: We wanted to have legitimate, justifiable to.
00:17:01.912 - 00:17:04.734, Speaker A: An auditor, let's say, to a financial.
00:17:04.782 - 00:17:06.162, Speaker B: Auditor that would audit our fund.
00:17:06.216 - 00:17:10.918, Speaker A: We wanted a justifiable way to be able to say, yeah, no, we actually have custody of our.
00:17:11.004 - 00:17:21.654, Speaker B: So that was the starting point. As we went down the path, we realized there was also a huge opportunity with restaking, which is a whole other can of worms.
00:17:21.702 - 00:17:24.298, Speaker A: But I think that is arguably one.
00:17:24.304 - 00:17:35.966, Speaker B: Of the most important developments that's emerging in Ethereum that I think could substantially increase the scope and value of Ethereum as a smart contract platform. And so those two things are really.
00:17:35.988 - 00:17:38.318, Speaker A: At the core of what Etherfi started.
00:17:38.484 - 00:17:41.246, Speaker B: Self custody, where the stakers hold the.
00:17:41.268 - 00:17:49.266, Speaker A: Keys, and a native ability to integrate with restaking. And now we're launching, which we'll get.
00:17:49.288 - 00:17:55.762, Speaker B: Into later, this really interesting gamified staking mechanism called Etherfan, which is an NFT.
00:17:55.826 - 00:17:57.794, Speaker A: Project built on top of Etherfi.
00:17:57.922 - 00:17:59.446, Speaker B: And that's actually the first way the.
00:17:59.468 - 00:18:06.806, Speaker A: Retail individuals will be able to participate in Etherfi, which we're super excited about.
00:18:06.988 - 00:18:35.060, Speaker F: Mike, I want to go into some of those items a little more in depth in a bit here, but I want to kind of level set, sort of. When did ether Phi launch? And just looking at it right now on DFI llama, it already has accrued 40 million in TBL, which is phenomenal. Start out of the gates, I guess. Yeah. When did it launch? And what do you think is the reason for your success so quickly early on here?
00:18:36.070 - 00:18:43.854, Speaker A: Yeah, we're 1% of the way there, so I think we have a long way to go in terms of growth.
00:18:43.902 - 00:18:50.198, Speaker B: But yeah, we announced our existence. I wouldn't even call it launching. I mean, we only really launched a.
00:18:50.204 - 00:18:52.694, Speaker A: Couple of weeks ago, actually, in that.
00:18:52.732 - 00:18:59.650, Speaker B: People actually could only start staking a few weeks ago. Before that, we announced our existence in March.
00:18:59.730 - 00:19:06.630, Speaker A: It was Defi Denver. Yeah, is when we did it, which was, I think, end of February, early March.
00:19:06.710 - 00:19:10.774, Speaker B: And as part of announcing our existence, we had something called the early adopter.
00:19:10.822 - 00:19:13.274, Speaker A: Program, which is still running, actually, where.
00:19:13.312 - 00:19:19.646, Speaker B: People could kind of like pre deposit their ETH. They're not staking it, they're really just.
00:19:19.668 - 00:19:22.410, Speaker A: Putting it in the contract and accrue.
00:19:22.490 - 00:19:24.590, Speaker B: Loyalty points that they could then use.
00:19:24.660 - 00:19:29.646, Speaker A: To get boosted rewards when they migrate to actually staking on etherprise.
00:19:29.678 - 00:19:35.806, Speaker B: So that's how we launched that ended up being a lot more successful than we thought. It was really, frankly, a last minute.
00:19:35.838 - 00:19:38.226, Speaker A: Kind of marketing push that we chose.
00:19:38.258 - 00:19:46.886, Speaker B: To do because we didn't want to announce that we exist. And then there's nothing people could do. We thought, let's give people something that.
00:19:46.908 - 00:19:50.534, Speaker A: They could interact with. And so we have this early adopter.
00:19:50.662 - 00:19:56.266, Speaker B: Program, and so that accrued, we would.
00:19:56.288 - 00:20:03.866, Speaker A: Have thought when we first launched that marketing program that 10 million would have been kind of like the most ambitious.
00:20:03.898 - 00:20:05.134, Speaker B: We could get with that.
00:20:05.332 - 00:20:13.806, Speaker A: But it ended up exceeding that pretty substantially. And then, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we launched finally the.
00:20:13.828 - 00:20:23.842, Speaker B: Ability to actually stake. And for now that is just staking full nodes. So 32 e nodes, you hold your keys, it's not pooled in any way.
00:20:23.976 - 00:20:27.138, Speaker A: You're just delegating your ETH staking.
00:20:27.234 - 00:20:30.854, Speaker B: And then in about two weeks, where, I guess when this podcast goes live.
00:20:30.892 - 00:20:34.626, Speaker A: It'Ll be pretty much now we're launching.
00:20:34.658 - 00:20:40.614, Speaker B: Ether fan, which is a pooled layer on top of Etherfide that allows retail.
00:20:40.662 - 00:20:44.134, Speaker A: Investors to actually participate through this gamified staking mechanic.
00:20:44.182 - 00:20:45.370, Speaker B: So it's been pretty fast.
00:20:45.440 - 00:21:00.590, Speaker A: I mean, I would say we've been very aggressive at shipping and delivering value to customers while staying safe, multiple audits and all that. But yeah, we've been pretty aggressive in getting stuff out there.
00:21:00.740 - 00:21:08.462, Speaker F: I got to say. Just one quick comment. You probably owe your marketing guy a raise for that last minute loyalty rewards push.
00:21:08.606 - 00:21:19.198, Speaker A: I mean, there was only like four of us working. I mean, it was me and Chuck, head of engineering and rock, and we literally just brainstormed this thing and somehow.
00:21:19.214 - 00:21:23.090, Speaker B: Got an audit done within a mean, because it was a very simple contract.
00:21:23.170 - 00:21:34.314, Speaker A: It was a couple of hundred lines. So within a week, we pulled this thing together and threw it out there. So it was just a collective kind of fun idea.
00:21:34.432 - 00:21:45.790, Speaker C: Wait, so was the ether fan idea? That was something that came really last minute then? Because that's like a really compelling part of the protocol for me.
00:21:45.860 - 00:22:01.140, Speaker B: No, so that was later, but it wasn't much later, honestly. We were brainstorming this idea of ether fan, and I can talk about why we chose to do that first before we actually launched our LST. Because ether fan is an NFT project.
00:22:01.590 - 00:22:10.840, Speaker A: It actually is based on the LST, but we're not launching that until a few months down the road. Yeah, so I guess I'll get into it.
00:22:12.490 - 00:22:13.606, Speaker B: There's going to be a number of.
00:22:13.628 - 00:22:16.354, Speaker A: Things that I think differentiate LSC protocols.
00:22:16.402 - 00:22:34.986, Speaker B: And determine which ones are successful. I think in no particular order, the criteria are going to be people that actually integrate with restaking. So protocols that integrate with restaking. The reason that's important is because as more ETH gets staked, so today you've.
00:22:35.018 - 00:22:37.082, Speaker A: Got something like 20 million ETH staked.
00:22:37.146 - 00:22:55.186, Speaker B: That number is going to go up to 60 or 80 million relatively quickly within a year or two. I believe if you just do the math, that means staking yields are going to be less than 1%, maybe even substantially less than 1%, because L2 protocols are all going to be benefiting from gang sharding and I forget the.
00:22:55.208 - 00:22:57.186, Speaker A: Exact EIP, but being able to commit.
00:22:57.298 - 00:23:08.374, Speaker B: Blobs, more of data more cheaply to layer one. So that's going to dramatically reduce the fees that L2 s are paying to Ethereum. Layer one. So staking rewards are going to go.
00:23:08.412 - 00:23:11.674, Speaker A: Down or a lot less ETH gets.
00:23:11.712 - 00:23:26.066, Speaker B: Staked, which I think is actually really bad for Ethereum. So are there going to be people that are staking in just a pure native staking protocol for 50 basis points? I don't think many people are going.
00:23:26.068 - 00:23:27.680, Speaker A: To be willing to do that.
00:23:28.210 - 00:23:34.802, Speaker B: And so the driver of success for staking protocols, I think, is going to be integration with restaking in a safe way.
00:23:34.856 - 00:23:40.354, Speaker A: There's lots of concerns around how to do it safely, but I believe that'll be figured out.
00:23:40.552 - 00:23:53.874, Speaker B: So that yields are substantially higher. I believe they could be dramatically higher. It's impossible to predict this stuff, but I think if the scope of what Ethereum is able to secure really expands.
00:23:53.922 - 00:23:56.086, Speaker A: In this kind of open ended way.
00:23:56.188 - 00:24:00.934, Speaker B: Through restaking, that could have a dramatic impact. I think most yields, most staking rewards.
00:24:00.982 - 00:24:02.570, Speaker A: Are going to come from restaking.
00:24:03.710 - 00:24:06.954, Speaker B: So I think protocols that natively integrate restaking are going to win.
00:24:07.072 - 00:24:09.580, Speaker A: The second thing is protocols that actually.
00:24:09.950 - 00:24:19.422, Speaker B: Focus on customer retention. I come from the SaaS, the software as a service world, having built top hat. So this is just how my mind works.
00:24:19.476 - 00:24:20.638, Speaker A: And I think anybody that's built a.
00:24:20.644 - 00:24:43.590, Speaker B: Business in that space, you think in terms of customer acquisition, lifetime value, gross margins, retention rate, churn, et cetera, all these metrics that define whether you have a real business or not. If you think about that and apply it to the staking universe, it becomes really obvious that your success is going to be driven by being able to retain customers better than others. Because now that Chappella is out, anybody.
00:24:43.660 - 00:24:46.438, Speaker A: Can just capital flight from one protocol to another.
00:24:46.524 - 00:24:54.506, Speaker B: So retention is going to be really critical and then obviously yields through restaking. So that's kind of how we were.
00:24:54.528 - 00:25:00.602, Speaker A: Thinking about Etherfi's protocol. And ether fan is like, how do we facilitate those things?
00:25:00.656 - 00:25:23.630, Speaker B: And so Etherfan is basically a gamified staking mechanism built on Etherfi. It is an NFT project where the NFT is something that you mint when you stake an Etherpi. So you go to Ether fan, you stake your ETH and you mint this fan NFT, which has a profile picture, all the usual, preferably rare fun stuff that you get from NFTs.
00:25:23.710 - 00:25:25.620, Speaker A: So like a board ape or whatever.
00:25:26.390 - 00:25:27.794, Speaker B: In our case, it's a wizard.
00:25:27.842 - 00:25:28.786, Speaker A: That's the first series.
00:25:28.818 - 00:25:52.170, Speaker B: It's a fun wizard with different characters. But this NFT, in some ways more importantly, also allows you to participate in a loyalty program, in a membership loyalty program. So the longer you stake, the more points loyalty points you have, like airline miles, more points you have. The higher your membership tier, and the higher your membership tier, the larger a share of protocol revenue you get.
00:25:52.320 - 00:25:54.614, Speaker A: And so that makes it more valuable.
00:25:54.662 - 00:25:56.046, Speaker B: Over time, which means if you've been.
00:25:56.068 - 00:25:58.526, Speaker A: Staking for a really long time, you.
00:25:58.548 - 00:26:02.866, Speaker B: Want to keep staking, maybe you will sell your NFT, but you're not going to burn that NFT because it has.
00:26:02.888 - 00:26:09.954, Speaker A: A lot of that intrinsic value associated with it, because it has those loyalty points querying to it.
00:26:10.072 - 00:26:13.806, Speaker B: So that is, I think, really interesting, compelling.
00:26:13.838 - 00:26:15.214, Speaker A: It's a very, I think, a unique.
00:26:15.262 - 00:26:19.846, Speaker B: Take on the NFT universe where it's not nearly as gambly as a lot.
00:26:19.868 - 00:26:28.710, Speaker A: Of other NFT projects and creates a fun kind of gamified mechanic to staking.
00:26:30.810 - 00:26:40.378, Speaker B: The reason it made sense for us to do that first, before we even launch our liquid staking token, is because if we launch yet another liquid staking token, which we will, I mean, in.
00:26:40.384 - 00:26:41.994, Speaker A: A few months we will have our.
00:26:42.032 - 00:26:56.826, Speaker B: Own e liquid staking token. But if you launch it and it's just okay, you have another liquid staking token, there's no liquidity for it, it's not integrated in any defi protocols. We'll be relatively small by definition.
00:26:56.938 - 00:26:58.450, Speaker A: So what are you going to do with that?
00:26:58.520 - 00:27:03.650, Speaker B: Why is that even interesting to anybody? So we needed to do something that was different and more unique and interesting.
00:27:03.720 - 00:27:05.186, Speaker A: And so that's why we started with.
00:27:05.208 - 00:27:07.526, Speaker B: Etherfi first, and then we're going to.
00:27:07.548 - 00:27:12.818, Speaker A: Launch the underlying kind of liquid staking token.
00:27:12.914 - 00:27:18.310, Speaker B: And when that token launches, it'll actually already have a ton of liquidity associated with it through Etherfam.
00:27:19.130 - 00:27:21.098, Speaker A: And so then it'll be easy to.
00:27:21.104 - 00:27:22.886, Speaker B: Integrate it with other Defi protocols.
00:27:22.918 - 00:27:25.034, Speaker A: To get a chain like oracle price.
00:27:25.072 - 00:27:26.986, Speaker B: Feed, which you need to integrate with.
00:27:27.008 - 00:27:32.670, Speaker A: Anything so that's the logic of why it made sense to launch ether fan first.
00:27:32.820 - 00:28:20.620, Speaker C: It is so surprising that this didn't already exist, actually, when nomadic and I were first talking about this, and he's like, yeah, check out this ether fan. I'm like, wait, so this doesn't exist on any other LST protocol? And then you start to think about it, especially for us as power users. I'm like, yeah, why would my staking position, let's say I'm a node operator, why would me staking ether for one year be equivalent to someone else who comes along? You need to not penalize those that are new to the game, but you need to reward those who have already demonstrated a loyalty to your project. So it makes all the sense in the world.
00:28:21.470 - 00:28:35.742, Speaker B: Defi has been, I would say, a beneficiary and a victim of the amount of capital that's flowed into it. Actually, I want to revise that and say it's mostly been a victim because there's been such a flood of easy.
00:28:35.796 - 00:28:37.666, Speaker A: Money, especially a year ago, two years.
00:28:37.688 - 00:28:52.114, Speaker B: Ago, that all the stuff that makes sense kind of died, and all of the weeds, the stuff that made no sense and just was there to grow fast and up and dump, was what thrived and survived. And now, finally, the oxygen is starting to thin.
00:28:52.162 - 00:28:54.774, Speaker A: And so the things that actually make sense are the ones that are starting.
00:28:54.812 - 00:28:57.078, Speaker B: To grow, like liquid staking and a.
00:28:57.084 - 00:28:59.030, Speaker A: Handful of other protocols.
00:29:01.150 - 00:29:08.282, Speaker B: Something really obvious. Instead of launching a governance token, which is a great way to just cash.
00:29:08.336 - 00:29:10.862, Speaker A: Out real quick and make some easy.
00:29:10.916 - 00:29:24.426, Speaker B: Money, that became the default, even though that arguably doesn't make sense in probably nine out of ten d five protocols, why are you launching another token? You're just doing it. Like, in nine out of ten cases.
00:29:24.458 - 00:29:25.678, Speaker A: You look at a protocol that has.
00:29:25.684 - 00:29:30.114, Speaker B: A token, you're like, why does the token exist? And the answer is, well, because they want to cash out.
00:29:30.152 - 00:29:34.178, Speaker A: That's why it exists. And in our case, we were like.
00:29:34.184 - 00:29:58.694, Speaker B: Well, why do we need another token? Like, you don't need another token. We can create the incentives that motivate users to participate in our protocol using something like a loyalty program which has existed for centuries in one way or another. And that makes more sense. We're not raising money through it, we're not dumping on retail. It aligns user incentives. It benefits users that are actually long term customers. Makes way more sense than an airdrop.
00:29:58.694 - 00:30:00.814, Speaker B: It, frankly, I think, benefits users more.
00:30:00.852 - 00:30:06.480, Speaker A: Than if we generated another shitcoin and airdropped it to people.
00:30:09.010 - 00:30:17.842, Speaker B: I think the reason that these kind of fairly obvious things were not the default, let's say, is because there was just such a flood of easy money.
00:30:17.896 - 00:30:19.618, Speaker A: Through the stimmy checks and all the.
00:30:19.624 - 00:30:24.050, Speaker B: Other stuff that the things that make sense didn't get built.
00:30:24.120 - 00:30:34.486, Speaker A: It was the things that were really quick to cash out on that were almost the only ones that were getting built. I don't know if our model is right.
00:30:34.508 - 00:30:39.466, Speaker B: I mean, there's lots of, frankly, questions about whether this model is going to be the one that takes off, but.
00:30:39.488 - 00:30:42.890, Speaker A: At least I think some exploration is due.
00:30:43.630 - 00:30:45.354, Speaker B: Certainly just us doing the same thing.
00:30:45.392 - 00:30:46.906, Speaker A: That everybody else was doing wasn't going.
00:30:46.928 - 00:30:51.580, Speaker B: To help us win. The self custody piece is very important.
00:30:52.030 - 00:30:55.754, Speaker A: But that's like a vitamin.
00:30:55.802 - 00:31:03.642, Speaker B: Most of the time it's a painkiller, some of the time when there's a big blow up, but most of the time it's a vitamin. Is someone really going to go to.
00:31:03.716 - 00:31:08.420, Speaker A: Another protocol because it's like, it's morally righteous and probably not.
00:31:11.270 - 00:31:12.594, Speaker B: The reason we did that is because.
00:31:12.632 - 00:31:16.094, Speaker A: I think it's the right thing to do. And that's also why all the ETH.
00:31:16.142 - 00:31:24.470, Speaker B: From the easer pan is actually going to like a solo staking program that supports distribute nodes. We're doing lots of that stuff because I think it's the right thing to do.
00:31:24.620 - 00:31:28.834, Speaker A: But we also understand that you need to have something that makes sense from a business standpoint.
00:31:28.882 - 00:31:33.882, Speaker B: You need to generate revenues. The revenues need to be enough to support your business.
00:31:34.016 - 00:31:44.846, Speaker A: You can't just imagine one round after round of financing and hope that eventually it kind of succeeds. You actually need to build a business that kind of mechanically makes sense.
00:31:44.948 - 00:32:32.810, Speaker F: Yeah, I think there's just such pure, proven product market fit with loyalty rewards programs. Obviously, in web two, and I think a lot of us have always thought that web3 crypto has always been a perfect vehicle to implement loyalty rewards programs, especially through NFTs, like how you're doing it. Okay, a quick question kind of about the NFT positions that people will hold. My mind's kind of already thinking, well, what else could I do with this NFT? Would people be able to borrow against this? Because essentially this could be a 32 ETH position, this could be a one ETH position, this could be a ten ETH position. So what other things do you have planned to do with these NFTs?
00:32:32.890 - 00:32:36.734, Speaker B: That's a great question. Exactly. Right out of the gate we have.
00:32:36.772 - 00:32:46.078, Speaker A: Integrations that are going to be in place with arcade and Stario, which are NFT lending protocols. And then we're working on a bunch.
00:32:46.094 - 00:32:55.346, Speaker B: Of others that will be released shortly, but that allows you to borrow against this NFT position. And the idea is, and I guess.
00:32:55.368 - 00:32:56.518, Speaker A: In a sense, I view myself as.
00:32:56.524 - 00:32:57.542, Speaker B: A bit of a finance guy.
00:32:57.596 - 00:33:03.686, Speaker A: Like anybody in DFI is a little bit financially minded. I like to think about things sort.
00:33:03.708 - 00:33:15.580, Speaker B: Of, kind of logically and mathematically, like this NFT, it wraps x amount of ETH, and so it should never trade below x, right? If you stake ten E and.
00:33:17.470 - 00:33:17.786, Speaker A: You.
00:33:17.808 - 00:33:21.338, Speaker B: Can always unwrap it and get the back, it would make no sense for.
00:33:21.344 - 00:33:23.422, Speaker A: This thing to trade below ten.
00:33:23.556 - 00:33:43.266, Speaker B: But it also accrues loyalty points, and those loyalty points progressively give you a greater share of protocol revenue. You could just do it. DCF discounted cash flow bottle on what is that worth? Well, that BB is a 5% premium to the value, and then it has this PFP element which has some rarity associated with it. I wouldn't pretend to know how to.
00:33:43.288 - 00:33:47.220, Speaker A: Value that, although there's some ideas about how to value these things.
00:33:48.550 - 00:34:03.562, Speaker B: So it should trade at some premium. I don't know what that premium is going to be. I think it'll be interesting to watch. But if you mint this thing and accrue some rewards and has loyalty points and all this stuff, you mint ten e, maybe this sort of assessed value.
00:34:03.616 - 00:34:06.460, Speaker A: Becomes worth twelve or 13 over time.
00:34:07.630 - 00:34:18.254, Speaker B: And so then how do you recover that value? Well, you can just sell the NFT, you could burn it and recover the E, or you could just borrow against it. And that effectively, depending on the interest.
00:34:18.292 - 00:34:20.238, Speaker A: Rate, could be a more sensible way.
00:34:20.324 - 00:34:22.030, Speaker B: For you to hold onto the NFT.
00:34:22.390 - 00:34:32.386, Speaker A: Without having to give up this profile thing that maybe you've grown attached first. The starting point is going to be.
00:34:32.488 - 00:34:34.290, Speaker B: NFT lending protocols.
00:34:36.470 - 00:34:41.080, Speaker A: And we'll go from there because I think there's a bunch of other interesting things that could be done with it.
00:34:42.090 - 00:35:18.414, Speaker C: Ethereum is fully decentralized, and liquidy is a shining example of decentralization. Liquidy is a non upgradable protocol where users can deposit their ETH and take out a loan. Interest free users get their loans in LUSD, an unstoppable ethereum native stablecoin that is solely backed by ether. You can use liquidity to buy real world assets or to earn yield across 20 plus places in DFI. More risk tolerant users can also use the protocol to lever up on their ETH. With over 750,000,000 worth of ETH locked into liquidity's unstoppable contracts, get access to real DFI. DFI, that's immutable, capital efficient, and fully decentralized.
00:35:18.414 - 00:35:57.066, Speaker C: Learn more@liquidy.org I want to circle back to just a few more basic questions though. For those that are totally new to ether Phi, these are much easier questions, I think, than having to walk us through ether fan. But can you remind us so what is the ether phi staking token for ETH? How does it accrue staking yield? And then maybe you can talk to us about the three major players in the protocol, which is a bond holder, an LST holder, versus a node operator.
00:35:57.178 - 00:36:03.146, Speaker B: Great question. So the liquid staking token has not yet been released and won't be released.
00:36:03.178 - 00:36:03.822, Speaker A: For a little while.
00:36:03.876 - 00:36:18.478, Speaker B: But when it's released, it's going to be ETH, which will work the same way as any other liquid staking token works. And from a user perspective, from the average user's perspective, it'll behave. And their ability to participate in it.
00:36:18.504 - 00:36:23.218, Speaker A: Will be exactly the same as they've come to expect in other liquid staking tokens.
00:36:23.234 - 00:36:30.154, Speaker B: So they show up, they put in their ETH, they exchange it for the liquid staking token, and then they don't need to do anything else.
00:36:30.192 - 00:36:33.206, Speaker A: It'll just accrue staking rewards automatically.
00:36:33.318 - 00:36:37.690, Speaker B: So after a year, two years, whatever, they can then unstake and get their.
00:36:37.840 - 00:36:41.854, Speaker A: Additional E. So that's simple, that's from.
00:36:41.892 - 00:37:18.594, Speaker B: The user standpoint, the same as most other staking protocols behind the scenes. And this is available to, let's say, power users or larger stakers. There's more complexity involved that implements the sort of noncustodial nature of the protocol. And that's where a full node staker, someone with 32 e comes in, mints a validator. So they deposit the 32 E that's staked. That goes to a node operator. That staker receives two NFTs as part of their stake.
00:37:18.594 - 00:37:21.094, Speaker B: One is a transferable portion, one is a bond.
00:37:21.222 - 00:37:23.386, Speaker A: The bond is not something that they.
00:37:23.408 - 00:37:24.714, Speaker B: Can get rid of until they actually.
00:37:24.752 - 00:37:31.706, Speaker A: Exit the validator, but the transferable portion is something that they can then exchange for EE.
00:37:31.818 - 00:37:33.518, Speaker B: And those users through the bond are.
00:37:33.524 - 00:37:35.390, Speaker A: The ones that effectively are securing.
00:37:38.290 - 00:37:40.874, Speaker B: The protocol and ensuring that when the validator.
00:37:40.922 - 00:37:53.874, Speaker A: Has to get exited, it actually gets exited. That's a very high level, kind of hand wavy explanation, but maybe that's enough for people to look at the white paper and dig into exactly the mechanics of how it works.
00:37:53.992 - 00:38:07.718, Speaker F: I know ETH isn't launched yet, but is there anything you can tell us about how you're thinking through defi integrations for ETH? Or certain kind of protocols or teams that you're talking to. Anything you can share?
00:38:07.804 - 00:38:11.322, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, the obvious stuff that you.
00:38:11.376 - 00:38:12.378, Speaker A: Want to do, if you're launching a.
00:38:12.384 - 00:38:25.934, Speaker B: New liquid staking token, the holy Grail, let's say, is eventually you want to get listed as collateral on a lending protocol like Ave, because that really makes it effectively, then plugs it into everything.
00:38:25.972 - 00:38:27.706, Speaker A: Else in DeFi, because you can deposit.
00:38:27.738 - 00:38:42.818, Speaker B: It as collateral, you can then borrow ETH against it, which generally, because of the nature of defi, the borrowing rate for that is negligible. Or you can borrow dollars or whatever. So that really is kind of the holy grail. But in addition to that, of course.
00:38:42.904 - 00:38:44.414, Speaker A: It'S going to be traded on uniswap.
00:38:44.462 - 00:38:46.190, Speaker B: It's going to be traded on balancer.
00:38:46.350 - 00:39:09.910, Speaker A: There's a variety of programs you can use to kind of bootstrap liquidity on these protocols, decentralized exchanges to ensure that there's enough liquidity there. It's going to be packaged in a variety of meta tokens. So there's a handful of teams that are working on that. We're speaking to all of them, where they basically sort of created an abstract.
00:39:09.990 - 00:39:12.814, Speaker B: Meta token that consists of pools of.
00:39:13.012 - 00:39:17.514, Speaker A: Lido, staked ETH re, and a variety of other staking tokens.
00:39:17.642 - 00:39:19.006, Speaker B: So all of that is kind of.
00:39:19.028 - 00:39:25.730, Speaker A: The par for the course. Like that's table stake these days if you're launching a liquid staking token.
00:39:26.630 - 00:39:29.934, Speaker B: But it's very hard to bootstrap liquidity.
00:39:29.982 - 00:39:35.794, Speaker A: Around that unless you have something else, like Etherfan, for example, which is why.
00:39:35.832 - 00:39:40.882, Speaker B: You really have two large protocols, by far the largest being lido.
00:39:41.026 - 00:39:52.454, Speaker A: And then in second place, you have rocket pool, basically. And then there's like a long tail of tiny, tiny protocols that have just not reached escape velocity.
00:39:52.582 - 00:40:13.502, Speaker F: Mike, do you think the yields you'll be able to provide on the Etherfi platform will be able to be competitive or perhaps outcompete some of these other LST protocols. And I guess with that, what impact does the native restaking have with something like Eigen layer have on Etherfi?
00:40:13.646 - 00:40:16.180, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's very good questions.
00:40:16.710 - 00:40:30.966, Speaker B: I will say about restaking. This is very forward to the future, certainly in crypto kind of dog years kind of mindset. I'd be surprised if there's any restaking revenues, any meaningful restaking revenues for a.
00:40:30.988 - 00:40:33.046, Speaker A: Year plus, maybe even longer.
00:40:33.228 - 00:40:35.286, Speaker B: So very bullish on it.
00:40:35.308 - 00:40:36.758, Speaker A: I think it's important, and we're going.
00:40:36.764 - 00:40:40.662, Speaker B: To be working on that with Eigen layer and other integrations.
00:40:40.806 - 00:40:45.900, Speaker A: But just the restaking piece is a bit out into the future.
00:40:47.070 - 00:40:49.818, Speaker B: The other thing we offer as part of Etherfi that I think will be.
00:40:49.824 - 00:40:59.034, Speaker A: Able to have higher yields. I can't even try to guess what they're going to be, but is layering.
00:40:59.082 - 00:41:08.226, Speaker B: Other sources of protocol revenue. So obviously there's NFT. There's various actions on the nfts generate revenue that goes back to stakers and.
00:41:08.248 - 00:41:17.250, Speaker A: Sort of rewards the long term holders. There's our ETH liquid staking token, which has associated with it sort of pool.
00:41:17.410 - 00:41:24.870, Speaker B: Fees, so a few bips on minting and burning it. We have an auction mechanism for node operators that generates a bit of revenue.
00:41:27.130 - 00:41:28.682, Speaker A: And all of that goes back to.
00:41:28.736 - 00:41:34.378, Speaker B: Stakers, which should generate higher rates of return. We're also going to be putting in.
00:41:34.384 - 00:41:37.686, Speaker A: A bit of ETH from our treasury.
00:41:37.718 - 00:41:53.450, Speaker B: To support yields initially. That's especially important because the queue for staking is 45, 47 days. So when you're bootstrapping a new protocol. Our first few nodes that were staked.
00:41:53.530 - 00:41:55.022, Speaker A: Were staked about a month ago.
00:41:55.156 - 00:42:01.362, Speaker B: So they're just now starting to come online. So that creates a real lag, especially.
00:42:01.416 - 00:42:03.090, Speaker A: For any protocols that are starting up.
00:42:03.160 - 00:42:09.510, Speaker B: Where you've got basically a month and a half of no yields. So, okay, where are people going to stake when there's no yields?
00:42:11.850 - 00:42:18.210, Speaker A: Those are challenges that we're overcoming with, as I said, treasury and other sources of revenue that I think would generate higher returns.
00:42:18.290 - 00:42:19.814, Speaker B: The only thing I'll say about, because.
00:42:19.852 - 00:42:21.114, Speaker A: I really don't want to talk about.
00:42:21.152 - 00:42:23.098, Speaker B: Specific numbers, a because I don't know.
00:42:23.104 - 00:42:30.862, Speaker A: What they're going to. Yeah, for lots of reasons, I don't want to talk about specific numbers, but.
00:42:30.916 - 00:42:40.270, Speaker B: Other people have done really good work, built nice spreadsheets and models on Twitter that they published, and they look reasonable.
00:42:41.330 - 00:42:49.266, Speaker A: Again, impossible to predict what it's actually going to be. But they've sort of done the models that I think give reasonable ideas about.
00:42:49.288 - 00:42:52.530, Speaker B: What the yields might be, given reasonable assumptions.
00:42:53.830 - 00:42:55.602, Speaker A: Within a couple of weeks, we're going to know.
00:42:55.736 - 00:43:01.830, Speaker C: Mike, any other surprises on the roadmap or bits of alpha that you could share with our listeners?
00:43:02.570 - 00:43:04.226, Speaker B: I mean, the main thing we're focused.
00:43:04.258 - 00:43:12.326, Speaker A: On is right now is Etherfan. Then the big kind of objective beyond that is restaking.
00:43:12.438 - 00:43:47.910, Speaker B: And that includes both integrations. And I think there's room. I mean, if you want alpha, there is definitely room in the market for someone to create a restaking router, so to speak, so that someone, a user could say, look, I have my ETH, I want to stake it. I want X percent exposure to restaking and I want these particular things on my restaking stack. That's a thing that has to be built for 100% that's going to be built. Maybe Eigen layer will build it, but someone, whether it's them or somebody else.
00:43:48.060 - 00:43:50.006, Speaker A: That plugs into Eigen layer and other.
00:43:50.028 - 00:44:00.234, Speaker B: Restaking options, some sort of aggregator, that's a thing that has to 100% exist. So if there's any builders out there that are looking to build stuff, that.
00:44:00.272 - 00:44:11.674, Speaker A: Is a product that in twelve months time will be like, well, of course this new multibillion dollar protocol is there because that had to be built.
00:44:11.792 - 00:44:45.400, Speaker C: Well, Mike, this is probably a good place for us to start to wrap up. I got to circle back to the comment you made about crypto dog years. That's brilliant. I can't believe I've never heard anyone say that. And I was just looking this up and according to if we say a crypto dog year is equivalent to seven years, you're about 91 years old. So it doesn't get much more OG than that. I want to remind listeners that they should learn more about Etherfi at Ether Phi really simple website.
00:44:45.400 - 00:45:15.490, Speaker C: They can go to the ether Phi Twitter account. It's ether underscore Phi. They should follow you on Twitter as well. It's at mike siligadza. Hopefully we'll put that up on screen so you don't have to try to spell that. And then just Mike wanted to say it's been an absolute pleasure, of course, to get to learn more about ether fi from you. We really appreciate you sort of taking the time to dumb all this down for us, but I want to give you the last word.
00:45:15.490 - 00:45:19.378, Speaker C: Anything else that you'd like to share with folks before we go?
00:45:19.544 - 00:45:20.674, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:45:20.712 - 00:45:34.034, Speaker A: Great conversations, really great questions. Yeah, the only thing I'd say just go to Etherfan. I think if you're interested in staking ether fan will be a really fun, interesting, kind of gamified way for you to participate.
00:45:34.082 - 00:45:35.510, Speaker B: But not if you're in the US.
00:45:35.580 - 00:45:37.750, Speaker A: Then don't go to ether fan.
00:45:38.490 - 00:45:51.130, Speaker C: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at edge underscore pod.
