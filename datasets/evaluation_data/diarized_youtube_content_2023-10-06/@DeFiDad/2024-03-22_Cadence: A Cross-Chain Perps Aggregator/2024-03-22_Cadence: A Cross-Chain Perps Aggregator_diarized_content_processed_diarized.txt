00:00:00.170 - 00:00:14.074, Speaker A: So symphony is essentially an intent based perpetuals aggregator that allows the trader to execute any position across any chain at near instant speeds. Imagine, you know, you see the market picking up. You want to long Ethereum.
00:00:14.202 - 00:00:15.374, Speaker B: All you really need to do is.
00:00:15.412 - 00:00:37.510, Speaker A: Choose an asset, you know, Ethereum and a leverage amount ten X and our solvers basically go and find the best pap protocol liquidity for this position and they give it back to you. And let's say the celibbers come back with the best trade is half on cadence perpetuals and half on GMX. The user can just, in one click, instantly execute this trade.
00:00:39.950 - 00:00:53.174, Speaker C: Welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's show spotlights the new flagship protocol for decentralized perpetuals on Kanto called cadence. In this episode, we'll cover how Cadence.
00:00:53.222 - 00:00:56.106, Speaker D: Is building an intent centric perpetuals aggregator.
00:00:56.218 - 00:01:04.174, Speaker C: How cadence compares with other perps protocols, and how they plan to launch a trading pair for one of the most popular crypto stocks on chain.
00:01:04.302 - 00:01:06.114, Speaker D: But before we do, just a quick.
00:01:06.152 - 00:01:09.300, Speaker C: Word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.
00:01:12.390 - 00:01:58.734, Speaker D: Introducing flatmoney, the first decentralized delta neutral flatcoin built on base with sustainable yield that's completely untethered from legacy finance. Because Defi needs an uncensorable based unit of currency, you can mint unit with Reith, which is held in the protocol's shared liquidity pool, where it's borrowed by leveraged traders. As a leveraged trader, you can deposit your margin collateral and go long on re. If you're trading in the perpetual futures market, you'll pay unit holders to open leverage positions. If you're holding unit, you'll earn yield from liquidations, borrow rate and trading fees, preserve your purchasing power, and offset your exposure to crypto market volatility.

00:04:33.350 - 00:05:14.930, Speaker F: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado Multichain UX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:05:15.430 - 00:05:24.482, Speaker C: All right, let's introduce Bavaldi and Mozart, who are CEO and CTO of Symphony Labs. Bavaldi and Mozart, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:05:24.536 - 00:05:26.774, Speaker A: Doing great. Appreciate you guys having us on.
00:05:26.892 - 00:06:31.778, Speaker C: A little over a week ago, cadence protocol went live on Kanto, and Cadence is now one of the newest, most popular dapps on Kanto, I would compare it in some ways to GMX on Arbitrum. There's an ability to trade popular tokens like Atom or Kanto or ETH, and there's a little over 23 million, I believe. As of today, in trading volume in total in just the first week here. So congrats on that. We want to dig into what is next. Like what are you building as an intense centric perps aggregator? And this is going to allow us, I think, to access liquidity on other L1s and l two s, but for now we can access that all through Kanto. So guys, why don't we just kick off with your background and then would love if you can share more about the story of actually founding cadence protocol.
00:06:31.874 - 00:07:17.878, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So I can start off with a little bit background on myself, then I'll pass over to Mozart. I can introduce the rest of the team as well. So I've been in crypto since about 2015. First I was just the classic trader, buying whichever coins looked good on the market, and then I became a blockchain engineer for some of the larger companies in crypto, and that's where I met actually Mozart, Beethoven and some of the rest of our team. And then I left to join consensus and joined the Defi team there on Metamask. So I focused a lot on building infrastructure for the wallets, things like NSwaps, RMPs, aggregators around those different defi sectors, and that kind of merch into our vision currently for Cadence as well.
00:07:17.878 - 00:07:21.410, Speaker A: I'll pass it over to Mozart. Awesome. Yeah, I go by Mozart here at.
00:07:21.420 - 00:08:09.014, Speaker G: Symphony Labs and I'm in the CTO role here, so kind of handle a lot of the technical developments we work on here at Cadence in terms of getting into crypto. Got in around 2017, and like a lot of people, I stumbled upon the bitcoin white paper, read it, and was kind of hooked ever since. So started at a big consulting company and met two of the co founders there, and then most recently was at Kraken exchange building out a lot of their production level, like smart contracts and DFI infrastructure. And I think a big thing we're conveying is we want to take a lot of the experiences we've had at these large production level, crypto, web3 companies, and bring that to cadence, bring some sort of level professionalism in the web3 space here. But yeah, good to meet you guys, and thanks again for having us on.
00:08:09.132 - 00:08:22.140, Speaker B: Correct me if I'm wrong, guys, but there's two other core contributors, and I think they go by names, Beethoven and maybe how did they fit into the team? How'd you meet them as when?
00:08:22.770 - 00:08:51.862, Speaker A: So me, Mozart and Beethoven all worked together around like four or five years ago at this point as blockchain engineers for a consulting company. And that's where we all kind of met. We're the core blockchain team back there. And obviously then we went to our different public sector companies. Mozart with Kraken, we had bait. I went to XLR and Kraken as well, before XLR. And that's how we all basically met.
00:08:51.862 - 00:09:15.626, Speaker A: And then Chopan or Chopin, he used to work more in the traditional background of traditional finance type backgrounds or more inside like the aerospace sector. He actually worked on building one of the first hypersonic spacecraft. So that's where he kind of comes from. And then we all kind of met. We saw some big issues in crypto and decided to really start cadence.
00:09:15.738 - 00:09:26.450, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, why don't we just hop right into it? And I think we should just ask the question, what is cadence? Maybe give us the high level overview how you guys like to describe it.
00:09:26.520 - 00:10:05.870, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess surprisingly, I guess for us, luckily that's kind of a tough question. At some level. Cadence really evolves almost every six months in our roadmap. So we've basically crafted several phases and steps of where we're taking cadence to ultimately create the future of crypto we envision. So first it's perpetuals protocol on Kanto, and they'll kind of transform into an intent based perpetuals aggregator. Then it becomes aggregator for all crypto execution at some level. And then soon it'll become a base layer infrastructure that people can build upon.
00:10:05.870 - 00:10:50.038, Speaker A: But starting off with our initial launch, which Defi dad brought up initially, we launched a perpetuals protocol last week on Kanto, and the goal of that protocol is essentially to create the most capital efficient use of liquidity with RWAs, CSR and LSDs. And currently you can trade with C note that's essentially a Canto stable that grows currently is at 8% every year APR and you can trade Kanto, Ethereum, Atom, and we'll be adding more RWAs in the future, and our own stable coin as well, which is backed by T bills. And then later is a symphony launch about five months from now. And I'll stop there. I'm sure we'll get into symphony and everything around that later on.
00:10:50.144 - 00:11:32.586, Speaker C: Guys, I want to dissect some of the familiar parts of what I see on the cadence application. So if you're familiar with, let's say, GMX, what else can you call out here that we might be familiar with as Defi perps traders like I see CLP, which I was thinking of GLP. I'm thinking of the composition of that CLP as opposed to what we might have used with something like GLP even would love to know. As simple of things as what trading pairs we might expect next, considering what we have available today.
00:11:32.688 - 00:11:46.878, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So one of the big trading pairs we were actually waiting to announce on your podcast will actually be a stock. So I'm curious if you guys have any guesses of what the stock could be.
00:11:46.964 - 00:11:52.560, Speaker B: Oh, I, like, mean, it could be Tesla, it could be.
00:11:55.170 - 00:11:55.806, Speaker A: Mean, it could.
00:11:55.828 - 00:11:57.986, Speaker B: Be a lot of things, but, yeah.
00:11:58.088 - 00:11:58.958, Speaker A: What do you got, defi?
00:11:58.974 - 00:12:00.162, Speaker B: Dad, what's your guess?
00:12:00.296 - 00:12:05.550, Speaker C: The one that I thought of immediately was Nvidia. Just thinking of, like, really hot stocks.
00:12:05.630 - 00:12:27.100, Speaker A: Yeah. So it'll be coin. So, yeah, nomadic was correct. So we're thinking coin. We should be the first perpetuals, like decentralized perpetuals protocol, which is not synthetic, to actually add coin coinbase's stock into it. That should be happening around middle of next month, once we complete the integration. So that's one example of an know we're adding into the system.
00:12:27.100 - 00:13:22.790, Speaker A: Obviously, there's things know bonds and these different other systems, which really make the whole space really interesting with perpetuals, because imagine you put a bond into the pool. People can do perpetuals on a bond, which essentially is like leveraging a bond at some level. So your APR dramatically increases than usual. So lots of interesting types of ways. We're thinking about RWAs, and also we can go more to CSR and the LSD side as well, if you guys are curious. But the goal is that we want to create the most capital efficient pool for Kanto, but also for perpetuals trading. And this allows us to essentially create these mini microeconomies on know, having this multi asset pool is very critical for the initial launching of a chain, to make a chain bigger, and also to really just grow value inside an ecosystem.
00:13:22.790 - 00:13:24.858, Speaker A: So that's kind of the initial goals of it.
00:13:24.944 - 00:13:55.110, Speaker B: Hey, so, guys, just on coin, how are you going about this? I guess from the legal or regulatory side, I think it's really interesting that you can do this. It's something that I haven't seen a lot in the space, other than I guess you see, like, synthetic versions of stocks sometimes pop up. But is there just like, anything you can kind of break down just on the back end, how you're making this possible, and maybe what type of oracles would be involved or where you're getting the pricing?
00:13:56.730 - 00:14:20.846, Speaker A: You know, I used to work for an RWA startup just part time, a little bit, just for fun about like a year ago. And the legality side, when it comes to RWAs, especially as a dev. We're all devs here. Very proficient devs. You don't want to really get into the whole legal side. That's just going to take away time from what you're actually really good at, which is building. And that's something which we want to stay away from, but we do want to add RWAs into it.
00:14:20.846 - 00:14:57.834, Speaker A: So there's lots of RWA providers on Kanto itself which are native to Kanto, part of the whole neo finance vision of Kanto itself. And what we're doing is basically implementing those RWAs into Kane's perpetuals. And one of them is launching coin in a few weeks. An interesting part about this is to what you said before in nomadic, is that most perpetual protocols, if they did ever want to do this, it would be a synthetic version. You can't really do anything with this. It's just like a fake oracle or it's an oracle just giving a price of what this valued at coin stock really is. But this is real.
00:14:57.834 - 00:15:22.290, Speaker A: You can do a perpetual strain, do a ten x long on coin, close out your position, get your money back in coin. They can go on to these third party providers and get the real value of the stock from their website. So that's something which is really interesting and really real about what games perpetual is really doing. It's real RWAs, not synthetic assets. That's going to be really interesting and exciting about the whole coin launch next month.
00:15:22.360 - 00:15:25.890, Speaker B: And what type of leverage should we expect on coin?
00:15:25.970 - 00:15:29.990, Speaker A: Yeah. So it'll be 50 x leverage. That's what we're expecting to do with that.
00:15:30.060 - 00:16:01.278, Speaker C: Another few simple questions. In terms of features available to perps traders, how much leverage can you get for the different trading pairs? I think there's three of them right now. ETH kanto, and I'm forgetting one ETH, Kanto and Adam. So how much leverage can you get? And then can you talk about the composition of, like, what's the rough percentage for each of the different assets that make it up?
00:16:01.364 - 00:16:27.880, Speaker A: Yeah, currently it's those three assets which you can trade on. So it's 25% of the pool is canto, and that's where we see most of our trading volume. But we've actually capped Canto to three X leverage. So that's to kind of mitigate some of the market manipulation around it. It's going to increase, obviously. Of course. Also with Kendall's equity increasing over the last week, you can increase the cap and which we're planning to do later this month.
00:16:27.880 - 00:16:40.426, Speaker A: And then there's Adam, which is 50 x leverage ethereum, 50 x leverage. So that's kind of initial coins we're doing, but over the next few months we'll have a lot more coming in.
00:16:40.528 - 00:17:06.578, Speaker C: One of the terms that we mentioned earlier, intense centric. Can you dumb that down? It's a word that, or it's a phrase that we're seeing with newer Defi protocols. And obviously, what do I want to say? It differentiates the offering that you've got here. So how does that play into the future of this product?
00:17:06.664 - 00:17:07.746, Speaker A: Yeah, I can talk a little bit.
00:17:07.768 - 00:17:53.246, Speaker G: About what intents would mean and kind of how it means in our case. We've noticed in a lot of the projects everyone has a slightly different take on what an intent means. In our case, it's kind of the debate between imperative or declarative. So it's like rather than specifying the exact execution path you need to make a trade occur, it's more specifying your desire of what the trade is and then letting this community of solvers go out and figure out what the best solution is. So it's really about making your intent, your desire, more open ended, but seeking out the best results for it, and then letting people that are trained, thinking solvers, high frequency traders, folks like that, that can come in and find you the best execution for that trade. So I hope that's kind of a high level of how we think about intents here at cadence.
00:17:53.358 - 00:17:54.210, Speaker A: Yeah, that's perfect.
00:17:54.280 - 00:18:11.906, Speaker B: I think let's dive into that maybe a little bit more when we talk about symphony. But for now, I just want to even take a step back and just kind of get your guys take on. Why build on Kanto from the beginning, what drew you into that community specifically?
00:18:12.098 - 00:19:10.730, Speaker A: I guess firstly, we know lots of the core contributors personally, and they're really smart know, for example, I know you guys interviewed Scott a few weeks ago, so I'm sure you guys understand that part of it. But what also pulled us in was how they thought about DFI and crypto really differently. First with their free public goods infrastructure, which kind of built the core of ENSO, then with CSR, and now you can see with neo finance and 1115 tech, and now also they're launching parallel EVM, but they're going to be the second chain after, say, to essentially be a parallel EVM chain as well, which helps perpetual trading aggressively. So just overall, what we've noticed is that they're iterating and finding PMF over and over again consistently. And that's something really core to cadence overall. So we spent six months just iterating on Symphony's technical side over and over again till it finally clicked and really worked. That's something we've seen a lot with the whole canto ecosystem.
00:19:10.730 - 00:19:50.282, Speaker A: So overall, just being the first perpetuals protocol on a chain with high growth potential, being close to the core contributors, and also just being the flagship protocol on a chain that is growing is like the perfect combination, essentially, for the initial stages of a project. And you can kind of see this already now with Kanto's launching their hackathon again in a few weeks, and you can see so many projects on Kanto for this hackathon are planning to build on top of cadence. They're bringing ideas like how can we build on top of cadence, and how can we make leaderboards or different delta neutral strategies and things like that using cadence. So, yeah, it's kind of why we chose Kanto. Yeah.
00:19:50.336 - 00:20:25.718, Speaker B: Vivaldi, I love that. I've been drawn into the Kanto community a lot more recently. I was really interested when they first launched because they had a bunch of interesting public goods, infrastructure and ideas that I really hadn't seen before. And then we had our podcast with Scott Lewis, which we released maybe like a month ago or something, but that drew me in even more. And then obviously meeting you guys, and I got the cadence t shirt. Won't say where I got that, but got it. And yeah, I just think they're doing a lot of unique and interesting things in that community.
00:20:25.718 - 00:21:03.294, Speaker B: And again, no VC funding. It's like completely organic grassroots. And I personally think it's quite undervalued right now. Not financial advice, but if you're doing any comparisons to other like chains with similar TVL at activity, I think it's a good one to keep your eye on. So I want to also talk about just like where you guys are again in your launch timeline here. You've released your product, you've got a bunch of milestones coming, I guess. Also, how's been the reception from the community? It seems like if people are now building on top of cadence, that's news to me.
00:21:03.294 - 00:21:05.150, Speaker B: That's obviously a good sign.
00:21:05.300 - 00:21:43.840, Speaker G: Yeah, I mean, I can talk to that and a little bit about how launch was received overall. So far, the sentiment is super positive. We were at ETH Denver recently got to meet a ton of people from the community and get a lot of love from everyone building on Kanto and from their core contributors. In terms of launch, we've seen really good adoption so far. I think in the past day we about tripled our volume. I believe we tweeted yesterday we were at around 7 million, and then today, this morning I think we crossed over 23 with around 40K in fees, which all get redistributed to cadence and CLP holders. So we're pretty happy with the traction we've seen so far.
00:21:43.840 - 00:22:13.142, Speaker G: Also, we've kind of done it with a more grassroots approach. We've had early incentive programs, different ambassador programs, very active in our discord and telegrams. So really trying to make sure everyone feels included. And I think we've seen a lot of that love come out with the traction we've seen on the platform. And then the only other thing to add is in terms of kind of where we're at the launch. From a technical perspective, since I'm CTO, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about that side of things. It seems to be going really well.
00:22:13.142 - 00:22:42.650, Speaker G: We've seen a huge intake in increase in traction and surge of demand coming in. We've announced it before, but we had a partnership with Google Cloud in their web3 accelerator program, so it's actually pretty cool. We have on demand resources funding from Google in terms of all of our servers, so everything we run is pretty much beefed up as much as it can be. So we're able to handle all this traffic and demand we've seen pretty well so far. No downtime really, and everything's been running as expected.
00:22:42.730 - 00:22:56.066, Speaker B: That's awesome. I think we should get into symphony. I would like to know kind of what it is at a high level and maybe when we should expect this kind of massive upgrade to cadence to go live.
00:22:56.168 - 00:24:12.442, Speaker A: Yeah, so definitely I can get into symphony. So symphony is essentially an temp based perpetual aggregator that allows a trader to execute any position across any chain at near instant speeds and in the future execute anything from bridging, swaps, bag nfts, something like even getting the most yield for your Ethereum across any chain instantly. So give me a quick example of how this really works because I feel like that helps it really click for people is imagine you see the market picking up you want to long Ethereum. All you really need to do is choose an asset ethereum and a leverage amount ten X and our solvers basically go and find the best path protocol liquidity for this position and they give it back to you and let's say the solvers come back with the best trade is half on cadence perpetuals and half on GMX. The user can just in one click instantly execute this trade and you can see inside this example, it doesn't really matter what chain you're on, or bridging any assets, or even worrying about something like gas fees. And at the same time, you're able to make a trade across several different protocols. And that's maybe called position sharding, actually, that allows you to basically solve liquidity fragmentation.
00:24:12.442 - 00:25:13.280, Speaker A: So symphony was kind of built around these two biggest issues we see in crypto currently, which is liquidity fragmentation and user experience. And for example, for someone to onboard currently onto crypto to make just a simple perpetual strain on say like let's say on GMX, for example, you can take them almost like 8 hours from figuring out what's a wallet, how to bridge assets, how to even get gas fees on L two. And then they're also confused, what's an L two in the first place. So someone with no crypto background should be able to use these systems we're basically building here or less like what's really the point of it. And that's what symphony's goal really is, to abstract all this base layer infrastructure, wallets, chains, gas fees, bridging, whatever it is, and just make it simple, make it almost like a web two UI at some level. And that's kind of our goal and taking to such a big degree that we won't even have chains on our UI. So someone with no crypto background should be able to use it.
00:25:13.280 - 00:25:34.950, Speaker A: So that's basically what came birth of symphony. And we learned the only way to really make this possible and create this hyper efficient market in crypto, where protocols are able to communicate amongst each other instantly and things like that, is to essentially let protocols communicate instantly across each other. So that's what gave birth to Stephanie.
00:25:35.450 - 00:26:43.600, Speaker H: Overall, Maverick protocol provides innovative liquidity solutions for token projects to customize, automate, and incentivize their liquidity with the highest efficiency in DeFi, all powered by Maverick Amm. Why has Maverick become the first choice for all kinds of token projects, from stablecoins to LRTs as the first dynamic distribution? Amm Maverick AmM provides automated liquidity movement modes which move your liquidity to follow price, keeping it where it does the most good. This enables maverick powered pools to process higher volume with lower TVL requirements, and means that Maverick supports the highest capital efficiency for LRTs. Like we ETH, Maverick Amm also supports non uniform liquidity distributions, making it easy to concentrate liquidity in shapes that fit each project's individual needs. Finally, Maverick boosted positions maximize incentive efficiency for protocols looking to bootstrap their token liquidity to precise strategic areas of a liquidity pool. Token communities like Lido, Aave, Swell Ethify and Kelp Dao have been bootstrapping TVL and maintaining peg using Maverick tools ready to build liquidity with maximal efficiency.

00:26:45.730 - 00:27:00.606, Speaker B: When we first started talking, you kind of gave me a lot of background and reasoning for why you went down this path. And I thought it was actually pretty interesting. I think it's probably worth explaining, maybe just like all the behind the scenes.
00:27:00.638 - 00:27:03.602, Speaker A: Effort you did with. I think it was like layer zero.
00:27:03.656 - 00:27:12.854, Speaker B: Labs and the Axelr team to lead you to this. So maybe if you wouldn't mind just kind of like explaining that to the audience for sure.
00:27:13.052 - 00:27:52.046, Speaker G: Yeah, so this whole idea started around six to seven months ago, maybe a little before that. That's when we started trying to build out this intent centric aggregator. And back then we weren't focused as much on an optimistic execution approach. We were thinking, know I'm on chain a, I open a trade, that asset gets layer zero or axilar sent to another trade and we attempt to open it. And we spent a lot of time working with the layer zero team. Obviously we have one co founder from Axilar, so we're very familiar with their tech as well for bridging. And at the end of the day the quickest we could really get it down for a perpetual trade was closer to 30 to 40 seconds.
00:27:52.046 - 00:28:40.926, Speaker G: And that was even on more quick l two s. So it wasn't on like Ethereum main net versus another slow one, it was on polygon arbitrum for example. So what we found was that's great if you want to do normal bridging, but for perpetual specifically, it just wasn't fast enough to actually capture if you want to do a quick trade or you want to capture some market volatility like we're seeing now, it really wasn't fast enough. And that's what led us to the solution. The solution being let someone optimistically execute the trade with a solver fronting their collateral and have that 30 to 45 2nd callback which we need layer zero Axolr to validate that request. Happen on the tail end. So happy to get more into the technical flow, a bit of what Bavali was just mentioning, but that's kind of a little bit of story of what we tried working on and what led us to symphony Mozart.
00:28:41.038 - 00:29:00.454, Speaker B: Maybe you can kind of reverse engineer that example that Vivaldi was walking through, or maybe just kind of further explained what happens under the hood in a symphony. And again, try to keep it as high level as you can. But yeah, maybe just take that however you want.
00:29:00.572 - 00:29:23.310, Speaker G: Definitely. Yeah, yeah. I think a lot of light bulbs go off once we go step by step into what really happens with symphony. So let's say a user navigates to a wallet that's connected to symphony, and at this point they'll specify whatever their intent is and say their intent is. I want to leverage shade long canto at 30 x. Right. As soon as they signal that intent, their collateral needed for that trade is instantly locked.
00:29:23.310 - 00:30:02.554, Speaker G: And then this intent is basically streamed by solvers who are running their own mempool. So once it's streamed by them, they're seeing that intent and they're going out and they're scanning for the best possible execution for that. So they see I want to leverage log canto. They're looking out across different blockchains and different protocols and seeing where that liquidity can exist. And they basically return those solutions. The best few solutions are returned to the user, and the user go ahead and sign a user op, which is an account abstraction based transaction, on whichever solution they think is best and they would prefer. And these solutions are optimized in terms of lowest slippage, lowest fees, best execution price.
00:30:02.554 - 00:30:40.178, Speaker G: Different things like that would basically determine how the best one is selected. Once they sign that transaction, it's sent over to the destination chain, technically the AA like based bundler of the execution chain. And that position is opened on the destination chain with collateral from the solver. So once it's open, then it triggers a layer zero or axlr callback. And that axlr callback is pretty much saying a true or false. So true the position was successfully opened, or false. If true and it gets sent back, then that initial collateral I mentioned in the first step that got locked up goes to the solver because they successfully opened the position for the user.
00:30:40.178 - 00:31:18.758, Speaker G: And if false, if the solver didn't actually open it or something failed, the initial user just gets their collateral back. So what we're really accomplishing here is that the position and that price capture you wanted gets opened near instantly. But that 45 2nd period of doing that validation step happens more on the onus of the solver and doesn't really infect you getting the price you want or closing the position before liquidation or anything like that. So we're trying to give the best of both worlds with near instant execution. But still the security of battle tested systems such as Axelr layer zero that really validate the request on the end state. So hopefully that summed it up well.
00:31:18.844 - 00:31:31.354, Speaker C: Guys, before we got started here, I know you've made mention of a cadence stablecoin. I'm curious, how does that fit into the design of this perps protocol and what symphony will be?
00:31:31.472 - 00:32:17.542, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So I guess going a little back before that, to really make symphony to the level we want it to really be, you need to have a type of perpetuals protocol or some productive system before that. And that's what Kane's perpetuals is. Lots of intent based protocols. You see, currently, they forget that if you just launch an intent based protocol, the only way to really make revenue is by just charging very high fees to the users. That's the only really way for an intent based protocol to make a good amount of revenue to sustain itself. So by first launching cadence perpetuals, we're able to essentially have productive assets, have protocol owned liquidity, and start generating revenue without being fee leaching from users, and make it actually sustainable in the long run.
00:32:17.542 - 00:32:55.570, Speaker A: To make Symphony get to the heights, we really want to see it. And there's some other things as well, going to stable. You were talking about DeFi debt. Another asset we're adding into our pool is our cadence stablecoin. And this is built off something called application specific dollar, which is a Kanto primitive they're launching. And essentially how it works, trying to keep it very high level, is that you can essentially lp into our CLP pool using any stablecoin. And then that stable coin, let's say you use USDC that goes into the background, that will be sold for note, and then note is supplied to the canto lending market.
00:32:55.570 - 00:33:40.770, Speaker A: And when you supply note to the Kendall lending market, that gives you essentially 5% yield. And then in the background, we give you back our cadence stablecoin. So that's like a little high level of how stablecoin essentially works. It's pegged to note, and it's also earning revenue. So we'll be earning revenue from this caden stable at about like 5% APY, because they're all backed by treasury bills. And then we essentially give this revenue back to the users, or we might do like token buybacks or things like that with this revenue as well. And the big reason why you need something like Keynes perpetuals to really create this stable is because the cold star problem, essentially, for liquidity, for stablecoins, a stablecoin is really nothing and has no value without liquidity.
00:33:40.770 - 00:34:38.438, Speaker A: So by using this and using our own pool to really generate this liquidity. We're able to grow the stable to have very solid liquidity, very usable liquidity, and lots of active trading with it, and then we can finally make this can stable in the forefront. And the reason why we want to stable in the first place is for omnichan systems, when it comes to symphony, you really need something like omnichain stable at some level to first pay solvers, because solvers could be on different chains to pay solvers and also for revenue accrual gas payment tokens and different systems which aren't the same on every single chain. For example, you can make a trade for gas payments that are different on cancer compared to Ethereum. But if you have an omnichain stable with lots of liquidity and usage, that kind of solves that issue at some level. So that's kind of why that's another use case of why we're using Cane's perpetuals for symphony and things like that.
00:34:38.524 - 00:35:23.902, Speaker C: Guys, would you say the end game is to compete with other perps protocols on other chains or what I'm understanding about symphony? I mean, it feels like as these other perps protocols do well on other l ones and l two s, if the vision plays out here, you're like a mothership for perps trading on Kanto, but you're also able to access liquidity across these other mean. Do you feel this is more positive some? Or, like, do you have to ultimately compete with some of the perps liquidity that you're going to be aggregating?
00:35:24.046 - 00:35:56.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I can start off with that. And then most of you have anything to add. Feel free. So I would say that the cool part and interesting part about symphony is that symphony only grows and gets stronger as crypto grows and gets stronger. Essentially as perpetual protocols improve. And they will continue to prove, because overall perpetuals, decentralized perpetuals have some of the best PMF we've seen so far in crypto. As they improve and get better, symphony just gets stronger and gets more effective at finding the best traits across every single chain.
00:35:56.430 - 00:36:45.230, Speaker A: And the end goal with that is actually beyond just perpetuals. It comes into things like bridging, swapping, buying an NFT at the lowest price, getting the most yield for your ethereum, and different systems like that, which as crypto expands, these opportunities will become more, let's say, spread out across different chains, spread out across different protocols. And that's where symphony comes in. It kind of just makes everything just kind of come back together at some level and create this more equal competition between chains. So then there's no reason really to go and fork a protocol on a new chain because their chain can communicate. Your chain can already communicate with a different protocol, which is already doing the exact thing on a different chain. So it kind of creates this more hyper efficient system.
00:36:45.230 - 00:36:58.882, Speaker A: We keep saying inside crypto, where there's no reason to keep forking, there's no reason to make duplicate protocols, because every protocol is essentially talking with each other, and that's kind of the vision we see for cadence in the future and symphony and everything.
00:36:59.016 - 00:37:33.694, Speaker G: Yeah, I think one thing to add is if we were to think about where we see symphony in a year, year and a half, symphony is going to evolve more to almost like an infrastructure play. We've already been in talks with different wallet teams at major exchanges and different wallets of how can they, for example, integrate symphony in the backend to handle that aggregation type work where just in their wallet someone wants to do the long, okay, it's handled by symphony in the backend. So right now, of course, we have cadence perps, which is a retail consumer facing app. But as symphony evolves, we see that being more a backend infrastructure play, connecting these different protocols together.
00:37:33.812 - 00:37:48.434, Speaker B: Let's just talk a little bit about the cadence token. It's cad. Cad, yeah. What can you explain about that? It seems like it's set up for maximum value accrual, but yeah, what else can you tell us?
00:37:48.552 - 00:38:42.690, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So, yeah, CADs are token, and it's basically the core of what we're building everything around of one of the core tenants, we think inside DeFI, I'm sure you guys have seen as well, is the whole goal is to kind of to take away centralized parties away from the two other sides of the trade or two other sides of the lending market or whatever it is. And this basically is because these centralized parties make about 95% of revenue. Usually. A simple example people use in DFI law is that when you put your money in a savings account in traditional finance, they'll give you maybe like 1% APR max, but in the background they're obviously earning like 10% or something like that by rehabilitating your money. So that's one of the core tense of cadence as well. That's why we give like 100% of revenue distribution back to CAD stakers and liquidity providers on cadence.
00:38:42.690 - 00:38:45.314, Speaker A: So that's one of the big core tense of it.
00:38:45.512 - 00:39:04.090, Speaker G: And we see additional value recruit as we flow into symphony as well. For example, we have solvers coming to the network and in order to become a registered solver on the platform, you need to stake our token. So that's another form of demand. Solvers will get some of their fees paid back in the cadence token for supplying optimal trades and getting selected.
00:39:04.910 - 00:39:06.506, Speaker B: We get asked a lot about what.
00:39:06.528 - 00:39:34.830, Speaker G: Happens with malicious solvers, and this is also where cadence token plays in. So if a solver is staked and they were to supply a malicious trade or something that had a lot of MEV, then slashing would occur in which the cadence token they have staked up into our platform could face some level of slashing for providing some sort of suboptimal solution that was intentionally malicious. So yeah, we see a lot of interesting dynamics around the cadence token play forward with perps, but especially as we get into V two for Cadence Symphony.
00:39:34.910 - 00:40:18.066, Speaker C: Guys, I think this is a great place for us to start to wrap. So I want to remind our audience to first learn more about cadence by going to cadenceprotocol IO. They can follow cadence protocol on Twitter. They should also follow Vivaldi Zero X and Mozart Cadence. Those are Vivaldi and Mozart's personal Twitter accounts as well. And then guys just would love to end on what's next in the next six to twelve months. Any final bit of alpha you can share? When is the coin trading expected to go live? Also, when is symphony potentially going to go live? Anything else you can share?
00:40:18.168 - 00:41:14.830, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So some of the big things coming up shortly are we're doing a whole referral system we're launching this month where you can basically give your links out with your name, let's say like slash Defiedab, for example, and share that around and people can join in and you get a revenue accrual from them. That's going to be coming out this month. Next month is going to be the whole cadence stablecoin will be coin getting listed next month, and then after that will be just more RWAs and different systems coming in the next few months leading up to it, leading up to Symphony, essentially. Then Symphony will likely do the full launch will be in quarter three of this year, around July or June. We'll likely do like a private testnet beta. So if you guys are interested in that, feel free to reach out to cadence protocol, Twitter, or to us on discord and then yeah, definitely appreciate you guys having us on, letting us share some information on cadence.
00:41:14.830 - 00:41:17.490, Speaker A: And yeah, we'll see you guys in the future in person.
00:41:17.560 - 00:41:30.770, Speaker D: Again, thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at fourthrevolution capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
