00:00:00.330 - 00:00:33.640, Speaker A: Since maker Dow exists like in 2017 and 2018, this was the native way to go long, for example, on east die, and this was called recursive, boring and landing or looping. But here we're extending this concept by first automating strategies and by using flash loans, you can go tap into the very deep liquidity of money market.
00:00:36.170 - 00:01:13.314, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad and I'm here with nomadic from Fourth revolution Capital. Today's show spotlights a new perps trading product by the team at Contango called cperps. CPErPs are perps built through automating looping strategies using flash loans. When a trader opens a position, Contango borrows on a money market like ave swaps on the spot market, and then lends back to the money market. The net result is traders get the most liquid futures market in DFI with the least volatile funding rate. In this quick hit, we'll interview the cofounder of Contango about how CPerps work, including the benefits and tradeoffs of this new design in Contango v.
00:01:13.314 - 00:01:44.826, Speaker B: Two. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.

00:03:21.230 - 00:03:28.686, Speaker B: All right, so let's introduce Kamel Awan, the co founder of Contango. Kamel, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:28.788 - 00:03:31.470, Speaker A: Hey, all good. Thank you for having me here.
00:03:31.540 - 00:04:15.518, Speaker B: Yeah, I appreciate you joining us. So we're here to spotlight Contango V two, because there's been a major pivot that was made. Originally, Contango was about expirable futures on chain. And while I still believe there is product market fit there in the future, once DFI can mature more, I'm excited to talk with you about V Two, which is essentially a perps like product that is built through looping on Ave. But anyways, let's start with the usual and talk about your background. Could you tell us just a bit about what did you work on previous to crypto and then what would lead you to start building Contango in the first place?
00:04:15.684 - 00:05:08.030, Speaker A: Sure. It's been a while that I'm working with financial technology. I've been a consultant maybe for ten years. My co founders were also consultants with me in the same company. We built trading apps and also exchanges in crypto. We did a lot of algorithmic trading also, and we got into crypto, naturally. I think we were trading cash and carry strategies in CFI, mainly between Bitmex and Binance, and we wanted to apply those strategies in Defi.
00:05:08.030 - 00:05:23.550, Speaker A: And we looked for expert futures, experables futures, meaning like, we looked for dated futures, futures with an expiry date, and we couldn't find any. And this is how we got into defi.
00:05:23.630 - 00:05:28.514, Speaker B: Could you share more about why do folks seek out expirable futures?
00:05:28.642 - 00:06:08.050, Speaker A: There are very interesting products because you can have complete and total control over cost. When you enter an expirable futures for a given date, you know exactly how much you're going to pay. I think it's very interesting to go through an example. Let's say you have a spot market as 100. You have a futures market at 101. Let's say you want to hedge. You're hedging at 101 by selling, for example, a one year contract.
00:06:08.050 - 00:06:42.782, Speaker A: You know that after one year you will sell at this exact price, meaning that you have fixed your costs from the start to a 1% spread. And there is no surprise if you hold your position up to expiry, which is a big differentiator from a terp, where basically you have a variable funding rate running up to whenever you want to close your position.
00:06:42.916 - 00:07:43.906, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think specifically in crypto, we are subject to very unpredictable funding rates, very unpredictable fees. And so I think this actually dovetails into what we'll talk about with V two, because V two is still helping us to solve for more predictable rates. When you ultimately want to wind up a levered position, it's just taking a very different approach from V one. Anything else to share in terms of lessons learned from Contango v one? Again, I've already alluded to the fact that maybe the DFI markets just aren't mature enough yet for what are expirable futures, but also wondering, what other lessons did you take from that? And then maybe that'll lead us into talking specifically about Contango V two.
00:07:44.008 - 00:08:32.582, Speaker A: So maybe I can give a little bit of background on Tango V one and experables. We got into DFI and we built this Contango V one on experables because there were no explorable futures. Right. We went around and we asked different trading houses and different professional traders if this is a product they would be interested in. And the answer was yes. It's very interesting. I love to compare experts with options, because options also have usually an expiry.
00:08:32.582 - 00:09:40.200, Speaker A: I know there are some perpetual options out there in DeFi, but the main product is with expiries. And people wanted this ability to have an expiry date and to be able to control the cost. So we built that. We built that for them. We built that for a set of identified users, and we build that in a very innovative way to be able to open a position on an experiment. What Contango would do, the protocol would use fixed rate markets. The very simple way to explain it is that if you want to open a long position on ESDI, what the protocol would do is to borrow die at a fixed rate, swap die for east, and then land east out of fixed rate.
00:09:40.200 - 00:11:32.330, Speaker A: The thesis of contango was to provide doS instruments in a native way in DeFi, with like fixed rate markets already there in DeFi, and with the rules of Defi, meaning like smart contract and permissionless interactions. But the hard truth of any market or exchange is that you need liquidity and strong liquidity. So I will come back to your question on what did you learn along our journey? When we raised our first round and developed the product that was at the end of the bull market, the liquidity was very strong into the fixed rate. So I would take some example, like national finance, for example, was an extremely strong player with more than 1 billion into TVL. We computed the kind of liquidity that we could have on Contago using this TVL, and we found some numbers where the market impact, meaning like by how many percentage we would move. The market with big orders were as good as a player as binance. And that was when we were building the product and the bear market happened, and a lot of TVL from different projects vanished.
00:11:32.330 - 00:12:48.930, Speaker A: And this was really true also for the fixed rate market. So there were like two main integration of Contango, one with Guild protocol on arbitrum, and another one that we started to integrate with national finance. I don't know if the industry is not mature enough to say that the fixed rate is a strong product, but the industry was not mature enough. But it's true that fixed rate market did not find a product, market did not find a very strong usage. And with the two protocols I mentioned, we saw this issue occurring. National finance, we really love the product and the team, but the product was built on L one, which was really something normal at the end of the bull market. But nowadays this is not something normal anymore.
00:12:48.930 - 00:13:50.646, Speaker A: Those kind of products need to be on a layer too, to be able to attract a lot of different users. And especially, like for us, building like derivative, you need to have cheap transaction fees. So we waited for the integration on L one. We're really happy they're launching on L two on Arbitram. They are still in better mode, and we're looking forward to look at the liquidity there and see in which way we can integrate with them. But if we go back to the first integration yield protocol, you may have heard one week ago, they have decided to sunset their fixed rate product, which is the market on top of which Contango is built on. So one of the lessons is that the fixed rate market has not found a strong product market fit to go through the bear market.
00:13:50.646 - 00:14:00.718, Speaker A: And as a consequence, we never managed to have the liquidity we thought we would have when we started Contango on the experables.
00:14:00.834 - 00:14:46.262, Speaker C: Kamel that was actually like a great mini history on just kind of the fixed rate product market in DFI over the past few years. I want to switch into Contango V two now. Recently, the Contango Twitter account tweeted out what we thought was a pretty interesting approach to perps. And this will kind of represent the basis of Contango V two. So some of the highlights in that post were up to 20 billion in liquidity. That kind of solves your liquidity problem that you were just walking through, and 20 x less volatile funding rates. And then there's also a cheeky little note about early traders will be rewarded soon.
00:14:46.262 - 00:15:06.670, Speaker C: We can get into that a bit later, but maybe walk us through how all this is achievable and just kind of explain what's happening with Contango V two here, because it does seem like a novel approach to perps, and as you're calling them, c perps. So yeah, maybe walk us through that.
00:15:06.820 - 00:16:53.134, Speaker A: As I was explaining before, one of the biggest drawback of contango was the liquidity. But we have always been convinced that futures market could be built using the liquidity already available in DeFi on the money market. The construction of the futures between experals and CPRBs is fundamentally the same. We still use money markets, so for explorables we use fixed rate market, and for CPRBs, we're using variable rate market. So again, when you open a long position on Nisdai, this time, what we're going to do is that we're going to, for example, go on ave borrow die at a variable rate, swap, die for east, and then land east at a variable rate there. I would like to step back for a moment and really stress out that this construction to build position on leverage is something that had always existed in the world of defi, and this was called recursive borrowing and lending or looping. Since maker Dow exists like in 2017 2018, this was the native way to go long.
00:16:53.134 - 00:17:57.990, Speaker A: For example, on ease die. What people would do that? They would put ease as collateral, borrow die, sell die for east, run east again, borrow more die, swap, and do this loop several times. So the construction here is very interesting because it's the native way to go long or short on leverage in DeFi. But here we're extending this concept by first automating the strategies and by using flashlound. I will come back to this later if you want more detail. This has brought some very interesting properties. First, you can go tap into the very deep liquidity of money market, such as ave compound, morphel liquidity, park maker.
00:17:57.990 - 00:19:23.822, Speaker A: And when you aggregate this liquidity between spot market and money market, you come up with very strong numbers, such as 20 billion liquidity. Obviously you have some borrowing caps, but when you add the TVL available, we arrive at 20 billion plus. So that's really one big advantage, strong liquidity for curb trading. Then another very strong liquidity is about strong, sorry. Advantage of this construction is to have very, let's say, stable funding rate in the past that you've read, we have added the graph of our study where we have compared funding rate between contango built on top of dy, DX and Binance in the past six months. If you go long on ETH, USD. So USDC in DeFi, and you realize that with this construction, you have the least volatile funding rate, which means that when you get into a position, the average of the funding rate you get.
00:19:23.822 - 00:20:11.194, Speaker A: So for example, if you average is like, you have to pay 3% to open your position, you got to keep this 3% during the lifetime of your position. And the volatility around this 3% will not move a lot. Of course you're going to have spikes, as we see on AdE. But if you look over a long period of time, this will be quite stable, especially compared to DydX. Like, we're at least 20 x less volatile than Dydx, three x less volatile than binance. So that's like very strong properties of this construction.
00:20:11.322 - 00:20:40.646, Speaker B: Camille, I feel like you highlighted a lot of the benefits to us using Contango V two. Some of those, I think, stand in comparison to other perps platforms. Some of them just more generally speak to the advantages of using a perps like position through Contango. I'm wondering, what are the downsides, if any, or maybe what are the limitations of Contango V two that you would call out for potential users.
00:20:40.758 - 00:21:16.210, Speaker A: So this is where it gets, in my opinion, very interesting. On one side, I told you that this is the real og way to go, long or short, with leverage in defi. But at the same time, this is such a nascent field. Why? Because you have something interesting on leverage. For example, GMX is a really good example. GMX is a market leader. I think we all know the drawback of GMX.
00:21:16.210 - 00:22:40.270, Speaker A: Like for example, the losses, or even worse, the profits of traders are offset by DLT. Here you may wonder, in a very strong bull market, what could be the solvency of the protocol. And this is something that contango solves. But on the other side, they're really good at giving high leverage by construction. And this is the same thing from Quanta, and this is something that contango cannot compete with at the moment. One of the limitations is like, if you want to go along east die, maybe we're going to offer you maximum six x leverage. Why? Because of the limitation of the loan to value on ave, for example, you can have at liquidation, I remember correctly, is around 87%, which means that you cannot have more than six x leverage, and you will get liquidated with a maintenance margin at 15%, which is a bit tough compared to other exchanges such as binance or even dy DX.
00:22:40.270 - 00:23:26.400, Speaker A: That's one of the limitations. But there is something really new happening in defi at the moment. A lot of protocols are driving down their requirement on the collateralization ratio, which is they're giving like higher value for the loan to value, especially because we're in layer two. You can do liquidation much faster then there's more and more liquidity coming to layer two. But there are also new designs. One striking example is Morpho Morpho Blue. Maybe you have seen the tweet today.
00:23:26.400 - 00:24:04.566, Speaker A: They are like targeting some LTV at 83% 85%, which will give construction of our perps. With 20 x leverage, we will be competitive with a DYDX. So it's a very nascent shield to build perps on top of money market with some limitation. But I strongly believe that in the future those limitations are going away and will be fully competitive.
00:24:04.678 - 00:24:40.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree with a lot of the innovation we're seeing in money markets with exactly what you said, with LTV ratios going higher and kind of like these instantaneous liquidations happening, which kind of improves the uIux for users all around. One other area that I'd love you to speak to is just the liquidation threshold on something like CPerps versus something you were talking GMX before. How do those kind of marry up together? Are you seeing trade offs there as well, or.
00:24:41.370 - 00:24:41.782, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:41.836 - 00:24:43.158, Speaker C: What are your thoughts there?
00:24:43.324 - 00:26:28.870, Speaker A: There are two sets of users of contango at the moment. You can be a looper, and if you're a looper already using looping, recursive, boring and lending strategies, you will come tango because of the user experience, also because of automation and the fact that you can compare prices and let's call it funding fee, or what we call in Contango APR between different platforms, and those users will not be surprised by the LTV or the level at which they get liquidated. But then if you are a perp user, and if you are less of a dgen not trading with 20 x or 50 x leverage, you would appreciate coming on Contango and getting a more stable funding rate. And also on GMX, the thing is that you have different trading pairs which are mainly denominated in USD, even if there's some improvement there. But on containvo, you would have all the purse available on the underlying money market, and we can give you more exotic purse such as WBTC east or the Loop St. East east. So you would have like different markets.
00:26:28.870 - 00:26:32.394, Speaker A: That's the trade off between the two platform at the moment.
00:26:32.592 - 00:26:46.938, Speaker B: Kamel, so does this mean that we are currently limited to being able to long or short with CPerPs assets that are able to be borrowed on AAvE?
00:26:47.114 - 00:27:45.330, Speaker A: So this is where it comes back to my point before about this nascent industry and this nascent way of building perps on top of money markets. At the moment, the first integration is with AAVE. So you're limited on the borrowing lending assets that we have on Ave. Obviously, what we're doing is like we're extending that to more chains and more protocols. And what I love seeing in the space is also those money markets which integrate new designs where you can borrow and lend new assets in a permissionless way. And again, Morpho is a really good example. The new protocol allows you to list any asset.
00:27:45.330 - 00:28:21.498, Speaker A: So you can imagine that if there is an integration of contango on top of Morpho, as soon as any asset is listed there, you would have a perp. So that would allow us to have very reckless market on any new coins which could be traded permissionlessly. So that's the future. That's what we're aiming at. The first versions have their limitation, but again, we're live in five days. There's a lot of work to do, but you have the big picture.
00:28:21.674 - 00:29:11.738, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds like, to summarize for users that, as you put it, are degen, but not as Degen. They want to be long or short, something like ETH, and they want to be long or short for an extended period of time. In this case, no matter what, we don't have to worry about expirable dates anymore with Contango V two. But for those that have tried Gtrade or GMX or Quenta, we've actually covered all of them on the edge. Podcast now, or polynomial. These are fantastic for positions short term. You can get really high leverage on all sorts of different assets there.
00:29:11.738 - 00:30:21.326, Speaker B: But this is a question we at Fourth Revolution Capital, we've run into this a lot in this bear market talking about, okay, when do we really want to get long ETH again? And when we do, what's the platform that we're going to use? And if you look at these funding rates on these different platforms. You'll quickly realize you would just eat up your position if you were to use those. And so there's a very clear use case here for those of us, again, who want to get long or short for an extended period of time, and to be able to rely upon very deep liquidity from something like Ave. That for me is one of the biggest takeaways with Contango v. Two is we're not working with a counterparty like we are in GMX or GTrade, or in the case of synthetics, perps that powers Quinta. This is a much deeper liquidity source that is aave.
00:30:21.518 - 00:31:11.906, Speaker A: I think there are some interesting use case that I would like to mention, maybe like two of them. One is about what you said about which platform we can use to go long and have more stability on the funding fee. There are other integrations of contango with money markets, which are going to be interesting. Again, that's some strategies that already exist, but that we're going to be able to give to users with one click. For example, you can use loan position with liquidity. Liquidity is very interesting because you pay a one time borrowing fee. I think it's 0.5%,
00:31:11.906 - 00:32:03.540, Speaker A: if I remember correctly. So what you can do is use antagono built on top of liquidity, put some leverage on top of that. They have collect resettlement ratio at 110%. I think that we give you ten X leverage and then you will be insured of how much money you will lose on the borrowing cost for your position. So that's something very interesting. Another thing which is interesting in what you said, I think there is no secret that there is a lot of volume humming on quanta or polynomial because of rewards, especially like op rewards. Something very interesting with container is that we're building on top of money market.
00:32:03.540 - 00:33:13.318, Speaker A: And if you have a money market, which is for example on optimism, which gives you op rewards, you will also get op rewards by trading on contango. Build on a money market on optimism. And an example is exactly protocol will give you the op rewards. And on top of that, it's an interesting example because they will give you also the exactly token. So you would get paid to trade on perps by going through contango thanks to the rewards from the underlying money market plus the underlying chain market. And one of the big weapon of contango is that we can deploy on any EVM compatible chain. There is a lot of potential farming on the new chain plus on money markets where you can get the rewards.
00:33:13.318 - 00:33:37.038, Speaker A: And on top of that, if you start using interest bearing token, you will also get the interest from this token. So you can see that there are also some Djen play that you can do with this contraption which are not directly linked to very high leverage and very high risk of getting liquidated.
00:33:37.214 - 00:34:03.370, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm glad you highlighted some of those. I hadn't thought of any of those strategies, obviously not being nearly as in the weeds as you are of course building this. But I'm also curious just kind of I know what you've built with Contango V two is there's still a lot more to come, there's a lot more integrations, but what are you seeing as far as early sentiment and response to it so far that's very encouraging.
00:34:04.510 - 00:35:08.430, Speaker A: We got around 200 transaction and 1 million in trading volume less than five days. We got super nice feedback from people we didn't especially target, which we will not know were going to be users. They love the interface, especially people coming from defi server insteadap. There are users that are really used to do those looping strategies through those platforms, but never had the convenience to have a trading UI where they can have charts and have a clear indication of their liquidation price and have all the pairs where they can go long and short. So this is really encouraging because we feel that we're bringing something new to the space, but with the tools which were already there, there is a lot of gross potential.
00:35:09.010 - 00:35:49.382, Speaker C: Well done. And like you said, we've been familiar with kind of like this looping strategy and recursive borrowing for a long time in Defi, but I really hadn't seen anybody just put it in a nicely packaged UI and then bring it to market like this. So it's really cool to see. Also in your announcement tweet you mentioned something about early traders will be rewarded. I never like to assume, but to me it sounds like that could have something to do with an upcoming token. Can you elaborate on any of that? Is there token plans? Can you share any potential utility? If there is a token?
00:35:49.446 - 00:35:49.674, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:35:49.712 - 00:35:51.642, Speaker C: I'm making a huge assumption here.
00:35:51.696 - 00:36:52.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's pretty safe to say that there will be a token before releasing the exact mechanism. The plan is to go on more chains and more protocols so this way we can target a bigger user base. The goal is really to use the token to be more known and also to allow more users to use Compango. Obviously we have already some volume and all those users will be rewarded. This is something that we have always kept here in the team. Any volume that was done from the start from expert will be rewarded. I would be more than happy to come back and to give more details on the plan.
00:36:52.560 - 00:36:57.598, Speaker A: The goal right now is really to expand to more chains and more protocol.
00:36:57.694 - 00:37:20.418, Speaker B: Well, this is probably a good place for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind listeners that Contango V two is live. It's on arbitrum. You can go to Contango xyz to learn more. They should also follow contango here on Twitter. They can also follow Kamel. We've got his twitter handle there as well.
00:37:20.418 - 00:37:44.882, Speaker B: I'll give you the last word. Kamel, just again, thank you for being able to join us on such short notice. It's not been too long since V two launched, so it was nice to be able to cover this and be able to spotlight a newer design in Defi. So any other alpha two or just milestone you're willing to share about Contango this year?
00:37:45.016 - 00:38:37.650, Speaker A: We're definitely excited to be part now of this space and to offer our own flavor of perps. We do believe we're bringing something new. We do believe that this is construction that is defi native and this is something that we share and that we hope we be shared with a lot of people just to show that we can achieve a lot of things in a safer way with the tools that we already have and the liquidity that we have and we would keep building on top of that. If you're a looper, you will feel like home at Contango. Give it a shot. If you're a perb trader, also come have a look. You will enjoy lower funding fees.
00:38:37.650 - 00:38:47.250, Speaker A: You can come on app Contango XYz. Thanks for having me and hope to come back soon.
00:38:47.400 - 00:39:00.470, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
