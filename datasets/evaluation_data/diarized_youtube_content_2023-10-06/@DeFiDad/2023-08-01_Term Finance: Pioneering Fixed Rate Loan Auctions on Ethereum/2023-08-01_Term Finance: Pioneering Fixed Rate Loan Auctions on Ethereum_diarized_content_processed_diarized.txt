00:00:00.330 - 00:00:24.560, Speaker A: So we've heard from a lot of defi yield farmers. Sometimes they can't sleep at night because they don't know what's going to happen. Horror stories of people being on airplanes, not being able to reach their hardware wallet by the time they landed liquidated, you know, by giving you a fixed rate for a fixed amount of time and allows people who borrow to sleep well at night and not have to worry about, you know, what if a black spawn event happens and it.
00:00:27.770 - 00:00:28.134, Speaker B: Hey.
00:00:28.172 - 00:01:11.262, Speaker C: Everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad from Fourth Revolution Capital, and I'm here with my co host from four C nomadic. In this episode, we'll review a new noncustodial fixed rate lending and borrowing protocol, launching soon on Ethereum called Term finance. DeFi is known for its volatile variable interest rates. Term offers a next generation solution for a maturing defi market that demands more predictable fixed rates like those we find in traditional finance with term. Borrowers and lenders are matched through a unique, recurring auction process called term auctions. Borrowers submit sealed bids, and lenders submit sealed offers that are used to determine an interest rate that clears the market for participants of that auction.
00:01:11.262 - 00:01:31.820, Speaker C: Participants who bid more than the clearing rate receive loans, and participants willing to lend below the clearing rate make loans. We will dissect how all of this works and help you as defi users understand what's necessary to become a borrower or lender on term. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the Edge podcast possible.

00:03:11.230 - 00:03:49.990, Speaker D: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs, and today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account. If we zoom out. Since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial.
00:03:53.690 - 00:03:54.054, Speaker B: It.
00:03:54.092 - 00:04:35.230, Speaker E: All started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multichain UX. Redesigned from the ground up, the first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadap's powerful custom DFI strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:35.390 - 00:05:14.406, Speaker C: At Origin protocol DFI is an art form. Origin invented the yield bearing stablecoin in 2020 with OUSD delivering boosted stablecoin yield with unparalleled usability. No lockups, no wastage, no guesswork. Using Ousd's battletested code, origin launched oeth. Oeth is a liquid staking yield aggregator backed by ETH and LSTs. Swap for Oeth with rocket Pool's re Lido's Stef Frax's FRx ETH or ETH to earn top yield on ether with a 30 day trailing APY more than twice that of Steth. With Origin's best in class yield strategies, OeTh holders enjoy the best ETH yield in DFI.
00:05:14.406 - 00:06:16.238, Speaker C: Deposit any supported LST mint OETh and earn automatically with yield delivered directly to your wallet. To learn more about Oeth, go to oeth.com. Parcel is a decentralized perps amm where I can long or short real estate synthetics based on the median price per square foot in some of the most sought after cities in the world, meaning I can get exposure to real estate markets like Boston, Washington, DC and Chicago. For example, if I had parcel years ago and I was bullish on real estate prices in San Francisco, I could have longed parcel San Francisco index with a minimum of one USDC. Or if I had just bought a home and wanted to hedge against the price of our home crashing, I could have shorted the same real estate index. To learn more about parcel, go to Parcel CC slash edge. All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce Dion Chu, the founder of Term Labs.
00:06:16.238 - 00:07:00.386, Speaker C: Dion attended Cornell and later Harvard, where he became a teaching fellow and taught the principles of micro and macroeconomics. He went on to have an extensive career in traditional finance, working on trading desks on Wall street such as Jeffries and Capula. He would eventually start a small family office called orthogonal Asset Management. In 2022, he founded Term Labs, which is building the protocol term finance, a noncustodial fixed rate liquidity protocol for digital assets on Ethereum. Today, we'll be talking to Dion, all about his new venture at term labs and how term aims to match borrowers and lenders through a unique, recurring auction process common in traditional finance, but rebuilt and reimagined here in Defi. Dion, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:07:00.488 - 00:07:03.346, Speaker A: Thanks. Thanks so much for having me. Really excited to be here.
00:07:03.448 - 00:07:42.058, Speaker C: Term represents a sector of DeFi that we've been active in and following the last few years. If you want to classify it as, like, fixed income or fixed interest defi. And this is a sector of DeFi that we've always been very bullish on at four RC. But I would argue we've yet to see real product market fit. And so I'm hopeful that this is a part of the next major cycle in crypto and Defi. But Dion, you have an extensive background trading on Wall street. Can you tell us why that career in traditional finance led you here now to Defi?
00:07:42.154 - 00:08:34.094, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. As you mentioned, my career on Wall street was primarily as a government bond trader, trading US government bonds so deep in the rates market. And when I started my own family office, for the most part, I stayed within the realm of traditional finance. I think it was around the time of COVID when interest rates went down to zero, and I started hearing about these double digit yields in DeFi, that I started doing some more research looking into what was going on. So a crypto backstory bought bitcoin long time ago, back in 2012, was very much a bitcoin. Maxi didn't touch anything else. But when I saw what was going on in DFI, the ability to swap tokens, borrow and lend, it was just super interesting too.
00:08:34.094 - 00:09:22.080, Speaker A: So as part of that journey, I started advising various projects, both on the NFT side and on the DeFi side. And one of those advisory roles was serving as a Dow treasury manager. I think it was in that role where I started to notice the lack of fixed income product in DeFi. Right. As a former bond trader, fixed income product, largest market, largest financial market in the world. And the fact that it didn't exist in the DeFi space was just really puzzling to me. As part of that process, started looking at some of the existing protocols that had attempted to do both, borrow in the fixed rate space, but found that the product was suffering from scalability issues.
00:09:22.080 - 00:10:30.934, Speaker A: If you look at all of the existing protocols, at its core they rely on an AmM model. So kind of like a Dex pool, where LPs are required to deposit idle capital that sits in the pool waiting for transactions to show up, and in between, it generates no income. So the average return to LPs is quite low. And from the borrower's perspective, the way it works is a borrower deposits collateral into a smart contract, but rather than getting loan proceeds from that transaction, all they get is an ERC 20 token, where they then have to take the additional step of selling that token into the DEX in order to realize any stablecoin loan proceeds. So it's a two step process. And in that second step, because it is a Dex, they have the typical issue of contending with slippage. So in practice, if you try to borrow something like more than two or $3 million at a time from these fixed rate protocols, the interest rate quickly jumps from, say, 5% to six or 7%.
00:10:30.934 - 00:11:18.054, Speaker A: So it's not really scalable. From an institutional perspective, I think the key insight that I had, largely drawing from my experience as a former government bond trader, is the need to draw a distinction between primary markets and secondary market trade. So in crypto language, primary market is like an ICO. You're selling a token for the first time. There's a lot of supply, and secondary markets is what happens after a TGE event. Once a token is issued, you can trade them on exchange, trade them on Dex. Dexs were designed for trading volume on the margin, but not for selling large quantities of token at a single point in time.
00:11:18.054 - 00:12:23.334, Speaker A: And we think that matching borrowers and lenders in the fixed rate space is much more like a primary market activity than it is, like secondary market trading. And so finding a mechanism that's more suited to that was what was needed to make this model work. So, thinking back to my days as a government bond trader, I had participated in hundreds of US government bond auctions. Every month, the US treasury holds six bond auctions, selling at a time, up to 50, 60 billion of treasury notes in a single go. And every G seven country to this day still issues government bonds in the first instance, through an auction process. So the idea was to take that model and bring that on chain. And so that's what we created, an on chain auction where, at regular frequency, maybe once a week, borrowers and lenders can come together, submit levels of where they're looking to borrow or lend, and then, at a single point in time, we'll close all bidding.
00:12:23.334 - 00:13:21.482, Speaker A: And the smart contract will determine a single market clearing rate, where any borrower that's willing to pay at or above that rate will receive a loan, and any lender willing to lend at or below that rate will make a loan, in both cases, at that market claim rate. So even if you're willing to pay 10%, the market comes out at four, you only have to pay four. There's no penalty for overbidding. And these are all sealed bid auctions, so nobody sees the rate that you're willing to pay until after the auction closes. So people are incentivized to bid their true valuation. The long run vision here is that at steady state, there will be a token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year. And the idea is this would serve as a benchmark defi interest rate for where do loans in DeFi trade at every point in time, going out to one year.
00:13:21.616 - 00:13:43.662, Speaker F: So what you described sounds to me like a net new Defi primitive, with this new element of auction. So something that you've done in your past, over many years, it sounds like, and you're now bringing that to Defi as a way to match up lenders and borrowers that currently doesn't exist. Is that kind of right? Anything you'd add to that, Dion?
00:13:43.806 - 00:14:30.898, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. I think it's a new way of making markets or bringing people together to transact in Defi. Up to now, we've seen the Dex model standing liquidity, which is great, because you can access liquidity at any time that you're looking for it. But it is very capital intensive and is not the most efficient use of capital for LPs. We've seen attempts at order book models, which there are some scalability issues on chain to be able to accommodate true order books in a decentralized manner. And options are sort of a nice middle ground. It is like an order book, but it happens in batches at a single point in time.
00:14:30.898 - 00:14:55.898, Speaker A: So it actually is like a nice kind of compromise between the two opposing models of full border book and fully on chain decks. And I think a nice benefit of that is, especially when you're trying to match large volumes in auction, have been proven, theoretically to be one of the most efficient mechanisms of doing that.
00:14:56.064 - 00:15:50.378, Speaker C: Dion, can we start to talk through term finance? What are the major moving parts or the mechanisms that you need to understand? I think so far, you've clearly laid out, we have borrowers and we have lenders, we have an auction price, and we have an auction process that is coordinated on chain. All of this is automated by smart contracts. A lot of the benefits here of DeFi that I want to say we somewhat take for granted. It's really powerful here, because you're taking a fairly complex, middleman intensive mechanism in traditional finance, and you're bringing it on chain. So maybe you could start to talk us through what does it look like for us as users, if I'm a borrower, or if I'm a lender who's approaching using term finance in the future?
00:15:50.544 - 00:16:56.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a key thing to understand to start is that in early days, we will focus on over collateralized loans. So this is like Aave at compound. You have to put up significant collateral in order to borrow from the protocol, and the collateralization ratios will be very similar to what you'll find on variable rate protocols like AAVE and compound. So that's the first thing to understand. I think along with that, the liquidation mechanism is also based largely on ABe and compound, where your collateral is held in a smart contract, and if you fall below the margin requirement, then your tokens will be instantly liquidated. The liquidation mechanism is also very similar. Liquidators are provided with the liquidation incentive, where they will be able to purchase your collateral at a discount in consideration for repaying a portion of your loan.
00:16:56.094 - 00:18:00.386, Speaker A: One unique feature that we implemented is that we have liquidation limits. So a liquidator can only liquidate you to the point where your collateral returns to a healthy factor, plus a little bit of buffer, so you won't get fully liquidated as a result of a minor infraction. A second interesting difference is that unlike the variable rate protocols, where all of the collateral is held in a large, single commingled pool, the collateral in the term contracts will be segregated by matured. So you make a loan to a three month loan, then the collateral there is separate from all of the other loans that may have been deployed in the past. And so that provides a little bit more diversification of risk on the lending side. And as with all of these over collateralized loans, the rates are very low. So it's great for the borrower.
00:18:00.386 - 00:18:18.966, Speaker A: And as a lender, it's really targeted towards people who are concerned with capital preservation. If you're looking for Degen yields, this is not where you go. But if you are worried about preserving your capital, then we want to be there along with compound and aave as a safe place to put your capital.
00:18:19.078 - 00:18:23.530, Speaker F: Who are your target users with this sort of arrangement?
00:18:23.610 - 00:18:24.480, Speaker A: And then.
00:18:26.210 - 00:18:54.850, Speaker F: I think it's important just to kind of key in on the variable rate versus fixed rate a bit more. So, obviously, compound Ave have a floating interest rate. What you're bringing to the market is a fixed interest rate. Maybe outline some of the benefits and I guess some of the dangers in certain kind of like black swan events where a floating interest rate can really sort of harm a borrower or a lender.
00:18:55.010 - 00:19:52.938, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the important features that we're trying to bring is this fixed rate concept. There have been many attempts at it, and for the most part, variable rate product has worked very well in DeFI. But we have seen episodes around tail risk events, or black swan events, as you briefly mentioned, where you have these liquidity squeezes in DFI, where interest rates on these floating rate protocols will spike for up to a couple of days through 60, 70, 80% per annum apy. And when you are subject to that kind of borrowing costs, in the worst case, you might get liquidated. And even if you don't get liquidated, it could ruin whatever yield farming arbitrage trade that you had on, and you have no control over that. So we've heard from a lot of default yield farmers. Sometimes they can't sleep at night because they don't know what's going to happen.
00:19:52.938 - 00:20:52.590, Speaker A: Horror stories of people being on airplanes, not being able to reach their hardware wallet by the time they landed liquidated by giving you a fixed rate for a fixed amount of time, and allows people who borrow to sleep well at night and not have to worry about what if a black swan event happens and it throws everything out of whack? So I think that's a very important feature of fixed rate borrowing. And even for individuals who maybe you just want to borrow against your bitcoin you're a long term holder, but you want to make a home improvement, you want to fix your kitchen. It's nice to be able to borrow at a fixed rate for six months, whatever it is, and know exactly what it's going to cost you. At the end of the day, it makes it much easier for people to plan their expenses and how much they need to save up to repay the loan once they're ready to do so. So I think for both institutions and individuals alike, having the certainty and predictability of a fixed rate makes it a lot easier.
00:20:53.330 - 00:21:51.758, Speaker C: I think that's the key there is. The certainty and predictability is a part of defi maturing. As much as we're all grateful for the volatility and the excitement when the space is growing, the pie is growing, and there's a positive sum experience to that. But in order for defi to mature into the next generation of its growth, we need this predictability and certainty. This is why we were particularly excited when we first learned about what you're building with term Etherfi is a fundamentally new kind of staking protocol for Ethereum. Etherfi is the only protocol that allows stakers to retain control of their keys while delegating staking, and allows others to build services on top of delegated staking infrastructure. What makes Etherfi different? Etherfi is the only staking protocol where stakers retain control of their keys, which means that even if the protocol gets attacked or if the node operators get in trouble, you can always get your ether back.
00:21:51.758 - 00:22:52.210, Speaker C: Etherfi introduces a new fun way to stake called Ether fan, where you get rewarded the longer you stake. When you stake your ether with ether fi, you mint a provably rare nfT that you can use to earn membership points and get boosted staking rewards. Revenue from these services is shared between stakers and operators, which further boosts your staking rewards and node operator revenues. To learn more, go to ether phi and ether fan. Can we start to dive into just some of the nitty gritty as like a power user who might hop into term here once it's live on Ethereum main net? So first, I love the idea of being able to lock in a rate as a lender. This is something that, especially having just lived through a crypto bear market, a lot of those rates dropped. And so we as lenders and stablecoin markets, we would love to be able to lock in higher rates.
00:22:52.210 - 00:23:19.078, Speaker C: So if I'm willing to lend and I'm matched with a borrower through the auction process on term, I guess what decides programmatically what capital gets used to be lent to those borrowers. Like, what if there's an excess supply of capital? Or on the flip side of that, would also like to talk about what if there isn't enough capital supplied and the loan is not going to be issued?
00:23:19.174 - 00:24:34.446, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. So now, talking about the auction mechanics, at the end of the auction, after everybody submitted the amounts that they're looking to lend and the interest rates at which they're willing to do so, we will find that market clearing price where supply meets demand, and we will assign fills based on the most willing to lend. So people who are willing to lend for the cheapest and fill it going up in order. And on the borrowing side, we will fill those who are most willing to pay first and then kind of downwards. And then if there is excess demand or supply at the marginal rate, then everybody who submitted a loan to lend at the same price will be filled pro rada on the margin. So if we get down to the final few, the last marginal rate, and there's only 100,000 of demand, but 200,000 of supply, then each of the lenders will get 50% of an allocation versus relative to what they submitted to lend. It's very common, the same as it works in the US treasury auctions.
00:24:34.446 - 00:24:38.550, Speaker A: They call it a pro rata on the margin allocation methodology.
00:24:39.050 - 00:25:09.786, Speaker C: Now, when it comes to these auctions and the terms for loans that are going to be auctioned off, who decides that is something they're programmed in? And do we vote on that as a Dow? Do we have folks full time who are, I guess, figuring out and trying to model out what are the best terms to offer in terms of those loans? Is it the borrower that suggests that and requests a certain term?
00:25:09.898 - 00:25:50.426, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. Early days, it'll be determined by the core team. We're in talks with all of our potential users. What do you want? What are you looking for? What kind of terms work for you? But the idea is that in the long run, if we have a Dow, the goal would be to allow new pairs, new terms to be deployed based on dao governance. But in the short term, as we're kind of bootstrapping, it will be determined by the core team. But if anybody has ideas, love to hear your input, because they're always trying to figure out, obviously, what has the most demand. Right? That's what the goal is at the end of the day.
00:25:50.528 - 00:26:01.038, Speaker C: Are these borrowers, are they over or under collateralized? And if over collateralized. How much collateral do they have to put up for the loans that they take out?
00:26:01.124 - 00:26:23.926, Speaker A: Yeah, these are all over collateralized loans. So just like Abe and compound. And the collateralization ratio is going to be identical to what you'll find on Abe and compound as well. So if it's, say, ethereum or rapstick eat, we would require 125% for every dollar borrowed on the platform.
00:26:24.108 - 00:26:32.870, Speaker F: Dion, can you speak a bit to the term repo token and how that fits into the protocol and kind of like, what functions does it serve?
00:26:32.950 - 00:27:13.960, Speaker A: Yeah. So what happens at the conclusion of an auction is the borrower will receive his loan proceeds directly from the protocol, and lenders will receive ERC 20 tokens. They call them repo token. They're essentially receipt tokens that the bar a lender will use to redeem for principal plus interest. At matured, it'll typically be normalized to be redeemable one for one with the underlying purchase token. So the idea is it would trade like a discount note some fraction of a dollar converging to a dollar as you get closer to the maturity date. And also, one thing I want to clarify, I think sometimes a lot of people are confused about this.
00:27:13.960 - 00:27:28.070, Speaker A: We need to do a better job of clarifying. But these loans are peer to pool, so you're not lending and borrowing from a specific individual. All the lenders are going to the pool and all the borrowers are borrowing from that same pool.
00:27:28.150 - 00:27:46.686, Speaker F: And so at the time that we're filming this, you're currently live on Ethereum mainet, in what you're calling a guarded launch, I believe. How have these early auctions gone? Are you happy with the results? Are you finding like you're competitive with other borrowing platforms?
00:27:46.798 - 00:28:31.280, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. So we had run a testnet for about twelve weeks, make sure we ironed out all of the issues. We launched this guarded launch on Mainet just to make sure that when you switch between Testnet and Mainet, there's always some configurations that you forget to make. So the first two options, we limited the size of the bids and offers allowable on the protocol to make sure if anything goes wrong that it would be a manageable loss. Luckily, everything went smoothly. We held our first full term four week auction two weeks ago, and the results are very interesting. The first auction full term auction cleared at three and a half percent.
00:28:31.280 - 00:29:00.454, Speaker A: So that's right around the midpoint of where Abe's supply and borrow rate is. So it's great. The lenders are getting paid a little bit more than what they would supplying, and the borrowers are paying a little bit less than what they would pay on a variable rate protocol, and they're locking that in for a four week period. So overall, it's as expected. It comes somewhere in the middle. You don't have that slippage or spread issue. So we're pretty happy with the results.
00:29:00.454 - 00:29:07.402, Speaker A: And now it's just about slowly rolling out access and getting this to the public.
00:29:07.536 - 00:30:24.386, Speaker C: Dion just a few years ago, my wife and I bought our first home. So this is really recent for me in the last like five years of my life. And at the time, Defi was taking off, and I was really excited about the possibility that I might be able to open up a loan on chain. I think I knew in my heart of hearts it probably wouldn't work because they were variable rates and we were looking at historically low mortgage rates for single family homes, at least in the US. That said, anytime I think about term or any sort of fixed term lending in defi, I can't help but start to think about that long term. How long does it take before we start to see something like a mortgage show up on chain? How long of terms are you offering now and expecting to offer, at least in the first year, versus how long of terms do you hope to offer in the next few years? Are you thinking multi year terms are going to come sooner? Maybe a better question is what needs to happen in order for term to offer longer term loans? Something on the order of many years?
00:30:24.568 - 00:31:10.900, Speaker A: Yes, a great question. In the short term, we'll be focusing on one year and under. As you guys know, in Defi, one year is like the third year bond in tradfi. I think over time we'll get to a level of maturity where you have lenders that are native to the on chain world being willing to make loans for longer periods of time. I think a key blocker for that is liquidity. Most of the time when you buy a 30 year bond and lend to the government for 30 years, you always have the option of selling that bond if you need cash sooner. And so there is some liquidity, there's some volatility associated, but at least there is an out.
00:31:10.900 - 00:31:37.270, Speaker A: I think it's very hard for anybody to commit to 30 years and not being able to see that money for 30. But if we can have a secondary market that allows people to have some sort of extra liquidity if they need it, then that would be kind of the missing piece. I think it will take some time, but we're definitely moving towards that direction. And we're hoping that term is sort of that first step towards longer dated loans on chain.
00:31:37.350 - 00:31:58.350, Speaker C: Dion, when do you think we might see that secondary market launch? And if anyone's listening to this in the future and they might want to get involved, I guess, what would you suggest? What's the profile of users that you think might benefit near term by getting involved in term finance?
00:31:58.510 - 00:32:56.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the first thing is we need to get to a level of volume cleared through auction that reaches some sort of minimum size that is meaningful to market makers. Ultimately, the market makers make money based on trading volume. And with fixed income, the volatility is way lower than you'll find with something like Ethereum or even more so, like an altcoin. So in order to get market makers interested in the fixed income market, you need magnitude larger trading volume so that the volume makes up for the lower spreads you're making on a less volatile product. So I think the first step is just making sure that there can be a lot of loans matched on chain. We saw QTube last year. Genesis and Galaxy originated over 80 billion in fixed rate loans through a CFI mechanism.
00:32:56.690 - 00:33:12.730, Speaker A: And if we can get to that level in DFI, then I'm sure there will be plenty of market makers interested in making markets. But I think it's kind of a chicken or the egg issue. First, we got to get the volume. Once the volume is there, then I think the market makers will come.
00:33:12.880 - 00:33:46.406, Speaker C: So, Dion, this is probably a good place for us to wrap up. I want to remind listeners that they can learn more about term finance by going to termfinance IO. They can follow term labs on Twitter, which is labs. And then I want to give you the last word on any other sort of call to action to learn more about term. Maybe you could reiterate for us, when do you expect or anticipate that the protocol will go live?
00:33:46.588 - 00:34:08.198, Speaker A: Yeah, so, as you mentioned before, we're currently in the guarded main net space, and we're targeting to open everything up to the public first or second week of August. So if you follow us on Twitter, follow us on our, you know, we'll have updates for you and we'll be announcing that as we get closer.
00:34:08.374 - 00:34:47.378, Speaker C: Awesome stuff. Well, Dion, thank you for being able to join us and walk us through this. I think, again, we, as power users of Defi have been really excited for this sector, and I think that this auction process that you're bringing on chain has been one of the missing puzzle pieces. So really excited to potentially lend myself, but maybe I'll one day qualify to be a borrower on there. I just got to grow the Defi dad portfolio a bit more, I think. So thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital.
