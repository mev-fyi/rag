00:00:02.880 - 00:00:03.430, Speaker A: You.
00:00:05.640 - 00:00:42.028, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This is DFI talks with DFI. Dad, it's Thursday, December 2, 2021. I'm joined here today by Lawson Baker, who is the founder of RA is a like to earn protocol. It is a new protocol that just launched. Full disclosure to I, as a part of the fourth revolution capital fund for RC, we invested in their seed round, but part of the reason we did is because I was talking with you, Lawson, about this radical idea he had to again allow people to like to earn.
00:00:42.028 - 00:01:17.240, Speaker B: And so we're going to talk about how the protocol works. This is an idea that really empowers the curators with web3 and rewards you for doing things like liking nfts. Having just launched, they have this race which is, we'll talk about where the name comes from, but it relates to raw ing or liking different NFTs. And anyways, it's just been a total blast. It costs zero gas. And we're going to show you how that all works and how you can participate totally for free. So, Lawson, welcome.
00:01:17.240 - 00:01:18.388, Speaker B: Thanks for joining.
00:01:18.564 - 00:01:20.650, Speaker A: Rah rah. Thanks for letting me come.
00:01:21.100 - 00:01:35.890, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. How has the launch, obviously, we've been in touch and I've been participating in this, but just as a founder getting this off the ground, how has it been nerve wracking or everything going?
00:01:36.820 - 00:02:18.684, Speaker A: We've done launches before of different iterations and this one was honestly the chillest. We learned throughout the experience. We've had beta users for a while got away from building in isolation and kind of working with users along the way. And so this really is more, from a technical standpoint, it was less of like, oh, we just finished making it, here it is. And it was more of like, we've iterated on a while with a whole bunch of users and now we're telling the public about it. And so we were in this kind of private beta period. And so yesterday was super dope because we launched it with really no press.
00:02:18.684 - 00:03:00.760, Speaker A: It was just started talking about it publicly on Twitter. And the part of the process of getting into and joining Rah Rah and the NFT race is really this kind of social experience. And so yesterday was awesome. We had about 1000 ish wallets connect and people joining the race and kind of figuring out what was going on, joining the community, joining the server. And it was cool. It was a really good vibe. There was like, rah rah phonetically is a cheer.
00:03:00.760 - 00:03:33.670, Speaker A: And that kind of is this celebratory kind of nature. And it was cool to kind of see that start to come out publicly because it was coming out of the beta users and people were starting to get this idea of effectively cheering on your favorite NFTs. It's cool. So it's kind of cool to watch that. And honestly, waking up this morning, I pulled up the server and the server is normally pretty active, but it was just like, it was just blowing up with activity. And so that's exactly what you want. Like, you want chatter, you want people to come in there, care.
00:03:33.670 - 00:03:37.940, Speaker A: And that's kind of what I saw this morning. And so that was really cool. Yeah.
00:03:38.010 - 00:04:15.650, Speaker B: I think a part of the reason that you've had this vision to build a like to earn protocol too, is you've been in the crypto space for a long time. You've lived through multiple bull and bear cycles. I know you really buy into that fundamental ethos of building a decentralized Internet. So I'd love for you to talk more about your background first. Just kind of like help everyone come up to speed on some of the other companies you've worked on, startups you've worked on in the space, and then more about what led to the founding of RA.
00:04:16.340 - 00:04:52.450, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So just most recently, I was at Token software. We were building and emulating financial assets on blockchains, predominantly like security tokens, along with tooling and different blockchains, and helping with token distribution. So Tezos, Sedera, Hashcraft, handshake, keeps, synthetics, you name it, did a number of those. And before that, I was part of the founding team of Synapse Fi, which was the first banking API in the US in 2014 and 15. And our first customers were crypto exchanges and bitcoin apps. Ethereum wasn't really a thing then.
00:04:52.450 - 00:05:34.280, Speaker A: It was all bitcoin apps. And so things like Abra and remittances or changetip and tipping. People on Reddit and Twitter were kind of the startups of the time. It was that or exchanges. And for me at Synapse, that was kind of the moment where I first not only had heard of crypto in the upswings, more like was started to figure out what was going on. And what it came down to for me is at Synapse, it was kind of a fintech idea deal flow engine. As an API company, we're a service provider to all of these other financial applications.
00:05:34.280 - 00:06:02.070, Speaker A: And we started having two segments of customers. We had fintech customers and crypto ones. And at the end of the day, the fintech ones were like pretty apps on top of banks, while the crypto ones were just scrapping the stuff on the bottom layer of the banks and doing something new. They needed to get people access from their money into crypto. But after it was in the app, it was fair game. Literally, what could the technology do is what they were trying to do. And so I couldn't unsee that.
00:06:02.070 - 00:07:05.736, Speaker A: That's why I left synops and started going full time into crypto. And effectively that was essentially two fintech, one not in crypto, but servicing crypto, one more crypto E but still kind of a service provider, b, two B type thing. What it kind of realized is early last year is we had spent ten years getting ready for kind of normal users. And the tech has always kind of struggled to be understandable and digestible and also usable along with tech necessary for developers to do their thing, just really wasn't there. And for me, early last year, it felt like it was time to go out to consumers. And specifically, I felt like there was something happening in society that was changing, that effectively gave this opportunity to really introduce crypto in new and novel ways. And so I left Tokensoft March of 2020 and started working on what was money mail, but now is Ra.
00:07:05.736 - 00:07:51.960, Speaker A: And the idea at the time was simply to turn engagement into money. The act of liking should be valuable. Creators were working for free on the Internet, and all the money was going out to advertisers in Facebook. And there was these somewhat quasi attempts at to getting them paid, like giving them a substac or Patreon and get some gifts or something like twitch where you can do like paid emotes and stuff like that. And all those things were kind of working, but it was still always value extractive. It was like, take the money from the user, give a little bit to the creator, and give the rest to twitch or Facebook. And in crypto, that's not how we operate.
00:07:51.960 - 00:08:34.828, Speaker A: We don't think of extraction, we think of effectively economies. The cool thing about protocols is all the money in and of itself, the user is the consumer, worker and investor. They have the tokens, they're using the things. I started reframing the idea of turning paid engagement into thing to effectively liking, to earn. In crypto, every action is an investable action. And that's kind of what the NFT race represents. The NFT race allows for you to like NFts.
00:08:34.828 - 00:08:48.920, Speaker A: You're doing that with Ross, our governance token. But by liking that NFT, you're essentially investing in the virality of that NFT. And that's very different than buying the NFT. And I'll pause.
00:08:50.460 - 00:09:07.408, Speaker B: No, this is a great setup for, I think, actually showing this off because I was about to ask you more about, again, really, what are we trying to accomplish with this as a mission? But let's just show it. It's really cool. It's easy to understand.
00:09:07.574 - 00:09:11.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll answer that question first. Or maybe we can answer it last. We can come back to it.
00:09:12.520 - 00:09:44.296, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, so I can put up your screen if you want to start sharing that. Let's talk through that, because what you've started with the RA, we always joke around about how to pronounce it the NFT race. This is not like what is expected to happen every single day across web3. There is an opportunity. This is us getting the protocol started.
00:09:44.398 - 00:10:07.588, Speaker A: But this is the start of a conversation. Exactly. This is the start of a conversation. The end goal is we're trying to create cross platform, portable Facebook likes. That's the idea. And implicit in that it will cost money to like something. But the act of doing that again is an investment in the virality of the something.
00:10:07.588 - 00:11:13.912, Speaker A: And so the primitive we're trying to create is actually on top of NFTs. We're trying to give normal users, people who aren't ETH whales, the ability to kind of invest in this stuff as well. How do you say you like an NFT that's not for sale? Or how do you say you like an NFT that's too expensive for you to buy? Implicit in that again, is like, how could you make a little money off of that? And so with the NFT race and how the protocol will work, the way you make money is effectively, you need to like NFTs that you think other people will like, and you need to do it early. You'll see sometimes on like viral Twitter posts or Instagram posts, you'll see someone just reply in the comments first. And what they're trying to do is they're trying to timestamp. I saw this thing first and I was pretty convinced it was going to be popular. There's a lot of people on the Internet that are actually really good at finding stuff.
00:11:13.912 - 00:11:48.930, Speaker A: Like you probably have a friend who always discovers new artists and new songs and they're just good at it. That's their thing. Pre Ra and pre kind of what's happening in web3. There was actually no way to make money doing that. It was just a hobby. It was a novelty that they could find good songs. And so the way that the NFT race works, and so I'm actually looking at it right now if you're seeing my screen is every day, Wednesday through Friday, noon to four eastern, the race kicks off.
00:11:48.930 - 00:12:16.220, Speaker A: As you can see here, there are a number of NFTs on the page. And different curators have essentially entered these NFTs into the race. And everybody else who wants to like that NFT. All these fans down here are investing Raz on the NFTs they think will win. And so right now, over here on the left, we have. It's ready. Has curated this super dope.
00:12:16.220 - 00:12:20.190, Speaker A: I can actually play it. I don't know if you can hear my screen. Let me know if you can.
00:12:23.680 - 00:12:31.644, Speaker B: That's cool. That was my favorite. For what it's worth, it was already number one, but I was dope.
00:12:31.772 - 00:13:13.676, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like totally leading the pack. So for launch week, we're giving all the curators themes. And the theme today was what is art? So you see here, it's Freddie. He said, art is not only about pictures, music or poetry. Life experiences acquire value and it gets stored only if they become memories. Art is whatever speaks and decodes the language of memories, sucking away our everyday life nonsense, waking up our inner child. And that kind of represents what the race represents, is this idea of discovering new and exciting things.
00:13:13.676 - 00:14:02.610, Speaker A: A lot of people coming into web3 are doing it because it's fun to see new stuff. And there's people who come for the tech, and those are the early crypto adopters. But what NFTs represent and what a lot of what's happening in web3 is people are coming for cultural movements. The thing I like to say a lot of times is nobody got on the Internet in the 90s because they wanted the modem. They got on the Internet because they heard about email and they heard you can meet people in chat rooms. And that's kind of what nfts represent. Today, they're getting in web3 because there's all this cool art and you can own it on the Internet and you can kind of pick it up and collect it and you can change your profile photo to a crypto punk or whatever.
00:14:02.610 - 00:15:09.830, Speaker A: And so kind of the next phase of that is like, okay, what do you do with these NFTs? How can these NFTs maybe make a little money? And how can you get broader society opinion on the NFT? We like to think of the NFT race a little bit like the Rotten Tomato. Movie reviews today on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews, you have two scores, you have critic score and you have fan score. And the critic score is just anybody with a platform. They work for New Yorker or some sort of website that reviews magazines. While the fan score is really just anybody with access to the Internet. And today, NFTs, we really kind of only have critic score every bid and the final price you actually see bids on these things, on some of these is effectively the critic score. But how do we get broader fan consensus on that? And so that's what the race is and that's what our like to earn curation protocol is trying to create.
00:15:09.830 - 00:15:14.100, Speaker A: What does society think about this thing? Is it culturally relevant?
00:15:14.680 - 00:15:30.504, Speaker B: Yeah, because if you're participating in this race, for example, you can go in and when you. So the first thing you have to do is you connect your wallet. I don't think you have to.
00:15:30.542 - 00:15:30.744, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:30.782 - 00:15:32.510, Speaker B: You can link your Twitter account.
00:15:32.880 - 00:15:37.500, Speaker A: You do need to link your Twitter. We're doing that to kind of prevent people from farming.
00:15:38.640 - 00:15:39.372, Speaker B: There we go.
00:15:39.426 - 00:15:40.124, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:40.322 - 00:16:08.010, Speaker B: So you're linking your Twitter account, which is really easy. It asks you to copy and paste a link or follow a link anyways. Once you do that, you do all of that and you pay. No gas. There's no gas involved in any of this, actually, that we're showing here, which makes us, of course, much more fun. You can basically participate risk free. It's a game of seeing whether you can like something before others do.
00:16:08.010 - 00:16:42.720, Speaker B: The point here, Lawson, I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this. I'm being rewarded if I liked, let's say, the one that's in first place, if I was the first one to like it, or one of the first few, or in the top, I don't know, 500. Since it has 1800 raws now, that means I'm demonstrating better taste than others versus if I'm a late comer. I mean, I still might benefit, but I'm not earning as much raw because I'm late to the game.
00:16:42.870 - 00:17:03.444, Speaker A: Yeah. Or late to the content. Late to the content. It's a little bit different. When was it entered in the race? Yesterday. There were two curators who curated after the race launched. And you would think that that would mean that that's like starting late and they would lose.
00:17:03.444 - 00:17:25.650, Speaker A: But one of them was done by Robinis and it was a super cool piece and ended up being, like, third or fourth. And so it went from 16th to third or fourth pretty quick. And so it's more like being early to like the NFT in the context of when it was entered into the race. Very similar to when did the tweet occur. Right.
00:17:27.780 - 00:17:48.952, Speaker B: One follow up there. I know that I've seen some asking in YouTube comments is if they join right now. If I were to join this, because I'm actually in the race right now, there's 2 hours and 23 minutes left in it. If I join, all I can do is raw or like things at this point.
00:17:49.086 - 00:17:49.576, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:17:49.678 - 00:17:53.560, Speaker B: To be a curator, how do you get approved to be a curator?
00:17:57.500 - 00:18:51.560, Speaker A: So we launched with Genesis curators. So ten of those Genesis curators came from the community of beta users, the ones that were kind of the best and had the best reputation for good taste in the community, which we'll get to in a second, earned a Genesis curator NFT. And we also gave ten away to kind of known curators in the space that were good at that are just known for discovering and bringing up awesome art. And then we also have ten for sale on Ra Mirror XYZ. And I think two of those got collected last night. So there's eight left. This NFT right here is a collectible, but it's also the only time you'll be able to buy a curator roll.
00:18:51.560 - 00:19:24.260, Speaker A: There's only ten that are going to be sold out of, out of the total of 30. But in the future, if you didn't want to buy this, you can't afford this. You can earn the right to curate. And the way that works is that's actually what the leaderboard is. The leaderboard is ranking everybody that's playing the game and investing Roz by tastes, which is very different than ranking them by how much they're earning. These people are definitely earning Ross. They're good at it.
00:19:24.260 - 00:20:23.448, Speaker A: But taste is a little bit different metric. And specifically the way taste works is do you invest Raz in an NFT before people with higher reputation taste reputations than you? Or are you traditionally kind of following the investments of other people with high taste scores? For example, if Zach has 895, if I'm pretty good at investing in things and Zach always follows me, then my taste reputation is going to go up. Or the reverse is if I'm always investing after Zach, then on the NFTs that end up performing very well, then my reputation, I'm more of a follower than a leader. And so we're using this leaderboard, this taste leaderboard, to essentially over the month of December, new curators will come out and start coming out in January based off of the taste score. So you'll be able to earn the right.
00:20:23.534 - 00:20:24.168, Speaker B: Cool.
00:20:24.334 - 00:20:29.390, Speaker A: But you have to do that by kind of showing that you're good at finding good stuff.
00:20:30.320 - 00:21:14.296, Speaker B: Yeah. And I do want to call out too. There's a reward here for obviously being attentive to participating, to being an early adopter, because I could show up at the end of a race and I'm not going to be able to prove which one of these I would have been able to pick out before others. So I like that aspect of it. It's just rewarding all sorts of good behavior. And this is just the start with the race, because yesterday I mentioned being very active in the parallel trading card community. I was like, we talk about which cards are the best.
00:21:14.296 - 00:21:32.720, Speaker B: The artwork is incredible. We could actually figure it out with Ra eventually. Like, we could use this as a protocol to figure out who has taste amongst us and then also what are the actual favorite cards just by that sort of raw voting mechanism.
00:21:33.060 - 00:22:20.588, Speaker A: Exactly. We were doing prompts every day this week for launch week, but going forward it'll kind of just be a general, like curating whatever is interesting to the curators that day, with Fridays being the day of prompts. And so we could totally do that. Over time, as we have more users and more curators, it's likely that we would start to have themes. So there could be categories like the best music NFT of the day, the best art NFT of the day, best generative art NFT today, you name it, playing cards, it could definitely head into categories. And that's part of when we bring on more curators. People have different interests, me personally as a collector, and the things I like is I tend to collect a lot of things that have audio elements to it.
00:22:20.588 - 00:22:49.924, Speaker A: It's visual, it's MP4. Maybe it just has a little bit of sound, or it's an entire song, a music video. And so for whatever reason, we actually have a large number of curators frequencies, actually one that are music artists or just that's their thing too. Being able to discover new songs is something that could happen on Ra, specifically new NFT songs. That's interesting. That's valuable.
00:22:49.972 - 00:23:23.804, Speaker B: I think there's one more, I think, really practical question here, which is if I join and I participate and I'm earning taste and raw, how do I ultimately claim my rewards? And what is that right now, I checked in today and I had earned some raw, but I also had earned some taste. Since this is a like to earn protocol, what actually will happen in the future in order for me to collect my earnings?
00:23:23.932 - 00:24:28.488, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you click on your profile at the top right, your raw balance and your profile photo, you'll see you have your taste up here, which have a little explainer of how that works which that number can't be bought, can only be earned, and can only go upwards over time based off of if you're good at it or not. And then inside of your wallet, you see you have a raw balance and you even have a verify button. And so to make the race accessible and not kill people on gas, we're actually batching results on chain to update your balance. So at the end of every race we update a merkle tree route that allows for you to verify what your balance is on chain. And so last night was actually the first time we did that. And so you'll see at the end of each day it's taking a little second here what your balance is.
00:24:28.488 - 00:25:09.632, Speaker A: And as you invest throughout the day, this number can go up or down, right? And so obviously if you're good at the race, it'll go up. But what you're doing is you're actually proving how many of our community governance tokens you'll be able to claim in the future. So this is very similar to Audius or even mirror write tokens. This token is really only usable inside of the app. And the purpose of this token is to reward people who are good at curation. Those tokens, however, will be redeemable when we go out with our full blown protocol early next year. Raw tokens will be redeemable into our eventual governance token.
00:25:09.696 - 00:25:31.064, Speaker B: Ra anything you want to reveal about the tokenomics or anything you want to talk about that future governance token that would be basically redeemed with the raw and then, sorry, also I might have screwed this up. The taste is not redeemable, right? The taste is something you accrue.
00:25:31.112 - 00:26:23.484, Speaker A: Just as you can only earn reputation, you can't buy reputation. That taste is probably the most experimental thing in our app. We want to work with the community over time to probably modify how that formula works, and we're likely going to even how the curation investment formula works. Just like how uniswap is always optimizing for more efficiency in their liquidity pools, RA would do the same for this investment. Like we want to make it a little bit more fairer, a little bit more accessible, a little bit more cleaner, efficient. That taste score is something that will be on chain as well. Again, the person who said first to that Twitter post, there's no reputation system for them.
00:26:23.484 - 00:27:16.430, Speaker A: All the reputation systems on the Internet are for creators, not for curators. And there's a good argument that now that the Internet has so much information, there's too much information, and the next class of influencers will be essentially curator influencers, and we're seeing early indication of that with literally NFT collectors. They are by default the things they buy. Curators, RA's electoral protocol and the NFT race broadens that curator class of people to really, anybody with accessible access to the Internet. You don't need ETH to participate in NFT race. This is not going to cost you a lot of gas. You can come with your own wallet like metamask, or you can create a wallet with an email on RA.
00:27:16.430 - 00:27:32.880, Speaker A: And in doing that, you could earn your first crypto. Kind of the core belief, the core understanding that we have is it's likely someone will like an NFT before they'll ever buy an NFT. And the way you do that with Rah Rah is simply Ryan.
00:27:34.180 - 00:28:52.124, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just such a cool. Whenever. I can't remember when we first talked about this, which was probably four or five months ago, I just was instantly drawn to it because I think it rewards a skill set that's very valuable in our community. It cleverly does that, of course, using what will be a decentralized protocol and something that I have personally found insufferable, even though I'm obviously part of the NFT web3 community, is do we really just want to listen to people who are insanely wealthy talk all day about the shit that they bought? I mean, it's just insufferable to listen to some people who really don't have good taste but have a tremendous amount of eager, continually buy stuff. I appreciate them evangelizing, I appreciate them being a community member. But it's a different skill set to be able to curate. And like you pointed out, it's more likely that anyone is going to like something before they buy it.
00:28:52.124 - 00:29:35.720, Speaker B: I mean, really, isn't that what happens whether you're in the old world of art or this new world of NFTs? You get drawn in because something is visually stimulating. It's just cool. Something about it draws you in. So if you can like something without it actually costing you something other than your time and a little bit of effort, I think that's really cool. This actually could reward folks who have a skill set curating and then also that skill set because they're earning from it, they might then be able to buy NFTs they never would have been able to afford.
00:29:36.300 - 00:30:07.376, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Again, the Internet is a beautiful levelizer. It doesn't matter where you are, what you look like, you're in the game. You can be anything on the Internet right and the thing about Rah Ra and kind of what we're doing here is we're levelizing the game of NFTs. You can invest in the virality of NFT without the NFT owner's permission. Again, this is a very crazy concept.
00:30:07.488 - 00:31:06.680, Speaker B: Yeah. If this had existed in the spring or was it like the winter, like January, February 2021, people was really starting to get that much more interest from the community, from the web3, the NFT community. And it just would have been interesting to me if this existed then, because I'll say I couldn't afford to buy a beeple, but my God, I loved what he was doing and a lot of people did. And I think it's a cool way to be able to reward those folks. All this narrative, too, that we're talking about falls in line with, thankfully, what has been successful with play to earn. And although play to earn seems normal to all of us here, it's become like a very well understood concept amongst our community. We're like one of, one of 1% in the world.
00:31:06.680 - 00:31:24.072, Speaker B: Most people don't know what this is, and it's a game changer. Play to earn is huge. But I think this concept of like to earn, it opens up Pandora's box for all sorts of really cool web3 ideas and concepts.
00:31:24.216 - 00:32:01.352, Speaker A: Yeah, at the end of the day, at the end of every race, we see three Nfts that people really like. And so what we're working on next is we're going to be rolling out the race gallery in the app probably early next year. And in that gallery, you're going to start to see the winners. And as we know, web3 and crypto can't be contained. NFTs can't be contained. We're actually going to be giving kind of the first peek of the race galleries in the metaverse this Friday at 03:00 p.m. In Raho house.
00:32:01.352 - 00:32:40.710, Speaker A: Ra House is our server. We're going to be invoice in Ra House with frequency DJing, and we're going to go check out a gallery that the nemesis IO built for us in their metaverse. And that gallery will showcase winners. And so this gallery is not something that someone just collected and they put in there. This is literally fan favorites. This is a reputation system and a portable reputation system for media. Again, what RA is working on big picture is portable Facebook likes, except in the future.
00:32:40.710 - 00:33:12.930, Speaker A: It's not just a like, or more precisely, it's not just a raw. The full blown protocol allows for any NFT to become a reaction. And those reactions are used to like and curate other NFTs. And so every time you see this NfT in different metaverses and different websites and different wallets, like Rainbow or whatever, you'll see the reputation system. And in web two, that's just not possible. Facebook likes do not translate to Twitter hearts. They're different.
00:33:13.860 - 00:34:04.770, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. That's that whole cross platform opportunity. You're uniting a lot of siloed platforms, which is really, again, it's a huge part of why we're all here. But if you haven't seen the permissionlessness of Defi applications, NFT applications and so on, it's a very foreign concept. But I am, like I said, very excited for this because it's taking something that's already a constant in our lives, liking stuff, and again, doing a clever sort of thing to actually reward them. Lawson, is there anything else you wanted to share? I think we just about covered it all.
00:34:04.770 - 00:34:35.112, Speaker B: I want to encourage everyone to. To make sure that they follow RA and you on Twitter. They can join the RA, the race at app Rah Ra social. And then, of course, if you go there, there's a link to their discord too. I would encourage anyone to get into the discord. And everything we showed you doesn't cost anything to participate. Actually, the one thing there, if someone did want to participate, is, remember, there are eight curation NFTs left.
00:34:35.112 - 00:34:49.784, Speaker B: So if you wanted to be a curator, other than earning it, they could still earn it. Right, in the future, if you want to skip the line, there it was, I think, 0.5 E. And that was at raw Mir XYZ.
00:34:49.912 - 00:35:11.680, Speaker A: Exactly. And there's a whole bunch of fan NFTs as well. So we have three NFTs for the Genesis. These are rai rock collectibles. Along with these come with special permissions in the app. And so the first one you just mentioned, we have the Genesis curator NFT, which gives them permission to curate every day in the race. And then we also have the GM.
00:35:11.680 - 00:35:46.636, Speaker A: Good morning, Genesis NFT. That's the rarest one. That's a very cool one. Also comes with permission to curate, among other things. And then the last one is the fan NFT. The genesis fan NFT comes with bonus raws, but it also comes with access to the in app chat inside of our server, which is raw house. There's an NFT race chat channel, and anybody with a fan NFT or a curator NFT or the GM one can gain access to that chat.
00:35:46.636 - 00:36:15.560, Speaker A: Without that NFT, you can only view the chat, but you can't actually chat in there. And so if you want to mingle with the curators, talk about the art, influence the race, pick up one of those NFTs at Ra Mirror XYZ. Otherwise, again, I'm lwsnbaker on Twitter. We are Ra underscore social on Twitter and you can hit us up on a website, Ra social. That's it, man.
00:36:15.710 - 00:36:32.940, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks so much for your time, man. I'm going to end the broadcast here in a second. We'll be in a green room. One last thing, too. Obviously we're excited about the utility and the participation enabled by those NFTs. I just want to remind everyone, of course, this is not financial advice.
00:36:32.940 - 00:37:16.764, Speaker B: We're not recommending that you speculate on those NFTs and buy them with an expectation of some sort of return. So these are NFTs that obviously have real utility, and they enable you to have access to different privileges in the RA community. So the curation one actually in particular is the one that stuck out for me because I was like, I don't deserve to be in that class of curators yet, but I would love to participate and so I could get in there by buying that worth sort of like noting some strategy there. But dude, thanks so much for your time. Congrats on the launch. It's so cool. And everyone, thanks for joining us.
00:37:16.764 - 00:37:30.797, Speaker B: If you enjoyed this, subscribe@dfidad.com most importantly, go to app Ra Social to join the race and join us next time. Look forward to talking with other talented web3 founders like Lawson by so bye everyone.
00:37:30.797 - 00:37:31.848, Speaker A: Rah cheers. Rah.
