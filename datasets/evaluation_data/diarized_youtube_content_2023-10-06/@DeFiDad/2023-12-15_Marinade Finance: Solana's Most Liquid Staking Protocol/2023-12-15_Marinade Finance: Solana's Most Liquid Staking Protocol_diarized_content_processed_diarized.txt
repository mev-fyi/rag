00:00:00.330 - 00:00:43.660, Speaker A: You know, obviously, though, there's the whole Sam stuff that went down last year and defi kind of died for a while. A lot of teams, like, they hadn't felt Sam's presence for a while. And I think we all kind of felt slighted, like, hey, this is our ecosystem, it's not Sam's ecosystem. And just these last six months, the amount of stuff shipping and the amount of interest in LSTs and Solana Defi has just exploded. My job is like so much more fun now and easier. Earlier this year, it was pretty brutal. You're just trying to figure out how to evangelize liquid staking when you really couldn't even borrow lend for a few months with liquid staking tokens, and it's kind of nice to see more and more people kind of realizing what's been being built here.
00:00:46.110 - 00:01:41.002, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's show features marinade finance the top staking protocol on Salana with nearly 10 million soul stake, equal to over $600 million across 75,000 unique wallets live for over two years, Marinade is the most popular DAP on Salana, thanks to countless DFI integrations to support its flagship liquid staking derivative, MSOL. In this episode, we'll discuss how Marinade grew to become such a trusted protocol in Salana, including the recent launch of their native staking service, which allows users to stake SOL directly without losing custody across 100 plus network validators in one click.

00:02:57.070 - 00:03:41.022, Speaker C: Everybody at this point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your staked death mint, a liquid staking token and then use that token in defi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, oracle networks, other blockchains and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH in Defi.
00:03:41.022 - 00:04:06.214, Speaker C: We are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with liquid restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards. Restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:04:06.342 - 00:04:12.000, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:04:14.050 - 00:04:55.610, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multichain UX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:56.430 - 00:05:03.422, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce Brandon Tucker from the core team at Marinate Finance. Brandon, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:05:03.556 - 00:05:22.222, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks for having me. Big supporter for a couple of years. I think you were one of the first accounts I was following. And as a fellow dad, I think it gave me some confidence that it's not just all degenerates in Defi and you can be a responsible dad and be in this business. So thanks for the inspo.
00:05:22.286 - 00:05:58.730, Speaker B: No, thanks so much, Brandon. That's so nice of you to say. So, today we're going to try to cover really all you need to know about Marinade finance as the top staking protocol on Solana. We're going to talk a lot about why you now refer to it as optimized staking. I think many of us who have used MSOL in the past have referred to you as liquid staking. And so that's the really interesting development that we want to highlight. But I do want to backtrack to the starting or the founding of Marinade.
00:05:58.730 - 00:06:30.178, Speaker B: I heard a rumor that you were founded with something like $80,000. I'm curious, is that true? Can you talk about. I always assumed you had VCs backing you. Marinade was founded in, I want to say, like the last bull run. So I assumed you had maybe even some of the legacy issues that some protocols had with SPF and FTX, but apparently that's not true. So, yeah. Can you walk us through the founding of Marinade?
00:06:30.274 - 00:06:43.680, Speaker A: Happy to, yeah. The team was founded back in the spring of 2021. I joined in the fall of 2020. I joined at the exact market top. So if you see like, salana at 260, that's exactly when I started.
00:06:45.090 - 00:06:45.886, Speaker B: That's awesome.
00:06:45.988 - 00:07:17.414, Speaker A: Yeah. The team, it was basically two teams that got together at a hackathon. They were working in multiple ecosystems and saw the Salana hackathon. Both began working on liquid staking and just teamed up, got together and shipped the hackathon project together. And they were able to just get like an $80,000 from the Salana serum hackathon. And Marinade was actually able to be the first liquid staking token live on main Net on Salana. This is August of 2021.
00:07:17.414 - 00:07:44.242, Speaker A: So they actually beat Lido by about a month to Mainnet. So that was huge. It really gave marinade this head start. And it's really just been a community ethos from the know no VC. A total fair launch. Token Mnde that launched that October with the idea of just being a fully on chain Dao that we've been executing like crazy over the last year or two. So it really is just a community project.
00:07:44.242 - 00:08:05.910, Speaker A: There's a lot of ways to contribute and we're always eager to really get the whole community of Solana involved, whether it's defi protocols, validators, thought leaders, we really kind of envisioned it as a public good kind of here for the ecosystem contributing, public tooling, all open source stuff for the ecosystem for years to come.
00:08:05.980 - 00:08:40.946, Speaker B: How did you decide to start working on Solana? I guess were you holding Sol and thinking about the opportunity there with liquid staking? Because I would imagine it was probably a popular decision in 2021. And then I'm betting you endured a lot during the crypto winter, like everyone. And now in the end of 2023, again, I feel like you're looking like a genius again to a lot of folks, like an overnight success, which I think clearly, again, you all have worked very hard to get to this point.
00:08:41.048 - 00:09:36.770, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the teams just really at the beginning, like the technological value proposition of Solana. This idea of composability on Solana is really good for liquid staking and just kind of speaking as like a retail normie from the beginning. It's hard to do a lot with staked Ethereum on mainnet without kind of running into a lot of fees. But on Solana, everything is just so composable and the fees are so low that you can really kind of maximize just the stackability and the composability of a liquid staking token so you can use all these really cool strategies. And one of the great things about MSOL is that we've got the liquid staking token and we really don't do a whole lot after that for the composability and just the whole ecosystem usage. Defi teams just take it and run with it. They build all these really cool use cases with it, and we're just kind of like this kind of cornerstone or this backbone of liquidity in the ecosystem.
00:09:36.770 - 00:10:19.490, Speaker A: What's really exciting to me is obviously there's the whole Sam stuff that went down last year and defi kind of died for a while. And just these last six months, the amount of stuff shipping and the amount of interest in LSTs and Solana Defi has just exploded. My job is so much more fun now and easier. Earlier this year, it was pretty brutal. You're just trying to figure out how to evangelize liquid staking when you really couldn't even borrow lend for a few months with liquid staking tokens. So yeah, we've been building like crazy happy to share about that, but really just the ecosystem in general. It was really a call to know, I think, about where we were in November of last year.
00:10:19.490 - 00:11:00.446, Speaker A: Most of us were at breakpoint in Portugal as all the stuff was going down, and it didn't feel fair because I think a lot of the teams didn't feel like Sam was part of our team. I think you could probably find some DMs with us in Alameda from way back in the day. They were kind of just tangentially involved to a degree, but a lot of teams, they hadn't felt Sam's presence for a while. And I think we all kind of felt slighted, like, hey, this is our ecosystem, it's not Sam's ecosystem. And I think in the last year, you've really seen that come to life, and it's kind of nice to see more and more people kind of realizing what's been being built here.
00:11:00.548 - 00:11:39.286, Speaker B: It's crazy to think how much change, too, in a year. We're talking in December 2023, and December 2022 was a really dark time for everyone. So it's a reminder that things can change very quickly. This is part of the reason, as much as I know it's impossible not to pay attention to prices and to keep your eye on the market. Of course, it's very important to the growth of our space. It is important to keep your head down and keep building. Now that we're very likely.
00:11:39.286 - 00:12:07.254, Speaker B: I think in a bull run, it's important to not give ourselves too much credit. During the bull run, during the bear market, we all want to say the prices don't matter, the tech is still building, the fundamentals are strong. But during the bull run, I do feel like even the most well intentioned people sometimes get caught up in that and forget to pat themselves or forget to stop patting themselves on the back.
00:12:07.372 - 00:13:04.438, Speaker A: I think, just speaking from like, a sole price perspective, I think the benefit of Sol not being $8 anymore is that it does help the network decentralization and incentivize a validator network across the world. And they can operate in many countries now and still be sustainable, utilize a variety of servers, and that's really what Merida has really been focused on. We actually had a workshop at this last breakpoint when Sol was like $30, trying to understand how sustainable the validator network was. And at those prices, it was like maybe 100 or 200 validators were operating sustainably by our estimates. But now that it's doubled, the network is healthier. Assuming that sole price is able to stabilize, and network and hardware costs don't go up like crazy. So that is the benefit if we don't want to talk about moon boy stuff too much.
00:13:04.438 - 00:13:26.046, Speaker A: But marinade is profitable now. We weren't profitable for over a year just being a bootstrap company. We were really lean and mean this last year. But all this stuff, the combination of know going up in price, but also, just the amount of stake coming to us now, it's really benefiting the ecosystem at large.
00:13:26.148 - 00:13:34.558, Speaker E: Brandon, can you just give us kind of like the elevator pitch overview of what Marinade does and kind of the various products that you offer?
00:13:34.644 - 00:14:01.094, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. Probably should have done that like five minutes ago, but it's marinade. So if you're on Solana, if you're holding Sol, you should stake it because of the blockchain emissions. So it is a proof of stake network that is emitting more tokens at about right now, about 6% a year. So you want to stake it to kind of keep your stack intact compared to the market cap, but you're also supporting network decentralization through staking. And what Marinette is doing is it's optimizing your stake.
00:14:01.094 - 00:14:49.258, Speaker A: So instead of just staking with one validator and kind of being reliant on their performance, we're taking that stake and we're distributing it to 100 plus validators who we know to be the best across the network. We're using a scoring strategy that factors in both decentralization and just their APY performance. So we're actually supporting the network as well as strong validators. So it's kind of like a way you can set and forget your stake and not have to worry about a validator going offline, which we've had many examples of validators going offline or changing their commissions or doing things that are not great for your API or network. So we're really kind of like your manager for staking Solana in a wise way. And we'll do it liquid or native, which I know that you guys are big fans of the native product.
00:14:49.344 - 00:15:45.238, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm thinking that those that listen to this podcast in the future, I'm going to assume that they might have some familiarity with DFI on Ethereum or the Ethereum L two s. And so when you're coming to Salana DFI Msol, it's easy to pick up, because if you've ever used something like staked ETH or like Steth or any of the other LSTs, let's say rocket pools, it's the same idea. Like, I want to hold something that is still liquid, but is passively earning me the staking rewards from the network. Whether it's collateral or we want to provide liquidity, there's lots of different use cases there. And so we're benefiting from that with MSOL through marinade. But I think it was in July you all released this native staking product which I can personally attest.
00:15:45.238 - 00:16:03.070, Speaker B: It's my favorite DeFi product because it's allowing me to earn maximum yield on SOL without any smart contract interactions. So, can you walk us through, what's the point of native staking? What is it as a product? How does it differentiate from the liquid staking product?
00:16:03.140 - 00:17:27.050, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really one of these kind of only possible on salana things. And really native was born kind of out of this kind of dark ages of Solana DeFi back in December, January, when there really wasn't, like, a whole lot to do in, you know, we're talking to a lot, know, larger investors, institutions, asking them about MSOL and liquid staking, because we've always felt like the main value proposition of marinate was the delegation strategy as much as being liquid. And so you talk to a lot of these institutions and larger holders, and they don't want to have any exposure to Solana Defi right now. And I think if you would have talked to them a year ago, you'd say, yeah, I get, yeah, they don't want the smart contract exposure either. And so what Marinade was able to do is we took the delegation strategy, and what it is, is the stake bot that we kind of programmed the stake bot that kind of analyzes the validator network of Solana and delegates stake through the stake bot, and we don't need to use the liquid staking smart contract for that. And so what we're able to do is you give us the stake authority of your stake account, and this stake bot churns out, like, 100 plus stake accounts for you automatically. And if you did this on Ethereum, the transaction fees would be insane.
00:17:27.050 - 00:18:18.986, Speaker A: We did some analysis in the first couple of months of marinade native. I think the transaction costs for hundreds of thousands of transactions were like, $20 or something. So from a protocol perspective, this is something that we're able to do on Salana that we probably wouldn't be able to do on a lot of other chains. You retain the withdraw authority the whole time. It's really like you're just one click getting 100 plus stake accounts. And every epoch, we're looking at the delegation, and if there's any validators who are suffering or not doing well, we're rotating the kind of laggards, and we're kind of rotating it into better stake accounts. You're kind of always seeing that yield, and you don't have to worry about a big validator going offline, because something I will point out is, especially when the FTX stuff happened, and the economics had just totally blown up.
00:18:18.986 - 00:18:44.190, Speaker A: You had validators changing their commission to 100%, not telling anybody, and trying to get away with it for months or until you noticed. So if you're staking to one validator, that's kind of the worst case scenario. Or they go offline and don't tell you where you think you're staking and earning yield, but you're not at all. And so that's kind of the main benefit of marinade, is that we're always going to be watching for you so you don't have to babysit your validator.
00:18:44.270 - 00:19:01.302, Speaker B: For the native staking product if you're going to withdraw. Does the withdrawal require any waiting period? Were you just saying, can you do it almost instantly, or do you have to wait for it to be unstaked?
00:19:01.366 - 00:19:51.110, Speaker A: You can unstake individual stake accounts instantly, and it is possible to do that with marinade native, but you can kind of go to other sites and withdraw one stake account at a time. So if you wanted to get out of your native stake account right now, it would take a lot of clicks to do it, but you could unstake instantly from one or two validators. For those who don't really know about Salana, there is like a pretty large liquidity pool for instant unstakes. So that's actually one of the detriments as to why liquid staking is only about 3% of stake. Is that a staking is actually really liquid already. It's not like other chains where it might be like a two week unbonding period or like a month unbonding period. It's just two to three days on Solana, so it's already like a really liquid network.
00:19:51.110 - 00:19:53.686, Speaker A: So it's quite easy to get out of your native.
00:19:53.878 - 00:20:32.498, Speaker B: Are you aware of any impact that native staking has had in terms of how much soul was staked prior to you launching versus how much soul is now staked on Solana? I was kind of like, tracking the stats there on the website, and I imagined it would have some material impact, because again, it's such an important product for folks who want to stake larger amounts of Sol, but aren't willing to risk using something like a liquid staking derivative.
00:20:32.674 - 00:20:54.800, Speaker A: Salana has always been like a pretty well staked network. Usually around like 70, 75% of all Sol is staked. A lot of that is actually like, locked staked too, from early VC or grants. So they're on a vest period. I know we're always watching the FTX estate like a hawk to see when those unlocks happen. But there is, like, 55 million sol or so. That's, like, locked in stake accounts, too.
00:20:54.800 - 00:21:25.030, Speaker A: There's been, like, a steady growth, I would say. I wouldn't say it's been, like, earth shattering. There's a lot of people who have their stake accounts parked and are kind of hesitant to do anything with it for various reasons. There are some reasons why larger holders wouldn't use a product like marinade native, for example. Some want to make sure that they're with KYC validators, or they have really good relationships, or they have their own validator. So those are people who have kind of kept it the same. Solana has always been a pretty nicely staked network, though.
00:21:25.030 - 00:21:34.682, Speaker A: But I would say the growth is steadily growing, especially with liquid. I think we've seen some nice growth as Defi comes back, because there's just a lot more to do with it now.
00:21:34.736 - 00:21:54.906, Speaker E: I want to just bring up Jito for a minute here. They've made a lot of waves just recently with what looks to be a massive airdrop to the community. We were talking just a little bit before we got started here, and I was actually kind of surprised that there's almost more of, like, a positive sum relationship between marinade and Jito.
00:21:55.018 - 00:21:56.158, Speaker A: Just wondering if you can kind of.
00:21:56.164 - 00:21:57.950, Speaker E: Break that down for us again, Brandon.
00:21:58.030 - 00:22:19.062, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Jito is an awesome team. They have absolutely earned everything on Solana. They are just absolute engineering chads and just beyond happy for what they've contributed to. So I think it's important to understand Marinette and Geo both have stake pools. And then beyond that, we also kind of do different things.
00:22:19.062 - 00:22:58.194, Speaker A: And so Jito, really, their kind of claim to fame early on was this new validator client, which was a fork of the Solana validator client. And what their client was able to do was introduce this idea of Mev rewards to Solana that people got really excited about. And so you can actually earn Mev yield through those validators in addition to staking rewards and marinade and Jito. So Jito stake pool for now, is staked into all jeto client validators as a way of kind of bootstrapping the validators who use that client marinade. We will stake to anybody. So we'll stake to the Solana labs validators. We'll stake to the Jito validators.
00:22:58.194 - 00:23:35.402, Speaker A: When fire dancer comes out, we'll stake to fire dancer. We're really just looking for performant, decentralized validators. And so being the largest stake pool for so long, our stake is benefiting the Jito client because we're sending, like, I think maybe half of our stake ish is going to jeto client validators. That's like five ish million soul going to Jito validators. It's supporting them. And then their performance is so good that it's benefiting our stakers because we can give our stakers Mev and strong performance for. It's like, I think it's kind of a symbiotic thing.
00:23:35.402 - 00:23:51.762, Speaker A: We're really kind of building together. And I think it's awesome that they're Solana specific. They're focused totally on Solana. I know that you've got kind of an ETH audience here, and Lido left last month, and it makes like they are so big on Ethereum.
00:23:51.826 - 00:24:47.830, Speaker B: Actually, I'm not sure if it makes sense. I will say, brandon, when they made that announcement, I didn't flinch at it, because I think as someone who has spent more of my time and attention on Ethereum and l two s, I thought, yeah, they've got an enormous audience of loyal users there. Man, the timing of that decision does feel somewhat epic now. Right. It feels like they announced and left and then Solana just exploded with this newfound, you know, I'm not claiming to have any part of that victory. I think I have pivoted pretty quickly. To recognize the momentum shift is remarkable.
00:24:47.830 - 00:25:18.258, Speaker B: And all of the folks like yourself that were building through the bear, like, this is the reward of that. And Solana looks very strong and healthy. Yeah, it just. I feel like it took everyone by surprise, seeing, wow. Like they, they checked out and everything exploded. And I do believe if they had waited just, like, one more month, I bet that St. Soul would have continued as a product.
00:25:18.258 - 00:25:41.254, Speaker B: But not that you have to be at ODs with them as marinade finance. And I don't think you guys ever were at ODs, but it opened up, I think, a pretty large opportunity for anyone who was holding St. Soul to consider, what else should I be using? And the most obvious, I think, alternative, if you were an St. Soul, was to get into marinade.
00:25:41.302 - 00:26:27.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'll just add that I think the teams that kind of double down on Solana, kind of at the depths, they're pretty much all bearing the fruits now. And Marinade's been all in on Solana. Jito's been all in on Solana. There's countless other protocols that have been all in on Solana throughout this whole thing, and those that kind of stuck around are doing well. We respect Lido like crazy. And I know that our founding team is huge lido fans. And sometimes people ask if Marade is the Lido salana, and it's like, I don't consider that at all because I think we manage, like 2% total stake, which is like nothing, but business is crazy.
00:26:27.462 - 00:26:53.822, Speaker A: Timing is crazy, serendipity. But I think those who work on Salana every single day and their focus is on Solana, the value prop never really changed, even when liquidity was dry. A lot of the cool things that happened just before breakpoint with regards to just like, chain performance and priority transactions and things like that for the builders and the developers, they were just jacked up about that. So why would they leave right after those updates?
00:26:53.966 - 00:27:26.650, Speaker E: Brandon, you mentioned Mev earlier and kind of that symbiotic relationship between Jito and marinade for how you captured on the marinade side. Defi dad and I should never pretend to be MeV experts, but I am curious. I think I'm pretty blind to kind of the MeV markets on Solana. How meaningful is it right now? How much is that growing? And I guess how much fee revenue do you see passing through MeV?
00:27:27.150 - 00:28:06.482, Speaker A: Yeah, right now it's not significant. There's no Jared from subway equivalent on Solana, like, sandwiching our stuff. Yeah, I mean, I think that the stake pool, like our entire stake pool, Ichipak, is maybe getting like five to ten soul ish of MeV. But the idea is that there's a lot more opportunity as the chain gets more demand and more action, and validators are able to kind of benefit more from the ordering of transactions. So I think it's more of a future benefit. I think for Marinade, it makes a much bigger difference on just the overall validator performance versus MeV. But I think we're also excited about Mev.
00:28:06.482 - 00:28:25.782, Speaker A: We're hugely excited about fired answer and what that offers, too. That's another big thing. That is just another validator client with even more insane speeds and opportunities. So I think with marinade, I wouldn't say Mev is like this massive driver, but it is exciting. It's another thing that Solana offers a lot of potential of.
00:28:25.856 - 00:28:45.380, Speaker B: Can you talk a little bit more about fire dancer and what impact, if any, that'll have on marinade? You just mentioned a validator client with insane speed. So yeah. Anything else you can offer there to dumb it down for someone who's heard the word fire dancer but has no idea how it relates to.
00:28:45.990 - 00:29:42.294, Speaker A: Yeah, and apologies in advance to Kevin Bowers. If I totally screw this up as a liberal arts guy, but really the idea behind Solana having multiple clients is that it really helps this idea, like downtime that Solana used to have. But if we can have parallel clients running just like Ethereum does, Ethereum's got like five or six, right? So this idea of different clients running in different programming languages kind of eliminates really the idea of a chain halt, which Salana hasn't had a chain halt really all year. I think it's been ten or eleven months at this point. But multiple clients running means that the network can stay live. And also they're building it in a way where they're saying that they could do like a million transactions a second or something insane. The way that they're building this is the jump team that's building it.
00:29:42.294 - 00:30:17.062, Speaker A: So they have motivations for this insane trading light speed stuff from a trading perspective, but it also just opens up a lot of consumer use cases for having both the speed and the liveness that fire dancer introduced. And I think it's in testnet now and I believe a light version they're calling freaking dancer is potentially going to go live by Q two. And Tolly said once fire dancer is live, we can take away the beta he feels good about. No more main net beta for Salana. So we're all excited for Tolly.
00:30:17.146 - 00:30:42.118, Speaker E: So Brandon, the marinade token is already live, and we sort of saw how Jito really utilized their token not being live with their point system for their airdrop to, I think, accrue just a ton of TVL. What is your plan in this kind of competitive marketplace to continue to draw in TVL even with a token that's already live? Like any tricks up your sleeve?
00:30:42.294 - 00:31:29.282, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. We did the fair launch airdrop two years ago, so you can only have so many bullets for an airdrop to get all that hype. So we were doing a small campaign too, called Marinator, and this year it runs up at the end of December where you're able to kind of earn some MNDe on top of your staking awards. And really the idea there was to kind of make sure that the combined apy of the MND plus staking awards earns you a better yield than any single validator. So it kind of really introduces you to the marinade value proposition. So I think that the token utility, I would say is really interesting and I don't think enough people know about it who aren't breathing staking on Solana.
00:31:29.282 - 00:32:05.670, Speaker A: But the MNDE token we introduced this idea of directed stake with it. And so if you lock your tokens in our realms governance, you can vote for validators to receive all the stakes. So it's 20% of the stake pool. So I'd say this is directing about 2 million of our stake pool. Stake is determined based on MnDe voting. And so if I vote for a validator, they get that proportion of stake to their node. And so for validators, this is really interesting for them to attract stake through the MNDE token.
00:32:05.670 - 00:33:02.642, Speaker A: And another cool thing to keep an eye on is validators are starting to introduce this idea of their own boosted markets for almost like a vodium kind of concept. Maybe curve wars is a good example, but they'll give you additional incentives to vote for them with your MNDE and you can actually get more staking awards by voting for them. And then the validators get additional stake. So that's like a really interesting utility. And we're starting to see more and more validators start to offer their own incentives. And I think this is going to really proliferate into 2024. Just this idea of being able to kind of vote with your token and it's really kind of maintaining that community ethos I spoke about earlier of marinade, really trying to be this community fair launch protocol and the community is always going to be able to vote on a portion of the marinade steak.
00:33:02.706 - 00:33:16.042, Speaker B: Are there any links or resources you'd recommend, Brandon, for keeping up with all these updates and being able to participate in that staking and on chain governance in the future?
00:33:16.176 - 00:33:45.682, Speaker A: Yeah, obviously the Twitter discord. We've got great docs that we're working on all the time, so definitely dig into the docs a little bit and kind of see what's going on there. The validator community too. There's a handful of really awesome validators who are outstanding at education. I'm thinking of like Knox trade, Solana Hub, Solana Compass, Lane Cogent. The list goes on. Of awesome validators who I think speak in a language good enough for retail to understand.
00:33:45.682 - 00:33:57.454, Speaker A: And they've been really proactive at not only marketing the ecosystem, but themselves and staking. And they really benefit from marinade stake too. And so they're always like huge supporters of stake.
00:33:57.522 - 00:34:36.178, Speaker B: I've written up a few reviews previously about marinade in the Defiant and the Defi Alpha guide, and I remember every time I've done this I've considered will you expand to other liquid staking products like beyond soul? So do you foresee that in the roadmap and also maybe even more obvious would be offering MSOL on other chains that are Solana friendly or are going to have a crossover audience with MSOL holders on Solana.
00:34:36.274 - 00:35:35.778, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. I think if we didn't really go multi chain during the FTX downturn, we're probably not going to anytime soon. I do think though, that the like token is very composable and can be utilized by other teams. And so I think that's more likely is that another team, like a neon or someone using SVM or really protocols who are building multi chain, they would just permissionlessly utilize our like, we don't really have to be involved whatsoever for that. And like, we recently went through a smart contract upgrade that makes MSOL just even more composable to work with a better programming language. So I don't anticipate the Marinade core team proactively trying to get across as many chains as we can. But I do see other chains seeing the benefit of having LSTs from Solana on their platform and integrating us pretty seamlessly.
00:35:35.874 - 00:36:15.630, Speaker B: Brandon, this is probably a good place for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners that first they can learn about marinade finance by going to marinade finance. They can follow you on Twitter, it's brandontucker. And then they can follow marinade finance at Marinade Finance. And so we'd love to give you the final word. Just thank you for taking the time to talk with us. Obviously, as a user of all marinade products, this is a real joy for me to kind of dig into what happens behind the scenes, where the product roadmap is headed.
00:36:15.630 - 00:36:25.670, Speaker B: But for those who would want to get more involved, do you have any recommendations of where to start or where to plug into the marinade community?
00:36:25.820 - 00:36:46.762, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, I think the discord is great. We have a lot of discussion going on in there. We also run like an MSOL strategies channel, too. So if you've got MSOL and you don't know how to use it in defi, visit the MSOL strategies channel. We're also updating the cookbook. That's like a defi cookbook where you can kind of see all the various strategies where you can use MSOL.
00:36:46.762 - 00:37:18.994, Speaker A: We've got leverage staking now where you can one click lever up your MSOL stake to forex if you want. That's kind of degenerate, but relatively safe, I'd say liquidity pools, like all that stuff. So there's a whole lot to do with your MSOL. Now, if you don't want to use your liquid stake, then just go to native like you are, because that's even better. APy performance and no smart contract, but it's an awesome community. I've been really kind of grateful to be a part of this community. I think I kind of found the perfect community for me in crypto.
00:37:18.994 - 00:37:52.100, Speaker A: It's, like, very welcoming and global, and it's just kind of great to see all the activity, picking up and seeing folks like you reach out and want to talk about us more. So it's going to be a good holiday season, I think, all around. I think if you see people splurging like crazy at a restaurant or the mall, they might be some, like, bonk Maxi. You'll spot the bonk Maxis a mile away this holiday season. You'd be around them at the bar.
00:37:52.870 - 00:38:00.902, Speaker B: One other thing before you go, you mentioned the forex one click leverage. Are you referring to camino finance or is there something else out there?
00:38:00.956 - 00:38:38.994, Speaker A: So there's four now. So at the beginning of the year, there were zero, and you always had to do it manually. But then superstake soul, that was built by drip, they launched it, then Solend launched their own, and then you had Camino, where they just launched the V two and they've got it, and then Mango just launched it too. So that just kind of speaks to how composable things are and how everyone's jacked up to integrate us and just liquid staking tokens in general, because DFI can, I mentioned, like 70% of stake, and most of that's native. If that gets unlocked in the liquid, I mean, it's gonna be. It's gonna be crazy times.
00:38:39.112 - 00:39:26.074, Speaker B: Well, it's. It's well earned. It's not like this was an overnight success. And I think the most interesting takeaway for me today is just that you never raised like a typical, sort of like, seed round with VCs. That's a really interesting part of the story there. I would imagine anyone who's looking at Marinade, looking at when you were founded, had to have assumed the total opposite, that you must have had some enormous round going back to 2021. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I think it's really telling about the roots of, like, where you come from and the sort of like, missionary driven ethos, I think, behind you and clearly others on the protocol.
00:39:26.202 - 00:39:56.546, Speaker A: Yes, it's made us scrappy, it's made us really kind of focus on what matters. And it's a great team to be on. We're all very humble and love kind of collaborating with people in the ecosystem. And I'll also mention, like, I'm one third of the grant committee. And like, you really can't get mnde unless you contribute even the core team. We don't get time based unlocks. Like, it's all TBL based milestone unlocks.
00:39:56.546 - 00:40:22.434, Speaker A: And, like, we've got a grant committee that's like, designed to bring us an idea that you want to build, and we'll unlock the MND for you to make it happen. We really want to see the community over the next couple of years take over Marinade, make it decentralized to the point where it's like the communities in general and there's really not a core team. That's kind of the long term roadmap. So it's exciting. I think if you're on Solana, you want to be part of a community. It's a great place to be. So thanks again for your interest.
00:40:22.434 - 00:40:26.690, Speaker A: It's awesome to see that so many people are kind of taking notice now.
00:40:26.840 - 00:40:39.410, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
