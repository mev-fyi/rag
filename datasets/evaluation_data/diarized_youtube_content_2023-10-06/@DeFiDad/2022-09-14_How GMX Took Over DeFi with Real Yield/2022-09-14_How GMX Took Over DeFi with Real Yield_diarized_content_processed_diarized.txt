00:00:04.210 - 00:00:58.562, Speaker A: Hey everyone, you're watching Defi. Talks of Defi. Dad. More quick reminder before we get started, if you enjoy this free content, please keep in mind my team at fourth Revolution Capital who support me in making all this content. All right, now we're ready to get started. So it is Tuesday, September 13, 2022. I'm joined here today by Fred, who is a community member and contributor at GMX.
00:00:58.562 - 00:01:56.082, Speaker A: So we're going to talk all about what has become one of the most reputable names in DFI and during a very tumultuous market since 2021. So GMX is a decentralized perpetuals exchange. They allow up to 30 x leverage so that you can long or short up to eight different assets. They also have a decentralized swap that is now being integrated into lots of other Dex aggregators. And this has just been like a powerhouse in what's being referred to as real yield. So I think we all learned a lot of lessons from the last few years, with many of the more foundational DeFi protocols starting to build traction. And this, for me, is one of the most promising new applications in Defi.
00:01:56.082 - 00:01:59.466, Speaker A: So anyways, Fred, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:59.648 - 00:02:03.420, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for having me. I'm doing very well. How are you guys doing?
00:02:05.790 - 00:02:11.840, Speaker A: If you, I don't know if you can get any closer to the mic. You sounded a little bit quiet there, but I can hear you.
00:02:12.690 - 00:02:14.174, Speaker B: Is this a little bit better?
00:02:14.372 - 00:02:15.758, Speaker A: There we go. Much better.
00:02:15.844 - 00:02:16.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:16.132 - 00:02:53.290, Speaker A: There we go. Yeah, Fred, no. Thanks for joining. So we'll probably kick off with just a bit about who you are. But then I really want to cover the story of GMX, like how it got started under a different name originally on BSC, why you guys pivoted over to arbitrum eventually and, yeah, just more about what it is that you do and the product roadmap ahead. So maybe, Fred, if you're willing to share whatever you can as an anonymous contributor about your background and how you got started at GMX.
00:02:54.750 - 00:04:12.830, Speaker B: Definitely. So I guess to begin my journey into crypto kind of started similar with everybody else's. I kind of got involved from the perspective of wanting to figure out what are some serious growth plays that I can get into as a younger person with a much longer timeline to kind of think about these risks and kinds of investment opportunities that would put me in a more advantageous position than, say, waiting for the typical invest x percent of your income in stocks every so often, and then you get the 7% to 10% year over year. So that journey eventually brought me to crypto and kind of looking into it, I saw that there was a lot of potential. So I started to really check it out. And I kind of had this funny experience where I realized that crypto, right, generally, whether it, you know, DeFi protocols, dows or whatever, had a lot of potential. But it was such an infant stage at the moment where I was looking into it that a lot of the projects that were live were unable to kind of really attain those lofty goals that they had set out to achieve.
00:04:12.830 - 00:05:26.422, Speaker B: And so this kind of influenced my journey into becoming a crypto cynic, where I was very open and aware of the potential that crypto had, but was very cynical of whether or not it could actually be achieved in the time that people are saying that they are trying to achieve these things. And so I kind of went on this journey where it's like, okay, you start to realize a lot of these that you get about one project or another are just hype or whatever. So I need a little bit more of a solid foundation to kind of begin assessing different crypto assets. And so kind of went back to the drawing board and got a little bit more familiar with just regular fundamental analysis that you would use for any other kind of investment opportunity. You want to understand where's the cash flow coming from? What is the addressable market? Are there any other competitors? Do they have their niche? Just very simple things like that. What is the revenue model? Is it something that's sustainable in all market conditions? Is it something that can be pivoted, if it has to be, and whatnot. And so with this approach, I'm looking through the cryptosphere around this time, I would say it's about 2018, 2019.
00:05:26.422 - 00:06:15.130, Speaker B: So the hype is just reaching its peak, right, where yield farming is the current narrative. Right. And that's kind of breaking some ground, because for the first time, people are starting to realize, okay, there's some passive income opportunities with crypto, which is attractive to almost anyone, regardless if you're sympathetic to crypto or not. And so I'm starting to look at these yield farming opportunities and realizing that there's this common trend where you get this really neat protocol or farming opportunity. It comes out with this crazy APR. This APR is paid out in this new token that no one's heard about but will do all these great things. And it's great for the first two weeks, maybe three weeks, and then suddenly the APR is reduced, diluted.
00:06:15.130 - 00:06:53.186, Speaker B: The token that you're getting paid in turns out isn't really useful for much more than being sold the moment you get it. And a lot of these protocols and opportunities were kind of just falling flat on their faces. They were great if you got in early, but they weren't sustainable. And so I was curious what would make this sustainable. And that journey brought me to this protocol around the end of 2019 or middle of 2020. It's been a while now. I've been with GMX for quite a bit now where I come across this protocol called Gambit.
00:06:53.186 - 00:08:01.710, Speaker B: And the first thing I see about Gambit is that it has this really high APR for this token called XGMT. And I'm like, okay, that's a red flag for me at first. I've seen all of these high apRs or whatever, it's either not going to last long or it's going to get heavily diluted just because it's going to attract a lot of capital. And looking into the protocol, I realized, okay, this is pretty interesting, because what they were attempting to do as a protocol was to capture many different stakeholders under one umbrella. So they were looking to do something that in many ways, yield farming was seemingly incapable of doing right. With yield farming, the whole idea was like these projects wanted to attract liquidity providers and they would pay them out in these tokens. But it's like if that's all your project has up until that point, and everyone's getting paid in these tokens that you're paying them out in, but there's really nothing else beyond that because the whole phase that you're in is provision liquidity.
00:08:01.710 - 00:09:15.560, Speaker B: You're not going to have a sustainable market to kind of get other value adds off of. You're going to have the people who show up, they get what they can and then they leave. That's quite literally just not sustainable. And what was going on in Gambit at the time was that the liquidity providers were not leaving. And I thought that was really interesting, like what is making them stay there? And what it turned out was happening was that because Gambit at the time was willing to consider a bunch of different stakeholders, they had this really neat approach where the liquidity providers could be given a sustainable incentive, which was the platform revenue or a portion of the platform revenue generated from trader activity. And then on the other hand, they could give traders who wanted to use the platform this really great zero price impact trading experience. And then on the other hand, it also was able to consider people who wanted to simply support the protocol, which was again, providing a whole host of these services and allowing these kind of things to happen.
00:09:15.560 - 00:10:19.500, Speaker B: And that was when I realized, okay, I'm like, okay, wow, this project has really thought out from beginning to end all possible users who will come to interact, whether it's from the perspective of what kind of value can I get out of this protocol, what kind of trader experience I can get out of this protocol, or how can I support this protocol? All three of those kinds of different aspects were all considered, and that was interesting and special to me. And from that journey, a lot of lessons were learned because gambit at the time was not perfect, and we can talk about that. But from that journey, out came GMX, and that is what we have today. This really neat perpetual and swap Dex that has this really neat liquidity provider token and has been able to essentially handle this large amount of volume and essentially pay out a pretty generous amount of the protocol revenue to token holders who participate and help the ecosystem run.
00:10:20.750 - 00:10:53.590, Speaker A: Hey, Fred, what are the features or products within Gambit that translated over to GMX? This is, truthfully, I was, like, blind to the fact that GMX existed as gambit until today. So I'm really fascinated in how you all pivoted and also what the timeline looked like. When was the proposal that we should pivot, rebrand, and end up moving over to arbitram?
00:10:54.570 - 00:12:01.866, Speaker B: Yeah, excellent question. So the main carryover from Gambit to GMX was the idea of having a composite liquidity pool, as opposed to what is more common to a decentralized kind of market making activity, which is the XYK model. So for those who aren't familiar, uniswap is kind of the de facto XYK Amm protocol out there. When people think about how do you model and structure a decentralized market? And what that means is essentially you have a ratio of tokens, one x, one y, that essentially are put together in this pool and they're maintained. The ratio of the two are maintained within kind of like this bound curve, or this bonded curve, I should really say, which essentially determines the price of the tradable asset for that market at that point in time. And it's essentially what we expect markets to be without a peer to peer. Right.
00:12:01.866 - 00:13:03.518, Speaker B: It's kind of like quite literally a supply demand kind of interaction, right. So what that means is when people enter a position with a particularly large size for a swap, it impacts one side of that xy equation heavily, and that then, of course, impacts the price. And so what we have is the common experience with using something like uniswap or even sushi swap, right? Which is if you have a large enough position that you're swapping, you're going to see price impact upon entering that position. So what Gambit was doing at the time was saying, okay, there's a lot know market activity already for some of the larger volume assets that people like to trade, like bitcoin, ethereum, binance, token even. And in fact, there's so much market activity that we don't need to be a host to the site where price activity happens. We can allow the larger market activity to kind of handle that. We can abstract those price precursors away from our platform.
00:13:03.518 - 00:14:33.622, Speaker B: And instead what we can do is use a price feed from Chainlink, which aggregates all those market activities that we just previously mentioned into one trustless third party source. And if we're just using that Chainlink price feed for traders to enter positions, then that means there's no price impact because there's no x or y side of the ratio of that particular pool to impact whatsoever. Right. The only thing that's happening is you're getting the price read from Chainlink, and then if the underlying amount of capital that you need for your position is within the pool, then you will open and enter that position with the desired amount of capital. And that to me was probably the first sign of a fundamental validation like, okay, this is an actual innovation on what was already a previous innovation, because I'm not knocking XYK Amm models, they have their place, absolutely, for kind of like those initial spinning up of those peer to peer markets, especially on a decentralized area. But when you want to trade perpetuals, you need that price integrity. And we are at a point now where there's a lot of volume for certain assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, where that market activity, it can be abstracted away and we can give traders the privilege of just being able to enter essentially at that chain link price feed, so long as there's enough capital in the composite pool.
00:14:33.622 - 00:14:58.898, Speaker B: And the next departure is like the composite pool essentially can be made up of whatever whitelisted assets you want, right? So for us currently on the arbitram deploy of GMX, that's bitcoin, Ethereum link token, uniswap token, chain link token, excuse me, uniswap token, and then a number of stables. And that means, yeah, if you'd like.
00:14:58.904 - 00:15:48.834, Speaker A: To pull that, I'll, as you talk through this, Fred, I'll start to show some parts of the platform. So the composite pool, which normally folks own a share of that through what's known as GLP, that index is what we're looking at here, the eight different tokens, four of them being stable coins. You can actually see the weightings here, like, what is the ideal weighting versus what it actually is, the target weight versus the current weight. So some of these are underweighted, and then for some of these others, of course, they're a little bit overweight. But keep going, Fred. Sorry. Just kind of highlighting some of the simple things to pay attention to here.
00:15:48.834 - 00:15:51.166, Speaker A: If you're new to GMX.
00:15:51.358 - 00:16:25.866, Speaker B: Yeah, no, and I appreciate you showing the screen. So, I mean, what we're seeing here is essentially all the possible markets that GMX currently provides. Whereas if we were to see maybe a version of this on uniswap or. Right, there would be an individual market for Ethereum, dai, Ethereum, USDT, Ethereum, USDC. And that means there's separate liquidity providers for each of those and so on and so forth. And we kind of figured we'll do away with that. And so Gambit did that first with a token called usdg.
00:16:25.866 - 00:17:06.986, Speaker B: And this was the first mistake and the first lesson, I guess, that you could say, that was learned. So USDG works exactly just like GLP, except for if GLP were attempting to maintain a dollar stable peg. So that was the next thing I thought that was kind of interesting, which was, there is this woe from the developer of Gambit, right, to essentially try something really neat and daring, which was this USDG. So before GLP, there is usdg. It was a stable token. It was always pegged to one dollars. But not only that, it was a yield bearing stable token, and just the same way that GLP was.
00:17:06.986 - 00:17:46.794, Speaker B: So I got a portion of platform fees and it was paid out in BNB at the time to USDG holders. And so seeing that, I was like, okay, that's cool. So there's an innovation on the liquidity model. There's an innovation to the stablecoin kind of craze that was going on at the time. Of course, the issue was, if you're having the liquidity, be kind of like the counterparty risk, because that is the reality, right. With a composite kind of pool makeup is that as users kind of utilize that capital, you do take on the counterparty side of essentially those perpetual trades. So if someone is long, right, the GLP holders are short.
00:17:46.794 - 00:18:36.278, Speaker B: If someone is short, the GOP holders are long. And if those traders are profitable, they do get essentially that capital taken out of the composite pool and rewarded to them for that successful trade. But if they are not, then of course, whatever liquidated capital or collateral goes back to the GOP index. And we could talk about the sustainability of that in a little bit down the line. But the issue with that in general is that if you're trying to maintain a stable peg, it's really hard to do if one day you have a bunch of traders who are really successful on trades, long or short. And so the first issue that we had was as cool stablecoin that yielded returns. It was very hard to maintain that dollar peg with capital that was being utilized for perpetual swaps.
00:18:36.278 - 00:19:46.058, Speaker B: So essentially a combination of finance, smart chain, having some outages that I'm not sure if anyone kind of remembers. Kind of like late 2020, mid 2021, after finance kind of had that crazy spike in activity. And in the token price, there were some outages because it's a little bit of a centralized situation in terms of the network, which I think they've solved since then. But you can't have that experience for perpetual traders outages just completely unacceptable. So the outages made us kind of leave binance smart chain, and also the realization, know we have something here that works, but we kind of need to make the model a little bit more, you know, that was when we know the liquidity token won't really be pegged to a dollar anymore. It's going to be free floating, and it'll just free float and represent the underlying index of the capital that actually makes it up, which is what GLP is now. The other decision was the fact that the reason why gamma was on BSE in the first place is that it was very easy to use in terms like the gas fees.
00:19:46.058 - 00:20:41.914, Speaker B: Gas fees were really cheap on BSC, and BSE could also handle complex code. The smart contract for GMX is admittedly pretty complex. If it were to be on know, just the transaction fees alone to process the smart contract calls would be enormous. So when we heard that arbitrage was launching, and I use very loosely, I wasn't even part of the team at the time. I'm observing all of this happen as a skeptical crypto cynic. Is this even going to get pulled off or whatnot? But at the time, they're also like, Arbitrum is announcing that they're going to deploy with their public release, and they were capable of handling the complexity of the smart contract code. Not just that, the team anticipated that it would attract a lot of liquidity, since it's essentially how to describe arbitram.
00:20:41.914 - 00:21:26.222, Speaker B: It's like the proud son of Ethereum mainnet. It's like what Ethereum Mainnet always wanted to be in high school. And then Arbitrum comes out, and it's like, all right, son, I'm living vicariously through you right now. We're like, okay, if this is the case, and there's a lot of capital here to be captured. And so a combination of wanting to innovate a little bit further and kind of start fresh with those innovations and wanting to capitalize on a first mover advantage on a new and improved kind of like chain that arbitram. The decision was made near September of 2020 to move from finance smart chain to arbitrum. And essentially, that's what happened.
00:21:26.222 - 00:22:06.438, Speaker B: And so there was a migration period where all the platform tokens, it was like, you can convert it for a certain amount to GMX, and then we are where we are now. So there was that migration period, and that was, for me, when I was like, okay, I'm not going to get any other chance. Everyone talks about all those big value plays in crypto. It's always like, ground floor kind of situations, really, at the end of the day. And so for me, it was like, all right, this is fundamentally sound, but also, this is like, ground floor situation. I did the migration, blah, blah, blah. When I got into migration, it was the community that was like, the third cells.
00:22:06.438 - 00:22:29.694, Speaker B: Like, wow, the developers are very communicative. They answer people's questions. They don't, unfortunately, is a little bit common in certain crypto spaces. You ask too hard questions, and the devs or the mods start to get uncomfortable with that or whatnot. But I never saw that the case with GMX. And eventually they were, you know, we're starting to branch out. We want help with partnerships.
00:22:29.694 - 00:22:53.340, Speaker B: I'm like, this is something I've done before, and I really believe in this project. And so I decided to help out with those. And that's pretty much what I do now. I just help essentially guide the partnership specifically on our arbitrum deploy. And I'm just looking really to know, position GMX as that kind of fundamental, structured product that Defi will kind of flourish from.
00:22:55.230 - 00:23:41.450, Speaker A: Hey, Fred, why don't we briefly walk through what the decentralized perpetuals platform looks like, whether someone's going to long or short, or even just use the swap? Because I think that'll open up some more questions about how the capital pool works. So let me just pull this up on screen and call out anything here you think is worth noting. But if anyone's ever traded. Here we go. Trying to zoom it. If anyone's ever traded on any perpetuals exchange, whether it's centralized or decentralized here is where I'm either going to long or short with leverage. So let's say I want to put up one ETH and I want to trade with up to 20 x leverage.
00:23:41.450 - 00:25:03.298, Speaker A: What's really driving a lot of the fees within GMX is the fact that I'm borrowing ether here to trade with a larger position. And you can see here the fees in this example, I'd be paying 0.1% of just the position size to open that up, on top of the fact that I'm paying a borrowing fee here of zero point 49%/hour so this really adds up. Actually, one of my questions for you, Fred, whether we talk about it an hour or later, is I've wondered whether these borrowing fees are sustainable. Like, I've loved it as a GLP holder, because I'm on the other end of this, which I'm going to hop over here. If I am a GLP holder, I'm owning a share of this liquidity pool or liquidity index. And so when traders pay fees, I'm earning a share of those fees, whether it's borrowing for leverage, opening a position, exiting a position, trading on the market, swap here, I'm holding this index here of all these tokens.
00:25:03.298 - 00:25:39.690, Speaker A: But the fees over time, that I really want to note here, which is really, I think what's driven a lot of attention on GMX is. Let me zoom out. So here's GLP. This is on arbitrum, they're also on avalanche, the APR, which this is purely in, denominated in ETH. It's currently 28%. And this is pretty standard as of late, I guess. I don't know for how many weeks we've been sitting around 28, 30%.
00:25:39.690 - 00:26:22.650, Speaker A: But this isn't like a spike in interest. This is sustainable yield denominated in ETH without us even receiving an inflationary type of token as a reward. In this case, escrow GMX, which normally vests over a single year. So anyways, those are the two sides of the coin, the GLP holders versus those who are actually trading with leverage or potentially swapping. Let me go back to this. Or you could even potentially just swap here. And all of this trading activity is based on Chainlink oracles.
00:26:22.650 - 00:26:45.218, Speaker A: So I really want to emphasize this is one of the few places where in Defi, you can trade with a lot of size. I mean, you can trade with a lot of liquidity, a lot more than, I think, what you're limited to in certain pools on an amm just because of the way it works differently.
00:26:45.394 - 00:26:45.926, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:46.028 - 00:26:52.758, Speaker A: I'll pause there. Fred, what else should we note here? Anything there to add to?
00:26:52.924 - 00:27:38.902, Speaker B: No, you brought up a lot of good points to kind of touch up on. So to go back to your first question, so the borrowing rates are actually a little bit dynamic. And so I think, to answer your question, generally, I think for the most part, for now, especially on the assets that we do have listed, they are going to be pretty sustainable. The borrowing rates are essentially partly a variable in its overall formula function in which the asset weights are also considered. And that's one of the ways that GMX kind of. Yeah, so if you want to scroll down there. So for know, if you look there at DAI, there will probably be a lot cheaper of a borrowing rate to short a position and receive die in that position because there's a lot of it there.
00:27:38.902 - 00:28:03.950, Speaker B: And so that is to say that generally one of the ways that GMX helps to incentivize the trader experience is to offer really competitive rates. And those offerings are simply based on whether or not there's a particular asset in a pool that's overweight and underweight. And so they do change, essentially. And you can view those on the stats page, which I'm not sure if you want to check that out now or later, but.
00:28:04.020 - 00:28:15.266, Speaker A: Oh yeah, let's hop over to that instead. Which chart would you like me to? I'm going to go ahead and reshare a different tab here. Which chart should we look at?
00:28:15.368 - 00:28:35.682, Speaker B: Yeah, it's closer to the bottom. It's the borrowing rates. It's the one that has the craziest lines of all the line graphs there. And it'll just kind of demonstrate the live and dynamic kind of nature of the borrowing fees. So I believe it's a little bit lower down right there. Yeah. Borrowing rate annualized.
00:28:35.682 - 00:29:15.510, Speaker B: So you can kind of see a lot of different, it spikes essentially, as I said, with the opportunistic minting and burning of GLP and the weights of assets in the pool. And so what I like about it is essentially there's no need to have like a centralized, it's centralized as a matter of execution. Right. It's the GMX platform executing these borrowing rates. But it's a disintermediated activity because it's partly related to how users are minting or burning GLP and the rate at which those bits of capital are being utilized actually on the platform, which is, to me, I think, pretty neat.
00:29:16.570 - 00:30:11.414, Speaker A: Yeah. So one other simple part of, I think the user experience if someone ends up holding GLP. And this kind of goes back to the way incentives work to drive anyone to either be minting GLP with a certain token or burning and withdrawing certain tokens. Go back to this. Let's pretend I'm wanting to own some GLP and potentially earn fees so I can look here at the weights and I can start to see that ETH is underweighted. Wrapped bitcoin is underweighted, but USDC is overweighted. It's currently at 40% of the index and the target weight is 36%.
00:30:11.414 - 00:31:16.654, Speaker A: So then I hop over here to buy GLP on arbitrum, and here's where I can start to understand. What are the fees below here? So let's say I just noted that ETH was, I think ETH was underweighted. So if I were to mint or buy some GLP, the fee that I'm going to pay here is zero point 16%. So that's for ETH, or that's buying with ETH. That's depositing ETH into the pool versus something like, let's say tether, which is currently underweight tether, the fee is 0.3%. So I'm incentivized, of course, to deposit tether versus something like ether versus something like USDC. And then on the flip side of that, if I go to sell or burn GLP, and this, by the way, everything I'm saying sort of ties back to the way that the borrowing rates work, as far as I know.
00:31:16.654 - 00:32:11.260, Speaker A: Fred, correct me if I'm misunderstanding, but I am incentivized here to pull from tokens that are in excess versus not pull from those that are not within excess. So, like USDC, if I were to go in here and say I'm going to burn 10,000 GLP and withdraw back to USDC, I should have a better rate. We'll see here, zero point 28% for USDC versus zero point 34% for ETH. So again, ETH is scarcer than USDC. I pay a little bit less to withdraw on USDC, but same thing then, Fred, with borrowing, I can borrow USDC for cheaper right now than ETH, which is.
00:32:14.190 - 00:32:24.850, Speaker B: Does a little, it does depend a little bit too, as well, if you're taking the long or short, because, for instance, shorts are paid out in stable specifically. But yes, that's the basic logic that holds.
00:32:25.430 - 00:32:27.140, Speaker A: Makes sense. Yeah.
00:32:27.510 - 00:33:18.820, Speaker B: And I was just going to say, what's cool about that is when you look at it at a kind of zoomed out kind of macro scale GMX turns GLP, the overall index, into this kind of larger market activity where a bunch of different actors engage in the portfolio management of the GLP index in the way that you might expect a traditional financial actor to essentially manage a portfolio by selectively taking out certain assets based on its targeted weights, which is what I think is also pretty neat. Right? It's an actual financial activity that we see in the real world because it's valuable and it's now being know with the GMX platform, which I think is cool.
00:33:19.670 - 00:34:00.170, Speaker A: Fred, can you kind of dumb down for us day to day what's going on in know there's those who are depositing tokens and we just sort of showed that those who are depositing, they're being incentivized or disincentivized based on how much of that token already exists in the index. There's those who are withdrawing who again play by similar rules, but just the reverse of the incentives for depositors. But what is actually happening to keep this index closer to these targeted weights?
00:34:00.330 - 00:34:09.220, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So if you don't mind, I'm going to ask you real quick to go back to the GMX IO dashboard real quick. And we're just going to.
00:34:11.990 - 00:34:14.680, Speaker A: Go back to that. Here we go.
00:34:16.250 - 00:34:30.220, Speaker B: Yeah. Shout out to the front end UI guys from the GMX team because this is easily one of the more informative front ends that I think a protocol, sometimes you get on a protocol and it's just like what am I looking at and what do I look at first?
00:34:31.310 - 00:35:24.410, Speaker A: It is actually those stats at stats GMX IO, that was what moved the needle for me when I was starting to learn about GMX and seeing in real time what's the performance of GLP, what is it with fees? Of course, some of the simpler things that you want to see, like an uptick in swap volume and how many users are using the platform. Honestly, the PNL of traders is just fascinating to look at because I think of holding GLP. This isn't a recommendation or endorsement to hold GLP, but since I hold it, I think about it as I'm holding keys to a casino and everyone's trading and they're trading with leverage and then I'm sitting there scooping up the fees as they do so. But anyways, Fred.
00:35:24.830 - 00:35:46.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to say, I like to think of it as just being properly compensated for being the counterparty risk. I like to put it in those terms. In many ways, people like to use that terminology. But yeah, that's how we like to think of it more here on our side, is just properly compensating those people that make our platform.
00:35:48.470 - 00:36:50.050, Speaker A: Oh, and by the way, everything that we're showing here, too, I want to remind anyone, obviously, this isn't a passive strategy. I mean, I can sit on GLP, but to be clear, GLP is composed of about 50% stablecoins, 50% volatile tokens, and so on any given day. This isn't exact, of course, but most days, if, let's say, ETH moves up 10%, GLP tends to move about 5% upwards. And if ETH falls 10%, GLP tends to make 50% of that move and falls only 5%. But then that doesn't count, of course, the added fees that are being earned, which is, I think, a part of the reward here to being counterparty to some of these trades. But Fred, I cut you off earlier on. What did you want to call out here on the stats on the dashboard for GMX?
00:36:50.210 - 00:37:09.390, Speaker B: So let's check out the overview quadrant real quick there if you want to zoom in a little bit. And so you wanted to kind of talk about and help show the audience what's really going on underneath the hood with GLP. Exactly right. So first I want to draw mentioned too, is if you scroll back up just a little bit there.
00:37:09.460 - 00:37:10.240, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:37:12.290 - 00:38:01.274, Speaker B: Perfect. So you'll see there, it'll show you the dollar amount of the GLP pool. So I like to think of that as like the GLP Aum. So currently there's about $285,000,000 in TVL for GLP. And if you look just a little bit below that, you have long and short positions. And if you combine those together, I'd say my best napkin math here is probably about a little bit under 100 million in open interest between long and shorts. So what's going on here in terms of GLP for the platform is that essentially all that capital tied up in open interest is capital that's essentially being used from the index and being actively managed for perpetual swaps.
00:38:01.274 - 00:39:21.634, Speaker B: So users either long or short are using that capital in GLP, and then they're paying to use that capital in the way that they are, in this case, borrowing it to enter a position larger than they otherwise would have had, and they're paying the borrowing fees to do that and so on and so forth. And any other insightful mind would be like, okay, I get how in one way, GLP is using capital to generate revenue for that purpose. And they'd say, okay, that's only $100 million. There's about another 185,000,000 unaccounted for. Is that just sitting idle there? What's going on with that capital? The other reality is that the rest of that capital is being utilized by swaps, essentially. So not only are regular individual users swapping on GMX to kind of get those really neat, zero impact experiences that are kind of almost like over the trade or over the counter kind of trades, but we also have this capability where aggregators can integrate into our swap function. And so not only are we relying on just individual users to swap on GMX, but protocols like one inch protocols like Paraswap, protocols like Matcha, there are also protocols like warden swap as well on arbitram.
00:39:21.634 - 00:40:17.980, Speaker B: Right. They all also integrate their swap aggregators into GMX. So any capital that I call essentially like idle GLP capital that isn't actively tied up in open interest is still being used by those aggregators whenever GMX offers a better rate, obviously, than any other decks to route through. And so we have this situation where on one hand, about half of the AUM, or a little bit less than half of the AUM and DLP is being actively used to generate revenue for perpetuals, and the other half is kind of quote unquote, sitting idle to be used for swaps, and both of those activities together generate this really neat, sustainable revenue stream that then essentially gets parsed out to the people who help, know or provide liquidity for the platform. And of course, a portion going to the GMX stakeholders who support and want to see the platform grow.
00:40:19.710 - 00:40:48.770, Speaker A: Fred, quick question on the open long and short positions here. So if, let's say we have about 100 million in open positions, is that incorporated then into this GLP pool? Would I estimate then that there's like 185,000,000 of the 285 80 in the GLP pool?
00:40:49.270 - 00:41:17.340, Speaker B: Kind of. So it's a trickier question to ask, and honestly, probably a bit better if we had one of the desks for that. But how I understand it to work is essentially, yes, because not all of those open interest positions are profitable, necessarily. Some of them are obviously, like close to liquidation. And so it would essentially be capital that while it's in the opening position, if it's closed or liquidated, that would actually be capital returned to the GLP Aum as opposed to taken out of.
00:41:18.430 - 00:42:31.940, Speaker A: Cool. Okay, one final question, because I know we're going to need to wrap up here soon. Can you talk about what is being done, basically to ensure that all trades can be settled with GLP? What sort of work is being done to basically ensure that GLP as a pool doesn't collapse. I think there's quite a bit of PTSD within the community. Within the community from having not asked harder questions about protocols like anchor and everything that was going on on terra. This is a totally separate protocol, and not to draw connections at all between GMX and Terra, but I just mean to ask, what is the team doing? I guess to ensure that GMX as a decentralized perpetuals exchange can continue to settle trades reliably, that we don't accrue like any sort of bad debt and so on.
00:42:32.630 - 00:43:55.678, Speaker B: Yeah, so great question. The first of those measures, right, those safety guard measures is the utilization cap. And this is, I guess one of the hard limits of any kind of defi protocol is unlike a sex, where a centralized exchange, they can actually kind of technically provide users the ability to enter large size because they kind of have that liquidity as those large institutions. With GMX, there is quite literally a sort of utilization cap in the sense that if you want to open a long or short, but the capital simply isn't there for the amount of leverage that you want, you'll have to of course scale back your leverage to whatever is the possible limit to be given out from the GLP pool. So that's the first. The other is the fact that also when GLP essentially gives a user a position, the users take up the USD position and not the actual asset parity position, you know what I mean? Which is something that would be a lot more difficult to do because then you have two assets that are moving at very different rates relative like one other asset, you know what I mean? So it's a lot easier and it's a lot more consistent when we just give users the USD price essentially that they enter at. So it's those two things working together.
00:43:55.678 - 00:44:17.430, Speaker B: And that does mean, and again, this is not like a risk free platform or anything like that. It does mean that there are situations where GLP could be potentially locked up in the meantime, while position is open for it to eventually be paid out or liquidated in the event that, say, people try to exit GLP, but there are still traders with open positions.
00:44:18.490 - 00:44:19.462, Speaker A: There we go.
00:44:19.596 - 00:44:52.100, Speaker B: And the cool part about that is while you're still locked into that position, you're still getting paid to be, I shouldn't use paid, but you're still being compensated incentivized with those wrapped ethereum emissions as that liquidity provider. So it's not entirely end all, be all that is like the scary black swan event. But there is still kind of like that silver lining in that you're still getting your wrapped east, even if in that black swan situation you're kind of like forced to hold your GLP until the position is figured out.
00:44:54.550 - 00:45:36.000, Speaker A: No, I think that's a fair rundown. Yeah. Part of what you described is like, locking in GLP holders while they're still open positions is one thing for me that was more reassuring about the design. But I think it's important if you want to poke holes in this, hop into the GMX discord. For me, I felt this is a pretty radical paradigm shift in terms of design using this composite pool. So I'll say just personally, I worry about what, I just don't know what. I don't understand, which is still quite a bit.
00:45:36.000 - 00:45:47.070, Speaker A: Fred, can we end on what is next for GMX? What product can we expect next? Or what can you share about what's coming in the product roadmap?
00:45:47.230 - 00:46:30.158, Speaker B: Yeah, this is probably what I'm most excited about for GMX. The next two things that GMX really has on the roadmap are pretty exciting. So the first is our synthetic PvP market making kind of liquidity product. So what that does is it will allow users to trade more assets in terms of perpetuals besides what GLP allows. And that was kind of decision between, or it emerged between having to consider what assets do you want to expose GLP to as an index as opposed to like a composite capital pool. Right. Because that is one of the cool.
00:46:30.158 - 00:47:26.980, Speaker B: But also interesting things about GLP is that it does attract people who are just there for the passive earnings, or not just the passive earnings, but the fact that GLP is composed of those pretty kind of large cap blue chip crypto. So that is to say, there was pushback when people were like, why don't we add doge? Or why don't we add some other token that might get a lot of volume on perpetuals? Because people like to short doge or ripple or something like that. And it's like, I mean, it's cool and it makes business sense. But it does also put into question the kind of like, price integrity of GLP, which has made it such a strong product. So we're like, why don't we just kind of push all of those longer tail assets, as we like to call them, to a different kind of like, liquidity model. So that's going to be our PvP model. And so it's also going to be more direct in terms of funding, meaning if you take like a long or short position and you're paying that funding rate.
00:47:26.980 - 00:48:33.750, Speaker B: Others will essentially receive that funding rate that you're paying to take the opposite side of the trade. And so it's going to be a really cool situation where not only will users be able to trade other assets outside of what GLP allows, but they'll be able to take positions with positive funding rates, get paid to take certain positions, and essentially kind of just battle other dgens out there, kind of put their trading skills to the test. And of course, for anyone who's kind of been keeping up with the whole tokenomic model of GMX, that does mean that 30% of whatever revenue that generates will be going to GMX holders as well, which is pretty exciting. And then the next and final product that is kind of, I don't mean final in terms of the last thing we're ever making. Just kind of like in terms of the roadmap as it's conceived right now is X four. So that's the protocol controlled Amm. So this is more of a classic XyK Amm, but what's cool about it is that it kind of really opens up what is possible for a protocol to control.
00:48:33.750 - 00:49:35.398, Speaker B: So Uniswap has like V three with these controlled liquidity bands that you can kind of tightly control. What X four would allow you to do is not only do things like different kinds of liquidity bands or whatever, but it would allow users or protocols to have dynamic fees on certain functions of a transaction. So a different fee for selling versus buying, which might be an interesting mechanism for a stable coin or something like that. If you want to start thinking about how this could be applied or whatnot. And so the idea of that is to give protocols way more control and saying how they deploy their liquidity and gives them a lot more opportunity to kind of allow the community that they're wanting to kind of cultivate to essentially have different ways of interacting with their liquidity besides just how, say, something like uniswap or sushi swap kind of just forces them into. I don't want to use that language. That's just the presets that we have, uniswap and sushi swap.
00:49:35.398 - 00:49:38.800, Speaker B: And so there's a lot more we can do. And so that's what X Four is seeking to do.
00:49:39.410 - 00:50:16.700, Speaker A: Very interesting. Yeah. Well, I would encourage everyone, if you want to learn more about GMX, go to GMX IO. You can follow GMX and Fred on Twitter. Fred actually has a really fantastic thread recently, kind of talking all about what makes the composite pool model so special and how that will lead into future products, some of which you just covered there and otherwise. Man, great to meet you. I really appreciate you coming on to talk with me and just congrats to you and the team on all the success so far.
00:50:16.700 - 00:50:48.382, Speaker A: It's been, I think, a pretty remarkable ride for you all since the start of the year, despite the success you had in the fall 2021. And I think if you can build during volatile markets like this, especially with everything, all the noise in the macro, you're poised for much more success in the future here. So just thanks so much for being able to talk with us about all you have planned.
00:50:48.526 - 00:51:04.200, Speaker B: Yeah, no, thank you for having me. Big fan of your Twitter page and everything. You kind of got me on the whole mindset of fundamental analysis for crypto. So really great to be on the show and I'm glad to share some of the awesome things that GMX has coming up.
00:51:04.570 - 00:51:25.546, Speaker A: Dude, absolutely. No, that's awesome to hear. I love to hear. So anyways, thanks everyone again for tuning in.
