00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.454, Speaker A: ZKVM is the connection of two topics to narrative. One is zk roll up, and the other is EVM. And why EVM is important, it's because it's today the lingua franca of the blockchain world. So EVM is very important to preserve in terms of security that brings to the system, in terms of availability of development knowledge. And then the third point is that a huge industry has been built around Ethereum today. And then we can talk about ZK roll up. So ZK roll up is essentially an infrastructure where you have a layer one smart contract that does three things.
00:00:34.454 - 00:00:59.660, Speaker A: It's the custodian of the assets within the roll up. It maintains on chain the state of the virtual machine, exactly like a database. And then as a mechanism to update the state. And then we send this proof together with the final state it back onto the layer one with a Zklap. Then you can consider the system final. You can immediately withdraw your money, you can do all the things that you want, and it's very, very fast.
