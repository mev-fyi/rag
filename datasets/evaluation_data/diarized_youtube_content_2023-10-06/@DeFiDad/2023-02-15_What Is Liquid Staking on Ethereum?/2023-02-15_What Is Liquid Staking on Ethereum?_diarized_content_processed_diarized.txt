00:00:00.000 - 00:00:31.220, Speaker A: So on Ethereum blockchain, you can stake and run a validator if you have 32 Ethereum, which is right now pretty expensive. I think that with the current, today's pump is close to $50,000. So a lot of people who don't have that ability and also don't have the technical know how to run a validator end up usually choosing liquid staking derivatives. A liquid staking derivative is sort of like a coupon or an IOU statement. You give your ETH, your cold ETH, and in return you get a representation of that ETH, but someone else is staking it.
