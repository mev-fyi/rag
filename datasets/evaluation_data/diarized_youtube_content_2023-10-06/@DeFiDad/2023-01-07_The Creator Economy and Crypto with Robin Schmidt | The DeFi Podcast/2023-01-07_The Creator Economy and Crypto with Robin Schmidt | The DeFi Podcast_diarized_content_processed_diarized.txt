00:00:00.570 - 00:01:06.618, Speaker A: Hey, welcome to the show. Before we get started, this interview is actually from October 2022. I had the pleasure of interviewing Robin just a short time after he moved on from his very well known role as the head of media and video at the Defiant. Robin is one of the most admirable people I've had the privilege of getting to know and working with on a number of projects. Few you probably know that he built the defined YouTube page from zero to more than 100,000 subscribers in less than a year. And he did it completely the old fashioned way by producing the most creative, wacky, and straight up entertaining storytelling on the world of DFI and of course, the other adjacent web three worlds. After you watch or listen to this interview, please be sure to visit based and if you follow at we underscore r underscore based AF on Twitter, you can watch the trailer that Robin and his team recently released for his new secretive project called based AF.
00:01:06.618 - 00:01:59.890, Speaker A: I honestly have no idea what to expect from it, but Robin has a history of using his creative abilities to make interesting commentaries on matters often relating to the crypto space, while also using the most new and experimental tools and protocols to entertain us. And so I hope you check out base Dayf and hope you enjoy the show. Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This is Defi talks with Defi dad. I'm going to be interviewing here, Robin Schmidt, who is formerly the head of video and media at the Defiant. I've known Robin for, I think, about two years now, and kind of always seen Robin as, like, an unofficial mentor.
00:01:59.890 - 00:02:28.860, Speaker A: He is, I think, one of the most respected content creators and creatives in the web, three crypto, Defi, whatever you want to call this space. And so Robin recently had mentioned that he'd been thinking a lot about the creator economy and crypto. And so I want to talk with him all about that intersection today. So on that note, Robin, welcome, man. How are you doing?
00:02:29.230 - 00:02:59.998, Speaker B: I'm good, man. You're just making me nostalgic here, remembering how this all began. DFI summer 2020, you were the man. I don't think you realize quite how much you were the man. Making yield farming makes sense. And you were one of the first people making content about it, and people were following you on Twitter and following your expirations on that. And so when we had a chance to work together on D 5101, I was like, there's nobody better to help kind of teach people what this is going to be.
00:02:59.998 - 00:03:35.460, Speaker B: So you wrote scripts for us, and then we kind of take those scripts and turn them into something that we could shoot quickly. But, yeah, man, don't do yourself an injustice here. You were one of the early people to this space, and I think you've come out of this not really having changed. What happened in 21 hasn't changed you. You are still the same person that you were, still the same D five dad. And that's to your great credit, because I think a lot of people did change and saw lots of big numbers and saw lots of success, and that now dealing with the repercussions of that, you're not one of them.
00:03:36.230 - 00:04:43.974, Speaker A: I appreciate that. It's funny, this is part of the reason we're having this conversation. I think that we've seen, as creatives in this space storytellers, at the end of the day, we've seen the rise from everyone looking at us like we're a bunch of crazies to be interested in DFI thinking that. I remember in 2020, people thought it was a bubble at the time, all the way back in 2020, and it would go on to grow that much more. But again, one of the things we'll talk about here now is I want to cover how you think about the incentives as a creator and how web three can potentially improve those alignments of incentives, but also how it can also corrupt you. It hasn't solved everything. I think we've seen that the inclusion of tokens, NFTs and everything else under the sun, that is an application of web three.
00:04:43.974 - 00:05:15.940, Speaker A: It can lead to just the same sort of poor incentives. It can lead to bad behavior. It's just using, like, a newer technology. That said, though, I think we're all optimistic that there is actually a better path forward, and that also boomerangs into more of the work that you're doing with based aF. So, Robin, do you want to kick off with a bit more about your background, just brief history of all that you've been involved with, from filmed music videos to what you do today?
00:05:16.470 - 00:06:02.734, Speaker B: Well, yes, way back in the midst of time. We're talking 1999 here. A young Robin was obsessed with film, but didn't think film was a career he could actually embark on, and got an opportunity to work at a company where they had a camcorder. But the thing that made this all actually possible was there was an imac, and an imac back then with this big bulbous thing with a big ass on it, big, round ass, beautiful thing, very poorly powered by today's standards. But the thing it could do was it could edit video so you could plug your camcorder in via a Firewire cable, stream video out, capture onto a hard drive and edit it. This blew my mind, because suddenly you had access to filmmaking tools. Final cut pro one.
00:06:02.734 - 00:06:28.674, Speaker B: It was Janky as hell. Most of it didn't work. It was a terrible piece of software, but it was on a Mac, and it had that feeling of creativity, because Macs were where creative work happened. So I was a Mac head at the time, and I turned that into a desire to be funny enough, a TV presenter. So I put together a TV show that I tried to sell to broadcasters. Shot a pilot. Dreadful.
00:06:28.674 - 00:07:01.858, Speaker B: Absolutely dreadful. But in the process of that, I met a guy who had a camera, and he had a bunch of snowboarding footage, and I cut together a reel out of his snowboarding footage because I taught myself how to edit, and it was actually really good. We took it to the ski show in London, and somebody there saw it and said, I'm making a film this winter. Do you guys want to come out and make it with me? It's one of those random encounters. Just showed him the film on the screen of this camera. So it's like tiny little screen. We just showed the editing, everything.
00:07:01.858 - 00:07:30.220, Speaker B: It just happened. What he needed more than anything else was people who could shoot and edit, and we had that. So we then went off to Verbia in Switzerland, shot for a whole season, and that became the start of my career. So I started making ski, snowboarding, base jumping films, and I did it with this guy that had the camera footage, Joel Mishkon. And we set up a company, Chrome Productions. And then for the next eight years, that was our company. So at 22, 1st startup was a video production company.
00:07:30.220 - 00:07:59.474, Speaker B: Learned so much. This is a job I had not studied to do. I barely knew anything. But what's interesting about is that we were creators in a way the creators are now. It's just there wasn't YouTube back then. There wasn't a way to monetize your passion for this stuff, except by going and making crap videos and trying to persuade someone that you could make better videos if they gave you a bit of money. And then just working your way up.
00:07:59.474 - 00:08:18.422, Speaker B: Working your way up. And then the budgets got a bit bigger, you could buy slightly better cameras than you could rent. So we just worked our way up. Music videos, strange sports. Then we got into TV, and then we got into kind of commercial stuff. We did a bunch of wedding films, which, like, just horrible. Extreme sports was our bread and butter.
00:08:18.422 - 00:08:45.010, Speaker B: And again, this is before YouTube and before GoPros. So instead of a GoPro, you'd have this lipstick camera thing about that long and had a cable out the back, and then it had to have a CCD unit to process the signal. And then that signal would get spat out into a camcorder via an S video cable. Terrible quality. And if you pointed it at the sun, you'd have this massive white bar, which is like, that's cool, bro, cool. I really. The resolution was like 280 p or something.
00:08:45.010 - 00:09:11.050, Speaker B: It's just insane. If you put that frame on, like a 4K video, it'd be like this big. Utterly insane, but stuff like that. And then if you had the head cam stuff, you'd have to have a camcorder here and then a bag of sugar here on the helmet to balance it out because it was so heavy. Utterly stupid. So I worked my way through, up through all of that, left that company after eight years. It's still going, amazingly enough, doing amazing work now.
00:09:11.050 - 00:09:48.246, Speaker B: So it's kind of nice to see the company we started had the legs to last 25 years, which is just insane. And then kind of worked my way into YouTube in about 2012. So I started doing YouTube, then doing some comedy stuff, and we went viral almost instantly. It was bizarre. We just kind of tapped into something, and we did 15 videos on one character that we'd made and then 15 videos of another thing that we'd done. And then we just stopped because I had kids and it was just impossible to see ourselves doing that as a career because there was no money in it. And then I shot a feature film, 2016.
00:09:48.246 - 00:10:31.186, Speaker B: And then I think that's basically when things got real because we had two kids. And the stuff I was doing, I was doing a lot of comedy stuff, comedy commercials. It just wasn't really consistent enough. So we made the kind of decision to move to Holland. And that's where I started doing TV commercials and started doing really soulless consumer products, like an air fryer or a vacuum cleaner or a coffee machine, and, like, tons of money, tons of budget to do these films, but just soulless. And you'd have to get them tested by teams in Poland and Germany and Japan. And everyone has their little piece, and by the end of it, you're just like, well, this is not a film.
00:10:31.186 - 00:11:23.030, Speaker B: This is a collection of images that have no soul. And my boss at the time, we went for a trip down to Belgium, and on the way, he told me about this cryptocurrency he bought and how sort of blown up. And I sort of started thinking about, it's like, where am I going with things? Well, this crypto thing sounds weird and interesting, and I just fell down the rabbit hole. Turned out the cryptocurrency was ETH, and that was 2017, just early 2017. So I saw that whole bull run and I wasn't even wasting content for crypto at that point, but I was just observing and through that process, kind of gotten myself into investment syndicates and invested in harmony at the seed rant. So I got in touch with Harmony and said, I think you guys are interesting and have an interesting story. I'd love to tell it.
00:11:23.030 - 00:12:16.934, Speaker B: And I kept in contact with them for twelve months and then had an opportunity to go to San Francisco. So I went to meet them and got on really well with them and just really kind of found myself fascinated by the way they were set up in Silicon Valley, conversations they would have, the enthusiasm they had for the technology and the way they were building it in this hacker house. Just like, this is wild. This is the inception of something really that feels massive, but it's just a bunch of people in a house building it. And the long and the short is they ended up offering me a job as their creative director, which I took as this massive left turn in my career just to kind of figure out a new path. And that ended up putting me in contact with Camilla. And then we did the defiant video channel together because I was trying to get harmony to have a footprint in Defi because we could see Defi was going to be huge.
00:12:16.934 - 00:12:42.810, Speaker B: But Harmony was still kind of struggling through early stages of Mainnet and I wanted us to have a story to tell about Defi. So I thought, let's partner up with someone. I reached out to Ryan, Sean Adams at Bangkok, sent him one email. I said, basically, I'm at harmony, but would really love to talk to you guys about doing video. And he wrote me back and said, oh, yeah, video. That could be interesting. And I said, well, yeah, sure, let's set up a meeting.
00:12:42.810 - 00:13:01.414, Speaker B: Never had that for him. Got ghosted by Ryan. So that was that. And I had this connection with Camilla and Camilla didn't ghost me, so. Camilla, yeah, but I mean, like, great story. How different things could have been if Ryan hadn't ghosted me. I don't know if he remembers that.
00:13:01.452 - 00:13:07.350, Speaker A: But yeah, I'm going to totally cut that clip so that to share this later. That's fantastic.
00:13:08.410 - 00:13:50.070, Speaker B: You made a big mistake there, budy. I probably stir up the email as well. Yeah, I know, it's weird, right? But I mean, to be honest with you, my style of making videos wouldn't fit with bankless at all, it would have been a very different show. And also I think the interesting thing is I became the face of what is the defy video and Ryan and David are very much the face of that. So would I been in competition with them, would have lived in a different thing? I don't know. But anyway, it's probably for the best that it didn't work out that way. And so after a while of doing this sort of combined coproduction thing, came in a basis, said, listen, I'm raising money and if we get the funds together, I'd love you to come and be the head of video and multimedia for this new team.
00:13:50.070 - 00:13:55.240, Speaker B: So I said yes. And then two years later I left.
00:13:57.050 - 00:13:57.526, Speaker A: Which is.
00:13:57.548 - 00:13:59.350, Speaker B: And it would only be made in crypto.
00:13:59.430 - 00:14:28.322, Speaker A: Yeah, that's like two decades. I love my team at fourth Revolution Capital and I'm like, I've been here, I've been with the team for about almost a year and a half and I was with Zapper for a year, with consensus for two years. It's not a reflection of anything in my experience. It's just things move quickly and folks move. It's. But it's exciting for what's next then it is.
00:14:28.456 - 00:15:45.386, Speaker B: And looking back on my time with the defiant and also at harmony as well, the exposure to ideas at the very highest level, the opportunity to talk to stakeholders, to developers, to people who are building stuff, but people who also in contact with regulators, talking to NFT projects, I got a chance to speak to everybody and that was really valuable because what you have in that privileged position of being an interviewer is you just have a ringside seat. The best ideas, and not all of them are good, but some of them might be ahead of their time, some of them might be behind their time, but you have the opportunity to do that because you've built an audience. And the weird thing about the define is that we got it up to kind of 117,000 subscribers and that was through a very pumpy time as well. So it's probably not a fair reflection of the median for all of that. But at the same time it was with us and Bangladesh. We were kind of the only two places where you would get this particular type of content, and then a whole bunch of other content creators grew up around it as well. But we had that audience and we had enough prestige in the brand to get good people and have a really good conversation with them.
00:15:45.386 - 00:16:37.900, Speaker B: And there were so many memorable moments, but also in our kind of highest points of output, we were doing six videos a week. We were doing a show with real vision, but that was always like, you had to be on point for the real vision show. We just had to research a lot and get in the weeds with a lot of protocols and just expose myself, particularly doing tutorials and things, which honestly, I hate doing tutorials, it's not my happy place, but forced me to go in deep, understand a protocol, understand how it worked. And that was always really good fun because you could sometimes see that they weren't going to work. But also, I mean, I'm pretty optimistic in everything that I do and I just got to see some really funky, quirky stuff and that was sort of the best of D five, just these weird experiments to see where they would go.
00:16:38.270 - 00:17:54.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I know with tutorials it can be a little bit overwhelming at first when you're starting to dig into something new, but then as you dig further, once you figure it out, you actually, if anything, start to notice these trends across all these different protocols and applications. And I think something for me that has been a little bit of a letdown in the past year is just. Doesn't feel like there's been really much new. It's always like a regurgitated form of something that already exists with a slight tweak. Now, I think the bear market is for more innovative stuff to start to get recreated for the first time, which will hopefully then drive new applications, a richer sort of application ecosystem that will be interesting for the next new set of web three D five users. But no doubt we've been in somewhat of a repetitive cycle. One thing I want to go back to before we talk specifically about the creator economy is when you were shifting gears to go work at harmony, you mentioned having kids.
00:17:54.820 - 00:18:28.400, Speaker A: I also remember this pivot, having kids. At the time, I actually had one very young kid. I think my son was like one year old. And it's hard. It's really hard because even back then you knew how high risk the crypto space looked, but yet you made the leap as well. Do you recall any of the thinking that you went through that told you this is the right move, high risk. But for some reason I know that this is the right path for me.
00:18:29.090 - 00:18:58.402, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, for sure. I was working at a production company, like I said, basically working as a studio director. So I would shoot the projects they would put in front of me. Like I said, on paper they looked amazing, but it was just grinding me down, soul destroying me, because I would turn up and I would do the best job that I possibly could. But there was just nothing creative about it. You're just filling in boxes on a sheet going, we need this shot. We need this shot.
00:18:58.402 - 00:19:18.606, Speaker B: This shot. We need this shot for Poland. We need this shot for France. We need to shot. And after a while, that just becomes horrible, at least for me. For some people, I think there would be plenty of joy to be found from that. But I've been doing this job for a long time, and the things that I enjoy are sort of pushing myself and testing myself to see creatively what I can come up with.
00:19:18.606 - 00:20:06.378, Speaker B: And I think that was probably present in the defined videos, particularly the defined weekly, where we just come up with some insane, stupid idea. That wasn't because we are insane and stupid, it's because that's what made it fun. And so I was at this place where I had lost that and the thing that saved me. I mean, this is ridiculous, but I started making what I called luxury gifts. This was 2018. I would just make the most insanely intricate, insanely high level, kind of motion captured, tracked faces, all this kind of stuff, gifs. And I have a whole channel with these things, and I would just challenge myself on the way into work on the train to just come up with an idea and execute it as a gif.
00:20:06.378 - 00:20:41.770, Speaker B: And that was just the thing that kept me creatively satisfied, which is insane, thinking about what I do now. But that was the thing that kind of saved me, and it was all for crypto stuff. So I was just making crypto gifts, capturing an idea, and then turning into something that was just absurd, absurdly high value. And the gifts are funny when they're janky and they don't work properly, and the faces just jump about. I wasn't doing that. I was doing, like, precision visual effects kind of stuff, because my background is editing and filming, and I do everything. So I was just having fun.
00:20:41.770 - 00:21:29.222, Speaker B: Just having fun. And then I just felt like it was time to do something different. And harmony, as much as it was a risk, was going to be a pretty significant salary bump. And it was an opportunity to work in crypto, but in a relatively safe way with a proper salary, proper contract. And it just felt like that was the right move. It was hard to sell it to the family at the time, but as it's turned out, that was definitely 100% the right move. And then it kind of carried on through to understanding the value I could provide to harmony was making videos, and then just kind of making the videos we wanted to make, making a bit of a name for ourselves through.
00:21:29.222 - 00:21:57.760, Speaker B: I mean, we were in the middle of the pandemic, we were just stuck inside. Life was tough, but we just kept hustling and putting videos out with 500 views, 600 views, but just kept doing it. And then the D five summer thing hit. We just started making videos the way D five felt and not necessarily the way it was. So not the Bloomberg approach, but like, all right, this is bananas. So when curve launches, I'm going to get hit in the face with the banana a lot. And then banana films for that video told that story.
00:21:57.760 - 00:22:22.946, Speaker B: So that became the template for it. Just people would expect wacky stuff from us, and it became a bit of a cult thing. And then 2021 happened, and then everything expanded, and then your audience gets bigger. You talk about terror, you talk about UST. And at the time, it was really fun, really exciting. Ankle was exciting, but also it made sense coming from DFI summer. That's what people forget.
00:22:22.946 - 00:22:36.366, Speaker B: DFI Summer completely changed our notions of what any of this stuff could be. Yield farming. Like the. There's just, it completely changed the game, and terra came off the back of that.
00:22:36.468 - 00:23:10.620, Speaker A: So I guess. What have you been ruminating on when you talk about this intersection of crypto and the creator economy? I kind of want to paint a picture of what came before us over before crypto, and then what's the state of that creator economy today? But what problems ultimately could be solved by some of this new tooling? So anyways, we could start with the basics, though, of how do you even just define that creator economy and the state of it?
00:23:11.150 - 00:23:58.866, Speaker B: Well, the creator economy is the business is around creators, and it's also the infrastructure and tools that companies provide to make that move better be easier to manage, because being a creator is a very volatile business. Like the ad revenue driven side of things is extremely volatile and trying to even that out throughout a year, particularly when you have to hire staff and you have overheads and that kind of thing, it's pretty difficult to manage. And so banks won't touch you. There's no infrastructure in place for that because you are other and different. If you're a freelancer, for instance, banking services are just a lot tougher. Getting a mortgage is tougher. Being a creator, it's even tougher because, as we know, it's just incredibly volatile.
00:23:58.866 - 00:24:35.810, Speaker B: You might be popular today, you might be not be popular tomorrow. So what has happened is that brands have realized that the relationships that creators have with their audience, particularly at scale, are immensely valuable and becoming increasingly valuable and a thing that they need to tap into. And it's no longer, just a case of pay the influencer, they will put out a message for you. Job done. No, you have to really think about partnerships. And creators are realizing they have a lot more power. And so the ones that are any good are able to manage that process and have better brand integrations.
00:24:35.810 - 00:25:20.642, Speaker B: And all of that comes with new kind of perils and other problems. But essentially the creative economy is that. So let's say you have a creator that's particularly good at Beauty and makeup. They might launch their own line of nails, for instance, or Emma Chamberlain has launched coffee, Mr. Beast has launched burgers. And there's these consumer products that these creators are putting out, and that's creating jobs, it's creating revenue, that's part of the economy. And then there's other services out there that enable them to make views go further, be seen by more people.
00:25:20.642 - 00:26:14.530, Speaker B: Translation services, so you can get your video translated for a brazilian audience, for instance. That's all feeding into the creator economy as well. So it's estimated around 100 billion. I have no idea how that estimate has been put together. It's pretty broad estimate, and I think it's probably skewed for one simple reason, which was, I don't know if you remember, but there was this disease called COVID, and it was like it forced everyone indoors, and then they all became creators. Do you remember that? So there was this boom in the creator economy when everyone was creating, and that's how we received the world that stopped. So a lot of the things that sprang up to cater to that in this very strange bubble are now struggling because the volume has dropped off.
00:26:14.530 - 00:27:11.010, Speaker B: And doesn't that sound familiar? If you come from crypto and web three, that sounds very familiar. It doesn't necessarily mean that the crater economy is dead, far from it. But if you're looking at an ad based revenue system and looking at the macroeconomic conditions, the two things do not add up. So as much as I'm positive about the creator economy and the relationships between creators and brands of where there could be some really interesting opportunities there, I think it depends on the niche you're in and the sector you're in, and also you just need to be a really good creator. That's another thing that's really exciting about this space, is that YouTube and Netflix, well, Netflix particularly, has changed the game. YouTube has also changed the game. What you're seeing now is this new kind of class of content consumer that is simply bypassing TV completely.
00:27:11.010 - 00:27:38.762, Speaker B: It just doesn't. Doesn't spend any time there and also never had a Facebook account, so it doesn't have that social media grooming that we had, but just consumes everything in a very different way. What has happened is that everyone's copied Mr. B. So they're going, okay, here's a suitcase for the cash, and I'm just going to shout at you for the next ten minutes so you don't click away. And that's going to be how guys subscribe.
00:27:38.826 - 00:27:40.830, Speaker A: We're going to throw a million dollars.
00:27:40.900 - 00:28:19.370, Speaker B: Into the ocean and watch sharks eat it, and then we're going to cut off the sharks and turn them into money stakes. Amazing. So that just gets exhausting after a while. I used to go ADHD or over supremacy or whatever the word is, that's going to be really hard to watch. There is a new trend coming where people are looking for more human connections with people who aren't just copying everybody else. It's funny how many similarities there are between YouTube and everything in crypto. Everyone just forks the greatest idea or the latest idea and does subpar copies of it until the idea is exhausted.
00:28:19.370 - 00:28:40.910, Speaker B: But there's this move towards more kind of empathy with creators and also better storytelling. And this is like it's. It's time. So I'm very excited about that. So that's kind of the overview where we're at with, at least on YouTube. I can't speak to onlyfans and Instagram. I mentioned onlyfans because of all the platforms.
00:28:40.910 - 00:29:04.140, Speaker B: It's probably the one with the fairest relationship with its creators and also the one where there's just a staggering amount of money being made by the top creators. It blows my mind. Absolutely blows my mind. There's one in particular called amaranth, who is not far off what Mr. Beast is doing. And this is an OnlyFans creator. How?
00:29:04.830 - 00:29:52.780, Speaker A: It's insane, at least in the world that I grew up in, that's how we thought about artists. There was this meme of the starving artists you fast forward to today. For someone who has a YouTube channel, they could be making massive amounts of money if they've got hundreds of thousands or millions of subscribers. Someone like Mr. Beast has figured out seemingly how to monetize literally everything about what he does. And so, yeah, it feels like you have these same cycles of behavior, but you've got new and shiny toys. The new and shiny toy over the last ten years was YouTube and Instagram and every other sort of social media platform.
00:29:52.780 - 00:30:05.840, Speaker A: Now we have started to incorporate some of this web three tooling, which, in the case of NFTs, that was really what all of our attention was on in 2021.
00:30:06.770 - 00:30:19.540, Speaker B: YouTube is an interesting one because they're sort of slowly becoming super powerful again, and they haven't done it overnight. And they've traditionally not been the best communicators with their creator community, but.
00:30:21.430 - 00:30:21.746, Speaker A: You.
00:30:21.768 - 00:31:04.738, Speaker B: Can see that they're slowly trying to pull creators away from TikTok and from twitch in a very kind of slow way. And they're doing it through monetization, through Adsense. So if you think about being a creator, what your job is is to really to get the most clicks on a video you possibly can, because clicks mean, you know, you're fighting for attention. So make the most attention grabbing new content you can. And this is literally, there's a playbook for how you do it. It's about great thumbnail. That gives you the click through rate as long as you have a good thumbnail title and concept, which is not easy, by the way.
00:31:04.738 - 00:31:48.110, Speaker B: And then you basically have to employ extravagantly tailored retention tactics. So you look at your retention graph, you're like, okay, people drop off in the first 20 seconds because they always do. How do you keep them there? There's a famous Logan Paul video where he's talking about how he bought the most expensive Pokemon card in the world. He also has probably one of the most talented editors on YouTube in the world. So that combination, big story, big personality, great story, and then a great editor, and they held a retention rate of like 75% or something. 75% of people who watched that video stayed on till the end. That is insane.
00:31:48.110 - 00:32:20.840, Speaker B: That's insane. That's really insane because people arrive in your video with no context and they're looking for an excuse to leave. So you've got to keep them there. But to be honest with you, figuring out how to give people the sniff of an idea or the sniff of something that's coming and then hold them there, that's just storytelling. And it's just that now everything's compressed. You have to be sneakier with it and you have to kind of harness it. But you can plot the story that you want to tell.
00:32:20.840 - 00:32:54.894, Speaker B: None of that has to do anything with what we did at the defiant. We never thought that way because we were doing educational content. We were doing all these other kinds of things. But I love that stuff. I love the challenge of keeping people hooked on something that you've come up with for this period of time. Now you're asking me, like, where does Web three fit into all of this? Why? Web three has done a really crappy job of understanding the creator economy because we basically said NFTs were the answer. But if NFTs weren't the answer, then it's like a new decentralized version of YouTube.
00:32:54.894 - 00:33:17.980, Speaker B: That's the answer. Or a decentralized version of Instagram. It's not the answer. People are not leaving those platforms because those platforms are. On the whole, they're the best thing that creators have. So in order to make something that's better than be, just needs to be way better. And it just isn't all the things that YouTube has.
00:33:17.980 - 00:33:38.210, Speaker B: You can't fight on that hill. TikTok has done something different and amazing. But YouTube didn't die because of TikTok. There are more creators than there ever have ever been. Kids want to be creators. So it succeeded in grooming a whole new generation. The issue is that NFTs are amazing for building communities.
00:33:38.210 - 00:34:19.114, Speaker B: They're amazing at harnessing very simple visuals and hooking people into a kind of sense of belonging to a community in a way that shitcoins simply cannot. Because shitcoins cluster around trading activity, whereas nfts cluster around, notionally, the idea that you jam or jive with a particular piece of art and the community around that. And that's fairly fleeting most of the time. In the case of Bordeaux Yacht Club, what you're buying into is perceived success. And there's no doubt that Yuga has been extremely successful. So you're buying a piece of the Yuga success story. But other projects have a different vibe, and that's fantastic.
00:34:19.114 - 00:35:01.260, Speaker B: Like Paji penguins, all about good vibes, and it's geared towards kids. They're one of the few projects that does that. Clonex is a different thing. It's about street wear, it's about fashion, and it's about this emerging avatar driven, future driven, content creation kind of landscape, and they're brilliant at it. But the issue for me is as soon as you get into this thing, which we were talking about, of incentives, how do you incentivize people? The first answer is a token. And I think most projects, like 99% projects, the moment you add a token, you are fucked. It's game over.
00:35:01.260 - 00:35:48.890, Speaker B: It may not happen straight away, but the moment you add a token, you're fucked. So when we looked at bankless launching a token, you know, the defiant looked at making a token because you were part of that conversation. We never did. And there's a really simple reason why it's a bad idea. And that's because if you have a token, notionally, visibly, or invisibly your performance, your success will track in that token whether you like it or not, and you have no control over that. And therefore at some point the temptation will be to force value into that token because that's how people see you and that's just not the right way. That is not where your attention should be.
00:35:48.890 - 00:36:43.118, Speaker B: So what we're talking about here is the imbalance of the creator economy, because as you rightly said, what Mr. Beast has become really good at is monetizing and what creators are expected to do and groomed to do, I would say, because all of them consume the same kind of tutorial content about how to grow on YouTube and how to be a successful creator. Like you have your primary monetization stream, your secondary and your tertiary. So you've got a balance of these things, but all of them revolve around doing one thing and that's extracting maximum value from your audience. So you have this thing, build an audience, monetize that audience. But where is this going wrong? The audience gets fucked. That's basically what's happening here.
00:36:43.118 - 00:37:18.994, Speaker B: Web three should, could, might, maybe make it possible for the audience not to get fucked. That's it. And I don't think anybody has even thought about it that way because all they see is, oh, creators get a bad deal on YouTube, creators get a bad deal on Instagram, creators are doing just fine. If you're a talented creator and you put the time in, you're going to be fine because brands are falling over themselves to be part of your story. So tell a good story, do the time, do the work, it will happen for you. The people are getting screwed here. Okay, guys, like and subscribe.
00:37:18.994 - 00:37:49.118, Speaker B: Oh yeah, here's my merch. Oh yeah, here's my NFT drop. Audiences get fucked. So if we're going to come up with a better way for the creator economy, we have to do what I call the third pillar because we need to give it a fancy name. Because if we are going to write a white paper about this, it needs to have like the third pillar, my vision, the creator economy. So yeah, build an audience, monetize that audience. Third pillar, share the spoils is like, oh, share the spoils.
00:37:49.118 - 00:38:39.234, Speaker B: But why would I do that with these monkeys that watch my content? Well, have a think about it. Why would you want to share this hard earned cash? You've got your mansion, you're doing this walk around video of your big house because people fall away. And the way the world is going, we want a greater sense of connection with the creators and it's not top down. You need that audience as much as they need you. Why do they really need you? I don't know. And I think we just need to be a lot more kind of precious about that relationship and not just seek to extract value from it. So for me, then the question is, okay, so how are you going to share the spoils? What are the spoils? And the web?
00:38:39.272 - 00:38:39.474, Speaker A: Three.
00:38:39.512 - 00:39:20.606, Speaker B: Answer is, bro, add a token. Like, when's your token coming out? No token, bro. There is no token. So the trick, and it comes back to DFI, the trick is to take the things that worked from 2020, from yield farming, and apply them to YouTube. And I wish I could say more than that, but if you think about YouTube as a yield farm, then stuff gets really interesting. And that is as far as I'm willing to go in that particular conversation. But all my thinking right now is attempting to bring a.
00:39:20.606 - 00:40:06.462, Speaker B: I guess it's real yield, right? Where does the real yield come from if you're a creator? And then where does that go? And how can you use it to your advantage to incentivize the community to do the thing that you need them to do, which is YouTube wants to see that people watch your video. They want to see that they're retained by your video, because then it will go, oh, lots of people are watching this and they're watching through to the end. Damn, this must be a good video. Let's serve it up to more people. That's the only thing I need my community to do, is watch a video. And it's a really low lift because they can press play and walk away if they want to just let it go to the end, maybe like. But that one thing, our retention, I want to be at like 90% retention in the first 4 hours of a video.
00:40:06.462 - 00:40:36.774, Speaker B: And if I can do that, I can go viral. And if I can go viral, then I can scale fast. And if I can scale fast, I can build pillar three. And building pillar three is the only thing that matters. So that's it. Honestly, that's the reason why I want to do based Af, because the kinds of stories that I want to tell and the way I want to tell them are geared to meet the demands of what people expect from top creators. Because I think we can make a video every bit as good as a Mr.
00:40:36.774 - 00:40:52.960, Speaker B: Beast or a Logan Paul. That bit I don't have any struggle with. Maybe two years ago, before I started putting my face on camera, I might have struggled with that, but now I'm like, I'm fine. I can do this. We need to make great videos. We need to make ideas. You just have to watch.
00:40:52.960 - 00:41:32.970, Speaker B: That's kind of baked into the name based af. You kind of know what sort of videos you might be watching. But we have to figure this thing out and scale it up really fast. So we have to be pitching, we have to be kind of aiming for the very top echelons of this business and then use all the tactics that we can to keep people viewing and to bust through the algorithm. But again, all of this is fairly scientific and fairly straightforward to do and you just got to keep doing it video after video. But the recipe is not a secret. It's just very hard to maintain over a long period of time.
00:41:32.970 - 00:41:47.070, Speaker B: But again, what did we do the last two years? Six videos a week again and again and again? We can do kind of, that's kind of where I'm coming from. But yes, YouTube is a yield farm and then go from there.
00:41:47.220 - 00:42:44.354, Speaker A: So one thing I think that you've properly highlighted is the journey is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be hard. Life is not supposed to be one milestone after another without any sort of effort, time and essentially practice. I think at the end of the day, that craft of creating six videos in a week or one video, whatever it is, whether it's you creating an editorialized video or it being more of an interview, it's all practice. And you have truthfully been practicing this now for, let's say, 20 years and more specifically, being in front of the camera nonstop for the last several years since you've been in crypto. And it's funny, there was an interview that you did, right sometime near the end of your tenure here at the defiant. It was a more recent video.
00:42:44.354 - 00:43:39.410, Speaker A: I remember you were interviewing someone who owned a board ape. They work in LA. They had like the board ape over their face. His suggestion was that he was doing the typical crypto thing, looking at all of the upside on the opportunity to use NFTs and tokens, but not talking about any of the drawbacks. He said something to the effect of NFTs as profile pictures democratize your ability to be yourself, get in front of the camera, tell a story, not have to worry about the insecurities of your looks. It was a kind of a nice story he was telling, but here's where I disagree. It was capped off with, because anybody can do this, anyone can get in front of a camera and be just as talented.
00:43:39.410 - 00:44:54.426, Speaker A: The suggestion was that essentially it was looks that was driving the success of a lot of folks, and I totally disagree with that. And I think that YouTube truthfully did more already to democratize the ability to make content share it than what web three has already done or even like. As impressive as TikTok is, I am absolutely blown away by what TikTok has enabled. But YouTube seems to still be where great storytelling lives, and that's going to be the challenge for web three is the end product. Let's say right now there's a lookalike product to YouTube called Lens Tube. It uses some new web three building blocks, like lens Protocol, which basically means I own my followers and I can port those followers with me if I go anywhere that uses the lens protocol. That said, lens tube, although it looks a lot like YouTube, it's going to take a very long time to create deep content liquidity so that folks can get on there and say, everything I need is here.
00:44:54.426 - 00:45:46.810, Speaker A: Great storytelling lives on lens to and it looks, again, exactly like YouTube. But the truth is, there's going to have to be that much hard work, there's going to have to be incentives that drive creators over. It can't just be, here's this thing and BTWs, it might have a token. We don't know this yet, but my assumption is lens tube will eventually have a token. I decided to start making videos on there because I don't have a distaste in my mouth for YouTube, but I have felt that there is a better way forward and I'm pretty often an early adopter of whatever web three d five applications are out there. So it was kind of a part of like dog fooding what's available and I've sort of fallen in love with using it. But that said, I still have more subscribers on YouTube.
00:45:46.810 - 00:47:08.040, Speaker A: I get more views, I get more exposure. And so anyways, just kind of like summing up that this all comes back to great storytelling, lots and lots of hard work, lots of practice. I am grateful for what content has done for my career over the last few years, but to be completely transparent, I think I've also lived through the ups and downs as a creator. Like anyone, I saw my YouTube surging to like, I think I had like two or 300,000 views back in 2020 and I decided that, I remember at the time I distinctly was fearful of YouTube banning me for doing crypto content at some point and being locked out and that being my one source of income and given I had a family, having the opportunity to go work at Zapper was just like an obvious layup for me. I was like I can do both. But there's like a hedge here against if something goes wrong and YouTube kicks me out with lens tube, I'd like to think if lens tube existed back then, I'm not sure that I would have followed that path. There might have been an opportunity to say, this is more censorship resistant or less likely to kick me out.
00:47:08.890 - 00:47:44.334, Speaker B: But anyways, yeah, it's the algorithm that's the problem, but it's also the algorithm that is the game. And you talk to any kind of YouTuber that's had a period of a career that longer than a year or two, and it does kind of even out. Like, you have these ups and downs, but also you have to pick a niche in which there's a relative amount of stability. So, Linus, tech tips, like tech is always changing. There's always a story. MkBhd, the same thing. There's always a story.
00:47:44.334 - 00:48:28.366, Speaker B: He's been going creator of the decade, and he doesn't need to be interesting. The tech needs to be interesting, and there's always a new phone, there's always a new thing. So for him, that's relatively stable. If you're like a personality youtuber, and your personality is to be big and brash and loud, at some point you burn out because it's inevitable. I mean, I definitely burn out on defi content. There came a point where I could not physically talk about another hack or another Dex with the same enthusiasm again, because I'd just seen it over and over, and I can't fork my enthusiasm and just port it onto avalanche, unfortunately, I wish I could, because then it would be straightforward. So when you reach those points, you have to do one of two things.
00:48:28.366 - 00:49:35.890, Speaker B: You either have to hire new people and keep the team fresh, and then bounce off their ideas and bounce off their energy, or you have to wave the white flag and say, enough is enough. Time to do something different. The solution I came to was whatever I do next has to be non crypto in the sense that it has to have enough breadth in the subject matter that it can be about things that crypto isn't about, and obviously not abandoning that space, because this is where I come from, this is where my audience is at. When I went to nsTnyc, I was staggered about how many people knew my face and came up and said hello. I was like, oh, damn, maybe I'm not so stupid. Maybe there is an audience there that wants to come and see me do something crazy next. But for me, going through this cycle, seeing all of that hard work evaporate and then having to be in a position where you're having to defend and apologize for the space that you're in, fighting all of this kind of regulatory negativity, even though the thing that you fell in love with, the stuff that you love, hasn't changed, doesn't change.
00:49:35.890 - 00:50:23.378, Speaker B: It remains the same. It's just not a battle I want to fight. So for me, the most logical next step was to look for something which was a long tail, as the future had enough kind of breadth in it to keep things interesting, so we could pivot to things that may be crypto, maybe non crypto, but also was a big enough story that it would really capture a large audience. So I could build this pillar three thing, because my pillar three doesn't work at a small scale, it works at a large scale. So that, for me, was the metaverse and this idea of the future of the Internet, all of that stuff. And the great thing is, I don't have to be right about the metaverse. All we have to do is write about the metaverse because the content speaks for itself.
00:50:23.378 - 00:50:41.914, Speaker B: And of course, we have a built in pantomime supervillain, which is Mark Zuckerberg. So there's always something to talk about. Actually, right now, it's metaconnect. So there's a big kind of meta conference going on. I'm doing this instead. That's how much I'm dedicated to the cause. But, yeah, all sorts of interesting things.
00:50:41.914 - 00:50:51.680, Speaker B: So when we talk about base AF, which is my new venture, we will be the morons of the metaverse, trying desperately to make sense of it and see where it goes.
00:50:52.610 - 00:51:58.242, Speaker A: Creators are still thinking in the context of web two. And so everything that you've done, anyone else that's been a creator exploring how to use these new tools, they're thinking about, how can I do what I was doing in web two the same, if not better? But the truth is, yeah, we're setting up for a new future where I think it's very likely that someone who is a web three creator in the future will more likely identify with actually teaching that content in, let's say, like, a metaverse platform. There will be universities that I think are native to the metaverse. There will be creators who, they could be an AI, they could be a human being. But regardless, content creation will originate there. And I think, to me, that's the lasting legacy of Defi NFTs. All this stuff, it's setting us up for.
00:51:58.242 - 00:52:05.650, Speaker A: We need that finance aspect handled. We need basically the idea of how do we exchange value that is scarce?
00:52:05.990 - 00:52:34.570, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Well, the metaverse has this wasteland quality to it. There's no rules in any of it yet, and it could be pretty much anything you want. People, when I talk about the metaverse, they say, well, can you define it for us? I'm like, no, I cannot. And that feels like I should know. But the more I investigate it, the less obvious it becomes, what it is. It could be through VR, it could be through ar, it could be through, like, I spend a lot of time in swift.
00:52:34.570 - 00:53:15.370, Speaker B: But what I think is really important is that the perception we have of the metaverse is dehumanizing. And it's mainly dehumanizing because of Facebook and Zuck. But that's not the vision he has for it. He may be very clumsy in expressing it, but there's a lot of things where I listen to what he has to say. I'm like, that actually resonates with me much more than some of the web. Three metaverse conversations I've seen, but that's the kind of broad vision of it. But nonetheless, I just think there's this wave of creativity coming that's going to be connected to this space, and it's just really underserved for content.
00:53:15.370 - 00:54:13.470, Speaker B: It's either guys, VCs going, this is this $20 trillion opportunity, and it's going to be the most amazing thing in the world, and it's going to be the future of the Internet. Or it's like, hey, buy this land. It's going to be 1000 x by March. You're like, what's in the middle? Where's the fun stuff? So what we're trying to do is set up a style of content that is willing to poke fun at it, but also willing to explore the very extremes of what it is. Because I think ultimately the issue I have is whenever I'm connected to that space through VR, for whatever reason or any other things, the thing that my brain is telling me is this is disconnecting me from my humanity. But what I keep discovering more and more is like it's actually reinforcing connections to my humanity that I had abandoned. And that's bizarre and weird, but that's the message I want to carry through.
00:54:13.470 - 00:54:19.360, Speaker B: What we're doing is that actually quite the opposite can be possible if you got an open mind.
00:54:19.730 - 00:54:24.690, Speaker A: Why do you think the creator economy attracts so many grifters?
00:54:25.350 - 00:55:07.022, Speaker B: Oh, the notorious influencers. Well, you see them, the crypto bros and the fboys and all these kind of things. There's a certain type of human that is just an extraction maximalist that just likes to kind of rape and pillage and then move on and they'll just go where the marks are cheap and the marks are easy and that seems to be expressing itself on social media and through influencers and these kind of things. But you can spot them a mile and like, if people get burned, they get burned. You learn and move on. I don't honestly know. I don't think it's necessarily reflecting anything that wasn't there before.
00:55:07.022 - 00:55:10.298, Speaker B: It's just now it's more visible. That's it. There's always been grifters.
00:55:10.394 - 00:55:41.420, Speaker A: One thing before we go, Robin, do you have any optimism about these new web three media platforms? Like I mentioned, lens tube earlier, basically, again, recreating a likeness to web two social media or any sort of platform that allows creators to thrive on it. Something like only fans recreated but with crypto payments. Is that an optimistic future or are we just in the early days of these together?
00:55:42.030 - 00:56:30.134, Speaker B: For me, where this goes is YouTube moves in that direction because we know that Susan Richichki, I hope I'm pronouncing correctly, but she's into NFTs and she's into trying to figure out how to build that into what YouTube is doing. A transparent social graph definitely would be interesting. But is YouTube going to go there? Maybe there's a YouTube decentralized flavor. I just feel that everything that lens, for instance, is doing, it ends up being ported over to a bigger platform in some way. And whether that's enough, I don't know. But the scale, the network effects, I don't see them playing out. I've seen this scenario happen so many times that it's just hard to get the volume of the users.
00:56:30.134 - 00:56:32.780, Speaker B: Like you said, the content liquidity is not there.
00:56:33.790 - 00:57:09.222, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we'll see if the ave community, Stani in particular, can kind of translate that momentum of early adopters over. It definitely feels like one of the best shots we have. But yeah, there's high risk, high reward there. You're building in the face of some behemoth incumbents that you've got to overcome before you go. Then just reminder to everyone they can follow you and your new team at based af here on Twitter. They can learn more here at based. Yeah, Rob page.
00:57:09.222 - 00:57:29.460, Speaker A: But still, hopefully by the time they. Yeah, hopefully by the time you listen to this or watch this in the future, it's out with the becoming product. But hey, thanks so much for your time. I appreciate we went way over. No surprise there. And just really excited for what's next.
