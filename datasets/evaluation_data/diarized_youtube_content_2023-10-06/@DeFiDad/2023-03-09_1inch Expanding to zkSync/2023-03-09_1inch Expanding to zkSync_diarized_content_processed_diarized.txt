00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.810, Speaker C: Hey everyone, this is Defi dad. I'm here at East Denver joined by Sasha who is the partnerships lead at one inch. Sasha, just in case folks are new to one inch. What is one inch?
00:00:10.890 - 00:00:21.982, Speaker A: One inch is a DeFi aggregation protocol so we are like now one of the biggest one. We were developed at East New York and I'm happy to be here and share with the community.
00:00:22.116 - 00:00:31.238, Speaker C: I'm also joined here by Nick who is the backend lead at one inch. Nick, how is one inch thinking to leverage ZK rollup in its future products?
00:00:31.404 - 00:00:58.730, Speaker B: I first want to say that I think that Zksync brings a lot of new possibilities to the Defi protocols. Basically, cheap transactions and high speed means that we can do some things that is not impossible to do on Ethereum, some account abstraction wallets, something that is not very can be quite expensive on Ethereum for example. And that means basically that we will have much more protocols that possible to implement on CK sync and provide the cheapest possible transactions for the CK sync as well as on Ethereum.
