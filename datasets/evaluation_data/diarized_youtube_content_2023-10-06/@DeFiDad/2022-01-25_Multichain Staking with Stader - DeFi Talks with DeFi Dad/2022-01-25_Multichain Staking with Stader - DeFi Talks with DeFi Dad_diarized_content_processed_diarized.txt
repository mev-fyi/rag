00:00:03.830 - 00:00:52.918, Speaker A: Hey everyone, this is defi talks with defi dad. Hey, everyone. So thanks for tuning in. Couldn't be a better day to talk about the fundamentals of web3. I'm joined here by Amit, who is the founder of Stator Labs. We are going to talk all about the staking landscape in DFI, web3, crypto, whatever you want to call it. This is a topic that I've actually covered a lot previously when I was at Zapper on Zapper TV, we did quite a few episodes on staking.
00:00:52.918 - 00:01:34.406, Speaker A: We talked with other liquid staking protocols. So this is a topic that I'm hoping is going to be interesting for both beginners and more advanced users of DeFi. And so a little background on stator. They only recently launched in end of November, they accumulated about 500 million in value, which was all Luna that was staked. Over the past 60 days or so. That value has dropped just a little bit here over the past few days as the whole crypto markets have crashed. But the same, I guess, Luna is still staked there.
00:01:34.406 - 00:01:54.880, Speaker A: And so we're going to talk about, again, what are some of the challenges to staking, decentralized staking. Talk about what great work has already been done by other protocols, but then also talk about what's new and innovative about Stator. So on that note, Amit, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:55.650 - 00:02:07.860, Speaker B: I'm doing great, DEFA, dad, thanks for having me here. Been looking forward to chatting with you on this show. And thanks a lot to all your viewers who have tuned in.
00:02:09.590 - 00:02:59.002, Speaker A: And we will do some screen sharing possibly today. I just remembered I didn't get to prep you with that, Amit, but yeah, if you'd like to share screens at some point, we could actually talk through what's available already with Lunax, which is their liquid staking derivative that I've been using. But let's start at the beginning, like we do with all guests. Let's talk about your background, how you got started building stator, I guess what actually prompted it. And then one last thing before we do get started, just want to disclose. So I actually got to know Stator using the product, learning about it as like a new liquid staking option. But since then, my team at Fourth Revolution Capital has invested in stator.
00:02:59.002 - 00:03:07.490, Speaker A: So just want to share that in case I have any sort of bias, of course, in talking about Stator. So, Amit. Yeah. Could you tell us more about your background?
00:03:08.250 - 00:04:10.958, Speaker B: Absolutely. Defatite. So I am actually from India, was born and brought up here, went to the top Univs IITA and in got bored of academics, yet continued my ten years of professional journey with strategy consulting firm called Atikani and then worked with a tech startup in India called Swiggy before I jumped neck deep into crypto. I think it was back in 2019 when I got inspired by one of my co founders, Sid, to join this crypto revolution. And I've started closely following the DFI summer and I think towards the end of 2020 is when I completely decided that I would want to spend the next two decades of my life building in crypto. To begin with, we had about 20 ideas that we wanted to build, and obviously we couldn't build 20 of them at the same time. And we wanted to build something that is long lasting and that is more sustainable.
00:04:10.958 - 00:05:15.070, Speaker B: Hence we chose the area of staking. That is how the journey of Stada started for us. Of course, the entire craze around Defi is obviously pretty massive, and the opportunities and applications that could be built on top of crypto are massive. But I think one of the fundamental infrastructure that is enabling crypto and the kind of growth we are seeing today is staking. And without pos, without staking, I don't think we would have seen what we have been seeing over the last two to three years. So that's why we chose this particular area, which is staking. And at the heart of what we are trying to do, in a nutshell, we are trying to simplify the entire process of staking and obviously add a lot more derivatives and structured products on top of staked assets, while at the same time trying to cater to several segments in the staking ecosystem.
00:05:15.810 - 00:06:19.086, Speaker A: Yeah, I know one of the milestones over the last few years is this transition for Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. So most that are in the space, I think, would recall that at some point you could start to stake ETH and earn rewards denominated in ETH. But what's, I think, changed, of course, in 2021 was that many other proof of stake networks really started to grow. We saw similar DFI applications launch and start to actually flourish. And then with that economic activity meant that there's that many more players that would hold a token that they could actually stake to support those networks. The challenge, and I want you to kind of tell more of this story. I'm a little ignorant to how this is all developed, but I want to say in past years, centralized staking was very popular.
00:06:19.086 - 00:06:52.700, Speaker A: This is where you would have to, of course, sign up in KYC and you're trusting someone else to custody those assets. And with the launch of other protocols like Lido and Rocket pool and now stator, we can look to what we'll call decentralized staking instead. So anyways, if you could tell us a bit more, just about, I guess, what has changed over the last year, and I guess, where does that create the sort of opportunity to grow this pie?
00:06:53.170 - 00:08:18.722, Speaker B: Yes, I think you started on the right note. Earlier it was only ethereum. Now there are several other POS networks that have launched staking and some of them have really matured proof of stake ecosystems like for that matter Terra, where we have already built our solution, the ecosystem is massively matured compared to any other proof of stake network and a lot of other proof of stake networks including Solana Phantom, all of these are upping their game. And of course, not to mention the transition of ETH to complete proof of stake based consensus mechanism. Obviously you are right that originally it was the exchanges that were primarily enabling staking, and with the launch of decentralized staking with Lido and several other protocols like Staffi and Rocket pool that did launch recently, decentralized liquid staking has become quite popular of late with billions of dollars of TVL. I think kudos to some of these players who have really clearly made a significant difference to the entire defi ecosystem for this. Having said that, I do see that there are several customer segments as well as key gaps in the market that are yet to be solved.
00:08:18.722 - 00:08:55.700, Speaker B: And as Tayder we would definitely love to. We've started solving those problems by building first on terra ecosystem, the two different types of staking solutions that we have already built. But obviously the white spaces are quite evident across several proof of stake ecosystems. Even when it comes to centralized staking, staking is very immature. It's plain vanilla. Today. There is a huge scope for players who can innovate and build these value added products on top of staking across the board.
00:08:56.470 - 00:09:32.030, Speaker A: Amit, can you break down, how do you think about the different types of customers, let's call them, or users that would want to stake? Because I know I probably group them very generally as like retail, which is basically everyone that is not an institution. But I know institutional staking. I don't know if you have any numbers to share, but that's a huge bucket. That's kind of like a black box I think about and wonder how much interest is there right now to stake as a crypto institutional investor.
00:09:32.610 - 00:10:25.146, Speaker B: Got you. So we've done pretty deep analysis on this one. There are several segments of users, of course, the retail segment of crypto users, which are specifically kind of the degen crowd. They access several DeFi protocols, use their decentralized wallets to access dapps and other protocols. And these are the guys who are generally a lot less risk averse. They prefer solutions like liquid staking and probably collateralize their liquid staking token, take out loans and do a bunch of things on top. But the most interesting segments to me, and quite underserved segments today are obviously the institutional segment which either hold self custody, their assets, or hold their assets with custodians.
00:10:25.146 - 00:11:42.062, Speaker B: And not to mention the entrant, the coming institutions that are getting into crypto by owning some of these blue chip Pos assets, like the corporate treasuries, the pension funds, et cetera, some of them are already owning significant amount of proof of stake assets. And the key needs and aspirations of these segments are one, they treat crypto as an alternative investment class and they actually would love to actually stake their assets and at the same time earn some productive passive income on top of their assets. But at the same time, they are in this for the really long term. They don't care about liquidity, they don't really care about further collateralizing these assets and generating additional yields because they literally don't have the mandate to do this right. So they are looking for very efficient, highly risk mitigated staking solutions and potentially tax optimized staking solutions in the future. Who knows how the regulation around staking rewards taxation evolves. So somebody needs to build really intelligent, automated, smart contracts that do a bunch of these things that cater to this segment.
00:11:42.062 - 00:12:34.714, Speaker B: And that is really a very interesting segment to us. The third segment is probably where the next 500 million users, or probably a billion users are entering crypto, which is a tier two, tier three, and the top exchanges across the globe. And if you look at this, beyond the general exchanges, there are these fintech applications like the robin Hoods of the world revoluts. If you take Asia, these are the grabs, Gojex of the world, which will start offering crypto trading. And then obviously it's very cumbersome for their users to transfer their crypto assets into, let's say, a metamask or any other wallet, and then get them to discover these staking opportunities and stake. It's just way too inconvenient for their users. They would want their users to get access to those solutions right inside their app.
00:12:34.714 - 00:13:04.580, Speaker B: So there's a huge opportunity for an API kind of a play, where players like us can provide instant connectivity to staking solutions offer really convenient and high quality staking solutions. Examples would be, hey, here is general staking. We have selected the top class validators for you stake. With that you get 10% yield. And then here is liquid staking. Your tokens are not locked, but we're going to have a charge. So it's 9% yield, right? And then they can build whole ecosystems around it.
00:13:06.870 - 00:14:32.990, Speaker A: Do you recall any details from some of the research you had done? What is stopping some of these? Let's going back to the segment of institutional investors. What's preventing them from getting into the space? Because I bring it back to my own experience and I think about when I hold ether or Luna or any other asset that has proof of stake, I do everything possible to let that token passively earn yield. The one reason, and this comes back to my question of what's preventing these larger investors of getting into staking. The one thing that kept me from dumping it all into Lido's stuff in the past with ether was just knowing that it is still a newer protocol. We're like a year, two years in maybe if you count how long some of these teams have been developing. I would always have this fear of just what if, what if one of these smart contracts fails me. So I feel like it's very important that you plant those roots now because it's important to show how battle tested these smart contracts are over time.
00:14:32.990 - 00:14:40.260, Speaker A: But anyways, do you recall, was there any specific feedback that institutional investors gave?
00:14:40.710 - 00:15:24.990, Speaker B: Yes. So there are several barriers to their staking journey. One, the regulation around staking, staking rewards, especially the taxation around it, is not very clear. The other is some of these institutions hold their assets in custodies, custody players, right? And a lot of them don't even support networks like Terra, which is probably second largest protocol in terms of TVL. Right? So some of them don't even have offer staking solutions for Terra. Similarly, Solana, so they're far away from the journey and these guys don't have access to these high quality staking solutions. So there are several barriers to it.
00:15:24.990 - 00:15:46.310, Speaker B: And then some of them don't even know what staking means. What does it mean? What are the risks involved in staking? Like what are the slashing risks are the validators that I am selecting, being benchmarked for the best quality and also for the best risk, et cetera. Right? So all of these are barriers in their journey that needs to be solved.
00:15:48.730 - 00:16:24.654, Speaker A: I wanted to re highlight some of the use cases of being able to have a liquid staking derivative, just in case folks are newer to staking and wondering again, what's the upside versus if they're on a centralized exchange like coinbase or binance in the future. But I was thinking, and I don't want to put you on the spot with this, would you be comfortable sharing the stator app as we talk through it? The only thing is I want to make sure your wallet isn't logged in or you don't have. I just want to be mindful.
00:16:24.702 - 00:16:27.230, Speaker B: Don't worry, I use a dummy wallet.
00:16:27.310 - 00:16:51.180, Speaker A: You got a good. Okay, great. Yeah. Once you bring that up here, I can share your screen. I have written a tutorial on stator before, and I've definitely tweeted about it, but there's just simple ways that I've used it to earn yield, and I think it brings it to life more versus talking about it.
00:16:51.550 - 00:16:57.726, Speaker B: Awesome. Absolutely. So let me just share my screen. Yeah.
00:16:57.748 - 00:17:03.040, Speaker A: And you can choose to share a window or a tab, and then I'll bring it up here on the screen for us.
00:17:03.490 - 00:17:11.368, Speaker B: Got you. Yeah. Can you see this?
00:17:11.534 - 00:17:13.416, Speaker A: There we go. All right, I'm adding it.
00:17:13.438 - 00:17:13.624, Speaker B: Cool.
00:17:13.662 - 00:17:14.810, Speaker A: You're good to go.
00:17:15.340 - 00:17:15.848, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:17:15.934 - 00:17:22.510, Speaker A: Yeah. Talk us through what we're looking at here. And what exactly is Lunax and the staking pools and so on?
00:17:22.960 - 00:18:00.272, Speaker B: Yeah. So essentially we have two products that are live on Terra today. One is the liquid staking solution on terra. Then the other one is the stake pools on terra. Let me explain what they mean. So, liquid staking is something that a lot of people are familiar with, but obviously we have taken liquid staking to another level. So when you stake your Luna with us on this pool, all you need to do is just enter the amount of Luna that you want to stake and just press stake here, and you will get an equivalent amount of Lunax in your wallet.
00:18:00.272 - 00:18:34.352, Speaker B: The Luna X is a C token, type of a token that increases in the price every day as we take the staking rewards and then put it back on the validator. So they autocompound. Terra is a very unique ecosystem. We all know that stablecoins are kind of the spinal cord of the terra ecosystem. So a lot of rewards. In fact, like 40, 50% of the staking rewards that are generated by the terra blockchain are in stablecoins, USDkrt, and several other stablecoins. A lot of people stake their lunar to get Luna back.
00:18:34.352 - 00:19:23.250, Speaker B: So what our smart contracts do is they take all the stables, convert them to Luna, and restake it. Obviously, because a lot of projects that are built on terra, they give out airdrops. So if you stake with stator, all of your airdrops can be found. This is of course we had a farming event, so people who staked with us kind of farmed our got a chance to farm our SD tokens. These are all the airdrops that are received from several other protocols which can be just claimed in one transaction. Otherwise, you'll have to go to each protocol and claim those particular airdrops every week, which was quite inconvenient and cumbersome for a lot of people. So we just enabled this within the application.
00:19:23.250 - 00:19:55.528, Speaker B: So that's the first product we have on Terra. It has about roughly 1.4 million lunar staked and an lp pool of about 1.7 million luna. We also have another solution on Terra, which is called the stake pools. These are kind of like the really curated set of validators, and we have categorized these validators into several buckets. Right now we have about three validator buckets.
00:19:55.528 - 00:20:39.256, Speaker B: This is kind of the reason why we have this is twofold. One is to enable delegators to simply simplify their staking journey. One is they don't need to discover the validators, they don't need to actually manage their entire stake. They don't need to monitor the validators because stator smart contracts do that. Underneath, we've selected the best possible validators, depending on their performance, as well as slashing history, and categorized them into these three buckets. The three buckets that are available here are one, the blue chip validators, which are kind of like the really high performing validators, greater than 99.9% uptime, six months active in the network, and no slashing history over the last three months.
00:20:39.256 - 00:21:28.708, Speaker B: And we also have the community validators bucket. These are the guys who are actively creating content for the community and then obviously creating a lot of dashboards and a lot of useful things for the community, like keeping them informed about the news and the goings on across the terra ecosystem. Obviously. The third interesting validator piece is these are the validators that are run by the protocols themselves, and they are airdropping their tokens to stakers who are staking with these validators. This is quite an attractive thing for a lot of delegators in the terra ecosystem. And we have three validators today. As we speak, more and more validators are getting into this space, or more and more protocols are actually bootstrapping their network using validators by running validators.
00:21:28.708 - 00:21:55.890, Speaker B: So this is going to be a massively increasing bucket. We might end up having three airdrop validator buckets in the future. Or maybe four. Who knows? I do see a future where some of these validators are coming together and creating social tokens that can be leveraged to get exclusive access to deals content, early Alpha news, et cetera. So all of these are quite possible in the future?
00:21:56.580 - 00:22:44.912, Speaker A: Yeah. Previously when I learned about stator when we first met, I didn't realize because I was using Beluna, and this is a different use case. I was borrowing against Luna on anchor, so I was giving up the yield. I was giving up my validator rewards, staking Luna in order to be able to borrow against it. But let's just assume at some point I no longer needed to borrow against that. And that's when it was like, all right, at this point, the mechanism that I was using was I was borrowing UST to use the anchor rate. But in reality, what I was trying to do was just grow how much Luna I had.
00:22:44.912 - 00:23:45.220, Speaker A: So this was a more effective strategy to actually stake the Luna, in this case, staking through the pools or choosing the other options. You just showed where I hold Luna X and Luna and then pair them as an LP and earn the SD token LP rewards. I guess some background to this that might help. And again, I'm a little ignorant to this, but other than me using Beluna, I guess what other options I guess were really already prominent out there. I assume everyone's using the terra extension, the station wallet. Yeah. And at that point, I guess, how does that not promote as much decentralization as I guess, what we're doing here? Because that was one of the things that drew me in with stator.
00:23:45.220 - 00:23:57.610, Speaker A: The goal is to basically create a more diverse set of validators to ensure that money is being spread across more validators to prevent any sort of.
00:23:59.840 - 00:24:49.892, Speaker B: That'S one of our key goals. Obviously, one of the reasons why we have created these validator pools is also to promote decentralization. When you are staking to a pool here, you're essentially staking equally across all the validators that are underneath the pool. Now, obviously we have ten validators in each pool today. We can expand it to probably 30 validators in the future, and each pool will probably have 30, 40 validators and then covering about 100, 150 validators across the pools. We're very soon going to launch a pool called small validator Pool that has these young but good performing validators who are struggling to bootstrap their validators. So when you scroll down, you'll find that pool and then you can simply delegate to that pool.
00:24:49.892 - 00:25:13.330, Speaker B: Right. And then obviously even our liquid staking currently has about six to eight validators, and we plan to expand that to about 1012, maybe 20 validators pretty soon. It definitely does encourage decentralization and we are actively building this kind of a stake pool's infrastructure across several other blockchains, including Phantom Hedera, et cetera, in the.
00:25:15.300 - 00:25:26.900, Speaker A: Well, actually, maybe we can talk about that later. But yeah, I guess just since you mentioned it, what is the next proof of stake blockchain that will be supported for staking on stator?
00:25:27.500 - 00:25:52.110, Speaker B: Yeah, it will be Solana. And the launch is pretty not too far away. Within a few weeks, contracts are ready for built. We built the liquid staking option on Solana, obviously. We are also building the stake pools on Solana where you don't get the liquid staking token yet you still can stake with several validators that are.
00:25:54.000 - 00:25:55.564, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. Okay.
00:25:55.602 - 00:26:13.030, Speaker B: So this is to cater to several consumer segments because especially some of the large whales and potentially institutions consider the exchange of a liquid staking token as a taxable event. I'm not a tax advisor, but this is what some of my research has told us.
00:26:13.720 - 00:26:42.190, Speaker A: No, you're right. In the US for sure. I'm not a tax professional either. But basically, anytime you swap a token, which even if you became like an LP that is technically swapping tokens for another IOU token, that's an LP. So that is interesting. We have not talked about that before. I had not been thinking about the taxable event issue.
00:26:44.880 - 00:27:26.648, Speaker B: Of a lot of what we have built here on the terra ecosystem is actually backed by really deep research with the institutions. Right. And what we are, interestingly, what we are doing is we are stripping the smart contracts that are currently live on the public domain and then creating these private smart contract pools. So for example, if you are an institution or you are a custodian who is running your own validators on any of the proof of stake blockchain. So you don't want to move complete assets to this public stator pools. Right. You would want to create a smart contract on top of your validator that does a bunch of these automations.
00:27:26.648 - 00:27:58.760, Speaker B: And potentially, if you are a large exchange and you want to issue liquid staking tokens on top of proof of stake assets and create these economies or ecosystems based on synthetic staked assets using our smart contracts. It's like a white label solution. They can just plug these out and plug them in there. So that's the beauty of the modular architecture that we've built and we are already testing some of these. Actually, some of these will go live in a couple of weeks with some institutions.
00:27:59.180 - 00:28:12.670, Speaker A: Wow, that's cool. So that's going live with that, I assume, is like testing with just a few players that are institutions. This isn't something that will be openly available to anyone just yet.
00:28:13.280 - 00:28:57.050, Speaker B: Very cool. This will be only within the ecosystem. And the extension of it is now we can work with several custodians who hold few billions of dollars of assets, and then all those assets can be liquid staked. And then these liquid staking vaults, along with order books or amms, can be created within that. And then lending and borrowing products can be created within their ecosystems without actually connection to the external world. So these are some of the things that become easily possible as the value of crypto increases and a lot of players come into crypto, and these small economies within these custodial players or exchanges are quite possible.
00:28:57.660 - 00:30:28.244, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. One other benefit here that I'm hoping folks are familiar with, if you've done any liquid staking, is that ability to borrow against any of these staked assets, which is one of the really popular ways to avoid a taxable event. It's a strategy that, if you're not aware, just really wealthy folks have always done this, you find a great store of value and then you find ways to borrow against that, believing that your store value will go up over time and that you'll be able to pay that back. And so it just becomes more obvious, I think, when you talk about DeFi or web3, because assets, in this case, they're just so much more efficient. It's easy to move those assets and to do really powerful things. And so the Luna X token that is powered by stator, similar to a staff by Lido or a future staked version of ether on stator or a staked version of Soul. Anyone who's holding that we're building for an audience that wants to be long, they want to be a long term supporter of the network, but rightfully, they need to be able to access that liquidity.
00:30:28.244 - 00:30:41.130, Speaker A: So this is such an important building block to really growing web3 D five crypto as we know it.
00:30:41.500 - 00:31:20.868, Speaker B: Yes. So one of the interesting, obviously, we have talked about decentralization, stake pools and Lunax. Some of the general use cases of Lunax, like using it as collateral on anchor, on several other lending protocols that are coming up on Terra. He's definitely underway. Some interesting concepts that we've been working on when it comes to using Lunax is we're trying to build something like a saffron finance based tranches using Lunax. So all you need to do is, as a Lunax holder, go deposit this in the vault and select your risk category. High risk, medium risk, low risk.
00:31:20.868 - 00:31:38.990, Speaker B: And then the yields that are generated by either collateralizing Lunax or by leverage taking Lunax, et cetera, are going to be tranched across these buckets. So these are some of the interesting products we are thinking in trying to actively build, too.
00:31:40.240 - 00:32:10.840, Speaker A: Sorry, can you go back to. You called it like a leverage staking product. Maybe I just misheard or misunderstood how you said that. There's, of course, anyone like me wanting to take my staked version of one of these tokens. Let's say it's Luna X and be able to borrow against it. But is that what we're talking about? Or is there something else in relation to leverage?
00:32:11.420 - 00:32:33.496, Speaker B: It's different. So basically, think of it this way. You have a vault on a lending on a money market protocol. You have a Lunar Luna X vault. You take your lunar, let's say you have 100 luna. You stake that take, let's say 99.99 Luna X, and then you use that Luna X as collateral, take more Luna as loan.
00:32:33.496 - 00:32:39.840, Speaker B: And you keep repeating this process. The risk of liquidation will be very low because these are pegged assets.
00:32:40.980 - 00:33:10.756, Speaker A: Oh, man. Oh, that's beautiful. Wait, when does that come? When is that coming? This is great. Anyone would know this, obviously. I prep for these interviews, and I purposely asked Amit to not tell me any of these new ideas coming because I knew this would be my reaction. That is really cool. That reminds me of the degen box on abracadabra.
00:33:10.756 - 00:33:59.080, Speaker A: It's beautiful because you're using stablecoins against stablecoins, and there is still a risk. I want to call this out to anyone. I'm not advising or giving financial advice. Folks should use leverage, but it is relatively safer when you use assets that are the same. In this case, we're talking about, like, if I have staked Luna and I'm borrowing against it to have more Luna, they follow each other up and down in price because they're the same price versus, like, you get into really hot water when you do like, pretend it was like Luna and I borrow ust and the price of Luna is crashing. That's where people commonly get liquidated. That's why the crypto markets are really wild on drawdown.
00:33:59.080 - 00:34:05.470, Speaker A: Dude, that is so cool. Oh, my gosh. That's exciting. Sorry, when, again, is that coming?
00:34:06.320 - 00:34:40.984, Speaker B: So we're working with a lending market protocol to make this live. I think hopefully in a few weeks this should go live. It'll be very interesting to see not just from a market perspective, but also in terms of how the market prices, the lunar borrowing rates, as well as the staking yields. Right. You can keep doing this process until your cost of borrowing Luna is less than or equal to your staking rewards, plus airdrops. So essentially, with probably 100 luna, you can borrow up to five times, six times, because the LTVs can be really.
00:34:41.022 - 00:35:34.760, Speaker A: High in this case. Something else about stator that's very subtle is if you missed this earlier, when you hold like a Luna X or one of these future products, the idea is that you still qualify for terra Airdrops. And the way it works here is you're accumulating those airdrop rewards and then you can go into the stator app and you can claim it. And again, this isn't like a knock on Beluna. We love using Luna with anchor, but it's a different setup. You're not able to claim those airdrops. And so I would imagine as terra, as an ecosystem grows, or in the future, when you support ether and soul and phantom, there's going to be lots of potential airdrops there that people will want to be able to claim.
00:35:34.760 - 00:35:45.656, Speaker A: So with this future, like this product where you can wind up basically leveraged Luna staking, you would still qualify for the airdrops.
00:35:45.768 - 00:35:53.760, Speaker B: Same sort of way you will qualify for the multiplier airdrops because essentially you are leveraged taking and then you're getting more and more airdrops.
00:35:57.380 - 00:36:05.730, Speaker A: Am I misunderstanding then what's the other money Lego involved in that? Where are you borrowing from?
00:36:06.900 - 00:36:40.616, Speaker B: So you need to have a lending market. So something like an away or a compound on terra. We're working with anchor team to figure out ways to leverage Lunax. But anchor solves a different use case. It doesn't give out Luna as loan. Today, the other lending market protocols, or MM protocols are going to create these vaults for Luna, Lunax where people can deposit Lunax and take out Luna as a loan. So that is the Lego block.
00:36:40.616 - 00:36:41.310, Speaker B: That is.
00:36:46.160 - 00:36:56.884, Speaker A: Is that because I'm aware of Mars protocol? Like, I feel like there's been talked about forever? Is that what we're looking to like Mars needs to go live in order for this to work?
00:36:57.082 - 00:37:03.910, Speaker B: No, it's both Mars. There is another protocol called Edge that is probably due to launch in a few weeks.
00:37:04.440 - 00:37:04.804, Speaker A: Cool.
00:37:04.842 - 00:37:06.672, Speaker B: Yeah, we're waiting for both of them.
00:37:06.826 - 00:37:41.836, Speaker A: Did not realize Edge was launching soon too I'll have to look that up here and share what that is. Edge protocol, Terra. That is, if anyone's interested to check it out. It looks like it's edge protocol is the just spell out edge protocol. That's it on Twitter. And then I'm trying to see here if they have. I don't think they have a website up yet, but cool, man, that's exciting to start to see those new money Legos launch.
00:37:41.836 - 00:38:20.510, Speaker A: Because staking, part of the reason, obviously, I was excited to talk with you here is staking is so important to the infrastructure of web3. But then if you go back to 2017, that market was so different because you couldn't borrow, you could do it on some centralized platforms. And so there was a lot of leverage trading that was going on. But I will be the first to admit, I am not a trader. I am an investor. I am a long term investor. So I want to be able to use simple tools to be able to take out really low leverage loans at best.
00:38:20.510 - 00:38:54.568, Speaker A: Gosh, I feel like we've almost covered really everything, just sort of like zigzagged around all the different topics I wanted to cover with you, I guess. Amit, what else is top of mind that you think folks should know about? We covered the future products that I was hoping to sort of highlight here. We've talked about the current state of what you can do with stator, but I think also understanding what also exists in the staking landscape. Is there anything else like maybe in.
00:38:54.574 - 00:39:46.216, Speaker B: The product should talk some of the moonshots we've been thinking about? So there are several interesting projects that can be built on top of these liquid staked assets that people should know about at least. These are really like, amorphous ideas in our heads. Would love to bring these to reality in the future, for sure. Some of these moonshots are think of a cross asset ETF composed of 30% ETH, 20 Luna, 20 soul, 20 atom, 20 Phantom. Right. And then all of these assets are not just giving you price appreciation, but the native tokens are actually staked. And you have a liquid token for each of them.
00:39:46.216 - 00:39:49.400, Speaker B: And probably have the entire ETF has one liquid token.
00:39:50.880 - 00:40:23.396, Speaker A: Yeah. That's a really cool idea. Yeah. If you can do that in a decentralized manner, which is what's really exciting here. That's really cool because that is also what institutional buyers are going to be looking at. And really, anyone is going to like anyone who wants that diversified exposure, but without having to individually go out and stake those, because then you're holding the staked version of that token. That's really cool.
00:40:23.396 - 00:40:41.304, Speaker A: I'm surprised, man. That is one idea I haven't heard anybody talk about, but that would be really cool. It just is a matter of also, I guess, where does it live? On what chain or what holds it all together? This is why I'm not a developer.
00:40:41.352 - 00:41:24.756, Speaker B: But this is going to be interesting. A lot of the cross chain infrastructure has to really develop very well in order to enable all of these probably cross chain wallets that are talking to these native smart contracts. That stator, I mean, either stator or for the matter, any kind of a liquid staking provider is building. So all of these have to sort of come together to enable this product. And this is one of the first products that really excited us, and we wanted to build this in the future. Maybe we'll bring this live to the market sooner than expected. Maybe we can just start with Terra and Solana as the first ETF.
00:41:24.756 - 00:41:32.460, Speaker B: That is, obviously, it's not just the asset. The underlying asset is also staked.
00:41:33.280 - 00:42:40.236, Speaker A: Yeah, no, these are just cool ideas. The multi chain ETF, I am just surprised. I have not heard anyone talk about that before, because one thing that got really popular when balancer launched, gosh, it was almost the sales value years ago. Yeah, we all got excited about, well, now you can put whatever you want into a pool and basically create your own little. So what I've been really excited about, with my roots still having been in Ethereum, is I got so excited about Polygon and Terra and Solana and avalanche to think about. Okay, if these are different communities that are growing, what happens when all of these applications that we use are truly connected? And let's just talk about the plumbing that connects them. Creates, like, one reservoir of liquidity.
00:42:40.236 - 00:43:39.600, Speaker A: So right now there's fragmented liquidity. You get better rates if you're on one network versus another. But this is a future that it's not just a possibility, it's absolutely going to happen. Another terra project that kind of played off of this principle is Orion. Money has been allowing people to earn the anchor rate, but they're earning 15% on Ethereum, on polygon, and on BSC, and they're taking, obviously that difference. But my argument is that they're creating all this convenience for those who just, for whatever reason, are on a certain network and are unwilling to get set up on same sort of idea. But the future is about just, I think, being able to access the same liquidity, same opportunity from any chain.
00:43:39.600 - 00:44:25.040, Speaker A: I will be most interested, though, to see then what does create the network effects on an ethereum l two, like ZKE, EVM or arbitrum versus the community that already exists on like an avalanche or terra. But yeah. Anyways, this is the conversation I needed today as the markets are. By the way, if anyone watches this in the future, it's Monday, January 24, 2022. It's been a really tumultuous crypto crash the last few days, and it's good to refocus on the fundamentals of what's being built. Any other moonshot projects you had in mind, Amit, or any other ideas that you were thinking with these liquid staking derivatives?
00:44:25.960 - 00:44:32.228, Speaker B: There are quite a few, but I think we've discussed enough. Awesome. Yeah, maybe for some other time.
00:44:32.394 - 00:44:53.276, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so let's leave with this. How can someone get involved? What do they need to know about Stator? I've already shared. They should follow you guys on Twitter. But more importantly, they can go to statorlabs.com. That's where the Dap is. If you hold Luna, that's where I stake Luna through the Dap there.
00:44:53.276 - 00:44:55.150, Speaker A: But what else do they need to know?
00:44:55.600 - 00:45:27.344, Speaker B: Awesome. So in order to be a user, you can just simply go to sterileabs.com, stake your Luna across any of the pools or liquid staking. You can also farm our SD tokens. About 25,000 SD tokens can be farmed every day. If you put your luna Luna XlP on terra, swap. Beyond that, if you're a developer or if you're a product guy, if you're a content writer designer, feel free to reach out to us on our Twitter or Telegram groups.
00:45:27.344 - 00:45:42.430, Speaker B: We're happy to have a chat and onboard you as one of our team members do. Check out our coin list sale that is going live tomorrow. That is the first ever public sale we are doing. We have about a million registrations there.
00:45:43.680 - 00:46:32.460, Speaker A: Wait and question relative to that is so the 25,000 in SD tokens that have been accruing. So like, if someone, again, if you hold Luna X and Luna as a liquidity position, you guys take a snapshot, I think, like every few days, and that's accruing to those folks in the pool. Once this coin list sale happens, there will be an SD token. Do you know what is the end date for the 25,000 SD tokens? Does that end as soon as this auction is over or. Yeah, just trying to help people. If I want to make sure they can sort of plan ahead, that they don't get into it and are like, oh my gosh. The program ended.
00:46:33.040 - 00:47:05.572, Speaker B: Got you. Basically, the farming is live till February 9. Until February 9, you can farm SD tokens. Obviously, we didn't want to vest all the SD tokens at the same time. So the tokens farmed are vested over a six month period in equal installments every month. There's a 15% that is vested at the end of the second month itself. Because our TGE is getting delayed to early March, we are giving a 50% APY on the vested tokens, too.
00:47:05.572 - 00:47:09.560, Speaker B: So there is another opportunity for you to earn more SD tokens.
00:47:09.980 - 00:47:30.604, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's great. And glad there's a vesting schedule. That's the way it should always be set up. Worst thing ever is these farming programs. They get used by just folks who don't intend to be there beyond the farming program, and then they just dump the token. So vesting is always a good idea.
00:47:30.604 - 00:48:19.868, Speaker A: Well, Amit, thanks so much for your time. And just can't say enough good things, of course, about just being able to watch you all as builders put this together. And just, again, like, total pleasure to get to talk to you today on all days about staking infrastructure, to put a cap on it with this. This is like a multi trillion dollar market. That's how I think about staking. And so it's nuts, because at this point, if I check DFI, llama, and I look under staking, and this is, of course, just decentralized protocols, gosh, it's still such a small pie. Stator is around 400 million today.
00:48:19.868 - 00:49:03.584, Speaker A: Marinade is around 600, and Lido is around 8.5 billion. That's the top three right now. And again, this is what's required to secure these proof of stake networks. So unless we're all wrong and many of these networks were to die off, this is infrastructure that you can't live without. It's like building a house without a foundation. And just excited, too, of course, for all the other assets you're adding with stator this year, including, I know of, of course, is Phantom ETH soul and Hbar.
00:49:03.584 - 00:49:04.716, Speaker A: Is that the other one we've talked?
00:49:04.738 - 00:49:06.590, Speaker B: Hbar is also going live? Yes.
00:49:07.040 - 00:49:15.968, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, yeah. Hey, I'm going to just end this and we'll be in a green room in a sec if you have any questions. But anything else, Amit, before we go?
00:49:16.134 - 00:49:20.832, Speaker B: No, I'm good. Thanks a lot, everyone, for watching it.
00:49:20.966 - 00:49:50.900, Speaker A: Yeah, everyone, thanks for tuning in.
