00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.402, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, this is the DFI download at Permissionless 2022, brought to you by Bancorp. I'm joined here by the founder of Synthetics, Cain, Warwick Cain, in case anyone's new to synthetics. What is synthetics?
00:00:19.546 - 00:00:29.410, Speaker B: Synthetics is synthetic asset platform. It allows people to have exposure to a range of assets like gold, silver, bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain.
00:00:29.570 - 00:00:51.018, Speaker A: So I actually got into synthetics back in 2019. So I've been able to watch all of the growth and progress over the years. A really bold move that you all made was you moved to optimism, which is an ethereum l two about a year ago, I guess, can you talk about that journey? And then also, I guess, what have people missed about this move to Ethereum l two?
00:00:51.184 - 00:01:22.760, Speaker B: I think there was, like a lot of things in Ethereum, an expectation that this was going to be much faster. And it's been a much more protracted kind of rollout for all of the l two s. Right? Like whether it's starkware, starknet, arbitram, optimism, all of this stuff, it's very hard and it's taken longer than people expected. And so I think that that has kind of lulled people into this lack of awareness where it's just been this very slow rollout. It's not like, it's like, okay, main net's live now. Go. Right.
00:01:22.760 - 00:01:30.426, Speaker B: I think the shift will be the token. So with optimism, token is about to launch. It launches in, I think, like two weeks.
00:01:30.528 - 00:01:31.130, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:31.280 - 00:02:06.370, Speaker B: All of a sudden you've now got this thing right where it's like, all right, people can get exposure to the network, creates alignment. And I think with synthetix, the reason why we made the decision early to start this shift is you will remember staking and claiming and everything was very expensive process. As gas prices went up, there was a point where I think a claim was like $200, which is just not viable. Right. And so we knew we had to move to a scaling solution much earlier than, I think, a lot of other projects that might not have been so gas intensive.
00:02:06.870 - 00:02:32.858, Speaker A: And then I guess, what do you think needs to happen next for optimism or ethereum L two s in general to really explode in terms of growth, because I think as of today, I want to say there's around like 500 million in total value locked on optimism. And I mean, that pales in comparison to, obviously, what we enjoy on Ethereum l one. So, yeah, what do you think helps to bootstrap that next phase of growth?
00:02:33.034 - 00:03:36.754, Speaker B: So I think it's quite interesting when you interact on optimism with things like uniswap synthetics, it feels like going back to pre d five summer, like 2019, right? Like you do a transaction, there's like no ArB bots that go and arb the prices across different pools, right? So you go and do something in curve and then nothing happens in uniswap because it's just the infrastructure and all of the supporting stuff just isn't there yet. And so again, I think that the catalyst for the growth and a lot more liquidity to flow in is going to be the optimism token. Because now the op token can be used by projects to incentivize their users to interact, for people to bridge. There is like a learning curve, right? Like with these things. And so unless you have the right incentives, people are probably going to be sort of, I guess, averse to bridging over and learning about how this ecosystem works. But I think now they've got a good reason. The token and the token claim and the airdrop will be a good reason to get people, maybe for the first time as Ethereum users to come across.
00:03:36.754 - 00:04:06.506, Speaker B: But also, I think even more importantly, some of the other l ones, like there are people who just have only transacted on avalanche. They came in and they found avalanche, and they're avalanche users. I think now there is a vast and cheap and effective network within the ethereum ecosystem, in addition to polygon, in addition to some of the side chains, that is really powerful. And I think that we're going to see some amazing stuff be built there and that's going to drive people coming across.
00:04:06.608 - 00:04:47.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited for those users that you mentioned. Maybe they only transacted on avalanche, and it's like there's a whole nother world of defi you haven't discovered. And with, I think, bridges improving and becoming more reliable, I think a lot of us use hop to get on and off of optimism. I just can't imagine folks aren't going to benefit from that. Another thing with synthetics I noticed lately is there's lots of teams building with synthetics. Like you've got the polynomial team that those folks just launched, vaults, which use SUSD and other synthetic assets. And then we've also got Lyra.
00:04:47.430 - 00:04:57.558, Speaker A: Anything else, though, that we should be aware of or just be following for the next update to come to synthetics?
00:04:57.654 - 00:05:39.270, Speaker B: I think the next update for synthetics is going to be V three, which will probably happen later this year. It's a from the ground rewrite of the entire contract suite, which is something that we haven't done for almost three years, really start from a fresh base. So yeah, that's super exciting. A bunch of new mechanism design stuff that there's a lot of learnings out there from DFI, things around like governance tokens and vote locking and all kinds of stuff that just didn't exist in 2018 when we wrote those original contracts. So yeah, it's completely redesigned, going to be a much, much more powerful protocol.
00:05:39.430 - 00:06:08.722, Speaker A: I think we all feel a little more at home in this market because there's like a return to rational thinking. Well, some rational thinking. I'm excited to see that first class of Defi OGs, which is like the likes of synthetics and compound and aave and curve. I think there's so much building and just growth ahead of us. I think that's what bear markets are for. It's kind of a return to the noise drops. Exactly.
00:06:08.776 - 00:06:49.280, Speaker B: The fundamentals. Look, crypto is never fully fundamental driven. Right? Like, there's always a speculative aspect because we are so early, right. But it doesn't need to be purely speculative and utter insanity. And I think for the last twelve months it's kind of been utter insanity. And so having things slow down, giving people a chance to kind of catch up and actually start to learn about some of the things that exist on some of these other networks and why we've made the decisions we've made about optimism and what l two scaling looks like and what the post merge ethereum ecosystem looks like. All of this stuff people haven't had a chance to even do.
00:06:49.280 - 00:06:52.846, Speaker B: There's not been enough time in the day to keep track of everything.
00:06:52.948 - 00:07:30.220, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, hey, thanks for joining me. In case anyone's never heard this, Kane is considered the godfather of yield farming, which goes back to like, they had this early incentive as an LP, which really kind of paved the way for many of us to think about how yield farming works. And I still remember the magic of learning, like, I can be an LP and be incentivized to do that anyways. I can't imagine all the other innovations that are yet to come. So anyways, dude, you know I love you guys. Good to see you home.
