00:00:00.250 - 00:00:51.050, Speaker A: EVM and Ethereum has done an incredible job creating a moat around its users and around its liquidity towards the standard. If you're not building on EVM, you're shooting yourself in the foot. You're starting off at a massive disadvantage. So what makes for a really difficult cold start problem in our current time is not only being so deep within a crypto winter, and so resources are pretty scarce, and resources are naturally going to be concentrated to the most established blockchains. And so if you're launching a new blockchain, particularly when resources are scarce, it's really difficult to bootstrap those metrics. To convince users to leave established ecosystems for infantile ones, you are necessarily competing with other networks for their users, for their liquidity, for their developers.
00:00:53.470 - 00:01:13.518, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad and I'm here with nomadic from four RC. On this episode, we'll spotlight a team that is recently coming out of stealth, developing the movement network, which brings modularity and interoperability to non EVM smart contract languages and their ecosystems.
00:01:13.614 - 00:01:27.574, Speaker A: We've architected these solutions in such a way that any virtual machine, any application, any infrastructure, or even any blockchain would be able to leverage movement in order to solve the cold start problem.
00:01:27.692 - 00:02:09.960, Speaker B: Today, we'll learn about the benefits of this new web3 infrastructure designed for projects who face a cold start problem, launching on none EVM chains such as Aptos and suite.

00:02:12.410 - 00:02:51.650, Speaker C: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs, and today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account. If we zoom out. Since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial laws.
00:02:54.950 - 00:03:36.530, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain UX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas. One gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadapt's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:03:37.110 - 00:04:06.314, Speaker B: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce two guests. Joining us from movement Labs, Rushi Manche is the CTO and co founder of Movement Labs. As a move engineer, he's worked previously on projects on Aptos. Joining him is Cooper Scanlon, the co founder and CEO of Movement Labs. As a move builder, he built one of the first DeFi applications on Aptos and has previously worked alongside tradfi institutions entering the blockchain space. So on that note, guys, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you both doing?
00:04:06.432 - 00:04:08.534, Speaker E: Not too bad, thank you. Fabio Salt.
00:04:08.582 - 00:04:09.482, Speaker A: Yeah, doing great.
00:04:09.536 - 00:04:59.238, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great to have you guys on to. I think before we got started here, we were saying that really, this is for you to dumb down for us that are not engineers, that are not developers, to understand the work that is being done on some other high throughput blockchains and how the best way to describe this is the cold start problem that they have starting up an ecosystem and being able to access users and liquidity from other chains. Again, some of that cold start problem is resolved by what you're building with movement labs. Why don't we start actually with a bit about what drew the two of you into working on a newer, high throughput blockchain, like Aptos?
00:04:59.414 - 00:05:55.626, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So what originally brought me into the blockchain space was the idea of being able to bring very disruptive technologies across different industries. As young adult, preparing to enter the workforce and being around that age, I saw a lot of industries that grew very stiffened, that had already been catalyzed, a lot of the value had already been extracted by them in today's sense. And so creating a new technology, bringing that to market in an optimal way, allows for new value to be created. And that's a really key thing for me in order to find my footing, in order to find financial independence. So I was originally doing that with a fund of funds and we were building a SPAC DAO vehicle. What was really exciting about that as it relates to move is that one better asset, portability.
00:05:55.626 - 00:06:38.154, Speaker A: It's much more intuitive to build these applications with move assets and objects are more akin to physical real life things than abstract lines of code. So it's easier to build. It's easier to build complex applications with. And then with the account models. And with move language, you also have better portability and clearer portability between different parties. And then within modules you can define who is able to move assets, where they can move to and from, to essentially create these encoded guardrails. So when I was building that vehicle, we didn't have move yet, and we ran into a lot of pain points surrounding those areas which I just described, which move solves for.
00:06:38.154 - 00:06:49.790, Speaker A: And so after we wrapped up that joint venture, I was incredibly excited to just dive into the move ecosystem, get my head fully underwater, fully immersed, and get to build.
00:06:49.940 - 00:07:44.970, Speaker E: Yeah, I think me and Cooper were both coming from the original Aptos background. Remember first being the cosmic ecosystem, just doing engineering here and there. I heard about this new chain that allegedly had 160k TPS. I've heard about the whole move language before because it was obviously the first language designed by Facebook. For those of you guys listening that aren't really too familiar with move is and why move is. A few years back, the Facebook team, particularly at the Libro DM project, really wanted to create a blockchain technology or language that was suited for Facebook itself, but also for NFTs that are minting on top of meta or back then, Facebook integrations, they believe that solidity just wasn't cutting it for them. And if they were ever going to integrate with their social media apps and the various services that we all know Facebook and now Meta has, we're going to need a superior scaling scale solution.
00:07:44.970 - 00:08:17.190, Speaker E: So that started the research and it's been over like a billion dollars, I believe that's been poured into really find the optimal programming language for these institutions to hop into web3 and crypto in general. So I heard about that just a while ago. And then when I was in the CoS ecosystem, just really heard that it was finally taking materializing, heard about Aptos'raises, the behemoth raises that they did the testnets that were launching. So that kind of led me to development. So I was building some DeFi apps, Dexs index protocols there and then I had my Cooper.
00:08:17.270 - 00:08:42.850, Speaker F: Love it guys. I think maybe before we dive even deeper into movement, I would love for you to kind of break down what DeFi dad mentioned about this cold start problem. We talked a little bit about it before going on air, too, but I think it's a problem that faces all of these new blockchains that are sprouting up and would just love to kind of hear your novel solution to this. And then that probably leads us right into movement as well, for sure.
00:08:42.920 - 00:09:34.270, Speaker A: So a little bit about the cold start problem. It is essentially the difficulty faced in onboarding and bootstrapping your initial users liquidity and projects. So what makes for a really difficult cold start problem in our current time is not only being so deep within a crypto winter, and so resources are pretty scarce, and resources are naturally going to be concentrated to the most established blockchains. And this market is pretty saturated. There's a lot of l ones at this point. We're starting to enter into the L two meta, if you will. And so if you're launching a new blockchain, particularly when resources are scarce, you are necessarily competing with other networks for their users, for their liquidity, for their developers.
00:09:34.270 - 00:10:23.934, Speaker A: And, I mean, if we think of this as like a very dark, very bleak winter, you're not going to leave where the food supply is, no matter how revolutionary the technology is, crypto is just as much thin as it is tech. And so where we see things right now, particularly with the move language, is that because these ecosystems are so novel, because they are brought to market in a way that goes head to head with other established blockchains, it's really difficult to bootstrap those metrics to convince users to leave established ecosystems for infantile ones, to convince applications to leave ecosystems where, although the inbound liquidity is not very abundant, there exists some to ones where you're also having to fight for that tooth and claw.
00:10:23.982 - 00:10:24.242, Speaker E: Right.
00:10:24.296 - 00:10:28.486, Speaker A: So that's a little bit about the cold start problem.
00:10:28.668 - 00:11:36.934, Speaker E: Yeah, I think touching on what are we doing to just that. I think this concept of sterilization unification is really what we're trying to hammer on at the issue from a developer point of view. For people who aren't developer Savy is right now there's 900 chains, different software development kits, which we call SDKs. Basically, the way you publish smart contracts to a blockchain is a whole different libraries and kind of technical stacks that you go through, and for each additional chain basically requires you to learn an entirely different universe of code. And that kind of gets even problematic when you have the new Solanas of the world, the app does, and suites of the world or even the new Starquares, where it's Cairo, right? If you want developers to completely leave ecosystems, but also learn new programming language, do new wallet, get new APIs, it's very difficult. It fragments the industry because now you have different groups all fighting for the same user base, but struggling to share resources. So that's really informed the overarching thesis, building an SDK to rule them all, where you can have one smart contract, one app, get launched on a single interface and deploy different chains of choice.
00:11:36.934 - 00:11:42.090, Speaker E: And move just happens to be a feature for security and performance reasons, which we can get more into later.
00:11:42.240 - 00:12:50.274, Speaker A: Yeah, and I want to say one other thing that relates to the cold Star problem in a broader way that's not necessarily targeting move specifically, is that right now in the status quo, what technology you build with determines where you build, which determines how accessible users and liquidity are, as well as necessarily the ceiling of what is potential to be onboarded. And so we see a lot of cutting edge applications, unfortunately falling by the wayside because they're just not being brought to market in a way that is web3 native. I think that especially as we onboard more builders and more users into the web3 space, it's not clear oftentimes where the best place to build. You have to manage the tech stack, you have to manage where you build. And oftentimes there are things that people miss out on that unfortunately are catastrophic or are existential to the growth potential of what they're building.
00:12:50.472 - 00:13:29.918, Speaker E: Yeah. And the concept of liquidity access, I think the Solana of the world took like what, four years for it to kick up and then kind of FTX kind of wrecked it after. Since we are facing similar struggles where even though the users are there and wallets are kicking up, it's still really difficult for DeFi protocols to create strategies. If you're building yield agator on Apperson suite, even on Salana right now, it's very difficult to create strategies because of very few protocols. Right. The cross chain interoperability is simply lacking because you're relying on bridges, you're relying on technology built on top of the bridges. So it's really out of your control if you can deploy a smart contract and interact with the system.
00:13:29.918 - 00:13:49.046, Speaker E: So I think interacting with the middleware or something like what we're doing with the SDK, that's universal. You can have a yield aggregator that launches on a chain of choice and tap into primary chain liquidity, or like ethereum liquidity without needing the layer zeros, the wormholes, the bridges of the world to do the work for you. You don't need to wait for integration to happen. You can just do the integration yourself.
00:13:49.148 - 00:14:21.646, Speaker A: EVM and Ethereum has done an incredible job creating a moat around its users and around its liquidity to where it's the standard. If you're not building on EVM, you're shooting yourself in the foot. You're starting off at a massive disadvantage. And time and time again, people have branded themselves as the Ethereum killer. And time and time again, Ethereum has stood strong. And so the way that we bring this to market in a web3 native way is that we have this in mind. We're not trying to take anyone down.
00:14:21.646 - 00:14:33.726, Speaker A: We're not trying to necessarily compete. You see, this is more so a complementary, so that we can raise all tides or be a common tide to raise all ships in the web3 ecosystem.
00:14:33.838 - 00:14:54.138, Speaker F: Guys, I think we've done a lot of table setting as far as the landscape of what's happening in the industry right now and some of the challenges. I think we should dive into movement labs a bit further and just kind of explain more in depth what you're both building with movement. We've kind of danced around it a bit, but whoever wants to take that one, just go ahead.
00:14:54.224 - 00:16:07.126, Speaker E: Yeah, I think what we're doing is really in line with the modular narrative, the ability to create customized solutions for different ecosystems, different use cases, and not having to force infrastructure to adapt to you. Instead, you can adapt to infrastructure. So move in labs is building the first module execution layer environment. So essentially being able to bring the move VM, the move SDK to different ecosystems. So we're starting with the Avalanche integration, which is m one flagship move layer one on top of that, which is consensus, allowing any move protocol, whether you're DFI gaming NFTs, to launch on this high throughput chain, but also still be an existing EVM traditional community. Right? You want access to the curves of the world, the balance of the world, the obvious of the world, where they have a lot of liquidity on these primarily EVM chains, but you want the ability to scale solidity in that. If you have a use case where it's Orbrook and defi that wants to paralyze transactions, or your gaming NFT project that wants to mint a million NFTs, doesn't want to pay egregious amounts of gas fees and slow transactions, you can actually launch on this subnet, if you will, where you can interact with the primary chain natively.
00:16:07.126 - 00:16:55.962, Speaker E: And I think that kind of ties into the next question is, what is a subnet? And I think Avalanche has done a great job kind of explaining and kind of spearheading this side chain scaling solution. The way I would kind of explain it, and the other folks in ableabs probably would, is it's a solver network, essentially within the avalanche broader network. So a subnet can be a layer one, it can be an app chain, it could be persistent institutional chain. It's really a scaling method for users to be within the same validator set, a safe community, but have their own independent use case, particularly your own independent blockchain. And that's kind of informing the first project that we're building M one. We want the ability to have average throughput chain. We notch 146,000 TPS, which isn't really possible on an EVM traditional chain.
00:16:55.962 - 00:17:05.634, Speaker E: So using the subject technology gives us a liquidity access to primary chains. It's in the same ballader set. And B allows us to be within the community and grow within the community.
00:17:05.752 - 00:18:10.486, Speaker A: And as it relates to how we got here, Rushi and I, we were both move builders, and we got to see a lot of the exciting use cases for the language. Became very bullish on move, very bullish on the move community and its other builders, and faced the pain points of a difficult cold start problem. For our applications, we want to see move builders, move Dapps be able to get plugged into networks to onboard large numbers of users in liquidity so that they're able to grow and scale to take these move innovations from square one, which is where we're at right now, to things that we couldn't even comprehend. The only way that happens is if they're able to grow and scale effectively. So as it relates to movement, we're democratizing the move language. We're bringing it to market in a web3 native way. And with products such as avalanche subnets, we're able to deliver move environments and thereby their respective applications to the front door of users and builders, where they exist today.
00:18:10.668 - 00:18:22.262, Speaker B: Guys, I want to go back to something Rishi mentioned about M One. Can you define what is m one? And then how does that relate to movement and avalanche?
00:18:22.326 - 00:18:49.474, Speaker E: Yeah, so the name m one kind of comes from the term a modular layer. One. The ability for us to take a tertiary movie M is like within Appleson suite. It's not locked up in a monolithic environment, which means you can't swap out different traits in a blockchain. If you're building on top of it, you're forced to stay within the environment, you have no customization. Long story short. So m one is a take where we're saying, okay, this is a layer one, but it's customized or modular in this sense.
00:18:49.474 - 00:19:20.458, Speaker E: So we brought the move Vm from a different tech stack and brought it to EVM. It's kind of like combining two different elements. You have the EVM community, the liquidity, all your favorite apps and tooling the wallets, et cetera. And you have this new novel technology, which is the move virtual machine. Are kind of bringing it together and calling it a modular one. So essentially what it is, it's technically an avalanche subnet, which means it shares security of Avalanche. So validators stake a vaccine token of Avalanche and also stake our own token.
00:19:20.458 - 00:19:40.866, Speaker E: So day zero, you inherit the security of avalanche itself. And then the unique part is you have the move virtual machine on top of it. So you're not limited to just solidity we all saw last weekend. Or if they're dating. It's July 30. I believe that curve went down July 31, something like that. And we want to create secure development environments.
00:19:40.866 - 00:20:23.230, Speaker E: We want D five apps to not get hacked for millions of dollars. We want gaming apps to have access to hundreds of thousand TPS. That's really possible without solidity. With solidity and EVM. So our solution is how do we combine the best of both worlds? How do we bring a new technology to existing liquidity bases and user bases? And that inspired M one, a modular layer, one built on top of avalanche consensus that can natively tap into the primary chain, liquidity, through warp messaging, which essentially is Avalanche's bridging protocol. So essentially, if you're yield aggregator on the subnet, you can tap into the liquidity natively of the primary chain, which is where most people have heard of activity and share the liquidity, essentially. So there's more strategies for D five protocols.
00:20:23.230 - 00:20:32.082, Speaker E: Gaming projects can use marketplaces on different chains. It's essentially baked to interoperability, which is really exciting for just bringing more adoption to non EVM.
00:20:32.146 - 00:21:05.858, Speaker A: Yeah, and what sets an M one apart from an L1 is that you've got vertical composability as well as horizontal scalability that can be different blockchains, even in different virtual machines. And then you additionally have full backwards compatibility with the primary network that it's launched on top of, which enables you to more effectively solve the cold start problem as well as long term. It becomes this melting pot of different ecosystems and different communities who have full native composability and communication with each other. For the first time.
00:21:05.944 - 00:22:49.822, Speaker B: Can I ask you more strategically, or maybe even philosophically here, why continue to build for the non EVM space, given the dominance of EVM chains and ethereum? I think that a few years ago, when we were at the height of the last crypto bull run, there was a peak sort of interest in non EVM chains. And like every sort of crypto bull run, I think that the narrative really builds that we've got x new technology and this is superior technology, and that this can ultimately win out. And so, obviously, a lot has changed since then. We've lived through a pretty normal but severe crypto bear market. That said, EVM dominance, I would say, has probably increased since then, while also acknowledging the fact that the baseline of activity on non EVM and EVM chains is just so much more than what it was four or five years ago. So the fact that we have workable DFI apps on something like an Aptos and sui, while there's still an enormous amount of activity that's happening on some of the Ethereum l two s, how do you think about that? What ultimately drove you to want to build, to cater for these move developers that are building around the cold start problem that we talked about earlier?
00:22:49.886 - 00:24:13.834, Speaker E: I think particularly the concept of adoption is something we all discuss is like, how are we going to get these big bangs? How are you going this entertainment studios, how are we going to get the segas of the world, Nintendo's of the world, using blockchain? And when we're reflecting on the current state of EVM solidity, et cetera, it's very common to realize it's not possible to go to any major bank, Morgan, et cetera. They all have their crypto divisions, but solidity is just not scalable for them. You can't have a marketplace on top of Ethereum, because what if it gets crashed, right? What if people use the same rescue attack that took curve down, except it's not millions of dollars, it's billions, potentially trillions of dollars, right? So any small attack like that, from a security point of view, completely destroys perception of blockchain. So when these technology analysts, the CTOs of these major banks institutions, are looking at the current blockchain, sure, there's d five volume ethereum, L two s and stuff, but the real goal that we're all trying to achieve here is how do we get the normal person using blockchain? And our thesis is, that's not possible in solidity, it's not possible in EVM, but we still want to bring the non EVM technology to existing EVM communities and potentially scale it to outside EVM. So that's when we really look at move a. It was a language designed by Facebook, one of the bigger companies, if not the biggest company in the tech ecosystem. So that itself gives a validation.
00:24:13.834 - 00:24:51.414, Speaker E: Like, hey, if a bank or gaming protocol is to ever use blockchain, they probably want to use a language designed by Facebook and not some language five years ago that's been hacked every year for the same attack for hundreds of millions of dollars. Last year was $3 billion attacks. And then B, it's on performance, right? Like solidity. And EvM is doing, what, five to ten TPs? If you ever have a Nintendo using blockchain, you're going to want to be able to do 100,000 transactions per second doing parallel transactions instead of just breaking the chain constantly. And we saw that with early game projects in the day. And now more and more people are waking up and realizing they need non.
00:24:51.462 - 00:25:32.146, Speaker A: EPM, cutting edge technology. Think has traditionally been used as a selling point and a point of competition thing. That's a very web two sort of operations. Whereas the key differentiator for movement, the framework we've developed is that incentives are actually aligned from the layer one to the application, all the way down to the end user level. So we're not taking liquidity, we're not taking users, we're not taking transactions from any network that we're on. It still belongs to the layer one, the DAP, respectively. And then for the user, we're not asking them to cross land and sea, to bridge their assets, to use different infrastructure, different wallets.
00:25:32.146 - 00:25:50.982, Speaker A: We meet them where they are. And so this really is a complementary push that we believe is going to support chains, long term support web3 as an ecosystem, as opposed to it just being the next revolutionary technology that we're trying to sell people on and take them from other networks.
00:25:51.126 - 00:26:30.766, Speaker F: It honestly all seems like blockchain inception to me, just as I'm trying to wrap my head around this. I love it. But another thing that Rishi was saying kind of made me think about the developer issue that we've been talking about as well. There's only so many developers in the ecosystem, and I was wondering, is there any tooling within the movement SDK to allow and grab some of these other developers that are working in rust solidity and other coding languages to compile into the move language? Is that something that you're also working on? So then your pool of developers just expands and the amount of people that can work within the move, language grows.
00:26:30.898 - 00:27:00.926, Speaker E: What we're really focused on is standardization, right? We want the ability to have different chains, different ecosystems, all within our one SDK. But you also want different languages, right? There'll be more about this coming out later this month, so I don't want to spoil everything, but yes, we will be building a translator, essentially, into our SDK. So any solidity app, rust app, WaSM app, etc. Can all use move without even realizing it. You have baked in security and performance on any BM of choice using any language of choice with the modularity of move on any chain of choice.
00:27:01.038 - 00:27:09.910, Speaker F: Guys, let's talk about some of the early traction or partnerships you're seeing so far kind of in defi gaming, NFTs, anything that you can tell us there.
00:27:10.060 - 00:28:00.966, Speaker E: So I think what we've really been focusing on is onboarding these obviously apperson suite projects. The Billy we say to them is, hey, you can suite, you can launch on the chain of your choice that probably had more volume and user base to the community. So onboarding those protocols as a base rate for the traditional Dexs, the order books, the lending protocols, staking providers, very standard protocols. We're also targeting rust protocols. So going to Solana communities, the Xterra communities, the Polkadots, and saying, hey, you have code wrist and rust, it probably doesn't take you, it takes you like, maybe three weeks. We'll help you with engineering support, we'll give you a grant whatnot, and help you launch different ecosystems. And then what we're also doing is going to this EVM projects that have been plagued with issues, especially this weekend, we saw the security issues coming up.
00:28:00.966 - 00:28:35.550, Speaker E: So now the pitch is, okay, if you're a major defi protocol, here's how you can embed security without needing to completely rewrite your code base. And just obviously games to do. So we're seeing a big boom in Asia, predominantly Korea, Taiwan, Japan, where move as a language is booming, particularly those fastest growing developer ecosystem there. And then all these gaming studios are waking up to like, hey, we can launch these high throughput games on top of these blockchains. So we're saying, okay, you can launch these games on the favorite chain of your choice instead of having before sun on a monotheic chain.
00:28:35.630 - 00:29:34.338, Speaker A: Yeah. There are two major sides to these partnerships and the people that we're working with. On one side, we have novel applications that are very excited to get plugged into different networks, get plugged into more users, more liquidity in a native way, and then for those networks that we are supporting. We have a lot of excitement for existing applications who now get to upgrade their smart contract security, who now get to experience parallel processing and to be able to do so in a way that does not necessarily require them to write a significant move code on their side. One other really exciting avenue is that we get to talk with a lot of people who are in the web. Two side, whether that be entertainment, whether that be more traditional institutions that you would think of, who for the first time rather they've been looking at blockchain for some time now, but haven't been sold on it, have seen a lot of the pain points and with move, they're really excited by that as well.
00:29:34.424 - 00:29:58.890, Speaker F: One of the things I was going to ask you is just kind of like the BD effort of starting something kind of net new like this, and how much of a headache that can be. But what I'm hearing is a lot of this is people coming to you. Has that been the case or have you had to really turn on that business development machine and go out and kind of meet people and engage them and bring them in?
00:29:58.960 - 00:31:01.262, Speaker A: Yeah, we're grateful to be working with so many amazing partners. We really are standing on the shoulders of giants, and that's what enables a solution, that's what enables a solution such as ours to be brought to market so quickly and so effectively. We do get to meet a lot of really awesome people in the space. One thing that we're also picking up a lot is creating content, creating educational content and awareness for the move language itself. For example, we're not just speaking with move projects, we're speaking with projects in every ecosystem that we will be supporting. And so we do a lot to teach people about the move language, how it can be leveraged, some exciting things within that space, as well as entering and defining this brand new category of emerging infrastructure and solutions that we supporting. We're doing a lot of educational content and a lot of deciding in that front as well.
00:31:01.262 - 00:31:20.290, Speaker A: But it's really exciting to get to meet so many different teams from so many different areas. And we really are this melting pot and the culmination of a lot of these perspectives of builders from different ecosystems, applications, layer ones, users, info providers, et cetera. We really are here to serve.
00:31:20.370 - 00:31:26.498, Speaker B: So what can you tell us about the functionality or utility of a future movement token?
00:31:26.594 - 00:31:41.818, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So as it relates to M one, it's going to be pretty similar to existing layer one tokens in that it's used for gas. It's a medium of exchange, securing the network, it's going to be staked.
00:31:41.914 - 00:31:42.174, Speaker E: Right?
00:31:42.212 - 00:32:26.314, Speaker A: But then what sets it apart from traditional layer one tokens is that we're supporting multiple virtual machines and multiple ecosystems, so its value is accruing for multiple directions. It's scalable in that every time we support a new virtual machine, that is an entirely new set of users and projects which will be driving demand for this token. And then at the same time, as we scale, the token becomes hedged across multiple ecosystems. So it's the most sustainable and scalable token that's powering the most sustainable and scalable network of blockchains that's ever been brought to market.
00:32:26.432 - 00:32:45.554, Speaker F: Hey guys, I wanted to talk to you about your raise process. I believe you're still somewhat in stealth. I haven't seen a lot of noise or any big announcements, but if there's anything you can share with us, just like how has fundraising been in the bear market? Anything you can give us some insight into that process.
00:32:45.672 - 00:33:05.170, Speaker E: It's definitely been interesting. We started a little bit while back and been kind of architecting where the market's going. Obviously you have a lot of unstability, but I'm excited to announce that we wrapped up a fundraising, so we'll be exiting stealth, hopefully end of this month, early next month, and a lot more noise to be generated.
00:33:05.250 - 00:33:24.662, Speaker B: Well guys, I think this is probably a great place for us to start to wrap up, but I want to give you the final word to talk to us about the roadmap for the rest of 2023. So what other milestones can we look forward to? And then what sort of preparations are you making for launching a testnet?
00:33:24.726 - 00:33:48.466, Speaker E: Yes, so we wrap up fundraising legoing public end of this month, next month Testnet is ready. You can check out Docs Movementlabs XYZ and interact with us. Feel free to reach out. And then once we're public fully, you can interact with the socials, discords, twitters. Feel free to engage with us and play on the testnet and then incentivize testnet shortly after with some rewards to come.
00:33:48.568 - 00:33:57.286, Speaker A: We're really thrilled to start getting to work with our community a bit more once we exit stealth and to invite others to be a part of this movement with us.
00:33:57.388 - 00:34:33.218, Speaker B: Well, I want to remind listeners that they can learn more by going to movementlabs xyz and then they should follow movement labs on Twitter and then just wanted to say thank you. Thanks for coming on the show. To dumb all of this down for nomadic and me. I know that even we as power users, we're pretty ignorant to a lot of the challenges that developers face, and clearly you are working to meet them where they are on non EVM chains. But guys, anything else you want to share here before we go?
00:34:33.304 - 00:34:40.838, Speaker A: Well, thank you for having us and want to encourage everyone to check out our Twitter. That's where the first you'll be able to hear about us first.
00:34:40.924 - 00:34:43.670, Speaker E: Yep, the Es rally song. And stay tuned for the end of the month.
00:34:43.820 - 00:34:56.870, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge Pod.
