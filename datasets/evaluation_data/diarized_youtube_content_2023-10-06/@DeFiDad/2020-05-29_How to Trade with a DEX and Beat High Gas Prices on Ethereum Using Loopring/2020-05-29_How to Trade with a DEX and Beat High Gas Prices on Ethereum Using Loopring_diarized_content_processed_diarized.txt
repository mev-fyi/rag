00:00:13.780 - 00:00:55.524, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad. I wanted to call your attention back to loopring. So I've been using loopring for the past few months because it's a newer type of exchange that you can use on Ethereum. So it is a Dex, which is exciting because with a dex, of course, you're always in control of your assets. I think what's the real innovation here is the fact that they use zero knowledge proofs to enable higher throughput. And so this exchange runs around like 2000 transactions per second or potentially faster. But there's lots of variables to that, so I have no idea how fast it's running any given day.
00:00:55.524 - 00:01:52.316, Speaker A: But that's what the loop ring team has told me. Aside from that, I'm also able to trade at a few fractions of a cent per trade. So I'm paying very little money to do trades. And the reason that's important to me is that recently I've been frustrated with the gas prices on Ethereum like anyone else. So I've been thinking about how can I beat that? And this is one of those few tools that is in the Defi space that I can continue to use where I'm enjoying the user experience, feeling like I'm almost using a centralized exchange, but I'm still using what is built on Ethereum and I know that I'm always in control of my assets. So if you go to loopring.org up in the top right hand corner, if you click on the trade button, you'll open up the exchange.
00:01:52.316 - 00:02:53.056, Speaker A: You want to bookmark the exchange because if you don't, there's a chance that in the future someone could register a site that looks like loopring IO and they could potentially be phishing for you to reset a key or somehow give them access to some funds. So make sure you bookmark that just to be safe. When you're ready to create an account, you can go up to the top right hand corner. Now I'm already connected to my metamask account, and so what I'm going to do is click Register account here. Now the reason I have to register an account is because you do need an account to be tied to your Ethereum address. So reading off of the actual text they have here, this simply ties your Ethereum address to the exchange Merkel tree. You can make deposits once your account registration request is being processed, withdrawals and trading will be available after your account has been registered.
00:02:53.056 - 00:03:31.890, Speaker A: Long story short, this is what allows me to put my funds in and pull them out of the exchange. This is all still being run on Ethereum. I am the one that's in control of my assets, but this is part of the reason that I'm able to trade at a faster rate. This is part of the reason that trades feel like they settle almost instantly. It's very important, though, that you're in control, of course, of your metamask account. So please, as always, take good care of that and don't lose access to that. Otherwise you'll lose access to your funds in loop ring, and there's nothing loopring can do to retrieve those for you.
00:03:31.890 - 00:04:47.982, Speaker A: If you would like to try out loop ring, the good news is that they've given me this code DFI dad, this gives you 0% on maker fees and 0.6% if you create a taker order. I want to make clear I am not being paid at all for this. The team was kind enough to follow up on my request. They had some referral links made up, which I think is awesome for marketing and growth with exchanges. Because of the nature of my work here in curating products for DeFi, I was worried that it could muddy the waters of whether or not I'm sharing this, because I think that loop ring is a fantastic product, or am I doing it because I'm financially incentivized to share it? And so I thought it was better for me to just continue what I've been doing, which is to never take money for creating tutorials and product reviews in the DFI space. So anyways, if you go here and you enter in DFI dad, you get 0% on maker fees for one year, and you get 0.6%
00:04:47.982 - 00:05:25.828, Speaker A: on taker orders for a year. So once you register your account with loop ring, you're going to roll through two different transactions. You're going to have to sign a transaction which costs you nothing. And then the second one should be about $0.25 if gas prices are back down, if they're still really high, I think I noticed today, I think it would have cost about $2 in ether. So just be aware of that. But once you do that, your account has been created and you can start trading on loop ring.
00:05:25.828 - 00:06:19.900, Speaker A: So for me, I'm going to go ahead and go here to the left hand panel where it says deposit, and I'm going to go ahead and deposit some die. So we'll put in 100 die. Now, like with any other DaP, you want to be mindful of these two different transactions. So if I scroll down here, it's asking permission for how much dai am I going to allow loop ring to move. This is something that happens in a lot of dapps. It's just part of enabling a better user experience. I prefer, though, to put in exactly what I'm willing to let them take right now, which is just 100 die.
00:06:19.900 - 00:07:12.540, Speaker A: So again, I would encourage most, unless for some reason, you know, you're going to deposit in the next few minutes, go ahead and just put in a custom spend limit of 100 or whatever amount of money you're going to put in. And then the other thing is, let's see how much in terms of the gas price I'm going to pay. So currently it's 20 gwe. Let's go here and check this out. All right, so yeah, 20 would get it done. I might just bump it up a little bit just to make sure the transaction goes through it. All right, we'll put that through.
00:07:12.540 - 00:08:02.432, Speaker A: All right, cool. So we'll be right back. Just going to wait for that transaction to settle and then I can put in my first trade here on loop ring. All right, so I'm back for the second transaction. So this is the transaction to actually execute, depositing the 100 die into my loop ring account. So I'm going to just change this to a higher gas price to make sure it goes through. And we are all set to go ahead.
00:08:02.432 - 00:08:33.708, Speaker A: So while I'm waiting for my dai to deposit, you'll notice that up in the center left, if you click on account, this is where I can see any of my pending deposits. So there we go. Yes. So I have 100 die. It's still confirming. And I can see the transaction hash if I want to check it out. All right, so my die deposit has confirmed.
00:08:33.708 - 00:08:59.356, Speaker A: So you can see I have 100 die here. That's because there were 30 block confirmations on the deposit transaction. If I ever do need to check that again, just click on account, click on deposits. And it would say confirming. In this case, it's already completed. So it says succeeded. So if we go back to the trading dashboard, I'm going to look for what I can possibly trade with my dai.
00:08:59.356 - 00:09:21.208, Speaker A: So I'm just going to search for Dai. I see that it's paired with ether and tether. So I'll choose ether in this case. And then the way that this order dashboard works is you can set limit orders. So here's the price. And I look over here and I can see that the price is 195.53 die per ether.
00:09:21.208 - 00:09:44.340, Speaker A: So let's say that I want to buy at 195.5 die per ether. And then I will just buy as much as possible. In this case, I could have used 50% of my 100 die and I end up here. By the way, this takes into account trading fees as well. So let's buy as much as possible. And there we go.
00:09:44.340 - 00:10:26.040, Speaker A: So we'll do a buy limit order of 0.5115 ether at 195.50 die or lower. So my order has been submitted, and that just means now that it's reflected up above that I wouldn't actually have any die remaining. And then if we go up to my orders here, I can see any of my pending orders. Now if I want to cancel this, all I have to do is click cancel. And now if I go back to the trading dashboard, I've got my original 100 die.
00:10:26.040 - 00:11:10.244, Speaker A: So aside from limit orders, it is possible to execute a market order. It's not super obvious here in the dashboard, but if you are going to place a buy order, if you just set the limit price above whatever is the market price, it will execute it immediately. That's been my experience at least, and I actually just did it a few minutes ago. So if you go here to orders, you can see here that I filled an order for 0.1 e at a price of 222 die per ETH. I paid 22.2 die for that.
00:11:10.244 - 00:11:43.672, Speaker A: And then here's the itty bitty tiny fee that I paid in ETH. And a reminder, the DFI dad code, that does not pay me any sort of referral or kickback. It is only there as a benefit to anyone who wants to use it. It gives you 0% on maker orders. And keep in mind, everyone gets that already. So there's nothing special about that, but just worth calling out. It's 0% fees when you place a maker order, and if you place a taker order, instead of paying 0.1%,
00:11:43.672 - 00:12:21.100, Speaker A: you pay 0.6%. So again, it was nice of the loop ring team. They took what referral fee I would have received, and I just said, just give it to whoever ends up using the code so that they benefit from it. And I don't have any sort of financial incentive tied into it. So if we were going to place, let's say, a sell order. So if I go here to sell, currently the price of ether is 219.51 in die.
00:12:21.100 - 00:12:50.310, Speaker A: Let's pretend that I want to sell 0.1 e and I'm going to place. The market price is going to be placed. I'm sorry, my limit price to sell will be placed below what is the market price. So I'll put it at 218. And so I'm going to get 21.8 die back.
00:12:50.310 - 00:13:51.156, Speaker A: And so if we hit that, all right, so my order has been submitted, and then you can see I immediately have that credit. So I went from about 77.8 die up to 99.6. And if we go back to my orders, if we go to fill history, there's my sell order. So you be the judge. I mean, what I just did feels like the type of, it feels like the way I place an order on a centralized exchange, it's just instant, you click it, and as long as the liquidity is there, it can execute it. If you consider the two orders that I just placed, let's see, I paid 0.6.
00:13:51.156 - 00:14:30.616, Speaker A: Okay, so in ETH, that was 0.6 times 219, let's say, is the die price. So I paid about $0.01 or one 100th of a die. So again, super small fractions of a cent compared to placing trades on a dex. So again, it looks and it feels just like a centralized exchange. I mean, this is how I at least used to use exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase.
00:14:30.616 - 00:15:03.154, Speaker A: All these exchanges, they have a very sort of intuitive experience to using this. And so it's nice because it's very familiar and it's easy to use. Okay, so I want to call out some of the drawbacks I've noticed in using loop ring. These are just things to be mindful of. None of these would prevent me from using loop ring. Just again, things that are good to be aware of. So first off, there is a minimum order size.
00:15:03.154 - 00:15:44.938, Speaker A: So you'll notice if you try to place an order less than 0.5 e, it just will warn you that there's a minimum order size. No big deal. But again, good to know that. Another thing is that you noticed earlier that I placed some market buy and sell orders. The interface here is not intuitive to me that you can actually do that, but you could actually argue that they've simplified the way that others call out the difference between a limit order and a stop loss and a market order whatever. At the end of the day, you can place market orders.
00:15:44.938 - 00:16:38.980, Speaker A: If you want to place a market buy order, all you need to do is look at whatever the price is and then place the limit price above that, so you're just willing to pay a little bit more. So in this case, I would pay instead of 219 61, I would pay like 219 80. And then if I wanted to do a sell market order, I would just place my sell just a little bit below whatever the market price. Is in order to get it to execute, depending also too, on how big your order size is. Let's see, the other thing is that it does cost something to withdraw your money, so it costs about 0.2 e for each withdrawal. Good to know that it's not something that scares me, because I'm mindful of the fact that when I placed two orders earlier, I actually paid $0.01
00:16:38.980 - 00:17:19.870, Speaker A: in total for the two of them. So I am truly paying fractions of a cent for each order that I place. And so this at $220 ETH is $0.43. So no big deal. And then there is withdrawals that take about five to 30 minutes. Just again, good to know that, because if you go to do a withdrawal, just don't get upset if it doesn't settle within a few minutes, it can take up to 30 minutes. And then lastly, I can't really dive into how safe the code is.
00:17:19.870 - 00:18:09.622, Speaker A: I know that loop ring has audits available, but just always be mindful of the fact that any of these tools or any of these defi apps that are built on Ethereum, there's always a risk to using them. And I think the risk I think we all think about is a smart contract bug. So just be cautious. It's just something that it's risk that I think you can never fully escape. There are some options to consider, like Nexus Mutual. You could check out Nexus mutual to see if you can get any coverage through them, and that would allow you then to be mindful of how much in terms of funds you have on loop ring, and then what sort of coverage or insurance you have against a smart contract bug with Nexus mutual. But other than that, I hope this is really helpful.
00:18:09.622 - 00:18:25.520, Speaker A: Again, I think loopring is a really exciting team to watch and it's a really interesting tool here in light of how high the gas price is right now on ethereum. So comment on Twitter at defi underscore dad, if you have any questions.
