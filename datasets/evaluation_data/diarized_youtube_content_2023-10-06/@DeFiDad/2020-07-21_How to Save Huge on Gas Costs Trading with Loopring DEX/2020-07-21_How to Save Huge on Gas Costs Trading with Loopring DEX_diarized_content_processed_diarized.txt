00:00:21.940 - 00:01:14.232, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. This is Defi dad, and this is going to be a short demonstration of how I use loopring to spot trade. And the reason I use loop ring is because with gas prices so high, this is one of the ways I'm able to get around that challenge. I pay a fraction of a cent on average for the gas for different trades on loopring. So you'll notice they've got all of the common assets that I would be trading on another exchange, like lend or link and ether and so on. Actually, they even have Ren bitcoin now, so you can get exposure to bitcoin. And so as I'm using this, you'll notice that I've got all the sort of familiar features of using a centralized exchange, except in this case, it's powered by a decentralized exchange.
00:01:14.232 - 00:01:40.950, Speaker A: So I've got ether, I've got tether, and if I'm going to buy some ether, all I need to do is set what is my limit buy price. Currently, ether is at 244 77. And let's see, folks are selling it around 245. So I'll just put in 245. So this punches through immediately. I'll buy as much as possible. And watch this.
00:01:40.950 - 00:02:04.030, Speaker A: There we go. That was it. The order has been submitted and the trade has gone through. So now if I go to orders, and if I look at fill history, there it is. I just bought 0.3271 ETH, and I don't know, obviously it was less than a second there. And what did I pay? Zero.
00:02:04.030 - 00:02:33.560, Speaker A: So I'm paying 4.8 cents. Keep in mind, this also incorporates the 0.6% taker fee. If you place maker orders on loop ring, you pay 0%. In terms of that fee, you would just be paying whatever is the gas there. So this mostly represents a taker fee on the 80.2
00:02:33.560 - 00:03:04.672, Speaker A: tether. I'm not actually sure if I paid any gas on this. Normally you will find that you're paying like a fraction of a cent, but in this case, I'm not even sure where the fee is. So it's so small in this case that it is negligible to a point that I'm not quite sure what I paid. So that's it. If you're interested to try this, go to loopring IO trade. And when you get there, you just have to connect to your metamask account.
00:03:04.672 - 00:03:22.424, Speaker A: But when you do it, it'll ask you if you have a code. Use DFI, Dad. D E f I d a D. There's no kickback or referral from me. It simply will save you money. It'll save you 40% on taker orders. Again, all of the kickback goes to you as customer.
00:03:22.424 - 00:03:32.500, Speaker A: I have no formal partnership with loopring. I just ask them to enable a reward that rewards customers and allows you to save as much as possible on trading.
