00:00:03.130 - 00:01:08.674, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching DeFi talks with Defi. Dad, thanks for joining us. It is Thursday, May 5, 2022. Today we're going to talk with the managing partner of the Rodman law group, my own lawyer, Dave Rodman. Dave has a legal expertise in blockchain crypto, and really all of the bleeding edge use cases that we talk about here, like DFI and NFTs. And so really, you know, in being a client and a friend of and talking about what he thinks, know, day and night as a lawyer, I was like, we got to have a conversation on a live stream and kind of let you share some of the ideas that are top of mind. So anyways, Dave, thanks for joining me.
00:01:08.674 - 00:01:09.618, Speaker A: How are you doing?
00:01:09.784 - 00:01:12.260, Speaker B: I'm doing very well. Thank you for having.
00:01:13.590 - 00:01:42.330, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So just a quick bit of background on Dave, and I'll let you kind of tell your story, Dave, of how you got into crypto and kind of a bit about the Rodman law group. But if you're interested to learn more about them, you can go here to therodmanlawgroup.com. And then if you want to follow them on Dave. Dave will occasionally join Twitter spaces and also share some insights there on Twitter. But anyways, Dave. Yeah.
00:01:42.330 - 00:01:53.700, Speaker A: Kind of tell the backstory to how did you ever get into crypto? I actually don't think I've ever heard, like, how long you've been in it. And then, of course, what led us to today.
00:01:54.070 - 00:02:42.830, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's a great story. So our mutual friend Ben reached out to me at one point. Our firm was primarily a cannabis law firm. Late 2016, Ben reached out and asked if I knew what an ICO was, and at the time, I didn't. And he explained it at a very high level, and at the time, and still there's a difficulty in getting funding for the cannabis space. So immediately I thought, oh, wow, this could be used to help some of my cannabis clients. So I dove in immediately and started to kind of digitally follow Ben around as he kind of navigated the early days because he's in Thailand and I was in Colorado.
00:02:42.830 - 00:03:16.310, Speaker B: And then there was one moment where I have a training as a securities mean. We used to work for Merrill lynch. That was my background. And I just sort of floated to Ben and his team. Have you guys heard about the howie test? And they hadn't, and then I explained it, and then a couple days later, there was an article in hacker noon about the howie test. And so my credibility shot way up. It became outside general counsel for his first project, and have been in the space ever since it slowed down during the crypto winter.
00:03:16.310 - 00:03:35.760, Speaker B: But as of early last year, it flipped cannabis as our biggest practice area. And it's basically all that I do with my time professionally with clients such as yourself, and also personally, because I turned into an absolute Defi dgen and can't get enough.
00:03:36.530 - 00:04:39.720, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, it speaks to part of the reason I was able to even start working with you is it helps when your lawyer or your accountant, whoever you're working with, is genuinely using crypto, or in this case, defi daily. So, Dave, I'll let you sort of lead the rest of this conversation. I know there's a lot that you think about in terms of the clients that you represent, and as a power user of DeFi and NFTs. So I guess, what are some of the risks that are top of mind for you? And I'd love to even try to go deeper with what's become clear over the last few years, because I feel like we're always talking about gray zones in terms of law or even accounting with crypto, but we've come a long way in the last few years. So, yeah. Would love to share any of the risks that are top of mind for you.
00:04:40.570 - 00:05:51.426, Speaker B: Sure. So I think that the easiest way to sum that up is you get a class of developer and tech institutionalist that comes into crypto with the web two conception of move fast and break stuff. And that worked very well for web two, even in some of the more regulated areas, like transportation, which uber blew out of the water, faced a lot of scrutiny, but ultimately was successful. So there's that kind of mindset. And what people don't realize is that the inherent financial component of web3 puts you in probably the most regulated area in the United States, other than nuclear and governmental secret stuff. And that move fast and break stuff thing, it works in the very short term, and we see the slow and plotting but never ceasing regulatory monster following these projects. And in just 2021, we started to see some closure from some of the scams, the actual scams that happened in 2016, 2017.
00:05:51.426 - 00:06:45.582, Speaker B: And so my job is kind of to be an educated chicken little for my clients, yelling that the sky is falling and they don't believe me necessarily right away. And I can point to these things that have slowly started to happen and say, we're talking about an immutable ledger. Things that happen now will be on the ledger forever. And when the regulatory monster catch ups to everybody in two to five years, it's really important that you have done things in the right way, because the statute of limitations on some of these things is 14 years at this point. So there's this real long tail that people don't think about because they don't see it. They don't see the everyday enforcement. And there's very little stuff that we can point to as lawyers as far as like, actual settled case law.
00:06:45.582 - 00:08:06.870, Speaker B: There's some regulatory opinions and some memos that the SEC has written and some other stuff. And there are certain countries that have different, more nuanced views or codified view of these things. So that's my goal, is to think about how the regulatory institutions have interpreted traditional markets, traditional products, see what the clients are developing in the immediate moment, and then kind of forecast out how those two will meet someday and see what we can do now to insulate them. Because eventually, I always tell people, short term, no pain, long term, moderate to slight pain, because hopefully the laws will have changed. But in the midterm, where you are having archaic laws with judges who are in their 60s or 70s interpreting that law, that's the max pain. And I think that's somewhere two and a half to three to maybe six years from now, that window is where we're going to see the long arm of the law catch up with some of these more risk tolerant protocols.
00:08:07.710 - 00:08:39.314, Speaker A: Okay, so why don't we talk then a bit about what are those top risks that you think, I want to say that more need to understand or that more should at least be aware of? We won't be able to go super deep with all of them, but it's more like, these are top risks that you think about in relation to dows, Defi NFTs, anything you can share there that people should be digging into more?
00:08:39.512 - 00:09:24.250, Speaker B: Yeah, well, everybody knows that we should be worried about securities, and I can get to that in a second. But if you really wanted the top single most thing that I think is most important to consider, it's actually, if you're an American, it's the bank Secrecy act and AML KYC considerations, because America is coming for you on that. I mean, uniswap, God knows I love them. But the amount of value that is transacted daily without being able to prove that the person on the other side of the trade is not a politically exposed person or in a sanctioned country, that is a massive risk. And we're talking about the Patriot act at that point. So it's not, oh, we're going to have a civil enforcement action with the SEC because someone sold securities. It's holy shit.
00:09:24.250 - 00:09:43.480, Speaker B: They're going to claim that this is terrorism funding. And of course it's not. North Korea probably makes a little bit out of it, but in reality it's us. It's the DGens having access to capital for the first time and getting to explore the market. But that's how the regulators are going to frame it. No question. That will be how I frame it.
00:09:43.850 - 00:10:10.302, Speaker A: By the way, as one thing I forgot to mention earlier as we talk about this. So we are commenting on this, we're having a discussion. None of this should be interpreted as legal advice, so just enjoy the conversation. But again, please don't use this as legal advice. If anything, you can get in touch with Dave and the Rodman law group afterwards if you seek legal advice. But anyways, Dave, sorry, keep going.
00:10:10.436 - 00:10:12.640, Speaker B: No, thank you. I completely forgot to say.
00:10:14.050 - 00:10:18.194, Speaker A: Just, it just blew over my head. I was like, oh boy, here we are.
00:10:18.392 - 00:10:37.574, Speaker B: Yeah, this is educational. This is scene setting. But talk to a lawyer, for sure. Talk to a lawyer who knows what they're doing after that. Controlling for the transfer of value. And there's thresholds, they're very low. Everybody's breaking them after that.
00:10:37.574 - 00:11:12.354, Speaker B: It's obviously securities law concerns. Basically doing stuff out of the US is a no no. We don't let any of our clients use the US to issue tokens. And if you want, we can go into that. But I think the other up and coming risk is the SEC has clearly said that they're investigating NFT projects for securities violations. Same sort of thing. Whether you call it an ICO or an NFT drop, whether it's fungible or non fungible, if it looks like a security, acts like security, raises money like a security, that's a security.
00:11:12.354 - 00:11:48.526, Speaker B: So just because it's non fungible doesn't give you the green light to just raise money. So when I talk to people who are doing NFT raises, it's no, you're not doing NFT raises, you're doing an NFT sale. Your sale is a good, you're paying money on that as though you have sold a good. You're paying your taxes because when you raise money, you raise investment capital. They don't get taxed on that. But if you drop a successful NFT project, be prepared to pay federal taxes if you do it in the United States. So that's sort of derivation on the securities thing.
00:11:48.526 - 00:12:46.562, Speaker B: And I think the other massive one that we're getting a ton of calls about and really trying to help people think about the risks is Daos the thing about DAOs is that as most people conceive of them, this sort of Internet based, entityless organization in which people pool money together to do various things, there's a lot of real risk there. And by real risk, I mean like lose your house type risk. I've said this a couple of times in different venues, but without a wrapper, a corporate wrapper around your dao, it's just a group of people coming together to do a business purpose, whatever that is. The law says that's a general partnership. And so there's no corporate firewall between Defi dad and Dave Rodman. And if we have a DAO together, it's just us. And so if someone has a valid complaint and a judge agrees, then that judgment is against us, not a company.
00:12:46.562 - 00:13:51.800, Speaker B: And so our house is at risk, our cars are at risk, all of our equities and crypto holding is at risk that could be liquidated to satisfy that judgment. And if I go rogue and cause some issue, you could be the sole person that gets sued, and then it's on you to collect your percentage from me. That's the way partnerships work. So when you think about these 10,000 person, 20,000 person dows, where many of them may not be identifiable, but there are a couple of big ones that might have real exposure as a person in the United States or the UK or wherever, that person could be responsible for the entire DAO's obligation. And then if you can't identify your other Dow members, how are you going to make yourself whole? So that's the primary risk with Dao. So then I tell people that, and they immediately say, okay, well then I'll just throw a corporate wrapper around it. And it's, eh, not exactly that easy.
00:13:51.800 - 00:14:50.106, Speaker B: Because if you do that in the United States, whether you throw a C Corp around it or an LLC around it, you then run into these very clear federal levels of participation. So most dows that I'm aware of are venture in nature, at least for the moment. So there's a very clear 99 person cap. If you go above that, you enter into mutual fund territory, and that's incredibly regulated. And let's say it's a non investment type purpose, something like rate guild, where it's marketing sort of focused, anything that's not venture. There's two other important caps. And the first one is 499, which if there's a single non accredited investor, someone who's a participant, who is not an accredited investor, whether or not they actually gave capital, it's just what they are as a person, then the threshold of participants is 499.
00:14:50.106 - 00:15:29.718, Speaker B: If you go above that, you have public company reporting requirements, just like Facebook and Apple. And then if you weed out your participants, they're all accredited investors, that number rises to 1999. So in the real world, these numbers, small businesses, they'd ever come close. Small investment funds, small businesses, you don't really ever have equity holders that are in that big a number. And when you do, it does make sense to have reporting requirements. But in the Dow space, you can get tens of thousands of people as participants and pool millions of dollars in a couple of weeks. That hasn't happened before.
00:15:29.718 - 00:16:11.010, Speaker B: That velocity hasn't happened before. So you're running into these things where these participant caps hit, and if you violate them, you violate the 1940 act. And that is not an act you want to violate. So currently, our mantra here is similar to the issuance, is you can't do it in the United States, you have to do it offshore. You have to make use of these very particular entities that work really well for this. And there's some friction there. And the people who are thinking long term, they absolutely accept that friction in exchange for the protections that they are afforded.
00:16:11.990 - 00:16:51.390, Speaker A: Okay, so there's a few things there I just want to recap on. So we had partnership risks within a, is, let's give a simple example. Is pretend there's a DAO. It does whatever. It's some sort of Defi related protocol. Let's pretend everyone lives outside of the United States. And then this DAO comes under the microscope of us regulators, and they believe that they've broken some law, know, whatever, not operated within the regulations required.
00:16:51.390 - 00:17:10.086, Speaker A: There is this one person, then that person could be held accountable who's in the United States for that person basically could be on the hook for all of everything that they would go after with that dow. That's scary. That's definitely something I've never thought about or talked with you about.
00:17:10.268 - 00:18:18.140, Speaker B: And it's not just the regulatory risk. Like, let's say that there's that one person in the United States, but then the DAO somehow interacts with another person in the United States, and that person has a loss, a damage, they've caused some sort of harm to that person, whether or not it's a valid, just that person believes it. That person can sue the Dow, the partnership, but they can also sue that one known american person. So it's not even, I tell people, yeah, regulatory risk is number one, but like a very close second is civil liability risk. Where the plaintiff spar is going to get a hold of these things and start to aggregate class action lawsuits, to use it as a club against the other general partners. And it haven't seen it happen yet, but the plaintiffs bar is not exactly known for being the most tech savvy group out there. So I predict a lag here, but it will catch up and there will be instances of this, I guarantee it.
00:18:18.590 - 00:18:59.078, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. We don't need to, I think, go further with tokens as a security. I think that's a topic at least that it's probably the most familiar within the crypto community, just because 2017, 2016 and 2018 were just years where all these different ICOs were launched. And so, yeah, some of that is a little more familiar. But nfts as a security, can you just recap that once more? Let's pretend I launch a collection of 100 NFTs. They're all one of ones, and that's it.
00:18:59.078 - 00:19:22.550, Speaker A: You mint it for, let's say, 0.1 e, and I've sold them to you, and maybe they're used for gated access to a discord community, but that's it. They're intended as a one of one piece of art. Is that at risk of being interpreted as a security, or is that on the safer end of the spectrum?
00:19:22.730 - 00:20:22.222, Speaker B: Almost certainly not. There's two angles to this that need to be paid attention to. One is how the project recognizes the revenue. As I said earlier, it should be revenue, it should not be investment income, it should be taxed, you should pay. If it's a C Corp 21% federal income tax on the sale of goods, on the other side is how is it marketed, how does the buyer get interested in it? And that is often overlooked. So if it's something like BYC, which had no promises to people when it dropped, and then subsequently had all this money and has been rewarding their members, that was not an inducement for people to buy into the project originally. However, you see these other projects that have sprung up, seeing the success of that and wanting that community, and so they have to be very careful about how they're inducing their buyers.
00:20:22.222 - 00:21:11.620, Speaker B: So they may want to be able to do the same things that projects like BYC do, but because they haven't launched yet, or because they haven't gained the traction, if they start to offer those same things, but as a future promise, well, then we have to kind of pause and say, well, what's being promised here? Does that become a security? And if it's like, it's token gated access to a discord. No, that's not a security. But if you get a subsequent NFT or you get. There's plenty of platforms that are literally calling it passive income. Hold this NFT and get passive income. That's a security. But then there's like a middle ground where it's like, okay, you get one free NFT, or you get two free NFTs, or you get.
00:21:11.620 - 00:21:36.540, Speaker B: There's a whole subgenre of this, of where you have raffles, and that implicates gaming law, which is like state by state in the United States and very wonky. It's not a solution. People come to me all the time, oh, we're going to do raffles. We're not promising any guarantee. It's like, all right, well, maybe that's a security. We can set that aside because it's not the most pressing thing. It's like you've got to consider what the gaming laws are in the state that you're located in and the state everybody else is located in.
00:21:36.540 - 00:21:47.470, Speaker B: So it's that secondary accumulation of value and how you are talking to your potential purchasers that becomes very dispositive.
00:21:49.650 - 00:22:43.700, Speaker A: Okay. Because I'm actually realizing we should probably have this conversation more often because there's so much depth to this that I think more people need to learn about. Why don't we try to wrap up this very brief starter conversation today with where can one start to get more educated on these topics, knowing that still they're going to need to work with a lawyer who specializes in this, like someone like yourself? Like I do. And then second, is there any recommendations of how to, I guess, better support the advancement of thinking around crypto asset based regulation? Basically, where do we start learning? And then how can we get involved in a positive way?
00:22:45.670 - 00:22:48.370, Speaker B: Let me start with number two, because that's, I think, easier.
00:22:48.870 - 00:22:50.180, Speaker A: Go to law school.
00:22:51.590 - 00:23:33.418, Speaker B: Sure. We actually hired an intern because he saw a picture of our real life fluff that we have in the office and asked for a job. So definitely go to law school if you're interested. But I think that crypto users are passionate, and crypto users believe, and I think that if you can aim that belief at your representatives. I know that sounds archaic and old, but emails and letters, they do matter. So you should be reaching out to your congressman, reaching out to your senator, and tell them that we don't want brain drain. We don't want this to go all have to go offshore forever.
00:23:33.418 - 00:24:08.858, Speaker B: We want it to be recognized as something novel, and we need to treat it correctly, because if we don't, that's never going to happen. There's no incentive for elected officials or the regulators that to listen to us unless we make ourselves heard and to vote. So that's like the only real long term solution. Honestly, the first question is a little bit harder. Where do you go to learn? I wish I had more time to draft more blogs on this stuff. We've got a couple of pieces up on our website. There's a couple of attorneys in the space.
00:24:08.858 - 00:24:41.750, Speaker B: I mean, Jake is just phenomenal. Follow him on Twitter. He's just constantly dropping knowledge bombs. But I think the point is there's not a lot. There isn't a lot of settled case law, so there isn't a lot of lawyers that can opine on it. And frankly, as big as we think it is in the space, it's still tiny. So there isn't that sort of widespread adoption of professionals who can say that they practice in the space the way they might just in regular fintech or in finance.
00:24:41.750 - 00:25:15.470, Speaker B: So there's not a lot is what I'm getting at. Find a good lawyer. Doesn't have to be me or my firm, but someone who's got a track record in the space, who understands the risks and isn't just somebody who threw up. Oh, yeah, we do crypto law in 2020 during D five summer. Make sure that that person has the credentials. It'll be the single most important expenditure a small project or any project can make. And then, obviously, the second is a crypto savvy accountant.
00:25:15.470 - 00:26:00.800, Speaker B: But the structuring, the legal guidelines can save you. It literally can save you prison. That is ultimately the end of the day, what we're talking here in some of these cases, but at least in the short term, can help you make some smarter decisions for regulatory enforcement in the form of fines or lawsuits, in the form of civil litigation. We're talking about partnerships. The legal mind is so key here because you can go so fast and so far, so quickly in this space, and then you can have this indelible record of what you've done, and you can get yourself in a lot of trouble without even really meaning to. It can happen really quickly.
00:26:01.650 - 00:26:55.626, Speaker A: You know what I'm thinking we should do, Dave? Once a month, we should have you on, and we should just talk about one or two topics related to recent events. I selfishly feel like I would benefit the most from that, but, yeah, let's talk about continuing this in the future. I thought I was prepared today, but every time I talk with you, I just learned so much more. I think as you pointed out, too, it's really important that you're curious and want to learn more about the space, especially if you see yourself spending a lifetime working in the crypto space. So, dude, just thanks so much for your time. This was awesome. That beyond my expectations and reminder to everyone, they can follow you and your team at robin Law on Twitter.
00:26:55.626 - 00:27:04.580, Speaker A: They can learn more about your team@therobinlawgroup.com. So you can get in touch with Dave there. Dave, anything else to share before we go?
00:27:05.210 - 00:27:29.334, Speaker B: There's a slightly less filtered, slightly less posted Twitter. It's my personal one. It's Daverodman e or at Daverodman seven. They used to be like one in the same, and I realized I needed to separate out Dave from corporate Dave. So the slightly more, slightly less filtered is my personal one, but the important one is the at Rodman law.
00:27:29.532 - 00:27:49.998, Speaker A: Absolutely. And one last reminder, again, none of this is legal advice, but I hope it's interesting and I hope it's educational and informational. So, hey, we'll be back hopefully next week with another interview. And Dave, thanks so much for your time. I'm going to end the broadcast here. And everyone have a great day. Thanks so much.
00:27:50.164 - 00:27:51.020, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, man.
