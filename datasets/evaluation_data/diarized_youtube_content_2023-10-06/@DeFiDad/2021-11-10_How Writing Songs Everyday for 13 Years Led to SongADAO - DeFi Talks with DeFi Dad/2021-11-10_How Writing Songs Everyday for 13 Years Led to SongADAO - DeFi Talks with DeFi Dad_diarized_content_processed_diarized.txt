00:00:04.810 - 00:00:37.080, Speaker A: All right. Hey, everyone, it's Tuesday, November 9, 2021. This is DFI talks with DFI dad, I am going to be, I'm joined here today by Jonathan Mann, who is known as song a day man on Twitter. Jonathan is, I mean, has a remarkable story. Story. He has been writing songs every day for 13 years. And I actually stumbled upon his work because he's also a beloved member of the Ethereum community.
00:00:37.080 - 00:01:14.866, Speaker A: He's been a notable early adopter of everything from Ens to NFTs and because of the way he cleverly writes catchy songs that again, are all his own and he produces them daily. It's a really telling way to onboard folks, to our community. And so I've really been sort of like inspired by the work that he does and just admired what he stood for. So, Jonathan, welcome to the show. How are you doing? Thanks for joining me.
00:01:14.968 - 00:01:16.680, Speaker B: I'm doing good, thank you.
00:01:17.050 - 00:02:28.426, Speaker A: Yeah, so I've actually been gushing at him for about 15 minutes. For 15 minutes here, I've just been like, dude, how do you do it? So we're going to talk about your journey, writing songs every day. There's actually a tangential sort of story to this too. So if anyone caught up with the Beeple hype earlier in the year and I had the chance to interview Beeple about the fact that he had been producing a piece of art every day for something like 13 plus years, I like weeks later stumble upon Jonathan and I'm like, there are two crazy people in this world who are doing this. And so similar to the Beeple story, Jonathan has again created all these incredible songs. I mean, it's something that I don't think I can do justice to them by playing them, like, just because of the audio quality that I have. But what I would recommend is everybody go to, I'm going to share my screen here.
00:02:28.426 - 00:03:13.702, Speaker A: Everybody should go to Twitter. Look up song a day man with two ends at the end. I mean, he just wrote a song about the Ethereum name service ens, so just really catchy. Like, they're songs that when you listen to them, I can say as a music fan, as someone who goes to concerts every few months, I've always been blown away by the fact that I actually enjoy the songs. But then he's just written, I mean, jonathan, you wrote that one song. Gosh, what is the name of it? It was with Peter McCormick. You were mocking Peter McCormick's like right click and save an NFT.
00:03:13.846 - 00:03:15.322, Speaker B: Yeah, right click, save as.
00:03:15.376 - 00:03:22.678, Speaker A: Yeah, right click, save as. You did it with Kevin from Gitcoin and a bunch of other folks, all.
00:03:22.704 - 00:03:36.560, Speaker B: Kinds of ETH people. I got to appear and dance in the right click save as video. I made up a little dance for them all to do. Right click save as. I am very smart. Yeah. Yes.
00:03:38.310 - 00:03:40.114, Speaker A: Actually, I'll try to find it too.
00:03:40.152 - 00:04:04.278, Speaker B: While we're. There's a whole genre actually of sort of NfT hater songs. There's the right click save as song. There's NFTs are a pyramid scheme. There's nFts are dead. In May. In May, people were sort of celebrating the death of NFTs or like NFTs are dead.
00:04:04.278 - 00:04:10.380, Speaker B: So there's an NFTs are dead song, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah.
00:04:10.690 - 00:04:40.680, Speaker A: You know what I'll do? Let's share my screen one more time here. I am going to try to play this. Let's see whatever quality it comes out as. We'll just play just a few, like maybe 1015 seconds of it. And anyways, everyone, if you go to again, song a day man on Twitter, I'll share this out on Twitter as well. But here we go. I'm going to mute myself just for a few moments because it'll make the audio quality better.
00:04:40.680 - 00:04:53.976, Speaker A: Right click save as I am very smart. Ha. Got your ass. Now I own your art.
00:04:54.158 - 00:04:57.850, Speaker B: Studies show that you feel different moment you own something.
00:04:58.220 - 00:05:00.488, Speaker A: That's why these NFPs are just a.
00:05:00.494 - 00:05:05.500, Speaker B: Better digital object, infinitely replicate.
00:05:08.560 - 00:05:29.780, Speaker A: I think if anyone is able to watch the video and see my face while I'm watching it, I'm just grinning like ear to ear every time I listen to these. And I want to clarify this video in particular. I listened to this like a dozen times that day. It's so catchy. Right click save as I am very smart.
00:05:30.440 - 00:06:04.864, Speaker B: The whole bridge of that song too is sort of like a trying to reach out, actually. There's so much hate that comes in this direction and I feel like so much of it is misdirected. And the bridge of that song is like, come put aside whatever notions that you have and come actually talk to me about. Would just. I'm so excited by want, really want to share this with. That's like, that's the message.
00:06:04.982 - 00:06:34.116, Speaker A: It's just so cool. Jonathan, maybe you could then start by telling us a little bit more about how did you get started? How did you get started just writing a song every day? I mean, when did it no longer this, like, hey, I've written a song every day. I guess I'll just keep going this is my life mission, and I'm going to commit to this incredibly time consuming habit.
00:06:34.308 - 00:07:10.950, Speaker B: So I started on January 1 of 2009, nearly 13 years ago now, and I was only aiming to do a month. I was only aiming to do 31 days in January. And then that was sort of going well. And then I aimed for like a whole year. So I did all of 2009. And then at that point is when I sort of just made it indefinite. Because once you cross, at least for me, once I cross that year threshold, at that point it's like, okay, well, now I'm in year two.
00:07:10.950 - 00:07:31.770, Speaker B: And the times that sort of make sense to stop just from an OCD level of like, okay, like, a month is a thing, a year is a thing. Two years, that's not a thing. So then over time, it just sort of became indefinite. And here I am.
00:07:32.400 - 00:08:36.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm wondering, how do you do it then, when you're traveling? Maybe you can talk me through the creative process day to day. Because one of the things is, since I've watched videos of yours from year one to now, I'm looking at it and it's like a really cool way to have sort of documented, I'm sure, your life and just shit. You were thinking over the past 13 years, obviously, I think based on everything I had seen, you've become a father over those years, which to me, not just being like a fellow Defi dad and a dad, it really resonated because I know how hard it is just to do work day to day, but let alone to deliver a novel, creative piece of music is just, again, mind blowing to me. But, yeah, how do you approach day to day? How do you just continue to keep this routine up?
00:08:38.900 - 00:09:47.430, Speaker B: So there's a lot of questions in there. The basic thing that I always say, and this is true, it's just a truism that I found with this, is that in order? And I think beeple actually says the same thing. In order to sort of do it every day, you have to let go of any expectation that it's going to be good. Know, the truth of the matter is the ones that you'll find that I share on, like, are ones that are either topical or sometimes I'll just share ones that I think are particularly good. But I'm not going to go out of my way on Twitter to share the shitty ones, although they all get posted to YouTube and so they all are public, but I'm not going to go out of my way to promote the ones. But at the same time, the other thing that I've learned. So that's like, the bottom line is that letting go of any expectation that the song on a given day is going to be any good at all.
00:09:47.430 - 00:09:59.272, Speaker B: And that's how I do it when I'm traveling, too. I don't know. I'll share my screen really quick. Wait, I have to.
00:09:59.406 - 00:10:04.676, Speaker A: Oh, it's okay. Yeah, go ahead and click the share button and then I'll make it visible.
00:10:04.868 - 00:10:39.456, Speaker B: Yeah. I was just going to say, like, oh, no, I can't do it. I'm on a new computer and I have to approve it and everything. Anyway, I was going to show you my spreadsheet that I have, which is an insane accounting of every single song. And you can see on days that I travel, for instance, I'm in a hotel room or something and I'm just playing my ukulele and making up a song. It's not rocket science, obviously. It's just a big part of it is like, I'm just going to sit down every single day and make a song.
00:10:39.456 - 00:11:09.890, Speaker B: And sometimes it's going to be good and sometimes it's going to be bad. And the other thing is that oftentimes I realize that I'm not the best judge of what's a good and bad song. So even if I think a song is not great, someone on YouTube might comment that they really enjoyed that. Like, it's really just letting go of any expectation that the thing that you're going to create has to be good.
00:11:10.580 - 00:11:35.610, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't want to connect dots where they shouldn't be connected here, but part of the way that I've tried to approach my YouTube channel is I've tried to just stick to covering what I think is interesting. And in many cases, what I don't think is being covered elsewhere. And it's no sort of like, disrespect to others on YouTube, but.
00:11:38.780 - 00:11:43.980, Speaker B: You have to follow your own. What you think is the most.
00:11:44.050 - 00:11:52.908, Speaker A: Yeah, well, there's a formula that everyone follows. You make like a 15 minutes video. You do it five days a week at least.
00:11:52.994 - 00:11:53.340, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:53.410 - 00:12:11.520, Speaker A: And then you make these very obnoxious cover photos where the person is like. And they've got big letters, basically saying, here's how you get rich. And I just cannot go that path. It doesn't feel very genuine.
00:12:11.600 - 00:12:12.230, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:12:14.120 - 00:12:38.476, Speaker A: This is a good example where I'm like, this is a really inspiring story to me, and I would rather sort of talk about this, even though it might get 100 views, maybe eventually some of the tutorials I'll do will get like 20,000, 30,000 views. But I think, for me, I think it's about trying to be objective and curate what I think is cool.
00:12:38.578 - 00:13:17.784, Speaker B: It's such a challenge. I mean, what you're talking about is you're talking about whether you're going to play by the rules of the algorithm is essentially what you're talking about, you know? And. And I. I've struggled with that the entire time of song a day. For instance, I know that my topical songs are the ones that usually get the most views, right. If I write a song about something that happened today in politics or in other news or in tech or anything, those are the ones that will always just get more views. Just like you.
00:13:17.784 - 00:14:37.812, Speaker B: I know that if I were to make a video every single day that was about something topical, and I photoshop a really dumb screenshot every day. And the funny thing about that is people who do do those things would say, well, we don't like it either. But it's like, do you want your shit to be seen or not? Is like that argument. And I'm like, yeah, I do, but I'm like, fuck Google. You know what mean? Like, just fuck, you know? That's like a huge part of what I think dows and NFTs, potentially, they're not like a cure all and they're not like a panacea, but they have some interesting applications for ways for people to break out of needing to play by these large companies. Rules that they just sort of make up on a whim. And sometimes, as we've seen with Facebook or YouTube, the rules that they create can actually be harmful to society because they optimize for the most anger inducing content that creates these rabbit holes that people become suddenly QAnon people.
00:14:37.812 - 00:15:08.990, Speaker B: And then you don't know what happened, right? It's like, yeah, so fuck that noise. At the end of the day, I've never wanted to participate in that. I want to share my music with people, but I'm like, I've always been jaded and saddened by the things that I would have to do in order to. Not that I'm like some kind of pure snowflake or anything, but there's just certain things I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to do that.
00:15:09.440 - 00:15:22.930, Speaker A: No, I get it yesterday without naming names, or I can't name names because they break some sort of confidentiality agreement, but I got to speak with.
00:15:24.900 - 00:15:25.360, Speaker B: Top.
00:15:25.430 - 00:16:08.320, Speaker A: Ten or top 100 DJ in the world. It's like a household name that folks would recognize. And he or she was interested in, they're interested in investing in DFI, NFTs, web three and so on. But really they were trying to wrap their head around what it is. They're totally new to crypto. And we were talking at the time about, it's really about a rising tide lifts all boats mentality, that when you think about what is Spotify or all these different sort of centralized services, I'm not painting them as evil. I'm just saying that they do what they're supposed to do.
00:16:08.320 - 00:17:32.328, Speaker A: They serve a very small group of people's interests. Whereas when you use web three software, what you're doing is you're cutting out the middlemen, and in many cases you're rewarding or issuing a token which normally has some utility to using it, but also clearly represents everyone's interest in that thing, that project, that software, that protocol. And so if you think about all the different softwares or just creators that you've ever believed in, if you could have something that represents upside in them, why wouldn't you want that? And for most of our lives, whether it's like a video game, whether it's a musician, whether it's a software, many of us have used these things for free. We've evangelized them to friends and said, you got to listen to this band. I love this band. What if you could hold a token in that band and actually benefit from the upside? And that's really what we're building here. And that's where, coming back to your story, you're creating music all these years, and then when do you discover crypto? It's around like 2017 or so, right?
00:17:32.414 - 00:18:01.392, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is like a perfect segue into song a dow. This is exactly what I'm trying to. My, my crypto story is very, I, to a certain extent, especially with artists, I feel like you hear one crypto story, you've heard them all. But I was at a conference. I saw a gentleman called Ethan Buckman speak. He's one of the guys who made cosmos the cosmos chain.
00:18:01.392 - 00:18:49.700, Speaker B: He's a great speaker, great educator, lovely human. And there was something about his talk that, I mean, he played a song which I really enjoyed, and it was called Scam Train. It was right around the time of Ico boom. And so he did a song called Scam Train, which I really loved, but he also just has a way of explaining blockchain that I think is beautiful and really helped me understand. And actually, the first connection I made was, like, with really understanding proof of work for the first time we're wrapping my head around it. For the first time, I was started to think about how song a day represents a proof of work. And this stuff just started percolating in my brain.
00:18:49.700 - 00:19:34.508, Speaker B: And I reached out on Twitter. I said, does anyone? In fact, I tweeted out the tweet last night. There was this tweet from September 2017, hey, anybody know anything about blockchain? Like, I have an idea for a project involving saga day. And a friend of mine reached out, Boris, and he sent me some ETH, and he set me up in Metamask, did the whole thing, and I bought a cryptopunk, and that was the end. As soon as I wrapped my head around cryptopunks, I immediately saw that I wanted to do something similar with song a day. Now, it's very commonplace. What we call PFP projects are everywhere.
00:19:34.508 - 00:20:22.792, Speaker B: But that was sort of what I realized in 2017 when I saw cryptopunks was like, I just want to take what they did and apply it directly to song a day. And then as I got deeper and deeper and deeper in understanding and meeting people and speaking, and I started to discover about dows and how that could work. And then there was really two projects that popped up that sort of brought everything all together for me. The main project that was sort of the main inspiration for where I'm taking song a dow. Because before, I had a lot of friends who were in Dows, even, like, 2018, 2019, who are like, oh, you should do a dow for song a day. And I'm like, yeah, maybe. Or people would always say, you should do a social token.
00:20:22.792 - 00:21:01.192, Speaker B: I'm like, yeah, maybe. But why? What would be the thing? The thing for me that ended up being, like, the part that really got me excited, just like cryptopunks did with NFTs. What got me really excited about Daos or how it might apply to me was this project called the song that owns itself, where they've created a dao just for a single song. And the Dao is a legal entity in their case, it's an LLC in Wyoming. And the dow owns the song. And I started talking to them, and I'm like, oh. Because it's a legal entity.
00:21:01.192 - 00:21:52.270, Speaker B: It can legally own the song. It legally owns the copyright to the song. And that was just like, okay, this is something totally different, because from the very beginning of song a day Nft, way back in the day, you would explain the idea of a song nft to people, and they'd be like, that's really cool. Does it come with, like, do I get the rights to the song? Which is like. That's not a question. It's hard to explain. Buts which rights are you talking about? Do you mean royalties? Do you mean the right to make a remix? What do you mean? And all that can be very complicated, and especially royalties can be complicated because off chain royalties are extremely byzantine and complicated and crazy.
00:21:52.270 - 00:23:10.516, Speaker B: But with this Dow model, I've just transferred all of my copyright to all of my songs to the Dow. And now the royalties from those songs belong not to me anymore, but they belong to the Dow, which is so exciting to me that as an innovation, as an idea, is like I was saying to you, it's literally the last thing I think about every night before I'm going to bed. I'm just like, my mind is just, like, racing about this constantly. So that's the basic idea behind Songadao, sort of to go back. What you were saying is know, rather than there being a token that you get, which obviously comes with all kinds of securities concerns, and who knows what Gary Gensler is going to do about tokens and shit. But the model that we've adopted in Songadao is a model of a co op, and a co op is a legal entity in which members of the co op, if you are a member of a co op, you are legally allowed to share in the surplus of that co op's treasury, as it were. That is just a legal thing that can happen.
00:23:10.516 - 00:24:10.116, Speaker B: And so if you're in the Dow and you're a full member, and there's a few legal things that we have to do to get you be a member, not only do you own, do you co own all of the rights to song a day, meaning collectively, we can all decide what to do with every single song in the song a day catalog. In addition to that, all of the money from the royalties for those songs flows directly into the treasury of the Dow. All of the money from the songs that I'm going to be writing every day and auctioning every day, which is going to happen sometime late December, early January, all of that money is going to go into the Dow. And as a member, you control the treasury. We all vote on how we want to deploy that money. And if you work on behalf of the Dow, if there's things that you do to help the music get heard in ways big and small, you can get paid. You can legally share in the upside of the Dow.
00:24:10.116 - 00:24:23.470, Speaker B: The more the Dow makes, the more we all make, including me, which is just crazy. I'm ridiculously excited about it. It's all I want to talk.
00:24:24.180 - 00:24:33.596, Speaker A: So if we talk about all of your music over the last 13 years, you transfer ownership of that or you have transferred ownership?
00:24:33.628 - 00:24:52.584, Speaker B: Not yet. We're working on the legal. So first we established the Dow as a legal entity, and then now the step that I'm working with my entertainment lawyer and my two Dow lawyers, we're all working together to try to put that into place. Yeah, but that's going to happen over the next couple of weeks.
00:24:52.702 - 00:25:15.904, Speaker A: It looks like actually what I probably should do is take a step back a moment for the last 13 years without going into anything too private. Can you share any bits about just how you've made a living? Obviously writing songs every day. Are you producing songs for companies as well or how does that work?
00:25:16.022 - 00:25:44.024, Speaker B: Yeah, it's changed, right. For the first few years of song a day, we're talking 2009, 2010, I was 26, 27 years old. Right? I'm a young guy. I was making my living entering video contests online. That's how I made my living in those years. I was making a song a day anyway. And I would go to onlinevideocontest.com,
00:25:44.024 - 00:26:36.600, Speaker B: which is a real website, and I would enter like twelve contests in twelve days and I would win one or two of them and that would literally be my income for that month. I would win like a $2,000.01, I would win like a $5,000.01 and there you go. That's enough for a 26 year old to live on easily. Slowly, I started getting sort of more commission work from companies early on Groupon, when Groupon was like a hot new thing, I did a bunch of work for Groupon. And way back in the day when they were just tiny, tiny little companies, the main way I made my living from like 2015 to last year for about five, six years was conferences.
00:26:36.600 - 00:26:50.572, Speaker B: I would travel usually at least once a month all around, and I would watch all the talks at a conference, and then I would get up at the end and sing a song that recaps everything at the conference that all the different.
00:26:50.626 - 00:26:55.788, Speaker A: That's so funny. Can you give an example of one of the conferences you went to?
00:26:55.794 - 00:27:41.068, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there was a ton. I mean, I did it actually at Devcon. I did one actually, like, wow, Devcon four, I think it was. But I did like big companies. I did a Dr. Pepper was one. Or like Novartis, which is pharmaceutical company, or a lot of random associations, like nursing associations and housing associations, or electrical co ops and things like this just really random shit where I'd just be singing about God knows what.
00:27:41.068 - 00:28:21.604, Speaker B: And a lot of these you can find, like, if you go to Jonathanmann.net and you scroll down, I have them all listed, and a lot of these you can listen to. In fact, the last gig I did pre coronavirus was for a group of, what are they called? The national. It was a bunch of virologists, basically. It was, like, people studying about viruses and how they spread. It was very random. The fact that November of 2019, I was singing about vaccines, the importance of this stuff.
00:28:21.604 - 00:29:15.592, Speaker B: And then a few months later, coronavirus happened. So that was my living. And then COVID hit, and all the work that I had been doing in crypto sort of took a backseat for a little while because we were sort of in crisis mode. Almost all of our income went away. And then what actually ended up happening was that I really lucked out because I had written this song that it ended up being my most viral song ever. It was a song about baby Yoda from Mandalorian, and it went viral in a way that I'd never had before, via TikTok, of course, because that's how this happens these days. And it has, like, 9 million views on YouTube now and, like 4 million streams on Spotify.
00:29:15.592 - 00:29:24.164, Speaker B: And for much of 2020, that filled the income gap somehow.
00:29:24.312 - 00:29:24.912, Speaker A: Wow.
00:29:25.046 - 00:30:15.600, Speaker B: Via the YouTube money and the Spotify money, it's not amazing money, but it's like, if you're in a pinch, like we were, it made all the know, Patreon, Google Ads, all this kind of stuff. But the dream has always been that nfts, the dream from the very beginning has been, can I get to the place where I'm minting an NFT every day? And that is what sustains me and my family, is just me making a song every day, minting it, people want to buy it, and that's all I have to do. I don't have to worry about hustling in a million different directions.
00:30:16.020 - 00:32:20.436, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's one of the really compelling stories with NFTs and creators is it's just meant to allow you to be able to monetize what you do and allow folks, I mean, literally turn it into a form of money or a store of value and be able to sell. And with all of the liquidity in the NFT market, it just makes a lot of sense. Again, I think it clashes with, I think, the legacy narrative that why is it that creators have always, I think for not just like decades, hundreds, thousands of years, it's been this idea that if you go this creative route that you have to really struggle and that there's only a few real outliers that live a high quality life. Or even actually some more recent examples that I use to try to explain NFTs to friends is even if you take someone like Andy Warhol, who had all the success, this is a person who sold his artwork, in some cases for very small amounts of money, and then it went on to be resold for outrageous amounts. Why wouldn't we welcome something that automates pain a royalty back to creators? That's the exciting thing about many of these NFT projects is they might sell for a fraction of one ETH, which in some cases is a lot of money at this point. But it's the fact that every time it resells, you're continually seeing a kickback to the creator. And, yeah, like I said, why would you cheer against anything like that? That's why I don't understand anyone that doesn't get behind the idea of NFTs.
00:32:20.436 - 00:32:29.640, Speaker A: It's a really clever and direct way of rewarding people for their creative work over and over and over again as it gets resold.
00:32:30.700 - 00:33:32.780, Speaker B: Yeah. And like I said before, I don't think it's necessarily like a panacea. Right. It's not going to solve everything right away for everybody. But the idea of NFTs, the deep, deep, deep idea, is just that on a much more fundamental level, all of this stuff that we create, from tweets to blog posts to, in my case, songs to, in your case, videos, all of these things, none of the value of any of the stuff that we make accrues to us as the creators. 99% of the value accrues to Google and to Facebook. And the promise of NFTs in general, is the idea that all of this stuff could one day, we're a long way off still, but all of this stuff that we create could one day really be ours.
00:33:32.780 - 00:33:57.204, Speaker B: And if we decide to monetize these things in some way, 99% of the value could accrue to us. And it doesn't have to just be about art. It can be just about everything that we create online. Yeah, that's the sort of utopian dream scenario that nfts kind of present.
00:33:57.402 - 00:34:30.444, Speaker A: Well, hey, let's walk everyone through the essentials here of what they need to know about Songadao. So I'm going to put this up on screen. I'm at Songaday world and I'm going to try to explain it with you. I think as like a fresh set of eyes. I've been looking at this the last few days. So you have this presale that's going on basically through the end of November. The NFTs are actual songs that you had written.
00:34:30.444 - 00:34:35.452, Speaker A: Again, everything here is about the songs you've written, which are in the form of NFTs.
00:34:35.516 - 00:34:36.130, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:37.160 - 00:34:42.230, Speaker A: And then actually, I will reshare a different screen here.
00:34:45.240 - 00:35:22.552, Speaker B: Yeah. So the songs that are available now are songs that are from year two a song a day. Year one sold out back in March and year two is still available. There's still a few eclectic method. If you all are familiar with him, he did the work. The illustrations and the illustrations all cool. Apply to each part of the illustration is a trait of the song.
00:35:22.552 - 00:35:27.090, Speaker B: So the one that you see with the hands, that means that those songs are about friends.
00:35:28.580 - 00:35:29.004, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:35:29.062 - 00:35:37.284, Speaker B: The acoustic guitar means that it's about an acoustic guitar. This is a song that I made for my friend's baby who is turning one.
00:35:37.482 - 00:35:43.940, Speaker A: I saw this one. Yeah. I thought that was a really cute little song there with him, like sleeping on the blanket.
00:35:44.020 - 00:36:10.252, Speaker B: Yeah. It's really song. These are the ones that are available. And so the way that it works is that the NFT that you buy is the thing that makes you eligible to be in the Dow. And then there's another step that you have to take that isn't quite. We're not ready for it yet. Once we have, there's this other thing that's going to happen, which is called the big sad drop, the big Sangade drop.
00:36:10.252 - 00:36:49.464, Speaker B: Once that happens, we're going to start really onboarding people into the dao. But what you need to know is the first thing that needs to happen is you get yourself a song a day NFT. And then the second thing that you'll do is verify yourself with this protocol called Bright ID, which is really quite an amazing product. It's a way to verify that you are you, that you're one human, you're not a bot, you're not a robot, you're not anything. And that way we can know that you are you. And then that is your entry into the dow. As soon as you own a song, a day song, and you're verified with bright id, you can become a member of the Dao.
00:36:49.464 - 00:37:32.904, Speaker B: If you just hold a song a day song, that's great. You'll be called a listener and you'll be given access to the discord. The discord is going to be completely gated. So the only way that you can get in to this part of the discord is with a song a day song and then you're a listener and you can participate in snapshot votes and you can still sort of direct the creative direction of the project as just owning a song a day song. But if you want to actually become a real member of the actual co op, and this is for legal reasons, you need to get verified with bright ID. They don't need to know your real name, they don't need to know where you live. They don't need any identifying information about you.
00:37:32.904 - 00:37:46.050, Speaker B: What you do have to do is go onto the Zoom call. They need to be able to see your face. You need to go into an app and you verify yourself with them. It's really cool. It's an amazing process. I highly recommend just doing it because it's fun.
00:37:47.460 - 00:37:48.336, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:37:48.438 - 00:38:07.680, Speaker B: Once you're verified, then you're going to be able to do like votes on the treasury. You can actually vote. Once you're verified, you have your song of day song and you're verified, you're going to actually be able to direct the funds of the treasury of the Dow. That's when that happens. And that's one person, one vote. It's very simple. There's no token.
00:38:07.680 - 00:38:13.248, Speaker B: It's just you, me, everybody. We all get one vote in the dow.
00:38:13.424 - 00:38:35.100, Speaker A: So if I want to be involved in song a dow, I need to go to Songaday world. Look for the presale ticker. It's right up top. There's a button about claiming NFTs, which again, there's only like 39 of them. Basically sold half of them as of yesterday.
00:38:37.040 - 00:39:02.804, Speaker B: There's 365 total in this group. Right. They're from year two a year 365. So that's how many there are. And then your only other chance. So there will be basically like two other chances to get songs from these drops. Like this is what's left now and then depending on how gas is doing and the price of ETH.
00:39:02.804 - 00:39:08.676, Speaker B: I've been watching it. It ticked up above like 400 gas I saw in my little ticket.
00:39:08.708 - 00:39:09.620, Speaker A: It's been brutal.
00:39:09.700 - 00:39:47.396, Speaker B: It's really brutal. So I don't know exactly when I'm going to do this big drop, but sometime maybe late December, early January is going to be a really big drop. It's 4000 songs all going to be dropping at once. And it's going to be very different from this because it's going to be just like every other project that you see. It's going to be a big red button and you're just going to press mint, and it's going to give you a song. I think part of what's made selling these songs more difficult for me has been it's really hard to go through and choose one that you want to be yours. Right.
00:39:47.396 - 00:40:13.500, Speaker B: That's a totally different experience than how most people buy NFTs. Most people, like, they press them in, they get what they get, and it's fun. And then if you don't like it, you sell it and you get a different one that you want. But when we do the big sad drop, it's going to be 4000 songs, and they're going to be a little bit more expensive. This is going to be 0.2 in the big sad drop. So this is the cheapest you'll get them.
00:40:13.500 - 00:40:46.664, Speaker B: And then after that, after the big sad drop, what's going to happen is I'm going to be auctioning off my song every single day as I write it. So I don't actually know what the price is going to be after the big drop. Like, the big drop will happen, and then I'm just going to start auctioning off my songs every day, and we'll see how much they go for at that point. But all of the money from those drops, from the auctions, that money doesn't go to me, it goes to the dow, if that makes sense.
00:40:46.702 - 00:41:06.240, Speaker A: Yeah. So what you're doing right now is we're kind of playing catch up to distribute all of these songs from the past 13 years. And then moving forward, you'll continue to produce that song every day. But as an NFT, it gets auctioned, which kind of reminds me of, like, is it nouns?
00:41:08.740 - 00:41:51.230, Speaker B: Obviously, nouns is a huge influence on the project, specifically in the way that the dow. Because from the very beginning, I've always wanted to get caught up, right. And then do this daily auction thing. That's always been part of it. But the nouns part was, oh, what if the money didn't go to me? What if the money goes to a dow? That suddenly becomes really interesting, because then it's not just me. Then it's like we have people who can be actually invested in the project going forward, both literally and figuratively. My camera keeps falling down.
00:41:51.600 - 00:42:11.780, Speaker A: I think one question I left out here is, so we're going to get to this point where all of your music has been sold, minted as NFTs. That revenue, those fees, whatever, go into the song Adao treasury.
00:42:13.240 - 00:42:16.790, Speaker B: The money from all previous songs is going to me.
00:42:17.160 - 00:42:22.692, Speaker A: Okay, that makes sense. I kind of feel like you're getting.
00:42:22.746 - 00:42:35.256, Speaker B: Short sighted the idea is that the Dow is paying me for, for the copyright to all of those songs.
00:42:35.448 - 00:42:36.172, Speaker A: I got you.
00:42:36.226 - 00:43:10.552, Speaker B: You know what I mean? So I'm accepting a payment on the future royalties for all of those songs. All future royalties don't go to me, they go to the dow. And then from that moment forward, all the money goes to the Dow. And then this is really cool to me. The Dow, if you're a voter, if you own a song, of a song and you're verified with bright ID, you can vote on how much to pay me? How much do I get paid? I don't know. That's up to the Dow. It's not up to me.
00:43:10.552 - 00:44:07.800, Speaker B: I love that. I think that's super weird and exciting and interesting. How much do we want to pay someone who's in the Dow, who's doing solidity work and how much do we want to pay for? How much is it worth? This is like something that we haven't figured out quite yet. Maybe something using chain link or whatever, but like tweeting about song a day, leaving comments on song a day, being active in the discord, being active in the discourse. All of these things are things that I think should be, we should find a way for you to be able to be paid on behalf of the Dow for doing all these things if you're a member. And so that's something I'm really excited for because I think there's a lot of people working on these kinds of solutions, like how to bridge this sort of off chain activity and bring it on chain and make it trackable.
00:44:08.620 - 00:44:52.810, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I would tell anyone, if you have been wanting to understand how a Dow works, the best way is just to get involved in one. And this, to me, feels like a really easy one to get in on the ground floor of, just because at this point, it seems all you have to do is get one of those NFTs and then get yourself verified through bright ID. And it's fun. At the end of the day, there's so many dows that I've been involved in. I definitely don't feel confident that I could run a Dow myself. But when you're working on something with a group of friends, it's a really rewarding experience.
00:44:52.810 - 00:45:02.650, Speaker A: And again, if you get into a Dow at this point, you're in like 1% of 1% of 1% of people in the world that have done that.
00:45:03.020 - 00:45:08.110, Speaker B: Talking about being early, right. It's like, oh, my gosh, yes, we're very early.
00:45:08.640 - 00:46:06.050, Speaker A: Anything else that you think is worth sharing. I think we've covered nearly everything there about Songadao and just again, your journey, and I commend what you've done to pivot your passion into this because it's very difficult. I've worked on a lot of startups and a lot of small businesses and a lot of web three projects, and I can tell anyone, the excitement in new stuff, it's always there. But very few people actually are able to stick with something for a long time. And that's because it's very difficult to continue to pivot and live in that long term sort of mission. But this is one rare example of technically one of the longest running projects that now has become a true web three project.
00:46:07.460 - 00:46:46.376, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. No, I think we covered it all. And I mean, that's it for me. I've always been just curious and always interested in what can I fold into song a day, song a day as my scaffolding and what can I build on top of it. And back in the day, it was this new thing called YouTube, and now it's. This is, this is clearly where things are happening and it's really exciting.
00:46:46.568 - 00:47:00.652, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, every time your camera has droop, it looks like someone is holding it and it's like getting drunk and you're like, hold on. You look like you're like, wake up, wake up. It's so funny.
00:47:00.796 - 00:47:18.580, Speaker B: I wish I could show you my janky. I've just redid my whole set up. And so all it is is just like sitting on this thing here. This is like a shelving thing. And so it's just like attached to this Shelf.
00:47:19.420 - 00:47:20.570, Speaker A: I love it.
00:47:21.740 - 00:47:23.850, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very low tech.
00:47:25.580 - 00:48:14.200, Speaker A: For really the past year since COVID had started, the setup that I had was just hilarious. I mean, I was normally on the corner of a bed with terrible lighting behind me. So the fact that I have a ring light now and you have some camera on a stand, I'm like, I'll never forget how freaking brutal it was setting, working with that. Well, reminder to everyone. Then you can follow Jonathan and all of the music that he creates here on Twitter at Songaday man with two n's at the end. Make sure you check out Songaday World again. Those follow up steps to get involved in the Dow are pretty, you know, pick up one of those NFTs and then get verified through bride ID.
00:48:14.200 - 00:48:18.328, Speaker A: And you have to remind me, you do have a discord group as well, right?
00:48:18.414 - 00:48:21.708, Speaker B: Not yet. I'm working on it. Yeah.
00:48:21.794 - 00:48:36.892, Speaker A: Cool. That's about it. I need to get on there. I was yesterday looking at those again. There was like 65 of them left, and now there's only 39. Getting down to the wire?
00:48:36.956 - 00:48:38.210, Speaker B: I hope so. Yeah.
00:48:39.060 - 00:49:08.310, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, hey, thanks, everyone, for tuning in. And if you enjoyed this, please join us@dfidad.com. On my YouTube channel.
