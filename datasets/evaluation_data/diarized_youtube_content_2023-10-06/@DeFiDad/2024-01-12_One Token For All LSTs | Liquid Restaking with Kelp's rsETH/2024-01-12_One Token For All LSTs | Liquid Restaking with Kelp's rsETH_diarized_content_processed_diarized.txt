00:00:00.250 - 00:00:43.260, Speaker A: A lot of users actually use liquid staking tokens today, and they participate in DeFi. And then when restaking kind of emerges, it's going to conflict with DeFi. Users are going to have to choose between restaking or DeFi. They can't have the best of both the worlds. How can we solve that? That's where the design of our receipts came into play, where we wanted to create this single receipt token that gives users access to staking and restaking rewards liquidity as well as opportunity to participate in DeFi, and also eliminate the complexity of all of these, all of the complexity of claiming these different types of reward tokens given by the Abs.
00:00:46.190 - 00:01:12.420, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's show spotlights one of the first liquid restaking protocols to emerge, called Kelpdao. In this episode, we'll review Kelpdao's liquid restake Token RfE, designed to offer liquidity to illiquid assets deposited into restaking platforms such as Eigen layer. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.
00:01:12.790 - 00:01:44.494, Speaker C: Introducing the mantle liquid staking protocol. Mantle LSP, a permissionless, noncustodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum l one and governed by Mantle. With mantle LSP, users can stake ETH to instantly receive me, earn, yield, and accumulate rewards. The longer you stake me is the value accumulating receipt token that will give you access to expanded yield opportunities. Stake and watch your yield grow with.
00:01:44.532 - 00:02:24.518, Speaker B: Mantle LSP for most of us, our crypto journey started with Metamask, and now with metamask portfolio, we can do so much more. Metamask portfolio puts you in control. Use the dashboard to see all your assets and balances across your wallets in one place. The buy feature allows us to buy crypto assets effortlessly with fiat options such as PayPal or credit card. The swap feature allows us to swap any tokens anytime by finding a selection of available rates. The bridge feature allows us to bridge between networks, including Ethereum L ones and L two s, based on the best price and fastest delivery time. And with the stake feature, anyone in a few clicks can stake ETH and earn rewards.
00:02:24.518 - 00:02:42.330, Speaker B: Do more in web three your way with a safe, simple, and convenient tool that's all in one place. Track and manage your web three everything at Metamask IO portfolio Mike, before we get back to the show, can you explain what is liquid restaking?
00:02:42.490 - 00:03:25.498, Speaker D: Everybody at this point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your stake deep, mint a liquid staking token, and then use that token in defi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, oracle networks, other blockchains, and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH.
00:03:25.498 - 00:03:51.634, Speaker D: In Defi. We are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with liquid restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards, restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols, and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:03:51.762 - 00:03:57.480, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:03:59.550 - 00:04:41.110, Speaker E: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up, the first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to Instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:41.690 - 00:04:51.350, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce Amit Gachula and Deeraj Bora, two of the core contributors at Kelpdao, Amit and Deeraj. Welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:51.420 - 00:05:03.450, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Defi dad and nomadic for having us again here. It's always such a pleasure to be on this Edge podcast and talk to you about all things DFI.
00:05:03.530 - 00:06:17.182, Speaker B: Yes, so we're recording this at the very end of 2023. What triggered the conversation is there's been an interest that has grown in liquid restaking, and I think truthfully, most folks didn't even know that term a few months ago. Part of that is the fact that Eigenlayer has recently raised its caps, and as it announced that it would raise its caps for deposits of ETH LSTs, and that it would actually be adding other LSTs to the mix of assets that it supports. There's been a little bit of like a mania or a race to be able to get your ETH LSTs deposited. And I'm just going to cut through the BS and say that I'm imagining most folks are trying to play a future Eigen layer airdrop. And so with that in mind, whether you're trying to play an airdrop or contribute to the future of Eigen layer, there's a lot of competition to get into Eigen layer. And so anyways, one of the protocols that has emerged during this time as a new opportunity for folks to get their ETH LSTs deposited into Eigen layer is Kelpdao.
00:06:17.182 - 00:06:49.002, Speaker B: So the two of you are co founders of Stator, core contributors at stator. We're going to let you kind of tell the story here of how Kelpdao came about, but this being a completely separate protocol is a true liquid restaking protocol. And the flagship token that we'll talk about today is called RSE. So why don't we just talk a little bit then, about what is liquid restaking? Let's give some background here as to what that means before we talk more about kelp.
00:06:49.066 - 00:07:52.866, Speaker A: I think all of you probably are familiar with what Eigen layer is doing with restaking and all the entire set of interesting applications being built on top of Eigen layer that are keen to use restaked Ethereum as security. In the middle of this year, when Diraj and I were chatting about the kind of implications this will have on Defi and all the users, some of the insights that we were able to brainstorm and come up with were quite staggering. Right? A lot of users actually use liquid staking tokens today, and they participate in DeFi. And then when restaking kind of emerges, it's going to conflict with Defi. Users are going to have to choose between restaking or Defi. They can't have the best of both the worlds. That is one interesting insight that we could come up with.
00:07:52.866 - 00:08:23.866, Speaker A: And then the second and third ones are now, obviously, Eigen layer will impose a set of unbonding periods and unstaking conditions based on the requirements of the ABs. So people who will restake their LSTs or Ethereum will have no liquidity during the unbonding period. So that is a big problem that staking kind of created and liquid staking kind of solved. But now it again emerges in a similar avatar with restaking.
00:08:23.898 - 00:08:24.094, Speaker F: Right?
00:08:24.132 - 00:08:27.258, Speaker A: So that was the second insight that came to our minds.
00:08:27.354 - 00:08:27.566, Speaker F: Then.
00:08:27.588 - 00:09:23.130, Speaker A: The third insight was, there's obviously going to be an explosion of ABS, at least. We think there are going to be like potentially 50s, hundreds of different types of applications and infrastructure players that are going to demand decentralized security from eigen layer. Now, each of these players are going to give rewards, or they're going to reward users in their own tokens, or ethereum, or stable coins, or whatever currency or token they choose to reward users in. Now, we all know how expensive Ethereum gas costs can be. And imagine claiming these tens of different types of tokens given to users, and how cumbersome that user experience going to be. So these were the three major insights that kind of hit us. They were really staring in our faces.
00:09:23.130 - 00:10:07.754, Speaker A: And these are the problems that any average Joe is going to face when he has to choose restaking, right? And the answer was pretty obvious was, now how can we solve that? That's where the design of our receipts came into play, where we wanted to create this single receipt token that gives users access to staking and restaking rewards liquidity, as well as opportunity to participate in DeFi, and also eliminate the complexity of all of these complexity of claiming these different types of reward tokens given by the ABs. So this kind of led to the evolution of this rse ten kelp doc Amit.
00:10:07.802 - 00:10:27.346, Speaker G: I love it. I think that's a nice comprehensive overview. You dropped a term in there that I think we should clear up for our listeners and maybe even defi data and myself. You mentioned Avs. Can we just take a step back and just describe what that is, what it means and kind of what that means to Eigen layer as well?
00:10:27.448 - 00:11:04.194, Speaker F: Yeah, so AVs is an actively validated service. It's an application l two roll up app chain, whatever you want to call it. Any application that wants to rent economic security from Eigen layer. Maybe a little bit of context here for people who do not know much about Eigen layer either. Most applications, when they start in crypto, require some sort of economic security. And what Eigen layer does is helps abstract all of that away. The validator set away the economic security part of it, away from our chains, so they can truly focus on their use case.
00:11:04.312 - 00:11:28.398, Speaker B: Guys, maybe we can talk then a little bit more about the tech that actually powers what is Kelpdao and this liquid restaking, and ultimately the liquid restaking token Rs ETH that we'll use. So, yeah, anyways, can you talk a little bit more about how those contracts work? I guess, what's the net result as a user experience and how are those contracts secured?
00:11:28.514 - 00:12:02.606, Speaker F: So the architecture of rs ETH is pretty interesting. We design most of our contracts so information flows just one way, and that's best for security. A great analogy. There is just airport security. That's kind of how we think about contracts for the most part. So we have a deposit pool that accepts different LSTs, and this deposit pool has no functionality to exit any funds. And we have different set of NDC contracts, we call them the node delegator contracts, which take in funds from the deposit pool.
00:12:02.606 - 00:12:47.326, Speaker F: And each of the NDC is fully autonomous in terms of being able to interact with Eigen layer. And right now, only deposits are supported with ten NDCs. So each NDC is capable of effectively moving any sort of LSD that the deposit pool has into eigen layer strategies. We have multiple such NDCs deployed. And in the future, each of these NDCs will correspond to operators. When operators go live on Eigen layer, and when withdrawals are implemented, withdrawals are going to be another set of contracts that talk to Eigen layer through NDCs, and the funds are going to go out through the withdrawal contract. So the information flow overall in the contract architecture is one direction.
00:12:47.326 - 00:13:26.238, Speaker F: And in terms of how we secure these contracts, we were ready with contracts probably early to mid October. Although it's limited functionality, we spent about a month and a half fully testing it. We have 99%, 100% code coverage on the contracts. We went ahead with audits from Sigma prime and code for arena. And these are some of the best auditors that we have worked with in the past on our other protocols. And we're very happy with what you have put out. We're thinking of launching a bug bounty program in the next week or two as well.
00:13:26.324 - 00:13:50.998, Speaker G: Dearidge, can you remind us just how long kelp Dow has been live for users? I have it in my head. I think I saw on Twitter like nine or ten days since we're recording this. And also, I think we mentioned earlier, there's already around $112,000,000 of TVL in this. But yeah, maybe just kind of remind us when it went live officially and just kind of like your take on how you feel it's gone so far.
00:13:51.084 - 00:14:26.526, Speaker F: We went live on the twelveth of December, 2023. That's about time of recording. That's actually slightly less than ten days. So it's been tremendous response. I feel people kind of understood the value proposition of Kelpdao and the fact that we opened up a mechanism for people to deposit their LSTs already and dust their hands off and put the responsibility on Kelpdao to move the assets into Eigen layer, which could be a hectic process when gaps open up. I feel like that has definitely helped. It's been tremendous.
00:14:26.526 - 00:14:38.870, Speaker F: I mean, we continue to grow maybe 510 million every day, even now. And despite ten days into the I can capture mania. Right. So it's been great.
00:14:38.940 - 00:15:24.918, Speaker A: I want to add a couple of, couple of points to what Diraj mentioned. What has been phenomenal is the number of unique wallets, or number of users, we may call it that, kind of deposited with Kerry Dow and minted Rs ETH. This number is like 4500 as of today, which goes to say that it's not just a set of ten or 15 users that have utilized this opportunity. There are a lot of users that have deposited one e, five e just so that they could mint Rs ETH and leverage this functionality. When I'm in, layer caps go up. So that has been one of the numbers that was really exciting for me to look.
00:15:24.964 - 00:15:58.026, Speaker B: It's remarkable just how much liquidity has deposited into kelp here in the past ten days. And I think it's also a sign of just the changing tides in the market. We're in a much more exciting bullish time. And I think that's also because there's new folks entering the space. There's just all that's been developed over the years. And this is like typical bull market stuff. All of a sudden, folks realize everything that's been long in development.
00:15:58.026 - 00:16:52.094, Speaker B: And I want to say that the reality of those innovations is now exceeding the expectations that were there. So this is a really feel good time in the bull run. By the end of the bull run, we'll be saying, okay, people's expectations have exceeded where reality is and think that everything is possible and everything works. So anyways, you got to enjoy this time. One thing I just want to reinforce, though, for those that are your average defi user, like myself and nomadic, you can look at Rs ETH as really it's your liquid restaked token. And so it's the equivalent of what you held previously, whether it was Ethex or re or steeth by Lido. The idea, of course, was that you earn in a passive way.
00:16:52.094 - 00:18:05.846, Speaker B: You're earning staking yield through Ethereum, and then you have that token as something that is still liquid that you can borrow against, that you can become a liquidity provider with. What is somewhat bizarre to me is that this mania around Eigen layer with everyone wanting to deposit, they're giving up their liquidity. Folks were basically, what do I want to say negating the utility that they weren't sought out in that token, they're dropping in, let's say, steeth or re or ethics now. And now you would no longer have that liquidity. So for those of us who like to make our ETH or stake ETH work harder for us, it makes a hell of a lot of sense that you'd want rs ETH, because now you can continue to do all the things that you are doing in defi. The only dependency here, which we're going to talk a bit about, is just that RSE being new, there's more Defi opportunities coming with that. So I don't want to pretend like all the same opportunities are there as compared to something like ethx that's been live much longer.
00:18:05.846 - 00:18:59.622, Speaker B: So anyways, we'll cover that in just a bit. The next sort of question, though, I wanted to cover is I noticed literally today, no joke, just before this, I deposited some more ETH into ethx and then dropped it into Kelpdao. I noticed on the website for Kelpdao that the steeth deposits, the steeth caps for Eigen layer, had reached their max or were filled up. So anyways, that said, how does this continue to work as the caps are reached? Short story is you can still deposit ethx then through Kelpdao, and you're getting Rs ETH, but let's just pretend that ethx fills up soon. What happens after that?
00:18:59.756 - 00:19:28.782, Speaker F: Users can still continue depositing their assets. We'll queue up the ST ETH and ethex assets for the next time the caps are raised. So that's the short answer of what people can expect after. There are a few things users will be able to do, we might take in more assets, and those assets could potentially be open on Eigenair as well. So there are further avenues in which people can continue maintaining RSV.
00:19:28.846 - 00:20:18.590, Speaker G: Guys, I want to walk through all the rewards that users can receive by kind of taking advantage of this Kelpdow platform. Obviously, we've seen this phrase of airdrop farmers and everything play out on Solana, and we've seen this in the past on Ethereum. It's nothing new. But as we talked about kind of earlier, before we started rolling on the pod, I think everybody's looking at the Eigen layer, airdrop and kind of sizing it up and doing some kind of crazy mental math in their head, and you've got this point system built into this. So yeah, maybe walk us through the Eigen layer point system. What other maybe potential future rewards might be looming out there for users that deposit their ETH in Kelpdao?
00:20:18.670 - 00:20:48.220, Speaker F: So when it comes to Eigen layer points, every ETH deposited, one ETH deposited into eigen layer earns 24 points a day. And that's the math. That's how the Eigen layer point system works. There have been no caps that have been set. There are no minimum limits when it comes to the kelp side. Every ETH is worth 10,000 points a day. Kelp, we call them the kelp mines rather than the point system.
00:20:48.220 - 00:21:37.606, Speaker F: For everyone who has deposited since the twelveth, since the launch up until now and probably in the near future. Until the near future, they are going to get a 25% boost on those miles. This is purely to reward the early adopters for trusting a newer protocol. So for each ETH they earn 1.25 times 10,000 miles a day, there are further rewards. While there have been no rewards on the sTe side that kelp also takes in as a collateral stator, CTEX is offering a 30% yield boost on the Ethereum staking rewards. Plus, stators just announced yesterday that they're staking part of their treasury into Eigen layer.
00:21:37.606 - 00:22:03.346, Speaker F: So all of the eigen points that the stader's etex position earns on eigen layer, they are up for crafts for eTex holders on kelp. So effectively, this makes etex the only collateral which only LST amongst any of the LSTs that eager accepts where you can earn more eigenair points.
00:22:03.528 - 00:22:20.994, Speaker G: That is very cool. Yeah, I didn't know about that one. Okay. One other thing that popped in my head while you were kind of running through that was. So we're seeing all these rumors that if you hold like and stake Celestia, you'll be entitled to future airdrops.
00:22:21.042 - 00:22:21.382, Speaker F: I guess.
00:22:21.436 - 00:22:58.970, Speaker G: I don't know if any of that's for sure, but it sounds like a pretty. I would say it's almost like a certainty at this point. Is there something similar playing out with rs ETH? Like, if I'm going to be a holder of RS ETH, do you think that would entitle you to future Eigen layer airdrops? If Eigen layer is going to be this security network that all these middleware players can tap into, I see a future where there's 100, 200, maybe 1000 projects leveraging Eigen layer. And is it a stretch for me to think that maybe those projects will do Eigen layer airdrops that kind of come back to rs ETH holders eventually.
00:22:59.150 - 00:23:23.358, Speaker F: I wouldn't be surprised if that turns out to be the case, because we have seen the exact same thing happening on other ecosystems in 2021. Bull run, right? Actually, like this is a great way for newer protocols in particular to get that initial bootstrapping user base. I don't want to say this will happen, but intuitively I'm almost certain that it will.
00:23:23.524 - 00:23:47.174, Speaker B: Guys, what about DeFi opportunities? I sort of alluded to the benefits here of having something like an Rs ETH, so the next most immediate question in my head is what can I do with this? Or what can I expect to do with it? Any new DeFi opportunities you know about already or have confirmed, or you can tease us with.
00:23:47.372 - 00:24:34.658, Speaker A: So one of the fundamental advantages of having Rs ETH over directly restaking on Eigen layer is that users can access immediate liquidity and also defi opportunities, right? So obviously a lot of Defi opportunities are in the pipeline. The immediate ones would be liquidity on the likes of curve, balancer, et cetera. And then some of the things in the pipeline are some really exciting ones like Pendle and few other lending markets that are already pretty keen to onboard RSC as collateral. So these are some of the opportunities that we are also quite excited about, and a lot of users are looking forward to taking advantage of.
00:24:34.824 - 00:24:45.542, Speaker G: And guys, what about the addition of future LSTs to kelp? And then I'm just thinking, what about native e three staking with kelp? What's the plans there?
00:24:45.676 - 00:25:32.258, Speaker F: All of this is on the roadmap nomadic. In short, we have an internal framework that we are cleaning up to publish and put it out there in terms of what makes a good collateral for kelp. And once that is out, it should provide ample opportunity for everyone to review, understand how we choose, and pick LST. In terms of the native e three staking, I think honestly we're still debating if we should support that internally. We somehow feel that the ETH staking in particular, or native e three staking is a smaller market size, and so we're kind of evaluating the opportunity cost internally.
00:25:32.434 - 00:25:45.814, Speaker B: So for folks that are going to Kelpdao XYZ and reviewing the application, what features are live, and also, I guess, what risks are associated in using kelp.
00:25:45.942 - 00:26:21.160, Speaker F: When it comes to the user features, we have the normal plethora of features that are available on the DAP. There are probably eight or ten different wallets that are supported on Kelp UI today already. Users can deposit SDE if there is any capacity left, and etext and I do know there is some capacity left there. Users are able to deposit that into the kelp contracts. We don't support withdrawals yet. Withdrawals are probably going to be supported in February of 2024. So maybe about a month and a half away.
00:26:21.160 - 00:26:37.786, Speaker F: Yeah, and all of the assets that are deposited into kelp are going to move automatically into Eigen layer and users can also check out the status of the Eigen layer caps on the banner on kelp tab.
00:26:37.818 - 00:26:58.086, Speaker B: Well, this is a great place for us then, I think, to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners first that they can learn more about kelp by going to Kelpdao XYZ. They can follow Kelp K e l p dow on Twitter and then Deerj and Amit. Just want to give you the final word here.
00:26:58.188 - 00:27:46.066, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you Deepadar and nomadic for this great podcast. I want to sort of emphasize on a couple of things. As always, do your own research before depositing any of your assets with kelp. From our end, we have taken as much security precautions as possible to keep the funds safe and secure, including audits as well as a bug bounty that is going to go live pretty soon. All in all, we are very excited about this product, liquidity, staking and RSId and all the associated Djen DFI opportunities that will go live with it in 2024. So very excited about this and happy holidays to everyone.
00:27:46.248 - 00:27:58.870, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check our link tree at Edge underscore pod.
