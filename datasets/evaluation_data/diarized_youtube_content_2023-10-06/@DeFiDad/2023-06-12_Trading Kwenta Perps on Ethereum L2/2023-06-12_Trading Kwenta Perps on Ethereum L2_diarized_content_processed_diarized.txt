00:00:00.170 - 00:00:34.050, Speaker A: Quinta is a decentralized derivatives trading platform, so it's operated by a DAO. Quinta's deployments are all done through a decentralized manner. Everything's basically housed in decentralized infrastructure, sometimes to our demise. And then, yeah, this platform is really designed to facilitate the trading of derivatives in DeFi. So meaning that perpetual futures options and any other kind of interesting assets that or interesting mechanisms for trading that you think are in demand will probably make their way onto Quanta. And right now that's perps. Perps is one of the most popular ways to trade.
00:00:34.050 - 00:00:57.530, Speaker A: And perps is basically a way to get leverage or to have like a multiplier for the impact of price movement on your trade and on Quinta. You can go up to 50 x right now on, I think, ETH and other markets, which enables you to have 50 x the action up and down. And that's enabled traders to sort of use smaller amounts of capital to have larger upside or downside.
