00:00:08.330 - 00:00:40.854, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. It is Friday, November 5, 2021. This is DFI talks with DFI dad. Hey, everyone. Thank you for joining. And forgive me, I might sound a little congested. I have COVID.
00:00:40.854 - 00:01:28.342, Speaker A: I just found out in the last 24 hours, got back from NftnYC and missed a few events there. But I should be all good here for the interview. Today we're going to talk with Hugh Carp from Nexus Mutual, all about the cream exploit and what that's meant for about 8.79 million in active cover holders in Nexus mutual. So given an exploit like this, this is exactly what the mutual looks to cover. We're going to talk about what that claims process has looked like and how it actually works and why most of these so far have been approved, I think very quickly, but there are some restrictions to actually showing that you lost money. So anyways, Hugh, welcome to the show.
00:01:28.342 - 00:01:29.446, Speaker A: How are you doing?
00:01:29.628 - 00:01:33.850, Speaker B: I'm doing very good, thank you. I don't have COVID right now, so that's.
00:01:34.190 - 00:02:00.594, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Hughes in a much better place. I've got the kids at home and everything. I'm going to live the full on COVID experience. Well, Hugh, do you want to give some background then to just in case someone's watching this in the future, we probably should talk a little bit about just what is Nexus mutual first, and then what's happened recently with cream and how that's played into the claims process with Nexus mutual. Yeah.
00:02:00.632 - 00:02:39.166, Speaker B: Cool. So Nexus mutual is a discretionary mutual. So it's kind of like an insurance company, basically. Members pull their money together and they cover risks that each person takes faces, and then they decide as a group which claims are valid, et cetera. And so the main risks that we're covering right now are risks within defi, so smart contract risks, failures, technical bugs, oracle failures, all that type of stuff, dPegs and things like that. So that's the main focus of the mutual. And I guess in terms of what happened today, last week with cream was interesting.
00:02:39.166 - 00:03:28.234, Speaker B: So I won't go into the massive details of the attack, but I guess it was a relatively complicated exploit that resulted in one of the tokens being having their price manipulated. And then that kind of meant that the attacker had a lot more borrowing power than they should have essentially been allowed within the system. And then they effectively took all of the money out of the Ethereum version of cream. And so it resulted in a loss of about 130,000,000. That number may be a little bit out, but roughly that figure and pretty much all of the funds on the cream's Ethereum version were taken. The hackers kind of disposed of them from there. That's kind of the background.
00:03:28.234 - 00:03:34.900, Speaker B: And then as a result, people have started submitting claims on Nexus and we've started paying them.
00:03:36.630 - 00:04:01.446, Speaker A: Maybe it would be good then for us to talk about how does the actual claims process. You know, you wake up, you find out that cream has been exploited, you breathe a sigh of relief because you hold cover through Nexus. So it's very likely that this is all going to be covered. What's the next step? What's happened? I guess over the past week or.
00:04:01.468 - 00:04:47.090, Speaker B: So, yeah, the first step is that we have basically a three day cooldown period from the time of the hack until people are allowed to submit the first claims. That's primarily to make sure that everyone can understand what actually happened, give people time to analyze the exploit, understand exactly what happened. So we're not assessing claims in a really time pressured fashion. It also gives the hacked protocols kind of team a chance to put out a statement of some description. Sometimes they will refund money and therefore there are no net losses, et cetera. So it's to kind of let those processes flow out. Once the three day period has completed the cooldown, then people can submit claims.
00:04:47.090 - 00:05:48.634, Speaker B: And basically when you submit a claim on Nexus, it's one ethereum transaction and you also provide what we call proof of loss. So you have to prove that you actually lost funds in the hack. And so usually that's done by providing a signed message from an account that was directly impacted. And so we can look up on chain which accounts were directly impacted and lost money. So you can have multiple accounts and you can just provide the one that was hacked as a proof, and that's kind of the claim submission process. And then after that point, then the claims assessors, that creates a workflow item for the claims assessors, which then vote basically yes or no. Did that meet the criteria or not? And the voting process it can take at its longest up to about four days, but usually most of them are resolved in 36 to 72 hours.
00:05:48.634 - 00:05:56.830, Speaker B: And so they usually resolve pretty quickly. It's really just a time to get enough people to just vote on the claims.
00:05:57.170 - 00:07:06.050, Speaker A: So one of the talking points that I run into when I'm talking with others in the deFi space about Nexus mutual or just defi cover in general, they throw back at me, well, why would anyone vote to pay out a claim? Like if you are holding NXM, you're staking it in Nexus and you're providing that cover, you wouldn't want to ultimately lose money paying it out to someone that has a claim. Can you talk about what incentives have been built in? And I guess what I just said too is I want to clarify, I'm trying to kind of repeat some of the talking points that have been said to me while the fact that I've been involved in the mutual the last two years, I'm like, I couldn't be further from the truth. I feel like we're obviously eager to pay those out because we're proud and excited to show that the mutual actually works. But how did the actual incentives built into the NXM token and into the design of nexus prevent the mutual from not paying out a valid claim?
00:07:06.550 - 00:07:42.722, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's two main incentives. I think more generally there's an obvious short term incentive not to pay claims because you take a hit straight away. But the key is that there's a very aligned long term incentive to pay all genuine claims. Because on a long term basis, if you don't pay genuine claims, then the mutual isn't going to be worth anything. It's absolutely useless. And so the mechanisms that we've designed in this system are twofold. One, to push all the incentives to long term alignment to make sure that the claims assessors are, when they stake, they're locked up.
00:07:42.722 - 00:08:40.218, Speaker B: And so if they decline genuine claims, then they would face a significant loss in the token price because why would anyone have any sense of value in the mutual in the future if it doesn't pay genuine claims? And so they would suffer that directly. So that's a very core mechanism. The second core mechanism is the fact that if there's obvious attacking like behavior, then when you stake to voting claims assessment, then your stake can be burned. And we have actually done that in the past. There has been someone submitted a claim on, I think it was uniswap and there never been an issue on uniswap. And then they voted yes on their own claim to try and extract money that didn't go through because their vote was overwhelmed by other voters. So the outcome of the claim was still right, but as punishment, the mutual decided to burn their bond, their stake.
00:08:40.218 - 00:09:20.590, Speaker B: And so that mechanism has approved to work. And I think one thing more generally is that it's a discretionary mutual, which means there's no obligation to pay claims, but the discretion can actually work in both ways. And perhaps that's something worth talking about a bit further with another claim that's come through. But that means if there are edge cases that don't necessarily fit the technical wording, but feel like in spirit they should be paid, then we can pay claims. You're not actually bound by that, which is actually, in my mind, a benefit over like an insurance contract.
00:09:21.250 - 00:10:15.060, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one of the things that I've learned being a part of the mutual the last few years and not having any background in insurance is just understanding the terms that have been put forth for Nexus cover are actually very simple, I think, to read and understand compared to traditional sort of insurance terms, if you were to read the fine print. But also, I think, reflecting that we're in a very new space and it's going to take time to refine all of these details. I can attest, as someone who's buying cover to protect myself, but also providing cover, it makes a huge difference. Many months ago, how long ago was it that we moved to protocol cover?
00:10:15.670 - 00:10:19.074, Speaker B: That's a good question. Probably close to a year ago now, actually. Yeah.
00:10:19.192 - 00:10:59.226, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Okay. So originally I was buying cover through Nexus just for my assets on Ethereum. But then we started to cover more chains through this updated cover called protocol cover. Well, that's great for me in this case as a cover holder, but if I'm going to provide cover, I need to now be aware that, hey, I am taking risk. I'm underwriting the risk of a protocol, a defi application, whatever you want to call it, that's on other chains. And there are some who just might not want to assume that risk.
00:10:59.226 - 00:11:19.510, Speaker A: Others might look at it. And there's a, let's say like anchor protocol on Terra has been one of the most popular covers that's bought. There's many people who have earned a lot of premiums from participating in that, and I'm sure there's others who are somewhat hesitant to participate.
00:11:20.410 - 00:11:54.606, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So I think one thing is we are doing new stuff. We have updated the COVID wording in the past as a result of events that were outside the COVID wording, everyone felt we probably should cover those types of risks. They were newly new risks that appeared and then we update the COVID and then we've included them in the future. So I guess that was a part of the protocol cover update as well. So yeah, we've got the very comprehensive cover terms now. And this particular case, in my mind, was a very clear accept and that's the way the claim successors have voted.
00:11:54.606 - 00:12:04.530, Speaker B: And we've paid out four claims for nearly $270,000 right now. So yeah, the system is working and people are getting their claim payments.
00:12:05.690 - 00:12:14.690, Speaker A: Something else that's come up in this recent claims process. So there's been about five claims so far for cream.
00:12:14.850 - 00:12:15.894, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:12:16.012 - 00:12:35.950, Speaker A: Yeah. Four have been paid out. Can you remind us what's the turnaround time to do those payouts? And then talk about this fifth one? That's, I guess it doesn't meet the threshold in terms of the minimum loss in their cream holdings.
00:12:36.290 - 00:12:56.500, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So we've had five claims, four have been approved. Most of them were approved within about 20 hours. One, a bigger one, took a bit longer to just get to the thresholds. The fifth claim hasn't been approved yet. It looks like it's on track to be declined. And that's basically because the COVID was bought for 500 E.
00:12:56.500 - 00:13:30.350, Speaker B: They suffered losses of ten ETH, so about 2% of the COVID amount. And we have a minimum threshold of you must suffer losses of at least 20% of the COVID amount. And that's really, to be honest, it's really kind of a technical limitation that Nexus currently has that we're looking to remove and have the ability to pay partial claims. So ideally in the future we would actually just pay the ten ETH and then everyone would be fine. But we don't have the technical capability to do that now. It's only a zero or the full amount. So in this case it would have been 500.
00:13:30.350 - 00:14:17.582, Speaker B: So it didn't meet the definition of the COVID so it's likely to be declined. However, the community is actually actively discussing this and I think we're going to put up a snapshot vote today to basically make that user whole and pay them ten ETH out of the fund. In general, I think this is a really good, hopefully this battle goes through. I expect it to go through. There's been kind of strong general consensus in the claims discussion channels right now, but assuming that goes through, to me, it's a really good demonstration of how we actually use discretion. We want to pay the claims. This didn't meet the threshold, didn't technically meet the terms of the COVID but we're going to make them use a whole.
00:14:17.582 - 00:14:19.200, Speaker B: And so I think that's really important.
00:14:19.570 - 00:15:13.994, Speaker A: Yeah. This has been the best example recently of why it matters that we're able to vote. It works out in the best interest of the mutual members. We're just in such, like I said, a new sort of frontier. I can attest if we weren't paying out valid claims, I wouldn't be a part of it myself. The whole point of this is to be obviously a better, more capital efficient version of legacy insurance, but built with smart contracts and built for, like, in this case, to cover risk that wouldn't have been covered otherwise by the legacy industry. This is for me, like, if I can earn, let's say, 30% yield in a farm.
00:15:13.994 - 00:16:03.922, Speaker A: I remember this was quite a while ago, I was earning like, 30% in curve on Phantom. It was another chain, and then I was paying like, 2.6% at the time through Nexus. So I'm like, hey, I'm netting out a lot more yield here. That tiny premium is nothing in comparison to being able to actually sleep at night on it. One more thing, Hugh, that's come up is so I've had friends and colleagues ask, why haven't we had more payouts through Nexus mutual? And their point being that DeFi has had lots of hacks. And the last time we had a payout before cream was yearn in, I think, February, we had, like, around 2.6
00:16:03.922 - 00:16:40.182, Speaker A: million. And it was around, like, 15 different claims at the time. But I was, like, looking at the rect news leaderboard, and I mean, yeah, there's billions of dollars, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars. And I think one of the things I wanted to point out and get more of your take on here is just that there's a lot of protocols here that we've never covered. We didn't cover those so that we didn't go insolvent as a mutual. There's a reason that the mutual voted to not cover it. And if it then got wrecked or.
00:16:40.256 - 00:16:41.150, Speaker B: Exploited.
00:16:42.850 - 00:17:13.640, Speaker A: Isn'T that us doing our job? I guess I'm trying to make sense of this, and I'm thinking the disconnect is that many folks don't understand how an insurance mutual is supposed to work, that you don't just cover everything in Defi, you have to have folks who are willing to take the other side of that bet. And if we're not taking the other side of the bet on shit that's being exploited, isn't that the way it's supposed to work, like we're doing our job?
00:17:14.010 - 00:18:11.558, Speaker B: Yeah, there's definitely, like, can you price it right? Is the risk too high? Et cetera, and all those types of questions. And it's very important that the mutual is sustainable in the long term to make sure that it's solvent and meets its valid. You know, I think we can go into, like, we didn't cover a bunch of the ones that have been hacked. I think one interesting example is when BSc started getting releasing lots of DeFi protocols on top, we actually added a lot of the new BSE protocols and our members were not very happy to stake on them. So the prices remained quite high and no one bought cover. And in a couple of cases there were hacks, but there was no cover bought because no one wanted to pay those prices. The fact of the matter is the risk has to be at a certain level to be coverable, and there has to be someone on the other side willing to take it.
00:18:11.558 - 00:18:30.030, Speaker B: And some vivo protocols are perceived to be quite risky, and that's where we're at. I actually think overall, that's probably a very good indication of the sustainability of the mutual, that the members of the mutual are actually doing quite a good job of risk selection.
00:18:30.450 - 00:19:31.038, Speaker A: Yeah, I can attest that at any time. I think I'm staking against like 20 to 25 different protocols right now. And then I think there's about 80 different opportunities or more. Hey, I love what cream builds, but just because I've seen those exploits, I personally wasn't willing to stake against it. That being said, I know that I could potentially lose NXM that I'm staking against other protocols. And then a part of what makes, I think, Nexus's model that much more capital efficient right now is that it uses leverage. So we as NXM holders, are able to stake up to 20 x the amount of NXM against, in this case, up to 20 different protocols.
00:19:31.038 - 00:20:07.390, Speaker A: So if I had 100 NXM, I can't stake more than 100 NXM against a single protocol, but I could put it against 20 different protocols. And the idea there is what? Probabilistically, it's very unlikely that multiple protocols would be hacked at once or that the mutual would become that insolvent, but yeah, no. Hugh, anything else that you think we should cover, though, in terms of the claims process? Five have been filed so far. Do you know the total amount that's been paid out against the. There's like 8.79 million. That was active cover in cream when the hack happened.
00:20:07.390 - 00:20:07.854, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:07.892 - 00:20:31.602, Speaker B: So it fade out? 260,000 at the moment. Wait and see if more claims come in. People have to have loss. I know there are a lot of those covers were actually bought because they were covering different chain implementations and those weren't impacted. So they may not actually come through because they may not actually have losses because they weren't on the Ethereum version of cream.
00:20:31.666 - 00:20:32.198, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:20:32.284 - 00:20:33.558, Speaker B: Well, that's good news.
00:20:33.644 - 00:21:11.410, Speaker A: Again, these are all like, I want to see the valid claims paid out, but if folks aren't filing, I have to assume that those four or five so far all could prove that they had a loss. That's one of the things that I think is a wonderful part about using smart contracts is it's easier to prove a loss here versus taking pictures of a car accident or a dent on your car and trying to prove whose fault it was. And this and that in the traditional insurance industry.
00:21:13.510 - 00:21:23.526, Speaker B: Process here is like ten times better than traditional insurance. It's amazing the people who actually go through it and have gone through regular insurance claims, which obviously a lot of us have.
00:21:23.708 - 00:21:24.440, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:25.450 - 00:21:27.400, Speaker B: It's night and day.
00:21:29.310 - 00:21:56.770, Speaker A: I'll leave us with one more comment on anything else you've heard from your colleagues from the insurance industry about just when they take a look at Nexus and understand how this claims process works, or how folks buy active cover and how you underwrite risk and so on. I'm curious, what are the thoughts lately on comparing nexus with that legacy industry?
00:21:57.110 - 00:22:30.582, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess two things. One is a lot of people, just like the claims process is massively mean, you could cryptographically prove stuff. Everything's transparent. I guess. The other thing, especially from some of my kind of actuarial type colleagues, they're like, amazed at the fact that all the information of this many covers are outstanding out of this amount, or all the data is just there in a dashboard and they can see it all. And weirdly, that's like a really hard problem to get at in regular insurance, knowing what your actual exposures are to particular risks. And so that type of stuff is.
00:22:30.582 - 00:22:43.534, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's just going to fundamentally change things and allow analysis to be done, risks to be managed a lot more efficiently than it is in the traditional insurance space.
00:22:43.732 - 00:23:10.490, Speaker A: Yeah. Just a quick overview for anyone. If you go to Nexustracker IO, there's almost 620,000,000 in active cover, almost, what? 18.3 million in annualized premiums, which is about a little over 4000 ETH. And then everything here is denominated in ETH because the capital pool is at this point. Is the capital pool all ether or is there any die in the pool still?
00:23:10.560 - 00:23:14.010, Speaker B: There's a couple of million of die, mainly ETH. It's mainly.
00:23:14.590 - 00:23:43.922, Speaker A: Got it, got it. Gosh, I think that's about it. Hugh, just thanks so much for joining me. And if anyone is interested to learn more about Nexus, you can go to nexusmutual IO. Make sure you follow Hugh and Nexus Mutual on Twitter. And then if you get onto the Nexus mutual Twitter handle, or if you go to nexusmutual IO, they have a discord group. You can watch all of the conversations about claims play out.
00:23:43.922 - 00:24:02.490, Speaker A: It all happens there. That's something else. I guess I didn't call out here. That's just totally radical. It's all there. There's no backdoor conversations happening. I think the conversations about this claims process have just been super straightforward.
00:24:02.490 - 00:24:37.826, Speaker A: Everyone sort of deemed this like an economic design failure, which fit pretty neatly into our terms. And I love the fact, too, that I say our because it's tokenized. That's another thing that's part of the whole web3 d five community. But anyways, Hugh, thanks so much for your time and everyone. Please, if you enjoyed this, join us again. You can subscribe at Defi dad, hopefully I'll be recovered here from my little COVID stint. And Hugh, anything else you wanted to.
00:24:37.848 - 00:24:50.586, Speaker B: Say before we just like, it's been a great week. Nexus is paying claims and I couldn't be happier, to be honest. So it's great to see the whole system work and make people whole. That's the whole, wait, wait.
00:24:50.688 - 00:25:16.420, Speaker A: Shoot. I know what I forgot. Is there any update on the stateless dow? There's been a lot of talk and work to basically remove some of the restrictions that the mutual was under when you launched forever ago in 2019. Yeah. Anything there you wanted to share about the stateless dow? Or actually maybe you want to talk about what exactly that means.
00:25:16.950 - 00:25:46.250, Speaker B: Yeah. So we're planning on coming up with a broader update, hopefully in a couple of weeks. We're kind of waiting from external advice to get finalized and then we can share that. So the members paid for some external advice and we're getting the final version and then we can come back and present a plan to take it forward. Hopefully it all goes smoothly. But there's going to be a big discussion because it's going to be a potential big change for the mutual. So it's going to be ultimately up to the members to decide.
00:25:46.250 - 00:26:05.970, Speaker B: But I guess the direction of travel is, yeah, we can move to a stateless dow. It'll take a little bit, but no one's ever done this before, I don't think. But we'll get it done. And hopefully if members want to get it done, we'll get it done. And yeah, then we'll go to a full open stateless Dow protocol.
00:26:06.950 - 00:26:45.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I can definitely affirm the, there's been an uptick recently in cover buys due to this whole cream exploit, and I can only imagine with a stateless dow, it just removes some annoying details when signing up. That, again, has all been a part of the journey starting Nexus as the first insurance mutual built with smart contracts. So just removing these friction points, I can't imagine how much cover we'll see bought right now, Hugh, you guys are averaging like, I want to say like 50 million in cover buys a week.
00:26:46.210 - 00:27:05.140, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's big. I don't know. These work in insurance companies, like life insurance companies. And if someone had a 10 million policy, you'd only have a handful of those on your books at once. And we're writing them, I don't know, reasonably regularly. Once every couple of months, a big one comes in of that amount.
00:27:05.140 - 00:27:22.746, Speaker B: We're relatively small compared to a big insurance company still, but we'll be bigger at one day. But I guess the point being people are using this for serious money and so they trust the system and now we're paying claims. And I don't know. I'm very happy with how things are going.
00:27:22.928 - 00:28:03.062, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I'd recommend everyone go to Nexustracker IO. If you just scroll to the very bottom on the COVID tab, it'll show you you can basically rank the covers that have been bought from most recent to the oldest. If you go from most recent, I mean, you can start to flip through these and see, like, people are covering people or entities. I don't know what teams like. Someone just put in a COVID policy for $800,000 and it looks like that was about a 90 day policy. But then I go out further and there's 3.5
00:28:03.062 - 00:28:45.494, Speaker A: million for Ave v two that was put in for, looks like a month. Yeah, just a 30 day policy. So I like those examples because it shows the flexibility of, you don't have to buy like a full year or multi year policy. Just someone goes in clicks a few times in metamasks, pays whatever ungodly fees we're all paying at this point on Ethereum. But still paying those fees through Ethereum, it's easier, I think, than the legacy process. Convex Finance had a million dollar buy here or a million dollar cover, bought 2 million for curve. Yeah, these are numbers like years ago we would have been really flipping out for.
00:28:45.494 - 00:29:07.090, Speaker A: And so you have to zoom out and appreciate all that progress, but. All right, Hugh, now I will actually end the broadcast here. So thanks for staying longer and everyone. Yeah, join us again@dfidad.com if you want to watch more interviews with the leading builders in the DFI and web3 community like Hugh Cart. Everyone, have a great weekend and take care. Bye.
