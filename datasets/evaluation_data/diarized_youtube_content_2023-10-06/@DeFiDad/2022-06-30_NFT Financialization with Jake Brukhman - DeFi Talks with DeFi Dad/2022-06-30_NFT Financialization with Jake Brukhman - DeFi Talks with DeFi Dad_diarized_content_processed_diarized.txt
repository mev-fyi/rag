00:00:03.130 - 00:00:45.798, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi dad. Hey, thanks for joining us. It's Wednesday, June 29, 2022. I'm joined here by Jake Brookman of Coin Fund. Jake is the founder of Coin Fund, which is actually a seven year old crypto fund. It's wild to say because there's very few out there. They were founded in summer 2015, and they're actually coming up on their seven year anniversary.
00:00:45.798 - 00:01:26.310, Speaker A: So congrats on that, Jake. And excited to kind of talk through the origin of Coin fund. Part of what prompted this conversation is Jake was actually one of the investors I looked up to getting into crypto in my early days of 2017. And Jake has always been, and I mean this as a compliment, he's always been at the bleeding edge of what's weird in our space. He was into NFts. What is this future sort of open source metaverse? I think long before it became a mainstream talking point. And so I thought it would make sense with us being in what looks to be a new crypto winter.
00:01:26.310 - 00:01:36.700, Speaker A: Look to him for some advice about how he's navigating it, how he's thinking about that as an investor, and I would say also a builder. So, anyways, Jake, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:37.790 - 00:01:42.560, Speaker B: Good. Thank you so much for having me. Defi dad. That's a sweet intro you got there.
00:01:43.090 - 00:02:20.874, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, it's funny because the very ending says Defi tutorials with Defi dad. I need to spend a little money with an editor to fix that, but. Oh, well. But, yeah, Jake, before we got on, and this is probably a good jumping off point to talk about just your background with coin fund. You mentioned that you've lived in this sort of crypto winter bear market turmoil, whatever you want to call it. You've spent more time in that sort of a market than in bullish times since your start.
00:02:20.874 - 00:02:29.260, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'd love to just let you sort of elaborate on that journey. And then, of course, what prompted you to found coin fund?
00:02:30.510 - 00:03:06.722, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So, as you noted, it's going to be our seven year anniversary in July 1. We've been around for seven years as a firm. Four and a half of those years have been in pretty crazy bear markets. Right. Coin fund in July of 2015, that was a big bear market where bitcoin 200 and $400 for two years. We had one year of ICO boom and then two years of crypto winter, and then a little bit of hopeful recovery in the beginning of 2020, only to have our hopes dashed by the coronavirus crash in crypto, which affected crypto.
00:03:06.722 - 00:04:02.394, Speaker B: Right. And what we always say is we were funded, founded, excuse me, in these conditions. And we've always made some of our most important investments during those times. Founders have made some of the most important technological contributions and infrastructure building contributions during those times. And so in many ways, this environment is, of course, par for the course of crypto, but also pretty natural to us as investors. And what I love about kind of our outlook and our team is that we're a group of people really long term, aligned with decentralization technology, with blockchains, with space. And if you take that longer term point of view, it really helps to invest in the things that you believe in and have longer term success.
00:04:02.394 - 00:04:26.050, Speaker B: I always say, Defi dad, most of the people I've met in crypto are not in crypto anymore. There's a lot of transient folks who kind of come and go. I think you shared the same type of sentiment with me, but it's like the people who are long term in this space and looking forward that I think will be kind of navigating these markets most effectively.
00:04:26.470 - 00:05:55.466, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like it's a marathon, but it's a marathon you don't realize is a marathon until you've been in the marathon for quite some time. So I started working at consensus in mid 2018. I felt like I learned so much just in the first six months, and they were both good and bad lessons, realizing how far we had to go, that so much of the promises that were made about all these different new projects, especially from the ICO boom, just how far behind the technology, actually, you know, I was talking with Marianne O'Conte at permissionless not too long ago. I think we all got to enjoy that conference. Highly recommend people going to that next year. But I was talking with him just about the fact that years ago, you could truly be bored unless you were working full time on a project, or, of course, investing full time, because there just wasn't a whole lot to use. Now we've progressed to a place where there are so many different use cases, whether it falls under the umbrella of defi sort of financial use cases, or whether you're a collector of all the different types of NFTs, or if you're building for a sort of, like, new metaverse type of experience powered by NFTs.
00:05:55.466 - 00:06:40.960, Speaker A: So I think you have to appreciate that progress. It's unfortunate, though, you have to have lived through quite a bit to appreciate that progress. Otherwise, you'll live your own journey in a few years. From now, some newcomer will know, gosh, you're so lucky, Jake, that you got into the space back then. They won't know all the pains that you've lived through. So maybe let's talk a little bit more first about what is it that coin fund has historically invested in? What are the sorts of projects that you're most interested in partnering with to realize this sort of crypto future?
00:06:42.930 - 00:07:59.554, Speaker B: Let me tell you a little bit of the origin story, and then we'll jump into sort of modern, like what we do these days. The origin, like I point very early. I had a friend who seen bitcoin in 20. He showed it to me. So cryptocurrency started being on my radar very early, but it took me a few years to, despite being a pretty deep tech kind of guy, nerdy technologist guy, it took me a couple of years to really understand what bitcoin was doing and genes work. But when I finally got it, I think what was driving me was not so much the cryptocurrency use cases was the case with a lot of early bitcoiners, but more like, what will this technology be used for besides so like out of the gate? Coinfund's thesis was really about how will blockchain technology affect the world? And what we saw proliferation of different use cases of blockchain, like long introduced smart contracts. Now the 30 of sort of layer ones that are out there are supporting some kind of programming facility.
00:07:59.554 - 00:09:07.078, Speaker B: Even bitcoin does to some extent these days. And really most of the innovation, most of the progress that we see on the back of people building new kinds of decentralized applications on top of these foundational platforms. Today, coin fund is 34 people, mostly in New York City. I spend a lot of my time in Miami now, and there's a bunch of coin funders who are down here as well, a couple of folks in Boston and so forth, and generalist asset manager, like dedicated to Blockchain day. We do early stage investments out of our seed fund, which look at pre seed to series A. We just launched our venture fund, which looks at Series A and B, that's led by David Pakman, who joined our team from Venroc late last year. We have a liquid that's run by Seth Gins, our head of liquid investments at coin funds that's been up for over two years, looking at kind of more the high cap assets in the liquid markets.
00:09:07.078 - 00:09:33.060, Speaker B: And we've even worked on an NFT strategy called Metaversal, which is essentially like a venture studio for NFT creation and helping brands and IP owners go to market with NFTs. So we've done a lot of space for generalists and thesis driven and cover precede to be.
00:09:37.050 - 00:10:17.170, Speaker A: And Jake, maybe then tell us a little bit more about some of the investments you've all made. There's quite a few names in there that for me they're staples of my experience as a user. One in particular, I've been just more and more appreciative lately is Nftfi.com. It's really been one of the earliest lending and borrowing platforms, but these are the NFT plays. There's a lot of early players in crypto in general, and I would say specific to defi as well. But anyways, if you want to just highlight some of those investments.
00:10:18.150 - 00:11:13.854, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I see like the four crypto native verticals as DFI, NFT, Dows, web3 technology stack, and then additionally to that, we do invest in call enabling infrastructure for crypto. So these could very well be like traditional looking equity opportunities like coin list or block daemon that are providing incredibly needed and useful services for the decentralization space. Helps many, many networks out there run decentralized nodes on the network. Coin list obviously helps crowdfunding and capital formation in trading of digital assets as well. And so as a generalist, we've kind of covered the gamut. But I would say where have we operate? Well, we're thesis driven.
00:11:13.854 - 00:11:47.306, Speaker B: We try to identify where the technologies are going, what areas are likely to come about next, and really make it big, and we try to be early in those areas. So we were early to DFI. I think we did a number of DFI investments in Q three of 2018. And interestingly, we sort of like more concerned on DFI since then. We see a lot more mainstream markets in DFI than we actually do see today. That's a whole conversation. We're nfts, as you noted.
00:11:47.306 - 00:12:33.046, Speaker B: Part of the reason for that is actually I'm a digital artist, right? Besides being a technology, digital art throughout my life, I saw NFTs as essentially rare pepes on counterparty back in early 20. And I was there the day crypto came around Thanksgiving of 2017. Own one of the early from that. So I've been following the NFT space for a long time. We ended up becoming dapper Labs investors in 2018. We funded one of the earliest open minting platforms called additional, which is a whole interesting story in and of itself. We're preceders of rarible, you noted Nftfi.com,
00:12:33.046 - 00:13:13.190, Speaker B: which is one of our investments in NFT financialization. So I've done a lot of work there, which we can discuss about what does NFT financialization actually mean? What are the financial primitives of that area? And one of the primitives turns out to be price oracles for NFTs. For years people have said that fungibles very perfectly liquid asset class, but non fungibles NFTs never going to be liquid. That's so not true. If you can get oracles plugged into kind of creating appropriate. Sorry, creative.
00:13:13.870 - 00:13:31.310, Speaker A: That's so funny. She always pops her head in. She's working here too. And I just think it's funny because every time I'm like recording an interview and she's just like, I don't care, go get the trash. Anyways, sorry, Jake.
00:13:32.550 - 00:14:40.214, Speaker B: Hopefully she's bringing you a sandwich. So anyway, what I was saying is it turns out that if you can create a pricing that most people be willing to accept as general pricing for these, you can build a on top of that, you can loans, which you can take out absolutely automatically with NFTs as collateral, you can create short selling NFTs, you create indices, you can all kinds of subsequent financial primitives that turn NFTs into as much of a financial asset as it is a cultural or social asset. And we think that's really interesting. And we also think that it's much more broad applicable than just art, like just in game assets or just collectibles, which are the three main use cases of NFTs today. And then just to cover a couple of the other areas. Web three stack. When people say web, all kinds of things.
00:14:40.214 - 00:15:24.660, Speaker B: When I say web3, what I mean is the stack of technologies abling truly decentralized applications. When I say truly decentralized, I mean it's not just smart contracts that they're made out of. The front end is on a network. The domain name is a decentralized registrar of some kind, like maybe ENs or handshake or who knows? And this stack has been rapidly maturing as well, like it used to be. We need computation, we need storage. Those networks have built in. The web3 stack has actually been in middleware things like ceramic network in a decentralized way.
00:15:24.660 - 00:17:03.022, Speaker B: The graph which does indexing blockchain data so that front ends could be really polywrap that creates APIs helper can use to access anything in web3 from a blockchain to a d five protocol, you name it, like Kubel, which are again, helping people, like storage buckets. You hear a lot of people complaining like, hey, your NFTs aren't, they don't stored on a decentralized network, so they might get a certain point. Well, these middle are helping solve some of these problems. And finally, all those get aggregated up top, like just in the same way that you have Amazon providing technological and kind of the traditional world, in the same way like DWS, decentralized web services up different web3 services so that developers can start to choose web3 solutions for some of the problems they already have. Like want to store my business data in Amazon, or do I want to store my business data in a private, decentralized, secure network like Filecoin or something else? And then Daos is a huge topic. And I think you might know more than me about dows actually, because I do participate in a bunch. But I feel like that's a space that's still developing and it's kind of pre, its first big hype cycle.
00:17:03.022 - 00:17:48.814, Speaker B: But there's some really interesting thinking going on in that space. If you look at Orca protocol, they're talking about pods, which are mini daos of just a few people that can act in an agile, effective way. And then those pods can be interlinked together to create kind of like larger Dow organizations together toward a common goal. And so that's some of the most original thinking that I've heard in Dow world. And we're just at the beginning of that process. So those four areas, I've spent a lot in all of those areas, and we have investments in each to some extent. And people are always innovating.
00:17:48.814 - 00:17:55.220, Speaker B: There's always new technology coming onto the market, and we try to navigate that process.
00:17:57.770 - 00:19:29.614, Speaker A: Now, there's quite a few rabbit holes there. Like I'd love to go down, but sure, I think one that really stands out in light of the fact that we've experienced now, depending on what token you pick out, we're down, let's say 80% on something like ether or bitcoin, whatever, down much more on other tokens. So maybe we talk a little bit about the financialization of NFTs, and you pointed out what is some of the technology that's missing there? Because there's a few, if I were to dumb down for newcomers, some of the things you mentioned, first off, there's like this base layer sort of value to the fact that people like stuff, they like to collect stuff. Now, in the old world, that could have been art, it could have been a baseball card, it could have been Pokemon, whatever. In this new world, in web3 on chain, our NFTs are just stuff. And some of the most well known digital collectible stuff is like a crypto punk. What becomes increasingly more interesting I think is you have identified, I think me as well, that there's these financial use cases that we can bring to help those who have accrued value from some of their stuff to be able to access that liquidity.
00:19:29.614 - 00:20:04.670, Speaker A: And one of the examples we gave is what if you can borrow against an NFT like a punk? So I guess that's a more obvious example. But you called out some of the, and I want you to tell me now what are some of these technologies that are missing? I know pricing has been a big issue so yeah, I guess maybe we could start there. What is the issue with the inability to properly price NFT and then what are all those other use cases we're missing?
00:20:05.330 - 00:20:11.550, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. I could talk about this for a long time, so please stop me.
00:20:11.620 - 00:20:16.962, Speaker A: That's okay. If we talk about this for the next 20 minutes, we've accomplished something awesome.
00:20:17.096 - 00:21:37.498, Speaker B: So just before we dive in, let's just be very clear. The state of infrastructure in NFTs is like zero. It's like we've built virtually nothing. So despite the fact that the annualized GMV of the NFT space was rivaling the GMV of global art market sales, despite the fact that others are huge, despite the fact that nfts Saturday Night Live and everyone in the mainstream knows about it, despite the fact that there are billboards in like mentioning NFT collections and the highway to buy some, despite all of that, we're very much in version zero of all of the infrastructure in this space. Marketplaces for NFCs are not in their end state. There's going to be like millions and millions of marketplaces, monolithic marketplaces I don't think will continue to exist form that we've been used to for much longer. There's no corporate tools, even though there's a lot of enterprises and IP owners and large corporates like looking at the NFT space, we've seen Adidas, Nike do stuff in the space, no tools for such companies.
00:21:37.498 - 00:22:39.326, Speaker B: There's no way that a corporation can create an NFT strategy and get all the same marketing measurements that getting kind of like in web two, there's no NFT financial infrastructure yet. We're just at the beginning of that. And so messages, there's still so much to do. But what's at least to me is like the problems are well understood. And so one of these like of non fungibles versus fungibles is liquidity. I mean, I always say, even if you just rewind, I don't know, maybe two and a half, three years ago, if you were a founder who was trying to launch a token, your generation of liquidity for that token was like, oh, it'll come in about a year. When I managed to get it listed on binary, your lead time was a year.
00:22:39.326 - 00:23:36.846, Speaker B: And then in this 2020, and we had these, I think it started with synthetics launching the first liquidity mining programs. And then really Dexes starting off, then what we saw was that the liquidity for Ethereum token went from like a year to 24 hours, right, in a day after launching a liquidity mining, have a couple of dollars of daily liquidity. And that's amazing. That's a demonstration of how mechanisms, how blockchain based can actually solve these problems of liquidity. Now, even though people saw that happen, they would still turn to the NFT space and say, look, this is a different asset, works differently. You have to find a buyer for this thing, for your NFT. That's how you achieve liquidity through like peer to peer matching.
00:23:36.846 - 00:25:06.666, Speaker B: But what they kind of missed in that view is that just like we applied to the problem of fungible liquidity, we could apply mechanisms to solve various strategies to solve the problem of non fungible liquidity. And in fact, I wrote a whole article about this, I think about January of 21, right, which is appraisal games and the NFT liquidity problem, it's on medium. And what this article talks about is that there's all these different ways that you could create appraisals for NFTs and put those prices on chain. And if you do, then you're going to actually create conditions where liquidity can be achieved much more easily. Even if you're transacting peer to peer, if someone tells you like, hey, defi dad, this NFT is probably fairly priced at around five ether, even if that number isn't totally what someone would pay for it in the future. But ballpark, that gives you as a buyer so much more confidence that you feel like avoiding kind of getting scammed or something, or buying the wrong thing, or just mispricing something and being efficient with your capital. So just the idea that we can have reference prices next to NFTs out there is in and of itself a huge boon for NFT liquidity in the world of peer to peer marketplaces.
00:25:06.666 - 00:25:54.222, Speaker B: But it gets even better than that. Once we have those prices on chain, then you could do things like, hey, why don't I create a smart contract that will just buy your NFT from you at the reference price. And we trust these prices like reasonably fair. And so now you're in a world where if you have NFTs, it's an emergency. You got everything like right now have this new opportunity of how to do that. You go to the smart contract, quit your portfolio to reference of your assets, huge innovation. And then as we said, you can go into automated, like use NFT as collateral to get a real and buy a house.
00:25:54.222 - 00:26:59.534, Speaker B: There's actually a funding that's doing that, right. You're going to be able to take some of your crypto, give it to the company and using the yields that they generate from your digital assets, they can help you offset your mortgage rate, right, and get you a better deal on your home. But what is required in order to be able to use your crypto punk or your board ape or your pock, one of one, whatever your NFT is, what is that as collateral? Well, you need to know how to value the thing, right? So in the year and a half since I wrote that piece on media, we've actually seen one particular approach really come out in being the most practical and actionable way that we can create NFT prices. And those are actually machine learning models. We co led a company called Upshot. Upshot IO. What upshot is working on is machine learning for different NFT series.
00:26:59.534 - 00:27:55.494, Speaker B: Check out there's many more companies now sort of taking this approach deep. A friend of mine, Nick Yakovenko runs that and he's cryptopunks and other series. There's something called nval.com which is taking a machine learning approach to not just NFTs but all kinds of. And there's a number of players there. And so when these companies this data onto the chain available to broader then and that process happening now, what we're starting to see is there's a lot more NFT out there. There's a lot more borrowing and lending going on in NFT world because these prices, the ability to do this, there's probably tens of financial applications we're not thinking of that use these price is for.
00:27:55.494 - 00:27:57.080, Speaker B: And we're just at the start of.
00:27:58.730 - 00:29:02.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean a few different use cases that came up over just the last week and some conversations. So I got to talk with Stephen from nftfi.com. And when you put up your, let's pretend you have a punk. Currently they only support listing a single NFT as collateral now, it's very likely, fingers crossed, it'll happen this year, next year that you'll be able to have a basket of NFTs pending some eip that's in progress. So that right there we're progressing from one NFT to many, which gives us a more similar experience to what DeFi users enjoy with the likes of AAVE or compound. When you go to list it, it provides you with upshot. And I think pricing data from Opensea, I think it's like whatever was the last sale price of that NFT.
00:29:02.170 - 00:30:32.322, Speaker A: Either way, you're getting a few different pieces of pricing data. And that again is really interesting because despite the fact that the markets are less efficient with NFTs and what we all believe it will be in the near and long term future, these are just enormous improvements for us to be that much more well informed and obviously for, I think, more players to enter the space and help us to make a more efficient market. One use case that came up not too long ago was just, and I can't remember the name of the team, we didn't get a chance to invest in them, but they were going to build a perps exchange based on the floor price of different NFTs. And I thought that's really cool, because now someone can get exposure to the ups and downs of NFTs that you might not be able to afford or you can hedge. Obviously, you could be holding a punk. And whether you think of it priced in ETH or USD or whatever, you can begin to hedge in a down market depending on, again, what sort of value you want to protect. These are just simple sorts of use cases that have a strong parallel in DeFi, and then those have strong parallels to traditional finance.
00:30:32.322 - 00:31:19.460, Speaker A: And at the end of the day, I think this is all about, it's empowering those who are early to collect and enjoy what is the very nascent world of NFTs, the ability to be able to access that liquidity, to be able to continue to see it maybe as a store of value. That's a beautiful sort of end goal here. But Jake, any other technologies? We talked quite a bit there about pricing, and I'm conscious we probably have about five minutes here. But any other technologies in terms of NFT financialization that you're really excited to see built during this bear market?
00:31:20.870 - 00:32:23.978, Speaker B: Well, I think the other part of financialization thesis at Coin fund is that there's going to be tokenization of assets as nfts. So what I always say is we're living a little bit in a biased view where the vast majority of the NFTs we kind of see out there in the market, they really just fall into three categories, art and collectibles. And in fact, crypto art was sort of the thing that nfts mainstream. And now its market share is more along the lines of like 16%. And actually, most of the things that are traded are crypto native collectibles, like PFPs and things like that. Now, part of our broader thesis is that we think NFTs are not applicable just to those three areas. We can also tokenize things like fonts, icons, like stock photos, like movies, like music.
00:32:23.978 - 00:33:05.986, Speaker B: And really all digital content should at some point at least try to go on chain as nfts. And some of this content has never been monetized in this way before. Like, the great example that I always give is what Mirror XYZ is doing with writing blog posts. Blog posting is not an activity that has been successfully monetized in the past. So there is a business model for blog posts. It's advertising. Probably a tiny percentage of blog posts actually make sort of move the needle type of return through advertising.
00:33:05.986 - 00:33:59.290, Speaker B: And if you talk to a writer, most writers will know that writing the primary way that they make money, they'll probably make a post and put it online. But that blog post is usually a loss leader for them, doing things like consulting and making money in other ways. And so when you look at what Mirror XYZ is doing, they're actually new monetization models for lots never been tokenized before that have never really been an asset before. They've never traded on secondary markets. And the way this looks is that actually today, if you create a post on mirror, like by default, there's a few NFTs that are issued around that post, and people can collect your NFTs to sort of own a limited edition version of the post. And that's one model that's possible. There's many models that are possible.
00:33:59.290 - 00:35:30.900, Speaker B: We've seen, like token based crowd funds, the research that goes into writing the, we've seen combinations of tokens and NFTs and things like that. So one of the reasons is so exciting is because blog posts are actually a really widespread form of digital content Internet. And it's kind of exciting that for the first time ever, we can tokenize these things, have them trade and acquire real crypto markets. And it represents really like kind of an IPO, right? Like an IPO for blog posts. So as an investor that gets my gears turning around, what other disruptive things are we going tokenize? And the conclusion that I kind of come to is all non fungible goods and most goods in the world are non fungible. So it's like when you start pile up the addressable market FT financialization, what you start to realize is that you're talking about ten trillions of dollars of value because it includes real estate, it includes the title to your car, it includes all digital content that has been monetized in the past and also content that hasn't ever been monetized. And altogether, NFT financialization is a huge space that I think will play out over the next probably like five to ten years.
00:35:31.670 - 00:35:46.074, Speaker A: That's just a few more rapid fire questions for you just so we can wrap up here in just a few minutes. First off, what's your favorite use case that's yet to be realized? This bear market or over the course.
00:35:46.112 - 00:35:47.818, Speaker B: Of the whole space, few years?
00:35:47.904 - 00:36:01.070, Speaker A: Yes, across the whole NFT related. Sorry, let's stick to NFTs. What's one of your favorite use cases? Could be early or something that you haven't seen even launch.
00:36:01.970 - 00:36:53.606, Speaker B: So like I started talking about this in terms of marketplaces. What you see happening right now is that everyone in NFT infrastructure to launch the issuance and exchange protocols. In other words, a lot of the NFT exchange has been on very much centralized marketplaces like, you know, others. And what you're starting to see now is that rarible protocol is launching OpenSeA is launching Seaport foundation launched a protocol reservoir. Protocol is a protocol for helping people exchange NFTs. And so you're starting to see this like protocolization, NFT exchange layer. Why is that happening? Well, there's only reason why you want that structure.
00:36:53.606 - 00:37:42.474, Speaker B: It's because you're anticipating that in the future, millions and millions of different NFT marketplaces. That's the architecture for that. And why is that happening? Well, it's because, like I said, if NFTs are going to be such a huge variety of different verticals, anything from art to real estate, we've even seen biotech, investment NFTs and crazy stuff like that. You can't have all of these things live on the same marketplace. They're different experiences. Right? Like the experience of buying a car is very different than the experience of looking at one of one art from a particular artist. And so it's now that people are going to want to white label different experiences in different marketplaces.
00:37:42.474 - 00:38:14.540, Speaker B: And that's what I've been waiting for. I've been waiting for essentially the segmentation of marketplaces. Rarible has launched a bunch of white labels protocol is launching a bunch of white labels. You can think of it as like a shopify use case where, let's say Defi dad issues his own NFT collection. You can go and have your marketplace just for your NFTs. And in fact it's Jake market and it's built on reservoir protocol. So you can check out what I mean.
00:38:14.990 - 00:38:15.818, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:38:15.904 - 00:38:16.700, Speaker B: How about.
00:38:18.990 - 00:38:31.120, Speaker A: What'S one of the biggest misconceptions about NFTs for outsiders? What's something you wish more understood on the outside?
00:38:32.950 - 00:39:32.180, Speaker B: That it's a big ponzi scheme, I think would be like the of sort of complaint from the outside world. Some people even, well, you can have PFP collections, but you can create infinite amounts, infinite numbers of PFP collections, or you can create infinite numbers of gen art series. So doesn't that mean that the value of all these things because of this infinite supply, doesn't that mean it's going to all going to go to zero? And my answer to that is like, well, these are just brands. So if you apply that same argument to brand, is it true that all brand value is going to zero? And the answer is no, because brands have communities and it's those communities and communities of customers that make them really valuable. And the same is true for.
00:39:34.310 - 00:40:04.446, Speaker A: And then one last question. What do you think is one of the more common mistakes that folks make during a bear market or crypto winter? And this can pertain to those who maybe are more into just collecting nfts, or it could be someone who's further down the Defi rabbit hole. But more generally speaking, as a crypto investor, what do you think is one of the most common mistakes that we.
00:40:04.468 - 00:40:29.026, Speaker B: Make, not being long term oriented. Right. So the common mistake you make in a bull market is that you think you're biased to think that everything is just going to keep going up. I can't sell anything. Everything is going to go up. I'm going to make a five X tomorrow. And the mistake that you make is that you don't put aside cash, you don't derisk your position, you don't put aside cash for when that crash inevitably happens and you go into the bear market mode.
00:40:29.026 - 00:41:12.560, Speaker B: So the bear market mistake is the opposite of that mistake. It's not having the cash from that bull market to invest in the items bear market that are really cheap and attractive. And it's like failing to risk failing a little bit of your trading discipline. And really it's a failure of long term. So if you're truly to blockchain you will manage your risks during these different periods where you'll derisk bull markets and then you will buy into subsequently best performing assets during the bear market.
00:41:13.490 - 00:41:56.638, Speaker A: Yeah, well said. I think we as like a herd tend to, we assume the market can just keep going in those bull runs. And then during the bear market, you think the worst. You lose sight of all the sort of long term conviction that was talked about during bull runs. And I think right now, even if someone failed to take profits, I think there's just all sorts of ways you can find to really make the most of this time, which I would recommend to anyone. Go find a job full time, work in the space. It's a little bit volatile, but I can say it's been like the greatest return on investment.
00:41:56.638 - 00:42:25.900, Speaker A: Anyways, Jake, thanks so much for your time. I want to remind everyone they should follow you and coin fund here on Twitter.
