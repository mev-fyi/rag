00:00:18.170 - 00:01:29.990, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad. I want to walk you through a new tool that launched in the last few months, but more recently added a very important option to be able to bridge ether. So hop is a bridge that allows you to move between Ethereum, l one, the Ethereum main net, and these different networks, whether you label them l two, s, side chains, blockchains, whatever you want to call them. The point is each one of these, and this doesn't include all the other networks that have lots of defi activity happening on them, or lots of defi applications built on them. The point is that people are depositing their money onto these networks and they want to be able to transact there. But there are opportunities across these different networks, and so it's logical that they are going to want to be able to move their money between these different networks. So the big development over the last 24 hours is hop added the ability to bridge ether.
00:01:29.990 - 00:02:09.666, Speaker A: So prior to this, you had to use stablecoins or matic. And given the number of people holding ether that are using DeFi, this is a great development that is going to allow someone to be able to move their capital from, again, ethereum, l one, or between these different networks. So you could hop from, let's say, optimism to arbitrum and so on. Optimism. I currently have 0.5 e. If I were to send this, I would pay this much in fees.
00:02:09.666 - 00:03:03.698, Speaker A: The reason that this is so valuable is there are longer withdraw periods for these different networks. If you use Polygon, it takes about 45 minutes on average to withdraw. With arbitrum, I believe it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours, is, I think, the most I've waited. And then optimism takes about seven days. And then I believe Xdize actually is about as quick as polygon, depending on what bridge you use. So, point is, hop is making it easy now for us to be able to move ether from one of these networks to another. Now, this presents two opportunities.
00:03:03.698 - 00:04:24.314, Speaker A: One is I could just move my money, so in this case I could move my ether from optimism to arbitrum faster. And I believe it's cheaper for me to go this route versus having to trade into stablecoins and let's say, move it back to the Ethereum main net, where I would be paying high gas, and of course have to wait a longer period, waiting that amount of time. The second opportunity though, that I really want to cover is for anyone that is holding ether, it allows me to be able to earn yield on that ether while remaining 100% exposed to the price of ether. So if I want to be an LP for, let's say, ether on any one of these four networks to support the hot bridge, which means that the more people that are bridging their ether between these networks and Ethereum l one, obviously the more fees I earn, hence the more yield I earn. I can expect that if I put in, let's say, 0.5 ether, based on the fact that I'm earning fees, I should walk away with more than 0.5 ether.
00:04:24.314 - 00:05:29.726, Speaker A: So I would argue that for anyone that holds ether and simply wants to earn more of it, it's a great opportunity. And so you can see here the estimated APR, and this is based on just the last 24 hours, I think, of volume that has bridged between the different networks available here, including Ethereum main net and optimism, I would be earning an average of 6.7%. So I'm going to walk through how I would approach adding liquidity, putting my ether into this bridge and earning yield on it. All right, so before I walk through how I would become a liquidity provider, I want to also just remind you how I would move my money between these different networks. So I just happen to have 0.5 ether on optimism. Let's say that there's a farm or application that I want to participate in on arbitrum.
00:05:29.726 - 00:06:06.362, Speaker A: So I can do that faster and cheaper by using hop. So I could put in, let's say, 0.4 e, and you can see that I'm going to pay a small fee here, 0.6, which is, I think around like 1% still. So if I were going to send this money from optimism to Arbitram, I would hit send. I can confirm here, I'll follow the metamask prompt. It's a single transaction, because just like on Ethereum mainnet, if I'm using ether, I don't have to do any sort of approval transaction.
00:06:06.362 - 00:06:51.490, Speaker A: And so I can see the estimated gas fee. This all looks good. Reminder, I'm on optimism at this point. So that's why all of this is much cheaper and I'm paying a pretty insignificant gas fee compared to what I would pay on L one. And then if I wanted to confirm this, if I wanted to send this, I would hit confirm. For right now, I'm going to go ahead and actually keep my money on optimism because I want to walk through what it looks like for me to become a liquidity provider. Before I become a liquidity provider, I want to go to the pool tab and play around with the different networks to find out where I might earn the most yield.
00:06:51.490 - 00:07:33.774, Speaker A: So I might speculate that we're going to see more volume bridging to arbitram just because of all the applications lately. But I also could speculate with all of the value that's locked up in Polygon and all of the applications there, that that might also be a great place to provide liquidity. So let's just take a look at both. So if I go to Polygon, I can see that the APR here is around 27.7%. So it's obviously really high. This is denominated in ether. So this is me putting in ether and then earning ether.
00:07:33.774 - 00:08:03.900, Speaker A: So 27.7% is pretty high. If that were to hold, which I would argue there's probably been a spike in volume just because this bridge just became available to transfer ether. But anyways, that's one to consider. And then let's look at arbitram with arbitrum. Let's see if it spits out an estimate. Let's put in, if I put in one ETH, actually, let's put in another.
00:08:03.900 - 00:08:57.580, Speaker A: Okay, there we go. So it's saying that I might earn, and again, this is based on just the last 24 hours, 3.14% APR. Now, the other thing to consider here, aside from where do I want to put my liquidity, is it in the hot bridge on polygon? Is it the hot bridge that exists on, let's say, arbitrum? I also want to consider what tokens I would be depositing so I can mint or trade for what's called hop ETH. So that's their pegged version of ether here. It's part of what allows for this bridging mechanism to work. Or I could put in both tokens, or I could put in a different ratio of the two.
00:08:57.580 - 00:10:14.358, Speaker A: Hop makes it easy for me to deposit whatever amount of either token here I want, but it will affect what amount of the pool I end up owning. So obviously, the greater share of the pool, the more yield I earn. So if I have the option, if I'm starting, let's say, with ether on Ethereum main net, I might consider, should I be minting this hop ETH, or should I be acquiring the arbitram version of ether? Arbitram weath here, which one makes more sense? And you can quickly figure this out. Like, if I'm like, hey, I've got two of this, the arbitram weath. You can see the price impact is negative, whereas if I put in two of the hop ETH, I actually get some positive slippage. So I'm getting more of the pool than what I would get otherwise. Now let's hop over to.
00:10:14.358 - 00:10:58.610, Speaker A: Let's hop and hop over to the convert tab. Let's pretend that I am starting on Ethereum mainnet. So let's switch this to ethereum mainnet and let's refresh this. Here we go. Okay, so there's two options here. It makes the most sense if I'm starting on ethereum l one. So let's cover this profile first.
00:10:58.610 - 00:12:04.746, Speaker A: I'm on ethereum l one and I want to become a liquidity provider, let's say on arbitrum or actually let's just do optimism. So I'm going to use the hop bridge. So I'm going to choose this option via hop bridge to send my ether from the ethereum main net to optimism. And I'm basically minting this hop ETH. So if I were to do that, you can see here, actually, let's just use the balance I have. I'm going to be sending my ether from Ethereum mainnet to optimism and minting this hop ETH on the optimism network. Then I will be able to take the h ETH and go to the pool tab under optimism and put in, let's say it'll be zero thirty nine point four h e and that's it.
00:12:04.746 - 00:12:47.190, Speaker A: That'll be the steps that I would follow here. However, let's pretend that I'm already on optimism, which was actually the case with my own funds there. Let's go back to optimism. So because I have 0.5 ETH already on the optimism network, I don't need to use this option of via hot bridge. I've already got my funds on an L two, which is optimism. So I'm going to choose via Amm and then I will use my ether, my 0.5
00:12:47.190 - 00:13:16.080, Speaker A: here, and I will swap it to hop ETH. So then I'll have, in this case, just because of the trading rate, I'll have a little bit less in terms of hop ETH. Also worth noting, I don't want to spend all of that. I want to make sure I keep some of my ether so that I can pay fees on optimism. So I'm going to just do 0.4 e. So I'll go ahead and approve this.
00:13:16.080 - 00:14:07.012, Speaker A: So in this case, I'm approving the ability to spend my wrapped ether, or whatever version of ether you want to call it, that is on optimism. So I'm giving unlimited permission. This would be if I plan to move more ether into hop in the future, however, there is the risk of if I do this and there was some sort of unforeseen event where someone was able to gain control of those smart contracts, they could then drain my wallet on optimism of that ether. So I'm actually just going to put in the custom limit. Instead of 0.4, I'm just going to use the suggested fee. At this time.
00:14:07.012 - 00:14:28.450, Speaker A: There is an arbitram gas station that you can check. And here we go. All right, there we go. Already approved. Love being on L two s. It's much easier than l one. Okay, so I'm ready to go ahead and convert this.
00:14:28.450 - 00:15:14.272, Speaker A: So let's convert this to hop ETH. All right, let's check the gas price. That looks good. All right, so let's go ahead and convert this. Okay, so that's confirmed as well. So now you can actually see the balance update. I still have about zero nine ether, which is great because I need that to be able to pay fees on optimism, just like on Ethereum.
00:15:14.272 - 00:15:52.360, Speaker A: L one, I use ether to pay my fees, but now I have almost 0.4 hop ETH. So let's go back to the pool and I'm going to choose optimism. I am adding liquidity to be an ETH liquidity provider. I am going to not add any of my optimism ether just so I can keep it to potentially pay fees while I do other things there. And then I'm going to put in the maximum amount of my hop ether. I'm getting a little bonus.
00:15:52.360 - 00:16:38.988, Speaker A: But then again, I just lost a little bit trading for that hop ether. And reminder, too, if you're starting out with that optimism ETH, I could have just come here and just added it like I didn't have to trade for it. I just kind of want to demonstrate all the different ways that someone might go from having ether to having optimism ether or hop ether. So just TlDR on that is, if I have ether already on optimism, I can just come here and deposit it versus trading for hop ether. So I just did an extra step there. All right, so I'm ready to become a liquidity provider. So we'll add liquidity here.
00:16:38.988 - 00:17:05.540, Speaker A: I'm going to have to approve spending that hop ether just like I do with any other ERC 20 token. So I'll put in a custom limit again. So I'm going to allow it to spend up to 0.4 ether, which covers me here for today. Leave the gas price there. All right. And I'm ready to confirm.
00:17:05.540 - 00:17:32.316, Speaker A: There we go. Transaction is confirmed. And now I'm ready to add liquidity, which in this case is just hop ether. So I'll click add liquidity, check the gas price again. All right, looks good. And we're ready to confirm. And that is it.
00:17:32.316 - 00:18:05.656, Speaker A: I have confirmed that transaction. It's just so fast. I forget how much easier it is on l two. So you can see here, it shows that my position is 0.9% of the pool. I have now zero point 24 optimism ether, which is labeled weath, and then zero point 16 hop ether. I did a service for the pool by putting more hop ether, which it actually needs more of.
00:18:05.656 - 00:18:46.328, Speaker A: There was less of it than the optimism ether, which is also labeled wrapped ether. So this is a page that I would just come back to in the future. I do believe that zapper will integrate this eventually. I'd expect Xerion to do it as well. So, yeah, these are positions that I'll continue to monitor at app hop exchange, and I can check that under the pool tab and just check out my position here. So that's all there is to it. I hope you find this helpful.
00:18:46.328 - 00:19:49.072, Speaker A: I would remind anyone that there is risk here that I've taken, like the fact that I'm depositing my money, per usual, into smart contracts and there could be a smart contract bug. There's also risk in the fact that I'm holding exposure to pegged assets, which could potentially fail. Also, given how composable and interconnected all the defi money Legos are, I mean, this is one that is touching lots of different money Legos. So just be aware of that sort of systemic risk. And lastly, I am not fully aware of any sort of like centralized admin risk in hop exchange, but it is a rather new project. It's built by some OG builders in Ethereum who have worked on a smart contract wallet called authorium. Doesn't mean that I should blindly trust them because of that.
00:19:49.072 - 00:21:16.756, Speaker A: But for what it's worth, this is a team that has about as much experience as anyone building dapps in Ethereum. So I would imagine if there is any sort of centralized risk getting this off the ground, while this isn't a tokenized protocol yet, like, there is no token for hop, but my speculation is that a protocol like this could only thrive in the future with a token. So I would imagine that we'll see one eventually, and that's possibly another part of the opportunity here is as an early supporter of this protocol, I would guess that I'll probably see a reward at some point in the future, some sort of retroactive airdrop for supporting it, just like we've seen with basically every other DeFi protocol. A reminder, if you learned something from this, please subscribe@defydad.com. On my YouTube channel, there's lots more videos like this and lots of interviews with leading founders, builders, community members and investors. And then also, if you are building the next great DFI NFT web three application protocol infrastructure, please consider contacting my team at Fourthrevolution capital. We would love to work with you as we've worked with all of these teams and many more, to build the future of DeFi.
00:21:16.756 - 00:21:18.420, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in, everyone. Bye.
