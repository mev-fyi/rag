00:00:00.250 - 00:00:47.426, Speaker A: Today's show discusses the recent restaking mania we've seen unfold with Eigenlayer, as well as an easy way to earn Eigen layer restaking points while maintaining a liquid token called ETH by Etherfi. In this episode, we'll talk with Etherfi founder and CEO Mike Siligadza about the benefits we inherit by minting and holding Eeth as an all in one staking and restaking token. We are the first natively restaked liquid staking token. So the benefit of that is that when you stake with Etherfi and you meant e, which is our liquid staking token, it's automatically restaked. You don't need to do anything extra. It's automatically restaked, and you get the actual liquid staking token, which you can then use as Defi. So you deposited it to her into balancer fabric.
00:00:47.426 - 00:00:53.740, Speaker A: We want to be the easy button. You just hold the token and use it in D five and like everything is sort of taken care of.
