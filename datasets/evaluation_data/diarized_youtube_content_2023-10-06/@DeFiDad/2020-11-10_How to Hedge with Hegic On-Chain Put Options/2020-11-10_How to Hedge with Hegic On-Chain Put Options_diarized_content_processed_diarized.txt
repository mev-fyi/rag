00:00:18.430 - 00:00:58.130, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad. Today I'm going to show you how I use hedgek put options to hedge my long ETH position. So a little context. Ether has appreciated quite a bit in price over the last few years. So if we look at the low in December 2018, it was around 80, $85. And now it's up at $445. And so for those of us who have a long ETH position, we might want to hedge against the possibility of ether falling back to $350 or anything below $400.
00:00:58.130 - 00:02:14.502, Speaker A: So I'm just going to use this example, and I'm not recommending this as a strategy to anyone. This is, of course, never financial advice, but just for the sake of simplicity, in terms of giving an example that shows the power of using a put option. So we're going to talk all about how I can use an on chain put option powered by hedgek to hedge against the possibility of the ether price falling. So a quick example here is if I buy an ETH put option for one ETH, and let's pretend that the strike price, which is when I have the ability then to exercise this option, I'm going to put the strike price at the market price, which is about $444 right now, and the period of holding is one day. So I have one day to exercise an option to sell one ether, four die stablecoins at $444. Now, if you look here, the cost of it is going to be about $12.26, which means that at a strike price of 444 dollarsfifty $0.03,
00:02:14.502 - 00:03:11.418, Speaker A: if we subtract this from this, we get a break even price of $432.27. This means that if I'm holding this option for the next day, if the price of ether falls below this, I'm now profitable. It means that I could exercise the option and I could send ether in and I will get $432.27 of die. So you can begin to understand why this is a really popular instrument in finance, to be able to protect one's long position by using what's called a put option or the right to sell. You can also go the opposite way and buy a call option, which is the right to buy. And so I could be short and I want to protect that position and have the right to buy and cover my losses at a certain price.
00:03:11.418 - 00:03:48.834, Speaker A: Let's say that's higher than where we are in the market right now. So currently, if I were to buy a call option on ETH at 444 dollarsfifty $3 as the strike price. Then at a cost of $12.26. If ether rises above $456.79, I am then profitable. From there onward to the upside. What's worth noting about Hedgek is it has grown quite a bit in popularity over the last six months, but more notably since they launched their Hedgekick token.
00:03:48.834 - 00:05:09.826, Speaker A: So just be aware that total value locked has risen from just November 1 from 20 million to almost 38.2 million. Now, going back to the options basic git book that was created by Hedgek, which I would highly recommend checking out, it gives really simple explainers as to how options work and then how they work in the context of hedgic. So if we go back to the learn options basics in Hegek, you'll see here that the features of using DeFi options, so I mean to say on chain options that are built on Ethereum, these are non custodial options where it's just you interacting with a smart contract. And so like every defi money Lego, it gives me greater control, but it also allows me to work with really what's automated money software. So in this case, I'm throwing out the middlemen and I'm throwing out the centralized exchanges that I would buy options from and I'm simply interacting with Hedgek. So calling out some of what makes Hedgek so special is really what they've outlined here.
00:05:09.826 - 00:05:55.006, Speaker A: They're noncustodial, they trade 24/7 they are verified on chain. You can choose any strike price you want. So you notice here I could choose to make the strike price 400. Now notice that the further away the strike price is, and this is for a put. So this is the right to sell at $400, the total cost is actually dropping. So if I were to move this to, let's say $350, the total cost or the premium for this option keeps dropping. One thing I really like about Hedgek is that you are able to exercise them up until that expiration date.
00:05:55.006 - 00:06:45.258, Speaker A: So there are options where you would buy the option and then it settles at a date and time. And when that settles, you either make money or you've lost money. This is one where if the market moves in your favor, you can exercise at any moment. But again, easier said than done. Exercising is guaranteed because of liquidity that's locked up against these option contracts. Obviously with any DeFi protocol, the ones that I believe are building really valuable products and are working to create a lasting product, one that can outlive the team, those are censorship resistant. And just by the nature of using a defi product where you connect an Ethereum wallet.
00:06:45.258 - 00:07:33.806, Speaker A: There's no KYC, there's no email or registration required. Something I'm not going to talk about today, but is definitely worth checking out is the fact that you can provide liquidity for the wrapped bitcoin and ETH options. If you're interested in that, just go to Hedgek Co. Click on writers. So writing an option is a term that's used to mean that you're actually selling an option. So in this case you could be providing liquidity for the wrapped bitcoin pool or the ether pool. And so if I were to provide liquidity here for the ether pool, I could then go in and I could deposit, let's say one ether and that's all there is to it.
00:07:33.806 - 00:08:08.700, Speaker A: I'm going to get back a token that's called right ETH. And so I'm earning a portion of the premiums that are being paid by others who are buying put options and call options. So back to my original example. Let's say the market today is showing that ether is around $445. And I've got a long position. So I'm holding ether and I've been holding that for some time. And my concern is that the market could fall below, let's say $400.
00:08:08.700 - 00:08:41.750, Speaker A: So there's 400 ish right there. So I'm going to hedge that position or protect myself potentially from some losses if ether were to fall below it. And I'm going to buy an ETH put option on hedgek. So we go to Hedgek co. I click on connect wallet. If this isn't already the default option, make sure you click on holders. Then I'm going to scroll down to ether.
00:08:41.750 - 00:09:26.962, Speaker A: So I've got the option of wrapped bitcoin or ether options. So with Hedgek I could actually gain exposure to a bitcoin option, whether it's a put or a call. But for right now, I'm just going to focus on an ETH put option, which is the right to sell it. So if I were to buy one option contract at a strike price of the market price right now, which is 445 dollarsfifty $3. And if I hold that for, let's just say one day. So this is like the expiration date, except it's called a period of holding and that can be a day, seven days, 14 days, 21 days or 28 days. So if we put it in for a day, here's the cost that I'm going to pay.
00:09:26.962 - 00:10:09.394, Speaker A: This is the premium notice. If I were to extend this I pay more money. So this is all a standard part of pricing options. The longer the period of holding, the more costly it is. And then in terms of my strike price, if I were to move this down to let's say 400, the cost of this becomes less. So if I were to move this to let's say $350, I would then have to wait for the price of ether to fall to $350. And so I have up to one day then to exercise the right to sell my ether at $350.
00:10:09.394 - 00:11:33.520, Speaker A: So I would be betting on the price of ether moving below this point over the next 24 hours. So I'm going to put this back up to the market price. And so now I'm ready to buy that option contract because I am protecting my one ether for up to 24 hours assuming a strike price of 445 dollarsfifty $3 based on the cost of $12.29, 445 dollarsfifty $3 minus 1229 gives me a break even point of $433.24. So if I really am wanting to exercise that option over the next 24 hours, I won't be profitable until the price of ether is below $433.24. I'd also consider what is the cost of gas, the transaction for me to put that through? So maybe I assume it's going to be, I don't know, maybe $10 of gas considering the gas prices on Ethereum right now. So for me personally, I'm going to think about the break even point at around $420 or $423.
00:11:33.520 - 00:12:15.466, Speaker A: So we're going to click buy option contract, just double checking that I'm paying $12.30 which is the total cost or premium for the ETH put option, and then I'm paying $4.74 based on this gas price to put through the transaction. Now if I go to gasnow.org, it says that if I put it through at about 23 or 24, it should run the transaction in about a minute. So we'll go ahead and confirm it so we can track the transaction here on ether scan. Okay, so the transaction has gone through.
00:12:15.466 - 00:12:55.734, Speaker A: I paid $12.28 that was paid as a premium, which is what the liquidity providers are earning a portion of on hedgek and then to the ethereum network. I paid $3.0.15 as a transaction fee. So if we just scroll up, you can now see that my options contracts are here. I bought one option contract at a strike price of 445 dollarsfifty $3, the break even price point. So where I would actually be profitable is at $433.24.
00:12:55.734 - 00:13:42.054, Speaker A: It actually shows my profit and loss here. So I'm currently at negative twelve point $29, which is what I paid, that's the premium. And then this expires on November 10. So I've got 24 hours, exactly 23 hours till it expires. And if I want to exercise my option, which will be available whenever the price moves below the strike price of $445, I can just click that here. So I'm just going to assume that I probably won't be able to exercise this at the break even price within the next 24 hours. So let's assume that I am below the break even price though.
00:13:42.054 - 00:14:24.366, Speaker A: And if I do get below 433 dollarsthirthirty $0.08 because I am below the strike price of $445, I can then choose to exercise this. And you can see I'm still at a loss of $7.23 based on the premium that I paid for this put option. So if I click exercise, when you exercise an option, you actually receive the difference. So a while back you had to actually submit the corresponding ether for the option to be exercised. So you would send in one ether and you would get back that amount of die.
00:14:24.366 - 00:15:31.906, Speaker A: But now, thankfully the difference is calculated and so in this case I would receive 0.12 ETH and at this point I would still be down some because I'm not at that break even price. I am still accounting for some loss, having paid a premium of around $12. But as we inch closer and closer to this 433 dollarsthirty two cent mark, I get closer and closer to being break even and potentially profitable. So you can see here, it's just updated to now I'm at a loss of $9.21 because the price of ether moved up a bit and it's closer to that strike price. So I'm not going to exercise this, but if I were to, I would just hit confirm and then this is essentially like me claiming what's owed to me in terms of the difference for exercising the option and I would be receiving that small amount of ether.
00:15:31.906 - 00:16:18.466, Speaker A: But I'm going to go ahead and reject this and let this continue to play out over the next 24 hours or the next 18 hours that I have before this option expires. So let's talk through the risks of actually using hedge. You'll notice that at the top of hedgek it literally says use it at your own risk, do your own research. I would highly recommend checking out the hedgek git book for understanding how on chain non custodial options work. When you click on connect wallet. In this case, I'm connecting my metamask. You'll notice that the hedgek protocol contracts have been audited by Pexhield, which you can click on that and you can check out the audit.
00:16:18.466 - 00:17:02.466, Speaker A: Most of us aren't capable of reading an audit and really understanding in depth what sort of risk is underlying a protocol. So I would proceed with the usual sort of caution here. That hedgek has been a project that has quite a large following at this point. They have about 38 million in total value locked. That doesn't mean that I should deposit all of my money into it and blindly trust that nothing could ever happen to my funds. There's always risk of a smart contract bug. So you'll notice it says you can lose up to 100% of the amount that you will provide in liquidity pool contracts.
00:17:02.466 - 00:17:42.446, Speaker A: Never provide funds that you can't afford to lose. So usual advice from any sort of DFI application, but good to reiterate that and to actually click. I understand and agree. So aside from bugs, there's also financial exploits that could take place. A while back, Hedgek had been exploited for the ability to be able to withdraw your liquidity provider funds whenever you wanted. So there's now locks in place to prevent someone from just withdrawing liquidity and having to remain in the pool. And it just goes back to that idea of don't put in more funds than you're willing to lose.
00:17:42.446 - 00:19:07.994, Speaker A: The thing I like about options contracts is you're paying a smaller premium to protect a larger amount of money. So if I have an ETH put option here, again, I'm paying twelve point $29. As always, any DFI application that's exposed to wrapped bitcoin or to die, which ultimately is part of what's being held in the liquidity pool. In case you exercise an ETH put option, it means that the application in general is vulnerable to the risk of wrapped bitcoin or DAi, which DAi is a stable asset that is over collateralized. So there's risk there to consider. But then with wrapped bitcoin, not only do we have to worry about the peg potentially failing, which would be considered like a black swan event, we also have to be mindful of the fact that bitgo is a custodian, which means that there's a centralized risk to having exposure to wrapped bitcoin. However, I would remind anyone that if you're buying put options or call options for wrapped bitcoin, you clearly already have or want exposure to wrapped bitcoin, so it's not like it should prevent me from using hedge.
00:19:07.994 - 00:19:40.502, Speaker A: Just wanting to call that out as yet another risk to be mindful of. Okay, that's all I've got for you today. Thanks so much for watching. I hope this is a helpful introduction to on chain put options with Hedgic. If you haven't already, please follow me@defydad.com. It'll redirect you to this YouTube page, so defidad.com. Also, you can watch a daily defi live stream that I host for Zapper, which is where I work.
00:19:40.502 - 00:20:09.280, Speaker A: And you can learn from all of the different builders and founders that we've had on lately. Like the founder of pull together Curve Finance, we had the head of growth from Axie Infinity, Jeff, and we had the co founders of Dodo. So anyways, there's lots of interesting conversations there. We do a lot of screen sharing. I think it's really complementary to do here. For tutorials on defydad.com.
