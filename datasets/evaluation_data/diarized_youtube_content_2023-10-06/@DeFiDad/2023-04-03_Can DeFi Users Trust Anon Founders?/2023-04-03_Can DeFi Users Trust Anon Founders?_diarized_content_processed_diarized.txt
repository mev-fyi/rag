00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.414, Speaker UNK: I wanted to ask point blank, why.
00:00:02.452 - 00:00:46.162, Speaker A: Should users trust an anonymous builder? Yeah, the answer is they shouldn't trust me. So, for example, we have no access of all the funds in the divolt. Some people know the contracts are upgradable, but there is a two week time lock, which gives you more than enough time to withdraw. In any case, if there was a malicious update, pushed much. And for the genes, token minting, for example, adding a new minting role is delayed by more than 24 hours. So you will have time to sell before if you saw that a malicious contract will be given a minting role. So, yeah, basically we tried to minimize trust everywhere.
00:00:46.306 - 00:00:49.026, Speaker B: And I also think there's almost like a lindiness.
00:00:49.138 - 00:00:49.950, Speaker A: To a.
00:00:49.980 - 00:00:56.780, Speaker B: Anonymous builders. It's almost like there's a certain amount of time that passes where people just are like, okay, like they've built up a level of trust.
