00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.310, Speaker A: So there's just this enormous demand for GPUs. And yes, on the surface there is a shortage. You know, the demand for GPUs in the cloud is 25 exaflops and the supply in the cloud is ten. But what the market doesn't see is there's this whole sort of like hidden layer of supply. You've got things like independent data centers that are running. There's thousands of these in the US alone. They're running at twelve to capacity.
00:00:26.310 - 00:01:09.810, Speaker A: You've got all these crypto mining farms that are just like bleeding profitability, that are looking to put their hardware to work. And then you have consumer GP, and so there's all these sort of sources, and that's kind of where Ionet comes in. We can, as a dpen, we're not constrained, so we can go out and we can aggregate and sort of instantly solve problems. And really what that does, and I'm sure we'll touch on this more, is we're creating structural arbitrage, right? It's the same thing that Uber did for taxis or Airbnb did for hotels. By bringing more supply online, you're effectively able to simultaneously decrease prices by ten times and increase profits for supply.
00:01:12.230 - 00:02:14.806, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's show covers a state of the art decentralized computing network called I o Net. I o Net is an industry leader in the fast growing web3 sector known as decentralized physical infrastructure network, aka deepen. With the rise of AI and the growing demand for more GPUs in the public cloud, obtaining access to distributed computing resources presents several challenges, including limited availability, rising costs, and a lack of choice. In this episode, we'll discuss how IO net solves for these problems by aggregating GPUs from underutilized sources such as independent data centers, crypto miners, and crypto projects such as Filecoin and render, we'll dive into how they offer engineers an airbnb like marketplace to share and access massive amounts of computing power in a system that is accessible, customizable, cost efficient, and easy to implement. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.
00:02:14.806 - 00:02:48.786, Speaker B: For most of us, our crypto journey started with Metamask. And now with Metamask portfolio, we can do so much more. Metamask portfolio puts you in control.

00:03:40.030 - 00:04:23.030, Speaker D: Everybody at this point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your staked ETH mint, a liquid staking token, and then use that token in defi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, oracle networks, other blockchains and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH.
00:04:23.030 - 00:04:49.174, Speaker D: In DeFi, we are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with liquid restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols, and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:04:49.302 - 00:04:54.940, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:04:56.990 - 00:05:38.550, Speaker E: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up, the first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas. One gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:05:39.130 - 00:05:50.650, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce the founder and CEO of IO Net, Ahmad Shadid, as well as the COO and CFO, Tori Green. Ahmad and Tori, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:05:50.720 - 00:05:54.138, Speaker F: Thank you so much. Shalom. Fireman of moving at the speed of flies.
00:05:54.234 - 00:05:56.670, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. Very excited to be here.
00:05:56.740 - 00:06:52.618, Speaker B: So we're really excited to get to talk with you because I have viewed I o net as really a trailblazer in this emerging sector at the intersection of crypto, web3 and AI. And we recently got to watch Tori's talk at breakpoint, and it had us really digging in trying to understand this decentralized compute network that you're building and all the implications of it. So today we're going to give a very comprehensive overview of all that you've been building and some of the products that might stem from what you're building in the future. And so normally we like to start with just a little bit more about your background. So maybe let's go with Ahmad first. Can you share anything more about what were you working on prior to IO net? What kind of drew you to this intersection of crypto and AI?
00:06:52.714 - 00:07:18.710, Speaker F: Yeah, I appreciate it. Yeah, I was doing Quant. I'm a quant systems engineer for the last seven years. Been building quant systems for a few private equities. And I had my own fund trading 1000 stock every day and more than 150 cryptocurrency day trading. The strategy was really interesting. It was basically trying to detect whenever there's like institutions trying to fill orders in the market and hide it.
00:07:18.710 - 00:07:31.450, Speaker F: And then I built a whole machine learning model on that and then scaled that 2000 stock and 150 crypto and was really doing very well. And yeah, that's mostly what I was doing.
00:07:31.520 - 00:07:43.138, Speaker B: And Tori, can you add to that? I'd love to get a little bit more about what else have you worked on in this space and what led you to start working on IO net?
00:07:43.224 - 00:08:28.720, Speaker A: Great question. So, going back a little bit, I've had a couple of different careers. Started off life sort of more corporate, did banking thing, private equity, corporate strategy. And then I moved into web two, was actually a co founder of a digital publishing firm in BC for about seven years. And during my tenures at BC, I really started off more as sync partner and moved to be an operating. So that means I was helping out our portfolio companies, sales, marketing, finance, operations, strategy, things like. I had one role, which was one of my last roles, where I spent almost two years as COO CRO and CFO of Hum Capital, which is machine learning.
00:08:28.720 - 00:09:04.758, Speaker A: During that time, I really sort of started to understand the AI space and the problem spacing at the same time. I had been very personally interested in crypto since 2016. I've written quite a bit about it on medium, Twitter, even tried to write a book. I don't know if many people have read it, but it's sort of always been like an intellectual interest for me. And I always wanted to make the jump. But the problem that I kept noticing was I saw a lot of solutions looking for problems, especially in the deep end space. I felt like deep ends were, they weren't solving real problems.
00:09:04.758 - 00:09:39.710, Speaker A: And so when I saw Ionet, I was like, wow, this is a deep end. Solving a herald and fire problem. Which source? And so I reached out to Ahmad, and instantly, I think that's where my VC background came in. I've talked to hundreds of founders, and I saw the qualities that make a great founder extremely intelligent, visionary, and perhaps most importantly, he has that it factor, that sense of urgency, that drive to move fast. And so I said, hey, man, I want to start helping you out, and started working with him a bit. We had great chemistry. And I said, you know what, this is my opportunity.
00:09:39.710 - 00:09:44.054, Speaker A: I think this is it. A little over three months ago, joined full time guys.
00:09:44.092 - 00:10:05.898, Speaker C: I was wondering if one of you, maybe before we get into I o net, could just break down the term deepen for us. We're seeing that obviously crop up a lot lately over the last six months or so. And what better experts to talk about it than you two? So whoever wants to kind of just dive into what that definition means and just break that down for our audience.
00:10:06.074 - 00:11:12.062, Speaker F: Sure. I guess deepen for me is a collective of people that are trying to replace current infrastructure that's already running or broken through, investing in hardware, and then there's some kind of token in the middle to incentivize these parties to do it. I don't know if it's like reading from a book, but kind of like abstracting it to the minimum. But if you look at it, think about it, look at all the infrastructures in the world, like 5G, helium bringing people, buying some hotspots, routing 5G through people, broadcasting five G and allowing five G to go through, and kind of replacing telecom, whatever the way they are, even bringing the 5G into the 5G router, it doesn't matter. But I mean, the concept is that you are providing some hardware to participate in a network that if this network collectively have all this hardware, it could really bring value to people. Look about it for GPUs. A lot of people are building mining farms.
00:11:12.062 - 00:11:36.250, Speaker F: I guess Ethereum was the best, and bitcoin is the best deep end, actually, because really, bitcoin is the best deep end. I mean, I visited a mining facility for a big company in Austin, $1.3 billion bitcoin mining. ASIC miners, huge. That's the real deep end. This is the first deep end. And I kind of like the market circulating back to what is really matter.
00:11:36.250 - 00:12:08.962, Speaker F: Hardware. Real infrastructure that's not just in the wind. Things that are in the ground, maybe not real estate and not real land, but at least while they are on top doubts, is a real asset that you could touch with your hand. And I think mixing that with crypto in a way like bitcoin did is very smart. And that's actually what is really deep. And it's bringing people who are bringing all these asic miners to make this network work, whether this is efficient or not, it's another question here. But as of an architecture as a concept that actually is a deepen, it's not really hard to grasp.
00:12:09.026 - 00:12:28.682, Speaker B: Why do you think deepen has found a home, this next generation of deepen? If we're going to call bitcoin and Ethereum, like early examples of this, why is it as a sector growing so much now on Solana? Like, what about Solana makes it prime for deep pin protocols to grow?
00:12:28.816 - 00:13:14.762, Speaker F: I can't talk for others, but at least from my point of view, is we don't want to build the blockchain yet, and we want to. Well, first of all, before everything, community like, people are very friendly, you could easily get help and you could easily grow within this community. And you feel like you're brotherhood in a way. That's one thing that Solana really has, plus huge investors. That's first. And then the second is you have amazing tools that allows you to use the blockchain, to do microtransactions, to store data, some part of data, and so on. That really helps you in focusing first on building the product, but at the same time have all the features that Solana has and utilize whatever you need from it.
00:13:14.762 - 00:13:23.470, Speaker F: It's really easy and simple, and the community is very huge. And I'm a Solana guy since $1.5.
00:13:23.620 - 00:14:08.938, Speaker A: I think to add to that, when I think about deep end, it's really getting at what the art of crypto is about. And I think someone from Gartner said this is what blockchains are made for, especially when you look at the GPU space, you really see an oligopoly dominating it. And anytime you have that extract, very high. So number one, deep end breaks the oligopoly. Number two, it's just technically better, right? It doesn't matter what it's a deep end in, but if you look at GPUs, AWS, GCP, Azure, they're physically constrained, but with a deep end, you can scale almost infinitely. And as you scale, the network gets better and more redundant. So it's really just a win win.
00:14:09.104 - 00:14:39.630, Speaker C: And something Tori mentioned in that breakpoint presentation that we referenced earlier is just with all these oligopolies buying up all the resources, there's a shortage kind of, for everybody else. So I kind of see this as a bit disintermediating that. And, I don't know, kind of like getting more supply into the market. Is that fair to say? Or maybe how would you guys kind of frame up the problem right now? And that GPU shortage that we're seeing.
00:14:39.720 - 00:15:16.098, Speaker A: So I don't think there is a shortage, and I'll get into why in a second. At a high level, there's a shortage. And to sort of understand the shortage, you have to really understand what GPUs do, right? And this is very basic level, but GPUs power AI, right, they're used to build, optimize and deploy machine learning models. There's been just tremendous demand for this. The compute requirements are doubling every 3.4 months. And so I think, like chat, GPT-3 took 500,000 times longer to build than previous models a decade ago.
00:15:16.098 - 00:15:43.690, Speaker A: So there's just this enormous demand for GPUs. And yes, on the surface there is a shortage. The demand for GPUs is 25 exaflops and the supply in the cloud is ten. But what the market doesn't see is there's this whole sort of like hidden layer of supply. You've got things like independent data centers that are running. There's thousands of these in the US alone. They're running at twelve to 18% capacity.
00:15:43.690 - 00:16:28.530, Speaker A: You've got all these crypto mining farms that are just like bleeding profitability, that are looking to put their hardware to work. And then you have consumer GPUs, and so there's all these sort of sources, and that's kind of where Ionet comes in as a deepen. We're not constrained, so we can go out and we can aggregate all these underutilized sources and sort of instantly solve problems. And really what that does, and I'm sure we'll touch on this a bit more, is we're creating structural arbitrage, right? It's the same thing that Uber did for taxis or Airbnb did for hotels. By bringing more supply online, you're effectively able to simultaneously decrease prices by ten times and increase profits for supply.
00:16:28.610 - 00:17:18.342, Speaker F: And there's like really important thing here is Nvidia is monopolizing the market. If you look at the Nvidia knows that there's RTX 30 90 and 1490, and obviously supply available from gamers, and they could grab up and aggregate, bring this supply, buy it from people. They know that of course, they're not dull, but actually, and this is real information, current providers of GPUs, they have high demand because they have AI startups and so on. And current providers GPUs want to scale up, they want to bring in more GPUs. Nvidia does not allow them to buy new the H 100 and a 100. If they don't sign that, they will stop selling the 30 90 and the 40 90. This isn't for everyone.
00:17:18.342 - 00:17:51.330, Speaker F: So everyone would try to bring in 30 data center and build a cloud on it. Then they still, they got demand. Nvidia said, look, you want to buy the H 100, stop selling the 30 90 and 40 90. So this makes the supply narrowed in a funnel that Nvidia could control, even though there is all this supply all around. But no, let's buy only the H 100, the A 100, and keep growing in that price. Nvidia could control this and push prices up due to the demand. Right? I don't know if you're going to delete this from a podcast, but this is the reality.
00:17:51.330 - 00:18:32.574, Speaker F: But when you build a decentralized network, you enroll these guys to come at it. You still have to upgrade the infrastructure to match what the AI is requirement, like all the requirements of AI apps. It's not like you're going to bring a gamer and suddenly AI computes and it works. No, it doesn't work. There's a lot of infrastructure that need to be enhanced and pushed up. Even crypto mining facilities that are 20,000 GPU, they can't meet AI demand because of the way they're set up. They need to change hard disk, increase storage, better RAM, better Internet connectivity and so on.
00:18:32.574 - 00:18:51.734, Speaker F: There's some few things that they need to configure, but it's simple things like if they configured it, then they have access to AI compute or the AI compute money. It's decentralized. They don't have to take permission from Nvidia or take permission from anyone. They own the GPS. They can do whatever they want. And they're not selling it, they are mining. Right.
00:18:51.734 - 00:18:58.794, Speaker F: So it's like a kind of sterile, not really clear area, which makes this structure arbitrage. We're doing.
00:18:58.832 - 00:20:17.186, Speaker B: Well, one of the maybe analogies I've come up with is if you're coming from the world of Defi, and, you know, the history of defi sort of disrupting parts of traditional finance, there is this opportunity where you sort of cut out the middlemen and you're pulling all of this liquidity in a decentralized manner. So it's like a coordination solution is ultimately what it is. You're allowing all these folks to be incentivized to work together. And so I'm kind of looking at that equivalent of the liquidity that was pooled through DeFi as like the compute in a decentralized manner that's pooled through IO net. And you've got this protocol that ultimately lives on and thrives due to the consensus that happens through Solana. And anyways, long story short, it's a coordination solution that we're talking about. There are some supply constraints, there's issues of centralization there in terms of who controls those GPUs, how they get sold, how they get distributed, and you're recognizing, like, an inefficiency in the market.
00:20:17.186 - 00:20:42.214, Speaker B: And so that's what I o net as a decentralized compute network does, is it makes the world a lot more efficient, brings all these resources together. And this is part of the reason, which has still been shocking to me, at how much cheaper of an offering you can provide than what the centralized services do. Anyways, correct me if I'm misfaming anything, that's actually right.
00:20:42.252 - 00:21:18.422, Speaker F: I mean, let me add two things. One thing about price. So how much cheaper? I was like, why it's cheaper? Why could you get it cheaper? The answer is why not? If I explain to you, then everyone understand it. So the RTX 3090, if you are lucky, you will find it for $0.70 an hour on the cheapest cloud provider on the planet. That's like the cheapest you could find, actually $0.79. So zero point 79 with 24, that's 18.96
00:21:18.422 - 00:21:51.082, Speaker F: a day. Normal prices could go to Genesis cloud, go to any provider, just see the price. Now take this card, go to a nice hash, look at the earnings or what to mine. There's no way the most profitable coin right now will make you one dollars a day. The AI compute is making 18.96 96 a day, and you are making one dollars, the best coin if you're lucky. And you're going to have to keep switching coins whenever there's a better coin.
00:21:51.082 - 00:22:26.106, Speaker F: Ethereum at the maximum. When Ethereum was at the all time high, and it was really hype and so on, because of the price of Ethereum, the maximum this card could ever make was something $7 a day. And this only lasted for two weeks, and then Ethereum dropped and so on. So let's say at the top hype of Ethereum, you'd only make $7 a day. Right now for us, we're selling this card based on my explorer. Correct me if I'm wrong related on, but I think it's around $0.30 an hour.
00:22:26.106 - 00:22:48.770, Speaker F: That's $7.2 a day. So currently we're just starting. If your GPU can meet the requirement of AI apps, you could make $7 a day. And we are trying to bring clients who book your GPU, not for a day or two of you. If booked for six months, three months. So you're talking about seven times what you could make right now.
00:22:48.770 - 00:22:57.350, Speaker F: Crypto. And for the engineer who is paying $18 a day now, he's paying seven and he's still getting the same quality.
00:22:57.500 - 00:23:27.694, Speaker C: I think that's huge, and I want to dive into that a little bit more later. Competing on price is massive. Obviously that's huge, but I'd like to kind of just walk through some of the other differentiators from, I guess, some of the traditional web, two cloud providers of Azure AWS. Where else in that flow, or Uiux, are you beating them, would you say? I mean, price is probably enough, but what else?
00:23:27.892 - 00:24:36.758, Speaker A: One thing about the price, we talk about price a lot, because there is, like I said, it's a heroin fire, price is a hero fire problem. But what we really offer, and this is like Ahmad, can get into a lot more detail, but we offer choice. If you want, you can completely recreate a data center that AWS would have perfectly, so you can have the same performance. And maybe the cost savings isn't quite as much, but you can match performance. And if you wanted to, theoretically, let's say you're running a hedge fund in Manhattan right now, and you're using AWS and their data centers in Texas, you could bring the data center closer to you, like have something in upstate New York and you could know even lower latency, which could be a huge competitive advantage in trade. So it's really know ultimately, I think at a high level, it's choice is what we offer. And so I want to get rid of this notion that we're competing on price.
00:24:36.844 - 00:25:55.070, Speaker F: And I think the UX, like anyone who ever tried to deploy something on AWS, they give you a certificate that took you three months to want to know how do you the platform? It's the front end really. I'm not undervaluing the services AWS has. It's basically powering everything we have on the planet. And I can say is we kind of found a niche that could give us an opportunity to make network, like to make an income that's consistent to the network, that could grow this network massively at the point where this network could really then later on be able to itself build crowdsource data centers, build more resources, but later on, on a later stage. So we kind of like on what is the most profitable thing that AWS is making money out of it, which is the AI can do. And then how could we exactly get into the AI compute in a way that would make consistent profit to the suppliers of the GPUs on the network area. And because that will bring more and more of these suppliers, the more we have, then the more power we have to basically bring in more and more clients out of AWS to us.
00:25:55.070 - 00:26:41.498, Speaker F: They don't have to move everything out of AWS. We could still keep database this data, they don't have to move everything. But once they look at our prices, and once they see the user experience, and once they see that it actually match the performance, literally our networking performance. Like if you test the speed of GP, we have gps that are faster than Lambda cloud. Lambda cloud have like 40,000 h, 180,000 a 100. It's huge. And startups, like the kind of startup we have, literally, they are going out from lambda cloud and using our network, because we have some GPUs that are so much faster than they have Internet, that's faster than lambda cloud.
00:26:41.498 - 00:27:10.470, Speaker F: And the reason why it's faster, not because lambda cloud can't make it has so many clients, it's huge, right? So they can't just give all the network to one person. But when you go to the other mining facility, he's a five core storage provider, he has ten gigabits of Internet connectivity. When you download something, it's like this so fast. When you download something, literally 10GB, you read it. I have never seen it anywhere. When you download the movie. That's 10GB to download.
00:27:10.470 - 00:27:34.078, Speaker F: We have another storage provider in Netherlands, 80GB of connectivity. Why he can have this because he's alone. It's just him and few other racks of servers. It's not 50,000 servers, so it's easier to provide such high speed. And that really gives the advantage of having such distance. Such small things really matter.
00:27:34.244 - 00:28:12.218, Speaker B: Before we talk more about the offering or the service that you provide, and I want to talk about how that works within the rules of the protocol. Maybe we should also highlight what are the trade offs here, because we've helped to highlight all of the advantages. I think like some of the selling points to why a client might end up leaving AWs in the future and moving over to IO net. So anyways, what do your naysayers say? What would a legacy competitor say about the trade offs of using IO net.
00:28:12.384 - 00:29:08.442, Speaker F: Teeter with the same experience? It's actually better. I don't see a trade off. But what I would say is multiple things like auto deployment, CRCD, like multiple features like defense on your API, like other small features that it took them years to add on the base compute, which we will move forward like we are already building such stuff and more features, but within of course the ML industry, ML Ops, ML training and inference and so on. So that's kind of, you could say in a way trade off that we still don't have all this wide range of extra features on top of the GPU cluster you have for sure. That's kind of, I would say a trade off. But again, when you come back to, yeah, I'm doing that trade off so I could figure it out myself. There are really engineers, but at least I'm saving 60% first.
00:29:08.442 - 00:29:29.690, Speaker F: At least 60%. And also they are passed. I have wide range of supply in 45 countries, 20,000 GPUs, no question asked. You just literally click deploy, 10 seconds, you have the cluster done. That's it. As simple as that. So with AWS, with core wave, you feel like as a client, like you're begging them as please give me GPUs.
00:29:29.690 - 00:29:57.050, Speaker F: And they literally send me your pitch deck and send me your LinkedIn profile. What do you want with me? I just want some GPUs. I wanted two GPUs, that's it. Why? And this is really annoying, so annoying kind of kyc thing here, and we don't want to do that. Just come and jump put your GPU or come in, jump rent any GPUs you want from anywhere. That's it. Removing that.
00:29:57.050 - 00:30:17.402, Speaker F: Because as a developer, it really hurted me. Why you asked me about my pitch deck and LinkedIn. I don't have a pitch deck and I don't have LinkedIn, so I don't want to send it. Kind of one of the things we're solving, we're bringing it back to the engineer. We're giving them more power. And the community too is really critical. You go to AWS, who can help you.
00:30:17.402 - 00:31:00.080, Speaker F: You go to Azure, this one person can help you. But here you go to our discord and just this, in the last four days, we closed like, what are the 50 tickets of support and your ticket coming in? We're helping them, our team is helping, other engineers are helping, that are deploying with us. Just like more engagement and better user experience overall. For the engineers that are kind of in our generation we're talking about, this generation has its way to do it. And definitely Azure and AWS and so on, they're not going to come with this mentality. So they will have their customers, they will have their own kind of market here. There's a market that's emerging like all the startups, like this startup we're serving the yesterday is $24 million a few days ago.
00:31:00.080 - 00:31:14.174, Speaker F: All the guys in this team is like less than 27. Who going to serve this generation that is building this new big thing? This is the generation. So you need to serve them with their mentality, with the way we are working, the way we think. I'm part of this generation.
00:31:14.302 - 00:31:29.906, Speaker A: One thing actually on the question of the trade offs, I think it goes back to what I was talking about, about us offering choice. And I remember I was on a call with the VC once and they said, you can't be better, faster, cheap.
00:31:29.938 - 00:31:31.238, Speaker F: You have to have trade offs.
00:31:31.334 - 00:32:08.306, Speaker A: And I said, no, I said, I disagree, because what we're doing is truly disruptive, right? By bringing supply on, we're changing the inherent dynamics of the market. And so yes, if you want to absolutely maximize for price, maybe there's a trade off on performance. But there are cases where you can get better, faster and cheaper than anything that's out there. And we've seen this time and time again, it's a market disruption to get really nerdy and academic. We're a disruptive innovation, not sustaining. And so we don't follow those rules.
00:32:08.498 - 00:32:35.886, Speaker B: So if I'm a customer who starts to use compute from I o net, how do I pay? Really simple question. How are payments settled? How do folks who provide compute get paid? Are we getting paid in Seoul or tokens or what can we do a demo that would be. Yeah, yeah. And by the way, for folks who listen to this in the future, just go to our YouTube and you'll find the video link there.
00:32:35.988 - 00:33:12.090, Speaker F: So right now I'm in the IO cloud. So the IO platform consists of Iocloud, I, Explorer and ioworker. Three different platforms that are serving two different types of people, or basically three. So the Iocloud is for the ML engineers, AI engineers. The Explorer is for token and all the network and what's happening over the network. So think of it like AWS, but all the data that's happening is public and verified and chained. The ioworker is the part where the suppliers of compute are monitoring the devices they have on the network.
00:33:12.090 - 00:33:54.646, Speaker F: And also I could come into this device that I have, I'm mining my own project. I look at here, I have this RDX a 6000. I can see like uptime information about the device services that my device is running, all the jobs that my device was hired off and how much I earned out of this job and for which cluster this job was. So this is like the part of the provider of compute. That's what they see in earnings and rewards. I can claim my rewards with Solape and USDC later on with IO and IOSD coins. And this I could see like all the jobs, all the amount of money I earned, all the amount of money I slashed because I went offline or something.
00:33:54.646 - 00:34:40.166, Speaker F: And there's like a huge list of all the compute jobs that I did, which is like clusters and so on. And then this is for the worker. I could connect a worker, it takes two minutes to connect it and then it will download a few packages and will be running out and you'd see it back here in the devices and then that's it. And here you could go to our discord and Twitter, we go to the cloud where engineers deploy clusters. So the really critical thing here is a lot of people claim that they are providing AI compute, but if you want to provide AI compute, like rent one instance and put a stable diffusion model on it, and that's it. But that's not it. That's not enough to bring the big money.
00:34:40.166 - 00:35:25.210, Speaker F: So how could we bring the big startups, the people that are paying a lot of money consistently and booking clusters for long term? The way to do that is you need to give them two things, either ray clusters or Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes clusters, the most unwidely used in industry. If you can provide Kubernetes clusters, basically any type of workload could run on this machine. If one of the minor machines can provide Kubernetes services, it can provide almost any service and any company on the planet, whatever the use case, they could use it. Now, whether it's ML, not ML, CPU, GPu, whatever. But here we're focused of course on GPU, but still it's open and soon we will allow CPU to access. The other thing is Ray.
00:35:25.210 - 00:36:18.530, Speaker F: Ray, I said the backbone of chat GBT. Have you ever thought how chat GBT is able to be so fast? How chat GPT, how they train chat GBt? The model is also big. If the GPU RAM is like only 8GB, 80GB, but the model is 1 TB, what are you going to do? How are you going to put the model in 80GB? You can't and you can't compress it. So what would you do is you will paralyze the model and then you will have multiple GPUs talk to each other. It's one of the most complex, it's actually considered the most complex things in computer science. So this thing to distribute workloads and parallelize the model and all this requires a cluster. The moment you have two different GPUs and you want them to talk to each other to coordinate work here you need ray.
00:36:18.530 - 00:37:14.838, Speaker F: But usually in the industry you never even hear about Ray. Before you have actually built a scalable ML project, before you have built extremely huge distributed inference and distributed training project. And once you reach to that point, at that point you need ray. And when you need that, you will find IO in front of you, because there's only two platforms on the planet that can give you a ray cluster, which is any scale, which is the company that built Ray and us. So when you go here and you click, and any scale, by the way, is used by OpenAI and Ulba and Instacart, and we're in discussion with any scale team to put Iocloud as an alternative provider there. So basically open AI team will have the button and they will see awareness, Azure, and then Ionet. And that's coming quarter one or end of quarter two.
00:37:14.838 - 00:37:59.750, Speaker F: Now when I deploy a cluster, I'm an engineer who want to deploy a cluster of GPUs, whether it's inference or training or so on, they're differently configured. I'm choosing here to supply, and then I could see the available type of GPUs that I could rent. Now this is live demo. We're really confident of our product. I can see there's 1240, then I could select locations, maybe not us, Canada, France, South Korea, together. Let's take the US two, Russia, and then I choose security. We have some SoC, two compliant GPUs which serves most high end enterprise clients.
00:37:59.750 - 00:38:46.120, Speaker F: I want the connectivity speed that's medium because low is really medium low speed and so on. They change the pricing. And then I chose why I want this cluster and I basically just deploy it. If you look in the top here, when you click deploy cluster, we have a lot of choices and we're going to keep building more like ray cluster, Kubernetes, Ludwig Gray Pytorch hugging face models, ionative SDK under engine five streaming, unity streaming a lot of things coming in really soon. Now I can see at the end that I only have five GPUs could rent within this configuration I chose. So I'm going to take all of these five GPUs and I will rank them for 1 hour, right? So right now I can see that the total cost is $2. Maybe let's take them for 7 hours.
00:38:46.120 - 00:39:25.562, Speaker F: I should give it a name, decide that that's right and I'll click deploy. Now if I don't have payment. Answering your question, I could pay either with credit card or with USDC. But at the end, even if you paid with credit card, and the reason why we have credit card is to remove friction from AI engineers who are not even in crypto. Why do they have to come into crypto? So we will take care of that harder from them. You pay in credit card with the system, automatically converts it to USDC, and then USDC is deposited into the wallet and then this wallet is held in escrow. Now I already have a cluster.
00:39:25.562 - 00:39:42.626, Speaker F: Show me in the whole world and any cloud provider that you could have a cluster that fast. Never nowhere I wish there's a cluster that fast. That's my cluster. That's my four workers running. And switch to another theme I can see. I paid $17. This is the connectivity speed.
00:39:42.626 - 00:40:04.510, Speaker F: I have GPUs literally from us, Russia, France and Canada. And I have visual studio code. Basically I can just jump in and start coding and I can see all the devices that are now part of my cluster. Let's look at this device. Whatever. Randomly, this device I can click on this device. I don't know who's the owner of this device, but I know that this device was running for 4 hours.
00:40:04.510 - 00:40:34.310, Speaker F: It's from France, it's from Id 40 90. This is the GPUs you have. And this is the jobs. If you look now at the jobs, you'll see our job that we just did. Maybe not yet. You'll see the job that he just started, and you'll see all the amount of money that he earned and all the amount of money that he was flashed because maybe he went offline during the job. So back to the cluster, but we don't know who is this.
00:40:34.310 - 00:41:10.338, Speaker F: And in the cluster areas, I can terminate and rename and so on. But if I go to cloud, let's take this cluster ID. This is because it's personal information, but if I go to the explorer where I can see all the 20,000 GPUs we have and all the supply, if I go to the clusters that I just. I want to search a cluster, I could put my cluster ID here, and I can see this cluster is already in the network, but it's private. No one knows who's the owner of this cluster, but we can know that it's multiple GPUs, and we can see all the GPUs in the cluster, and it's working, and big startups are already using it. Huge announcement coming in soon. Technology works.
00:41:10.338 - 00:41:36.026, Speaker F: It works at big scale, where it's really big scale. And what's really interesting is right now, we're building these mega clusters that all these GPUs, you see, the 17,000, the 1000, 1800 from Powercoin, all of them could be aggregated in a single mega cluster, and all of them could compute one job, if we want. That's the power of this ray clusters and the networking infrastructure we built just.
00:41:36.048 - 00:42:27.818, Speaker C: To add on to that. Ahmad. So, in looking at the space myself and kind of doing research as an investor on this decentralized compute space, a lot of the other, I guess you could call them, competitors in this space, are allowing a user to spin up what's called, like, an instance, or basically take command of one singular GPU? What you guys have been able to unlock is this clustering, which typically, from my understanding, needed to be done in a singular location, in a data center somewhere, with a very. Just in person, basically. So you're actually aggregating GPUs into a cluster that can talk together. And I hadn't seen this before until we started talking to you guys, but I just wanted people to kind of understand kind of the magnitude of your offering and the differentiated nature. Am I getting that right?
00:42:27.904 - 00:42:36.570, Speaker F: You're getting very right. I mean, the technology we have here, it can literally cluster 50 to 60,000 GPU in a single cluster.
00:42:36.730 - 00:42:50.706, Speaker C: I got a crazy question. So could somebody conceivably build their own LLM, like, large language model through I o net? If they had the resources and the funds, of course, but would that be possible?
00:42:50.888 - 00:43:38.930, Speaker F: The technology were built on top is the technology that is used by chat GBT to train chat GBT model and is currently everyday chat GBT to infrastructure. It's the same technology and upgraded with a lot of networking infrastructure. From the moment when we built the product. We didn't build the product to just come in and hype and go with the hype. We built the product to exactly serve anyone who's building on that same infrastructure. Because those guys who are building on this exact infrastructure are the guys who have the money and are the guys who are suffering from cost and those are the guys that want a lot of GPUs and they can't find. And then we suddenly jumped in with an infrastructure that can actually support.
00:43:38.930 - 00:44:13.286, Speaker F: You could check my YouTube channel, I have a video when I was demoing this product to OpenAI and Instacart and Google. We're really in this industry at the core. We just went to the exact right place where we should be offering the product to really blow up the network. And that's what we're doing, focused to specific clients, because we know these guys are huge. We just got in, just in the last two weeks, paid 89, sorry, 94 or $98,000. Compute just in two weeks. It's one client, one startup.
00:44:13.286 - 00:44:35.860, Speaker F: We're just playing with, literally playing. So imagine we have 56, 560 startup in the pipeline coming in. The sales team is in here. Imagine all this money flowing in. They don't even have to know it's crypto and they're paying with visa, ach. Normally it all comes in, flowing in later, flowing to the IO, coin burning, minting. It's a lot of really.
00:44:35.860 - 00:44:49.366, Speaker F: I'm sure we're going to witness a network that really, the money that's flowing on demand of the network is more than the emission of the token. And I haven't yet seen this, but I think this would be hopefully the one.
00:44:49.468 - 00:45:13.486, Speaker A: Yeah, and on top of that, as he was saying, because we're the only ones that can serve the enterprise AI customer. Most of this word competitor is very funny to us because most companies that people consider our competitors either are suppliers, are in talks to be suppliers, or want to be suppliers, simple as that. I mean, you can already see a couple of them and we can't mention the other ones right now.
00:45:13.588 - 00:45:27.874, Speaker B: Guys, one thing we might have not covered there is in that flow as a user, is there a fee that I o net is taking at some point, or do you envision I o net taking a fee in the future?
00:45:27.992 - 00:46:20.546, Speaker F: So of course there is a 5% to 10% fees. And this fees is not for us, it's a network fee, right? So what happens is, and it's on a cluster, so there's two fees. And before we talk about fees, let's talk about what is the flow of money that's coming in. So we have money coming in from booking clusters. Like what we showed you this money, we charge 5% on this, and then you have money coming in, or the network charge 5% and then money comes in for inference, each inference, as I showed you before, maybe for the recording on this BCA to TI, where each inference have proof of compute and you click in it, you see a network fee and you see all this small inference payment, like the microtransact. So all this money that's flowing into the network purely to the network, not paid to the workers or like the providers, this money is coming in directly to what we call I ventures. Go to our website, I o ventures.
00:46:20.546 - 00:46:58.498, Speaker F: You'll see we are the first VC that invest in startups only with AI compute. Like we don't give you money, we just give you access to GPUs. And all this money that's flowing in this 5% and 10%, we're basically taking this money and we're putting it in the vault for the IO ventures and then the startups coming in to use the network. We invest in the startup by buying with this IO coin, the compute that is in the IO network. So it's flowing back to the IO network, but at the same time it's not just flowing back, it's flowing back with another startup that started here and then could scale and use more of it.
00:46:58.584 - 00:47:28.442, Speaker B: Tori and Ahmad, this is probably a good place for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners they can learn more about IO net by going to IO net. They can also follow the official twitter handle for IO net. It is ionet, underscore official, but otherwise. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with us about all that you're building. Congrats on just the massive success you've had so early on, and we'd love to have you back in the future to talk more about IO net.
00:47:28.576 - 00:47:38.622, Speaker F: Yeah, thank you so much man, for having us. It was a great opportunity and I'm looking forward to see how Iocoin and Ionet venture into this world.
00:47:38.756 - 00:47:51.790, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital and for future episodes of the Edge podcast. Please check out our link tree at Edge Pod.
