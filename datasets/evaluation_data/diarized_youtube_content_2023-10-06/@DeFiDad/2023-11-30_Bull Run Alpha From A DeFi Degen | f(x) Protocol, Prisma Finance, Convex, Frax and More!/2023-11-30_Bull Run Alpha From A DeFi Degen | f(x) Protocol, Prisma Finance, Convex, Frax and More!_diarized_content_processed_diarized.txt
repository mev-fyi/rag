00:00:00.330 - 00:00:41.290, Speaker A: They all have a strong sense of revenue generation. They all kind of use gauge weight and voting. You know, bribing is a strategy in the curve ecosystem. So, you know, you see FX doing it, bribing their pools. Ve tokenomics seems to be a common thread too. I mean, I really do believe that VE is one of those tokenomic models that I think is capturing a lot of attention because locking up tokens really is a good way to preserve value and also show long term alignment with token investors.
00:00:43.790 - 00:01:34.154, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's show features an anonymous DeFi investor and contributor with new insights for the ever expanding universe of V tokenomics protocols, including convex favex protocol and Prisma Finance. One of our goals on the Edge podcast is to uncover the next generation of DeFi giants, as well as the ideas and strategies being deployed by the most advanced builders and users in the space. If you watch the Edge podcast regularly, you may have noticed this as we covered the launches of up and coming protocols like Favex and Prisma in this episode. Crypto Vestor takes us one step beyond to reveal the latest alpha even we weren't aware of as it relates to curve convex fracs F of X and Prisma. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.
00:01:34.154 - 00:02:12.850, Speaker B: For most of us, our crypto journey started with Metamask, and now with Metamask portfolio, we can do so much more. Metamask portfolio puts you in control.

00:02:59.410 - 00:03:42.478, Speaker C: Everybody at this point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your staked ETH mint, a liquid staking token and then use that token in defi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, oracle networks, other blockchains and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH.
00:03:42.478 - 00:04:08.566, Speaker C: In Defi. We are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with liquid restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:04:08.678 - 00:04:14.400, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:04:16.450 - 00:04:58.010, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain ux. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas. One gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to Instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:58.670 - 00:05:25.314, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce crypto Vester. He was a bitcoin maxi in 2014 who turned into an ETH head in 2020 and found his way to convex and fracs. His background is in Tradfi, where he worked at a hedge fund. He's been a self appointed longtime lurker, quote unquote, but decided to start tweeting and writing about what he saw in Defi to bring awareness to the Kurg ecosystem. Crypto Vester, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:05:25.432 - 00:05:28.738, Speaker A: Thank you so much, guys. Really appreciate you guys having me on the podcast.
00:05:28.834 - 00:06:24.482, Speaker B: It's really nice to finally connect. We've talked a lot in Telegram, nomadic, and I have both followed you on Twitter and really enjoyed the insights that you share. Like you are someone who lives across multiple projects that are very aligned curve, convex, Frax, Prisma and F of X. And so we're going to talk today about why these projects work so well together and have composability that tends to benefit one another and what are the sort of key takeaways that we should consider as DFI investors and users in 2023? So why don't we start with a little bit more about that background I referred to earlier that you had this epiphany in 2020 about DFI. Can you share a bit more about what was the light bulb moment for you with DFI?
00:06:24.626 - 00:07:08.666, Speaker A: Okay, well, yeah, like you said, I started with bitcoin, bitcoin Maxi for many years and I was always put off by all coins, just no ETH, no east, don't do that. But I remember talking to a friend of mine and he said, oh, I got some crypto and I'm earning some yield. And it was like early 2020. Yeah, it was like a little bit after the DFI summer, I would say. It was probably like September around there. And he's like, I'm earning some yield on Ethereum and I'm like, yield? Like what? Because I'm just sitting on bitcoin and it's not doing anything. So he got on a Zoom call with me and played around, help me install metamask.
00:07:08.666 - 00:07:45.374, Speaker A: And I'm like, what? I mean, I understood Ethereum. I knew you could have Ethereum and I knew you could have it a lot. But I didn't understand the concept of metamask and using it integrated with a browser and integrating with dapps and that kind of thing. So he kind of introduced me into that. And once I saw, I think back then it was like compound strategy or it was something like that where I started and I earned interest on your USDC. And then when he introduced me to uniswap where I could just swap tokens permissionlessly, that was like an aha moment. And I'm like, oh boy.
00:07:45.374 - 00:08:47.906, Speaker A: And so I swapped a lot of my bitcoin into Ethereum at that point and then rode the wave up in the bull run and right back down to where we are right now. So that's how I got started, that's how I got introduced to DFI and obviously played around with a couple of protocols since then. Obviously you guys remember in late 2021, the Olympus days, and I got sucked into that. I burned my fingers with it, obviously, a little bit. But I learned it had the concept of a black hole for crypto or where crypto was getting bonded into it. And that intrigued me and that got my brain going as far as, what is this? Why is this thing sucking in all of these assets? And this is how I got introduced to convex. It was Zeus on a community call talking about acquiring convex and putting that up for vote to be able to be one of the next assets that it would be bonded into Olympus.
00:08:47.906 - 00:08:53.734, Speaker A: And I'm like, what the hell is convex? And I'm like, then that's what got it all.
00:08:53.932 - 00:09:54.570, Speaker B: It's crazy to think back about some of those introductions to defi concepts or concepts that were from tradfi that got translated on chain with protocols. Because a lot of what you just referenced is fairly normal for us as like curve convex Prisma, f of X fracs users. But yeah, I remember urine launching in summer 2020 and I remember staking the LP and I had done this with synthetics, so I was somewhat familiar already. But then there was the pool two, which had, I think, like a 90 ten balancer set up. So it was much more heavily weighted to one token. And all these things just were really actually new ideas in Defi, totally foreign. I was trying it in real time and then trying to translate what I was finding, putting it on Twitter and making videos about that.
00:09:54.570 - 00:10:10.906, Speaker B: At the same time, there's been a refinement of these different protocols, which is more, again, of what we're going to talk about today. Like, what are those best practices or best design choices among those protocols?
00:10:11.098 - 00:10:44.902, Speaker A: Yeah, we've seen a lot of change in just the last 18 months. The builders in the bear market have really. There's some amazing things that have come out of. I can definitely point to protocol effects. I could point to fracs, prisma. I mean, they've all done amazing things, even the curve ecosystem in general. So yeah, I think that we've grown from those days, those 8000 apr days in Olympus, to something where I think we're maturing to more what real yield.
00:10:44.902 - 00:11:00.442, Speaker A: And one of the reasons why I was attracted to convex was because of the bribes and trying to learn about how to earn real yield instead of just token emissions. And that's what got me kind of into that area and what got me into the curve ecosystem.
00:11:00.506 - 00:11:15.130, Speaker E: Crypto vester. I want to talk about convex fracs, curve prisma and F of x and kind of like what the common thread is between those protocols and just kind of what do they have in common, how are they connected?
00:11:15.230 - 00:12:08.310, Speaker A: Well, they all have a strong sense of revenue generation. So in Frax's world, obviously Frax ETH and what they're doing with their staked fracs, it's all based on generating yield. In Frax's case, with real world assets, Frax ETH, obviously the underlying staked ETH fees, and also even with some protocol effects, you're basically minting fees to generate to mint those stable coins. So I think in general, they all have that common thread. They all kind of use gauge weight and voting. Bribing is a strategy in the curve ecosystem. So you see FX doing it, bribing their pools.
00:12:08.310 - 00:12:45.214, Speaker A: So there's that element, I think, that I don't think exists outside of the curve ecosystem. Ve tokenomics seems to be a common thread too. I really do believe that ve is one of those models, token emission models, tokenomic models, that I think is capturing a lot of attention because locking up tokens really is a good way to preserve value and also show long term alignment with investors. With token investors, yeah, I totally agree.
00:12:45.332 - 00:13:06.114, Speaker E: I know the ve tokenomics were kind of like, there was a lot of people on either side of the fence for a while, but I think the fact that we've seen them now exist through a cycle of up, down, and we're going back up, it's almost like giving some lindiness to the ve tokenomics in some respect.
00:13:06.162 - 00:13:08.614, Speaker A: I think I heard you mention the.
00:13:08.652 - 00:13:20.166, Speaker E: Term bribe, and I've often wondered if we as an industry will come up with a better term, if there's anything better suited, or if that is it, if that is the term.
00:13:20.278 - 00:13:59.770, Speaker A: I think the adult term is probably incentivized. I say it because I guess it's part of the culture. But yeah, I mean, you're incentivizing pools is what you're doing. Bribing is a dgen term, right. But yeah, I think that in general, the concept of bribing a pool or incentivizing a pool is something that kind of born out of curves. And I think it's one of those things that really only works with curve. And everybody thinks of curve as kind of a Dex and they don't really go beyond that.
00:13:59.770 - 00:14:51.546, Speaker A: And it's really much more than a Dex. I mean, it's a place where liquidity is born, right. And because you have token incentives and because you have voting and you have the ve tokenomics and you have bribing, incentivizing. What I call curve is, I call it like the incentivizer because you can incentivize actions with curve that you cannot incentivize in other protocols, for example. And this is not a knock on Dai or maker, because I respect what they're doing, and I think that they're very impressive with what rune is doing. But to give you an example, let's say you have SDI and SDI is producing. We'll just say it's 5%.
00:14:51.546 - 00:15:40.582, Speaker A: I think it's less now. I think it might be three or four, but whatever, it's 5%, just call it 5%. There's no way to really incentivize people depositing into die other than you just basically knowing that you're going to earn 5%. But if I take $50,000 and I deposit it into an SDI curve USD pool, right, the APYs go to like 500,000%. Or let's just say for realistic, just 5000%. Because that bribe was deposited, you've basically incentivized people to go and seek out curve USD and seek out stake die to deposit into that curve pool. And it attracts liquidity like a magnet into curve.
00:15:40.582 - 00:16:01.358, Speaker A: So no other protocol. Well, maybe Prisma might be one. Now that just kind of is doing something similar, really is using emissions that way in a very big scale. Right. Like, curve is kind of like the centerpiece for defi. So that's kind of how I visualize things, if that makes sense.
00:16:01.444 - 00:17:41.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what you're describing is that whether your protocol is newer or older, when you build with this V tokenomics model, the protocols that I think are able to use that to their advantage and thrive are actually using the V tokenomics to basically bootstrap the curve and let's say convex holders on board with that new protocol. I think what happened with curve being the first V tokenomics model, I think that that was some sort of crypto immaculate conception. It's like one of those things you look back on and you're like, there will never be another time in history to replicate what Ethereum was able to do at that point. Like just being the first true smart contract platform, what bitcoin did maker was a very special sort of thing. I think that curve itself, Curve addressed such a dire need for all of us with pools that were ideal for trading stable coins or more correlated assets. And so now it's 2023, we're seeing a lot of protocols use V tokenomics. I don't think that V tokenomics guarantees any success for a protocol, but I do think it's a mix of an incentivization plus like a marketing decision all rolled up into one.
00:17:41.406 - 00:17:52.046, Speaker B: And this is kind of leading into why we're so interested in the likes of Prisma and afavax being these newer protocols using v tokenomics.
00:17:52.158 - 00:18:27.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think you used a good term there. There was that immaculate conception moment, that sort of moment where things kind of exploded, and I don't think it would happen again. I think curve and convex kind of came out at the right time. It was a timing thing and it was an idea, a concept that I've seen others try to replicate, but it just doesn't gain traction. And I do believe that there was that moment, and I think that those kinds of things don't happen very often. You're right.
00:18:27.934 - 00:19:37.110, Speaker A: Like bitcoin was one, Ethereum was another, and I think what Herb and convex did was probably the third. There are other protocols, like, for example, prisma, that I think embraced the ve tokenomics and kind of added to it. They went even a step further with it, and I think they worked very closely with convex when they launched, so that the way the tokenomics were aligned, it really incentivized locking of Prisma. And that obviously didn't happen initially with curve because that was a bootstrap moment that convex did when they did what they did. But if you look back, and I think I coined the term drop lock and I kept repeating it over and over and over on Twitter because I was trying to get people to understand what was about to happen. And nobody really, I think people are starting to see it, know, basically the design elements, the way Prisma was designed. With the ve tokenomics, they basically gave or incentivized everybody with this airdrop who voted for their whitelist, with the curve whitelist.
00:19:37.110 - 00:20:40.146, Speaker A: But the airdrop would essentially be locked as ve Prisma. Right. And so that's the first time that's ever really happened that know Convex was very creative in allowing the capture of that value. So you could basically claim that airdrop in a liquid position, full 100% value, or you could let it get locked and you'd have to wait 52 weeks to get your vested position as prisma. So they use a little bit of psychology and a little bit of bear market ptsd to kind of force incentivize people into one sort of reaction, which is to lop a CVX Prisma and swallow the whole protocol in one shot without really spending a lot of emissions. I mean, they have to spend some, but it's not nearly what they spent on the curve side of things. To gain curve traction.
00:20:40.146 - 00:20:40.678, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:40.764 - 00:20:53.614, Speaker E: It's something that can really only happen again in a moment, in time, pre planned and for a new token launch. So there was a lot of factors there that had to go right for that relationship to work out the way it did.
00:20:53.732 - 00:20:54.094, Speaker A: I think.
00:20:54.132 - 00:21:14.466, Speaker E: On that note, I want to talk through kind of all of these protocols a little bit individually, but why don't we start with convex? Maybe remind people or give your elevator pitch on kind of what convex is, why people should pay attention to it, kind of what they're doing or what their mission is.
00:21:14.568 - 00:22:19.398, Speaker A: The way I see convex is, and maybe it's because of my early days with Olympus. It's sort of like the black hole of crypto world, right? I mean, they basically can acquire a protocol, the voting rights of a protocol, provide liquid versions of the lockers so that people have the ability to stake, earn the fees, and gain this voting power. And the whole point of convex is to gain as much voting power as possible to have influence over the DFI ecosystem. And obviously they've done that with curve. I mean, they're at, I think, 300 and something, 315 or 316,000,000 curve locked in convex Prisma as we speak. They're at like 3 million prisma tokens already. When people ask me why Convex, I tell them it gives me a portfolio exposure with one token of every narrative in crypto.
00:22:19.398 - 00:23:09.986, Speaker A: I mean, it gives me exposure to stablecoin wars, to the curve wars, to curve USD, to fracs, to Prisma, to the locked actual assets in convex like curves itself. Like as war gets locked in, the actual intrinsic value of convex goes up. Now with protocol, FX, Fe and X ETH, the minting fees, LSD wars. So like the LSD Phi element, with Prisma, you're exposed to that narrative as well. With FrAcs, you're exposed to real world assets. Frax bonds staked, fracs treasury bills. You still have exposure to any potential deals with Paxos and PayPal.
00:23:09.986 - 00:23:38.914, Speaker A: If anything were to ever happen with that. With frAcs, you're exposed to fracs chain, which is an L two that they're going to be building. So if fracs chain becomes something huge, which I think eventually will propel fracs, then convex, you're exposed to that element as well. And then on top of that, you got bribes. So you've got the whole gamut in one token. And that's not even talking about all of its tokenomics, right?
00:23:39.032 - 00:24:45.682, Speaker B: A part of the product market fit behind Convex has been due to the capture of these governance, voting rights in curve. And then beyond that, I think the next ecosystem that convex was able to swallow up a large amount of the token supply would be fracs with FXS. And then I'm wondering, what do you see as the next step here? We're starting to see convex swallow up the Prisma token. I think it's like, actually it's not starting. I think it's like 60 65% of the token supply. And then there's FXn, which is f of X protocol. So is this the future? Just continue to swallow up these promising V token models that are going to provide products that benefit curve and convex? Anyways, any thoughts on what's next for convex?
00:24:45.826 - 00:25:13.002, Speaker A: I definitely think that there's other. I've been lurking in that forum or that discord for a long time. And there's definitely, I think, tops of other protocols being added in. I think that is the strategy. It is primarily focusing on ve tokenomic. I think that there are two. What was one that I was reading about? I think silo might be one that they're just now becoming.
00:25:13.002 - 00:25:49.494, Speaker A: And that would be the first lending protocol for convex. And I know, know Michael from curve has a big position now in the silo. So it's sort of become very curve aligned. So I can see something like. It would be like a competitor to aave right in the convex ecosystem. I think. I was reading a few days ago about Napier finance and what they're doing with their interest, their yield token protocol.
00:25:49.494 - 00:26:16.606, Speaker A: I forgot exactly what it was that they do, but so many things. But I think they're doing a ve tokenomic model as well. And I think they're closely aligned. I looked at their page and some of their main backers were curve C, two from Convex. And so once you start seeing that convex and curve founders are invested seed investors, I think that they are probably likely candidates for some kind of takeover.
00:26:16.718 - 00:26:55.140, Speaker E: Hey, quick question just about, I guess convex and teams that have tried to fork it or duplicate it, I guess. Why has convex emerged and had the staying power that it's had at this point? I guess it's kind of obvious they were there at that immaculate Conception moment, that right point in time. But do you see anybody able to come on the scene now and accrue or accumulate any of these tokens? I guess that would just lead to massive price increases at this point if they ever tried to do something like that.
00:26:56.070 - 00:27:37.050, Speaker A: My gut reaction is no, I don't. I really don't see it. Could there be innovations and obviously other protocols come out? Yes, of course. And I mean, balancer is an example, right? We have de locked balancer, we have aura, right? And they've been able to do something there. And I'm not saying it won't be, I don't think this is just one player, and that's it. There will be others. But I think when you're talking about the actual king of assets, I really don't think you're going to be able to overcome surmount what convex has been able to do with the curve ecosystem.
00:27:37.050 - 00:28:16.218, Speaker A: And because curve is a moat of liquidity, I don't think you're going to be able to get curved type of liquidity in other areas, in other chains easily. And keep in mind, part of this isn't because I'm like, oh, I'm a curve maxi, so I must love curve. It's very hard to get this kind of liquidity. Billions and billions of dollars in any chain, in any protocol. And the fact is, the reason why it's been so difficult to fork curve is because nobody understands curve. So the only people who can run curve is a curve team. I mean, it's very difficult.
00:28:16.218 - 00:28:51.986, Speaker A: It's super complex. The math behind the pools and the formulas, it's not something that anybody can just take and be like, oh, I'm going to make a fork. And it doesn't work that way. So they've kind of gotten themselves in a situation where if you want curve to work, it's going to be Michael working on it, and it's going to be the team behind him. And because convex has taken that early know, and I do think that staked out, another example, like staked out is going to probably do very well, too, because they're locking up a lot of curve. And I'm okay. I love people who lock up curve.
00:28:51.986 - 00:29:31.298, Speaker A: I love all protocols that lock up curve. I am a convex maxi, but in the sense that curve getting locked up is good for everybody, so I don't have a problem with it. And I think the fact that staked Dow is very integrated with protocol, right. I think that you're going to see good integrations between those two, and that's going to also incentivize a lot of curve locking as well. So it's very synergistic, there's competitive elements, but I think that the whole ecosystem is evolving into something that's much more synergistic and much more cooperative versus antagonistic, if that makes sense.
00:29:31.464 - 00:30:08.314, Speaker B: Crypto vester, why not the Baal token balancers token? And this just popped into my head as we were talking about the different tokens that are being swallowed up by convex. Do you think there's ever a future here where convex goes after the bal token in terms of capturing a lot of the supply? Or is it just because of the distinction that now exists between aura and convex, aura being much smaller and again, kind of being like the convex of balancer.
00:30:08.442 - 00:30:54.558, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that they've probably made, and I can't speak for C two. He's a pretty quiet guy. I've chatted with him a little bit on telegram, but he's pretty reserved. So I would say I can't speak for the protocol by itself. But I would say that they've probably made some type of internal decision that they're going to keep fortifying their position with curve, and they're probably going to focus their emissions, because you got to remember, they've got emissions, they've got their token that they've got to spend to acquire other assets. Right? They're probably going to spend that on other avenues, other protocols. Interesting protocols like protocol, FX and Prisma, to diversify their portfolio a little bit better.
00:30:54.558 - 00:31:36.906, Speaker A: So that's how I see convex as kind of a portfolio of governance tokens with real actionable sort of tangible voting power. Like you literally use convex. They use that voting power, you earn bribes. You can really have a big say on what pools get emissions, what pools get gauges. So it's much bigger than not to put balancer down. But when you have a stable coin that's being launched, nobody comes on and says, hey, let's spin up a balancer pool. I mean, they're looking for the deepest liquidity always.
00:31:36.906 - 00:31:43.570, Speaker A: And that's what a stablecoin needs to survive. So they're always going to gravitate towards curvy.
00:31:43.670 - 00:32:40.974, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's interesting to see us survive another bear market and see users and liquidity consolidate to protocols like curve. I feel like curve was so dominant at the end of the last bull run, but it's even more dominant now in terms of the value that it provides. I am really interested to kind of watch uniswap and curve compete. It felt like uniswap came for curve's lunch, and it looked for a moment like you could start to see some stablecoin liquidity and other correlated asset pools move there, but not anymore. I think curve has really cemented its position as this multi chain amm that is there to serve the deepest liquidity for, again, correlated assets or stable assets, even though now we do have volatile pools as well.
00:32:41.012 - 00:33:18.886, Speaker A: On curve. And that's the thing. You have to think a little bit further. And why is curve so important to the ecosystem? And so you said stable assets and correlated assets like state ETH and all of the LSDs have a requirement for curve because if they have curve pools, they need to be able to swap assets, like, for like, right. One for one, as closely as possible. Well, if we're going to go into an Ethereum bull market and we expect staking to go through the roof, right. Then curve is like an essential tool for the miners.
00:33:18.886 - 00:33:47.346, Speaker A: I consider the LSDs of ethereum. They're the future miners of Ethereum, right? I mean, before they were miners that were running hardware machines. Now they're just on chain. And curve is an important piece of infrastructure for that mining operation to live. And so when you deal with correlated assets, you're really talking about the staked Ethereum. You're talking about all these different stablecoins. It's huge.
00:33:47.346 - 00:33:56.882, Speaker A: So that's why I say it's much more than just a depth, and it's much more a piece of very important infrastructure for all of Defi.
00:33:56.946 - 00:34:35.666, Speaker B: I want to go right into f of X. I was planning originally to kind of talk through methodically more about fracs and then touch upon the work that Prisma is doing, but we'll cover more of that in a bit. I just know that F of X is very near and dear to you, and so I'll just hand it over to you. Do you want to give the elevator pitch on F of X protocol? We recently covered it on a podcast just a few months ago. It is one of our favorite protocols that we discovered during the bear market. So, yeah. Catch everyone up on this crypto vester.
00:34:35.666 - 00:34:39.138, Speaker B: What is interesting about F of X protocol?
00:34:39.234 - 00:35:26.760, Speaker A: Okay, well, wow. FX is just really intriguing to me. I've always followed the Aladdin team, and I thought concentrator was an amazing product, but what they're doing now with F of X is just mind blowing. So obviously their flagship product is their FET X ETH, which is. I know it's hard for people to understand it. It's a hard concept to grasp, but it's got such a simple framework that it's elegant in the way that it was designed. And so what I love about it is you take base ETH and you stake it.
00:35:26.760 - 00:35:56.618, Speaker A: In this case, it's staked ETH. Right now, it's Lido staked ETH. But I think they're going to add other LSDs in the future to diversify. But just for purposes of the example, you have the staked ETH. And let's say for purposes right now, the Ethereum is $2,000. Just so a round number. You have two buckets, and you have the bucket with 10% volatility, and you have a bucket with 90% volatility.
00:35:56.618 - 00:36:42.380, Speaker A: And so it mathematically creates this balance. So as Ethereum goes up 10%, right, so let's say Ethereum goes up 10%. So now you have $200 of value that has accrued to this $2,000 ethereum, right? So you have this $200. Now picture the $200 like as if it was separate $200 worth of ethereum. If someone were to come and redeem the X ETH or the f ETH, they would get 10% or $20 of those $200. And so they would get their original $2,000 plus $20, right. And then the other part of the pool that's remaining, the $180.
00:36:42.380 - 00:37:31.962, Speaker A: If I go and I redeem XD, I'm basically got a claim to the $180 plus the original Ethereum. So now I'm getting 180, plus I'm getting $2,180. So I basically, in essence, have a leveraged position on E without actually taking any borrows out, without actually any fees. And it's based on just the underlying value of the Ethereum token. So it doesn't require any fancy gimmicks to get that to work. So I feel comfortable enough to mint x ETH because I know it's basically just a little bit more Ethereum from the other guys that the other guy deposited into mint fe. There are things that can go wrong.
00:37:31.962 - 00:38:14.234, Speaker A: And obviously every model has. If there were to be a very huge drop in Ethereum price overnight, then over 50% or something really extreme, I think they did some pretty sophisticated modeling to make sure that nothing like that has ever happened in Ethereum's history. I think there's like a 0.1 chance, percent chance of something like that happening, but it could happen. But the point is you basically have a token that in essence, it doesn't go beyond the bounds of one ethereum, $2,000. It's only expected on the growth and reduction of the value of Ethereum. And that's it.
00:38:14.234 - 00:38:53.634, Speaker A: To be able to issue a claim on leverage Ethereum. So you have two tokens, you have the FE token, which is 10% of the value of Ethereum's price rise or drop. So if Ethereum goes up 20%, then FE goes up 2%. If X ETH goes up 50%, then X ETH could go up. It's variable because depending on how much, anywhere between 1.5 to four x. So it could be 50% rise can be a 200% increase in XE.
00:38:53.634 - 00:39:28.894, Speaker A: But that's probably not realistic. It's probably more like 100 or 120%. But it is variable based on the amount that's being minted, if that makes sense. And so the reason why that's really interesting or the intriguing part, yes, they're using ETH and that's their flagship product. But I think what's happening now is that they're going to start coming out with other tokens primarily. I know they're talking about bitcoin, so they're going to do like an FBTC XBTC. I've brought up things in the discord about a short token.
00:39:28.894 - 00:40:20.610, Speaker A: So imagine being able to hold a token, and as Ethereum drops in value, your token actually goes up in value. And I asked Charlie about it and she said yes, it's totally possible with the invariate formula to be able to do so, again, very, very composable products. And then the newest thing, which is a little bit of they. They are talking, and you can go into their discord and there's some videos on it. They're talking about creating tokens, f tokens that are based on yield bearing tokens. And so imagine a world where you can have stable lish assets that earn a 1520, 30% APY. So I think that they've really unlocked a lot of potential.
00:40:20.610 - 00:41:07.154, Speaker A: They've kind of cracked the code, so to speak, from my point of view, because if I can hold a stable version of an asset and earn a high, high yield, then I think they've done something special. So that's why I really think that what protocol FX has done is really impressive. And again, it's part of the convex family of products, right? So 75% of the mint and redeem fees go to CVX FXN stakers. And part of it also goes, there's a percentage. I'm not exactly sure how much goes to the convex treasury as well. So again, this is how convex plays in this ecosystem as well, and just.
00:41:07.192 - 00:41:23.382, Speaker E: Kind of to drive home that link. So FXN is a token that convex is acquiring in large amounts. Do you kind of know the rough percentage that convex has essentially swallowed up?
00:41:23.516 - 00:42:02.158, Speaker A: Yeah, it's about 60%. Wow. And there's a very small amount of tokens available. It's only 60,000 tokens, I believe, or 40,000 I'm not in front of the site right now, but it's a very small number of tokens, but it represents 60% of the circulating supply. So a large portion of those fees are going to go to the CDX FXN stakers and to the CDX treasury. And so as they add new products, FBTC deal bearing products, those fees are going to go to FXN lockers. And that's very impressive.
00:42:02.158 - 00:43:26.058, Speaker A: Another thing that people don't realize, they may not realize about protocol FX, is that because they are inherently using ethereum, right, the underlying asset being staked ETH, they don't need to worry about deep liquidity pools of their token. I mean they need to worry about their FxN token and about pools for that token, but they don't necessarily need to worry about where is all this minting going to come from because there's already very deep liquidity for Ethereum pairs, Ethereum, USDC, Ethereum state lido. So those pools already exist. So the deep liquidity is already inherent in the curve ecosystem and allows all protocol Fx has to do is, and I make it sound like it's easy, but they're working with their code to be able to mint the actual Ethereum, the FE and the X ETH with their DAP using the existing liquidity that's already in the curve pools. And one example is that just this morning they integrated with cowswap. Okay, you're like, okay, well, what's the big deal? Well, the big deal is that cowswap is not just trading between pools. They're actually able to call the protocol and mint the FE right out of protocol Fx.
00:43:26.058 - 00:44:15.146, Speaker A: So cowswap now becomes like a new front end for protocol Fx. You don't need to go to the front end anymore, you just go to cowswap and you put in how many USDC or Ethereum you want to put in and you're automatically minting right out of the protocol. So that's really impressive because now that they're in the aggregator game, they're now in two or three major aggregators. They don't really need to worry about like, well, we need to advertise to get, they need to get the concept out because that's obviously important. It is a complex concept, but they don't need to worry about come to protocol FX, mint, they've got it. It's right there on every single aggregator and it always chooses the best route for the best available pricing.
00:44:15.258 - 00:44:42.546, Speaker B: So what you're saying then is in other protocols it would be more common that we'd have to set up liquidity pools. But here, because we're actually minting, we're creating the F of ETH, the more stable version, or the X E, the non liquidatable leveraged version. They've cleverly integrated it with what is cowswap? And isn't it also one inch cowswap.
00:44:42.578 - 00:44:44.514, Speaker A: One inch and DeFi llama.
00:44:44.642 - 00:44:56.934, Speaker B: So when we go there, if I were to put like I want to swap ETH for f ETH, what I'm actually doing is I'm minting it, but I'm just minting it through one of these dex aggregators.
00:44:56.982 - 00:45:29.800, Speaker A: Right, exactly. Another thing is to keep that thought going, they don't have to pay for liquidity. They don't have to bribe for their pools to keep their pools deep. They have deep pools already, which is just the ethereum pairs, if that makes sense. So they don't really have that liquidity cost to the protocol. They just have to worry about having good code that does the math correctly. And like I shared with you, the $20 going to the f each side and the $180 going to the.
00:45:29.800 - 00:45:44.086, Speaker A: It's a formula. It's a minting and redeeming formula. So that token is really just a claim on a certain amount of ethereum. And depending on which token you pick is, depending on how much of that you get, how much that volatility.
00:45:44.198 - 00:45:56.894, Speaker B: Can you remind us the fees involved? I think you mentioned there's a 1% minting fee. And then what about on the redemption side and any other fees to consider?
00:45:57.012 - 00:46:30.114, Speaker A: It's 1% for the x ETH mint and redeem. So it's a little more expensive to pay for the volatility. Right. But you get the leveraged ETH and it's zero point 25% for FE, so it's a lot smaller. On a more conservative side, if you want to just hold FE, you could hold that through the bear market. And if Ethereum goes down 90%, then FE is only going to go down 9%. I was talking to kmats about it and it came out of the whole concept.
00:46:30.114 - 00:46:51.754, Speaker A: The whole concept of FX came out of the USDC DPAc. Right? So they wanted something that was purely based. So it's so awesome because it's based purely on Ethereum. It's literally ethereum in the rebalance pool. Right. And so that's the reserve asset. That's what makes it so intrinsically valuable.
00:46:51.754 - 00:47:31.742, Speaker A: It's like you're just holding a token to a claim to stake ETH in a pool. And I think that if that model is applied across the board to other tokens and other tokens can be used, it's not limited to just Ethereum, any ERC 20 can do it. Yield bearing assets probably next. So that's going to be really interesting to see on the horizon. And all these minting fees and redeem fees are going to be going to ve FxN lockers and CVX FXN stakers. I was going to say, I kind of think of f, of X as the blackrock of crypto because they are.
00:47:31.796 - 00:47:33.470, Speaker B: Creating, I love that.
00:47:33.540 - 00:48:03.186, Speaker A: Yeah, they are creating like ETFs. They even said that they could create baskets of tokens that might be in the works too. So you can imagine buying one token and then having a basket of say ten. And remember, they're earning fees. So every time these things are minted, they're just collecting fees. Just like Blackrock would collect fees on an ETF. And what are they doing? They're just buying bitcoin and putting it into their ETF and charging a fee to all the tradfi.
00:48:03.186 - 00:48:11.866, Speaker A: So I kind of think of it like that, but a much more cheaper on chain version of a blackrock, if that makes sense.
00:48:11.968 - 00:48:59.846, Speaker B: So let's say in the future, if I were holding a yield bearing asset, something like, let's say a curve, if I'm holding that, and there were an F token of that, of the a curve, so normally I'd be holding this staked version of curve, I'm exposed to the volatility of the curve token. So token goes up a lot. Great, goes down. That sucks. But I'm earning that staking yield with curve. Now if we think about introducing this f token, I'm eliminating the volatility of that, but I'm still earning the yield, right? The fee on it.
00:48:59.948 - 00:49:45.670, Speaker A: So what way that works is, and absolutely, and I think that that's probably what's coming is something like that. So you can imagine like let's look at the fe version right now. So you take the fe, you make the fe, if you deposit it into the rebalance pool, the rebalance pool earns the underlying staked Ethereum. So remember we talked about the $2,000 of Ethereum, right? That's the value of one ethereum, but it's still earning fees, right? Because it's staked. So that staked asset portion, that 5%, is going to the rebalance pool. So you as an ETH holder can deposit into the rebalance pool and earn that 5%. Now it's actually 10% because they added incentives as well.
00:49:45.670 - 00:50:18.302, Speaker A: So in your example, if ACRV were to be, and I'm praying, I think that's coming, if ACRV were to be used and an F token were to be created, you'd have FACRV and you would basically hold a stable version of CRV that earns the underlying 20 something percent of the Ve CRV fees if it's staked in the rebalance pool. So you basically can hold a stable version of that asset and earning the fees.
00:50:18.446 - 00:50:37.598, Speaker E: So in that example, you're almost talking about something that acts as a stable coin that could have the potential to earn very high yields. Like, obviously we're speculating and who knows what they will be, but somewhere up in like the 20% of yield on a stableish asset.
00:50:37.714 - 00:51:29.738, Speaker A: Exactly. That's the key. The key is that, from my perspective, what protocol FX has been able to do is turn a volatile asset that earns a very good yield into a non volatile asset that earns the same yield. And so that's game changing for me from my perspective, because so many people want to buy curb or CDX ERV and they want to stake it and they want to earn those fees in a bull market, but they're quick to sell because they're like, oh, it's going to go down 90%. But if there were a way to basically mint the non volatile version and still earn those underlying base fees, which I know are going to still be there even in a bear market, then you've unlocked a lot of potential with protocol effects, if that makes sense.
00:51:29.904 - 00:52:24.682, Speaker B: So if you were going to, let's say, hold a stable version, the f token for, let's say, re rocket pool's re in the future, am I understanding that if they were to move forward with expanding the offerings beyond this f ETH and X e, you could be earning the staked ETH yield through Re, but with a more stable version of re using that. Or I guess the part here that confuses me is today, if you mint Fe or X ETH, your ETH in the rebalance pool is actually being held as Lido's staked ETH. Right? Like that's what's happening today. But maybe there's some change to the model.
00:52:24.816 - 00:53:16.854, Speaker A: What if down the road there's fr E, f XRe? So I can see a world where there'd be 20 of these tokens, all of these yield bearing tokens. And remember, Fracs has high yields, so it's going to be more beneficial to hold in the long run, something like f fracs ETH, deposit that into the rebounds pool and maybe earn 15%, because right now the stake lido is earning 10% because of their incentives. So you could see a world where higher yielding tokens, CRV is a perfect example. You could have those higher yielding tokens. You can have your cake and eat it too, basically. You can basically have a stable asset that earns those high yields.
00:53:16.982 - 00:55:04.906, Speaker B: One other part of the protocol design here that has me a little bit worried is in the next bear market, who's going to be buying those leverage tokens. Because we need folks to be minting like the X ETH or the XR ETH, whatever the token is, x a curve, so that folks can have that stability. Like someone has to absorb that. Now, one idea there that we talked about with the F of X protocol guys, Kruger and Kmets, is that the fact that you can dca into a volatile leveraged version of the token and know that you're not going to get liquidated, assuming everything works as designed, that's already a pretty awesome incentive or offering. So I could see that actually nomadic and I have talked about that here ever since our podcast with them. That one strategy could be that you are dcaing into X E, that you want more exposure, you want that leverage, but you don't want to go to one of the perps protocols and pay some crazy funding rate and run the risk of being liquidated. So is that really it, that we have to depend upon that? Or do you see any other reasons or incentives? Like would there potentially be an FXN token, an incentive in the next bear market? Do we have to plan for that? An incentive for folks to Mint X ETH so that we can have folks there absorbing the volatility as others are holding the stable version?
00:55:05.018 - 00:55:46.620, Speaker A: That's a really good question. It's a really good question. Here's what I think. We're just getting out of a bear market right now, and they've been live for about a month and minting has been really strong. And the truth is, the time you want to mint X ETH is probably right now. Give you an example right now, I think X ETH is like a dollar one, a dollar two per token. If Ethereum were to ten X, and let's just say you get two X of volatility, theoretically you could get a 20 X, which would put that one dollars to $20.
00:55:46.620 - 00:56:37.174, Speaker A: I think that's pie in the sky. I'm aiming more for like twelve to $15, but now would be the time that you would want to mint that. So the truth is, there's always going to be demand, inherited demand both ways for the. And here's the thing, too. If you start getting protocols that want to hold stable versions of ETH, see, that's the part that I don't think like we're thinking about just normal like you and I, we want to earn some yield, but what happens when you have a huge protocol that's like, hey, I want to earn that stake ETH yield, but I don't want price to go down bad. So I'm just going to mint a whole bunch of Effie and they're just going to hold it throughout the whole bear market. Or you could have other strategies, like you could have dgens that want to hold the X token and they're just happy holding the X token.
00:56:37.174 - 00:57:16.034, Speaker A: I think there's times to hold both, obviously, because timing, that is beneficial. You don't want to hold the X token, you don't want to buy a whole bunch of the X Token at the very, very top. But I think the system will inherently balance itself. So I don't think it's going to be too much of a problem. The only thing that I am really concerned with, the big scary thing with protocol FX, is probably holding just the X token, not the F token. And I'll explain that if you hold the X token and something bad happens, like Ethereum goes down 50% in a day. Okay, that would be a very bad day for all of Ethereum.
00:57:16.034 - 00:57:45.840, Speaker A: First of all, that wouldn't be just a bad day for protocol effects. That would be a bad day across the board. But let's say if that were to happen, that would cause all of the liquidity to be sucked out of X E. And so your claim to that two x leverage would be gone because it's no longer there. It's basically compressed. But they have the stability pool, they have stability mechanisms in place. They have incentives to try and offset some of that, which is great.
00:57:45.840 - 00:58:43.620, Speaker A: And I think the likelihood of something like that happening is probably very low. But that would be the only really big concern is buying, having X ETH at the very top and then something suddenly dropping. It would have to be like a black swan event. And the reason why I don't feel the same way about F ETH is because f ETH, if all bad things happened with Fe, you would still get a claim to the underlying ethereum. So maybe ethereum is only worth $400, but you would still get that $400 Ethereum x ETH holders would get zero. That's the scary part. So a protocol wants to hold something stableish and they're okay with the 10% upside volatility, and they're cool with earning 10% in a stability pool for the foreseeable future, then Fe is safer because the underlying asset is still ethereum and you have a claim to that underlying asset, even if it goes to like $100.
00:58:43.620 - 00:58:57.880, Speaker A: So you can pull your ethereum out at. It would be a bad day for everybody and probably an existential risk to the wool market, but at least it's functioning. It's doing what it's intended to do, if that makes sense.
00:58:58.270 - 00:59:23.202, Speaker E: Totally makes sense. I want to jump to Prisma now. I think Defi dad and I have both seen you tweeting a lot about prisma, especially about you kind of coined this term drop lock. Maybe kind of walk us through your high level thoughts about how you're thinking about prisma and kind of like its place in this group that we're talking about.
00:59:23.336 - 01:00:23.074, Speaker A: Okay, so the drop block, basically everybody got their airdrop who voted for the whitelisting on curve. And basically I started seeing on these websites, different websites that are voting proposals where you could claim your CVX prisma instead of just your Prisma reward. And so I immediately realized that what was happening was they had devised a system where you could opt to get all of your airdrop reward, 100% of it as CVX Prisma if you locked with convex. It didn't say that in the proposal, but it's obvious that's what was happening, or you would have to wait 52 weeks for the ve Prisma to vest to you. So in a bear market PTSD, nobody wants to wait 52 weeks. Everybody wants their money now. And that's what they did.
01:00:23.074 - 01:01:20.114, Speaker A: And so the incentives were aligned, and convex was very astute to do that. Right? They were aligned to create something where people were incentivized to claim and lock as convex, as CVX Prisma. And so now it's taking it even a step further and doing it with what I call farm and lock. So as these emissions are getting farmed, which is what's happening right now, which is why you see the number go up on the emissions. As far as what convex is locking, as they're getting farmed, they're being locked into convex right now. So again, the alignment, the incentive alignment for them to basically have all of their emissions and be able to sell into the deep liquidity pools that convex has set up. And so what does that result? What does that create, you have the situation where convex is consuming the protocol as it's being farmed, literally.
01:01:20.114 - 01:02:09.394, Speaker A: And the first month of prisma emissions is 9 million tokens. So it's a very big upfront. So in the next month a huge portion of you're going to see that number, I think it's at 60 something percent, right, or 50% of prisma being locked up in convex. You're going to see that number slowly creep up as time passes. And with that they're going to gain the voting power. And what does that voting power give us? Well, the voting power, you can see they've already done one vote to increase the interest rate, right? So they went from 1% to 2%. Well that obviously aligns with what convex wants, right? And I think that everybody wants, including Prisma, not only the actual voting rights, but you also have the rights to the emissions.
01:02:09.394 - 01:03:05.350, Speaker A: So prisma emissions, now whatever is left over that is not owned by investors or the airdrop. That portion, I think it's 62 million from what I read. And the tokenomics, right, the 62 million prisma is basically now controlled by convex voting power. And so now think of it this way, Convex has power over those 62 million prisma emissions right? Now over the course of the next couple of years, the question becomes now where do those emissions go? And so we saw that last week, that one vote went through. We had one gauge vote so far and a large majority went to the stability pool, which is good for the health of MKUSD. And a portion went to staked, Frax, ETH, Lido. I mean it was spread out.
01:03:05.350 - 01:04:23.374, Speaker A: It wasn't just one. But because Frax owns a large portion of convex, they're voting for their staked version, their LSD, which is going to get other people involved like rocket pool and Lido eventually, hopefully. And they're going to want to vote for their pools or they're going to have to pay to vote for their pools because a new bribe market just emerged. So we have vodium now and hidden hand that have both created vote markets for Prisma emissions. So now if you're a CVX holder, you're now going to get paid for those votes for the Prisma emissions to those liquid staking derivative vaults. But the piece that I think nobody understands or nobody's really factoring into this equation is that it's not just the four or five vaults that are in the system the way Prisma is designed. You can vote on convex pools so you're actually able to vote on specific curve pools to get the Prisma emissions which now it's kind of a bolt on to what curve is doing with their CRV token.
01:04:23.374 - 01:04:41.010, Speaker A: So I can be in a pool that earns FXS, Prisma, CRV, CDX and it all goes to the curve pool, not just to the underlying vault, if that makes sense. And that's where I think the Prisma wars begins.
01:04:41.170 - 01:05:22.418, Speaker E: I have a question on some of what you just said and it's kind of regarding rocket pool with re and Lido with Steph. Have you seen any indication of these two big players? I guess paying attention to Prisma? I know it's on the radar obviously, but have you seen any of these players accumulating any sort of voting power here or what would they be accumulating in order to kind of do what you mentioned Fracs did? Or do you think they'll be just more active in these hidden head or Vodia markets? How do they get in on this? And is there any indication that they are?
01:05:22.504 - 01:06:12.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there is some early signs, but I mean I don't have any first hand knowledge but I think they're going to be participating in the vote markets for sure. And so that's both of them probably hidden hand and vodium. And I do think that they may decide that it's more advantageous for them to buy convex at these prices. So they may buy convex and hold it and lock and then vote for their own pool or they may go the bribing or incentivizing. Either way it's positive convex holders. And so that's why I keep thinking about what they did with prisma is genius because they've just created another market for convex lockers. Does that make sense?
01:06:12.824 - 01:06:32.010, Speaker E: I wonder, did any of these protocols like Lido or rocket pool foresee any of this? And have any of them already accumulated any convex, do you think? I don't want to say like they've been blindsided. It just might not have been their intent to do this. But I'm just curious if either one has already been active in accumulating any of this.
01:06:32.080 - 01:07:24.940, Speaker A: I think Frax knew early on like they were going to win this game and they knew that. I'm assuming they had some kind of knowledge that a lot of locking was going to take place with Prisma and they were going to be able to vote with their CVX. So I would say of all of the LSD providers, I think Frax knew what was going to happen, right? I don't think Rocket pool or lido were thinking about that I don't think it was top of their mind. I do think there's some others like origin ETH got a proposal up now to be integrated with Prisma and they hold a lot of CVX. So I know that's going to happen. I'm assuming hidden hand redacted cartel with their PX ETH, they hold a lot of CVX. I'm assuming they're going to be on the Prisma platform soon.
01:07:24.940 - 01:07:57.010, Speaker A: And of course, clever. We were talking about Aladdin, I'm assuming because they're going to do something with Cleve ETH and they have a lot of CVX. I think that they're probably a candidate as well if they end up doing something with a liquid sticking derivative. So yeah, I think there's a lot of players that are smaller players that are looking to come on board Prisma. But I do think that rocket pool and Lido are probably likely to participate in vote incentives.
01:07:57.090 - 01:08:47.398, Speaker B: So if I'm rocket pool or Lido or any other LST protocol and I want to harness the power of Prisma, do you think the better play here then is to just accumulate CVX? Given the fact that convex controls so much of it? I had thought previously about this and thought Prisma would kind of get bought up by then. But now that I've got the more complete picture in my mind of all that convex is absorbing, if you're an ETH LST protocol, I could see just accumulating CVX. Maybe that derisks the strategy of accumulating that versus only accumulating Prisma. I don't know any other thoughts on that.
01:08:47.484 - 01:09:41.506, Speaker A: They have a couple of options. They can buy Prisma and lock it, but they have to lock for a year to get the full blown effect, right? So 52 weeks full blown lock. Or they could buy CVX, which automatically has a full blown lock and just lock for 16 weeks, or they could bribe. So how is this all positive CVX? Well, if they buy Prisma, the Prisma price goes up, right? So if it goes from a dollar to $2 because they're crazy aping into Prisma, then that raises the intrinsic value of what's getting locked, what's already locked in convex. If they buy convex, well then the price of convex goes up, right? And if they bribe, well then the lockers of convex lockers are going to get incentives for locking their convex. So every ETH LSD is going to have, I think a different strategy. If they're smaller, they're probably going to bribe.
01:09:41.506 - 01:10:39.862, Speaker A: If they're bigger and they're smarter, they probably should. And this is not financial advice to anybody, but especially a protocol. But if I were a rocket pool, I probably would buy convex because it's relatively cheap and it probably has appreciative power, right? So it probably will go up in value. So I can lock it for 16 week periods at a time. I can wait for it to reach a certain price and sell it if I don't need it anymore. Or I could just go the bribe route and decide to bribe for the next year or so and maybe that's just cheaper for them in the long run than holding the asset. But you see how because convex has locked up the majority portion of Prisma, any emissions or any remaining prisma in the market that gets bought up by the LSDs to lock up pushes the price up of Prisma, which is sort of like, this is what we keep talking about, this flywheel effect, right? So you can see where that becomes intrinsic for convex holders.
01:10:39.926 - 01:11:01.310, Speaker E: I want to talk just quickly about the Prisma kind of ETH. TvL we saw it obviously explode up with launch. It's kind of like leveled out and teetering down a bit. What do you think are next steps to kind of reignite that excitement of getting more ETH into the protocol? I mean, it's done an incredible job.
01:11:01.380 - 01:12:21.538, Speaker A: Like, don't get me wrong, it's pretty impressive launch. I mean, I think it hit 300 million really early on. Look, I think because of the emissions and because of the voting power, I think you're going to see, well, first of all, I think we need to see more get onto the platform more LSDs, which we're going to start to see. And then I think you're going to see the Prisma wars, right? You're going to see people wanting to accumulate CVX, wanting to accumulate Prisma so that they can vote for their pools, because what's going to happen right now is, and again, it's all relative, the interest rates on fracs vault are going to be a lot higher and so it's going to incentivize minting fracs ETH. If you're being paid essentially by Prisma to take out a loan with fracs, then you're going to opt to choose frax over, say, lido. If the interest rate on Lido is 10% and the interest rate on FraCs is 40%, that's a big difference, and that's what the emissions are doing. So I think in the long run you're going to see a battle there as far as who gets these emissions and who has the highest APY, and that's what's going to cause an explosion in TDL.
01:12:21.538 - 01:12:42.238, Speaker A: As of more the bull market rages in, you're going to see a lot more staking of ETH. And a protocol like Prism is probably going to benefit because it's a very good way to extract value in the form of MKUSD. And especially with the emissions, you're going to get additional value though.
01:12:42.324 - 01:13:03.526, Speaker E: One thing we haven't talked about yet, crypto Vester, is just so with Prisma, they haven't even turned on the kind of value accrual fee mechanism for the protocol. So I think that's coming soon. But maybe just if you can kind of touch on or speculate what effect you think that'll have kind of downstream throughout the protocol, that'd be great.
01:13:03.628 - 01:13:38.702, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Again, it just ties into the voting power. Right. So after convex is able to accumulate a majority vote, I think that it's poetic that now the next thing they did was to raise interest rates, which I think is not just a convex thing. I think that it's part of what helped maintain the peg. Right. Part of the reason why it went off peg was because there was a huge demand for MKUSD at very cheap rates and that kind of caused an imbalance in pools.
01:13:38.702 - 01:14:31.922, Speaker A: So it was important to kind of raise rates that were more in line with other stablecoins. So that happened and obviously majority voted for that and that passed. And I think now the next step is probably a fee switch. I know that I've listened in the discord and I know that they are talking about it. I don't believe it's fully developed yet, but I think that it will come within the next few weeks. And I can only imagine that that is going to, first the fee switch is going to be turned on, right. So that's going to allow the fees from the interest rate and mints and all this to go to ve Prisma lockers and then by default it's going to trickle to CVX, Prisma stakers, if that makes sense.
01:14:31.922 - 01:14:46.022, Speaker A: So yeah, I think that's in the cards. I think that's going to happen within a few weeks. I think it's part of the game plan. Again, more of the value that's accruing to the convex and curve ecosystem, if that makes sense.
01:14:46.156 - 01:15:00.538, Speaker E: And I want to say, don't quote me on this, but I think the fees generated just over this initial launch are pretty massive, like very material. I want to say it's somewhere in like the $3 million range, but something like that.
01:15:00.624 - 01:15:38.706, Speaker A: Yeah, something like that. And it's partially because of the prisma that got, because a lot of people who were early farmers, they lucked and they took the 50% hit. And so that was considered like money back in the bank for them. That's part of their fees. So that plus the interest, the introductory interest rate of 1% and some of the other, the mint fees as well, all tallied up to something like that. You can imagine a world where I think there's 50 billion staked right now ETH somewhere around there. So there's only 300 million in these vaults.
01:15:38.706 - 01:16:35.078, Speaker A: I mean, I can imagine 5 billion in there. That's a conservative number. I think we saw liquidity at its peak, probably had 3 billion at one point. So now with more staking going on and a lot more time, I could only imagine that because of the emissions, and I think that's what's being missed because of the emissions, it literally pays to take out a loan. So it's not just, oh, I'm getting an extra 5% and like some cases you might be getting 30% and only paying on your loan 3%. So if that happens, then if you had staked ETH, why would you not want to put it in there, earn the extra yield and take out the MKUSD? And so that's, I think, the dynamic that I don't think liquidity had. And that's what I think they approved on with Prisma.
01:16:35.254 - 01:17:53.202, Speaker B: Yeah, well said. I think one of the more obvious opportunities since the Prisma launch was to open up a vault and to put the MK USD into something like one of the stablecoin LPs earn with that get paid in Prisma token far more than the 2% now, but previously 1% interest rate. I will point out though, that there was a period here where there were redemptions happening. Do you have any thoughts on that? At the end of the day, Prisma is a fork of liquidity. It's made a number of tweaks, like the fact that there is a borrowing interest rate, which I think will play out well for token holders that look to benefit from the revenue or fee capture there. But one of the features of the original liquidy design that still lives within Prisma is this idea of redemptions. Actually, maybe you could just explain what did happen when mkusd fell to like, it's below zero point 95.
01:17:53.202 - 01:17:55.910, Speaker B: Is that where it triggers it?
01:17:55.980 - 01:18:56.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the increased demand because of the low interest rate caused the peg to suffer a little bit. But you're right, part of the whole mechanism is redemptions, and Prisma is not immune to liquidations. It's part of the system, the way the system is designed. I'd have to read a little bit more because it's very new to me still, but I do think they've created certain, and they're still working on a few tweaks that are going to happen in the future to improve the whole redemption mechanism, the peg stability. They're going to do certain really creative things with the stability pool. From what I understood, they won't release the information, they won't leak it, but I've heard them say that they're going to do certain things to make it more cost efficient. And so there's a lot of little things that they've made changes to with liquidity fork or with the liquidity code.
01:18:56.040 - 01:19:04.410, Speaker A: I know it's a liquidity fork and I know it's based on liquidity, but they've done so many changes to this that it's really another beast.
01:19:04.830 - 01:19:31.380, Speaker B: We'll probably start to wrap up soon, but one part of the defi portfolio of yours that we haven't covered is fracs. And so I'm wondering, what alpha can you share about the development of fracs chain that's coming? And then there's this thing called the bam, which I'd love for you to break down for us. Like what is it and what does it mean?
01:19:31.830 - 01:20:26.562, Speaker A: Okay, so I don't have the most up to date knowledge on it because it is one of those things that they're not leaking a lot of information about. But I do know that Fraxchain is in development. It's coming within the next couple of months. I think that it's scheduled to be launched in January. I think the novelty that people are missing with Fraxchain is that, from what I understand from what Sam said in telegram, is that they're somehow incentivizing the block space of the chain. So they're incentivizing the users by giving them Frax ETH rebates on gas and somehow incentivizing the actual developer of the application. So the more block space they use, the more incentives they get through the chain.
01:20:26.562 - 01:21:02.938, Speaker A: So you can imagine a situation where the chain explodes in value because similar to what happened with base, because there's actually incentives being paid as the chain is being used and the block space is being used. So that's kind of new. That's never been seen with an L two before. And so I think that's something that I think would be kind of explosive, being able to use block space, incentivized block space on a chain for both the users of the d app and also the actual creators of the d app.
01:21:03.044 - 01:21:09.986, Speaker E: Yeah, that's very cool. Do you know which l two, where they're building this?
01:21:10.088 - 01:21:39.114, Speaker A: It's some kind of hybrid roll up. I don't even really know 100%. I think it's like ZK. It's a bond of two. I think it's like something really they've created. They've taken code, and they've modified the code to make something completely new. And you're going to be able to roll out other versions of this thing, hopefully, because that's what Frax's vision is, to be able to have other dows want to use this chain technology.
01:21:39.114 - 01:21:53.562, Speaker A: And so what I was saying is this whole incentivization at the base level with the chain is something we haven't seen with l two s before, and that's something that Frax is doing with their frac chain.
01:21:53.626 - 01:22:09.638, Speaker E: Yeah, that's super cool. I think that's a road that Kanto was going down at one point. Like incentivization of the dev side. Like, hey, if you come and build something incredible and tons of people use it, there's incentives for you for doing that.
01:22:09.724 - 01:22:41.070, Speaker A: Right. And so I can see an explosion on chain, especially on that chain, because of those incentives. And I imagine a world where you have all the suite of products, the Frax product, Frax len, Frax swap staked, Frax, Frax ferry, all living on chain in its own sort of app chain world. But I don't think it's just exclusive to Fracs. I think you're going to see a huge amount of development on that chain because of that incentivization. So you'll see curve move there. You'll see a lot of really interesting products.
01:22:41.070 - 01:22:49.326, Speaker A: You might even see a convex on frac shape. Who knows? That's kind of speculation, but possible crypto.
01:22:49.358 - 01:23:29.838, Speaker B: Vester, I want to end the conversation asking you to potentially give us one more protocol that we should learn about. So we've covered quite a bit of ground here. We definitely would love to have you back, I think, potentially, to talk more about fracs and probably a bit more about these other projects. But could you tell us any other projects that you are monitoring or participating in? Any others that we might check out if we have an interest in all the different protocols we covered today?
01:23:29.924 - 01:23:55.766, Speaker A: Yeah. One that I'm looking at really closely is convergence, which is another curve ecosystem product. It is super complicated, like has lots of moving parts. It combines the mechanics of Olympus. So the bonding mechanism of Olympus with ve tokenomics. So their goal is to acquire as much. This is why it interested me.
01:23:55.766 - 01:24:20.798, Speaker A: I thought it was interesting. Their goal is to acquire as much CVX and governance tokens like Fracs and curve. They had a soft launch I think a couple of months ago. I think two or three months ago they acquired, I don't know, it was just a small amount, but it was just a test to see how it went. But basically to put it for your audience, simple. They are trying to be the lockers of lock. So they are trying to lock up as much convex as much.
01:24:20.798 - 01:24:37.622, Speaker A: It's amazing. It's like crazy. As much curve power, fraps, IO FXS is in there and staked Dow is also part of that equation. So I encourage people to or you guys to take a look at convergence as the broker that I'm watching. Cool.
01:24:37.676 - 01:24:59.242, Speaker B: So CVG finance, you can learn about that there. You could also follow that Twitter handle for convergence. It looks like it's convergence underscore Phi and we'll put that into the show notes. That's totally new. I was not following that. Never had heard of that. So that's really cool to hear about something new.
01:24:59.242 - 01:25:23.710, Speaker B: And the lockers of lockers makes sense to me. I do wonder where the line is drawn where folks no longer see value in these wrapper types of protocols. But I think the simple answer is the market will tell us it'll decide based on those tokens.
01:25:23.790 - 01:26:04.270, Speaker A: There must be some type of diminishing returns at some point. But for right now, I think we're in the early days of seeing what can be created. I've talked to the founder of convergence and I think that what they're doing is pretty impressive. So we'll see if they are able to lock up a lot of CVX and lock up a lot of FXs and other locking or governance tokens and seeing where that leads. But I think it's going to be something to watch because it's using that Olympus model, the bonding mechanism, to attract the tokens into the system. So it's kind of an interesting dynamic and interesting protocol.
01:26:04.350 - 01:26:44.714, Speaker B: I want to remind our listeners then that they can follow you on Twitter. So it's crypto vestor. The handle is cryptovester 77. Can find that in our show notes. Crypto vestor, thanks so much for taking so much time today to talk with us about all the different protocols we covered, and I really want to do the usual here, give you the final word if there's any other call to action or recommendation for folks that want to learn more about all the protocols that we covered. So yeah, anyway, thank you so much for your time and just really enjoyed the conversation.
01:26:44.842 - 01:27:11.158, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you guys. Thanks for having me on here. I really appreciate it. Look forward to doing other podcasts with you in the future. I would say let people I think that they should focus on a few core protocols that they really enjoy. For me, it's in the curve ecosystem, but it might be different for other people. I think that they should hone in on that on their two or three favorite protocols and try and get a good understanding of what they can do.
01:27:11.158 - 01:27:13.958, Speaker A: And I think that's good advice for the upcoming bull run.
01:27:14.044 - 01:27:50.410, Speaker B: That is awesome advice for the bull run. Don't get too overwhelmed trying to chase every shiny object. If you can find a protocol that really makes sense to you, or at least that you can dissect enough to understand why it is succeeding, or even why it's failing, there's a lot to take from that into the next protocol that you discover.
