00:00:00.240 - 00:00:45.062, Speaker A: One of the benefits of the Dex that it will have because it's using the same liquidity which is used for the lending market. Dex LP's will be earning both lending and trading fees. So if you have a dexlp on fluid, and if you have like ABC token paired with ETH, the EtH part of Zlbdev is earning lending fees. Plus the whole LP is earning trading fees. So for absolutely every project which has LP on fluid, they have by default they have a better conditions than on any other decks. Only because, you know, on other decks you only have trading fees. Yeah.
00:00:45.062 - 00:00:48.890, Speaker A: Here you will have lending fees and trading fees.

00:03:45.492 - 00:03:48.644, Speaker B: DMH, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:48.772 - 00:03:58.476, Speaker A: Hi, guys. Really glad to be here. Thank you for inviting me. And I'm excited to share more news about Fluidx.
00:03:58.588 - 00:04:51.348, Speaker B: We've previously covered fluid as a lending and borrowing protocol. It brings to market a lot of innovations if you go back and listen to previous episodes. We interviewed Samyak Jane, who is one of the co founders of Instadap, and you'll note that the protocol itself, it has very high loan to value ratios. It has better rates, generally for lenders and borrowers. It has some really innovative approaches to security. And what we're really excited to talk about today, and we'll let DMH talk more about this, is that we now have this feature that is smart collateral and smart debt, which is powered by the fluid deck. So we're going to talk all about that and liquidation penalties and how all of this is improved through the launch of fluid Dex.
00:04:51.348 - 00:05:04.586, Speaker B: So, DMH, can you kick us off with just a little bit more about your background? Like, how did you get into crypto? And would love to learn more about, like, how did you end up at instadapp or working on fluid?
00:05:04.738 - 00:05:45.560, Speaker A: Sure, guys, so you know my story, how I got into crypto. I was working in completely different industry related to oil and gas. And in 2020, when because of the COVID there was a big lockdown and all airports were shot and people couldn't move. I was working abroad at that moment, was not able to come back to all. So at that moment, I didn't like my job. And at that moment, I realized, okay, I'm never coming, coming back here. So I decided to learn something new because I had my higher education, which I wasted six years for.
00:05:45.560 - 00:06:32.374, Speaker A: I didn't have, like, any other skills. I didn't know what else I can do. So I was looking into new opportunities. I was looking, what can I do? Initially I was thinking about coding, but I researched a little bit about that and I realized that it's not the most excited work to do. So I was researching further, and then I heard about crypto. I heard that people make money somehow, and I decided to research more about it. So I was, for six months, I was just reading books, let's say, about crypto.
00:06:32.374 - 00:07:02.780, Speaker A: What is it about trading about different stuff. And after six months, I tried to buy my first crypto. Then I was still actively researching crypto. And then at one moment, I heard about DeFi. I heard that people can lend money and hard on it, like, you don't need any banks and to do any paper job to get this interest and so on. So I was really excited. Wow, it's interesting.
00:07:02.780 - 00:07:41.538, Speaker A: Everyone can have access to this and people can have access to something. What, in real world, only super wealthy people can have access to people in DeFi, people can borrow against the network. This is not possible for normal people in normal life. So I got excited about that and I started learning. I mean, I started using defi myself. And after some time I realized that I can try to write about it. I've never tried, I never wrote myself.
00:07:41.538 - 00:08:32.632, Speaker A: Like, I didn't have social media, so I was not writing, but I tried. And people started reading me, people started following me. And one moment investment fund reached me out and they hired me. And also, like, it was in April 2022 when I, I wrote a big threat about Luna USD, which got more than like 1 million views. And I had a very small account that time, so it became really viral. A lot of people started following me, and since then I started growing. So in that thread, I mentioned that UST is not sustainable, cannot work like that.
00:08:32.632 - 00:09:11.180, Speaker A: And I didn't expect that in one month it will collapse to zero. But this is what happened. And then I got even more followers because people came back to, back to my thread and they say, okay, he told that, yeah, that's my small background. Yeah. And since then, I was working in the investment fund and I was writing about crypto, working with different projects from time to time. It was always my goal to be part of the project. I had several small startups, which all failed, to be honest.
00:09:11.180 - 00:10:11.460, Speaker A: And in October 2023, Instada published a blog article about fluid. I read that article, I realized that this is the most exciting thing in Defi I have ever seen. And I started writing about instead of about fluid. And it was like really interesting for me, and I got in touch with the team, I was helping them here, like just sharing my thoughts and views and stuff like that. And after some time they offered me to join them. And since April 2024, so only few months before I joined Instab full time. And I'm super happy, super excited about it, because I know that fluid will become the biggest protocol in Defi.
00:10:11.460 - 00:10:19.172, Speaker A: Other people don't know it yet, but they will see it. And you know, that's why I'm happy, because I already know that this will happen.
00:10:19.276 - 00:11:12.398, Speaker C: DMH, I think when you kind of first noticed that fluid article back in October, it was probably shortly thereafter that you and I started communicating just a bit about fluid as well. I think we were going back and forth with some DM's, just about how excited we were about it, because I totally agree, it represents something really big and novel in Defi, something that we haven't really seen before. So that's why Defi, dad and myself have been covering it quite a bit over these last many months. Fluid went live, I think around three months ago. Correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe you can just give us where it's at today as far as the current product suite, before we jump into more about the Dex, I think right now we've got the borrowing and lending live and the liquidity layer, but maybe break down what that means. And just again, where we're at today.
00:11:12.574 - 00:11:55.730, Speaker A: The first thing which I'm trying to explain about fluid, that it's not a lending and borrowing market, it's not a Dex or something. Fluid is a liquidity layer. It might sound strange, and different projects called themselves liquidity layer, but yeah, fluid is liquidity layer. On top of liquidity layer, we build different protocols which utilize the same liquidity. First one is lending protocols, second one is vault protocols, which are, if you combine them, this lending and borrowing protocol, we also have a small protocol which is called stake ETH redemption protocol. It's like mini application, it's like a mini application. And the next big protocol will be Dex protocol.
00:11:55.730 - 00:13:15.052, Speaker A: And in the future, we expect there will be tens, maybe hundreds of different protocols built on. Some will be small ones, some will be big ones. I don't know when this podcast will go live, but we launched in the end of February, and to the first three months, in 1st 19 days, we reached a market size of 800 million, which is pretty nice because I mean, initially we wanted to reach that market size, but when we were planning that the market was different and then all these points meta started and then attracting lenders was very difficult. But we also took advantage of that. We were able to offer this good leverage conditions for the users and the safest on the market. People were not getting liquidated on fluid and we were using this oracles which track contract backing and yeah, and this way we were able, you know, we were charging a lot of interest on the borrowing side. I mean borrowers were paying high API and this API was basically redistributed to other markets.
00:13:15.052 - 00:13:53.194, Speaker A: That's why leading KBRS was stable stakeholders, 20% and it was purely from the borrowing fees. But those borrowing fees were coming from other markets. That's how flexible is fluid. We can stream this capital flows, money flow inside the fluid, can stream them where we need them the most. On fluid. We still have only very few markets whitelisted like USDT, USDC, Stakey 35. We'll be adding more assets in the future.
00:13:53.194 - 00:15:03.766, Speaker A: In the near future, maybe they will be already live by the time we launch. The podcast is live. One is them with RebTC and also we are exploring PT assets from Pendle. It's not very easy to get them on the lending market because people get fixed yield and in case conditions change for them, in case borrowing rates become very high, their fixed rate went down, they have to realize their loss and this will be very if they take leverage, they will realize a loss at leverage. So if PTSD goes down 2% and they have ten x leverage, they will have a 20% loss. So PTS is something, is definitely something we exploring and we want to add, but it's completely from the UX side. We want people to have safe conditions.
00:15:03.766 - 00:15:14.966, Speaker A: We are not interested to listen acetone and react our users and this part is difficult, but we will see if we can find a good solution for that.
00:15:15.118 - 00:16:14.584, Speaker B: I want to chime in on my own experience using fluids. So far I have mostly used it to be able to create a leverage position with ETH as the collateral. I think I've been borrowing Steth and this was a really popular farm for Etherfi season two and I mean just some of the notes I had been thinking through in preparation for the interview is just so in general, rates have been higher. So for lenders that's been fantastic. There was an adjustment there to the interest rate model and that's hugely helped folks like myself who are creating positions where you're borrowing. It's very gas efficient. I can speak to the fact that having used AavE and maker and spark and morpho, I'm definitely spending less gas.
00:16:14.584 - 00:17:14.448, Speaker B: It's very anecdotal, but just in terms of the current gas prices on Ethereum main net, that's been a real perk. Another reason I started using fluid was just because of the higher loan to value ratios that are offered, and I think that hasn't come to full vision yet. There's much more ambitious goals. Being able to borrow up to 95% against ETH with something like a stablecoin. And then I think the other thing that really attracted me is the lower liquidation penalties. As far as I know, they're as low as 0.1%. I do want to get right into fluid Dex, but DMH, are you able to talk a little bit about some of the benefits of these lower liquidation penalties, or just how does it work at a very high level? You don't have to go into the weeds on this, but how can a liquidation penalty be as low as 0.1%
00:17:14.448 - 00:17:24.686, Speaker B: when I. I think it's like 1013, 15% on comparable CDP protocols or lending and borrowing types of protocols?
00:17:24.838 - 00:18:14.650, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a very good question. Thank you. Suite leading and borrowing markets has different architecture than any other lending market. Any other lending protocol in the market, how? We already have the highest ltvs and the lowest liquidation penalties, and we have highest lending rates on the market. And probably we aim to have like 50% more lending rates than our competitors. And we probably have like 100% for some assets, maybe 400% if you're talking about if we have better conditions. But because fluid is new, people are still hesitating to move the liquidity from other protocols to fluid.
00:18:14.650 - 00:19:17.410, Speaker A: But I assume in next few months, a lot of liquidity will start flowing to fluid. So why? I'm saying we have different architectures. There are a lot of really a lot of small features which we make different, and they allow us to have a better efficiency and better safety on every part of zlenic and boring markets, including oracles, including limits and interest rate curves and everything. But the main difference, the biggest difference is liquidation model. So how liquidations are happening on other markets? For example, there are ten positions which are flexible liquidation. Then liquidator has to come and to liquidate each position one by one. And he should have like a big bounty to perform his liquidations.
00:19:17.410 - 00:20:20.796, Speaker A: And normally on the gas price, liquidators are paying another liquidation. Lending markets are very high, maybe 1015 times more than liquidators are paying on fluid. We have this part very well optimized and. Yeah, and liquidator has to come and liquidate those positions one by one on fluid, you can imagine that all collateral is stored as a Dex liquidity at discount. So it's a slot based approach. Wherever I, this bad debt, let's say, I mean the debt which has to be liquidated, it's stored as just as an arranged border in the deck, on the decks. And when liquidator has to liquidate position on fluid, he'll create a limited amount of positions in a single transaction.
00:20:20.796 - 00:21:07.068, Speaker A: So it can be one position can be 1 million positions which he has to liquidate. He liquidates all of them with one transaction, which is as simple as just a swap on any index. And liquidations on fluid are connected to the dex aggregators. So sometimes just people who do the trades on the dex, they can be liquidated themselves and they get a discount on their swaps. This is just a high level explanation. The main thing is that all liquidity is stored, all collateral is stored as a tax liquid discount. That's the main point.
00:21:07.164 - 00:21:25.350, Speaker C: Yeah, I appreciate that. I think one of the coolest things about that, when I first heard it was just that idea that liquidations are actually tied into Dex aggregators and I, they're actually helping solve for these like liquidations, which is, which is pretty cool.
00:21:27.810 - 00:22:16.220, Speaker B: Before we get back to the show, just a quick thanks to our sponsor at Mantle Network, the L2 that pioneered the fifth largest LST with 1.6 billion TvL called Mat. Since July 1, Mantle is running a 100 day airdrop campaign called Metamorphosis to distribute a new governance token for the mantle liquid staking protocol called Cook. The community can earn points for cook called powder, by holding meth in metamorphosis and simultaneously enjoying other yield and reward opportunities in the mantle ecosystem. Users can also earn powder by staking MNT in the Mantle Rewards station. For more details, go to the Mantle blog at Mantle xYz blockchain blog and follow the Zero X mantle handle on Twitter for more updates.
00:22:18.680 - 00:22:53.458, Speaker C: Maybe let's get more into the deck. So just to reiterate, you mentioned fluid is basically a liquidity layer and you're now building, I guess apps and products on top of this liquidity layer. So you started with the lending platform, then the vault platform, and this next kind of like layer on top of the liquidity layer is going to be the Dex. Maybe speak to it at just a high level to start. There's definitely more components we'll dive into, but just at a high level, what are you building with this new Dex on top of the liquidity layer?
00:22:53.554 - 00:23:54.924, Speaker A: So the main benefit of the Dex there are so many of them, this one is not the way. So one of the benefits of the Dex that it will have, because it's using the same liquidity which is used for the leading market, DeX LP's will be earning both lending and trading fees. So if you have a DeXLp on fluid, and if you have like ABC token paired with the east part of the LB is earning lending fees, plus the whole LP is earning trading fees. So for absolutely every project which has LP on fluid, they have by default, they have a better conditions than on any other decks. Only because, you know, on other decks you only have trading fees. Yeah. Here you will have lending fees and trading fees.
00:23:54.924 - 00:24:53.750, Speaker A: And if your asset is also at least a test collateral, and it also has landing fees, then you will have landing fees on both part of your token. For example, like if BTC LP, both BTC and ETH will be used as a collateral. So both of them will have landing fees plus you have trading fees on the LP part. But the main innovations on the Dex are smart collateral and smart debt. So with smart collateral, smart collateral is this DeXLP which we have on fluid Dex, but it is whitelisted as a collateral. So you can imagine that you are borrowing against NLP token. For example, you have stake ETH, EtH LP first, yeah, your earning legit fees, your trading, your earning trading fees and you can borrow against this collateral.
00:24:53.750 - 00:25:47.160, Speaker A: And when the root, when the trade is routed through the smart collateral, you can imagine that the trader is borrowing one part of the debt and repaying another part of the debt, sorry. And lending other part of the debt. So if he swaps rep state eth for eth, he lends more stake etH on behalf of the user, of the owner of the LP, and he borrows more eth on his behalf. You can imagine this way. And the trading fee which the trader pays, it goes to the smart collateral. So smart collateral is growing in size. So smart collateral gets a trade increase and lending fees.
00:25:47.160 - 00:26:31.640, Speaker A: But smart collateral, I mean it is an innovation. But you can still think that this is like your borrowing against LP token which already happened on, which already happened before in defi, despite those LP's didn't have any fees. But still the biggest innovation is markdebdeze. Smart debt allows to use a debt instead of tokens. So to use debt as a liquidity instead of the tokens. How it works. For example, you have a smart debt of USDT and USDC, you land at ETH, you are borrowing smart debt of USDT in USDC.
00:26:31.640 - 00:27:31.216, Speaker A: As a borrower you accept that your dapp can be in one or another token and it can be in USDT or USDC. So when a trade is routed through the smart debt, you can imagine that trader is repaying one part of the debt and borrowing another part of the debt. So he is repaying your USDC part of the debt and he is borrowing more USDT on your behalf. And because we were allowed to use adapt as trading, liquidancing, it brings very high capital efficiency. I mean, like, you don't even need capital to have this, to have liquidity on the decks. And because it's like lending and borrowing market, you can, yeah, you can loop your position. Imagine like you have normal leading market, you have stake, if looping position.
00:27:31.216 - 00:28:06.174, Speaker A: Same here. You have your collateral and debt and you can loop this position. And for example, if we are talking about just USDT, use the C smart debt and smart collateral. If we are talking about 95% LTV, that's 20 x leverage. At 20 x leverage, you will have 20 x of your collateral and 19 x of your debt. So you will be paying, sorry, you will be receiving 20 x lending fees. You will be paying 19 x of borrowing fees and you are getting 39 x of trading fees.
00:28:06.174 - 00:28:54.664, Speaker A: Because your liquidity, your effective liquidity position is 39 x. So if you deposit 1 million, you can leverage a position up to $39 million and you get trading fees on $39 million. Plus this position is concentrated on fluid decks. We, we'll have concentrated positions. It's like something between Univ two and Univ three. So on the UX side, the user experience side, they just select a pool and they deposit the query there. But when the pool created, I mean, the governance determines what will be parameters of the pool and what is the concentration of the pool.
00:28:54.664 - 00:29:57.666, Speaker A: So the range order can be very tight, like 1% or 0.1% or whatever. So you receive trading fees on the $39 million of concentrated liquidity. We did some math, actually looked. There was a contributor from the math capital. He did math and he calculated that at the current market rates, with the past data of the trading volume, like Uniswap and so on, with this position, users will be getting 200 something percent APR or unstable pair, which is very exciting. But also we realize that after we launch the fluid decks, we will need some time to stabilize the markets because there will be a lot of demand for this lending and borrowing and looping and so on.
00:29:57.666 - 00:30:13.982, Speaker A: And we will need time to stabilize the markets to match the supply and demand with rates and so on. But yeah, I mean, we're happy that this will be our headache.
00:30:14.126 - 00:31:45.822, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a few of the light bulb moments for me with fluid Dex and fluid as a lending borrowing protocol one is ive always had to think in my own defi portfolio, am I going to lend? Am I going to earn interest that way? Do I need to borrow because I need a leverage position or whatever, just need to borrow for farming other protocols or am I going to be an LP? And I think historically it's fair to say that my own portfolio has reflected more of a focus on lending and borrowing. But meanwhile, it kills me because I'm missing out on all these fees in stablecoin pairs. Anyways, this is going to allow me to actually accomplish both of those. And so, like, for example, if I have a position where the collateral is, let's say, eth, and then I borrow USDC with this new smart debt feature. I mean, basically I'm taking that debt, which is just sitting there doing nothing for me other than I'm paying interest on it. So it's costing me money over time. Now I can actually put it to work and I could opt into a smart debt set up here where, let's say, I'm willing to also have a debt that's going to need to be paid back in tether.
00:31:45.822 - 00:33:03.754, Speaker B: So now I've got the ability to contribute to a stablecoin LP pair, and that's just huge. The numbers are mind boggling. If you're a, you know, some of the examples you just gave there, like, just do the math and you suddenly realize again, it's, it's never been possible to use your debt as this passive liquidity. And so anyways, what I, what I want to wrap up here in my example, if, let's say I have ether as collateral, I borrow USDC, but I enable the smart debt feature and I'm willing to also be exposed to, let's say, USDT tether. Now when some trader comes along trading on the fluid decks, suddenly that person could be paying USDC and they want tether. And so what happens is under the hood, the USDC that they're actually trading, that is being used to pay back my USDC debt, and then it's borrowing tether from the liquidity layer of fluid. And now that trader walked away having paid a small transaction or trading fee per usual, like on any Dex, they've got their tether.
00:33:03.754 - 00:33:42.524, Speaker B: And meanwhile, now I have a mix of USDt and USDC debt, but I earned a fee on it, and then obviously multiply those fees by however many times folks are trading well, I'm going to earn a proportion of those fees. And I mean it is a huge innovation. It's just a huge shift in capital efficiency and I am dying to migrate one position in particular, because again it's just debt that I'm paying more interest on and or that I'm paying down like over time. But I'd rather have it earning me these passive fees.
00:33:42.662 - 00:34:48.840, Speaker A: Yeah, in some cases trading fees, they can offset the borrowing fees and you will be literally paid to borrow. I mean it's not even like we were checking this, it's our current market rates and position of I don't want to lie you. I think that was we were checking our app staking smart collateral accusity uses a smart dev and people were paid like 80% net API on the position just because of the lending and trading fees. Because they get this trading fees on smart collateral and on Smartdeb and they get lending fees and they only paying borrow fees. So they will get paid to borrow. But as I said, this will be also sort of a problem for us to stabilize the markets because if there is too much demand and rates go up, utilization go up. So we will have to balance that somehow.
00:34:48.840 - 00:35:29.040, Speaker A: We are always aiming to offer the best deal to the users on fluid, but if for someone it's a best deal, for someone else is the worst deal. So we'll see. I mean for sure, I can tell that by default on fluid you will have the best rates in define it's just because design works like that until someone else creates a new design new feature which can increase the earnings somehow. Until then, fluid will have just the best best conditions.

00:36:41.220 - 00:37:38.422, Speaker C: Campaign today, DMH, I'm seeing a shift in defi back to protocols that can generate like real fees and revenue. So with Instadap, it's a dao. It already has a token launched called Inst. I'm curious, like to me, when I hear everything that you're talking about, I see so many different points where revenue or fees can be extracted and possibly accrued back to the Instadap tokenization. Obviously there'll need to be a new dow vote of some sort to institute this new change. But what can you say or speak to as far as the efficiency and potential future revenues and fees that can be generated with this arrangement? Because to me it seems like it can be quite powerful and be actually quite meaningful in value accrual. Back to the instadap token, if that.
00:37:38.422 - 00:37:41.414, Speaker C: If that comes to pass, which I have a hunch it might.
00:37:41.582 - 00:38:58.860, Speaker A: So inst token is the only token we have at Insta, and it's governing all the products. Instap has four products, one of them istap pro lite, avocado wallet, and fluid fluid is already generating a lot of revenue. We use this revenue to, to grow our markets further, but we expect that after the fluid index is launched, fluid will be generating one of the highest, to the highest revenue in DeFi per $1 NGL. Even now, fluid Dex fluid lending and borrowing market generates like four times more than compound generators per $1 in TVL. And with fluid Dex, with fluid Dex, our revenue per wand alert TVL will skyrocket. Because again, in some cases, you don't need TVL, you don't need tokens to generate revenue because debt is used as trading liquidity. So no TVL, but the revenue is going.
00:38:58.860 - 00:40:19.320, Speaker A: And since we will have, since we'll have this very high revenue, and we think that fluid will become more mature, we want to take care of tokenomics. We want exploring different solutions, what we can do, how we can make ist holders benefit from fluid growth, from ethereum growth. Revenue share is one of the options we export. And there are different types of revenue share, some types, I mean, there are some different types of buybacks, there is different types of direct earnings share and so on. We are exploring different options. And if team comes up to certain idea, we will propose this on the forum and we will see what governance thinks about that. But definitely this, like tokenomics, will be one of our priorities in the future, hopefully in the near future.
00:40:19.480 - 00:40:59.022, Speaker B: Recently we've seen a market drawdown. I think of around 20% from bitcoin's year high of $73,000. And so there's been a major sell off in all tokens. I mean, some of the altcoins have sold off as much as like 50, 60, 70, 80%. I'm thinking ahead in the future once fluid Dex is live, and I'm using smart debt and smart collateral in that scenario where markets are crashing, I guess, what does that mean for us as fluid users? Maybe you can highlight some of the benefits or opportunities, or if there's any concerns.
00:40:59.166 - 00:41:55.688, Speaker A: So a few things you need to understand. First of all, as a fluid user, you will benefit from high ltvs and low liquidation penalties. And if you're using smart collateral and smart debt, if there is a lot of volume going through, you will earn this trading fees that can offset, I mean, they will not offset the drawdown on the market, but at least you will earn something on that. This is a good thing. The good part, the bad part would say if you are holding a smart collateral and smart debt, you're exposed to the, to the risks that you normally have as a Dex liquidity provider. Since you are liquidity provider, you have the same risks. And for example, if you hold a token, you hold a smart collateral of, let's say stake, Ethernet eth.
00:41:55.688 - 00:42:37.422, Speaker A: And for some reason people are dumping stake ETH and they are going out there selling it for ETH. So your smart collateral, it will become embarrassing. At one moment, it will convert to full stake EtH position and all eth will be, will be taken from, from, from ZLP. This is how tax LP works. Yeah. If people are selling one token, they withdrawing the other token from, from ZLP. And the smart depth is an inverse, inverse pool of smart collateral.
00:42:37.422 - 00:43:38.668, Speaker A: So if you have a smart collateral of stake ETH and ETH, and you have smart depth of ETH and stake etH, and people are running, I mean, people are selling stake if they want to exit their positions. You will end up with your collateral fully in stake EtH and your depth will be fully in ETH. There is no, I mean, you will, you will end up with having just a normal leverage position there, like stake EtH, looping position. This like a very typical position. If everything is okay with stake, if it's not hacked or something, you will just for short period of time, you will have this normal leverage position. But you are still, you must have earned like really a lot of trading fees if everyone decided to exit and after some time market will rebalance. Or you can repay, you can deleverage position.
00:43:38.668 - 00:44:32.350, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's as a smart collateral and smart deck holder, you are exposed to the risks which users have as a dex liquidity providers. And this is one of the reasons why creating positions on Dex liquidity pools on fluid is not permissionless. Because we cannot allow any unsafe assets on fluid. We want to have only several assets which are blue cheap and we don't see risk in them, like stake etH, VTC EtH and some other assets. But for smart lending, smart lending is just a XLP which earns Linux but is not used psychotherapy. We can accept a lot of tokens. I mean, we don't have any risk with that.
00:44:32.350 - 00:44:35.894, Speaker A: We only benefit. And liquidity providers also benefit.
00:44:35.982 - 00:45:43.578, Speaker C: Image I think by nature a lot of these lending borrowing platforms become pretty sticky. And I think that's in part due to users build up a certain level of trust. Like take an aave, for example. Even if what you're proposing with fluid is like a technical leap and maybe even better for the user, I think there's almost a certain amount of time and trust that needs to be built up. Like for example, Defi dad and I have had people reach out to us and be like, hey, this fluid thing almost looks too good to be true, you know, and like, there's, like, there's still education and I think some time that needs to be just pass in order to make people more comfortable with it. But I think the other thing too is like people are always worried about security and just what other risks could be maybe inherent under the hood that they're, they might not be aware of. Could you speak to any of that? Like maybe what sort of auditing was done or any other kind of like, risks that you foresee is like maybe something to make note of for potential users.
00:45:43.674 - 00:46:28.226, Speaker A: So that's very good point. This is true that this liquidity is sticky along the leading market have already the track record, and it's hard to get those liquidity providers from other protocols to fluid. But we will try our best to get them. We are going to have, we have some ideas how we'll be able to get them on the security part. So first thing I want to tell you is that Instadap has a track record of six years, and Instadapp had up to 15 billion in TBL and four different products. And Instab didn't have any security incidents. And fluid, yeah, fluid is a new protocol.
00:46:28.226 - 00:47:10.410, Speaker A: It's innovative and it's a new code. It's like not a fork of, you know, a few forks combined into something new? Yeah, it's fully new code. We already had two audits of fluid. And by the way, like, the beauty of fluid, because we use the same liquidity, the same base exists. This audience, they kind of checking the same things, and the new things which we build, we just add them on top without changing the base. So we already had two audits. We have a bug bounty.
00:47:10.410 - 00:47:56.320, Speaker A: We have one more, at least one more, maybe two more audits lined up. And by the time this podcast is live, maybe those will be finished already. So security is our top priority. And besides our track record and besides all those audio screens that we are doing, also fluid has this automated ceilings which do not allow users to withdraw from liquidity layer. As far as I remember, we have like 20% per 12 hours now. So in the worst case scenario, that's everything. Like, you know, someone is draining liquidity from.
00:47:56.320 - 00:48:57.494, Speaker A: From fluid, he will not be able to trade more than 20%. And in that moment, we have like, fluid is governed by NC token, but Multisig has a right to freeze the markets. Like emergency freeze, let's say. So in case something happens, there will be a loss and the team will be able to freeze the markets, which we hope will never happen. But this is one of the security features that we have. And, you know, we have this ceilings, depth ceilings and withdrawal ceilings on every liquidity layer and on every vault separately. So, I mean, like, everything has to be hacked for people to get 20% fluid.
00:48:57.494 - 00:49:12.566, Speaker A: It's like the worst case scenario. That's like completely everything got hacked. And people like the hacker will be still able to get 20%. Only the hacker will be still limited in what, in the amount of damage he killed.
00:49:12.638 - 00:50:43.958, Speaker B: I think it's a really smart feature. It was something that, when we first started covering fluid, before it actually launched, it's one of those things that kind of gets lost in the blog post, because there's features there that as a user, you get really excited for like high ltvs, low liquidation penalties, smart debt, smart collateral. But the fact that there is this sort of like, risk management automation feature built in that says if the worst possible thing were to happen here, if an enormous amount of liquidity were to suddenly exit and it was due to some sort of exploit, you have this fallback solution which basically locks down the protocol. Again, this makes sense because we've seen this happen with other protocols. Hope it never happens here. I think you pointed out the track record of Instadapp is impressive over the last five to six years, but we all knock on wood and hold our breaths as we say that, because we hate to see anything happen to a protocol like this that we have so much liquidity in. Quick follow up to that when fluid Dex does go live, and hopefully folks are listening to this probably into the future when it's already been live.
00:50:43.958 - 00:51:24.436, Speaker B: But one of the other reasons I love using fluid is I benefit from all of the instadap flash loan recipes. Like, they're the recipes like you can swap your collateral, you can swap your debt, you can change that. But one of those is a migration option. So I've used that in the past to migrate from, you could go from a maker to Aave Aave to now fluid. Will there be a migration for folks that want to move over from these legacy platforms like Aave and maker into a smart debt enabled vault on fluid?
00:51:24.548 - 00:52:11.270, Speaker A: Yeah. So this refinance feature, we'll have it live in fluid maybe this week or next week. So in the future it will be already live. This will allow users from other platforms to migrate their positions and do clicks to fluid for the smart depth and smart collateral. I am not yet sure how exactly it will be shown on the UI, because, I mean, like, if you have if c and USDT depth. Yeah, it's a. We allow to shift it into clicks, but if we want to shift your USDT depth into smart depth, I just don't know yet how it will look like.
00:52:11.350 - 00:53:27.852, Speaker B: No, this is great. This is our candid sort of feedback because we're still so new to this. It was actually a question that was top of mind for me as well. When this goes live, do you have any sense of, like, if I have, let's say, smart debt and I'm exposed to USDT and USDC debt, I mean, I'm imagining that, like, let's say I've borrowed against ether, I'll be able to see that, like, I owe $10,000 of USDC debt and $10,000 of tether. Because, like, right now it's crystal clear, just because there's only two parameters, there's a collateral and there's a debt, but technically, you could have a basket there. And honestly, I'm imagining that at some point, let's say someone wants to close out their debt position, let's say that they owe 10,000 of tether, 10,000 of USDC. I'm imagining that there will be some sort of feature wherever you can just basically sell the tethered debt into USDC debt and just pay it all back in one coin or the other.
00:53:27.852 - 00:53:52.698, Speaker B: So lots of obvious features. I think that will be added here. But the underlying innovation is the most important thing here. It's really complicated, obviously to build out this liquidity layer and to enable this, this sort of like new way of lending and borrowing and having this like greater capital efficiency.
00:53:52.834 - 00:54:38.608, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll have all this like, we call it strategies. Even now, if you see people who are using fluid frequently, they saw that there are small strategies like you can leverage in one click deleveraging one click. You can swap the vault. For example, you have eth USDT vault position and you want to swap it to if USDC. So everything is done in one click and same when smart dev will be there, users will be able to close their positions in one click as they do it. How everything will be very smooth. So UX on fluid is very smooth and we are working towards making embedded.
00:54:38.608 - 00:55:02.620, Speaker A: And by the way, if you haven't tried simulation mode on fluid, you are. I don't know what you are doing in the simulation mode is like the best thing you can try out. It's actually we forked Ethereum blockchain and we run the simulation mode on the fork and it works so good.
00:55:02.700 - 00:56:11.002, Speaker B: This is something I used before opening one of my positions on fluid. You just click the little checkbox or switch in the top right. Once you've got that going with this forked version of Ethereum, you can deposit any of the supported tokens, which makes it really convenient to start to play around and say, all right, let's say I'm going to create a position where I have smart collateral of Ether and Ee from Etherfi, and I'm going to borrow USDC or tether. You can do all sorts of things there. And you can use the flash loan recipes, which again are these instadapp recipes that if you've ever used instadapp, you'll recognize them right away. This is all a part of building this app that is really a hub for all possible defi use cases. And I think to this day, obviously the two most powerful use cases, I mean, one is always going to be trading above all else.
00:56:11.002 - 00:56:40.274, Speaker B: Just being able to trade whatever you want, whenever you want is extremely powerful. But the other one, of course is lending and borrowing, and that of course falls under a greater umbrella of leverage. So crypto folks love leverage. We love it, guys. This is a great place for us to wrap up, though. DMH, thanks so much for coming on. I want to remind our listeners that they should learn more about fluid by going to fluid instadap IO.
00:56:40.274 - 00:57:25.158, Speaker B: They can also just go to instadap IO to learn about like the legacy product there, but highly recommend you check out the fluid website. Follow zero x fluid on twitter. Follow instadap on Twitter as well for product updates and then also be sure to follow defi made here which is DMHS twitter account. And all of that's in our show notes so you can easily reference it. Dmh can you close us out though with just any eta for wind? Fluid decks will go live. We're recording this around the very end of June 2024. So this could be live in a matter of a week or weeks here and then.
00:57:25.158 - 00:57:36.084, Speaker B: Is there any other product that you can tease us with that might be built on top of fluid? Or maybe that you're the hoping will be built on top of fluids liquidity.
00:57:36.132 - 00:58:19.890, Speaker A: Layer regarding the fluid Dex, Floyd, we were expecting to launch it in July. Then we still have some developments in parallel. So for example, we're launching on Arbiter, we are exploring launching on some other blockchains. We are bringing new features to fluid. And all of them, they, they delay fluid Dex. Or if we spent one day on new feature, it's like the DeX will be delayed by one day. Now, the ETA for Fluid X, first week of August, which can be delayed by one week in case we have some extra development going on.
00:58:19.890 - 00:59:21.850, Speaker A: But Fluid X is our priority. We want to prioritize it over other features. But, you know, we cannot say, okay, we stop doing anything before we launch Fluid X, we still do other things and Fluid X would have to wait maybe one week or something. Regarding the protocols that can be built on top of fluids. So I already mentioned that we have the stake ETH redemption protocol and we can build this small redemption protocols for ether five or for symbiotic alert is a small feature, but it's very useful. But if we are talking about big protocols, one of the protocols which we have not been designing yet, but personally I keep in mind this stablecoin, again, no development, nothing. But this is something I would really love have to build.
00:59:21.850 - 01:00:21.794, Speaker A: And other big protocols can be everything. It can be prediction market, can be margin trading. I mean, you know, let's say futures, that can be any, any DeFi protocol that utilizes liquidity can be built on top of fluid. So after the DeX is launched, after we stabilize the markets, after we launch index on other blockchains, and everything goes moves, we will be launching more protocols. We will announce them later when we start to develop, when we create a design for them. And also, I really thank you for having me on this podcast. Not visiting any podcast often, I would say that this is my first was so it was a very nice experience.
01:00:21.794 - 01:00:23.890, Speaker A: I like it. Thank you. Thank you so much.
01:00:24.010 - 01:00:36.950, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge Podesthe.
