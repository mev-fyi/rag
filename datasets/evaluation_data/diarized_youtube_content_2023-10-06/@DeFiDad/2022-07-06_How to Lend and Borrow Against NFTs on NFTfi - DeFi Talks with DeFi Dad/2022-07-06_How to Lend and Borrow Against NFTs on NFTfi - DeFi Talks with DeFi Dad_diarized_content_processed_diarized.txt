00:00:01.930 - 00:01:05.726, Speaker A: Hey everyone, you're watching DeFi talks with Defi dad. Hey, thanks for joining me. It's Tuesday, July 5, 2022, the day after the holiday, the 4 July here in the United States. I'm joined here by Stephen Young, who is the founder of Niftyfied.com. So Stephen is a longtime builder in a very specific use case that I think is really one of the earliest examples of NFT financialization. Or you could think of it as a DeFi use case for NFTs. And so with Niftyfi, you can borrow against NFTs, or if you're a liquidity provider, you can earn yield by lending to those who are seeking to borrow against those NFTs.
00:01:05.726 - 00:01:24.166, Speaker A: And we'll walk through more of the stats here, but I believe they've issued around 200 million in NFT backed loans again. It's really become like a household brand name in the NFT DFI hybridized space. So, Steven, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:24.348 - 00:01:31.190, Speaker B: I'm great. Thanks for having me. Really enjoyed meeting you at NFT NYC. So great to have a follow up conversation.
00:01:31.530 - 00:01:53.710, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So we got to talk briefly there, and this is one of the reasons I think we go to events is every so often you put a face to a name. And so, yeah, nifty fi. I want to clarify. When you started building for this use case, it was pretty radical. There was like punks.
00:01:54.450 - 00:02:14.440, Speaker B: Yeah, it was punks. You could buy punk for like one and a half ether. You could have bought an autoglyph for two and a half ether board. Apes didn't exist. Hash marks didn't exist. Cryptokitties were still, people still thought like founder, cryptokitties were going to have value. So, yeah, it was a very different world.
00:02:15.690 - 00:02:31.114, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I started to summarize what's the mission behind Nifty five? But maybe tell us a little bit about your background and then what led to this and a bit about what you're building towards today with nifty fi.
00:02:31.242 - 00:03:10.742, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I've always been an artist and a programmer, so in high school I pretty much only worked on art and computer programming. And then when I finished high school, had to kind of choose between being a starving artist and paying the bills with programming and decided to pay the bills. But I've always been dabbling in art. And then my career was mostly in building software for big financial institutions. So banks, insurers, asset managers, all that kind of thing. So when NFDs came around and it was a combination of art and programming and finance.
00:03:10.742 - 00:03:45.810, Speaker B: It really was kind of like the perfect thing for me. I got into crypto around in 2016. I was dabbling for a while, left full time to go full time into crypto in 2018. Co founded an exchange. Left that because building an exchange is very much like building a traditional financial services application. It's all regulation and all that kind of stuff. So I really wanted to do something fully decentralized and then had some time on my hands and then kind of had this idea to start niftify.
00:03:45.810 - 00:04:17.690, Speaker B: The idea kind of came about. I was a chat between me and one of my co founders, Mads. He was one of the early cryptokitties breeders. I think he had like two and a half thousand cryptokitties at the time. And we were talking about, I was going to take out a makerdao loan to kind of fund my lifestyle while I was trying to find out the next big thing to do. And we were talking about Ethereum prices. And he said, what I would really like to do is leverage my cats to long ether.
00:04:17.690 - 00:04:36.120, Speaker B: And I thought that sounded awesome. And so we basically brainstormed the idea and six months later launched the first version of liftify. That conversation was in 2019, so December 2019. And we took our first public loans in June 2020.
00:04:36.730 - 00:05:02.282, Speaker A: Wow, okay. And then you've been through a few investment rounds, so you have raised some money privately to date. Maybe you can talk about just where are we in terms of. This is a protocol that is permissionless. It allows you to interact peer to peer. But maybe you can help to clarify, too, where we're headed. Will this eventually be governed by a token, potentially.
00:05:02.282 - 00:05:04.030, Speaker A: Anything there you can share?
00:05:04.180 - 00:05:45.850, Speaker B: Yeah, at the moment. So we raised a couple of rounds just to fund the team. For a long time, it was really just me trying to kind of keep up with growth. I think we did $300,000 in 2020 and then 40 million in 2021, and we've done 180,000,000 so far this year. So it's been a bit of a crazy ride. So needed to grow. The team didn't want to launch a token too early because I've seen, especially in the exchange space, people paying people to use their product, and then I always say free money has always got product market fit.
00:05:45.850 - 00:06:20.982, Speaker B: So I didn't want to obscure, I don't want to pay people to use our protocol. I wanted to kind of see that people actually find this useful. So that's kind of where we are now. We've got about 15 people full time, but long term, the plan is to go fully decentralized. I think it's about progressive decentralization. I think in the beginning it matters to have a team who's kind of very tight knit and kind of executing really fast. But over the long run, I think these kinds of public utilities, they should be owned by the people using them.
00:06:20.982 - 00:06:23.266, Speaker B: So that is definitely the long term goal.
00:06:23.458 - 00:07:30.540, Speaker A: Yeah. I think of nifty phi in a somewhat similar vertical as like an ave or compound, because this is a use case that sits lower in the stack in terms of utility. If you hold NFTs for whatever reason, whether you are collecting art, collecting music, collecting them for some other sort of utility use case, if those accrue value the ability to borrow against that, that just unlocks so much new opportunity. And I want to say your origin story with having borrowed with maker kind of is an inspiration, I'm sure, to what you eventually build. Why can't we access more liquidity from things that we're already holding and that we're long on and that might potentially accrue value? Have you had any lessons, I guess, to learn from watching the likes of compound and Ave through the last few years? Maker as well, I guess, yeah.
00:07:33.170 - 00:08:42.450, Speaker B: I think that the thing that I took from ismonian inspiration around how powerful these things can be to allow people to kind of take control of their own financial future and freedom. One thing that I'm quite careful about though, is trying to not just lift the lessons learned from DFI and just try to shove it into the NFT space. I do think that there are certain things that are just different cryptocurrencies and ERC 20s are like money and NFTs aren't. They're much more illiquid. People care more about the individual NFT. You don't care which ether you own, but you care like which punk you own for, right? So I think there is just psychologically and in the nature of the mindset of a collector, something that is unique, that I don't want to just try and make the same as every other Defi protocol. I want to kind of make sure that we honor what is unique about NFTs and why this was brought in such a cultural movement as opposed to just like a purely money movement.
00:08:42.950 - 00:09:35.426, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe before we actually show off nifty fi and kind of talk through how you could either lend or borrow against NFTs, can we drill down further into some of those differences between the DeFi and NFT community? You're like one of the few builders, I think, who really sits in between both spaces. Anything else that you would highlight that might bring the communities closer together in the future? I have thought of web three gaming, for example, as a growing use case that sort of unites the best of both worlds. If you play a web three game, you're making use of NFTs, but then I would imagine you're going to benefit from the plumbing that is defi that sort of underpins all that goes on within the game. But anyways.
00:09:35.458 - 00:09:35.654, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:35.692 - 00:09:38.710, Speaker A: Curious. Any other sort of lessons you've.
00:09:39.130 - 00:10:42.634, Speaker B: Yeah, the mental model that I have for how this space works, I think is still developing it because the space changes so fast. But I kind of think of defi as money. So a lot of what you do in DeFi is you're trying to get yield, you're trying to stack more ether, you're trying to grow your capital base, and then when you want to do something with that, up until recently, you really had to take it out of the crypto ecosystem. Right. So even if you could pay directly with your crypto, you're normally paying for something in the real world. You're buying a flight to go somewhere, or you're buying your car with crypto, but you're taking things out of the crypto world and you're making it real and tangible to buy things you actually want to have and own and use in your life. And I think what's changed over the last year and a half to two years is all of a sudden there's something to own in the crypto space purely for the joy of owning it or purely for the utility of owning it.
00:10:42.634 - 00:11:42.860, Speaker B: So for the first time, you've got programmable money and you've also got programmable ownership of things that aren't we. I think Niftify kind of sits in between those two worlds and almost think of it as programmable commerce. Right. So what does the world look like when you've got digitally native things people want to own and digital native money? And what are the tools we can build to allow people to leverage that and kind of have this really a peer to peer ecosystem where people, I'm sure you've met so many interesting people from doing NFT collecting, and if you buy stuff from a specific artist, you're going to get to know them. Or if you all own the same PFP, you kind of go into the same discord, you get to know people. And I think that's something that's a little bit unique about NFTs compared to Defi. Sometimes Defi can be a little bit impersonal you're kind of just interacting with a pool, and you kind of get a yield or you don't get a.
00:11:42.860 - 00:12:02.658, Speaker B: So I think that is, for me, the essence. The one is about kind of capital and money. The other one is about things that people actually want to own. And there's much more of a cultural and social component to NFTs and collecting NFTs than there is to kind of just being active in the Defi world. Yeah.
00:12:02.744 - 00:12:36.800, Speaker A: It feels like you're really building for those that they already find themselves at home in a digitally native world. And that, to me, is what's been very compelling about everything that has been built with NFTs, or let's call it the metaverse, whatever is this early metaverse built over the last few years. And so those who already are at home, I think they're more likely to continue to hold those assets and to find value in them, even if no one else does.
00:12:37.250 - 00:12:57.240, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think especially where we are. So if you think about our users, they already have metamask, they already bought NFTs. They already spent half the time in discord. They already own some crypto. So they really are kind of the closest to crypto or web three natives that you've got. Right.
00:12:57.240 - 00:13:35.300, Speaker B: We are kind of the second step in the journey for people. So it's obvious there's less people in that space, but they're very savvy in general when it comes to these kinds of things. So we never really have to answer questions about how to execute transactions or how to keep a wallet safe. It's much more around how we work and what's the best way to leverage our thing in whatever strategy people have in their collecting lives. And that was part of the reason I was so attracted to this, because it really feels like we're kind of at the cutting edge of the cutting edge in this space.
00:13:35.990 - 00:14:01.580, Speaker A: Yeah. You're not focused on lending against some real world asset, which I find is, it's a bull market conversation. As we get near the end of a bull market, especially, we have the outside critics, some of which have podcasts. Now, I can't imagine, like, full time just being a critic of crypto, but I guess that is now a full time job for some.
00:14:02.270 - 00:14:11.050, Speaker B: I take that as a sign of success for us when people can make a living criticizing us full time. We've crossed a line there, I think.
00:14:11.200 - 00:15:07.386, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the things that I've found, whether they're friends, family, colleagues, I was talking to someone a week ago who invests at a family office. And he was simply asking, when are you as a crypto community going to enable these real world assets to come on chain? And my response was, I don't know and I really don't care. I'm focused on those that are here and now, the ones that are already loyal to these use cases. I can tell you what once was an alternative financial system for me is the default, the home base. Now the bank is just an off ramp for me to pay certain bills. But I see my home and the opportunity here in this world and that world, especially with Nifty Fi.
00:15:07.386 - 00:16:08.420, Speaker A: So we can show this off here in a moment. With Nifty Fi, you're catering to those who are collecting punks and board apes and every other sort of NFT. We're not here to comment on whether they should be priced at whatever price. It's just the fact that there's an agreement amongst all these users that it is worth what it is. And so hence you have liquidity providers in this case who are willing to lend not only because they want to earn some borrowing interest, but given the fact, I think you mentioned a few weeks ago, that maybe 13% of borrowers have defaulted so far and so they see an opportunity to potentially buy or scoop up some of these NFTs at steep discounts. But anyways, Steve, anything else to add there just in terms of building for these digitally native users? Otherwise, I'd love to start to actually show off.
00:16:10.070 - 00:17:10.738, Speaker B: I mean, I completely agree with you and it is why I'm so excited about being here, especially at nftny NYC. It was really refreshing to meet these people. And often we would go and have a meeting with a lender and they'd bring a borrower with and say, hey, we actually want to do this kind of transaction. Can you help us? Do you know, for me that's what's exciting, is kind of knowing that these people are trying to do stuff and kind of trying to basically do business with each other in a way where they don't have to rely on banks in an intermediary to make sure that when they agree on terms, that is actually what's going to happen. And it takes a lot of the friction and conflict in these transactions away because you agree up front and then there's no dispute, right. The smart contract executes what you guys agreed on. So I think it's a healthy development.
00:17:10.738 - 00:17:42.430, Speaker B: And I like the fact that there is this peer to peer connection between people. And like you said, we're not involved at all in the pricing of these assets. It really is the borrower and the lender deciding between them what is a good deal. And nobody's obligated to accept any of those terms. But when they come to an agreement, we just make sure that that agreement gets executed in the way that they agreed on and we don't decide what the price should be, and we don't default on the asset if the prices potentially drop.
00:17:45.670 - 00:17:54.610, Speaker A: Sounds right on point. Steven, do you want to start to share your screen? I'll share it once you're on the correct tab here and then.
00:17:54.680 - 00:17:55.250, Speaker B: Sure.
00:17:55.400 - 00:18:03.414, Speaker A: Maybe we could talk through. Okay, there we go. Would you prefer to talk about it from a lending or borrowing perspective first?
00:18:03.612 - 00:18:52.098, Speaker B: Let's talk about it from a borrowing perspective, because that kind of is where it starts, right? So if I'm a borrower, if I go here, I can go into my assets. This account doesn't actually have any assets linked to it, so that's why you're not seeing anything show up here. But if I had an asset over here, I could click on it and I can list it to list it as collateral on the platform. And all that requires is a specific for me to sign, a signature to say to prove that I actually own this asset. And then once I've done that, it appears on this list. And you can see here we can go and look through different types of. Let's look at some other deeds from the board ape universe.
00:18:52.098 - 00:19:21.630, Speaker B: So there are 73 other deeds listed, 30 doodles at the moment. Maybe we should look at some board apes actually, because they always get some good activity. So I'm going to take this off. So go look at one of these board apes. This person has listed it by saying the Basang transaction. And they can specify the terms that they would like to get on this asset.
00:19:22.370 - 00:19:46.982, Speaker A: Stephen, can you zoom in on your screen just on that pink box a little, just so we can read you if I go and I list a board ape or whatever. NFT here. These are some of the terms I can put up. I'm basically like proposing to all the lenders. Like here are terms that I'm open to, which the more flexible puts you at an advantage to attract the. Right.
00:19:47.036 - 00:20:13.162, Speaker B: Yes. It basically tells borrowers what you're looking for. So you could say, I want an ether or a die loan. Specify the amount that you would like, the duration that you'd like, and the max APR that you're willing to pay. But all this really is, is you saying, this is what I would like. The person that decides what they will offer you really is the lender. And you can see here, these are some offers that this person has received.
00:20:13.162 - 00:20:48.010, Speaker B: So offers expire over seven days, so they don't stick around too long. This is an offer for a 60 day loan at 32 ether, looking for repayments of 37 ether, which is a 30% APR. And you'll see over here, this is a 14 day loan from a different lender with a 60 ether loan value and a 61 ether repayment value, which is a higher APR because it's a higher LTV loan. So the risk is higher for this lender.
00:20:49.230 - 00:21:30.474, Speaker A: So cool. Yeah, I love the wild west nature of Nifty Phi. Once you realize there's, first off, a lot of collectors in this space, and this is an urgent need for many. In some cases, if you own something like a board ape, some of these people want to borrow against that because obviously they can do something more with that liquidity. But I think one of the motes that NiftyFi has right now is you have a very active base of lenders. Right. That's the thing here.
00:21:30.474 - 00:22:04.130, Speaker A: What actually turned me off initially a few years ago with Nifty Fi was I just kept wondering, how are you going to match enough lenders? That was something that I think it was Dharma. Dharma was like, early to Dharma now no longer exists. I think they were trying to remember who they were bought by. Opensea, maybe. But Dharma was a crypto wallet. Eventually that started as a peer to peer lending and borrowing. And this was basically so you could borrow against ETH, but you had to match peer to peer.
00:22:04.130 - 00:22:22.266, Speaker A: And I have to say, this is maybe my question for you is, I guess what has enabled you all to be successful? Because, again, I, years ago was like, how are they going to be able to match loans quickly enough with nifty Phi? But now you have to give you.
00:22:22.288 - 00:23:31.326, Speaker B: A sense of what that is. If you list a board ape, you should get between five and ten offers within a couple of minutes. There's lots of people who run bots, who are looking for new listings all the time, and especially the high value proven projects get a lot of offers very quickly. And typically you would actually see better offers if you specify loan terms, because otherwise it's just kind of lenders in a way, they think that you're not as serious if you don't say what your desired terms. What. Why do we become successful? I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that Mads was a very early collector in the space, so he was friends with Jimmy and Pranksy and Colini eight and poopies and all those guys who are really early in the space. So we were able to speak to them directly and make sure that the way that we designed this system actually works.
00:23:31.326 - 00:24:11.246, Speaker B: So some of the things we did there is we realized quite early on that the assets are going to be the rare thing and that the capital actually is pretty common. There's a lot of people with ether looking to get a yield. So the people who pay for the loans are the lenders because they're making a profit. And then we take a cut of their profits. It's free for us, so we don't charge any fees to borrowers. And then the other big thing was you always have the full loan duration to repay for your loan. So you can never kind of get auto liquidated just because the price has dropped for a short while in the market.
00:24:11.246 - 00:25:01.642, Speaker B: It's always the borrower's choice if they want to repay or not. I can tell you a little bit about how we started getting traction. So we were in the very early topshots beta program, and there were lots of people in there that had basically maxed out all of their liquidity buying topshots and then wanted to basically buy more. So they were starting to leverage their founder, cryptokitties or rare, one of one art that they had collected at the time, some autoglyphs. And they were kind of then using that to buy into the top shots, like early beta program. So it kind of grew organically the whole time. And then, like I said, the lending space is just very competitive.
00:25:01.642 - 00:25:18.210, Speaker B: Lenders are spending all day, every day making offers on these assets and building infrastructure that kind of monitors new listings and automatically makes offers as fast as they possibly can because they're looking to get those loans.
00:25:19.350 - 00:26:07.282, Speaker A: Are you seeing a majority of the offers that borrowers are making, the ones that are ultimately issued a loan, are they going in with terms as flexible as this, or are you seeing success as well with those who are much more specific saying, hey, I need to borrow? In this case? By the way, some of the other details here I don't want to skip over is like, the pricing information is so helpful. If I owned this ape, I'm like, all right, upshot values it at 99. What if I go in and say, I need to borrow at least 50 wrapped ETH? So are those sorts of borrowers, are they matching as quickly or do you think the key is being as flexible with these terms as.
00:26:07.336 - 00:26:51.120, Speaker B: I actually think it's better to be specific about what you want because it signals to lenders that you're serious about taking a loan. I think you probably get better offers and more of them if you specify what you want. As long as what you're asking for isn't unrealistic. Right. No borrower is really going to give you 99 ether on this asset because they're taking a risk of the price dropping at any point in the future. Right. I think if you go in around about 50 ish percent loan to value ratio, you should have a pretty good time getting these things.
00:26:51.120 - 00:26:58.478, Speaker B: This borrower has already borrowed 626 ether, right. So on average 48 ether per loan.
00:26:58.654 - 00:27:16.006, Speaker A: Oh, that's cool. Okay, I missed that. So that relates to they've borrowed that much ETH against potentially other NFTs that they own. So this helps to build then that credibility for who it is you're actually lending to.
00:27:16.188 - 00:27:22.854, Speaker B: We also then show a default rate here. So you can see this person, he's paid 100% of their loan back of their loan.
00:27:22.902 - 00:27:42.950, Speaker A: Very cool. Among the borrowers, do you see any more common uses of those borrowed funds? Are they using it to stake ETH and earn yield? I'm curious if you've heard more stories or feedback from users.
00:27:43.130 - 00:28:18.938, Speaker B: Yeah. So it changes based on market conditions. Maybe. Let's roll back a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, when the NFT prices started going crazy. For a while, people would list crypto punks or they listed them for what they expect, what they thought was a crazy price, which at that time was twelve ether or something like that. They said there's no way this was only going to be worth this much. And then the floor all of a sudden went to 30 ether over the course of four or five days.
00:28:18.938 - 00:29:29.886, Speaker B: So on OpeNC, there were active listings that were very mispriced or people came back after being away for a long time and then listed something for, again, what they thought was a crazy price, but actually was way undervalued for that specific asset. So during that time there were a lot of borrowers who just wanted to stay liquid, so that when that happened, they had the capital to quickly snap up those assets and flip them. That opportunity kind of went away a little bit as people kind of caught on to the fact that NFTs were the new thing all of a sudden. But then these kind of drops started happening, right? So if you own this asset, you get onto the allow list, which means you can buy in the mint. So then people would lever up on their NFTs. So for example, we saw a huge spike in activity the day before the other deed drop because people were borrowing against the existing NFTs they had. So they had more capital to buy other deeds, and then they try flip them in the secondary sales to make enough profit to repay the loan and hopefully keep a few of those NFTs.
00:29:29.886 - 00:30:17.794, Speaker B: So essentially, you kind of end up with free NFTs at the end of that process. So that was really big for a while. It's not as easy nowadays to guarantee that you're going to double or triple your money on the secondary market after a mint. So now with the markets kind of crashing a little bit, we're actually seeing people using us as a hedge almost, right? So worried that the prices are going to drop even more. If you take out a 50 or 70% loan to value ratio loan on our platform and the prices drop below the value of your loan, you've essentially capped your downside. So you're hedging your exposure to the downside risk there and then. We've also seen people during COVID One of our users lost their job.
00:30:17.794 - 00:31:28.682, Speaker B: They took out a loan to basically pay the bills and kind of keep the lights on until they found a new job with the Ukraine thing. One of our users basically wanted to donate a four X four to the ukrainian fighters, and he was only getting money from some other sources at the end of the month, but wanted to buy the four X four straight away and get it to them as soon as possible. So they took out a loan on their doodle to pay for the four X four to basically get it there quicker and then paid back the loan when they got the money coming in later on. So everything from trading strategies to, yes, yield farming. When there was lots of yield in defi, you could often get more yield than you paid in interest on the loan if you're kind of playing a yield farming game. We had people playing wolf game and figured out a profitable wolf game strategy in there, and they were basically trying to put more money to work buying wool pouches and so on. So it changes on the market and where the opportunities are.
00:31:28.682 - 00:31:37.530, Speaker B: But in essence, the core of the need really, is to be able to get some liquidity without having to sell these assets.
00:31:38.510 - 00:31:56.078, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the one strategy there you pointed out that was something I had considered with a few NFTs, was just hedging against the downside, taking out that loan. Of course, you still have to be able to time it, time it somewhere.
00:31:56.254 - 00:32:17.960, Speaker B: You're paying a price the whole time that the loan is on, you're paying that interest. Right, right. But a lot of people do that. And especially if you've got crypto punks, you could quite easily get a 10% to 15% APR loan, which is not bad.
00:32:19.630 - 00:32:42.670, Speaker A: Can you remind me how is that interest accrued? Like, let's say I've got this board ape, I borrow 50 ETH and it's one of the offers there below. I'm paying like 36% Apr. Is it continually accruing? Like, am I having to maintain that loan to value ratio or it's just due at the very end?
00:32:42.740 - 00:33:12.790, Speaker B: Due at the very end. And so it's fixed duration, fixed interest. So we don't keep track of the value. We don't have oracles. There's no way to kind of do an oracle attack. It's always up to you as a borrower to decide before the loan is due if it makes financial sense for you to repay this loan. And we actually often see people repay assets where the loan is for more than the asset is worth at the current moment of when the loan becomes due.
00:33:12.790 - 00:33:34.260, Speaker B: And it's because these people, it's a rare ape that they don't want to get rid of, or it's their profile picture and they've kind of got an emotional connection to them. It's not a purely financial decision for a lot of people and we don't want to kind of come in there and make that decision for them.
00:33:35.990 - 00:33:48.230, Speaker A: Nifty Phi, you've stuck to one of one NFTs. We're not dealing with ERC 1155s yet, for example.
00:33:48.380 - 00:34:38.230, Speaker B: It's not because I don't think that ERC 1155s aren't useful. It's just that because of the cost of gas and because of it's just expensive to move nfts in and out of escrow. So there's kind of a bottom end to the size of the loan that it makes sense to do one given gas costs. Now all of a sudden that's dropped quite a lot. But if you remember, not so long ago we were paying 200 300 gray per transaction. It was just not financially viable, really to do loans on something less than one ether, really, in terms of value. And that was largely why there were just not a lot of 1155s that were kind of in that value range.
00:34:38.230 - 00:35:09.040, Speaker B: As we kind of scale the blockchains. And at some point we will move to Altus too. As soon as we see a lot of traction in one of those Altus, then that barrier kind of drops quite a lot and then it makes sense we're also going to be releasing bundles soon, which allows you to bundle up a bunch of different NFTs and get a loan on a bundle of NFTs and that you can put in both eleven fifty five s and seven twenty ones.
00:35:09.570 - 00:35:36.950, Speaker A: So that's it. That's a major release then, that we can look forward to, because that's something that I'm dying to be able to nest a few different NFTs. And I know it's a popular need. A lot of folks would like to do what they've done with something like Ave, borrow against multiple types of tokens on Ave, but in this case multiple types of NFTs.
00:35:38.650 - 00:35:59.930, Speaker B: Some of our biggest loans, our record loan was $8.3 million, I think, and that was on 105 crypto punks. So that was a single loan agreement between the borrower and the lender, but they had to execute it on 105 individual punks. So we want to make that process much simpler.
00:36:00.090 - 00:36:05.540, Speaker A: Holy cow. That's nuts. When was that done? How long ago?
00:36:06.230 - 00:36:29.580, Speaker B: It was about two and a half months ago. Something like that. Remember there was that Sotheby's auction that was going to do auction 105 crypto punks and then that was pulled at the last minute. They then came to us and then, well, they went to one of our liquidity providers and they struck up a deal to do that big loan on that.
00:36:30.670 - 00:36:45.590, Speaker A: That is such a great story to tell. I have never understood why everyone is simping to these to Sotheby's. I don't have any sort of ill will.
00:36:45.680 - 00:37:36.526, Speaker B: I've got a theory on why it was such a popular thing for a while. So often it would be a collector who owns a lot of whatever asset they're auctioning off, and they would only auction one. And actually you would normally get less at Sotheby's than if you just listed that on Opensea. But having something get that stamp of approval of being approved by Sotheby's or Christie's all of a sudden brought a lot of attention to the project, which pushed up the floor, which means they could sell the rest of the NFTs for a higher price. So I almost think of those Sotheby's auctions as a marketing cost that they're willing to pay to kind of bring attention and legitimacy to a project that they own a lot of assets of.
00:37:36.708 - 00:38:31.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think that even going back to constitution, Dow and a few of the other just like big news stories that related back to NFTs or some sort of other web three use case that did a lot of good. That brought in a lot of new interest. I remember friends and family asking about the constitution Dow thing. It didn't work out the way we all wanted it to, but it was a great story. It was a very feel good type of story to show, like see what happens when you can coordinate people on chain just using money and tokens. Anything else in the roadmap that you think is worth noting or actually anything else here on the platform that you wanted to show off? Because I think we covered most of the steps that you would follow if you were going to lend or borrow.
00:38:31.706 - 00:38:43.682, Speaker B: Maybe what we can do is just give you a little bit of a sense of the actual volumes that we've actually done. Let me find.
00:38:43.736 - 00:39:04.250, Speaker A: Yeah, this might help to discern also earlier you mentioned what is like a blue chip NFT. And I think that you're one of the few places that helps to sort of prove out through interest rates and loans issued. What is blue chip? What's most popular amongst.
00:39:04.590 - 00:39:24.914, Speaker B: Yes, let's do that quickly. This gives you kind of like an idea of the run up that we had. So obviously you can see the value last month in US dollar terms was down quite a lot. But actually if you look at it in terms of ether, it's not down all that much. Right. And this is this month. Right.
00:39:24.914 - 00:39:45.960, Speaker B: So we're on the 5 July. We've already done 4600 ether. Wow. Two days ago we had a $3.4 million day, 3200 ether. This was actually again on like there was 146 crypto punks for $3.4 million loan like two days ago.
00:39:45.960 - 00:40:53.610, Speaker B: And then here you can kind of look at, these are some of the top projects that we have, right? So if you look at it all time, it's board ape Yacht club, followed by rap cryptopunks and mutant ape yacht clubs and art blocks. Curated has done really well. If you count up all of the Yuga properties, that's $100 million in loans have been done on Yuga and then $120,000,000 on everything else. They're very dominant in the space, obviously, because they bought cryptopunks. That brings a lot of the value in here. But you can see in the past month we've done $5 million on board apes, $4 million on crypto punks. Artblocks is mainly concentrated on Fidenzas, ringers, and a few other of the kind of really high end projects there that really take up most of the volume.
00:40:53.610 - 00:41:19.366, Speaker B: And then doodles has been a really strong performer over the last little while. I really think that they're onto something there. World of women has been really big for us. Vfriends also did pretty well. Autoglyphs. So autoglyphs is very few loans on them, but it's quite a high value, each one of them. So our biggest individual loan was on a type ten autoglyph for just over a million dollars.
00:41:19.366 - 00:41:20.280, Speaker B: Wow.
00:41:22.490 - 00:41:30.306, Speaker A: What's the longest term loan, Steven, that you've seen? I always see like the 30, 60, 90 day marks.
00:41:30.338 - 00:42:12.600, Speaker B: But can you go much? That's the most common we've seen, 180 day loan. But up until not so long ago, we didn't allow longer loans just because it was so early in the market, and we really didn't want people to kind of get in a situation, especially on the lending side, that was kind of irresponsible to get into. So in the last release, we lifted that a little bit because we felt there were enough lenders who had built up enough experience to make good decisions that we felt more comfortable doing that. But even after doing that, we didn't see a huge uptick. I can show you here. The average loan duration is 33 days.
00:42:13.130 - 00:42:28.326, Speaker A: Do you think that your success can be attributed to focusing more on those lenders, or do you feel like you're putting an equal amount of time into serving both borrowers and lenders?
00:42:28.518 - 00:43:01.734, Speaker B: I actually think a lot of the success is due to the fact that we really understand borrowers and what makes them feel safe about using their assets. So we double audit our latest contracts. We don't do auto liquidations. So we really, I think, understand a little bit the psychology of collectors, because we're collectors ourselves. Right. I own a bunch of stuff. He's got a bunch of magic, the gathering cards under his bed.
00:43:01.734 - 00:43:36.020, Speaker B: Right. So he was a collector before you could collect. So. And I really think that the limiting factor into the size of the NFT lending market nowadays really is the number of collectors who know that they can use their assets in this way and feel comfortable doing so. We are really kind of focused around making sure assets don't get lost. You can't get liquidated when you don't want to. Really making sure that people don't lose the assets that they care so much about.
00:43:36.550 - 00:44:31.620, Speaker A: Yeah, there is a strength there that is familiar to me. I still view as an investor, I view everything through the lens of a user. I let that guide me. I know I have my shortcomings. Someone else could sit there and punch through a bunch of on chain analysis and talk circles around me, but I know how to use these applications. Understanding that, I think it really gives you an edge this early in the space. And as a builder, not that I was never a developer, but at Zapper, that was one of the most fun things about working on Zapper is you're always thinking about it as a user and like, what else would we want to use? And not just having to listen to all that user feedback, even though I think they do a tremendous job of that as well.
00:44:33.350 - 00:45:21.460, Speaker B: For me, really, that is how we figure out our product roadmap. It's the things that people ask us to build, and I don't come up with a clever, smart contract and algorithm that we then look to go find users to use. We have users that have a need that we try to solve. Right. So my designs usually start from like, it always starts with interviews and speaking to people and really understanding what they care about. And then we design the user interface and then we figure out what the smart contracts need to look like to give you that experience. We really do come from a product led user led design.
00:45:22.630 - 00:45:45.930, Speaker A: One other thing you pointed out was you don't liquidate, there's no liquidation mechanism. So I'm looking at the chart here. It's showing Richard Chen created all these really nice dashboards. And let's pretend that I'm one of the 12.9%. I don't end up paying back my loan plus interest, and I go into default. What happens next for the lender?
00:45:46.750 - 00:46:16.280, Speaker B: So basically on the lender side, they would then get a notification saying that the loan has expired and they can then go in. And if they go to. I'm going to show you this again. So let's go in here. So if you were the lender and this was a defaulted loan, this make offer button would say foreclose. And then when you click foreclose, it would just transfer the asset out of our escrow contract into your wallet and you get to keep it.
00:46:17.050 - 00:46:28.262, Speaker A: Interesting. Do you know which loans, or I guess which NFTs have defaulted the most? I'm not sure if you would have ever dug into that.
00:46:28.316 - 00:47:05.800, Speaker B: Yeah. In general, what you can see here is that here's a loan default ratio by volume, and this is a loan default ratio by count. And you can see by count it's much higher than by volume. And what that implies is that the higher value the asset is, the less likely people are to default. So let's go have a look here quickly. So let's look at board apes and we'll go do apply. These are the stats for board apes, right? So the average loan size for board apes this month is $98,000.
00:47:05.800 - 00:47:25.020, Speaker B: Their average APR is 36%. And this is the average true loan cost. So these aren't year long loans. Right. So this is the average actual cost that somebody paid. So 4.2% of the 98,000.
00:47:25.020 - 00:47:49.140, Speaker B: And you can see the loan default ratio by volume is 1.5% for board apes. So it's much lower than for something else. So let's go down to something that's maybe a little bit less. So maybe let's take Azuki. That's probably kind of in the middle. They had some bad news at some point.
00:47:49.140 - 00:47:53.140, Speaker B: You can see here, default ratio for Azuki is 24%.
00:47:54.710 - 00:48:20.038, Speaker A: So interesting. Yeah. To see the differences in behavior between those that are borrowing one NFT versus another. Are you seeing any change in the split between how many loans are issued in wrapped ether versus dai? I know you've done a lot more loans issued in wrapped ether, but is that growing? Are you seeing more in DAi changes.
00:48:20.224 - 00:49:02.870, Speaker B: Mostly based on market conditions? So, for example, when ether was going on a tear, right? So when we started ether, I think it was about $300 per ether. And then during the time that we were active, that went up from $300 to the peak of close to around the $4,000 mark. And for a while there was really rocketing up. And during that time, lots of people were taking out loans in Dai because they were basically taking that Dai, buying ether, letting the price go up, and then selling it at the end of the loan period to repay. So they were doing leverage long ether trades using their NFTs as collateral.
00:49:02.950 - 00:49:03.580, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:49:04.350 - 00:49:37.160, Speaker B: We actually saw the reverse. On the day of the big crash, we had a couple of users basically taking out loans, mostly on, and in that case, it was mostly on high value art blocks. And they would take out a loan, repay it, take out another loan, repay it, take out a loan and repay it again multiple times in a single day. And what they were doing there is they were shorting ether, so they would take out a loan, short ether, wait for the short to be fold, repay the loan, take out another loan, short ether, and keep recycling it like that.
00:49:38.010 - 00:50:21.278, Speaker A: So interesting. I mean, a lot of the behaviors, too are similar to what you see across the rest of the DFI landscape. But I think it's a clever mechanism because this is a community that still values the underlying NFT and what they're willing to do to earn more ETH, or at least protect the value of those NFTs. It's fascinating to dig into all of this. We probably should wrap up here in just a few minutes. But Steven, anything else you think is worth reviewing here, anything else we didn't.
00:50:21.294 - 00:51:30.146, Speaker B: Get to cover, I think we kind of did a pretty decent mean. Maybe the only other thing really is for like one of the things that we just really want to make sure that we do a good job of and that we're spending a lot of time thinking about how we can do a better job on is making sure that people don't get into trouble doing this stuff. I think as a technology, being able to take leverage is neutral, but you can do things that get you into trouble. Right. So you really need to be careful and make sure that you understand the know if this is really an NFT that you never want to lose, make sure that you have a backup plan to be able to repay it. So that's just the main thing for me. I don't ever want us to have success by making people lose money and kind of people losing their life savings because we provided a tool.
00:51:30.146 - 00:52:00.100, Speaker B: So we really want to make sure our users understand the risks. Leverage is a great thing. It allows you to do lots of stuff, but if you use it irresponsibly, it really can also amplify your losses. So be careful when you do these things. Be responsible. At the very least, with these kinds of loans, the only thing you can lose is the NFT that you put up. So we can't go after your house or anything like that.
00:52:00.100 - 00:52:24.650, Speaker B: But still, if you bought that NFt by taking out a mortgage and you had to repay the mortgage by selling that NFT, and then you lose it because something silly, your trade didn't go your way. We don't want to kind of have those kinds of stories come out because we didn't warn people that there are risks involved in taking out leverage and have to be responsible.
00:52:25.310 - 00:53:43.940, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one easy takeaway from this, like one call to action is if you go to niftyfi.com, you can basically monitor where there are offers being made. And that's something that, it's something that is just interesting to look through and start to see. Like, okay, a lot of the, I think the insights you shared here, you start to notice those patterns of, you know, based on the upshot valuation and the floor and where, well, with board apes, it's funny because the previous prices are kind of funny because many of them sold like a few times a year ago or longer, and they'll probably never be put up for sale again, but you can start to see how people are pricing them. I think if anything, this is true for everything across defi. I tend to look at these patterns until they just are so obvious and make sense, and then I feel like I'm ready to potentially try my own strategy if it doesn't make sense to me and it all feels like a bunch of random activity. I'm like, I clearly don't understand what's going on here and I probably shouldn't be.
00:53:45.270 - 00:54:57.580, Speaker B: One thing I would add to that is looking at this kind of loan data, you're getting a kind of signal that you're not getting by looking at other places, right? So if you go to opensea and you're looking at floor prices or recent sales, what that's telling you is what does the market think right now these things are worth? If you come to niftify and you look and you see, hey, you can see here last month the average apr shot up and now it's back down again. Right? So it tells you that our lenders need to make a decision based on what they think this asset is going to do over the loan period. So they have to have a bit of a forward looking view on what these assets are worth. It's like a different kind of signal that you're not getting in other marketplaces. And I think over time we want to make sure that this information is easy to digest. And we're working on some improvements on the platform that show this in a more clear way. But it is something that, it gives you some information that a lot of people aren't looking at.
00:54:57.950 - 00:55:15.598, Speaker A: Maybe we should end on that then. Are there any signals that you've picked up on among all this data? Any takeaways for you in terms of what are lenders thinking about the value of these NFTs?
00:55:15.774 - 00:56:07.170, Speaker B: Yeah, one thing is lending activity hasn't dried up, so lenders don't think that NFTs are going away. The default rates, you saw how low the default rate was for board apes, right? Board apes also lost some of their value over the last while, but people still are paying back those loans. I think you can see these top projects that have really good liquidity and really good ApRs. There's a general consensus in the market that these things are at least safer investments than some of the other stuff. Right. We're still very early and who knows what's going to happen. But it gives you a clear signal on which are the quality projects.
00:56:07.170 - 00:56:19.060, Speaker B: These top ones over here really are kind of what I would consider blue chips. That's the main thing for me.
00:56:22.550 - 00:57:09.270, Speaker A: Yeah. So interesting that term, blue chip NFTs gets thrown around quite a bit. I feel like we've settled on probably one of the best ways to assess what does the community of collectors, investors, liquidity providers, what do they think is blue chip where people are putting their money, where their mouth is here? I think that speaks to these different collections. And by the way, too, as we discuss all of this too, I would disclose myself if I was holding any of these, but I unfortunately don't hold any of these more valuable NFT collections we just highlighted. But I think they're just really cool. I've always enjoyed. I still think punks is my favorite.
00:57:09.270 - 00:57:21.590, Speaker A: I've always had a respect for what board apes created in terms of a following, but I still feel like punks are like, that's the thing that will be in a museum someday, hopefully.
00:57:21.670 - 00:57:41.840, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I would say I think of punks more like an art project than a profile picture project. Everybody's got 10,000 and why? Well, because punks have 10,000, so they really kind of set the tone for everything that happened after them.
00:57:42.610 - 00:58:15.820, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree. Well, reminder to everyone, they can follow Niftyfi and you, Stephen, on Twitter here, they can visit niftyfi.com to learn more about the platform which we have walked through, hopefully every imaginable use case there. And also you all have a discord. So if they really want to learn more and talk with other users or any of you on the team, you can go there. And otherwise just. Thanks so much for your time.
00:58:15.820 - 00:59:04.934, Speaker A: This is, truthfully, I think one of the best interviews I've had in a while. There's a lot here that one can act on. I'm not encouraging any of this as financial advice, but I just think from a learning perspective, there's a lot to take home from. I think what you pointed out with interest rates, the fact that lenders are clearly very confident in the future of these different NfT collections as they continue to lend against them. Yeah, this is a reminder of how far we've come. Four years ago, it was really rough. There was very little you could do, and most of it was trading on centralized crypto exchanges.
00:59:04.934 - 00:59:33.746, Speaker A: Now we have this ability to use these peer to peer type tools and actually coordinate and invest and do whatever you do on chain. So this is reminder to everyone. This is all built on Ethereum main net. And Steven had pointed out, in the future, they're keeping their eyes on different Ethereum l two s to see which of them become more dominant. But Steven, anything else to share before we go?
00:59:33.928 - 00:59:43.366, Speaker B: No, that's it. I just wanted to say thanks. This was a really fun discussion, and it's fun to riff on these things with somebody else who's clearly as passionate about as I am.
00:59:43.548 - 01:00:36.162, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you're building for all of us weirdos in this space, and I think that's the future. If you're a builder trying to figure out how to survive this crypto winter bear market, whatever the hell we're in, I think the key is focus on those that are already here. Because those users, they were here before the bull run, they'll be here after the next bull run. And that, to me, those are the users that will really carry you forward and evangelize the platform and onboard more folks into the space who can clearly benefit from all the utility here. But anyways, Steven, I'm going to end the broadcast best here. And just thanks everyone for joining us. If you enjoyed this, subscribe at DeFi dad, if you are a talented builder like Steven and his team, please reach out to me and my team at Fourthrevolution Capital.
01:00:36.162 - 01:00:43.410, Speaker A: We'd love to back you and potentially partner with you. So everyone have a great day. We'll see you next time. Bye.
