00:00:26.890 - 00:01:07.680, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad. Today I'm going to show you how I have used sin synthetics exchange to gain exposure to a basket of Defi related tokens without having to buy the individual tokens. So this saves me a lot of gas, it saves me time. It also is a way for me to maintain exposure without having to keep track of multiple tokens. So to start out, synthetix is a protocol for trading synthetic assets on ethereum. Exactly what it says here. What's really interesting about this is that synthetix powers this exchange where all I have to do is connect my metamask wallet or whatever Ethereum wallet you're using.
00:01:07.680 - 00:02:07.490, Speaker A: And then I have the ability to go long or short on a variety of assets, some of which don't normally trade on Ethereum, but because others have over collateralized the system with SNX and ether, I am able to gain exposure to these different tokens that are tracking cryptocurrencies, not on ethereum forex, even commodities like gold and silver. So what you're seeing here is I could buy this SDFI, which stands for synth DeFi. This is a long version. So this is me going long on a basket of defi tokens. If I were to look up instead IdFi. This is actually, let's just do it this way. So if you to show you that again, click the little widget and then say that you want to buy IdfI, and then I'm going to sell Susd.
00:02:07.490 - 00:03:06.178, Speaker A: There we go. So this is me going short on a basket of defi tokens. So if you're bearish on defi, you put your money where your mouth is and come here and you can gain exposure to IDFi, which is kind of ironic because you're actually using defi to go short on defi. Aside from the ease of just connecting my Ethereum wallet and not having to go through KYC and maintaining custody of all of my assets, another interesting part of synthetix is the fact that all I'm really doing is exchanging what's referred to as network debt. And that allows me to gain exposure to these different synths or derivatives. And remember, s represents the long version, I represents an inverse synth, or going short on these different assets. And so there is no pairing that exists on synthetic exchange.
00:03:06.178 - 00:03:42.434, Speaker A: I can go in between whichever assets I want. I can trade any path I want from one synth to another. So, for example, I could start out with Su. Let's say I'm starting out with Susd and I want to buy SBTC. So I could go that route. However, then let's say that I've got my SBTC, and I want to now sell my SBTC for, let's say, s Europe. There we go.
00:03:42.434 - 00:04:32.470, Speaker A: And then I could go from, let's say, s euro to the s nik. So there's no limitation here is all. I mean, it's frictionless for me to hop from one synth to another. So going back to what are the synths available? If I go to synthetics exchange hashtag synths, there's a list of all of these different types of synths. And so to categorize these, you've got crypto. So these are cryptocurrencies, some of which, again, don't normally trade on Ethereum. Like tezos.
00:04:32.470 - 00:05:14.378, Speaker A: You've got Ethereum, classic, cardano, ripple, dash, tron, bitcoin, cash, and bitcoin, of course. So you can go long or short on bitcoin using SBTC or IBTC on synthetics. You can also trade with forex. So you've got the euro, the swiss franc, australian dollars, british pound, japanese yen. So all of this is available. We've also got equities and indices. Right now, this is the Nike 225 index and the FTSE 100 index.
00:05:14.378 - 00:05:40.326, Speaker A: So these are ways to go long on that index. But you can do that again just using this ERC 20 token that trades on synthetics exchange. And then lastly we have commodities like silver and gold. Just note that both of these are also s. So S means long. There's no inverse here. I can't actually short silver or gold at this point.
00:05:40.326 - 00:06:31.722, Speaker A: And all of these are ERC 20 tokens, so they trade on synthetics exchange. Some of them you'll actually find on Dex aggregators. So as liquidity grows, I'm sure we'll see sdfi and some of these other synths show up in one inch because all you need is another liquidity pool like uniswap to be providing that liquidity so that I can use a Dex aggregator and buy and sell that token for. Right now, though, we're just going to focus on synthetics exchange. So this is the new composition of SDFI. These are all the tokens that make it up. And you'll notice the highlights of that are that lend, Uma, comp, and Bal have all been added to this, which are all really popular mainstream defi related tokens.
00:06:31.722 - 00:07:38.100, Speaker A: So it makes sense that I think folks will want exposure to these tokens if you're going to hold SDFI. This is different than what SDFI was previously. So as long as I'm purchasing this on July 23 and beyond, this is what the token will be made up of. Just a quick note. If I am buying this before July 23, that's UTC. If I'm buying this before July 23 and this DFI token or sdfi has not been converted to this new composition, I am buying an old composition which does not include lend, Uma, comp, and Bell. So it's important to note that and to know that the new SD five and Scex tokens will be available for trading on synthetics exchange on July 23, and that they're being converted to a new index composition.
00:07:38.100 - 00:08:34.234, Speaker A: So the way I get started with synthetics exchange is connect my wallet and I can choose any one of these wallets. If you're not familiar with wallet Connect, a lot of Ethereum wallets have an integration with this bridge that is wallet connect. And so if I click it, it'll let me then scan this with the mobile wallet, like something like a trust wallet, and then that'll connect me to my trust wallet. So I'm going to go and click metamask. The next thing I need is to exchange one of my assets in my Ethereum wallet for a synth. And remember, synths are these erc 20 tokens that track all these different assets that trade on synthetics exchange. The price feed is powered by chainlink.
00:08:34.234 - 00:09:23.070, Speaker A: For all of these, in order for me to participate in the game that is happening on synthetics exchange, I need a synth, and the most common one of course, is SUSD. You can also use se, but I'm going to start out with a stable coin. I'm going to choose to use uniswap v two today just because currently gas prices are actually a little bit higher using one inch for this really small trade. So you'll notice that one inch is one of my favorite Dex aggregators to find the best rate and least amount of slippage. But I'm going to actually go directly to uniswap to save on gas today. So I'm going to go ahead and connect my wallet. Connect metamask.
00:09:23.070 - 00:09:58.570, Speaker A: Okay, give permission to connect to my wallet. So I'm going to input USDC. Here we go. And then let's look for Su SD. There we go. And I'm going to buy ten USDC of SUsD. So I'll go ahead and first give approval to move my SUSD, and then the second transaction will actually execute the swap.
00:09:58.570 - 00:10:39.990, Speaker A: So I'm checking ethgastation info. It's telling me that as long as the gas price is greater than 41 guay. It'll push through in less than 30 minutes. So I'm going to click edit, click on Advanced. I'll make this 42. If 41 is the lower barrier to getting this through in less than 30 minutes, I always up it just a little bit so that it'll go through faster. You'll notice I'm now saving just a little bit of money on gas, but that can add up over time.
00:10:39.990 - 00:11:18.522, Speaker A: And then in terms of permission, this is essentially giving unlimited, and I'm going to instead give permission to just move ten USDC. And there we go. We're all set to go. So we've reduced the amount of gas I'm going to pay, given permission to only move ten USDC so I can hit confirm. All right, so my transaction has gone through, which gives approval to swap my ten USDC. So now I can hit swap and this will actually execute the trade. By the way, I love the fact that it shows you what is the price impact.
00:11:18.522 - 00:12:16.216, Speaker A: So if you're someone who's trading more than ten USDC, which I would imagine many folks are, you can actually see just what impact that'll have on the pool if you're trading a much larger amount. So cool. Let's do this one thing. Before I execute this swap, I want to call out the fact that while gas prices are high, this is considered high for most of us. Still, they're probably going to remain high. And so that means that the positions that I am moving or trading on ethereum need to justify these gas costs. And so while one of the things I love about DeFi is that you can play with any minimum amount of money you want, but when I am moving, let's say 100 or 1000 USDC, this becomes less of a burden to me.
00:12:16.216 - 00:13:04.650, Speaker A: So I'm only playing with ten USDC here. And so this sort of gas, if I were looking at that as a form of investment, I mean, this is not great, or I'm spending 40% of the initial capital that I'm playing with here. But again, this is more for the sake of experimentation. So just a reminder that the size of your position does really matter here when you're considering these gas prices and what they eat up in terms of your capital. So I'm going to do the same thing I did before and click edit, click on advanced and let's see what the gas price is on egastation. Info same thing as long as it's over 41. So let's put it through at 42.
00:13:04.650 - 00:13:30.610, Speaker A: And there we go. So my gas price dropped just a bit there. I'm spending around zero point 15 E. And let's do this. Once my transaction is submitted, I can click on ether scan just to check it out. So this is claiming it could take up to 19 minutes. And there you go.
00:13:30.610 - 00:14:14.856, Speaker A: You'll find that when you use uniswap, they tend to overestimate fees. So nothing wrong with experimenting with dropping the gas price. But just be aware that if I drop it too low, my transaction could get stuck and then I'll have to send a dummy transaction to unstick it. So here we go. I traded ten USDC. And what happened inside of Uniswap is that it eventually traded to ten Susd. Now that I've got my ten SusD, I can now buy the SDFI token on synthetics exchange.
00:14:14.856 - 00:14:56.208, Speaker A: So the first thing I'm going to do is click here and click the little widget icon so I can say that I want to buy SDFI and then I'm going to sell. And, and by the way, you can see that there's a long list here of different tokens or different synths that you can purchase. So you can check that out yourself and kind of comb through what interests you. But this again is a basket of DeFi related tokens. Remember that this is an index. It is tracking the prices of the underlying basket of tokens. So it's not like buying or selling.
00:14:56.208 - 00:15:30.052, Speaker A: Pressure is going to move the price up or down here. This is nothing more than a basket. That is, again, it's an index. And all of this is happening thanks to chain link oracles. So what I'm going to do then is we'll put in my full balance here of ten point 19 SUSD. I'm going to buy then. 00:36 SDFI recognize too, that this is all based on a market order, so there's no sort of limit price.
00:15:30.052 - 00:16:35.628, Speaker A: You can't place a limit order yet, but that is coming for synthetics exchange. So you'll notice I'm buying ten point $19 of SDFI. I've still got the same issue here with gas prices, so just be aware that this is something I can choose to edit. But the way that I decide on gas price is what does the ETH gas station tell me? I also could risk lowering the gas price and then really just set it and forget it and basically let the transaction run as long as needed until gas prices drop in the next few hours or possibly in the next day. All right, so let's go ahead and hit confirm. Okay, this all looks good to me, but again, let's emphasize that I'm running this as an experiment. If I were looking at this as more of an investment into SDFI, I personally would have considered buying a larger position to justify spending 4.90
00:16:35.628 - 00:17:17.050, Speaker A: on gas. All right, so my transaction just went through. I know that because it says confirmed. I can click verify here to look at it on ether scan. So you'll notice I started with about $10 of SUSD, and then I ended up with SDFI. One other thing I want to call attention to is just that whatever the estimate of gas was before, it tends to come out as less, even when gas prices are really high. So it's one of the small bits of silver lining while gas prices are high.
00:17:17.050 - 00:18:05.490, Speaker A: So that's it. That's how easy it is. And now, if I were to click on my wallet, it'll actually show me here a list of all of my different synths. You can also conveniently see it here, but this is where I would see a list of everything that I'm holding. And then I believe that synthetics is going to release, like a portfolio view here, so that you can see your portfolio and synths going up and down in terms of value over time. Let's pretend that I'm ready to exit from SDFI. I no longer want exposure to it.
00:18:05.490 - 00:18:54.556, Speaker A: What I'm going to do is find one of the more liquid synths that trade on other exchanges or in different liquidity pools. The three most popular ones, in order of which are most liquid, is SUSD. That's the most liquid. Then there's ETH, and then there's SBTC. And so I would come here then and say that I am going to sell sdfi and I'm going to buy back SUSD, and so I can then come here. And there we go. So I'm going to sell my SDFI back to SUSD, and then I would hit confirm the trade.
00:18:54.556 - 00:19:46.940, Speaker A: Once that's gone through, I'm now in SUSD. Let's pretend that for some reason, I don't want to hold that any longer. Even though SUSD is actually a very popular stable coin, you can use it to buy other assets on a Dex aggregator, like one inch exchange. I could go to curve Phi SUsdv two, and this is where I can trade SUSD to any one of these stablecoins. Another option is if I had gone the route of SE, I could have then gone back to one inch exchange. That's probably one of the best places to find the best rates for going from SE back to ether. And then the last one is if for some reason I wanted to continue to hold exposure to bitcoin, I actually could hold SBTC.
00:19:46.940 - 00:20:46.630, Speaker A: Or if I had SBTC, I could come here and say I'm going to swap my SBTC for wrapped BTC. Let's recap the risks that I consider and I accept when I'm using synthetics exchange to gain exposure to SDFI first. At the top of the list is smart contract risk. So if there's a bug that were discovered that somehow put funds at risk, that would be a big concern of mine. The one way that I can protect myself is I can go to nexusmutual IO, click on get a quote, and then this is kind of like getting a quote for car insurance. You pay 1.29% annually and you can fortunately buy smart contract cover for as many days as you'd like, as long as it's a minimum of 30 days.
00:20:46.630 - 00:21:26.654, Speaker A: So let's just put in 30 days. For this example, let's pretend that I had 1000 die in the system. Let's pretend that if a smart contract bug were discovered and that whether or not my funds actually were at risk, I will get a payout as long as there's a smart contract bug that's discovered. But ideally this is to protect me. If my funds were at risk, I would normally just choose from one of these buttons above. But if you go to the discord group in Nexus mutual, they have a list of all the different applications they actually cover. So I'm going to put in synthetics Nexus mutual ETH.
00:21:26.654 - 00:22:07.032, Speaker A: This is only because I've used this before and I know it. It's not like you just toss the name in ahead of Nexus mutual ETH, but go to the discord group for Nexus mutual and they have a list of all of these names. So there we go. Let's get a quote and see how much this will cost. So it's going to be 1.54 die for me to have 30 days of coverage. Pretty cheap for peace of mind to sleep at night.
00:22:07.032 - 00:23:00.392, Speaker A: Basically a dollar 50 for me to know that I will get a payout of, let's say, my 1000 die. And then you can continue to play with this if you go back up here and adjust the quote. So feel free to check this out yourself. And this is something I actually use for other defi applications, especially the popular ones here like compound and instadap and uniswap and Aave. Another risk to consider is the over collateralization of synths trading on synthetics. So the synths that are trading are over collateralized by SNX that's been deposited into synthetics. And that means that with a required collateralization ratio of 750% for every SUSD that is minted, that means that $7.5
00:23:00.392 - 00:24:01.390, Speaker A: of value must be collateralized. That means that at this point, we're looking at the collateralization is around 797% or 800%. This is good. This is something that I've watched over the last year, and I've participated in staking, and those that are staking in SNX are being rewarded with SNX weekly, so they're financially incentivized to continue to over collateralize the system. That being said, it's partially because there's a lot of brave experimentation going on on synthetics. And so I just recognize that this is sort of a new frontier where we have a peer to peer exchange that's allowing for synthetic assets to trade. And so I just recognize there's probably a lot here that I don't know, and there's a certain amount of risk to be accepted in using this system.
00:24:01.390 - 00:25:04.784, Speaker A: The next risk to consider is the fact that there are oracles that are feeding in these asset prices and synthetics. And so that is another vector for attack. And we've actually seen in the past that that vector for attack can be exploited, but the team has done quite a bit of work to mitigate that risk, and they're actually using Chainlink oracles now. So, anyways, it's just something else that I'm conscious of that the reason that these assets are able to trade as synths on synthetics is the fact that they are dependent on oracles. And if those oracles fail, that's not good. The last major risk that I consider is really to do with my dependency on the swap rates between SUSD and any other stablecoin and then Se and ether. So I would highly recommend checking out curve phiusdv two.
00:25:04.784 - 00:25:43.310, Speaker A: This pool has over 18 million in stable coins. And so I found that this is one of the best places to trade in and out of SUSD today. It just turned out that uniswap was actually offering a better rate. And I knew that because I went to one inch exchange and it showed me that the best rate was there at Uniswap. Okay, that's all I've got for you today. I hope you find this helpful. I know that synthetics is one of the most talked about projects in Defi on Ethereum, but I think more people hopefully will learn about what is the underlying value to it.
00:25:43.310 - 00:26:08.910, Speaker A: Token prices are fun to watch go up and down, but at the end of the day, I love synthetics because I can trade with just my Ethereum wallet and I can gain exposure to all sorts of interesting assets, including novel and creative derivatives like SDFI. Let me know if you have any questions in the YouTube comments or on Twitter and I'll see you next time.
