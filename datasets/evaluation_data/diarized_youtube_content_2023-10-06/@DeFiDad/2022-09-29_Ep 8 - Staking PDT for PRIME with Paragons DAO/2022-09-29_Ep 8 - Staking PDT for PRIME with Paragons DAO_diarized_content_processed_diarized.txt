00:00:07.690 - 00:00:42.874, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us. This is Prime Talks. I'm DFI dad from fourth revolution capital. It is Monday, September 26, 2022. I'm joined here today by DFI Ted from Paragon's Dow, and we are recording this and planning to release this just as PD staking goes live. So this has been long in planning and building, so it'll be exciting to finally allow PDT holders to be able to earn a share of the prime that's being earned through Paragon's Dao. So, Ted, thanks for joining me, man.
00:00:42.874 - 00:00:43.820, Speaker A: How are you doing?
00:00:44.270 - 00:00:51.434, Speaker B: I'm doing great, Mr. Defi dad. It's good to be on a show again and be with you today.
00:00:51.552 - 00:01:06.130, Speaker A: And so, Ted, just in case anyone's new to Paragons, do you want to kind of tell the story of what do you guys do at Paragons? What's the mission? And then I'd love to show off what the UI looks like for PDT staking.
00:01:06.950 - 00:02:01.362, Speaker B: Sure. So we're a collective group of just community enthusiasts around kind of crypto and web3, especially gaming. We were onto the parallel ecosystem very early. We love the cards. It is our slogan. And what we wanted to do is have a way that we could actually form like a dow and a community around these assets and then other gaming ecosystems in the future, where we could create basically a pool of returns where the gamers can kind of share in their upside together in comparison with kind of the esports model that is today, where the actual players probably on the losing side of the ticket, even if they're the winner. So, yeah, that's kind of how we formed today.
00:02:01.362 - 00:02:11.400, Speaker B: We're at a very important milestone in regards to the staking being ready to launch, and that's the very start of kind of the player share model that we have in mind.
00:02:12.570 - 00:02:26.380, Speaker A: Awesome. So do you want to actually show off the staking UI right now? And then we'll run through some of the common questions that folks will probably run into as they start to use this.
00:02:26.830 - 00:03:12.998, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So let's jump straight into our. This is our test environment at the moment, but this is what you're going to see when it does go live. So for those, just so you know, when the push goes live, which will be sometime this week, there'll be a staking link just at the top. So you'll be able to just click the staking link and go straight into the staking. So as you can see here, it's a basic dashboard that just shows your holdings what the rewards now, the rewards here are the total rewards that are available in this epoch tool, and what sits in that wallet and what's currently in the wallet that I have. So if I just kind of touch this here, that's the prime.
00:03:12.998 - 00:03:24.566, Speaker B: You're holding your wallet also there. That's the prime, the sum of the prime that's in my wallet as well. The claimable amount here will be what is accrued for claim from that pool.
00:03:24.758 - 00:03:40.820, Speaker A: Ted, what determines the amount of prime that we're able to start earning whenever the epoch begins? Hopefully this week? What determines that amount to kick off?
00:03:41.350 - 00:04:17.360, Speaker B: So right now, what you won't be able to see is the live example of some of the dashboard stuff that we're building at the moment. But it'll be determined based on 30% of the returns that we make today. So right now we're averaging about 2700 prime a day in returns based on all of our assets. So it's quite significant. And then 30% of that will continually go into a pool and then be claimable once a quarter. So each quarter at the end of each epoch, a claimable amount per user. So let's take this example that there's 25,000 prime in there.
00:04:17.360 - 00:05:00.706, Speaker B: And if I hold and I'm staking my assets, and it says that I'm entitled to 1% of the pool is my weight of prime plus my multiply. We'll explain that in a second. Then I should be entitled to 250 prime tokens at my 1%. So that would be available there for claim. It's very simple. We'll be able to show you how much is going to be due into the pool by 30% of the total amount that we're earning from those assets. And then that pool will be up for claim each epoch.
00:05:00.706 - 00:05:41.434, Speaker B: And what will determine that is how much PDT that you have staked and then how long you've staked that for. So our contract, most people will be familiar with kind of the voted escrow, which is the ve model curve, uses that today. Anything that's got a gauge, basically. So you're forced to determine a lockup period, and then you'll get a multiplier for that period of time that you force lock those tokens. And that gives you benefit in the protocol. So one of the things that I think that we wanted to avoid is actually locking people in. We wanted to reward people for the actual behavior rather than forcing the behavior itself.
00:05:41.434 - 00:06:38.026, Speaker B: So what our staking model does is allows anyone to stake, and it will then determine on the time it'll term a multiplier. And the multiplier is your weight will double per year. That's how the multiplier works right now. If you unstake any amount, you go back to zero. Any multiplier of time, if you ever unstake an amount. So if you have a million staked and I unstake one PDT, multiplier disappears. Right now, the gamification in the ve model is the unstaked period, the unlocking, and then that's meant to be a bearish catalyst, right? But we're like, well, why does that have to be bearish? Why can't that be slash? Why can't someone be actually like, if you remove your stake, then there should be a net loss and then a net win to everyone else.
00:06:38.026 - 00:06:49.918, Speaker B: So you lose your multiplier for taking the other side of the behavior model that we're trying to incentivize. And everyone else that stays in the pool gets a bigger piece.
00:06:50.084 - 00:07:23.130, Speaker A: Very cool. So whenever this launches, it's a matter, per usual of how much PDT do I have, and then how long do I stay in the pool without having to lock up? Just basically play it by ear, which is nice, I think, here, because then if you do need it, for whatever reason, there's no reason that you can't withdraw. But this is clearly going to reward those who just remain 100% in the staking and don't unstake even one PDT.
00:07:23.710 - 00:07:51.886, Speaker B: That's correct. So let's go ahead and stake some of that now. Right? So I've already kind of approved that. You can see I've got a million PDT sitting in the wallet here in the test. So you can either use a little scale here to kind of determine how much you want to put in, or you can just enter it here. So we'll put half of it in there. We'll stake.
00:07:51.886 - 00:08:25.008, Speaker B: That's the complication is in the back end, allowing for a very simplified way to look at it, you can clearly see there, everything's updated. You can see that I've now got 1.7% of the total states pool. At the moment, that's what I am. And as time goes on, that'll reward me. So it's a one times multiplier, which is no multiplier. But if I was to come back tomorrow, that would be a 1.25
00:08:25.008 - 00:09:11.216, Speaker B: each day. At the moment, the test net is one day equals one quarter, and therefore every four days is a year, just to kind of test make sure the multipliers are working, and then it'll determine what my reward amount will be based on the pool of PDT, pool of prime available to claim at that time, and that'll continue to go up based on the pool that's accruing at that time. So you'll continually see how much you have in the pool and how it's growing in real time, determined for that. And then if you do unstake, we do give you the warning, because unstaking any amount returns your whole balance. And it's kind of the way that we forced the math to work that way to reallocate the waiting each time. And that just turned out to be a really nice way to kind of reward in a slashing, rather than trying.
00:09:11.238 - 00:09:34.100, Speaker A: To build something else in the future when prime becomes transferable, I might then of course claim prime, because I'm going to use it elsewhere, use it in parallel, sell it, whatever. Am I able then to claim prime without any sort of penalty to the multiplier I'm earning with PDT?
00:09:34.260 - 00:09:59.520, Speaker B: Correct. So claiming will not actually impact your stake. So stake is one thing. So your stake of PDT in there is just determining on your weight, and the pool is from another part of the contract is from another contract. So you'll be able to continue to claim prime, not a problem, and just leave your stake there. And then over time that'll be prime. And that could be a bunch of other tokens as well that we're involved in.
00:09:59.520 - 00:10:18.840, Speaker B: I mean, we've got arbo assets, we've got Ragnarok assets, and we've also got the frontier assets. At the moment, we were already scoping out a couple of other. So this will be one stake will determine your reward, waiting on all pools that ever come through the paragon ecosystem.
00:10:19.660 - 00:10:24.810, Speaker A: Ted, anything else to call out here in terms of the PDT staking that's coming?
00:10:25.180 - 00:11:10.040, Speaker B: Yeah, for the staking, a few questions early was kind of like, is there a receipt token, like a staked version of the PDT that you can use? How is it, do I lose my governance rights? A bunch of different. So the answer to the governance is that you will still be able to vote on our council elections by having staked PDT. So that's not going to affect you at all. You can still connect via Colab into our discord. So all of those connections will still work. The one thing that will be different, though, is that there isn't a receipt token for this. We've made it out v one specifically that way to force the behavior of wanting to stake rather than composing that asset a bit later on.
00:11:10.110 - 00:11:27.596, Speaker A: Really just want to ask you more generally, before we wrap up, any other updates on Paragon's dow you'd like to share? I know there was a Paragon's council vote that I thought passed today related to the Blackhand partnership. Do you want to share anything on that?
00:11:27.778 - 00:12:21.952, Speaker B: Yeah. So in about 20 minutes, that'll be up. But it's already reached quorum from our treasury, from our Paragon's council, which is a six or seven, and that is our MoU to partner with Blackhand and the stadium protocol. So what that partnership looks like is stadium protocol is a tournament and league based set up web3 design, allowing people to create memberships, player IDs, team iDs, and allegiances with each other to be able to share rewards and returns across both web two and web3 gaming. So you can set up a Call of duty or capstruck go team on here as well. So it involves both sides. What our aim is is that we will have stadium be built on our liquidity holdings to flesh out and build out a league basically for parallel and other ecosystems that we're a part of.
00:12:21.952 - 00:13:22.064, Speaker B: And our aim is to make that the Premier league in the space. So for most games, you need to turn up with your own assets or your own computer or whatever it may be, you know what I mean? Like CSGO skins, all that, you got to buy it yourself. Whereas with what we want to do is we want everyone to have access to every card and make any possible deck, and we want the best strategists to win. So our league is going to be, we want it to be considered where the best players want to play. So that's our aim. And partnering with Blackhand, who have obviously a history in esports and a recent winner of an esports world championships in the Pokemon game that they participated in, I think we're in a good standing to kind of put that together for an inaugural event with already a few teams already confirmed to be a part of that. So there's a lot happening there.
00:13:22.064 - 00:14:07.308, Speaker B: And then for Paraguay's dow themselves, part of that MoU will also involve our player management and membership onboarding. So watch this space this quarter. You're going to be able to mint an NFT with Paragons, but I'll have more on that at a later date. I think that the big catalyst coming up for parallel will be listening for when their beta will go live. So we should know about that at some time this quarter. So there's definitely a reason to be like you said keeping up to date with the discords and keeping up to date with the news. Anyone that is stressed out from that bear market that we're talking about, and for those that aren't building in it, go and play some games.
00:14:07.308 - 00:14:41.932, Speaker B: Go and refresh yourself with what it's like just to have some fun because it may be very important as we move into this new web3 play to earn dynamic. Yeah. Prepare yourself for the web3 gaming onslaught that will come eventually. I know it's not there yet. Outside of that, we've got treasury council and Paragon's council elections to come up at the end of next quarter. So for those that have ever thought about maybe being involved in a Dow, here's your chance. We're an open group.
00:14:41.932 - 00:14:51.920, Speaker B: You can put, anyone can nominate, and we're always looking for different crossover of skills and attributes to come and help us continue to make decisions in this dao and push it in the right direction.
00:14:53.140 - 00:15:22.152, Speaker A: So if you want to learn more about those opportunities to go to paragonsdao.com. Reminder to follow Ted and Paragonsdao on Twitter. If you want to learn more about parallel specifically, of course, go to parallel life or echelon IO. And other than that, just thanks so much, Ted. Thanks for joining me. Really good to catch up. And like I said, I'm excited for the PDT staking to go live.
00:15:22.152 - 00:16:02.100, Speaker A: I don't want to downplay the significance of delivering on a promise. Since the start of this dow that's really been about how can we collect these very rare assets that certain players are going to want access to when they're playing parallel. Others might be just collectors or fans of the parallel franchise. And so this is one way they can get involved is basically by earning a fractional amount of prime through these different assets. So anyways, congrats, man, on all the progress. I know it's taken a lot of building and time and effort.
00:16:03.480 - 00:16:33.872, Speaker B: Yes, thank you. It does take a little bit of time. It was something that we couldn't just fork. We had to kind of put together from the ground up. It took a few iterations with a little bit of math playing around, but we were very confident once we got there that we're going to be able to deliver this for the people all involved. And this is just version one of how this whole kind of return to the user process works and returning value. So this is just stage one.
00:16:33.872 - 00:16:40.450, Speaker B: There's a few more stages to go and I'm really excited to get this one launched and move on to the next.
00:16:41.400 - 00:17:14.440, Speaker A: Awesome. And quick reminder before we go, if you enjoy prime talks, please think of my team at Fourthrevolution Capital. Anyways. Yeah, if you're building the next great web3 game or anything in web3, please consider reaching out to me and my team there at fourth Revolution Capital. So, anyways, Ted, thanks again, man, and we'll end the broadcast here, and we'll see you all next time. Bye.
