00:00:00.490 - 00:00:33.890, Speaker A: Today's show features an emerging giant in the world of decentralized perps trading polynomial protocol. This spring, Polynomial launched its decentralized Perps exchange with up to 25 x leverage on top of optimism, using synthetics as its source of liquidity. Since then, polynomial has seen enormous growth to become one of the top synthetics perps trading front end, if not number one. Any given day in this this episode, we'll dig into what's attracting so much trading liquidity to polynomial and how they plan to sustain their growth as a DeFi derivatives powerhouse.

The best thing is that you can make perps for any illiquid market, and for crypto, it has a product market fit. You see people trading trillions like in the peak of bull market. So we wanted to make that same thing happen on a Decentralmex exchange, and we wanted to do our part.
