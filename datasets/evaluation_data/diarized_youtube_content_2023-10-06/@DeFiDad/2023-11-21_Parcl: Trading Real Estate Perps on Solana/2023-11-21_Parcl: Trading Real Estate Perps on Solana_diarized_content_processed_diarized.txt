00:00:00.490 - 00:00:43.530, Speaker A: I was working with Kellen at our old hedge fund and COVID happened and there was a ton of real estate volatility and we wanted to be able to effectively bet on markets in real estate without owning underlying real estate. I. E. Like I want to short New York property values, I want to long my AME or Austin or vice versa of. So there was like a glaring kind of hole in the market. We decided to basically create price feeds that track the price per square foot of real estate based on sales and listings, and create like a median price per square foot to be a reference price for an index.
00:00:46.110 - 00:01:39.306, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four RC today's show Spotlights Parcel, the unique DFI application where traders can speculate on rising and falling real estate markets across the globe. Built on Solana, Parcel is a decentralized perpetuals exchange designed for real estate synthetics with as little as $1. Anyone can long or short city indexes that represent the aggregate value of city property prices in places like New York City, Miami beach, and more. In this episode, we'll discuss the recently launched Parcel V three, including what improvements and new features were added to attract more liquidity and trade volume for this very powerful DFI use case. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.

00:02:57.790 - 00:03:40.798, Speaker C: Everybody at this point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your staked ETH mint, a liquid staking token, and then use that token in defi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, oracle networks, other blockchains and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH.
00:03:40.798 - 00:04:06.934, Speaker C: In Defi. We are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:04:07.062 - 00:04:12.720, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:04:14.770 - 00:04:56.410, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up.

00:04:56.830 - 00:05:15.026, Speaker B: Let'S introduce Trevor Bacon. Prior to starting parcel two years ago with his co founders, Trevor was a portfolio manager and investment analyst at several hedge funds focused on technology, equities related to software, Internet payments, and fintech investing. So Trevor, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:05:15.128 - 00:05:16.962, Speaker A: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.
00:05:17.016 - 00:06:11.122, Speaker B: I have used Parcel since V one. It has been one of the standout applications for me within the Salana DFI ecosystem, and I think the elevator pitch that I've always given for parcel is that you can trade speculate long or short with leverage using city indexes so you can cleverly gain exposure whether you are bullish or bearish on the real estate markets across the globe. And this is a use case that I really believe is going to take off. But we're here today to spotlight it because we think we're still early. As you all are building liquidity and launching new products, I'd love to still start with your background. I'm actually most interested for you to reflect today. It's November 2023.
00:06:11.122 - 00:06:39.906, Speaker B: I'd love for you to reflect also on the decision to build on Salana, because Salana has had a major shift in sentiment over the last several months. And I want to say you probably fought some headwinds in making that decision in the last few years. So anyways, Trevor, maybe kick off a little bit more with what led you into crypto and then love to talk about the origins of parcel.
00:06:40.038 - 00:07:22.266, Speaker A: Totally, yeah. Thanks for having me again. So my background was in technology stocks mainly. I used to manage a portfolio and analyze companies within the software, Internet and payment space. That included, starting in 2017, some of the early blockchain companies, which would be like consensus or ripple what happens on Wall street. If you have an emerging industry, the bankers will take these companies around to hedge funds and have them meet the management teams, because the hope is that they'll eventually ipo through that bank and they'll make fees. So that's what they do.
00:07:22.266 - 00:08:10.150, Speaker A: And that's really how I'd obviously been aware of bitcoin, but started to really learn more about blockchain. So that's how I was familiarized with blockchain. And fast forward, like four years later, I was working with Kellen at our old hedge fund, and COVID happened and there was a ton of real estate volatility. And we wanted to be able to effectively bet on markets in real estate without owning underlying real estate. I. E. I want to short New York property values, I want to long Miame or Austin or vice know there was like a glaring kind of hole in the market.
00:08:10.150 - 00:09:23.060, Speaker A: There'd been a lot of attempts to fractionalize real estate, where you buy a house, split it up, and then offer it to your user base. And the thesis is that that could be a great opportunity, but the scale necessary requires a lot of capital and time to build enough of a product through the physical infrastructure. So we decided to basically create price feeds that track the price per square foot of real estate based on sales and listings. So on the ground, sales and listings, and create like a median price per square foot to be a reference price for an index that you could trade. And then at the time d five summer was going on. Global formation of capital, relatively efficient, or actually very efficient, versus the exchange infrastructures and the traditional Wall street banking infrastructures. You could have a contract, settle transactions, peer to peer, and clear transactions with a pretty small and efficient team.
00:09:23.060 - 00:10:20.180, Speaker A: We didn't initially start with perpetual contracts, but the blockchain is very well suited for perpetual contracts, which we just launched. So that kind of led us to where we are today with respect to Solana itself. We made that decision in the summer of 2021. It wasn't counter consensus, but it definitely wasn't consensus either. It was kind of. This is interesting, and at the time, though, the l two s were in kind of testnet mode, or they weren't really live, and the only option was polygon and mainnet ETH. So it was basically like, it's fast, cheap, scalable, and it has a good wallet infrastructure as well.
00:10:20.180 - 00:11:02.666, Speaker A: All of those things are probably necessary to actually go beyond the current user base of blockchain, which is relatively small, all things considered. So that was why we went with Solana. I would say. The way that I see it, there's been two major headwinds. One has been network outages, which there weren't a lot of them, but one can really be impactful in terms of trust that's being addressed via fire dancer. So a second client, written in a different coding language, creates a redundancy and a failover. So that's being addressed.
00:11:02.666 - 00:11:47.038, Speaker A: And obviously, FTX left a huge hole in the ecosystem in terms of liquidity, and it seems like we're moving past that know, and there's some gritty teams on Solana that have been building basically through the bear market that I think should reap the benefits of a resurgence, given that I don't know who came to Solana during the bear, like a few of them did. Like, a few companies kind of transferred like render helium, they moved over. But for the core infrastructure of Solana, it was hard to get funding. There's a lot of dynamics that go into play, but I'm glad to see it come back a little bit.
00:11:47.124 - 00:12:37.514, Speaker B: I personally had used a lot of Solana Defi during the bull run, and I was even surprised during the bear market, recognizing what was happening with the aftermath of FTX. I was still surprised how many applications saw as much liquidity shrink as they did. And then what happens, which is typical in crypto, is it's just so reflexive. It's reflexive to the upside and to the downside, and all that momentum to the upside. Not only felt like it got wiped out, but then it overcorrected, in my opinion, and I'm sure yours, to the downside. And I have just been pleasantly surprised. I think, like everyone, how quickly the sentiment has shifted.
00:12:37.514 - 00:13:05.602, Speaker B: And now you have all this interest in using applications on Solana. It's still early, there's still a lack of liquidity there, and it's building. But to give credit to folks like you and others who were building there through the bull run, it reminds me a bit of. It's not exactly the same. It's a very different time in history. Much more mature, too. Like, there's so much more you can do on Salana than you could in DFI 2018 2019.
00:13:05.602 - 00:13:31.280, Speaker B: But there's a group of very dedicated builders, and you have applications that are very useful to whatever size group of folks are using those. And those folks are very loud, and I can see it now, I can see the momentum building. So anyways, congrats on, I think, living through the worst of it, and I think there's just much better times ahead.
00:13:32.870 - 00:14:24.386, Speaker A: You never know. But, yeah, I think definitely to us, it's kind of like the token is going up, the day to day is unchanged. That was kind of like the only way to keep. Yeah, we don't really focus too much on it. We were at breakpoint, though, and I would say the tone this year was a lot more sophisticated. Projects have basically been building for a year, had some really good stuff to show, a lot less nfts, more kind of real world use cases, a lot of airdrop news, so some real good stuff. And then one thing that we're particularly excited about on Solana is this cross chain transfer protocol from circle that is on Testnet now, I believe.
00:14:24.386 - 00:14:54.806, Speaker A: But it's basically a way to transfer USDC across all chains. It atomically mints and burns into ERC to SPL, I believe, and that should allow liquidity just to move with circle almost being like a bridge of collateral and currency. So to me, that's a really big deal. I know Jupiter is doing some stuff with that, but especially for us, given that we use only USDC.
00:14:54.918 - 00:14:55.146, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:55.168 - 00:15:23.394, Speaker E: Trevor, quick question. You mentioned something about the price feeds and how you come up with those calculations based on real estate square footage. It's something I was thinking about before this pod. I wasn't sure the underlying kind of mechanism that you're using there. Is that something proprietary that you've built in house to give you these sort of price feeds on real estate? Or could you just describe kind of how that works, or break that down a bit more for us.
00:15:23.512 - 00:15:58.160, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So when we started parcel, we looked into the real estate data space. We're looking for some form of real time pricing to make a market on, and there really wasn't anything. And when you think about home price indexes, the case Shiller is kind of like the gold standard. It updates once a month on a two month lag. So we'll get, I think, August or September's reading this month. That's not good enough.
00:15:58.160 - 00:16:40.650, Speaker A: And then Zillow and Redfin have monthly price indexes that come out on a monthly cadence. Obviously, that's a month behind. So it was our view that the market gets pricing data on real estate every day. In terms of listing, when a listing is the ask price and the sale is kind of like the mid price, we don't know the offer price, but figure it's within range. So given the state of real estate data, it was a tough decision, but we just decided to make our own price feeds. So you could imagine that if a company was doing this before us, we would have used them, but it didn't. So we had to build it ourselves.
00:16:40.650 - 00:17:12.486, Speaker A: So every day we collect sales and listings. And this is under wholly. It started off it's all under parcel, but it's rebranded as parcel labs to make it two distinct things. And potentially they could be separate companies, especially if we decentralize. So every day, listings and sales come in through. I'll share my screen real quick. So this is parcel Labs homepage for one.
00:17:12.486 - 00:17:47.410, Speaker A: This is a white paper that goes into the parcel labs price feed methodology for anyone wanting to learn more. So here's the documentation for the APIs. So every day this API connects. Well, it's always connected, but it connects to the blockchain via Oracle and pulls from here. And then the output is something like this. This is Miami beach. It is currently trading at the Oracle price is $569.
00:17:47.410 - 00:17:57.202, Speaker A: The market price, because it's skewed long, is $574. And here's the three six one year chart of Miami.
00:17:57.266 - 00:18:12.140, Speaker E: I can almost assume that people would just want that data, or like this data that you're collecting if you couldn't find it anywhere else and you're kind of accruing it. Have you found it's valuable to others at all yet?
00:18:12.510 - 00:18:43.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So we've generated revenue there. I would say that it started as a technology without a business model. So we've had mainly inbounds to buy the data or use the data or cite the data. Parcel Labs was recently on CNBC where our price feed, like that price feed for the USA was shown. New York was shown. Moody's recently cited our data in their single family rental analytics report.
00:18:43.714 - 00:19:04.730, Speaker A: These are unprompted inbounds, so he's kind of continuing on with the technology roadmap. We know it's differentiated. I would say we're still finding exactly who would be interested, but we get a ton of inbounds all the time and just trying to see how the best way to distribute it.
00:19:04.800 - 00:20:17.300, Speaker B: Before we talk through some of the improvements and new features in V three, I just want to make sure we're covering the most basic user experience in parcel. So for folks that go to Parcel Co, you're basically just connecting a Salana wallet and then once you do that, you can choose any of the live markets. Because I think with V three, I'm not sure if all of those are live just yet. And anyways, if I wanted to then go long or short the price of real estate in New York, I'm simply just depositing some USDC, like with any other sort of perps market, and I'm specifying my position size with the fact that I've got some leverage available for these synthetic positions. The outcome of all this is then I'm either long or short with I think it's up to ten X leverage and that's it. At the end of the day, we're competing. It's typical sort of perps exchange PvP against everyone else in the pool there.
00:20:17.300 - 00:20:31.640, Speaker B: Actually our counterparty here. And correct me, Trevor, if I'm mischaracterizing this, but I thought the counterparty is one unified USDC pool now. So anything else to fill in there or. Correct.
00:20:32.010 - 00:21:16.598, Speaker A: That's pretty much spot on. You can get long and short prices of cities in a pretty simple manner and then USDC is really the only collateral. We're noodling on either ways to offer other things with within the parcel umbrella to on ramp a little easier. And then. Yeah, the, the. One of the key differences is the liquidity provision in this model, which is one pool versus. It was different in the prior model, player versus player with a bunch of fragmented liquidity pools for any tradable market.
00:21:16.598 - 00:21:18.946, Speaker A: So this makes it much easier and simpler.
00:21:19.058 - 00:21:44.830, Speaker B: This is hopefully going to help deepen liquidity, help to kind of bootstrap interest in trading on the platform here. While it's still rather new in terms of cross margin, we currently can add USDC. Do you think there's any chance that you'd add like liquid state Sol in the near future. Any other assets for margin?
00:21:45.410 - 00:22:31.302, Speaker A: Yeah, we're actually just sort of thinking through that this week, just given that this architecture. So this architecture is a huge shout out to synthetics. Their second version is inspired by the synthetics V two, which has done remarkably well, taking a lot of share from other players in the Ethereum perps space. But the architecture can support perps any market with a USDC price feed. Parcel Labs happens to make the real estate price feed. There's a bunch of pip price feeds. So we're experimenting in terms of, or thinking through and starting to deploy to Devnet.
00:22:31.302 - 00:23:12.730, Speaker A: Like what do sole perps look like? How would we then incorporate them into a unified experience? It obviously is attractive such that you have some stable assets as collateral and cross margin in terms of being liquidated. So there are some benefits to us. It's about product and messaging and unification of the experience. There is argument to be made that all under one view makes sense. And we obviously have a large competitive advantage in the real estate part too.
00:23:12.800 - 00:23:22.302, Speaker E: Trevor, what else would you kind of call out as major differentiators moving from V two to V three? What's top of mind for you? What kind of stands out?
00:23:22.356 - 00:24:32.414, Speaker A: Yeah, the three main items of feedback from our power users. More liquidity. There was a lot of dollars left on the sidelines because the architecture really couldn't scale more dynamic fee structure and balancing mechanisms. So we moved to funding rate that incorporates velocity, so moves faster when the SKU gets heavier and slower when the SKU is not as extreme. And then we also have a SKU scalar, we have price impact, which would be like if you are adding to a dominant side, you would pay a less favorable price. So it's almost like simulated slippage and then dollar for dollar accounting. So the V two, there was some complexities around an LP token, and that LP token had its own exchange rate based on trader PNL.
00:24:32.414 - 00:25:10.746, Speaker A: And it was just, you couldn't really understand how much you were going to make or lose, which for real traders was almost like a non deal starter or I forget that term, but a non starter. So those are the things we addressed. Now it's one liquidity pool, super simple, and then cross margin and it's a true perps platform versus. It was kind of like halfway there, I would say in B two, which was an important step because we got all the feedback.
00:25:10.858 - 00:25:34.706, Speaker E: You mentioned the term power users. I'm really curious, kind of like the makeup of users that come and use parcel. What type of users are these, what are they doing? And I guess, why are they using parcel? And if there's any specific, are they hedging things? What is the general, I guess, user archetype?
00:25:34.818 - 00:26:02.240, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty broad. You'd expect much like most markets, like the top, like it's 80 20 rules. So the majority of volume is driven by a handful of people. Some of those are like institutional type traders, some are actually people like you mentioned, own property and looking to hedge. Some are just speculating and try to make money. So it's pretty wide. And I think as liquidity grows, we'll continue to.
00:26:02.240 - 00:26:15.762, Speaker A: Those are kind of like the three archetypes that we've seen, and I think as liquidity grows, we'll try and continue to attract people within those realms.
00:26:15.906 - 00:26:35.690, Speaker B: Trevor, any more you can share about the risk enhancements that you've made? Like how have you improved the architecture of parcel to, I guess, prevent any sort of exploit or even like, I'll say, manipulation of these markets.
00:26:36.110 - 00:27:27.174, Speaker A: So we always have taken security very seriously. So everything is audited. The audit report is on our doc site docs Parcel Co. So that's kind of like standard for us in terms of risk to the pools and the counterparties. It's really like a balance between protecting LPs and having traders be able to have a good user experience. So they're mainly on the things that I mentioned. And the whole idea is to kind of try to keep markets 50 50, because if the pools are balanced 50 50, you can assume maybe traders are right half the time, and then the LPs are kind of sitting there with a 50 50 pool supporting and underwriting all the margin periods.
00:27:27.174 - 00:28:04.930, Speaker A: So that's really what I'm talking about in terms of a dynamic risk system. So one is price impact. So if you're helping SKU, you'll get a better price. If you're hurting SKU, you'll get a worse price. Much like if you were buying a stock and there wasn't supply and you wanted to get the trade on, you're going to pay a higher price. Just simple. And then funding rates, funding rate velocity such that the funding rate, there's a max funding rate that it can move per day and it speeds up on a curve.
00:28:04.930 - 00:28:38.946, Speaker A: If the SKU gets the further skew is to 100, for example, you wouldn't get there because of the price impact. But if you did, the funding rate reaches max velocity, but if it's not moving that much, it's slower. So this is the dynamic system that we've incorporated and think that it can balance pools effectively. And again, if you balance the pools, you're protecting the architecture at large in.
00:28:38.968 - 00:29:38.678, Speaker B: Terms of use cases that you can imagine or have discussed with some of the power users that you have. You've got someone like myself years ago, who didn't own a home yet. I wanted exposure to the real estate markets and I would have loved to have been able to go long the region that I was in, whether it was like a San Francisco or New York at the time. But then I've also thought a little bit about what if you're buying into a really hot, your, whatever, family, get into your first home, you actually could use parcel then to go short and hedge the fact that maybe you bought into the top of market. And then of course, I'm thinking of folks with a lot more money, folks that own commercial real estate. So I'd imagine those are your most coveted target users, hedge funds who are making bets in those real estate markets. So anyways, anything else there to share?
00:29:38.844 - 00:30:44.474, Speaker A: Yeah, the use cases are very broad. I would say almost every financial asset has some form of at least a hedging mechanism in terms of futures or options or some sort of derivative. It's interesting, real estate being the largest source of measurable wealth in the world doesn't have that. And as such, that's obviously where we see a large opportunity. I think it also has kind of like a little bit of a cross blend between institutions and retail, given that maybe corn futures are used by farmers to hedge and oil futures by airlines, but a large majority of homes are owned by retail. So that's obviously a potential hedging solution for them. While larger institutional investors can hedge on that side.
00:30:44.474 - 00:31:21.830, Speaker A: So that's on the short side. I think futures and derivatives are used to protect risk, and there's no way to protect risk in real estate, period. There's really not. And then on the long side, I think the generation that is here now, housing is very unaffordable and prices are high and rates are high, which is kind of like an interesting dynamic. Rates used to be very, a lot higher, but the prices of homes were a lot lower. So you kind of net out and it didn't matter. Now you're getting hit from both angles.
00:31:21.830 - 00:31:51.018, Speaker A: There's an option to participate in the upside, participate on the downside, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, our job is to stand up. These markets get liquidity here, and given the size of the market, the natural participants will be here. And we've seen that thus far. Just need more liquidity such that they can actually put on bets.
00:31:51.114 - 00:32:47.010, Speaker B: It's such a cool use case. I have really clearly been an admirer of what you guys are building since the beginning. It's addressing a major demand or like a need out there for folks to be able to participate in the upside, as you put it, and a lot of people are locked out of the opportunity to get exposure to real estate. There's a barrier to entry there for a lot of folks with just a down payment. This is a tool that is, I think, a great example of what DeFi is supposed to be doing. It's supposed to be enabling us to use as little as one dollars, in this case, to participate in this exact same opportunity as someone who's willing to put up millions. So I hope folks really do take a moment to look at this, even if it's something that you might not use.
00:32:47.010 - 00:33:01.542, Speaker B: I feel like it's one of those defi use cases that you keep in your war chest for when your friends are like, what's the point of the defi stuff you guys are working on or interested in? And you're like, dude, check this out. This is a really cool example.
00:33:01.676 - 00:33:18.986, Speaker E: Trevor, I actually have a quick question, just about a parcel token. I don't know if this is kind of on the roadmap at all, but just curious if you see any sort of token fitting into the parcel protocol in any way.
00:33:19.088 - 00:34:15.294, Speaker A: Yeah, it's something we've explored, and obviously we're probably happy that we've been patient there to date. The market's turning, at least for now. So we'll be watching to see how some of these other, like, if the windows open from a macro perspective, from an idiosyncratic perspective, where we have a lot of user acquisition initiatives that we're going to be focused on in the short term. One is we're partnering with asset dash starting next week to run some trading hot tests, which have been fruitful for us. And then we're going to be doing points like a point system, which has been popular on the Solana ecosystem, which is effectively a ledger for participation in the network, and then it could be used as a base potentially, if we were to decide to decentralize later.
00:34:15.412 - 00:34:30.718, Speaker B: I love that we just saw Prisma finance, which is on Ethereum mainnet, do a point system, and they've already done the retroactive airdrop jitto soul. God forgive me if I am I pronouncing that correctly? Is it Jido or Jido?
00:34:30.814 - 00:34:32.174, Speaker A: I think it's jido.
00:34:32.302 - 00:34:51.900, Speaker B: Is it Jido. I literally pronounced it two alternative ways. Yep, there we go. Yeah, Jito. They've got a point system going in a leaderboard. And it is interesting how it just makes your brain go wild. I got to catch up with Kyle Simone on there.
00:34:51.900 - 00:34:53.626, Speaker B: He's at the very top.
00:34:53.728 - 00:34:55.562, Speaker A: Yeah, he's like TEDx everyone else.
00:34:55.616 - 00:35:23.154, Speaker B: But when I first saw that point system, I was like, hold on, is it points or is that the amount of soul staked? And I mistakenly thought it was soul staked. And I was like doing the math and was like, good Lord. And then I figured out it was points and was like, oh, God. Okay, now I'm much more grounded in what that problem somewhere every two weeks. Yeah, that's right. Somewhere in between. Well, Trevor, this is a good place for us to start to wrap up.
00:35:23.154 - 00:35:36.342, Speaker B: So maybe it would be good to talk about anything else that you could foresee us looking forward to as parcel users or potential parcel users. What's coming in the next six to twelve months.
00:35:36.476 - 00:36:14.258, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mentioned one actually. Very shortly we'll be partnering with Asset Dash, which is a great dashboard for holdings and a lot of fun stuff. And they've been a great partner. So we're excited about that. We'll be launching a point system before the end of the year. Timing is within the next 45 days. And then we'll continue to roll out more markets and make a unified trading experience on the platform and then potentially more geographies to trade in kind of the first half of next year.
00:36:14.344 - 00:36:41.166, Speaker B: Well, I want to remind listeners then that they should first learn about Parcel by going to Parcel Parcl Co. And then second, they can follow Parcel on Twitter. It's just the name Parcel Parcl and there's a link there to the actual application. And then, Trevor, any other recommendations for folks who want to get involved with Parcel or learn more about it?
00:36:41.268 - 00:37:06.040, Speaker A: Twitter discord will always answer any questions there. And then if you want to follow me on. Trevor J. Bacon. Trevor J. Bacon on Twitter DMs open. If there's any questions, we're always around and we can literally manually onboard you if you have questions.
00:37:06.040 - 00:37:09.558, Speaker A: We're here to help.
00:37:09.644 - 00:37:28.570, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, hey, congrats on v three launching and really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us all about Parcel. So hopefully we can have you back in the future here when you guys have a billion dollars of liquidity and you're again building the next generation of Solana Defi.
00:37:28.910 - 00:37:33.226, Speaker A: Let's go. I'm happy to be here and thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
00:37:33.328 - 00:37:46.350, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
