00:00:00.410 - 00:00:32.390, Speaker A: So I think fundamentally because we launched Pedal V one in 2021 and it wasn't the best product, it was the fact that the product was difficult and complex. It was overwhelming for users to utilize the V one, and we recognized that. So a good part of last year was actually going back to the whiteboard to redesign the protocol, the underlying mechanics, while retaining the principal direction, which is to enable fixed rates for users in DeFi.

00:02:46.950 - 00:03:26.000, Speaker D: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs, and today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account. If we zoom out. Since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial law.
00:03:29.490 - 00:04:11.050, Speaker E: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC. And native access to instadap's powerful custom DFI strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:11.550 - 00:04:41.154, Speaker B: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce TN Lee, the co founder of Pendle Finance. He is one of the few people I can think of who have been building full time in DFI since 2017. Being a founding team member of the foundational liquidity protocol at Kyber Network, he was also an early contributor to wrapped bitcoin, the most popular form of tokenized BTC. Today, with over 4.7 billion in tokenized bitcoin liquidity on Ethereum and other l ones and l two s. So let's kick it off. Tien, welcome to the Edge podcast.
00:04:41.154 - 00:04:42.006, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:04:42.108 - 00:04:44.486, Speaker A: I'm good. Thanks for having me.
00:04:44.668 - 00:05:30.630, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a real pleasure to finally get to talk with you. Not just about Pendle, but you are one of the most OG DFI builders in the space. For folks that are newer to DFI, I think it's worth noting that Kyber is truly like one of the earliest, purest form of DFI that was being developed going back to 2017. And a lot of what we enjoy today and DFI derives from work that your team was doing back in the day. But tn do you want to share just a bit more about your journey in crypto? Like maybe what led to you getting started with Kyber and then ultimately moving over here to pendle finance?
00:05:30.970 - 00:06:23.510, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. I think along the way I got really lucky, but everything started with a research project for a professor back in 2014, and that really got me intrigued with whole cryptocurrency technology. So I remember I was tasked to look into various business models in the fintech sector. And one of the companies involved was using bitcoin to remit money from Singapore to the Philippines. And I thought that was a very, very interesting proposition to users because they were able to offer the same service at a fraction of the cost. So that had me looking deeper into the whole technology. And also, coincidentally, at that point in time, Ethereum was getting more traction.
00:06:23.510 - 00:07:07.894, Speaker A: And then I went to read up on the Ethereum white paper. I think, fast forward. I was working, like, building up the. Because I wasn't technical, and I figured I needed a way to be involved in the sector, and the only way that I could contribute was to manage communities. So I set up Ethereum Singapore Facebook community, and had to look through many different types of resources to share with the community. And so happened to come across a white paper called Oyante, which was co authored by Lloyd. Reach out to him, because he was a couple of bus stops away from me and we became friends.
00:07:07.894 - 00:08:19.826, Speaker A: And then fast forward. When he started out Kyber in 2017, we had a conversation. He asked if I'd be open to join the team to head the business development unit and the community building site, and I agreed to it. So it turned out to be one of the most pivotal decisions that I've made, because that got me started in crypto professionally, and it opened up a lot of doors for me personally to be introduced to really, really intelligent and capable people and all the different people whom have become also very important to the founding of Pendle. Eventually now. So I stayed out in Kyber until early 2019, and then following that, I decided to take a step back and really start to explore different opportunities in and out of the crypto sector. So I gathered a group of people who are now co founders of Pendle to work on a string of very unsuccessful ventures, starting with, like, mining software to farm privacy coins.
00:08:19.826 - 00:09:32.750, Speaker A: We also did something around data engineering, so that had a little bit more success, but it wasn't anything major. So 2019 2020, period. It was a relatively difficult time for us because we haven't been able to construct a product that had product market fit, and we had to figure out ways to make little money here and there to try to get through that period. And DFI Summer happened to be one of the best things to happen to us. We were farming tokens, and all this footcoins were giving out, like thousands of percent of APYs. And as much as we liked the idea of capturing all these APYs, it also occurred to us that there was no good way for us to lock in the rates, we knew that the APYs were fleeting, but there was nothing that we could do about it. And then when we contrasted what was in DeFi at that point in time to a mature financial sector, it just occurred to us that fixed rate, fixed income products are some of the most important verticals in the financial sector.
00:09:32.750 - 00:10:07.130, Speaker A: And it was largely missing in crypto. And we figured that, coming from our own perspective, that innately, because as individuals, we value certainty, and we thought that that was something that we wanted, and it was absent in crypto. And we feel that we felt that most other people other than us, would also value that product. So we decided to start ideating around the solution to offer fixed income products to the crypto sector. So that was basically, I think, the motivation of starting pendle tien.
00:10:07.210 - 00:10:14.446, Speaker B: Why do you think Defi, fixed income or fixed yield has struggled in terms of adoption?
00:10:14.558 - 00:11:43.654, Speaker A: I think in a bull market, when we introduced a product, because I think, in general, the risk appetite of most crypto natives is quite different. Most of us who are relatively native to crypto have higher tolerance for risk, and we wouldn't be too bothered about locking in, like, say, 5%, 10%, even in a bull market, especially because if you lock in 10%, you're probably missing out the opportunity to gain 20, 30%, or even 100% APY. So I think at that point in time, in a bull market, a lot of individuals would favor higher aPYs and had higher risk tolerance because those were real opportunities to generate wealth. But I think times are changing, especially now, in a relatively inactive period within crypto, to be able to lock in rates at, say, 5% happens to be quite attractive as a proposition. And beyond that, I think there is, with more capital inflow into the crypto sector, I believe that the awareness for fixed income products in a certain user's portfolio will become increasingly important again, because innately, I believe most individuals value that certainty, and I think there is a price to certainty.
00:11:43.782 - 00:12:24.086, Speaker F: Tian, I really like what you said there as far as kind of the behavior of defi actors in a bull versus a bear. I want to come back to that later because I think that's important. And I totally get what you're saying. Yeah, in the bull, there's just way more risk taking appetite, and people are almost willing to forego maybe a smaller fixed rate. But, yeah, we should definitely get into that later. But first, I kind of want to just get into pendle a little bit. In the intro, we mentioned pendle is a yield trading protocol, and in the pendle docs, you say we give users the reins to their yield.
00:12:24.086 - 00:12:28.806, Speaker F: What do you mean by that and what can we do on the Pendle protocol?
00:12:28.918 - 00:13:53.026, Speaker A: So I think yield is one of the biggest items within crypto defi and today I am of the impression that a lot of users are quite familiar with the whole notion of yield bearing assets. So for example, St ETH, Stargate, USDT, AUSDC, these are all yield bearing assets. The reason for these assets to exist in the first place is like maybe two purposes, right? Number one, it functions as a proof of deposit into a certain pool, and then secondly, it functions as a receipt for the yield that is accrued from the underlying protocol. So when the way we look at it, with all these yield bearing assets, conventionally, aside from just like the principal value, there's also the yield that is accruing all the time. And these are value that is, I mean, this is a value that is locked within the asset. So we believe that by splitting up the value coming from the yield accrued yield from the underlying asset, we can open up more opportunities for users to do more, whether it's to long or short yield, or to lock in the fixed rates.
00:13:53.138 - 00:14:26.974, Speaker B: So tien, I want to start to break down the major components that make up the pendle protocol, one of those you started to touch upon there, which is yield tokenization, that concept of principal token versus a yield token. So could we start to talk then about in terms of the yield tokenization, how do we use that as users? And I'm hoping we could start with pendle earn. I feel like that's the simplest, easiest use case for those of us who are new to the Pendle protocol.
00:14:27.102 - 00:15:46.982, Speaker A: So with regards to pendle. So pendle's source of liquidity is actually yield bearing assets. So yield bearing assets like Stargate, USDT, AUSDC, any kind of asset that generates yield when you deposit into pendle, the outcome would be one principal token and one yield token. So the principal token, in short for Pt, represents the principal component of a yield bearing asset, while the yield token, the Yt, accrues the yield that is paid up from the underlying protocol. So as an example, if the underlying protocol is lido, the YT will accrue the yield in the form of SDE. Now, these two assets, after separated, they can be traded independently of each other. So the Pt side is actually structured quite similarly to that of a zero coupon bond in which it is priced at a discount relative to the underlying, in this case the St ETH, and at maturity it can be redeemed for the underlying par, and then, on the other hand, the yield token, YT will continue to accrue interest or the yield that is paid off from the underlying protocol.
00:15:46.982 - 00:16:28.626, Speaker A: It realizes it as and when the yield is paid out, and then at maturity, it will become zero dollar in value, because by then it will no longer accrue any kind of yield. So this is, I think, a very important relationship between the YT and Pt that we need to establish. And ultimately, right with pendle, one pt, the value of one Pt plus the value of one Yt has to equal to the value of one under light. And in this case, because of this entire relationship, Pt and Yt are inversely related. Meaning to say, if Pt price goes up, YT price has to come down, or vice versa.
00:16:28.738 - 00:17:20.882, Speaker B: One of the more popular pools on Pendle has been the staked ETH pools. And so you have different maturities depending on when folks watch this. Hopefully they're watching this long into the future. But given that we're midway through 2023, we have maturity dates that take us out to the end of 2023 and then out even further. Like, let's say almost a year or year and a half. And so if I were to go to the pendle earn application, and I've got one staff, and I want to earn a fixed rate with that staff, can you explain, when I use pendle earn, what happens under the hood? Am I buying Pt tokens or are we minting Pt and yt?
00:17:21.026 - 00:17:23.766, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I should have gone.
00:17:23.948 - 00:17:31.806, Speaker B: No, no, don't worry. I was just struggling last night to think about how to ask you that question. So much harder to actually answer the.
00:17:31.828 - 00:18:15.846, Speaker A: Question pendle earn is actually, I think it will help to give a bit more context as to why we construct pendle earn. Because when we started out panda v two, end of last year, right, we know the product is complex. So that means we need to do something about the UI. Ux. And the initial implementation for v two involves a simple UI and a pro UI. So the pro UI is like what you're seeing right now on the trade page. Simple UI has already been replaced by pedalearn, but the simple UI, at that point in time, when it was out, the narrative around it was actually to buy asset at a discount.
00:18:15.846 - 00:19:11.966, Speaker A: How it works is basically users buy PT like zero coupon and then hold it until maturity and then redeem it. Par for the underlying. So that's kind of how it works. So you buy, for example, $0.95 for USDC, and then immaturity you redeem the full USDC at one point, and that's the five cent difference is your gain. So we realize a couple of things when we have the simple Ui with the asset at the discount as the narrative. Two things, right? The first observation is that when we have asset at the discount, the natural follow up question is, where does the discount come from? And then we realize that we have to go through the whole relatively complex explanation of how panda works.
00:19:11.966 - 00:20:36.678, Speaker A: And then secondly, which is a very important one, is that crypto community is a lot more familiar with the whole concept of apy versus discount, because one involves putting money in and then at some point in time further down, you take more money out, whereas like asset at a discount is you put less money in and then at maturity you take the full amount out. Structurally, maybe from perspectives, different perspectives, they are somewhat similar, but framing wise, they are very different. So we decided to drop that narrative, prime it as an earned product, structure it like a fixed deposit that I think a lot of users are familiar with, and really try to minimize the learning curve. So with panelearn at the back of it, it's basically just users buying the principal token and then holding it until maturity and redeem it for the underlying, for the fixed game. So it is really as simple as that. But how the yields, the percentage of yield is derived is a result of the yield trading that happens on the other side, again, because PT, YT are inversely related. So when PT, these two cannot, they have to exist together.
00:20:36.678 - 00:21:14.942, Speaker A: It's just that when the demand for PT increases, there will be opportunities for YT because the price of YT has to come down. So this is where the traders can come in, speculate on the yield token. And then, yeah, if traders think that there is a potential for the yield token to grow even more in value in the coming three months, six months or so, then they can express a view there by buying the YT. And as a result of that, it changes the implied yield, which determines the fixed rates.
00:21:15.086 - 00:21:57.118, Speaker F: Tian that trader part is super interesting, too, and something I also want to get into a bit more. I've been seeing on crypto Twitter some of these like the greatest trades ever done on Pendle. We definitely want to ask you about those, but I want to ask you kind of about another component of Pendle. So we've talked about earn, we've talked about the yield tokenization, but I guess after those steps are done, what happens on the pendle amm, how do people provide liquidity to it? And what sort of I guess yields. And where are those yields coming from to the liquidity providers on the pendle amm?
00:21:57.214 - 00:23:04.130, Speaker A: So in terms of the yield, I think I'll start with the yield first. So the yield for liquidity providers, it's composed of multiple sources. So again, I think taking Stargate USDT as an example. So when a user deposits Stargate USDT into pendle, the pendle amm actually has some sort of a module to tabulate the reward that is made up from the underlying protocol, which in this case is Stargate. So as a liquidated provider, the user is entitled to Stargate SDG, reward, the lending APY from Stargate, and then on top of that, the pendle incentives and the fixed yield within the fixed yield of the PT component and the swap fees. So collectively, there are multiple sources of yield. And that results, like the stacking of yield, makes it more appealing for liquidity providers to deposit asset into the pendlet pool.
00:23:04.130 - 00:23:47.560, Speaker A: Now, how it's done is actually pretty straightforward. It's just like any other amm pool, like uniswap or Trader Joe. Deposit asset mean, first of all, I go to the page, right? And then select the pool. Like again, in this case, Stargate USDT, choose the maturity of choice and then deposit the asset. In this case, you could deposit something as close to the close to the asset in consideration, like USDT. Or if you have only ether, you can deposit ether, but it will have to be swapped to USDT first before it gets deposited into the pool. So we allow for the zap in option.
00:23:47.560 - 00:24:27.722, Speaker A: And then, importantly, I think for traders or users with a more sizable position, it helps to select the zero price impact mode when they provide liquidity into the pool. Because in some sense, the zero price impact mode takes away the swapping involved into the pool and mint the YT and PT, pair them up in proportion, and then add the assets into the pool. Zep in is probably the simpler way to do it. I basically went through the very manual steps.
00:24:27.866 - 00:25:29.970, Speaker B: Yeah, TM, that's what I'm wondering is for those who are newer who then move beyond pendle earn, what are the more popular strategies? So I know I was personally looking at whether to zap into one of these pools. Like, I was looking at one of the steth pools that, let's say the one that expires in December 2023. And I was thinking, all right, I could provide yield with my steth, plus the, would it be the PT token that I'm ultimately holding? Actually, let's just talk about that. If I was going to zap into one of the pools. What happens under the hood and what am I ultimately exposed to? Because I think the goal for many is to remain exposed to the underlying asset. In this example, it's staff. So they're just wanting to earn more Steth or more ETH.
00:25:29.970 - 00:25:41.500, Speaker B: At the end of the day, can they do that by getting into an LP like that? Or is there some sort of risk that they could walk away with less ETH than what they started?
00:25:41.870 - 00:26:48.314, Speaker A: So with regards to the example, so say a user has staff asset, right? And the easiest way I think any user can participate in pendle to earn APY is to become a liquidity provider. So the way to go about it is to look at the pool and the duration of choice and then deposit St ETH into the pool. So what happens at the back is St ETH will a portion of it, let's say 50 50, right? So it's a 50 50 pool. And the pool will consist of two assets. First is the principal token of St ETH, and then the second asset is St ETH, but wrapped in the EIP 5115 format. So we call this like the super composable yield or short for, in short, like Sy token format. So Pt again, Pt St ETH again, it's st ETH in Sy token format.
00:26:48.314 - 00:27:53.598, Speaker A: So when you deposit St ETH into the pool, half of that gets converted, traded against the pool and gets converted into PT, and then the other half remains as ETH, but wrapped into Sy, paired together and then deposited into the pool. Now, I think because the assets PT is a derivative of the ST ETH, they are very, very highly correlated. And from our studies, because of the high correlation of the assets in the pool. So in general, the impermitted loss of the assets of becoming an LP is actually quite negligible. And importantly, right, because PT at maturity can be redeemed for the underlying par. So at maturity, all the assets in the pool will actually have the same value. So fundamentally, right, if you are a liquidity provider and you deposit asset into the pool and you hold it until maturity, you will have zero impermanent loss.
00:27:53.598 - 00:28:15.398, Speaker A: And I think this is one of the more important points for user. So if you're comfortable with 2024 pool, for example, since you already long ETH and then depositing into the 2024 pool, hold it until maturity just for additional APY could be quite attractive.
00:28:15.494 - 00:28:58.294, Speaker F: Tn I want to ask you just about some of these trades I mentioned earlier, and I don't know if you're familiar with this one, but I'll lay it out for you. So the one I saw, was it involved? Like, I think it was about $10,000 worth of capital earning yield on a $320,000 position. And honestly, I read the tweet and I still don't know if I fully understand it, but just wondered if you could maybe lay out a bit of what was happening there at a high level way and maybe describe kind of that opportunity that may exist for other opportunistic traders or users of Pendle. Yeah, just walk us through that.
00:28:58.412 - 00:29:42.418, Speaker A: Of course, yeah. So again, let's go back to the relationship between PT and YT and the underlying. So one PT plus one YT has to equal to the value of one underlying, so effectively, right, let's just say that in this case, the underlying is I'm going to use like us dollar because it's easiest to represent. So the underlying is $1.01 USDC, for example, and the published yield is 5%. So the YT price should be, for simplicity's sake, five cents. And then as a result of that, the PT is $0.95.
00:29:42.418 - 00:30:52.030, Speaker A: So $0.95 plus five cents to a dollar, so effectively, right, because of the nature of YT, it represents a much smaller part of a yield bearing asset. And because of that, right, say a five and a half e yield exposure is actually representing a much bigger notional amount. Just imagine, right, if you have, like, a dollar, you can now buy 20 yts of 5%. So with 20 yts, you're effectively getting an implied leverage of 20 types. Right? So this is why with the strategy that you mentioned, even though the initial amount is only maybe around ten grand, it represents a notional value of 300 something thousand dollars. Because yt is a much smaller component of a yield bearing asset.
00:30:52.030 - 00:31:20.770, Speaker A: Yeah. And the same amount of capital gives you a much bigger lever. And this is very different from taking a levered position at other values, because here you are actually just buying the yield component of a yield bearing asset. So this is a spot transaction. There is no margin account involved, and this sort of implied leverage basically means that you cannot be liquidated.
00:31:20.930 - 00:32:28.246, Speaker B: Do you think you could address challenges with balancing YT and PT, given the fact that YT is so much more? I'm trying to think of what's the best way to say this, like campus will efficient. Yeah. What fascinated me with YT is that you can buy for an insignificant amount of money relative to what the PT is, and you can ultimately capture that yield. And I think I'm probably not doing the best job of it. I think what I'm saying frames up why that trade was so epic, that someone used such a smaller amount of money and is now earning yield, in this case on a $300,000 position instead. So it's getting leverage without the risk of liquidation. It's getting leverage on yield, which is really just not available in other forms.
00:32:28.246 - 00:32:32.574, Speaker B: In DeFi, this is a very unique use case.
00:32:32.772 - 00:33:58.642, Speaker A: Sure. I think this is definitely one of the more unique propositions of Pendle, because as a trader who intends to speculate on the yield movement, I think Pendle is probably one of the most capital efficient ways to do it. And in regards to this particular aspect that you brought up, we have actually, after speaking with some of our bigger users, one of the common feedback is they find it very difficult to do the YT trade in bigger size. So again, because let's say like a 20K worth of YT represents maybe three hundred k, four hundred k of the underlying, if they were to do, say, fifty k of YT trade size, it's going to represent a much bigger notional value. And that means the price impact that they would incur is going to be quite significant, because it's going to take up a pretty sizable portion of the liquidity pool. So here, I think there is a limitation to how much the AMm can process without incurring the price impact. And we are keenly aware that this is potentially a bottleneck for the pendant protocol, because it kind of inhibits more sophisticated traders from trading in bigger sizes.
00:33:58.642 - 00:34:27.978, Speaker A: So moving forward, this is going to be one of the areas that we need to improve on, and the trading experience is going to be prioritized. So one of the features that we will be releasing in the coming quarters would be an RFQ limit order system to allow users to put up the YT orders and the price that they are willing to execute the transaction for.
00:34:28.084 - 00:34:35.298, Speaker B: Oh, that's really interesting. That's exciting. Do you know how soon that might release? You were saying in the coming months or so.
00:34:35.464 - 00:34:46.598, Speaker A: Yeah. So timeline wise, I think it would be premature for me to indicate any concrete timeline, but this is definitely one of the features that we're more excited about.
00:34:46.764 - 00:35:04.430, Speaker B: Just to take a step back from that, can you dumb down for us? Where does the liquidity for buying yield tokens come from? If we were going to long the yield token, this like Degen trade that we've talked about, the one that this person executed.
00:35:05.090 - 00:35:05.550, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:05.620 - 00:35:09.262, Speaker B: Where again does that yield? Or where again, does that liquidity come from?
00:35:09.396 - 00:36:38.262, Speaker A: Yeah. So the liquidity is also coming from the same pool, the PT against the sy, the underlying. So here I think one of the more important innovations that we've introduced to pendlev two is to consolidate the liquidity to one pool and at the same time enable the trading of PT and YT. So effectively we can do without the YT pool because of the inverse relationship between PT and YT. So for again, if there is a demand for YT, what happens at the back of it is there's going to be a flash swap to borrow some assets from the pool to mint Yt or burn Yt for the transaction. So if I want to buy YT, I will trade against the same pool. But because the pool currently does not have any YT in place, the pool will have to mint Yt by using the amount that I deposited mint Yt, and then give me the proportional amount of YT that I'm entitled to based on the amount that I've input, and then the rest of the PT that is minted as a result, as a byproduct of the intention to purchase Yt gets deposited back into the pool.
00:36:38.262 - 00:37:16.418, Speaker A: So this process, I think is a little more difficult to explain without visual aid, but I'm just going to keep it as that. So the liquidity pool is the same and it's again more capital efficient compared to the V. One implementation where it takes place is also on the trade page on pandal app. So if a user goes to the application, there will be two columns on the right. One indicates Pt, the other one indicates YT. So click on the YT button and the user will be directed to the page to swap the YT.
00:37:16.514 - 00:37:28.294, Speaker F: One component we haven't talked about yet that I think we should touch on is vpendel and how it's utilized within the protocol. Can you maybe discuss this boosting mechanism?
00:37:28.422 - 00:38:15.862, Speaker A: Pendle, as the native asset, does not have any kind of utility, but it can be locked up for Vendel and the locking duration is anywhere between one week and two years. So with Vendel there are three utilities. The first is as a yield booster. So for example, if you're a liquidity provider within Pendle and you have a vpeaddle position, you are entitled to some yield boosting, and the yield boosting factor goes as high as two and a half times. That's first. And then secondly, as a ve panel holder, you are entitled to folds of the incentive emissions. So every week there is a budget that can be utilized for liquidity incentive.
00:38:15.862 - 00:39:03.750, Speaker A: So you as a fee panel holder can decide on the distribution of the emission to the pool of your choice. And the third is as a claim to the protocol revenue. And this protocol revenue is not that immediate. As a vpedal holder, you would have to vote for a certain pool to be entitled to the portion of the protocol revenue. So, for example, I vote for the ST E's pool. And the amount of revenue that the ST E's pool accrues gets distributed back to me only after I've voted.
00:39:03.910 - 00:39:35.940, Speaker F: I think this segues kind of nicely into something I've been seeing play out. If people are familiar with the defiwars XYZ site, that's a great site, you should go check it out. But we've seen these protocols emerge. One's called equilibria, the other one's called penpi, and they seem to be buying up large amounts of the pendle token. I think last time I checked, they collectively owned around 51 or 52% of the pendle token. Why are they doing this?
00:39:36.550 - 00:40:58.074, Speaker A: So I think with the vpendel, that presents an opportunity for new protocols to be built on top. I think, on the one hand, it's definitely. There is a group of users who wish to provide liquidity to the protocol, but don't necessarily want the token exposure, because in order to get boosted reward, they would have to lock up pendle for a duration in order to get maybe a maximum two and a half times booster. Right? But some trading shops might not be ready for that, because they just want the maximum yield without the token exposure. And then on the other hand, there's a group of pendle token holders who want to generate more apy on the pendle. So here, these protocols, like equilibrium penpi, they are basically created to enable these two types of needs to cater to each other. So on the one hand, they aggregate more users who are pedal holders for them to deposit into the protocol.
00:40:58.074 - 00:41:32.082, Speaker A: And then on the other hand, they can function as protocol for liquidity provisions with added benefits because of the pedal that they have accrued. And then collectively, I think this is one of the ecosystems that we are currently cultivating, because ultimately, they provide a lot of benefits to the Pendle protocol, and they have also contributed quite a sizable amount of TVL to pendle protocol.
00:41:32.226 - 00:42:35.918, Speaker B: Tien. I want to reflect now on the insane growth that Pendle has had this year. So, since January 1, 2023, I was looking back at the total value locked on Pendle was around 15 million in US dollars. And that has ten x in the last six to seven months. To 150,000,000. And then, even if we measure that in ETH, given the fact that crypto has done actually relatively well this year, in 2023, it's seven x up in terms of valuing that in ETH, what do you attribute to this success? When we started the bear market, you were still struggling with product market fit, as we noted, with DFI, fixed yields, and now there seems to be a very active user base. There's a very engaged community there, a community that's very vocal, too, about how valuable this utility is.
00:42:35.918 - 00:42:42.318, Speaker B: So what is it? What's the magic sauce in what you've all done here in the past year and a half?
00:42:42.484 - 00:44:07.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think there is a lot of magic involved, but definitely a lot of luck. So I think fundamentally, because we launched pedal V one in 2021 and it wasn't the best product, put it this way, we receive a lot of feedback, and most of the time it's very consistent. It was the fact that the product was difficult and complex, and it was overwhelming for users to utilize the V one, and we recognized that. So a good part of last year was actually going back to the whiteboard to redesign the protocol, the underlying mechanics, while retaining the principal direction, which is to enable fixed rates for users in Defi. So, having that in mind, we spend a lot of time to think about how to optimize the AMM, the UX, and also, like the logger roadmap that we wanted to construct. So with the launch of Pendle V two, other than the product, we also experimented a number of different narratives. So I think like being ready to accept that some things just don't necessarily work out the way we intend to.
00:44:07.706 - 00:45:19.858, Speaker A: That mindset is quite important, especially in the bear market, because a lot of times we experiment with things and we are ready to accept that they will not always work out, and we're okay with that. So with that said, with the different types of narratives, we attempted, for example, asset at a discount, that wasn't that successful. And then we also attempted to associate our brand with apecoin by launching an apecoin compounder and also an apecoin market on pandal, that was okay. But after a while, with fading up the hype around apecoin, we also saw, like, dwindling activity in the pool, and similarly for looks rare as well. And then where we were trading at like $10 billion in FTV, we were seeding the low cap gem narrative. And with some influencers, we also pitched the idea of the potential of yield trading in crypto by comparing to the interest rate swap market in Trentfi. But effectively, I think these didn't work out.
00:45:19.858 - 00:46:12.254, Speaker A: The ones that stood out after several attempts was actually lsdfi. So we figured out ways to insert ourselves into that whole narrative. And basically we provided the venue for users to express a view on the ETH staking yield. And this was all before the Shanghai fork. So we were able to capitalize on the hype around this particular narrative and then work with partners like Aura, Balancer, rocket pool to establish pools that really allowed users to express a view. So that was like our first breakthrough, I think. And then of course with GLP, we saw even more traction because there's always been a very core trader community within GMX.
00:46:12.254 - 00:46:33.050, Speaker A: And then given that the rate refreshes once a week, we offer the venue for the traders to long or short GMX yield. So I think we have been very fortunate to be able to capture some of these trends and build on top of these.
00:46:33.200 - 00:47:53.330, Speaker B: I will say I do not think there is any luck involved here. I think you abstracted away the complexity of the protocol. This is something that, as someone who was following Pendle from a distance, and I had written up at least one or two tutorials, probably for the defiant at the time. When I came back to the application and I started seeing all the changes made, like long discounted tokens, I was like, whoa, that just dumbs down all of the other complexity that I had spent time trying to understand. And if you look at similar protocols, I won't call them out here, but there's lots of other protocols that are using this PtYT approach who are still struggling for adoption, and I'm guessing they're going to start to emulate some of what you guys have found success in also, too. It's the usual story of it looks like overnight success to everyone else, but you dig in and you go, hold on, so this guy has been building in the space since 2016, 2017. I'm betting there's others on the team who have such long roots in this space, and it matters that you've lived through multiple cycles.
00:47:53.330 - 00:48:51.670, Speaker B: You knew what to expect this bear market. You knew to start to listen to those users and identify the trends that you could build off of and even the LST narrative. Sure, I think we're all grateful for the excitement around LSTs, but I think you've clearly contributed to that and you found a way to not fight that trend and hook onto it, given the fact that you all were offering pools already related to Steph. But it feels so much smarter the way I've seen you frame it up on Twitter and then educate power users, Kols influencers who are actually talking about the protocol. But this is probably a great place for us to wrap up. I want to remind listeners that first off, they should go to pendle finance. It's the best place to learn about Pendle.
00:48:51.670 - 00:49:47.990, Speaker B: One of the really cool things is if you go into the documentation, they have a pendle yield trading handbook that is so helpful. I've learned so much about the different PT strategies and the yield token strategies that we talked about here today. I also want to remind folks that they should go and they should follow TN on Twitter at TN underscore Pendle. More importantly, follow Pendle underscore Phi tien. I want to give you the last word then here, normally we wrap up with some alpha from our guests, and I'll leave it up to you. Is there any sort of alpha related more to the roadmap for Pendle that you'd be willing to share or. I think it'd be very timely to also highlight what might be your favorite strategy on Pendle, or maybe a strategy that is less appreciated.
00:49:48.670 - 00:51:02.430, Speaker A: I think in terms of strategy, my favorite one is super vanilla, and that's basically just LP into a pool of an asset that I think highly of. And for me particularly, it's the ETH, because it's liquid. And I think it will continue to be the most dominant ETH LSD in the space with regards to the roadmap, too many. But we will continue to push out product features. So beyond just looking at user experience simplification, we also have tools that can help improve the trading activity. So I think, simply put right, pendle earn is part one, because Pendle earn is the PT aggregator and it's a module to help with the distribution of PT to as many venues as we can. And then we need another site that automates the trading so that the relationship between PT and YT can remain balanced.
00:51:02.430 - 00:51:46.400, Speaker A: And then, of course, we have also announced that we are going on to mental and optimism. We have been fortunate to have gotten the optimism grant, so we'll have to deploy on optimism in less than a month. So that's something that we're also very much looking forward to. Just one more thing. Right. I think this is something a bit more personal. I feel that whatever traction that we've gotten today, 100% of that actually is a result of the team members that we have.
00:51:46.400 - 00:52:37.530, Speaker A: I can't take credit for the learn page that you mentioned. I think it's a very good product to help with the education, but I didn't come up with that idea. Someone else in the team who is bright enough and bold enough to run with this and we thought it's a good idea, so we decided to go with it. And turns out it's a really fantastic piece of educational material. And similarly, I think for many other features that we have incorporated into Pendle, it's a result of team. I think as a figure ahead of the pedal protocol, I tend to get a lot more credit, but at some point in time, at some times I wish I can also pass on that to my teammates.
00:52:37.690 - 00:53:20.382, Speaker B: Tien, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. There's no doubt folks will probably sense we spent a lot of time thinking about how to walk through this protocol. It's a challenge because of the complexity of it, but if you go to pendle finance, I think that's the beauty of the application, especially the simpler version of the application. It just dumbs it all down, walks you through, asks you questions along the way, provides lots of FAQs. So per usual, I'd say the best way to learn is actually by clicking around or potentially using the application yourself. So anyways, thanks so much tien. Thanks everyone for tuning in.
