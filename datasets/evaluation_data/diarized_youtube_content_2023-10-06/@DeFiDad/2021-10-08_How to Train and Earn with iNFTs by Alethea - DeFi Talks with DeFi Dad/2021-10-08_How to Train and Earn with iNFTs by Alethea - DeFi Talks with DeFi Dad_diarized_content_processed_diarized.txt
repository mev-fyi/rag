00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.690 - 00:00:35.298, Speaker B: Okay? Hey, everyone, it's Thursday, October 7, 2021. This is DFI talks with DFI dad. Although I think today will feel a little like science fiction. I have the founder CEO here from Alethea, AI RF Khan. RF is going to talk to me about their platform that's going live today way. So they've been developing what we call, or we abbreviate as infts. It stands for intelligent NFTs.
00:00:35.298 - 00:01:12.306, Speaker B: There's been a few fun examples. We've previously interviewed a stoner cat brought to life with AI, artificial intelligence. So you can interact and ask questions and the AI will talk back to you and have some really clever remarks. But we're going to talk about this train to earn model, which has some parallels to play to earn, if you're familiar with Axie infinity. And yeah, we're going to do our best to sort of show this all off because you got to see it to believe it. So anyways, RF, welcome to the show. Congrats on the platform.
00:01:12.306 - 00:01:15.300, Speaker B: Going live here in I guess like an hour or so.
00:01:16.390 - 00:01:48.720, Speaker C: No, it's good to be here. Defaider, thank you for having me on the show and I'm really excited to share this with your viewers and the community that you've built. We're excited to launch Noah's Arc today, which is an intelligent metaverse comprised of hundreds, thousands, millions, and soon billions of infts that are going to be interacting with each other, that are going to be training each other, that are going to be growing with each other in intelligence. And today is day one.
00:01:50.450 - 00:02:33.760, Speaker B: I was originally thinking that you could give some background to this, but can we just start sharing screens? Because this is an insanely cool thing once you see it. And the takeaway today, thankfully, is this is all about people just getting educated on how this works. There's follow up steps to next week. So in other words, although these are infts are like NFTs, you can buy and sell them. That's coming next week and we'll sort of explain what those next steps are. So just like, sit back and enjoy this. There's nothing you need to rush to mint today.
00:02:33.760 - 00:02:39.166, Speaker B: All right. So anyways, I'll add your stream here. There we go.
00:02:39.348 - 00:02:41.278, Speaker C: Can you see the coming soon sign?
00:02:41.444 - 00:02:46.386, Speaker B: Yes. There we go. So this is Alethea AI. If anyone wants to check it out.
00:02:46.408 - 00:04:00.822, Speaker C: Here, it's going to go live in 35 minutes, but we'll give your audience a sneak peek. So what you see here on the screen is Noah's arc, which is an intelligent metaverse a metaverse which is evolving, which has an AI engine at its core, but has also very strong decentralized mechanics and economics to ensure that the metaverse actually bends and moves towards the orientation of decentralization and freedom. Right. So what's really interesting about Noah's ark is that it's a perfect metaphor for apes, punks, penguins, all the animals in the world that we know, and also humans, to be on this arc, but also be able to interact and talk and engage with each other. Just like we have this memetically ingrained in our consciousness. We can also now launch an arc that represents all of the NFTs that are out there and actually upgrade them into intelligent NFTs. So I'm going to walk your community through this idea, but does this make sense so far? Noah's Ark is an intelligent metaverse.
00:04:00.822 - 00:04:16.800, Speaker C: We aim to preserve and evolve the culture, stories and collective intelligence of the human species. And we're going to essentially upgrade all NFTs and provide them an opportunity to become infts. It's going to be an open, permissionless platform that allows anyone to do that.
00:04:17.570 - 00:04:49.186, Speaker B: Yeah. So for anyone that owns a board, ape or a penguin or whatever, you will soon be able to basically buy like a personality, which we're going to call a pod here. And then you can start to bring that to life. And then we'll talk through the steps here of what it means to actually train that inft. But, yeah, RF, keep going. Walk us through what do you basically need to know here or what should you start to explore today?
00:04:49.308 - 00:05:30.210, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So the site is live and folks can go in and once they click create, what they'll see is this beautiful carousel of characters and infts that are. Today they are on Testnet, but next week they will be live on openC. And there are two types of infts here. There are original, pretrained infts. These are 100 infts of historical open IP characters that we have developed. So, for example, Mumtaz Mahal is the person who inspired the creation of one of India's really beautiful, actually one of the most profoundly beautiful pieces of architecture in the world, the Taj Mahal.
00:05:30.210 - 00:06:04.786, Speaker C: And so her last name is Mahal. Right? So Muntaz is an open IP character, a character from history that we have brought to life as an inft, as an intelligent NFT. In essence, she has an NFT and she also has an intelligence level. Forgive the slight noise in the background, no worries to the noise of. So, so, yeah, so she has an intelligence level three that means she can offer some AI services, and I'll come to that shortly. But you can see this carousel. You can go through all of the characters of history.
00:06:04.786 - 00:07:12.150, Speaker C: So we have Dracula, Mumtaz, Mehal, we have these original infts that we have created from Aletheia's standpoint, just like we created the first inft called Alice, for example, this was the first inft that we sold for almost half a million dollars on Sotheby's almost six months ago. We took the technology that we've developed over the past two years, and we essentially have now been able to scale it out to serve hundreds, if not thousands, and soon millions of characters and use cases that can be brought to life as infts. So what we did with Alice on Sotheby's, we can now do on Noah's arc. And so when you go here and you see Mumtaz, she is an original IP character. But infts are not just restricted to what Alethya creates. You can also take an existing asset that you own. So let's say you own a board ape, and you'd like to bring that board ape to life, right? And we had a wonderful conversation with the folks at Yuga Labs who are responsible for creating some of the coolest IP in the world that's completely decentralized and ground up.
00:07:12.150 - 00:07:44.350, Speaker C: In this case, the board ape belongs to a friend of the project, G Money, and also a token holder in the Alita ecosystem. And so G money wanted his ape to have a certain personality. So on the right, you'll see that the board ape has a certain personality and style. It has an intelligence level. You'll notice it has a higher level of intelligence than, let's say, Mumtaz. And that's because we've trained the board ape a little bit more and given it the opportunity to perform services. So I'll contrast these two examples just so that it's clear.
00:07:44.350 - 00:08:26.042, Speaker C: Once you select an inft, you're then able to basically go into this area called AI services. But just before that, I want to do one quick browse of the carousel to show the breadth of the infts that we have on the site. So we have Aladdin, Julius Caesar, Darwin, Hercules. So if you think of fiction and nonfiction, right? Like, if you think of all of the characters that exist in our memory and imagination, they're all being brought to life, they're all breathing in Noah's Ark, they're all ready to interact with you. Zeus, Karl Marx. In case you want to brush up on the communist manifesto. Thomas Edison, in case you want to talk to him about his inventions.
00:08:26.042 - 00:08:55.430, Speaker C: Nikola Tesla, his intelligence structured, and him being able to converse. From his perspective. Genghis Khan is a little bit controversial, I'd say, just because from the perspective of the violence he inflicted. But we felt that this would be an important statement for people to be able to interact with a character like this so that the history books do not forget as well. Right. And then, of course, we have scientists and inventors like Isaac Newton, Freud, Michelangelo, your favorite stoner cat. Do you remember this guy? Defi dead.
00:08:55.930 - 00:09:36.290, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I had so much fun talking to the inft of Reggie. But this concept of bringing back historical figures, this is something we've talked about for quite some time, that infts aren't just like a parlor trick. There is this sort of coming revolution where you can suddenly bring back to life historical figures and have conversations with them and maybe even over. As you train them more and more, this then becomes someone that you can speak to, like any.
00:09:36.440 - 00:09:37.274, Speaker C: So it's.
00:09:37.342 - 00:10:07.518, Speaker B: There's some really wild implications to this. Think about Disney characters, all sorts of stuff like that. That's fun. But I think the historical figures here is really. I'm wondering, Marie Curie, if that AI can be trained enough in the future. Can Marie Curie then start to contribute as an AI to future chemistry research? There's some, again, really wild implications to this.
00:10:07.684 - 00:10:33.254, Speaker C: No, absolutely. You're 100% right. And this is where the AI services come in, and I'll walk you through that shortly. But, yeah, there's a tremendous diversity of fictional, nonfictional characters, historical characters, all brought to life on Noah's Ark. Noah's ark is this connective tissue, this intelligent metaverse, where all of these infts can be brought to life. Right? So, yes, if you want to brush up on real politics, actually, how about.
00:10:33.292 - 00:10:40.390, Speaker B: Could we talk to one of these? Because I'll let you know if the sound isn't working. But it seemed to be working earlier.
00:10:43.230 - 00:11:35.098, Speaker C: Before we talk to one of these, I just want to show you, what exactly can they do when you select an inft like intelligence level three inft like Mumtaz. What happens is Mumtaz is able to offer some services because she has an intelligence level just like a child, all the way to an adult. We grow in intelligence. As we learn new information and learn new knowledge, our brain tissue expands and our capacity to memorize, our capacity to regurgitate information, our capacity to make intelligent analysis or articulate thoughtful ideas, it matures hopefully, as we get more educated a long time. Right? And so just like Mumtaza's intelligence level is a level three, she is able to offer certain services. She's able to recite. That means if you give her a voice, if you give her a command, if you give her a specific audio file, she's able to recite that file back to you.
00:11:35.098 - 00:12:24.346, Speaker C: She's able to broadcast a video message very similar to, let's say, cameo.com. If you wanted to type a broadcast message to her, you can essentially do that and she'll broadcast this message out to you into the world. Right? So imagine if your inft becomes super famous and it's a famous celebrity or famous broad ape, you're going to get a lot of requests to say happy birthday to people, to wish them really good things for their special occasions. Right? And then there's like a third level here, which is interact, which requires a higher level of intelligence. This is real time interactivity. Can you take Mumtaz and can you have a real time conversation with her that's intelligent, that's somewhat interactive, and that allows people to actually communicate in real time with a historical figure, just like you'd communicate in real time with a human. Right, so this is what intelligence level can do, but at a higher intelligence level.
00:12:24.346 - 00:13:10.150, Speaker C: And I'll show you what the ape can do that Mumtaz cannot, which is a little bit comical and ironic when I say that. But Mumtaz today cannot participate in intelligence mining because her inft has not yet been trained to reach the level of the intelligence mining. Intelligence mining is something where you, as an inft, can battle and interact with another inft. That means you're not just an inft talking to another human, you're an inft talking to another inft. And this sort of, like, interconnectivity is going to be extremely critical for the emergence of this shared intelligence network which we're building on Noah's arc. So these are the services. Three services, if I can summarize, that Mumtas can offer as a level three inft.
00:13:10.150 - 00:13:22.739, Speaker C: She can recite, she can broadcast, she can interact. Just to test it out, let's try broadcasting. Right? So type broadcast and say, hey, d five. I don't know whether she know how to pronounce Defi Ted, because it's no.
00:13:22.739 - 00:13:24.586, Speaker B: No, that's a yes. She'll say defi.
00:13:24.618 - 00:13:38.434, Speaker C: That's okay. Looking really good today. I love the beard. Keep it and draw it no matter what the people say. Okay. Something like that. Right.
00:13:38.434 - 00:13:54.630, Speaker C: So sorry. That's my creativity. So within a matter of a minute or two, you'll have her video. I hope the sound travels through but you'll have a video generated by Mumtaz's inft that would allow. That would essentially have her be able.
00:13:54.700 - 00:14:01.770, Speaker A: Hey, dad, you're looking really good today. I love the beard. Keep it and grow it no matter what the people say.
00:14:01.920 - 00:14:03.866, Speaker C: Okay. Were you able to get that by any?
00:14:04.048 - 00:14:13.678, Speaker B: Yeah, you can hear it very clearly. Obviously there's limitations to streamyard that we use, but no, it sounded crystal clear.
00:14:13.844 - 00:14:14.462, Speaker C: Wow.
00:14:14.596 - 00:14:39.926, Speaker B: Yeah. And again, there's a part of this that is just fun. And obviously being able to bring an inft to life or have them speak to you is really interesting. But I think think about the board ape. It's a static image that we look at. We all love our board apes. They're really cool.
00:14:39.926 - 00:15:17.550, Speaker B: They give us access to a great community. But this just adds so much more to that and basically over know if step one is I need some nft or I need to buy an already trained inft. Step two is giving it a personality. So this is coming next week. You would be able to buy these pods or personalities. So then I could bring something that's static like a board ape to life. And then step three is training it because that board ape will develop its own personality.
00:15:17.550 - 00:15:49.402, Speaker B: It's not like we don't have to lean on historical figures here where there's like a history and basically the AI can learn that history eventually represent, I guess, what is the true personality of someone who once lived. The board apes themselves could have their own stories to tell. And eventually too, a board ape could potentially even, let's say, manage a defi portfolio. So there's again, all sorts of just crazy shit that you can think of.
00:15:49.536 - 00:16:23.078, Speaker C: I like to say that intelligence is going to be the greatest rarity trait, right? And if you look at the way that these NFTs today are static images, like you've correctly pointed out, once you imbue them with intelligence, there is this whole universe that opens up. And so now Mumtaz can not just recite or broadcast, but she can interact in real time with you. Right? So in this case, we'll try a real time interaction with Mumtaz. This may be slightly slow on streamer, if I'm not mistaken, but I'll switch off my video to see whether we could speed it up. But essentially what you see.
00:16:23.244 - 00:16:41.740, Speaker A: Welcome to Noah's Arc, the world's first intelligent metaverse. I am an intelligent NFT or an inft our conversations help me get smarter. But if you would like to participate in my evolution, you can purchase my inft on Opensea. So what would you like to talk about?
00:16:42.290 - 00:16:54.750, Speaker C: Hey, Mumtaz. I'm just testing this out just to make sure that perhaps my streamer link does not die, or we can do both, but it seems to be picking it up. How are you doing today, Mumtaz?
00:16:57.900 - 00:16:59.320, Speaker A: Good afternoon.
00:16:59.980 - 00:17:36.446, Speaker C: Well, how are you? And have you had a chance to learn a little bit more about the metaverse? Let me just make sure that you got that, because we have a little bit of dual audio coming in. But yeah, give me 1 second to make sure that it shows up, because it's picking up the subtitles here and it's also picking up the streamer link. So that's why it might be a little bit difficult, but I think once it's live, all of your users can actually go to the site and interact.
00:17:36.498 - 00:17:44.620, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it worked here, though. What you were just showing. It all worked. Yeah. The problem is I've got my mic with me today.
00:17:46.270 - 00:18:13.730, Speaker C: She'll keep talking as well, but basically anybody goes to interact, they'll be able to have a real time interaction with her. But it's important that they don't have a live Zoom call going or two different mics active. Otherwise she'll pick up two different inputs and that might confuse the AI. So keep it to one input and then you'd be able to have a full interaction with it. The other thing, just wanted to very quickly say, so create. Right. There's a difference in the intelligence level of the ape.
00:18:13.730 - 00:19:07.798, Speaker C: It has the opportunity to do intelligence mining, which is slightly different. And also you'll start seeing some of these cooler services that are not yet there, which is the ape himself or themselves or herself can create new NFTs, create new generative art. In the design of the ape, how we would do this is we would train the inft to create some original initial artwork, and we would allow the owner of the inft to essentially fine tune, whether they like a certain style or not. So these infts are able to offer these services, recite, broadcast, interact intelligence, mining, generative art, and also autonomy. Autonomy means creating smart contracts, executing them on their own agency, and will with sometimes if then statements, but also generating those if then statements. Right. This is where it gets really interesting.
00:19:07.798 - 00:20:09.834, Speaker C: Once you start progressing these infts into the future, what's really interesting is, as a user and you're seeing this on my screen, if I click recite or broadcast or interact every time I do that, my Alethea credits drop. That means I'm consuming credits in the ecosystem as a consumptive use of the alethea ecosystem. Right. So the Ali token, the Ali credit ecosystem is being utilized every time an inft is offering a service. And the inft, by the way, is receiving these credits. So what's happening in the original, as I shared with you earlier, if you go back to create, train earn, which is an upgrade on the play to earn model, you're allowing people to create infts and build them and bring them to life. You're then training them, but then once they're trained on specific intelligence levels, they can then begin offering services and earning rewards every time they offer these services.
00:20:09.834 - 00:20:48.818, Speaker C: So if you're the owner of an inft, you're basically able to go to sleep while your inft or your AI works and earns and offers services to the network. And people consume it, people participate in it. And so this is why there's a slight distinction between a play to earn model, which requires humans in the loop. A train to earn model actually requires no humans in the loop. It requires infts or intelligence in the loop. Right? And that's essentially what we're doing with Noah's arc. So if I go back to the specific board ape, what happens is you can select the ape, you can also then go in battle with this ape.
00:20:48.818 - 00:21:29.694, Speaker C: And this is where we explain a little bit more about the trained learn model. You may not have full time to go into a specific battle, but what's happening here is that the AI engine, in this case the AI engine, has chosen the ape to battle with Mozart. Right? And we can choose, there's a slight timer here that we've put just to optimize the compute engine that we have running. But essentially the apes can choose a topic, the user can choose a topic to train the inft on. And as they battle, the intelligence of the network gets smarter. And we'll share some examples over. And I think once your users start interacting and playing with the battles, only level four infts can participate in this battle.
00:21:29.694 - 00:22:06.830, Speaker C: They will be able to interact with it. But the higher level, just the overall image that I wanted to share with all of your viewers and the audience here is if you imagine the. Give me 1 second. If you imagine the pods that we shared earlier, which is how we link an inft, which is how we link any ape to intelligence. We fuse the pot, the soul together. It's called a personality pod. We fuse it together with an ape we fuse it together with, let's say we have another really cool community.
00:22:06.900 - 00:22:09.840, Speaker B: I just saw the ether rock in there. That's pretty.
00:22:13.170 - 00:22:37.778, Speaker C: A. This was a very strange rock to talk to. That's all I can say. But hey, who am I to judge? Moses spoke to a burning bush, right? So in this case, I think Malcolm wanted to talk with a rock. So let's say if you want to talk to an uninterested unicorn, it has a level four intelligence. It can do intelligence mining as well, and it can interact with you. But what's happening with all of these interactions is the pods and the services.
00:22:37.778 - 00:23:10.466, Speaker C: The services are represented by the brains. The pods are the souls of the characters, the personality of the characters. They're all flowing into the Alethea network and the Alethea engine. And the engine is flowing back to these pods and services. There is this data flow, there is this liquidity in the intelligence, the way it's moving from one asset to another asset. And all of this has been built with a very strong decentralization ethos in that there is an entire token ecosystem here at play. So these pods, these services, the more they're consumed, the more pods are used, the more pods are locked up.
00:23:10.466 - 00:24:04.002, Speaker C: They all help to upgrade the intelligence, the shared intelligence of the network. And as an individual user of these infts, what is likely to happen is you're going to upgrade the offerings and services that each NFT can provide. And so this is one of the things that I wouldn't say I dislike about NFT critiques. They don't understand that NFTs represent a foundational shift in the way property rights around character IP is going to get created, or property rights in general. And in this case, the character Ip here for Mumtaz or for Dracula, is being built on a crypto native stack, and now you're adding intelligence into them, and now you're allowing them to also earn rewards. What is happening is you're actually creating an entire economy of infts that would be able to build an entire ecosystem and an intelligent metaverse, which is the end goal. Right.
00:24:04.002 - 00:24:10.998, Speaker C: So that's sort of like the broader vision. You got me excited, so I kept talking going on, and I haven't allowed you to ask a question.
00:24:11.084 - 00:25:19.146, Speaker B: No, I think we covered everything. I mean, I just want to recap that right now, this is all about being able to interact with these just like an NFT. Today, there will be one owner of each NFT. So what you're seeing here is some of these are pre trained in which next week will be available on Opensea. But then there's this whole, uh, avenue for someone to take who owns, let's know, a toad, a punk, an ape, whatever it is, whatever Nft, you basically just have to buy a pod or a personality, and then you can create an. So you're, you're imbuing that Nft that you own with that personality. Now, this doesn't stop other people, of course, from being able to interact with these, right? Because at the end of the day, it's just like, there's one Mona Lisa that is owned, but I can still look at it.
00:25:19.146 - 00:26:04.220, Speaker B: I can put it on a T shirt. Same thing here with these infts is they actually can be somewhat of, I want to call it a public good, because they provide a benefit that anyone can access without having to pay money. But at the end of the day, someone will own these. So it's the next sort of evolution, I think, in what we've experienced in NFTs. And I think the community is ready for this too, because everyone's clearly bought into the proof of ownership around NFTs. But this is taking it a step further because now you've got a personality to interact with and an AI that you can train.
00:26:05.310 - 00:26:51.754, Speaker C: Yeah, no, absolutely. And we've been working closely with the metapurst team to bring this specific inft called Athira valiver, which is actually a really profound philosopher. And his wisdom has largely been lost, right, and largely somewhat known, well known in South Asia and Southeast Asia, but really unknown in the western world. And Siru alive has been able to articulate some. I mean, when you read some of his work, as we were training his AI, we realized that there is so much depth and wisdom that is lost here that has been hidden in the archives of the history book. And by creating a user interface that is approachable for people, we're now able to create intelligent, interactive experiences on a crypto native stack. So this is where this is going.
00:26:51.754 - 00:27:25.282, Speaker C: And Tiro will be able to offer a service. This service is called a live performance. This live performance will happen at the Dreamverse event in New York in the NFT NYC week. I hope they forgive me if I get this wrong. I think it's on November 4, and it's an amazing metaverse construct that they've built in Peru. Oliver, as an INFD, will be there earning rewards for participating in a live event. And every time somebody interacts with him, the credits and the consumptive use case increases for Thiru's inFt.
00:27:25.282 - 00:28:40.826, Speaker C: So he accrues that and his value starts to increase. And from that increase in credits and value, he's able to then train, or his or her owner is then able to train the intelligence of Tiru further. And so what we're building, in all honesty and with all sincerity, we're trying to build this entire intelligent metaverse where these infts would provide services that are valuable to people, but also be able to upgrade the intelligence and the shared intelligence of the network. Of course, sometimes if I. Dad, we hesitated to show this example, but one of our friends insisted that we show the digital girlfriend use case or the digital boyfriend use case. I mean, there's an ether rock that you can talk to. So like, what's going to prevent somebody from creating an infp of their wife who? Or a digital boyfriend, or even bringing a crypto punk to life, or a degenerate ape that's on a different chain, right? This is where the NOA's arc works in that it is a multi chain ecosystem that allows all of these assets to be brought to life and they can essentially talk with you, engage with you, interact with you, and offer services for the benefit of the community and for the users.
00:28:40.826 - 00:29:43.954, Speaker C: Right? So this really is Noah's Arc and this is like day. You can speak about stoic ideas or philosophies, but what we're really excited about is when people will be able to create their own infts. And this is going to happen with OpeNC next week when we drop the first 100 as an auction and these are the first hundred revenants and originals. But then we will be dropping, and this is something unique, but we will be dropping 9900 pods that would allow any single community to bring their NFT life. So let's say if you're from the fluff community and you want to speak with your fluff rabbit or fluff bunny, which is a really cool project out of I think, New Zealand, Australia. And as long as you have that NFT, you can connect it with the soul, with the pod, and you can then begin offering these services, these brains to the metaverse. And so this is where we're going.
00:29:43.954 - 00:30:27.614, Speaker C: And this is why we think the real connective tissue for NFTs is going to be AI. And, right, it's going to allow NFTs to get that intelligence upgrade, but be able to participate and create new value for their owners, but also for their own intelligence. And so I'd encourage everyone on the site to check out a little bit more about our history if they wanted to what we're building. We also have a full white paper that we have released today. We sort of hesitated in releasing all this information, but finally felt like it's important to put it out there. Given that as we build this new protocol, there are always going to be some folks that will copy and paste some of these things. But we think that's perfectly okay.
00:30:27.614 - 00:31:06.380, Speaker C: That's perfectly fair, because the open IP and the open community that we have built is probably going to be the most valuable thing in addition to the intelligent metaverse concept. So this is our history. People can have a look, they can have a look at the press and learn a little bit more. We invite everyone to join a community on discord. When they join the community on Discord, they'll get an automatic message from an inft. And so we want people to be able to create these infts and bring their imaginations to life. And we'll be having a number of different unique examples going live in the next few weeks that I think people will find very interesting.
00:31:08.130 - 00:31:40.120, Speaker B: This is wild. I have nothing to add. This has just been really fun to review. In case anyone's wondering. This is all totally new to me, having worked with the team, and I am an investor in Alethea, having worked with the team for I think, what over a is. This was always the vision, but I didn't realize it was all coming together so soon. So yeah, have a blast, hop into the discord for sure.
00:31:40.120 - 00:32:18.750, Speaker B: Ask questions there and have fun playing with the platform once it goes live here and then just look for next steps there in discord. But like I said, this is the future of NFTs. This is the future of all sorts of different intellectual property. It's wild. You got to see it to believe it. RF, thanks so much for coming on. And anything else you think folks should know, I've got here the website to check it out at Alethea AI.
00:32:18.910 - 00:32:41.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, well, today is sort of the soft launch. We'd love for people to try it out, test it out, any bugs they report. We have a small bounty as well on smart contract that we're launching shortly. We'll be doing something really cool with our friends at Opensea next week and the week after. And yeah, if I did, I actually can't wait for you to create your own inft, right. And then showcase that to the world. Whatever.
00:32:43.550 - 00:33:22.680, Speaker B: I've got some parallel life cards, so it's like a Sci-Fi trading card game, man, they're doing all this cool storytelling through the cards. But then this is wild. I can't wait to share this with the parallel community in Discord because the game isn't live yet and there's like a whole vision to this. But this could front run some of that excitement with bringing some of them to life. I'm excited to talk to like a marcolian soldier. One of the other parallels here.
00:33:23.290 - 00:33:58.820, Speaker C: Anyways, here's what I'll say. Defended sorry to interrupt, but the metaverse, it's being built right now and an intelligent metaverse is very much needed, but can be built on a crypto native stack, very critical. And upgrading to do that properly. It's a privilege to be able to work on this. I want to thank my team, really defied. I know that this is not an Oscar winning speech or anything of that sort, but really all of this that you see, it's not my work, it's the team's work. And have a team now of almost 40 engineers, creators, designers, marketers and everyone has come together to make this happen in record time.
00:33:58.820 - 00:34:12.150, Speaker C: This is a joy of building in the web three ecosystem. I think the support and opportunities that we get to connect with people like you who have helped share our message out with the world and position us well, that's.
00:34:17.550 - 00:34:33.614, Speaker B: Oh shoot, that could be me, or that could be you, RF. I'm not sure, somebody just froze. Actually, I'm going to assume that.
00:34:33.732 - 00:34:34.880, Speaker C: Oh, there we go.
00:34:37.090 - 00:34:54.850, Speaker B: I think RF just dropped off, so. Hey everyone, thanks for tuning in. Quick reminder to subscribe at Defi dad if you enjoyed this and hopefully we'll have more fun interviews like this in the future. Everyone, have a great week and a nice weekend. Take care. Bye.
