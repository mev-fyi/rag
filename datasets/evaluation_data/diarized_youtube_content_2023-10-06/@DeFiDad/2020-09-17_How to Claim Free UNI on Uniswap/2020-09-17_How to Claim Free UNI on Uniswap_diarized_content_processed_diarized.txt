00:00:19.300 - 00:01:12.270, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad. I've got a really short tutorial for you today on how you can claim your uni tokens. So uniswap surprised all us last night and released a new governance token called Uni. It's really exciting just because Uniswap is. If you're going to rank the importance of different DFI platforms, not only do they always end up in the top ten in terms of total value locked, I mean, they are one of the pioneers of DFI. I would argue that most of what we see today wouldn't exist if it weren't for the work that they did years ago to create this swap. The good news is, for those of you that have traded on uniswap with this token, they have given away 60% to the community.
00:01:12.270 - 00:02:13.010, Speaker A: It's going to be used to incentivize folks to provide liquidity by going here to the pool option. So this is where someone could add liquidity and then continuously earn this new uni token. What I'm going to talk about though, is just claiming the uni token, because it's really quick and easy. So for those of you that have used uniswap, if you have ever used it for a trade, or even, if you'll notice here it says, even for those that have ever had a submitted failed transaction, there's about 12,000 wallet addresses that have been sent a claim of 400 uni. And for those of you that were liquidity providers, there's a lot more there. It's, I think, broken out according to how much liquidity you provided over however much time. That is through September 1, 2020.
00:02:13.010 - 00:03:01.570, Speaker A: So let's go back to the dashboard here. It's really easy. All you have to do to claim your tokens is connect your wallet. If you have multiple ethereum wallets, you're going to have to do this multiple times for those different wallets that you've ever used with Uniswap. But here's a quick example. So I can go ahead and click claim, and then you notice I've got 400 uni available to me, and then I'm going to claim uni, and then we'll have one metamask transaction. So before I confirm this transaction, just take note that since this was launched, gas prices have gone as high as they've ever been in 2020.
00:03:01.570 - 00:03:32.330, Speaker A: It's definitely not crazy to wait a bit to claim these tokens. They're not going anywhere. They're there against one's Ethereum wallet. Whenever you connect to Uniswap, so there's no rush on this, but if you are looking to claim these and if you are able to pay a higher gas fee. So at this point, it looks like I'm going to pay about $17 of ether as a gas fee. That's the maximum I'd pay. It could be a little bit less.
00:03:32.330 - 00:04:11.472, Speaker A: And so you can see that in order to get a transaction through in less than 35 minutes, it's 446 guay. If I want to get it through in less than 30 seconds, it's 700 guay. So I'm going to bet that if I put it around, let's say, 550, it'll easily go through. So we'll put in 550. And this is to prevent me from getting stuck with a transaction again. If this is too much to pay for someone, just wait. Gas prices will come down eventually.
00:04:11.472 - 00:04:55.120, Speaker A: And it's not like your uni tokens can be claimed by anyone else or that they're going to expire. They're there against your Ethereum wallet address. So we'll go ahead and hit confirm. All right, so my transaction went through, so I've now got 400 uni tokens. Oh, by the way, if you remain on the screen, on the uniswap screen, you'll see like they have some animated confetti that shoots off and whatever it gives you a shot of dopamine for claiming your tokens. And then you can see here that I have my 400 uni. And then one last thing I wanted to show is if you go to Zapper Phi and connect your wallet.
00:04:55.120 - 00:05:39.520, Speaker A: So I connected my metamask wallet to get to defi dad ETH, I can then click on wallet and I can see my uni tokens here, what's the price of them, and then what's the estimated total value? I don't need to really cover any risk here. The risk is, I think, just the usual risks of using any Ethereum application. Take good care of your wallet. Never share your private key. Make sure that you're checking the gas prices here to prevent yourself from getting stuck with a transaction. These are really high gas prices, so it would make a lot of sense if I were to just wait longer to claim these. So that's all I've got for you today.
00:05:39.520 - 00:05:42.370, Speaker A: I hope you find this helpful and I'll see you next time.
