00:00:00.490 - 00:00:18.160, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, I'm Defi dad. We're here with the Defi podcast at East Denver, and I'm joined here at the ZK sync era booth by Alex, who is the business development lead at Sushiswap. How are zk rollups impacting the development of future Sushiswap products?
00:00:18.530 - 00:00:49.934, Speaker B: Howdy, everyone. Alex here. I'm really excited to be really involved in the ZK space. We think that ZK and what zero knowledge allows our users to have access to is privacy. So we're really excited to be building with ZK Sync over the next few months to really build that into our defi offering. We've been really very bullish on going multi chain and going towards aggregation. We want to be the nexus point between all.
00:00:49.934 - 00:00:57.530, Speaker B: All of the different tokens, all of the different communities, and all of the different areas and ecosystems in Defi that exist.
