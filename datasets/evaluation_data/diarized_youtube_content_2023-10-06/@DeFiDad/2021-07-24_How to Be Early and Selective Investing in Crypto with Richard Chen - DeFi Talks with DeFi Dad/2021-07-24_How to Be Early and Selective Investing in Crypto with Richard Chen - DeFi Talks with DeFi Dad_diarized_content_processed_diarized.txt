00:00:01.970 - 00:00:16.722, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, I think we're live. Hey, everyone. Hey. This is d five talks with DFI dad. It is Friday, July 23, 2021. Today we're going to talk with my friend Richard Chen.
00:00:16.722 - 00:00:41.342, Speaker A: Richard is general partner at one confirmation. He has been someone who I have personally learned a lot from last year, just talking about the different concentrated bets he is making at one confirmation in the defi and NFT space. So, Richard, welcome to my new live stream, whatever this is. How are you?
00:00:41.476 - 00:00:46.754, Speaker B: Good, good. Thanks for having me on. It's been a while since I last was on your show.
00:00:46.952 - 00:00:54.226, Speaker A: Yeah, we talked forever ago about super rare at the time. We were talking about cryptoart IO.
00:00:54.258 - 00:00:57.240, Speaker B: Yeah, we were talking about crypto art adio at the time. Yeah.
00:00:57.930 - 00:01:34.750, Speaker A: And it's funny because that was, I think, right around the people 20 sale and things exploded right after that. But, yeah, you know what, let's start with just very briefly in case anyone doesn't know you, can you share a bit about your background? And then I just want to dive right into it. There's so much we can cover. We'll probably be talking today for about 30 to 45 minutes tops. Richard is on the bleeding edge of everything, DFI and NFt. So anyways, Richard, how did you get started in crypto?
00:01:34.910 - 00:02:02.860, Speaker B: Yeah, it was back in 2015 when I was co founded Stanford Blockchain Club and really got into it more from the academic technical side because I was studying cryptography, distributed systems, doing research in that space. And it just happened that blockchains and cryptocurrencies was like the natural application of all that. And 2017 came around and then joined one confirmation and just been in the space since.
00:02:03.950 - 00:02:36.790, Speaker A: Very cool. And I guess, do you want to call out some of the notable investments you've made? I mean, there's a lot. It's really like a who's who of the blue chip names in DeFI and NFTs. I want to call attention to some of the NFT investments you made, because some of those were, they were much bolder when you made them. And now everybody loves opensea and others like it. But anyways, yeah. Can you talk about some of the highlights of the investments you've.
00:02:38.490 - 00:03:31.960, Speaker B: You know, just pulling up a portfolio. So, like Opensea, super rare, for know, in DeFi, there's like Nexus Mutual, Makerdao, DYDX, like some of the blue chips, index co op and others. And also with NFTs, I think we were the first fund to buy NFTs directly. I think last time we spoke, we bought the very first super rare artwork like token ID number one, which is AI generated new portrait by Robbie Barat. That was before the whole crypto art space exploded. So we've made quite a bit of NFT investments in blue chip stuff. We bought a me bit skeleton, like some OG crypto arts, like top shots from LeBron, Luka Doncic and others.
00:03:33.950 - 00:04:26.010, Speaker A: Yes, it has to have been a gratifying last year, to say the least. There's quite a few I told you so moments that you have the right to call out. So let's talk about then, some of your latest investments to set up some more context for this, in case anyone's watching this in the future. So we've lived through either part of or an entire bull market. We've had a few months of market prices drawing down. We're down like, let's say 50, 60% on bitcoin ether and so on. And yet still, I'm happy to report, there's just so much fundamental value in our space.
00:04:26.010 - 00:05:27.820, Speaker A: There are so many quality projects that are launching. And so I will say, at least when prices go down, what has always helped me to refocus my energy, my efforts, is to learn about new projects. And so we have a flourishing economy. On Ethereum, we've seen a parabolic growth on Polygon's defi community, and there's all sorts of other activity going on between, like Terra Solana. Whatever you classify BSc's activity, there's a lot happening there as well. So this leads us to this idea of cross chain defi and this ability to be able to hop between Ethereum, let's say, and Polygon trustlessly, permissionlessly, and obviously as quickly as possible. So we've got hop protocol to talk about here.
00:05:27.820 - 00:05:37.022, Speaker A: Can you tell us a little bit about what is the value here that the hop protocol is looking to deliver? And then actually we can start to talk through it live here.
00:05:37.156 - 00:07:00.230, Speaker B: Yeah. So thesis behind that is if in a few years, crypto becomes multichain and there's high TV dell across different layer twos, layer ones, then interoperability and kind of the infrastructure for moving assets between different chains is going to be key. And if you look at existing ways of doing it, they're mostly just like multi sigs. So you're kind of trusting a centralized party to move the assets between chains, or they rely on a separate blockchain with its own consensus mechanism, and you have to swap between Ethereum to the native token of that blockchain, and then from that blockchain to say, like salana or something. So hop, they built a novel approach of doing cross chain swaps using Amms, where they're incentivizing liquidity to flow between layer one to layer two or layer two to layer one. If the price of the AMM is out of whack. So say if the price of USDC on Matic is higher than polygon, then you're going to incentivize ARB traders to move their USDC from Ethereum to Polygon and close that ARb.
00:07:00.230 - 00:07:56.620, Speaker B: And that's how they keep the prices in check. And then they also have bonders who are basically people who give you upfront liquidity, kind of like a short term loan, to bypass the withdrawal delay. So one of the big ux challenges for Polygon and especially optimistic roll ups is there's like a withdrawal delay when you want to move your funds from optimism back to layer one, which currently is around seven days. But you can pay a bonder a fee to get instant withdrawal. And the bonder also runs an optimism node to make sure that there's not going to be any fraud proofs. And if they think that there aren't going to be any fraud proofs, then they'll front you the liquidity for free. And that really solves the UX problem with optimistic roll ups of having instant liquidity between layer one and layer two.
00:07:56.990 - 00:08:41.370, Speaker A: So currently on hop protocol, if anyone goes to app hop exchange, I'm on the send feature. So I can choose between. Here we go. I can choose between Ethereum, Mainnet, Polygon and XDI, and I can move back and forth between these. So anyone who is participating in Defi on any one of these chains, now you've got this bridge where you can go back and forth versus, I would say there's a lot of disjointed ways to do this. One of my favorite ways, I use Zapper's bridge. So Zapper buy bridge to go from Mainnet to Polygon, but I can't go backwards yet.
00:08:41.370 - 00:09:05.566, Speaker A: And so this faults that. I'm able to go back to that. I haven't tried this yet. How quickly is the, once I have it confirmed on, let's say I'm going to go from Ethereum main net to polygon, assuming I set the gas price high enough, how quickly will that show up on Polygon?
00:09:05.758 - 00:09:07.874, Speaker B: It's usually like a couple of minutes.
00:09:08.072 - 00:09:20.840, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Okay, assuming that's true, that is faster than the polygon bridge, because the polygon bridge normally takes about five to seven minutes.
00:09:21.530 - 00:09:39.598, Speaker B: I think it was like closer to ten, like the last time I use it. But yeah, it's faster on the way to polygon. The big difference is when you want to go from polygon back to main net, because for that it's like 3 hours for polygon, whereas for hop it's also like a couple of minutes as well.
00:09:39.764 - 00:10:13.190, Speaker A: Oh, that is cool. Yeah, the fastest I've ever gone is about 45 minutes maybe. And throwing aside the speed conversation, I mean, again, it's just like, this is something you bookmark, then you can use. If I'm on polygon, maybe I want to go to XDI. I haven't personally used Defi on XDi yet. I'm embarrassed to say that because there's quite a few apps now that I should try there. But this is really probably what's going to enable me to do that, to be able to go from polygon to XDai.
00:10:13.190 - 00:10:37.280, Speaker A: Some of the details you called out earlier, if one wants to provide liquidity, can you just explain how that works here? We're talking about USDC adding liquidity so that one can bridge between polygon and actually, can you explain what exactly?
00:10:38.290 - 00:11:11.290, Speaker B: Yeah, so you have liquidity pools on, like you have amm pools on polygon and XDI. So let's just use polygon. Example. So it's a fork of saddles contract, which saddles are also a fork of curve. So the liquidity pair is USDC and HUSDC. And HUSDC is basically hops token that they use to communicate between layer one and layer two. So behind the scenes, what actually happens is you want to send USDC from layer one to polygon.
00:11:11.290 - 00:11:36.130, Speaker B: What actually happens is hop will convert USDC to HUSDC on ethereum, get the equivalent amount, mint the equivalent amount of HUSDC on polygon, and then swap that back to USDC on polygon. So the pool on polygon basically provides that instant liquidity when hop has to swap from HUSDC to USDC on polygon.
00:11:37.590 - 00:11:45.314, Speaker A: So if I wanted to provide liquidity here, I do need to switch over to polygon or network first. Okay, cool.
00:11:45.432 - 00:11:56.150, Speaker B: And then to get HUSDC, you can actually go to the convert tab. And then it's like a one to one conversion from USDC to HUSDC.
00:11:56.810 - 00:12:00.460, Speaker A: Yes, very cool. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:12:01.790 - 00:12:04.438, Speaker B: Also I think click on via amm.
00:12:04.614 - 00:12:06.666, Speaker A: Oh yeah, let's do via Hopbridge. Yeah.
00:12:06.688 - 00:12:08.202, Speaker B: So now it's one to one.
00:12:08.336 - 00:12:09.360, Speaker A: There we go.
00:12:09.970 - 00:12:22.714, Speaker B: So that's how you convert like half of your USDC into HUSDC. And then you just deposit both pairs into the amm, and there's no impermanent loss risk because it's like a stable coin amm.
00:12:22.842 - 00:13:09.726, Speaker A: So if I was going to provide liquidity, which I am wondering, what is the estimated Apy or APR here? But I would start here on, let's say, the convert tab, convert some of my USDC into this polygon, HUSDC. Then I can hop over here to the pull tab, and then this is where still actually, one other thing to call out here to provide liquidity, I need both USDC on polygon and I need H USDC. It's basically like the old days of providing liquidity. You need to prepare like a 50 50 portion of each token.
00:13:09.838 - 00:13:12.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct. Cool.
00:13:12.790 - 00:13:26.310, Speaker A: And I think 99% of people are going to be interested in just. This is the ultimate utility, I guess. Is there a timeline for when this would support optimism?
00:13:27.290 - 00:14:03.890, Speaker B: Yes, soon. TM is what they all say. They have the tech all in place. It's just waiting for optimism and arbitrum to kind of come out of a guarded launch to a full launch. And money can flow freely, because right now, I think uniswap and optimism, they cap you on your trade. So it's still not like a fully permissionless system yet, but the hop team has all the infrastructure in place and it's pretty easy to integrate new EVM based chains.
00:14:04.790 - 00:14:10.260, Speaker A: Richard, do you happen to know how much a USDC LP is worth?
00:14:11.430 - 00:14:12.738, Speaker B: That's one to one.
00:14:12.904 - 00:14:14.054, Speaker A: It is one to one.
00:14:14.172 - 00:14:20.710, Speaker B: You can do the math here. I don't know what the price of Maddox is right now, but that's how you calculate APY.
00:14:24.030 - 00:14:32.700, Speaker A: There's about 4 million USDC in value, $4 million of value that's been staked. And then each day there is about.
00:14:35.470 - 00:15:00.754, Speaker B: $0.87 right now times 32. 46 times 365. So it's about 25% right now. The pool is earning a little over a million a year in Maddox rewards. Million dollars a year in Madox rewards and TDL is around 4 million. So about 25%.
00:15:00.872 - 00:15:13.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just double check. 32, 46 wrapped Maddox times $0.87 times 365 days. So we're at about a million dollars. Oh, yeah, you're right. We got it there. Yeah, about 25%.
00:15:13.350 - 00:15:18.442, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. I'm guessing very few people know about that.
00:15:18.496 - 00:15:25.900, Speaker B: Yeah, they haven't been super marketing about. They haven't marketed the liquidity program.
00:15:26.450 - 00:15:55.350, Speaker A: No, this is great. It's interesting because it's all stable coins, too. Quick reminder, this is not financial advice. You shouldn't follow anything. We're saying as an investment strategy. But I will say personally, for my own portfolio, I find it interesting anytime I can just use stablecoins and earn yield. A few things to call out, though, of course, is I would personally be worried about smart contract risk.
00:15:55.350 - 00:16:06.422, Speaker A: Hop is new, it's a newer protocol. And gosh, what else is there to think about? I mean, all the usual sorts of concerns.
00:16:06.566 - 00:16:25.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess, like matic risk. So the risk of LPA, the instant liquidity pool, is if there's a bug in a layer two or a side chain, everyone's rushing to exit their liquidity. You're kind of like the sucker who's taking the other side of the.
00:16:26.530 - 00:16:56.860, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. The question is whether that HUSDC can hold its peg over time. But this is really mean. This is a project that kind of just came out of nowhere for me. I wasn't aware of it, other than having seen the announcement that they raised money with you all. And then Lido Cohen, who works a lot on indexed finance, which is a really cool project, he also works on this.
00:16:56.860 - 00:17:09.370, Speaker A: It's exciting. This is part of the reason the community is so exciting, to be a always some other incredibly valuable tool that just comes out of nowhere.
00:17:10.430 - 00:17:43.426, Speaker B: I really love the team as well. So, fun fact, they used to be smart contract auditors. They had their own auditing firm called Level K, like back in 2017. And actually before hop, they were building a smart contract wallet called Ethereum. And hop was actually a pivot from Ethereum. So what happened last year was gas prices killed the smart contract wallet use case. But that was also around the time when there started to be huge, urgent demand for layer twos.
00:17:43.426 - 00:17:59.360, Speaker B: And this was like, a pressing concern for layer twos, is because the interoperability of assets and having that fast withdrawal, especially for optimistic roll ups, that was a big issue, and that's why they pivoted to working on this.
00:18:00.210 - 00:18:18.900, Speaker A: Pretty cool. That's a great. Just. I remember Ethereum, like, trying the wallet and. Yeah, I think you said it correctly. It kind of killed that use case, at least for some. We'll see what happens here in the next few years.
00:18:18.900 - 00:18:28.578, Speaker A: Richard, should we hop over to visor finance then? I think we covered nearly everything here. Unless there's anything else you think folks should know about hop exchange.
00:18:28.754 - 00:18:30.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's about it.
00:18:30.588 - 00:18:55.390, Speaker A: Cool. All right, so let me stop sharing that and I'll share a different screen. You know, I'm going to share the home screen just for a moment, and then we'll hop into the app. Just because I think it helps to tell the story of what they're doing. So just some quick background. Here we go. Which one is it? I guess we'll find out which screen.
00:18:55.390 - 00:19:44.958, Speaker A: There we go. So uniswap v three only launched a month or a little over a month ago. We have these concentrated LPs where you can set a price range, and I personally have only used Uniswap V three. LPs through instadap has pools where you drop it in the inst or you might have to pair it with some ether and it takes care of the rest for you. It sets and resets the price range. So it's basically set it and forget it, which is what we're all used to with Uniswap V two or like sushi swap and other amms. So anyways, Richard, how does this help to solve for this sort of like, Ux problem we have with uniswap v three?
00:19:45.124 - 00:21:08.570, Speaker B: Yeah, the thesis behind visor is just DFI in general is moving towards more active liquidity management and more capital efficiency. And uniswap V three was kind of the trailblazer that did it. But now you see perpetual protocol V two is also doing active management. Sushi swap, they just announced Trident like a few days ago, which that's also going to have active management for some of their pools. So there's going to emerge an ecosystem of active managers that are setting the optimal price range and also rebalancing your lp positions as the market moves. And I guess what really differentiated visor from other projects is Visor is a platform for LP management, so they're actually not an lp manager. So the thesis is they're kind of like what Quantopian is for quants, where you have a platform for data scientists and quants to develop all these cool strategies, and they build on top of visor, and Visor just provides the SDK and API to make it easy for a data scientist who might not necessarily know solidity, to just use Python scripts and call the API every time they want to rebalance.
00:21:08.570 - 00:21:23.374, Speaker B: And this is a lot more scalable strategy than having to be a quant yourself and having to compete against dozens of other lp strategies that are going to emerge when you're just like the platform for it.
00:21:23.572 - 00:21:55.802, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's talk through some of the strategies here. I'm going to switch screens here again. I'm also going to drop it in my here. There we go, here we go. Stop sharing that and reshare this tab. She shared the wrong one.
00:21:55.802 - 00:22:21.980, Speaker A: Hold up just a sec. Share this one instead. There we go. Okay, so I'm going to try to zoom in in case anyone's looking at this on their phone. Tell me what we're looking at here. How would you start to approach deciding, I guess, what you might use here or want exposure to?
00:22:23.710 - 00:22:29.820, Speaker B: Yeah, they have, I think, over ten different strategies now.
00:22:33.790 - 00:22:36.806, Speaker A: Why don't we search for something ETH.
00:22:36.838 - 00:22:39.780, Speaker B: USDT is, I think, the most liquid one.
00:22:41.990 - 00:22:56.040, Speaker A: Sorry, I'm probably looking at the wrong one. Is this the one that we're talking about? Yeah, but maybe it's a problem with the graph right now. It's not showing the.
00:22:57.370 - 00:23:49.170, Speaker B: You need to mint advisor NFT first. So I guess for context there. So advisor NFT is basically a contract based account that gives each of these strategists, they call strategists hypervisors, like permission to spend your token, but there's also safeguards, so a strategist can't rug pull and steal all your tokens. So that way you just deposit your tokens into your contract based account and then you can use those tokens, subscribe to a bunch of different LP strategies. And these lp strategies are managed by third parties who have all their off chain data science models, but then it's also trustless because they can't rug pull and steal your tokens.
00:23:49.330 - 00:24:10.400, Speaker A: So the first thing I need to do then, before I can use any of these strategies for managing liquidity, is I need to mint a visor. NFT. Yeah, do that right now. All right. Hopefully this will be quick. Put the gas price up a little bit. So let's see what happens here.
00:24:10.400 - 00:24:31.926, Speaker A: Cool. All right, we're waiting on that. And then. So once I've got that, then I'll start to look through the rest of these, because there were. Let's see. Oh, there's 18 pairs. And you can start to look through and see, like, I've got some of the big name tokens, maker, uni and so on.
00:24:31.926 - 00:24:38.040, Speaker A: Let's see what else is here. Maddox E. Kirk. All right.
00:24:38.970 - 00:24:43.720, Speaker B: Yeah, they got most of the blue chip stuff, like blue chip erc, 20s.
00:24:44.330 - 00:25:04.714, Speaker A: Yeah. This is super helpful to know. Okay, so I'm going to mint that visor NFT. That should be done any second. And then from there, is it just me dropping in whatever amount of, let's say, USDC or do I need to drop in two tokens?
00:25:04.762 - 00:25:15.810, Speaker B: Or is it. The cool thing is you can do a single asset deposit, so you only need to drop in one. And then the behind the scenes, they're responsible for maintaining that ratio.
00:25:16.790 - 00:25:28.470, Speaker A: You know what, here, why don't we hop into. There's an analytics view here as well, see if this comes up. I'm just waiting to see if that once that check the gas price, if it skyrocket.
00:25:29.450 - 00:25:32.054, Speaker B: Yeah, the analytics is also a bit.
00:25:32.172 - 00:25:57.726, Speaker A: Buggy, but let's go back to this. No, I just going to refresh my NFT. Should have minted. Give it a sec here. All right, we're going to connect through metamask. All right, there we go. So I got my NFT minted, so now I should be able to participate in any of these.
00:25:57.726 - 00:26:05.986, Speaker A: I'm going to skip this for right now. The stake visor. So this is token, but what you can earn, I'm assuming by staking that.
00:26:06.168 - 00:26:19.954, Speaker B: Yeah. So 10% of the Uniswap V three fees goes to buying visor, and that gets distributed to stakers. So there's a direct value capture mechanism for the token.
00:26:20.082 - 00:26:42.750, Speaker A: Very cool. Okay, so if I'm in a strategy, like, let's pretend I have uni and I want to earn with that 10% of the collective fees, or 10% of whatever fees I earn as a proportion of being in, that will be used then to buy more visor. Is that how that works?
00:26:42.820 - 00:26:47.070, Speaker B: Correct. And then that visor gets distributed prorata to stakers.
00:26:47.490 - 00:27:00.946, Speaker A: Very cool. Okay. Yeah, no, that's great. Yeah. Anytime holding a token or staking a token, if I can earn some sort of cash flow. That's really interesting to me, by the way, too. Worth calling out.
00:27:00.946 - 00:27:33.834, Speaker A: Richard, of course, has exposure to. We talked about hot protocol and Pfizer here as well. I do not. I'm clearly talking about this and thinking about a lot of this for the first time, so I shouldn't have any sort of bias in talking about the token. All right, so why don't we look at the USDT? All right, so I'll look at this a sec. Okay, so there's 1.2 million Tbl.
00:27:33.834 - 00:27:41.710, Speaker A: Is that just in this strategy or is that just that strategy?
00:27:41.870 - 00:27:42.900, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:27:43.670 - 00:27:46.786, Speaker A: There's a lot more liquidity, by the way.
00:27:46.808 - 00:27:56.870, Speaker B: Advisor also has deposit caps right now just for secure, guarded launch, which is why you don't have nine figures in TVL.
00:27:57.290 - 00:28:19.660, Speaker A: Okay, yes, that makes sense here. This is rather new, comparably new. So less battle tested code. And anyone should exercise some caution before risking putting money into any of these strategies. And then what does progressive cap mean? What is that?
00:28:20.130 - 00:28:22.160, Speaker B: I'm actually not quite sure.
00:28:22.770 - 00:28:39.380, Speaker A: 38.54%. I'm trying to. Like. I wonder if I could find that in the help docs while we're in here. I'll check it in a sec. So anyways, so I would go into this and. Let's see, let's see.
00:28:39.380 - 00:28:54.966, Speaker A: Actually, let me go back a sec. I did what everyone does. I just skipped the. Oh, yeah, don't worry about worries. We'll just. We'll just put our money into it. Not think so.
00:28:54.966 - 00:29:16.686, Speaker A: I'm going to go into vault deposit. Defi is bleeding edge technology. While this hyper advisor has been audited out of an abundance of caution, you should not deposit more than you're willing to lose. Good to say that. All right, so I could do single asset versus two tokens, and then let's pretend I've got 100 USDT in this wallet. And there we go. Cool.
00:29:16.686 - 00:29:39.830, Speaker A: So I would go through the usual steps then, of just approve and deposit. No, this is easy. Okay. Unfortunately, I don't have any tether in this wallet to show it off right now. But this is cool. This is really easy. Now I see how I could start to participate in v three LPs.
00:29:39.830 - 00:30:08.670, Speaker A: I got to the point of almost depositing, and I think gas in general was around 100 gwe or more. And I was hesitant just because it was going to be expensive, like, probably $100 just of gas. But this is cool to be able to approach it with one token. The single asset deposit really makes depositing that much easier.
00:30:09.010 - 00:30:31.910, Speaker B: And speaking of gas, one of the good things about having a vault is you amortize the cost of gas at scale. So why should you do this versus running your own strategies? Well, unless you have massive personal money in this, eventually the gas is going to eat into your rebalancing every time you rebalance that cost gas, and that's going to eat into your fees.
00:30:33.370 - 00:30:56.560, Speaker A: Actually, let me go back here to USDT here. I'm going to go to vault deposit. Proceed. I'm going to choose single asset deposit, and I'm going to choose wheat. Oh, I do have some 0.1. Try this.
00:30:58.550 - 00:31:00.770, Speaker B: Approve and then deposit.
00:31:02.150 - 00:31:30.460, Speaker A: So the approve is usual. It's going to be really cheap here. But Richard, I was just wondering. So I'm going to reject here. I was wondering, have you done this recently? I'm curious how much gas one might spend. Gas prices right now are around, like, 20 gwe. While we're on this live stream, how much that might cost.
00:31:31.150 - 00:31:42.160, Speaker B: Let me see. So it's about 180,000 gas. So around 20 gwe would be like five dollars to ten dollars.
00:31:42.770 - 00:32:16.294, Speaker A: There we go. Yeah, that is much cheaper than what it costs to go in the manual method of using the uniswap. So, man, this is cool. Me and our team at fourth revolution capital were talking about this and just think it's a really important development to enabling more to using concentrated LPs. Cool. Richard, anything else that you think folks should know about here? Like I might see if. Oh, here we go.
00:32:16.294 - 00:32:32.590, Speaker A: Performance analytics. This is cool. Anything you want to talk through here? I'm going to see if the data will load. I don't have the greatest Internet signal, so it might not. Yeah. Anything you can share in terms of the performance of visor so far?
00:32:32.660 - 00:32:51.620, Speaker B: Yeah, Delphi actually wrote a good report on the state of Unisoft v three active managers and like, outperformed since inception, they've outperformed all the other active managers in the report. There's like a nice graph showing performance over time.
00:32:55.530 - 00:33:04.578, Speaker A: What is the underlying mechanism that's choosing that price range? I want to say, is it visor that's using Bollinger bands?
00:33:04.674 - 00:33:50.280, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's actually an organization called Gamma Strategies. So it's funded by the visor Dow, and it's a group of data scientists from Citadel and these Wall street traders and quants who are developing strategies. So it's based on Bollinger bands you can probably guess is the most logical strategy to use. And they've also done really good research, published doing dashboards and blog posts on kind of the state of Unisoft v three. So I'm a big fan of the ecosystem that Visor has developed, and the project has only been around for a couple of months, but they already have an ecosystem of teams that are building on top of.
00:33:51.210 - 00:33:56.520, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Anything else we can expect from those that are building on top of?
00:33:58.010 - 00:34:20.500, Speaker B: I mean, I think strategies are going to get more sophisticated over time, and this is why I think it'll smart for Visor to be a platform for active managers, not a strategist themselves, because you'll have all these data scientists and quants competing against each other for the best performing strategies and you rather have all of them build on your platform.
00:34:21.750 - 00:35:04.670, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really cool. I mean, part of the reason I wanted to talk was just because these are two applications that I hadn't used, and I was like, these look like applications I should be using, especially going back to hot protocol. That bridge is going to allow me to get to XDI. So there's a number of applications. I don't even recall the names now that I had been recommended just to try, and now I can do that. But, man, you definitely have opened my eyes on these uniswap v three LPs. I just got to figure out where I want exposure.
00:35:04.670 - 00:36:09.330, Speaker A: That's really cool. I don't trust myself to set price ranges and to have reminder to anyone, if you try to use a Uniswap V three LP, you will, first off, choose a price range, which most of us would like. You can use these little tickers to basically choose a certain percentage above the price and below it. So that's great, but what happens if the price changes drastically? Well, now, if, let's say I entered the pool with ether and tether and the price of ether drops, I now have all ether. But then if the price of ether goes up, I would have technically all tether if it went out of my price range. And what visor is doing there is. It's continually allowing me to remain a market maker if it goes out of my price range that I set manually.
00:36:09.330 - 00:36:55.790, Speaker A: Unless that's your strategy to accumulate tether ether, you're out of luck and you have to basically recreate or set multiple LPs. I was talking with our team and calling this, like, point and click defi. This is what ribbon finances, option selling strategies that are just. You just drop it in and you can forget about it. Yearn, of course, is sort of the pioneer of that in the space. Like, really making that a popular vault strategy to just drop in your liquidity and leave it. Anyways, Richard, anything else, though, to share on the visor front? Anything else that folks should follow to get involved in visor finance?
00:36:55.950 - 00:36:59.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually have a dune dashboard on, like, uniswap V three.
00:37:00.550 - 00:37:03.190, Speaker A: If you try to share it, I'll put it up here.
00:37:03.260 - 00:37:04.280, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:37:12.770 - 00:37:35.542, Speaker A: If you're not familiar with this, Richard is like the king of Dune analytics. And another site you built was. Well, there's cryptoart IO, if you're into crypto art and you want to check out the analytics, there's Nexus tracker IO if you want to check out the analytics on Nexus mutual. And then here's yet another one. So go ahead, Richard. What are we looking at here?
00:37:35.596 - 00:37:37.000, Speaker B: Yeah, so can you see my.
00:37:37.770 - 00:37:38.706, Speaker A: I can, yep.
00:37:38.738 - 00:38:14.500, Speaker B: Yeah. So these are the ones that are live right now. So, like Popsicle, visor, charm, sommelier, and just tracking TVL and a number of unique addresses that have used the project, which is interesting, that has been steadily going up and to the right, despite the fact that they have deposit caps. So it's not like TVL can go super crazy and they don't have a farming program. But all this is organic usage, which is really exciting to see.
00:38:15.030 - 00:38:22.786, Speaker A: Do you know how close they are to those caps? Like how much capacity there is to still join some of the strategies?
00:38:22.978 - 00:38:34.630, Speaker B: It's per address, so it varies per strategy, but I think it's like $5,000 right now for, I think, the tether strategy.
00:38:35.210 - 00:38:43.002, Speaker A: Okay, well that's good to know then. So they're pretty filled up, which makes sense. How much longer will those caps remain before they open that up more?
00:38:43.136 - 00:38:56.880, Speaker B: I'm not sure, actually. I mean, they just finished their audit report for their first audit, and then they're also doing a few more audits, so they'll probably raise it gradually. So it's not going to be like all or nothing.
00:38:58.450 - 00:39:10.340, Speaker A: I should have asked you about this ahead of time, but I guess this is me being genuinely curious. Did visor have some sort of exploit a while ago or am I confusing them with someone else?
00:39:10.650 - 00:39:34.940, Speaker B: Yes. So that was basically the private key for their admin. While their project was going undergoing audit, they had an admin key to do emergency withdrawals just in case, which they've removed that since. But basically the private key for that admin key got compromised, which I can't say how that happened.
00:39:35.650 - 00:39:39.854, Speaker A: No. Yeah. Good to just recap, but that's been.
00:39:39.892 - 00:39:42.906, Speaker B: Rectified by moving to a multi sig.
00:39:43.098 - 00:40:24.378, Speaker A: Yes. In case anyone's newer to this topic, when teams launch, in most cases there's like a progressive move to abstracting away centralized controls. I'm not making any excuses for the team, but obviously this is a part of the risk. We're building new decentralized computing networks and there's just a lot of risk that still needs to be mitigated and battle tested over time. So anyways, yeah, no, happy to see they overcame that.
00:40:24.464 - 00:40:32.480, Speaker B: And they immediately reimbursed users with the treasury. So it was like 250K, so it wasn't like that much.
00:40:33.410 - 00:41:24.000, Speaker A: That's rather small, actually. Today we're talking on a day. There's a second exploit that happened with door chain and I think something like it was $8 million this time. Anyways, I'm only calling that out because it's just the realities of risk in our space and a good reminder that I will say when I personally say, hey, there's all this risk to consider. You really should think, what happens if I lose all of my money in this application? And I think that helps to size positions like I personally won't put more in than what I can sleep on losing. And I have, I've lost money in a few applications and I was able to move on from them very quickly despite being a little bit upset about it.
00:41:24.770 - 00:41:31.826, Speaker B: It was just this tiny blip right here. They reimbursed users and then it moved on from there.
00:41:31.848 - 00:41:35.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So they're up to about 6 million in Tbl.
00:41:35.670 - 00:41:38.354, Speaker B: 7 million in TbL, yeah.
00:41:38.472 - 00:42:17.040, Speaker A: Man, this is going to explode. This kind of reminds me, in a way of convex finance, very different utility, but it's an augmentation of something that everybody desperately wants to use. So convex boosts your curve earnings if you're an LP in curve, and this is essentially boosting your ability to earn as an LP in uniswap, assuming that the strategies are working, which they seem to be working. So, gosh. Anything else, Richard, on the analytics side that you think folks should know about?
00:42:17.410 - 00:42:22.930, Speaker B: Oh, I think that's it for visor. I could share also the dune. Sorry, the hop?
00:42:23.510 - 00:42:27.858, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, pull that up. That'd be great. This is probably a good one to wrap up on.
00:42:27.944 - 00:42:45.846, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is hop. I love building all these for portfolio companies. Right when they launch. It's always super helpful for them. And this is kind of their KPIs with daily volume, TVL and Ethereum. Polygon XDI.
00:42:45.846 - 00:43:01.630, Speaker B: This shows the breakdown of Polygon XDI volume, which it's not surprising that like 90% is going to Polygon given how much application usage there is there. They already have over 400 users, 400 addresses, which that's impressive.
00:43:02.930 - 00:43:47.386, Speaker A: Yeah. Hop is the utility behind that. I can't imagine that folks aren't going to be bookmarking that and then what's really cool. So correct me if I'm misframing this, but I think that the real value behind hop is we will get to this point eventually, where in the midst of performing Defi actions, like you're staking this, you're providing liquidity here. When you can start to mix those actions across multiple chains, that's what's going to be really cool. That's like chain Defi right now. It's more like I got to travel on the subway from one city to the next.
00:43:47.386 - 00:44:11.220, Speaker A: Then when I get off, I can have fun there. So I go from Ethereum to Polygon and go have fun in the city of Polygon. But what happens if I can sit on Ethereum and stake some tokens or liquidity on Polygon thanks to some sort of underlying protocol like hop? So anyways, is that a part of the future?
00:44:13.930 - 00:44:24.410, Speaker B: Yeah, there's definitely, definitely a big roadmap for different areas that they can explore beyond just integrating every EVM based chain in layer.
00:44:25.790 - 00:45:05.630, Speaker A: No, really, really cool stuff, Richard. I guess before you go, anything else though, that's been top of mind lately. We didn't talk about NFTs today. That's always been a hot topic to discuss. We're both very bullish on the NFT space. And I guess I have heard lately, I think there was a talking point of where the NFT market's dying off. And do you have any charts handy of say, I saw that Openseas had some of its had record mean.
00:45:05.640 - 00:45:26.620, Speaker B: It's only been like two thirds of the month of July and it's already like a record volume. And this is just Ethereum, by the way. So once you add Polygon. So there's a lot of OpenSea activity on Polygon with Zedrun and others. So yeah, the narrative is that Opensea is that NFTs are dead, but the data doesn't say.
00:45:28.830 - 00:45:30.438, Speaker A: Really interesting.
00:45:30.624 - 00:45:45.140, Speaker B: It looks like other than monthly active traders, all the other KPIs fees NFT sold volume are record high this month, which it hasn't been the end of this month yet.
00:45:45.830 - 00:46:22.026, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, that's cool. I distinctly remember OpenC and just like it felt like in 2019, the space hadn't caught up, the hype hadn't caught up with NFTs yet. And it's so funny to think back to that because I imagine Evan and the team have a good laugh now because they're just killing it. So really see, and I guess, Richard, anything to touch upon with Nexus, that's always top of mind in our conversations.
00:46:22.138 - 00:46:41.938, Speaker B: Yeah, they just launched stacked risk covers. So basically how that works is before stacked risk cover, you would have to buy cover on every single money Lego. So you have to buy cover on urine. They say urine is using curve for the yield farming. Then you have to buy cover on urine. You have to buy cover on curve as well.
00:46:42.104 - 00:46:42.434, Speaker A: What?
00:46:42.472 - 00:47:05.702, Speaker B: Stacked risk cover is just one insurance cover that you buy on just one product, and it just covers when the LP token Dpegs. So it includes things like a hacking urine, a hacking curve if USDT DpeGs and becomes insolvent and you'll get a claim payout there.
00:47:05.856 - 00:48:07.726, Speaker A: Yeah, it's solving a big problem in defi insurance because the average user just isn't going to think, well, let me check into the underlying yearn strategy and, oh, it turns out I have exposure to curve as well. I guess I need to buy cover now for both urine and curve. So there's a number of these yield token covers, which are mostly y USDc y die. They're vaults for stable coins. But then there's also ystaff, which is. I think that's one of the best. My opinion, that's one of the most valuable urine vaults because you're earning returns on staked ether through lido, but then you're covered for basically all of the underlying risk of having exposure to lido or urine or even like the staking contracts for ETH 2.0.
00:48:07.828 - 00:48:45.254, Speaker B: Yeah, speaking of lido and staked ETH, Nexus is actually one of the largest stakers in lido. So they just put 10% of their capital pool. So about 15,000 ETH into Lido, staked ETH. So I think them paradigm and three arrows are like the three largest depositors in Lido. They're earning about 2.32.4 e a day. And if you look at insurance companies, like traditional world insurance companies, most of them actually lose money in the core business, which is like premiums minus claims and expenses.
00:48:45.254 - 00:48:58.806, Speaker B: But they make that back up through investment earnings. And that's effectively, Nexus is already extremely profitable in their core business, but they're getting an extra revenue source from light of state deeds.
00:48:58.938 - 00:49:16.870, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. That pot of money, there's like 162,000 ether. It's like 335,000,000 or 40 million. I checked. It's Nexustracker IO. If anyone's wondering, that's what Richard built. But that amount of money.
00:49:16.870 - 00:49:20.850, Speaker A: Yeah, that is a very productive capital.
00:49:20.930 - 00:49:30.698, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you just have all that cash sitting around. You want to earn yield on the float. So that's how insurance companies just end up being investment vehicles, which is.
00:49:30.864 - 00:50:04.402, Speaker A: That's only 10% right now. In case anyone missed that, it's 10% of the pool is being used in that way. The rest of it at this point is not being used to earn, but there's ideas around how to put more of it to work without being vulnerable to, for example, if there were an exploit and you lost a certain amount of ether, you want to make sure that you have enough ether to cover all the claims for active covers in Nexus.
00:50:04.546 - 00:50:26.460, Speaker B: Yeah. And then there's investments like working groups that are now being formed in Nexus. So in the long run, they can even delegate money to fund managers and then fund managers, third party fund managers are responsible for earning yield. For know, that's kind of pretty far out in the long run.
00:50:26.930 - 00:51:12.778, Speaker A: Well, hey, Richard, I kept you way overtime, but just thanks so much. It's so good to catch up and just congrats on the continued killer investments you've made. I'm a big fan of just what you stand for, and I think these were two in particular where I was just like, there's so much utility behind this. I think one of the things I really love about the way that you've approached investing in Defi is it's not a spray and pray approach. I mean, you are making concentrated bets on what you can sit in long term. Anyways. These are two things, though, in particular, I think will really strengthen the defi community.
00:51:12.778 - 00:51:15.958, Speaker A: So just, yeah, keep up the awesome work, dude.
00:51:16.134 - 00:51:17.340, Speaker B: Cool, thanks.
00:51:18.430 - 00:51:38.606, Speaker A: And if anyone wants to follow you, they can follow you here on Twitter. Reminder to everyone to subscribe at defi. Dad. I'll continue to make free tutorials there and be doing live interviews like this. And. Yeah, I think that's about it. Anything in the comments? Nope.
00:51:38.606 - 00:51:45.870, Speaker A: We're all good to go. Richard, I'm going to just end the broadcast and we'll be in a green room. So thanks, everyone, for tuning in and have a great weekend.
