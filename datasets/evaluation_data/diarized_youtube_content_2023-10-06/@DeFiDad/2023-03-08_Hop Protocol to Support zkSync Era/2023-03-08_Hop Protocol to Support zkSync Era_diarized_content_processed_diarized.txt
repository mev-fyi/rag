00:00:13.332 - 00:00:41.650, Speaker B: Future hop products? The roll ups are what we do right now. We support two optimistic roll ups, but we don't support any ZK roll ups. Zk roll ups are for sure the future of Ethereum. We can at those instantly. We can just do so much more with them in terms of cross chain validation. And so we're excited to finally get our hands on this. We're excited about the upcoming mainnet release, and yeah, we're just excited about this entire ecosystem that's blossoming with Ethereum rollups.
