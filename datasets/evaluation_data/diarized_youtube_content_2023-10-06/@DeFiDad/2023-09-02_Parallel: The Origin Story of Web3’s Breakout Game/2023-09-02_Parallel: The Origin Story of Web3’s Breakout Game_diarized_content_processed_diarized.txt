00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.080, Speaker A: It was pretty organic. I think I just got tired of playing other games and I wanted to make something. I like making things. And I knew, you know, a bunch of my friends had really incredible talents, and if I could just put them together and tell a compelling story, which is the story of parallel, and if we could create a game, you know, and bring these people who I believed had the potential for, to do something really exceptional, that if I could bring them together, maybe we could make something really special.
00:00:24.610 - 00:00:25.360, Speaker B: You.
00:00:27.690 - 00:01:06.738, Speaker C: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad and I'm here with my colleague and co host from Fourth Revolution Capital, Nomadic. In this episode, we dive into the captivating universe of Parallel, a digital trading card game and Sci-Fi franchise having been in development for over two years. Its flagship TCG recently launched enclosed beta and is getting rave reviews. Parallel is a standout in the new world of web three gaming, and today we're joined by two of the cofounders, Halos and Mr. Gone, to talk about how they've gone about building this iconic universe and this compelling first version of their TCG. But make sure you listen to the end, because they aren't stopping at just this trading card game.
00:01:06.738 - 00:01:51.920, Speaker C: They have ambitions for multiple different game categories coming to market sooner than you think, such as parallel colony, the game where you interact and influence your AI avatar, who then acts anonymously based on their memory and influence.

00:02:58.198 - 00:03:03.190, Speaker B: The time is now. Join us to be part of the decentralized revolution.
00:03:04.570 - 00:03:43.730, Speaker A: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs. And today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account. If we zoom out, since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial rails.
00:03:47.130 - 00:04:28.690, Speaker B: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain UX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC. And native access to instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:29.510 - 00:04:53.322, Speaker C: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce Koji, aka Mr. Gon, who is the co founder and head of game development and design for Parallel. He also hosts the official podcast for Parallel called Life in Parallel. We're also joined by Parallel co founder Sasha Ak Kalos, who is also a lifelong TCG player and gamer, having worked on countless startups with Mr. Gone. So let's kick it off. Mr.
00:04:53.322 - 00:04:56.298, Speaker C: Gone and Kalos, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:56.384 - 00:04:56.682, Speaker D: Great.
00:04:56.736 - 00:04:57.930, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:04:58.080 - 00:04:59.578, Speaker D: Amazing. Thanks for having us.
00:04:59.664 - 00:05:59.050, Speaker C: Awesome, guys. Well, we're recording this really not too long after parallel beta has gone live, and so there's been a lot of positive feedback. I mean, first off, congrats on that. I know it's been long and coming. You've been developing this game for years, and so our goal here today is just to help tell that story of what has gone on since the start and what's the journey been like shipping this very early version of the game, which fortunately both nomadic and I have been playing it. And so I would encourage anyone after this podcast, the call to action is to go to parallel life, download the beta, and just start playing. But anyways, we're hoping, too, that we can garner some lessons from you because you have been, I think, a very notable, if not like, the top sort of success story of the crypto bear market in terms of web three gaming.
00:05:59.050 - 00:06:17.910, Speaker C: So, anyways, let's talk about your backgrounds. First. If someone hasn't listened to life in parallel and heard all of the origin stories. Yeah, could you guys just give us a bit about what originally drew you into gaming and then also would like to get your crypto origin stories? So anyways, Mr. Gong, you want to kick us off?
00:06:18.060 - 00:07:18.626, Speaker D: Sure. What drew us into gaming? Well, for Ray, I was an only child, so I think my parents just wanted me to get out of their hair, so they just shoved a Nintendo in my face, and I was more than happy to go down that path. So, yeah, I started with an NES, and from there I was just like, oh, this is way better than friends. So I just decided to play video games for the rest of my life, essentially. And then, thankfully, I did make some friends, including Kaylos at a point. We actually met in university, and we've been working in technology ever since we left school, which is hilarious because we both studied. So we started working in tech, and this is sort of an abridged version, but basically in COVID, we were using games like Call of Duty and Apex and Hearthstone and all these things to play against each other and talk rather than just be on the phone or a Zoom call or something, because it's not really our mode.
00:07:18.626 - 00:08:02.038, Speaker D: And so we were playing these video games, talking to each other. And at one point, and this is all credit to Kayos, because I've always wanted to make a game. I've messed around with board games before, but Kalos was just like, hey, why don't we all just get together and try and make a video game? And at that same time, we had another friend of ours who we had worked with prior and is a very accomplished and capable artist who wanted to dabble in NFTs. He had heard a bunch of his friends were having success. This was before all the beeple stuff, before the explosion. He was suggesting that he might want to work on NFTs. And again, to Chaos's credit, he was like, wait, let's halt both of these things.
00:08:02.038 - 00:08:25.306, Speaker D: We can probably smash them together and make something like crazy. And there's more to the story. And chaos will fill you in, because when it comes to how we got to crypto, he'll be a lot more verbose on that. But basically, we smashed those two things together and decided to make a game. And from my perspective, I remember getting a call and saying, okay, we were talking about making a game. I know that you have an idea. Ready? We're going to meet on Friday.
00:08:25.306 - 00:08:53.398, Speaker D: And I was like, absolutely, let's do it. And I had no idea, but I knew that NFTs were about ownership. And I love card games. I grew up playing magic and Hearthstone and Rooter and Android, net runner and all these other games. And so I kind of decided, like, it's got to be a card game because card games are about trading and ownership and whatever, outside of the actual game itself. So it just made sense to me. And then I think two nights before we had the phone call, I remember waking up in the middle of the night.
00:08:53.398 - 00:09:22.640, Speaker D: It started with the whole banking thing. I came up with that, scribbled it in my notebook, and that was sort of the basis for parallel from a game design standpoint. And then we met and we decided to do this whole thing, and now here we are. But my intro to crypto was basically me yelling at Kalos, being like, don't let this up. My like, I just want to make a game for. I'll let Kaylo spill in the rest.
00:09:23.990 - 00:10:06.880, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. I mean, it's so funny to hear the story retold, right? But, yeah, I got into games when I was pretty young. My parents bought me a Sega genesis for Christmas, and I always wanted a Nintendo, but I was always jealous of the Nintendo kids. And obviously that stuck with me over the years, and I just played a ton of different games. And then when I was young, the forbidden fruit for me was magic cards. And my mom was particularly religious and she thought they were like the devil's work because they had skeletons and stuff all over them. So she threw out my magic cards, and I think that just forever put this thing in me that's like, I want trading cards and I want them to be really cool.
00:10:06.880 - 00:10:55.710, Speaker A: So I got into games pretty early on and stayed with them. I ran one of the largest clans on one of the very first kind of third person, or first person shooters that was multiplayer, was called Starsheed Tribes. And I was selling skins, actually back in like, this had to be like 92 or something. Anyways. And then I got into crypto really early on. I had spent eleven years in finance working for a large bank, designing software solutions for executives across stock trading systems, anti money laundering and conterras financing systems. And in my time there, I came across the bitcoin white paper and I was like, this is super interesting.
00:10:55.710 - 00:11:32.486, Speaker A: And I started to try and socialize it. Obviously no one cared at a bank. And being for Toronto, I was fortunate enough to be really early and hear about Ethereum really early on and make friends with people like Ethan Buckman, who's the founder of Cosmos, he's an amazing guy and just be networked in the ecosystem and meet people who are doing awesome stuff. And so I got involved pretty early on and just stayed involved and tried to support things and make things that I thought were really. Mr. Gon does really a good job telling the story of how it all happened. It was pretty organic.
00:11:32.486 - 00:12:11.990, Speaker A: I think I just got tired of playing other games and I wanted to make something. I like making things. And I knew a bunch of my friends had really incredible talents and if I could just put them together and tell a compelling story, which is the story of parallel these humans that are all separated for thousands of years and they're all human, but they're all different. And if we could create a game and bring these people who I believed had the potential to do something really exceptional, that if I could bring them together, maybe we could make something really special. And I'm just really good at convincing my friends that there might be something there when we don't know yet. And so it kind of worked out.
00:12:12.060 - 00:12:16.280, Speaker D: I mean, I think that's a nice way of saying he's really good at convincing his friends to work for free.
00:12:16.810 - 00:12:52.034, Speaker A: We did work for free. For the first year, no one made anything because we were focused on just like trying to get all the art working and getting more people to help. It's been a crazy ride. It's only been two years, right? And in that time we've created an IP that is super compelling and really loved by a lot of people. And a game, the first variant of a game, and I think you look at that in comparison to timelines of traditional game making, and like Hearthstone took what, five or six years? And they had the. So like, we're speed running this shit and I think we're doing a really. I'm proud of the team, I'm really proud of the work they've done.
00:12:52.034 - 00:12:57.750, Speaker A: I think we have a lot more to do. But out of the gate, really good first step I wasn't aware of.
00:12:57.820 - 00:13:10.598, Speaker C: How long were you working on the art or the story? The IP here before the first NFT collection, Ps 15 okay, I'll take a.
00:13:10.604 - 00:13:55.800, Speaker A: Crack at this, Koji, and then you can hop in here. So I had kind of laid out a high level story that I thought essentially what happened was I was watching Star wars films, I was watching Marvel, and it started to feel like, as I was killing time during COVID and it started to feel like we were on d string storylines or the d string storylines were starting to appear where it was like, we're not telling the core story anymore. We're trying to create sub arcs, and this isn't a shot at them. I think this happens with almost every IP is like, you tell an incredible story, people love it. They want more. You start to tell the substories of substories of substories, and it just kind of becomes a little less compelling. And so I kind of came up with this general story that I wanted to tell and started socializing it.
00:13:55.800 - 00:15:11.230, Speaker A: But at the same time, it didn't really get flushed out before the game came out, before the cards came out, I think it became like the card game is the pre production. So typically the way this works is there's a team that is spending a year or so of our team crafting all these pieces, telling the source, creating the characters, just down to the most minute detail. And I think we did it in real time, where the TCG, as it became the base set of cards, was the pre production, and it allowed us to fund the development of it by releasing packs every quarter. As we flushed out the world more and more, I think we still look at it that way, which is know as we're working on it, there's a number of teams as cards are created. The comics team is drawing on some of the new vehicles and understanding how the art team is seeing where the earth and are going and being, becoming more identifying more technically advanced communities within the earthen society. And so I think as we develop the TCG, what we're essentially doing is pre production work that everyone gets to watch in real time rather than do the pre production work and then make a game.
00:15:11.300 - 00:15:17.622, Speaker E: I just want to call out a few things before I get into this next question. I was also a Nintendo bro, so, Mr. Gon.
00:15:17.706 - 00:15:18.580, Speaker A: Love it.
00:15:19.190 - 00:15:37.302, Speaker E: And then I love what you're saying, too, just about keeping up these friendships at a distance through playing games. I have a best friend that it's so weird. We don't even talk on the phone. I don't think we've ever called each other in the last probably six years, but literally just play Apex legends together and catch up like, oh, so you met a new girl.
00:15:37.356 - 00:15:37.574, Speaker A: Cool.
00:15:37.612 - 00:15:38.618, Speaker E: What's she like?
00:15:38.784 - 00:15:39.114, Speaker A: Wow.
00:15:39.152 - 00:15:46.380, Speaker E: We're, like, killing people in Apex. That's where our discussion takes place now. And it's just so interesting.
00:15:46.990 - 00:15:47.450, Speaker A: Okay.
00:15:47.520 - 00:15:58.058, Speaker E: There's so many different ways we can go here, but I want to just address what parallel is. So maybe one of you can give the abridged lore backstory.
00:15:58.234 - 00:15:59.518, Speaker A: I urge everybody to go to the.
00:15:59.524 - 00:16:20.342, Speaker E: Website and just read up on that and experience it yourselves. But, yeah, if one of you can kind of just dive into the parallel lore kind of backstory, and then if the other could maybe just give listeners a primer just on what is a TCG game. I know we've referenced a few games already, but just kind of the general, quick, high level mechanics of how they work.
00:16:20.396 - 00:16:21.400, Speaker A: That'd be great.
00:16:22.170 - 00:16:54.410, Speaker D: Sure. Yeah. I feel like I've done this song and dance a bunch of times in the not so distant past, so hopefully I can do it justice. But basically, the initial story for parallel takes place in the not too distant future, where scientists have believed they have discovered a source of infinitely renewable energy. And all they need to do is go through this experiment that requires the use of the small. What is it? The Hedron Collider.
00:16:54.570 - 00:16:55.722, Speaker A: Large Hadron Collider.
00:16:55.786 - 00:17:18.546, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry. The large hydron collider. And what actually ends up happening is massive disaster. So the experiment is a failure, and in fact, it's going to wipe out most of the world. And so, like, humans do, we sort of scatter. We just try and find a way to survive. We have a group of humans that goes off to colonize Mars, known as the Marcolians.
00:17:18.546 - 00:17:56.366, Speaker D: And they live a pretty regimented and militaristic life. We have a group known as the Cathari, who go off to Jupiter's moon. And because it's a bit of a frozen wasteland and the trek was so long, they had to find other ways of survival. And they basically created a bunch of genetically modified foods that left them infertile. So the way that they reproduce is through cloning. And so they're basically a race of clones who don't really fear deaths anymore. We have a group of people who actually just go out into deep space and survive by mining asteroids.
00:17:56.366 - 00:18:30.474, Speaker D: But because of the harsh realities of living in space, they have to augment their human bodies with robotic parts. And we call them the Ognswar. There's a group of people that, on their way out from Earth, get sucked into a black hole and reappear. When the game starts thousands and thousands of years later, as if no time has passed. But they're irrevocably changed by whatever happened to them on the other side of the black hole. And then finally, like every other human story, there are people that are left behind, and those people are left to fence for themselves. And some of them do survive.
00:18:30.474 - 00:19:04.906, Speaker D: And we call that group theorithim. They're forever changed by this disaster and somehow become more one with the earth. The game itself actually takes place thousands and thousands and thousands of years after this disaster. And it turns out the experiment was a success, but there was just a very large gestation period. All the other parallels have discovered that the earth is now energy rich and have come back to claim it as their own. But because of all the time that has passed, they've evolved in parallel, but very different from one another. So they're almost alien races from each other.
00:19:04.906 - 00:19:12.154, Speaker D: But if you asked any one of them, what are you? They would all say, we're human, and that is the story of parallel.
00:19:12.202 - 00:19:22.830, Speaker E: I think that was an incredible synopsis. Well done, Mr. Gunn. Maybe, Kalos, if you can kind of just break down the high level TCG mechanics, that'd be fantastic.
00:19:23.330 - 00:19:26.000, Speaker A: It's actually probably best served by gone.
00:19:26.690 - 00:19:27.322, Speaker D: He's.
00:19:27.386 - 00:19:30.900, Speaker A: As the game designer, I think he'd probably do it more justice than I would.
00:19:32.310 - 00:19:35.266, Speaker D: Yeah, I kind of screwed you on that one. I probably should have let you tell the story.
00:19:35.368 - 00:19:43.654, Speaker A: I was going to say there. I was like, you're going to go back to back if you take the first one, so now it's all you. Okay. Yeah.
00:19:43.692 - 00:20:47.766, Speaker D: So parallel is a trading card game, similar to games like magic, the gathering, or Hearthstone or Rooter, if you've played any of those. But if you haven't, essentially the game works sort of in a few phases before you actually even play the game. What you're trying to do is collect cards for the game and then craft your best 40 card deck in parallel. There are five different parallels which you just outlined, and your deck can only consist of cards from one of those parallels, and a set of cards we call the universal card pool. Those universal cards can be used in any deck. Once you've created a deck that you think is a winning deck, you take that deck and you queue up in currently a one v one match against somebody else on the Internet, and you're essentially drawing cards and playing them until someone's crowned a victor. The way that you play cards in parallel is when you once pertur, you can take a card from your hand and rather than play it for its ability so we have cards that are soldiers in your army.
00:20:47.766 - 00:21:25.170, Speaker D: We call those units. We have cards that are effects that are sort of one time use devastating abilities. We have relics, which are like items that live on the field that have an ongoing effect on the gameplay. And then we have upgrades, which are things that you equip to your soldiers to make them stronger. In order to play those cards, you once per turn can take a card from your hand and rather than use its ability, put it in what we call the bank. And that stores up energy for you to pay the cost to play your other cards. And as the game goes on, the amount of energy that you have in the bank increases if you continue to bank cards, allowing you to play even stronger cards.
00:21:25.170 - 00:21:32.870, Speaker D: Both you and your opponent have a life total, and once one of the players life totals hit zero, the other player wins.
00:21:33.030 - 00:22:02.814, Speaker C: I have never played any TCG previously. I've watched some live streams of Hearthstone and tried to watch some tutorials on magic and just had my brain explode onto the screen. And it's funny, so I fired it up. And I feel like what you just told that story, that actually would have really helped me because I just got in there and I was like, okay, where will this thing let me click? Okay, I can go to the bank. I can go to the bank.
00:22:02.942 - 00:22:03.234, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:03.272 - 00:22:04.258, Speaker C: I'm building up energy.
00:22:04.344 - 00:22:05.022, Speaker A: This is cool.
00:22:05.096 - 00:22:07.714, Speaker C: This is really cool. Now it's not my turn anymore.
00:22:07.762 - 00:22:08.454, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:22:08.572 - 00:22:53.554, Speaker C: Which cards can I use in anyways? That rookie mode, that beginner mode. It's really helpful to get folks started. So if you've never played a TCG, but it's always had you curious, this is such a great entry point into that. Actually, before we do talk more about parallel beta, just one more bit about your sort of origin story as parallel studios. Can you recall any part of your elevator pitch? Like, how did you raise money for something like this? Because it feels so obvious now for folks looking at it. Like, man, I wish I could have invested in parallel, but I'm sure it know as easy to pitch from the start.
00:22:53.752 - 00:22:59.438, Speaker D: Caleb's got to tell this story. Our initial investor story is probably one of the all timers.
00:22:59.614 - 00:23:05.766, Speaker A: Well, which part of the initial investor story were we pulling on? You mean Chad cold reach out on.
00:23:05.788 - 00:23:09.720, Speaker D: Twitter to one of the arguably most famous people on the.
00:23:10.570 - 00:23:37.842, Speaker A: I sent. I sent a DM to Chad Hurley, the founder of YouTube, co founder of YouTube. And I was like, hey, man, check this really cool car chain we're making out and it's going to be super dope. And here's how it works. And he's like, eagerly was like, this is sick, I'm in. And actually he's like, I want to be a working member with you guys. He's been on every team call with us every week without fail and just engaged and awesome to work with.
00:23:37.842 - 00:23:38.980, Speaker A: That guy's amazing.
00:23:39.750 - 00:23:47.710, Speaker E: That's like one of the best cold outreach DM stories I've ever heard. Could that have gone any better? Like, way to shoot your shot.
00:23:47.870 - 00:24:30.850, Speaker A: Yeah, it worked out really great. And then he was really cool and introduced us as we started to see some success to other great know like the first investor in Google and director of Google is an investor in us and JJ from the open source fund and paradigm. So we're really fortunate to be surrounded like NBA players and some really famous people who like to remain anonymous. And it's really cool. I mean, we were just really fortunate to have people see what we were doing and be like, yeah, this has legs to be a really important IP in the future. And it's a different story. It's compelling and we want to support you and see you realize this vision.
00:24:30.850 - 00:24:45.094, Speaker A: But, yeah, early on, I think we just really wanted to connect with people who actually connected with parallel. That was the goal, right? If someone was into it, we wanted to work with them.
00:24:45.292 - 00:25:23.346, Speaker D: And I think that we have to credit Oscar Mar for this, right? Basically, we walked into these meetings with Oscar's art. Just a few pieces, not even the full Ps 15 at that point. Just like Oscar's art. Sasha telling I just summarized the story of parallel, but Sasha had the whole grand thing that he was crafting and telling while we were in these meetings. And then I was, like, talking about how the game was going to work. And then I think it was just seeing all of our excitement and how almost passionate and sure of ourselves that we were at that point. Somehow, for some reason, they were like, these guys got it.
00:25:23.346 - 00:25:45.414, Speaker D: Because I could see you see the yard, you hear the story, everyone's loving it. And then I'm trying to explain the game, and everyone's eyes are like, glazing over. But at the same time, we had all the details ready to go. The systems were kind of in place. And so I feel like they were just like, these guys know what they're doing. They're really passionate about this story. And the art looks great, so let's let these guys have a shot.
00:25:45.414 - 00:26:07.314, Speaker D: Which just seems insane to me, looking back now. We literally just walked in this meeting a bunch of friends. I don't even know if I can tell this story, but we had a call once and somebody ripped a giant fart in the middle of one of these investor calls. And I was just like, what are we doing here? And they were still like, give these guys money.
00:26:07.432 - 00:26:08.686, Speaker A: That's like step brothers.
00:26:08.798 - 00:26:11.886, Speaker E: The scene when they're applying for the job and guy cuts a fart.
00:26:11.998 - 00:26:18.086, Speaker A: Unreal. That is all the investors are thinking. These guys. The audacity of these guys. I like it.
00:26:18.268 - 00:26:19.430, Speaker E: So confident.
00:26:20.090 - 00:27:23.130, Speaker C: You said something about finding folks that would connect with parallel. And I think that's one of the lessons in your story, is you have to find investors who are really like minded. And this has been a really rough last few years for founders who are raising, but you got to find folks who are. You don't need to sell them, you just need to show them essentially what you're building and they should already be on the same page as where you are. But you mentioned something about that they could tell that you knew what you were doing or that there was like some sort of proof point that you could execute on this. I think that's the part of it that's really hard for me to understand from the start. Do you recall anything about your story that would give confidence to investors that these guys are going to be able to execute? And again, I'm thinking before PS 15, I feel like once NFT collection started to launch, once the cards launched, to me that was the proof that you guys were able to execute.
00:27:23.550 - 00:27:33.134, Speaker D: I mean, we're just delusional and have irrational self confidence. I think that's what it comes down to. No, I'll let sack handle this one.
00:27:33.252 - 00:28:31.886, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we've worked on a number of things. Some encrypted, some not. Some of it's scaled on consumer mobile, north of a million users. I think really just kind of painting a picture of where you're going in the short term that is super logical and makes sense, paired with the attractiveness of excitement around NFTs at the time. And this concept of perpetual royalties, I think was pretty compelling for investors when they started to see something's work. I think the ability to deliver a good IP and a new market is a great combination and I think we were just fortunately timed. I think like any great entrepreneur or honest entrepreneur, maybe I should say, or maker or whatever you want to call them, will tell you there's always a little bit of luck in some of it.
00:28:31.886 - 00:29:06.700, Speaker A: And I'm pretty good at predicting things, but I think there's always a little luck in that. And we, you know, I think the market moved in the right ways at the right times while we were having the right conversations to be able to somehow serendipitously find ourselves in a position of favor. And then on top of that, there's a lot of hard work. Right? There's a lot like that saying, the harder you work, the luckier you get. I think putting yourself into that opportunity zone by doing the work was obviously something that favored us as well.
00:29:09.950 - 00:29:47.558, Speaker D: This isn't revisionist history, but I also think that when we were trying to sell the vision to people or explain it to people, we weren't like, hear us out, guys. We're going to sell a bunch of NFTs and make a bunch of money because I feel like that happened a lot after the fact. It was like, NFTs are really hot right now, so we'll be able to sell them and make money. That was never our story. We were just like, here's a bit of tech that we find really interesting, and we're going to use it to make this game better. And it was always about the game and the experience, even before the game came out. I mean, obviously it's just come out now in a larger scale for people to get their hands on it.
00:29:47.558 - 00:30:30.840, Speaker D: But even our NFT opening experiences, right. It was really important for us not just to have people go to a website, put in like, I want three of these, and then hit send on a send me east button or whatever. It was like, okay, you go through this experience of seeing what parallel is. You get the NFTs, they come in these packs, there's this video, it all opens. It was all about the fun and the experience of it from the beginning, more so than it was like, hey, we're just going to sell these things to make money. And I don't want to be reductive of other projects, but I feel like some people thought about gaming and the experience as an afterthought after they sold the NFTs, as opposed to like, why are we doing this from the beginning? And I think we were pretty clear minded about what we were trying to do.
00:30:31.210 - 00:30:53.786, Speaker E: Yeah, so well said, both of you guys. I remember the early messaging coming out was just so compelling, even before we saw anything. Myself as like, now a user and player of the game. I got to get this out there. I made my parallel account, March 2021. So I'm pretty early activation of the account, and I saw something that I liked. Quick story.
00:30:53.786 - 00:31:16.994, Speaker E: I missed the first drop and I was mortified. I had to go to a bachelor party. I live in an island. I went to a smaller island that had the spottiest, sketchiest Wi fi, like telecom, you name it. And I missed the first drop. And to this day, I've never forgiven myself. I just saw the parallel NfT assets kind of go almost like parabolic since that day.
00:31:16.994 - 00:31:21.814, Speaker E: And I think it was like summer 2021 or something like that. But anyways, no matter.
00:31:21.932 - 00:31:24.998, Speaker C: You could have just bought the top of the parabola like, I did.
00:31:25.084 - 00:31:26.230, Speaker A: I did my job.
00:31:26.380 - 00:31:35.146, Speaker C: I waited until the parabola had topped out, and I was like, this is a great time to buy. Let's buy all of these and as many as I can.
00:31:35.248 - 00:31:36.810, Speaker E: Yeah, high conviction.
00:31:37.230 - 00:31:57.490, Speaker A: This is why I'm consistently saying when people say stuff like on Twitter, I'm like, be right. Like, I think we want people to obviously have fun and see incredible value in everything we're doing. Right? But, yeah, I think in the early days, I was, like, screaming from the rooftops, like, responsible, and people were like, bullish.
00:32:00.790 - 00:32:18.290, Speaker E: Yeah, we'll get into more parallel stuff. Just like, this is all just so fun, just kind of reminiscing and talking about all this. And can you guys, before I ask this next question, can you guys just tell me the closed beta will end like there's a stop point and then people can't play, or can we continue to play in the closed beta?
00:32:18.450 - 00:32:26.906, Speaker D: It'll never end. Well, slow beta will turn into open beta at a point, but we're not keeping people out. Once you're in, now you're in.
00:32:27.008 - 00:32:39.998, Speaker A: Yeah, we don't want to turn the game off. Yeah, we don't ever want to turn the game off again. I think we want to just continue to patch the build and increase, put new features in, put new fixes in different things and just let it evolve with the player base.
00:32:40.164 - 00:33:10.170, Speaker E: Guys, at the time of this recording, the closed parallel beta is ongoing. And sentiment on Twitter, our little corner of Twitter has been off the charts. I don't know that I've seen a web three game in recent memory generate this much buz and this is a closed beta. So how is this feeling right now? What kind of lessons are you guys getting? Are there things that you're like, you already see you need to tweak from this, or what are you thinking?
00:33:10.320 - 00:33:46.434, Speaker D: Oh, my God. I'll go really shortly and then I'll let kales go. But I'm very happy that people are excited and happy and are playing and all the positive sentiment and whatever is definitely fuel to keep going. It's a lot nicer to go on Twitter and see people being like, oh, this game is great, as opposed to, like, when's this fucking game coming out? Or whatever. But I am a perfectionist. And when I look at what we've done, I do think it's great, and I'm really happy. But at the same time, I'm like, it needs this and it needs that, and I want to see this, and I want to see that.
00:33:46.434 - 00:34:21.502, Speaker D: And so much of the feedback we've gotten are things that are already on the list, but we wanted it in people's hands. We wanted to see how people could take to it. So I think for me, it's a bit of a double edged sword. I should bask in a little bit because I think you should try and celebrate your victories. But at the same time, we barely have time to catch our breath because this is just the tip of the spear. We want this game to be not just a great web three game, but a fucking amazing just game. I want it to be on everybody's lips that plays card games or whatever.
00:34:21.502 - 00:34:45.510, Speaker D: And so many people like D five. Dad has said, I've never played a card game before, and now I've played this one, and I'm hooked. I'm like, yeah, let's go. Let's tap it in the veins of all these other gamers that don't know what card games are and get them hooked, too. But in order to do that, we need to keep building. So I'm not good at stopping to smell the roses, but I'll let Kayla's pick up from there.
00:34:45.580 - 00:34:51.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. I think it's not about being successful. It's about how long you're successful.
00:34:51.638 - 00:34:52.010, Speaker D: Right.
00:34:52.080 - 00:35:30.582, Speaker A: I think that's a better metric. And our success metric is scale. Right? Like, we designed this game to scale. And what that means is both traditional gamers and web three players can both play the game, and we want to see it realize its potential. And our ambitions for the game are much greater than what we've achieved to date. And so me particularly barking orders, often at times at my team, and having really high expectations of what we want to achieve, I think it just feels like a good day zero. It feels like day Zero.
00:35:30.582 - 00:35:55.226, Speaker A: It doesn't feel like, oh, yeah, we did it. Like, let's go pop bottles of champagne or something. It feels like, cool. We didn't go down. The servers stayed online, and people like what they're getting so far. But you really need to have a great. When someone hears a great song, if your second song isn't just as good, if not better than the first song.
00:35:55.226 - 00:36:18.274, Speaker A: It's like disappointing. And so it's really about where we go from here and dialing in the team and the priorities to achieving much greater things than just isolated success within fan base today. It has to be for everybody. So I think our ambitions and our appetite for more are quite material.
00:36:18.402 - 00:37:03.662, Speaker C: Guys, why don't we talk a little bit about the development of these nfts cards and other in game assets and just how that's going to play into what will soon be like an open beta. So just some background too for folks who are newer to parallel some of the references we've made to like a PS 15. These were early collections of cards that lots of us who were enthusiastic, got excited about and were able to buy. And it was like an early way to show support and get involved in the community and so on. But now we're at a point where we can actually play with these. But what's great is if you get into the parallel beta, you don't have to pay anything to get started. You could just start playing.
00:37:03.662 - 00:37:27.126, Speaker C: And so I'm wondering if you could give us the abridged version of how are you thinking about those cards that folks have collected over the long run, and maybe some of the more high impact in game assets aside from the cards that you're excited to see come to life with the open beta?
00:37:27.318 - 00:37:55.570, Speaker A: Sure, maybe I'll start gone and we could just kind of work together on this one. So I think it's worth identifying some of the kind of monikers we use for these cards. So AP stands for apparition, it means a non NFT card. So that way someone who doesn't have a wallet, doesn't understand NFTs, can just go play the game. Then you have FE cards, which are first editions. They're kind of like the standard version of the card. You have special edition se versions, and you have pls, which are perfect loops.
00:37:55.570 - 00:38:49.782, Speaker A: And then you have AR, which is autograph, which is like a card with a signature on it that you've paid a fee in the prime, the ERC 20 to obtain. And so there's lots of different variants of cards. The way the card ecosystem works in this design is when you think about a card game. Like the largest addition size of a card in parallel's ecosystem is probably 50 or 60,000 cards, and that's a common card that's kind of like the most widely available version of a card. And as you have traditional gamers come in and play and they start to realize that they can win prime, the ERC 20 reward for ranked wins, they're probably going to want cards as well. And so one of the mechanics in the game is that you're able to replicate, and this is coming online shortly, you're able to replicate cards. So if you have a first edition card or a special edition card, you can pay a small fee in prime and create another card.
00:38:49.782 - 00:39:39.898, Speaker A: And what that means is that as parallel succeeds and scales, the community and cardholder base are the ones who meet any subsequent demand for cards from an NFT standpoint. So I think that's really important because it really creates like a positive sum game between the studio and the player base. I think that's like something we haven't really seen. I think we've seen positive sum games between studios and development houses who modify games where they're like, oh, if you make a mod for this game, we'll give you 20% of the revenue or something, but we've never really seen it at the player level. So I'm excited about that. And we have a number of, in the one of the upcoming builds, we have a number of cosmetic treatments that will differentiate these cards on the board. So when you play like an autograph card, it shows the signature flashing today in the beta, if you have one, it's just like a flex.
00:39:39.898 - 00:40:26.738, Speaker A: If you play a special edition card, it'll have a different treatment than a first edition card. And so there's a number of variations of cards. They vary in rarity and the most widely available one would be essentially a non NFT card, just so everyone can come in and play. And the incentive for them to convert to playing with NFT cards is every time they win and rank, they're going to be met with this condition screen that says, you won zero prime, but you would have won X. And I think that is a pretty compelling opportunity for us to be able to take people who really enjoy a game, really enjoy an IP, and be like, why am I not participating in this? I could be earning prime and using it to buy skins or buy other things that I could use to further my collection in the space. So I think that's something.
00:40:26.824 - 00:41:06.754, Speaker D: One of the other things that we're doing, I don't even know if we've talked about this and maybe I shouldn't, but here we are. I'm just going to do it anyway. Is also we have other classes of items that are sort of more cosmetically based. So emotes and skins for your paragons, I should mention that in the game, each deck has a paragon associated, which is like the general of your army. It kind of bestows your deck with a passive ability that helps inform your play. And then when you can afford to play your general, you can put them on the field. And they usually have pretty powerful effects, but those are represented by 3d figures on the bottom left hand and top left hand corners of the screen.
00:41:06.754 - 00:42:00.722, Speaker D: And those 3d figures will be customizable, both their appearance, but also their voice lines. But one of the things that I don't know if we've talked about yet really is actually in our battle pass. We're going to be offering these skins and emotes if you make it to a certain level in the battle pass. And one of the things that we're doing that will also hopefully entice non NFC players to potentially convert to the tech is the skins and emotes that you earn will only be available for that season. So once the season's over, you won't be able to get that skin and emote again. But if you've earned it, there'll be a window of time in which you can convert it from just an in game asset to an NFT. So imagine a world where you were playing Apex and you earned this pretty rare gun in season two or whatever, and now it's like season twelve, and no one will ever see that gun again.
00:42:00.722 - 00:42:50.222, Speaker D: And if you stop playing, that asset is just going to sit on your account forever. Well, what we've decided to do is allow you to convert those rarer assets to NFTs and then transfer them or do whatever with them at any point after that. So you can see where a free player or free web two player, whatever, non web three native might earn a pretty rare skin and think to themselves like, oh, I should convert this and put it in my back pocket just in case, because something crazy could happen later. As like a card collector, we all know things like the Black Lotus or the rare pokemon cards or whatever, even if you don't play those games, you know those stories. And so you would almost be foolish to not sort of convert those things. And so that's one of the systems that we're going to be working on to try and convert some web two people.
00:42:50.356 - 00:43:56.566, Speaker A: I think in addition to that, just to add a little bit more context, I think card games are really interesting in that as you continue to create expansion sets which kind of shake up the game on a semiannual basis, the prior sets become more valuable. It's like a one case where as you issue new assets, you broaden the player base, but the assets that are older become more valuable. Like if you look at the original magic cards, the original Pokemon cards, right. Each subsequent set tends to be bigger and you can't really look at it like traditional dilution in that it's not diluting the same functionality of the original cards, it's just adding more functionality and broadening the player base. But it's just really interesting to think about because we have obviously planet fall, our first expansion set we've been working on. We started to reveal cards on our Twitter account for that set. And I think as these things happen, as these seasons pass, as these expansions come out, I think we're going to look with more and more rose colored glasses at the base set and be like, yeah, that was like the golden era, right?
00:43:56.748 - 00:44:55.050, Speaker E: You actually just answered and walked through so many things that I wanted to ask you about there. So just a couple that I want to kind of reiterate that I think are so key and integral to kind of keeping this economic side of the game going and thriving with the gameplay. You kalos addressed kind of this issue of dilution. But also dilution doesn't really happen traditionally in a TCG potentially. But I think it's so wise to kind of bring in those early NFT asset holders and say, look, when we do expand the user base, the card base, there's something in it for you. And that is so novel and like an interesting mechanic that can only really be done through this kind of crypto version of a TCG. And one quick aside, so I was really into NBA top shot, which similar concept of taking a collectible and making it an NFT.
00:44:55.050 - 00:45:29.560, Speaker E: And I remember when dapper Labs was going through addressing the dilution problem and the unfortunate kind of impact was a lot of the early holders and kind of big whales in that community ended up not liking the direction they took. They kind of went in a rapid expansion mode, kind of at the kind of like not really catering at all to some of the early big holders and users. So to kind of build in this win win mechanism is, I think, ingenious, something that needs to be done.
00:45:30.330 - 00:45:32.182, Speaker A: I feel like really, you guys are.
00:45:32.316 - 00:46:03.380, Speaker E: Becoming trailblazers of adding these sustainable economic models into web three, which is what we really need to do. So to that, I would also just love one of you to kind of talk through how you're thinking about prime, how it's going to impact the gameplay, how you're approaching this balancing act, that to this point we've seen nobody really do. I think there's maybe more coming, and I think a lot of people are, to be honest, watching what you're doing. But whoever wants to take that one.
00:46:04.070 - 00:46:13.220, Speaker D: Yeah. If there's anyone unqualified to talk about prime, it's definitely me. So I think I'll let you handle it.
00:46:13.830 - 00:47:11.750, Speaker A: Okay, so, I mean, I'm going to rewind the clock a bit and just kind of tell the story of how this all came to be. So we created this thing called the prime proposal and established the foundation with a bunch of community members who elected the first council to govern the foundation. That is the kind of governing body that resides over prime, the ERC 20 token. And that token is earned via playing the game for ranked wins only, and its emission rates are dependent on how many cards of your 40 card deck that you're playing with in ranked are nfts. So when it comes to, I don't want to claim victory in any capacity yet, I'm very much like, let's look at the data together. I think a lot of what we've done, and even when we created the prime proposal, it was not like, here's a white paper, get on side, let's just go down this road. It was more like, hey, what's wrong with it? And we made a ton of adjustments from the community's feedback.
00:47:11.750 - 00:48:45.506, Speaker A: And really we are trying to essentially factor in. One of the fundamental problems around games that have emissions of tokens with a fixed supply is you end up kind of having this super high burn it, like kind of a rise, meteoric rise in the token's value, and then a collapse usually at some point. And the way we've kind of looked at it is how do we create more of a cyclical economy where, yes, the studio is able to earn a small percentage of the total prime throughput, benefiting us as we make assets and continue to develop the game. But how do we sync the vast majority of it? How do we give people compelling things that they can spend it on and recycle it back into the play to earn pool, so that there's never a time where the play to earn pool becomes like 2% and the circulating supply is extremely high. And so I think we're now arriving at the place where we're going to be starting to see the data from some of these systems, and we're all going to be able to look at it and say, hey, how is this doing? And I think from the total circulating supply today, approximately, I think, just under 5% has already been sunk into autographs, into payload, into different mechanisms we've created. And I think that's what maybe is a bit different here. If anyone who's listening and is making something is saying, oh, I'm just going to copy whatever they're doing, don't look at the data with us, and maybe you can make something better.
00:48:45.506 - 00:49:27.266, Speaker A: And let's observe it together. And if you have feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to hear it. But I think ultimately the way this works is like, and there's a lot that's clever here, because if you want to make cards right, like we were talking about earlier, these echoes, you obviously have to spend prime to make them. But to earn that, to get that, you have two choices. You can go buy it, probably not the best way to go, or you can just play in ranked mode and grind that and win. And so you can play keeping our cues full, keeping it competitive, because you have an incentive to go and buy a skin, or go and create another card, or go and hit payload and get another card, or all kinds of different options.
00:49:27.266 - 00:50:00.150, Speaker A: Go buy some cosmetics, because there's going to be cosmetic skins and emotes that are only available in prime. And so I think the objective here is really to create a sustainable kind of ecosystem. And the only way to do that is to sync sufficient amounts of prime. And the only way to sync sufficient amounts of prime is to create compelling products. And that is how I see it right now. And I think whether or not we're successful at it will be dependent on the results and data, and I think we should observe that carefully and make adjustments as needed.
00:50:00.320 - 00:50:51.946, Speaker E: So, guys, just kind of putting my own investor hat on here in the fundraising process, obviously you raise probably a safe with a token warrant, and safe stands for simple agreement for future equity with this token warrant, so investors get exposure to the prime token. I want to know how you guys kind of deal with, if VCs want to get liquidity on an investment sooner, what happens when they start selling the token? To me, there's always this kind of like imbalance, I guess that goes with choosing long aligned good partners, but it's inevitably going to happen in many of these arrangements. So how do you guys view that as builders on the founder side? Walk us through that.
00:50:52.128 - 00:51:26.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I think investors have already started correctly. I could be corrected here, but I'm pretty sure investors have already started to vest and the tokens rising, which is nice. That's really at the foundation's credit. So shout out to everyone who works the echelon Foundation. Echelon Prime foundation. You guys are doing a great think, you know, anyone who's selling it doesn't matter if it's equity or tokens or whatever. For argument's like, the question is, do you think we've fulfilled our potential and we've reached our maximum value? I think we're just getting started.
00:51:26.774 - 00:51:35.926, Speaker A: And if someone does need to take, be it an investor or an investor in one of our equity or warrants.
00:51:35.958 - 00:51:36.700, Speaker D: Or whatever.
00:51:38.430 - 00:52:25.034, Speaker A: Or a person who just holds cards, a collector, if someone needs to pace for something in their lives, I don't think there's any ever a time you should be antifragile, right in this capacity. We shouldn't die because someone needed to sell something. And if something goes down, that's okay. It doesn't mean that it's not going to go back up. And so I very much look at it like, where are we on the horizon of our ambition to achieve greatness? I would say, like, if this is the curve we're like here. And so if you need to, if someone had to do something, that was, be it at a personal level or at a business level, I wouldn't really have much to say other than like, that's okay, but you left value on the table, and that's their business discretion. That's their discretion to make.
00:52:25.034 - 00:52:50.290, Speaker A: And I wouldn't shame it the same way we wouldn't shame it on the personal level, I wouldn't shame it on the business level. But I think also play long term games with long term partners. Right? Having said that, I'm not speaking, when I say all this stuff, I'm not speaking about any investor or any collector who I know of or has done something like this. I'm just speaking generally.
00:52:50.950 - 00:53:25.294, Speaker D: I just think I would also add that we haven't been around that long in the grand scheme of things. Like Kales was know, it's been like two years in earnest. But we've seen things ebb and flow. We obviously hit the NFT market at a really great time in the beginning, and then things kind of died down and there were rumblings like, oh, this project, whatever. I don't know if the game's too hard. I don't know if people are going to play the card game or I don't know if these guys are actually going to be able to do it. And we kind of have come through the other end and now people are able to play the game or whatever.
00:53:25.294 - 00:54:11.466, Speaker D: And so things will eb and flow if somebody sells, they sell. But I think that we, as a group of people, believe in what we're doing strongly enough that we'll come out the other end unscathed. I should also mention that it turns out that a lot of our investors are also just cyclotic gamers, apparently, or just love parallel because a few of them cornered me and were like, you have to play my decks, and I was like, oh, my God, and they were correcting my plays. So I think that kind of bodes well for their belief in what we're doing. And, yeah, I think it comes down to what you guys were saying. It's just like we pick the partners that we think will fit with us the best. And to Kaylos'point, at the end of the day, they're going to do what they're going to know.
00:54:11.466 - 00:54:14.878, Speaker D: We just have to believe in what we're doing strongly enough that we can make it at the other end.
00:54:14.964 - 00:54:20.318, Speaker A: Yeah, I think especially in entrepreneurship or building something like this, you can only control what you can control.
00:54:20.404 - 00:54:20.894, Speaker D: Right.
00:54:21.012 - 00:54:59.642, Speaker A: And already you feel quite helpless. I feel like a very big ship and very small rudder at times. And so I think trying to control something that you can't control is, like, totally a waste of energy. Like, focus on something you can do that you can be productive with. But, yeah, I don't think we're fortunate. I think in that our partners are great, and, yeah, I'd say find great people who care about what you're doing and believe in what you're doing as much as we care about it. And I think if you find those people, it's nice.
00:54:59.642 - 00:55:29.480, Speaker A: Sure, when things go up, but at the end of the day, they still call and talk more about Nerf, this cart, or, like, shroud's, too op. You got to banish that. There's too much banish. It's just like, that's more of a conversation right now than again. Obviously, one of our objectives is to build value, right. And as a company, as a network, all these things, and everyone knows that. But I think over indexing on that actually can hurt that sometimes.
00:55:30.250 - 00:56:25.970, Speaker C: I think a part of what drew me into parallel is understanding what was driving you guys as a team. Like, this is why I started buying cards and just got kind of sucked into the Sci-Fi franchise that was in development. Whether you're an investor looking to invest in a startup or you're a startup looking to get investors on board, you really have to understand what is the driving force behind those folks. And I'll say, like, a lot of my conversations through this, the crypto winter have been trying to seek out and understand what gets builders up in the morning. You can quickly read through a deck and see folks who say that they want to build something similar to parallel that, oh, we're going to build this incredible TCG with all this IP.
00:56:26.050 - 00:56:26.680, Speaker A: But.
00:56:28.510 - 00:57:30.010, Speaker C: If you can start to actually sense again the driving force, the passions behind that, which also still have to be balanced with an ability to execute, you can really start to weed out who does and does not belong in this space. And actually, I think that the last few years have proven that there's a hell of a lot more problems on the investor side of the crypto web three gaming space. I think there's a lot more corruption and misaligned incentives on the investor side. I'll go as far as saying that I think a majority of the folks out there investing alongside the types of stuff that we're interested in. I was much more positive a few years ago. Now I feel like it's just a pool of Larps. I keep thinking that there's more people who are digging into like it's someone like I think it was it K Voc we were talking about who wanted you to play one of his decks.
00:57:30.010 - 00:58:53.910, Speaker C: That's really telling to me of the kind of partner you have in him as an investor. Whereas if I have to have one more conversation with someone in the space and quickly discover that they're not using any of the applications developed in the DFI space, they're not playing any of the games being built out in the web three gaming space, I'm just going to lose my mind. So anyways, what I mean to say is a part of what drives us on the Edge podcast is trying to uncover teams that we think are doing really impactful work that more folks should be aware of and sort of finding that edge and discovering those different projects and how to get involved. And the real edge here is that we're just so early on in this parallel beta and there is this cult like community. I mean that as a compliment that is so active in the discord right now. Now it's all about the game before, to give credit to folks who were already there, it was all about the IP being developed and talking about what you could possibly do with those cards that were in development. But now it's, it's really, it's such a purest sort of sanctuary of, of our sector.
00:58:53.910 - 00:59:51.978, Speaker C: So this kind of segues actually though, into questions about parallel colony. So over the last. Gosh, I don't know if it's just been a few months, but at some point, even for someone like me, who I thought I was keeping up with everything you guys were working on. And then it felt like it came out of left field that we had this colony game where you're essentially allowing your assets to be played by an AI. I'm going to let you tell the story of it, but I think it's another example of this team leaning into the most bleeding edge tech that allows you to create an even more fun game and allow you to distribute the game and create a more engaging game. But guys, can you walk us through, I guess, what is parallel colony? And maybe just like a high level overview of how that type of gameplay should play out.
00:59:52.144 - 01:00:42.838, Speaker A: Maybe I'll just talk a bit about it at a high level and you could talk about how it plays and stuff. Okay, so I think we share one thing here, which is like, these technologies are really like any combination of an innovative form of technology, be it ar AI, blockchain, we want to utilize it in ways that make things better. And we had interest, obviously, as we've been developing the TCG, we've been creating. Every time you have a card, we create a 3d corresponding object. So like, if you look up the Lancer tank, you probably saw along the way a 3d version in AR of Lancer tank. Or if you look at supply drop the card, you probably saw Lar, which is the rifle that's depicted on it. So as we've been creating these cards, we've been creating this 3d library of assets.
01:00:42.838 - 01:01:43.770, Speaker A: And we started to explore what that might look like creating games in UE five. And the problem that essentially occurred was as we were looking at these different kind of versions of games, it became pretty apparent to me that categories, you'd have to create a new category of game. And the reason is you think ARPG, you probably think Diablo. We don't want to be kind of second in position to someone who created a category. We'd rather make the category. And so we started working with the data science and AI team internally quite a while ago to start to explore what it might look like if we gave a wallet, a 6551 wallet, to an avatar, which is our character, which one of the characters within a collection of characters from the parallel world. And essentially you're able to talk to this character and the character is able to obtain items from the simulation.
01:01:43.770 - 01:02:05.470, Speaker A: And so everything in the world is scarce. And it works a lot like mining. Like they have to go to the mine, literally to get raw resources. And when they do, they get an 1155 deposited to their wallet. And then because it took time to get that resource and it's scarce in the simulation, everyone has to do the same work to get one. But there's an RNG on what you get. Things are worth different values.
01:02:05.470 - 01:02:51.054, Speaker A: And so I think ultimately what we wanted to create was this game where you're not the player. And the reason is, because I tell this story a lot, is I can't play 3 hours of War zone. I've got like a four month old baby boy now, and I can't play 4 hours of Warzone at night. Casual games don't do it for know. And I've been playing games my whole life. So what's this gonna look like for me? Know, what kind of games am I going to play? I think what we concluded is we went from hardcore games to casual games. And what we're going towards next is like a form of never ending story, idle game where you're not the player, but it's a rich world with emergent behavior because of AI.
01:02:51.054 - 01:03:22.714, Speaker A: And you're able to kind of act as high command or commander, saying, hey, maybe we should do this to the character that is being played by AI in this world. When you think about it, it makes a ton of sense in that one of the top categories in media consumption on YouTube is watching other people play video games. But you can't prompt them. You can't tell them, hey, go do this. And so it's somewhere between a pet, like almost like an ant colony or a pet that you're able to build a relationship with. It remembers your history. It's able to plan things.
01:03:22.714 - 01:03:54.454, Speaker A: It's able to execute things on its own. It'll buy NFTs or ERC 20s, it'll sell NFTs or ERC 20s. It has full control over its own wallet. And so the first step we took is really to create this 2D engine. And that includes the AI for the character, the dungeon master AI, to govern the world so that someone doesn't go creating something that's really arbitrary to destroy the illusion of the world. And then like a combat master AI, because OpenAI doesn't want you to create AI simulations with combat. Fair enough.
01:03:54.454 - 01:04:26.162, Speaker A: We don't want Skynet. We did it instead. And so that's more like a d D engine, right? Like, how do you resolve combat? And so I think ultimately it's this project that we started working on where you're able to play and have a rich experience interacting with a character that is the main character, and you're supporting them, and you're able to prompt them and interact with them, and they're able to prompt you and interact with you and ultimately build this relationship type game.
01:04:26.216 - 01:04:26.820, Speaker D: Where.
01:04:28.630 - 01:05:00.358, Speaker A: You can use assets and discover assets in a world that is emergent and ever evolving. And there is no true win condition which allows you to kind of experience it, how you want to experience it and contribute to it, how you want to contribute to it. So now, before I pass it over to Koji, I will say this. I know a lot of people are super excited about it. We did a pre alpha test. A bunch of folks who really did the pre alpha test are super excited about it. You're welcome to talk to them about it directly on Twitter, we typically tag them and say, hey, talk to these folks.
01:05:00.358 - 01:05:37.138, Speaker A: They played it just so you could hear it from others, not just us, but it is something that we're working towards getting into consumers hands in a pre alpha game shortly. But we're working towards, and it's ambitious. I'm not going to lie to anybody about this. It's ambitious, but we're working towards getting something to consumers before the end of the year. And I believe that this opportunity is one of those ones that the blockchain space in general should capitalize on. It just makes sense. Digital intelligence should have digital possessions and natively digital possessions.
01:05:37.138 - 01:06:07.780, Speaker A: And that is uniquely possible from a scarcity standpoint with blockchain. It is uniquely possible from an intelligence standpoint with AI. And I know it's a lot of buzwords, but when you play with the product and you feel it for the first time, it doesn't feel like anything you've ever experienced before. I was skeptical of the stickiness of the relationship between humans and AI until I started to play with this. And then I still get messages from people who are in the pre alpha saying, make sure we backed up my AI. I want to make sure that they're still alive. You're like, alive anyway.
01:06:07.780 - 01:06:37.034, Speaker A: But it's an early project. We are very ambitious about our timelines on it. We are working very hard on it. You've seen some of the UE five explorations, and you've also probably seen some of the 2D walkthroughs with the development team of the intelligence engines. But, yeah, it's never been done before. Right. So isn't that, like, what we're here to do? I don't want to do things that, like, if the TCG access, you know, this is like our Mr.
01:06:37.034 - 01:06:44.254, Speaker A: Holland's opus is colony, right? This is our opus, coach, Mr. Don, what do you want to say?
01:06:44.452 - 01:07:34.826, Speaker D: What do I want to say about it? Okay, well, a couple of things. The gameplay itself, we're still honing in on some of the details, but it's going to be sort of an interesting, you'll be in a colony, it'll be a big co op with the other people in your colony, but the real world sort of implications of the rarer assets kind of make it a bit not quite PvP, but you don't want to get rid of your rarest assets, but you also want your calling to survive. So there's a bit of a give and take there, which is interesting. But you as the player are almost at the super ego to your avatar. The what carol was saying earlier. Basically, you're just trying to train your avatar to play the way that you might play, so that when you're away at work or whatever it is that you're doing, it's behaving accordingly. But it has a mind of its own.
01:07:34.826 - 01:08:18.246, Speaker D: So sometimes it's going to do certain things that you might not necessarily do, but that's where some of the interesting bits are. The very first exploration of the game was a bit of a survivorsque scenario where we had a bunch of colonists in the colony. Everyone was told that at the end of the time period, all the AI would get together, not the players, but all the little avatars would get together and they would vote for who they thought would make the best leader of the colony. And some interesting excerpts that make me realize that this is something, that it is definitely for real and needs to be explored. One is, I told my, a lot of people were like, okay, I'm going to get my guy to mind really hard, make a lot of money, give it away. People are really going to love me if I do that. Other people are going to socialize.
01:08:18.246 - 01:08:50.040, Speaker D: I'm going to put up campaign posters. I'm going to do all this stuff. I told my avatar what we're going to do is we're going to host entertainment nights in the colony bar, and you're going to become a stand up comedian, and you're going to tell jokes and people are going to love it. And so he was like, working on his set, working on a set, doing all this stuff, like, not going to work, whatever. And I was like, okay, tell me one of your jokes. And he was just like, okay, why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. I was like, this is amazing.
01:08:50.040 - 01:09:20.862, Speaker D: Terrible joke. But I ended up winning the colony. I ended up getting voted for because they thought my avatar was hilarious. So I'm like, I'm in on that. But the story that really got me was there was a player who wasn't getting along with their avatar and was trying to get the avatar to do things that it really didn't want to do and was kind of being a shithead about it, which is also kind of fun, but they have the ability to be like, I don't want to do this. So that player was constantly just saying, do this, do this, do this, do this. Like, the same thing over and over and over again.
01:09:20.862 - 01:09:44.482, Speaker D: And out of nowhere, his colonist, his avatar, just stopped working, stopped moving, and they just, like, beelines to the hospital, like, the sick bay in the colony, and told the doctor, because you can review their conversations, he told the doctor, I think there's something wrong with me. I'm hearing voices in my head. And I was just like, this is insane, what's happening right now. It kind of gave me choke.
01:09:44.626 - 01:10:24.130, Speaker A: Yeah, there's another really good example. I love the mint tea example. So one of the colonies was in, like, a bit of a death spiral, which was kind of like a bit of a bug we were working on. And one of the players from the public told his avatar to make that when he's not feeling well that his parents make him mint tea. And so the avatar asked the dungeon master if it was okay to go plant mint tea and said yes. And so it went to the garden, planted mint. It took a duration of time for the mint to grow, and then it harvested an 1155 of mint, and it got it in its wallet, and then it processed it and made a cup of tea.
01:10:24.130 - 01:11:07.646, Speaker A: The 1155 of raw mint was gone, and the cup of tea was created, and it drank it, and it gave him plus two happiness and plus two health, all decided by the dungeon master, AI. And so this is something entirely emergent, right? And so it's not something you can anticipate. It's something that's very different and rich and weird, but it will make for incredible streaming, it will make for incredible dinner conversation, and you can engage and dial up and down your engagement with it based on your time limitations while also being able to catch up with it, because it creates synopsis of what happened since you last came. So you'd be like, okay, since you last came into the game, this is.
01:11:07.668 - 01:11:08.382, Speaker D: What I got up to.
01:11:08.436 - 01:11:40.620, Speaker A: You can see its plan. You can see its inventory. You can see its wallet. If you want to take a bunch of ERc 20 prime and give it to your avatar, a 6551 wallet, you can. But we've also seen that happen where the avatar, the character becomes very disenfranchised and then goes to the bar and spends a bunch of persons prime at the bar drinking. And every time they're drinking again, they're getting 1155 and then they're consuming it and it goes away. But they get like, negative one happiness and like, plus two health or something.
01:11:40.620 - 01:12:28.970, Speaker A: Or probably negative and negative actually not plus two health, but generally speaking, it's not something you've seen before. And that's what makes it really exciting. And it's a new category. We wanted to get ahead of it, so we wanted to share our early research with everyone and let them try it. And I think you can expect us to allow more people to try it in pre alpha. I don't want to call it anything more than a pre alpha right now, but you've also seen our work to match that intelligence on the 2D side with the UE five visualization of what we want to achieve. And what that looks like is your 3d avatar running around in the world, literally animated to do things as they're doing them, be it working out, be it having conversations with others, being.
01:12:28.970 - 01:13:00.470, Speaker A: Working in the mind. And when they do send you a message or have a conversation with you, you're now seeing a picture on the bottom right of your character literally just talking to you. I think this is the beginning of something that is bigger. Oh, there's my dog. I think this is the beginning of something that is bigger than blockchain. But blockchain is fundamentally a part of the conversation. So we want to make sure we're pioneering that.
01:13:00.620 - 01:13:08.294, Speaker E: Guys, you just both blew my mind with everything that you were just talking about. Where to even begin here.
01:13:08.332 - 01:13:08.630, Speaker A: Okay.
01:13:08.700 - 01:13:43.620, Speaker E: I think going back to a .1 of you made earlier when you said that we're kind of, at the day, zero point with parallel, all of that is starting to come into focus for me now. And I can start to see even clearer where you're going with this IP and this franchise. And not to minimize what you've done to get to this point, to make the TCG, but it's the tip of the iceberg, I think. So I want to also just your progress on colony. I saw one of you tweet about it early on. It looked like a wireframe with little dots moving around.
01:13:43.620 - 01:14:36.530, Speaker E: And then fast forward a month and a half, two months later, and I'm seeing this ue five, almost like fully realized, high fidelity, beautiful parallel artwork being rendered. And I don't doubt that you're going to have this out before the end of this year. I think that's what you said. You honestly blew my mind with what you guys are bringing to the table. I love when I see anti skumorphic designs and things that haven't been done before. And to kalos'point, creating a new category and also just having a kid and that compression of time that we all go know. Obviously Defi dad is in that same setup myself as well, and my gaming time is just being compressed.
01:14:36.530 - 01:15:26.674, Speaker E: The more just things you have to do and you have other priorities. So I do think that this is going to be a pretty amazing kind of like idle style gameplay. Check in on it, make tweaks that can really captivate users. So it's just super excited, to be honest. Okay, so I saw, I think it was Kalos maybe about two, three months ago. You kind of teased and hinted at even more games and gameplay, and I swear I saw like a fully rendered avatar, kind of like moving around in what looked to be, I think, like a third person sort of like style. I mean, what other game types can you kind of tease out of this iP? What else are you thinking? And not to say, what you just gave us isn't enough, because it absolutely is.
01:15:26.674 - 01:15:32.680, Speaker E: But I'm sure you're cooking up lots of other things, so if there's any other things you can share, that'd be cool.
01:15:33.050 - 01:16:02.618, Speaker A: The thing that we did that's different than a lot of people is really that we didn't build. I fundamentally don't believe you're going to be rebuilt, blizzard or riot, by doing what they did. I think you have to do something different. I think they had their own unique path. I think the thing that we saw was, there's two things that we saw that were opportunities. And the first one was pre production, being an actual game asset, like an immediately usable game asset in a TCG card game. And the second one was creating a library of composable assets for subsequent games.
01:16:02.618 - 01:16:32.282, Speaker A: So what that means is every time we create a card, it's obviously usable and playable. So like that is the pre production phase. We've talked about that earlier. The second one is that as we create these cards, these flat 2D cards are actually really 3d characters and vehicles and stuff behind the card. We convert them into UE five usability. And what that does is it unlocks a lot of potential to develop games at half the price and half the time just ballparking it, because now you're not going back into pre production to create all the UE five assets. You already have them all.
01:16:32.282 - 01:17:37.978, Speaker A: And the question is, how do you want to assemble them? Because when you look at parallel cards, you've got characters, you've got vehicles, you've got weapons, and you've got landscapes. Those are the four major recipes for creating a world or a game. Ultimately, I think that's what we did different that allows us to really quickly move in different directions. I think we explored a narrative style game. I think that's probably what you're referring to, actually. I think Koji voiced like, I think our opportunity became unlocked based on the strategic decisions we made very early on, which is that we were going to invest in the future of our ability to build faster and cheaper by assembling a library of assets that we would be able to drop into nearly any format of game we could want to create. But then, as you look at this, I think in the future, obviously we have aspirations for a number of variations of games.
01:17:37.978 - 01:18:14.140, Speaker A: And I think one of the studio's mantras is many ways to play. I think that's what we want to realize is many ways to play. And that way, however you want to engage with the parallel IP, be it a TCG, because gamers don't just play one game, right? You play a first person shooter too long and you're like, I need something else, man. This is just like my head spinning. So you can play a TCG or you can jump into colony, or you can play a third person shooter. Or maybe it's just a story mode game, kind of like the last of us, I think. I have conversations with different people on the teams about different things that we want to work on and that we chip at.
01:18:14.140 - 01:18:52.006, Speaker A: And then when a priority that seems is validated becomes material enough to us, we direct resources into it. And so I think colony, we were playing with the UE Five. We had an ARPG version of the view. We had a third person shooter kind of story, narrative view in UE five. And then we saw what we wanted to do with colony and we were like, okay, we need to push those resources in because that's where we want to go next. And we can always come back to these other explorations because those are competitive. Those are not something that there are incumbents that are traditional large studios with hundreds of millions of dollars of budget, which we don't have.
01:18:52.006 - 01:19:34.482, Speaker A: So we have to be smarter, right? We have to literally be smarter. And what that looks like, to me, is going where no one's gone and being first and scaling the hell out of that before they get a chance to do it. And the barrier to entry is still high, right? If you think back to 510 years ago, people would have been like, oh, my man, the barrier to entry, to building a blockchain is so high now, people can just clone it and spin up a network of their own relatively with relative ease. There's services that even do it. So the barrier to entry right now is still high on creating something like this. And so our objective is to own that category well before others have an opportunity to act. And so I think we did a couple of things right.
01:19:34.482 - 01:20:08.558, Speaker A: We do have some stuff that we're working on that's kind of like top secret. We're always experimenting with things like any combination of. And I think we've recently reshared some old work where we had this networked version of a mobile app where you could play TCG by dropping swiping cards out onto the field, like, almost like Yu Gi oh meets Dejark. For know, it's a vertical slice of the game, but that is actually a real game. That is network worked. I could play that with Koji today. And the idea there was like, how do you have your cards? If you have your cards on your phone, in your wallet, how do you pull your.
01:20:08.558 - 01:21:03.210, Speaker A: Just like, you could pull a deck out of your pocket and play a game of cards with your friend. How do you do that with a phone? And there are problems there, right? Like, we have some really brilliant AR engineers on the team and XR and who worked on all kinds of amazing products that everyone is aware of, but the problems are still yet to be solved, and so we want to come back to those in the future. But one good example of a problem is, like, the phone was cooking. The phone got so hot playing this game because the amount of 3d objects and AR processing that was happening in real time and on top of networking the game, it was like, within 20 minutes, this thing felt like it was going to be like molten lava in your hand. And so there's still problems to overcome and opportunities. But I think our objective is always the same, which is like, find the thing that we think can create a really compelling product that the young version of ourselves would be like. That's magical.
01:21:03.210 - 01:21:14.290, Speaker A: That's like, super cool. I have to have that. But while we do that, we want to make sure the foundation of the IP is solid and sustainable, and that's where the TCG comes in.
01:21:14.360 - 01:21:18.900, Speaker D: If somebody wants to give us $100 million, we'll make your wildest dreams come true.
01:21:20.390 - 01:21:47.070, Speaker A: Yeah, that's well said. I think also, it's important to say this, and I don't think I've said it so far in this discussion with you guys, is I want to make sure I thank the community. Right. The only reason we're here is people believed in us and supported us along the way. And I know we're all celebrating and having fun playing the beta, and I celebrate with you not because our work is done, but because we did it together. And that's the truth. We wouldn't be here without the community's.
01:21:47.490 - 01:23:23.950, Speaker C: This is actually probably a good final question for us to discuss before we wrap up. How do you create the culture that you have within the parallel community? And I would separate those that are on the core team within a parallel studios, and maybe even we talk about Echelon A is one of the most impressive parts of parallel, is you can sense that everyone that works on the core team is very welcoming. If you hop into a discord, of course, that's one of the easiest ways to start to interact with the community, but it's a place that clearly values every little interaction, and this is something that's very difficult to replicate beyond founders. Like, what happens is everyone wants a piece of Mr. Gone and Kalos and all the other names that you get to know on that core team, and then you lose something in those interactions as the team grows, because it's hard to continue to find folks who just care as much. But I have not sensed that yet. There has continued to be growth within the team and seemingly more community members, more full time employees of parallel studios who really seem to take pride in just every single interaction like they were a founder.
01:23:23.950 - 01:23:25.920, Speaker C: How do you do that?
01:23:26.690 - 01:23:27.534, Speaker A: What do you guys do?
01:23:27.572 - 01:23:41.122, Speaker C: Do you have weekly pep talks? Do you think it's just because of the type of project that it's attracted TCG enthusiasts who are just built differently than those who would work on other types of startups in the world?
01:23:41.256 - 01:24:22.362, Speaker D: I think there's a long answer to that, but I'll say that a step one in building a great community, at least in my experience, is just threaten to rug whenever possible. But no, I think it's because we started as a group of friends, right? This story is true. Kayla and I, we went to university together and have been friends ever since. And all the other people that have started the company with us are our friends. And so I think that that is maybe an attractive quality to people looking in from the outside, it's like, oh, these guys are having fun together. And all the other people that we've brought on since are people that we've worked with before or that were friends of ours or whatever. And so that's kind of continued.
01:24:22.362 - 01:25:03.958, Speaker D: And then going forward, we've also just found people that are either like minded to us. A lot of people came that are core elements to our team came from the community and the parallel discord. They were like some of the earliest adopters. People who bought in the PS 15, ended up being pillars of our company. And so I think that it's always stemmed from, to a certain degree, a level of friendship and passion for what we're doing, and it's not something that we've actively tried to do. I don't think we've ever even had a discord call where it's like, let's go, guys. There are certain passion speeches, but for the most part, it's like the same thing that we said at the beginning of this call.
01:25:03.958 - 01:25:32.274, Speaker D: It was like, there's a lot of work to do. We got to keep going. We work with people who just want to make the best thing possible because they want to make the best thing possible. And I think that we just look for other people who are part of that. And that naturally brings, like, people want to gravitate towards people who are passionate. I think it comes across in the discord and in our mods and in the people surrounding the community. And also, full credit to Kalos.
01:25:32.274 - 01:26:05.120, Speaker D: He's very good at engaging with people on a one to one level, even on things like Twitter and whatever. I mean, there are times when he'll call us up at like 330 in the morning and be like, hey, I need you to add these users to the beta because I just had a conversation with them and they're really cool guys. And it's just like, okay. That's how much he cares about it. I care less because I also have a child and would like to sleep. But at the end of the day, these are the things we do because we really care about what we're doing. And it's fun for us as much as it's work.
01:26:05.120 - 01:26:18.440, Speaker D: It's like the dream, man. I grew up as a kid being like, wouldn't it be so cool if I just played, if I just got to play video games for a living? And, I mean, I don't just play video games now, but this is probably as close as you'll ever get, and it's pretty awesome.
01:26:20.170 - 01:26:56.770, Speaker A: I appreciate Koji's shout out to and over. I think I try my best to always remember that customer service is a differentiator, no matter what it like, it matters, right? And if people want to talk to me, I want to make myself available. And sometimes, yeah, I make sacrifices to make that happen. But I don't know, it's like a special thing and I'm excited about it and I want other people to know that I'm not on the pedestal. I'm not like some person. You can't dm most people. I still answer 90% of the DMs that message and responses that come through Twitter.
01:26:56.770 - 01:27:14.454, Speaker A: Nothing's changed. And I don't think I wanted to change for. So I mean, I definitely want it to change because I'm tired. But I think generally I like knowing what's going on in the community and the pulse of things and hearing from people and it helps me do my job better too.
01:27:14.492 - 01:27:15.080, Speaker D: Right?
01:27:17.450 - 01:27:43.460, Speaker A: I don't know. You look at the early days of Amazon or whatever, gigantic, successful company and being real and human with people and being available and having really great customer service, meaning responding to people. That's always a core tenet of any great company or any great studio that's ever been built and any of this is otherwise, it's just like, I don't believe that.
01:27:44.470 - 01:27:50.020, Speaker D: That being said, I have my own Twitter account and you can definitely put me on a pedestal whenever you want.
01:27:51.750 - 01:27:57.370, Speaker C: This guy, actually, you're using the parallel TCG pod handle.
01:27:57.550 - 01:28:03.554, Speaker A: He's farming off of our handle. He's literally parallel TCG pod now. It used to be Mrgon East.
01:28:03.682 - 01:28:21.158, Speaker D: I was told that my views were not reflective of the company's views and I thus needed to change the way that the Twitter account was being represented. So it is me talking my own bullshit and not parallels views.
01:28:21.254 - 01:28:30.138, Speaker A: For anyone watching this, not knowing, some of his takes are pretty spicy sometimes. Just he's good to keep a little bit of distance.
01:28:30.314 - 01:29:15.040, Speaker C: I do tend to think of you Kayla's as like the unofficial, like 24 7365 customer support for parallel. I didn't realize that. And then it was quite a while ago I figured out, I was like, man, he's everywhere. You'll have someone who just created a brand new account on Twitter and they're like, what's parallel? I'll see you responding. I'm like, this guy must be like searching on Twitter for just like anything that references parallel. And anyways, that availability, though, it's very endearing. It's something that, it's not the norm among I think some of your peers building in this space.
01:29:15.040 - 01:30:21.394, Speaker C: I've been in this space now for like seven going on eight years. Being able to just remain level headed and stay hungry and not forget what originally got you into this space that is unique. Unfortunately, it's sad to say that that should be unique, but there's just so many people who forget that customer service matters, and they forget that every little interaction could be the fork in the road for someone who ends up being a major contributor to their project. And I'll say, like, I know this is part of the reason nomadic and I are such good friends, and part of the reason we wanted to do this podcast is we feel like you have to tell those stories, let people discover the value and the excitement and the new ideas in this space. You have to inspire them, but you also have to be incredibly welcoming. And parallel is just a beacon of this sort of benchmark that we should be setting for this space. Anyways, this is a great place for us to go ahead and wrap up.
01:30:21.394 - 01:31:00.586, Speaker C: I want to remind listeners that first off, as I mentioned earlier, they should follow parallel TCG pod, but it is not representative of the greater parallel project. If he says anything spicy there, you should listen to the podcast. There's links there, like listen to life in parallel. If this drew you into parallel, you got to go back and listen to the whole podcast and just start from the beginning, because there's so many interesting stories that they have to tell there from their vantage point as founders. And then follow Kalos at Temple crash on Twitter. Follow parallel TCG. That's the mothership account for parallel.
01:31:00.586 - 01:31:42.382, Speaker C: You got to go to parallel life, which is where you can sign up for beta access. Hopefully, by the time folks listen to this in the future, you'll be able to gain access to that immediately. Guys, I want to give you then the final word. Anything else that you would advise as like a call to action or milestones coming up here in the next few months as we're a little over halfway through 2023, you've got a really ambitious roadmap. Anything else to share? And obviously, it goes without saying, just thanks so much for taking so much time out of your schedule to talk with us about all the cool shit that you're building.
01:31:42.436 - 01:32:06.638, Speaker D: I'll let Kaylos talk about the stuff that we have to share, but I'll just add that anyone listening to this just at myself or Temple Crash or at parallel TCG, and if you don't have access to the beta, we'll find a way to get you in definitely for listeners of this pod, like, come play the game, beat me down even further.
01:32:06.814 - 01:32:36.054, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Oswad nomadic, thanks for having us. I think we're appreciative of you guys giving us this audience and having this conversation. I think some of the stuff that's coming up that people can expect. We've got a release probably late August, another release of September before the end of the year. We'll have Planet fall, our first expansion set, so we'll be able to rip packs again together. That'll be fun. And obviously we're aiming to get to a place where colony is in good enough shape sometime to feed December and January.
01:32:36.054 - 01:32:58.180, Speaker A: We can ship it to consumers. I think that would be really exciting. You can expect a number of updates as well. But generally speaking, I think we're just going to keep building, right? That's what we do. We just stay focused on making the game better and adding new features and functionality, stay focused on expanding the IP and make everyone's dreams come true.
01:32:58.870 - 01:33:17.594, Speaker E: You can cut this, but I can confirm this is like, probably the most hyped I've been. I've probably put about 15 hours into the beta so far. I played through all the parallels just done through that rookie campaign and yeah, it's so sticky already. And the fact when one v one.
01:33:17.792 - 01:33:21.420, Speaker A: We'Re going to go one V one. You and Mr. Gone.
01:33:22.270 - 01:33:31.470, Speaker E: Let's do it. Actually, which parallels do you guys use? I think Kayla's. You're earthen, but I don't know what gone is like. Typically.
01:33:33.650 - 01:34:00.090, Speaker D: A couple things. I mainly play shroud, but I play neve, which is just know I like the sort of like what's in the box element of when I can pull off the combo. Yeah. What units do I get out of it? I don't win very often, but I have a lot of fun doing it. It's kind of like when you played that game mouse trap as a kid. I just wanted to see the trap go off. I didn't really care about the game, and that's kind of where I'm at with this as well.
01:34:00.090 - 01:34:26.400, Speaker D: I think we should also mention very soon we're going to do an Avatar challenge. Basically, you can win your way by playing parallel to some really. So we held back some avatars from the Avatar sale, including a one of one. So if people are listening, you play the game, you get some wins, you get entered into this thing where the avatars can be yours. So that should be exciting as well. And that's happening very soon.
01:34:26.770 - 01:34:51.890, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone, for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital and for future episodes, the Edge podcast. Please check out our link tree at Edge Underscore podcast.
