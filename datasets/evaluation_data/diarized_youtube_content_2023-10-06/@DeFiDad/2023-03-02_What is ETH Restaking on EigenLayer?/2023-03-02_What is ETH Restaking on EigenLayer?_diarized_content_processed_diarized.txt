Anything that requires a decentralized trust network. And this set of smart contracts allows the existing stakers to communicate their intent to participate in new protocols. The nation state of Ethereum, its number one export, then becomes this decentralized trust or security. As a staker, you're now opting into this new protocol, and what it means is you're accepting to the registration conditions, to the payment conditions, and to the slashing conditions.
