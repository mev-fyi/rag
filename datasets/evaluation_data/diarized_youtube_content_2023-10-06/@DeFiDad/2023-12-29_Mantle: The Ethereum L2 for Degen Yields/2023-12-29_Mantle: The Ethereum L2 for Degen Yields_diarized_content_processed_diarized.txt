00:00:00.320 - 00:00:27.736, Speaker A: Today's show covers one of the most Product focused Ethereum L2s, Mantle. In this episode, we'll interview Chief Alchemist Jordi Alexander about all things Mantle, how to play the upcoming airdrop season, and why it's likely to be a magnet for DEFI users with their native yield products such as musd backed by Ondo's USDY token earning US Treasury Bill yield as well as their Meth liquid staking token offering 2x the average ETH staking yield.
00:00:27.848 - 00:00:56.100, Speaker B: I would say that we have very, very few product focused L2s. All the other L2s that are major ones, they are, they're tech focused, amazing developers coming up with great technology. At Mantle, we're kind of like, okay, we're going to pick whoever does the best job and we'll partner with them and use their tech, but we will actually focus on the end user and what products are they actually going to be wanting to use.
