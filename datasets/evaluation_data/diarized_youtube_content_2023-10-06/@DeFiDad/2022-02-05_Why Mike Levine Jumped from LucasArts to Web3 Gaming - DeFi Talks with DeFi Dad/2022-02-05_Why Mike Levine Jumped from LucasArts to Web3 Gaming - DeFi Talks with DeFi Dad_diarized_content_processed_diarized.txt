00:00:04.490 - 00:00:51.146, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi dad. All right, everyone, thanks for joining. It's Friday, February 4, 2022. Today I'm joined by Mike Levine from Planet Mojo. Mike is a longtime game developer. He has more recently moved over to the web three gaming space. He is developing a game that allows you to use NFTs and other web three protocols, hopefully to enhance your gameplay.
00:00:51.146 - 00:01:19.174, Speaker A: And so we're going to focus today on really his journey, having worked at the likes of Lucas Arts to today, basically, like what compelled him to move over. He actually recently wrote a medium post all about what gave him the confidence that this was no longer a fad, that it was truly the future of gaming. So, Mike, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:19.292 - 00:01:22.520, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me, Travis. Great to be.
00:01:26.170 - 00:01:53.270, Speaker A: I mean, your journey starts at art, so like, I would love to just kind of nerd out on some of the work that you did there. Before we talk more about why you started developing this game on Polygon. But yeah, tell us just more about your career and I'd love to hear more about some of the projects you worked on there at Lucas Arts.
00:01:53.370 - 00:01:59.698, Speaker B: Oh, boy. All right, load old memory banks. Yeah, no thanks.
00:01:59.784 - 00:02:01.970, Speaker A: You're 21, right? That's what you're.
00:02:03.990 - 00:02:50.894, Speaker B: Be honest, 25. Yeah. I'd be lying if I said I charted this course. I moved out to California, I needed a job, and I saw an ad in the paper for Lucasfilm games at the time and I said, oh, that sounds interesting. I was going to go to grad school and figured I need to pay the bills for a while. But as soon as I got there, I recognized it was something special was going on and my plans changed basically because I was like, hey, this just wasn't on my radar before that. Now there's video game programs in colleges, and growing up in a suburb outside Boston, it wasn't like on the checklist, develop video games.
00:02:50.894 - 00:03:48.370, Speaker B: But as soon as I got there, I was. And this, it was just fun, really, for me at first. And I started out testing in the QA department, which I always tell people is still a great way to enter the industry because kind of everything collides there and helped me learn. But I wasn't giving up on my dream, initially of journalism, and I was just interested in video and documentary. So I was learning all this stuff on the side, basically about digital video, which was just exploding at the time. I'm that old, but Photoshop, digital video and all this stuff. And I was basically able to initially at least apply a lot I was learning on the outside at Lucas Arts that helped me move over to the art department and really got to work on some amazing games, from Salmon Max to the dig full throttle.
00:03:48.370 - 00:04:01.500, Speaker B: Eventually, Star wars invaded and that kind of took over. Rebel assault to Jedi Knight Dark forces eventually. And, yeah, it was a fun time.
00:04:03.390 - 00:04:27.060, Speaker A: Obviously, the way I frame the question, I'm enthralled by just the idea of being able to work on all of this. It seems like, obviously a really fun place to be. I'm curious, though, what's some of the drawbacks? Or what do you think people don't appreciate about working in the gaming industry, working in the places that you did?
00:04:28.230 - 00:05:20.466, Speaker B: Well, back then, it was a younger, innocent time. I think it's fairly appreciated. I think all of us who worked on those games, we, like, chuckle a little when we see things like crypto punks, because we were making games that were restricted by those pixel dimensions, like day of the tentacle and things like that, until the resolution got higher. So as artists who had to live through that, it was kind of like, God, I never want to do that again. And then you see all these sort of retro pixelated things emerge, and you're just like, okay, that's funny. So you just never know. And, yeah, look, we had to walk over floppy disks across to other buildings and just silly things that we take for granted now.
00:05:20.466 - 00:05:34.600, Speaker B: Their Internet really even only emerged when I was sort of towards my end there. And the CEO at the time thought it was in a closet that you had to get a key to get into because, you know, it wouldn't affect our business.
00:05:35.770 - 00:05:42.700, Speaker A: Wait, remind me, so what year did you start out when you were referencing, like, getting started out?
00:05:45.790 - 00:05:48.940, Speaker B: It's fine. We're talking like, 91.
00:05:49.310 - 00:05:51.040, Speaker A: 91. Wow. Okay.
00:05:52.530 - 00:05:56.814, Speaker B: First game I got to touch really was like Monkey island, too, which was fun.
00:05:56.852 - 00:06:07.620, Speaker A: Wow. And then when you talk about the Internet was really coming to fruition as you were making some transition there. What year was that?
00:06:08.550 - 00:06:17.810, Speaker B: 97. 97, probably. Yeah. I was finishing dark forces, too.
00:06:17.880 - 00:06:24.630, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So what did you do after that? You mentioned this transition, and where did you move to next?
00:06:24.700 - 00:07:24.826, Speaker B: Well, what I ended up doing, mainly at Lucas in the arts department was like, it ended up, and this is sort of a theme throughout my career, I guess, is just sort of taking new tech, bleeding edge things and trying to integrate them into real production. And the pipelines were always changing. The art was evolving so quickly back then, but that led me to just work a lot with the guys across the street, because, again, it was an innocent time, which happened to be ILm and Skywalker ranch. And they were able to take us in and show us what they were working on, which was at the know, the precursor to the new. And, you know, that's why we shot Jedi Knight on full blue screen, which now is just normal. But at the time was like, what the heck are you guys doing? So it was very new kind of stuff. But anyway, because of my friendships, I formed with those other companies.
00:07:24.826 - 00:07:58.120, Speaker B: Some guys formed a startup doing like software special effects. That's what really gave me the startup bug, though, I guess, and brave enough to go things on my own. We did that for a few years. It was fun. I realized I didn't want to sell software updates to people for a living. I wanted to get back to doing more creative stuff. And at the time, I'd moved back to the east coast and started doing my own thing first with Flash and just sort of kept evolving with technology that interests me.
00:07:59.610 - 00:08:19.820, Speaker A: Okay, when did you start learning then about, I mean, I'm just going to call it web three gaming or play to earn play and earn gaming. When did you first hear about this? Because I want to go back to kind of the spark and what sort of criticisms you might have had initially, what drew you in and so on.
00:08:20.290 - 00:08:31.182, Speaker B: Well, like most things, things happen in waves, and then maybe there is that one moment of sort of realization. You're still there, right. Somehow I got.
00:08:31.236 - 00:08:34.500, Speaker A: I am, yeah. I've just got like magical powers to put you on.
00:08:37.510 - 00:08:54.530, Speaker B: I'm bigger. Yeah. I mean, just to give little context to fill in the gap there. So we got really into AR and VR for like seven years. And again, we're super early into that. I had a friend at Magic Leap. We're talking like 2014.
00:08:54.530 - 00:09:49.286, Speaker B: I had just started my last company, Happy Giant. We were experimenting with mobile games, but I was like, boy, this is going to become a user acquisition battle. I didn't want to raise $30 million, and maybe I was wrong. VR and AR specifically really interests me, and I thought it had huge potential as a paradigm shift again for gaming, and I still believe that. And we rode that pony, to give a long story short, as long as we could, worked with some of the best in the industry. But in terms of, like, gaming, which is what we're really into in its mobile form, Ar is kind of limited for long form content, and I fully believe in that future and sort of the glasses, but that's a ways off still in terms of mass consumer. So we pivoted to VR.
00:09:49.286 - 00:10:57.230, Speaker B: We made Sam and Max, which was a throwback to my early days and was a total deja vu. But as we were making that game, and I'll just pin that for 1 second to know I had first got interested in this space, I would say a few years earlier with cryptokitties, that caught my attention and I looked at it a little bit and I was like, kind of like, I've read the story of the Axie guys, except they made the right decision and I waited. But I was like, boy, if you turn this more into a game, this seems like it has huge potential. And I looked at the numbers at the time and I did not understand crypto at all or blockchain. And I was just like, oh, this space has a long way to go. So I kept my eyes on it a little bit, but went on, did the things I was doing, did Sam and Max, and as we were making Sam and Max, really, once we got into full know, my job is more checking builds and checking art. And I started hearing about NFTs early, earlier than the public, I guess, the mass public.
00:10:57.230 - 00:11:32.938, Speaker B: And it interests me a lot. I wanted to learn about it. I wanted to learn about blockchain. And as I don't have to tell you, it's a very deep rabbit hole. So you sort of just have to, even at the beginning, figure out how to navigate what are all these things and what's the difference and what are nfts and trying to get your head around it. But ultimately with NFTs, which I think are great, I was just like, okay, but 2D sort of art, low barrier to entry. Every brand in the world is going to have these soon, which is happening.
00:11:32.938 - 00:12:20.214, Speaker B: And to me I was like, what is going to give these things more utility, more purpose, more value, more fun? And that was obviously gaming. So then I started learning about blockchain games and that was hard to figure out at first too. I'd go to these websites, where's the game? You look at the biggest projects, they don't have a game yet. Wait a minute. That's why I say in my piece and others have said this is game development upside down. And that's why it did take, we didn't dive into this quickly. This took a very months and months over a year now of researching it and continuing to research it because it always evolves, but sort of trying to understand who sort of were the models that we liked and what.
00:12:20.214 - 00:13:03.142, Speaker B: And eventually I found Axie again before it really blew up, really just a couple of months early. But mainly because I was like, they have a game. There's actually a game here, so that just interests me. But then the deeper you dive, there's just so much there about the economy. And that was, I think, really my initial entry to fully understanding or trying to fully understand blockchain games, where it was, where it's going. And yeah, just then learning about other projects and sort of going from there. Taking a lot of time as well to decide who we wanted to be in the space and what kind of game we wanted to make and other games for this space.
00:13:03.142 - 00:13:06.760, Speaker B: We went through many iterations on that.
00:13:07.390 - 00:14:12.030, Speaker A: So you wrote a post recently on medium about your conviction for why this is the future of gaming. Can you talk more about how do you think about. I'm just going to use the phrase web three again. How do you think about web three enhancing the gaming experience? Because there is a lot of criticism which we can talk about later from. There's been actually a lot of real negativity and pushback from the legacy gaming community that this is like a cash grab. And I know there's a lot of anger about driving up the price of graphics cards due to mining within cryptocurrency. But yeah, I guess let's focus on the fundamentals of why do you see a better sort of gaming experience by making use of NFTs and digital assets.
00:14:12.370 - 00:15:19.474, Speaker B: I mean, it's not just one thing. I think there's a lot of things that add up to making this just a big shift. And I think one of them, to me, I guess I say, is sort of like the democratization of gaming, because right now, and a lot of the criticism which we'll get into, but a lot of it's filtered through these big companies and sort of pushing NFTs into their existing games. And that's not what this space is about. These games need to be built from the ground up, decentralized as much as possible, and sort of blockchain native, we feel. So that's a really important thing, I think, for this space and where it's going to head to where it is now is not where it's going. And that's where I think a lot of the criticism comes in and people not sort of understanding layer two and gasless, or very almost gasless solutions and things like that.
00:15:19.474 - 00:16:29.898, Speaker B: But I think for us, the Democratization part is really about for the developers, but it's also for the players community. And gaming has really become a bigger and bigger thing over the last decade. And I see blockchain gaming as the evolution of that right where you're giving the community control and value in the game for too long. And this is again through the lens of a smaller indie developer, which we are, and there are many more of us than the sort of the giant companies is life is tough. You're either doing a licensed game or you're doing an original game and you're generally getting the funds for that from publishers which want to recoup their funds. The platforms take 30%. So one simple way I try to say to it to traditional gamers is like we're going to take that 30 plus percent, we're giving back to Steam and Google and give it back to you and give you more say in what we're building and control.
00:16:29.898 - 00:16:33.002, Speaker B: That's one big part of this for me.
00:16:33.136 - 00:17:24.506, Speaker A: Wait to go with that then. Do you think that just because of the nature of if you issue NFTs, it's going to bootstrap funds for the gaming studio? This is something we've definitely never talked about. And it's like hitting me just right now as you're saying, all of this is that this hopefully allows more to bootstrap as a gaming studio. Or I guess, do you think though, there's an opportunity now and we'll still end up with these very large gaming platforms that sort of like accrue all the value and all of the attention, all of the gamers to one?
00:17:24.608 - 00:18:16.138, Speaker B: Well, yeah, that part TBD. And ultimately there'll be aggregation type platforms. But from the ones we're talking to, they're also looking at a different model than, let's say the web two model or Steam and control and much so I think they're thinking the same ways about it too. But yeah, I say this in the medium piece, and I said this when I first got into it, then I backed off and then I was like, I've gotten more bullish on this lately. It's just that again, it's like Kickstarter for the gaming space, which everyone knew of. To me this space is like Kickstarter on steroids. Right? And when I say that, it's like how Kickstarter started with guys like Tim Schaefer I worked with at Lucas, who did psycho knots on it.
00:18:16.138 - 00:19:10.302, Speaker B: That kind of kickstarted Kickstarter and took him three plus years to ship the game. But he endeared that community and was constantly releasing drops, art, documentary, behind the scenes stuff. Everyone felt a part of that community. There was very little hostility and the game finally came out and it was met with open arms there. Everyone's just pre buying the game in different packages here. That's why I say on steroids is people are really buying into the game and owning assets before it comes out and really owning a part of the game. And so I think that's what I see in this space is just more, you're building communities from day one, just like you were then, and sort of building momentum till the game comes out, which we plan to do.
00:19:10.302 - 00:19:15.280, Speaker B: And a lot of people extend that, but we plan to do that relatively soon.
00:19:15.970 - 00:20:42.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that among all the different reasons that one could be excited for web three gaming, I can admit I actually never was enthralled with, hey, you can own the gaming assets. Because for me it was like, well, in most cases, I've always played a game and whatever I use is within that game. And it was less compelling to me personally. But then when you start to see the trading volume that happens on some of the in game assets and you see the royalties that can then accrue. Because that's one of the things a lot of people miss with NFTs, is that it allows you to automate or program in the ability to collect royalties versus a very sort of convoluted and complex legacy way to do it. And then the collection of those fees is, again, it's quick and it's automated because it's happening with automated money software on a blockchain. It just, for me, means that there are great gaming studios.
00:20:42.454 - 00:21:49.310, Speaker A: And I'm not saying that gaming studios shouldn't continue to reap rewards from the hard work they put out, the creative sorts of games they put out. But when you use NFTs, it opens yourself up to this like 24/7 sort of trading volume that can happen with some of these valuable assets. And then in some cases, we've already seen this, where other web three games that have released NFTs are seeing huge trading volume that is actually helping to bootstrap the gaming development. But then what's even more exciting is that some of those royalties could accrue to those that are within the community that hold those assets or hold a token. And that is where the idea of call it community ownership, democratized ownership of the game. That's where it comes from. I think the TLDR on it is today, if you put all your time and money, actually Kendria on your team has talked about this.
00:21:49.310 - 00:22:25.350, Speaker A: They spend a lot of money in game for her son and there's no return on. It's just, it's. It's paid and it's gone. There is a chance, not a guarantee, that if you're holding certain in game assets in web three that those could potentially accrue value or appreciate in value so that you could sell it on a secondary market. But I think the real future is it's like you're playing the game and you're potentially accruing ownership in that game and it creates more skin in the game anyways.
00:22:25.510 - 00:23:17.194, Speaker B: No, with our own marketplace, I think there's a couple of other values to it, which is these things are already happening in games. They have for years in traditional games, people selling accounts, gold farming. We believe by bringing it in house you can remove some of the toxicity around that, the scamming. It's not a pleasant environment currently and that's sort of how I look at these marketplaces. And what we're going to have is where people can buy, sell, trade, loan safely in a more controlled environment. We plan on having a lot of those functions right within our marketplace so people don't have to go outside it, but our assets will live on the blockchain and they will have that freedom. So that's the beauty of this space.
00:23:17.194 - 00:23:19.500, Speaker B: You can't control what people want to do.
00:23:19.890 - 00:23:41.394, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to ask you a few more follow ups to this. Just about. Can you have that financial incentive and still have a love for just playing the game or does it turn itself into a job? But I think we should talk a little bit about planet Mojo first.
00:23:41.512 - 00:23:44.990, Speaker B: Sure, we can come back to that because that is a very deep subject.
00:23:45.150 - 00:23:46.260, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:23:46.950 - 00:23:48.502, Speaker B: I don't want to skip it.
00:23:48.636 - 00:24:08.166, Speaker A: It keeps us all up at night for sure. Maybe also too, as you start to talk about this, let me know. I'm happy to screen share some of the cool stuff you have to show off about Planet Mojo. But anyways, what is Planet Mojo? Tell us more about the game that you're actually developing.
00:24:08.358 - 00:25:09.070, Speaker B: Let me try to screen share something. And we have not shown these yet, so it's just for you, baby. But we're going to be doing a website update next week, so it's just a new illustration. So we're creating this rich, vibrant alien world that we're working with lots of guys I used to work with at Lucas and bring in some guys from ILM and Pixar and just really putting a lot of time into creating this world, trying to make it feel real and tell a story with real characters and from that make many different games from it and also tell a story because that's what we really love about this space. Like new ways to tell a story. I think you were the one who showed me parallel, and that's definitely been huge inspiration to us. Just watching how you can tell a story in this space in kind of different sort of multimedia ways and whatnot.
00:25:09.070 - 00:25:15.666, Speaker B: I'll share more things.
00:25:15.848 - 00:25:18.946, Speaker A: Go right ahead. I just removed that once you can share.
00:25:19.128 - 00:25:37.110, Speaker B: Here we go. So this is concept art. Everything's going to be 3d in this game. But these are just some examples of the mojos, which is sort of your central character and part of the story and will be our first NFT drops.
00:25:39.310 - 00:25:48.634, Speaker A: What you're showing here. This would be an example of in game avatars, whatever you want to call it, that you would be able to own.
00:25:48.832 - 00:26:33.482, Speaker B: Exactly. All our NFTs are going to be playable game assets. These are going to be the first ones when they're nfts, they're going to be fully 3d animated characters as well. The nfts, they'll be rendered, but they'll either be unique poses or animations, a mix of both, and everyone will be unique. And then these are again, 2D or concept sketches that then will be made into 3D. But you can see not all these will be made initially. And there's many more types that we'll be making and releasing over time to sort of help control sort of the supply and demand of them and just release more types and rarity types that people can own and use them as rewards as well.
00:26:33.482 - 00:26:34.700, Speaker B: But, yeah.
00:26:38.510 - 00:26:42.030, Speaker A: Here, I can remove that. Yeah. Was there something else you wanted to share?
00:26:42.180 - 00:27:09.974, Speaker B: The next one, which was the. I can do this, I swear. So these are just some shots. So we're making an auto chess game. That's the first major game that we're making. And so these characters that people will own and be able to play with mojos, you're kind of like your one character. These are these special characters that the planet kind of gives birth to.
00:27:09.974 - 00:27:25.926, Speaker B: They're these plant based characters and the races on the planet, these different clans are basically these different warrior classes and mages and different types. And these are all early concept sketches. These will all be being turned.
00:27:26.038 - 00:27:27.702, Speaker A: So cool to see models.
00:27:27.766 - 00:28:31.642, Speaker B: And yeah, they're all based on animals, as you can tell, but they all have different class types. And you will basically be able to make your own team with these and bring them into battle. And we're putting together a pretty unique system. I mean, the hardest thing by far about this space is figuring out the economies we're working with, machinations we've been using that. But the deeper you get into the space, nobody knows, and it's so early and there are so few examples. And I know there's a lot of different opinions about axie out there, but I still to this day think if you're developing for this space, if you're not listening to those guys and paying close attention, I wish you luck. Because good or bad mistakes they've made, or not, there's no one who has the intel they have and the data and just understanding how this space ticks.
00:28:31.642 - 00:29:59.180, Speaker B: And I think there's many different philosophies of people like me coming into this space, and I think that's all going to be played out over the next year. But we've always been, and this was pre steam, pre Ubisoft hate and worms. Me six months ago just felt like it's going to be a transition to get traditional gamers into this. And sadly, I've proven to be right. I do think people are more open to it than we might think, actually, because I think so much of the vitriol we're hearing online is the, quote, vocal minority. And I honestly read everything they post because I'm fascinated by it, because I'm like, I want to know, are we doing something wrong? I'm being so careful about the environment, and that's one of the big reasons we're building on polygon. But I've done my homework, I think, and even though paying attention to them, if you understand where this space is going, ethereum two even, I mean, we're just at the beginning, and I think any argument I've heard, honestly, is somewhat easy to retort, but it's also difficult to even get into a rational conversation with some of these people.
00:29:59.180 - 00:30:02.400, Speaker B: Welcome to 2022.
00:30:03.330 - 00:31:22.150, Speaker A: I'm really grateful that there was a lot of research that you were doing, and I remember talking with you about different Ethereum l two s l ones, and for now you've been developing on Polygon, which is really like, there was one factor that we definitely never discussed that has really been out there at the forefront is there's been a real pushback on NFTs related to the carbon footprint from like a blockchain. And I'm not going to go down the rabbit hole with this right now, but it's harder to, for someone who's completely foreign to crypto and understanding how consensus happens on a blockchain, what mining is and so on. The TLDR that many don't know about, like an ethereum, is. When Ethereum moves from proof of work to proof of stake, the energy consumption goes down this is something I was quoted and I think it was an Ethereum foundation blog post. It's estimated to go down 99.95% now. While that's true right now, yeah, there's still proof of work is happening.
00:31:22.150 - 00:32:06.740, Speaker A: It consumes a lot of energy, and whether or not that contributes more harm to the world than all sorts of other things that consume energy is a whole nother conversation. But I recognize Polygon has actually been able to continue to grow new games and dapps that are being developed and they are already on a proof of stake consensus. So long story short, it's good to let those who are concerned about carbon footprints that you can say, hey, well, we're developing on Polygon and that is a good thing.
00:32:07.110 - 00:32:46.850, Speaker B: And on top of that, just a, because I believe in it and B, just to refute the issue more, we plan on giving back. We're going to have a charity, NFT, that we'll donate proceeds to. I'm reaching out to organizations blockchain focused that give back as well to get you carbon neutral or negative. So that's definitely a big part of the story. We're making something that's really a nature versus machine story in a way. So we wanted to make sure that was a part of our message and our commitment.
00:32:47.270 - 00:33:29.310, Speaker A: Actually, you know what's funny, Mike, is we live in the state of Massachusetts and there's this incredible.org called the trustees and they look out for historical sites and really the environment. They own like thousands of acres of land. The finances behind the trustees is insane. And I have been a committed member of the trustees. So I'm always like, when I'm talking with a friend or a stranger who maybe has heard like, oh, NFTs, they hurt the environment. Which is, again, I would argue that is absolutely untrue.
00:33:29.310 - 00:33:52.546, Speaker A: I'm like, why would I, as someone who's like a vocal advocate for protecting the, like, why would I even be involved in this? You've, you are definitely misunderstanding the. There's, there's a lot of crazy, wild, loud misinformation out there. Anyways, back to, I know the trustees.
00:33:52.578 - 00:33:54.486, Speaker B: We go to their spots all the time.
00:33:54.588 - 00:34:36.500, Speaker A: It's incredible. If anyone's ever in the state of Massachusetts, just look this up. They have the most beautiful open land for hiking and just enjoying nature. Mike, how do you think about, yeah, what's behind you there? How do you think about balancing all of these incentives that can be created within web three gaming so that we don't shift too far from just like a love of gaming there is just a joy to playing and tuning out. And I think that's something like none of us want to see.
00:34:37.590 - 00:35:17.780, Speaker B: No, this is like the hot button topic in this space right now. I feel like. And I was talking about it when I did the polygon Twitter spaces last week and then the next morning and talking about how we really believe that the space needs to shift from play to earn to play and earn. When someone first said that to me, I was like, what? Just one word, but it changes the entire meaning, really, of that equation. It's not as nice an acronym, but we can get over that. But then the next morning, I was listening to the Axie guys do their Twitch cast and they said the exact same thing. And I was like, okay.
00:35:17.780 - 00:36:16.534, Speaker B: And they said, even I feel like paraphrasing here, but if this space can't move more to people playing these games for fun and not just earning, we're going to have big long term sustainability problems with the games. Just forget about the economies, just people wanting to play the game so they know that. And I think that's why we're being so careful in trying to set up our economy and trying new ideas. Honestly, I think I was watching before this, your interview with RPD, and I was just smiling so much, ready player Dow. Because so many of the things you guys were talking about are literally, we've been talking about every day over here that he mentioned free to play. And literally, that's been my thing for the last few weeks. There's so many lessons in free to play that aren't being used in this space yet.
00:36:16.534 - 00:37:17.506, Speaker B: That can be. And you're starting to see projects, I am at least, that are using that and just moving away from a daily grind, a daily payout. There's like this whole amazing, positive story behind that and empowering people, third world countries. And then there's this, like, and believe me, I've listened to all the different sides and then the sort of dark side of it, which is like, you have these people now playing matches that literally their family's mortgages and food is based on. How did you do today, dad? And it's too much pressure. And so hopefully there's going to be this happy medium. And someone said to me recently about MMOs, and I think the percentages are different here, but in MMOs, you have these sort of loop cycles going on where 90% to 95% of the people are really just there to have fun.
00:37:17.506 - 00:38:07.542, Speaker B: And then you have 5% to 10% who are the gold farmers, and they're selling stuff back to those people. It's this bad relationship. That's how this is much more open. But maybe it's a bad analogy. But if you change those percentages, I think, and that's why one thing we're really exploring with our auto chess game that we're going to come out with originally is a tournament model. And so you can play this game every day and if you grind, you will essentially win battle passes into paid tournaments where there will be payouts and stakes and different types of pools, et cetera, that we're exploring. And those battle passes will be nfts too.
00:38:07.542 - 00:38:40.660, Speaker B: So people can sell them to other people, sponsor other people. They're a valuable asset as well to get out of the game and those will be minted and come out of the game and used by players. So sort of like a two tier type of economy, essentially with a real token but with a soft currency inside the game. That's kind of fueling that as well. And having our own marketplace as well to use our main token to buy and sell the NFTs with.
00:38:41.030 - 00:39:15.470, Speaker A: Yeah, I know with the recent, I think it's in the prime proposal for parallel. There's a lot of talk about basically when can you trade, spend, exchange tokens versus when can you not a part of what you accrue might be a part of your reputation as a player and you shouldn't be able to buy your reputation. And so there's just so much more complexity.
00:39:16.930 - 00:39:46.440, Speaker B: We've totally thought about that too. And honestly, the simple answer and what we're planning is ranked battles. So if people can still buy upgradable characters, that's a viable path. People can upgrade and sell those and people can buy those who maybe want to get into the bigger tournaments or whatever. But you're also going into a higher rank with people who have the same type of characters at that rank. So it's not necessarily going to get easier. We are definitely against pay to win.
00:39:47.050 - 00:40:41.242, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the concept that maybe like, what do I say the principles that I fall back on are? People are free to come and go, let them do what they want within the rules of the game. If a game is poorly designed, if there are rules that are seemingly unfair, then I would expect players to no longer play that or to sell their assets if they own anything that has any secondary value. I don't understand the vocal minority within, amongst gamers especially. Well, I understand those who are within gaming studios clearly feel threatened. So that makes sense to me. But for those that are just enjoying gaming day to day.
00:40:41.242 - 00:41:47.134, Speaker A: Maybe they've even become like an outlier in terms of their success and have a Twitch channel as like an entertainer and so mean. Why would you want to prevent anyone from being able to potentially be paid or earn something from all of the time and effort they put into? Like, it very much reminds me of like, Mike, have you ever thought of this? It kind of reminds me of, there has been a fight for many, many years about whether college athletes should be able to be sponsored. Why does it matter? And people will say, oh, well, that destroys the love of the game. And they should be focused on, they're in college, they should be focused on learning. There's all sorts of goofy arguments I've heard for it and I'm like, but some of these people are bound to be professional athletes and they have a world class talent that people are willing to pay to be associated with.
00:41:47.332 - 00:42:36.494, Speaker B: This is a very deep discussion. I've had some deep discussions about this with another developer in the space who I want to give credit, but I don't know that he's announced yet, so I'll keep his name out of this, but I will give him credit eventually. But yeah, I was totally talking to him about this and it's really interesting. Just food for thought. Think of professional sports, right? And those guys are out there playing for money, right? But the best athletes in the world, the ones who succeed the most, they're not thinking about money. They're in this zone of play. Again, we're going to give him credit, but they sort of rise above that and somehow they get paid the most.
00:42:36.494 - 00:43:34.274, Speaker B: So there's this sort of, just sort of aspect of playing games that is fun, right? And I think you could say the same thing. I said, well, what about poker players to him? And really you think about, it's the same thing, right? Because yes, money is on the line, but the ones who are the best at it, I would guess, I don't watch that much. But they're good poker players, right? They're like in the zone playing poker. And so it's just this weird line of sort of fun and money, because there are games that are totally about money out there, yet people still play them. And the best players really rise to the top. The guy in the NBA who's on the bottom worrying about his contract and if he's going to make the team, he's got all this stuff in his head and he's going out there and it's probably going to affect his game, where if somehow he can rise above that the zen kind of. He's probably going to do much better.
00:43:34.472 - 00:44:42.082, Speaker A: Yeah. I was talking last night to Defi Ted. We were streaming about kind of like all things parallel, and I love the way he framed it. I'll totally butcher it here, but if anyone goes back, it's listed under an episode called Primetalks. On Defi dad, we talked about just the fact that NFTs or d five protocols, anything that's being used within a tokenized economy, an on chain economy for a web three game, it needs to ultimately feed back into a better gaming experience. And if you are delivering a better gaming experience, and obviously this goes beyond me, I'm encompassing everything from start to finish of all the benefits, whether I'm playing the game or not. The fact that hey, I've been playing and spending tons of time on this game, I earned this really rare asset.
00:44:42.082 - 00:45:34.306, Speaker A: It turns out it's worth a lot of money on a secondary market and I can sell that as long as it feeds back into a better experience and people feel like it's an improvement on the legacy experience, it's going to do well. The problem is when you have a game that is force fitting NFTs into it, and it's basically what you alluded to. This happened over, I think, many years. We've seen more of an explosion now of really talented developers like yourself coming in to use that legacy experience of what works with what can work with web three. But we saw for a while a lot of promises. We're still seeing that there's a lot of games out there that are just, they're like, hey, it's a game and it happens to have NFTs in it. To that I say it's experimentation.
00:45:34.306 - 00:45:41.414, Speaker A: A lot of them are going to fail. Who cares? Let people decide what they're going to do with their own money games.
00:45:41.462 - 00:46:11.282, Speaker B: Honestly, this happened in free to play at the beginning when people trying to figure it out and hey, we'll just make our game free and throw in some Inapp purchases. And no, those games needed to be built from the ground up. And guess what? They were clunky at first. Not many of them worked. And the ones who sort of figured out that magic formula had incredible success. And that's what I think we're going to see over the next few years. We're going to see massive innovation and change.
00:46:11.282 - 00:46:25.382, Speaker B: This industry is not going to be axi, believe it or not, and Axie is not going to be axi. I think we're going to be talking in six months. They made massive changes yesterday. It's going to be a completely different game. They know it. I've listened to them.
00:46:25.516 - 00:46:40.010, Speaker A: They have to, actually, because we should probably end here really soon. But who else do you look up to in the space? Obviously, you clearly have a lot of respect for Axie.
00:46:41.390 - 00:47:28.650, Speaker B: It's just so hard to find many other examples. I mean, I'll tell you this, we've read dozens and dozens of white papers. So a lot of what you're basing this industry on, because as you guys were saying in that other talk, there's just not that many real games out yet. And the ones that are out are either sort of graphical interfaces over standard crypto techniques that only native crypto people understand. I think the projects that intrigue me just from a graphical standpoint and game validity, big time ember swords. Am I saying that right? Yeah. Embersaur, Aurora I mean, I'm attracted to the art.
00:47:28.650 - 00:48:07.074, Speaker B: That's what I'm first going to look at. And then the gameplay. Gameplay is hard to judge in this space too, because sort of like you got to look at their roadmap and understand and I'll just get this in also. That's one of the reasons we chose to make auto chess. I want a more under promise and over deliver, and we wanted to build something that we really could deliver to people this year that they can play and be playing and using these assets in the game. So we have bigger plans beyond that. As I said, we're going to make more games that people can move the assets in between to and play other games.
00:48:07.074 - 00:48:11.066, Speaker B: But we didn't want people waiting three years to be able to play.
00:48:11.248 - 00:49:06.540, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. The crypto space startups move, I think, even faster than in the old startup world. It's incredible, like what just a very small team can spin up in a short amount of time. I think part of what has really drawn me in, though, to blockchain based gaming, is at the heart of it is storytelling. And I have a tremendous amount of respect for just the amount of variables and detail that go into creating that game and the economy around it. And with all of that nuance and detail, it makes it that much more difficult for someone to just copy paste. And that's something like, hey, as much, clearly my name is Defi, dad, as much as I still love Defi, and I'm enthralled by all the innovation there.
00:49:06.540 - 00:49:14.318, Speaker A: It is disheartening, of course, to watch so much copying and pasting happening.
00:49:14.484 - 00:49:14.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:14.852 - 00:49:16.590, Speaker A: And I see that as more difficult.
00:49:16.740 - 00:49:52.250, Speaker B: In the gaming copycats which will run into the problem. But look, I'll just say this. We're planning something very special for our whitelist event that will make it fun and a little bit challenging, but we're really putting a lot of time into it and the narrative and going to have fun with it. And I don't know if people remember things like I love bees, et cetera, but definitely influenced by that and some other projects that have been dabbling with this that reminded me of that essentially.
00:49:52.910 - 00:50:03.360, Speaker A: We should end on that, actually. So what's next for Planet Mojo? How can people get involved? What milestones should they look forward to?
00:50:03.810 - 00:50:49.610, Speaker B: Look for an update on our website soon with some cool new art and things. Look for our white paper coming out soon and keep your ears open for unusual whitelist event which will then lead to our mojos coming out, which will be, I don't want to reveal too much, but they will turn into mojos, let's just say. And then we'll be following that up with land. That's one thing that's different about us. We're not launching our token immediately. We want to actually get content out there and get people excited. And then by, let's say early summer probably we'll be launching our game, our auto chess and a land based play right with it immediately.
00:50:49.610 - 00:50:57.806, Speaker B: So a lot happening over the next six months and somewhere right there at the end, our token hopefully as well.
00:50:57.988 - 00:51:03.946, Speaker A: That's awesome. To summarize here, you can learn more at planetmojo IO.
00:51:04.058 - 00:51:10.130, Speaker B: That's also where you can join the discord. Yes. That's where the cool stuff comes out first.
00:51:10.280 - 00:51:38.042, Speaker A: Yeah. If you want to get involved, that is absolutely the best place to go. That to me is one of the more exciting opportunities that I think is unique to web three gaming. I would challenge anyone to tell me about having gotten involved so early with other games that are in development. This is a much different way of doing things.
00:51:38.096 - 00:51:55.166, Speaker B: Yeah, we love feedback, so we listen. So please get on there. Oh, and by the way, we're having a meme art contest where one person will get into the whitelist raffle and it ends today. So if you check out our Twitter, you can see where to go, vote or add images. There's been some unbelievable stuff made.
00:51:55.348 - 00:52:21.960, Speaker A: That's awesome. So they can follow you then at we are planetmojo on Twitter as well. Well, Mike, thanks so much for your time. I just appreciate you talking longer with me about all this. Yeah. And definitely first of many, hopefully we can talk more about just all the challenges and lessons learned along the way. I think, as you pointed out, a lot of people don't really know what's going on.
00:52:21.960 - 00:52:34.378, Speaker A: It's a very new sort of frontier. Wow. By the way, every time when we're talking, it's like sleeting and then raining outside, looking around.
00:52:34.464 - 00:52:54.530, Speaker B: Exactly the opposite of this where we live. But no, I was going to end with this saying, look, one of the smartest people I have the most respect for in this space at one of the bigger companies said to me once, look, Mike, anyone who tells you they know everything about blockchain gaming and you should listen to them, just run the other direction immediately.
00:52:54.870 - 00:52:55.570, Speaker A: That is right.
00:52:55.640 - 00:52:57.462, Speaker B: Kind of tells you where the space is.
00:52:57.596 - 00:53:49.766, Speaker A: Isn't that funny? That's sort of a litmus test for me, too. If I hear someone even pretending to just know everything and not willing to admit just how confused or just how open minded you have to remain, I'm like, no thanks. You have to be a psychopath to think that you know everything in this space. But by the way, if you enjoyed this, there's lots more interviews with leading game developers and founders, investors in the web three space. So you can check that out@dfidad.com and then also, if you're a talented founder or you're looking to start the next great web three game or protocol, whatever, please reach out to me and my team at Fourthrevolution cap Capital. Other than that, Mike, I'm going to end the broadcast, so we'll be in a green room in a second.
00:53:49.766 - 00:53:54.178, Speaker A: Thanks so much, everyone. Have a great day. Take care. Have a nice weekend.
00:53:54.354 - 00:53:55.250, Speaker B: Have a nice weekend.
