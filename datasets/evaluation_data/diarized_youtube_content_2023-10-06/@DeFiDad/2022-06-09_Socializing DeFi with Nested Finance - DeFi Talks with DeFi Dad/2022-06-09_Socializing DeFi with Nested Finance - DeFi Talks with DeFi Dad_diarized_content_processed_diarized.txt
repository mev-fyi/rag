00:00:02.970 - 00:00:43.180, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching DeFi talks with Defi. Dad. Hey, thanks for joining us. It's Wednesday, June eigth, 2022. Today, we're going to do what I enjoy doing most in the world, reviewing a new DFI application. So I'm joined here by Rudy Kadosh, who is the founder of Nested Finance. We're going to talk about this as a new social trading platform.
00:00:43.180 - 00:01:29.020, Speaker A: It allows you to essentially copy the moves of a trader, but I think very cleverly, it allows you to also copy really anything you can do on chain. And so I personally got excited about nested, thinking that one could follow the different yield farming moves that another is making. And nested very cleverly tees up the ability for one to copy those moves, basically by bundling all the transactions and allowing you to do it in a few clicks. So the person that you are following is not managing your money, but it makes it easy for you to copy, I think, really complex moves in Defi. So, anyways, Rudy, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:29.390 - 00:01:34.060, Speaker B: Thanks, Travis. I mean, it's my pleasure to be.
00:01:34.510 - 00:02:18.940, Speaker A: Absolutely. Oh, and by the way, before we get started, just full disclosure. So I've known nested for about six months, and I did have the opportunity to invest in one of the private rounds. So this is not a recommendation or endorsement of any future token or any token that we talk about in general, even if it's ether, bitcoin. But just want to lay that out there from Rudy. Why don't we talk about your background? I guess you're not a first time founder in DeFi or in crypto. So really, I guess you could tell us a bit more about what were you building previously and what led you to build.
00:02:19.710 - 00:02:45.522, Speaker B: So, you have to know, I'm very young, I'm 25 years old, and I started invested in this space, and I started with an investment. I mean, I'm sure that all of us started with an investment in this space. I subscribed to a student loan six years ago, and I decided to invest everything in ETH. So of course it worked.
00:02:45.576 - 00:02:51.620, Speaker A: Well, I did not know this, by the way, this is fun. Yeah, I'm learning a lot here, too.
00:02:52.790 - 00:03:45.970, Speaker B: And so since then, I never left the space. I continued studying. So I was studying artificial intelligence and data science in one of the best engineering school in France. And last year, I decided to interrupt my studies and start nested. And so I decided to start nested because I was seeing Defi surging and everyone. I mean, I went at parties, at diners, and people always asked me, how do you invest in Defi? How do you stake your stable coins? How do you buy cryptocurrencies? I love this space, but it's too complicated. And I thought to myself, man, you really need to build this user friendly dap that will onboard the Mattis.
00:03:45.970 - 00:04:15.630, Speaker B: So of course there is a long road ahead. But still, we have this in mind. We want to convert CFI people. So Coinbase users, itoro users, revolve users into defi users. But they need to find a web3 product with a web two user journey.
00:04:17.490 - 00:04:34.770, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk more about what were some of the products that have inspired you along the way. I know there's a number of improvements here that you've made on some of those products, but anyways, yeah, if you could talk a little bit about that journey.
00:04:35.670 - 00:05:22.210, Speaker B: Yeah, so in fact, if I built netic, it's because I didn't find this user friendly platform that can onboard the masses. So I didn't get inspired from other projects. So there was one existing project that had one common goals with net speed and its token set. And we cannot say that we get inspired from them. But definitely there are a few functionalities that are similar between tokenset and nested.
00:05:25.550 - 00:06:01.862, Speaker A: Rudy, why don't we actually screen share a bit? Because I think we've sort of covered the why behind this, but I know it comes to life once you can actually see how this all works. There we. Okay. Oh, Rudy might have just frozen. Hey, Rudy, if you can hear me, your screen might have frozen and you're frozen. So let's see if. Let's go ahead and I'm going to let you if you can.
00:06:01.862 - 00:06:06.938, Speaker A: Oh, there we go. Looks like you're unfrozen now. There we go. Okay, here we go. Let's try that again.
00:06:07.104 - 00:06:49.654, Speaker B: All right, let's start with a short demo of nested. So the first time you rob on nested, of course you have to choose a network. Nested is currently available on Avalanche, BNB chain, Ethereum, Polygon and optimism. I chose optimism for this demo because it delivers the best user experience and then you have to connect your wallet. So once you have done that, you can create a portfolio from scratch or replicate another user's portfolio. You have to know that portfolios on nested are tokenized in the form of an NFT. So you don't manage all the assets one by one.
00:06:49.654 - 00:07:19.650, Speaker B: All the assets of your portfolio one by one. You only own one and single asset that is an NFT. And this represents your portfolio. So if you want to create a portfolio, it's a three step process. The first step is to set a budget, then to select all the assets you want to add in your portfolio. And you can, at this step, you can also allocate your budget between all those assets. So there, I selected four tokens.
00:07:19.650 - 00:07:54.330, Speaker B: I want to allocate the budget this way. And last step is just to set a name, let's say Rudy's portfolio. We can add some hashtags, defy l two and I can create my portfolio. There is a summary, of course, of all the purchases I want to make. And I can click on create your portfolio button. Metamask, of course, is popping up and I just confirm the creation of the portfolio. So let's see.
00:07:54.400 - 00:08:02.670, Speaker A: Very cool. It's so much fun to do this on optimism because it's fast and it's easy. It's cheap.
00:08:03.170 - 00:08:03.920, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:08:06.290 - 00:08:09.258, Speaker A: In this case, in this case, trading.
00:08:09.274 - 00:08:21.960, Speaker B: It, it was expensive, but usually, let's say it's a demo effect, but usually you pay one or two USD on optimism and it will be cheaper in the future.
00:08:22.810 - 00:09:08.690, Speaker A: Yeah, that's been my experience. And then what you're doing there then is this is one example of how nested lets you bundle all these transactions. So that otherwise, if I were to go and create this portfolio manually, I have to know how to go to a dex aggregator, I have to know how to go to something like uniswap. And then I've got a lot of trades there I've got to do. If you're trading from ether into those four tokens there, that alone is four transactions. Consider if you start with an ERC 20 token, now you're having to do an approval transaction as well. So it's just a lot of time and effort saved.
00:09:09.110 - 00:09:55.634, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And so once you have created your portfolio, you can share it with your committee members, your friends, your family members. And if you publish it on social networks, there will be a beautiful overview of all your holdings. So people don't have to click on it to see what there is inside you see there is a beautiful overview of the portfolio. And of course, if they want to, they can click on this link and copy your portfolio. So once you have created your portfolio, and we won't pick the portfolio we just created, but the portfolio created before, you can manage it really easily, so you can update it at any time you want. If you want to sell a part of your position, you can do it just this way.
00:09:55.634 - 00:10:39.374, Speaker B: Let's say you want to sell 50% of my Libra and of my ETH I can do it this way. Then let's say I also want to exceed the I finally want to exit the market. I can do it in one click. I just click on sell all and then all the tokens there will be sold. The NFT that has been minted at the creation will be sent to the blacker address, will be burnt and I will get back inside my metamask wallet the intransic value, the market value of the portfolio that is 0.1 ETH. Then I can also send this portfolio to someone else.
00:10:39.374 - 00:11:41.170, Speaker B: So instead of sending all the tokens one by one, I just have to transfer the NFT that represents the portfolio. So I'm gaining some time and some money. Of course, because the gas will spend will be much less than by the gas will spend by sending the NFT will be much less than sending six assets with six different transactions. If you don't feel inspired, you still can browse any portfolios from decentralized applications. So there I just want to, you can see the best performing portfolios, the most copied ones, the most trusted portfolios. Let's say I want to replicate the portfolio on optimism and I want to replicate, let's say this one. So okay, it's a stable coin portfolio.
00:11:41.170 - 00:12:26.290, Speaker B: In one click. I can copy this portfolio just this way and the person I replicate will receive royalties. So once if someone replicates your portfolio, you receive notification. You receive notification directly from the Netic dap there and you can claim your royalty there. So there. I can see that replication happened 15 days ago and I earned this amount of ETH, let's say. Now I replicated the portfolio.
00:12:26.290 - 00:13:11.940, Speaker B: Every time the owner of the original portfolio applies a change, I receive a notification either on the nested application, but it can also be on Telegram. If you decided to link your Twitter account, your Telegram account with your nested account. So you can receive real time notifications directly on Telegram. And every time you're not up to date with the original portfolio, you are notified and you can apply the changes in one click. So there, this portfolio is a copy. There are some updates available, I can check them. Okay.
00:13:11.940 - 00:13:23.400, Speaker B: Usually it works. Okay, let me switch off network demo effect. It can happen.
00:13:26.650 - 00:13:31.720, Speaker A: No, same thing for me. Every time I go to demo something I'm like great.
00:13:32.650 - 00:14:18.022, Speaker B: Even like with investors it happens all the time. But anyway, so we are on Polygon now. Okay, there is a portfolio I copied and this portfolio is not updated. We still can see Luna there. So let's check and apply the changes. Okay, it worked so we can see that the original user of portfolio swapped all their lunar formatic. And so we can see the new allocation, so we can see the one I have right now and I can apply the changes in one click.
00:14:18.022 - 00:15:37.280, Speaker B: So even if you missed 20 updates, you still can synchronize your portfolio with the original one in one click and unnested. Last thing before talking about the future, you can create a profile. So nested is at the crossroads of social media and a crypto trading platform. So you can create a profile, so you can set up a Bo link your Telegram account, just as I told you, link your Twitter account so people will trust, I mean, it's just a question of trust when they will check your profile. And then if you share your profile with your friends, family members, committee members, they will be able to pick a portfolio and copy it in one click. And so I think we made a good deal of the platform. Yes, go ahead.
00:15:38.870 - 00:17:06.070, Speaker A: A few things to call out here. So one of the, I think, downfalls of token sets, the social trading sets, which was like really a spin off of a really popular set of products that were just token sets that automated different strategies, there were like these moving average crossovers and just stuff that sort of demonstrated the power of automating strategy on chain with smart contracts. And while that was exciting and promising at one point, eventually those products pivoted more into indexes, which have been, I think, a fairly popular sort of defi product. What I love about this with nested is there is already a culture in crypto of wanting to follow others, for better or worse. Sometimes. Obviously we have folks on Twitter tweeting that they're making whatever moves or that they did whatever trade, and it could be long after the fact here you can follow someone and see their moves in real time, and obviously you can see their performance as well to determine whether or not anyone has any idea what they're doing. It's verifiable, it's auditable instantly.
00:17:06.070 - 00:18:15.342, Speaker A: And the fact that you don't have to give up control of your funds, I think there's a flaw in any platform where you're allowing someone else to be 100% in control of all of those decisions. Like you're putting a lot of trust. And I think most of us too. If you look back at the performance of most traders, it's like one of, one of 1% are able to actually outperform something like ether. So this, to me just, it gives you the control you want because I'm still 100% in control of my own portfolio. But then if I'm following you, Rudy, and I like some of the moves you've made, and I haven't copied any of those, this platform makes it easy for me to follow whatever is the latest move, or whichever one of them is interesting to me, and bundle all of those transactions, which to me is kind of like taking from the power of zaps. That's part of what got me interested in wanting to work at Zapper originally was bundling transactions makes life easy for newcomers in DeFi.
00:18:15.342 - 00:18:20.100, Speaker A: And so there's just lots of benefits here that are all tied into one product.
00:18:21.130 - 00:19:08.382, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And like copy trading has been a battle tested model. Itoro is a big product there. Yes, exactly. So it's a model that has been battle tested. Web three is a very difficult topic for most people in this planet, and so we need social finance to guide those people, you see, and really like a big thing to have in mind. So builders and other active traders, we are 100% active in this space, but there are less than 1 million people, less than 1 million defi users worldwide.
00:19:08.382 - 00:19:34.140, Speaker B: And I'm sure that the next wave will be the conversion of CFI users into DeFi users. And it's really important to understand that, that we have during this bear market, we have to build all the products that will enable this conversion, you see.
00:19:34.910 - 00:20:04.040, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. Well, this might also be then a good time for us to talk about some of the future updates that will come to the product, like some of the enhanced abilities. But don't let me cut you off here. Do you think there's anything else in terms of the background and context to why you built this, anything else here in your deck that you wanted to share?
00:20:04.890 - 00:20:09.750, Speaker B: No, I think that's fine. We can jump on the next milestones.
00:20:10.490 - 00:20:31.818, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess what would be next? One thing we'll talk about in just a bit is there is a token that will be released. This was already announced, and there's an ongoing campaign basically to earn that token. But before we talk about that, anything else product related or. Actually, yeah, let's talk about the airdrop.
00:20:31.994 - 00:21:52.790, Speaker B: Let's talk about the airdrop. So first, the token isn't public yet, so we didn't deploy the token yet, but you still have the chance to the opportunity to accumulate it. So how can you accumulate this token just by using the platform? So we reward you according to the volume you generate, trading volume you generate on nested the number of copies you have, the number of networks you use, and of course the value of all the copies issued from your portfolios. So you can find more information about the Adrob directly in our documentation. It's really well explained. And every week at each epoch, one epoch lasts one week, you will earn NST tokens and of course those NFT will be claimable at the token generation event, the TG. So everything is there guys, you can just visit documentation and far more tokens.
00:21:53.550 - 00:22:17.802, Speaker A: Yeah, once the token is launched. Also, what enhancements will there be in terms of what we can do today with nested? One of the things that I can assume here is it decentralizes governance, of course. But is there anything else to call out in advance for utility of the token?
00:22:17.946 - 00:23:07.150, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So as you told the governance, it won't only be proposal, but also to adjust protocol metrics. So you will be able to adjust the fees, the distribution of those fees, et cetera. You will also benefit from a discount on platform fees and you will be able to pay the platform fees with NFT token. Also you will be able to benefit from staking rewards. So we share a part of our profit with the token stakers. Of course there will be a mechanism like you can see on curve Platypus or other V tokens.
00:23:07.150 - 00:23:48.880, Speaker B: So the more NSA you stake and the longer you load them and the higher will be your reward and your weight in the governance. And one feature I really like is the bribery of feature. So on the Explorer, there will be featured portfolios, but you won't pay the team to get your portfolio featured. Instead you will bribe the governance with NFC tokens, you see, and you will appear at the top of the Explorer page. I mean your portfolio will appear at the top of the Explorer page.
00:23:49.810 - 00:24:07.460, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. So there's quite a few ways that the token I think will be used in pretty familiar uses to other utility tokens we've seen. Can you talk a bit about what are those enhancements that will come.
00:24:09.350 - 00:24:09.666, Speaker B: To.
00:24:09.688 - 00:25:21.594, Speaker A: The ability to have a portfolio that is doing everything on chain like right now, we're talking strictly about what do you hold and do I want to copy that portfolio. And if you rebalance, I can get a notification, which we need to get EPNS notifications on there. But if I'm getting that currently through Telegram or the nested app, and hopefully in the future EPNS notifications, then I'm able to be updated in real time and then make my own decision whether or not I want to copy that move and bundle all the transactions. What about farming though? Basically everything that I just described, I would personally never want someone to be copying me trading. But if I am talking about stablecoin farming, that's totally different. That's where I feel like I personally and others are able to thrive because you're in most cases not risking a principal unless there's some sort of unexpected exploit. Oh, there we go.
00:25:21.594 - 00:25:25.660, Speaker A: I'll reshare your screen. So, yeah, when are those farming strategies coming?
00:25:28.050 - 00:26:31.546, Speaker B: Yes, so today it's only about trading strategies. Of course it was. I mean, the layer zero of publishing, we had to start with spot positions. But in the near future, and I hope this summer, you will also be able to build complex strategies that will make you earn passive income. And so you will be able, in what transaction? To buy some assets and save them on AV. For instance, to get some yield on staked out on neon finance and many other protocols that generate yield. And let's say, kravitz, you create a strategy with USDC, USDT die, and you decide to lend those assets on Av.
00:26:31.546 - 00:27:12.730, Speaker B: So let's say this strategy generates 5% of APY. I am one of your committee members, I don't know how to do that, but it looks great. I can earn with stable coins 5% of APY. So I will copy your portfolio and in one click, in one transaction, all of the assets will be purchased and all the assets will also be saved on AV. And thanks because I earn a passive income, thanks to your strategy, because I replicated your strategy, then you will also earn a part of my interest. Okay. And those will be royalties.
00:27:12.730 - 00:28:11.760, Speaker B: So you can empower your community. So of course you can explain them how it works, how to do that. But still, some people won't understand it, but they will be able to execute all the strategy in one click on nested. And we are talking about staking, lending, ultimate strategies. But there will also be strategies with some borrowing, and also before the end of the year or the beginning of next year, you will also be able to put your nested NFT as collateral. So the NFT you mean at the creation of a nested portfolio, you will be able to put it as collateral to borrow money. So you will borrow against your.
00:28:11.760 - 00:28:26.120, Speaker B: So with one single asset that is your netted NFT, you will benefit from a maximum borrowing power.
00:28:27.530 - 00:29:30.634, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. So there's a number of what I think are truly net new Defi products coming. What we're calling a social trading platform today, I think really turns into a social DeFi platform, which for me encompasses just putting assets to work. Putting to work what you already hold where you're not risking the principal. I would love to be able to actually share in real time more of the stablecoin farming that I do, or some of the LPs where I'm using like assets like Steth and F in a curve LP. A lot of those moves are very difficult for any newcomer to follow. At the end of the day, while it's not financial advice to someone that you should do XYZ, the truth is people learn by doing.
00:29:30.634 - 00:30:17.290, Speaker A: And so this to me is an example of a platform that, it's almost like an enablement type of platform. It helps someone basically to skip the complexity of many steps which are normally required in some of the simpler know strategies that are out there. Unless of course you're just going to go lend or stake some of your assets. But Rudy, anything else here you think that folks should know about? I guess where to get started on nested. Here we're looking at the explorer, which you can start to sift through the 900 plus portfolios and rank them by performance or whatever token exposure or network you prefer.
00:30:18.910 - 00:30:46.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we told enough things. I know that people attention might be hard to get after 30 minutes live. So just like if there are some questions in the chat, or if you have also some additional questions, even if you know the product, Travis, you can ask.
00:30:47.350 - 00:31:09.286, Speaker A: No, just one last question. You mentioned it earlier, but when does the campaign to earn this future NST token end? Do we have a final date for when that program ends and when the token is expected to actually generate?
00:31:09.478 - 00:31:42.660, Speaker B: Yeah, so it ends at the end of the 20 eigth epoch. So currently we are at the 6th epoch, and so there are still 22 weeks left. It's not sure that we will launch the token after all those epochs end. We might continue the distribution with additional reward for our community.
00:31:43.750 - 00:32:43.378, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, cool. TLDR here is for those that are using nested. They're essentially earning credit in this future airdrop, but there is no finalized date for that, which, I mean, frankly, I think this is the sort of market too, where it's good for everyone to get back to the fundamentals of just using and trying and experimenting with new products. I think really understanding fundamentally what new permissionless access defi actually offers here. A lot of the features that we walk through there, those were not even available a few years ago, just to rebalance a portfolio in a few clicks. Most of those moves I made using zaps by defi, zap, and eventually zapper being able to use that to get into LPs.
00:32:43.378 - 00:33:22.470, Speaker A: But this idea of bundling transactions is really useful. And then, of course, just the social features of it. And what, again, is verifiable. There's a lot of folks who claim to make whatever moves, whether it's on social media or whether it's in like a discord group. And I would personally attest that I think most of that is it's always like announcing these moves later and after the fact, or in some cases talking about moves that were actually never made.
00:33:22.540 - 00:33:26.614, Speaker B: Or even like, deleting the tweet. Exactly.
00:33:26.732 - 00:34:04.820, Speaker A: Yeah. And so if anything, you can get on nested and start to look at different portfolios and sort of back test different strategies that were, were not working. And I'll tell you, over the last few months, it becomes pretty obvious just holding stable coins. Obviously, those folks have done really well. But also, I think it's a reminder, too, of just how difficult it is to outperform a token like ether that is like now an established store value type of token. But Rudy, anything else to share here before we go? I think we just about covered it.
00:34:05.430 - 00:34:41.310, Speaker B: One last thing is that Netseed is available on mobile friendly. So you can already use netsed on the convey wallet application, on the metamask mobile app application. And we are also currently thinking about a mobile app and iOS application and Google application. We are A, B, two C company, and we do think that an application, a mobile application, is needed to target our users.
00:34:42.130 - 00:34:45.440, Speaker A: Rudy, are you all hiring for any roles right now?
00:34:46.770 - 00:34:59.346, Speaker B: No, we just hired six additional developers, so right now we are fine. But thanks, Travis, for.
00:34:59.528 - 00:35:11.160, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, cool. Well, if anyone's interested to get started with or to learn more about nested, they can go to nested Phi, they can follow nested and you on.
00:35:12.890 - 00:35:28.000, Speaker B: But still, if you feel you can contribute to nested, then just ping me on Twitter, my DM open, and then we'll talk together.
00:35:28.530 - 00:35:56.920, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. And then if you enjoyed this interview, of course you can subscribe at Defi. Dad. And we'll continue to weekly do reviews of different DeFi products like this one and lots more, and try to continue to interview founders and builders like Rudy. So anyways, thanks for tuning in, everyone. And Rudy, thanks for your time. And I'm going to end the broadcast here in just a moment, so we'll be in a room.
00:35:56.920 - 00:35:59.906, Speaker A: All right, thanks, everyone. Bye.
