00:00:06.490 - 00:00:21.274, Speaker A: If you can hear one of my children running around in the background. Hey, everyone. Thanks for tuning in. This is DFI talks with Dfi dad. It's Monday, December 13, 2021. I'm excited. Today we're going to talk about a new DFI protocol.
00:00:21.274 - 00:01:03.722, Speaker A: So nothing better than starting off the week learning about a new, new, fundamentally valuable defi protocol. So it's called spool. Spool is a protocol that really is going to play off of some concepts that we're all familiar with. At the end of the day, users can deposit money into something that's similar to a vault. It allows you then to specify, let's say, which assets you put in, what risk models, which. We're going to talk about how that sort of separates spool from competitors, and then what strategies to use to earn yield. So I've got with me one of the core contributors from Spool, Phil.
00:01:03.722 - 00:01:15.460, Speaker A: And I'm going to let Phil tell us more about Spool and basically how one can get involved if they're interested to contribute to the protocol. So, Phil, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:15.990 - 00:01:38.634, Speaker B: Hey, doing really well. A little bit excited because of the occasion. Today is a special day. We'll get to that a little bit later, I think. But, yeah, I'm really happy to be here. Talk spool with you, present it a little bit and go a little in depth about some of the, I think, unique things and vision that we have for spool over at the Boulders team.
00:01:38.832 - 00:02:18.006, Speaker A: Yeah. So, Phil, last week, I think you guys had an AMA with balancer. So, yes, worth noting, actually, as we talk through this. This is a protocol that isn't live yet, so we're going to try to walk through how it all works again. What's unique about it, but as I mentioned, balancer, the balancer liquidity, bootstrapping pools, LBPs, which power copper launch. There is a part 5% of the total token supply that just launched literally minutes ago on copper launch. So we'll end with that.
00:02:18.006 - 00:02:39.150, Speaker A: Just any sort of details there for folks, if they're interested, to learn again, more about how to actually get involved with the spool token. But let's start with your background, Phil. What else have you worked on? I know you've been working on spool for about, you were saying like a year and a half. What else have you worked on or contributed in DFI?
00:02:40.610 - 00:02:59.414, Speaker B: Well, I think DFI 2020 was sort of a change in paradigm for crypto as a whole, because I think kind of governance tokens kind of came out of the shadow of the utility tokens. And there was like a new distribution mechanism associated with them, yield farming as we all know it.
00:02:59.452 - 00:02:59.990, Speaker C: Right?
00:03:00.140 - 00:04:00.214, Speaker B: So back then, I was sort of lucky to be at the forefront of everything and just follow it life, follow the evolution of the whole scene life. And as we all know, a lot of crazy stuff happened back then, right? And lots of new ideas, experiments and so on. Been participating in a lot of them, I think, from the first day on. And obviously also because of my general activity in the blockchain space, as an advisor to some projects, doing a lot of early investing and being in touch with founders, I got to discuss a lot of the ideas and the thought processes that led to them back then. And I also met a lot of people that were interacting with DeFi at the start and basically evolving the way they think about DeFi alongside the evolution of the industry, which happens, there's disruption, basically on a weekly cycle.
00:04:00.262 - 00:04:00.474, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:00.512 - 00:05:09.994, Speaker B: Early on, because everything's just so fast and people iterate so quickly, also because everything can be forked and iterated on so easily. Even then, all of these conversations kind of sparked an idea about how will we aggregate all of this? So we had all of these new DeFi primitives pop up as ways to generate yield, right? And they showed clear advantages over traditional finance in that they were democratically accessible. So in traditional finance, because of laws that protect investors, at least in name. Right, not everyone can get access to the same deals, right. We all know that some of the best deals are reserved to, for example, accredited investors. And I think what we all thought was exciting about DeFi back then was that that wasn't the case. But if we think about accessibility of DeFi, I think even though on paper it's accessible to anyone, I think it's kind of a technocracy still, because you have to have a lot of expertise and knowledge to safely interact with DeFi, right? So back then, an idea kind of spawned about making an app that would make DeFi more accessible.
00:05:09.994 - 00:05:52.830, Speaker B: But that app quickly turned into a lot more because we figured that DeFi, like traditional finance, DeFi, will need an equivalent of a financial services industry. Because I think, in reality, I think most people, like the risk averse majority, doesn't want to be their own bank, right? Because that sounds scary to a lot of people. I think the majority of people want to let money be money and just make sure it's safe and earns them some kind of yield, hopefully beat inflation, and then they want to go on with their lives, right? Well, the idea was, how could a decentralized financial services industry look like.
00:05:52.900 - 00:05:53.518, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:53.684 - 00:06:37.286, Speaker B: And I think we've seen a lot of attempts of defi wallets, UXs, neo banks, kind of tapping into DeFi. But the problem was that all of these had to bridge a very large gap of tapping into the Defi primitives directly and then building not only infrastructure themselves, but also build out a product that is targeted at a certain user base. And spool wants to make this huge gap a lot smaller by basically creating a new framework, a new ecosystem, an open toolbox that can serve as the baseline for creators to create financial services that tap into all of stablecoin DeFi.
00:06:37.398 - 00:06:38.010, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:38.160 - 00:06:57.702, Speaker B: And an open toolbox to do that needs to be completely permissionless, and it needs to be able to organically grow with DeFi, because after, for example, spool launches, DeFi will keep evolving. There will be new primitives, new ways of generating yield and stablecoins, new protocols that need liquidity.
00:06:57.786 - 00:06:58.034, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:58.072 - 00:07:33.210, Speaker B: And spool needs to be an open platform to tap into all of those. And now we're getting to what spool is, right. It's sort of creating, we're trying to space out this new middle layer between creators for financial services and end users. And then the yield generators, the DeFi protocols, the primitives at the sort of bottom that are actually doing the work of using capital provided as liquidity to perform some sort of value adding task that then in the end generates yield that is paid out to the people that provide capital as an incentive to provide that capital as liquidity.
00:07:33.290 - 00:07:33.774, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:33.892 - 00:07:47.060, Speaker B: So this middle layer, that's what spool is trying to sort of occupy and define as a way for creators to easily tap into DeFi as a whole.
00:07:49.110 - 00:08:54.120, Speaker A: Yeah, it kind of reminds me of. I've got some follow up questions for you about this, but it kind of reminds me of token sets, but there are some novel elements here that we can talk through. I think the thing that stood out the most for me is the risk strategy or risk models that you can choose along the way. So if you think about the spool as translate that to being a vault, and if you think about which assets you're going to input, which, we'll kind of walk through what some of the user interface will look like here, at the end of the day, it's just giving you more building blocks or Lego pieces as you piece together your vault. And I think that is leading us then to what is a set and forget type of strategy. Anytime. We enable users to be able to choose what assets to earn yield with, decide upon like a strategy in this case, also decide upon a risk model.
00:08:54.120 - 00:09:22.830, Speaker A: Great. Once we do that, we're all set to go and folks can sort of sit back versus having to sit there and continually, let's say, farm yield tokens and redeposit those and so on. So anyways, yeah, this leads to more of a question around, I guess, what is truly unique about spool? Or what are we doing to separate spool from its competitors?
00:09:24.150 - 00:10:12.682, Speaker B: I think the uniqueness of spool is that it allows the whole system to completely leverage economics of scale by aggregating and bundling transactions for rebalances while still allowing individual users to completely express their own terms of engagement for DeFi. And that means select the strategies you want to be exposed to. You're never going to be exposed to any other strategies. Select the risk model that is provided by DAO curated experts that defines the risk of the strategies that you've selected. Because there's multiple approaches to risk. We can chat about that in a bit if you want to. And then also, lastly, now that we know the strategies that we want to access and the risk that is associated with them, the third ingredient is your personal risk tolerance.
00:10:12.682 - 00:12:03.506, Speaker B: How much of that risk am I willing to take on to potentially get more yield, right? And once we have all of that, we can now constantly maximize and optimize for your own personal risk adjusted yield. And I think risk adjusted yield here is the keyword, because risk in DeFi is kind of hard to estimate, right? So I think there's multiple ways to go about risk, and that is, for example, a quantitative approach. Some people just use the efficient market hypothesis, right? They glance over something and say, if the yield's low, probably the risk is low, right? Other people might use something like the Lindy effect to judge risk, right? So if there's a contract out there with billions of dollars locked in it and it's been out for a year, you can probably assume that it's safe simply based on the merit or safer than others based on the merit of it just being around for so long and not having been hacked or exploited, especially if it's unupgradable, right? And there is no ways of tampering with it compared to a new protocol that just came out yesterday containing like 10 million. Because probably any hacks are more likely to be still trying to be figured out by bad actors, right? So with spool, once you've created, once you've set all your terms, essentially you can deploy that as a spool, what we call a individual spool on the Ethereum mainnet. And that spool now represents your personal terms to defi, essentially because it recorded all the strategies, all the risk model and your risk tolerance. If you deposit into that, your spool immediately routes your funds straight to the master spool smart contract. And the master spool aggregates all spools together.
00:12:03.506 - 00:13:18.460, Speaker B: So even though your and my spool might look different based on our personal preferences, our funds are routed together, and the master spool is sort of, you can imagine it like the central smart accounting brain that aggregates all the terms of the individual spools and their weightings and their allocations, and then distributes those to the individual strategy adapters. And the strategy adapters are essentially what interact with the individual strategies that spool supports. So you might have like adapters for convex, for Ave, and so on, right? And even though you and I might not have the same spool, we might be overlapping in some strategies. So if we now need to rebalance, because spool constantly optimizes for best risk adjusted yield, and we all know that yield in defi, they're not static, they vary, right? So if yield drops off in one strategy where you and I are both exposed to, then we can now rebalance to other strategies to again optimize for best risk adjusted yield together, batching our transactions, right? So any spool added there is no fractionalization even if it's a small spool, right, it's still going to benefit from all of the optimization. And rebalancing as a very big spool might be because it's all getting managed by the master spool smart contract anyways, right?
00:13:22.210 - 00:13:54.498, Speaker A: Phil, if I'm in a spool or vault, and let's say I enter it and it's earning like an estimated annualized return of 10%, and it drops off, let's say, to 1%, and I see another spool or AK vault that's earning 20%, is there gas savings to enjoy there? Like, just because I'm already in a spool when you talk about the master spool contract and these different spools.
00:13:54.674 - 00:16:12.900, Speaker B: So in that case, because we need to ensure like, safety first, right? So keep in mind that spools are intended to be used through the spool SDK as back ends for potentially personal finance apps and other finance products, right? As a routing tool, you would have to withdraw from that spool and redeposit it into another spool. However, it needs to be said that a spool that drops from 10% to 1% is probably not a very well, set up spool, because a good spool is diversified, because diversification is a core point of risk management, right? And if you select the strategies you truly trust, right. Then if one of the strategies drops off so dramatically to tank your yield like that, your spool would likely rebalance into other spool, into other strategies that you've selected to continue to give you the best risk adjusted yield, right, and the gas savings, well, they occur basically from the start, right? Because if you think about it, right now, a lot of end users are completely priced out of DeFi on ETH. And it's a shame, because I think a ton of all of the worthwhile innovation, or most of the worthwhile innovation in DFI is still happening on ETH, right? So it's a shame that users are kind of priced out of using the originals for a lot of concepts in DFI. And the cool thing is that with spool, even if you select ten different strategies, you diversify into, once you deposit into your spool, it's one transaction, it should be priced around the cost of a swap on uniswap, right? And then since you're in the buffer system of spool, all your transactions essentially get handled internally through the system, right, through do hard work that gets called from a whitelisted address, and you only pay that one transaction fee, and then you're in your spool. And from there on out, your initial allocation into all the strategies that you've selected, as well as the rebalances, compounding transactions, et cetera, occurring internally, are all going to be covered by the system. So users are now, because they can also select so many strategies, there is no need to again withdraw and deposit into another strategy that might have gotten better yield over the last week, right.
00:16:12.900 - 00:16:52.462, Speaker B: As you all probably know from using DEFA and ETH. I mean, if you've all made the same experiences as me, that happens quite frequently. All of this is basically a thing of the past, right, because you can simply define front load, all your decision makings of these strategies, I trust this is how much risk I'm willing to take. This is how I define risk. Once you've made and front loaded all these decisions, spool keeps tabs of that, and you basically create a frame of reference in which you're willing to operate with your funds and will always stay within these frames of reference, within this frame of reference and optimize from there, right? And that's the cool thing. Very cool.
00:16:52.516 - 00:16:52.734, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:52.772 - 00:17:05.334, Speaker A: Well said. No, totally did. I'm actually thinking we should show off what it looks like from the user standpoint, do you mind if I start sharing your screen? And then we can kind of walk.
00:17:05.372 - 00:17:08.050, Speaker B: Through and I can give my disclaimer.
00:17:08.210 - 00:17:20.200, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So the product is not live yet. So we're really talking through a design, a mockup of this, but I think the key components are there.
00:17:21.710 - 00:17:22.694, Speaker B: The code is finished.
00:17:22.742 - 00:17:22.954, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:22.992 - 00:17:45.934, Speaker B: It's getting audited, and we should be live with that by February, obviously. I think having a UX demo early on is important not only to show it to people, but also it was very helpful for us internally because having everything visualized helps get everyone on the same line, because just communicating it verbally often creates misunderstandings.
00:17:45.982 - 00:17:47.762, Speaker A: Right, absolutely.
00:17:47.896 - 00:17:48.434, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:48.552 - 00:17:53.540, Speaker A: It's so much easier for me to understand these applications when I see it live.
00:17:54.070 - 00:17:54.578, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:54.664 - 00:18:09.110, Speaker A: So, yeah, kind of just talk us through what we're looking at here. What are those steps to someone creating a spool? Or again, if anyone's just joining, think of a spool as like a vault.
00:18:09.770 - 00:18:22.006, Speaker B: Yeah. So when you open the spool app, right, and you've connected your wallet, the first thing you're going to see is all the other available spools. So all the other terms of engagements that people created on chain.
00:18:22.038 - 00:18:22.426, Speaker C: Right. Right.
00:18:22.448 - 00:18:45.022, Speaker B: Now we only have a test vault here, and you can check, actually, what are other people doing, right. So you can see the strategies that they're using and fees that might be involved. So any spool creator can show a performance fee. And you can see also here, what's the current allocation of that spool? Like how much does it have in which strategy, what's the risk rating and what's the yield of that strategy?
00:18:45.086 - 00:18:45.362, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:45.416 - 00:19:30.850, Speaker B: So this one would be diversified over four different strategies, for example. But if you're not happy with the selection, you want to just make your own. Right, you go to create a spool, and there's a five step process. So spool, the difference to, I think, a lot of other protocols that provide composability and DeFi Legos, you mentioned set protocol, for example, is that spool has a laser focus on stablecoin deFi, because I think that stablecoin DeFi is really what's going to be the breakthrough to mainstream for DeFi. Because I think, again, the majority of people are not people in the crypto bubble. The majority of people are still risk averse, and I think most of them are just first and foremost afraid of losing things.
00:19:30.920 - 00:19:31.346, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:31.448 - 00:19:46.854, Speaker B: So I think DeFi for stablecoins offers very attractive returns on dollar packed assets, even like, so attractive that people won't believe it if you first tell them about it.
00:19:46.892 - 00:19:47.190, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:47.260 - 00:20:11.258, Speaker B: So that's why spool is focusing on stablecoins only for the beginning. And here you can select the stablecoin that your spool is going to be compatible with in terms of deposits. We've taken the top three stablecoins here, Dai, USDC and USDT. Let's select Dai here because I like maker. Let's go next. And here we can see the risk models.
00:20:11.274 - 00:20:11.646, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:11.748 - 00:21:00.222, Speaker B: Again, the risk models are essentially what defines your approach to risk. And we've made that open because we had internally a lot of discussions about how to rate different protocols in terms of riskiness. And I know that there's a lot of DAOs out there, like a shout out here to, for example, Prime Dao, who have a Dao called prime ratings that is simply only designed to have experts in it that give different ratings to different strategies. Right? And that's their way of determining risk. It's like wisdom of the crowds of a selected crowd of experts. But really, you can come up with any kind of methodology to determine risk, present it to the spooldao. If the Spooldao thinks it's valuable to be provided here as a tool for creators, then it will show up in the list.
00:21:00.222 - 00:21:05.650, Speaker B: So here, for example, it's a lot of lorem ipsum still, because it will be filled later.
00:21:05.720 - 00:21:06.002, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:06.056 - 00:21:12.046, Speaker B: You can see the summary of how this potential risk model would define risk.
00:21:12.078 - 00:21:12.274, Speaker C: Right?
00:21:12.312 - 00:21:28.870, Speaker B: Click on full details for, let's say, a whole paper that describes the methodology with which the risk scores are determined. Or here, if you want some social proof, you can see other spools that are using this risk model right already for their risk.
00:21:29.310 - 00:21:42.030, Speaker A: Do you have any expectation of what the fees on yield will be like? Will it be a percentage? Will it be a flat fee? Has any of that been discussed?
00:21:43.010 - 00:22:18.390, Speaker B: We'll get to that in step five. Right. Then I'll get into fees real quick. So once we found a way, a good model that aligns with our own sort of definition of what risk should be looked like or defined as in defi, we click next and we get to the heart of it where we select the strategies. For now, we only have protocol names here as a placeholder, but obviously things like curve and convex, they're going to have a lot of supported strategies because there's a lot of pools there, right? So we select the ones that we want to include that we trust.
00:22:18.460 - 00:22:18.694, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:18.732 - 00:22:22.630, Speaker B: I'm just selecting randomly, so if anyone watches, I'm not judging.
00:22:22.710 - 00:22:23.386, Speaker C: Right?
00:22:23.568 - 00:22:24.300, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:24.830 - 00:22:45.434, Speaker B: So let's just select a few here, or let's just select all of them so no one can judge me. And now we click next, right? And now we get, I think, to the coolest part. And again, this is not dynamic. It would be a lot cooler if it is dynamic. So if you're watching, just imagine it would be dynamic.
00:22:45.482 - 00:22:45.838, Speaker C: Right?
00:22:45.924 - 00:23:35.242, Speaker B: So now we know what strategies we want to be exposed to and how we define their risks. So now all of these strategies here will have a risk rating and a yield that is grabbed by an oracle, right? So now we have the yield and the risk associated with it. And most of the time, higher APY will correlate with higher risk, right, simply because that's where the equilibrium will sort of lie at some point. So now here we can move a slider that determines how much of this risk are we willing to take on. And that will life change the allocation here. Like if we move it up, it will become less sensitive to the risk rending and more sensitive to the yield. And if we move it down, it's the other way around, right, and that will give us an idea of what our spool, our settings will basically create in terms of annualized.
00:23:35.242 - 00:23:58.314, Speaker B: APy API is already annualized, but you get the point. And once found our preferred risk tolerance, we click next. And now we get to the whole fees part. And I think it's important to provide some context here. So we always need to look at what's the value that kind of spool provides in this case.
00:23:58.352 - 00:23:58.554, Speaker C: Right?
00:23:58.592 - 00:25:47.334, Speaker B: So it saves gas fees, it compounds, it's free to use, and it saves a lot of time, and it constantly optimizes for risk adjusted yield. So it should also optimize the amount of stable coins that you're actually earning because of the constant reallocations to keep yield as high as possible within your given framework, right. And as a creator, you might be wanting to use this as a product, sort of. Imagine like think of for example, Shopify in the real world, right? Some people in the Dow hate me for that example because it's a little bit crude. But a lot of people are very good at creating shops that are targeted to individual users, selling them the things that they want, right? But these same people might not necessarily be good or knowledgeable enough to create the whole shop infrastructure and code a webshop from the ground up, right? And it's very similar for also financial products in Defi, right? So you might not be able to create the sort of infrastructure that spool provides yourself, but you might be able to know just the thing or just the strategy to entice a completely new generation of defi users to go in through the UX and the website or the app that you've designed to engage this user group, right? So if you're creating this kind of spool, you're adding value to this user group because you're giving them access to defi that speaks to them, right? So you might be calling that your product spool, and now you might be setting a performance fee for yourself. And that's the whole thing about spool, right, is no management fee, only performance fee, only on profits. And these performance fees are only taken upon withdrawal.
00:25:47.334 - 00:26:30.098, Speaker B: So a creator might take, let's say, 5% fee for himself. This is reflected here. And then there's a spool Dow performance fee. And this is essentially the performance fee that goes to the spool Dow, right? So to spool token stakers and the Dow treasury and so on, right? And then there is a risk model performance fee as well. And that is if you're using someone's risk model to define your risk, that risk model provider is responsible to keep their risk scores updated and to constantly ensure that everything is going well. So for that, they're also getting a 1% fee. These fees are currently voted in through pre Dow governance, and they're obviously not set in stone.
00:26:30.098 - 00:27:22.860, Speaker B: So if you're watching this five years from now, they might have changed or even a year from now, because it's a governance vote that can pass that, right? And then essentially, there's your own performance fee on top of it. So for this spool, for example, ignore this number, it's not updating. The performance fee would be 16% on yield generated through that spool. And we kind of obviously tried to anticipate what numbers would be palatable, what would be competitive, what would be good. I know that urine is doing, I think, 2% management fee and 20% performance fee right? Now, correct me if I'm wrong, we obviously wanted to be competitive with that. I think convex has, like, a 16% performance fee as well. So this is sort of what we were orienting ourselves around.
00:27:22.860 - 00:27:37.840, Speaker B: And, yeah, once we've set everything to our liking, we can simply create spool. And now the spool will be created, there's going to be an ether scan link for it. And, yeah, there we are.
00:27:38.210 - 00:27:38.990, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:27:39.060 - 00:27:42.750, Speaker B: That's essentially the idea. And now if we're.
00:27:43.570 - 00:27:47.634, Speaker A: Oh, no, go ahead, Phil. What were you saying? Go ahead and finish up on the last thing.
00:27:47.672 - 00:27:48.260, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:48.870 - 00:27:50.942, Speaker B: If we're still the creator fee.
00:27:51.006 - 00:27:51.282, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:51.336 - 00:28:19.110, Speaker B: So here we can use the SDK to integrate that spool into any kind of front end that we might have, or we might even incentivize that spool within another ERC 20 token. So if I'm like a DFI wallet and I have my own token and I'm creating spools, so my DFI wallet has some unique strategies that are exclusive to my wallet because I've created them, right. Then I can also incentivize usage of these strategies with my own token.
00:28:19.190 - 00:28:19.482, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:19.536 - 00:28:46.870, Speaker B: To help my users potentially get yield on their stable coins, get some spool incentives that you might have gotten from being voted in by the Dow as an eligible spool. And then three, also the native token of that wallet. So users of that wallet can now basically get yield from three sources. So there's some cool tools as well to sort of incentivize your spools, right. And I think, yeah, there's more to talk about, but I don't want to overload.
00:28:48.810 - 00:29:27.250, Speaker A: One follow up to what you were showing when we were creating a spool. Can you give an example of one of the risk models? Like just the simplest sort of example? Because I think that's one part of this that can be like a black box to some where they're looking at it and they're like, okay, so what goes into it? And I will point out there was a link there you showed. So it's clear that someone will be able to read about it. But, yeah, any simple example you can give of what a risk model might look like and how it would affect the vault.
00:29:28.390 - 00:29:34.686, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, for example, one might. So the thing about risk models, we needed to keep them open ended.
00:29:34.718 - 00:29:34.914, Speaker C: Right?
00:29:34.952 - 00:29:44.050, Speaker B: So the only common thing that all risk models will have is that by the end of it, they will derive certain risk scores for each strategy.
00:29:44.130 - 00:29:44.518, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:44.604 - 00:30:08.202, Speaker B: And I think a simple risk model could be very qualitative. So let's say it uses metrics like is the team public or is it anonymous? Yes. No. Assign a score to that. Is the smart contract audited, yes or no? And if yes, by whom? What auditors. And then assigning also scores to these auditors.
00:30:08.266 - 00:30:08.494, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:08.532 - 00:30:20.738, Speaker B: And from these metrics, you can derive a risk score and then publish that methodology and give that methodology to the DAO. And then the DAO will essentially decide if it's worthwhile or not.
00:30:20.824 - 00:30:21.266, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:21.368 - 00:30:25.734, Speaker B: So does that make sense in terms of a qualitative risk model?
00:30:25.932 - 00:30:26.920, Speaker A: It does.
00:30:29.130 - 00:30:33.350, Speaker B: I can't give clear numbers right now because, sorry, I don't have them no.
00:30:33.500 - 00:31:00.000, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one thing that I'll look forward to is, as we see actual models get incorporated, if I as a user go to create a spool, I'm thinking about the uniformity of those scores. Like, as I'm looking at that bar that you showed where you choose the risk. That's the sort of thing.
00:31:00.770 - 00:31:09.460, Speaker B: But that's the risk tolerance. Right. It doesn't have to do anything with the risk scores. That's essentially you saying, how much risk am I willing to take on?
00:31:09.910 - 00:31:47.520, Speaker A: And that's what I mean to say, how to put that into context. But I know a part of this is we have to look forward to once the product is actually live and we've got those different examples of risk models that are thriving within spool because my gut is that a number of them are going to become very popular and they'll sort of dominate. It's something I saw with token sets play out. A number of the sets became very dominant and people, they want to use something that works that they know is performing well.
00:31:47.890 - 00:31:48.398, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:48.484 - 00:31:55.342, Speaker B: So we're going to publish our, we have our own obvious risk model for the start.
00:31:55.396 - 00:31:55.758, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:55.844 - 00:32:13.298, Speaker B: And we're going to publish the methodology very soon. So you can read up on that and we can talk about that then. But I think what you also meant was with the bar, like from minus ten to ten, it's about personal risk tolerance. And what you're saying is, well, my five might be different to your five, for example, or was that what you meant?
00:32:13.474 - 00:32:20.966, Speaker A: That's what I meant, yeah. Concern about folks understanding the scoring and what exactly a five means.
00:32:21.148 - 00:32:32.446, Speaker B: What's actually been suggested in a dowel, I don't know if you've seen in the pre dao was to have sort of like an optional sort of quiz that people can take to assess their own risk tolerance to help them.
00:32:32.468 - 00:32:33.360, Speaker A: I love that.
00:32:33.730 - 00:32:48.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that too. It was a really good suggestion. And I think it's also, what's the cool thing about the whole Dow idea, right. And having a permissionless product that is managed by also a decentralized group of people. Kind of novel.
00:32:48.910 - 00:32:49.298, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:49.384 - 00:32:54.002, Speaker B: And that's cool how collaboration can work that way.
00:32:54.056 - 00:32:54.274, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:54.312 - 00:33:05.574, Speaker B: And I'm looking forward to decentralizing it more now that the actual governance token is launching. And we can actually expand that and have that because that's actually an essential part of spool as well, is.
00:33:05.612 - 00:33:05.862, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:05.916 - 00:33:12.038, Speaker B: Decentralized governance. I said in the beginning, spool needs to grow with the Defi ecosystem.
00:33:12.134 - 00:33:12.586, Speaker C: Why?
00:33:12.688 - 00:34:31.074, Speaker B: Because imagine there is a new protocol coming out or a new strategy coming out that is super popular. For example, like, mim came out of nowhere, right, for a lot of people, and that's become quickly, it's blown up, become one of the most popular stablecoin strategies in crypto, right? So imagine now you are a spool user. You're in your spool, you're generally happy. Now something like mem pops up and you're like, wow, this is really cool. This is interesting, but I love using spool. And now you have the choice of removing all your capital from spool again and then going into that strategy manually. Or the spooldaw can simply be smart, have their hats on the ground and already pick up mim early on because there are really smart people out there that scout this stuff early on because obviously there's big economic incentive to do so, right? And having these people in the Dow scout out things and be like, guys, we should get on this research, this, talk to the team, see if it's worthwhile, and then get them included into spool early on, right? And this way, spool sort of needs the wisdom of the crowds to keep expanding and keep staying open because it's also the thing, right? When you have, like, a closed minded team or a closed group of people that determine strategies, it can get stale and elitist very quickly because you know how it is.
00:34:31.112 - 00:34:31.314, Speaker C: Right?
00:34:31.352 - 00:34:40.342, Speaker B: People stick to what they know. They stick to their guns. It's similar to people buying tokens and getting an emotional attachment to them because they've performed well for them in the past.
00:34:40.396 - 00:34:40.662, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:40.716 - 00:34:54.010, Speaker B: Everyone suffers from these biases, but for spool to work in the long term, we cannot have these biases. And I think the only way to do that is to collectively keep an open mind and be open for new voices that want to join in and make spool better.
00:34:54.080 - 00:34:54.506, Speaker C: Right?
00:34:54.608 - 00:35:03.706, Speaker B: And the token is designed to reward this as well because there's a Spooldao performance fee and that's derived from TVR total value routed.
00:35:03.738 - 00:35:03.934, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:03.972 - 00:35:29.906, Speaker B: Spool doesn't lock value. So we didn't choose TVL. We chose TVR because it routes value back to other defi protocols. So that's why I also say you asked for competitors early on. I don't feel like spool competes as much. It's a tool for creators and eventually also completely dormant users, potential users that will come into defi through spool. And then these people set their terms through individual spools.
00:35:29.906 - 00:35:47.562, Speaker B: They're expressing their own investment thesis. And then the master spool kind of aggregates these terms and then distributes and routes them to protocols. So spool can also serve as a very strong liquidity router that creates a lot of demand also from Daos and new protocols coming out.
00:35:47.616 - 00:35:47.930, Speaker C: Right?
00:35:48.000 - 00:36:20.530, Speaker B: And this is a narrative that's very strong right. Now with Convex, for example, which is something that people are starting to pick up on. That convex is super in demand with DAOs because convex controls a lot of the liquidity on curve, right? A lot of stablecoin liquidity. And to tap into that liquidity and to kind of create gorges that are well incentivized to attract liquidity from capital providers, a lot of dows are now buying up CVX to vote lock and control the curve CRV, the VCRV that is locked in convex.
00:36:20.610 - 00:36:21.240, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:22.250 - 00:36:28.920, Speaker B: Very complex, but I know that your watchers will know what I'm talking about. Right?
00:36:29.450 - 00:36:30.482, Speaker A: Absolutely interesting.
00:36:30.556 - 00:37:40.074, Speaker B: That's super interesting. And I think spool can have a sort of similar narrative because spool is used, or can be used by a lot of end users to represent their terms, right? So spool, the master spool smart contract, sees as a contract that represents the aggregate terms of all the capital providers in spool, right? All the people that are routing their capital through spool. And now spool distributes that liquidity to the best yield, depending on the risk rating, right? So if you have an average risk rating of six on all the risk models in spool, and you're offering a 14% yield, and there is a new incumbent or a new protocol coming out wanting to go up against incumbents, well, on the regular market, on a world without spool, they have to attract users and liquidity one by one on the open market. But in spool, if they can get ratings from all the risk model providers, they're now within spool. And now they're sort of competing in spool with other protocols at around the same risk score, right? And if a new protocol comes in offering, getting the same six risk score but offering 17% APY instead of 14%, well, there's an inefficiency.
00:37:40.122 - 00:37:40.334, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:40.372 - 00:37:50.274, Speaker B: And some of the capital coming in from new spools might be routed more heavily towards that 17% protocol until this inefficiency is kind of evened out.
00:37:50.312 - 00:37:50.994, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:51.192 - 00:38:23.334, Speaker B: And this is why I'm saying spool is not only a tool, so yield for the world, but it's also a liquidity engine or a liquidity router for DeFi. And that's why our tagline is yield for the world, fuel for DeFi, right? Because spool can fuel both old and new projects with more reliable liquidity. As soon as you know your risk score as a DAO controlling a DeFi protocol, you know sort of what yield will be expected to get liquidity from spool on aggregate. Because spool represents the user side.
00:38:23.392 - 00:38:23.710, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:23.780 - 00:39:10.382, Speaker B: But it also creates a market that is very fair and reliable to tap into for DEFA protocols to get liquidity from. And I think that's the true power. And I think this is something that we need to show in practice because I'm getting a little ahead of myself here, but this is something that we need to show in practice. And if this narrative plays out like I'm imagining it will, I think this is what will really get a lot of eyes on spool and encourage a lot of people to join us in the Dao and participate. I mean, I'm already getting really good reach outs, feedback from a lot of people that I've only known from Twitter beforehand. So it's sometimes a little starstruck, but getting all of these encouragements and people actually understanding that narrative and that concept, I think is really encouraging. And.
00:39:10.382 - 00:39:12.080, Speaker B: Yeah, now.
00:39:14.370 - 00:39:25.382, Speaker A: Phil, just some follow up to that then. So when is spool expected to go live like that? The UI that we talked through in February.
00:39:25.466 - 00:39:25.714, Speaker C: Right?
00:39:25.752 - 00:39:46.994, Speaker B: So all of this UI. Right? That's all from months ago, what I've walked you through. But in February, expected to go live. We want to do a staggered rollout. There's multiple audits running security. Obviously, if you're a project that focuses on risk management, security needs to be the number one topic. Like first look in the mirror, make sure you yourself are secure.
00:39:47.042 - 00:39:47.254, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:47.292 - 00:39:52.906, Speaker B: So I think that spool needs some time to become perceived as battle tested and secure tech.
00:39:53.008 - 00:39:53.322, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:53.376 - 00:41:01.166, Speaker B: Because we're kind of breaching novel ground here. So going live in February after multiple completed audits and addressing any potential findings from these audits, and then obviously big Buck bounty and then just a staggered rollout. We want to start with some genesis spools provided by the spooldao that are sort of early on incentivized for farming to represent that higher perceived risk of a new protocol. Get people, encourage people to jump into the cold water, try it out, right? And then we want to sort of roll out partner spools where we're working with several, let's say, known brands or capital aggregators, as we call them. So wallets, maybe exchanges, maybe communities to roll out their spools, where we're working with those community leaders or founders or dows to create their spools hand in hand with them, very close, stick close to them, and then we want to open up spool creation to everyone in the third step.
00:41:01.268 - 00:41:01.678, Speaker C: Right?
00:41:01.764 - 00:41:18.278, Speaker B: So a very controlled rollout. I'm not a fan of just dumping everything out there and saying, well, someone tried go break it because I think that would be rough. So yeah, expect a gradual rollout from February on and we'll see how it goes.
00:41:18.444 - 00:42:30.886, Speaker A: Yeah, we referenced earlier, if you go to Spool Phi, you can learn more about the spool token fair launch, which is happening through copper, and that's on Ethereum. That is a three day auction for 5% of the token supply. As always, I want to remind everyone that isn't financial advice, that you should buy the token. But if you do end up participating from a purely informational perspective, please be mindful to understand how the LBP works. It normally starts at a high price, and then if you watch it, just look up the pink line and it'll show you where the price will go. That being said, when buying pressure is applied, when anyone buys the token, obviously it moves off of that projected path. So anyways, if you want to read more about that, I'll try to attach there's a great spool LBP announcement article here that's linked to spool Phi, so you can learn more about that in February.
00:42:30.886 - 00:42:55.922, Speaker A: The protocol is expected to be live with that UI that we showed in the meantime too, you can learn more about spool or get involved in the community by going to spool Phi. If you click on the discord link at the very bottom of the screen, you can also follow spool Phi on Twitter. Gosh. Anything else, Phil, that we should cover? I think that's about it.
00:42:55.976 - 00:43:53.714, Speaker B: Maybe shout out to our docs. I think we wrote some of the most extensive docs in all of Defi, and I'm not afraid to say that we put a lot of work into the docs, and I think a lot of people have told me after going through it, they not only became experts on spool and a lot of intricacies that obviously we can't cover in a talk like this, but also learned something about Defi itself. So I really recommend you guys check that out and always come to the discord, give feedback. There's always someone from the DAO or from the builders team hanging out in voice as well. So just pop in, talk to us, ask questions, give feedback, and yeah, appreciate every single one that takes the time to learn more about spool and even more of those people that reach out and ask to become part of the team or join us in building, because I think that's what openness is all about. And as soon as governance is transferred, so these two months between now and the product launch, they're not going to be empty. This is where work groups are actually going to be formed.
00:43:53.714 - 00:44:11.494, Speaker B: So if you ever wanted to work in DeFi and work on building a protocol, that's your chance to actually become part of it. Whether it's full time or just a couple hours a week. We're going to hopefully set up work groups that have a fit for everyone that wants to get involved and actively get their hands dirty.
00:44:11.542 - 00:44:11.802, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:11.856 - 00:44:25.922, Speaker B: And that's always what I wanted when I started crypto early on in 2017. It was a way to get agency in the projects that I'm involved in that goes further than just holding the token and praying that the team does right by me.
00:44:25.976 - 00:44:26.290, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:26.360 - 00:44:45.080, Speaker B: And getting actual real agency in a product or protocol that you believe in, I think, can be super rewarding. So don't be afraid to pop in, don't be afraid to say hi, to reach out, and, yeah, I hope to see you guys there.
00:44:46.090 - 00:45:34.502, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely would encourage anyone get your hands dirty if you've never participated in a DaO. And Phil, just thanks so much for your time. Congrats on the copper launch kicking off today, and obviously excited to actually play with the live app once it's live there in February. And everyone, just one last reminder, if you enjoyed this, of course you can subscribe at Defi. Dad, if you're another talented team like Spool, please consider getting in touch with me and my team at Fourthrevolution Capital. We're proud to be working with spool and I believe that we are intent to create one of the risk models here in the future. So excited to work on that.
00:45:34.502 - 00:45:43.814, Speaker A: And yeah, thanks so much. I'm going to end the broadcast here. We'll be in a green room in just a minute. Everyone, have a wonderful week, and we'll see you soon.
00:45:43.932 - 00:45:45.730, Speaker B: Bye. See you guys. Bye.
