00:00:05.560 - 00:00:44.628, Speaker A: Here we go. Hey, everyone. It is Tuesday, October 26, 2021. This is DFI talks with DFI dad. Today I'm joined by a long standing community member of Nexus Mutual, Gotier. He has been a part of the mutual, I think, for several years now. And the reason we wanted to talk is he recently won a grant to basically coordinate an NFT drop for longtime community members and Nexus Mutual.
00:00:44.628 - 00:01:04.396, Speaker A: And I thought there were some really interesting lessons that he could share, just about how to reward those that are in web3 or DFI communities that are already stood up, but how to reward them with NFTs. So anyways, Gotier, welcome to the show. How's it going? Thanks for joining me.
00:01:04.498 - 00:01:07.408, Speaker B: Hey, doing great. Thank you. Thanks for inviting me.
00:01:07.574 - 00:01:34.584, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. Well, you did a killer job on this, and I want to let you kind of share a bit about your background before we just dive into this. But to keep everyone's attention, let me just quickly show you what we're looking at here. So here we go. We've got five different NFTs. I just want to make sure I zoom in on these.
00:01:34.584 - 00:02:14.768, Speaker A: These are five different NFTs that are being rewarded to different wallets based on whether they bought cover through Nexus or whether they staked NXM or whether they helped a vote on one of the submitted claims. So anyways, these are them, and we're going to kind of talk through how you went about having these created by an artist. And like I said, I'm hoping some other folks in other D five communities can learn a lesson here. So do you want to first share, I guess, a little bit about your background and your involvement in Nexus?
00:02:14.944 - 00:03:00.400, Speaker B: So I graduated in 2019. I was a former mergers and acquisition analyst. Then I left to do my own thing pretty early because I didn't like it. And I first heard about Defi, like in May, June 2020, just before defy summer. And I joined Nexus Mutual. I think it was like the early July 2020, so, like 15 months ago. And I became active answering questions and stuff in the discord, like about a year ago when I felt comfortable enough with my knowledge.
00:03:00.400 - 00:03:40.160, Speaker B: And yeah, here we are today. I've been a community mod for quite a long time. Then recently I'm in the investment committee of the capital pool. And yeah, I think it was like five months ago I had this idea of rewarding the community for their involvement in the mutual. So I made a quick draft of the ID posted on the forum and got some support. So I searched for an artist that would fit my ID and then applied for a grant.
00:03:41.140 - 00:05:21.600, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think what stood out to me a few months ago, and I think part of the reason I wanted to talk with you about this is I was actually doubting, I didn't express this doubt, I guess, to others, but I was thinking, like, what's the point of this? We're just going to have some NFTs created? And is this really like a proper reward for community members? But I think you went above and beyond and actually commissioned here some really beautiful art. But some of the ways that we normally think about keeping the attention of our community, whether it's a DeFi protocol or a purely NFT focused project or something like in the metaverse, there's always a token, at least in our world. And so there's a lot of focus, of course, on that token, whether it's accruing value, there's yield to be earned in many cases. And that's been a big part of our excitement being in the defi community. But I think more recently, we've all come to realize that one of the best ways to engage our community is through NFTs. And so anyways, I'd love for you to talk through the process of coming up with this NFT drop and what went into it, and then I can start to share my screen and maybe we can talk through some of the detail that went into actually designing these pieces.
00:05:21.600 - 00:05:34.950, Speaker A: And also just reminder to everyone, there's an incredible artist that created these Gotier project, managed this, so we'll be sure to link them as well and give credit to all the hard work they did.
00:05:35.880 - 00:06:19.152, Speaker B: Yeah, so the original idea was to actually, it was not to reward the community, it was to incentivize. So the drop now is like retroactive. So rewarding people for action in the past, and my original idea was to create something to incentivize actions. I had to switch it, but I think this still can be done. So maybe the next time it will be how things will be done. And so excuse is a platform where you can share risk between members. And there are a few actions member can make to participate.
00:06:19.152 - 00:07:00.160, Speaker B: You can shield mine to earn yield, you can buy coverage to protect your farming. You can stake to provide coverage for the community. And so really the idea was to everyone can participate in a different way. Not everyone do shield mining. Not everyone buys cover. And so the idea was really to reward everyone in a different way and to do kind of different badges for each action which members could proudly share. And yeah, that's how I came up with the idea of doing one NFT per action in the mutual.
00:07:01.460 - 00:07:17.990, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. Maybe actually, do you think. Hold on just a sec. I'm going to switch screens here, just so this is a little bit easier to see. Here we go. Let me share this screen instead.
00:07:17.990 - 00:07:36.110, Speaker A: Here we go. So one of them that stuck out here for me, I guess. Can you explain what went into each of these? Or some of maybe the Easter eggs to call out?
00:07:36.480 - 00:07:47.628, Speaker B: Yeah, that was my favorite one, too. So it represents the mascot of our communities. Like the Nexus mutant.
00:07:47.804 - 00:07:48.530, Speaker A: Yes.
00:07:49.380 - 00:08:07.360, Speaker B: So here is a nexus mutant in dark forest because Ethereum is often referred to as a dark forest. So I thought it would be fun to do this and protecting, like a unicorn that represents uniswap and a badger for Badger dao.
00:08:07.520 - 00:08:28.750, Speaker A: Yeah, just like fun imagery to play with here that everyone recognizes. Actually here, let's hop to another one because these are, as for anyone who's like aetherium community member, they're fun, I think, really creative. Here we go.
00:08:29.280 - 00:08:57.408, Speaker B: This one was the really first Nft in the collection. And so the idea is entirely on the artist. Eren. Shout out to know. That was the first moment of our collaboration. So I give him, he made a sketch and I said, okay, do whatever, I love it. And I said, okay, that would be the Nexus mutant.
00:08:57.408 - 00:09:06.490, Speaker B: So for every member who hold NXM. And, yeah, I started giving more precisions for the next ones.
00:09:07.020 - 00:09:26.928, Speaker A: Yeah, here's another one here. Again, I'm not sure if on the live stream, I'm not sure if folks are going to be able to see the level of detail in this, but you can go to this link below if you want to look at these. But this next one, what was this one rewarded for?
00:09:27.094 - 00:09:29.120, Speaker B: It's for claim assessment.
00:09:29.860 - 00:09:41.728, Speaker A: Claim assessment. And then if you notice there's an ape and there's a frog in here, which these are what kind of. In reference to memes around apes on crypto Twitter.
00:09:41.824 - 00:09:42.372, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:09:42.506 - 00:09:55.912, Speaker A: Yeah, really fun stuff. It's just. Let me hit play again here. How long did this actually take? Do you know how long it took the artist to make these?
00:09:55.966 - 00:10:21.660, Speaker B: Yeah, it took like, I think about three to four months. Yeah. Basically the entire summer. But it was the summer, so he went on holidays and stuff. But, yeah, it took three to four months. And then what is this for shield mining? Pretty straightforward. So he's crafting a shield.
00:10:21.660 - 00:10:26.160, Speaker B: And if you go to the next one, the next NFT.
00:10:31.000 - 00:10:31.876, Speaker A: Here we go.
00:10:31.978 - 00:10:47.928, Speaker B: So this one is for people that bought coverage. It represents an ape in his fields of corpse. And that about the coverage, that's been crafted. So you see him with.
00:10:48.014 - 00:11:07.650, Speaker A: I missed this. Yeah, you can see. So it's got like a farm. It's got in this case like the ether prism above it. And then this is an ape with obviously a cover on it. This is really cool. It's funny, I looked at these quite a bit beforehand and even I'm now discovering some of the detail.
00:11:07.650 - 00:11:46.590, Speaker A: Anyways, I think the point is for those communities that are long standing, already stood up, we're thinking of protocols that have been around for several years that are considered DFI or whatever, something that's web3 related, I guess. What lessons did you take from all of this? What can others do to create novel NFTs that are going to, I guess, resonate with the community? Anything that you would say is a repeatable process here that you went about?
00:11:49.680 - 00:12:15.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not sure if there is any repeatable process, but yeah, I just wanted to honor the community, give them something they will like. They will be proud to show the openc collection and stuff. I know if I'm with my non crypto friends, I can show them look my NFTs and I will be proud to show them this piece.
00:12:16.360 - 00:12:17.110, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:19.740 - 00:12:47.070, Speaker B: Just explaining what has meaning in these pieces. Also, I think it's pretty fun. And something I haven't talked about is also like the descriptions of the NFTs, which you can see on the Galaxy platform or on Opensea. I wanted to do something fun, and so most of the descriptions are tweets from you, Karp. So the CEO of Nexus Music.
00:12:47.620 - 00:13:07.750, Speaker A: Oh, that's funny. I did not realize that. So those are actually from. Yeah, again, all these little details. I mean, everyone is hopefully anyone watching this. If you're a part of a community, there's little inside jokes and memes. And I think this is a great way to sort of celebrate that.
00:13:07.750 - 00:13:26.650, Speaker A: I think at times we get lost chasing the next shiny object of a project. But I thought it was really creative here just to take a protocol that's already thriving and has a long standing community and reward them.
00:13:27.420 - 00:13:55.300, Speaker B: Yeah, and also back on the reputable process. Forgot to mention it, but Defi protocols can go on galaxy, so that's the platform on which we are launching. They made my life really easy to do things, so you just have to provide them with the artwork, with the whitelist and the descriptions and stuff. And every community can do this easily.
00:13:56.360 - 00:14:20.350, Speaker A: Very cool. And I'll put up the link here again so folks can check that out at Galaxy ecoeco, at Backslash nexusmutual. And so on there. I also want to just take a quick moment to show off the artist that was behind all of this. So let me just reshare their Twitter account.
00:14:20.960 - 00:14:24.990, Speaker B: I think you can show his foundation link.
00:14:26.420 - 00:14:28.080, Speaker A: Yes, let's do that.
00:14:28.230 - 00:14:31.120, Speaker B: That's where you can see it's the best NFT.
00:14:32.580 - 00:14:33.408, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:14:33.494 - 00:14:36.496, Speaker B: Actually, that's what made me contact him.
00:14:36.678 - 00:15:01.640, Speaker A: You know what, here, let me share this screen instead. This is his personal website. And then I'm going to just copy this into one of the links here so everybody can go to. Here we go. Bear with me. I'm copy pasting. All right, here we go.
00:15:01.640 - 00:15:07.870, Speaker A: You can go to this website to check out this artist. So where is Aaron based out of?
00:15:08.320 - 00:15:09.660, Speaker B: He's in turkey.
00:15:10.160 - 00:15:10.776, Speaker A: Turkey.
00:15:10.808 - 00:15:12.332, Speaker B: Very think.
00:15:12.466 - 00:15:26.112, Speaker A: Yeah, you can kind of see, I mean, just really cool work. And like I said, I was just really impressed by those five original pieces for Nexus. But I mean, check these out. These are just really cool to see.
00:15:26.166 - 00:15:27.440, Speaker B: It's really talented.
00:15:28.980 - 00:15:53.740, Speaker A: If anyone's looking to get in touch, that is the website there, so definitely pay it forward. We're grateful for all the different talented artists that are making the NFT community so special. So yeah, be sure to check him out. Gotier, anything else you'd call out here about Aaron or just the work you did here for Nexus?
00:15:55.200 - 00:16:26.580, Speaker B: No. I hope everyone that can claim one enjoys it. I tried to make it as easy to access as possible. So there is two tiers, one for people that participate a bit more, and the lower tier, which I hope everyone that's a member can claim. I think that's kind of important to bond the community together. I hope to see more initiatives like this in Defi.
00:16:27.000 - 00:16:51.532, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. Well, no, thanks so much for sharing your insights on this and doing just a quick live stream with me. And reminder to everyone you can follow Gotier here on his Twitter handle. And then obviously there's nexus mutual. And don't forget about the talented artist behind this, Aaron Eric at Aaron eric.com. Got you.
00:16:51.532 - 00:16:54.030, Speaker A: Anything else you wanted to share before we go?
00:16:54.400 - 00:16:56.044, Speaker B: No, that's it.
00:16:56.242 - 00:17:19.440, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, well, I'm going to end the live stream. We'll be in a green room here in just a second. Just everyone, thanks so much for tuning in.
