00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.454, Speaker A: Let me know when you post and I'll find it.
00:00:03.492 - 00:00:49.050, Speaker B: Absolutely. Hey, everyone, this is Defi talks with Defi dad. Hey. Thanks for joining us. It's Tuesday, May 24, 2022. We are joined here today by Kenton Prescott, who is the co founder of Sense Finance. Sense Finance itself is a decentralized fixed income protocol, so I'm excited to talk with him about a new product that they just released called the web3 yield curve.
00:00:49.050 - 00:01:18.198, Speaker B: It is very similar to Us treasury yields, the yield curves that are commonly discussed in traditional finance. And so I'm excited for us to kind of walk through a lesson that Kenton has kindly prepared for us on how those work and how these have been applied to the staked ETH yield curves. So, Kenton, thanks for joining me, man. Good to see you. Since permissionless, how are you doing?
00:01:18.364 - 00:01:22.120, Speaker A: Same here. I am doing awesome. And yourself?
00:01:23.370 - 00:02:07.990, Speaker B: I'm good, yeah. It was so nice to finally to get to hang out and see you and so many other friends and builders and just community members that we know. So we actually ran out of time. We were originally going to talk about this at permissionless, so now we get to talk a little more in depth about this. I'd like to start, though, with what is sense finance? And actually, let's take a step back even further and talk about your background, because you originally started at Maker. So, yeah, if you can share a little bit about your origin story in crypto, how did you get started? How did you end up at Maker? What prompted you to kickstart Sense finance?
00:02:08.410 - 00:02:44.238, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. So I have a background in aerospace engineering, was tinkering around with rocket engines, propulsion systems, et cetera. Thought I was going to work for SpaceX or the SpaceX of the world. During my last year of college, I stumbled upon bitcoin and blockchain, and I had this brain virus where I couldn't think about anything other than hipto for about six months. So it was very intense. I was almost obsessed. Learned about a few.
00:02:44.244 - 00:03:12.198, Speaker B: I never knew this about your background. That's funny. We've known each other a few years. And by the way, full disclosure, I was fortunate to be an investor in the seed round for sense finance. And obviously none of this is financial advice or recommendation or endorsement to make any sort of investments for informational purposes only. But obviously I've had the privilege to get to know you. And it's funny how many people have come from a science background.
00:03:12.198 - 00:03:53.526, Speaker B: Mine is in chemistry. I actually almost went to USC for rocket chemistry as a PhD student, but I ended up doing inorganic chemistry at UC San Diego and was there for a few years before I was struck by the startup bug and ended up in software. Anyways, I've interrupted you, but yeah, it's really funny how many friends and builders within the space have started within the sciences. So you're back in college, you learn about bitcoin and crypto in general and. Yeah, where do you go from?
00:03:53.708 - 00:04:09.900, Speaker A: Yeah, so I learned about bitcoin when I was doing an internship in the Bay area. I learned about Ethereum through a hackathon. And this is actually where I learned about DFI and the maker protocol. I went to the first.
00:04:10.430 - 00:04:12.090, Speaker B: What year is this, Kenton?
00:04:12.510 - 00:04:14.650, Speaker A: This is February 2018.
00:04:15.230 - 00:04:23.280, Speaker B: Okay. Heart of the bear market. The kickoff of the bear market. A bear market much more brutal than what we are going through right now.
00:04:24.130 - 00:04:59.906, Speaker A: A perfect time to build. So I had like, price was behind me. I was actually a student, so I didn't really have any cash whatsoever, so the only thing I could do was build. And yeah, I learned about Maker there. I got hired as an intern and was later converted into a part time and then full time integrations and Chennair for the Maker foundation. So at Maker, the integrations team, specifically, we engaged with our partners. We helped them build technical PoCs.
00:04:59.906 - 00:06:08.110, Speaker A: And then I also had a hand in developing some of the keeper bots as well. So with that experience, I gained an understanding around lending facilities, auctions, liquidations, et cetera. But what was interesting is that around 2020, TFI summer is when interest rates started to go berserk, right? And this got me thinking about different ways to hedge interest rate volatility, as well as parse these insane yields that were occurring back then, and it still occurs today at the edges. But back then, yields would be 100 plus percent, even 1000 per person at certain times. But if they would drop within the next week, then how valuable are they? And so just trying to answer that and create a solution that excites different user groups is what ultimately led to the creation of the stripping mechanism with incense.
00:06:08.470 - 00:07:05.990, Speaker B: You were thinking far ahead when there was all this froth, and this was still technically early in whatever bull cycle we were in at that point. It's funny because what you've eventually built, it's a little more sophisticated of a DeFi product versus, I think back then it was about people just finding the highest yield and earning that. But I do feel like recently the market drawdown has reaffirmed, returning to quality assets like ETH, thinking about how you can earn sustainable yield, yield that isn't fueled by high inflation, tokens that is fleeting. That lasts like a few weeks. Actually. A few weeks even would be generous. I would say a few days has been the benchmark in the past.
00:07:05.990 - 00:08:03.618, Speaker B: But anyways, yeah, back to what you're saying about sense. So you all very recently started launching your first few products here on main net. And so this is a really interesting new offering with the web3 yield curve, because as far as I know, there's really nothing that exists like it. And there is obviously so much focus and attention right now on the merge, which will convert or move us from proof of work to proof of stake as a consensus mechanism for Ethereum, which just also means that there will be that much more yield to earn as someone who has staked ETH. Anyways, by the way, do you want me to share your screen? Because I know you've got some really helpful slides here to kind of talk us through more of sense and what led to the web3 yield curve?
00:08:03.794 - 00:09:11.840, Speaker A: Yes, please. Yeah, the tail end of what I was saying earlier was that I created sense, or me and my co founder Josh, we created Sense, and we announced in August of 2021 the project and our raise, and then back in March is when we launched on Ethereum L1. But you may be wondering now, what is sense? And so, just to give a very fast overview of sense and the main mechanism that it offers, I've created a few slides here. So sense is on chain permissionless infrastructure for fixed income. We could dive into, like I could speak for hours on permissionless infrastructure in the space as well as fixed income. But I'll give a high level overview of what this enables now. So sense is a generalized fixed income protocol, which means that various teams can actually build fixed income apps on top.
00:09:11.840 - 00:10:16.862, Speaker A: The main app that the sense core team is focusing on at first is the yield stripping application. So at a high level, the way that it works, or I'll actually get into it in a second or two. But before we dive into the exact mechanism itself, let me quickly go through the use cases that are enabled by the yield stripping app. So the first one is you're able to lend at a fixed interest rate. The second one is that you are able to take directional bets on future yields. If you think that the ST ETH yield is going to be higher post merge than what the market is implying, then you're able to profit off of that movement once that reality takes hold. And then finally you're able to earn a variable APY by providing liquidity to our space pool, which is like an AMM built for these types of assets that sense creates.
00:10:16.862 - 00:11:04.138, Speaker A: So you may be wondering now exactly what I'm referring to when I say fixed yields assets, this and that. Let's dive into it now. So what sense does is it essentially takes a yield bearing asset and a yield bearing asset, super simple, is basically an asset that you earn yield on some principal amount. So today you just deposit some investment. Let's take ST ETH as the example for the yield bearing asset. You'll have ETH as the principal asset and you deposit it into st ETH. You're earning yield and this yield is actually unknown, but the principal amount that you will unlock in the future is known.
00:11:04.138 - 00:11:57.390, Speaker A: So again, you have the underlying that you put in, you have yield that accrues on it, and then you have the underlying that you take out at the end. What sense does, what the yield structurehipping application does is it allows a user to decompose a yield burning asset into their principal and yield components. So you have two new assets. You have a principal token and you have a yield token. And the principal token redeems for the principal amount of value that's been locked at maturity. And then the yield token streams any yield that has been accruing on that principal amount up until the end of that term. So you may be wondering, what does maturity have to do with it? Well, fixed income is all about having cash flows occur at certain dates.
00:11:57.390 - 00:13:05.922, Speaker A: And so that is how it's used with incense. You have the principal that's returned at maturity, and then all the way up until that point, you have the yield that is streamed to YT holders, yt being yield tokens. And so here's some math that we don't have to get into. But again, principal tokens you redeem at maturity and yield tokens that collect the yield on top. So what's cool actually, is that the principal tokens actually trade at a discount relative to their redemption value. So if you have st e, you have a PT on St e, it matures in twelve months, and the PT will actually trade at a discount to the redemption value in twelve months. So it could trade, let's just say, for example, it could trade for 90 or zero point 90 e, right? So that's kind of like a 10% discount on its redemption value at maturity.
00:13:05.922 - 00:14:07.690, Speaker A: And so that discount is the fixed rate that you get if you buy pets at first and then hold them until maturity. Yts, on the other hand, their price is going to be determined by the future expectation of yield, which is unknown, right? And so the yield that is expected on Wahaites is more or less equivalent to the yield implied by the discount on pets. So it's called the implied rate. If the implied rate on yield tokens is 10%, then you will only buy high Ts. If you think that the yield that is accruing to these high, it will be higher than 10%. So just to summarize, this gives us the use cases that we have here. So again, you can get a fixed rate by buying and holding PTs until maturity.
00:14:07.690 - 00:15:13.940, Speaker A: You can trade future yields, take directional bets, go long or short future rates on PTs and highties, or with the use of, and then finally, as an LP of this trading activity, you're actually able to earn a variable yield from this on chain fixed income market by depositing your assets onto Sensebase. So that is actually like an overview of the stripping application. And last week we actually announced a long dated WST adapter, which basically means that we have taken this yield stripping application and we've applied it to the ST e yield bearing asset. And what has come out of that is the web3 yield curve. So I'm going to stop here, actually, and before I jump into the yield curve, I'm going to stop and see if you have any questions on these different use cases made available to users of sense.
00:15:14.870 - 00:15:54.910, Speaker B: No, I think you very eloquently framed it up here. I know of all of these, I want to say probably the most popular use case, I will expect to be the one on the far left just earning a fixed rate using sense based on the ETH staking yield. So end of day, it allows me to just basically deposit ETH and then earn a fixed rate, actually, is that what the deposit options I'm assuming will just be ETH here, or is there any other tokens?
00:15:56.210 - 00:16:01.920, Speaker A: It's currently ETH, but we have plans to expand to other assets very soon.
00:16:02.710 - 00:17:14.374, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think all eyes are on. Well, actually, for the last few years, all eyes have been on earning with staked ETH, despite all the other things drawing our attention elsewhere, and especially now that you can borrow against that. And so I'd have to double check. But there's a remarkable amount of ETH now that is staked, whether someone's running a validator themselves or whether it's through something like rocket pool or something like Steth by Lido. And so, yeah, I would imagine many will want to earn a fixed yield, since normally it's normally a variable rate that can go up and down. And yeah, I think it's about being able to just earn with something you already hold. So for me, since I hold ETH and I'm long ETH, anytime I can potentially earn a little more yield, or in this case have a predictable yield that is fixed, that's going to be really interesting to me.
00:17:14.374 - 00:17:25.370, Speaker B: And that again, of course, is not a recommendation or endorsement of any sort of investment strategy, but I can at least share the way that I think about it within my own portfolio.
00:17:26.510 - 00:18:42.706, Speaker A: Yeah, and what's cool is that you're not only earning a fixed yield, but that fixed yield can be higher than the current variable yield of St ETH. So it's actually beyond valuable to St ETH holders now because they're able to earn more yield in a predictable. Yeah, and completely agree that earning the fixed yield like this use case is probably going to be the most desired here, but happy to actually jump onto this next slide. So this next slide here, there are two graphs. The top graph is showing the yield curve, both the current and one year ago yield curve of US treasury bonds. So as we can see, there are different maturities on the x axis and then there are the various yields on the y axis. And what this is essentially showing is a relationship of interest rate across time, or interest rate requirements across time.
00:18:42.706 - 00:19:43.954, Speaker A: And if you don't already know it now, and I'm speaking to your audience when I say it here, TFI dad. But interest rates affects every part of the financial ecosystem. It affects the cost of capital, it affects the risk free rate, and it's incredibly influential within the space. And in TFI there is not a long dated yield curve yet. And so we are excited to introduce that to DFI ecosystem with the introduction of the web3 yield curve, which is a long tatted term structure on St E. So below the lower graph is the yield curve. It's not as curve, it's more like jagged in some areas.
00:19:43.954 - 00:20:41.050, Speaker A: And this is just hamply because we have a limited number of maturities here. But as he we have a one month maturity, we have a six month maturity, health month, and then finally five years. And we'll get to this on the sense portal in a moment or two. But every point is the maturity that you're able to earn a fixed rate at, or earn a fixed rate as well as speculate on yields. So if you think, for example, that the one month yield or St ETH yield is going to be higher than what it is now, it's almost zero actually. Then you should go out onto cents and you should go long rates. Again, not financial advice, but for those who want to take on that bet, they have the ability to do so and profit in the event that St e yields more than what is being expected here.
00:20:41.050 - 00:22:07.142, Speaker A: If you are a long term holder of ETH, then you can earn a seven plus fixed rate over the next year. So that is much higher than the current 4% st e yield that is currently accruing. And I actually expect that these yields are so high because they are post ETH or post merge. So as you alluded to earlier, once the merge occurs, there will be a lot of MEV fees and bribes and yield that will be bunched up with the POS yield, and that will lead to a higher interest rate that's earned by St ETH holders after the merge occurs. And so what the market is currently telling us now is that the merge is going to occur potentially within six months, and when that merge occurs, it's going to give a yield that's higher than what the current St ETH yield is. So this should give you an overview of the power of sense, but more importantly, of Ethereum. We are diehard like Ethereum maximalists here, or I guess that was too strong actually.
00:22:07.142 - 00:22:29.530, Speaker A: But we are like long term believers in Ethereum, and so being able to contribute to the web3 yield yield curve is a great opportunity to build on top of what currently exists. But any questions? I think I gave a lot of info. Happy to actually give a quick demo of the sense portal if you think.
00:22:29.600 - 00:23:03.640, Speaker B: That'S what I wanted to see. Kenton yeah, I'd love to. This has been a really helpful explanation, I think, just looking at the let me see which tab it is. It's under fixed rates. Being able to look at those different yields and seeing them between the six months, one year, five years and so on. If you can kind of walk us through that and explain maybe why you think the numbers are where they're at. I know we're kind of early too.
00:23:03.640 - 00:23:15.980, Speaker B: These are pretty new products, so there's less liquidity and more time ahead of us to see what people will do with this product.
00:23:16.510 - 00:23:45.486, Speaker A: Yes, happy to. So we're currently on the sense portal now, and at the far left we have the portfolio page. Here we have yields. So this is where you're able to go long or short, few future yields. Then we have fixed rates. You buy PTs at a discount and hold it until maturity. Then if you want to earn a variable yield, you're able to do it through the pool page.
00:23:45.486 - 00:24:36.260, Speaker A: But just to hug on or go on and expand a bit on the fixed rate page here. What we're currently seeing are different fixed rate opportunities. We have a fixed rate opportunity for five years. We have one for a year, six months, and so on. As TFI dad was saying a second ago, these rates are not only a function of what the market expects future yields to be at these times, but also they also are taking into account the expected risk that exists with incense. To be clear, these are fixed rates, right. If you buy these in holdings until maturity, you will get a fixed rate.
00:24:36.260 - 00:24:52.140, Speaker A: But there is smart contract risk that still exists with incense. It's brand new, has been live for only a few months now. And so we expect that to also play into these longer dated maturities as well.
00:24:53.230 - 00:25:48.220, Speaker B: Yeah, really interesting. Just the fact, obviously, you can lock in 8% for five years, which there is obviously lots of debates going on in terms of where will the ETH yield rate end up once the merge happens. There's a lot of speculation that it will go up quite a bit, but then it will also come down then after, I think, some larger crypto institutional investors see it working and begin to deploy more capital into it. That 8%. It's funny because it's appealing even today, like, you're earning 8% fixed. And I think currently, if you were to deposit into Steth by Lido, I'll have to double check here. What is it? As of today.
00:25:51.010 - 00:25:53.086, Speaker A: We have a page for that.
00:25:53.268 - 00:25:59.840, Speaker B: Oh, excellent. There we go. So it's only 4% today, right? Yeah, it's much higher.
00:26:03.170 - 00:26:50.110, Speaker A: What's cool is that when you get a fixed rate and you hold it until maturity, you're earning that fixed rate every year. So have, if you enter into that five year maturity, then if you hold it for the next years, then using, like, purchasing one ETH worth of PTs will give you a profit of 44%. So again, this is a hefty one, but I just wanted to emphasize that this rate is an annualized rate and that it will compound on itself every year until maturity.
00:26:50.770 - 00:27:22.890, Speaker B: Kenton, can you dumb down a sec? If someone's looking at the five year yield, where is that coming from as of today? Because as of today, we're looking at, let's say, 4% through staff by Lido. Where does that added yield come from? Or basically, is there someone who's obviously losing a part of their yield in order to compensate for what's being earned?
00:27:24.510 - 00:28:21.886, Speaker A: So what's happening under the hood is that YT yield token holders are indirectly paying the fixed yield to PT holders for a right to earn the yield on their principal for the entire term. So this rate is again implied by the price of pets, and the price of pets are driven by the price of YTs. And the reason why that YT holders are purchasing pets at this price is that they expect the yield to exceed the 8% fixed yield over the next five years. And so that's just simply a market dynamic that PT holders are able to profit off of in a way that is like net sustainable for everyone here?
00:28:21.988 - 00:29:13.994, Speaker B: Actually. Yeah, no thanks. And then what would you say is let's call out all of the risks here? So how could this potentially not go as planned? Or you called out some of the more obvious DeFi risks. We have the risk of a smart contract bug, but I would expect sense will eventually have cover through Nexus mutual, so someone could seek out protection for that. We've become very familiar with DPEG risk. Steph itself has actually dpegged a bit, but there's actually an argument that it was to be expected and healthy given that we're so close to the merge. This is not the same DPEG sort of risk that was experienced through UST.
00:29:13.994 - 00:29:30.820, Speaker B: But anyways, there is a risk of a DpEG with any sort of pegged asset. What else is there that we should consider? What else should a user consider when looking at how these products work with sense?
00:29:31.830 - 00:30:43.370, Speaker A: Yeah, so the sense amm, which is where users are able to buy PTs from, the senseam, has the yield bearing asset as the quote asset. Right? And so one actually does not need to go through an ETH to st ETH conversion and potentially be exposed to the peg on sense, because sense is only dealing with the yield bearing asset. Other than that, though, there is smart contract risk to sense. There's smart contract risk to the yield bearing assets that it interfaces with. And then there's of course smart contract risk to balancer, which is where sense has built the space. Amm, other than smart contract risk, there really is not any other risk beyond that simply because census is a debtless protocol, it's not issuing debt at all. And so there's no solvency risk that exists.
00:30:44.030 - 00:31:00.640, Speaker B: Excellent. Yeah. Good to call these things out. I think we normally don't shy away from talking about risk, but feel like lately the market has made very clear it's important for more users to think about what could go wrong.
00:31:01.250 - 00:31:37.130, Speaker A: Right. I would say though, that one thing I forgot to mention as well is everything I just said was in the context of PT holders, in the context of YT holders, they could make an incorrect bet. Right? And if they make an incorrect bet, then their position is going to be subject to the profits, or lack thereof, that are earned on that position. And so they are therefore exposed to interest rate risk that is accruing through the yield bearing asset.
00:31:37.790 - 00:32:11.990, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. Again, not advising any sort of strategy here, but I think it's fair to say that buying those principal tokens is what I want to say, a less risky bet. We're talking about basically earning a fixed income or a fixed rate based on what you would normally earn as a variable rate holding staked ether.
00:32:12.330 - 00:33:05.320, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. If your users are interested in earning a variable rate that perhaps exceeds what the current ST ETH yield is, you're able to earn a composite APY from the space AMm. And so these are variable yields that you're earning right now in ETH terms. And I present this because this is a fairly competitive, uninsivized yield that is sustainable at its core and sustainable as in, like, it's not being driven by market prices of other assets, but instead it's heaven by the interest rate markets instead.
00:33:06.090 - 00:33:35.134, Speaker B: Got you. So just to clarify, the APY that's quoted there, is that based off just the trading fees for an LP, or is that also incorporating. Oh, there we go. Using the weighted average of the target APY, principal implied rate and space swap fees. Awesome. Okay, so that is like total netted out yield. So let's say that's around 6.9%
00:33:35.134 - 00:34:06.602, Speaker B: and also a part of this, that apy could go up or down if there's more or less trading volume with those two tokens. Cool. Okay. Yeah, I think that clarifies it. And then can you go back to just the fixed rates or. Yeah, there we go. So here I could be, I'm thinking of different scenarios that the average user might look at this for.
00:34:06.602 - 00:34:50.600, Speaker B: So I might go in and say, hey, that 9.46 1% looks nice. Six months out from now. So I'm going to deposit some ether and start earning that. But then let's pretend that three or four months from now, I'm like, oh, shoot, I need that ether back. I need that staked ETH back. Because of the liquidity pairs in the spaces amm, which is the name of the product for the amm, that sense created, I can go in there and I can basically trade my position there and get back to.
00:34:52.190 - 00:35:35.590, Speaker A: Yep. So once you have fixed rate position, you're holding pets, and you can find those pets in the portfolio tab. I'm using a test account here. So I have a bunch of small positions that I've used elsewhere, but if you actually go to the principal token tab, you have the ability to manage this position before maturity by selling it on space. So you have the ability to actually sell on space. We have a UI upgrade that has been pushed very soon, but you'll have the ability to sell before maturity.
00:35:36.090 - 00:36:04.446, Speaker B: Nice. Okay, so this is great. You're basically dummy proofing all the options you have once you open up a position. So this looks very familiar when I think about I've played around with AP wine element and obviously there's some overlap here in terms of some of the value that's offered by sense. So this looks very familiar to. Cool.
00:36:04.548 - 00:36:05.262, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool.
00:36:05.316 - 00:36:44.000, Speaker B: Well, Kent, is there anything else you think we should cover? I really appreciate this is not the easiest in terms of topics to talk through, but I feel like it's very timely. Again with the merge coming with all eyes on the ETH staking yield. Like, here's one other way that someone who's already long ether like myself, who has staked ETH, there's more yield here I can earn from the swapping fees or simply by betting on what I think in this case, locking in the fixed APY through some sort of maturity date.
00:36:45.090 - 00:37:18.070, Speaker A: Yeah, those are really the only thing that I want to say to your audience is that since it's currently Leahy live now, we have an active bug bounty program. So if you're a smart contract developer and you find a bug, disco hose it and we'll give you a reward. Sense has already gone through a maturity date and we've confirmed that all of the functionalities are operating as intended.
00:37:20.190 - 00:37:20.506, Speaker B: And.
00:37:20.528 - 00:37:58.600, Speaker A: We'Re nearing the end of our guarded launch phase. So once that is complete, we will be turning on the permissionless mode of sense, which will allow anyone to create fixed rates on any yield bearing asset that is the promised land of permissionless infra. You have the ability to just onboard stuff whenever and have the full power of TFI at your fingertips. So really excited to see the guarded launch conclude. And once we announce it, you should expect to see fixed rates on every yield bearing asset out there.
00:37:58.970 - 00:38:28.734, Speaker B: That's really cool. Yeah, I kind of missed. That's a huge part of the story here is that it's permissionless, that it's not like gated to what the sense team or the future sensed out, wants to put up. Let's see. I think we covered, gosh, there's one other point there that I wanted to make in terms of the product there, but I guess we covered it all.
00:38:28.932 - 00:39:21.806, Speaker A: There was one other thing too. If there are traders in the audience here, then sense exposes a way to take directional bets on future post ETH merge yields. So as earlier, we have a November 30 maturity and longer ones thereafter. So this allows you to actually express your view on what post merge e fields would be and trade against what the current expects. We have the sense fuse pool as well, which is currently paused, but once that is re enabled, you'll be able to get leverage against your assets and amplify your positions return as well. So keep an eye on that's what it was.
00:39:21.828 - 00:40:16.690, Speaker B: Kent many of us are excited to be able to borrow eventually against a fixed income position. I think this is part of what has made the whole fixed income defi sector less sexy than everything else that's been built over the last few years. I mean, at the end of the day, despite the issues that leverage creates, obviously it allows us to be able to access that liquidity to be able to borrow against these positions, which I would say in terms of defi fixed income. Again, these are much more conservative yields. So you mentioned one product that's coming through sense. Will you also have support through Fiat Dao? Will we be able to borrow eventually against positions on Fiat Dao, or is that still in development?
00:40:17.670 - 00:40:37.846, Speaker A: Yes, the plans are there. Once we have a fiat denominated principal token on sense, those assets could then be digested by fiat Dow and one can earn leverage and liquidity through that platform as well.
00:40:37.948 - 00:41:13.714, Speaker B: So yes, awesome. Yeah, makes sense. I know. Baby steps, too good to take time to really make sure that the specs are right on that and that it's been battle tested and audited and everything. Kenton total privilege to get to talk to you about all of it. It's another one of those days where I'm like, it's just a privilege that I get to selfishly ask all these questions and learn about these topics with you and other brilliant DeFi builders and founders and investors. So thanks so much.
00:41:13.714 - 00:42:05.534, Speaker B: This is the best conversation I've had in a while. Just such a cool. It's such an interesting new product that obviously has parallels to the traditional finance world. I'm hoping this is another example for folks who are new to defi to see like, hey, there's a lot that we can do here to mimic products that you know and love from tradfi, but also to build for native use cases of DeFi, in this case building for the yield curve of ETH, which is really just really interesting. I want to remind everyone too, they can learn more at sense finance. They should follow you and sense protocol on Twitter. And also, if you enjoyed this, of course, subscribe@defydad.com.
00:42:05.534 - 00:42:16.040, Speaker B: And hopefully we'll be able to trick more brilliant Defi nerds to come on and talk with me about this. Kent, anything else you want to share before we go?
00:42:17.370 - 00:42:29.560, Speaker A: No. I hope that everyone has an awesome day and come find me on our discord for important announcements and the upcoming prohotics released at Sense.
00:42:30.210 - 00:42:31.454, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah.
00:42:31.492 - 00:42:31.742, Speaker A: Cool.
00:42:31.796 - 00:42:36.620, Speaker B: I'm going to end the broadcast here, so we'll be in a green room in a second. Thanks, everyone, for joining. We'll see you soon.
