00:00:00.330 - 00:00:30.406, Speaker A: This is the DFI download at permissionless 2022, brought to you by Bancorp. I'm joined by researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, Justin Drake. Justin, good to finally meet in person. How you doing? Good, good. Yeah. So we're approaching the triple happening. Can you kind of break that down for us? What exactly does that mean for Ethereum? Why are we calling it the triple have name?
00:00:30.588 - 00:01:09.118, Speaker B: Right, so you're probably familiar with the havenings in bitcoin. Every four years the issuance halves. And what we're going to have at the merge when we remove proof of work is we're also going to remove the proof of work issuance. Now. Right now, the proof of work issuance is on the order of 13,500 east. And we're going to replace that with the proof of stake issuance, which is 1500 east. And so, roughly speaking, the net issuance is going to go down by a factor of eight, which corresponds to three happenings.
00:01:09.118 - 00:01:54.914, Speaker B: Two times two times two eight, hence the name triple halving. And one of the kind of interesting consequences is that the supply of ETH is going to peak at the merge and then start going down. And the reason is that to counterbalance some of the issuance, we also have a burn mechanism in Ethereum, as you're familiar with EIP 1559. And so it turns out that the daily burn is on the order of 5000 heaps, which is several times larger than the proof of stake issuance. And so on net, the supply is going to go down and over decades it's going to find a new equilibrium. Maybe around 60 million eats something like that.
00:01:55.032 - 00:02:42.734, Speaker A: So you coined the phrase ultrasound money, which we probably should talk about that a moment. But when you go to the website ultrasound money, there's like a little switch you can flip to simulate the merge. And so that's what we're doing, right? You're sort of just letting us know that given the amount of ether being burned, this is what the inflation or deflation rate in some days would actually be. Yeah, it's been fascinating to me like how EIP 1559 has become really well understood, like I always thought of as being fairly complex, and now it's become a bit of a meme almost. So I guess, can you help define what is ultrasound money? Why did you start calling ETH ultrasound money? What exactly does it mean?
00:02:42.932 - 00:03:20.886, Speaker B: Right, so we have sound money, right, which initially started with gold. And the idea of sound money is that it can't be debased easily. At least it takes a lot of effort to dig up the gold. And the reason why sound money is called sound money is because it's a reference to gold. Because when you take two gold coins and you kind of tap them together, it makes this ding, which is characteristic of gold. And bitcoin took the concept, the meme, and basically copy pasted it with digital gold. So that's why we have the cap supply.
00:03:20.886 - 00:03:53.094, Speaker B: Just like there's a finite amount of gold on the earth, there's a finite amount of bitcoin on earth. But in a way, Ethereum is doing something that's never been done before. It's not copy pasting an existing meme, it's kind of innovating at the meme layer, as it were, with this new shape of the supply. And basically what started as a joke has now become a meme. The joke being if cap supply is sound money, then decreasing supply must be ultrasound money.
00:03:53.212 - 00:04:01.522, Speaker A: I've actually never gotten the origin of that myself. These aren't like planted questions. That's me candidly wondering what exactly that means.
00:04:01.596 - 00:04:08.490, Speaker B: And now a bunch of people on Twitter are wearing the so called bat signal, the ultrasound bat signal, because bats produce ultrasound.
00:04:08.830 - 00:04:33.266, Speaker A: I love it. I love it. I've been actually showing that off for quite some time. One last question for you. So obviously you've been very important to this build up, which will be the merge. You all have been doing research for years and all of the sort of thankless work that gets us to Ethereum 2.0. With Ethereum 2.0,
00:04:33.266 - 00:04:51.180, Speaker A: when will we know that the merge is going to happen? What ultimately confirms that it will, maybe even just at a high level, how is that ultimately decided? It will happen. There's no reason for us to continue testing. It's time for us to actually do the thing.
00:04:51.710 - 00:06:14.530, Speaker B: Right. So it will definitely happen in the sense that there's overwhelming social consensus that we want this, and it was planted as part of the vision even before Ethereum launched seven years ago, before the Genesis block. Now, to answer your question as to when will it be kind of locked in? It will be basically once we have very high confidence in the quality of the client, the quality of the software, and we're at a point fairly late in the testing stage where we're going to be upgrading the big testnets like Gurley and Robston and Sepolia. And actually on June the eigth, we have the first big testnet being upgraded, Robston. Now, I'm relatively confident it will go smoothly, and then maybe a few weeks later we'll have the next testnet and then a few weeks later, the one after that, and then we'll probably be in a position to say, hey, in a few weeks time we want to merge. And the way that we do this is that we agree on what's called Total TTD, terminal total difficulty, which is basically a threshold after which we have the very first new proof of stake lock and the very last proof of work lock.
00:06:15.190 - 00:06:54.590, Speaker A: Absolutely. It's just fascinating to me that it's all finally coming together. And I will say maybe I'm like the OD one, but I thought it wasn't coming for years. So it was such like, to me, it was such a pleasant surprise to find out that the merge would happen this year in 2022. Because also, too, I think it goes back to back in 20 18 20 19 20 20. I got to at least learn from many of you working at the Ethereum foundation and on other teams that were doing research and just a very thankless sort of work that you do. So just congrats.
00:06:54.590 - 00:07:08.050, Speaker A: I know it's been like a very long journey to this and really to once the merge happens, I mean, that's just the start of something new. It's not like the end of the road for research and all the development innovations that are going on.
00:07:08.200 - 00:07:31.374, Speaker B: Yeah, in a way it's the very beginning because it's kind of the first version of proof of stake that we're putting out and we know that it's not perfect. There's various attack vectors, there's various things that could be exploited, and we have a whole roadmap of incremental security upgrades which will probably take half a decade, a decade, maybe more to fully pan out.
00:07:31.492 - 00:07:37.710, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm excited and like I said, such a pleasure and a privilege to get to catch up with you. So thanks for your time.
00:07:37.780 - 00:07:38.780, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
