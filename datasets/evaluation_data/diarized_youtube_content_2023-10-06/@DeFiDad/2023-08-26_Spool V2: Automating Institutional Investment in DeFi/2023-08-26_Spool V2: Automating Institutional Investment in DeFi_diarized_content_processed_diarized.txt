00:00:00.170 - 00:00:44.730, Speaker A: A money printer has to go sooner or later. That's just how also shift economic system works at the moment. What we believe where the next wave liquidity will come from will be institutions that are interested, that have seen the value. They want to see what can be done better through crypto. And we're working mainly on, for example, one proof of concept right now, and I can say it with whom we're working, but not too much else. We're working with Deutsche bank and Deutsche Asset Management, one of big asset managers in Europe and in the world. I think they're at about 800 billion assets under management right now, and they're really working on the concept of a proper on chain fund with both DFI and crypto native assets, but also with real world assets that have been tokenized.
00:00:47.390 - 00:01:41.382, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad from Fourth Revolution Capital and I'm here with my friend and co host from four RC Nomadic. In this episode, we'll cover Spool, launched on Ethereum Main Net in spring 2022 and later on arbitram L two. Spool is a middleware for building automated vaults, aka spools, with programmable risk models on existing yield generators such as ave curve, convex compound urine, and more. Today we're here to talk as they gear up for a massive overhaul with Spool V two and what that means for both retail users as well as traditional banks and crypto institutional investors who might plug into their yield products with spool.

00:03:11.290 - 00:03:50.310, Speaker D: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs. And today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account. If we zoom out, since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial royals.
00:03:53.770 - 00:04:35.330, Speaker E: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC. And native access to instadap's powerful custom DFI strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:35.990 - 00:04:51.834, Speaker B: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce Simon Shabber. He is the chief commercial officer at Spooldow. Simon has been in crypto since 2015, having built a number of crypto startups. He has an MBA in behavioral psychology, so let's kick it off. Simon, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:51.952 - 00:04:53.834, Speaker A: Really happy to be here. I'm doing great.
00:04:53.952 - 00:05:17.726, Speaker B: Yeah. We appreciate you taking the time to talk with us, and we're really interested to kind of outline the value that spool brought forth with B one to DFI, and then, of course, what we can look forward to here with V two. So why don't we just give a bit more background on you and just how you got into crypto? What ultimately led to you joining the.
00:05:17.748 - 00:05:55.342, Speaker A: Spool Dow yeah, I mean, that's a big question, right? But I'm going to try to keep it as short as possible for me. Really. I got into crypto properly with Ethereum, because before that, back when I was in university, when I was in school, I was quite the open libertarian and austrian economics fan. So I was in all the online hard money forums. I was a Goldberg back then, and then this thing called bitcoin came around. But there were a couple of, for me, similar attempts of really disrupting the way money works before that. Like, we had libertariser and so on, but they were always cracked down on really, really hard.
00:05:55.342 - 00:06:29.782, Speaker A: So I was almost too jaded to believe in bitcoin, which probably cost me a lot of money back then and until now. But with Ethereum, it was something new for me. And that really, for first time, got me to commit the time to really, really get into crypto, understand how things work, read the white paper, but then also read the bitcoin white paper, which I always put off before that. And for me, that was just incredible that you could build unstoppable applications anywhere in the world, just put them onto this world computer. Nobody could stop them. You pay as you use, and that thing just works. Right? Miss 100% uptime.
00:06:29.782 - 00:06:59.134, Speaker A: So that really got me into crypto. That's been a crazy, crazy eight or nine years until now. So you say your age, ten years for every year you spend in crypto. But I think I'm doing all right so far. Still surviving. Yeah, I joined Spudao basically at the end of the Defi summer, let's say, really came around and joined as the first employee for the DAO. For me, Spool was a great toolbox, because I have a background in traditional finance.
00:06:59.134 - 00:07:45.780, Speaker A: I've been working with more innovative banks and fintechs before I, in my first early years in crypto, already did a lot of use cases and so on. And for me, the idea of DeFi was really, really good, because I know how broken core banking systems are, how broken most of the economics are also behind the banking system that we have nowadays, and how most sea level people in those banks also know exactly that it should be replaced, but it's basically impossible. So the idea of just building banking infrastructure completely on the side, completely new, without any technological debt, that was amazing for me. And, yeah, spool offered one of those solutions to build something like that. That's very core to, I believe, how banking systems, how trading venues and so on will work in the future.
00:07:46.390 - 00:08:07.974, Speaker B: A lot of folks just do not understand what parts of legacy finance are broken, and really what a terrible sort of benchmark legacy finance serves for us as DeFi. And this is kind of continually the challenge with DeFi being upheld to, I think, a standard that not even traditional finance lives up to.
00:08:08.092 - 00:08:48.222, Speaker A: Yeah. The thing is, it feels like we've just spent many, many decades of covering up the parts that don't work in traditional finance. And since nothing is transparent, it works really well. Right? So you don't notice most things until, let's say, you're running a traditional merchant business or something. You can't pay your suppliers because your online banking is just down for three, four days. And that's really, really bad if you have a lot of goods coming in, goods going out, and yeah, your bank generally tells you, hey, just wait, we're fixing it. But if something like this happens to, let's say, arbitrum recently when there was the issue of some transactions not going through, that's huge, right? And the standards we're holding DeFi to our perfection.
00:08:48.222 - 00:09:14.970, Speaker A: And you can audit them any day of the week, any second you want. You can always get a full audit of things. So there are people that do that and there's proper analysis tools. You have none of that for traditional finance. And one bank doesn't trust the other bank. That's kind of how credit crisis begin. Like in 2008, when every institute had the fear of every other institute they interact with being illiquid and being bankrupt.
00:09:14.970 - 00:09:22.206, Speaker A: We had a similar thing just recently. Right, almost full blown banking cris, that might still happen. Let's see.
00:09:22.308 - 00:09:33.858, Speaker F: Simon, I think that the backdrop that you just laid out is like the perfect context to lead us into what is spool, in your own words, maybe break down what spool is at a high level first.
00:09:34.024 - 00:10:16.354, Speaker A: Yeah, on the highest level, spool is really infrastructure for portfolio management. Then of course, it's all on chain. Right now we're on ether one and arbitron, but we're going on more networks as we grow. But digging a bit deeper, it's a tool set that allows people to create smart walls. So most people are familiar with how walls work, right? So you can manage your allocations in multiple strategies, across multiple protocols within one vault. But then why do we call it smart? Because we allow users when they create vaults and they pick these strategies to also employ a risk model. Risk models really tell you how risky each individual strategy, each individual protocol is that you have exposure to.
00:10:16.354 - 00:11:22.834, Speaker A: And it continuously, every single day, rebalances your allocations so it fully automates risk management, allocations management and really the entire portfolio management process. Now, we talked about different standards for Tradfi and for Defi. And one of the things in tradfi is you've got breaks to trading, right? Like stuff just doesn't work on weekends, on bank holidays, overnights, then defile is not the case. If you want to properly manage a portfolio, especially with money from other people, you need to be on that 24/7 right? No holidays, nothing. It's just always on. And the value gain from really having efficient portfolio management software in tradfi is nothing compared to having really good risk management and portfolio management software in Defi, where otherwise you need a team of like four to six professionals. That's first of all finding those in crypto, right? It's incredibly hard, incredibly expensive, and then employing them around the clock and mistakes can still happen, right? People, I believe, need proper software support to perform to the best of their ability.
00:11:22.962 - 00:11:40.698, Speaker B: Simon, just a bit more history on spool. Can you lay out for us, when did spool V one actually launch? And then maybe dumb down some of the current product offerings? What would we expect as DFI users if we were to hop onto the application and start to use it?
00:11:40.784 - 00:12:38.714, Speaker A: Definitely now, spool version one was built really for the needs of the DFI user during the bull market and during the DFI summer and everything that's followed after. So it was made to be this extremely efficient on the gas efficiency side, extremely efficient way of managing all of your strategies that you have exposure to that you're farming, because that costs, especially during a bull market, a whole lot of money, right? That makes you almost poor if you have to pay 2030, 5100 bucks per transaction per the actual smart contract. And all of the rebalancing that you would normally do is only affordable if you have a huge portfolio size. So this is what spool version one was built for. Now, we launched in April last year, and obviously it was a pretty good launch. We went up to about 80 million in total value, routed through spool vaults immediately, within a few weeks. But then everyone knows what happened, right? We had Celsius, we had three AC, and the year was beautiful for everyone working in the industry.
00:12:38.714 - 00:13:57.634, Speaker A: So yeah, everything dunked massively. And we realized that during a bull market, when we see money is rushing in, when liquidity is everywhere and you have to try not to drown in the liquidity hitting product, market fit is way easier than a bear market. When people are questioning the premises of crypto as a whole, the ideas of having Ethereum, having deFi, is that even necessary? Is all of that a scam? And so on and so forth, that's the time when you really, really need to drill down and properly find product market fit, where you need to validate, where you need to really take the things that stop the roadblocks, that stop potential clients outside of crypto or outside of know, let's say, medium sized exchanges that just don't have a DFI offering. To get them into DFI, you need to understand exactly what stops them. And that's kind of where we got into spool v two development, where we had so much feedback from our partners, our clients, our users, and those that were not yet partners, that we really condensed everything and drilled down a product market fit, really. That's how we built V two based on V one. If you go to app swoop right now, you can set up smart vaults, you can farm really risk managed yields.
00:13:57.634 - 00:14:40.040, Speaker A: I think yields are pretty good, obviously, right now because of the USDT FUD. So yields are amazing, even on the most safe, quote, unquote, off stablecoin vaults. And, yeah, you get really solid yield in a diversified way, which means if there's an exploit, if there's an issue with one of the underlying strategies, you're always protected, you have a maximum downside, which thinks really important. None of the strategies are actively managed, means there's no one who has a key, there's no one who can run away with your money, there's no exposure of your funds to the funds of anyone else, to strategies of anyone else. So it's really the safest way to interact with Defi because it's diversified, because it's risk managed. And the yields are amazing right now. So I have most of my stables in vaults, of course.
00:14:40.040 - 00:14:43.078, Speaker A: Yeah. That's what you see with spool V one.
00:14:43.164 - 00:14:57.146, Speaker F: Simon. With spool V one, it allowed for vault strategies based around stablecoins. What does v two open up? Maybe speak to V two at a high level, and then we can break some of it down kind of piece by piece.
00:14:57.248 - 00:15:18.974, Speaker A: Yes. Pool V one was extremely efficient in what it does, especially gas efficient, as I mentioned. But we had strong limitations, as you just mentioned. We could only set up vaults with stable assets in them. So no volatile assets, no ETH wrapped ETH whatever. Nothing like that. And every single vault had to be based on one asset.
00:15:18.974 - 00:16:08.690, Speaker A: So you could only have a USDT vault or a die vault or USDC vault. You could not have USDC and USDT, because you like a strategy here, you like strategy there, you want to farm a bit of both, and you want the best of both worlds. That was not possible. Now, spool version two. The idea was to open up the toolbox and make it so flexible and composable that basically everything right now that we see in DFI and in, let's say, yeah, I mean, the wider term web3, yield, whatever that is, is possible. So the spool version two, we open up the possibility to set up multi asset vaults and also vaults with stable assets and volatile assets in them, or vaults with just volatile assets. So, for example, one of our partners staking rewards, they're already preparing for the V two launch, and they're building, I think, amazing product.
00:16:08.690 - 00:16:36.090, Speaker A: Literally the product I'm waiting for myself. They're building a broadly diversified east staking index, basically. And it's not like just a token that rebalances or rebases based on the coupon payments. Based on the payments for e staking. The rewards for e staking. No, they set up an actual vault that you can deposit ETH in. That's farming across rocket pool, it's farming across Lido Frax and a couple other protocols.
00:16:36.090 - 00:17:21.302, Speaker A: And you get, in real time, the yields from all of those. So you're farming across as many across a wide range of LSD protocols. So you have all of the benefits from lsd providers, but also it's broadly diversified. You can really minimize the black swan risk, right. Because in Defi, the issue is often we completely eradicate, in the best case, the counterparty risk. But that means that there's no way back in case of a technological error, in case of tech risk really going awry. So I believe the most efficient way of how, also in traditional banking and finance, you deal with it with these risks that you can't just roll back a transaction, say, hey, there was fat finger.
00:17:21.302 - 00:17:50.962, Speaker A: That was 10 too much. The way you deal with it is through diversification. Right. It's about statistics. If you can be in five different protocols, the max exposure, let's say, if it's all equal, is 20% to one of them. So if you've got, like 1012 percent yield, then you can't lose that much. And if you're operating for at least two years, if your thesis is the risk you're taking allows for a maximum of one black swan event, maybe every four or five years, then, of course, it's a winning game.
00:17:50.962 - 00:18:04.198, Speaker A: And I think this is missing so far in defi, a proper way to manage these binary one or zero risk. Either my money is here or it's gone. Right? And then it's all of it. It's not like, a little bit. It's all of it.
00:18:04.284 - 00:18:19.322, Speaker B: Maybe we should dig into that risk modeling or programmable risk just a bit more. Can you try to dumb that down for folks who are new to spool? How did that work in V one? And what sort of enhancements can we expect in v two?
00:18:19.456 - 00:19:22.558, Speaker A: So risk models are basically taking basic formulas and calculating risk scores, so concrete numbers for each strategy you're interacting with. So it can be based on a whole wide range of factors. And risk model providers are independent of the DAO. So everyone can provide a risk model. Everyone can just come up with one, and they generally explain what flows into the calculation. So, for example, the most popular risk model right now, the Genesis one, that was set up by one of the Dow members, the early Dow members, it takes into account things as what's kind of the risk free rate in Defi right now, right? Taking into account Ave compounds, what we see as lowest risk, the baseline. And compared to that, what's the yield that we currently get from this strategy? Which part of that is incentives? Which part of that is leverage? Which part of that is actually risky? Because, you know, incentives, the main risk is that they run out, right, and you don't get paid anymore or the value goes to almost zero.
00:19:22.558 - 00:19:58.794, Speaker A: That's worth nothing. But that's not as risky as a strategy. Relying on leverage, for example, 1.41.61, .8 whatever, which gives you exposure to a higher potential downside than you would normally have. And on the other hand side, of course, there's factors like how long has the strategy been on the market? What's the Lindy effect? How long have they been going without an exploit? How big is the bug bounty program? Who audited them? We know by now that there's a big difference between a trail of bits audit or chain security audit and a certic stamp of approval. The AI ran over this once.
00:19:58.794 - 00:20:34.630, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's what this risk model takes into account. And based on all of those factors, it comes up with a score. And then let's say the strategy has a score of a six on a scale of zero to ten. Another one has one of eight, and another one, again has one of two. So then if you set up this vault and you have multiple strategies with these different risk scores, you have a choice. You can say this vault is supposed to behave in a risk averse or in a risk seeking way. Risk seeking, of course, try to maximize yield, taking more risk than the risk neutral vault would take.
00:20:34.630 - 00:20:49.782, Speaker A: And risk averse, of course, trying to minimize risk, allowing for a bit lower yields. But it always tries to keep you in the most efficient risk reward spectrum. That's really how spool vault works and how risk model plugs in there.
00:20:49.936 - 00:21:08.226, Speaker B: Simon, earlier it sounded like we might expect an index of LST strategies in future spool vaults. And what about leverage tokens as well? Can we expect, I guess, more to do with leverage in Spool V two?
00:21:08.408 - 00:21:37.862, Speaker A: Yeah, we can, certainly. So that was one of the ideas as well. Spool version one had a lot of limitations around how liquid a token would have to be and what the worst case scenario was. So with version one, if one strategy at exposure to was, for example, completely liquid, you wanted to withdraw from all of your strategies at once. So from the vault, it would have clocked up the system. You would have to manually withdraw from all the strategies, which is costly and annoying. With spool version two, we don't have those limitations.
00:21:37.862 - 00:22:28.474, Speaker A: If there you have five strategies in a vault, one of them is acting up or not liquid, you still withdraw automatically from the four of the others, and then you can manually take care of the last one. So this allows us to really integrate leveraged strategies. It allows us to integrate maybe high yield, low liquidity, generally pretty new strategies, and provide users whatever they want at a certain point in time. Right. So we are not bound to looking into the longevity of certain strategy necessarily, but we can be a lot faster in what we integrate and what can we mix in? But the cool thing is, if you are able to properly diversify, you can just mix in one or two levered strategies into an otherwise unleveraged portfolio for the additional risk you're willing to take. Then to mix it in. Right.
00:22:28.474 - 00:22:49.714, Speaker A: Risk is a product. At the end of the day, you can slice it, dice it, buy it, sell it, and of course, the additional yield. So it makes for really, really interesting portfolio construction. And I mean, we're talking with a lot of traditional banking players as well. And a lot of this stuff in a self executing way is completely new there as well. Right, where this is just really cool infrastructure. I still get excited over it.
00:22:49.752 - 00:23:08.934, Speaker F: Simon, you touched on banking partnerships. I would love to kind of dive into some of these institutional or enterprise partnerships that you've been building. I've been seeing a lot of spool announcements coming out. What are some of the names that you can share with us and to kind of get people excited about V two?
00:23:09.052 - 00:23:43.986, Speaker A: So maybe to give a context for that, we believe that right now in the bear market, with really expensive money, central bank policy as it is, there's not too much liquidity in Defi, right. There's no one throwing around millions to try out new protocols just because of some incentives or because it's interesting just to see how it works. Maybe there will be an airdrop. There's nothing like that. So I think right now, if you're a protocol and you have Runway for at least four or five years, you're going to be good, right? Because you can build through a bear. There will be another bull market, a money printer has to go borrow sooner or later. That's just how a social economic system works at the moment.
00:23:43.986 - 00:24:47.366, Speaker A: But in the meantime, what we believe where the next wave of liquidity will come from will be institutions that are interested, that have seen the value, that have already, on a board level, on a strategic level, made the decision that they want to be part of this, that they want to use the infrastructure, they want to be innovative, they want to see what can be done better through crypto. And that's why we have certain initiatives to partner with these players. And we're working mainly on, for example, one proof of concept right now, I can say with whom we're working, but not too much else. One of the biggest asset managers in Europe and in the world, I think they're at about 800 billion assets under management right now. And we're really working on the concept of a proper on chain fund with both DFI and crypto native assets, but also with real world assets that have been tokenized. There are a couple of players in the space that are, there's the mean tokenization of everything will be tokenized. Please let that help us raise 50 million, 100 million, whatever.
00:24:47.366 - 00:25:23.214, Speaker A: And then there's the, okay, here's the security. Can we just make a token that represents that and fulfills all the functions so we can get rid of the paper trail and it's regulating everything because it's literally Microsoft share or something like that, or a bond of some big corporation. And that's actually really interesting, right? It doesn't sound so sexy. But we've got, for example, in Germany, pretty advanced regulation that allows for a fully on chain trail for securities. So you don't have to have anything with the notary. No central depository. Well, rather the central depository could be ethereum, could be polygon, can just be a blockchain.
00:25:23.214 - 00:26:08.910, Speaker A: By law this is fine. So we've got close relationships with, for example, Haugofasa, a bank that recently issued a Siemens, a large german based tech conglomerate. Their corporate bond, they completely launched it on polygon. There's no paper trail, nothing like that, because if you have that, all of a sudden you can do really cool stuff in portfolios, right? Because you could buy that corporate bond, I don't know what's yielding. Let's say it's yielding 4% or something. You put that into a vault. You pair it with, for example, a backed finance ribbon USDC burn strategy that has USD treasury yields in there, but then also mixes it with other cool stuff, like, I think they do like 2% yield from US treasuries.
00:26:08.910 - 00:26:52.158, Speaker A: And the other, was it two and a half percent or something like that? They put into short term data neutral strategies, and it's just more risk. But they add it to a very low risk thing and you mix it in, you've got another realtor, then you mix that with, for example, LSDs, that allow you to get four and a half, five and a half. Let's see where the right goes with ETH percent. And all of a sudden you've got this really interesting portfolio that is completely novel, right? Like, if I'm a traditional investor and I just see something like that. And other people, like, for example, incrementum gold, they're one of the larger gold fund providers as well. They just have a fund with bitcoin and gold in there. And I think it's just five to 10% bitcoin, depending on which product.
00:26:52.158 - 00:27:36.286, Speaker A: But that's really interesting, because all of a sudden it allows for completely new profiles when it comes to investing. And that in itself, in a financial and securities world, that is a bit boring at times. And there's also loads of grift, right? I could tell stories about ESG and so on and tobacco companies, but this is interesting. And this could actually be even ESG friendly if it's on Ethereum, on Polygon and so on. So this has actual use. And if we get into the entire question around how do we deal with crypto being labeled as security in different places and different tokens, different protocols. There's of course, two words, but this product and this range of potentially on chain digital funds you can set up.
00:27:36.286 - 00:28:24.890, Speaker A: They would obviously be securities, but then again, it wouldn't be an issue because it's very straightforward. You can just publish a prospectus that outlines exactly the risks, the potential returns, everything an investor needs to know. And you're selling directly to larger asset managers that require this anyways. So I believe there's huge potential in that, that not too many people have seen yet, because we've got this ho issue with crypto people not really understanding traditional banking and finance and traditional banking and finance people having no clue what's going on in DeFi and what we're doing over here. So I don't know. There's probably like a couple of hundred people that are somewhere in between and properly grew up with crypto, with DFI from the start, but also have a solid understanding of what's going on in boardrooms, in finance.
00:28:24.970 - 00:28:54.326, Speaker F: Simon, I know the spool team spent a lot of time in 2022 talking with a lot of these institutional players, maybe outline some of the things and feedback that you're hearing from them and what you've implemented into spool V two to allow them to onboard and come in. Like, what were the impediments? What was holding them back? You also mentioned ESG friendly. Yeah, maybe kind of wrap all those items into your answer if you can.
00:28:54.428 - 00:29:45.794, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of very funny answers. I could not tell a lot of funny war in general. Main issue is really timelines because as I mentioned earlier, in crypto we are kind of living at light speed and we're also aging at light speed. And everything is, things are being built and breaking within three months, and they go the full cycle from sound money to fractional reserve and then the crisis and breaking within a couple of months. But many large asset managers and large institutions, they think in time for himself around five years. So one talk I had with a large banking group, they said, Simon, this is cool and we probably want to do it. But 2023, we're going to spend figuring out strategically if we want to do crypto and what we want to do in crypto 2024, we probably hire more crypto people and we look at acquisition targets.
00:29:45.794 - 00:30:44.150, Speaker A: And then the end of the year, maybe going into 2025, then we can really do stuff, right? But until then, we can do papers, we can do some research, we can figure out what doesn't work in general, but the key roadblocks that can actually be fixed. That does not mean stuff about these people taking five years to make decisions is, first of all, regulatory clarity. I mean, that's the most obvious thing where some jurisdictions are better than others. But it's not like there's a big grass screen on the other side issue, I think, between Europeans and Americans, because it's not that great here either. It's not like you've got a cop on the beat and horror stories and all of that stuff. But these institutions, regulators, the central regulators in Europe, they are massively understaffed. And of course, they don't have any people that understand this stuff, maybe one or two, but then they have to deal with hundreds of applications, to be a custodian, to be a bank that is in crypto, and so on and so forth.
00:30:44.150 - 00:31:30.806, Speaker A: So these guys are just underfunded, understaffed, they have no idea what's going on. And at least in Germany, I believe they try their best. It's just not that great. But regulatory clarity. So the best thing you can do, I believe this crypto protocol is Defi protocol is what we did. We took one of the three top capital markets lawyers in the EU, and especially in Germany, because Germany and France have a decent level of regulatory clarity. And they're big enough that now with markets and crypto asset regulation coming across, the EU coming into effect, that if you're going to be able to place something and be safe in Germany or in France, it's going to be fine in pretty much all european member states, right? You're going to be able to sell to Spaniards, sell to Portuguese, sell to Italians, and so on.
00:31:30.806 - 00:32:01.166, Speaker A: It should be fine. So what we did is we did a complete analysis of spoolie version, two different use cases, how it would be used by our potential clients, by banks, by institutions, by exchanges, and what this means. Do they need a license? If they offer this kind of product, what kind of license is it? A simple portfolio management license that doesn't cost much. It can apply really fast. It's probably less than like 30 grand or something to get that. For most institutions, that's fine. So we kind of did the work for them because we said we can act as a multiplier.
00:32:01.166 - 00:32:43.438, Speaker A: We do this once and then 20 of our partners can use it instead of them doing it individually. On the other hand side, it is compliance to a large degree. And Dave always got the issue that, I hope I'm not making myself unpopular, but compliance departments tend to not have the most innovation friendly people, right? It tends to be the kind of people that just want to make sure that nothing breaks, no one goes to jail. But of course, this is not a way you can build any business. This is kind of just how you manage it once it's big enough. So the issue is really going through compliance departments, making these people happy, because you can make the biostaff people happy, you can make anyone in the commercial side happy. You can even make the tech people happy.
00:32:43.438 - 00:33:10.806, Speaker A: But in the end, it's easy to get a no or like, hey, we tried with compliance, if it's just not possible, and we've got funny stuff there. One guy told me, know, ethereum itself might be critical, because if we pay for a transaction, we don't know where the money goes. Right. It could be operator in North Korea and then we've got the whole sanctions issue. Right. So it does one of the funniest things I heard. But yeah, overall make the compliance people happy somehow.
00:33:10.806 - 00:33:22.160, Speaker A: Make the tech people happy, of course, with being able to actually interact with their tech stack and then give them as much regulatory clarity as you can provide.
00:33:23.010 - 00:33:31.038, Speaker F: Simon, I want to pivot a little bit here into some of the new protocols that spool will be integrating into V two.
00:33:31.204 - 00:34:26.078, Speaker A: I can't spoil too much because again, I don't want to throw all devs under the bus, but big trend we mentioned earlier will be LSDs and LSTs. So we definitely believe that right now in this bear, one of the coolest things is kind of how ETH is just moving on without too many big news, without too much drama around it, which I think is exactly how it should be for a big protocol. You don't want constant ups and downs and amazing news and then horrible news. You want things to just happen and everyone's kind of like, yeah, of course it happens like that. That's exactly what you want. So as far as ETH going fully to proof of stake, having Chappella being able to actually withdraw your funds that you've been staking for a very long time by now, that opens up a whole lot of opportunities. And we also see that with institutions that each staking is a product that's actually way easier to sell than lending borrowing.
00:34:26.078 - 00:34:53.654, Speaker A: So really happy about that. That's why we are focusing mainly on integrating with those guys. But then again, also we are really interested in real world assets, to be honest. Like for example, the ribbon financebacked product. That's really innovative things still pretty small. They've got I don't know how much, but probably around 4 million or something in there. I think Matrix port also set up a curve three pool for USD, treasury bonds, SCBT.
00:34:53.654 - 00:35:34.658, Speaker A: I think the stablecoin based on that, that's also really cool. Honestly, I think they're at around 10 million. So we're really interested in that stuff. But that's the one thing with spool version two, we will completely shift kind of how our development works. Since spool version one, we've started scoping for version two. All the things we need to do differently, all the things that we need to build also for a bear market and find real product market fit. But as it looks right now, there will not be a huge swoo version three because we've just spent a year working on making the fundamentals as open and interoperable as humanly possible, so that we can just focus on new strategies and quality of life features.
00:35:34.658 - 00:36:16.470, Speaker A: So we will just be integrating strategies left and right, and protocols left and right and mean. In a bear market, there's honestly not even that much happening right. In a bull, you have the main issue of everyone wants to be everywhere all at once. And there's new protocols popping up left and right multiple times a week. In API, it's different, right, there's a couple protocol innovations popping up, a couple of really cool things like Eigen layer and so on that are interesting if it's long term sustainable or not completely relevant, but that's interesting, that captures the narrative that people engage with. So yeah, there's a lot coming up, really, with integrations.
00:36:16.810 - 00:36:28.174, Speaker B: Really interesting. Simon, for those who are new to spool, what is the utility behind the spool token like? How does that operate within the spool protocol and ecosystem?
00:36:28.322 - 00:37:10.802, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very straightforward. So spool is very low when it comes to fees, but also very efficient. So whenever fees are generated, whenever yields are generated through spool walls. So let's say you put in 100 grand at the end of the year, pull out 105 grand, because 5% yield, for example, the spool Dow takes 10% off the yield. So it's a 10% performance fee across all vaults, completely flat. We don't care if it's a big bank using it or if it's just me personally using it. And of this, a small amount goes to paying for basically the gas fees because we make transactions and all of the rebalancing extremely cheap.
00:37:10.802 - 00:37:41.738, Speaker A: But then again, there's still some gas fees, so the DAO pays for those. So for users it's completely gas free, but the vast majority of the fees go to token stakers. How does this work? If you decide to stake, there's really no downside. So it's a fewer gain. As soon as you stake, you basically accrue Vospool, which is your voting enabled spool. That allows you to take part in governance, but also that makes sure that you get your share of the fees being taken by the DAO. So you get fees directly.
00:37:41.738 - 00:38:08.290, Speaker A: The longer you stake, the more share of the fees you get, the more voting power you get, and it just ramps up over time. Now, the cool thing is you can unstake at any time. There's absolutely zero lock in. The only thing is, as soon as you unstake, you lose your voting power. And with that, of course, also you share of the revenues. So the idea is that there's never any downsides to staking. As soon as you hold swoop tokens, you should be staking, otherwise you're just leaving money on the street.
00:38:08.290 - 00:38:23.662, Speaker A: But of course, the longer you stake, the higher the opportunity cost. That way you can of course always take your money, but it becomes less and less valuable for you. It becomes more and more expensive to unstake. That's the idea behind it.
00:38:23.796 - 00:38:57.666, Speaker F: Simon with spool V two employing these vault strategies, has anybody been thinking kind of like, I know spool V two is just coming out, but is there anyone kind of looking towards the horizon with the rise of these AI agents and kind of like the inception of these actively managed on chain strategies via these agents? Is there any research being done into that? Or is that something that the spool team has looked at? Is that something that you see as viable in the long term?
00:38:57.778 - 00:39:59.286, Speaker A: So I think right now there's a lot of hopes and a lot of hype around AI. So of course people, you're trying to employ it and everything, but in portfolio management it could actually be useful, right? So we already have the way that spool risk models work where risk scores are calculated on ongoing basis. And if you have a, you know, you can have either static risk models, basically, where you set the way that things are calculated once and they stay like that, or you can also have actively managed ones where then it goes more in the direction of an actively managed vault where risk scores are updated, situations change, calculations change, and for that, AI would actually be pretty useful. That's one cool thing. Also, if you want to completely eliminate human discretion when it comes to the management of your vault, to the management of your portfolio. So if you are, let's say, an institution and not legal advice, right, and depends on jurisdiction you're in. But one of the big issues around things being a security is always discretion, human discretion, and the ability to make changes to the ability to withdraw money and so on and so forth.
00:39:59.286 - 00:40:17.602, Speaker A: But now, if you set up a vault, you set up a risk model either. If this risk model is static, you could say there's no human discretion. Everything is set in stone. I have no influence. I can't do anything even if I wanted to, I have no choice. And then if a user deposits their own funds, it's their own decision. They do with their own money whatever they want.
00:40:17.602 - 00:40:53.310, Speaker A: So not my thing. But if you want an actively managed strategies, that of course has a lot of advantages, you could employ an AI model, right? And say I feed it with this amount of data, this is how I want to train it. I give a reasonable amount of transparency also to users about what data this AI is basing its decisions on how the model works. And then you could have an actively managed portfolio for other people. Basically that you still could argue that there's no human discretion as long as you're unable to make changes to the AI. If you can, on the fly, just overwrite it. Different story.
00:40:53.310 - 00:41:24.950, Speaker A: But then we get into a tie topic of responsibility. And if someone is kind of actively managing your portfolio, do you want them to be personally responsible? What happens if wherever the AI model is running, electricity goes out and your entire money gets screwed over? But that's a different thing. And I think the cool thing in Defi is we can experiment, we can just do stuff like that. And honestly, people would probably deposit 20, 30 million, just try it out and we see how it goes. That's why we're in the space, right?
00:41:25.020 - 00:41:57.218, Speaker B: Yeah, we got some wild times ahead of us. I'm thinking of AI as like an intelligence money lego. I'm calling it a money Lego because it'll fit right into the defi stack and vice versa. I think that AI startups are going to think how to leverage Defi in their own tech stack. So yeah, really exciting stuff. This is probably a great place for us to start to wrap up, but I wanted to end on when do you think V two is coming to market and any other alpha you'd like to leave our listeners with?
00:41:57.304 - 00:42:18.070, Speaker A: So V two is coming around pretty soon, actually. So we're already done with the big audits. We are chain security and trail of bits all done all through. What we're doing though is we're going to do a closed beta. So if you're a protocol, then get in touch with us, we'll get you access to the closed beta. If you're a normal user like us, maybe not. Maybe because I get access because I'm working there.
00:42:18.070 - 00:42:59.330, Speaker A: But otherwise it will take a bit longer for us to just push the front end life simply because we want to try everything out in production first. We want to see everything running stable, push some small quality of life improvements, and also polish our SDK so that it really works for everyone integrating and with the partners in the closed beta, we can hold their hands, we can have our devs actively work with them. So it should be around one month to close beta and probably another month until it's publicly available. So things are dropping really, really soon. And yeah, I think we dropped a lot of alpha. Honestly, I talked a lot about things that I haven't talked on other podcasts about. So yeah, Squibbie Two is massive.
00:42:59.330 - 00:43:14.022, Speaker A: It allows you really to use functionalities that replace many other protocols. It's really efficient. It's really low in fees as well, compared to the market. And yeah, it's fully composable. That was our goal.
00:43:14.086 - 00:43:27.534, Speaker B: And I want to remind listeners to learn more at Spool Phi. They can also follow spool on Twitter at just spool Phi. Simon, anything else though, you'd like to share before we go?
00:43:27.652 - 00:44:03.306, Speaker A: Maybe just if you're in any way, shape or form interested, join the discord. Hop on in. We've got good discussions and the way how I always feel the bear market's ending is when people start coming back, right? And they just start engaging again when normally they leave. They go back to their jobs and families and wives and kids and they leave the discord. But now people are coming back and we really have good interaction, people asking great questions, people just being interested. So that's one of the things that makes me the most happy to work in Defi, seeing people coming back into the discord, just discussing things with us. So hop on in.
00:44:03.306 - 00:44:05.434, Speaker A: Join the discord if you want to.
00:44:05.632 - 00:44:32.654, Speaker B: This is where legends are born. They're born in the bear market. I can speak to my own experience. The greatest value you will derive is what you are building during these times. The bull market's fun, but this is where you really separate yourself from the pack. And I think spool is a great example of a team focused on the right things during this bear market. So thanks so much Simon, for your time.
