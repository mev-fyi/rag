00:00:03.850 - 00:00:35.442, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi. Talks of Defi. Dad. Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It is Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Today we're going to be talking about Volmex, which is a tokenized volatility protocol.
00:00:35.442 - 00:01:21.030, Speaker A: And we'll be speaking here with the founder of Volmex, Cole Kennely. Cole is a longtime crypto OG. He's been a builder in the space for many years. I knew Cole long before he started building Volmex. So it's been exciting to see you really transition into that founder role. Part of the reason we want to talk about Volmex is I think it's one of the very novel new money Legos that's launched over the last year or so, and it mirrors a very popular product in traditional finance called the VIX, a volatility index. And so we're going to talk all about why that matters, why we need a Defi native index.
00:01:21.030 - 00:01:39.754, Speaker A: Cole and his team have built a few different volatility indexes already, like EtHV and BTCV. And yeah, just excited to kind of talk through what are some of the potential use cases for this and future products. So, Cole, sorry I cut you off, man. How are you doing today? Welcome.
00:01:39.952 - 00:01:42.460, Speaker B: Doing awesome. Thanks for having me. Travis, this is.
00:01:45.230 - 00:02:03.970, Speaker A: Why don't we. Let's start with some of your background. I kind of alluded to the fact, like, you've been in the space for quite some time, but tell us more about when did you get started in crypto, actually? Did you get started with bitcoin or did you come right into Ethereum?
00:02:04.470 - 00:02:52.180, Speaker B: Yeah. So I first got involved in the crypto space in 2016. I found Ethereum back then, and I was very lucky that I kept following the space through 2017, through 2018. And pretty early on, I had found DFI. So I had stumbled upon Uniswap and maker and got really interested in this defi space in the early days and started doing some research on the space at that time, becoming friends with the teams. I also had started a community in DeFi NYC, a meetup group in New York, which was really great. And yeah, I went on to become an early employee, second employee at staked us and helped them grow their business a lot in the staking space.
00:02:52.180 - 00:03:18.810, Speaker B: And I've been a crypto investor and crypto trader throughout this journey as well, and have been trading some derivative products and also learning about the derivative space through some life experience as well. And yeah, had the idea for Volmex in 2020 and started specking out how it could work and started building then. So it's kind of a bit about my background and kind of what led me to Volmex.
00:03:19.390 - 00:03:59.450, Speaker A: I'm curious, given the time you've spent in the space as an investor and a builder, I guess. What do you think of where we are today? It's 2022. There's about 200 billion in assets that are active within DFI. I think the estimated market cap of NFT projects is around like 40 billion. I don't even know where the total crypto market cap is today, but I think we peaked around 2 trillion recently. How do you make sense of all of this? Where do you think we are in terms of that journey?
00:04:00.430 - 00:04:33.060, Speaker B: Yeah, it's such an exciting time in crypto. I think bitcoin and ETH are volatile week to week and certainly really volatile, but I think the fundamentals have never been stronger. Like you said, there's $200 billion now locked in different d five protocols. Like when I first got in the space uniswap had less than a million dollars and was super small. Just going parabolic since kind of the early days and been really wild to watch.
00:04:37.830 - 00:05:04.366, Speaker A: Oh, shoot. Cole might have just dropped off. So give me a sec here. I'm going to try to get Cole back. Let's see here. Okay, cool. Here we are.
00:05:04.366 - 00:05:07.566, Speaker A: Let me just put Cole back on. Hey, there we go.
00:05:07.668 - 00:05:09.086, Speaker B: We're still live here.
00:05:09.268 - 00:05:23.700, Speaker A: You are back. So you got cut off, I think. As you were saying, I had just asked you the question just about kind of like, where are we right now? Actually, it's probably more of a question around. Sorry.
00:05:25.050 - 00:05:27.110, Speaker B: Just lost connection, but sorry.
00:05:27.180 - 00:06:14.782, Speaker A: You're all good. No, you're good now, I think. I mean, to sort of call out that DFI really ignited in summer 2020. Then we had really a huge year of growth, I mean, a few years of growth, and we went from less than 1 billion in total value locked. Or maybe if anyone's unfamiliar with that, just think about how much the value of all assets are that are transacting within DeFi. And in this case, this is across multiple chains, not just, and I want to say the last six months, you've heard that narrative of DeFi is dead. There was a real focus on NFT projects.
00:06:14.782 - 00:06:30.170, Speaker A: So I guess that's what I'm trying to kind of make sense of is where you think we are in that journey. What basically is going to propel us to that next inflection point in DeFi.
00:06:30.590 - 00:07:08.630, Speaker B: Yeah. So sorry for getting disconnected, but I think it's a super exciting time in know TVL is at an all time high across all the different protocols. I think DeFi derivatives are going to be a major driver of growth moving forward. So we're really excited about the volatility product subvertical in the DeFi derivative sector. There's a lot of other exciting things going on across options and futures and other types of products. So we believe that DeFi derivatives will be a major driver of growth for defi moving forward. And there's a lot of other exciting things going on in the space, but that's kind of where our focus lies.
00:07:10.890 - 00:08:16.330, Speaker A: What was the genesis then for building Volmex? Because one of the things that sticks out that you just said, there's this ability to, of course, speculate with volatility indexes. And that's true of what we talked earlier about the VIX. I see speculation as a tool for creating that much more attention on the space. And even though, of course it has downsides to it, it was one of the things that sort of drew me to Volmex is like, okay, this is a new offering that looks like something else in the traditional world of finance, so it's not going to be difficult for people to understand what it is, but they also have the ability to, of course, enjoy the speculation around that volatility. So anyways, we'd kind of love to dig into what was your thinking in terms of getting started with Volmex?
00:08:16.750 - 00:08:58.470, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So VIX is an extremely successful index in the equity market, as are the products around it are very popular. So there's futures, options, ETF products. The success of VIX kind of led us to thinking to our thesis that there will be a dominant volatility index, volatility indices in the crypto space. So people, traders, market participants can use the Volmex indexes and Volmex products in similar ways as they can use the VIX index in the equities market. So for speculation purposes, for hedging risk, also as an indicator. So it's actually a very versatile product.
00:08:58.470 - 00:09:25.140, Speaker B: It's also a fairly intuitive product as it's a single product or a single index which goes up and goes down based on market volatility. So it's a really great tool for a savvy trader in the financial markets, whether crypto or the equity market. So our view is that there will be a very dominant primitive like this in crypto, and we're hyper focused on bringing that to market.
00:09:26.710 - 00:09:38.870, Speaker A: Maybe this is a good time actually for us to screen share. Would you want to start to kind of walk us through. What does the ETH volatility index look like? How has it performed recently?
00:09:39.210 - 00:09:42.280, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Can I share my screen?
00:09:43.050 - 00:09:48.694, Speaker A: Awesome. And here we go. All right, there we go. Yeah, walk us through, what are we looking at here?
00:09:48.812 - 00:10:37.634, Speaker B: Awesome. So right here you have our web app. This is a web application that's connected to the Volumex smart contracts. So right here, this is the modal that a minter or liquidity provider would see. So they could enter the amount of Dai or USDC which they would like to deposit to the Volmex protocol. And from here they can click approve and click mint and then they'll mint these volatility tokens ethv and iathv, and then can provision liquidity on different dexes like quickswap. So once the tokens, ETHV and IFV are minted, they can head to quickswap and provision liquidity ETHv against USDC and IEV against USDC and earn trading fees.
00:10:37.634 - 00:11:32.150, Speaker B: So that's kind of the liquidity provider user experience is minting on the mint page and then heading over to quickswap or another Dex to earn trading fees. It looks like it's a little slow to load there. And then traders can head to quickswap or other different exchanges and swap for volatility tokens. So looks like there's a little delay on the loading. But yeah, basically mint the tokens and LP to earn trading fees ethv and IFV and then traders swap for volatility tokens and buy and sell to generate profits and to either speculate or hedge their market volatility. So generally that's the user experience is liquidity providers mint and then LP and then traders buy and sell to speculate or hedge the market volatility.
00:11:32.310 - 00:11:53.540, Speaker A: Can you walk us through some of the price action on maybe ethv is a good one to focus on and curious, I don't know if you can kind of relate some of it to what's happened in the markets recently. I'm trying to think like the major market drawdown or crash was probably a week, a week and a half ago.
00:11:54.070 - 00:12:04.020, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So right here we've got e three chart on this gecko terminal, so it's a little slow to load up.
00:12:04.550 - 00:12:18.614, Speaker A: Oh yeah, no worries. No, take your time. Don't worry. I've actually had my computer crash a few times better for you as a guest. I've had yours crash. When it's me that crashes, it creates a lot more problems.
00:12:18.732 - 00:12:51.650, Speaker B: It's being a little slow right now. Basically, a few weeks ago there was a ton of volatility and EtHV had seen some spikes and I think traders were able to capitalize on the market volatility. So ETHV had increased from, believe it was like around 110 to 100 and 3135. So if you can imagine someone had purchased the Ethereum volatility index token at this 110 level, they can sell it at 135 at a profit.
00:12:54.970 - 00:13:11.370, Speaker A: There you go. It's up now. There you go. Cool. You switch tabs there. Yeah, this looks much better. Yeah, because the e V index, obviously it spiked on days where we have like a major sort of sell off.
00:13:11.370 - 00:13:47.880, Speaker A: And this provides a different sort of exposure. I think anyone can see that most of the tokens in the crypto market are very correlated. In fact, I mean, it would be very rare for anything to be going up when everything else is going down or something to go down while everything else goes up. And so this presents some new and interesting exposure. I mean, this is part of what I just sort of summarized there is part of the reason the VIX is so interesting and why it's one of the most popular products that's traded in the world.
00:13:49.130 - 00:14:16.320, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. We think this is a really powerful concept and we've already received some awesome traction and great feedback from our users and we're really excited about where we're headed and the future of volatility indexes and volatility products in crypto. Yeah, so I think this is a very important primitive in Defi and there's a lot of use cases and things to be excited about related to it.
00:14:17.490 - 00:14:43.510, Speaker A: Going back to. So we've talked a lot about the indexes themselves and the two most popular ones so far, EtHV and BTCV. Do you have any other use cases in mind that you're hoping other builders will use these for? Or if you want to talk about future products that you guys are developing, I think that's a part of the roadmap I'd be interested to explore.
00:14:44.170 - 00:15:57.626, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So in terms of use cases, hedging market volatility, speculating on market volatility, which we've already covered, the volatility index is also a great indicator, so it can be used as a gauge of market sentiment. Traders can look to the volatility index to get a sense of how volatile the market is expecting the market to be over the foreseeable future. So there's certainly some use cases on that front. And in terms of other types of use cases, volatility tokens are very composable so traders can, or excuse me, integrators can integrate volatility tokens into different apps and protocols and leverage this sort of exposure in this product. Definitely we've seen some integrations in terms of some whitelistings on different sorts of Defi protocols like fuse and gelato G Uni, and we expect to see more integrations of this sorts. We also expect there to be different sorts of strategies, know vault strategies and automation that gets built around VLMex products and volatility tokens.
00:15:57.626 - 00:16:05.220, Speaker B: So we're really excited about that and we think that there's really unlimited potential with what the community can build with this tech.
00:16:05.910 - 00:17:00.930, Speaker A: Yeah, one thing that's missing here is you can mint the index and choose to LP with those indexes. You can buy them or swap for them on something like Uniswap or a Dex aggregator. But obviously there's going to be those that want to trade this with leverage in the future. And so I'm thinking like there's all sorts of interesting new protocols that are being built, especially those that would allow you to permissionlessly create leveraged exposure to different tokens. So I want to say tracerdao is one of them. I might be wrong on that, I was just kind of reading up about them recently, but that feels like a really sort of obvious future product use case that we can expect due to all of the composability within Defi.
00:17:01.270 - 00:17:49.410, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. I think there's tons of stuff that can be built with this volatility token volatility index concept. To answer your second question previously, or your second question before, with regards to future releases and what to expect from us, I would really say we're going to be rolling out some major improvements to the current volatility token implementation, or making some improvements to this volatility token implementation, and also working on some really exciting other products that are built around our volatility index. So we have some really exciting announcements coming soon and would encourage everyone to follow us on Twitter or join our discord to receive the update when we publish that. So we've got some really exciting things that we're working on and definitely stay tuned.
00:17:49.910 - 00:18:29.280, Speaker A: Yeah, anything else within V two you're able to share that's coming? I'm trying to think. My focus has mainly been around the opportunity to LP, the opportunity to hold exposure to any of those indexes. Oh, also reminder to anyone too, just because there's lots of scammers out there right now, there is no Volmex token. So just if you see anything about that and you're watching this on February 2, 2022 or whenever there isn't a token as of today. So be mindful of that. But yeah, Cole, anything else about V two that we can share that's coming, or I guess any new volatility indexes that might be launching soon.
00:18:30.050 - 00:19:02.042, Speaker B: So V Two is going to be really awesome. And there's some major improvements to usability and the UX coming. I will be publishing some more details on this very soon and I'll definitely be sharing with the community. We'll be sharing with the community, I think. Definitely stay tuned for that. And major improvements with swapping volatility tokens from LP point of view as well. So we're really excited about it and it's coming quite soon.
00:19:02.042 - 00:19:34.500, Speaker B: So definitely keep an eye out for that. In terms of other volatility indexes, given that the way that this is derived is using options market data, we're a little constrained to the data that's available in the options market. So there's a major drop off after bitcoin and Ethereum, but we're exploring other ways to list volatility products on different assets aside from bitcoin and Ethereum. So stay tuned for that as well. So, really excited about some of the future releases we've got coming up.
00:19:35.270 - 00:19:41.720, Speaker A: Actually, I wasn't aware of that. I guess I've never asked you about it. Where do you source that data from?
00:19:43.050 - 00:19:57.050, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now we source this data from one of the leading options exchanges, which is dervit, and we're working on integrating other options venues to make our methodology further even more robust.
00:20:01.490 - 00:20:17.120, Speaker A: This is a grouping within DeFi that's still so early on. Chain options have just started to become more popular as well. I cannot imagine the amount of liquidity here that's yet to grow.
00:20:17.830 - 00:20:53.820, Speaker B: Look forward to we look forward to the volatility token or volatility index calculation being done entirely on chain via a very robust DeFi options market in the future. But we think our current architecture is certainly the best implementation at this time. So yeah, that's kind of how we think about that. We're really excited about the DeFi derivative space, DeFi options and defi derivatives of all sorts. So something that is very relevant and it's a big focus for us, obviously.
00:20:54.290 - 00:21:22.630, Speaker A: Awesome, man. Well, hey, this was great to be able to catch up and kind of just talk shop about what you guys are building. Reminder to everyone too. You can follow Cole and Volmex here below on Twitter. You can learn more about Volmex at Volmex Finance, be sure to check out their discord group. Per usual, there's a lot of activity there if you want to learn more about their products and talk with others within the community. And then if you enjoyed the interview, please subscribe at DeFi dad.
00:21:22.630 - 00:21:29.240, Speaker A: There's lots more tutorials and interviews with leading founders like Cole Cole, anything else you wanted to share before we go?
00:21:29.610 - 00:21:45.630, Speaker B: Thanks so much for having me. This was a real blast and I think you said it well. Join our discord. Follow us on Twitter, you can learn more about the protocol at Vulmax Finance or Docs at Docs Vaulmex Finance. And stay tuned for all the exciting releases we've got coming.
00:21:45.780 - 00:21:49.120, Speaker A: I forgot to ask you, will you be at.
00:21:50.370 - 00:21:56.654, Speaker B: Ah, yeah, I think. I don't have a ticket yet, but I applied as a hacker and I'm definitely nice.
00:21:56.852 - 00:22:20.820, Speaker A: I don't know if I'm going to be there, but that should be a great, um, if anyone's never been to that, just a. It's a really sort of like, inspiring place to be. Lots and lots of great people to meet there that are building really cool concepts within the community. So anyways, hey, thanks, Cole. Thanks everyone for tuning in. I'm going to end the broadcast right here and have a great day. We'll see you soon.
