00:00:00.250 - 00:00:13.790, Speaker A: So I like to describe it in two different ways. First is a d five prime brokerage. I think that's like the most accurate financial description. The simpler way to say it is it's a money market where you can borrow up to 20 extra money and use it for your favorite D five strategies.
00:00:16.370 - 00:00:46.394, Speaker B: Welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad, here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's episode will spotlight a new D five prime brokerage in the making, Blueberry protocol. Having just launched on Ethereum Mainnet, we'll discuss how blueberry works, what aggregated strategies we can expect in its defi terminal, and how they will offer leverage for the most in demand defi strategies, including pendle finance LRT markets. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the Edge podcast possible.

00:03:16.750 - 00:03:22.778, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce Slater Heal, the co founder of Blueberry Protocol. Slater, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:22.864 - 00:03:28.382, Speaker A: I'm doing great, dad. Nomadic. It's great to see you guys face to face. I appreciate you guys having me on.
00:03:28.436 - 00:04:14.186, Speaker B: So today we're going to talk about this lockdrop that recently launched, and really, this is the launch of Blueberry Protocol. It's just like the first step or first phase of it. So there's lots to dig into there. But more importantly, I think what prompted us recording this podcast is you have this very grand vision of a DeFi prime brokerage. And that's a lot to actually unpack, unless folks are from the traditional finance world. And I'm hoping you can help us to understand all the moving parts within blueberry protocol, how they relate to existing DeFi protocols, what's new, what's new and innovative, I guess, and how we can get involved. So why don't we start with the usual about your background.
00:04:14.186 - 00:04:24.970, Speaker B: You have a really interesting background. So, yeah, if you can share a bit about maybe the family business and some more about what you worked on in tradfi.
00:04:25.050 - 00:05:10.686, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I feel like everybody's kind of got a nontraditional background in Defi, and I am the same in that regard. So I originally kind of came from the commodities trading worlds. Our kind of family office business is one of the larger commodity crop buyers and traders in the west coast, the US. And so the processing plants do about a trillion or a few trillion pounds of volume per year. And so it's about 80% of the corn, 80% of the rice, and 90% of the wheat from California is purchased and kind of processed. And so around that inventory, there's a few trading houses, and originally kind of got my exposure to financial markets from that business lens with large scale commodities, two things.
00:05:10.686 - 00:05:57.520, Speaker A: One is that they're super liquid, right? And there's really every kind of financial derivative you could imagine built around these markets, and a lot of customizability with how you want to manage your risk and what kind of trades you want to put on. That's obviously very different, much less volatile market, with the exception of orange juice in the last year. Right. It was the best performing asset last year. That was kind of my original financial background, and then got very interested in crypto in around 2017. And around that time was also when cannabis was first getting legalized in California, and so ended up starting a business for growing and processing cannabis. Kind of similar infrastructure from the old family business, right.
00:05:57.520 - 00:06:27.878, Speaker A: And taken a somewhat similar approach. That company was called El Dorado Group and did that from 2018 to 2020. But all the while was very interested in DFI. Right. And was able to kind of get out of that business and basically took all my money and put it into a DFI fund in 2020. And it was all I could think about all day, every day. So just went full time and kind of gave myself a full time job to learn the ropes and learn what the right entry point was to eventually be a protocol founder that led up to 2022.
00:06:27.878 - 00:06:49.710, Speaker A: And the bear market was pretty clearly hitting, and it felt like it was a build market. It was time to build something ambitious. And our kind of underlying mission is how can we achieve feature parity with drabfi and a fully decentralized, noncustodial format. So we felt like a true prime brokerage product was one of the missing pieces there. And that was kind of the inspiration for blueberry. And my story leads into it.
00:06:49.780 - 00:06:55.246, Speaker E: Like, in some ways, you were really living that yield farmer meme.
00:06:55.358 - 00:06:57.154, Speaker A: Literal farming. Yeah, exactly.
00:06:57.272 - 00:07:07.470, Speaker E: All right, let's get into blueberry protocol. Maybe give us kind of like the high level elevator pitch, for starters, and we'll get into it a little bit more in depth.
00:07:07.550 - 00:08:21.338, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So I like to describe it in two different ways. First is a DeFi prime brokerage. I think that's, like, the most accurate financial description as to what the product is. But there's also a lot of products that call themselves prime brokerages in defi, and often they're really over collateralized money markets, which can kind of be used in that form. So the other way I've been describing it is a defi terminal, basically a place that has a money market at the core, and then an aggregator of all the different strategies and trades that you'd want to take in DeFi, whether that's a yield trade or an arbitrage trade, or actually going leverage long or leverage short, kind of aggregating all the stuff you want to do in DeFi in one place, then having a money market at the core where you can borrow with leverage and do whatever your preferred kind of trade is. And because the money market is attached to the aggregator, it understands the risk of the aggregated strategies of the integrated strategies and can appropriately assign the max leverage and max position that you can take to the position that you're ultimately making based on the unique relationship of collateral asset debt asset and the actual trade or position that you're deploying to.
00:08:21.338 - 00:08:36.214, Speaker A: So a simpler way to say it is, it's a money market where you can borrow up to 20 extra money and use it for your favorite DFI strategies. And it also serves as a terminal where you can track your PNLs, see the live performance, et cetera, and kind of cleans up the user experience of DFI.
00:08:36.282 - 00:08:56.678, Speaker E: Very cool. Maybe before we start to unpack some of that, something I was looking at in just like your recent raise announcement was, Chainlink was part of the cap table, and I don't see that very often. And I was just kind of curious what initiated that investment or partnership or what's the connection there.
00:08:56.764 - 00:09:53.818, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're definitely a protocol that's heavily reliant on Chainlink services. So, of course, oracles being at the core for the majority of the money market assets, and then also using chain link automation to perform the strategies themselves, in some cases, especially with like uniswap e three automated liquidity provision strategies, and then also performing liquidations on positions that need to be liquidated. So all of that costs chain link and their new kind of economic model. And so it was also right when they were starting the Chainlink build program. So we were one of the first startups to join in that program did kind of a token conversion deal for link versus BlB. The link is generally used for services that we use in the context of the protocol. And yeah, they ended up kind of one of the larger cap table orders after that deal was made and was kind of right in the pit of the bear market.
00:09:53.818 - 00:10:07.806, Speaker A: Right. So it was a big signal for other investors that I think helped us eventually raise the rest of the rounds. And we haven't announced it yet. We're actually in the very final stages of doing a bit of a bigger raise right now.
00:10:07.908 - 00:10:37.046, Speaker B: We'll announce preshow Slater. I'd love to compare and contrast blueberry with other money markets, because that is one of the core pieces that allows blueberry to potentially be this defi prime brokerage. So maybe you could just tell us a little bit about what differentiates blueberry and most importantly, how it would differ from an over collateralized lending borrowing market like Ave, for sure.
00:10:37.148 - 00:11:33.130, Speaker A: So I want to start at the high level here, just kind of talk about how normal tradfi loans work, especially in the context of a prime brokerage. But in tradfi, right, pretty much every loan issued, regardless of whether it's collateralized or based on credit, the lender understands what the borrower is going to do with the money, right? So in over collateralized money markets, in defi, it's completely permissionless, and the loan is custodial, meaning you get the money and then you choose whatever you want to do with the money, and you're no longer interacting with the protocol that you borrowed from. Right. You're just doing whatever with the money that you borrowed. So if that's the case, as the lender, you basically have to assume that the user is going to do the worst possible thing with that money. That's going to create the most risk to your protocol, and you have to design the risk parameters accordingly. So generally, that's why for major assets that are super liquid, the LTVs can be pushed to like 80 or sometimes even 90%.
00:11:33.130 - 00:12:16.934, Speaker A: But for most kind of volatile altcoins, et cetera, they're going to be much lower, 20, 30%. And you're sacrificing a lot of capital efficiency in exchange for the user freedom to do whatever they want. So the way a tradfi loan would work, right, let's say it's a mortgage, you understand the money is going to be used to purchase a home. Person is going to live in that home, and then also if they do not pay their debts as the lender, you can claim the actual thing they bought position. If you're making an analogy of blueberry, to repay the debt, you could go sell the position that they purchased. Right. So while you did lend the money, you know where the money's going, and you can ultimately reclaim the thing that they use the money for.
00:12:16.934 - 00:12:37.434, Speaker A: So that's a pretty good analogy for how blueberry works. We have all these integrations of things that you can do in DFI. Maybe that's just purchasing way more ethereum than you already had. Maybe that's leverage farming on curve. Maybe that's leverage farming. Uniswap B, three, concentrated liquidity position. Really anything that is involved in the DFI landscape.
00:12:37.434 - 00:13:25.754, Speaker A: So blueberry attaches a money market to those deployments. So when you borrow funds, blueberry knows where the money is going and can assign the correct risk parameters for that borrowing intent. And by doing that, can really push up the capital efficiency. But it's deployment dependent. Right? So let's say you want to do something delta neutral, where you're borrowing ETH, say, and buying wrap staked Ethereum, one of the most popular trades, which maybe that'll turn into restaked Ethereum in the next year. Right, which will be the new trade. But that's a delta neutral trade, right? And of course, there is some price risk for the liquid staking token, but it's a much lower volatility trade than if you were just borrowing against your ETH to go purchase more ETH.
00:13:25.754 - 00:13:58.598, Speaker A: Right. And lever long, that's going to be way more volatile relative to your collateral than a delta neutral trade. So in the delta neutral scenario, you could borrow 20 x on blueberry, but in the volatile scenario, maybe it's going to be six or ten x no matter what. You get liquidated at the same thresholds if you lose 90 or 85% of your collateral value. But we can just really push up the amount that you can borrow based on that intention and offer much better terms for both lenders and borrowers as a result of the infrastructure. I always get a little bit pie in the sky there. I.
00:13:58.598 - 00:14:07.146, Speaker A: Hopefully that makes sense and I didn't use too many annoying finance words, but the point is that you can borrow a lot more because we know where the money is going at the risk engine.
00:14:07.328 - 00:14:18.030, Speaker E: You answered my next question. I was just going to ask, how does blueberry allow for so much leverage in the system? But you just kind of summed it up at the end there.
00:14:18.180 - 00:14:55.718, Speaker A: I could give a more direct answer to the actual tech stack that we use. So the piece of tech that enables this is called a position NFT. So we want to be non custodial, right, where there's no centralized entity. Blueberry is just a set of smart contracts, right? So there's no entity that you're giving your money in collateral to, or that's holding your trade for you that could go bankrupt, for example. Instead, it's all just held in position nfts. So when you create a position, you deposit your collateral asset, you borrow your debt, and then you use the debt for whatever your deployment is. And all three components are wrapped into an NFT that is noncustodial.
00:14:55.718 - 00:15:35.394, Speaker A: But also, you can't take the money and run, right? It's locked in that NFT. That NFT can only be transferred when the position is liquidated. So if you lose 90% of your collateral value as a stable collateral or 85% of your collateral value as a volatile collateral, the position is automatically sent to liquidation, and a liquidator can basically repay that NFT's debt and take their collateral and the deployment, sell it, and make a small profit. In general, we keep those terms super low. Not to go on a tangent, but the liquidation is much more favorable to the borrowing user than other money markets might be, because we just want to create the best experience possible for the traders.
00:15:35.442 - 00:16:05.594, Speaker B: On that, I want to walk through the three key roles here, which I think is like lenders, strategists, and liquidators. But given that we're talking about risk and how you offer that much more leverage, maybe we should just briefly talk about how do you manage risk as you add new assets? Like, how will the protocol continue to add new assets that we can borrow in these different levered up defi strategies?
00:16:05.722 - 00:17:16.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really great question. And there's kind of two approaches, right? There's like the Rari approach, which is like, just let users do whatever they want, kind of create a sandbox, and people can take their own risks, make their own risk parameters, and then there's like, the Abe approach, like almost like a managed fund, right? We're much closer to the Abe approach. I love decentralization, and I'd love to release like a V two sandbox version eventually. But in general, I think the right approach and the approach that we took is kind of like a democratic republic, right, rather than a full on democracy at everybody trying to make every single decision around every parameter, delegating that role to someone with expertise. So we partner with Gauntlet, who also does parameters for Abe, and compound a lot of the major money market players. They kind of created a custom risk engine that understands kind of what I just talked about of the collateral asset, debt asset and position that you're creating, and the relationship between the three, the volatility and liquidity profiles of all the assets in the middle, and then spits out the correct risk parameter for that exact trade. So they were really instrumental in making this all possible.
00:17:16.518 - 00:18:23.210, Speaker A: And at the moment, the way the approval process works for adding new assets will be through governance. So the BLB token is not live until the lockdrop is over. So it's around March 25, the TGE will occur, and at that point, we will transition to dow governance fairly shortly after. The parameters will still just be done by Gauntlet for a while, at least for the first year, but for adding on different collateral assets or strategies into the protocol that will go through classic governance process. And then basically it will get gauntlet stamp of approval and the correct parameters with which to manage that new strategy and collateral asset that was added. And so I would love to do that with all facets of the protocol over time, right? Like, if we could almost create a committee of community members that really understand where the trends are going and what things should be added next. I would love to do that as well, but yeah, it's like every deFi protocol, especially because we're so specialized on offering the most leverage possible, kind of has to start in a more centralized, delegated manner to a specific group, and then over time become more and more decentralized, more and more decision makers involved.
00:18:23.370 - 00:18:40.558, Speaker E: Within that process of onboarding new assets. We were talking a little bit about this before, but what sort of prerequisites are needed to onboard a new asset? Like does it have to have a chain link oracle? Can it be just something on uniswap or what goes into what can be allowed?
00:18:40.654 - 00:19:28.482, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is something I think is really at the core of the value prop for blueberry, which is, it's a generalized engine for specific parameters, for specific trades and assets. Right? So the goal is to make it truly something that can work with anything. Right? And this is the benefit of having a position based, risk isolated system versus an account based system. Like let's say your design, your risk model is a ten X leverage account. Basically you have to choose all these assets that definitely have chain link oracles and are super liquid, and everything can work with that ten X leverage maximum. And you're really constraining your majors to the more mid caps that you're also including. You're kind of making a compromise on everything to make it work at that account based risk level.
00:19:28.482 - 00:20:10.874, Speaker A: With blueberry, everything is by the individual trade, so therefore we can truly support anything. Now, of course, it does need to have a price, and it also needs to make sense for the protocol. Like there has to be a certain amount of TbL. Generally you're looking things, looking for things with at least $20 to $50 million of Tbl to support as strategies, generally over 100 to start, and then as collateral assets. It's probably going to need to be in the hundreds of millions of market cap for it to really be valuable. Right. Because blueberry can't be 100% of the market cap of something, there's going to be a limitation from gauntlet on the percent of the total liquidity or market cap for that asset that can be listed.
00:20:10.874 - 00:20:56.206, Speaker A: So from a business perspective, it has to make sense for the Dow, of course. But if there's a new thing where, let's say the only price source is a Uniswap B, three, oracle right now, like it was just launched, or even a UDP, two, oracle or a curve pool, we can support those custom deployments, we just have to integrate it. And we've done a lot of work to be able to understand and price those things in a pretty modular way that can be expanded very quickly. So we still have to do the integration, but it really can work with pretty much anything. And let's say it's a pretty illiquid meme coin. The parameters will just be much lower, right? Your max leverage will just be two x instead of 20 x, or maybe even 1.5 x instead of 20 x, and your max position size will maybe be 25 grand, right, instead of $2.5
00:20:56.206 - 00:21:04.866, Speaker A: million. It all just adjusts based on the specifics of the assets involved. But is modular to work with anything, and that's kind of the idea behind it all.
00:21:04.968 - 00:22:11.880, Speaker F: Maverick protocol provides innovative liquidity solutions for token projects to customize, automate, and incentivize their liquidity with the highest efficiency in DeFi, all powered by Maverick Amm why has Maverick become the first choice for all kinds of token projects, from stablecoins to LRTs as the first dynamic distribution? Amm Maverick Amm provides automated liquidity movement modes, which move your liquidity to follow price, keeping it where it does the most good. This enables maverick powered pools to process higher volume with lower TVL requirements, and means that Maverick supports the highest capital efficiency for LRTs. Like we ETH, Maverick AMm also supports non uniform liquidity distributions, making it easy to concentrate liquidity in shapes that fit each project's individual needs. Finally, Maverick boosted positions maximize incentive efficiency for protocols looking to bootstrap their token liquidity to precise strategic areas of a liquidity pool. Token communities like Lido Ave swell Ethify and Kelp Dao have been bootstrapping TVL and maintaining peg using Maverick tools ready to build liquidity with maximal efficiency.

00:22:15.530 - 00:22:39.498, Speaker E: Slater just getting back to those kind of three types of participants on blueberry, I feel like we might have walked through a couple of them, or maybe all of them, but it's lenders, strategists, and liquidators. Anything more you'd like to add on? Just kind of maybe the strategists actually, and maybe you could actually just speak to more of the strategies that you expect people to be doing on the protocol.
00:22:39.594 - 00:23:24.362, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So the major kind of strategies will be things on like convex and aura, both on top of curb and balancer, as well as liquid staking tokens and then soon to be restaking tokens and then pendle principal and yield tokens as well. But yeah, there's a lot of new stuff going on in the liquid staking world, right, in the restaking worlds. I think it's going to be a real boon for leveraged farming in general. And so that's going to be a major focus area for a while. One thing that we're really excited about is adding on APX ETH, which is the new redacted cartel de Niro liquid staking token. And that one's paying about 8.8%
00:23:24.362 - 00:24:02.858, Speaker A: yield right now. And basically their model, actually, I don't want to spend too much time, but they have a pretty cool model for making yield that scales. It's kind of their motto behind it. So, for example, I think that'll be a massively popular trade, just borrowing ETH on blueberry and then purchasing APX ETH and just taking that spread. It's delta neutral, so you could lever that up 20 X. This won't be ready right away, but Pendle, I don't know if you guys have seen this, but there's all sorts of airdrop hype around restaking tokens and the restaking protocols that are facilitating restaking. And so there's two airdrops that are coming, right? There's the IGA layer airdrop we're speculating on.
00:24:02.858 - 00:25:09.562, Speaker A: Then also the middleware that are kind of like the lidos of restaking, right? That will also have their own airdrops. So basically, users are speculating that those airdrops are going to be so big, they're minting principal and yield tokens on Pendle, and they're selling their principal tokens to lever up on the yield tokens because that qualifies them for the airdrop. So what this has created is a massive discount on the principal tokens, where I think Etherfi ETH has like $100 million in TVL, maybe more now since the last time I checked. And it's trading at an 11% discount, and it redeems in five months. And so if you annualize that as an APR, it's like 32% fixed APR, and your risk is really just a smart contract risk of ether Phi, which I think is pretty trustworthy. So that's a trade we're going to offer on blueberry. I'm not sure if it's going to be ten x or 20 x yet, but just borrow ETH at maybe 6% or 7% if the market is pretty damn utilized on blueberry and use that to purchase these hendle principal tokens.
00:25:09.562 - 00:25:43.994, Speaker A: And so let's say it's at ten x leverage borrowing is at 7% and the discount is 30% APR. That means you're literally going to make a 23% spread times tax leverage. 230% fixed APR on ethereum is just insane. And the cool thing about blueberry is we can add that stuff super fast, right? As these opportunities continue to pop up, we can make those arbitrages possible. So I think that's going to be a big focus area and just liquid restaking tokens themselves as the airdrop phenomenon starts to play out.
00:25:44.032 - 00:26:28.070, Speaker B: I mean, if blueberry is successful in this also, I think you will probably pull down that principal token yield. We've actually got a number of episodes that folks should go back to. One's on ether Phi, which is the most dominant liquid restaking token. I think that pendle market two Slater, that's like now like 150,000,000 or something like that. What's really wild about that too, is all the different leverage strategies that you could imagine now through blueberry. I think the one you just called out is probably the one the market urgently needs the most. Here we have blueberry launching, and if this works again as designed and intended, there's a lot of demand for leverage there.
00:26:28.070 - 00:26:47.790, Speaker B: So anyways, just all the light bulbs are going off in my head, I'm like, oh my gosh, yeah. If you guys enable that, that would allow me then to LP with more ETH. And that's actually what I want to do, because the yield token strategy is a trade, and I'm not willing to dump ether for that yield token.
00:26:48.690 - 00:26:57.986, Speaker A: I don't think we're going to support the yield tokens at the moment, but I can't believe people aren't buying up the principal tokens, honestly, I just hope the opportunity stays around.
00:26:58.088 - 00:27:09.778, Speaker E: So, Slater, you launched the protocol just recently, and there's something happening right now called a lockdrop. Can you just fill in listeners what that is and how they can take part in this?
00:27:09.864 - 00:28:00.658, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, a few disclaimers too. I just want to make sure we're protecting users that it's a brand new protocol. We were audited multiple times through a number of reputable firms, but in general, the smart contract risk for a new protocol is the highest at the beginning, right? And so basically the lockdrop is a way to compensate liquidity providers for taking that early protocol risk, and basically is distributing a significant portion of the token supply to those liquidity providers. It's going to be 5% of the total BLB supply in the first two months and then there will be an additional community distribution kind of airdrop style for both lenders and borrowers, basically everybody that use the protocol and social supporters, Galaxy campaign, et cetera. But yeah, the lockdrop is pretty straightforward. Right now all there is to do is just lend assets.
00:28:00.658 - 00:28:46.606, Speaker A: There's actually eleven supported markets at the moment. So it's all the kind of major stuff that you'd recommend or that you'd be used to seeing on money markets as well as some more unique ones like CRV, USD, CRB itself, balancer token, ALCX token, the OHM token link as well, and a number of others will be added pretty soon here. But yeah, so the lockdrop is straightforward. All you do is lend assets single sided and you earn that BDBLB reward. And I think we should probably get into what BDBLB is as well. I'll get into that in a second. But yeah, it's basically a way to distribute the governance power to the early community members who are taking the risk by providing liquidity to the protocol.
00:28:46.606 - 00:28:52.370, Speaker A: Then borrowers will be able to borrow from those markets starting next week and start doing the leveraged strategies.
00:28:52.450 - 00:29:01.994, Speaker E: Awesome. Yeah, I think that'd be a great segue if you just want to maybe explain more about the token that you just mentioned and maybe how it'll work within blueberry for sure.
00:29:02.112 - 00:30:23.282, Speaker A: So BLB is a pretty traditional governance token, makes all the decisions around what to add to the protocol, et cetera, and what to do with the Dow treasury, the revenues that it earns. And BDBLB is our kind of unique twist on incentive tokens where there have been a few kind of experiments trying to make tokens like options olit and OTAP. There's a few different models out there. And the idea is that a lot of Defi tokens fell into this trap where they just give out their tokens to liquidity providers as APR and they would just get sold and the token would go down and that would often cause the demise of the community. So we wanted to create a system that rewards people who are truly there to early governance power and use it right and disincentivize those kind of mercenary liquidity providers that are just dumping tokens over and over. So the way BDBLB works, it's called bonded blueberry, is you get it at the end of each two week epoch, it automatically starts vesting for a one year period. However, you can immediately accelerate it and claim the underlying BLB by paying a 50% early unlock fee and that fee is actually what vests over the one year.
00:30:23.282 - 00:30:51.482, Speaker A: So from zero days to one year, it will go down from 50% to zero. And the other kind of fun twist. So, like, if you want to instantly access liquidity, sell your tokens, do whatever you can, do that. You pay the fee. And when you pay the fee, it's actually paid into the dow to accelerate it. And those funds are mostly used to create protocol owned liquidity and kind of create that depth of liquidity. So you don't need to constantly pay incentives to sustain the token market.
00:30:51.482 - 00:31:32.662, Speaker A: Right. Eventually, it can just all be dow owned liquidity that supports the market, and you can remove the need for incentives. The other cool part is half the fee is actually just a redistribution. So the holders who got their BDBLB and chose not to accelerate gain 25% of the tokens from people who did choose to accelerate. So if you decide to wait your vesting period, your goal is to accumulate BLB and participate in governance. You'll actually earn more BLB just by vesting from the people who chose to accelerate early and sell. So it's kind of a way to reward for long term community members and disincentivize the mercenary liquidity providers while also building protocol liquidity.
00:31:32.726 - 00:31:59.070, Speaker B: Slater, I think this is a great place for us to start to wrap the conversation. So I want to first remind our listeners that they should learn more by going to blueberry. Gon all the details there around the lockdrop that we referenced. You'll find all the information you need there. I would also recommend checking out their docs if you want to learn more about the mechanics of the protocol. And then you should follow Blueberry FDN. It stands for Blueberry foundation.
00:31:59.070 - 00:32:35.882, Speaker B: That's the mothership account. And then you should also follow Slater. It's just his first and last name. And we'll put all of that into our show notes so you can easily reference that. And then, Slater, just thanks so much for talking us through all the exciting details around this new protocol. The idea of, like, a Defi prime brokerage, it's come up so much over the years, and I want to say, really, no one has succeeded, I think, in bringing to market yet a true defi prime brokerage. So we're definitely rooting you guys on and excited to see how this develops.
00:32:35.882 - 00:32:43.438, Speaker B: That said, any final word for folks that want to get involved in the protocol or any last bit of alpha you'd like to tease us with?
00:32:43.524 - 00:33:26.462, Speaker A: First of all, thanks for the kind words. We're excited, too, but yeah, probably the best bit of alpha I already talked about a little bit, but definitely go check out the lockdrop. Again, disclaimers not available to us users or a number of restricted jurisdictions. But if you're a defi power user, you're in allowed jurisdiction and you understand the risks behind these defi protocols, we definitely recommend you go and check out the lend page. It's just app blueberry garden slash lend. There's a lockdrop page that kind of explains the details of the lockdrop, why the incentives are being directed, et cetera. And right now, as it stands, a number of the APRs there are still well in the hundreds of percent.
00:33:26.462 - 00:33:55.414, Speaker A: A few million dollars in TVL in there launched about 48 hours ago, and so still time to be early for sure. And yeah, we'd love for people to participate. That is probably my best tip at the moment, and I mentioned some of the strategies we'll be adding in the future. That's probably the best alpha I can give, and we'll keep pushing updates. The other thing I'll say is, if you have some alpha, we're an engine for making trades possible for defi power users, so let us know what you want to see. We'd love to hear.
00:33:55.532 - 00:34:08.550, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at fourthrevolution capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
