00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.370, Speaker A: Hey everyone, this is Defi dad. I'm here at ETH Denver with Stani Kulichev from Aave. How are zk rollups impacting the development of new products with Aave?
00:00:09.450 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker B: So yeah, zk roll ups are a way to actually get the scalability into wider adoption. And what's interesting is that now besides finance, we have non financial use cases and that's where ZK comes into place.
00:00:24.420 - 00:00:28.818, Speaker A: So what is the alpha on the new products that we can expect from Aave?
00:00:28.994 - 00:00:41.302, Speaker B: As Ave we're known as a team of builders and we are constantly building new things and recently we've been working on the go stablecoin and it's already on Testnet so you can actually mint girly testnet go.
00:00:41.436 - 00:00:43.970, Speaker A: Any news to report on lens?
00:00:44.050 - 00:00:57.740, Speaker B: Yes there is. We actually have a meetup coming up in San Francisco so if you're around the next week just come. And also if you don't have a lens profile yet, share me your polygon address and I will hook you up.
