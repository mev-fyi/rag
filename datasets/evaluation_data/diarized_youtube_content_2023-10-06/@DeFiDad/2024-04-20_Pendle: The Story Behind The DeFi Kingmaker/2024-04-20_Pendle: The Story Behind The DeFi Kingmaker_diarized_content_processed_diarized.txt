00:00:00.480 - 00:00:53.744, Speaker A: It's been really surreal because I I think our team never imagined that points trading could be a product market fit for Pendle. But looking back in retrospect, the the strategy we adopted has not changed, but the narrative and people's attention has change quite drastically. I think points is going to become a very constant fixture in a project that is going to launch a token. So points implementation will be a pre TGE activity. It's proven to be an effective means for a lot of these projects to earn early traction, which can help them secure a better valuation when they do a TgE.
00:00:56.684 - 00:01:44.542, Speaker B: Welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad here with nomatic from four rc. Today's show spotlights Pendle, the most popular app in Defi for farming, points trading yield and lending at fixed rates. In this episode, we catch up with the co founder of Pendle TN, Lee on how they found product market fit with airdrop farmers. Their aggressive growth strategy for selecting protocols and assets to listen and to whats next with Eigen lair now live and Pendle V three in development. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible. Introducing flat money, the first decentralized delta neutral flatcoin built on base with sustainable yield thats completely untethered from legacy finance.
00:01:44.542 - 00:02:20.484, Speaker B: Because Defi needs an uncensorable base unit of currency, you can mint unit with Reth, which is held in the protocols shared liquid liquidity pool where it's borrowed by leveraged traders. As a leveraged trader, you can deposit your margin collateral and go long on re. If you're trading in the perpetual futures market, you'll pay unitholders to open leverage positions. If you're holding unit, you'll earn yield from liquidations, borrow rate and trading fees, preserve your purchasing power and offset your exposure to crypto market volatility. Learn more at flat money restaking summer.
00:02:20.524 - 00:03:21.726, Speaker C: Is dawning and swell is expanding. Harnessing the power of R suite, swell is building the L2 for liquid restaking. That means native restaking yield on a chain built with Polygon's Zkevm technology in collaboration with Alt layer Chainlink and Eigen Da. Look out for swells. Layer two in swell City introducing the mantle liquid staking protocol mantle LSP, a permissionless, non custodial ETH liquid staking protocol deployed on Ethereum l one and governed by mantle. With mantle LSP, users can stake ETH to instantly receive me, earn yield, and accumulate rewards. The longer you stake meth is the value accumulating receipt token that will give you access to expanded yield opportunities.
00:03:21.726 - 00:03:25.194, Speaker C: Stake and watch your yield grow with mantle LSP.
00:03:25.494 - 00:04:06.804, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blockers standing in the way of crypto crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain ux. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas. One gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadapp's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:07.514 - 00:04:13.530, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce Tien Lee, the co founder of Pendle. Tien, welcome back to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:13.682 - 00:04:15.162, Speaker A: I'm good. Thanks for having me.
00:04:15.258 - 00:04:56.404, Speaker B: So last summer we spoke with you and had you on the podcast. And I remember at the time, Pendle was growing rapidly. It was still uncertain whether we had exited the bear market. So much has changed since then, and that's what this podcast is about today. I think that Pendle is probably one of the most well understood Cinderella stories in Defi. The product market fit you have has users like nomadic and I checking Pendle multiple times a day. A part of that is because you've almost become like a hub of yield trading speculation, fixed yield.
00:04:56.404 - 00:05:42.944, Speaker B: There's so many different players in this, but if you have a yield bearing token and if you have a point system and you want to be able to speculate on either of those, or to be able to trade those, or to, again, take advantage of the fixed yields that have come out of all of the yield trading on Pendle. I mean, it's just a defi heaven for all of us. So I think we would love to kick off with maybe just more about your thoughts. What has happened since going from 150 million total value locked to something like 4.7 billion today, can you give just some reflection on all that's happened since then?
00:05:43.104 - 00:07:05.382, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's been really surreal because I think our team never imagined that points trading could be a product market fit for Pendle. But looking back in retrospect, the strategy we adopted has not changed, but the narrative and people's attention has changed quite drastically. So again, like last year, it was, I guess, like it was just a bear market. So the appetite for taking on something like yield trading wasn't really there. And then compared to this year, there's a lot more liquidity, and then the willingness to take risk through various instruments has increased quite drastically. Now, again, like just again, in retrospect, I think some of the things that we've done well since panel V two launched in November 2022, was capturing the narrative. So we've been quite successful and also very fortunate to be able to latch on to some of these major narratives and then construct use cases that we could exemplify the values and the proposition of Pendle.
00:07:05.382 - 00:07:52.038, Speaker A: The first one was really in January last year, when we launch markets for LST assets, Steve Reth and a couple of others. And then we also went to Arbitrum. And as arbitrum grew, we also grew alongside arbitrum. And then now we become a lot more synonymous with some of these products. And then in Q three, we also pivoted a little bit to try to capture the. The RWA narrative. So we work with Flux Ondoflux, we work with Spark and Phrax to try to allow users to trade the yield that these products were offering.
00:07:52.038 - 00:08:23.716, Speaker A: And then fast forward earlier part of this year, we were very aggressive in restaking because we thought Eigen layer is. Was popularizing points trading. And then with LRT protocols, they were building on Eigen layer, also offering their point system. It was, um. It was a good time for us to. To write our own stories. But if I were to take a step back, right, looking at re staking segment here, it's actually not something new for us.
00:08:23.716 - 00:09:21.174, Speaker A: Uh, when we were supporting. When we. When we supported an asset last year in swell, they were actually offering Perl, which is effectively some sort of a point system. But Eigen layer brought points trading, like points offering, to another level. And so, because of the experience that we had from working with swell and offering Perl to users, we had experience incorporating points trading to our venue. So when points trading really happened, we were able to respond quite quickly. So, by now, if my memory serves me right, we are funneling approximately 40% to 45% of TVL to several of the major LRT projects.
00:09:21.174 - 00:10:22.634, Speaker A: And then we've also started exploring opportunities outside of the LRT segment in ithena and also circuit. So Ithena is actually a very, very synergistic implementation for us as well, because Etina is very, very strong in the business development, and they were able to cultivate a lot of interest around their community. So when we enabled yield trading, sorry, points trading on shards, the market picked up much better than we expected. So we filled up the 100 million capacity in matters of hours, and then we had to raise it two more times. We also launched several other markets subsequently, and we continue to work very closely with Athena. Yeah. So there's a lot that I think we can look forward to.
00:10:22.634 - 00:11:08.666, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think in retrospect, if you ask me about the state of mind at the moment, I think hitting the first billion dollars in TBL is very, very surreal. We've come a long way, right. Because last we chatted, we were around 150. So growing to a billion dollar in TVL was almost like a dream come true. And then beyond that, it forces us to change the way we think about our approach, because right now we are $4.7 billion. If we want to continue to rake in another billion dollar, we, we might have to strategize a little differently.
00:11:08.666 - 00:11:36.300, Speaker A: So really do things that matter and then focus on assets that can give us that kind of traction. So this is just one aspect of it. Right. But I think, you know, culturally and in terms of mindset, we have to see things very differently now, but at the same time, stay humble and stay grounded, be very aggressive in trying to capture all these different market opportunities that we see.
00:11:36.372 - 00:12:21.624, Speaker E: Yeah, thats a great answer. And just congrats on all the success youve had. Its very well earned, and ive been a small and eager participant in all of it. I also didnt realize that it was swell that kicked off some of this early on with the Pearls campaign. I was under the assumption that it was Etherfi because that's kind of when I saw the hockey stick moment of TVL on Pendle. That first Aetherfy pool just gained so much traction, and it was kind of just so synergistic for both Aetherfi and Pendle. Like that growth in that moment, I think it was kind of like January of this year.
00:12:21.624 - 00:12:57.204, Speaker E: I want to kind of just ask you, tien your perspective on the state of this points farming meta where do you think we are right now? Where do you think it's going? And then how dependent is it on where we are in a cycle, too? I'm wondering where some of this goes. If you talked about attention earlier, if attention wanes or if we go into another bear market cycle, just kind of just speak to that if you can.
00:12:57.544 - 00:14:08.430, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think points is becoming quite, it's going to become a very constant fixture in a project that is going to launch a token. So points point's implementation will be a pre TgE activity. And I think it's proven to be an effective means for a lot of these projects to earn early traction, which can help them secure a better valuation when they do a TGE. Now, because we've seen a couple of cases. So Etherfi being the first one. Ether also has done very well in terms of the secondary market. And I think what we have supported in terms of the entire development is really helped them acquire liquidity and a market for users to express views.
00:14:08.430 - 00:14:51.900, Speaker A: So, moving forward, I think points trading is not going away. It was popularized, it's been around, but it's popularized by eigen layer and the fellow LRT products. And then we saw Itina made a very successful implementation of their own. Now we're also working with circuit to just enable points trading. So circuit is an l two to be, and their main net is scheduled some months after. But between now and then, there is a window that they could. There's a window of opportunity for them to acquire early traction before they do mainnet and subsequently TGE.
00:14:51.900 - 00:16:01.294, Speaker A: So where it's interesting for users is that they can have an early participation in some of these opportunities. And then for users who want to obtain fixed yield on assets that circuit accepts, they can do so on pendle as well. So now Xurkit is a little over a billion dollars in TBL. And this has become a pretty good case study for us, that for us internally, to see how we can value add to subsequent launches for other protocols and potentially introducing it to other l two s to be or some other protocols that are launching later this year. I think the. Basically, I think the more we do and repeat this, I think we will become more synonymous with points trading, and then hopefully, we become the default destination for launches and points trading.
00:16:01.724 - 00:16:57.424, Speaker B: Yeah, some of the use cases here that I want to just clarify for anyone who's newer to pendle, if they're listening to this and they're trying to play catch up, we've got the YT tokens, which have rights in, I think, in all cases on Pendle, and it's probably likely to continue this way. They have rights to points and yield, and the yield was always interesting, and that was like the foundation of the design behind Pendle, that you could basically tokenize the yield and the principle of a yield bearing token. But the points, once that came into play, and I think you pointed out Eigen Lair, really let that on fire. Then you've got Etherfi, where we see the hockey stick growth. Then you've got Renzo. That follows. We've got puffer, we've got kelp, we've got all the different LRT protocols.
00:16:57.424 - 00:17:45.364, Speaker B: Feels like LRTs were such an important catalyst to all of this, but it has more to do with. There was a demand for folks to want to participate in these points programs. And I know part of the reason I have bought YT's myself is I don't have the amount of ETH that I would be willing to risk just by participating in the LRT. But when I know that I can buy these, like, I kind of refer to them as like lotto tickets. It's like a ticket to ride in the points program. It's just cool. It's like I'm buying a super discounted ticket to play in the points program, knowing that the YT will eventually go to zero.
00:17:45.364 - 00:18:40.632, Speaker B: Meanwhile, because the pts and the YT's are inversely related, their price as the YT tokens have been hugely in demand. So they're in demand, they're going up in price. The PT token, this like discounted version of the principal, like a zero coupon bond, that token now is decreasing in price. So suddenly I'm looking at ETH and I'm going, whoa, I could buy a derivative here of ETH that is 2030, 40 50% discounted. And I know I'm going to lock in that yield fixed by the maturity date. I've got the ability to be an LP and play both sides of it. You mentioned with Athena, I feel like the real aha moment for all of us was, hey, this does work really well with stablecoins.
00:18:40.632 - 00:19:28.480, Speaker B: We all lost track of the fact that we were playing the LRT game, which requires that were exposed to an underlying volatile sort of asset there. And with stablecoins, it feels that much easier to look at it and say, wait a sec, so I could earn 200% fixed on stablecoins. And so its just remarkable the way that pendle coordinates extremely different profiles of defi users, speculators in the YT token, lenders in the PT LP's who want to play both. And it's just got this beautiful, beautiful sort of like synergy between all these different players.
00:19:28.672 - 00:19:57.096, Speaker A: Wow, that's a really, really good explanation. Much better than I could have done. But I want to substantiate a little bit. Right. I think in my view, there are mostly three types of play here. It's by YT, buypt or LP. Everything, everyone here, no matter, no matter which clan you belong to, there's something.
00:19:57.096 - 00:20:38.926, Speaker A: And like you get, everybody is a winner. Because yt, you're speculating, you're bullish on the project token. So go all in YT with some form of implied leverage. And then I remember for USD specifically, the leverage was as high as 200 times. So every $1 you put in, you're getting 200 times the points exposure. And then for most of the LRT assets, it's around ten to eleven times, which is fairly significant. And then for PT, because of the demand for Yt, we're looking at 100% for USDe.
00:20:38.926 - 00:21:42.976, Speaker A: And then for most of the LRT assets, it's 60% to 65% fixed APY. And just this morning, there was 1000 ETH purchase. Sorry, 10,000 ETH purchase in Renzo, easy ETH Pt. So that is, I think, probably the largest single transaction that we've seen anywhere on Pendle. And they're locking in 60% fixed APY. And then for LP, if you're trying to play safe, you could gain the yield LP APY, which is approximately 60, 70% for most of the pools and still get exposure to the points. So it's been, I think, a fairly fascinating play to see how people make decision, because I do have friends who come to me and ask, like, what should I do? PT is very attractive, but YT is also giving the relatively obscene upside.
00:21:43.160 - 00:22:37.194, Speaker E: Tien. I want to just quickly go back to something you were saying about, like, I actually tweeted about this yesterday when I was kind of thinking about this podcast and just thinking about Pendle. I think it was something like, is Pendle becoming more important to a project than getting a tier one exchange listing? And I think it's kind of like a cheeky tweet, but I think it's more like one kind of leads into the other. You know what I mean? You kind of said it before. Pendle can provide such early traction for a protocol to then have a tier one exchange, have that listing process go smoother and easier because they're looking for traction. Like a big exchange wants to list something that they know is going to be a winner. And if Pendle can give that early, pre token traction, that's so hard to get.
00:22:37.194 - 00:23:07.694, Speaker E: It leads into that exchange listing. And I guess so that kind of leads me into my next question, which is like, okay, I'm sure you're getting absolutely slammed and blown up by teams wanting on Pendle. A I'm just curious how you're handling that if you're, you know, need more employees or whatever. But I think my main question is, like, what is the selection criteria for you guys now? Because, to be honest, selfishly, I have port coast that I really want on Pendle, so I want to learn how to do it.
00:23:09.394 - 00:24:17.300, Speaker A: Yeah, let me think about it. Because so for Pendle, we've always been very, very like, we've always stayed very close to the market and see what makes sense. So in our case, we naturally have a view on how the market responds to a certain kind of narrative at this stage, because Eigen layer is, they just had a new announcement. So we think LRT assets will continue to have a lot of traction and will continue to gain a lot of momentum from various corners of Defi. This is just one perspective, but in terms of inbound, you're right, there's a lot more interest coming from many different segments across Defi, and sometimes not even Defi. It could be NFT related projects. Those are a little further out of our scope and domain.
00:24:17.300 - 00:25:43.244, Speaker A: So we mostly confine ourselves to Defi. But in terms of selection criteria, I think it's hard to point out at this point in time. It's mostly just looking at how the market and the community responds to a certain narrative. As an example, we have, like internally, our team is not very big, but we have an in house researcher who basically consumes Twitter and provide us an insight on a weekly basis. So, like, what are some of the assets that we should pay attention to? Because they have been mentioned a certain amount of times, and because they fit into the bucket of assets that we should be paying attention to, like for example, LRT assets or something that is similar to Athena and with maybe operating in a different ecosystem. So when we get this sort of report, we usually would speak with external parties just to validate the views. So, VC's hedge funds, because we have direct line and context with a lot of these individuals who are also looking at markets very, very rigorously, they can also provide feedback and validation as to whether an asset makes sense to us.
00:25:43.244 - 00:26:37.736, Speaker A: So from there, we try to shortlist. So on a weekly basis, we have a listing committee meeting to decide what assets to list. But of course, it also. So this is more like, I'd say like the market perspective, then we also have to balance our resources internally as well, because we are now trying to juggle growth of v two and development of v three. So in terms of growth of v two, because our resources are a lot more constrained. I mean, considering that we don't have like a super big headcount, we have to be very specific and deliberate in the kind of assets that we want to list. So assets that are already on arbitrum, ethereum, or any other chains that we have already implemented pendle on will be a lot easier for us.
00:26:37.736 - 00:27:58.444, Speaker A: And in terms of the cycle, usually after shortlisting the asset, we do a deeper dive into the contract just to make sure we are reasonably comfortable with, with what the team is doing. And then we would also form a direct line with the team to understand more about their roadmap so that we can sort out the maturity and the kind of range that we should set. And more importantly, I think it's really just to develop that relationship with the team, because when we launch a market, it's not just about putting a market out there, it's about try to cultivate interest in the market. So we just announced Tensorplex, but that relationship took a while and we think it is an interesting asset to list because it is so different from what we have listed so far. It is our first foray into AI related asset. These are just some decisions that we think about on a very frequent basis to try to establish a view. Now, not all of the markets will work out, but it's a matter of trying and experimenting with segments and assets.
00:27:58.444 - 00:28:39.504, Speaker A: And if one works out, it should be like, it will have an outsize impact. Yeah. But by and large, I think it's still, it's still pretty manual. When we establish a connection with the team, we have to also negotiate for multiplier, because now we're positioning pendle as a venue to gain initial traction. So we want as much proposition that we can extract from the issuer and pass on to the consumer. So panel does not charge any listing fee. Just to be clear, everything gets passed on to the user.
00:28:39.504 - 00:28:54.584, Speaker A: So all the two x multiplier, three x multiplier that whichever protocol is offering, that's directly from the protocol to the user, we're just operating as an intermediary for the price discovery of points to take place.
00:28:54.924 - 00:29:12.754, Speaker B: I have so many questions to ask, but I think the most obvious follow up here is you're currently on ethereum mainnet, you're on arbitrum, you're on mantle. Am I missing any there tien? Is there any other chains?
00:29:13.054 - 00:29:15.514, Speaker A: There's optimism and bnb chain.
00:29:15.814 - 00:29:44.100, Speaker B: What else goes into which chains you might go to next? I guess the one that's most top of mind for me is you're on l two s. Would you ever go to a bitcoin l two if it was EVM compatible? Like, do you have thoughts about moving to something like Solana where it's not EVM, but clearly has, like, it has. Your customer profile is definitely there on Solana.
00:29:44.212 - 00:30:11.264, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we get this question a lot. The short answer is we are very chain agnostic. So if there is a demand, regardless of what chain it is. We will try to fulfill it. But of course, we also have to prioritize in terms of. Because not all the chains operate the same way.
00:30:11.264 - 00:30:50.342, Speaker A: Some require different kind of programming language. Like, for example, Solana. We definitely have an interest in the ecosystem now as to when we can launch an implementation of v two over at Solana. That is something that we have to consider very seriously, but it's being looked at internally similarly for Cosmos as well. And then the move ecosystem, Aptos three. So these are all the possible options, but generally, we have it easier with EvM because we are. I mean, we started out on Ethereum.
00:30:50.342 - 00:31:36.790, Speaker A: We branched to l two s. So EvM, for us is a lot more straightforward because we know the language very intimately, and we know the quirks and ways to optimize it. Now, as for bitcoin. Bitcoin l two s, that's an interesting one. That is something that we are also studying quite intensely in the meantime, because we think that this year, there's a lot of conversations around bitcoin. I mean, considering, like, bitcoin just broke its previous all time high casually, and we're not even in the full bull mode. And with ETF's and so much, so much more interest in bitcoin asset itself, there's a lot of value there that is not very well utilized.
00:31:36.790 - 00:32:04.410, Speaker A: And bitcoin l two presents an opportunity for the. The bitcoin to generate even more apys for holders. We remain bullish in this particular segment, but we have to figure out the quirks and be comfortable with the technology before we do an implementation there.
00:32:04.482 - 00:32:23.630, Speaker E: Tien, I want to go back to something else you were saying. Just, your team has clearly been great at finding the new. The new big narrative. Um, I'm going to give a shout out to pendle intern, who has been one of my favorite followers on Twitter. I don't know who it is on the team. Maybe it's Utn. Don't tell me if it is.
00:32:23.630 - 00:32:45.906, Speaker E: Um, I want to keep the. The mystique alive, but, uh, yeah, it feels like you guys have just been on the ball. You've kind of known where the puck is going. So I would love to try to extract a little bit of alpha from you. Like, what. What are your researchers telling you? What's pendle, in turn, whispering into your ear? What's the next big thing that we should be paying attention to?
00:32:46.010 - 00:33:59.144, Speaker A: We are actually still very heavy in the restaking segment, so this is really fresh. So I don't have a lot of view there. We have to do a bit more studying. But what we have immediately after looking at the announcement this morning is now that there is an ABS already, how would it affect the various LRTs? My immediate reaction is that there's probably got to be some sort of reshuffling in terms of rankings and TVL, because most of the LRT protocols would likely have to do a new implementation of pool to accommodate and work with various ABS's. There are a lot of technical considerations there, and all these uncertainties are actually opportunities for speculation. So I think we will continue to be very, very involved in the LRC segment as more AV's show up. And then we are also looking into the l two s.
00:33:59.144 - 00:34:55.844, Speaker A: So, because right now there are so many different l two s, each of them are offering slightly different flavors, but there are some that we think have more unique offerings. Again, without naming names, most of them are probably a fork and super similar, but there are some that are maybe offering different ways for deposited assets to earn additional yield. And so naturally, there are apex. Their APY is going to be higher than some other, most other venues. And then we are also. Our venture into tensor plex is an attempt to be involved in the AI segment. Now, my understanding is that AI segment and a lot of these LRT ecosystems are pretty segregated.
00:34:55.844 - 00:35:37.870, Speaker A: There are probably a group of users who want to get exposure in AI assets, but are not super familiar with the blue chip assets like ETH or Solana. And we want to be able to see if we can assert some sort of involvement and presence within these communities. And after all, AI is a really big movement outside of crypto. So they would have some sort of peripheral influence within the crypto segment as well. But, yeah, I think in high level, these are just some directions that we are currently exploring.
00:35:37.982 - 00:36:31.692, Speaker B: So we're recording this the day after Eigen layer announced that Eigen DA is live on Mainnet. This has been a big catalyst for, you know, earning points for Eigen Lair, because the token itself is not live. So if you're listening to this in the future, there's no Eigen Lair token live just yet. And that has driven a lot of us to participate in lrts and then to participate in these pendle pools and earn Eigen points plus the LRT points. So, like, do you have any thoughts on, just, like, where we are with this going live? Like, a part of me was super excited. I'm very excited for Eigen Lair to go live and to work as designed. A part of me, my heart sank at hearing the news, because I was like, no, just push it out further.
00:36:31.692 - 00:37:07.010, Speaker B: Let us have this moment in time. I feel like this Eigen Lair run up, it's not the same as Defi Summer, but for me it's probably the second most exciting time I've experienced since like Defi summer. So like, I don't know if, if you have any thoughts on like, will we potentially see an Eigen Lair season two? Maybe the token itself doesn't go live actually for longer while the main net is live. So we can just, we can keep trading those yt's knowing that we're earning Eigen points. Any, any thoughts you can share?
00:37:07.122 - 00:38:22.338, Speaker A: I think a season two is actually quite likely. So again, like, Eigen Lair is an ambitious project and it, it has, to me, it has the potential to, to, to be, yeah, one of the most impactful things to happen to defi. So I think right now it's just like the real, like an early beginning of the lifecycle of Eigen layer. There's, Baynet is only the beginning. And I think from the perspective of Eigen layer, now that they have aggregated quite a lot of tbls, it is in their interest to protect as much as they can as they continue to roll out some of these implementations in accordance to their roadmap. So a lot of these things, a lot of these implementations will need time to realize. So being just mainnet in itself is not going to be a sufficient condition for say, the tokens to go live.
00:38:22.338 - 00:39:40.974, Speaker A: I think there's a lot that they have to prove with the tv out that they have aggregated. For example, now that the product is live, they need to find user, they need the demand there. And then subsequently, if they have more avss, how can they accommodate like the various types of demands? They have to consider the slashing components as well, and working with many different operators. So if I think it would be whatever they're doing right now in order to, and I think it would make the most sense for them to try to just focus on development and then not having to worry too much about the token launch and maybe do it at a much later stage is very logical focus on the tech. And when the product is sufficiently ready with very strong product market fit, then that would probably be the best time for TGE. But of course, like you said, in the meantime, now is still a good time for users to try to speculate on what the igalayer points could be worth in the future. I think we are providing a pretty healthy venue for that.
00:39:41.054 - 00:39:55.874, Speaker E: Tien, I'd love to ask you just your mindset on where you think Pendle is at as a protocol, is there things you're just itching to add to it and develop and iterate upon further? You mentioned v three earlier.
00:39:56.784 - 00:39:57.424, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe.
00:39:57.464 - 00:40:03.040, Speaker E: Anything you can share with the near to midterm roadmap of Pendle?
00:40:03.192 - 00:41:09.268, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So in the near term, we want to continue to be aggressive and very involved in enabling efficient points trading markets. So we continue to reach out to promising projects to work with and then launch new markets that users would be excited about. So I think I also shared earlier, like my view on points trading, I think it's going to be one of the more consistent fixtures in subsequent projects, especially prior to TGE, in order to gain early traction. So we can be a very good venue for projects to consider, as in order to gain that initial traction. So that is an angle that we want to concretize. We're still relatively new in this particular direction, but we hope to be able to work with more promising projects to make that more of a positioning for Pendle.
00:41:09.268 - 00:42:30.998, Speaker A: Now, in the meantime, we're also allocating resources to develop v three. So v three is not much is shared in the public yet, but to the extent that I can share, v three is going to be a scaled up version of yield trading, because now that we're seeing more traction on v two, we are also starting to observe some bottleneck in the panel amm. So basically, with the panel ammo, I mean, things work as intended. Now, the challenge comes when a user wants to trade in size. Let's say if they want to trade 50,000, $100,000 worth of YT, that that kind of size could incur one to 2% of price impact because liquidity might not be sufficient in the pool. So if a user has, let's say, ten, $20 million of position that they want to hedge on pendle, they would have to do it in many, many different clips and could potentially incur pretty significant price impact. So we want to eventually be able to allow users to trade in size, and we want to construct a product or an instrument that can accommodate that.
00:42:30.998 - 00:43:30.254, Speaker A: So V three, a lot of that is just allowing users to trade in size. And then we also like another, another bottleneck that we see with V three is that there is a chain dependency there. So, as an example, if we want to support assets that are currently trading on arbitrum, we have to first have an implementation of panel arbitram in order to list the asset. So I hope in the future we can be more agnostic wherever we deploy. It could be on the roll up, it could be any chain. Right. Doesn't matter where, but as long as there is, there is pendle, we hope to be able to enable yield trading of any kind across different ecosystems.
00:43:30.254 - 00:44:17.004, Speaker A: Yeah. So timeline wise, I think it's relatively fluid, but again, like, the best case is later part of this year. Yeah. So team is very excited about this. I think when. When we explored the use cases with market makers and traders, we could see how pendle V three could cater to the needs and demands of some of these institutional users. So we are now a lot more refined in terms of direction, and team is quite prepared to have a lot more sleepless nights just to crank out the new product.
00:44:17.784 - 00:45:15.392, Speaker B: Tien with V three, could you ever envision permissionless pool listing? Like, this is something that I've thought about, because I probably see this happening at some point in the future, but I really believe in your aggressive growth like, that. Strategic selection criteria is part of the magic that, like, it's so cool to learn that you have someone on staff that's full time devoted to just understanding the narratives, like what assets are being talked about. I think some other teams could really learn from that. Sometimes I've even heard some teams, like, discount what's being discussed on, like, a crypto, Twitter farcaster or whatever. I'm like, this is important that you understand what's interesting to us as users, and there's no better place to hear that dialogue. So, anyways, any thoughts on permissionless versus the current selection criteria?
00:45:15.568 - 00:46:03.904, Speaker A: So I think permissionless is more likely the end state of the v two implementation. Now, just. Just to be clear, V two and V three will coexist. So it's not either or. It's a coexistence, and they will very likely serve different use cases. So I think in regards to permissionless listing, I do see a future where we would enable permissionless listing of assets. And it's okay, v two, technically can already support permissionless listing, but we don't, or we don't have a UI UX for pool setup, because doing setting up a pool on Pendle is not as straightforward as uniswap.
00:46:03.904 - 00:46:42.816, Speaker A: For example, Uniswap is two assets in. You indicate the parameters, and then you're good to go with Pendle, there's a bit more steps there. So right now, just given the fact that I think we're still relatively new compared to some of these other primitives, there's still a lot more education that we need to inculcate before we think users are sufficiently ready to run things their way. So it's hard to give a specific timeline there, but that is actually the end state that we all want to achieve internally.
00:46:42.920 - 00:47:19.622, Speaker B: Tien, before we start to wrap up, there was a recent notice on the Pendle app. So if you are an LP in certain pools, I want to say it was maybe the Etherfi or swell pools that mature in June or July 2024. It just mentioned that you should migrate or consider migrating. I think there was better yield APY to earn as an LP. Can you explain the significance of why is there a migration option? And then is it an option?
00:47:19.718 - 00:47:20.598, Speaker E: Do we have to?
00:47:20.646 - 00:47:25.278, Speaker B: Or could LP's just stick in that pool while others migrate?
00:47:25.406 - 00:48:14.182, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. In short, nothing wrong with staying in the pool, but we encourage the migration. So one of the features of pedal v two amm is actually concentrated liquidity. So when we set up a pool, we have to indicate a range. So let's say 2% to 60% or 70% for the implied yield. This is where most of the assets, most of the liquidity is concentrated at. Now, in the event that the implied yield trades above the range, let's say 100%, the liquidity for implied yield at 100% is going to be very thin now.
00:48:14.182 - 00:49:48.192, Speaker A: So this is why a lot of users, when they are trying to trade past a certain amount, let's say even for a few thousand dollars, when the implied yield is trading above the upper limit, the transaction fails, because there just isn't enough liquidity in the far end to cater to this transaction. Now, when we were setting up polls in January or February, period, we did not anticipate that the market would go so aggressive into bidding for YT's. And as a result, we underestimated the demand for YT and resulted like, and caused some of the pools to be untradable. So we made the hard decision to encourage migration to a new pool that accommodates bigger range, so that users can go in and out much more freely without having to worry that there is no liquidity in the far end of the the spectrum to support the trade. Yeah, but again, I want to emphasize that there's nothing wrong to stay on in the original pool, but the original pool will no longer be accruing swap fees because we will be directing the swaps and the traits to the new pool. So users are highly encouraged to move, but if they don't move, they can still withdraw liquidity and maturity. Everything will be the same.
00:49:48.368 - 00:50:14.322, Speaker B: That definitely clarifies for me. I will definitely be migrating. Yeah, I want those swap fees as an LP, so I'm glad we're able to figure that out, guys. This is a great place, though, for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners that they should learn more about Pendle at Pendle finance. They should follow Pendle fi on Twitter. They should follow tn underscore Pendle.
00:50:14.322 - 00:51:03.214, Speaker B: They should also follow what is it? Pendle intern? The handle is, I think it's just Pendle intern. There you go. Yeah, just pendle intern. So that is one of the best accounts to discover new strategies to just kind of learn what others are doing. There's always analysis that's being posted there about what are others doing in terms of trading YT tokens? Where are the best PT token opportunities? There's been a lot of analysis leading up to token launches, which has allowed me personally to figure out what might be my estimated return holding something like a YT token. It's a lot of math, and I appreciate whoever's doing that behind the scenes. That said, none of this is financial advice.
00:51:03.214 - 00:51:30.704, Speaker B: Tien want to give you the final word, then. Thank you so much for coming on board with us. I posted during the podcast on Twitter. I feel like a kid in a candy shop. I'm just so excited to talk with you about this. Pendle is without a doubt like just one of my favorite defi applications because it allows you to do so much. And I think it's a great example of the power of tokenization.
00:51:30.704 - 00:51:43.832, Speaker B: It's a great example of the power of composability. We're just, we're grateful for builders like you, but yeah. Any recommended steps for folks that want to get involved with Pendle or any like, final bit of alpha you might share?
00:51:43.968 - 00:52:16.796, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think following Pendle intern is definitely the right thing to do, even for myself. I'm learning a lot from from pedal intern accounts because I don't track the market as closely just because the time constraint. So getting the summary trade of the day from petal intern account is very valuable. Sometimes the pedal intern account posts memes. Pretty funny stuff too, so that's pretty good entertainment there.
00:52:16.940 - 00:52:29.424, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of these, the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
