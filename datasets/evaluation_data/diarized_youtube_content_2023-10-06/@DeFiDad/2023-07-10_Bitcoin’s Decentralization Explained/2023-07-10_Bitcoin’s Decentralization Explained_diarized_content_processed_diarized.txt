00:00:00.250 - 00:00:31.698, Speaker A: You know, I don't want to pick on Solana, but if Solana Labs shuts down tomorrow, I think the state of the Solana blockchain would be much questionable. No matter which company shuts down like bitcoin, it wouldn't even be a blip. It just doesn't matter. It makes it a different type of an asset because it is the most grassroots technology. What that means is if you're building something on bitcoin, it has the potential to last long. It's designed to be more durable. It's designed to be more decentralized.
00:00:31.698 - 00:00:51.820, Speaker A: And then on the decentralization side, one interesting thing is that there are certain applications where decentralization matters a lot. And bitcoin is sort of like money is one application. You don't want to be in a position where the money supply, like, can be changed for whatever reason.
