00:00:11.050 - 00:00:31.330, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, this is DFI talks with DFI. Dad, thanks for joining us today. It's Wednesday, September 14, 2022. I'm joined here by Marcos Varemis, who is a partner at Accolade Partners, which is a premier fund of funds that invests specifically in crypto native funds.
00:00:31.410 - 00:00:33.798, Speaker B: Many folks who misunderstand this space, I.
00:00:33.804 - 00:00:42.106, Speaker C: Think, have never used it or have never attempted to use it, have never owned a wallet, have never used the.
00:00:42.128 - 00:00:44.710, Speaker D: DeFi protocol, connected with the DeFi protocol.
00:00:44.790 - 00:00:49.530, Speaker C: Have never joined the Dow, have never bought an NFT.
00:00:50.130 - 00:00:56.560, Speaker B: I think many folks just criticize this space without even having tried it.
00:00:57.090 - 00:01:02.142, Speaker C: And I think if you try it, you learn about it. I can explain to it.
00:01:02.276 - 00:01:04.126, Speaker B: I can explain to people, like in.
00:01:04.148 - 00:01:07.940, Speaker C: So many words what all these things are, but if they don't use it.
00:01:08.790 - 00:01:10.274, Speaker B: It won't mean much to them.
00:01:10.312 - 00:01:10.610, Speaker D: Right?
00:01:10.680 - 00:01:14.354, Speaker C: So I think people should try to use it.
00:01:14.552 - 00:01:26.306, Speaker B: So the idea that talent and a powerful technology can come together to build applications did play out. So now you have much more proof than you did back then about what's.
00:01:26.338 - 00:01:27.640, Speaker D: To happen going forward.
00:01:28.190 - 00:01:30.118, Speaker B: At least now you have the groundwork.
00:01:30.214 - 00:01:38.860, Speaker C: And you have several applications that have been used by millions of people. They've exchanged trillions of dollars in value.
00:01:40.590 - 00:01:41.610, Speaker B: Defi.
00:01:43.810 - 00:01:45.262, Speaker C: Now you have all this.
00:01:45.316 - 00:01:47.934, Speaker B: So the question is, will the next.
00:01:47.972 - 00:01:50.954, Speaker C: Wave be even better, even more powerful?
00:01:51.002 - 00:02:06.838, Speaker B: And I have no doubt whatsoever if this space went from zero to having all these applications in a period of two years, from 2018 to 2020. Now, in the next two to three years, I think this is going to.
00:02:06.844 - 00:02:08.978, Speaker D: Be an order of magnitude larger.
00:02:09.154 - 00:02:15.940, Speaker B: And I think that's easier to sell now to p two, to institutional investors because there's a story to be told.
