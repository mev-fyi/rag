00:00:11.370 - 00:01:12.048, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad. So I've got a brief lesson for you on what is yield farming? Normally I do video tutorials that are step by step how I am actually using DeFi applications, but I've had a lot of questions and comments about what is yield farming, how is it different from Defi? Or how is it a part of Defi? And so I thought I could walk through some of my thoughts on how I'm classifying this subsection of DeFi. So let's get started. If we think about what DeFi is and where it originates from, the way I think about it is that it uses the principles that have defined what is bitcoin. So we're talking about a peer to peer, decentralized, censorship resistant finance system. Now, with bitcoin, it was all about a store of value and being able to transfer that value. And that still is very important today.
00:01:12.048 - 00:02:09.248, Speaker A: However, I think where Ethereum has expanded on that is it's enabling us to basically take legacy banking tools and infrastructure and build it in a peer to peer, decentralized, censorship resistant fashion. Obviously, all of this is able to settle in a matter of minutes or seconds on the Ethereum blockchain. Some of the more popular DeFi applications relate to wallets, lending and borrowing, but the lending, of course, that relates back to earning interest. We've got spot trading, so that would essentially replace what folks do on centralized exchanges. You have margin trading, which also has happened on centralized exchanges. And then beyond that, we talk about what market making, derivatives, options and lots more. So at the end of the day, I think about DeFi as what enables me to allow my money and assets to continue to earn more.
00:02:09.414 - 00:02:14.724, Speaker B: And it allows me ultimately then to do what I would have done in.
00:02:14.762 - 00:03:06.018, Speaker A: Legacy finance, where I had to go through KyC, I have to go through brokers, I have to go through lots and lots of middlemen. But in this scenario, I'm able to do it in a peer to peer fashion. The closest cousin to yield farming, before we actually talk about it, is uniswap LPs. I think about Uniswap, by the way, this refers to liquidity providers or liquidity provisions. This is the idea that you are a market maker in a dex that allows someone to trade any asset on ethereum for other assets. And the way that it works here, I'll actually walk you through these points on the interface. If I'm a trader, I come to uniswap to do a swap or a trade.
00:03:06.018 - 00:03:07.746, Speaker A: And that means that I could be trading.
00:03:07.778 - 00:03:12.150, Speaker B: Let's say ether for something like die.
00:03:14.170 - 00:03:30.190, Speaker A: So in this case, let's pretend that I'm going to sell one ether for 232 die. What's special about this is that this is peer to peer. I never give up control of my assets. Those that are providing liquidity ultimately are in control of their assets.
00:03:30.770 - 00:03:32.446, Speaker B: I think the biggest risk here, of.
00:03:32.468 - 00:04:08.150, Speaker A: Course, is that we are trusting the smart contracts in uniswap to not have a bug. And so the other side of this utility, to be able to trade from one asset, ether, to another asset, Dai, or anything else on ethereum, is the ability to be a liquidity provider. And so I, as a liquidity provider, let's pretend that we're going to jump into the dai ETH pool. I, as a liquidity provider, am basically depositing my assets and I'm allowing people to trade in between dai and ether.
00:04:08.310 - 00:04:09.340, Speaker B: There we go.
00:04:10.350 - 00:04:26.080, Speaker A: So as people are trading between dai and ether, they're paying 0.3% per trade. Now, I am earning a fraction of that 0.3% fee, and it's dependent on how much of the pool I own. So if the pool is, let's say.
00:04:26.850 - 00:04:29.614, Speaker B: A million dollars in total, if I.
00:04:29.652 - 00:05:12.846, Speaker A: Have 100,000 in it, which I don't, I wish I did, but I don't. But if I had 100,000 in it, I would own 10% of the pool, and so I would earn 10% of those daily fees. So let's pretend there was a million dollars in trading volume, then there's 0.3% as a fee applied to the million dollars, and then I earn a fraction of it according to how much of the pool I owned. So maybe I own 10% of the pool, I earn 10% of the fees. All right, so going back to the slide here, so this is very similar to what we're going to talk about with yield farming. It's allowing you to take idle assets and put them to work.
00:05:12.846 - 00:05:40.466, Speaker A: So if I have ether and I have die, I can deposit those then into a 50 50 ratio into Uniswap, and I can earn this 0.3% fee for all the different trades that are happening. However, the reason I don't necessarily classify this as yield farming is that I think that the minute the price changes on the assets, which is constantly, if you think about if I'm in an ether pool with ether and dai, let's.
00:05:40.498 - 00:05:41.080, Speaker B: Say.
00:05:42.970 - 00:06:25.222, Speaker A: The minute the price changes on ether, I have either longed or essentially shorted ether. So what I mean to say here is that if I'm a market maker, there is a risk in me shorting assets in an uptrend and longing them in a downtrend. Now that might be my strategy. Maybe the market is dropping very quickly and my goal is to accumulate ether. Well, this is a great way to do that. Like I have the ability now to earn a market maker fee and my dai is ultimately allowing me to accumulate more ether. As the market is falling and people are selling and I'm then buying that ether, and then the reverse is happening.
00:06:25.222 - 00:06:49.440, Speaker A: If the market's going upwards, I would technically then be selling ether for DAi, as others are buying ether with DAi. All right, so what is yield farming? The way I think about this is that it is a subsection of DeFi that allows one to earn yield using deFi apps, wallets and protocols.
00:06:49.780 - 00:06:55.796, Speaker B: If you have idle assets. So think about this as if I.
00:06:55.818 - 00:07:39.600, Speaker A: Have some DAi, I have some ether. In the last example, these are assets that are sitting there in my wallet and I am thinking about how to put them to use to earn yield. Then another part of this is it often doesn't require me buying and selling my existing assets. So it goes back to this idea of I have idle assets. I am not having to try to buy low, sell high. I'm using what is in my portfolio. And for example, if I have ether, and if I am long ether, and I have no intention to sell it for years or until a much higher price target, I might as well put it to use and try to earn yield off of my ether.
00:07:39.600 - 00:08:09.740, Speaker A: The next part of this is it often involves providing liquidity. So most of what I think about related to yield farming means that I am providing liquidity like we did in uniswap. And then the last bit of this is yield often comes in many forms. So I think about yield farming when I am able to potentially earn interest as well as market making fees as well as incentives, rewards that have been allocated by the protocol. So a good example of this last.
00:08:09.810 - 00:08:13.516, Speaker B: One here is synthetix has really been.
00:08:13.538 - 00:09:05.968, Speaker A: One of the teams that has pioneered offering LP rewards or LP incentives. And so we're going to walk through some examples here. But what they've done in the past is they have allocated a certain amount of SNX, the native token for synthetics that is powered by Ethereum. That SNX token can be paid to those that are acting as liquidity providers in the synthetic ether pool in uniswap. So long story short, it's a way for me to earn another token here because of some rewards that have been allocated by the protocol. Okay, so example one is curve finance. I think this is one of the simpler examples, as I think about yield farming.
00:09:05.968 - 00:10:05.220, Speaker A: So, of the three common ways that I might earn yield, the two ways that happen in curve finance, considering the Y pool, the Y stablecoin pool is I'm able to earn interest and market making fees. Curve, at its core is a stablecoin Dex, which means that I could come in and say I, as a trader, or anyone I guess, wants to swap 100 die for, let's say, 100 USDC or 100.46. And the hope here, of course, is that you're getting this at a near one to one rate. You're getting it with the least amount of slippage, the best possible rate. So that's what folks are using this for. But for those that are farming yield on curve, those are folks that are liquidity providers. And so what's happening is they are going here to the deposit tab, and they are depositing whatever amount of stablecoins.
00:10:05.220 - 00:10:44.644, Speaker A: Those stablecoins then end up in the pool, which currently has around ten point $13 million in it. You can see that there's a different ratio of these different tokens. Dai, USDC, tether, and true USD, they reflect different demand for different stable coins. And so my share of the pool is only zero point 16%. So in this case, I have $1,600, which is a lot to me, but I guess it's a very small amount in the pool. And in this pool, my ratios of dai to USDC to tether to true USD, they reflect the same ratios here of the bigger pie.
00:10:44.842 - 00:10:48.896, Speaker B: And so when I deposit my stablecoins.
00:10:49.088 - 00:11:59.996, Speaker A: I have taken, in my case, stablecoins that would have been sitting in my wallet not being used otherwise. I deposit them and they're actually wrapped as what is called a y token. And if you want to learn about iearn, I e a R N finance, it is an interest earning protocol that allows you to basically move stable coins or other assets to hopefully the highest interest earning lending pools. So anyways, long story short, my tokens go in whatever ratio I want. I mean, if I want to put in here, I could put in here 100 die, I could choose to put in zero USDC, I could choose to put in 50 USDC. It's going to swap these tokens to ultimately reflect these percentages below, so that they're in the right ratio, and that I'm ultimately a liquidity provider. And then I'm earning interest, but I'm also earning a market making fee, because those that are trading, when they go from, let's say 100 die to 100 USDC, they're paying 0.4%.
00:11:59.996 - 00:12:08.144, Speaker A: And so it's just like what we talked about with Uniswap, where I am earning a fraction of that 0.4% on.
00:12:08.182 - 00:12:10.512, Speaker B: Every trade, and I've got my money.
00:12:10.566 - 00:12:19.936, Speaker A: In here with the ability to withdraw it whenever I want, because I'm in control of these digital assets through metamask.
00:12:19.968 - 00:12:21.620, Speaker B: Or some other ethereum wallet.
00:12:22.520 - 00:12:28.352, Speaker A: So there's an example of me earning interest and market making fees on assets.
00:12:28.416 - 00:12:31.292, Speaker B: That in this case I already had stablecoins.
00:12:31.376 - 00:12:38.036, Speaker A: I'm not having to gain exposure to any other assets. Technically, those different stablecoins are different assets.
00:12:38.148 - 00:12:41.560, Speaker B: But they are dollar pegged stablecoins.
00:12:42.060 - 00:12:47.836, Speaker A: The other thing to consider here though, is my biggest risk is a smart contract bug, and that tends to be.
00:12:47.858 - 00:12:51.980, Speaker B: My biggest risk in all DeFi applications.
00:12:56.310 - 00:13:26.110, Speaker A: Okay, so next, for example two, I want to talk about the comp governance token. This is where I'm earning lending interest, potentially, if I'm lending to the comp or to the compound finance app, and then I'm also earning an incentive or reward, which is the comp governance token. I'm earning that for however long I am lending or borrowing in whichever market in compound. And so if we go to compound.
00:13:27.730 - 00:13:30.810, Speaker B: The way that this works is normally.
00:13:30.970 - 00:13:51.170, Speaker A: I'd have the ability here on the supply side, I could supply or lend any of these assets, and then I can earn whatever the interest rate is here. So you can see like some of these are higher, some of these are lower. Die, you can earn 0.9%. But the bat token, which is much more volatile, you can earn 25%.
00:13:51.240 - 00:13:53.334, Speaker B: At this moment, on the other side.
00:13:53.372 - 00:14:24.090, Speaker A: Of the equation, those that are borrowing are paying an interest rate. So in this case, those that borrow bat are paying 32.67%, and we as lenders are earning a fraction of 24.98% in interest. That's one way that I'm earning, the other way that I'm quote unquote, farming yield is I am earning the governance token comp. And so if we go ahead and connect my wallet, connect my metamask, we go to vote.
00:14:24.250 - 00:14:24.990, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:14:25.060 - 00:14:53.802, Speaker A: You can see I have earned 0.57 comp token. And so I'm earning that because I am participating in this market as a lender. However, if we go back to this, that to me is the simplest example of me earning lending interest and then earning a reward. I think where the comp governance token goes beyond the way that I'm thinking.
00:14:53.856 - 00:14:57.638, Speaker B: About yield farming is I'm adding risk.
00:14:57.734 - 00:15:30.626, Speaker A: When I start to use leverage. And so this is maybe the safer example that I would consider for myself. But then when I start using leverage, like I've done before with flash loans on instadap, and I built a leverage position out of stablecoins, well, now I run the risk of liquidation if I don't manage that position, if my debt balloons because of the borrowing interest and so on. So there's that. There's a smart contract bug risk, and then there's also the drawdown, the risk.
00:15:30.658 - 00:15:32.678, Speaker B: Of a drawdown on the price of comp.
00:15:32.844 - 00:15:40.338, Speaker A: So let's pretend I have a leverage position like I was just describing, and I am.
00:15:40.444 - 00:15:44.586, Speaker B: Then let's go back to this, just.
00:15:44.608 - 00:15:46.138, Speaker A: To show you the exact numbers.
00:15:46.304 - 00:15:51.818, Speaker B: Let's pretend that I have built a.
00:15:51.824 - 00:16:26.694, Speaker A: Leverage position in compound where let's say I had 100 die and then I borrowed some USDC against my die, and then the flash loan redeposits that die. So now I have 300 die and I've borrowed 200 USDC, that's a leveraged position. And if I don't manage my debt so that my debt is less than 75% of my collateral, I'm going to get liquidated. That's my concern here, that I want to call out that if I am.
00:16:26.732 - 00:16:30.002, Speaker B: Yield farming, there's a quote unquote safer.
00:16:30.066 - 00:16:34.246, Speaker A: Way to do it where I'm simply lending, earning interest, and then I'm earning.
00:16:34.278 - 00:16:36.922, Speaker B: The comp token, and then there's getting.
00:16:36.976 - 00:16:42.198, Speaker A: Leverage involved, which makes it even riskier. And now I could potentially be liquidated.
00:16:42.294 - 00:16:44.030, Speaker B: And lose my collateral.
00:16:45.090 - 00:17:01.250, Speaker A: One last thing to call out on this is if we go back to the original checklist of what makes yield farming yield farming. You can see here again, we're making use of defi apps and protocols. We're using assets that are idle.
00:17:01.670 - 00:17:02.498, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:17:02.584 - 00:17:04.014, Speaker A: Using assets that are idle.
00:17:04.062 - 00:17:06.414, Speaker B: So again, I might use some dai.
00:17:06.462 - 00:17:46.942, Speaker A: Or lend some ether to compound. The idea here is that I'm not having to buy or sell existing assets. So even when I use leverage, I'm technically at that point, I'm going long then on die in the example I explained earlier. And so this is where I think it's fuzzy as to what is yield farming and what is ultimately trading. And so I think this is where yield farming starts to look more like trading. And it is ultimately, if I am using leverage, I consider that to be a trade. So beyond that, then I'm still providing a liquidity.
00:17:46.942 - 00:17:54.754, Speaker A: I'm providing a liquidity for others to borrow from. And yeah, again, we're earning interest and.
00:17:54.792 - 00:17:57.730, Speaker B: We'Re earning incentives rewards from protocols.
00:18:03.000 - 00:18:58.244, Speaker A: Okay, so the last example is the balancer governance token. And this is where I'm earning market making fees and I'm earning two incentives rewards depending on which pool you're in, because synthetix also offers an incentive for participating in some of the pools. Okay, so the way that it works in balancer is it's very similar to Uniswap, except I don't have 50 50 proportions between two tokens. And actually I think I can have up to eight tokens in one of these pools. So in this case I have 10% USDC and 90% SNX. This allows me to become a market maker by depositing however much I want. But as long as I have 90% SNX and 10% USDC in the liquidity provision, so I could add that liquidity and then I'm doing the same thing I did with Uniswap.
00:18:58.244 - 00:19:03.744, Speaker A: I'm earning a market making fee. Every time people trade and they're trading.
00:19:03.892 - 00:19:05.592, Speaker B: The funds that are in this pool.
00:19:05.656 - 00:19:51.640, Speaker A: I earn a portion of those fees depending on how much of the pool I own. However, I am able to earn different liquidity provider rewards through synthetics. So think about it this way. Synthetix wants to provide the ability for folks to be able to trade in and out of USDC and SNX. This benefits those that use synthetics. So if you're providing that liquidity, they've cleverly set aside funds to pay you for being a liquidity provider. And these automatically get distributed normally, it's like once a week.
00:19:51.640 - 00:20:14.092, Speaker A: Sometimes it accrues in real time, this one accrues in real time. So I went to minter with no E in it. Minter. M I n t r synthetics. IO I click on LP rewards. And then here is the balancer SNX pool. So this is where I have staked balancer pool tokens.
00:20:14.092 - 00:20:53.790, Speaker A: So when I went to balancer and I added liquidity in the form of 90% SNX, 10% USDC, I receive a token that is labeled BPT. Then I take the BPT token and I come here and I stake those tokens. So I've already done this, obviously just to save time, but I've got 92.52 bpt and then I'm earning SNX. This is accruing in real time. So if I were to come back to this in a little bit, in a few more minutes, it'd be zero point 85 SNX. I've kind of been watching this all day just to see how it works.
00:20:53.790 - 00:20:58.576, Speaker A: One other thing I want to call out is when you're providing liquidity in.
00:20:58.598 - 00:21:02.380, Speaker B: Balancer, balancer just started providing their balance.
00:21:02.460 - 00:21:04.204, Speaker A: Or BAL governance token.
00:21:04.252 - 00:21:06.624, Speaker B: Just like the comp token works pretty.
00:21:06.662 - 00:21:41.100, Speaker A: Much the same way. It's not distributed in the same proportions. But the idea is that if you're providing liquidity, you are earning this. You know, just to sum it up, here I am market making and earning fees in balancer, I'm earning the bal governance token, and I am also earning SNX because of the fact that I have taken my BPT token, staked it in minter, which allows the synthetics protocol or team to be able to pay me in real time for providing that liquidity.
00:21:41.840 - 00:21:46.620, Speaker B: And so this is really the most powerful example.
00:21:46.690 - 00:22:03.636, Speaker A: You're earning three different rewards. One last thing I want to call out on the risk side is so we have the impermanent loss, just like with uniswap. It just means that as long as the price changes while I am in the pool, if the price of SNX changes while I'm in the pool, I.
00:22:03.658 - 00:22:05.264, Speaker B: Am going to be affected.
00:22:05.312 - 00:22:32.056, Speaker A: I'm not going to walk away with exactly the same amount of SNX. Assuming that there's some trading volume that takes place, and that when the market goes down, technically I am buying SNX. And when it goes up, technically I am selling SNX as traders are using that pool. The other thing is smart contract bugs. Those never go away. That's always a risk in every defi app and protocol. And then the other thing is draw down on the price of balance or the Bal token.
00:22:32.056 - 00:23:20.392, Speaker A: So I'm thinking about that just because for whatever you value your time and the risk of doing this, and whatever gas I ultimately paid to get involved in all of this, obviously this Bal token is helping to compensate for that. And that price of Bal, or Bal, however you pronounce it, it's not guaranteed to go up. I mean, the price of Bal could go down significantly while I am in the pool. And so it's something, I think that's worth thinking about. Even though it is a reward, it is going to be a volatile asset with a price that is set by buyers and sellers in the market. All right, that's all I've got for you today. Thanks so much for listening.
00:23:20.392 - 00:23:49.730, Speaker A: I hope you better understand what is yield farming and how it is, I think, a subsection of defi, and also why it's an opportunity. But where is the risk in all of this? There's definitely an argument to be made, depending on your risk profile and depending on what my goals are and what assets I might have idle in my wallet, whether or not I should participate in yield farming. So let me know if you have any questions, and I'll see you next time.
