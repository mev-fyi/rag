00:00:02.250 - 00:00:52.006, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi. Dad. Hey, thanks for joining us. It's Wednesday, June 15, 2022. We're talking on a pretty epic day in crypto. We've had a major sort of drawdown in the markets over the last few months, and I think timing it any better to be speaking about the importance of liquidations in DeFi. So I'm joined here by the team from B protocol, which stands for backstop protocol.
00:00:52.006 - 00:01:26.440, Speaker A: It's a backstop solution which will talk more about how it enables us to have more capital efficient and more reliable liquidations. And you'll soon discover just how important liquidations are in terms of Defi and all of the systemic risk that you incur in terms of the different money Legos we use. So, anyways, I've got Jerome Velner, who is the founder of B protocol and CEO of B Protocol, and Etan, who is the head of growth. So, guys, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:27.930 - 00:01:29.800, Speaker B: Yeah, guy, thanks for having.
00:01:31.530 - 00:01:44.878, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. Yeah. Well, hey, I started to tell the story of what B protocol does, and we talked quite a while ago, not two years, but probably almost two years ago.
00:01:44.964 - 00:01:48.014, Speaker C: I think it was November. I think it was November 2020.
00:01:48.052 - 00:02:44.990, Speaker A: 2020, yeah. So that was almost six months after maker accrued bad debt because of a failure of their keeper system or their liquidations, we'll just call it. And that was a very scary time back when we were just preceding the COVID pandemic, really affecting everyone across the world, putting everyone into lockdown, and markets melted down. And long story short, the liquidations that should have happened did not take place and maker was left with bad debt. So sometime after that, I thought it was you started working on it in reaction to it, or maybe you just foresaw what was coming there. Let's talk about really, like, what is a backstop solution in case someone is totally new to B protocol.
00:02:46.370 - 00:03:25.614, Speaker C: Yeah. So maybe I'll start just with a kind of general intro. And we spoke in November 2020, and I remember that because it was about a month after we launched in October that year. So, yeah, just when we started that, it was, as you mentioned, kind of a reaction to what on Black Thursday. But basically we pivoted since then. And today, B protocol is on its V two, which is a user based backstop. So maybe just kind of in a one line.
00:03:25.614 - 00:04:33.538, Speaker C: B protocol is a liquidation engine for DeFi. We build and integrate user based backstop pools into lending platforms, and these pools are basically committed liquidity, which is provided by users to handle liquidations as they happen on those supported platforms. Maybe it's worth kind of go through a very short explanation on how liquidations actually work in DeFi, as I think, though maybe some of the listeners have been liquidated before. Not everyone is really kind of familiar with how exactly the mechanics of the liquidation is. So very shortly. Once the collateral factor of a position and collateral factor is different terms, it can be LTV on ave loan to value, it can be collateral ratios on maker. But basically, once this collateral factor is reached on a specific account, meaning the deposited collateral that you have hasn't got enough value to actually maintain the healthiness of the loan that account took against it.
00:04:33.538 - 00:05:39.850, Speaker C: And then a liquidation will be triggered, and then someone will repay the debt. The loan in return for the collateral will get the collateral plus the bonus, which is the liquidation bonus that the platform provides. So whenever there's a backstop integrated there, the repayment of the debt is being made from the liquidity pool of the backstop instead of going through a dex or amm. And we'll discuss that shortly. Once the debt is being paid, the collateral is being seized, plus the bonus. And then B protocol has its kind of innovative mechanics where we rebalance, we sell the seized collateral back to the, let's say it was USDC or whatever that was used to repay the debt. So we resell the asset back to the base asset and redeposit it into the backstop pool.
00:05:39.850 - 00:06:07.940, Speaker C: So yeah, that's basically kind of what we do. Maybe worth mentioning that liquidations are not only on lending platforms. Basically, there are different protocols in DeFi derivatives stables that kind of rely on liquidations for their healthiness, the healthiness of the protocol and solvency. So yeah, I think that's kind of.
00:06:09.110 - 00:07:01.220, Speaker A: In general, actually, as we talk about that. Would either of you want to screen share B protocol just to show the app? Because I think it brings it to life. Just kind of seeing how it is that you are aggregating all this liquidity and democratizing, basically democratizing access to liquidations. So there's a whole incentive mechanism here that is allowing folks who basically participate through these different protocols using B protocol as like a middleware layer. It's allowing us to have more reliable liquidations, which it benefits everyone. But per usual in everything in life, and most obviously in DeFi, you have to have some sort of monetary incentive. At the end of the day.
00:07:03.670 - 00:07:03.938, Speaker B: You.
00:07:03.944 - 00:07:09.218, Speaker A: Can earn a portion of the liquidation profits by using B protocol.
00:07:09.394 - 00:07:47.790, Speaker C: Yeah, and those can be quite hefty. It's like anywhere between usually 5% to 10%. The liquidation bonus that the incentives coming from the lending platforms, plus at least the platforms we are integrated with, and many others, offer their own liquidity mining incentives, which backstoppers. Those who provide liquidity into the backstop also gain from that. So you gain both, as a user of the protocol, you gain both the liquidity mining rewards and the liquidation profits that are made by the backstop.
00:07:48.550 - 00:07:55.780, Speaker A: Absolutely. And Yoron, anything you want to weigh in on there, add to, as we're sort of talking about the importance of these.
00:08:00.710 - 00:08:33.200, Speaker B: Know, like adding to what Aitan said, eventually, liquidations are kind of the maybe unspoken but backbone of most defi activity. So for simple swaps might be the only simple operations do not involve liquidations, but basically big parts of DeFi as we know it, simply couldn't exist without it.
00:08:35.810 - 00:09:54.650, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, Eton, do you think now would be a good time to start screen sharing some of the examples? I guess. Where does this play into DeFi? I think again, the most obvious example, which again, on most days, I always think of this as one of the less sexy parts of DFI. This is important to the backbone of DFI continuing to work, but it's not the next hottest yield farm. However, when we are selling off like this, the markets in general, let's say bitcoin and ether, I think are down 50% or more over the past month. There are lots of positions with leverage that are unwinding, and they're unwinding, hopefully, or they're being liquidated, because at the end of the day, we as lenders, I think the most popular use case still in like we depend on these liquidations. Otherwise, I'm lending to someone who's not maintaining their loan, and I'm not going to be able to reliably get my money back, which defeats the whole purpose of permissionless, trustless defi lending.
00:09:55.150 - 00:10:57.360, Speaker C: Liquidations, in a way, a metaphor we gave previously, was like a sewage system for DeFI. It's like all the thresholds going in, but without it, you wouldn't like your sewage system in the building where you live or in your city to break or even to malfunction, even for a short while. So I think that's kind of the same with liquidation systems in Defi. It's something that you need to have it. Not everyone likes to dive in and get dirty in a way, but basically this is what. But maybe before I share screen and we kind of go through, maybe let's talk about what actually is broken, because something got broken. Now, some might say it was already broken and now it's just being amplified in a way.
00:10:57.360 - 00:12:15.202, Speaker C: But if you are forking compound or just opening your own new lending platform, probably one of your devs tasks will be to have a flesh loan liquidation bot up and running as you launch, just on the to do list. And these bots are either maintained by third parties or by the teams themselves. It doesn't really matter. But to operate kind of the same, where the bot constantly or periodically will just scan the accounts in the platform, and once liquidation is being triggered on one of the accounts, we'll take a flash loan to repay the debt. So let's give an example. If I put 1 million worth of ETH as collateral, I borrow half a million USBC, and now it dropped and my account is being liquidated someone and that would what the flesh loan bot will do. The flesh loan bot will take flesh loan repay.
00:12:15.202 - 00:13:21.386, Speaker C: The half million USDC will get, let's say the penalty, the discount is 10% just for easy numbering. So it will get 550K worth of ETH collateral. And now, because that's a flesh loan, it needs to repay the USDC. So it will dump the e on the nearest decks, it will sell the 550 USDC, or at least the 500, sorry, ETH back to USDC to repay the loan. And all that needs to be made through one single transaction. And what happened is, because dex liquidity mainly, as we mentioned, new L ones, and definitely on some of the l two s, just got really shrank in the last few weeks and even months. The slippage that you get on the decks, or even for small amount swaps, is bigger than the liquidation incentive.
00:13:21.386 - 00:14:07.450, Speaker C: So let's say anything above 10% slippage price impact, as you will see, just makes the whole transaction. I'm not talking about fees on the way that needs to be paid. And this breaks the whole operation of the flesh loan bot, and liquidation just won't be executed. And that became the norm. Having a flesh loan bot means your liquidation mechanics is kind of in the right place. It's legit, and this is how you can launch. And what we actually showed in the latest blog, we shared that, actually, it's not that simple.
00:14:07.450 - 00:14:14.138, Speaker C: It doesn't work really anymore. So, yeah, I can share screen, I can just show a few live examples.
00:14:14.314 - 00:14:20.320, Speaker A: That would be great. Whenever you're ready, I'll share your screen here.
00:14:21.250 - 00:14:31.602, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's just start with. Yeah, you can share that. Yeah. Can you see my screen? Yes.
00:14:31.656 - 00:14:35.346, Speaker A: There we go. So we're looking at ave v three here, right?
00:14:35.448 - 00:15:31.190, Speaker C: Ave on Polygon Ave launched multichain, which is probably a good direction to grow. And they list link as a collateral. And though it has currently low liquidity, it doesn't really matter. There is 50% max LTV. So this is the collateral factor we were talking about. Meaning if I'm providing 1 million of link, I can borrow up to 500K worth of USDC or whatever else I want to borrow against my link. But if I go to one inch, which is a Dex aggregator, in case someone is not familiar with that on polygon, and I try just to liquidate, that's what the flesh blown bot will do.
00:15:31.190 - 00:15:58.606, Speaker C: It will try to dump the link back to USCC, it will try to make a swap. So let's say 200,000 USDC worth of link will already get you. I don't know if that's big enough to see on the screen, but it will get you like a 13% price impact, like a slippage of 13%, which is bigger. The liquidation incentive here is seven and.
00:15:58.628 - 00:15:59.280, Speaker A: A half.
00:16:01.730 - 00:16:17.720, Speaker C: So it's nearly double. So the bot will just not execute this liquidation. So even if you need to liquidate just two hundred k of link, you won't be able, Avi won't be able to actually liquidate that position.
00:16:19.930 - 00:16:54.050, Speaker B: Or maybe more precisely, it will take a long time to liquidate. Right? Because what will happen if you liquidate a small amount? Then we'll have to wait for more liquidity to flow into polygon. And the hope is that by the time the full liquidation will be finished, the price will not decrease too much and there will still be something to liquidate. But it definitely breaks the entire flesh long model where everything is instantly being liquidated.
00:16:55.670 - 00:17:49.582, Speaker A: Got it. For those that are newer to this, what's happening under the hood, whether it's through B protocol or whether it's individuals who act as liquidators, they're essentially using flash loans to borrow to win an auction, let's call it. And then once that's done, of course, they can then sell it all for profits. And again, these are normally, I mean, it could be smaller amounts of money, but it could also be larger amounts of money, which is where a lot of the. I think the discussion around risk comes into play here. As we continue to mature and grow as a DFI market, the amounts of those loans continues to grow. There was a vault on Abe last night that people were following closely.
00:17:49.582 - 00:18:30.126, Speaker A: I think it had around $280,000,000 worth of ether. And I would call it, there's still fear. Not just because of the market that we're in. There's, there's still generally an uncertainty around, you know, will x liquidations happen when they should? Do we run the risk of accruing any sort of bad debt when the market is in total freefall, which goes back to, again, what you all solve with b protocol. But guys, anything else here on the ave or one inch apps that you.
00:18:30.148 - 00:18:45.058, Speaker C: Wanted to show off? Multiple examples. We can show there's different platforms. And Venus has also some same issues with other tokens.
00:18:45.114 - 00:18:45.720, Speaker A: S.
00:18:50.890 - 00:18:55.800, Speaker C: The bad depth is a real thing. Maybe I'll try and show right there.
00:18:57.770 - 00:19:52.134, Speaker A: Hey, by the way, as you're pulling it up, so if someone watches this in the future, and we're not going to dwell on this, but I think it's good to just relate a more recent event to what we're discussing here within DFI in the last, like 48 hours, a pretty well known hedge fund within DFI, crypto, web three, whatever you want to call it. They appear to have been blown up by the downturn in the market. It appears, without speculating any further on it, because there isn't a real confirmation just yet announced by the team. It appears that they experienced a number of margin calls. There we go. Just re adding your screen. And so anyways, long story short, they owe debts.
00:19:52.134 - 00:20:46.490, Speaker A: If this is true, this is a team that owes debts off chain, and obviously, there's a risk to those folks of not being paid back. One of the concerns, of course, in market downturns is what are some of the hidden sort of ripple effects that we will feel as this downturn happens and certain folks are not able to pay back their debts, and then that affects someone else who then possibly can't pay their debts, and you have this sort of cascading shit happen. So anyways, that hopefully sets us up for really these major risks that you're looking to solve for through B protocol. And anyways, guys, what is risk? Dow here, talk me through. How does this relate back to B protocol?
00:20:47.550 - 00:21:38.698, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just to complete what Aitan said about bed depth being not only theoretical risk. So basically, maybe if Aitan can scroll down, a bed depth does exist, also in different platforms, going to be sitting Venus iron banks with millions of bed depth. So it's true. It's not only because of failed liquidations, also with iron banks. It's a bit of a different setup, but yeah, eventually malfunctions in lending platforms is a real issue, and you have a real bad. So maybe, I don't know. Before moving to the risk, Dow Eitan, if you want to complete the story about how B protocol actually solves and mitigate everything.
00:21:38.864 - 00:23:05.414, Speaker C: Yeah. So instead, as we showed on one inch, the slippage is kind of breaking the liquidation process when it is managed by liquidation bots. Basically what the backstop is doing, it's kind of a buffer that amplifies the available dex liquidity. So we're not doing magic, we can't create liquidity where it's completely empty. But basically what it does is that instead of just dumping everything on the decks, the liquidity for the liquidation is taken out from the backstop pool, and then we rebalance the seized collateral that we got from the liquidation gradually. So we can actually do that without creating a price impact, which, as you mentioned, can create cascading liquidation scenario. And basically that kind of amplifies the dex liquidity that's in there and probably worth mentioning, and Yvonne can probably do the math better.
00:23:05.414 - 00:24:01.590, Speaker C: But in general, if you take, just because the way amms Dexes work, you need kind of high liquidity in the pools, because the slippage is kind of a feature there. You need high liquidity in the pools to actually, to liquidate small amounts. So even for, if you have 100 million in USDC pool, 5 million will get you to 5% slippage, more or less. And yellow one can correct me on the math, and with B protocol, we can do the 5 million liquidation, just with 5 million, we don't need 100 million. It's enough to have 5 million in the pool to actually make the 5 million liquidation. So, yeah, it's definitely much higher capital efficient.
00:24:03.530 - 00:24:32.980, Speaker B: Eventually, the protocol is kind of a buffer to amplify Dex liquidity. So once you set liquidity, which is available for liquidations only, without using Uniswap V two formula, this way we can also avoid slippage, so we just amplify. Buffer always amplifies liquidity. And yeah, factors can go all the way sometimes to even x five or extend, really depends on the concrete numbers.
00:24:33.910 - 00:25:14.810, Speaker C: And also, once it's worth mentioning, once we can actually support better liquidation and kind of have the committed liquidity to do that, then platforms can actually both offer a better kind of safety net for the lenders. So they are feeling more secure that, as you mentioned in the beginning, lenders feel that they will be able to get their money back, and on the other end, borrowers can actually get better collateral factors, so they can actually get better capital efficiency on the collateral that they provide. So this is kind of.
00:25:14.820 - 00:25:27.330, Speaker A: I did not realize that you do get a better collateralization factor, let's just say you can borrow more against your deposits through b protocol.
00:25:27.850 - 00:26:08.740, Speaker C: So of course it's up to the lending platform to actually change the parameters. But this is what we show, and that's part of the risk dow and can probably elaborate on that soon. But basically, because you have a better liquidation mechanic, you can facilitate liquidations with kind of a narrower buffer. The margin, that is a safety margin that you need to keep as a lending platform can be smaller because you don't need to kind of count on the Dex liquidity as it is.
00:26:11.590 - 00:26:21.974, Speaker A: B protocol is currently available for maker and compound, but is there any other. I'm sorry, go ahead.
00:26:22.012 - 00:26:54.682, Speaker C: Yeah, so compound and maker is our V one, but basically what we are focusing now is the user backstop, which is what we went through now. And this is available on mainet for liquidity. So you can actually provide LUsd through the backstop. That's great. We automate the whole rebalancing part, so otherwise liquidity users need to rebalance themselves. So that's on mainnet. We are integrated also with Vesta Finance, which is a liquidity token.
00:26:54.682 - 00:27:02.260, Speaker C: Arbitrum with VSD is the stable, so users can provide VSP into.
00:27:06.550 - 00:28:49.110, Speaker A: You. Do you guys envision a future where B protocol is this middle layer that sits between basically users and whether it's aave compound, whatever, whether you use something like instadap or Defi saver, it feels silly to me that there's so much money at stake, and we talked about this back in November 2020. I really want to, I guess, press the urgency of more platforms to integrate B protocol, because I personally don't sleep too well right now, although I've got a problem with pollen in the area. So forgive me, I keep rubbing my eyes with, I've got like allergies or something. But anyways, yeah, it's such like a huge systemic risk to defi with liquidations at risk of not happening or failing us. If you are a token holder, I'll say it myself, if you're a token holder in Aave compound, maker, liquidy, instadap, if you're a customer of Defi saver, which is another amazing super tool, you should be pressing teams as a token holder to implement this, because we're always just one major blow up away, one major blow up away from an existential crisis in Defi.
00:28:49.770 - 00:29:42.566, Speaker C: Yeah. What we are going through is kind of an educational effort both for users and for lending platform teams as well. We want to get to a point where just like smart contract risk is something that any user know that. And also the teams, most of the teams at least know that before they're actually launching. There is a demand for an audit to actually have someone, an outsider, a third party, to actually go through a smart contract and verify that everything is kind of in place. So we want to get that educational phase into risk, into economical risk. So actually, users of platforms, and the big ones, I have to admit, they kind of COVID it.
00:29:42.566 - 00:30:42.998, Speaker C: They have this ave maker component as well. I think they have their own either or both internal risk teams. And they use Gauntlet, for example, as a third party kind of risk auditor that gives some kind of feedback and recommendations on different risk parameters. But we want to kind of get that out to the long tail platforms, to other platforms, on other networks, which do not have downplay, do not have the resources for a risk team, do not have the knowledge sometimes to actually have their users kind of come and demand that from the team. We want to see that everything is in place, and this is how the risk Dow has actually been kind of was the base for that. And the backstop B protocol is bringing kind of a broader perspective of risk management in DeFi. So the backstop is kind of the tool that can mitigate that risk.
00:30:42.998 - 00:30:57.070, Speaker C: But before you're actually mitigating the risk, you probably should know what's going on within your system. So this is where the risk Dow with its audits is coming in, and Jeron can probably elaborate on the risk.
00:31:01.250 - 00:32:32.634, Speaker B: So part of the efforts, especially after we see our lending platforms kind of manage themselves after the liquidity contraction. So we identified a huge gap of knowledge and education, both on some of the platform and especially for the broader audience. Actually, we took an initiative and we launched together with one, KX Capital a Dow, which is called the risk Dow, which mostly aims to increase education, but also transparency and analytics around leading platforms and maybe economic risk in general in DeFi. So one of the first initiatives was setting up this bad debt dashboard. So now you, as a user, before you use your favorite lending platform, can go and check what is the bad debt of this platform, because, for example, you have Venus. Venus with non negligible bed depth, just says nothing to the user. Obviously, all the hacks, all the screw ups they have, they're all public, right? But if you're a user that just goes there, you have no indication that something went wrong there.
00:32:32.634 - 00:33:44.338, Speaker B: And bad debt remains bad debt even after the hack, the bug was fixed or liquidation was executed late. Moreover, as a user, you have no idea who takes best practices seriously, who doesn't who just copy maybe parameters? This is also something we see a lot. So you open a lending market, let's say, I don't know, iotech or like very small alchains, you just copy the parameters from compound or Ave, because obviously compound and Ave have serious risk teams, but the market conditions are very different in Aurora, phantom all these chains. So yeah, this is the risk initiative of educating both lending platforms and both the users, providing public tools, also public risk assessments. So yeah, that's what we have in mind. Sending it up.
00:33:44.504 - 00:34:48.098, Speaker A: Yeah. To just quickly summarize, and this is probably a good point for us to end on and reemphasize. What prompted our conversation was, I want to say it was a few weeks ago, I noticed it was either B protocol or one of you was just tweeting about the fact that there is a real threat to alternative l ones and to l two s, which I kind of just, whatever. At the end of the day, as a user, you're just moving funds from one thing to the next. And so these are emerging DFI web three economies, and I think it brings us back to this very serious risk of liquidations not being reliable. And I'm the first to tell anyone, hey, if you are hindered by the cost of transacting on Ethereum main net, you should be exploring. My hope is in the future, we're all just using Ethereum l two s.
00:34:48.098 - 00:35:27.090, Speaker A: And so, one of the risks, though, while I enjoy using lending platforms like Aave on whether it's arbitram or optimism or polygon, the issue is this lack of liquidity. And there's been a real contraction, which you all pointed out in that liquidity as the markets have drawn down. And so it leaves us in a place where you're wondering, will there be reliable liquidations? As a borrower, of course, that might not sound too bad, but of course, as a lender, you can be hurt ultimately.
00:35:29.290 - 00:35:33.046, Speaker B: In defi, all borrowers are also lenders, right?
00:35:33.228 - 00:36:33.898, Speaker A: Exactly, yes. That's it. At the end of the day, all of these composable money Legos are very interlocked, which again, you take that for granted until something breaks. And again go back to maker having this sort of, I'll call it an implosion, but thankfully we're grateful they survived and found a way to basically pay back the bad debt there. But in March 2020, that was terrifying. That was a moment where it was like, is Dai going to collapse now that maker has failed to liquidate these different loans. And so anyways, that brings us forward to today where we grew from, I want to say, like we had less than maybe 10 billion in total value transacting just on Ethereum at the time to now.
00:36:33.898 - 00:37:23.610, Speaker A: On any given day, it's well south of 100 billion, but it grew to as much as 250,000,000,000. So I don't know how to emphasize the importance of this anymore. I'm not an investor in B protocol, but I just see them as a very important solution to creating a safer, more reliable defi user experience. So I'm hoping that more builders take notice. And then as users, of course, it's actually really important to the adoption of B protocol that users opt into depositing through B protocol because it helps what you to accrue liquidity so that you have liquidity. At the end of the day, you're accruing liquidity that helps with those liquidations.
00:37:24.110 - 00:38:28.880, Speaker C: Yeah, it's both jumping in and providing the liquidity, but also kind of, as we mentioned, poke the team of the platforms that they are using to actually ask sometimes the hard questions, how did you make those risk parameters in place? Are there any risk basically bringing more transparency into this process of liquidations and the bad debt that can accrue when it's malfunctioning? Probably that's part of the things both B protocol and the risk. Dow now that wolf mentioning, we launched as kind of a service. Dow together with one cakes. So yeah, definitely transparency is something that needs to be more prominent in the ecosystem, just like we have with smart contract audits. It's something users know to demand insurance, to demand audits. And now it's also about risk. I think that's kind of the main.
00:38:32.390 - 00:40:14.930, Speaker A: Just one last thing to note, also over the last few weeks, we have Celsius, which is a centralized borrowing and lending platform, but allows you to deposit native crypto assets. And I'm not totally certain of what's going on there, but they've paused withdrawals, and there's a lot of thinking and evidence to point to the fact that they were using DeFi protocols to earn yield and just do all sorts of interesting but risky things in the end to pay yield to depositors. And I think the core issue, which we don't have in DeFi, because everything is just painfully transparent because it's all there on chain, you have no privacy at the end of the day, at least once your wallet is doxed. One of the real benefits here is that in DFI, everything is instantly auditable. So despite, I think, rightfully calling out the risk that there is on these new alternative L ones and l two s that have less liquidity and stand a chance of potentially failing to be able to liquidate loans during a downturn. I think this all pales in comparison to still the black box that is centralized finance. So this is part of that foundational innovation that is there with DeFi and I think notably with what you all work on with a backstop solution.
00:40:14.930 - 00:40:50.380, Speaker A: But guys, anything else that you wanted to share here? I feel like we just about covered everything but anything else that folks should know about B protocol and also to reminder to them they can follow B protocol here on Twitter. They can learn more about bprrotocolate.org per usual you have a discord. I'd recommend they hop into the discord and you can really start to get to know others that are involved in the community. And of course if you're a builder, check out their documents and hop on bprrotocol.org. But anything else that we should cover?
00:40:50.930 - 00:41:38.406, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we covered most of it. Definitely everyone is welcome to join the discord. Very engaged community. So definitely everyone is welcome both for any questions and discussions, support whatever you need, just hop on. Beside of that, I think the message is kind of clear. Norms are changing and solutions should follow the landscape where we are actually operating and having a flesh loan bot for your liquidation might not just be enough to actually keep your platform solvent.
00:41:38.598 - 00:42:22.406, Speaker A: I love I planned for us to talk for 20 minutes and we're at 40 minutes per usual, so always happens when I get to talk about something that I really believe in. I hope like I said, more take notice of what you guys are doing with B protocol. But Jerome Eton, thanks so much for your time. So good to get to catch up. I'd remind everyone then if enjoyed this, subscribe@defydad.com and also, if you are a talented builder building a badass money Lego like be protocol, please consider getting in touch with me and my team at Fourthrevolution Capital and otherwise. Guys, I'll end the broadcast here.
00:42:22.406 - 00:42:25.220, Speaker A: We'll be in a green room in a second. Thanks so much everyone. Have.
