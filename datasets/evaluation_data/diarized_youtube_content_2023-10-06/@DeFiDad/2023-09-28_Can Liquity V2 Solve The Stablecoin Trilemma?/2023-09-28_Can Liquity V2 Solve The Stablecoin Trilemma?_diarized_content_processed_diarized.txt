00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.440, Speaker A: We have the stablecoin with new properties, more scalable, better packed, and kind of with native defi yield because the reserve is staked eve, you know, and you get a yield on that, even a defi yield better than, I would say, kind of a centralized yield. Then you have this leverage product where you can participate in the leverage of the system, which is non liquidatable, hands off, no ongoing fees. And the third thing is then the borrowing experience, which will also be part of it.
00:00:36.730 - 00:01:27.714, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad and I'm here with my colleague and co host from Fourth Revolution Capital, nomadic. In this episode, we'll dive into what looks to be one of the most radically new decentralized stablecoin upgrades. Liquid Ev two two years after launching what most of us regard as the most decentralized, unstoppable stablecoin in DFI LUSD, and having issued over 4.5 billion worth of interest free loans, it was recently announced at ECC that liquidy is developing, quote, an alternative product that aims to crack the stablecoin trilemma. Today we'll get a first look at the mechanics and features behind Liquidy V two, including two critical innovations, one of those innovations being principal protection, a unique feature that keeps losses in check during market downturns. The other being a secondary market to minimize liabilities stemming from principal protection.
00:01:27.714 - 00:01:59.060, Speaker B: But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the Edge podcast possible.

00:02:01.510 - 00:02:40.670, Speaker C: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs, and today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account if we zoom out. Since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial rails.
00:02:43.990 - 00:03:25.550, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multichain UX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to Instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:03:26.370 - 00:03:50.566, Speaker B: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce Michael Sfobeda and Robert Lauko from Liquidy. Michael was CEO and COO at several blockchain companies previously, and no surprise, has a degree in computer science and economics. Robert is the founder of Liquidy and head of research. He, interestingly has a PhD in law and was previously a researcher at Definity. So let's kick it off. Michael and Robert, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:50.668 - 00:03:52.022, Speaker A: Great. Thanks for having us.
00:03:52.076 - 00:03:54.326, Speaker E: Hi, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here.
00:03:54.428 - 00:04:43.238, Speaker B: Hey, so thanks for joining us. We know you just got back from ethcc, I think a few weeks ago, and no surprise, ethcc was a huge success. We heard very typical sort of bear market Ethereum conference where there's lots of exciting innovations. And so one of the headlines to come out of that was about liquidity V two. Now, nomadic, and I have thankfully been users of liquidy for quite a long time, and so we're intimately familiar with all the nuances of V one. I want to really call out the fact before we even get started that liquidy has stood as a benchmark for DFI from a decentralization standpoint, from a censorship resistance standpoint. And so those immutable contracts will remain in V one.
00:04:43.238 - 00:05:06.538, Speaker B: But we're excited for some of these new innovations you're going to bring about with V two. And so I'd love to start with the usual about your guys background. Would love to hear the story of how the two of you got interested in crypto and of course, what led you ultimately here to working on liquidy. So maybe, Robert, do you want to go first and talk a bit about your background?
00:05:06.634 - 00:05:59.578, Speaker E: Sure, yeah. Thanks for the introduction, as you said, I mean, I started off as a lawyer. I even practiced a few years as a law clerk. But then when I kind of got aware of crypto, and more specifically when Ethereum was founded in my hometown in Zuk, where I live, or lived, used to live back then. It really captured my imagination, and I started delving deep and became kind of a blockchain researcher in my free time, because I always had a kid interested in technology, even before studying law. And then after a lucky chain of coincidence, I ended up working for Dfinity, which back then was a very small company with ten people. And I did various things there, worked on consensus algorithms, game theory, and other interesting parts, also appit operations.
00:05:59.578 - 00:06:36.086, Speaker E: And my last job there was basically to look into what can be built on top of a layer one blockchain. And that was like in 20, 18, 19, when D five was really in an early stage. And I became really interested and fascinated by those protocols like Ave and which used to be called Eastland, but also maker, and I just wanted to build my own stablecoin, which then became liquidity or version one. Yeah. And that was like at the end of 2019, when I basically quit my job and started founded liquidity together with my co founder, Rick, who is based in the UK.
00:06:36.198 - 00:06:36.474, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:36.512 - 00:06:40.986, Speaker B: Michael, what is your background? Prior to joining Liquidy, I worked in.
00:06:41.008 - 00:07:24.742, Speaker A: A large telecom company in Switzerland with a digital business and innovation team, and we consulted companies or internal teams on kind of the disruptive technologies. And once I saw the blockchain technology, I realized, okay, actually that's the only disruptive, really disruptive thing I see outside here. And I realized I'm going to miss it if I stay in such a large company. So that's why I quit. I found up my own startup back then, more geared towards traditional financial players. And then we soon realized this space is too slow, the traditional or institutional space. And then Defi summer came and we say, hey, that's the thing that's so much faster, so much more innovative.
00:07:24.742 - 00:07:51.246, Speaker A: You can roll out products globally. And then I heard about liquidity, and Robert grew up in the neighbor town of me, and I said, hey, wow, there is a Swiss Defi project, which is amazing. And we went for lunch, and then I realized that it's totally value aligned. That's what I still love about liquidity, how their decentralization ethos isn't great. And since then, always have been in love with liquidity.
00:07:51.358 - 00:08:01.686, Speaker F: So liquidity went live April 5, 2021. For those new to liquidy, maybe one of you can just describe what it is and what it does at a high level.
00:08:01.788 - 00:08:44.718, Speaker E: Sure. So, yeah, liquidity started off as a borrowing protocol in the first place, and as a stablecoin in the second, which means that we wanted to make borrowing as attractive as possible. And by borrowing, I mean collateralized borrowing. So people would bring their ether and they would take out the loan in our own stablecoin called the LUSD. And what makes this loan really special is basically the fact that the loan is interest free, and also that you can borrow up to 90% of your ether value, which makes it very capital efficient. And all this is kind of enabled by a novel way of liquidating loans, which kind of allows the system to give out more money against the same amount of collateral.
00:08:44.814 - 00:09:45.302, Speaker B: I want to mention that the last year has been just a continued reminder of why liquidity is designed the way it is. At least V one. Back in March 2023, there was a USDC DPeg, and there's a number of reasons for it. But during that time, LUSD continued to hold its dollar peg and at times was trading at a premium because it's seen as such a reliable, unstoppable, decentralized stablecoin. And then more recently, as much as all of us here are allies and love the Ave protocol, Ave and other protocols were going through some tough times with issues around curve, the CRV token as collateral. And so we saw interest rates spike. And so you have folks who have been enjoying pretty low interest rates as borrowers throughout most of the bear market.
00:09:45.302 - 00:10:12.154, Speaker B: And then we all got this reminder that interest rates can just, that they can go very high overnight just because of a really sort of simple event like what just happened with the curved collateral. So suddenly the idea of paying 0.5% as like a minting fee to open up a CDP with liquidy, suddenly that looks much more attractive.
00:10:12.282 - 00:10:49.638, Speaker A: I just wanted to touch what have we achieved since then. So, I mean, the protocol has been running autonomously because it's immutable. Since these two years, it issued more than 4.5 billion in loans. The stablecoin has around 300 million kind of market capitalization. It's the only major stablecoin without counterparty risk, because it takes decentralized collateral and has these immutable properties. And it was really great to see recently, as you said, one of the very few stablecoins that was growing in TVL.
00:10:49.638 - 00:11:11.890, Speaker A: And we also had an all time high in loan positions just recently. And even kind of even better or also nicer was that we recently got an A rating from Bluechip, which looked at different stablecoins and we were playing the same league, like Pexos stablecoin. I think that was really cool.
00:11:12.040 - 00:12:01.410, Speaker B: I just mentioned some of the events over the last year that again have served as a reminder of why liquid EV one is designed the way it is. Can you share any insights or reflections you had during that time as a team? I'm sure it was a somewhat confusing time, because none of us want to see other protocols, other stablecoins struggle. We want DeFi as a pie to grow. But I felt like it reinforced a lot of the decisions that were made that were not the easy road. Liquidity has always been about taking, I think, the harder road to ultimately growing the protocol, which actually, this will later lead into the exciting things about v two and making it more scalable.
00:12:01.830 - 00:12:38.078, Speaker E: Maybe if you look back, liquidity is now live for a bit more than almost two and a half years, and it has gone through a number of interesting situations. I mean, it all started with a flash crash. It was like just one month old, and it was like a 30% ease price drop in one day or something like that. And like 300 positions were liquidated. And that was the first big stress test for the system, because it handled it quite well. And then later on there were big redemptions. Some of them were kind of by accident, and the system could still cope with it.
00:12:38.078 - 00:13:26.842, Speaker E: And there were like a number of further occasions, like the collapse of terra Luna, and then also the FTX candle. And just this year, early this year, there was this latest problem with USDC and Silvergate and the banks that were behind it. And then all the stable coins lost value on that specific day, including LUSD, for some reason. But it recovered very quickly because it has this very strong redemption mechanism, which makes sure that it can always go up to $1 in value, at least relatively close to $1. So it was a proof of how resilient the system is under different market situations.
00:13:26.986 - 00:13:44.658, Speaker F: We want to get into V two today, but maybe just give us another quick overview of key features that exist in liquidity, V one as it is today, and maybe just break down this term CDP like collateralized debt position. Maybe speak to that a bit as well.
00:13:44.824 - 00:14:24.746, Speaker A: Sure. So, yeah, the value proposition of liquidity. I mean, liquidity, Robert built it maker was already there and he had great ideas how to make it better. And think there are three value propositions. That one is the interest freeness of the loans. Then the second thing, the high loan to value ratio. And the third part is kind of this really full decentralization, full stack decentralization from the code to the front end, which gives then LUSD, the stablecoin, these nice properties, so you are not exposed to centralized collateral or counterparty risk.
00:14:24.746 - 00:14:36.402, Speaker A: I think that together with the instant liquidation, which plays more to the loan to value ratio. These were the major innovations, I think, back then.
00:14:36.456 - 00:15:28.402, Speaker B: Yeah, so we were checking DeFi llama, and there's a part of it that shows forks, which. It's really interesting because you can see which protocols have been forked the most in DFI. And I believe that liquidity is like the 10th most forked protocol folks will remember in the last DFI bull run or the last crypto bull run. Uniswap was one of those protocols that kept getting forked. And just wondering, how do you feel about those liquidity forks? For example, we interviewed gravita recently, and they're looking to implement more liquid staked forms of ETH as collateral. We also interviewed Prisma, which I believe is also a fork of liquidy. But anyways, what are your thoughts on all these forks?
00:15:28.546 - 00:16:22.390, Speaker E: Well, in some way, being copied is the highest form of flattery, but of course it also depends a little bit on how you do it. I mean, there have been forks that were very value aligned and friendly, and they also improved upon some of liquid's key features. And I think Grabbit is a good example of that, because they came to us and they wanted to also collaborate and make sure that they are building something which is worthwhile. And that's like the kind of fords that we really appreciate. And that's also the reason that we put out our code base as not just being open source, but we didn't put in any restriction against copying it or modifying it. There are now like a bit more than 20 forks. Not every fork has the same set of innovations.
00:16:22.390 - 00:17:02.146, Speaker E: There are multiple ways or multiple things. What you could do as a fork. Some forks just went to another chain, which that's how it started. There were forks on L2s, but even on layer ones, some of them, they even just ported the code to rust and Solana, which is interesting because that takes quite some time and effort. And now the latest kind of trend amongst our forks is just that they would use some staked liquid stake derivative as collateral, because that's something we cannot offer. And I think that's like a natural extension in some way or another. Not sure.
00:17:02.146 - 00:17:03.490, Speaker E: Michael, what your.
00:17:03.560 - 00:17:39.118, Speaker A: Yeah. To add on that, I think it's even now the top three most forked project, mainly because of the staked ETH variant. So it's the dominant stablecoin design. I think Robert and then the founders that were there from the beginning created a really resilient approach, which is copied a lot, which is going back to the other question. A CDP based approach. So a collateral debt position. So the stable coin is minted against this debt position.
00:17:39.118 - 00:18:10.090, Speaker A: Somebody you said you had, I think also a loan. So somebody deposits ETH and then the stablecoin is minted against it. So that's a CDP based model maker is like that. And most other stablecoins are like that. And I think that's important because we will see with v two there, we are taking a completely, not completely new, but really another approach which has interesting opportunities, but also some challenges.
00:18:10.430 - 00:18:29.086, Speaker B: One of the terms that gets talked about in reference to liquidy is unstoppable or immutable. Would either of you care to explain what that means and why that is so integral to the design of liquidy v one, and I'm guessing v two as well.
00:18:29.188 - 00:19:17.114, Speaker E: Yeah. So the key idea there is that being mutable always adds some angle of uncertainty and it also adds an attack vector in some way or another. So we wanted to be as secure as possible, which kind of implied being as decentralized as possible. And we really wanted to make sure that decentralization doesn't stop at the protocol or core level. We also wanted to extend it to the front end, which I think we pioneered more or less like our decentralized front end approach. But I think the main or the part that's kind of the most, let's say contentious one, is that we cannot update our code in any way, so we cannot change or add more collateral assets. But that's like on purpose.
00:19:17.114 - 00:19:57.350, Speaker E: And it's now also one of the limitations of the current system. But it's also one of the big advantages, because pure ease is really the highest quality collateral that you can have, at least on Ethereum. And that's why also I think that V one will always have its role, it will always have its reason of existence, even with V two, because V two will be a bit different when it comes to collateral assets. But still we want to keep to our immutability principle. So even though it might have, let's say, a different type of collateral, it would still hopefully, I mean, that's what we are working towards, be immutable.
00:19:57.510 - 00:20:56.494, Speaker A: And to also add on that, why is that important? People say decentralized, unstoppable, why should users care? I think it's really because you get a different dollar, you hold a different dollar value that has other properties than if you would do with another stable coin or dollar on your bank. One is, there is no freezing blacklisting, of course, so you are always in control of your dollars. There is only ETH as a collateral asset, so no centralization risk. You can always redeem against ETH. So you don't have this counterparty risk. So you have kind of, I think, one of the soundest dollar, because it's non rockable, and I think that's the benefit then for the user. And I think sometimes that gets a bit missed, and that's also the reason why more and more people diversify their dollar holdings, not shifting, maybe everything, but just say, hey, it makes a lot of sense.
00:20:56.494 - 00:21:10.322, Speaker A: Not every dollar is born equal. So that I have different dollars in my portfolio, which I can use some over the banking rails, some I want to kind of have only backed by crypto asset and so on.
00:21:10.376 - 00:21:59.886, Speaker F: Gents, I think this transitions us nicely into v two. Just listening to your responses, just about the immutable nature of liquidity, V one is so fascinating. Just this idea of launching something into the wild that you can't change. It's just a wild concept, and then seeing what it does. So I think you've collectively all had the time to see what it's done, and I think you're all very proud of it. And it's become like a major force in DFI, as we've already touched upon. But with v two, what have you been thinking and what have you been cooking up? One thing actually, I think we should touch on first, is I was reading over your blog, the introducing liquid ev two, and you touched upon the stablecoin trilemma in crypto.
00:21:59.886 - 00:22:14.678, Speaker F: We love our trilemmas. We have many trilemmas, it seems, maybe break down for listeners. What is this stablecoin trilemma? What's on each end of this triangle, and how are you solving this with liquid Eb two?
00:22:14.764 - 00:22:54.034, Speaker E: Yeah, maybe let's start with the stablecoin trilemma, because it has multiple meanings or definitions. So what I will tell you is kind of my version of it. So please be aware of that. So I would kind of call three properties, the main properties that you want to achieve as a stablecoin, which are safety, decentralization, and scalability. Or safety in the sense of robustness, I should say. And what I mean there is, the stablecoin should not collapse. It shouldn't end up in a vicious or cycle where it would go down to zero.
00:22:54.034 - 00:23:48.498, Speaker E: So that's what I would call this safety or robustness aspect. And then by scalability, what I mean is that whenever there is demand for the stablecoin, or for more of the stablecoin, the system should be able to mint it and whenever this demand goes back, the system should be able to redeem it, which also implies a very strong peg, because now you can arbitrage it whenever it's above peg and also like an Arp situation whenever it's below. So that's like the second property of scalability. And then last but not least, decentralization, which is core to our DNA, which implies that nobody should have control over any part of the system. It should all be run by code in the end. That's kind of this decentralization aspect. And immutability is kind of the purest form of decentralization.
00:23:48.674 - 00:24:08.426, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to start to talk about the differences between the CDP system, that is in v one versus this new reserve backed system that you've described in V two. So, Michael, could you start to call out the differences between those two?
00:24:08.608 - 00:24:58.822, Speaker A: Sure, maybe. First, why are we shifting from such a good approach that everybody's copying? So, I mean, using staked ETH as a collateral, that's one new thing, but as we have seen, you can use liquidity for that. But as Robert mentioned, there are other limitations. The scalability directly being able to mint and redeem is not possible in the current approach. The peg is always also a bit an issue. So that's why we opened up and say, how can we improve on that? And that's why we looked into reserve backed stablecoins and think they offer some answers, but also have some challenges where we need then the innovation which we talk about. So as I said, a CDP based model, the stablecoin is minted against mostly at volatile collateral.
00:24:58.822 - 00:25:15.566, Speaker A: If in liquidity, V one's case, and this means the risk is with the borrowers. So you have this volatile asset, which is backing a stablecoin. That's a challenge. How do you handle that? And we won. Made it really easy. They just said, okay, I don't want to handle that problem. I give it to the borrower.
00:25:15.566 - 00:25:40.710, Speaker A: And if they don't handle it, they liquidated. So we're fine. And with reserve backed system, now, the stablecoin can be directly minted. So I deposit ETH or staked ETH into the protocol and get a stable coin back. I'm not opening a borrowing position. Yeah, sounds easy. But now who's owning the risk of the volatile asset? It's the protocol.
00:25:40.710 - 00:26:30.280, Speaker A: So the entire protocol has now the risk and needs to hedge itself. And we know reserve backed stablecoins, for example, USDC and USDT are reserve backed, just kind of with centralized collateral, with stable collateral. So that's not so difficult. But if we want to preserve the property of V one, we want to go for E, for staked ETH. And that's a volatile asset. So that makes it a bit more difficult. But maybe first, it's also a really nice opportunity, because if, as an if believer and staked ETH holder, if now the protocol holds this reserve, and you know what USDC is doing with its reserve, they're earning a lot of yield and pocket it themselves.
00:26:30.280 - 00:27:18.802, Speaker A: Now, think about it. If you create a protocol which takes the yield and distributes it to the users, and now, because you have even a volatile asset, kind of, if Eve goes up, the protocol can share the whole upside with the users. So instead of pocketing, you'll be at this big opportunity that Eve believers have a project where they can participate in the upside. Of course, they have also a role to then hedge the downside. And that was, or is still the difficulty. Why we haven't seen a lot of reserve backed stablecoin with a volatile asset that have really worked. But this is the difference from CDB based to reserve back with the great opportunities, the seniorage and fees, which we can redistribute, but also with the challenge which needs innovation.
00:27:18.802 - 00:27:26.714, Speaker A: And I think there, I leave it then to Robert to deep dive. But was that kind of setting the scene for you, or are there questions?
00:27:26.912 - 00:28:03.810, Speaker F: Yeah, that was great. If you can build what you just said, that sounds very exciting and something I think a lot of people are going to want to use. So, Robert, let's switch it over to you. Can you break down some of the things that Michael was talking about, maybe a little bit deeper? So in your blog, the two things that stood out to me is these two new major innovations coming to V. Two were this principal protected leverage and then the subsidized secondary market. Maybe walk us through what those are and how they achieve that vision that Michael described.
00:28:03.890 - 00:28:42.510, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. So let me start with leverage as a concept and how it fits into the whole picture of a reserve backed stablecoin. So, as Michael already mentioned, you have this reserve which is volatile in nature. So sometimes it needs less ether or less staked ETH assets to back the stablecoin supply, but sometimes it needs more. So this will be fluctuating. So you can think of it as a reserve which has a surplus, which can grow bigger or smaller. And in order to make sure that this surplus never becomes a deficit, you need to make sure that you have some other actor or user base which will act as hedgers.
00:28:42.510 - 00:29:39.602, Speaker E: So those who kind of hedge the reserve, they would see their balances go up or down, depending on the east price movement. And now the leverage part comes into play. Because if this surplus, or if the margin provided by those users is kind of small compared to the reserve, which can be bigger, then you are not just participating in your own kind of like benefiting, or participating in the price movements of the funds that you deposited, but you're kind of inheriting the price volatility of the reserve, which can be bigger. And that's where the leverage comes into play. So when east goes up, let's say by 10%, it may happen that your balance as a hedger goes up by 20%. And this leverage, and this is also important to note, is not fixed. So all people participating as hedging agents in the system will be pooled.
00:29:39.602 - 00:30:44.502, Speaker E: So they are all getting the same leverage, but the leverage will be changing over time. The system always tries to keep it within some range, which we still need to refine, but there is no hard guarantee that the leverage will always stay the same. So that's for the leverage part. And now where do we add principal protection to it? Or why do we even need it in the first place? The problem with leverage is that there are market situations where leverage is very attractive. Like people would want to get more of it, and the system would not be able to, not even be able to cater to anybody or everybody. But there are also situations in bear markets and crypto winter, where there is just not enough demand for leverage on ease, or staked ETH, for that matter. And that's why we wanted to improve upon the product by adding principal protection to it, which makes it much less crazy or dGen in some way, at least in those situations where people are a bit more erring on the risk averse side, it would become more attractive and just more all weather.
00:30:44.502 - 00:31:19.650, Speaker E: So that's one. And then, of course, principal protection also means that now your position would have like, kind of a fixed amount. We call this the principal. So you can think of it when you open it. Let's say you get a principal of ten staked ETH, and this will be kind of insured by the system, but your balance could go up and down, it can become five ETH, or 15 ETH, or 20 ETH. And of course, you would only want to claim this balance when it's much higher than the principal. When it's lower, you would never want to claim your principal.
00:31:19.650 - 00:32:31.450, Speaker E: So that's kind of in a nutshell, what this hedging position looks like. And maybe just one more addition to make it a bit more understandable, is that this principal protection has a price that the user will need to pay in some way, because now it's like investing in the upside of it, but being having a capped downside. And of course this is like an insurance and people would need to pay a premium for it. And that's why the system would kind of charge a premium, which is dynamically determined on top of the principal. To make a simple example, let's say you still want to open a position of a nominal or principal size ten, but maybe you need to pay twelve in total. So this two e's on top is basically the premium, but then you still have the ten ease or staked ease guaranteed in every market situation. But of course, now you are subject to this 2% difference, sorry, this two staked ease difference, which means that you got in with twelve ease in total, but you know that the system would make it so that you could at least get back ten staked ETH.
00:32:31.450 - 00:32:36.078, Speaker E: But of course it can be much more if the ease price goes up.
00:32:36.164 - 00:33:06.918, Speaker F: And I guess if I were to do a quick summary of this very simplified version, the way I read this, and from what you were saying, is with this principal protected leverage, you now have the ability to deposit your ETH collateral, not be exposed to downside risk of that ETH, but also maintain the exposure to. If ETH appreciates in value, you still maintain your upside with your underlying collateral. Am I getting that right?
00:33:07.004 - 00:33:51.138, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean, just one thing to make it a bit more precise, is that this downside protection is denominated in staked ease, which means that it's not guaranteeing you a dollar value, but it's guaranteeing you that you get at least some nominal amount back from the system when you need it. But your upside is unkept, your downside is kind of kept. It's not zero because you still may lose this premium in the worst case, but it's still much less scary than a normal, let's say, leverage that you would have on a perpetual futures platform where you can lose everything and you can even get liquidated. Here you cannot get liquidated because the principal protection always makes it so that you have this remainder.
00:33:51.234 - 00:34:45.318, Speaker B: That's still your Robert or Michael. Something that comes to mind when we talk about V two is. So there was a recovery mode which exists in v one, where if the entirety of the protocol was less collateralized, then that benefit of having higher LTV loans, being able to borrow, I think almost like $0.91 on the dollar against ETH. You'd have us as users rushing to pay back before it goes into recovery mode. Do any of these designs exist in V two, or do you foresee them playing into V two? Maybe even just the most obvious question of how much borrowing power will we have in V two? Or might you anticipate us having in V two?
00:34:45.484 - 00:35:31.880, Speaker A: Maybe just let's go one step quickly back. Liquidity, we won, as Robert said, was borrowing. First it was a borrowing protocol, and then you got a stable coin. With V two, it's a bit different. As we said, the reserve back there is first the stablecoin, and then on top, the protocol will also offer borrowing. So just to quickly outline the products that will be there, you will have the stablecoin with new properties, more scalable, better pack, and kind of with native defi yield, because the reserve is staked, know, and you get a yield on that, even a defi yield, better than, I would say, kind of a centralized yield. So that's one part of the product.
00:35:31.880 - 00:35:55.646, Speaker A: Then you have this leverage product where you can participate in the leverage of the system, which is non liquidatable, hands off, no ongoing fees. And the third thing is then the borrowing experience, which will also be part of it. But maybe Robert wants to add on that. Just wanted to clarify a bit how that works in V two for the.
00:35:55.668 - 00:37:01.150, Speaker E: Borrowing part, which is you can think of it as a subsystem of a larger system, which is both reserve backed, but also a lending protocol. So in this lending part, there will probably be some form of improved recovery mode, because, yeah, we have already identified some things that we may want to improve, but it will be probably relatively similar to how the recovery mode in V one works, with some improvements. So that's for one. But then coming back to the reserve aspect of the system there as well, we want to be on the safe side, which means we don't want to rely just on the hedging positions or on this leveraged product as the sole mechanism to hedge the reserve. So there will be more, there will be something similar to a stability pool, which would act as a fallback, and some other mechanisms as well. So we want to make the system really as sound and robust as possible. So we need a whole series of mechanisms that would kick in if one of them fails.
00:37:01.150 - 00:37:10.770, Speaker E: So in that kind of priority order, which is similar to what we already had or have in V one, with multiple ways of liquidation and the recovery mode.
00:37:10.850 - 00:37:54.546, Speaker F: Can I just jump in real quick? I think an important thing to note too, is that there will be a different stablecoin. This won't be LUSD, this will be a new issued stablecoin. And I think before we hopped on, you guys gave a good example just about how this is different than liquidity v one. So this is like think of liquidity v one as uni v two, and think of v two as uni v three, if that makes sense. And because the immutable contracts of liquid ev one, you do in fact need to issue a new stablecoin here. So just so people aren't under the assumption that this will be LUsd, still.
00:37:54.648 - 00:38:55.702, Speaker B: One of the hottest sectors of DfI has been Lst phi, which refers to ETH liquid stake tokens. And so one of the things that stood out for anyone reading that v two post is just that v two will be able to support ETH LST. And so I'm just starting to think as a user of this in the future, so I know that it will be accepted into this reserve backed system, I guess. Can you tell us any more about how you're thinking of how the yield will be used? And then maybe even talk a bit about. I read something in the blog post about the ability to dynamically leverage ETH LSDs, where users can go long on ETH with no recurring cost and with built in mechanisms for principal protection. Anyways, if you can kind of just dumb down, like how are ETH LSTs playing into V two?
00:38:55.836 - 00:39:52.614, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the main thing is that now a liquidity like system can take these LSTs as a collateral and you can mint a stable coin or you can borrow against it. I think that's the main thing. Something a lot of people said, love liquidity, but said, I would like to use our liquid staked version. And yeah, where is the yield going through? I mean, the first thing, as I said, with a reserve backed system, you have this reserve which like for USDC, what a great business model. And now you have this yield and you can use it exactly to align the incentives of these ETH believers to, for one thing, hedge the protocol. But then also if they hedge, give them the upside or attract all these fallback mechanisms that Robert mentioned, like the stability pool. Now, if you stake your stablecoin, you get native yield.
00:39:52.614 - 00:40:40.070, Speaker A: You can use that as a collateral asset. So we use, for example, use the yield for that to make the system resilient. Because overall that was the challenge of all previous system. And there has been some angle is if you need to hedge, there are two challenges. The timing. When do you need the hedging and the cost. So the innovation on the liquidity side, if you look then into the detail, is really how can you take that risk and kind of make it more attractive for users, or catering to another need, or creating interesting products that reduce the cost and make the timing in stressed situation, not kind of make the period longer where you can hedge.
00:40:40.070 - 00:40:45.786, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't know, Robert, if you want to add on that, or if that answered your question, as you.
00:40:45.808 - 00:41:45.358, Speaker E: Said, I mean, we have a variety of ways of kind of splitting and distributing the yield, which is a nice feature or a nice positive side effect of using an LSD as collateral for the reserve. Yeah. So we are still kind of optimizing some of the parameters there, but it seems that some split would work best because we need multiple players to be incentivized, not just the hedging agents, but also people who would deposit the stablecoin to the stability pool, which again has the nice effect that now you have a built in yield source for the stablecoin, at least those who are willing to take some risk and back the stablecoin, they would get a nice, probably even amplified yield, which is coming from the underlying east staking, which I guess is something we have seen now from Libra. And it has been quite popular, I think, among the users. And, yeah, that's something which will be possible in our system, too.
00:41:45.444 - 00:42:02.900, Speaker B: So if this all works as expected or as designed, let's talk about it's 2024 and we're in a parabolic sort of bull run. What do you expect to see then from liquid Ev two?
00:42:03.270 - 00:42:48.962, Speaker E: Yeah, it's hard to anticipate, but let me try. So when east goes up, I mean, we are in a proper bull run. It would mean that the system would not need any more hedging agents because it will be collateralized sufficiently so that at some point it would not even try to attract more hedging agents. Like the leveraged product would not be sold anymore, or at least be sold at a very high price. Because, yeah, when you have enough, when you don't need to kind of urgently hedge your system, that's a nice problem to have. And then probably the system would even be able to produce some surpluses which are not even needed to back the whole system. Like it's in a very good shape, maybe even too good to secure the system.
00:42:48.962 - 00:43:30.126, Speaker E: So that's something to keep to be aware of. Yeah. And then also the yield would still kind of capture it in the system. And probably the yield may also go up when the whole markets go up. So that's really the positive scenario. But yeah, at least what we can also expect that at some point the hedging agents would close their positions, because what they would normally do when their balances go up, due to this inherent leverage, at some point they would want to cash out. So they don't need the principal protection any longer.
00:43:30.126 - 00:43:48.626, Speaker E: They have already made a nice profit, so they would eventually want to quit the system, which is perfectly okay, because the system, let's say, still has like 300% whatever collateralization, so it can afford to kind of pay out the gains that have been accumulated in those positions.
00:43:48.738 - 00:44:32.946, Speaker A: And I think that's the important part. Everybody that is hatching the protocol or helping in a bull market will benefit, because now the surplus that the protocol is holding goes to everybody in the ecosystem. Contrast that to USDC, which also have some bitcoin kind of backing. If it goes up, it's great for them. And here it's kind of different that we say, okay, now we have 300%, we don't need so much, so we can give back. Hey, you took a risk, so that's the nice thing in the bull market. And how can you participate? Let's say you have ETH and staked ETH in your portfolio, then maybe in the future, you say part of my staked ETH, I put it into the system.
00:44:32.946 - 00:45:14.510, Speaker A: I think I believe in the increase of staked ETH. I deposit it there, and if my assumption is right, I can benefit. And if not, I should at least keep my staked ETH amount by paying for this bet. So that's really the lucky case. And probably we need also to look into the less lucky case, because, I mean, everybody is interested and just kind of wondering, okay, is this a ponzi? Can we create stuff out of thin air? And happy to look into that, how this works and what also the assumptions are. It's important to know the assumptions because the risk profile, as I said, is a bit different with liquidity. V one, we can say V one will always be more resilient.
00:45:14.510 - 00:45:20.414, Speaker A: V two has the yield of stake DF, but also some additional risks.
00:45:20.542 - 00:45:45.686, Speaker B: Which combos that, guys, could we now do the same sort of prediction or forecast for being in a downtrend? Let's assume a bull market has played out and the price of ETH has fallen, or is in free fall with everything else, 50, 60, 70%. What do we expect to see from this new V two liquidity?
00:45:45.798 - 00:46:32.886, Speaker E: Yeah, a number of mechanisms and user behaviors will probably play into the whole system. So, first of all, the protocol will try to keep its collateralization level at a target ratio. And in order to do that, it would kind of sell, or try to sell more hedging products by making them cheaper. It has a built in controller, which you can think of as an auction, a continuous dutch auction, in a sense. So what the system can do, it can kind of decrease the price. Like this premium that people pay when they open a position, to make the positions more attractive. So that's, let's say, the number one mechanism that would kick off when there is a downturn.
00:46:32.886 - 00:47:13.442, Speaker E: But then secondly, also, people would not want to close their positions when they are underwater. So you don't want to claim, of course you don't want to claim your balance, which could become smaller than your principal. So eventually what could happen is that your current balance of your position becomes tiny compared to your principal. And now you wouldn't expect to be able to sell this position on the secondary market, just as is, because maybe nobody would even pay the principal for it. Because we are in a very difficult market scenario. And that's where the second big innovation of the system would start, which is the subsidy mechanism. And this is pretty unique.
00:47:13.442 - 00:47:54.546, Speaker E: I don't think any other protocol has tried or built something like that. So instead of paying out the principal protection at once, like just SEs directly to the user, we cannot do that because that might become dangerous for the system. Because the system might not have enough funds to kind of serve everybody's principal protection request, at least not at the same time. But the protocol can do something else. It basically allows you to list your position on the built in secondary market. And then you would list this position at the principal. So you had like this position of ten where, let's say your current balance is only two or one.
00:47:54.546 - 00:48:40.834, Speaker E: And now you would try to sell it for ten, which is the principal. But you may not be able to do so because maybe nobody would buy it. Then there is a timeout period, maybe a few days, after which the protocol would step in and gradually increase your balance. So the balance would go up from one to two to three and so on. And there should be a point at which somebody would buy the position for the ten. So the protocol only needs to spend as much ease or staked ease until somebody takes it for the given price, which is a very nice feature because it allows the system to cut down on its cost a lot. So, first of all, you don't need to subsidize all the positions at the same time.
00:48:40.834 - 00:49:31.506, Speaker E: You have this timeout and time delay, which kind of spreads them out, making it less of a strain for the system. And then secondly, you also need to subsidize to a fraction of the current balance or the principal. You don't need to pay the full principal amount. And those two features in Tomdam should make sure that the system is able to finance the subsidies when needed. But hopefully you would rarely need them if ever, because that would only be an issue when people, they are not valuing this principal protection. They are not kind of factoring in any time value, as you call it in option literature or option terminology. They will not value the fact that you have the principal, but you also have a bet on top.
00:49:31.506 - 00:49:58.442, Speaker E: So if this time value kind of completely goes away, that's the point where the system would need to pay out subsidies, but most of the time for most of the positions that are either in the green or just not too deep in the red. So to say they will need a subsidy, because people could sell them on the secondary market just for the price they want to sell them, or at least for the principal, without needing any subsidies at all.
00:49:58.576 - 00:50:47.702, Speaker A: With the hedging, we have like a collective coverage with this principal protection. And of course, the money needs to come from somewhere, and it can't be unlimited. We are not magicians. If ETH goes to zero, probably it's not possible, like with an insurance, insurance or protection gives you some guarantee. But there's the point when a meter crashes the earth, probably you're not covered. So what we do is that we say, hey, we have enough people that believe in ETH and an asset, and if it goes up, so based on this assumption, that over the long run and with kind of some volatility, we believe in that we can create such a reserve backed stablecoin, which is resilient. But it needs to be under this assumption.
00:50:47.702 - 00:51:14.820, Speaker A: If we all think it only goes down, yeah, sure, it doesn't work. You don't need to be a mathematician to figure that out. So the key thing is how to design it to attract the users. And in such a way that kind of Eve, over its time can handle that. And then we can participate in the upside. And now people may still think, but I think that's a ponzi and never would I do that. And then I just say, you are already in such a system.
00:51:14.820 - 00:51:57.902, Speaker A: The pension system is similar. I'm paying now, people taking money out, and I believe that there will be more people that will kind of pay my pension. And honestly, I rather have my pension system in Eve, where I think more people are coming in, I'm more confident that the eve will be worth more than my dollars. So I will position it as an alternative to that. And then I think it really becomes feasible when people understand that. But I think, just to be fair, I mean, these are the assumptions you need to be willing to take. And then I think it's a great system, but we just wanted to highlight that for users.
00:51:57.966 - 00:52:54.820, Speaker F: I think those assumptions you're making are very in line with the users, which is obviously the best way to build a product. I can already see the product market fit for people that denominate in ETH and are long ETH. So appreciate you guys going way over. You just keep snowballing more questions into my head. One thing I've been thinking of sitting here is obviously you've said V Two is maybe scheduled for some time, Q two 2024. And I want to ask you both, as creators of this, is there worry if copying more forks, are you worried about letting some of the innovation out of the bag early? And I'm also curious if you'd ever introduce anything like what uni v three did with some sort of license, will you accept the forks, which sound like they could be inevitable from what I'm hearing you building right now. How do you think through all these things?
00:52:55.190 - 00:53:51.846, Speaker E: Maybe to your first point, and then I'll let Michael maybe chime in on the forks. But for the first part, I mean, just putting out innovation or talking about what we are doing, even though we are still ahead of time, like almost a year until the planned launch date. I think, first of all, we want to include the community. We want to get their insights, their criticisms, and see what they think about the product. So that's why we are doing it. And we are not really afraid of being copied at this stage because we realize that what we are building is very ambitious and we have already some head start because we have been working on it for more than half a year and in some sense almost a year when the first idea kind of came about of this reserve backed stable coins. So we have already done a lot in the past and there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome, which we are now working on.
00:53:51.846 - 00:54:07.980, Speaker E: So it's an intense phase still, even though we have started implementing it and we have made quite some progress with the prototype, but still there are open research questions as well. So we are not so afraid of being copied at this stage. At least I am not.
00:54:08.590 - 00:54:42.790, Speaker A: Yeah. And I mean, what I realized is, as I haven't been there from the beginning for liquidity, how complex it is, how much you need to look into that, model it to really come up with a new system. And honestly, we haven't seen a lot of new system. You have uniswap innovation curse is innovating, but there aren't so many teams and you need really a lot of special skills. And I think that's the beauty of the liquidity team. It's still the initial team. Over all these years, it has built their first stable coin and went through all the perks you need to think about.
00:54:42.790 - 00:55:10.874, Speaker A: We did chicken bond and this helps us now a bit. You have also this bonding, which needs to be sticky. So now we're connecting the dots. So I think a lot of people underestimate that and why we are open. It's a community effort. We can create here our collective stablecoin, and we want to do that in an honest way and also win the community as users, but also to make the system better. We really believe in that approach.
00:55:10.874 - 00:55:26.226, Speaker A: That's why we also said, let's do that together and do it like that. And I think that's something. Yeah, you can copy just the code, but the other things is difficult and we took this bet.
00:55:26.408 - 00:55:58.126, Speaker B: Okay, so before we wrap up, I've got a few rapid fire questions. Most of them are just yes or no type questions, but this is meant to be kind of like the TLDR for folks who are just digging into V two. So, first off, we talked about the fact that the stablecoin of V two will be a new stablecoin. It won't be the same as V one's Lusd, but I wanted to double check. Will the contracts of V two, will those be non upgradable like V one?
00:55:58.228 - 00:56:13.438, Speaker E: I would say for 99%, yes. There is still a chance that we may have to admit that some parameters would be upgradable for some at least period of time. But that's not what we are aiming for. We are aiming for full immutability.
00:56:13.614 - 00:56:48.766, Speaker B: I understand that nuance. Like, there's a lot that's experimental about this new system. And as excited as we are, given all the challenges that we've all lived through in DFI, I would imagine that we're going to be learning a lot from this system and then get to a truly immutable, non upgradable version of the protocol. Okay, then next, V two will support ETH and liquid staked ETH. Are you able to tell us which forms of liquid staked ETH or is that kind of up in the air still.
00:56:48.948 - 00:57:28.602, Speaker A: That's still up in the air. So we're looking into that, honestly, that's also one of the limitation for immutability and decentralization. Not only is our system new, but the ecosystem of these liquid staking tokens is also new and moving fast. And we haven't seen yet kind of the degree of decentralization like liquidity, which we would like to see. So there we are, looking into the space and seeing how it evolves. I think their time plays kind of in our favor. So we are deferring that decision a bit and just working on the other parts because we see great movements and improvements in the space.
00:57:28.602 - 00:57:31.646, Speaker A: So we focus right now on the other questions.
00:57:31.828 - 00:57:51.682, Speaker B: In liquidity, V one, we can borrow like 91 LUSD against $100 of ETH collateral. Do we know what that LTV will look like in V two? Or is there an anticipated number in terms of that borrowing power?
00:57:51.816 - 00:58:27.386, Speaker E: I mean, we are aiming to reduce that number, and we have been kind of using 105% internally. Now, that's not set in stone yet, but it seems that just from the information we got, like from past liquidations on V one, it seems that 110% is rather on the upper end. So it would have probably worked well with less, but we still want to be on the safe side. So probably it will be substantially less than 110%. Whether it will be 105, we don't know yet. Our modeling and simulations haven't been finalized at this stage.
00:58:27.498 - 00:58:34.174, Speaker B: Got it. And just to clarify, so you're saying we could potentially have more borrowing power in V two?
00:58:34.292 - 00:58:42.546, Speaker E: Yes. Lower collateralization means a higher LTV, which would mean maybe you can borrow 95 or 96%.
00:58:42.728 - 00:59:07.094, Speaker B: And then in v one, we have the stability pool, which is like a very well known major component of V one. And all of the forks of V one, does that still exist in any form in V two, or is it no longer needed because of this new reserve back system and the secondary market? That would be like new innovations.
00:59:07.222 - 00:59:33.786, Speaker E: So most probably there will be a stability pool, and it seems that it would have a W. So it would back both the reserve as a fallback, and it would also back the loans as a primary liquidation mechanism. So it would have this kind of hybrid role in the system, because it's a concept that has proven to work quite well. So we don't want to get rid of it without any replacement. So, yes, most likely.
00:59:33.898 - 00:59:52.218, Speaker B: And then lastly, when someone deposits collateral into V two and they go to borrow, would we expect then for there to be this similar upfront fee and that we would still have an interest free loan while we open that position.
00:59:52.384 - 01:00:38.354, Speaker A: Okay, I can take it. Yes. So the borrowing experience should be really similar. Interest free is something we think was a great innovation, which we want to keep a higher loan to value ratio. And maybe we look also into something gravita has pioneered, even having this dynamic one of fees to make short term borrowing more attractive. And that's a good example of these friendly forks kind of really also innovating on the product and not just copying it on another chain or exchanging the collateral. I think they made some really thoughtful changes and that's really a good one because liquidity is really cheap for mid to long term borrowing, but for short term borrower, it wasn't.
01:00:38.354 - 01:00:39.082, Speaker A: So far.
01:00:39.216 - 01:01:11.250, Speaker B: This feels like cracking like some holy grail within DFI. So we'll all be excited for this to hopefully come out in Q 2024. So I want to start to wrap up then and a few reminders to folks who are wanting to follow Robert and Michael. So first on Twitter, you can follow robert. At Robert underscore lauko, you can follow Michael. His is Svobada Michael. It's just last name first, then first name.
01:01:11.250 - 01:01:45.290, Speaker B: We'll flash those on screen. We've also got, of course, liquidy protocol. The mothership account on Twitter is liquidy protocol. We'll put those links in the show notes so you don't pick up any of the duplicate scam accounts out there. Most importantly, you should learn more about liquidy@liquidy.org. That's the best place to get started and to learn about the decentralized front ends that allow for using liquidy. I'll point out some of our favorites are instadap and defi saver.
01:01:45.290 - 01:02:29.174, Speaker B: They just give you so many powerful options with flash loan recipes. Anyways, you can really get the fullest capabilities out of liquidy by using a front end like that. Guys, I want to give you the last word first. Thank you for taking the time to talk us through all of this. Nomadic and I again, we felt pretty challenged trying to even figure out the questions to ask you. So we appreciate you actually answering those, those difficult questions and then anything else you'd like to share about what we should be looking ahead for in 2024 or even just how to get involved in the liquidity protocol?
01:02:29.302 - 01:03:02.082, Speaker E: Yes, so this was an awesome discussion. Thanks a lot. I really enjoyed it. And yeah, as to your question, we are intensely working on many things, and we are also working on content and some documentation about the system. So we are working on it in parallel and on multiple pieces at the same time, so please be patient. But I guess we will be able to share more very soon and then hopefully some of the concepts would also become clear to the reader.
01:03:02.226 - 01:03:30.810, Speaker B: Robert Michael, please come back when V Two is launched. We would love to do an updated podcast. Then that way we can actually show what V two looks like once it's live, and kind of walk through the different scenarios that we all expect to see as users of the protocol. Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital.
