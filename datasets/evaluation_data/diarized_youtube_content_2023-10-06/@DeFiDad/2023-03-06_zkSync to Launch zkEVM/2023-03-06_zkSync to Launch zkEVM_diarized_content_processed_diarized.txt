00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.714, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, I'm d five dad. I'm here at East Denver.
00:00:02.762 - 00:00:09.150, Speaker B: I'm joined by Anthony Rose, who's the head of engineering at ZK Sync. Anthony, what prompted you to join the team a year ago?
00:00:09.220 - 00:00:46.282, Speaker C: So I've been following the space since postdoc. Back in 2013 when I first read the bitcoin white paper, my interest like ebbed and flowed a little bit over the years. But sort of two years before enjoying math labs, I was just deep in the weeds of Ethereum and know I'd spend all day at work, had a pretty intense job, and then you come home and you're spending like 2 hours a day reading white papers or playing with. Yeah, you know, I just felt like it was time to move into the space and yeah, for me, if we are really going to see the potential that I think we believe in the technology, we have to solve the scalability problem.
00:00:46.416 - 00:00:47.866, Speaker B: Anthony, so how do you think about.
00:00:47.888 - 00:00:51.658, Speaker A: The impact of zk roll ups on DFI in 2023?
00:00:51.744 - 00:01:12.194, Speaker C: For me, I think 2023 is going to be the year of the ZK roll ups. We're seeing a lot of these systems coming to fruition. Very exciting time for us because era is here. It's on main net. We've powered the food truck experience at East Denver with the system running on main net. But for DFI, I think adoption is time for adoption on these systems. Right.
00:01:12.194 - 00:01:43.174, Speaker C: We've got a lot of work left to do. These systems are complex. There's lots more work to be done. But to engage now is to sort of getting on the ground floor. As the systems mature, as the technologies develop and protocols application developers, they can start to leverage this execution environment for high transaction throughput and low fees. And I think for DeFi protocols, like reducing the cost of using the systems is going to just start to really open up the space for more users and new interesting use cases as well.
00:01:43.232 - 00:01:50.766, Speaker A: So, Anthony, what is the next milestone we can look forward to in terms of zk sync? Going live with this Zke EVM, the.
00:01:50.788 - 00:02:22.790, Speaker C: Next milestone is the big one. We deployed the system back to mainnet in a closed fashion just for us and some security partners back in October of last year. About three weeks ago now, two, three weeks ago, we opened the system for developers to deploy their applications. This is ongoing. And in a couple of weeks now, three, four weeks now, as soon as we're through one more security audit, the system opens for users. So we're right on the threshold. We've had users at East Denver testing the system on Mainnet and in a couple of weeks, it'll be open to the entire world.
00:02:22.790 - 00:02:24.020, Speaker C: So this is the big one.
