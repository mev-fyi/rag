00:00:03.930 - 00:01:03.374, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi dad. Hey, everyone. It is Monday, January 31, 2022, and I'm here with Alexander Wu, who is the co founder of Utopia Labs. We're going to continue with, we'll say it's an unintentional series on Dow tooling. So last week we got to talk with the folks from Syndicate Dao about how you can create investment clubs on chain with syndicate. And today we're going to focus on a use case that is badly needed for all dows. If dows are, I actually just tweeted something like this.
00:01:03.374 - 00:01:35.980, Speaker A: But if dows are the future Digital LLC, which I think we all believe them to be, if you're here in web three, it's going to be necessary for you to be able to run, call it a payroll, whatever it is, you need to be able to pay your contributors to the Dow. And so I'm excited to kind of walk through Utopia with Alex. They just launched their beta Dap, which allows you to run payroll and also manage expenses. So, Alex, thanks for joining me. Congrats on the launch. How are you doing?
00:01:36.430 - 00:02:05.714, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, it's been great. We just launched today and it's just been a pretty busy week last week trying to get some last minute things shipped and make the product really good. But yeah, I think we're pretty comfortable. I think we're all really proud of where the product is today. We've been kind of building kind of private beta over the past few months, working with the Q key customers and really getting their insights and iterating on that. And now I think it's in a really good place where I think a lot of dows can find a lot of value out of it.
00:02:05.714 - 00:02:08.058, Speaker B: So that's why I kind of launched it publicly.
00:02:08.254 - 00:02:22.380, Speaker A: You have to remind me, when did you guys all come together as co founders and start working on this? Because it feels like it was yesterday, but it was, I mean, gosh, does it go back to the summer 2021 or fall?
00:02:22.910 - 00:02:36.814, Speaker B: Yeah. Honestly, it feels like everything has gone super fast. We officially started beginning of September last year, so it's only been around four months, really, that we've been kind of building together.
00:02:37.012 - 00:02:56.770, Speaker A: That's it. I'm going to say it's unique, but it's a story that we're all familiar with where a number of you dropped out of school to work on this. Tell me more about your background and your co founders and how you guys got started on utopia.
00:02:57.190 - 00:03:46.494, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So what kind of happened was we got connected through a bunch of hackathons and a bunch of neutrals kind of introduced us together. So we started building things at hackathons, various hackathons throughout the year, and we just kind of really enjoyed building with each other and enjoyed jamming on new ideas. So after a couple of hackathons, we still kind of stayed in touch. We would talk maybe once a week, and then as things got more, I guess, more developed, we started talking twice a week and then three times a week and then every other day and then every day to the point where we were super passionate about building something together and kind of exploring deeper into dows. And, yeah, I think we were all super committed to this idea. And then once we actually raised, we all had the conviction and to just kind of all jump ship from what we were doing previously.
00:03:46.494 - 00:04:05.020, Speaker B: So previously Kaido, Price, and I were in school, so we all took that leap and set to drop out. And Jason was previously working at Big Tech, and he also took that leap and kind of left that job to join us, too. So, yeah, it's a lot of just kind of jumping feet first into web three.
00:04:07.790 - 00:04:43.654, Speaker A: Tell me a little bit about your guys background in terms of crypto. I'd love to know. You're all very young. At least you're young relative to me. Tell me more about what was, I guess, your entry into crypto, what kind of drew you in? Because it's important to, I think, highlight everyone's story around this. You have to always remind yourself this space is about continually growing the pie, luring more developers and builders into the space. But, yeah.
00:04:43.654 - 00:04:47.830, Speaker A: Do you recall how you or any of your other co founders got into crypto?
00:04:48.570 - 00:05:39.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us, for me personally, I started going more into crypto in 2017, 2018 during that kind of bull run. And I was kind of learning more like doing the tech, but it was mostly kind of just like speculation and the day trading and whatnot. I think Jason and Kaido and Price had similar things. I think they might have been more into the tech as well. But then I guess over after that bull cycle ended, I guess just got caught up with other things, with other tech and other schools and whatnot. And then I guess recently, I think it's mostly during DeFi summer where I think I became very interested in this application again, just because I saw some real kind of impactful tech through a lot of the D five protocols that exist today. And I was like, okay, I think there's actually a lot of potential in this.
00:05:39.174 - 00:06:21.560, Speaker B: And started digging more into what the entire world of web three means and all these different technologies and all these different applications, and that's kind of how I came to get involved in it. But I think Price, Jason, and Kaido have similar stories as well in terms of timeline. But I think all of us really share this belief of we want to open up these opportunities to kind of everyone in the world. I think in web three, it's a very decentralized, very open space for people to join. There aren't that many bearers as there are with traditional financial institutions in terms of getting a credit card approved or something like that. So, yeah, I think that's why we're all really passionate about space. We kind of really want to open up this opportunity to as many people as possible.
00:06:22.890 - 00:07:44.274, Speaker A: Alex, tell me more about when did you guys have this idea for utopia? Because I want to remind everyone that while it's January 2022, I think if you went back to just the summer 2021, which is just like six months ago, we were starting to see more joining Dows because DFI had grown a lot, especially since summer 2020 and before that. But then also we were seeing like a growth within the NFT community. And I'm going to broadly paint everything as a dow here. Obviously, some of these are discords where it's not truly a DAO, but we'll just call them decentralized communities. And then within those decentralized communities, like a business, you start to see certain contributors rise up in this space and become like full time contributors who rightfully need to make a living. And that actually was pretty foreign to most in the space until, I want to say it feels like it was like a quarter ago. Suddenly there were more dows that were officially launching, more committing to working full time for dows than ever before.
00:07:44.274 - 00:08:22.460, Speaker A: And I even want to say there's credit that should be given to some within the community who really framed that 2021 having been an exciting year for NFTs and DFI, that 2022 would be more about the rise of dows, which is something I think we've all heard for many years. It seems like it's finally coming true. So I do recognize that you guys have been a little bit ahead of the curve. Anyways, tell me more about how did you come up with this idea? I guess what was the light bulb moment that, hey, we should be building this thing.
00:08:22.990 - 00:09:08.220, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think you put it in a really great way of thinking about it because I think, I think the blockchain and technology has applications in many different areas. Right. We've seen kind of that in currencies, in crypto, but he's also seen in financial tools, in Defi, and now digital ownership and NFTs. And I think that, at least for us, we were really looking at, I feel like its impact on cooperation was still very nascent when we started to get into it. But we definitely saw a potential for it to kind of change the way we do things, especially given the fact that we can kind of maybe have a turn complete machine in terms of governance, in terms of operations and what that impact looks like. I think we're still trying to figure that out, but I do think there's a lot of potential in that space.
00:09:08.220 - 00:10:24.306, Speaker B: So how we kind of started the company was basically, we were just talking to a lot of Das because we were just very curious about what they were doing and how they were operating and trying to see if there's any part we can play to help them scale better, help them be more efficient, kind of provide an infrastructure layer or some support for them. And as you mentioned earlier, dows kind of are definitely on a spectrum of decentralized versus centralized crypto native versus kind of like traditional companies that use crypto as that's it. So what we notice is, across any of these spectrums, it seems like all dows had trouble with paying people, which was kind of surprising. And that's kind of like how the MVP of our product came to take form, really. It was just the fact that all these dows who have maybe billions of dollars locked in value and paying these tens of contributors, they were still using Google sheets or having some way complex, frictionful process where one person needs to dedicate like 10 hours at the end of the month to pay everyone. And that just seemed super inefficient to me. And it seems like we could design a very easy product that can help tackle that issue.
00:10:24.306 - 00:10:49.450, Speaker B: That's kind of where our first entrance into the space, and we just kind of, kind of build a solution for that and sort of onboarding a lot of dows, and they found it useful, too. So we kept on iterating, kept on building the product until where we have now, where we think it's a really good way to pay your contributors instead of having to track multiple Google sheets and coordinate with people and send ten different discord messages. I think we built a pretty easy solution.
00:10:50.290 - 00:11:48.560, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny to me that there's parallels to the old world of software that are very familiar for me. And I worked with project management software in the past, and even softwares that would handle payroll. And it's just a huge market. I mean, globally, there's so many different softwares and so much competition amongst those softwares to serve. We'll just say businesses, whether it's a small business or like an enterprise. And it's nuts because I have to say, I never fully believed that dows would replace all of that until more recently. As much as I'm on the bandwagon, clearly here, I believe web three is the future.
00:11:48.560 - 00:13:06.822, Speaker A: Until recently, I always sort of question that, or like maybe it's way farther out. But once you start to see people working together no matter where they are in the world, and having to rely upon cryptocurrencies and having to rely upon the trust to be able to be paid for their time and effort by a tokenized community, suddenly you start to realize, hey, there's some new primitives here, but a lot of the same sorts of concepts exist. One of the most important resources is just people, and they have a scarce amount of time. And so you have to ultimately pay those contributors for that time. It feels like now any protocol that's launching, I'm thinking, all right, well, you're going to have a core team, right? To me, a core team is just whoever spends their full time sort of working on the protocol. And those core team members are going to expect to get paid unless I guess, they're co founders and hold some unimaginable amount of tokens. So, yeah, it's a use case that I'm hoping more here.
00:13:06.822 - 00:13:50.706, Speaker A: Discover just by watching us live stream or screen share the dap in a second. Because if you're paying out of a spreadsheet or if you're just keeping notes, it's just a very disorganized way to operate something. Know, obviously in some cases, controls humongous. So I guess, Alex, do you think now is a good time to start screen? Like, I'd love to walk through the dap also too, we might start off on just the home page just to kind of like walk through what's there. Actually, I take that back. Just hop into the page. The home page doesn't.
00:13:50.706 - 00:13:54.230, Speaker A: I don't think it has anything else that you wouldn't see in the dap.
00:13:54.810 - 00:13:58.950, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I'm sharing my screen right now. Just let me know if you can see that.
00:13:59.100 - 00:14:00.730, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah, here we go.
00:14:00.800 - 00:14:01.034, Speaker B: Cool.
00:14:01.072 - 00:14:14.590, Speaker A: Okay. In case anyone wants to follow this, this is@utopialabs.com but yeah, kind of walk us through what we're looking at here. And then when you switch, I'll just make sure that we're still screen sharing the Dap.
00:14:15.010 - 00:14:56.870, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So this is our kind of home page, and I'll kind of give you a demo of what the actual app looks like. So as with most apps, we use wallet sign in, so you'll be able to authenticate through your wallet only. And once you choose the Nosisafe that you want to be associated with your DAO, you're kind of presented with our core product here. I think maybe one flow that we've noticed a lot of DAOs have is this idea of getting payment requests. And we kind of saw that a lot of DAOs have this really complicated process. They would have some maybe airtable form that they fill out or Google form, or maybe they just DM on Discord and they log in in a spreadsheet.
00:14:56.870 - 00:15:32.370, Speaker B: And to us that was very frictionful. So we designed this kind of process where you can kind of share this link with anyone. You can paste it in your discord, and once you visit this link, you'll be able to actually submit a request. So our Dow is named, used for mainnet test, unfortunately. But this would have your Dow name here and you can go ahead and submit some sort of request for any contributor. Yeah, I'll just go on ahead and fill this form. And one thing as well we've been able to support is this idea of having kind of fiat based amounts.
00:15:32.370 - 00:16:12.610, Speaker B: So a lot of people can request in token amounts, but if you want to pay out ETH, for example, it'd be hard to. A lot of people prefer to be denominated in some fiat. So you can say, want to be paid 1000 USD of some token. I guess the only token we have here is ygg. So you can say, I want to be paid 1000 USD instead of just 1000 or whatever that is converted to the actual token amount. And then we obviously provide some form of metadata here to kind of give some context to each transaction. So you can say that this is a contributor compensation for engineering part time.
00:16:12.610 - 00:16:16.360, Speaker B: You can have a project here.
00:16:18.970 - 00:16:43.100, Speaker A: Yeah, reminds me, a lot of expensify or gusto, if anyone's ever used those. The idea here is the same. You create a request to get paid. I love the fact too that you can request it in like a fiat amount versus the token, because if the markets get bloody, you might request it in a fiat amount.
00:16:43.710 - 00:17:18.310, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. This is kind of one of our flows that we've noticed that dows find very useful. It's just this ability to kind of share this link and have anyone submit a payment request. And then as you can see, once you submit that, you'll see this on your request page. And you can also just kind of create your own request here. The idea of this is like you can collect all these requests from anyone you really want to pay. And then once you collect these requests, you can have your admin, whoever that may be for the DAO, go through and be able to approve or just reject these requests.
00:17:18.310 - 00:17:23.862, Speaker B: So that's just for Alex.
00:17:23.926 - 00:17:47.380, Speaker A: For those that would submit a payment request, then do you expect that they'll have access to this then? Or is there like a portal or like a contact form to submit that? I recognize what you just walked us through, just thinking about is this something that would be available then to anyone who normally gets paid?
00:17:47.910 - 00:17:55.902, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So this is kind of like a public link that is tailored to your dow. And once you share this link, anyone with.
00:17:56.056 - 00:17:56.998, Speaker A: There we go.
00:17:57.164 - 00:17:57.974, Speaker B: Cool.
00:17:58.172 - 00:18:18.998, Speaker A: There we go. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Okay, good. That's all familiar. Awesome. What about I see the recurring payments? Would that be actually, don't let me stop you from. Is there anything else there under request we should cover? Because I realize that's kind of like expenses or like one off types of jobs that you do in a dow.
00:18:19.094 - 00:18:38.980, Speaker B: Yeah, we've seen this used for bounties, for expenses, for contract work. But yeah, I'll go through the rest really quickly. It's pretty basic. You would accept a request if you think it's good, and from here you can actually bulk pay them so you'll be able to. If I just quickly, I guess, submit another one.
00:18:41.030 - 00:18:59.558, Speaker A: But this is the first time I've seen all this. Hopefully if anyone's ever watched anything on my YouTube channel here, it's not like set up to be a charade of bullshit. I really have not seen any of this live. This is so cool to see it all coming together finally.
00:18:59.724 - 00:19:05.354, Speaker B: Yeah. Funny enough, I think the last time we presented the product to you might have been a figma welcome. That looks very.
00:19:05.472 - 00:19:13.866, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. And it wasn't that long ago either. No, it's wild. It's so cool, man. Yeah, I'm just excited for you guys.
00:19:14.048 - 00:19:52.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing we've noticed that a lot of people paying multiple requests through Gnosis is something that we were asked a lot for. So being able to know payments to multiple wallets, for multiple currencies, for multiple amounts, all in one transaction. So if I click this, it'll basically create a transaction on gnosis that pays Alex this much and pays Jason this much. As you can see, we kind of calculated how much 1000 USD of YG was here. And this will kind of execute that payment automatically. Well, sorry, no, not automatically. It'll execute that payment on Gnosis and then you have to sign and go through Gnosis's execution to be able to actually execute that transaction.
00:19:54.030 - 00:20:13.950, Speaker A: Really cool. Once you hit that confirm and create, then you would follow up on that. Basically by doing that, we don't have to do it here, but that would open up a window to gnosis safe.
00:20:14.310 - 00:20:47.610, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I can probably just create it. Actually. I think this safe is already cluttered with test transactions. So you would sign this as a multi sig. And then once you've created that, I can visit my history here and you can see these two transactions, sorry, payments that I just created a transaction for. And you can go and sign on Nosis and you'll be able to see all the transactions that we have in queue for a safe here, which will be a lot of transactions.
00:20:48.030 - 00:20:54.586, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah. Oh no, sorry. Alex, what were you saying?
00:20:54.768 - 00:21:03.214, Speaker B: Sorry, I just want to add that eventually we're actually going to incorporate our own signing page. So right now you have to go to gnosis to sign. But a lot of customers have told us.
00:21:03.412 - 00:21:45.440, Speaker A: That's cool. That's what, that's what I was like. Could you take that workflow and put it within the DAP? If anyone hasn't used gnosisafe, just all you need to know is normally when we refer to a multi sig in dows, there's multiple signers, which means if we were going to pay Alex 1000 USDC, before that can be sent, you have to get, let's say three of five signers to approve. And then once that happens, someone can execute the transaction. So this is what normally happens behind the scenes in a real dow. If it's truly decentralized and controlled by a token, this is how it's supposed to.
00:21:47.410 - 00:22:21.260, Speaker B: Lot of, I think, basically the de facto standard for any dow because it allows to kind of spread the trust among multiple people for the DAO's funds instead of having one being control of. So I guess a lot of customers have told us this UI signing page is a bit confusing. So we're building our own, actually. So you'll be able to kind of see all the data here. But this is basically our trim transaction that was created. We're making a call to the notesafe multi send contract, which will kind of execute all the payments that we've shown here.
00:22:21.950 - 00:22:55.090, Speaker A: Wow. I know the gnosis safe guys are probably super excited for that too. It's such an important tool at this point. I've been kind of surprised less have built with gnosis safe or kind of built their own UI around that. But Alex, anything else here to point out on the request side? Like we created a request, we submitted it to gnosisafe, we would then execute it and then it would what? Show up here I guess. Where does it show up after you execute?
00:22:55.430 - 00:23:19.610, Speaker B: Yeah, after you execute. It shows up on history here. So you can see all the transactions that you've made in the past and you can kind of view details on it. And eventually what we really want to do is kind of provide analytics and financial analysis on your transactions so you can actually see how did the Dow spend its money last month, what was some of the costs that had and how can be analyzed.
00:23:20.290 - 00:23:56.680, Speaker A: That's really cool. That's exciting because then you could start to look in real time and hopefully this would all be then public for anyone to be able to say, hey, the Dow has spent x amount on operating expenses over the past month. That's really cool. One last thing there I think we hadn't covered is recurring payments. Does that refer to someone who would be on a salary or let's pretend you get paid every two weeks or twice a month?
00:23:57.530 - 00:24:43.282, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So that's kind of the most popular use case that we've seen for the current payments is dows who have kind of salary contributors who are kind of being paid a fixed sum every month or every two weeks. And this is a very similar flow as before. I'll just run through it quickly because you kind of see this UI before. But let's say I get paid 1000, say once a month, I want to execute it on the last day of the month, for example. So here I can just say, let's say I started on January 1 and it is a contributor compensation full time and let's do engineering. So once I actually create this request, you can kind of see the payments that we generated.
00:24:43.282 - 00:25:10.800, Speaker B: So there's going to be one payment that's going to be generated on January 31, February 20, eigth, March 31, et cetera. And every month basically you can go ahead and pay your contributors. So right now these recurrent payments don't execute automatically. So an operator will have to come back and actually execute these every month or whenever they do their payroll. But we are looking into obviously making it automatic. So that should be coming soon as well.
00:25:11.250 - 00:25:58.000, Speaker A: This is cool. So right now if you think about everything as a payment request, you're creating a payment request that just regenerates so you don't have to keep track of who's being paid during what times of the month. Yeah, this is also cool because I want to say, is it called superfluid? That is like a protocol for recurring payments and you can do all sorts of really cool stuff. And so as those protocols develop, that will benefit Utopia. Utopia will benefit it. I think there's lots of synergy there to play off of anything else here, Alex, that we should walk through. I think we've just about covered it all.
00:25:58.770 - 00:26:34.700, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, I think those are the two key things. I think maybe one other small feature is just being able to add multiple people to kind of manage your account. So here, not only can the multisig holders be able to access this dashboard, but you can add someone else, you can add someone who's not a multisig to be able to kind of access this dashboard and be able to create requests, create recurring payments, edit that stuff. So this allows Dow operators that may not necessarily be multi sig owner be able to kind of still do operations work here.
00:26:35.790 - 00:27:16.280, Speaker A: So with this tool, is there any sort of traditional customer support? Normally if someone said I sent a payment to the wrong address, we all know by now, okay, that's on me. No one can save me from making a mistake on chain. But, yeah, I guess. Is there anything to point out here that you guys, as the utopia team can assist with or basically if someone starts using this, if they had trouble, like something was buggy, what sorts of stuff do you guys have access to that they should contact support about?
00:27:17.050 - 00:27:48.546, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I think what we really pride ourselves in is having a very good customer service, I think so having all the customers that use our product right now have a very white glove approach. We're constantly messaging them, they have a direct line. Anything goes wrong, they can message us and we'll reply within minutes, if not a few hours. And we really want to help every dow kind of solve their problem. That's kind of why we exist. We really want to help them scale and be able to manage thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of people as easily as it is managing ten or five.
00:27:48.546 - 00:28:19.420, Speaker B: So, yeah, we're really kind of dedicated to that. And we have this basically contact support, intercom integration here where if you message us, we actually have these rolling cycles where everyone on our team is going to be. There's always going to be someone active in the most of the day. So you'll be able to text here and then we'll automatically be able to help you. So, yeah, we really pride ourselves in the wipe glove approach, being able to work closely with our customers as well as figure out what else that we can help them with.
00:28:21.150 - 00:29:15.378, Speaker A: Okay, so given you guys just launched this today, now the floodgates are open. So anybody can go to, let me put the link up here. Anybody can then go to utopialabs.com, connect their wallet, and they can get started themselves. A few of the other dows that have already gotten started, and I'm checking a tweet from you guys. There was FWB, yield, guild, badger, Dow alluvium, fingerprints, Dow tracer, Dow pleaserdao, and Sharkdao. Is there any reason at this point for anyone else to be getting in touch with the team? I don't know if there's any sort of custom integrations or if you guys are just looking in general for specific partners and feedback, or should folks just get started on their own and plug in using their wallet with adapt?
00:29:15.574 - 00:29:39.614, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think most customers can just plug in and start using it. I think that'd be most convenient for them. But as I mentioned earlier, we really love having a white glove approach with our customers. So we love when customers reach out because we really want to. Obviously, like this product is nowhere. Our goal is really to help Dow scale, and I think our product right now is nowhere near making that easier, as easy as it should be.
00:29:39.614 - 00:30:12.378, Speaker B: So we love talking to customers. We love understanding what other problem we can solve for them. So we have a lot of ideas in the pipeline that have resulted directly from customer interaction and them just quickly telling us, I spend 10 hours every week on this is so frustrating. Please just automate this or please have some way. So if they want to reach out, we're more than happy to kind of create some direct line of communication with everyone on the team and be able to support them and hear them out. So, yeah, definitely reach out is kind of the conclusion there.
00:30:12.564 - 00:30:29.800, Speaker A: Alex, is there any other features that you expect to be released soon? I guess. Question is, is there any additional products to what we're doing with payroll and expense management that we should look forward to?
00:30:30.330 - 00:31:29.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing that we've noticed is a lot of dows, once they reach a certain capacity and size, they do tend to incorporate or have some kind of regulatory compliance and tax compliance. And I think obviously we can't really do payroll without considering that. So we are building out a tax compliant feature, a legal compliance feature where yeah. So if you are incorporated and you're paying people as employees, we'll be able to generate the proper forms for you as well as do proper tax withholding and proper tax filings in your state, your local and federal levels. Currently, we're going to ship this very soon, actually, and we're currently only going to support US based corporations and US employees. But obviously, if this is super useful and because DaO is so global, we're definitely having plans to expand this to any organization. So that's one thing that I think is a pretty big pain point that I've seen dows face.
00:31:29.334 - 00:32:02.578, Speaker B: And I think that we'll be able to solve that pretty effectively. And the last one is kind of more on the financial area for a dow. I think that's been something that a lot of dows also have trouble with in terms of budgeting, in terms of making financial analysis, in terms of accounting. And we are really focused on that as well. Working with a lot of our customers, talking to them, iterating on ideas with them, and making something that they really find valuable to use. And that'll be also shipped very soon too. I think those two things I'm very excited for.
00:32:02.744 - 00:32:46.980, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really cool. I remember not too long ago as I was trying to explain to friends and colleagues, actually at fourth Revolution capital, trying to explain to the team, I'm like, oh yeah, utopia. It's like gusto, but for dows. Or it's like expensify but for like you're sort of rolling up some really, again, familiar needs in terms of running an organization, whether it's a business or in this case a dow, and being able to track that all on chain. So dude, it's awesome. I'm so excited. It's just so cool to finally see the product go live.
00:32:46.980 - 00:33:13.740, Speaker A: I knew you guys would do it, but it feels so good to see it live. And reminder anyone, Utopia does not have a token. So just, if you see anything about a token right now, that's probably scammers in your discord. So please avoid those. But yeah, you can use utopia right now. It's free to use. All you got to do is go to utopialabs.com.
00:33:13.740 - 00:33:31.214, Speaker A: Alex, anything else that people should know about if they want to get involved with Utopia labs or the community? I know you guys are hiring any job roles you can share that you're hiring for?
00:33:31.412 - 00:33:45.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us we're really looking for good engineers. So that's been our main focus. So yeah, if you're an engineer, and you'd like to join us on our mission. We'd love to talk to you and see if there's a good fit.
00:33:47.030 - 00:33:53.480, Speaker A: Any specific type of engineer though, you guys are hiring for like full stack or front end or back end?
00:33:53.850 - 00:34:17.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us we're focusing on full stack as of now. But yeah, if you have experience working with web apps and soon enough we're going to probably dabble more into smart contracts and more into that kind of stuff. So we might be hiring even for more skills. But I think as of now, it's just kind of, if you're a web developer, we'd love to see if you can get involved.
00:34:18.370 - 00:34:48.438, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Let's see here. So then everyone can follow Utopia labs. For updates on the product, you can follow Alex here on Twitter as, yeah, just go to utopialabs.com. I mean, it's very straightforward to get started. Also too, if anyone has questions, you can reach out to the team, but I would love to hear from some of the dows. I definitely count myself in way too many dows right now.
00:34:48.438 - 00:35:03.200, Speaker A: I'm hoping some of those will adopt this because I think it's just a more organized way to ensure that contributors get paid for their time or in some cases for expenses. So yeah. Alex, anything else you want to share before we go?
00:35:04.290 - 00:35:39.286, Speaker B: No, I think we've touched on a lot. I just want to share the link here for our careers page. Just simple careers utopilabs.com. But yeah, we're super looking forward to just helping these new form of organizations find their footing and really kind of expand to a level that we haven't really previously seen before. Everyone on the team is super excited to help kind of lead this change and we'd love for more people to join us in being a customer or just helping us join the team as well.
00:35:39.468 - 00:35:44.170, Speaker A: Alex, will you or anyone from the team be at Eiffe, Denver in February?
00:35:45.470 - 00:35:57.310, Speaker B: Yeah, we were thinking about it. I think it's still a bit up in the air right now, but myself and Josiah might be going unconfirmed right now. But I put it at like, yeah, 70%.
00:35:57.380 - 00:36:30.914, Speaker A: No, I know everybody wants to go. I myself haven't decided whether I can go yet, but I'm pretty confident someone from our team will be there. Well, hey everyone, thanks for tuning in. Hopefully you learned something about this. And again, if you work in a Dow or you're a part of a Dow, please share with the core team utopialabs.com.
