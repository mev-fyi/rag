00:00:00.280 - 00:00:59.985, Speaker A: In V1 somebody could avoid redemptions by hiring the loan to value because if somebody came and wanted to redeem, the positions were sorted based on the loan to value ratio and you started from the bottom. In V2 that changes and I think that's a fascinating mechanics. If a redemption comes in troves, our troves or loan positions are sorted by interest rate and the one that pays the least will get redeemed first. So the one that had kind of the not the free launch but the kind of the best launch also gets punished first. So you as a user how do you set the rate? We expect that we'll have a market rate in average, so if you want to be on the safe side, you put a higher rate because then you redeem later. If you are maybe a big market maker and you want to be really aggressive and take out the cheap loan, you you lower your rate.

00:04:41.591 - 00:04:45.131, Speaker B: Michael and Max, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:45.303 - 00:04:49.547, Speaker A: Great and thanks for having us again. Really a pleasure and looking forward to it.
00:04:49.611 - 00:05:49.477, Speaker B: Today we're going to Talk all about Liquidy V2. Nomadic and I are power users, I guess of Liquidy V1 and we've gotten to enjoy all of the benefits of that as a Call it a CDP protocol. For those of us in DeFi. Over the last few years we've seen shortcomings, I guess, in the design of certain protocols and when it comes to the lending and borrowing space, we're just really excited for how Liquidy V2 is looking to fill in the gaps or make improvements upon the legacy design of V1 and other lending and borrowing protocols. So we're going to talk about user set rates today. We're going to talk about the bootstrapping of this liquidy V2 and how the protocol is going to incentivize liquidity coming into to liquidy. So that said, why don't we kick off with Just more about the design behind Liquidy V2.
00:05:49.477 - 00:06:02.341, Speaker B: Maybe a little bit of background on Liquidy V1 for folks that aren't as familiar. There's clearly a lot that's gone into this new design. So yeah Michael, maybe you can kick us off with that.
00:06:02.493 - 00:06:45.415, Speaker A: Sure. Happy to dive into liquid DV2 and I think our goal here is really to set the gold standard for CDP and stablecoin solutions and we'll dive into why we think the innovations really can make that happen. And as you said, Liquid TV2 is also a CDP stablecoin system like Liquid DV1. And just quickly to touch on Liquid DV1 has been running for three years, has issued more than 4.6 billion in loans. One of the most forked protocols out there, defi protocols. And since the last three years it has been running flawlessly I would say.
00:06:45.415 - 00:07:59.973, Speaker A: So V2 builds on top of V1 kind of and inherits a lot of the good stuff and design choices and the things that changed one is was a big user need that we are addressing that people said can we have Also other collaterals LSTs which are yield bearing. So V2 is multi collateral and the other thing which we touched on where we won didn't perform that well was in high interest rate environment that had different reasons but especially because then people were selling the stablecoin to get more yield with another stablecoin that triggered redemptions and people couldn't get the capital efficiency they wanted. So we too addresses that with user set rates. And of the great innovation that ensures that V2 is working under all market conditions. And maybe the third I think important innovation is then that the stablecoin which is called Bold should have similar properties like LUSD being unstoppable. One of the most decentralized stablecoin out there. And the big difference to v1 is in v2 it gets real yield.
00:07:59.973 - 00:08:17.549, Speaker A: It gets the most of the interest that borrowers pay go to the stablecoin which I think is also a very interesting property. I think that's in short I would say to give users that know we want a bit a heads up. I don't know Max, do you have anything to add?
00:08:17.637 - 00:08:58.991, Speaker C: I would just add that we've also revisited the redemption mechanism I don't know for BOLD versus lusd. So long story short, both are leverage machines, right? You go there to borrow. But the V1 had redemptions processed against positions based on their loan to value. So Liquid EV1 offered some of the highest loan to value ratios in defi for eth but you probably would get redeemed against if you tried to get that close. And so with the V2 we now do it on a different parameter, user interest rates. And so we're excited to see, you know, how Bold can act as a better leverage machine as a result.
00:08:59.103 - 00:09:26.465, Speaker D: Guys, we'll get into kind of each layer of all this a little bit later on, but I want to call out. We did a podcast on Liquidy V2 almost a year ago and then I believe part of that plan was scrapped. Looks like you went back to the drawing board. I'm just curious what you saw in the market or what made you kind of say, hey, no, we need to kind of reiterate this thing. It's not ready, it's not fully cooked. Like, what was the thinking behind that?
00:09:26.585 - 00:09:31.329, Speaker A: Yeah, the last time we spoke we were looking into a reserve backed design.
00:09:31.497 - 00:09:32.205, Speaker C: And.
00:09:34.065 - 00:10:24.545, Speaker A: That can have some limitations on certain market conditions and it's a more complex product. And at that time we had these higher interest rates and we one started to suffer because of that. So that was a main trigger that we said, how can we address that? And also just kind of being eager. Nobody really innovated on the V1 model. And so we were in a retreat going through the reserve back design and then we started just brainstorming how could we make that better? What's the core problem here? And then we came up with the user set rates, which we thought, hey, that's really interesting because in V1 it's a one off fee, you don't have an interest rate. But this causes problems. And we really thought that aligns very much with kind of the values and that would make the protocol one of the most market driven solutions.
00:10:24.545 - 00:11:06.743, Speaker A: And nobody touched on it. So these two things, seeing kind of we weren't suffering and saying what would we innovate if we touched or forked ourselves. And that started the design process in November23. So I'm really glad to see all the progress we made. So kind of V2 is coded, it's right now in audit and we plan that in Q4, probably November, we want to launch it. And I think that was just a pleasure to work with that team that has so much experience to be able to from the first idea until delivery within 12 months. I think if we achieve that, that would be a great achievement.
00:11:06.839 - 00:11:44.147, Speaker B: Guys, in terms of Liquidy v1, one of the benefits that, you know, we were always excited to spotlight, you know, to tell other, other users and friends about, is the fact that it was uncensorable so can you just remind us like before we move on and talk more about like Liquidy V2. I mean V1 will continue to be operational, right? Like it just, it lives on. And my assumption is that at some point we'll see all folks migrating over to a V2. But anyways, how does that play out in your mind? Like am I framing that up correctly?
00:11:44.251 - 00:12:19.157, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I mean As I said, V1 is battle tested, it's here to stay. Especially for people that love this battle tested, this only want EVE as a collateral kind of this die hard solution. And especially if rates are going down, down again. You know, liquid TV1 is still very good solution again. So I think we will see both in parallel V2 performing better in all markets condition, maybe addressing a broader audience. But yes, as you said, V1 is here to stay.
00:12:19.301 - 00:12:55.285, Speaker D: Guys, maybe let's talk a bit about Bold. So anybody coming to the table and like kind of looking at V2 will notice you're introducing a new stablecoin called Bold in addition to V1's LUSD. Maybe just give us the high level touch points on it, like how will users acquire it? And then max, maybe you can take the second part of this question I know we were talking about in Telegram. There's kind of like a different risk premium sort of like versus I think you said monetary premium balance. You're trying to play out with this. Yeah. Maybe just kind of give us the TLDR on bold.
00:12:55.445 - 00:13:29.989, Speaker A: Yeah. So how is BOLD created? I mean how does the system work in principle is that users want to take out the loan, bring in their collateral. In v1 it was only eth. In v2 there we will accept LIDO and Rocket Pool. We wanted to go just with the two most battle tested LSTs out there because V1 where V2 will also be immutable. So you deposit your collateral and then you mint your loan in Bold. As a stablecoin it will have very similar properties like LUSD just backed with two more collaterals.
00:13:29.989 - 00:14:07.887, Speaker A: That adds a little bit of risk. Otherwise you still have the great properties of LUSDs. Because what a lot of people do or miss a bit is LUSD and BOLD will be one of the very few stable coins or Bold in explicit that give real yield and is directly redeemable. So where users have a direct claim to the underlying collateral and that's one point why I set the gold standard. That's one part of the gold standard. Our fiat currency were on a gold standard. You always had the claim to the underlying Collateral.
00:14:07.887 - 00:14:30.997, Speaker A: So I think that's the gold standard for a stablecoin being able to have this direct claim to what you believe in as a crypto user, to the underlying very liquid collateral. So you always have the exit round in the most liquid collateral out there, ether and the other two are also very liquid. So I think that's a big differentiator for the stablecoin and why it's interesting to hold.
00:14:31.101 - 00:15:03.095, Speaker C: Yeah. And to Michael's point, right, A lot of DeFi native stablecoins that are coming to the market today really focus on the yields you can earn through them, whether the highness or the volume of those yields or where those yields come from. And that's appetizing. It's attractive to users. But the reality is, you know, if you're paying out a lot for a stable coin, it's because the market demands that, right. That it's. There's a perceived risk somewhere, somehow.
00:15:03.095 - 00:15:39.067, Speaker C: And where I think the BOLD model will really shine is that with the slight adjustments we've made to, you know, what LUSD brought to the market, we think we have an asset here that is going to be like a premier savings and earning vehicle within Defi, because it has a native rate that can be earned. LUSD didn't have that, but it also still retains the redeemability. Right. Which is something not a lot of projects can claim to have. And it does impact, you know, the market's kind of risk appetite for a given CDP stablecoin, if that's the case.
00:15:39.211 - 00:16:42.879, Speaker A: And just to add one more thing, you know, so how you could think about it maybe even less as a stable coin, but I think what we aim to introduce here is like defi Treasuries with bold. Because why do people like Treasuries? Because there is not much counterparty risk and because you get a decent yield. So with Bold, if you put in a stability pool, you don't have this counterparty, you have still the direct redeemability and you get this native defi yield which isn't tied to any centralized player or wa. So you have kind of this base asset and product that gives you kind of the same profile you have with Treasuries in the CEFI world. And that's interesting first of all for users, because I think there are many products that have these properties. And the other thing is then the interesting part, what can be built on something like that, because I think that's a bit the missing piece right now. And that's also the market or kind of the niche we target Guys, in.
00:16:42.927 - 00:17:18.099, Speaker D: Going over the white paper, this new white paper, before this conversation, there's a lot of, I think, novel and new things that you're bringing to the table that are worth calling out and going through in a bit more detail. But I want to kind of walk through it more as like a user would, if that makes sense. So maybe we can just start at the top. Like the first thing a user might be thinking when they're coming to Liquid EV2 is like, okay, what collateral can I bring to the protocol? So I know you've introduced new collateral types. Where does this user start with collateral? What can they use?
00:17:18.227 - 00:17:37.429, Speaker A: They can use like NV1 ETH. And we added two LSDs from LIDO, so wrapped state ETH and rocket pull ethical. So it's really focused on ETH believers. Kind of an ETH centric product. There aren't any other collaterals.
00:17:37.557 - 00:18:00.213, Speaker B: Guys, any thoughts on when LRTS would be battle tested enough? I can understand the decision here to like move forward with just those LSTs first, but yeah, what, what else do you think needs to needs to be seen in the market before we can add LRTS as collateral.
00:18:00.309 - 00:18:30.155, Speaker A: I can maybe touch on why we didn't add it. I think liquidity, because it's immutable and you get this predictability of the protocol. We are very cautious and we only take in what's really battle tested because you can't change it. So liquite is always like a step behind. Of course a lot of people ask us for LRTS and other stuff, but I think we need to be cautious there on timing. I don't know, Max, you have a take on that when you're thinking LRTS already.
00:18:30.535 - 00:18:50.159, Speaker C: I mean, my personal view is that the slashing risk associated with LRTS is obviously very, very different than the one with LSTs. And for deploying something that's immutable, I don't think LRTS would ever make sense in the context of how liquidy core deploys this type of protocol.
00:18:50.287 - 00:19:04.191, Speaker D: So another, another new thing that I've seen here is this idea of user set rates. It appears that a user can come and set their own interest rates. Can. Can one of you maybe walk us through the how and the why of that?
00:19:04.303 - 00:19:37.955, Speaker A: Sure. So. So that's a major difference. You know, in V1 you had the one off fee and now in V2 if you go then to the front end, you choose your collateral, you say how much you depend, what to deposit, you take out the loan, and there is a new parameter you can set your rate so from 0.5% to 1000% and you can adjust it anytime. That's important. So for the first time you as a user you become a rate maker instead of a rate taker.
00:19:37.955 - 00:20:13.117, Speaker A: And of course there's a caveat, it sounds too good to be true because everybody would set it to 0.5% and max already hinted to it. Why did we introduce that? With the interest rate you not only control the cost of the loan, which is nice by the way in defi, that makes it predictable. You just know what you're going to pay unless you changed it. So it's not some governance in the background that is changing it overnight or within 48 hours. It's not a very volatile rate based on utilization, which we have seen. It's really new mechanic.
00:20:13.117 - 00:21:03.335, Speaker A: So but going back, what does the interest rate also controls? And Max already said it in V1 you, you had the thing called redemptions and we already said that's a nice feature of the stablecoin because a redemption allows every user, not only the borrower to go to the protocol and say I have one bold, give me one bold worth of eth. And users usually do that if the stablecoin is below peg. So this gives also a strong backpack guarantee to the ball. So if the stablecoin is 99 cents, somebody could come and say I want $1 of Eve. That's redemption and that gives the nice property. But this also means for the borrower that usually they don't want to get redeemed. They don't have a loss, but they lose.
00:21:03.335 - 00:21:47.161, Speaker A: What happens on their side is they lose the exposure or some of the collateral. Somebody pays back their loan and gets the collateral, they're net neutral, but they lose the exposure. In V1 somebody could avoid redemptions by hiring the loan to value because if somebody came and wanted to redeem, their positions were sorted based on the loan to value ratio and you started from the bottom. In V2 that changes. And I think that's a fascinating mechanics. If a redemption comes in, our troves or loan positions are sorted by interest rate and the one that pays the least will get redeemed first. So the one that had kind of the.
00:21:47.161 - 00:22:33.125, Speaker A: Not the free launch, but the kind of the best launch also gets punished first. So you as a user, how do you set the rate? We expect that we'll have a market rate in average. So if you want to be on the safe side, you put a higher rate because then you're redeemed later. If you are Maybe a big market maker and you want to be really aggressive and take out the cheap loan, you lower your rate and then of course you need to. What will happen is if the stablecoin is above peg, so this ties into the pack mechanics. If it's above pack, then nobody will be redeemed. So users will lower their rates.
00:22:33.125 - 00:23:08.811, Speaker A: And if they lower the rates, less people will hold the stablecoin so less demand. Then the peg is falling. If it's kind of below a dollar, then users are afraid of getting redeemed and they increase the rate. And now you have more yield on the stablecoin, so more people hold it. So this is the new dynamic which is very market driven. You know that that's the market driven point. It's just by people setting the rate on the borrowing side and people on the holding side holding the stablecoin and it's like a carrot and stick.
00:23:08.811 - 00:23:47.447, Speaker A: Borrowers can give some yield and that's nice. People hold the stablecoin because it's nice yields, but if it's that there is too little yield, then stablecoin holders will say, hey, we don't like a stable coin, we dump it and we're going to redeem you. So kind of these two forces in a very direct way work together. And this brings everything back kind of to the important role which user set rates have. It's really to bring borrowers and holders of the stablecoin. It's like a borrowing lending market in essence, in an equilibrium. That's what we introduced and that's what users can manage and then also steer themselves.
00:23:47.447 - 00:23:53.399, Speaker A: So that's the big difference. And on the ui you set it at the beginning and you can adjust it at any time.
00:23:53.487 - 00:25:03.095, Speaker B: Boy, that finally got through for me. That was a really well said, articulate way of framing it up. So V1, we all enjoyed the same low interest rate or no interest rate, I guess technically. And the problem that we ran into with V1 over the past year, and correct me if I'm, if I'm like misframing this, but it, it seems that, you know, LUSD had fallen below peg. So we were in redemptions. And as you mentioned, you're ranking those loans by LTV or loan to value ratio. And so at the end of the day, of course that can be, you know, a really terrible user experience to like, you know, to be at risk of being redeemed because this protocol has always appealed to folks that want to be long ETH or are using it for leverage with eth and obviously too when you're living through like a downtrend or like a bear market, things can really start to get ugly.
00:25:03.095 - 00:26:07.495, Speaker B: Fast forward to V2 now. Instead of being worried about being redeemed because LUSD is below peg and your LTV is really high, you actually can pay to be prioritized and not be in redeeming and then you can have ultimately a higher interest rate, which makes a lot of sense. It also calls into effect the idea that I would imagine that liquidity could really turn into a revenue machine. It just sounds like a great opportunity to allow users to get what they want, which is leverage even at like a high ltv. Risking a lot but being able to avoid that redemption if l. If Bold were to go below peg anyways, am I getting all of that? Actually I guess. Wait, there's one more follow up here is if I'm in V2 borrowing and I've got a.
00:26:07.495 - 00:26:37.817, Speaker B: An interest rate that's been set lower and let's say that the system is looking like it might go into redemptions or just the fact that like Bold has been like waffling below peg and I'm, I'm worried about getting ahead of that. I don't. I had a lower interest rate. Can I adjust that interest rate to pay higher in advance to, you know, basically ensure that I won't be redeemed if you know, we start to go through redemptions?
00:26:37.961 - 00:27:05.841, Speaker A: Yes, you can adjust it at any time so you can set it higher. The only thing, every time you adjust it, you pay a seven day worth of interest. That's just kind of to prevent some attacks. So every time you do that, you shouldn't do that hourly. But other than that, I think seven days is a good frame. You can adjust it. And to make that even easier because now you need to manage the rate, we have a feature called delegation.
00:27:05.841 - 00:27:53.795, Speaker A: So a user can delegate the rate setting. First you can delegate it to your hot wallet. If you don't want to take your cold wallet setup and just manage it much more easily, you can delegate it to a third party that is doing that in a better way or even kind of. We call it batch delegation to really a service provider or an entity that manages that for you also takes a fee and then is able to batch update all the interest rate based on a custom strategy together, which makes it also cheaper to adjust that. So we hope that we there see some providers coming up and helping people to automate that process.
00:27:56.375 - 00:28:59.349, Speaker B: Hey everyone. Before we get back to the show, excited to tell you about a new OmniChain Bitcoin solution called FBTC, which has already surpassed $125 million in TVL and become the fastest growing BTC FI asset this summer. The FBTC Points campaign Sparkle offers sustainable yields plus points and token airdrops from strategic partners such as Babylon, Mantle's new token cook and more. To learn more, visit fbtc.com ongoing campaign and special thanks to FBTC for sponsoring us at the Edge podcast. Do you foresee any strategies for folks that are using the system? Like before we talk about the real yield that's being generated. So that this is, this is really important that we cover, you know, how folks are going to be generating yield because I think this is a big part of what will attract, you know, liquidity and ultimately yield to V2.
00:28:59.349 - 00:29:51.829, Speaker B: But yeah, for folks that are using V2, like I'll call out like if I was thinking like short term I might be looking to set my user interest rate really low because I'm going to be executing some like strategy to earn yield elsewhere. So I'm borrowing on V2 for a really low rate and then I'm earning something substantially higher than the borrowing interest I'm paying on V2. However, then there's folks like who maybe are just getting into like a long term position that you know, this could be a year or longer and they're wanting to set a rate that is safer, that's going to keep them from getting redeemed. So anyways, any other strategies you and the team have thought through or you want to call out for users that will want to get started with V2 once it's live?
00:29:51.997 - 00:30:44.213, Speaker A: I think how you can think about it, what we expect or what we think could happen is that in V2 you get the market rate. No, because it's set by the market and set by the user. So maybe at the beginning it's at the DSR rate. So what you will expect is just kind of what do I need to pay in defi, like the market rate? Will it rather go up? Will it go down? You could think of the maker rate that is set by governance and spiky kind of like smoothed out so it should reflect that. So I think that's how you should think about it. V2 just enables kind of these two sides to negotiate the fair price of borrowing and then holding the stablecoin which is in a sense lending. So I think that's how you can think about it, that with V2 you get a more predictable forward looking rate.
00:30:44.213 - 00:31:09.355, Speaker A: So I think it Makes sense to think about what do I need to pay now? And this is rather going up and down and then monitor the market and then adjust it accordingly. And you can then also look at how much debt is in front of you. So how secure do you want to be? How much extra yield are you going to pay? I think these are all considerations that then come into play.
00:31:09.475 - 00:32:01.447, Speaker B: Really interesting. I am very excited for some of the automation that I imagine will be built with this. You're willing to again go in at let's say a lower interest rate, but you need that automatically adjusted. Being able to do that and pay someone a fee to do it, like it just makes a lot of sense. It's crazy how I have to say, V2 looked so complicated to me at first glance. But like once you framed it up as it's ranking, it's, it's ranking these loans based on the interest rate and hence we are rewarding or prioritizing those who are willing to pay a higher rate to open up a loan. I mean it just makes so much more sense.
00:32:01.447 - 00:32:41.843, Speaker B: You know, you took a variable that was essentially fixed, that was constant for all users in v1 and now that's ultimately going to generate revenue for the protocol. So actually that leads us into like real yield. One thing I was, I was trying to understand, like just reading through like your docs is so v2 introduces a sustainable yield mechanism, I guess. Like what can you tell us about that? Like how does the protocol generate and distribute value to those that participate in it? Or you know, let's talk about liquidy holders themselves.
00:32:42.019 - 00:33:28.453, Speaker A: Yes. So where does the revenue come from? From the borrowers that are now paying an interest. So, so that's the revenue source and what does the protocol do with the revenue source? And I think that's the second part of the gold standard because nobody else is doing that. And actually the protocol does a very natural thing. It takes the borrow revenues and gives it to the holder and it will be a split. So 75% will go to the stability pool, depositors which hold bold and put it there to ensure liquidations. And 25% have a more flexible mechanism which we built so it can flow to LP pools, to liquidity, where also people hold pool.
00:33:28.453 - 00:34:14.174, Speaker A: So I think again that's why I said it makes it the gold standard. It passes 100% through kind of to the holders on the other side. So you have a very market driven system just connecting people that want a loan and people that can give a loan and they can negotiate the price they want. To do that with the interest rate in between. And I think it blew my mind that nobody has done that before. And maybe I can pull up afterwards a slide. But just if you think about it, what is a CDP system about? Balance of borrow and demand on the one side and then really funneling these revenues through.
00:34:14.174 - 00:34:58.219, Speaker A: And if you look at the existing solutions, you have solutions like Maker which is funneling with the DSR kind of the borrower interest to the other side. But Gold and Curve for example, in the current state, the interest doesn't go to the stablecoin holders directly, it's just kind of indirect. It has to find its way. So that's why you think it's very market driven V2 because it just flows where it should go. And so that's one dimension and the other dimension is how the rate is set. You know, because a CDP system is of how revenue flows and how the rates are set. So revenue flow we see there are direct solutions and indirect and rate setting, there are indirect like governance.
00:34:58.219 - 00:35:41.331, Speaker A: So go and Maker and there are more direct ones, algorithmic like curve and V2 where it's the users. And if you span up this metrics, V2 will be the only one that has direct revenue flows and where rates are directly set and not governed. So that's like a new market, a new niche that we are opening up with this solution and I think that's really exciting and going back. So that's what I said when you think about it. Yeah, that's how a market driven system should work. But interestingly, nobody has explored it in that way. And I think we are really excited to see how this will work.
00:35:41.443 - 00:36:16.907, Speaker B: So earlier I think you alluded to the impact that this market driven rate could have on Defi. Can we just go back to that really quickly, like dumb that down? What are you foreseeing? We're going to have a rate here that is the result of users being able to set their own rates. It really should ultimately lead more folks to the protocol and that's going to have the impacts on utilization of other protocols out there. And anyways, how do you see this playing out?
00:36:16.971 - 00:37:15.013, Speaker A: Yeah, I think why can be interesting because V2 could become this immutable defi building block. Others can build on top of it because it's predictable. Because there you find the rate that people currently need to pay in the market and that's because of this pack dynamics. It adjusts really quickly because it has strong incentives and sticks. So that's one important part why we think you find there the market rate. And as I said, the other part is then like, oh, being able to have this defi treasuries and use that to build new products on top, use it for perps, use it for interest rate swaps or yield product. I think there we see the biggest utility or also growth potential for a V2 that it can be used for that for defi native products that can be built on top of that.
00:37:15.013 - 00:37:28.479, Speaker A: And yeah, that's just a building block that isn't there right now because rates are set with governance or you don't have these defi treasury qualities of yield sources.
00:37:28.607 - 00:38:19.023, Speaker D: Guys, you mentioned Liquidy V2 becoming this building block. I recall, I was just looking at Defi llama the other day for this and I think V1 was forked around 37 times. It's in the top 10 of fork defi protocols of all time. Uh, and it looks like you've addressed how this is going to happen going forward with V2. So maybe just break this down. Your strategy behind forking and ideally like how, like how you retain some value in these events when people say they really like the code and they're just going to use it. And then also I'm also curious, just like what sort of protective licenses do you have in place? Like, okay, how you say like, like how are these things implemented or enforced? That makes sense.
00:38:19.119 - 00:39:06.449, Speaker C: Yeah. So you know, as you mentioned, right, liquid EV1 is one of the top worked protocols of all time. And when we look back at that track record, right. I would say it's quite unclear how that accrued value back to LUSD or helped LUSD expand. And so as we were building out the V2 and coming to the conclusion, like, you know, we think we've built the perfect CDP template, basically it's going to be a lot of demand for this beyond just eth based collateral. And we foresaw an opportunity to leverage that I guess is the simplest way of putting it. And so with all that said, right, with our V2 we've put it behind a business license that goes on for a couple of years before reverting to an open source license.
00:39:06.449 - 00:39:36.953, Speaker C: We're not the first to do this. Most of the big defi projects have done it already. Our view on this is that the source code is available. Right. Any user, whether they're retail or institutional, can look at how this thing works, get that level of clarity and make the decision on whether or not they want to use it. For us, Defi is more of a user based definition. Obviously this space is founded upon open source principles.
00:39:36.953 - 00:40:40.645, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, liquidity is a very relevant factor. When we talk about defi, it's not just the code. And so for us, you know, if we have users who are able to keep custody of all their assets, complete transparency of the system at all times, that's what matters. And so we were comfortable making that call on the VTUBE code base. And over the past few months, we've reached out, I would say, basically to every EVM ecosystem under the sun that could make use of this for their native assets, for their, you know, assets that people want to borrow against and just other, you know, more, more edge cases than just, you know, the native gas token or what have you. And we've had a really great response, whether it's from existing defi builders who want to, you know, take a stab at a stable coin, existing stablecoin teams that are looking at, you know, leveling up their current offering, everyone's been very eager to work with us. And I think that says a lot about liquidy's reputation to begin with.
00:40:40.645 - 00:41:37.495, Speaker C: And so we spent the summer assigning basically letters of intent. Now that the code base is live and being audited, we're now, you know, making those binding license agreements and we're looking forward to coming to market not only with our core deployment, but a whole, you know, wave of forks in the ensuing months thereafter. And yeah, so we'll see if it works. Right? Obviously, most other defi protocols have taken the singular brand and expand approach. For us, we don't really see a future in which this code base, you know, propagates 25 times, is beloved on every single chain, and we don't, you know, benefit from that. I think, you know, winning mind share goes a long way for a stable coin that's meant to be a safe and secure earning vehicle. Right.
00:41:37.495 - 00:41:54.875, Speaker C: It makes people comfortable at all levels across the food chain, so to speak. And that's how we see the strategy panning out in the long term is beneficial to us, even though we're not, you know, the ones deploying on 20 different chains or whatever it may be.
00:41:54.955 - 00:42:16.645, Speaker D: Max, I might have missed this, but maybe you already addressed it. So with this kind of like, it's almost like a white label solution that other people can use, but is bold still the underlying stablecoin, like, will it still be proliferating bold or will people kind of be generating their totally net new stablecoin and just kind of using this protocol design? Does that make sense?
00:42:16.755 - 00:42:33.233, Speaker C: Yeah. So these are all net New. Right. This is our way of expanding the code base without diluting the bold and liquidy core brand. Right. By introducing collateral types our power users may not be comfortable with. Yeah.
00:42:33.233 - 00:43:01.985, Speaker C: So each fork separate, stable, separate governance token and any material differences between deployments. Right. Some teams have a different ethos than us. Right. Some may want to do RWAs, some may want a degree of mutability, all those types of, you know, changes that are possible. We're not, you know, chaperoning or stewarding anyone on this. We'll make sure that they disclose what's different versus ours.
00:43:01.985 - 00:43:06.725, Speaker C: Users can make that decision, but we're all separate entities.
00:43:07.145 - 00:43:29.313, Speaker D: Awesome. And you mentioned governance token there. So a new term that I saw kind of in your white paper, this protocol incentivized liquidity. I've heard of protocol owned liquidity, but maybe break down what is pil and then how does this kind of impact or involve the. The already released liquidy token as well?
00:43:29.409 - 00:44:03.235, Speaker C: Yeah. So in. In the V2, right, as Michael was alluding to, a hundred percent of protocol revenues go back to the ecosystem. Let's call it the lion share. That goes to stability pools. But in our deployment, at least 25% of all protocol revenue will be distributed by LQTY stakers. So the way the UX on this works is you have your lqty, you've staked for a period of time, you have a voting power boost if you can stake longer.
00:44:03.235 - 00:44:09.311, Speaker C: No locking or anything like that. And yeah, every week you have a pool of bold.
00:44:09.423 - 00:44:09.671, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:09.703 - 00:44:39.789, Speaker C: That the protocol generated as revenue and that can be distributed to any target on chain. So liquidity pools for bold lending markets, for bold market makers that you think are doing a good job, you can just send it to their address if you so please. Anything's for a game. It's a very agnostic module. So people who have used Curve in the past, you know, are familiar with like, gauge weighting. Right. It's a similar system here.
00:44:39.789 - 00:45:10.155, Speaker C: It's just in our case, there are no more lqty emissions. It's. It's purely protocol revenue that's being distributed that way. And this is a module that's open to our forks as well. Presumably they'll use it for their governance token emissions in addition to whatever protocol revenue they gift back. But, you know, it's. It's our way of basically ensuring that, you know, at a protocol level, there are no funds piling up anywhere, there's no treasury to go after.
00:45:10.155 - 00:45:43.509, Speaker C: But also that, you know, if you are a bold holder, you can expect There to be, you know, a kind of interplay between the protocol and the secondary liquidity it exists in. Right. Again, like none of this stuff is in a vacuum. And so it's kind of our way of having a system that is market aware without sacrificing immutability or involving our core team efforts as much in provisioning that liquidity.
00:45:43.597 - 00:46:34.791, Speaker A: And just to add on that, I think what's important, that's really just 25% of revenues that Ellicott UI Staker can influence. All the rest, the core protocol, the core parameters, the core functionality is not touched. It's the Same as in V1. And why did we do that? We wanted to keep it immutable, yet adaptable, especially on the liquidity source. And then I think that's also an innovation. Liquidity is a key challenge for every stablecoin. So how do the others solve it somehow in governance somewhere hidden? So we wanted to find a way and to ensure on a protocol level that it's taken care of and people have more confidence that liquidity will be there and that somewhere we have a sustainable source of rewards that can be driven to these sources.
00:46:34.791 - 00:47:09.259, Speaker A: So that's why it's protocol incentivized. It's ongoing incentives that can be funneled through liquidity or other means. The 25% of the interest and it's not protocol owned liquidity. But I think that's also very interesting innovation we haven't seen. So that makes me really excited. All these things we can try out. And I think if we want to build decentralized solutions that are ideally immutable with the core ethos of DeFi, I think these are very interesting steps where we should try new approaches and that's what we will do with E2.
00:47:09.259 - 00:47:12.131, Speaker A: At Moonbeam, we're building a world where.
00:47:12.163 - 00:47:54.075, Speaker B: The wonders of decentralized technology are accessible to everyone.

And our partner ecosystem continues to grow, grow through grants and incentives. Moonbeams is delivering frictionless user and builder experiences to create the future of the Internet on chain. Join us by participating in the Moonrise campaign today.
00:47:55.015 - 00:48:38.875, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think this is kind of taking us in a step where like V2 looks like a much more governance light protocol by design. And I think you, you're Both kind of keying in on some of these things, these points. There's a lot more like, I guess like automation and protocol level actions that are happening rather than maybe, you know, what we've kind of somewhat gotten used to in some senses with this big DAO that's, you know, not really that efficient. So yeah, maybe just kind of speak to that a little bit. One of you. Just this intentional kind of stripped down governance that maybe some people might be a bit unfamiliar with with, with DeFi.
00:48:38.955 - 00:49:33.195, Speaker C: I mean, I would say we're in a unique position, right, with LTI being fully distributed and the core team not having had a doubt all these years. And so I think what we've seen from other stablecoin issuers in the space and other DEFI projects in general is that there is a happy medium somewhere, right. Like there are certain things where a community of a protocol can coordinate over and it's just a matter of finding the line, you know, where does it make sense to have this level of engagement? And I think what's cool about ours, right, is that, you know, we don't have to decide what this looks like. Right. It could very well be the case that the majority of LQTY stakers want BOLD USDC on unis swap and call it a day. Right? No. No need for forum posts, no need for any like horse trading or whatever.
00:49:33.195 - 00:50:14.641, Speaker C: But you know, there can always be the case that there are interested entities that want to provide a lot of liquidity for BOLD and get paid for doing so and maybe they want to put their word out to community and people can decide on whether that makes sense or not in. In their view. So what, we'll see which way this all goes and for every fork it'll look different too, presumably. But what mattered for us is that we still have immutability at the core and that these outcomes were hard coded. We're not deploying this with 10 liquidity pools set and have fun. It's all very agnostic.
00:50:14.833 - 00:50:36.307, Speaker B: Max, before we close out, I'd love to hear your thinking as head of growth on how will Liquidy B2 attract users? Like, there's a lot of competition in DEFI right now. So like, how are you. Yeah. Thinking to attract, you know, borrowers and onboard new users to Liquidy v2.
00:50:36.411 - 00:51:04.301, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean there's a few levels to it. But I think in short, you know, we as liquidy do benefit from quite a good reputation. So we are expecting our power users from V1 and LUSD to give us a shot when we Launch later this quarter ultimately. Right. We are kind of at the mercy of where the market's at in the short run. People will mint bold to go chase yield opportunities elsewhere.
00:51:04.373 - 00:51:04.725, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:04.805 - 00:51:53.305, Speaker C: Carry trades. And so if the market is in the mood for leverage, whether it's for, you know, looped yield exposure or just going for an asset like eth's price performance. Right, like that'll play a role for sure. We're very keen on, you know, collaborating with our forks in the post launch period as well. Most of our license agreements do, you know, revolve around a little bit of collaboration on things like liquidity. So we think that'll be an opportunity for growth, you know, let's say in the medium term as well as those forks roll out and we have our initiatives with them. And then, I mean, lastly, I would say from a long term perspective, it's very much a demand side question.
00:51:53.305 - 00:52:41.059, Speaker C: Right? Like do people feel comfortable holding in bold? Do they think it's, you know, something they don't mind getting dumped on by the people using our system for leverage? Right. And that's how secondary liquidity works for CDPs. I personally think with our redemption mechanism and with the native yield we offer, it won't take a lot to convince people that it's okay and safe to hold. So there's a few moving parts for sure and we're not in control of all of it, but we do think the cream will rise to the top on this and we think also that we have the right kind of both community and alliances forming as well.
00:52:41.147 - 00:53:44.749, Speaker B: Great stuff. And I do want to just call out that, I know, like Having recently reviewed V2 as best I could and then obviously getting this deep dive here. Like, I am so excited for V2, you know, I really did see users get burned by the redemptions by LTV there, you know, during a short time frame. But you know, prior to that I really felt like liquidy v1 had like stood the test of time. And you know, seeing how those redemptions played out, it clearly called for some action. And I think you guys as a team have gone back to the drawing board and figured out a really clever way to build on a lot of what we love about V1, but fixing the one thing that was, you know, ultimately a shortcoming, I think in terms of the redemption mechanism. So this user set interest rate, like just could not be more excited to be able to use that.
00:53:44.749 - 00:54:15.671, Speaker B: And so on that note, we should close out. I want to make sure you get to answer the most important question of like when is V2 expected to go live? But before we do that, just a quick reminder to our listeners. They should learn more about Liquidy by going to liquidy.org they should follow Liquidy protocol on Twitter X. They should follow Michael and Max's handles. Michael's is Svobita Michael. So just last name and first name and that's in our show notes.
00:54:15.671 - 00:54:53.205, Speaker B: And then Max, it's his last name, underscore Max. So check that out in the show notes. Make sure you follow them. They've got lots of interesting insights to share on Twitter. And then yeah, guys, thank you for coming on. It is a privilege when we have a team like yours that's willing to, you know, have a conversation like this. Liquidy V2 is definitely a protocol that I'm looking to use as like a long time defi user, someone who's looking for leverage on eth, someone that's looking to access stable coins that are relying reliable and censorship resistant.
00:54:53.205 - 00:54:58.625, Speaker B: So that all said, when can we expect V2 to go live?
00:54:58.745 - 00:55:19.455, Speaker A: Yes. So we finished coding, more or less. Oops. So the code is public. You can look into that. We are now doing the audit. If everything goes well and kind of, we haven't overlooked anything major, we hope to go live in November.
00:55:19.455 - 00:55:44.501, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's the plan, as you know. Yeah, there can be unforeseen things and if we need to go back to the drawing board, we will do that. But then we'll have some delays. But I think there is a lot out there to kind of prepare. As we said, code is out there. Really great readme that Rick did. I haven't seen such a detailed source readme for a long time.
00:55:44.501 - 00:55:57.893, Speaker A: Testnet is live so soon. We'll also make the UI live, so there is a lot people can already learn and look into to shorten the time until now.
00:55:58.029 - 00:56:15.191, Speaker B: And one more reminder for listeners, just check the show notes on this, whether you're listening to the podcast or watching the video. And we'll try our best to add some of the helpful resources that you know are there for folks that want to Prepare for that V2 launch.
00:56:15.303 - 00:56:20.207, Speaker A: It's such a pleasure to talk about these things with you, so thanks a lot.
