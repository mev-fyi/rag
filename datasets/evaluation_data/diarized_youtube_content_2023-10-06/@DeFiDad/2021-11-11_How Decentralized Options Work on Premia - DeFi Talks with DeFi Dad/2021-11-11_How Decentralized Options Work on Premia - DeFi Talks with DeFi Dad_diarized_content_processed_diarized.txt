00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.822, Speaker A: Stream at the start or after, you know.
00:00:05.876 - 00:00:20.942, Speaker B: Well, actually, we're going to be live here in just a minute. You guys will want to reshare. There's a link if you go onto Twitter. Just check out my Twitter profile and you can reshare that. That's right. There's also on YouTube. Yeah.
00:00:20.942 - 00:00:44.314, Speaker B: So. Hey, everyone, thanks for joining. This is Defi talks with Defi dad. It's Wednesday, November 10, 2021. I'm joined here today with core contributors from Premia Finance. So Premia is a decentralized options protocol. It has been a long held, beloved use case in DFI that I've loved to dig into.
00:00:44.314 - 00:01:05.540, Speaker B: Part of the reason is I have no background in options, and I actually learned all that I know about options from Defi. And so I'm sort of honored here to have the team here to kind of walk me through how premia works, how the average Defi user can use decentralized options through premia. So, guys, welcome to the show. Thanks for joining. How are you doing?
00:01:06.150 - 00:01:26.850, Speaker C: Thanks for having us. We're very excited to be here. And actually, between us, we sort of discussed coming on your show, and we sort of all came to the consensus that we've been individually following the stuff that you put out. And we really appreciate just the education that you're bringing to the space. So thanks for having us once again, we're very excited.
00:01:27.010 - 00:01:28.760, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having us on.
00:01:29.150 - 00:02:23.050, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, good. And it's just fun to talk with all of you with your avatars here. Actually, I'm going to remove the banner there just so people can see your names, because if they were to go to premia finance, there's a link to get into the discord. And if they get in the discord, that's a great place to start to learn about premia and get to know all of you and talk with others that are in the community. But maybe we should start with just what is premia? I kind of laid it out like what it is you do as a decentralized options protocol. But maybe you could talk a bit about how the team came together. And really, I guess, what is the problem that you're trying to solve for, given that there are other Defi options protocols, what's actually unique about what you're building with premium?
00:02:23.710 - 00:03:02.162, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So, in fact, we're not just one team that came together. We are two teams that sort of united for the purpose of releasing what is currently our live product, which is the premium V two. And to sort of zoom out and outline the general picture of why we're here. A while ago, we asked ourselves the question, what is it particularly about DFI that got people really excited? And it was the yield. Basically the notion that you can put in some asset and you can earn respectable yield from it. But if you look at what is generating this yield, it's fundamentally two factors.
00:03:02.162 - 00:04:13.290, Speaker C: One is the willingness to borrow, and the second is the expected future value of the liquidity mining rewards. And we think, okay, those will run out someday. And in order to bring the next five to 10 million people to decentralized finance, we need to give them a source of expected return. And if fiat legacy markets are any indication of what is to follow, then the next source of return will be underwriting volatility. But in order to achieve this, in order to achieve this beautifully packaged volatility, products to users that they can simply put their money in and forget, there need to exist pieces of the market infrastructure that currently do not exist today, and specifically the options infrastructure. And many teams have attempted to create an options infrastructure that works, but most of them have just tried to copy what's been done in legacy finance. But very quickly we've realized that just copying the models that work in legacy finance usually do not work because they're created for very liquid markets.
00:04:13.290 - 00:04:27.060, Speaker C: Whereas in defi it's important to optimize market microstructure for going from zero to one, meaning a market that can function with lower volumes of liquidity. And this is exactly what we've built.
00:04:29.670 - 00:04:43.378, Speaker B: Anything else you want to add there? Just till what is unique while we're explaining it, because we are going to actually walk through this. So I know that's the more exciting thing, is to sort of show it off and how it differs.
00:04:43.554 - 00:05:46.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll chime in here. I think one of the big motivations for us creating premia from the start was none of the options protocols that existed were solving the problems that we thought needed to be solved. Specifically, LPs were consistently getting wrecked on existing platforms. I don't want to name any names, but if you go back to December of 2020, there was a specific platform that lost their LPs millions of dollars in a single day because the implied volatility was not updated to match the market. Basically, any of these systems which are setting the implied volatility manually, they ran into issues whenever the volatility jumped too fast or whenever they were mispricing things and they didn't have any sort of way to price the actual capital in the pool. There was no idea of supply and demand. So when you go to a pool like uniswap, the more you buy from the pool, the more incrementally it's going to cost you because you're taking away liquidity from that pool.
00:05:46.646 - 00:06:41.946, Speaker A: The same sort of thing happens on premium because we were seeing on different options platforms at the time, you could legitimately purchase all of the liquidity in the pool at the market rate, even if the market rate was known to be below the market rate on all of the other platforms. So this would mean LPs could get wrecked at any instant if the price was ever below what should be the actual market rate. So this is one thing that we've taken very much care into designing into the premia platform is to ensure that the base price that's recommended by premia comes from the most liquid options markets. That comes from our volatility, Oracle. We've partnered with Chainlink to make sure our Oracle has the same security guarantees as their price oracles that all of. And so basically this volatility, Oracle, serves as the base for the price. But then we have the C value, which is specific to our pools, which allows the pools to determine the price based on that value.
00:06:41.946 - 00:07:24.170, Speaker A: So if there's not enough supply in the pool based on the amount of demand that comes to purchase options, then the price will slowly go up over time. And if somebody tries to purchase all of the liquidity in the pool, they will have a high price impact compared to somebody trying to purchase a much smaller amount from the pool. We think this is important in order to scale defi markets, just like Carlos was saying, because the initial problem with these markets is going from zero to one. And if while you're going from zero to one, all of your LPs get wrecked because you have a system that's not set up correctly or doesn't handle these exogenous events, then you're not going to be able to scale from zero to one again because no one's going to trust your system. So it's very important for us that we solved this before we launched our markets.
00:07:24.590 - 00:07:29.750, Speaker B: So did you say there is an oracle just for implied volatility, is that correct?
00:07:29.920 - 00:08:19.530, Speaker A: Yes, it's called our volatility surface oracle. Essentially how it works is we take the options prices from the most liquid markets across centralized exchanges because that's where the most liquidity is. There's something like $12 billion in liquidity off chain mainly. Like, I think 90% of it's in derabit. So we take those prices of the other chains and we aggregate them and push them to our oracle on chain. It's secured by Chainlink nodes and it runs on the same methodology where it has a heartbeat. And then we're working on the deviation such that if the volatility surface ever differs on chain from the surface on chain by a certain deviation percentage, it will be updated automatically.
00:08:22.030 - 00:08:23.610, Speaker B: Go ahead Carlos. What were you saying?
00:08:23.680 - 00:09:04.986, Speaker C: Oh yeah, sorry, we're just so far apart and the signal takes time to travel. So my apologies if I talk over you, but yeah, I just wanted to add that in terms of oracle tech, we're working on something very exciting because it's one thing to enable markets for assets that exist in the real world, like deribit for ether and bitcoin, but it's a completely different challenge to create markets for assets that do not have any types of options. Liquidity, let's say the Uniswap token, for example, the urine finance token or any other token that doesn't have a functioning options market. And there's something very exciting we're currently working on, but we don't want to talk about it just yet. We just want to get it to.
00:09:05.008 - 00:09:28.180, Speaker B: Production and just show makes sense. Guys, the Oracle then that you're using, is that all brand new? I've never heard of that before. And that's exciting because obviously we're all looking for what are those next innovations in Defi? And this seems like one really great example of that.
00:09:28.630 - 00:10:08.698, Speaker A: Yeah, it's new. As of last Monday. That's when it launched on main. We've been working with Chainlink for the past few months to ensure that everything's done in the best way possible and to ensure that the data on chain is as accurate as possible given gas constraints. And so we think the system that we've put together is the best that we can possibly do on chain. So yeah, essentially you can go to our discord and you can find the ether scan link for it. But it works very similar to a chainlink price feed where it's just a smart contract on chain where Chainlink nodes push updates to the data on that smart contract.
00:10:08.698 - 00:10:34.934, Speaker A: And then any smart contract on chain or user can query that smart contract to get the current volatility surface values. So what that means in practice is our amm on premium can query what the volatility for a specific strike price and maturity combination for a specific token should be. And it can use that to get the base price of an option before any supply and demand specific changes.
00:10:35.132 - 00:10:42.230, Speaker C: Which is a technical way of saying this is just another step to make sure LPs in our system do not get wrecked.
00:10:42.390 - 00:10:42.970, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:10:43.040 - 00:11:00.878, Speaker B: Very cool. No, really cool. This is what I was looking for, is what's new and what's novel about what you're building. Would now be a good time then for us to start to walk through premia? Should we start to walk through the app? Unless there's anything else you guys want.
00:11:00.884 - 00:11:50.270, Speaker C: To cover, let's go through it. And actually, as froggy sort of setting up the demonstration, another thing that's equally as important is the liquidity aware pricing mechanism that we have within our pools. So, long story short, the way it works, there is amount of liquidity in the pool, and anyone can buy options from the pool and underwrite options within the pool, basically. And the more capital goes out of the pool, the more expensive the options are. And the more capital goes in the pool, the cheaper the options get. So the pool constantly adjusts the pricing curve based on the supply and demand of capital. So it's not just some price that we give to option buyers and LPs, it's the price that the market determines.
00:11:52.370 - 00:12:21.238, Speaker B: Very cool. Very cool. Well, feel free to just take it away here, froggy or anyone else. But yeah, like I said, I kind of want to dig through this. Like anyone who's going to be new to the platform, there are going to be those that are very familiar with options that I think will have an easy time navigating premium. But I can speak again as more of, like, a novice user with options. It's also very easy to navigate.
00:12:21.238 - 00:12:23.580, Speaker B: So anyways. Yeah, take it away.
00:12:24.910 - 00:13:11.340, Speaker A: Okay, great. So we're just starting here at Premia Finance, which is just our landing page for users who want to figure out what premium is about. We thought it was important to have a professional landing page so users could learn about Premia without diving straight in. I think everyone's starting to do this now, but you come here and you can hit open app or you can just go to app Premier finance and you will get to our actual application. Right now, I don't have any active positions on this account, so it just shows no average positions. But if I want to, I can just get right started and jump into buying options. We support three assets currently on the platform, though we're looking to add more in the near future.
00:13:11.340 - 00:14:10.650, Speaker A: We wrapped bitcoin and link. You can buy puts or calls for each of these assets on the platform, and you can set your own strike price anywhere you want within the allowed range and the platform will quote you a price. You could also set your date, your expiration date whenever you want to get that price. However, we default to these nice values, the dates are defaulted to derivative expirations by default to allow for easy arbitrage. And the strike prices are defaulted to prices that we think are most likely to be used by users. And this allows for basically anytime the same strike or expiration is used, it decreases the gas price of the user. So we can just come in here, we could say, I want to buy a weak put.
00:14:10.650 - 00:14:59.180, Speaker A: Let's say I want something if it goes below $4,000. So how options work is a put option is basically buying insurance, saying I'd like to sell ETH at $4,000. If ETH ever goes below $4,000, I'd like to do this anytime before December 31. So options on premium are american. That means you can exercise anytime before the actual expiration date that you choose. So if I do this, let's say I want to purchase two ether puts at a 4000 strike price before December 31. What this means is that this option can be exercised for a profit if the price of weath ever drops below the break even price of 37 21 by the expiration date of December 31, 2021.
00:15:00.610 - 00:15:08.014, Speaker B: Got it? The way that these settle, you do have to actually exercise the option, right?
00:15:08.212 - 00:15:53.630, Speaker A: Right, yeah. So the way the options work is currently, in order to take profit on an option, you would need to exercise it for the intrinsic value. We are currently working on adding functionality for users to sell the options back to the pool for their full intrinsic plus extrinsic value. But this would require LPs taking on more risk than they've currently signed up for in our current architecture. So our mantra is protect LPs at all costs and otherwise enable the best risk market possible. So because of this, we are working on adding the sell feature back in in a way that doesn't allow for LPs to take on unnecessary risk. And this is coming, this is the thing that we're working on most actively.
00:15:53.630 - 00:16:01.422, Speaker A: But yes, it's not currently allowed in the platform. So in order to sell a position, you would exercise it, which is shown here in the break.
00:16:01.476 - 00:16:19.730, Speaker B: Even when we're exercising, are we actually then like, if I buy put options for, let's say, two e, do I have to actually submit two ETH to exercise, or do I just take my profits?
00:16:19.890 - 00:16:57.300, Speaker A: No, you just take your profits. So what happens is when you purchase this two ether put option, the die that's required in order to make sure you can always sell it for the strike price before the expiration is locked in that option. And when you exercise, you're given back the difference between the profit that you've made from that exercise. So it's essentially like a flash exercise in certain systems, but it's just an automatic flash exercise because there's no reason to require somebody to pay collateral and then get it right back in the same transaction. We can just pay them the difference instead.
00:16:57.990 - 00:17:34.858, Speaker B: Got it? Yeah. I actually like the fact that you can exercise whenever you want up until that date, just because of the volatility of crypto. And I think it actually gives you the sort of power that you want holding that option versus, and you guys will have to correct me, isn't it is european style options where it settles past that date? Basically, you don't exercise before the date. You just wait until the date, and then you either get your profits then or your losses.
00:17:35.034 - 00:18:12.426, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. That's how european options work. But this isn't ideal because let's say if you go to, like, a traditional market right now for a quarter, Larry, Tesla just ran up 50% in the span of one week. And then two days, it dropped like 20% because Elon Musk sold his shares. So if you had call options, american options, you could have sold on the 50% run up before Elon sold, and you could have taken your profits. But if you had european options that expired, let's say, in December, you would still have to hold through all of that and you wouldn't be able to exercise early.
00:18:12.608 - 00:18:28.158, Speaker B: There we go. Yeah, this all makes sense. I feel like this is the most user friendly sort of approach for DeFi options, at least from the DeFi options protocols that I've had a chance to use.
00:18:28.324 - 00:18:47.670, Speaker A: That's our goal with everything, is just ensure that the user experience is as seamless as possible. And that includes LP expected returns, LP not get wrecked status, the price of options that's actually offered by the platform. We take that all as user experience, which we try to optimize.
00:18:48.090 - 00:18:56.966, Speaker B: Can you talk about this from the opposite angle then? Actually, sorry, maybe you want to finish out the buy confirmation here, but, yeah.
00:18:56.988 - 00:18:58.198, Speaker A: Let'S just do that real quick.
00:18:58.284 - 00:18:58.678, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:58.764 - 00:19:52.138, Speaker A: So essentially, you can see that the cost of this option is $557 in order to have the option to sell to ETH at $4,000 by December 31. So let's say ETH went to $3,500 before then, I would be able to exercise these two options for $444 of profit. You can see that the potential PNL in the top, right. So if I want to buy these options. I can either buy it with DAi, the pool's underlying asset, but because I have no Dai, let's say I want to purchase it with ETH, you can do that right here at premium. We think it's important to take advantage of the composability of know everyone's built these composable defi money legos that allow you to swap from one platform on another platform. But not a lot of platforms are actually taking advantage of that.
00:19:52.138 - 00:20:06.320, Speaker A: So we thought it was important to do that. So here in one transaction, you can purchase your option with any token you want, and the swap will be done on uniswap or Sushiswap, whichever one has the best price at that current time.
00:20:09.170 - 00:20:10.240, Speaker B: Very cool.
00:20:11.490 - 00:20:33.160, Speaker A: And so I'll just purchase it here. Who knows about gas prices? So basically, you can see that down here. I've set my gas price to the fastest gas price setting. But because Ethereum is going through wild gas fluctuations right now, who knows how long this transaction is actually going to take?
00:20:35.690 - 00:20:47.382, Speaker B: Since you are on l one right now, are there any plans already set in stone for will you deploy on like an arbitrum or optimism?
00:20:47.446 - 00:20:49.498, Speaker A: Yeah, we're deploying on arbitrum this month.
00:20:49.664 - 00:21:28.226, Speaker C: Absolutely. And for L2, what we want to do is we don't just want to copy paste the system that we have, because when designing premium V two, we were able to do on layer one maybe 20% of all of the cool stuff that we wanted to do initially. So we want to invest a little bit more time to make sure we can roll out the features on L2, which we haven't been able to roll out on layer one, such as risk aware automated market makers, such as just a number of very cool features that require more computation than we currently have on layer one?
00:21:28.348 - 00:22:27.340, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot in the DFI UX that's about to get that much better. One, obviously is we're excited for everything to move to l two, just like premia. And then we're right around the corner, too. From the Ethereum push notification service. It would allow someone, they could set up a notification that says, tell me when my options are in the money, and then they could receive a notification at their wallet address and be able then to quickly react to that. So there's a lot from web two that we still aren't benefiting from in terms of the quick and easy user experience that we're used to there, but in web3, so that's exciting. Would you guys then want to talk about this from the other side of this, as someone who wants to write or sell options.
00:22:28.510 - 00:23:08.098, Speaker A: Yes, let's do that. So I'm going to reload the platform from an account that doesn't have any deposit. Okay. So on the lp side of things, there are the pools. This is similar to uniswap style pools. Well, in the fact that you can deposit and remove from them, and you can see how much you have and how much you burn and that kind of thing. But what happens is when you deposit your capital to a call pool, your capital will be used to underwrite the options that are purchased from the amm.
00:23:08.098 - 00:24:31.906, Speaker A: So let's say you deposit 100 ether into the call pool, and then somebody comes and buys 100 ether worth of call options. If your capital was the only capital in the pool, then your capital would be used to underwrite those options, and you would receive all of the fees, the premiums that the user paid here, the price that they paid, you would receive all of those premiums in your pool, and then you would also take on the risk for that option. What that means is if the user ends up later exercising that option in profit, the amount that they profit from the option would be taken from the collateral that was locked in that option. And so the profit overall from that total transaction that the LPs incur is the difference between the premium that they sold the option for and the price that the option was ultimately exercised for. And so in traditional markets, LPs maintain a consistent return over time, because not all options are exercised in profit. And so this enables new risk markets where LPs can underwrite this volatility and users can come trade against it at the market determined price. And both parties can be happy because the LPs are earning a market dependent return that's expected to be good.
00:24:31.906 - 00:24:40.520, Speaker A: And the traders can find options that are priced well at market prices, and they can get the access to the risk that they need.
00:24:41.530 - 00:25:04.718, Speaker B: So this really dumbs down the experience of writing and selling options. This is a peer to pool model. So you can just go here, and in this case, if I want to sell call options, I'm just depositing. And this would be call options for ether. I'm just depositing ether and that's the end of it.
00:25:04.884 - 00:25:19.010, Speaker A: Yes. And you would just accumulate rewards over time or losses if somebody exercised in profit. And then because we have our premium liquidity mining program, you'll also be accumulating premium token rewards while you're in the pool.
00:25:19.590 - 00:25:47.290, Speaker B: Whoa. Yeah, I just noticed that those are some nice looking yield numbers. So just a reminder too, to everybody. As I'm commenting on all of this, this is all brand new to me. I did have a chance to play around a little bit with premium, but I have no sort of investment in this. These are my genuine reactions to, I think what I think is cool. And then obviously those yield numbers are nice looking.
00:25:47.290 - 00:26:04.130, Speaker B: I mean, earning 61% depositing ether into the call pool there, that is really nice. On the other side of that, if I'm writing options for puts, I'm earning almost 120% in the premium token.
00:26:04.470 - 00:26:35.002, Speaker A: Yes, that's correct. Currently there's room for about 1000 more ether before we hit the pool cap, on the call ether pool, and then on the put pool, there's room for about 400,000 before we hit the cap. And then as we hit the caps, we will wait till the utilization gets to a solid number, and then we'll raise those caps to allow more people to deposit. More risk to be taken on. This is just to follow our mantra. Make sure LPs don't get wrecked. Make sure that people can't deposit more than we know.
00:26:35.002 - 00:26:37.878, Speaker A: Show has been secure in the past, froggy.
00:26:37.894 - 00:27:27.820, Speaker C: And if you scroll down for a bit, what you will see on premium that you will not see anywhere else is the current price level, which is basically the equilibrium mechanic showing if the options from the given pool trade at a premium or a discount. So currently the price level is 1.27, which means that all of the options at this pool are purchasable at a 27% premium to the underlying model price. So what that means is if an LP deposits ether into this pool now, their funds will be used to underwrite more expensive options than otherwise available on the market. But each incremental deposit will drive this price level down until buyers are once again happy to come and purchase options.
00:27:30.370 - 00:27:42.510, Speaker B: Very cool, guys. How long are the liquidity mining programs running the numbers that we just referred to for the call pools and the put pool?
00:27:43.010 - 00:28:13.210, Speaker A: So the APY will not stay that high. Essentially, the more deposits that come into the pool, the more the APY it will come down. It works exactly the same as sushiswap onsen, where the amount of rewards to each pool is constant per block. So then the more liquidity in the pool, the lower the APY goes. And then if we need to, we can adjust that by assigning more allocation points to a certain pool compared to a different pool. Exactly the same as onsen.
00:28:13.950 - 00:28:25.040, Speaker B: Very cool. And do you mind clicking over to the wrapped bitcoin or link call and put pools? Just curious, like, what numbers are there.
00:28:26.850 - 00:28:36.114, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to move inside. Problem with my connection up.
00:28:36.152 - 00:28:43.700, Speaker B: There we go. Yeah. Wow. There's some juicy yields to earn there.
00:28:44.070 - 00:28:44.530, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:44.600 - 00:28:47.700, Speaker B: Hopefully someone's watching this and realizes that.
00:28:48.230 - 00:28:53.206, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. We'd like to get these pools filled, because the more they get filled, the.
00:28:53.228 - 00:28:58.838, Speaker A: Higher the utilization can go, the more volume we can fill, and then the more we can allow the pool caps to go.
00:28:58.924 - 00:29:05.340, Speaker D: So, yeah, we encourage, if you have capital sitting idle and you want to take advantage of these yields, come to the platform.
00:29:05.710 - 00:29:10.602, Speaker C: And if it's not triple digits, is it even defi yield? I mean, what are we talking about?
00:29:10.736 - 00:29:13.918, Speaker D: It won't triple digits for long.
00:29:14.084 - 00:29:15.566, Speaker A: As soon as these pool caps get.
00:29:15.588 - 00:29:22.894, Speaker D: Filled and more can get deposited, those triple digits will come down to double digits. But for now, they're quite high.
00:29:22.932 - 00:29:23.326, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:23.428 - 00:29:58.266, Speaker E: The idea was to model it in a way that wouldn't attract mercenary capital, but would attract capital that felt like it was a safe yield to deposit capital in these pools and not feel like they need to check every day for whether they're getting wrecked or not. We're experienced in DeFi. We've all participated in lots of farms and seen how they go, so kind of took a strategic and educated approach to how we wanted our emission rate to go from here and be applied to these pools so people felt comfortable with the assets that are most liquid that they're used to and sticking them.
00:29:58.288 - 00:30:09.294, Speaker B: Into the pools here, guys, one more question for what's on screen there. What does smart deposit refer to up top? There's all pools. And then I see smart deposit, right?
00:30:09.332 - 00:30:26.626, Speaker D: So let's say you have some asset, but you're not really sure which pool you want to deposit it in. You're kind of neutral for your assets. You can come here, and you can select that asset. I only have ether, so I'm going to select ether. But you could select any DeFi asset.
00:30:26.658 - 00:30:31.490, Speaker A: That you have in your wallet. Anything that's tradable on uniswap or sushiswap.
00:30:31.570 - 00:30:34.694, Speaker D: So I'll select ether. I'll say I want to deposit one.
00:30:34.732 - 00:30:37.602, Speaker A: Ether into the put pools.
00:30:37.666 - 00:30:56.880, Speaker D: So this will recommend me only pools that are selling puts. And then basically, it'll optimize for the average sea level after you deposit. What this means is it will optimize for your average expected return against the neutral average return.
00:30:57.490 - 00:30:58.462, Speaker B: Very cool.
00:30:58.596 - 00:31:02.640, Speaker D: Currently takes a little bit longer than.
00:31:02.950 - 00:31:05.620, Speaker A: It is expected to.
00:31:05.990 - 00:31:17.734, Speaker D: We just updated the model to add a couple more constraints, because, essentially, sometimes it was recommending users deposit 1% in one pool and 99% in another, which.
00:31:17.772 - 00:31:20.150, Speaker A: Isn'T optimal for gas reasons.
00:31:21.050 - 00:31:54.770, Speaker B: That's really cool though. I like tools like this that sort of take the guesswork out of where someone should put their money. You ask a really simple question like what's a token that you have that you'd be willing to put up? In this case, if you don't have ETH wrapped bitcoin link or a stable coin you are actually trading then, right? You're swapping the underlying token for them.
00:31:54.920 - 00:32:46.802, Speaker C: Yeah, it would happen actually in the future. The smart deposit feature is something we're really excited about because it all goes back to what you outlined. The one limited resource in this space is attention. And complicated systems sometimes shoot themselves in the foot by making the UI non intuitive, by making the documentation complex. And that's not conducive to where we want to go as an industry. We want to make things very simple, very intuitive, easy to understand, so that people without options, experience, but who understand what they want to do can go on the platform, go to the smart deposit and say, hey, I think this is going to happen in the future. Maybe, hey, ether is going to become more volatile, or hey, maybe the price of link is going to go down.
00:32:46.802 - 00:32:55.650, Speaker C: And then the system ultimately constructs the best possible position they can have so that they can place their bets accordingly.
00:32:56.890 - 00:33:17.306, Speaker B: There's two other things I missed here on screen. If you click on stake, is that just for staking premium? Okay, there we go. So premium is one way I could earn is X premia like X sushi? Am I earning fees? Cool. That's really cool.
00:33:17.408 - 00:33:22.986, Speaker D: I just want to explain, we did update the smart deposit feature earlier today.
00:33:23.088 - 00:33:27.886, Speaker A: And so it won't load forever for you if you go use this. I'm going to go fix this right.
00:33:27.908 - 00:33:30.640, Speaker D: After this call and figure out exactly why that's happening.
00:33:31.730 - 00:33:35.342, Speaker B: No, it's really cool though. I get it.
00:33:35.476 - 00:34:07.690, Speaker D: Yeah, let me give it a description mentally so people can understand what they would see. So let's say you deposit maker and wrapped bitcoin here and you select call pool. And then the optimization comes and it says, hey, the wrapped bitcoin call pool has the highest sea level. After you deposit all of these assets into it, you could then make one transaction to deposit both your maker and your wrapped bitcoin into that wrapped bitcoin pool. And any asset that wasn't wrapped bitcoin would be swapped to wrapped bitcoin to fill that pool.
00:34:08.510 - 00:34:12.542, Speaker B: One follow up to that. When you say sea level, what does that mean again?
00:34:12.676 - 00:34:13.022, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:34:13.076 - 00:34:30.500, Speaker D: That is the pool price level here that users can see here. This is the premium or the discount against the volatility surface which is provided by centralized options markets, right? So this is essentially saying premium has a 38% premium against centralized options markets right now.
00:34:31.110 - 00:34:31.890, Speaker B: Very cool.
00:34:31.960 - 00:34:38.854, Speaker D: So when users LPs deposit into a pool with a higher C level, they're expected a higher average return than one.
00:34:38.892 - 00:34:40.038, Speaker A: With a lower C level.
00:34:40.124 - 00:34:43.250, Speaker D: And then the same is oppositely true for option buyers.
00:34:43.410 - 00:34:48.680, Speaker B: Makes sense. All makes sense. What is the swap option at the very bottom there?
00:34:49.050 - 00:35:01.518, Speaker D: So we thought it was important to allow users to swap on our platform so that they didn't have to go to a different platform just to swap assets. If you're going to be trading options, you're probably going to be trading other tokens as well.
00:35:01.684 - 00:35:20.420, Speaker B: No? Makes sense. Very cool. Very cool. Now I understand why a few friends that said to check out premium. Now I get it. There's really been a lot of thought that's gone into making this easy. It's really cool.
00:35:20.420 - 00:36:14.670, Speaker B: Anytime I see the X premium type of opportunity too, that to me it matters. Governance tokens are clearly valuable. I think if you could easily look at something like Ave and compound and you look at the voting power, like what it can mean to be able to vote, to put up some collateral on those money markets. But I do think beyond just like voting power, I think it's important to have this claim on. I really, I like that with X Premium being very similar to X sushi and I think X sushi has sort of set that standard over the past year. So I'm hoping more defi projects are able to follow up on that. But guys, anything else that you wanted to cover? Anything else that you think we missed?
00:36:14.750 - 00:36:46.958, Speaker E: Well, just something to highlight over the swap feature. It utilizes a zero x API so it actually is aggregating and grabbing you the best rate from 30 different dexes right now that are selected in there. And if you have preferences you can remove them or add which ones you want. It will. And doubling back a little bit for the smart deposit. We were talking about main defi assets like Maker and WBTC at the time. Let's say you're a degenerate and you have, I don't know, dinger and those, you can do that the same way.
00:36:46.958 - 00:37:00.930, Speaker E: It doesn't have to be like a native blue chip token that's in that token list. You can swap anything on the swap modal that has a liquid market or has some liquidity in a market as well as in the smart deposit because it's doing all that on the background.
00:37:02.310 - 00:37:34.510, Speaker B: It's really cool. It's really cool. I like the fact, too that that's incorporated in other parts of the website too, where you would get stuck sometimes, like having to go swap for another token. Those things make a big difference. It's part of the reason I was really proud of everything that was being created at Zapper. I thought our engineers at Zapper just did an incredible job of streamlining lots of steps and putting them into things like zaps. This is really clever.
00:37:34.510 - 00:37:55.086, Speaker B: But guys, anything else that you wanted to cover about premium? It seems like if you want to get involved, you're going to want to go to, I mentioned here, app Premia finance, and of course get into the discord. That's always a great place to get involved, but, yeah. Anything else here that's worth noting?
00:37:55.278 - 00:37:57.746, Speaker D: Yeah, I think you touched on the.
00:37:57.768 - 00:37:59.078, Speaker A: Fee sharing a little bit, and I.
00:37:59.084 - 00:38:34.650, Speaker D: Just want to go into it a little bit more in depth. I think Premia is becoming a dow. And part of that, we want our community to be a massive part in the future of determining what premium is becoming and what's important on the premia platform. And so from day one, we had no VC, no anything like that. It was no precede rounds. We thought it was important to allow the community from day one to manage this journey. And addition to that, that's why we have this XPremia system, which is very similar to X sushi.
00:38:34.650 - 00:39:07.510, Speaker D: Xushi was a very similar model. It was like community started. The whole thing was community run from day one. That's the type of vibe that we have around premia. And if you come into our discord, you'll notice that the community members are constantly putting forward proposals that get viewed by our community. And we actually put them into the protocol because we think it's very important for the community to be leading the future of premium. And that's why if you stake your premium here, you'll get access to 80% of the fees that are collected on the protocol.
00:39:07.510 - 00:39:28.578, Speaker D: Instead of sending it to a treasury that nobody sees, it gets sent to the stakers of Premia. Those that made premia what it is today. And we plan to continue to have that sort of mantra where it's community led, community first, and those who got us to where we are today will be the first ones rewarded for that.
00:39:28.744 - 00:40:13.060, Speaker C: Yeah. And so as Froggy mentioned, the best place to learn more about what we're doing is come talk to us in discord. We have a bunch of documentation available on our system currently live. And in the next couple of weeks we will be releasing the sort of technical mathematical white paper which we're now in the process from condensing from 51 pages to less. But at any point in time, we are looking to get the best people involved in helping us build what we're building. So if what you're listening, you like, just reach out to us. Whether you're an engineer, a financial engineer, whether you do operations, whatever you think you can contribute, reach out to us and maybe we can build this together.
00:40:13.670 - 00:40:28.920, Speaker B: It's really cool. Guys, one other thing I had noticed. So the token was live long before this, right? I mean, this is a token that's existed for many months, but the platform only recently went live.
00:40:30.250 - 00:41:19.240, Speaker D: Well, v one of the platform existed for a while, but when we launched that back in February, at the same time as the token, we realized that peer to peer markets, those that require underwriters to underwrite a specific strike and maturity, and buyers to come by a specific strike maturity and find that pair one to one. There's not enough liquidity in the options markets in defi yet to enable those markets. So we were having liquidity markets and not a whole lot of volume. And so now when we switch to this amm, we already have more liquidity, we already have more volume, and users are able to trade any option that they want to, rather than just the one that's provided by the market maker on the platform.
00:41:19.610 - 00:42:08.658, Speaker B: That's cool. Didn't realize I missed that part of the story then. So you had originally launched as peer to peer and now you've moved to this peer to pool model. I think it's good to highlight that only because I think people don't realize all the work and time and effort that goes into building a protocol like this. And the assumption is just that things come together overnight when really here you've had your own, whatever shortcomings and had to pivot already. So that's a great story to tell, especially with where you guys are at right now. Well, congrats on this new launch.
00:42:08.658 - 00:42:29.980, Speaker B: And yeah, just excited to continue to sort of follow your progress. And I would again remind everyone, you can check out app Premia finance again, the discord link is there as well. And don't forget to follow premia on Twitter. Guys, anything else to share before we go?
00:42:30.350 - 00:42:50.434, Speaker C: No, we just want to say thanks for having us, really. This was a fun experience and you're just doing what we collectively all have to do. We just have to break down how these systems work and present them to users in a way that's understandable without too much complexity. So, yeah, this was a lot of fun.
00:42:50.632 - 00:43:09.960, Speaker B: Yeah. Really? No, thank you. I learned a lot here and I think every time I get to talk about options, I love to reveal just how little I understand about options. So that always shines through in every interview. They're like, did he just ask? What question did he just ask? What is he talking about?
00:43:11.370 - 00:43:13.910, Speaker C: Options that nobody really understands.
00:43:13.990 - 00:43:41.582, Speaker B: Nobody understands them. No. This has been awesome, guys. Well, I'll end the broadcast and then we'll be back in the little virtual green room. And just, everyone, thanks for tuning in. If you enjoyed this, subscribe at Defi dad, I've got lots of interviews with leading builders like the team here from Premia. You can learn a lot as a builder, but also as a new defi user from all the different tutorials that I've got posted there.
00:43:41.582 - 00:43:46.598, Speaker B: So thanks so much, have a great week and we'll see you next time. Bye, everyone.
00:43:46.764 - 00:43:47.220, Speaker A: Bye, everyone.
