00:00:02.250 - 00:00:58.346, Speaker A: Hi everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi. Dad, thanks for joining us. Today is two Tuesday, May 31, 2022. I'm joined here by David Silverman from Lens Protocol. David actually works at Ave, but Lens is a protocol that actually sits within the ave team. And so we're going to talk all today about web3 social. It's been a hot topic, I think, over the last few years as more have become familiar with what is web3? And I'm just excited to sort of share this because I only recently got more familiar with Lens protocol.
00:00:58.346 - 00:01:20.440, Speaker A: I had sort of been following the fact that they were building this. I just didn't realize all the progress they had made. And so I recently created a lenster profile which is very similar to Twitter. And I think you'll be very delighted to see how easy all of this is and I think how promising it is. So anyways, David, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:20.970 - 00:01:25.960, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks for having me. D five dad, doing well. Super excited to talk web3 social today.
00:01:26.330 - 00:02:10.290, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. And like I just mentioned, it was only a few weeks ago, we were at permissionless and I saw your guys booth and kind of had me wondering, okay, I am committed to this idea of what lens is building. I want decentralized social media or whatever that all encompasses. But then I actually got online and started to play with lens and claimed a handle and so on. So we're going to kind of walk through all of that today and screen share how easy it is. But why don't we just start with your background? How did you get started in crypto? And I'm curious how you found your way to aave.
00:02:10.890 - 00:02:50.290, Speaker B: Yeah, so as you mentioned, I'm a product manager here at Ave companies working on social products. My crypto journey begins actually a while ago. It was in late 2012, a friend of mine had sent me the bitcoin white paper. Jumped in as a miner originally and then started playing with some experiments back when colored coins was a thing. And then later on some early ETH smart contracts. Didn't dive super deep. Was still young at the time, definitely later came back doing my own fund where I'm a venture partner at three SC holdings as well as being involved in constitution, dow on the core team, and on the business development team of Index coupe.
00:02:50.290 - 00:03:00.280, Speaker B: Later joined Ave on the product team to work specifically on social products, including lens, the lens API, as well as some other stuff we have in the.
00:03:02.170 - 00:03:41.250, Speaker A: And I guess can you talk about what prompted you all to want to start building lens? Because I do remember, it felt like it came out of nowhere. I've been a longtime user of AavE, and I felt like Aave was a very ambitious project already. I mean, it's one of the most popular Defi protocols today as a lending and borrowing market. So I was taken aback a little and figured this must be like a side project that we'll hear about years from now. But again, to your credit, there's been a lot of progress. So what prompted creating lens protocol?
00:03:41.830 - 00:04:41.720, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it's been a little over a year since lens has been in development here at AavE companies, and Ave, obviously was the first protocol that we released here at Ave companies, and it speaks towards, I think, the larger vision of the company, which is really trying to make sure that web3 and its ideals and its technologies accessible to all that started with decentralized finance, is now extending into decentralized social. I think part of it is realizing that we can take the power of blockchains and specifically of NFTs, which is the technology that lens is built on top of, and use it to really fix a lot of problems that we've seen with existing social media today. Taking data and allowing it to be user owned, allowing it to be interoperable and really allowing it to be composable to be used across a whole variety of apps, and natively integrate with different apps that are working with DeFi, working with NFTs, and bring all of that together, really kind of maximizing some of the composability we've seen today and taking it to a new level.
00:04:42.650 - 00:05:11.760, Speaker A: Awesome. And I guess maybe you can walk us through some of the milestones along the way. As far as I can tell. Now, there's a protocol that if you have an idea for, let's just call it web3 social media, you can start to build with the social graph that is enabled by lens. So I guess what have been some of those milestones? And I'm also curious what's ahead in the coming months.
00:05:12.930 - 00:06:05.554, Speaker B: Totally. So, yeah, I think that the first big milestone we had was in February when we finally unveiled that we were building lens. We circled around this open letter manifesto and then revealed that it was aave behind it, and that lens was going to be our social graph protocol. Shortly after, in late February, we released the lens on Testnet as well as the lens API, which is really what let developers build for the first time. The API itself kind of abstracts away a lot of the smart contracts and allows you to kind of interact natively with the social graph, as if you were using an API from Twitter or others. And that led to a hackathon we did in conjunction with our good friends at ETH global called LF Grow, where we had over 55 projects come out that were entirely built on lens. A mix of different front ends, including Lenster, which is I know you used, it's a version of Twitter entirely built on top of lens, but including some other really great ones.
00:06:05.554 - 00:06:39.226, Speaker B: Iris XYZ, which is also live today, another front end built on top of lens. Definitely much more design focus, hash chat and tempora messenger instant messaging solutions, as well as some really cool smart contracts really pushing and expanding the lens system. And the next big milestone was we finally made it to Mainnet. This was app permissionless a few weeks ago. We finally launched, we did three test iterations and finally went on Mainnet. And we have a good number of apps today and tons and tons of developers now building on top of it. I don't have my stats in front of you.
00:06:39.226 - 00:07:03.650, Speaker B: I think even though you're doing a capped launch, we have across about 10,000 users, over 100,000 different follow connections, and the graph is really starting to grow and build. And the next big milestone for us is to start to take off training wheels, allow anyone to create a profile, allow anyone to get kind of modules and extensibility built in without needing the whitelist also and really kind of watching this ecosystem flourish.
00:07:03.990 - 00:07:09.126, Speaker A: And this is currently built on Polygon, right? That's what Mainnet is.
00:07:09.308 - 00:07:21.378, Speaker B: Yeah. Mainnet for us is we've deployed on polygon. Obviously the lens contracts themselves are written in solidity and you can deploy anywhere. But the canonical deployment that we are operating at Aave companies is on Polygon.
00:07:21.554 - 00:07:50.210, Speaker A: Very cool. I have a bunch of other questions, but I feel like we should start to screen share and show this because it makes so much more sense when you see it come to life. So I'll show your screen is. So we're going to start at lens XYz. And David, I'll let you just kind of talk us through this. But if you're going to get like go to lens XYZ where it's more informational, and then we're going to talk through how you can claim a lens handle.
00:07:51.270 - 00:08:17.542, Speaker B: Yeah, so obviously lens XYZ is the homepage. It really kind of describes the protocol for developers. You click in the developer garden, we even give you some ideas for users. You can jump in and explore some apps. We had a great FAQ for those. Really want to understand a bit more, but kind of what most people are interested is getting started today. Unfortunately, as I said, we're slowly letting people in view this for us as a TVL cap in DFI.
00:08:17.542 - 00:08:47.026, Speaker B: We're slowly whitelisting different groups to come claim their lens handles. For now, that's the people who signed our open letter before May 5, as well as other groups we're continuing to roll out. So please check either lens protocol on Twitter or at lens protocol on any lens enabled app to find out new groups that are enabled. But when your time, you can go click claim handle. You're going to sign in with your wallet. I'm already connected in here and then I can check handles here. I have a handle assigned to me.
00:08:47.026 - 00:09:11.050, Speaker B: I'm going to click continue and I get to pick my follow logic this is something the first kind of cool feature about lens. We have these ideas of kind of modules, places where it can extend the protocol. And one of the big ones is you define how people follow you. Right now there's four on main net today. Anyone can follow me. I can restrict it to only people in the lens systems. Only lens profiles can follow me.
00:09:11.050 - 00:09:24.318, Speaker B: I can make it so no one can follow me. I can set this up later or charge to follow. I can actually charge defi dad, you can charge people matic, USDC, ETH or Dai in order to have access to your content for a premium content creator.
00:09:24.414 - 00:10:20.580, Speaker A: Right? Because one thing not to skip over here, or that I personally, I think overlooked when I first got started here was the fact that the idea of followers is part of this base layer. And so when we think about like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, whatever, you have different followers on those platforms unless they're owned by the same company or they're integrated. And so in most cases, you have to basically restart here. This is sort of the base layer of all of these new decentralized social apps. And so your followers that you would have on one app will follow you to another. And so this gives you an opportunity as a creator to actually charge to follow. I chose to say anyone can follow because we're so early and the last thing I want is to gate people from being able to follow me on a decentralized social app.
00:10:22.390 - 00:10:56.266, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. And the cool thing about anyone can follow me is even if you don't have a profile today, you can go to lens enabled apps with your regular ethereum wallet and go ahead and follow your creators and start to collect follow NFTs and engage with their content without having a profile yourself. So definitely, even if you aren't able to mint today. Definitely something to explore. I'm going to go ahead and as you can see in the background, we're doing some gasless transactions to mint the profile directly and it's going to get dropped into my wallet here. This is an Ethereum.
00:10:56.266 - 00:11:37.530, Speaker B: We have a quick finality. So here we have testandprod lens has just been created and I can go and I can pick a profile picture. We let you pick NFTs or upload photos yourselves. And I'm going to skip this for now. But it can go and detect NFTs I have on Mainnet, Ethereum or on polygon directly. And then also I can start setting metadata so I can say that this is, I can pick my name, I can write a bio, all kinds of things you expect to have in different social networks. And again here I'm just being prompted to sign.
00:11:37.530 - 00:12:05.800, Speaker B: As I said, the lens contracts support different types of gasless interactions. And so in this case, this app, the lens claiming app itself, is covering the gas for every user claiming. And so with a simple signature, I'm updating my metadata and the fields that we've picked there, those aren't required. Any app can add additional metadata to your profile. You can yourself. And so as different apps come out that may want different fields in the profile or different settings, they want to save to a profile that can be added as well.
00:12:06.410 - 00:12:32.700, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, that's really the one major difference is that as you would normally save information to your profile, you're just signing a transaction, which is painless here because you're not paying any gas and it's all on Polygon, so it's quick and easy. Awesome, David. Okay, was there anything else there with the profile you think we should cover?
00:12:33.310 - 00:13:16.218, Speaker B: So I think with the know, it's going to look and feel very much like if you've worked with an Ens or an unstoppable domain profile, it looks very similar. And again, here's another app I'm jumping into called lens friends. Lens friends xYz. And as a profile owner, I can go in and edit it and I can set again, these are different fields that this app wants to add to my profile. So here I can even add my Twitter, I can add a website or I can create other links. Like I could say, hey, my ens is this or my mirror is this almost like a Lincoln bio type deal. I want to make it clear that while this information is public, I could later create encrypted versions, but this is also accessible, again, by every lens application.
00:13:16.218 - 00:13:40.078, Speaker B: I like to think about lens profiles as this little kind of like backpack or briefcase that I put my data in and I bring my data from app to app. It's no longer kind of the app owning the data as we do today in the Facebook or Twitter model, that I have to go to Twitter and they own all my data. It's I go to Twitter with my data, with my friendships, and I have Twitter. Then render an experience based on the information I am bringing. Yep.
00:13:40.174 - 00:14:34.180, Speaker A: Yeah, very similar to defi. You have your crypto assets, whatever you hold, and you can take that to aave or you can use it on any other protocol, but it's no longer siloed the way banking applications are. And so it's so cool to see this because this is something that we've all talked about, I think philosophically for years that something like this would come along. But like I said, it's built and it's early, but it's working once you get on here. The user experience to me is very reminiscent of the web two experience. Just, you got to have a wallet, you got to know how to sign that transaction when it prompts you. David, I think you mentioned a while ago to me when we were meeting about you're thinking of ways to sort of abstract that away.
00:14:34.180 - 00:14:41.926, Speaker A: Anything else you can share about that or what's being worked on to make the Ux even more similar to web two.
00:14:42.108 - 00:15:31.778, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I can say that already. We think that part of one of the key design principles we have at, obviously in the team building lenses is to really come with a user first design. We made sure to build in meta transactions everywhere to allow experiences like this where gas is abstracted. And I know there's a lot of teams both at AAVE and outside of AAVE, whether they be wallet providers or other apps themselves, that are looking at ways to kind of either make signatures easier to read, or if I am a wallet application itself, maybe abstracting away the signature, where I say this publish button or this post button, that's implicitly the user authorizing the action and I'm going to go ahead and allow it through. And part of that is really starting to think about these wallets as less so wallets, but more so as accounts. We're not really dealing with just financial applications anymore.
00:15:31.778 - 00:16:04.050, Speaker B: Right? With here, with web3 social, it's a lot less risky of an application just posting to my profile. And so for an easier user experience, generally users are going to be okay making that trade off. And obviously there's security considerations that's why I think a lot of teams are taking their time to make sure we do it right. But definitely looking forward to some experiences, hopefully coming in later in the year that will make you able to post and to follow and to take more actions on chain without the need to go through a signing interface or to go through worrying about gas, et cetera.
00:16:04.950 - 00:16:08.558, Speaker A: So should we walk through refract next or Lenster?
00:16:08.734 - 00:16:16.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I was really quickly going to go follow you, if that. We definitely have to get those follow numbers up.
00:16:16.412 - 00:16:50.110, Speaker A: Oh yeah, that's right. You know, what I was about to say is, oh well, David, I haven't created a profile on lens friends. I was like, I've mainly been using Lenster and then I'm like, oh yeah, that's right. We don't have to worry about that. You can follow me because that's what the decentralized social graph is. So, yeah, it's so built into our heads that it's like it's siloed the way liquidity is siloed to platforms in the traditional finance world. But here it's all shared.
00:16:50.770 - 00:17:17.880, Speaker B: Exactly. I think that's something we're going to see is that you as a creator might use a certain interface that's super optimized for creators, almost like YouTube has YouTube studio, which is where kind of creators go and manage their uploads and everything else. And then there's YouTube, the app that the rest of us use. That's kind of the consumption. I think part of the pitch for creators is almost, as you said, you've only really been using one interface, Lenster. But me as a consumer, I was able to find you on every platform and consume your content on every platform.
00:17:19.210 - 00:17:47.486, Speaker A: So cool. Yeah, it's fun when you discover that something has already been built that you've been wanting badly. And like I said with lens, I just had no idea all the progress that you guys had made. Especially too, as being a part of the Ave community, as a user and as a token holder. Cool. Okay, so do you think we've covered everything on lens friends we can jump.
00:17:47.518 - 00:18:20.550, Speaker B: Into Lenster and so Lenster, I think as I mentioned, this was built during the ETH global hackathon and they're doing nice sign in with Ethereum here. In this case, sign in with lens. And I'm now signed in right here as I'm in the wrong wallet, I think, unfortunately. So let's try this again. But I can sign in and I'm here as again, Testinprod lens and I can see, it's just like Twitter. I already followed you. I followed you actually on a different platform, but it's detected my follow NFT.
00:18:20.550 - 00:18:48.594, Speaker B: And so now when I look at my feed right now, it's just Defi dad content. But yeah, again, these are all of the publications that you have made on chain. And so I'm able to see Defi dad, you're going live talking with me. I should probably give David a follow. But as you can see, this feels very much like a Twitter style interface. I can go in and I can see everyone who's following somebody. I can go and see comments.
00:18:48.594 - 00:19:13.094, Speaker B: They may have done mirrors, which is kind of, I guess, our version of retweet. And I can do they have explore. I can see commented, I can see collected, and I can see the latest posts. Again, just going through. It's a pretty skiomorphic design of Twitter. This is entirely on chain. Every action you're seeing on here has been reflected.
00:19:13.094 - 00:19:26.020, Speaker B: And the best thing is that means that, let's say I don't like this UI or I don't like this algorithm. There's nothing stopping me from going and building my own. Going and building my own.
00:19:27.990 - 00:19:46.360, Speaker A: I was taking a screenshot there. I don't know if you can hear that. I'm posting this on Leinster myself. Right, very. I was saying it's a very meta moment, posting about Leinster while showing it off on Leinster. So cool. I love it.
00:19:46.360 - 00:20:29.506, Speaker A: I'm really confident now that we can actually see an adoption of this web3 social over the next few years. I truthfully thought this was like a decade away, and then there's all sorts of other friction to that that is worth considering. But I'm kind of reminded of that sparkle when we started using DFI more regularly in 2019, and it was like, hey, this thing works really well. There's just fewer people who know about it. Yeah, I don't know. I'm glad I just get to use it, though. The building part looks very complicated to me.
00:20:29.506 - 00:20:32.120, Speaker A: So glad that you guys can do all the hard stuff.
00:20:33.690 - 00:21:20.280, Speaker B: The building has really been great and there's an awesome team, and I want to make clear it's not just the Ave's company's team that's working on it. We did the announcement in February and I think we did four different testnets. We rewrote the contracts pretty drastically based off of dev feedback and other partner feedback. And I think one of the stats is like over 150 different devs and teams gave feedback that ended up making it into the final initial release of the contracts. And I keep saying initial release, we're already working on updates to bring in new features, updates, to bring in new modules, and to really extend what these contracts can do and to know maximize compatibility with the greater web3 ecosystem, but also really add in powerful new tools for devs to play around with.
00:21:21.290 - 00:21:51.646, Speaker A: So cool. Anything else you think is worth showing off here on Lenster? I mean, it's very familiar. The whole UI looks a lot like the parts of Twitter that are familiar to us. But even I got to say it's a little bit cleaner at the moment because I just think we're so early and there's going to be more features that come in the future. But yeah, we're kind of living in a simpler time with less people, less users on board.
00:21:51.828 - 00:22:43.342, Speaker B: Yeah. I think just to hit again this idea of here again for another, for now a third time, this is a third interface where I can edit my profile. As you can see, it's kind of already imported things that were done on other sites. But even today I can go in and set a website and it's going to reflect, again, not just on this obviously on Lenster, but it'll reflect against every other application, really kind of understanding what it means to have this kind of social graph, this kind of back end for all of these different applications. And even things just simple as posts. Like I could post right now, showing off at lens protocol and just kind of showcase, posting, posting. We don't even specify in the lens system about where the post needs to live.
00:22:43.342 - 00:23:00.600, Speaker B: Lenster chooses to do iPFs. We have other teams using AR weave. There's another team that uses ceramic. And I think that's again, the idea of flexibility for developers, flexibility for users. And again, this post is now going to show up on every single front end that chooses to index and show it.
00:23:01.290 - 00:23:10.940, Speaker A: So cool. And can you also mention again, ceramic, and there was one other one, how you're making use of those protocols because they've been very. Are we thinking as well?
00:23:11.790 - 00:23:57.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a big design principle of us is that we wanted to make things as agnostic as possible, really giving full flexibility to users and developers that want to build or use lens. And so when I make a publication, I just have a behind the scenes, it just asks for a content URI. We don't specify if that is going to be an actual URL, like pointing to somewhere with s three. It can point to IPFs as this specific post does right here. I can go to IPFs and this is literally the actual data on chain. It says right here, the description showing off my lens protocol with dfidad lens and the app ID here is lenster. But there's other applications that are using AR weave to actually store the data.
00:23:57.590 - 00:24:15.710, Speaker B: And there's another team that's using ceramic to actually store the data. And so that's the idea. Lens itself is agnostic to where your storage is. It allows for storage solutions that maybe haven't even been invented yet to be integrated into the system and giving maximum control to users and applications.
00:24:16.690 - 00:24:31.726, Speaker A: This is what a bear market is like. You just see all sorts of cool stuff being built and released. This is awesome. Anything else there, David, that we should show off with Lenster? Otherwise I'd love to highlight refract.
00:24:31.918 - 00:25:18.686, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to go to refract, and refract actually was made, I think this was made by Miguel Pierrefada, the purple hair developer, a friend of ours. And he did this, I think in about 24 hours, shortly after the actual lens lens main net release, using the API and using some other really great tools. And if you've used hacker news, this should look really familiar. And so I can post, and when I create a post, it literally just looks like a publication. And when I upvote, I am doing a mirror, I'm doing a share. And so let's say I really like this right here. I love the hitchhiker's guide to Ethereum from Delphi Digital, so I'm going to upvote it, which I did right here and again using the meta transaction method.
00:25:18.686 - 00:25:45.350, Speaker B: So everything is gasless. And if I later go back to Leinster proper for a second and I go to my profile, it's going to show that I've actually mirrored something. And this was the upvote that I did over in refract. Hacker News has showed up as a retweet of the original link over in Leinster. So that's how Leninster is interpreting these upvotes. They're saying, well, it's pretty much sharing. So we're going to make it look like a retweet of a publication.
00:25:45.350 - 00:26:11.090, Speaker B: And so there's really cool things they can do. And if you go into this specific post, I believe it's now going to show that it was posted using the application with these application IDs now, so we can even see across the entire ecosystem. Yeah, you can see that this was posted via refract, so you can even detect which application, which front end you posted.
00:26:12.390 - 00:26:39.434, Speaker A: Cool. So cool. Yeah. By the way too, that is a great read if anyone's looking to get the latest deep dive on Ethereum, so Delphi Digital is always putting out great research. Any other applications you think we should walk through? I feel like this has been a nice introduction to three major types of social apps in web. Two that we use.
00:26:39.632 - 00:27:17.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just giving a quick, very big overview. I mean, we've touched Lenster and lens friends favor, which is an actual iOS app that has a built in, really focusing creators. So definitely to check out Sapano, which is a search engine that has indexed all of lens. And so you can do really kind of in depth search iris, which is working on doing a bit more kind of like private content. So I could say I'm only going to post deFi. You could post something, maybe a review of a protocol, and it's only available to your followers or only available to certain token holders. Kind of doing privacy on top of lens itself.
00:27:17.640 - 00:27:33.134, Speaker B: Crypto, which is from our great meme creator Gabriel Hines. This is doing kind of a cameo on top of lens, and then Zilly, which is another one of these front ends, and these are just a sampling of a few. There's a ton more in the ecosystem, but definitely check here.
00:27:33.172 - 00:27:39.950, Speaker A: As the garden continues to grow, where else would we find a directory of all those apps that have been built on lens?
00:27:41.490 - 00:28:11.450, Speaker B: I would go for here right now, but there's some open source ones being created, and the idea is that you don't even necessarily need to know that this app is lens built. I think the eventual goal of the technology is to just have it be intel inside that the features that lens enables become features that we see in social networks. And it's, oh, hey, I don't even need to sign up. It's sign in with Ethereum the same way that's kind of doing accounts. It's just sign in with lens, which is using sign in with Ethereum under the hood, and it just detects your lens account and signs in with a profile.
00:28:12.190 - 00:28:31.934, Speaker A: One thing I might have misunderstood earlier is, is lens, or these different applications covering that gas on polygon, is that why we're not paying anything, or are you able to just use it because these are all like, is it meta transactions? Is that the right wording for it?
00:28:31.972 - 00:29:03.290, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll make it clear. The gasless interaction is actually that's being paid for by these applications as you're using them, right. The lens contracts have different types of gasless. The main one is metatransaction, which if you used an app powered by economy before, it's a very similar flow, right. That application has an account, they have some matic somewhere. You're signing a message and saying, hey, can you post this on my behalf to the chain? Now that does include, there's a censorship angle there, which is the app can choose not to post.
00:29:03.290 - 00:29:38.280, Speaker B: And so the contracts support posting directly yourself. That if you want something absolutely. To be posted and you don't want to take any assumptions, if you're willing to pay the gas for it to go on chain, the lens contracts will let the data hit. But I think for a lot of these applications, they believe that they're willing to pay the very small amount of matic. I think we can go into Polygon, scan directly and see for me to follow the Ravi account, it was less than a penny. It was 0.1 matic for the proxy to cover.
00:29:38.280 - 00:29:48.140, Speaker B: And currently I think totally over 150,000 transactions have been metatransacted by all these apps so far.
00:29:48.750 - 00:30:44.806, Speaker A: So eventually, as more use this, we hope, and the number of transactions increases, I guess, is there some sort of long term plan for how you would continue to scale with that many users and be able to, I guess, compensate that sort of gas? Because as you pointed out, it's a very small amount of money now. But I'm picturing, like, if we have 10,000 users, let's say right now in lens, we hopefully have hundreds of millions, if not billions. I also know, too that there's some promise, and as we move to l two s and l two s continue to develop all the ethereum l two s and polygon and so on. So yeah. Anyways, anything else you can share about how do you optimize for gas so that these applications don't go broke totally?
00:30:44.838 - 00:31:19.734, Speaker B: Well, I think the applications themselves are all doing different types of filtering and spam checking to make sure that their amounts don't get drained. And that's something I think they're building into their business models, right in the same way that I use Twitter, but I don't ever get a bill from Twitter for they have to pay to AWS or pay to another service provider. That's just kind of included in the business model. I think that's part of know they're probably going to monetize in some way, shape or form. I would hope not advertising. I probably believe it'll be some cut of monetization of content or something else. That's what we've seen some start to look at doing.
00:31:19.734 - 00:31:52.950, Speaker B: But again, I think that as scaling continues to grow, and we are very fortunate to have seen a lot of it via Polygon, via l two s like optimism and arbitrum ZKs that are coming online soon with Zksync and Sarknet. As more and more capacity comes online, I think this decision of let's have a much better user experience by metatransacting gas away. Hopefully that increased capacity matches the increased demand and we'll be able to see this really great ux. Otherwise, those have to be built into the business models of these apps.
00:31:53.130 - 00:32:05.890, Speaker A: Very interesting. Yeah, I was wondering what some of those business models were that have been discussed so far. Any other ideas or details you've heard different teams considering?
00:32:08.650 - 00:32:42.894, Speaker B: None particularly. I think there probably has been some discussions over in the discord, and I'm sure that some teams will respond and say, this is what we're looking at doing. The contracts do support all kinds of different systems. One of them is the key thing is collect. So collect is something where I can go in and let me see if I can find it. Right here I can say that a post is for sale and I can collect it and mint an NFT out of it. So right here I can go and click this button and this will let me collect Stein's post.
00:32:42.894 - 00:33:15.206, Speaker B: Now, he's chose to make this one free, but if he decided, hey, I want to monetize this post, you have to collect it. You can mint this as an NFT for five matic. Let's say a platform can specify a percentage to go to them as a platform fee, and so that could be one route of monetization. There are probably many, many more in development that I can't begin to even think of. As I said, part of what we want to do with lens is we want to give developers this nice new system and let them do the best thing they do, which is innovate and create great experiences for users.
00:33:15.318 - 00:34:19.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I have to imagine that some of these teams will eventually launch a token and then they'll follow some similar playbook, but I'm guessing learn from some of the mistakes that we've learned over the last few years with certain tokenomics that just don't work. But, yeah, I absolutely can see that as a way to bootstrap money to continue to build these decentralized, censorship resistant applications built on lens. Well, David, anything else you think we should cover that we've missed? I think this was like a really nice, concise intro to how you can get started. It's very simple here, like go to Lens XYZ, and there's all the different applications there, I will say Lenster has been really fun to use. I've only posted three times in the past week since getting onto it, but again, it's very natural as long as you have like a metamask wallet already set up.
00:34:19.652 - 00:34:27.166, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to have to really work with our friends alive here and get a version of YouTube built on lens so you can start really posting.
00:34:27.198 - 00:34:29.714, Speaker A: Oh yeah, for real?
00:34:29.832 - 00:34:30.114, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:30.152 - 00:35:13.840, Speaker A: To clarify, there isn't that sort of alternative built yet on lens, but it's coming and I know I'm excited about that. I would imagine the bankless guys, defiant, really, all of us that have professed the future of web3, but I think we're all stuck having to rely on the virality of web two. It's very sticky. So I think what you guys are building will eventually enable, call it a vampire attack on web two, for lack of a better word. But yeah. Anything else, David, that you think we should know about lens protocol and what you're all building?
00:35:14.690 - 00:35:49.066, Speaker B: No, I would say we would love for people to kind of give it a spin and give feedback. We really want to make sure that we're building this base layer for the community and for the web3 movement in general. And so definitely want to hear from everyone on what we should keep building and really can't wait to see what everyone builds on top of it. And definitely hope everyone starts claiming their lens handles and posting, dealing with self sovereign data as opposed to being controlled by Zuckerberg and Dorsey and all the others over on web two.
00:35:49.248 - 00:36:42.190, Speaker A: Yeah, well, they can get started here then at lens XYz. Reminder, you can follow there's lens protocol and David's handle here that also exist on Twitter. But I would recommend you get started on Lenster after you create a handle and then you can follow them on Lenster. And then if you enjoyed this, please subscribe@defydad.com. And I'm hoping in the future, I really do feel confident now that we're going to see this YouTube alternative, and I will be very excited to switch away from YouTube as soon as that's possible. And then one last thing, of course, if you are building a web3 social app or any sort of web3 app, please keep my team and me in mind at fourth revolution capital so you can reach out to us at Fourthrevolution Capital. But David, thanks again for your time.
00:36:42.190 - 00:37:14.470, Speaker A: Like I said, congrats on all the success you guys are having and it's very exciting and this is like prime time for you all to be building. This is what down markets are for. Sort of helps us to refocus on the fundamentals and get away from all the froth. And this is a whole movement that probably will become the norm in whatever next cycle. And we'll look back and, wow, like just a few years ago, none of this even existed.
00:37:15.930 - 00:37:17.880, Speaker B: Well, yeah, thanks for having me.
00:37:19.530 - 00:37:26.438, Speaker A: Awesome. All right. And thanks, everyone. I'm going to go and end the broadcast here. We'll be in a green room in a second, David. So thanks, everyone. Have a great day.
00:37:26.438 - 00:37:26.690, Speaker A: Bye.
