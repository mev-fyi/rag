00:00:03.510 - 00:00:41.910, Speaker A: Hi everyone. You're watching DeFi talks with Defi dad. Hey everyone, thanks for joining us. It's Wednesday, January 26, 2022. We've got another really interesting interview for you today. We're going to be talking with the co founders of Syndicate. Syndicate is a protocol that lives on Ethereum.
00:00:41.910 - 00:01:18.702, Speaker A: I hate to just call it a DFI protocol because I think it's so radical in what they're building. And just to describe it in a nutshell, it allows you to create investment clubs on chain. So all of this is built for like a web3 native fund to be created. Or let's say you're in a discord with a bunch of friends and you actually want to invest together. That's how this works. And I'm going to let the team talk more about how it works, how to get started. Quick reminder before we do get started, this isn't investment advice.
00:01:18.702 - 00:01:29.640, Speaker A: This is not an endorsement or recommendation for you to create an investment club. This is purely for informational purposes only. On that note, Ian will, thanks for joining me. How are you guys doing?
00:01:30.490 - 00:01:32.680, Speaker B: Yeah, doing great. Thanks for having us.
00:01:33.130 - 00:01:35.238, Speaker C: Absolutely awesome to be here.
00:01:35.404 - 00:01:45.340, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, congrats on getting this product launched because I think what, you've been building it for about a year now probably.
00:01:46.350 - 00:02:03.840, Speaker C: Yeah, we started the company a year ago, but we started prototyping it over the summer of 2020 and we started brainstorming syndicate four years ago, so it's many years in the making and we're so excited with the launch we just had.
00:02:04.950 - 00:03:28.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I think part of the arc of your journey that's funny for me to think back on is when I first heard about this from you. I don't think I fully appreciated what you were building. I guess part of my journey in this space has been realizing how challenging it is to bring capital together, to coordinate and to do things with that money, which we've all become more accustomed to now with DAos. So even when you were building this, we were seeing big defi protocols flourishing and early NFT projects, but now we're really starting to see the network effects of that growth, where just there's so much experimentation going on that you no longer can keep track of all the names of those different projects and different dows that are forming. And so it's just. Yeah, the timing of all of this is, I would say you couldn't have timed it any better with it being January 2022, except for the market, which we won't talk about today. So, guys, maybe we should start with your background, just because you both have been long term builders in the crypto space, so maybe you could both walk us through all the cool stuff you've worked on.
00:03:32.530 - 00:04:45.650, Speaker B: Yeah, so my background is I've been in the crypto space professionally full time for eight years. Got into it, actually, when I was at Citigroup's venture arm called City Ventures in 2014, where I first learned about bitcoin and became so enamored by this potential of basically an open tech stack. That's how I saw it back then, and the implications of it became so enamored that I ended up leading all of the crypto and blockchain activity at Citigroup globally for three years. During that time, I met a team at Ideo that was starting a crypto division. So I helped them start that and joined it full time in 2018, which is where I met will initially, which he'll talk about in a second, actually started and spun out a crypto investment firm from Ido, where I was co managing partner for four years. And then late, or I guess in early 2020, Will and I resuscitated this idea that we started working on four years ago, which ultimately became syndicate. And will will talk about that as he introduces himself.
00:04:48.150 - 00:04:50.034, Speaker C: Absolutely awesome.
00:04:50.152 - 00:05:10.698, Speaker A: Yeah. Will, kind of walk us through all the cool stuff you've worked on, especially, I don't actually know the full story of this, but you worked on something related to loot, even in the meantime. And this is while you were building syndicate. So anyways, yeah. What's your background? How long have you been in the crypto space?
00:05:10.864 - 00:05:56.838, Speaker C: Yeah, so I started out in the decentralization space in 2013. I was actually working on mesh networking technologies one summer, and during that point, I was also introduced to bitcoin, and I started doing side projects on the bitcoin blockchain, things like verifying, for example, that files are authentic. And also I was trying to set up my own token just because it was one to do that. Back in the day, I saw how difficult that process was back when people were trying to launch their own tokens on bitcoin. You had to fork the network, find your own miners. It was just like secure your own network via proof of work. And then Ethereum was announced and I saw the original white paper for it, and I realized, wow, this makes it so much easier to launch your own token.
00:05:56.838 - 00:06:54.480, Speaker C: I took the $10 I'd gotten for free as a sign up bonus from Coinbase and put that in the Ethereum presale. If I'd put $100 in, I could have bought a house. But hindsight is 2020, and I've been closely tracking Ethereum and involved with the space ever since. In addition to syndicate, which Ian and I came up with when we were both doing both at Ido, I was doing R and d there related to crypto and a few other r d topics. I also created Adventure Gold, which is an in game currency for the loot ecosystem. And I was also on the core team of Constitution Dao, where I helped Sotheby's get the Constitution Dao through Sotheby's compliance process. So, yeah, very passionate about the DAO space, and I love to be involved both with syndicate and with the other projects I'm involved in.
00:06:55.250 - 00:07:38.826, Speaker A: So I'm thinking we could go about this a few ways to kind of set up for what syndicate is solving for. One is maybe either of you could walk me through. You've got a great medium post out there that talks about these investment clubs, and you've got some nice old black and white photos. And it was interesting because it's some history I kind of knew about but didn't fully understand. There's that. But then there's also just like your background, working with funds, working in funds and kind of knowing how the venture capital model works. Because I feel like that is what you're disrupting here.
00:07:38.826 - 00:08:02.580, Speaker A: In a way. I've been very excited about the idea that in the future, anyone without any sort of worry, of course, about regulation, anyone could rightfully go on chain and create a fund. So maybe you could walk us through that history and some of the challenges to running a fund.
00:08:03.990 - 00:09:08.902, Speaker B: Yeah. This comes to a lot of the research that will and I started back in 2018, which is we have been wondering, why is it that the technologies that are being built and developed and shared with the world, that the capital model and the investing model to invest in those network technologies are not also more network native? Which just seems like very incongruent. Right. And so it reasons that investing in Web three will be more network native, will be more community driven in the future. And part of what has been, I think, holding that back both in Web three, but even especially generally in Web two, or in the world more broadly, frankly, is that the infrastructure and the tools to do so have not been created yet. And that is a big part of what we are doing here when you think about the implications, right. Investing builds the world.
00:09:08.902 - 00:10:01.414, Speaker B: It shapes the world that we all live in by allocating resources to builders to build that world. And if we don't have more communities involved in that process, then we get a certain type of world, not for necessarily everyone, and that's, in our opinion, not sustainable. It's not the right thing. And so syndicate is on a mission to radically kind of democratize the capabilities and tools to invest that previously were either really difficult to use, really difficult to access, or really expensive, and making those tools as available as possible to communities and people so that they too can do things that only a certain few number of people can do today or traditionally.
00:10:01.462 - 00:10:02.058, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:02.224 - 00:11:34.998, Speaker B: And the other thing though, as it relates to investing and the tools that we are building, right, is we don't want people to worry about, I don't know, breaking rules, compliance, the law. Obviously, the world is so complex, there's so many different jurisdictions, so many unique circumstances, that ultimately these communities and these users need to follow their own counsel and ensure that they're running whatever they do, whether it's with syndicate or even off of syndicate. Frankly, in the real world, like doing it compliantly, but where we can, we think that the right thing to do is to build tools and embed these certain tools into our products like Syndicate, or tools like syndicate, so that they can more easily maintain compliance and be guided to use these technologies in the right way. So that comes to the first product that we launched on Syndicate protocol yesterday, which is web3 investment clubs. And what we've done is we basically modernized the investment club for Web three. So what is an investment club? Investment club, as you saw in the post on Mirror, is that investment clubs have been around for thousands of years, like literally before the Internet, before Web three. It is basically just a group of people that are coming together to invest in something.
00:11:34.998 - 00:13:01.506, Speaker B: The first investment club in recorded history was in 1898 in the Wild west in Texas. I don't know what that investment club did, but maybe it like, I don't know, invested in some horses or made a saloon or something. Who knows what that thing is? But the point is that the investment club model has existed for thousands of years. It has formally existed as an investing model for hundreds of years. And the SEC, even on their website, has a webpage specific to investment clubs, which basically says that if you follow these guidelines here in the US, then it is technically an investment club. And also that the SEC doesn't regulate it because it's not a security and it's not something that is problematic or needs regulation or regulation from them. And so what we've done is we've taken that model and turned that into a tool on web3 as a dow, right? And what that means is the investment club model, which has traditionally been people in local towns and communities that will go to a restaurant or they'll go to their community center, they'll meet up on a Tuesday evening and kind of talk about stock picks and stuff like that to learn together and to win together.
00:13:01.506 - 00:13:02.130, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:02.200 - 00:13:02.674, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:02.792 - 00:13:29.660, Speaker B: It is not native to the Internet, and it is not native to these new assets that are native to the Internet, like in Web three. And so we've basically taken that and then turned that into a dow tool for Web three to be able to natively run an investment club on Web three, on the Internet, on Ethereum at least. Ethereum only for now and then to invest in these assets natively in Web three.
00:13:30.430 - 00:14:56.230, Speaker A: I think one of the real values that you're delivering with this that just stood out for me, that I've experienced firsthand, and we have lots of friends who can speak to this, is just that there's already been an incredible wealth creation event on chain, and that's only been accelerated over the last few years. And so it's always been, I mean, I guess, sticking to whether it's an investment club or whether we see actual investment funds come together that look and feel like the legacy investment funds of today. It's always felt wild to me that depending on where you live in the world, that you would cash that out and put it into a fiat and then get like a bank account, and then you're using all this old sort of infrastructure when what you've invested in, what's helped many people to earn whatever wealth they've earned has been through using these web3 tools. To me, you're knocking out a lot of the busy work, and you're creating a shorter distance between where people are and where they want to be with, in this case, creating, let's call it an investment club.
00:14:57.210 - 00:15:40.740, Speaker B: Yeah. And also we recognize that many of these clubs, they want to have compliance. Right? And so we offer them those tools. Like we teamed up with Latham walk ins on Dao legal documents, which you can auto generate and sign in the app natively. We also partnered with this fintech called Doula, where investment clubs on syndicate, they can get a legal entity, they can get an EIN, they can get a bank account, they can file taxes, they can make state compliance filings on an annual basis, and Doula will just take care of all of that for, you know, we want to make those tools available to people if they want it, and we do find that a lot of people want it.
00:15:41.670 - 00:16:06.170, Speaker A: Actually, could, would either of you be comfortable starting to share screen because a lot of what you're sharing, of course, I'm excited to be able to follow it, but I will say once you see it in the DAP or once you start to see what it looks like on screen, it's really easy to follow the story. Awesome. And then Ian, can I share your screen? I can see it here. I just want to make sure.
00:16:06.240 - 00:16:07.694, Speaker B: Ok. Yep, sounds good.
00:16:07.732 - 00:16:13.760, Speaker A: All right. Yeah. Either of you feel free to kind of walk us through what we're looking at here and how this works.
00:16:14.290 - 00:16:18.100, Speaker B: Will, do you want to talk? And then I'll just kind of be your hands.
00:16:18.710 - 00:16:50.566, Speaker C: Sounds good. Yeah. So one thing that we care a lot about is helping people get a sense of how the investment club product works. So we tried to make it as simple as possible. It's really only three steps. You create an investment club which takes under a minute. You then send a deposit link to your friends or the Dow community that you're working with and they can deposit incredibly easily.
00:16:50.566 - 00:17:31.030, Speaker C: And then from there all you do is you can then manage and invest the funds from there as a community. So we have this demo mode that you can see where this gives you a sense of what it looks like after a club is set up. In this case, this is an example club with mock data, but this looks extremely similar to the real clubs that we have set up. So you can see that we provide a full transparency into the DAO. So you can see what tokens the Dow is holding. For example, you can see off chain investments as well. These Daos don't have to invest in only tokens and NFTs.
00:17:31.030 - 00:18:24.060, Speaker C: They can also invest in off chain assets, whether that's startup equity, real estate, collectibles. And a lot of this is based on our experience helping Citidao and Constitution Dao with compliance and legal formation. And then of course, we would never be complete if we didn't show people's NFTs. We show a full visualization of the NFTs in their wallet and that allows people to get a full sense of what a club is holding, what's coming next. Beyond this is a ton of features related to community. We know that investing is only one side of the Dow equation, but community is the other side. So we already have a membership NFT product that's in private beta that has over 38,000 of these membership nfts in the wild already.
00:18:24.060 - 00:18:53.700, Speaker C: And that will help with community building as well. So what you see here is the investing side, but will help dowse a ton with community management racing as well. So you can also take a look at the creation flow. Let's show people that as well, just to show how easy it is. So if you want to create a syndicate, you can do this alongside us right now. App syndicate IO club create that's hard to type in. Just go to syndicate IO and find the link there.
00:18:53.700 - 00:19:22.138, Speaker C: But yeah, you just give a name for the club. In this case, it's DfI Daddao. Fantastic. And a token symbol which represents the ERC 20 token, that is club shares. And then from there you can just define how much you're raising. So right now it supports USDC ETH support will be released very soon. Supports for any ERC 20 token is also coming up.
00:19:22.138 - 00:20:00.294, Speaker C: So this will expand very quickly into multiple options. And then from there you just state how long you're going to fundraise for. You can even set a custom period as well if you don't want to use the preset dates and you specify how many people can join. Note that for investment clubs, they can have up to 99 members. The community product allows many more people, but the investment club product itself is 99 for compliance reasons. We want to make compliance very easy so that it's easier for people to follow it. And then you're just standard disclaimers and you can create it.
00:20:00.294 - 00:20:11.546, Speaker C: Usually it's around one hundred dollars to two hundred and fifty dollars in gas. Once you create it, you are good to go. And then your club is live and entirely set up.
00:20:11.568 - 00:20:14.022, Speaker A: Cool process.
00:20:14.096 - 00:20:16.350, Speaker C: It's like a minute. It's incredible.
00:20:19.170 - 00:20:29.090, Speaker A: I don't think I missed this at all. There's no fiat on ramp yet, right? If someone wanted to use one of the common crypto fiat on ramps.
00:20:31.750 - 00:20:32.078, Speaker C: Let'S.
00:20:32.094 - 00:20:45.570, Speaker A: Say it's like a friend who is more new to web3 and they want to create an investment club with someone else, they're going to have to go through an exchange or something. There's no integration there yet for crypto fiat.
00:20:45.730 - 00:21:10.560, Speaker C: Correct. We're talking with a number of fiat on ramps and offramps. The hard part about it is that you do need a wallet that can receive the tokens. So users do need their own wallet that's compatible with smart contracts anyway. So the easiest approach is definitely to get USDC on any exchange and then send that to your wallet. One way to eat deposit. You can use that as well.
00:21:10.560 - 00:21:19.060, Speaker C: But yeah, there's no fiat on ramp and offer at the moment. It's definitely something we're looking at. But since users still need a wallet to manage their tokens, that'll come.
00:21:20.230 - 00:22:13.810, Speaker A: You've opened up a world of possibilities here, just with the on chain payments there. Another question I had was, I don't know if you'll be able to answer this for me or not. I've definitely met a lot of friends who have said, my mom and dad, I took some money from them and I put it into ether or something. They put it into some crypto investment. I guess I'm asking is that, like within compliance, like that someone could create an investment club with friends, family, whatever. I don't understand the fine line, and maybe this is something I'll just have to do more research on. I don't understand the fine line between what is an investment club versus what would be like a fund that is actually regulated.
00:22:14.790 - 00:23:05.518, Speaker C: Great question. Yeah. One thing we do is a lot of people, we know a lot of people invest with their friends, and we help make this a more formalized process. So instead of just sending money to a wallet and just hoping that everyone's on the same page, it allows everyone to join the Dow together and to take something that was previously very informal and very lax and help make it a much easier process that enables everyone to benefit from the Dow tooling that syndicate has built. Essentially, the difference between an investment club and a fund comes down to active participation in an investment club. Every member must actively participate in a fund. They can just put money in and be a passive user and never take part in any investment decisions.
00:23:05.518 - 00:23:34.382, Speaker C: The benefit of investment clubs is that you don't need to be accredited, so you can take money from anyone. You know, there's no restrictions on accredited investors. One other factor for people who want to take fees tied to performance, that is something that you would need a fund for. But managers can compensate themselves. They just can'tie it to performance. Also, add some additional piece on this.
00:23:34.436 - 00:24:07.560, Speaker B: Yeah, and it is complicated and confusing. And so what we do is a number of things. First of all, everyone should check with a lawyer and their own counsel. That's the most important thing, because to be honest, a lot of these regulations, depending on who you're talking to, because web3 is truly global. It just varies depending on where they are and what their exact situation is, at least with respect to the US. It's those things that will mentioned. There's a number of other things, too.
00:24:07.560 - 00:24:55.574, Speaker B: Like, for example, no public solicitation. You should be raising it private, doing this club privately with people that you know well. So don't tweet out investment clubs and stuff like that. If you're raising securities regulations and we provide all those warnings in the application, in the tool. We also have this really extensive get book which references to the SEC website and stuff like that, which outlines all of these different things that people should consider and follow when considering starting an investment club. So all of that is available on our website. Highly encourage people to read through that.
00:24:55.574 - 00:25:01.260, Speaker B: And also just check with people to make sure that you're not doing anything that you shouldn't be.
00:25:01.710 - 00:25:44.790, Speaker A: Now, once the funds are deposited into your syndicate wallet, is that then a multi SiG that is being used? Let's pretend that to give an example, because some people don't know what a multi sig is. If you deposited, let's say $10,000 amongst some friends, and then you just said, hey, we're going to take this USDC and buy some ether. We'll use something like uniswap in order to transact and do that. Is someone able to control all of that as like a single signer, or does it require everyone to participate or a select few? Or can you customize it to your liking?
00:25:48.090 - 00:26:50.602, Speaker B: Will may want to jump in with respect to the technical aspects, but we're fairly agnostic in terms of how investment clubs in this particular case want to run themselves, right? I mean, syndicate is built on top of existing web3 infrastructure and wallet infrastructure. So if you or a group wants to use not a multi SIg and you're comfortable with that, that is possible. So you can connect metamask, Ledger, whatever. A lot of groups do want that added sort of protection and just like OpSec sort of maturity, if you will. And so a lot of them use nos, for example, which is great. And so people can run a syndicate dow as an investment club on top of a gnosis wallet, multisig. But as far as how governance and stuff happens, we find that a lot of these clubs, they don't want the full on chain governance kind of tool stuff.
00:26:50.602 - 00:27:22.262, Speaker B: They typically just do it in group chats because these are like friends, or they're like people that collect NFTs together and they already have a group chat for that. They may be like angel investors that have been investing for many years together. And so we don't want to force them into kind of a specific experience that isn't easy and comfortable for them. So they can use whatever tool they'd like in that way.
00:27:22.396 - 00:28:24.730, Speaker A: That's cool. So when you're setting up a syndicate, and again, I almost did this last night, and then I got a little bit nervous just because I hadn't asked a lawyer any questions or a few other questions I wanted to ask you guys about. It sounds like I can just plug in whatever wallet address, which for anyone that's set up a wallet, if you want to set up a multi sig through like a gnosis safe, that's up to you. But you also could have a single signer as someone who uses like a metamask generated wallet. And then I always encourage everyone to use hardware wallets or gnosis. You want multiple affirmations to say that you want to transact versus just like a single metamask signature. But am I understanding that correctly? You can basically put in whatever wallet address you want for the syndicate wallet.
00:28:26.430 - 00:29:09.446, Speaker C: So yeah, you can choose the wallet that meets your needs, which is great. We care a lot about letting users doing that. If you're making a $5 million investment into a startup, you probably want to use a nessus multisig with a number of signers because you don't need to be very nimble. You have a wild to wire the money, to send the money via USDC. But if you're investing in new NFT mints, you probably want to use something more nimble, like a hardware wallet, so that you can get into these deals very quickly. We're definitely thinking a lot about how to improve that experience, but right now, allowing people to pick the wallet type that works best for them is something that's really important to us.
00:29:09.628 - 00:30:10.422, Speaker A: Yeah. Trying to think of any other integrations to call out here that you're already working on or tools that would be complementary to this. I know I'd love to be able to get alerts at my wallet through the Ethereum push notification service eventually just to know I'm thinking about what happens if a deposit hits, or what happens, of course, if someone transacts as like a web3 native user, you definitely want to be aware if there's transactions that are happening in the investment club wallet. Gosh, guys, I guess unless there's any other tooling that you would say is complimentary to learn about there. What else do we need to know about syndicate? It's live, it's new. Anyone can access this, just like you could access any other decentralized app if you're brave enough to click and connect your wallet. But yeah, what else do we need to know to get involved?
00:30:10.566 - 00:30:50.290, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the key thing is one know how easy it is. Set up a syndicate in up to a minute. If you're thinking about trying it, go try it. It's so easy and we have so many cool features coming up that you'll be really glad that you tried it out right now. In addition to that, we have our discord linked to on the homepage of our website, so that's the best way to get involved. Any feedback you have on new features, we love to hear it and that helps a lot with determining what we do next. Also, so many people are already giving out intros and collaborating on investment club ideas.
00:30:50.290 - 00:31:10.240, Speaker C: So if you want a community to set up investment clubs with, the discord is great for that as well. And keep an eye on our Twitter. We're going to have a lot of upcoming cool features, so definitely keep a close eye on that because that's where a lot of the news will be published first.
00:31:10.610 - 00:31:38.742, Speaker A: Awesome. And by the way, one thing we didn't talk as much about here is there have been a number of private beta testers over the past several months. Any resources you'd recommend to read about their experience or how they've used it? I want to say Delphi Digital did like an NFT fund with G Money and I can't remember there's a few other funds you guys worked with.
00:31:38.876 - 00:32:26.870, Speaker C: Yeah, so a good list of our customers is on the homepage of the website. We have a scrolling list of tweets from people we work with and that includes lots of feedback from various people we've helped out. The most common use cases are group token and NFT investing. That's what we see a lot of. So that's very common. Also, we see people making investments into startups and then some working on real estate and collectibles, like the compliance help we provided to constitution down and city down. So I'd say group buying NFTs and tokens, investing together with your friends, doing due diligence with your friends.
00:32:26.870 - 00:32:42.490, Speaker C: That's probably 80% of the syndicates, and then the other 20% is real world assets, so to speak. Startup equity, real estate, collectibles, things along those lines. And yeah, it works really well for both these cases.
00:32:44.750 - 00:33:52.420, Speaker B: In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing some of these stories in a little bit more depth, effectively, like case studies highlighting some of these different communities that we've been working with. There's just some amazing groups like mission oriented sort of investing clubs that are trying to, for example, invest in more women in the web3 space, or invest in more musicians or creators in the NFT space or whatever, right? And so we'll be sharing some of those stories. Also our discord, we're going to start hosting town halls or little fireside chats with different people. Externally, actually the syndicate, like some of our users and partners and things like that, where people can come learn and engage with them directly to ask questions about like, oh, how did you do this? Or I'm thinking about doing something similar. Could you help me? Obviously this is still pretty early, but we're investing in growing those platforms out in the weeks and months ahead.
00:33:54.070 - 00:34:34.954, Speaker A: It's wild. It's such a cool idea and I just love the fact that you're enabling anyone to just be able to do more with their money to do whatever they want. Also behind Ian, you can see it says like, invest together, win together. Just reminded everyone to, obviously you be the judge of how you go about using syndicate. Just because you start an investment club doesn't mean that everything's going to go perfectly. So just be mindful of that. I think be mindful of the relationships you form if you choose to create a syndicate.
00:34:34.954 - 00:35:22.160, Speaker A: But that goes beyond, I think, the mission of syndicate. This is about creating an open source tool that anyone can use and permissionlessly access. So guys, anything else you wanted to share before we go? Just thanks so much for your time. It's wild. I really want to put into context for everyone. When you talk with founders like this, like twelve months ago, about what they're building, it really is difficult to visualize and understand what that's going to look like in the end. And this is one tool that I love the mission behind it, but I can't believe in the end what this product actually looks like and how easy it is to use.
00:35:22.160 - 00:35:36.258, Speaker A: Just really cool. This is like pushing the frontiers of what you should be able to do with DFI and web3. Anyways, just proud to be associated with what you're working on here.
00:35:36.424 - 00:36:17.970, Speaker C: Thank you. And yeah, we're so excited about the future. I mean, community based investing is something that we know is going to be huge and it's not done as often as it could be because it's hard. There's no reason why these structures can't be done more. It's just difficult in the traditional world. But by making this incredibly easy in the web3 world, we hope that we disrupt venture capital in the same way that YouTube disrupted the traditional film and media industries where we know that these investment clubs are going to expand the pool of investors really dramatically. It's going to lead to so many more creators, so many more people who are involved in the ecosystem.
00:36:17.970 - 00:36:37.800, Speaker C: And like YouTube, no one can really predict how this will evolve. Every single person who uses syndicate is helping pioneer the future. And we're so excited for how Dazz will change this to make investing more accessible and more transparent and more fair.
00:36:38.890 - 00:36:42.460, Speaker A: Absolutely, guys, anything else before we go?
00:36:43.550 - 00:37:12.340, Speaker B: No. Thanks for having us and allowing us to connect with your community. We'd love for you and these communities to help us build this together with us, because we can't do it alone and we're going to be here for a really long time and we're going to need lots of help along the way to create the impact that we're trying to create here. So thanks again for your time.
00:37:12.950 - 00:37:47.898, Speaker A: Quick reminder to everyone too. There is no syndicate token, so it's January 26, 2022. Just always want to warn you, when these new projects launch, there's a lot of scammers out there. So if you see anyone talking about a token for syndicate that is not real. So just be wary of that. So anyways, yeah, thanks everyone for joining us. If you enjoyed this and you'd like to learn more about dFi NFTs web3, you can subscribe@dfidad.com
