00:00:00.490 - 00:00:32.950, Speaker A: Yeah. So first thing I would say is I love math and I love finance, and this protocol is the direct opportunity where I can use both of them. Instadapp has been deeply involved in all the protocols. This protocol is an opportunity for us to build those new utilities, make the overall DeFi better. And we were trying to build this protocol with the vision of ever expanding protocol, which serves as a future financial layer.
00:00:35.530 - 00:01:18.966, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad, here with my co host nomadic from Fourth Revolution Capital. In this episode, we'll dive into what we believe is one of the most promising zero to one innovations in DeFi in years. In their newest blog post today, the Instadap core team unveil fluid, which they boldly claim is the most advanced, most secure, most flexible, and most efficient protocol in DFI. Lending fluid is a DFI dream, offering the highest loan to value ratio in DFI, meaning you can borrow up to 95% against ETH. The first instance we know of in DFI, where you can earn with not only collateral but also debt, known as smart collateral and smart debt. The lowest liquidation penalties as low as 0.1%
00:01:18.966 - 00:02:06.930, Speaker B: the lowest liquidation gas three to four times less than most protocols, better rates for lenders and borrowers, and the highest security standards by isolating risk and automated limits. Although fluid is slated to release in the coming months, we will give you a rare look at all you need to know about this new protocol that combines familiar elements of a lending protocol, a vault protocol, and a Dex protocol.

00:03:04.360 - 00:03:23.374, Speaker B: Alright, so today we'll get right into the interview because Sam needs no introduction. Samiak Jane is the co founder of Instadap and he has joined us previously to talk about instadap's avocado wallet. So let's kick it off. Sam welcome back to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:23.492 - 00:03:33.482, Speaker A: Hey, I'm doing good. Glad to be back in on this podcast. Excited to explore fluid and yeah, what the future looks like for instadap.
00:03:33.546 - 00:04:21.198, Speaker B: It would be an understatement to say that we are excited to talk with you about this, and we are pre recording this so that this will have gone out after you've announced this blog post, which is going to tell folks all about fluid. And so fluid is this fundamentally new layer that combines some of our favorite aspects of a lending protocol, a vault protocol like vault Volt and a Dex protocol. This is a protocol that sits within the Instadap family, and you've been developing this in stealth for, I guess, one and a half years. And that's a very long time in Defi. So I guess what can you tell us about what prompted you all to start building this?
00:04:21.364 - 00:05:26.702, Speaker A: Yeah, so first thing I would say is, I love math and I love finance, and this protocol is the direct opportunity where I can use both of them. Instadap has been deeply involved in all the protocols. Actually, what prompted me that I personally need to start a D five protocol is uniswap e three the innovation. And before that, I was sort of bearish on AML. But then just that Unisor V three announcement changed my entire mindset and made me believe what you can do with just math and you can improve the finance so much better. And it's not been possible in traditional finance, because even if you're good at math or finance, you still need a lot of regulatory approval to do anything in stock market or in any of the financial market, or you need to be really old before you're able to reach to that point. So, yeah, that was the main point.
00:05:26.702 - 00:06:01.850, Speaker A: And I, being a super heavy user of Defi, we have posted a lot of strategies throughout the time. We have done a lot of innovations. Some of the innovations, we were not able to do it, but we still proposed the ideas of it. But yeah, this protocol is an opportunity for us to build those new utilities, make the overall defi better, and we're trying to build this protocol with the vision know, ever expanding protocol, which serves as a future financial layer.
00:06:02.010 - 00:06:19.400, Speaker C: Sam, let's dive into fluid. I guess maybe at like a high level first. We've kind of teased it a little bit in the opening, and Defi dad explained a bit about it, but yeah, maybe give us kind of like the abridged high level version, and then we'll kind of get into it more in depth kind of piece. By.
00:06:21.370 - 00:07:40.746, Speaker A: I mean, fluid is sort of a natural evolution of what we're doing in DeFi. We are basically trying to solve all the major problems that we faced as the overall ecosystem and also as a user and developer. So we have designed the overall fluid protocol such that it's upgradable, the capital efficient, and there are just a lot more features. So the base layer of fluid is what we call as liquidity layer, which makes it super simple where all the liquidity from all the protocols comes. And sort of, it's like a central hub for liquidity. And protocols can be built on top of this liquidity layer. This liquidity layer is sort of a very super simple smart contract, which gives allowance to protocol for deposit, borrow on some basic activities, looks after the security for the protocols through automated limits and protocol classes, and, yeah, allows the liquidity to be highly capital efficient by removing the segregation, which generally a lot of the protocols faces.
00:07:40.746 - 00:08:28.814, Speaker A: Right now, this is not more of a user end problem, but if you see on a global DeFi level problem, there are many versions of a particular protocol, and each version has a very huge amount of capital and the movement of capital. Even though DeFi is very open for users, it has a lot of friction because the lenders and borrowers will have to move together. So it allows the innovation to happen. Fluid allows the real innovation to happen, and also just with the minimum movement of users and not kickstart a new protocol from. Yeah, I mean, that's like a generic overview of fluid. Yeah.
00:08:28.852 - 00:09:12.030, Speaker C: So if I'm kind of like picking that up correctly, Sam, it sounds like one of the things you're solving for is that liquidity fragmentation problem. So if, like ave v two or some other protocol, for example, launches a v three, then all that liquidity has to migrate and move over to the new protocol. I think we've seen this too with, I guess, Gmx recently with their new V two. So what this, I guess, does is since that liquidity layer sits at that base layer and all these protocols tap into it. If a new version of a protocol happens, we don't need to move liquidity. Liquidity stays where it is, which I think, yeah, for an end user is highly efficient.
00:09:12.610 - 00:09:49.346, Speaker A: Yeah. So if I explain it more clearly. So let's say there was ave v two, there was our v three. Now our V three is surely much better than our V two and much secure. It provides a lot of new utilities for borrowers, but not any new things for lenders other than getting better rates. So what fluid in this same scenario, what will happen in fluid is there is no new upgrade for lenders. So lenders are just still supplying from lending protocol, they're earning from their assets through lending protocol.
00:09:49.346 - 00:10:36.114, Speaker A: And we deployed a new vault or new borrowing protocol. So just the borrowers will have to migrate and they can start migrating instantly because the liquidity or the base layer has not changed. So there won't be any borrow rate spike or anything. But as borrowers tend to move to a newer protocol, lenders will start to get better rates. So it kind of removes a lot of friction that lenders and borrowers moving together in a balanced way, then just borrowers can instantly start moving and lenders, without having to move, starts to get better rates. So in a bigger billions of TVLs, if you look, this helps a lot because currently still, like I think ave v three is about a year old and still ave v two on Ethereum has higher TVL.
00:10:36.242 - 00:11:10.414, Speaker B: Okay, so for folks listening, this is a very foundational element of this protocol. You're probably wondering where we're going to take this. This is again the liquidity layer. We're going to talk very soon about the lending protocol itself. We're going to talk about how that plays into borrowers with the vault protocol. I don't know why I keep mispronouncing vault. And then there's also a dex protocol in this because ultimately traders are liquidators.
00:11:10.414 - 00:11:49.454, Speaker B: So if you're wondering where we're going with this, just know there's almost like four parts to this. So this is the very first part of this as we continue here with the liquidity layer, I think another important bit of information for us as users are the security features built into the liquidity layer. There's this thing mentioned in the blog post that is referred to as automated limits. Can you talk about what those are like, what function do they serve? And then maybe how do those compare with what we know as like the debt ceiling with maker or what we call isolation mode in ave v three.
00:11:49.572 - 00:12:33.790, Speaker A: Yeah. Liquidity layer has a huge focus on simplicity and security because that's the place where all the assets remains and making sure doesn't matter. The protocols built on top of it can be as complex as possible, but liquidity layer will make sure that those assets are secure because due to its simplicity and security restrictions. So the automated limits. We have taken some inspiration from Makerdao and other protocols like compound. V three has supply limits, V three has isolation mode, et cetera. So how we have designed it is to keep it as frictionless.
00:12:33.790 - 00:13:12.300, Speaker A: We have designed automated limits which restricts the borrowing and withdrawals. So for a particular protocol we can set, like the borrowing limits are 10% in 24 hours. So as the borrowing limit starts to reach, it starts to go to a higher point with a specific rate. So it's like 10% in 24 hours. So basically 0.5% something per hour. So users, the organic users, can still able to borrow seamlessly and the ceiling will keep on going up.
00:13:12.300 - 00:14:00.982, Speaker A: But if any whale movement or any kind of risky thing happens, the protocol will restrict it. Either it's on borrowing side or on the withdrawal side. Withdrawal can also be set accordingly, like 10% or 20% withdrawals in 24 hours. So not all the users will be. So what happens? We have seen in the Euler hack, in just a single transaction, 200 million wiped. No one was expecting that, and it was a huge drama. And it has happened a lot of times with different protocols, but in this case, even if by mistake, those kind of things come into play through new protocols or anything, the limit will be like 10% of whatever that protocol has supplied.
00:14:00.982 - 00:14:33.140, Speaker A: So in case of Euler scenario, it would have been just 20 million rather than 200 million. So it just allows users to be a lot safe. And currently I don't see any protocol has those limits, although I expect them as we go in future to add more and more things. One more thing that we have added on the security side is protocol class. So the protocol class is. There are two classes, zero one. The protocol class zero is basically the guardian can pause the protocol at any time.
00:14:33.140 - 00:15:08.174, Speaker A: All the new protocols added to the liquidity layer will be added as zero class. And after the time, let's say six months or one year, and the protocol has proven itself, then the protocol will be migrated to class one, which guardians cannot pause. So it will make sure that users are truly, there is no restriction other than governance, not even team multisig to pause them once the protocol has proved itself. So these are all the things we have added on liquidity layer to make sure users are as secure as possible.
00:15:08.292 - 00:15:25.566, Speaker C: Sam, quick question before we get into the protocols that the Instadap team is building on top of the liquidity layer, is it possible for just any other protocols that maybe aren't being developed by the Instadap team to tap into that liquidity layer?
00:15:25.678 - 00:16:02.718, Speaker A: So initially on launch, it will be purely from the team. Team will build all the new protocols. Although in future we would want to make it open and let other people contribute. But before doing that, we will make sure that we have some good auditing firms to audit the new protocols and some proper need to create a proper guidelines around that. But yes, we will surely have it in future. Maybe when fluid touches. $1 billion would be a good way to kick start that program.
00:16:02.718 - 00:16:16.998, Speaker A: And it will also allow a new protocol to have easy growth with this massive liquidity. If you're good at innovating algorithms and other things, you can just focus on code and fluid can help you grow.
00:16:17.164 - 00:16:34.326, Speaker C: Sam, let's get into, I guess the first protocol you're building on top of the liquidity layer, and that is your lending protocol. Maybe just describe at a high level kind of what this lending protocol is, how it integrates with the liquidity layer.
00:16:34.438 - 00:17:37.642, Speaker A: Yeah, so lending protocol is a super simple protocol. It's just focused for users to lend, and lending market is three x bigger than the borrowers market. So we just focused a lot on the simplicity for the users and gas optimization. So lending protocol, what it does is it provides a similar UI, sort of like instead of light, where user just deposits one token and they just get the interest, they get an ERC 4626 token representation for interest yielding interest bearing token. What exciting is lending protocol is not upgradable and users can rely on it long term. So basically, if any developer wants to use ERC 4626, they can rely on it long term, they can integrate in their protocol or anything. As most of the innovation happens on borrowing side and as those innovation happens on fluid, lenders will start to get better apr without having to move or upgrade.
00:17:37.642 - 00:17:49.822, Speaker A: So it's also good to be developed on top of. But it's also very simple for just a normal user to lend their tokens and for a long term yield.
00:17:49.966 - 00:18:43.762, Speaker B: It's actually really important to the composability and the growth of the protocol. Like lending is still, I don't know if it's number two or number one in terms of use case, I'm going to assume trading is number one, but right after trading, folks like to lend, and that becomes a favorite component to sort of integrate with or to build other protocols around. So lending is very important to have as a facet of fluid. This is where we're starting to see a combination of some of our favorite features in a money market like Ave, as well as a vault protocol like Maker. So the fact that we know, and we're going to cover this in just a bit, that borrowers are using a vault like maker or liquidy, but when we lend, we actually can earn interest here.
00:18:43.896 - 00:20:01.846, Speaker A: Yeah. So what you're saying is the vault protocol. Vault protocol will have a similar experience, as you said, like Makerdao and liquidity, but users will also be able to earn on their collateral, similar to AAVE. So we've designed the vault protocol such that it's a two asset protocol, one collateral and one token. And when you restrict something to two protocols, it allows you to do a lot of hairy sort of algorithmic advancement, similar to how uniswap has always been aligned with two token pools. Because with two tokens, it's simple to create a sort of 2D algorithm rather than when you add multiple tokens, and it gets really fuzzy, complex on solidity level. So yeah, we have focused on two tokens, void, similar to maker, Dow liquidity, and with the advanced algorithm, the advanced innovation we have done on the side of liquidations, which basically improves the liquidation by 100 x, it will allow users to borrow at a very high LTV, earn APR on their collateral, similar to AAvE.
00:20:01.846 - 00:20:16.046, Speaker A: And yeah, it will just increase whatever the users already do, and it will also change how users liquidate in DeFI. So there are a lot of advancement into world protocol.
00:20:16.158 - 00:20:59.850, Speaker C: I think if you scan the landscape of DFI, a lot of what you're proposing doesn't really exist right now. Like, for instance, liquidation penalties as low as 0.1% and then like 95%. LTV against ETH is about as high as I've seen, and probably the highest I've seen. The other thing that really stood out too, is kind of that thing you mentioned at the end was traders are liquidators. Maybe let's start there. How does that work? How are traders becoming liquidators? And maybe if you can tie that into how that makes fluid so efficient, I think that'd be a good thing to explain to listeners.
00:21:00.010 - 00:21:54.400, Speaker A: So we have done huge advancement on the liquidation, on the vault protocol. Now, it's not necessarily exciting for end users, but the capabilities it provides are super exciting for the users, which is higher LTV mainly. So how the higher LTV and liquidations are related is protocol can provide as high LTV as possible till the time the protocol is sure that the protocol can liquidate the position on time. So if protocol can liquidate the bad debt, and protocol doesn't end up having the bad debt, then it can provide higher LTVs to user. And with that in mind, we have done huge innovations on the liquidation side. So what happens? The liquidation system of fluid is loosely inspired by unisor v. Three.
00:21:54.400 - 00:22:25.914, Speaker A: In unisor v. Three, what happens? There are multiple range orders. So how unisor VCs innovated the limit orders. Now there are hundreds or thousands of range order, or even millions. And when a trader trades, the trade doesn't go through. When a user trades, the trade is going through the liquidity at the current spot and not through each range order. So it doesn't matter if there are thousands of range order.
00:22:25.914 - 00:23:11.946, Speaker A: The trade will take the same gas cost, but it will use the entire liquidity in that particular slot, which is exponentially better than a limit order where you have fill each order separately. So similar to that current liquidation in DeFi is sort of like a limit order where you have to liquidate each position separately. Now what we have done, the innovation on that end is when liquidator is liquidating, they are liquidating all the positions which are above the range which are liquidable. And they don't know what positions they are liquidating. They are just liquidating the bad debt. They are not liquidating each position. Similarly, how when you swap on unisoft v three, you don't know which range order you are swapping on.
00:23:11.946 - 00:23:38.466, Speaker A: You are basically swapping through all of them. Here. When a liquidator is liquidating, it's basically liquidating all the positions. Doesn't matter if they want to liquidate $100, $1,000, $1,0000, they can liquidate partially. And the liquidation system here. So you can see the liquidation system is more like just a normal swap happening. You don't have to decide anything, you just have to liquidate on the go.
00:23:38.466 - 00:24:16.878, Speaker A: So what happens is the liquidation gas price is more or less similar to a uniswap swap. And Dex aggregator can integrate this liquidation system similar to adding anything like uniswap pool or curve pool or anything. The integration of liquidation system is super simple. So now you as a trader, let's say you're trading 1000 USDC for ETH. If there is any liquidation available on vault, it will route through there because it will just provide better price. Because rather than paying 0.5% let's say trading fees, you are getting 0.1%
00:24:16.878 - 00:24:39.778, Speaker A: trading fees, so you're ending up getting more through the liquidation and it's just happening. Real time traders don't even have to know that segregator will just route the trade. So it makes everything super simple on liquidator end as well. Anyone can literally build their own liquidation system as well, like even a newbie.
00:24:39.874 - 00:25:11.386, Speaker C: Sam okay, quick question about how the Dex aggregators tie into the liquidation side of fluid. When I was reading that in the blog, I was like, okay, maybe this is my ignorance, maybe there's other teams doing this already, or maybe not. To me that seems like a completely new and novel approach. Is that totally new in Defi? Is there any other teams that you know of kind of tying in the liquidation side of things to like a Dex aggregator?
00:25:11.498 - 00:26:04.766, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you've seen one inch has integrated the curve USD Amm pool as a liquidity source, so if there is any liquidation available, then it goes through that curve USD pool. So similar to that, integration of the liquidation system is like integrating any other Dex protocol for one inch. Integrating the vault liquidation system will be equal work as integrating uniswap pool or any other amm pool. Basically, they don't have to track anything, they don't have to do anything, they just have to see which sort of, for them, it's like a Dex, it's not like there is some liquidation going or anything. It's just a simple Dex providing liquidity of one sided swaps. So for Dex aggregator, they'll just see which Dex is providing better price.
00:26:04.766 - 00:26:45.706, Speaker A: And if vault has some liquidation, it will provide better price. And Dex aggregator can just simply route the trade through it. So no one has to know and it will just happen smoothly. Dex aggregator will be able to provide better price to the users and it will help vault protocol to be liquidated, position on time and overall reduce the liquidation pressure on the overall community as well. This will work well with tokens, which are very actively traded, so specifically stablecoins and ETH. But as we go forward, more tokens can come into this category.
00:26:45.818 - 00:26:56.722, Speaker C: Yeah, this is one of those examples of composability, creating one of those win win scenarios that I really feel like only defi can serve up.
00:26:56.776 - 00:27:27.194, Speaker A: Yeah, and also this is not possible currently in any of the other protocol, because even if, let's say one inch integrates the always liquidation, they still have to track each and every positions which goes above the threshold, which is not feasible for a Dex aggregator to keep a track of these many positions which are near to liquidation and involved. They don't have to do any of that. They just need to do a simple, smart contract call just like any other.
00:27:27.232 - 00:28:27.166, Speaker B: Dexes we've covered the fact that we have this aggregate liquidity layer, which is, I want to say it's simply solving for some of the major issues we run into with moving from ave v two to a V three. So we've got certain innovations there going on. Then we have the fact that we've combined the benefits of a lending protocol that we enjoy on something like Ave with a vault protocol for borrowing with something like maker or liquidy. And a lot of this then is benefiting from improvements to a liquidation mechanism, the liquidation resulting in a 0.1% penalty. Ideally. I don't know if that's always true for every single liquidation, but the fact that it can get that low is amazing, because I think it's as high as, like, is it like 13% on maker or something like that? On, like, ave, I mean, it's high.
00:28:27.166 - 00:28:28.798, Speaker B: It's double digits, right?
00:28:28.884 - 00:29:03.098, Speaker A: Yeah. Ave, I think, has around 5%. Compound also has something around that. And also, one more thing that the liquidation system provides is it only liquidates user till the time the user reaches to the liquidation threshold. So not like you're on the liquidation, your 50% or 100% position will be gone. It will only liquidate. So if there is only need to liquidate 5% of your position, then it will only liquidate that much at that time.
00:29:03.098 - 00:29:19.802, Speaker A: So it helps user to only get liquidated whatever is needed, and also to the overall ecosystem to not put a lot of liquidating pressure and create a huge cascading effect of liquidations.
00:29:19.946 - 00:30:34.114, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the point I really wanted to hammer home. This is what stuck out to me is that the way that liquidations work today in DeFi, and part of the volatility that we have seen in the worst parts of a bear market is that we are essentially overselling or overcorrecting when we reach a point of needing to liquidate positions. And so this is more incrementally liquidating positions. And so the result of this is if this design is ultimately adopted by more protocols, if this becomes more of, like, a standard, we would expect then less of this selling pressure that we see when liquidations start to get triggered in these major sell offs in the market. So it's a win win for everyone. I'm not trying to suggest know the markets won't ever sell off in DeFi, but there is a lot to do with these liquidations that are triggered in mass when we have these drawdowns.
00:30:34.242 - 00:30:54.894, Speaker C: Okay, I think this is a good time to get into the Dex protocol. If the liquidity layer, the lending protocol, and the vault protocol weren't enough, you're also building your own Dex. Can you tell us just a little bit more about this and maybe some of the inner workings of what makes this Dex special and stand out?
00:30:55.012 - 00:31:59.454, Speaker A: Yeah, so Dex protocol in general, the algorithm, there is nothing new. We'll just be using XY plus two k with some conditions of range orders and other things, and we hope to migrate it to unison v four as unison V four goes out to make it even more better. But what it will provide is the features of smart debt and smart collateral, through where the liquidity in the decks will come into place. We already nailed out the hierarchy thing with the vault protocol, but we also wanted to provide better rates than what users can usually get. And that is where the smart collateral and smart debt comes into place. It allows you to earn more on your collateral, and it allows you to get some discount on your debt. And even so, if the trading volume is high, you can even end up earning on your debt, which is kind of a cool thing.
00:31:59.454 - 00:32:06.934, Speaker A: So yeah, this sounds very foreign for anyone new hearing, but for the end user, it will be super simple to use.
00:32:07.052 - 00:32:50.878, Speaker B: Sam, can we walk through an example of how we might use smart debt? Like, let's pretend that I have deposited ETH into a vault. I am going to borrow USDC. I am opting for my debt to be smart debt, which means I'm willing to hold other stablecoins, like something like tether or Dai. And let's also add in the fact that we're in a market that is dumping. The price of ETH has been falling. What are some things that might be happening in the future with fluid?
00:32:51.054 - 00:33:36.862, Speaker A: In this example, there will be a vault as ETH, smart debt, USDC, USDT. So what you will do is borrow from this smart debt pool. So let's take an example. I deposited, let's say, 500 USDC. Adam deposited 500 USDT, and you borrowed $500 from smart debt pool. So your debt currently, let's say, is 250 in USDC and 250 in USDT. So basically you have ETH as collateral, and your debt is basically 250 USDC, 250 USDT, which is backed by the assets that we have lent.
00:33:36.862 - 00:34:15.790, Speaker A: Like 500 USDC from me and 500 USDC from Adam. Now, what will happen is people can trade on top of this debt. This is an aggregated debt into the debt pool. Now, let's say if a user comes, he wants to trade 100 USDC for USDT. Now what will happen is he will give 100 USDC just like any amm pool. 100 USDC will pay back the USDC debt, and the protocol will borrow USDT debt and it will give it to the user. So you had 250 USDC as that, 250 USDT as that.
00:34:15.790 - 00:34:59.850, Speaker A: Now your final position will look like 150 USDC as debt and 350 USDTs debt. And with the trading fees, you'll get some discount, which I have not taken into consideration. The traders can trade on top of this debt, and your debt configuration will keep on changing. But with the stable pairs, it doesn't matter because your debt will remain sort of same in terms of dollar. If a stable coin were to go to zero, you might ask, then you'll just end up getting some discount on your debt because that's your debt, and the debt value has gone down because the debt token has no value. So that particular risk is also not here in that sense.
00:35:00.000 - 00:35:54.106, Speaker B: Yeah, so I can earn passive income. It's probably the best way to describe it in terms of trading fees on my smart debt. So, like right now, if I am borrowing, let's say USDC against ETH in Aave, I mean, that's my debt. There's nothing more I can do with that. I can use instadap and do some things like a debt swap maybe at some point, but this is for someone who is just passively sitting in a debt position, this is a pretty radical thing, like this smart debt idea. If you didn't totally follow what Sam just said, don't be alarmed. It took us a while to really wrap our heads around it, and I think the stablecoin example is the best example of it, where many of us couldn't care less if we're in USDC or die.
00:35:54.106 - 00:36:25.378, Speaker B: So the fact that we're willing to allow someone to trade with stablecoins and ultimately change the makeup of our debt. And in this example, our debt starts out as like 50 50 USDC and tether, and then it ends up being, let's say, more heavily weighted to USDC or tether. It's a really wild concept. How does this play into smart collateral, though? Can you give an example like you just did with smart debt?
00:36:25.474 - 00:37:01.058, Speaker A: Yeah. So the first version of smart volatile slot that we'll launch will be more focused around stable pairs, but we will innovate it more and to adjust it with the more volatile pairs as well. So the most obvious example will be the ETH s ETH as collateral. So you're getting staking Apr through ETH, landing Apr through. Sorry, staking Apr through stake ETH, and landing Apr through ETH. But users can also trade on it. So this is like a smart collateral tool.
00:37:01.058 - 00:37:48.834, Speaker A: You're using it as a collateral, but it's also allowing users to trade between your ETH and stake ETH. So you're also earning a trading fees, so you will end up earning more on your collateral while still using it as collateral. And also ETH and SD are the most used collateral in crypto as of now in defi. So this use case can fit perfectly well there. So it will just allow users to highly optimize their capital. If some user uses collateral and smart deck together with ETH, SD and USDC USDT, then they might end up earning from their positions rather than paying any interest.
00:37:48.952 - 00:38:08.906, Speaker C: Hey, Sam, maybe could you kind of give us examples of where all the DeX liquidity comes from? I guess I'm assuming some of this comes from the lending protocol. Some of this comes from maybe the vault or. Yeah, maybe just kind of let us know where that liquidity comes from. I could be getting that wrong.
00:38:09.008 - 00:38:40.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So for the DAX protocol, it's the debt as liquidity. So let's say has borrowed the $500, 250 USDC, 250 USDT, and he just used it and spent it somewhere else. Now he just has a debt that he needs to pay back. Now that debt is basically the liquidity. Now what traders are doing. So the liquidity comes from the liquidity layer, and liquidity layer can get liquidity from many different points.
00:38:40.130 - 00:39:21.166, Speaker A: It can be lending protocol, wall protocol, or any new protocol that comes in future. Basically, now traders are trading on top of that debt. So it's just changing the configuration of the debt, changing it to 200 USDC, 300 USDT, or 100 USDT, 400 USDC earning fees through it, which is like a discount on debt. So with every trade, debt will go down because of the fees. So over time it will go down. That's how the trading will happen on top of it.
00:39:21.268 - 00:40:27.574, Speaker B: Actually, Sam, I want to do one more example, because now that I think we've covered the four major components that we called out here in the protocol, or in the overarching fluid protocol, can we go back to an example of the market is in free fall. We have folks that have deposited ETH and they're borrowing, let's say, stablecoins. And so we're reaching a point where some of these positions are going to need to be partially liquidated. Can you just talk us through or try to dumb down what happens? How are traders taking advantage of this? I am imagining that we will have the types of professional DeFi liquidators that do exist out there where their full time job is running liquidation bots. But now it's shifted to a different approach where we have traders who are more incrementally liquidating whatever size of positions they want to.
00:40:27.772 - 00:41:04.994, Speaker A: Yeah, so there are two cases here. One is like trader liquidating through Dex aggregator, and other is also anyone can just set up their liquidation system. And as I said, the liquidation here is like a trade. You don't need to track anything or anything. Now, it's not limited to the professional liquidators. Anyone can even also set up a liquidation system on their end and on launch, we'll probably make the script or the thing open source, anyone who wants to run and just run it. So it will simplify the overall liquidation in that way.
00:41:04.994 - 00:41:49.050, Speaker A: For the case of smart debt, smart collateral, let's say ETH price went down. Now anyone who is liquidating the position, it will be the similar way. They will just pay back the debt and they will get the ETH as collateral. Now, from the user perspective, or from a liquidator perspective, let's talk about user first. So in the example I've taken, like you have borrowed 250 USDC, 250 USDT, but from the UI experience, you can even borrow in a single token. Let's say you just want 500 USDC, so you borrowed 500 USDC and the protocol will do an internal swap. So your final configuration will look like 250 USDC, 250 USDT.
00:41:49.050 - 00:42:26.902, Speaker A: But you will in actual have 500 USDC in your wallet. So from the user experience, it will be super simple to use, even for liquidator. They can just pay back debt in a single token. Either it's USDC there, it's USTT, and they will get ETH as collateral and then liquidation. As you know, the vault's liquidation mechanism, the liquidation can route through Dex aggregator according to the yeah, I mean, I think the liquidation will remain more or less same and seamless without having to do any tracking.
00:42:27.046 - 00:42:44.210, Speaker B: Sam, there is an inst token, and so I'm wondering what utility might the inst token inherit when you launch the fluid protocol, or what's the plan long term in terms of the token and how it will play into fluid protocol?
00:42:44.790 - 00:44:00.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I think inst will have a very big role here on the overall protocol governance. The governance of the protocol is as heavy as any other borrow and lending protocol like Makerdao compound or AAVE so there needs to be all the configuration settings, all the growth plans rewarding and everything, and all the access will be with the INSP holders. So they will decide on what fees to charge, what LTV to provide, what rates to, what is the perfect rate for the particular environment. All the basic things that other protocol does is already here. And then there will be some additional things like adding or addition of a protocol to the liquidity layer, allowing them to supply or borrow from liquidity layer, the limits to set. And all those will be the roles of INS government. So I think the governance will get super active once the protocol goes live with keeping in mind all the configurations.
00:44:00.646 - 00:45:13.946, Speaker B: Instadep any given day has about 2 billion in liquidity in its smart contracts, and this is during, I would say, one of the lowest points of the bear market. So that number has been much higher and we would anticipate it going much higher. But I do recognize there's a challenge with any new DeFi protocol, even when it's built by a reputable name like instadap. So what are the growth plans in terms of attracting, or I'll even say incentivizing liquidity? The benefits that we've called out here, like the 95% LTV for borrowers, the 0.1% liquidation penalty, these are compelling enough for me that I jumped out of my seat when I first learned about that. And I'm reading that in the blog post, because those are features that for any of us who are already borrowing in DeFi, we're going to seek out that higher LTV and lower liquidation penalty. But for all the other players that make up this fluid protocol, what are the growth plans to attract that liquidity and those participants?
00:45:14.138 - 00:46:00.906, Speaker A: So what plans we have is INS governance already has a huge amount of Insp treasury, but on launch, maybe distribute stable coins and ETH as rewards rather than Inst. So basically, users getting USDC on USDC, USDT on USDC, ETH on ETH. And we just think like that could be a better model for the initial growth of the protocol. From our expectancy, around 1 million to 1.5 million of rewards can bring plus 200 million of TVL into the protocol. So according to the numbers that we have run. So that's what we are planning.
00:46:00.906 - 00:46:52.842, Speaker A: And Insp governance also has around 2 million of the revenue. So using that revenue to boost the initial growth of the protocol to at least a $200 million mark, that's what we are planning on. We're going to release more better details around it as we get closer to the launch, like how all the revenue will work, but basically it will simplify for all the users. Like if you're lending USDC, you'll just end up getting higher lending APR rather than seeing particular reward getting distributed. So I think that might attract quite a lot of TVL in that sense. Like if you're earning 5%, 6% on USDC, you might prefer to land it here rather than three 4% somewhere else. So yeah, that's what our goal is.
00:46:52.996 - 00:47:23.850, Speaker B: Well, guys, this is probably a good place for us to start to wrap up. I want to encourage everyone to first they can learn more about instadap at instadap IO. If you go there, there will be a link to the blog post that was just published today. If you go to instadap on Twitter, you can also find the blog post there. So we'll link that in the show notes. And that's just instadap. That's the handle.
00:47:23.850 - 00:48:03.574, Speaker B: I also want to encourage folks to learn about the avocado wallet, which is, there's a suite of products there that we've discussed previously on the Edge podcast. And you can go back and watch that episode with Sam talking about the avocado wallet and the avocado multi sig wallet. Sam, I'm going to give you the last word then. The final question I wanted to make sure that we have answered here is what are the key dates for fluid that we can look forward to in terms of when it will launch or when you'll be done with security audits and reviews and all of that? Good stuff.
00:48:03.772 - 00:49:07.450, Speaker A: Yeah. So we expect to be done with the security audits by November and that is when we plan to make the code base public for open audits. Tentative timelines are we're planning to deploy the main protocol on main net around mid December, but it won't be public yet. After that, either through governance, treasury or from teams fund, we are planning to put half a million dollar into the protocol and just do an open hacking competition. Anyone who is able to hack can take all the money and then launch the main protocol around mid January. So we want to focus super highly security before it buy proper audits through auditing firms, do an open audit and then just an open competition sort of. If anyone can hack, they can take the money and then launch the protocol after making sure that it's extremely safe and secure.
00:49:07.450 - 00:49:17.514, Speaker A: So yeah, that are timelines for user. They can start using it probably by mid January.
00:49:17.642 - 00:50:00.154, Speaker B: That's awesome. So for folks that want to learn about fluid, check out the blog post that's linked in the show notes, that's the best place to get even more detailed. And I think what we covered here. And Sam, just thanks again for joining us. I won't sugarcoat the fact that I think I've said it publicly or been alluding to it on Twitter, that there is this zero to one innovation coming. We haven't seen many of these in the last few years. It's really been since like 2019 2020 in DFI, where we saw such major updates and innovations brought forth by certain protocols that this is it.
00:50:00.154 - 00:50:17.566, Speaker B: This is, for me, I think, one of the most important developments, and I think 2024 will be a year of proving that DFI can scale, thankfully, because of protocols like fluid. So anyways, congrats on all the progress and just again, always a privilege for us to get to talk with you.
00:50:17.748 - 00:50:22.730, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks a lot and really enjoyed the overall discussion.
00:50:22.890 - 00:50:35.570, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talent, founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at edge pod.
