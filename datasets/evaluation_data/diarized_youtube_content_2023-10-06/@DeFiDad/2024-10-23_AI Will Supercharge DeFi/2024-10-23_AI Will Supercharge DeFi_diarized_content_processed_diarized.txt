00:00:00.280 - 00:00:02.137, Speaker A: AI and crypto are really this like.
00:00:02.201 - 00:00:04.329, Speaker B: Almost perfect marriage of technologies.
00:00:04.377 - 00:00:24.925, Speaker A: In a lot of ways, I think AI is the most deflationary technology to ever exist. It's this highly expressive, powerful form of compute that much of society and much of our sort of like operating models in the world are going to move to. And crypto is this incredibly powerful tool for programmatic economic coordination.

00:03:07.083 - 00:03:12.355, Speaker D: Co founder and CEO of Alora Labs. Nick, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:12.435 - 00:03:13.291, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Yeah.
00:03:13.323 - 00:03:14.299, Speaker A: Thanks for having me today.
00:03:14.387 - 00:03:53.761, Speaker D: So previously we've recorded conversations with Morpheus and other founders that are working at this intersection of crypto and AI. Nomadic and I have talked a lot about how it feels like we're in the early days of still, like, hypothesizing and theorizing and planning out why crypto and AI go so well together, why they're so complementary as technologies. And so, given your background, we are just excited to get to learn from you about, like, how do you see that future playing out? And again, why do these technologies deserve to be married together? Why does AI benefit from crypto and crypto benefit from AI?
00:03:53.873 - 00:03:55.113, Speaker C: We're going to talk about that and.
00:03:55.129 - 00:04:16.791, Speaker D: Of course that should lead us into what you've been building there at Alora Labs. So, Nick, why don't we. Yeah, just start out there then, like, do you want to, you know, share some thoughts on, I guess, like, what got you to start building in this nascent space? And I guess, like, how does AI and crypto go together?
00:04:16.953 - 00:04:23.155, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think AI and crypto are really this, like, almost perfect marriage of technologies.
00:04:23.195 - 00:04:23.939, Speaker B: In a lot of ways.
00:04:23.987 - 00:05:00.063, Speaker A: I think AI is the most deflationary technology to ever exist. It's this highly expressive, powerful form of compute that much of society and much of our sort of like operating models in the world are going to move to. And crypto is this incredibly powerful tool for programmatic economic coordination. And so I think that that sort of reveals itself in sort of two instantiations or two kind of like ultimate constructions of AI merging with crypto. For one, I think we can start to construct a kind of decentralized alternative.
00:05:00.119 - 00:05:02.839, Speaker B: To AI via crypto, via kind of.
00:05:02.887 - 00:05:12.331, Speaker A: Creating the different core functions that make up AI. Ultimately, via these kind of decentralized coordination mechanisms or market based environments, we can.
00:05:12.363 - 00:05:15.067, Speaker B: Provision excess compute towards training and inference.
00:05:15.131 - 00:05:26.867, Speaker A: We can leverage crypto to coordinate different people to provision and structure data optimally for models. We can use crypto to coordinate different models to sort of learn off one.
00:05:26.891 - 00:05:30.291, Speaker B: Another, to create a better source of intelligence itself.
00:05:30.483 - 00:05:41.291, Speaker A: And then sort of on the consumption end of AI and crypto, crypto also becomes this incredibly powerful, I guess, economic substrate by which these ultimate AIs can.
00:05:41.323 - 00:05:42.643, Speaker B: Coordinate with one another.
00:05:42.779 - 00:06:03.691, Speaker A: They can be transacting via this permissionless and decentralized financial system. They can be partaking in, I guess more peer to peer interactions that is currently available to kind of the AIs of the future. And so that's, that's the sort of, I guess dual faceted approach or dual faceted aspects to how I think AI.
00:06:03.723 - 00:06:06.115, Speaker B: And crypto also ultimately intersect and why.
00:06:06.155 - 00:06:09.051, Speaker A: They are such a kind of perfect marriage of technologies.
00:06:09.123 - 00:06:33.235, Speaker E: So Nick, Nick, I want to try to spin this as much towards Defi, I think as possible, but let's kind of stay still high level with this. I'm curious, kind of to get your take on how you see or have seen AI impacting traditional markets. So traditional markets and crypto. And do you think we're still kind of just scratching the surface there?
00:06:33.695 - 00:06:35.167, Speaker A: I think AI has been around for.
00:06:35.191 - 00:06:38.591, Speaker B: A long time obviously and it's impacted a lot of our daily lives.
00:06:38.703 - 00:06:53.441, Speaker A: I think more so in the background than the forefront. I think over the past two years or so people have started to touch AI much more personally and have developed this, I guess more intimate relationship with AI. But AI has been around and has.
00:06:53.473 - 00:06:55.697, Speaker B: Been this very powerful upgrade to a.
00:06:55.721 - 00:07:30.157, Speaker A: Lot of like various industries and pieces of infrastructure from, from finance to fraud detection to sort of these, these kind of background conveniences in our lives. And I think as of the past few years, like I said, this, this kind of more direct interpersonal relationship with AI is, is starting to take form and I think it's excited a lot of people, it's, it's sort of ignited a lot of people's imagination around what AI will mean for kind of day to day life in the future. But I do think this, this kind of personal relationship with AI is still.
00:07:30.181 - 00:07:31.469, Speaker B: In its sort of nascency.
00:07:31.517 - 00:07:49.417, Speaker A: I think there's, there's obviously still a lot of improvement to be made there. There's a lot of kind of ironing out of what that relationship with AI ultimately looks like. But AI has been a very sort of critical piece of many different industries today. Just more so in the background than it has been in recent years.
00:07:49.521 - 00:08:27.775, Speaker D: Nick, can we start to get into some of the use cases you're excited for? I think again previously when we had Morpheus on, we talked about AI agents and how that might help to solve for a lot of the challenges that we all faced as early users of crypto. Just having to onboard and understand all the different nuances of all these different tools and having that all abstracted away with AI agents. But I'd love to get more of your thoughts on how does this play into Defi Maybe. What are some of the use cases there that you could see us benefiting from with AI integrated?
00:08:27.895 - 00:08:28.239, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:28.287 - 00:08:29.927, Speaker B: So I think agents will be a.
00:08:29.951 - 00:08:49.519, Speaker A: Big piece of how AI interacts with DeFi. I think agents are just more capable actors in an environment that is sort of intrinsically obscure or complex, which is the financial system generally. And that applies to DEFI as well. I think AI is going to apply.
00:08:49.567 - 00:08:53.367, Speaker B: The most to DEFI for the foreseeable future for a couple of reasons.
00:08:53.431 - 00:09:25.009, Speaker A: One, I think crypto ultimately is a financial innovation at its core. And even if that is arguable, even if one can composite kind of a more diverse ecosystem of verticals that crypto touches, I think it's fairly indisputable that most, if not all of crypto's product market fit has been found in these various financial domains. DEFI is by far the most kind of successful sector within crypto. And on the AI side, I think.
00:09:25.137 - 00:09:27.865, Speaker B: While this generative AI stuff, LLMs, et.
00:09:27.905 - 00:09:32.649, Speaker A: Cetera, is obviously the sort of focus of many people when they think about.
00:09:32.697 - 00:09:34.601, Speaker B: AI, it's still in its nascent, it's.
00:09:34.633 - 00:09:47.329, Speaker A: Still in this kind of quasi toy stage. Whereas I guess classical AI or AI that has historically been used in more financial domains is much more mature, it's much more production ready.
00:09:47.457 - 00:09:49.009, Speaker B: And so for all of those reasons.
00:09:49.057 - 00:10:03.225, Speaker A: I think the immediate value we see created at this intersection of AI and crypto is going to be across DEFI predominantly. And what we can do with AI and DeFi is a number of different things. One, we can start to upgrade the.
00:10:03.265 - 00:10:05.833, Speaker B: Core mechanisms or the core protocols themselves.
00:10:05.969 - 00:10:26.997, Speaker A: Think smarter lending system management. Think, think smarter liquidity management. These kind of more intelligent levers that one can pull and design defi systems around. That's just not possible with such a kind of minimally expressive computing framework that.
00:10:27.021 - 00:10:29.637, Speaker B: Is available in smart contracts today.
00:10:29.781 - 00:10:42.927, Speaker A: And I think what's going to be really exciting is seeing what AI and DeFi do in expanding the scope of asset categories that are now compatible with the financial system and compatible with markets.
00:10:43.061 - 00:10:45.283, Speaker B: Get really into the long tail, these.
00:10:45.339 - 00:10:57.099, Speaker A: Weird exotic asset categories that we likely don't even think of as sort of financial assets today. And I think that looks like prediction markets that apply to a much more.
00:10:57.147 - 00:10:58.387, Speaker B: Diverse range of things.
00:10:58.451 - 00:11:20.295, Speaker A: Prediction markets that maybe apply to really minute and sort of day to day things that would otherwise not be, I guess, viable in the current instantiation that prediction markets or prediction market actors exist in today. Start to think more granularly around how like culture is financialized around the types.
00:11:20.335 - 00:11:22.447, Speaker B: Of risks that can be financialized and.
00:11:22.471 - 00:11:45.934, Speaker A: Hedged against into really exotic categories, things like this. I think what DEFI has done is it has enabled us to codify these different market primitives to enable or to lower the overhead of coordinating different actors in financial settings. And that's why I think like AMMs have succeeded.
00:11:46.024 - 00:11:48.981, Speaker B: AMMs are more capital efficient than order books.
00:11:49.093 - 00:12:05.933, Speaker A: But when you abstract away or I guess automate the liquidity provisioning action, you expand the scope of assets that can now be viable in a market setting. And AI does that a hundred decibels ladder, it turns that up to a.
00:12:05.949 - 00:12:07.485, Speaker B: Hundred in that it is this highly.
00:12:07.525 - 00:12:14.961, Speaker A: Deflationary technology that when combined with programmatic financial infrastructure can significantly expand the scope.
00:12:14.993 - 00:12:18.977, Speaker B: Of what can be financialized or what financial markets can apply to in the.
00:12:19.001 - 00:12:20.985, Speaker A: World today, which I think is a really powerful thing.
00:12:21.065 - 00:12:48.569, Speaker E: Nick, right at the top there, you kind of gave an example of how AI could perhaps supercharge a lending market. I would just love to dive into that a little bit deeper to kind of make that a little bit clearer. And why don't we just kind of take AAVE as an example. Say AAVE wanted to leverage AI more deeply in their protocol. How would they go about doing that and what are the benefits to the protocol and maybe the end users?
00:12:48.697 - 00:13:02.009, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's a few ways AI fits into a lending system to upgrade its capabilities and its applicability across new markets. So for one, when we think about these lending systems today, the sort of.
00:13:02.097 - 00:13:05.649, Speaker B: Underwriting logic, while powerful and widely applicable.
00:13:05.697 - 00:13:21.105, Speaker A: To the assets it is compatible with, is still somewhat primitive in that you're basically looking at utilization ratios. Right. When you integrate AI, which again is this incredibly deflationary technology, you can start.
00:13:21.145 - 00:13:24.177, Speaker B: To build underwriting or lending logic around.
00:13:24.321 - 00:13:32.129, Speaker A: A much, a much more like multivariate space of factors. You can look at the entire basket of assets in a lending system.
00:13:32.177 - 00:13:34.585, Speaker B: You can look at the level of correlation across them.
00:13:34.625 - 00:13:36.555, Speaker A: You can look at these kind of.
00:13:36.675 - 00:13:41.443, Speaker B: Instances of volatility or risk that may, may be arising across these different assets.
00:13:41.499 - 00:13:44.411, Speaker A: And assign the kind of core parameters.
00:13:44.443 - 00:13:46.339, Speaker B: That determine the rates one is taking.
00:13:46.387 - 00:13:50.011, Speaker A: Out, the amount of debt one can take out against an asset, etc.
00:13:50.123 - 00:13:51.875, Speaker B: In a much more informed way.
00:13:51.995 - 00:13:56.171, Speaker A: As a function of that, you can create a much more capital efficient and.
00:13:56.203 - 00:13:58.467, Speaker B: Risk mitigated lending system as well.
00:13:58.611 - 00:14:06.921, Speaker A: And I think beyond that, like, like we talked about a little earlier, not only can you make the, the sort of lending logic of these types of.
00:14:06.953 - 00:14:09.201, Speaker B: Systems more efficient or more expressive with.
00:14:09.233 - 00:14:11.481, Speaker A: AI, you can also expand to a.
00:14:11.513 - 00:14:14.121, Speaker B: Much Much larger set of assets as well.
00:14:14.233 - 00:14:22.281, Speaker A: Right now there's, there's a number of risk concerns and expanding too aggressively into too long tail of assets or too illiquid of markets.
00:14:22.393 - 00:14:24.433, Speaker B: But AI can sort of account for.
00:14:24.489 - 00:14:29.569, Speaker A: Those things at least much more capably than is possible today and make more.
00:14:29.657 - 00:14:32.583, Speaker B: Intelligent decisions around what types of assets.
00:14:32.639 - 00:14:34.815, Speaker A: Should we enable debt to be taken.
00:14:34.855 - 00:14:37.175, Speaker B: Out against and to what degrees and.
00:14:37.215 - 00:14:40.095, Speaker A: Create a much more, I guess, inclusive.
00:14:40.135 - 00:14:45.167, Speaker B: Or all encompassing lending system as well as a more capital efficient and risk mitigated one.
00:14:45.231 - 00:14:59.443, Speaker D: I actually want to go back to what you were building previously with Upshot and maybe you can just tell us like what about Upshot informed you to go the direction you've gone with Alora? And hopefully we can kind of tie that all together.
00:14:59.579 - 00:15:00.291, Speaker B: Sure, yeah.
00:15:00.323 - 00:15:05.251, Speaker A: So when we were building Upshot, our, our core goal was to I guess.
00:15:05.323 - 00:15:09.275, Speaker B: Build infrastructure that enabled long tail markets to be more efficient.
00:15:09.355 - 00:15:33.853, Speaker A: Long tail markets are by definition not super liquid or efficient. And so we thought an interesting like specific domain to focus on there would be something like NFTs which are incredibly long tail inefficient asset types. And when thinking about making these types of long tail markets more efficient, you start to look outside of kind of like market based mechanisms alone as a.
00:15:33.869 - 00:15:35.429, Speaker B: Means of making them efficient.
00:15:35.557 - 00:15:55.311, Speaker A: So what we were thinking about was how do we leverage, I guess a cheaper source of price information or price discovery that doesn't require an asset to change hands as the means of updating that price to create something close to a real time price feed for new types of assets.
00:15:55.383 - 00:15:56.879, Speaker B: And then when armed with real time.
00:15:56.927 - 00:15:58.887, Speaker A: Price feeds for different types of assets.
00:15:59.031 - 00:16:00.855, Speaker B: You can build a whole suite of.
00:16:00.975 - 00:16:11.279, Speaker A: More useful and expressive financial infrastructure around them. And so essentially what that led to is, is what we built with, with Upshot is this kind of like long.
00:16:11.327 - 00:16:13.103, Speaker B: Tail price discovery engine.
00:16:13.199 - 00:16:33.467, Speaker A: It started off in the early days as this price discovery engine that was created by the crowd, literal humans going in and, and conveying their beliefs around the value of different NFTs or different long tail assets. And this was all kind of stitched together with some research we had been doing since the very early days of.
00:16:33.491 - 00:16:35.923, Speaker B: The company around kind of subjective consensus.
00:16:35.979 - 00:16:51.941, Speaker A: Mechanism design which is focused on how do we incentivize a group of actors or a group of people to reach consensus on the answers to subjective questions, which is like a really powerful, primitive, really powerful tool in building a lot of these things.
00:16:52.093 - 00:16:53.789, Speaker B: And as we built out that early.
00:16:53.837 - 00:16:56.797, Speaker A: Sort of human crowdsource price discovery engine.
00:16:56.941 - 00:16:59.405, Speaker B: Via the subjective consensus mechanism, we had.
00:16:59.445 - 00:17:01.685, Speaker A: Designed, we realized humans are just like.
00:17:01.725 - 00:17:03.693, Speaker B: Really inefficient forms of compute.
00:17:03.829 - 00:17:17.177, Speaker A: They can't price many things, they can't price things very accurately. And so pretty quickly on in Upshot's life cycle, this was early 2021, I believe, we shifted to building models for.
00:17:17.281 - 00:17:22.505, Speaker B: Producing near real time price feeds for NFTs, gaming items, all different types of.
00:17:22.545 - 00:17:40.373, Speaker A: These long tail assets. And then with those started to expand into like AI powered derivative products or AI powered tooling to build lending systems, perpetual systems, market making strategies for these types of assets that were historically illiquid or inefficient.
00:17:40.489 - 00:17:53.029, Speaker E: I can tell you gained a ton of insight building Upshot. Maybe tell us, I guess we should introduce alora. We haven't even really had you kind of tell us what it is and just kind of describe how it all works.
00:17:53.157 - 00:17:53.805, Speaker B: Sure, yeah.
00:17:53.845 - 00:17:59.357, Speaker A: So basically what ALORA is, is it's a collective intelligence network, or you can.
00:17:59.381 - 00:18:00.485, Speaker B: Think of it as well as this.
00:18:00.525 - 00:18:20.711, Speaker A: Kind of self improving, decentralized AI network. It attempts to solve this really fundamental problem in AI today that we refer to as siloed machine intelligence, where there's lots of models that exist in the world today, but they all exist in these kind of isolated silos. I can't take model A, model B, model C, kind of jam them all.
00:18:20.743 - 00:18:22.487, Speaker B: Together and create a new model that.
00:18:22.511 - 00:18:25.303, Speaker A: Is the sort of sum of intelligence.
00:18:25.359 - 00:18:26.975, Speaker B: Of those underlying models.
00:18:27.095 - 00:18:59.181, Speaker A: And what this produces is a kind of environments that we have today where these large monoliths who have accumulated the most raw resources that go into producing AI, which is data and computer, will continuously create the best models because models exist in silos. And it's difficult for kind of smaller, more specialized or more nimble kind of contributors to AI to sort of contribute to the broader whole. And so what we, what we've done is take a lot of the things we learned when building Upshot in this.
00:18:59.213 - 00:19:08.283, Speaker B: Kind of subjective consensus mechanism research in building AI powered crypto infrastructure and created this kind of network where different models.
00:19:08.339 - 00:19:14.355, Speaker A: Can learn off of one another as they collaboratively or collectively optimize different ML.
00:19:14.435 - 00:19:17.227, Speaker B: Problems and have those outputs stitched together.
00:19:17.291 - 00:19:24.867, Speaker A: In such a way that produces this kind of collective inference or this aggregate inference that is consistently better than any.
00:19:24.891 - 00:19:29.267, Speaker B: Of the individual models contributing to it. And in doing so, creating this kind.
00:19:29.291 - 00:19:36.167, Speaker A: Of collective intelligence network, breaking down the silos between models that exist today and.
00:19:36.191 - 00:19:38.767, Speaker B: Sort of turning intelligence itself into some.
00:19:38.831 - 00:19:46.879, Speaker A: Kind of more tangible form of digital commodity, just as other blockchain networks do with other types of resources, just as.
00:19:46.927 - 00:19:50.247, Speaker B: Bitcoin does with energy or just as Akash does with compute.
00:19:50.311 - 00:19:51.063, Speaker A: Things like this.
00:19:51.159 - 00:20:20.761, Speaker D: Nick, have you thought then about how will you productize, like what you just mentioned? Like, I'm thinking about like what does a package or a service look like in the future for someone that's working with Alora Labs? Also like, I mean, is this going to be a full blown protocol? Like just integrate and all the tokenized incentives will sort of like work together? That is really unclear for me. Just because this is all like totally new territory in terms of what you're building.
00:20:20.913 - 00:20:21.673, Speaker B: Sure, yeah.
00:20:21.769 - 00:20:41.175, Speaker A: I'll tackle that by touching on both sides of the market because it's sort of a two sided market. Most networks are so starting on the supply side. What this kind of network enables is this like hyper efficient market for intelligence itself. Today, if I'm a data scientist, if I'm an ML engineer and I develop.
00:20:41.255 - 00:20:43.031, Speaker B: Some useful new model or have some.
00:20:43.063 - 00:20:46.823, Speaker A: Insight on how to build a better AI, I have to follow this really.
00:20:46.879 - 00:20:49.095, Speaker B: Long indirect path to value capture.
00:20:49.135 - 00:20:50.679, Speaker A: I have to productize it, maybe I.
00:20:50.687 - 00:20:51.983, Speaker B: Have to raise funding, I have to.
00:20:51.999 - 00:20:54.935, Speaker A: Achieve distribution, maybe it's, if it's financial.
00:20:55.015 - 00:20:56.279, Speaker B: Related, I have to raise a fund.
00:20:56.327 - 00:21:00.721, Speaker A: Spin up all these other business functions. It's a really long indirect path which.
00:21:00.753 - 00:21:03.649, Speaker B: Makes it an inefficient market by definition.
00:21:03.777 - 00:21:10.073, Speaker A: And what, what Alura does is it creates the shortest possible path from having.
00:21:10.129 - 00:21:12.185, Speaker B: Some useful model or some useful insight.
00:21:12.225 - 00:21:18.673, Speaker A: In AI to capturing value from it just by turning it on on the Alora network and having it contribute to.
00:21:18.689 - 00:21:23.465, Speaker B: The optimization of different ML problems. This is the same thing that Bitcoin did for energy.
00:21:23.545 - 00:21:28.437, Speaker A: Prior to Bitcoin there were these indirect paths to value capture by having access.
00:21:28.501 - 00:21:30.637, Speaker B: To some excess energy or power.
00:21:30.781 - 00:21:38.965, Speaker A: And now Bitcoin creates the shortest possible path from excess energy to value capture. And Alora does that for ML engineers.
00:21:39.045 - 00:21:41.669, Speaker B: Data scientists, et cetera, with intelligence itself.
00:21:41.717 - 00:21:49.077, Speaker A: So it creates this really efficient market for intelligence. And then on the demand side, what this network kind of creates is a.
00:21:49.101 - 00:21:52.821, Speaker B: Sort of abstraction layer for intelligence. So today when any of us want.
00:21:52.853 - 00:22:03.509, Speaker A: To use ML, whether we're using it in our kind of day to day lives via chatbot or we're building applications with it, we have to constantly be doing this discovery and evaluation process of.
00:22:03.637 - 00:22:05.141, Speaker B: What is the best model for this.
00:22:05.173 - 00:22:13.853, Speaker A: Given task or for this context, and constantly be switching, switching between these different models based on that adds a lot of overhead and a lot of friction.
00:22:13.909 - 00:22:22.241, Speaker B: To the use of these things, to the development of these things, et cetera and Alora creates this kind of abstraction layer for intelligence.
00:22:22.373 - 00:22:32.705, Speaker A: So instead of say a defi protocol needing to pick specific models to build new types of primitives around, they just kind of specify the thing they want.
00:22:32.745 - 00:22:34.241, Speaker B: Their models to be really good at.
00:22:34.273 - 00:22:57.835, Speaker A: I want my model to be really good at predicting the price of some asset or in modeling volatility in some way. And then ALORA is this sort of like has this underlying set of model creators and ML engineers that are constantly trying to produce the best possible outfit output. I think a useful analogy here is kind of transactions to intents. And as we're moving to a more.
00:22:57.875 - 00:23:00.171, Speaker B: Intent centric means of interacting with blockchain.
00:23:00.203 - 00:23:06.099, Speaker A: We'Re moving away obviously from specifying the specific steps we want something to take.
00:23:06.187 - 00:23:08.395, Speaker B: And we're specifying our desired outcome.
00:23:08.515 - 00:23:10.491, Speaker A: And what ALORA enables is this move.
00:23:10.523 - 00:23:12.947, Speaker B: From a model centric paradigm of interacting.
00:23:12.971 - 00:23:16.233, Speaker A: With AI to a kind of objective centric paradigm.
00:23:16.379 - 00:23:18.261, Speaker B: You don't specify the model you want.
00:23:18.293 - 00:23:24.597, Speaker A: To interact with that you want to integrate into your application or protocol. You specify what you want AI to.
00:23:24.621 - 00:23:26.333, Speaker B: Do really well and then the network.
00:23:26.389 - 00:23:28.373, Speaker A: Kind of handles it on its own.
00:23:28.469 - 00:23:53.261, Speaker E: That's cool. If I were to like play some of this back with, you know, my layman terms here, I almost see it as like an AI kind of fiver, where you can kind of put out what you want somebody to build you build for you or make for you. And it's like crowdsourced intelligence that's delivered back for that use case that you've asked for. Is that, is that kind of like hitting it all like, what, what, what Alura is?
00:23:53.373 - 00:24:05.053, Speaker A: I think so, yeah. Fiverr, I think has different connotations to it in terms of the quality of output. But, but yeah, I think like internally we think about it a lot like Kaggle, if you guys are familiar, your.
00:24:05.069 - 00:24:06.653, Speaker B: Audience is familiar with Kaggle, which is.
00:24:06.669 - 00:24:22.057, Speaker A: This like ML competition platform where people put up competitions and different data scientists compete to produce the best possible model. And so this is that with the additional step of bringing together the models.
00:24:22.121 - 00:24:26.865, Speaker B: Enabling them to learn off of one another and improve over time, happen perpetually, et cetera.
00:24:26.945 - 00:24:44.037, Speaker E: And then Nick, I saw in some of your blogs you're working with chains like Mantle, Eclipse and then apps like Pancakeswap. Just kind of curious how you're partnering with them and like what services you're providing for these chains and partners.
00:24:44.161 - 00:24:46.653, Speaker B: Yeah, it varies across these different ecosystems.
00:24:46.749 - 00:24:58.013, Speaker A: Based on the kind of like focus areas of different ecosystems. But a lot of the work we're doing today is really focused on Kind of like Defi upgrades and bringing AI closer to DeFi.
00:24:58.149 - 00:24:59.573, Speaker B: And so in working with these different.
00:24:59.629 - 00:26:23.015, Speaker A: Networks where we're ensuring there is, there is I guess like as robust as possible integrations from the ELORA network to these chains to ensure that it's as easy as possible for application developers or protocol developers building on these chains to, to leverage this source of collective intelligence and then with the applications themselves kind of working to create these powerful and novel new AI powered like DeFi primitives and in some cases gaming and things like this. But like with Pancake Swap for example, they're leveraging ALORA to create an AI powered prediction market around these kind of like recurring price movements of different assets. Having users participating in these prediction markets to bet with or against the AI that is produced by a collection of models on the ALORA network in with regard to what direction like ETHUSD is going to move in the next 10 minutes. There's some, there's an agent live leveraging ALORA as well who's trading poly markets for the US election that is taking a collection of different US election models and then making buying and selling decisions in the poly market US election markets to kind of create this like passive source of exposure to those markets as, as is sort of managed by these.
00:26:23.095 - 00:26:24.775, Speaker B: These different models, things like that.
00:26:24.815 - 00:26:29.595, Speaker A: It's those types of kind of AI powered defi primitives that we're spending a lot of time on right now.
00:26:31.895 - 00:27:06.861, Speaker C: Hey everyone, before we get back to the show, excited to tell you about a new Omnichain Bitcoin solution called FBTC which has already surpassed $125 million in TVL and become the fastest growing BTCFI asset this summer. The FBTC Points campaign Sparkle offers Sustainable yields + points and token airdrops from strategic partners such as Babylon, Mantle's new token Cook and more. To learn more visit fbtc.com ongoing campaign and special thanks to FBTC for sponsoring.
00:27:06.893 - 00:28:23.225, Speaker D: Us at the Edge podcast. In terms of these examples of applications, I mean are we getting closer then to like a future where it's just AIs trading against AIs it's, it's like a competition of like what access you have to AI. Like I don't doubt that we, we will run into this future at some point and I think to, to not accept that and to recognize that it is going to be important for everyone to have democratized access to AI. It's going to be really important for I think the future of any person having a chance in this world, but I'm trying to understand what happens in between there. It feels like at first we have simple enhancements to like the DeFi UX. We start to see, let's say, like a poly market, where suddenly it's becoming even more accurate in telling us like what will be the outcome of something like an election. Because you have AIs that are taking all this data, processing it faster than we ever could.
00:28:23.225 - 00:28:42.169, Speaker D: Yeah. Just thinking about, I guess, what's the timeline you see ahead of us? I mean, is this coming faster than we expect? I mean, sometimes there's talk of like AGI coming in the next few years and other times I hear speculation it's something like, you know, decades out.
00:28:42.297 - 00:28:49.569, Speaker A: Yeah. What I forget the exact saying, but it's people overestimate results in the short.
00:28:49.617 - 00:28:52.161, Speaker B: Term and underestimate in the long term.
00:28:52.313 - 00:29:18.221, Speaker A: I think something similar plays out here, as it does most times where people have been saying AGI is a year away for two years now. And it's. Just because it's not a year away today doesn't mean that it's 10 years away necessarily. I think there's going to be these sort of like cyclical instances where a lot of things happen at once and then we kind of cool off and the next wave of things happen. I think progress tends to follow a.
00:29:18.253 - 00:29:23.765, Speaker B: Similar structure to market cycles themselves, since markets are what drive a lot of progress in the world.
00:29:23.805 - 00:29:25.323, Speaker A: And so I think we'll see a.
00:29:25.339 - 00:29:27.499, Speaker B: Bunch of stuff happen really quickly and.
00:29:27.507 - 00:29:33.155, Speaker A: Then things will cool off for a while and then we'll see the really crazy, exotic kind of funky things happen.
00:29:33.275 - 00:29:35.259, Speaker B: Maybe a little bit longer down the road.
00:29:35.387 - 00:29:39.323, Speaker A: And that's, that's kind of the like dynamic I see playing out.
00:29:39.379 - 00:29:52.613, Speaker E: Nick, if people are listening to this, how do they get started? With alora, I think I saw that there's a points campaign going on, but maybe what can they do today? And, and how can they kind of support the ALORA network right now?
00:29:52.709 - 00:30:08.677, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the supply side, which I think is a really interesting place to participate in ALORA and these kind of like net new interactions one can make with decentralized AI, is anyone who has any experience at all building interesting ML.
00:30:08.741 - 00:30:11.325, Speaker B: Models or even adapting existing models, maybe.
00:30:11.365 - 00:30:58.459, Speaker A: They find on Hugging Face or something like that can begin contributing those models, outputs to the network and, and collecting points, but, but also just contributing to the like, overall collective intelligence of the network, improving these, these kind of applications, these protocols that are leveraging the network and then on the, on the sort of consumption side or the demand side of the network. Anyone who's building decentralized systems that especially pertain to finance or even gaming and these kind of like social apps can begin sort of, I guess molding these problems for this massive community of models running on the network to solve and start building on this kind of more.
00:30:58.507 - 00:31:03.019, Speaker B: Performance source of collective AI. There's a lot of models running on the network today.
00:31:03.067 - 00:31:17.729, Speaker A: There's I think been north of 100,000 workers as we call them and that's what we call people running models on the network, registered to the network, running models towards the optimization of these different problems. And so by thinking through, I guess.
00:31:17.777 - 00:31:20.673, Speaker B: Deliberately how to structure ML problems to.
00:31:20.729 - 00:31:35.305, Speaker A: Sort of point this massive source of model creator talent at, I think is like a really powerful first step in exploring this really new and expansive design space at the intersection of AI and crypto.
00:31:35.385 - 00:32:01.025, Speaker E: So Nick, to get 100,000 models already on the platform is, is pretty impressive. I'm just kind of curious. The underlying incentive mechanism and coordination mechanism to get people to do that work. I mean I know there's always really smart tinkerers that just like to do this stuff, but I'm guessing there's something more there that are drawing people in and just kind of curious like what that, what that is.
00:32:01.145 - 00:32:03.265, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a few things.
00:32:03.305 - 00:32:05.257, Speaker B: That I'm still developing my perspectives on.
00:32:05.281 - 00:32:19.277, Speaker A: This as well frankly. But with regard to like why people are showing up with net new models and running models on the network. But I think ultimately it boils down to there doesn't exist really like a.
00:32:19.461 - 00:32:22.989, Speaker B: Hyper efficient market for intelligence today across.
00:32:23.077 - 00:32:25.557, Speaker A: Like these domains that have had sort.
00:32:25.581 - 00:32:28.141, Speaker B: Of ML development over, over decades now.
00:32:28.173 - 00:33:10.537, Speaker A: Especially in these kind of financial domains. And so I think when you give people the opportunity to participate in a kind of like market environment where in the shortest amount of steps possible they can take a model and begin capturing value from that model, people will show up. People want market environments to sort of capture value from their efforts and capture value from their resources. So that's why, that's sort of the most fundamental or obvious reason for why people are participating in this network, especially on the supply side. And then with regard to kind of the incentive design of the system, this.
00:33:10.561 - 00:33:13.825, Speaker B: Is really the core mechanism and this is what we've spent a lot of.
00:33:13.865 - 00:33:28.645, Speaker A: Time thinking through and designing. This goes back to the very early days of upshot in building these kind of subjective consensus mechanisms. And it's in building an incentive mechanism that not only rewards kind of valuable.
00:33:28.725 - 00:33:31.629, Speaker B: Contributions, but uniquely valuable contributions.
00:33:31.717 - 00:33:40.789, Speaker A: So when people are running different models on the network, trying to optimize some, some problem. They're, they're being rewarded based on how.
00:33:40.837 - 00:33:43.325, Speaker B: Useful their output is relative to the.
00:33:43.365 - 00:33:53.943, Speaker A: Other outputs that are being contributed by other actors. So you take a bunch of inferences that are stitched together one by one, you remove each of these inferences and.
00:33:53.959 - 00:33:55.567, Speaker B: You see the difference it has on.
00:33:55.591 - 00:33:57.567, Speaker A: The sort of ultimate performance of that.
00:33:57.631 - 00:34:01.823, Speaker B: Collective output, and then that becomes this sort of unique contribution from one of.
00:34:01.839 - 00:34:05.879, Speaker A: The models or one of these workers running on the supply side of the network.
00:34:06.007 - 00:34:07.527, Speaker B: And so that's really the core of.
00:34:07.551 - 00:34:22.155, Speaker A: This incentive mechanism is people participating in this recurring competitive game to provide uniquely valuable AI outputs towards the optimization of different shared ML problems, essentially just as a side curiosity.
00:34:22.235 - 00:34:27.739, Speaker E: So right now, this value that you're talking about, are people actually getting paid in like USDC for their work?
00:34:27.867 - 00:34:31.643, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like this conceptual unit, account value points.
00:34:31.779 - 00:34:35.275, Speaker B: Right now they basically split up the fees as well as inflation of the.
00:34:35.315 - 00:34:37.803, Speaker A: Network fees being paid by these applications.
00:34:37.859 - 00:34:40.347, Speaker B: Or protocols, and then inflation of the network as well.
00:34:40.451 - 00:35:14.419, Speaker E: So, Nick, in talking to some of these early kind of crypto AI builders, a common thread has been this issue of AI verification, essentially being able to verify maybe a model that the system was trained on and just the overall verification of the inputs and the outputs. Like, how do we know what we're getting? Like, how do we know the source of what we're getting, if that makes sense? Is that an issue that ALORA is facing or is that something that you're thinking of or solving for?
00:35:14.507 - 00:35:25.511, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's less of an issue with ALORA because we sort of move from like this model centric paradigm to an objective centric paradigm. And so if you think about the.
00:35:25.543 - 00:35:27.431, Speaker B: Model centric paradigm, when you're building an.
00:35:27.463 - 00:35:32.327, Speaker A: Application, you're referencing a specific model, and because you're doing that, you need to.
00:35:32.351 - 00:35:34.751, Speaker B: Know that model is running as advertised.
00:35:34.783 - 00:35:41.415, Speaker A: You need to verify its execution, et cetera. But when you move to this kind of objective centric paradigm, you're sort of.
00:35:41.455 - 00:35:48.039, Speaker B: Anchored in the objective itself. And so who cares what models are running, what data they're taking into account, et cetera.
00:35:48.087 - 00:36:05.259, Speaker A: All that you care about is how well that collection of models performs as assessed by this objective. And so, like, that enables us not only to kind of avoid or lower the requirements for model verification on the network, but it even enables closed source.
00:36:05.307 - 00:36:11.635, Speaker B: Models to be compatible with the network. You don't have to be running open source models even. You can keep your models closed source.
00:36:11.675 - 00:36:25.107, Speaker A: You can keep them proprietary which is important especially in these kind of financial domains that the that were focused on initially. And so I think just as you don't need to know the logic different solvers are using in an intent based.
00:36:25.211 - 00:36:26.883, Speaker B: System, you don't need to know much.
00:36:26.939 - 00:36:34.587, Speaker A: About how the models are actually running when they're all being anchored and assessed based on these these kind of shared ML objectives.
00:36:34.771 - 00:37:08.481, Speaker C: Say hello to Puffer Unifi Puffer Finance is expanding beyond native liquid restaking with new products such as Unifi based rollup and UniFi pre confirmations AVs. UniFi is not just another L2. UniFi is a based rollup, one that will solve L2 issues such as slow withdrawals versus instant withdrawals. With Puffer Unifi. Puffer Unifi is fast capable of sub second transactions. Unifi also has boosted Puffer points, which means if you bridge assets you earn boosted Puffer points and rewards. From Dapps on Unifi.
00:37:08.481 - 00:37:17.035, Speaker C: Puffer's core products mean a bright future for Ethereum. Puffer Unify will launch in November 2024. Learn more at Puffer Fi.
00:37:19.575 - 00:38:29.583, Speaker E: Nick we're going to get to closing here soon, but I don't know if you've had a chance to play around with OpenAI's new Chat GPT. I think 01 model is what it's called, but it's this new the new voice assistant. It's like actually blowing my mind. I just used it to kind of plan a whole trip and my wife heard it for the first time and she was like that is like a hundred times better Siri and all of this stuff like I've witnessed the last couple years, this rapid pace of innovation is exciting and scary at the same time. And I guess like my question to you is like somebody you know even more behind the scenes working in this every day, like are we to expect this level of kind of rapid innovation to continue? Are we getting to any sort of theoretical limits? I actually saw Zuckerberg talking about this the other day and he's like, well with this transformer system architecture we can just keep adding GPUs and we keep getting better output from the model. So I don't know, maybe the answer is we're not even close, but kind of curious what somebody sitting in your chair is thinking.
00:38:29.679 - 00:38:41.135, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the rate of innovation, I agree, has been crazy and I think it continues to pick up like that. I think there's always going to be these, these sort of plateaus of like.
00:38:41.295 - 00:38:44.247, Speaker B: Optimal resource provisioning and different things.
00:38:44.311 - 00:38:53.591, Speaker A: Like the big innovation with the O1 model, in my opinion, is that it allows us to point compute at better.
00:38:53.663 - 00:38:56.407, Speaker B: Solving the problem of inference, not just training.
00:38:56.471 - 00:38:59.039, Speaker A: So now, like, you can throw more.
00:38:59.087 - 00:39:04.675, Speaker B: Compute at the inference step of running a model and it becomes smarter, it thinks more.
00:39:04.975 - 00:39:25.595, Speaker A: And that like, really expands the scope of sort of how expressive or powerful these models can be. And so I think we'll continue to hit these sort of plateaus of sort of resource provisioning or resource access. And I think as humans do, we'll continue to come up with unique or.
00:39:25.635 - 00:39:28.315, Speaker B: Insightful innovations to get around those.
00:39:28.395 - 00:39:34.627, Speaker A: I think we've maybe start to hit a plateau around like more data equals better models.
00:39:34.771 - 00:39:35.995, Speaker B: Now we need to solve the problem.
00:39:36.035 - 00:39:38.787, Speaker A: Of how do we get better data to build better models, how do we.
00:39:38.811 - 00:39:41.855, Speaker B: Build better models with less data but better data?
00:39:42.315 - 00:39:47.035, Speaker A: And so I think the rate of innovation will continue. It'll likely continue to increase in pace.
00:39:47.075 - 00:39:48.291, Speaker B: As it has as well.
00:39:48.403 - 00:40:30.991, Speaker A: And it's just going to be a matter of continuing to innovate on these kind of fundamental problems of how do we make do with the resources that are physically available or that are sort of viably available, what new model architectures are there, et cetera. And that's why I think decentralized AI is so powerful, is because markets are this great, like, like catalyst for innovation. Markets guide disparate, disparate actors to perform these different types of actions at a far faster pace than they could without the market environment to operate within. And so I think decentralized AI acts as this sort of jet fuel to the innovation that we see across the various layers of the AI stack.
00:40:31.103 - 00:41:09.759, Speaker D: I read somewhere that I think like close to $90 billion might be invested in AI just this year, 2024. We know with the ETFs being launched for Bitcoin and Ether, it's been a big year for institutional interest in crypto, but it still lags behind the amount of money that's being invested into AI. So what do you think of this, like, cross section then? Like, is there institutional interest there? I guess, like, if so, like, do you. Can you name any names that are like, really looking to invest more in this space space that you guys cover at Alora?
00:41:09.847 - 00:41:20.311, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there is like, I guess like a very intuitive response to like, where institutional interest is going to.
00:41:20.343 - 00:41:22.575, Speaker B: Come from, put the synergies of the.
00:41:22.615 - 00:41:37.247, Speaker A: Technologies aside and all of the kind of net new applications and primitives that one can build by bringing AI closer to crypto. What crypto does a Great job at is financializing different sectors and different categories.
00:41:37.431 - 00:41:39.855, Speaker B: And today there exists so much more.
00:41:39.935 - 00:41:50.009, Speaker A: Demand for AI exposure than there is supply for AI exposure. And because crypto has this much more expedited path to liquidity, I think we.
00:41:50.057 - 00:41:52.185, Speaker B: See the recipient of a lot of.
00:41:52.225 - 00:42:07.713, Speaker A: Those kind of broader demands for AI exposure flowing into kind of decentralized AI, acting as this further catalyst for decentralized AI or this crypto X AI intersection to progress. And so I think that's going to.
00:42:07.729 - 00:42:09.537, Speaker B: Be a really core driver, and it's.
00:42:09.561 - 00:42:23.285, Speaker A: Really core to the thesis of where a lot of the growth drivers for crypto xai come from is it gives people a source of supply for exposure that is otherwise inaccessible or less accessible.
00:42:23.365 - 00:43:11.279, Speaker D: So one final question. Given the leadership we've seen from like a Coinbase in this, in the crypto industry, I'm thinking about, like, how they've invested into DeFi. They've really leaned into, you know, a world that operates on chain. I think they could have been the Frankenstein crypto finance company. And instead of just being an exchange, being like everyone's sort of partner to getting on chain, they've again really leaned into this idea of building an L2 and, you know, giving us these on ramps and off ramps. And again, they aggressively invest into DEFI protocols. I'm thinking, do you think Coinbase ends up being like a leading AI company given their.
00:43:11.279 - 00:43:34.799, Speaker D: They're a leading crypto company? And I guess I asked this just because, like, you have, you know, you have a long track record in the space, like, you've, you've been through many of these ups and downs and. Yeah, I guess, like, what are your thoughts on someone like a Coinbase eventually being a leader in AI? Maybe they become a leader in AI because they're, they're leveraging Alora.
00:43:34.887 - 00:43:41.307, Speaker A: Yeah, I could see that for sure. I think, I think there will be a, like a far less clear line.
00:43:41.371 - 00:43:44.587, Speaker B: Between centralized AI and decentralized AI.
00:43:44.651 - 00:44:00.875, Speaker A: As, as decentralized AI progresses, they become more homogenous in nature. And so I think as Coinbase continues to sort of like, give the appropriate attention and resources to AI and AI's intersection with crypto, it.
00:44:00.995 - 00:44:03.595, Speaker B: It leads to being a prominent company.
00:44:03.635 - 00:44:10.587, Speaker A: In AI more generally. I tend to think like, these sort of two categories of AI today is.
00:44:10.651 - 00:44:12.475, Speaker B: A temporary one in that in the.
00:44:12.515 - 00:44:27.195, Speaker A: Centralized AI camp we have people seeing AI as a private good, and in decentralized AI, we see AI as more of a public utility. And I think we saw a similar thing play out in the early days of the Internet, where there were these.
00:44:27.235 - 00:44:29.539, Speaker B: Early attempts of private capture of the.
00:44:29.667 - 00:44:38.523, Speaker A: Internet to instantiate it as a private good, owned and run by kind of a single company. And then there is the Internet as a public utility.
00:44:38.579 - 00:44:40.347, Speaker B: And society has gotten to where it.
00:44:40.371 - 00:44:49.771, Speaker A: Is today because it leaned into the latter. And I think Coinbase especially has shown an understanding of the importance of building.
00:44:49.843 - 00:44:55.955, Speaker B: Decentralized Rails and decentralized platforms, going to where decentralization flourishes.
00:44:56.075 - 00:45:04.585, Speaker A: And I would think, and I would hope that a similar thing plays out as they get deeper into the kind of AI and crypto AI space as well.
00:45:04.665 - 00:45:13.153, Speaker E: Nick, can you give us kind of like a state of where Alora is at in development right now? Any kind of timelines or roadmaps you.
00:45:13.169 - 00:45:14.033, Speaker D: Can share with us?
00:45:14.129 - 00:45:37.813, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So Alora is basically in the final stage of its test right now. So the next step is mainnet and that should be happening quite soon. There's some final touches being placed on sort of the initial versions of the network that'll go live with mainnet. And then beyond mainnet we have a bunch of development around expanding the sort of expressiveness of the network into sort.
00:45:37.829 - 00:45:40.005, Speaker B: Of the complete universe of different ML.
00:45:40.085 - 00:45:53.261, Speaker A: Problems that one could coordinate different models around addressing the kind of, I guess like expressiveness or the versatility of the network beyond kind of this focus on DEFI and DEFI adjacent use cases today.
00:45:53.373 - 00:46:28.185, Speaker D: Very cool. Well guys, I think this is a great place for us to wrap up, so I want to remind our listeners that they can learn more by going to alora.network. they should follow Alora Labs HQ on Twitter. They should follow Alora Network. So both those handles, aluralabs HQ is probably a great place to to potentially be looking for a job if you want to work with Nick in the future. And then I'd also recommend you follow Nick's Twitter x handle @nickemmons. Nick, thanks so much for coming on the show.
00:46:28.185 - 00:46:50.363, Speaker D: We really appreciate you talking through just some like really deep, difficult questions to answer, but I think it gave us a peek into what the future looks like here and again, just really excited for what you guys are building. But any final word for us, like any recommended like follow up or call to action and like I said, hopefully you can come back on the show in the future when all of this is fully live.
00:46:50.459 - 00:47:11.787, Speaker A: Yeah, no, thanks for having me. This was a lot of fun. For anyone who wants to get involved and participate in the network, I think jumping into the Discord is probably the best place. That's where a lot of the Alora Labs team hangs out as well as the broader community. And then anyone who's interested in, I guess, running models on the network can get started kind of from there, through the docs, et cetera.
00:47:11.931 - 00:47:29.435, Speaker C: Thanks everyone for tuning in.
