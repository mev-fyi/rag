00:00:00.570 - 00:00:05.294, Speaker A: All right, well, we should be live here in a second. All right.
00:00:05.332 - 00:00:06.960, Speaker B: Should I retweet as well?
00:00:07.570 - 00:00:22.458, Speaker A: Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, actually, go right ahead. It'll take me a second. I'm going to introduce you. So, hey, if you're just tuning in, this is DFI talks with DFI dad. It is Thursday, August 5, 2021. Today we're going to talk with the legendary Jason Choi.
00:00:22.458 - 00:01:08.260, Speaker A: So Jason is the creator and, and host of the Blockcrunch podcast. He has also worked at the Spartan group for years, so they invest in some of the leading teams in DeFi and the greater crypto landscape. And, yeah, we're just excited to sort of turn the tables around here and get to ask you, Jason, about your insights and experiences in the crypto space. So if you haven't checked out the blockcrunch podcast, please do that. He's interviewed all of the biggest names in terms of investors and builders, and I can attest I have personally learned so much from the podcast. So, Jason, welcome to the show. How are you doing?
00:01:08.630 - 00:01:12.242, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. I'm excited for awesome.
00:01:12.376 - 00:01:56.900, Speaker A: Awesome. And I think one of our goals today, I was kind of prepping Jason yesterday with, I want to try to ask him questions that he doesn't normally get asked. I think one of my concerns has been that with the content that we all create to educate and inform people about Defi and crypto, I worry about falling into the trap of just talking about the same things over and over again. So we'll see how well I do. But, Jason, let's start with the usual. Can you give a little bit of background, know just who you are? And I'd love to kind of learn about what you were doing before crypto and then some of the highlights over the last few years.
00:01:57.430 - 00:02:18.390, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So my path into crypto is very winding. I actually started as an english major back in college. I want to be a novelist, want to be a writer, and that was really my only skill. But when I went to the United States, I found out about what startups are, and I thought, wow, this is really interesting. This is not a thing in Hong Kong. There's no tech scene here at all.
00:02:18.390 - 00:03:03.830, Speaker B: And I thought, wow, this is something that I really want to do. And then I found out that there's a job called VCs, venture capitalists that basically just spent all days talking to some of the smartest folks in startups, some of the most kind of inspiring guys, and some of the most inspiring founders. And I decided, hey, that's something that I really want to explore, and my way into it was to interview random founders and write articles about them for different blogs. So that kind of, over the years, I guess, translated into what I'm doing now, which is a podcast where I interview different founders in crypto and also investors in crypto. And through that, I also met a lot of different people in the space, and one of those people is my current partner, Kelvin, at the spartan capital, where we invest in crypto founders. So we've been doing that since 2018.
00:03:04.650 - 00:03:18.860, Speaker A: Awesome. And I guess, could you tell us more about what have you all been focused on lately in terms of what sorts of use cases, I'd say, are you seeking to invest in through the spartan group?
00:03:19.470 - 00:03:43.054, Speaker B: Yeah. So the spartan group has two separate businesses. We started in 2017 as an advisory shop, so that's mostly helping with fundraising or kind of m and a transactions. So you might have seen things like the portfolio sale or the derabit sale. So that was Spartan Group's advisory arm. And then we have a separate business, which I focus on, which is the investment arm. So for that business, we have two separate funds.
00:03:43.054 - 00:04:11.930, Speaker B: So one is a liquid hedge fund. So we basically focus on anything from short to medium term investments in that fund. And then I think two years into that, we decided, hey, we're seeing so many interesting things in DFI. Most of our attention, 90% of our attention, is given in DFI. And we wanted to take a longer view things, longer term view on things. So we decided to kind of start this separate fund, which is the new fund we have, which is a venture fund with a five year horizon. So we don't trade out of that.
00:04:11.930 - 00:04:23.460, Speaker B: It's purely just finding founders in DeFi as early as possible and then working with them in the early days of the project, and then basically helping them through the entirety of the fund, which is five years plus.
00:04:25.110 - 00:04:53.100, Speaker A: So I want to actually go back to some of the basics here, just around your background investing in the crypto space. So I think for any of us who have been around for just a few years, we can attest investing is hard, and yet everyone wants to be an investor. Have you ever thought about, why is that? Why is it something that everybody seemingly wants to jump into in the crypto space?
00:04:53.550 - 00:05:43.414, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I don't know. I can't speak for everyone, but for myself, I think my interest in investing is mostly on the intellectual side. I think it's one of the more challenging things you can do, especially in crypto, where you blend elements of venture and also secondary markets, kind of public markets, where you have to not just care about what the market is thinking, market structure and all that, but you also have to really know the projects inside out and understand the fundamentals. So it's a continual learning process, and that kind of perpetual pursuit is really appealing to me. But I do think that most people, or at least a lot of people, want to invest in crypto because of the gains they've seen, right? They've seen their friends get rich off crypto assets and they decided, hey, this is something that maybe I should get into as well. And that ends up actually being a pretty good gateway drug for a lot of people to fall down the crypto rabbit hole.
00:05:43.414 - 00:05:57.870, Speaker B: But in general, I think for crypto investing, I think a lot of people only see the success stories. They see these insane appreciations in prices and decide, hey, this is something that's interesting, and that's how they start to want to become investors, I suppose.
00:05:58.210 - 00:06:08.690, Speaker A: I guess then to follow up to that, do you think that investing in crypto is harder or easier than investing in, let's just call it the traditional markets?
00:06:09.590 - 00:07:08.550, Speaker B: Yeah, that's harder to answer because it really depends on what aspect of investing you're optimizing for and your risk appetite as well. So if you're a young guy, you're a retail investor, and you want to make as much money as possible and take on as much risk as possible, you don't really care about volatility. Then obviously you'll be drawn to more speculative asset classes, and crypto could be one of those versus, say, if you just invest your savings in like an S and P 500 index. But in terms of analysis, in terms of consensus around valuation methodologies, in terms of the tooling that you have to actually express your different views in the markets, crypto is still incredibly immature. It's maturing really quickly, but compared to traditional financial markets, it's still a relatively new phenomenon. The regulations are still being hammered out and there's no single consensus on how these assets are even valued in the first place. So in that perspective, it's a little bit harder.
00:07:09.770 - 00:08:04.550, Speaker A: I'm curious, what do you think needs to happen in order for it to mature? You just mentioned regulation is one of those. And for better or worse, we're living through a pretty tumultuous time right now with the US Congress and regulators weighing in on how to tax all sorts of different entities in DeFi or just the greater crypto landscape. So that's been a little bit. If anyone's listening to this in the future. We've been living through this infrastructure bill where they're trying to come up with ways to generate revenue in the US. So, anyways, that's been frustrating to say the least. Jason, though, what else do you think needs to happen in order for our asset class here to be considered more mature?
00:08:05.290 - 00:08:42.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of it is also investor education. If you look at traditional equities, the frameworks around valuations were not widely adopted until the publication of security analysis back in the 1930s. So a lot of people may look at traditional markets and they have this kind of preconceived notion that, hey, all of this is really established already from day one. People already know how to build these discounted cash flow models. They know how to value different equities based on different multiples. But that's not always the case. It only became the case after investor education happened, and after these frameworks started becoming more popularized.
00:08:42.110 - 00:09:15.630, Speaker B: And I think that needs to happen in crypto as well. So I actually recently interviewed my friend Arthur, who runs Defiance Capital, and that's one of the things that he focuses on a lot as well, is kind of talking about fundamental investing, how he thinks about valuations for different DeFi assets. And that's why the way that we think is very similar, because we're trying to apply repealable frameworks to thinking about these assets, and frameworks that speak to traditional investors as well. But it's going to take time, but it's happening conversation by conversation.
00:09:16.610 - 00:09:30.980, Speaker A: Maybe then we should talk about the role of capital allocators in this space. So maybe you could talk about a day in the life of working at Spartan Group, and how do you work with your portfolio companies?
00:09:32.070 - 00:10:00.086, Speaker B: Yeah, so, because we're such a small team, up until recently, it was just me and my partner, Kelvin, and we have a support team as well. But the investment team was really just the two of us. And then we brought on a few more people over the past twelve months. So now we're a 5% investment team. In terms of the day to day, it really depends. So, usually I kind of start a day just by screening through what happened overnight, just given we're 24/7 market. So it's important to stay up to date and then usually just responding to messages.
00:10:00.086 - 00:10:34.520, Speaker B: Recently, man, we've invested in so many companies that all of these companies, especially the ones that are earlier on in their life cycles, that are trying to race new rounds, or trying to get listed, or trying to ship new products, they're always looking for feedback, connections and so on. So it's a lot of responding to founder requests on a day to day basis. And obviously I also spend a lot of time researching. So just reading a lot of the latest reports, a lot of the latest research, a lot of the latest white papers, and testing out products as well. So it is very diverse day. Not a single day looks the same.
00:10:35.610 - 00:11:23.000, Speaker A: Maybe you can break down what's happened lately with. So Sushiswap has looked to diversify their treasury, which essentially means for anyone who's new to this, it just means that they're going to sell some of this sushi to strategic partners. The goal, of course, is to bring on vocal, I would say, active partners who are going to help grow sushi swap. But anyways, can you talk about, I guess, what has happened lately with this and then what has it sort of revealed to us about how the greater community views funds? And I guess I'd love to know what needs correcting, what's true? What do you disagree with?
00:11:23.530 - 00:11:47.934, Speaker B: Yeah, this is one of the more interesting things that happened lately because it is governance in broad daylight. Right. There was so much engagement in that forum. So just take a step back here. What happened was sushi, which initially started as a fork of Uniswap and has since evolved into its own product. It's currently the second largest decentralized exchange. They decided to diversify the treasury and raise up to $60 million.
00:11:47.934 - 00:12:47.934, Speaker B: So they compiled a list of investors that they think are value add investors or investors that have been in D five for a while, and then proposed it as a plan to the community on the forum that, hey, we're going to raise 60 million. We're going to raise it from these guys. These are the terms, and this is why we think we should raise from them. And I think the response from the community on the forum was surprising to everyone, including the sushi team, which is a lot of people thinking that, hey, these VCs should not be getting preferential terms versus any other community members, because as part of the round, vcs were offered a 30% discount to the 30 day twap. So, yeah, I think to a certain extent it's not too surprising because Sushi did start as a project that's almost anti VC in its DNA, right? It started as the no VC version of Uniswap. So it's not a surprise that people are defensive over those principles and ideologies. So it's still an ongoing conversation.
00:12:47.934 - 00:13:24.560, Speaker B: In that process, other funds started to chime in and propose different structures. Arca came in with a proposal to kind of restructure the deal and basically offer the same terms to a public kind of tranche as well for retail investors, and remove the discount for venture investors, which the lead investors have agreed to so far. And then after that, we also explored, actually, the UMA team proposed this really interesting concept, which is essentially a call option on the sushi token. But it's still very much a conversation that's still going on on the forum. I think it went a little bit quiet since Paris. Everybody went to Paris, but now I think it's going to start picking up again.
00:13:26.210 - 00:15:08.480, Speaker A: I'm thinking about what needs to happen in order for a future to be realized where anyone can participate in these early rounds, seed rounds, precede rounds. And I think one of the solutions we know of is just moving to on chain dows, being able to invest purely on chain and be able to forego this legacy infrastructure. And I'm at fourth Revolution capital, and we're abiding by all the same sorts of regulations and rules here in the US. But I think the funny thing is, I think my lifelong mission here is to nuke this system. I think that we need to be able to allow someone to be able to invest with any amount of money and to be able to get exposure early. However, that being said, I don't mean to disregard the fact that there's a lot of folks like you and others that I respect that are working very hard to fund the best teams to enable them to grow in a world that really doesn't fully understand defi yet. So I guess, how do you compromise or bring together these two different worlds? Again, we're running a fund in the legacy world, but ironically, investing in a world that probably would make funds like spartan group and fourth revolution obsolete in the future.
00:15:08.480 - 00:15:17.010, Speaker A: Unless we adapt to being on chain dows, or whatever you want to call it, syndicates of investors that coordinate on chain.
00:15:17.670 - 00:16:13.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a great question, and I think it really comes down to what a fund actually is. Right. I think people in crypto tend to have a skewed perception of VCs, and they kind of see them as vultures. And I think a lot of that is justified, because if you look at some of the funds that are back in 2017, a lot of these funds basically provided zero value, and they got into these private rounds that were like 80% discount and then 50% and then 30% before it even lists on public. So once they get liquidity, they dump the tokens and a lot of retailers get hurt. So a lot of retailers kind of recognize that in 2017, and I'm not going to name any funds, but I think anyone who has been in the space since that time, or can name all of these funds with one hand and a lot of those bad actors kind of damage the perception of VCs in the space. Whereas this cycle around, you start to see really tier one investors that are less capital allocators, more like service providers.
00:16:13.650 - 00:17:10.134, Speaker B: I think taking a step back here, I do think that making the playing field level for everybody so that everybody can have access the same opportunities in crypto is very important, especially because of the ethos of what crypto is, which is open opportunities for everyone. But at the same time, it's also a free market. Projects should be free to choose to give certain terms to certain community members that provide maybe disproportionately more value per dollar contributed than other community members. So it could be a venture fund, it could be an angel, it could be a whale, it could be anybody. But I think the categorization that vcs versus the people, that's almost a false dichotomy. To your second question, in terms of investing in things that disrupt us, I totally agree. I think the way that funds will look in crypto, at least the funds that survive will be very different in five to ten years.
00:17:10.134 - 00:17:56.050, Speaker B: And we already starting to see that where funds look more like service providers, certain funds have an entire research team. They don't focus on investments, they just do kind of research and simulations. And for us, we're going to bring on board more portfolio support folks whose sole goal is to basically help with the BD side of things. So almost like an outsourced BD team for different projects. And the way I guess we think about it is the discounts that VCs get in private rounds is not just to account for the risk that these projects may never ship. And number two, also as a payment for the services rendered. So, yeah, I think vcs basically have to invest in these massive cost centers to support the companies to invest in, otherwise they won't be able to survive in the long term.
00:17:56.210 - 00:19:41.990, Speaker A: Yeah, it almost feels like what we think of as a VC is turning more into like an agency. It's like an agency of product experts, marketing experts, obviously. I think what has been known for longer is like weighing in on that strategy of how you go to market, whether or not, of course, you're developing the right product and with the right sort of timing to it. And actually, I guess that's more of a focus on funds that are investing earlier there's something too to be said, though, about I was listening to your podcast with Arthur from Defiance, and I have always been struck by the fact that Arthur talks about how he jumped on board with he. This is like Aave previously ETH lend, you know, had launched like years earlier, and so he was just watching as a part of the Defi community and he saw them growing and then jumped on board. And I believe, I'm not sure since then what's happened, but I'm pretty certain he just market bought Ave around that time, which I think my takeaway from it was just the patience to observe what's going on in this very nascent space and not to FOMO apply what I would call like a spray and pray thesis, where it's just, we need to get in early. This is a low valuation.
00:19:41.990 - 00:20:57.440, Speaker A: This is a great opportunity that everything is going to go up, which I think no one will admit to, but I think there's actually a lot more in the space that are thinking that way at this point, and that's not healthy. That will definitely lead to a bubble eventually. But yeah, anyways, that really struck me about that difference in working with the early seed stage teams versus maybe some future opportunities that we'll see with other teams in DeFi where they need a few more years for the market to catch up with them. There's definitely a number of applications and infrastructure that's being developed. Actually, another one. I have no exposure to the graph. I wish I did, but the graph struggled, I thought, to raise money years ago, and then obviously it took some time, but with all of the DeFi applications growing and exploding with usage, suddenly the graph became a very valuable tool and it became super obvious, sort of like later in the game.
00:20:59.250 - 00:21:31.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely hear you on that. And yeah, I guess on that note, that interview with Arthur was great and he was the one who kind of told me to look into Ave back when it was Ethland, and we ended up also buying on exchange at about, I think, 80 million valuation. And today it's like 5 billion valuation. And there were a lot of opportunities like that in DFI. Most of our biggest wins were things that we just bought an exchange. So there are opportunities if you apply a certain discipline to it. So, yeah, I'm excited.
00:21:33.470 - 00:22:19.110, Speaker A: Here's, I think, a harder question, but much simpler than the topics we're diving into. So you've interviewed tons and tons of investors and builders, and I am curious, among the investors, who do you think stands out as the best? If you had to pick one. Let's pretend we're, like, drafting like a fantasy team of investors. Actually, you know what? It's an unfair question to choose one because honestly, it's just such a subjective. There's no, like one plus one equals two here. But yeah, if you had to draft a fantasy team, who comes to mind in terms of those that are crypto defi investors?
00:22:19.770 - 00:23:05.302, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, there are actually a lot that I would love to work with, even for people I haven't brought in the show yet, and I'm trying to get them on. But if we're just choosing from that roster of people who have been on the show, man, there's so many. Just because NFTs are taken off recently, I think one of the most insightful people and one of those most precise people when it comes to NFT is Richard Chen from one confirmation. So he's the one that covered a lot of my views and made me more open minded about, and we talk about it almost every day on Telegram. And he kind of made fun of me as the NFT bear. And obviously I was completely wrong on that in terms of the ability of digital collectibles to accrue value.
00:23:05.302 - 00:23:33.998, Speaker B: So the frameworks that he used to think about them, I think are very interesting. And we did an episode with him and his partner Nick Tomano as well. So always definitely open for an opportunity to work with either of them. I also really enjoy, I think I've brought Tom Schmidt from Dragonfly on the show more than a few times to talk about different topics. He's one of the more insightful people in defi as well, having been a builder before for Zero X before becoming an investor. So he's very deep into the weeds. Incredibly technical as well.
00:23:33.998 - 00:23:58.038, Speaker B: Yeah. So folks like that are definitely keen to work with them, but pretty much anyone that I've brought onto the show, I brought them on because I felt like there's a lot to learn from them, and I almost always end up being right that, okay, I did learn a lot, even in this hour long conversation. So I would jump at the chance to work with anybody who came on the show before. But yeah, those are just two names off the top of my head.
00:23:58.204 - 00:24:30.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel good about. Those are two in particular that were top of mind for me. And I've gotten to know them more over the last year. And yeah, they just have so much conviction and so much reasoning to back the way that they look at the world right now. So, yeah, for what it's worth, if anyone's a builder out there, I can't say enough good things about Richard at one confirmation and Tom at Dragonfly. How about we talk more about.
00:24:33.990 - 00:24:34.414, Speaker B: Geez.
00:24:34.462 - 00:25:30.690, Speaker A: Where was I going with that? Oh, I'm sorry. I know my follow up was I wanted to know. So we were talking about investors there. Can you hone in on more about what makes a great investor in 2021 in the crypto DFI landscape? To give a very quick example, if someone's asking me this, I'm telling everyone, if you are an investor in this space, you have to be a user. You have to be very comfortable trying those new products. And it's not just even trying them. It's like you have to be like a daily user of these applications because you will never understand the mindset of the community and the users that you're hoping will adopt this unless you are actually living in their shoes regularly.
00:25:30.690 - 00:26:14.846, Speaker A: And I think that's a shift from what I understood working in Silicon Valley for a number of years and just seeing lots of VCs that, I'm not criticizing them, but many of them were just cutting checks, and they did a lot of due diligence. Many of them, too. They have their own sort of method to the madness of how they would invest. But I would say it was a common joke that you would show up to a pitch and they hadn't even looked at the website or even tried the application. So that was web two, this with DFI, web3. I would expect anyone to have played around or tried an application. So anyways.
00:26:14.878 - 00:26:15.026, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:15.048 - 00:26:16.500, Speaker A: How do you think about this?
00:26:17.190 - 00:27:12.994, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess it depends on your mandate or your strategy, right? I think it's very different to operate on a day to day or even week to week time frame as a trader or medium term investor versus, say, a venture investor with a 510 year horizon. But I think the unifying theme across both of these strategies is the ability to be early and to be right. So you almost always want to be contrarian. So when we started investing in 2018 into DFI, the only thing that had any type of real traction was probably maker Dow compound, and Ave had some traction, but nowhere near the levels it is today. So that was when DFI was all trading under maybe 100 million valuation, maybe 50 million valuation. Today they're all in the billions. So the ability to kind of invest when nobody else is investing in that vertical, I think is probably the most reliable source of edge.
00:27:12.994 - 00:27:58.120, Speaker B: And to have that, you need to have a certain understanding of crypto. You can't just be chasing after the next hot thing or the latest thing that people are shilling on Twitter. So that's why we try to stay away from hot trends. We try to invest in where we think people will actually go to things people will actually use in the longer term. And I guess it all comes down to having conviction on a very clear long term thesis. And again, to kind of develop that, you just need to be really knowledgeable about what the products are out there today and continually try to draw lessons from different verticals as well. So one thing I've been reading up more on is, like, fintech outside of crypto, just to kind of borrow lessons from different industries and see if there's any historical parallels we can draw.
00:27:59.450 - 00:28:44.740, Speaker A: On that note, where do you think the puck is going in our space? I would say a common talking .6 months ago, but now I think is sort of universally talked about, is that DeFi is prime for derivatives type platforms or just any sort of derivative that is native to DeFi. There's a lot of excitement about that, that it's a use case, that it runs parallel to adoption, that we know in traditional finance. And we know that, again, this is something that hasn't really been realized yet in the DeFi space. But curious, what else do you think is next?
00:28:45.670 - 00:29:40.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the way my mental framework for DeFi is almost, you see three waves, right? So the first wave is the crypto natives. These are the DGens and the speculators, the yield farmers, the people who are very native to crypto, who know how to interact with smart contracts, they know how to use the metamask, they know how to set the optimal gas, and all these very crypto native things that the mainstream audience probably doesn't care about or doesn't know about. And then this year, you start to see the second wave, which is not just crypto natives, but digital natives. So these are the artists, the musicians, the collectors, and a lot of them are brought in because of NFTs. And through NFTs, I think they start to get interested in other aspects of crypto, and maybe that brings them into defi as well. And then the final wave, which I think is the hardest one to break into, is the mainstream audience. And you start to see some projects that are doing kind of pseudo CDFI.
00:29:40.674 - 00:30:24.690, Speaker B: I know that's kind of a meme at this point, but there are projects that are relying on centralized finance distribution channels to connect mainstream audiences with crypto capital. So one of my favorite examples of this is a project called Goldfinch, which I personally invested in. So they're almost like an on chain credit fund where crypto natives like ourselves, we can deploy USDC into a pool, and they will take this pool and distribute it to lenders in emerging economies. So they will distribute the microfinance loans to kind of local economies. So that's a perfect example of crypto nativity bridging with centralized fintech that kind of connects the best of both world. I think that's where the space is going to be headed. That's where the really market expansionary verticals are.
00:30:24.690 - 00:30:39.418, Speaker B: But that's also much harder than building a uniswap fork right now or building another compound fork. So I think that's where the next 510 years will take us, and that's where we're kind of focusing more on with this five year fund as well.
00:30:39.584 - 00:32:00.478, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think as much as I want this radical future of everything is powered by defi, my time horizon is long here. I envision by the end of my lifetime that I'll look back and say, holy cow, remember when? And so, yeah, I think one of the keys to success for us over the coming years is being reasonable about what progress we can make. And if you can see a hybrid of what is decentralized finance protocols working together with centralized entities, that's an improvement. I still do believe the more open, permissionless, what is truly Defi, the way that I define Defi, I think that's the future, and I think it's going to grow more rapidly. The problem is just we're still dealing with issues of wallets, self custody in particular. That puts a lot of pressure on the average person. And that's why I think what you've just described makes a lot of sense to me, that I don't want to force self custody.
00:32:00.478 - 00:33:50.440, Speaker A: In fact, I really feel like if I have a conversation with someone about DeFi, as you're sort of like navigating their background and experience in finance, and whether they might be interested to learn more about DeFi. If self custody is like a fork in the road, if they're like, absolutely not, I would never trust myself no matter what you show me and teach me, even if you abstract away the seed phrase, the way that an arjit wallet has done, I think it's better to just understand where people are in their journey learning about this technology and don't force it on them. So maybe this moves us into a more macro conversation, like, let's really zoom out now, have you bought into a future where it's maybe very similar to ready player one? Do you believe that the metaverse is where we'll all be working. I'm curious to zoom out on how you envision the world and whether this is the future of it's not just remote work that we're going to move into working in that metaverse, because if so, Defi makes a hell of a lot more sense to those of us who see that. I think that DeFi is still an alternative finance system, but if your home, if you consider your community and your livelihood to be in the metaverse, well, then you need digitally scarce peer to peer finance. So anyways, can you talk to me about some of your views on how you see that world playing out the next 10, 20, 30 years?
00:33:51.130 - 00:34:46.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I always struggle to answer the question about metaverses because I don't really know what it refers to, because I feel like depending on who I talk to, there's a huge spectrum, right? Some people think it's going to be the totally virtual reality, kind of ready, pair run type world. Some people think the metaverse is already here. So in my mind, especially in the past two years with COVID happening right now, most of my social interactions have been completely virtual like this. And most of the people I talk to daily are virtual as well. So an increasingly large part of our lives are already being spent online, and we already start to see kind of physical societal structures being replicated in online communities as well. And it makes sense for there to be digitally native ways to transact just as we have cash in the physical world. So I do think we will replicate a lot of social experiences that we have in a virtual setting.
00:34:46.914 - 00:35:22.820, Speaker B: But as to whether that leads to an actual kind of ready player, one type of VR world, I don't know if we're going to go there. I definitely see the possibility of something like that happening. I just don't know if it's going to be to the extent that ready player one is where everybody just lives on the VR world, I think that's a little bit extreme. But yeah, I think I'm directionally bullish about the formation of digital communities. And I guess a corollary to that would be dows defi nfts as well. But in terms of the exact form that that takes, I try not to kind of predict because I know I'm going to be wrong.
00:35:23.430 - 00:36:08.770, Speaker A: Okay, so within the limited understanding that we might have about this future 10, 20, 30 years, I'm curious. There was a thesis over the last few years. I'd say during the bear market, there was a very vocal community around, like bitcoin will be the only chain. I mean, it still exists today. It's a bitcoin maximalist sort of community. But then there's also an opposing take that really, I would say it goes back to many years ago as well. Like probably 2016, 2017, especially as Ethereum was starting to grow, that there would be this universe of many chains.
00:36:08.770 - 00:36:18.082, Speaker A: What's your latest thinking on this? Do you see a universe of many chains? Do you see a universe of a few chains?
00:36:18.146 - 00:36:18.710, Speaker B: Or.
00:36:18.860 - 00:36:47.040, Speaker A: I'll be honest, I just don't know. I have a hard time envisioning that multiple chains won't succeed because I've already witnessed adoption in DeFi across multiple chains, and a demand to be able to move assets back and forth and even start to intermix single DeFi applications that have actions that cross between different chains. So anyways, how do you think about it?
00:36:47.410 - 00:37:33.402, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it would be actually harder to argue against a multi chain future at this point, just given empirically what we've seen this past year. Right. And I think a lot of the crypto native priorities and wants are very different from, say, your everyday retail non crypto native. And we kind of saw that in DeFi summer or at least in the past six months or so, where you saw a lot of activity on binance, smart chain or polygon. And these people who put a significant amount of capital there, their main priority is to get access to the same opportunities that the ethereum community has in Defi, but at a cheaper cost. They don't necessarily care too much about the security of the bridges, they don't necessarily care about how centralized the chains it. They just want to use these services at a lower fees.
00:37:33.402 - 00:38:28.666, Speaker B: So it's clear to me that these may be more centralized chains that offer lower fees. They seem to have found a market niche with a more mainstream retail audience. Whether they're able to kind of retain that user base over the long term, beyond just kind of speculative short term farms, remains to be seen, but I'm pretty confident that different chains will emerge to cater to different profiles of people. And one of those chains currently seems like it could be Solana, where there are a lot of very trading focused projects, more sophisticated financial products being built on top. So maybe Solana could end up being the chain where the sophisticated traders go. So, yeah, I think it will be, actually, yeah, it'll be harder to argue against multi chain future than it was back in 2018, when it was not that clear, when it seemed like all the ICO Ethereum killers were going to die.
00:38:28.858 - 00:39:31.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I can speak personally to the fact that I was only on Ethereum. I would say the majority of my assets are still on Ethereum. And also worth clarifying that I'm like 95% on chain, so I'm living like d five first life at this point. And I started to use some applications on polygon. I have really enjoyed using anchor protocol on terra. And I would say once I popped this bubble of just trying some new applications on different chains, I was like, whoa, I won't go down the rabbit hole of my concerns and worries about, well, how decentralized and secure is this? I've sort of sized what I'm willing to risk outside of Ethereum, feeling that my assets are most secure there. And also bitcoin too, as well.
00:39:31.890 - 00:40:57.440, Speaker A: I hold a little bit of bitcoin. Anyways, I think about that mental hurdle that I went through personally and then talking to users. It just seems like everyone lives through the same journey of, you can't knock it till you try it. And once you try it, you're like, all right, if I could move my assets frictionlessly between different blockchains, or even abstract away the need to understand that I'm moving between different blockchains, wouldn't I be using applications that are returning me the best yield or giving me the best user experience? So, yeah, I couldn't agree more. Okay, one last question. In terms of the greater Sci-Fi future that I'm trying to envision, have you dug into bology? Has this biology of earn originally and the former CTO of Coinbase, if anyone's not familiar with him, he's the bology. Have you heard his take on basically moving towards a digital First Nation? And I guess my question to you is, do you envision these sorts of digital First nations in the.
00:40:57.440 - 00:41:41.130, Speaker A: You're in, I think, Hong Kong, I'm in the United States. And I can attest that I feel like a greater commonality with you and others that I know across the globe. In many cases, I don't even know where they are. But it's because of the fact that we transact, let's say, in defi, and we live in a digital world here where we're able to talk on a live stream or interview. I'm curious, how bullish are you on the idea of sovereign nations, that idea of borders actually dissolving and us moving towards some digital First nations?
00:41:42.430 - 00:41:54.530, Speaker B: I'm actually not familiar with that concept that you came up with. So is he referring to legally, the borders are going to fall and we're going to form actual internationally recognized sovereignty that are digital.
00:41:55.030 - 00:43:10.858, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's more of a focus on how will digital First Nation not evolve or come to fruition, probably less about will the borders between countries actually fall. And part of that narrative, I think that he points out, is just that we have a monetary or a financial system that's in development that's obviously been battle tested. Now, if you talk about bitcoin, has been battle tested for over ten years, and hopefully DFI and Ethereum, we can say the same thing in ten years. It's that idea that if we move towards a world where it is accessible for more people to connect through the metaverse, that we would also then start to actually, what do I want to say? Create digital First nations. So honestly, you can see something like a Solana nation or a nation of Ethereum, something like that. But yeah. Anyways, any thoughts on that? I guess it's something.
00:43:10.858 - 00:43:17.690, Speaker A: I'll share a link with you afterwards. We talked about it on the bankless podcast. He did a really awesome episode.
00:43:18.910 - 00:43:44.082, Speaker B: In my mind, what separates nation states is two things, right? The local economy, and by extension, maybe the local currency, if they have one. And number two is the military. So I guess for digital nations to occur, you don't really need a military because it's all virtual. You can be anonymous. There's no threat of violence if you're anonymous. And we already have the means to transact and create an economy that's completely digital. So in my mind, there's prerequisites for that.
00:43:44.082 - 00:44:19.642, Speaker B: And I think it could happen. I don't know if it's going to be as radical as an actual nation that's recognized by the UN. But I think we're seeing proto digital nations where you have these communities and these Daos that just congregate very easily, really frictionlessly, based on common interests. Right? And one very small example of that is pleaserdao. It's literally just a bunch of guys that got interested in the same NFT and they formed a community based on that, and they have their own kind of governance and all that. I thought that was really interesting, and I won't be surprised if that happens in a larger scale, not just overcoming interest, but maybe common philosophy.
00:44:19.706 - 00:44:20.478, Speaker A: Great example.
00:44:20.644 - 00:44:22.078, Speaker B: Ideologies, right?
00:44:22.244 - 00:44:43.190, Speaker A: Absolutely. No, great example. I know we should wrap up here soon, so why don't we end on. Let's take it back to the day to day of the teams that you invest in. I guess, what are you looking for in the next great DeFi team, or DeFi founder.
00:44:44.330 - 00:45:19.842, Speaker B: Yeah. So it sounds cliche, but we really care about the conviction and the motivation of the founder. So sometimes I speak to people who are starting projects. We ask them, hey, why are you starting this? And a lot of the times, I wouldn't say a lot of the times, but sometimes we can answer, hey, we think there's a lot of money to be made in crypto. We want to generate a lot of money for ourselves. That's usually a really bad motivation. So I care much less about the first product, because the successful, like, if you look at most successful products in Defi, like Aave Synthetics, they pivoted from something else before.
00:45:19.842 - 00:45:42.474, Speaker B: Right. Synthetics from Haven Ave, from Ethland. So I don't really care about the first version of the product. I care a lot more about the founder and what drives them. I want to make sure that, I want to know that they're going to be here during the bear market to grind it out, to build things, to try things until they work. So it's less so of a quantitative checkbox that we look at. We say, hey, these things check off.
00:45:42.474 - 00:45:54.046, Speaker B: We're going to invest. It's more our relationship that we're able to develop with the founder and where we think their motivation lies. I think that's absolutely paramount, and that's absolutely number one for.
00:45:54.228 - 00:46:35.674, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I could definitely give an example of that sort of a founder. I think Kane at Synthetix. At this point, in full disclosure, I hold SNX. I've staked SNX for a few years now. At this point, I'm convinced that this guy goes down with the ship no matter what. But I don't believe the ship is going down. Aside from, I think, my excitement about what they're bringing to market in terms of utility and defi, I would say at this point, it's been more of a bet for me personally on just.
00:46:35.674 - 00:47:01.780, Speaker A: I absolutely believe he has the right sort of motivations, and he's just been a brilliant executor. So, Jason, any other projects that you would like to highlight, maybe, as we've sort of talked a little bit about synthetics and Aave, maybe like one more project that is top of mind for you that you're excited about?
00:47:02.550 - 00:47:34.086, Speaker B: Yeah. So one project that I always bring up, and people are probably tired of me talking about it, is Alpha Finance. We're one of the first investors, and Tasha is the founder of Alpha, is one of those founders, right. That we just knew right away she's going to stick with it no matter what. Goes down with the ship. And lately they're creating this new launch pad that basically incubates different DeFi projects. First one's coming out called beta, which I thought is pretty funny that Alfred and Beta, and yeah, I'm really excited about what she's working on.
00:47:34.086 - 00:47:37.994, Speaker B: And the whole team is also one of the most stellar teams that we've met in crypto.
00:47:38.122 - 00:48:07.574, Speaker A: Yeah, and reminder. So you already disclosed this, that you all were early investors in them, but if one ends up holding Alpha and stakes it. So you want to check out, it's Hamora alphafinance.com. I think it's the website. If you stake Alpha, you end up earning a portion of these. You'll earn a share of the tokens from the projects they incubate. So that's just something to be informed about.
00:48:07.574 - 00:48:44.130, Speaker A: And actually, great time to remind everybody that all opinions expressed by myself and my guests are solely their own opinions and do not reflect the opinion of my employer for RC. Also, this interview is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions. Please do not follow any opinion as a specific strategy. Should have said that earlier. Jason, thanks so much for taking the time to be with us. This was great to just be able to dig in with you and just keep up the great work. I think the content you put out is really important to sort of educate the masses.
00:48:44.130 - 00:49:06.842, Speaker A: And I think if anything, like I said, I can attest to having learned so much from you through your podcast. Also, everyone, reminder to follow Jason on Twitter and you can subscribe to the blockcrunch podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever podcasts are distributed. Anything else, Jason, before we go, that's all.
00:49:06.896 - 00:49:12.622, Speaker B: We also recently started publishing on YouTube as well because a lot of people have been asking for that. So, yeah, feel free to check it out, too.
00:49:12.756 - 00:49:34.270, Speaker A: Absolutely. All the degenerates are on. And on that note, subscribe@defiedad.com if you enjoyed this interview and also for future tutorials, I'll be posting there. Jason, I'm just going to end the broadcast here and just again, thanks so much. Thanks everyone, for tuning in. Have a great day and we'll see you soon.
00:49:34.270 - 00:49:34.650, Speaker A: Bye.
