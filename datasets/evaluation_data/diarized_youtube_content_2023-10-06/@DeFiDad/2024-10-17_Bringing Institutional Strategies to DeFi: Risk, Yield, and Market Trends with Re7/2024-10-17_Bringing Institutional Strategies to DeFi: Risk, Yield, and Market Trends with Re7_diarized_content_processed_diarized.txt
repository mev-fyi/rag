00:00:00.320 - 00:00:24.925, Speaker A: Maybe we're not there yet. Maybe we'll be there next cycle when these things can truly be valued as a, you know, as a boring cash flow business. But clearly, clearly they're getting there. And what these people have been able to build is nothing short of phenomenal because, you know, to have a protocol in existence for, you know, several years without major security incidents and then grow it snow. No easy feat.

00:03:03.913 - 00:03:07.369, Speaker A: I'm great. Good to be here with you guys and thanks for having me.
00:03:07.457 - 00:04:00.579, Speaker B: So I'm excited to talk with you, mainly because I see you guys as one of the adults in the room for DeFi. You know, years ago, it was exciting when there was what, like, maybe 10 or so protocols on Ethereum. It was Defi Summer. It was really early, but we knew that it was a lot of hobbyists, a lot of folks that had, like, built financial applications for the first time. We didn't have as many builders or community members with the kind of experience that you and your team have at re7. And so, yeah, I'm hoping that you can, you know, shed a light on how does RE7 participate in DeFi markets. You know, whether it's through the liquid venture fund or whether you're curating vaults on Morpho or all the other ways that you guys contribute.
00:04:00.579 - 00:04:32.877, Speaker B: And I think, more importantly, I'm hoping that the lens you bring to this conversation helps us to understand. I mean, I would say I'm more of a. I'm a crypto native investor, a Defi native investor. And I'd love for you to tell me what your background and expertise tells you about where we are in the maturity of Defi today. So why don't we talk a little bit more about that background? Like, can you just tell us, like, how did you get into crypto and what led to the formation of RE7?
00:04:32.981 - 00:05:09.945, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And thank you again. So prior to this, I spent a bit about 10 years in traditional investment management in banks in a hedge fund, and the job was basically analyzing market sectors, trying to figure out what to do with investment portfolios. Came across Ethereum a bit less than 10 years ago. Started learning. It was kind of a very exciting rabbit hole, and I'm sure it was the same for most of us here. Worked at blockchain startup for a couple of years and eventually came across DeFi in 2019.
00:05:09.945 - 00:05:44.819, Speaker A: And something finally clicked in my mind where to me this was the first real use case of Crypto V on ICOs and everything that existed prior to that. And I started playing with it personally. Then Defi Summer happens. It became even more exciting and more fascinating. And the thinking has been that this could truly become the financial system of the future. And when you do have a financial sector, it's very multidimensional. You can go and become a venture investor and do the obvious.
00:05:44.819 - 00:06:39.337, Speaker A: You can become a Trader, you can become an investor liquid tokens, but also you can try and take kind of structural roles that could exist within that universe. Because whether we're using DeFi apps, Web2Apps or go into walk into a physical building of a bank, the nature of money is still pretty much the same. And the relationship between buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers is also pretty much the same. And the origin of 3.7 was kind of sitting, kind of meditating on it and realizing that if someone was to step in and become, as you say, professional, not just a hobbyist liquidity provider, then potentially you have a chance to take in a very important role in the ecosystem and be hopefully a good partner to lots of projects and support them with liquidity when they need it the most and potentially turn into an interesting investment strategy. And that was the genesis of how we really started Evgeny.
00:06:39.361 - 00:06:52.573, Speaker C: I feel like RE7 wears a lot of different hats throughout this ecosystem. So maybe you can just kind of give us the high level. What, what is Re7 capital? How do you describe what you do today?
00:06:52.669 - 00:07:31.537, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I'll, I'll start by saying that none of this is obviously investment advice or solicitation or anything like that. That's a mandatory bit. The way how I think about res7 is I think of it as a DEFI ecosystem hub. That's basically what it is to me. So as part of the reserve universe, we have a defi yield strategy where we have investors and we deploy that capital to earn yield across dozens of different chains. So that's responsible degenerate as we call it, where you try to be as definative as you can, combining it with the best risk management practices of the traditional world.
00:07:31.537 - 00:08:08.511, Speaker A: That's one aspect. The other aspect is us making investments into various projects in the space, whether they're liquid or illiquid. Then we support several chains with their defi ecosystem strategy because it's not very easy to build it out and to scale it out. And last but not least, we have a sister company called Resava Labs where we act as risk curators, running or co running some vaults across lending markets and restaking markets.
00:08:08.623 - 00:08:30.117, Speaker C: Let's get into one of the, like each one of those kind of piece by piece. And we can start with I guess like your approach to DEFI and treating it like much like an institutional strategy, would love to kind of pick your brain on what sort of yield strategies you participate in and, and just kind of like, yeah, anything you can share on that.
00:08:30.221 - 00:08:30.485, Speaker B: Sure.
00:08:30.525 - 00:09:41.035, Speaker A: Well, obviously there's been a Myriad of different strategies you can pursue in DeFi to earn yield, right? All the obvious ones, you know, farming and arbitrage and a little bit of, you know, playing with flash loans whenever, whenever that makes sense. You know, lending, staking, restaking points like it's limitless. But at the end of the day it comes to something very simple, right? Someone wants you to park your capital somewhere and they're paying for that in some shape or form, right? That's kind of one source of that. So someone is renting your liquidity, then the other piece is acting as a market maker, right? So you put your capital into Univ 2, it doesn't matter, right. On some decks and effectively act as a market maker and you earn some fees from that. But obviously over time these become kind of commoditized away and the DeFi market to me is actually pretty efficient because the moment yield spikes up, a day later capital comes in, right? Or even faster. And partially because we have amazing tools like DeFi llama for example where you go to one website, you see all the yields you care about.
00:09:41.035 - 00:10:49.171, Speaker A: So then people like us, we had to build our own tooling to get real time yield data. We had to build our own more sophisticated kind of AMM hedging algorithms where hopefully we can do something beyond Univ2 models and deal with concentrated ranges whilst hedging out impairment loss because obviously that's a tricky one. And then once in a while you have interesting, you can call them one offs, right? So there was a period of time where we were arbitraging options protocols on chain versus deribit where you just had mispricing. Then obviously there is funding rate arbitrage between different dexes so there is a lot you can do but it's very standardized because you know, finance is supposed to be boring. And with finance you can do, you can, you know, pay land, trade and play with derivatives and that's pretty much it. And I think we're all expecting DeFi to keep reinventing the wheel, but I think we have enough primitives as they are and given that we have a gazillion chains with all of those primitives that that keeps us busy.
00:10:49.243 - 00:11:17.495, Speaker C: Yeah, just the creative kind of design space on what you can do in DEFI can be overwhelming and mind boggling. One thing that I thought of that I find this can really inform an investing style is I'm not aware if RE7 is kind of like prop capital, like you all run your own capital there or if you're deploying capital on behalf of LPs. But yeah, just, just curious. Kind of like that, that structure of capital at Re 7.
00:11:17.615 - 00:12:09.307, Speaker A: Yeah, we have, we have investors and you know that, that's why we're kind of risk first, right? So whatever we do starts with the risk assessment rather than like we've never chased, you know, a farm with, you know, a million percent, because by the time we finish our due diligence, the yield is gone anyway. So we were very much conservative, but it also helped us, you know, not blow up in 2022, which, which is important, right? Because to win in the game, you need to survive in the game long enough, right? That's the starting point. And that's why we're extremely conservative with, you know, with custodial setup. That's why we spend a lot of time analyzing smart contract risk because obviously that's the real risk we take, right? So, and anyone in defi you, you're given this yield on paper for free. You know, it's, you know, video game money. You put it there, you earn some points and you sell them and you're very happy. But that's not riskless.
00:12:09.307 - 00:12:43.693, Speaker A: And even if you do it in a market neutral manner where you don't take the price risk of various assets and you're either purely stable coins or you hedge back into stables, you're intrinsically taking on the smart contract risk. So we're spending most of our time analyzing that. And we've actually come up with a methodology where the way how we think about it is there are things which are obvious, right? Sometimes you look at the protocol and you're just, I'm just not going to touch it. Like it just doesn't smell right. But more often than not, it actually looks okay. But then something bad can still happen. So there are lots of unknown unknowns.
00:12:43.693 - 00:13:23.055, Speaker A: And I don't think anyone in the world can look at something and say, this is bulletproof. So then you have to take kind of a probabilistic approach. So we're saying we think it's okay with a specific level of confidence, and then we construct a super diversified portfolio where no matter what blows up, we should be okay. And that's how we run it. Super diversified, which is how you do it in tradfi. Because if you run a venture strategy, then all you have to do is get one right and the rest you don't care about. When you're trying to earn yield, a single mistake can wipe out six months of yield or more.
00:13:23.055 - 00:13:38.727, Speaker A: And that's obviously not acceptable. So that's why we have to wear very opposite hats as a firm because in some strategies where super conservative, in the others were super aggressive. But when it comes to defi yield, I think being being safe is probably better than being sorry.
00:13:38.871 - 00:14:14.033, Speaker C: Evgeny at the time of this recording, BTC5 is just kind of kicking off on Pendle and I'm seeing 75 day PT yields between 7 to 9%. And my question to you is, is Pendle a platform that RE7's gotten comfortable with? Because I mean, just looking at that like the potential to lock in 9% yields on an asset like Bitcoin, I think is impressive. But yeah, just kind of curious your thoughts and like, I guess, level of comfort with something like Pendle.
00:14:14.169 - 00:14:40.707, Speaker A: Sure. Well, firstly, you know, we never publicly endorse any defi protocol because, you know, we can be held responsible for, you know, whatever happens. So we can't say that. We've looked at Pendell and we think it's bulletproof and it's amazing. I do think it's a pretty great team. We've known them since the very early days. We have actually, even in their old V1, which is very, very different from the current version.
00:14:40.707 - 00:15:09.369, Speaker A: We used it back in the day and there's never been any incidents and we've used it recently as well. So we've been comfortable with it. Doesn't mean that we can, you know, publicly endorse it, obviously. And then it comes down to, you know, your risk, return appetite. Right. Because I know having spoken to quite a few people about this strategy over the years, there are some people who are saying, oh, I can make, you know, 7, 15% yield. That, that's incredible.
00:15:09.369 - 00:15:56.543, Speaker A: I'm willing to take the risk. And then there is someone who will tell you, well, I think bitcoin is going to a million dollars and I'm going to more than 10x my portfolio in dollar value terms. Therefore, taking any risk to make 7, 9% a year is just not worth it for me. So I think it's very psychologically driven approach because the way how I would think about this, let's say if you're holding btc, you want to earn some yield, then everything has to be a portfolio approach. I think the better way of phrasing this question probably would be, is Penn a legitimate protocol or not a legitimate protocol? And the answer obviously, yes, it is legitimate. You know, I would like to earn yield on my btc. What percentage of my portfolio should I put there? And if your answer is, you know, 100%, then maybe you're wrong.
00:15:56.543 - 00:16:07.095, Speaker A: If the answer is zero, maybe you're wrong as well. Right. And the truth is somewhere in the middle. So in our experience, all of it comes down to sizing. Right. And that's kind of how we think about it.
00:16:07.175 - 00:16:57.343, Speaker B: Evgeny, for the average Defi user, like, looking at like an re7, I think, you know, we would be looking to you for like, best practices. And while I can't ask you for like, investment advice or, you know, I can't ask you to tell me, like, what strategy to deploy. Can you provide some simple rules or just a framework for Defi users managing risk? I feel like you've already alluded to, obviously, some like, you know, great sort of best practices. But if we were to kind of like, dumb that down further, you know, this is why I love Defi. We're able to access the same opportunities. Often sophistication prevents some of us from being able to execute on some of the strategies, of course, that RE7 would deploy. But at the end of the day, risk is, you know, is going to wreck us just the same.
00:16:57.343 - 00:17:00.543, Speaker B: So any sort of simple rules here would be appreciated.
00:17:00.639 - 00:17:25.195, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And you're actually right. Defi is a very level playing field. So it's not about someone having a secret source. It's more about the discipline. And, you know, that one, to me, the way how I personally think about it is very, very simple. So imagine, you know, you have two coins and you want to put coin one into platform number one, coin two into platform number two.
00:17:25.195 - 00:18:15.315, Speaker A: The way how I would think about is if platform number one blows up, what percentage of my portfolio am I willing to lose? And you ask yourself the same question with platform number two. Now imagine the platform number one is, you know, take a pick, your favorite Defi blue chip protocol, and you'll say, I think like, that one is super safe. They've been around for a while, they have a bunch of capital. So if they blow up, then it's like, almost like the end of the world. And then I'm okay losing a bunch because I think it's very unlikely, even intuitively, right? And there is a farm that appeared last night, you know, and on developers, crazy yield, no docs, no audits, you're probably less likely to say, okay, well, I'm okay to lose my core portfolio. There you'll say, well, maybe should be, you know, 1% of my portfolio. So I think, you know, staying sane in the moment is not easy.
00:18:15.315 - 00:18:50.975, Speaker A: But before, because Defi yield is an investment strategy, right? And before you start doing anything Investment related. You should create your own basically rule book and you should say, this is my own set of policies. And then you print it out, you put it on a wall next to your laptop and that becomes your like, almost religious, like, way of life. Because it's very easy to lose a cool head when you're seeing something amazing and you just jump and you FOMO and then you regret it. Right? I'm sure we will. I mean, I've made those mistakes. Everyone has, I'm sure.
00:18:50.975 - 00:18:56.907, Speaker A: And doing something as simple as that and asking yourself that question can really protect you from a lot of things.
00:18:57.011 - 00:19:43.381, Speaker B: Yeah, to your point, I think the protocols like AAVE that have been around, those protocols have years of traction to have proven themselves. And you know, at the end of the day, even if you're just lending, you know, there's still this risk of a smart contract exploit. And so those protocols that have proven themselves like, those are the ones that, that, you know, I'm personally willing to like, risk whatever. Higher percentage of my portfolio. Higher percentage too, being like, I don't know, I'm going to just throw out a number like let's say 10%, maybe even 20%. Like, those are so battle tested. But to your point, if I see a new farm, I'd be out of my mind to be risking more than, you know, let's say like 1%.
00:19:43.381 - 00:20:19.127, Speaker B: I actually, I always frame it up. I used to do this in like a tutorial video and say, whatever I'm going to risk here, I've got to be willing to live with the repercussions of losing 100% of it if something goes wrong. And if that happens, does my life go on? Is it something I easily move forward on? And if it would be painful, then, like, why am I doing that? And as simple as that sounds, I still, I feel like, you know, anyone, no matter like how much more professional of a position they're in, investing on behalf of others, like, the mindset's the same there, is it defensible in the end.
00:20:19.231 - 00:21:00.905, Speaker A: And that's literally the questions we ask ourselves. So I think again, investment is, you know, something it's not fully, you know, level, you know, kind of field where everyone has the same access and whatever, but it's as close to that as it gets, you know, and if you think about it, to put it very simply, you know, we all have the same ability to pick stocks, the same ability as Warren Buffett, but it doesn't mean we're going to be as good as Warren Buffett. Right? Even though it's the same information Pretty much. Right. So yeah, whether you were a hedge fund, whether you were a whale or someone playing in the space, personally, you need to be asking yourself exactly the same questions. And that's exactly what you phrased.
00:21:03.205 - 00:21:39.755, Speaker B: Hey everyone, before we get back to the show, excited to tell you about a new Omnichain bitcoin solution called FBTC, which has already surpassed $125 million in TVL and become the fastest growing BTC FI asset this summer. The FBTC Points campaign Sparkle offers sustainable yields plus points and token airdrops from strategic partners such as Babylon Mantle's new token cook and more. To learn more, visit fbtc.com ongoing campaign and special thanks to FBTC for sponsoring us at the Edge podcast.
00:21:41.615 - 00:22:24.695, Speaker C: So Defi dad mentioned AAVE there. Um, AAVE is a good example of a blue chip token from a previous cycle that's I believe near fully emitted, if not fully emitted and and now sits at a somewhat same market cap to ftv. This kind of gets us into like these liquid opportunities. I'm curious how you're thinking about them, how you're sizing them up. Because again, as I mentioned, there's, there's a ton of like blue chip tokens now, like Maker's. Another one, like the supply is essentially fully out there and tradable. And a lot of these protocols are now having that discussion about turning on a fee switch or already have turned on a fee switch and they're making, you know, material revenues.
00:22:24.695 - 00:22:33.139, Speaker C: So with that kind of backdrop, like how is re7 looking at these open market opportunities?
00:22:33.267 - 00:23:07.157, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. And again, it comes down to the lens, right, and how you set your own investment objectives. Because maybe someone says, hey, I want to hold bitcoin. I'm very happy. Maybe someone will say, my personal objective is to do two acts of what bitcoin can deliver. Someone will say, actually eth, I will outperform Eth, Sol, whatever, right? And then someone will say, I don't care about Eth, btc, Sol or anything else. I want to gamble on meme coins because I want to make a million X, you know, in a month or so.
00:23:07.157 - 00:23:52.339, Speaker A: So I think first and foremost it comes down to where do you think you have an edge? Are you like an amazing trader? Are you someone who is willing to spend 24 hours per day in discord looking for the next meme? Are you someone who is willing to go and do the work and figure out if Aave, Maker and many others are a good Business and then you treat them as a business investment like you would a stock, and then you hold them for an extended period of time. Are you a trader? So again, it comes down to understanding your psychology, your edge and everything else. Our approach again is heavily biased by our experience in tradfi where to us these are. I don't think it's. There's a lot of debate right now. Should you think of something like Ethereum as a business or is it a network? Right. Is the business.
00:23:52.339 - 00:24:33.277, Speaker A: It's not a company, it's something in between or something very etheric. And ultimately we do think of these as businesses. They're just very unusual. But structurally, there is a correlation between the fundamental metrics of a project and the value of their token, which is very interesting because people often say crypto has no fundamentals, it's all gambler's market and whatever. But I often challenge people and say, show me a protocol that has real traction in the space that is being used by people and is well known that has a token that's, you know, trading like dust. I'm not aware of a single one. Maybe the reason I haven't found one yet.
00:24:33.277 - 00:25:15.925, Speaker A: But talking about Defi as that's the subject of our conversation, every protocol that I know that is widely being used and has a place in the market, and has not just a place in the market for a day or a night, but rather has been around for a while, they're not cheap. It doesn't mean they can't appreciate a lot. Maybe they can, but they're not trading. I mean, they're valued at a serious nine figure, ten figure, whatever, valuation. And yeah, we're an interesting point where Defi started as an experiment, whatever, five years ago. Fast forward to today. We have these giants who are clearly dominant in their segments of the market.
00:25:15.925 - 00:25:49.451, Speaker A: And then the tricky part becomes there are only two questions really. One, do you think they'll keep growing? But the answer to that is very simple. The answer is, well, we don't know. But really, will Defi grow or not? Because when you have a protocol that already dominates having, you know, more than 50% market share within their respective chain, I mean, okay, you can go from 50 to 60 or from 60 to 70, but it's pretty incremental. So it's all about the pie growing together for all of us. And that's. You have to believe or don't believe.
00:25:49.451 - 00:26:28.515, Speaker A: There is no data that can tell you yes or no. It's a, it's a belief system really. And then do you think they can, the team is good enough to at least maintain the market share if it does grow. And then if they do that, will there be value accrual to the token in some shape or form? And this is a tricky part because again, no one knows. Some people are experimenting with a fee switch, some people are experimenting with the buybacks. And it feels that buybacks, they've worked to kind of support specific tokens and it kind of makes sense, right, because when someone is buying the token all the time on a relative basis, the price should be going up, right? So that's kind of a no brainer. And yeah, they're becoming more mature.
00:26:28.515 - 00:26:53.829, Speaker A: Maybe we're not there yet, maybe we'll be there, you know, next cycle when these things can truly be valued as a, you know, as a boring cash flow business. But clearly, clearly they're getting there. And what these people have been able to build is nothing short of phenomenal because, you know, to have a protocol in existence for, you know, several years without major security incidents and then grow, it snow. No easy feat.
00:26:53.917 - 00:27:08.877, Speaker C: Evgeny, on this side of kind of like your investment book, are you skewed more on the e liquid side or liquid side? And I mean, maybe that's kind of a fluid thing too, depending on how opportunistic you want to be.
00:27:08.901 - 00:27:45.171, Speaker A: In certain markets, we focus on liquid investments. We feel that. So firstly, we think it's a different skill set. And you know, I think if someone is good in venture, it doesn't mean they'll be good in liquid markets and vice versa. So we just play where we feel we have more experience and better skills. But more importantly, ventures, you know, especially these days, it's very loud, right on Twitter with the VC coins and what have you. There's nothing wrong with a venture fund, you know, giving a bunch of capital to a project, hoping it becomes something gigantic.
00:27:45.171 - 00:28:40.271, Speaker A: But what's interesting to me is that in traditional world, for every dollar of venture capital, there is, I know, $100 or $1,000 of capital in public liquid markets, which kind of makes sense because Facebook in day one means $1 of venture capital, but at the current size, it needs a lot of dollars to support its share price. But in crypto we have the opposite, which is partially, I guess, a legacy issue. So we thought there were a lot of mispriced assets on the liquid market, which sometimes there are projects with real fundamental metrics, they trade cheaper than series A venture deals which don't have a level of product yet. And that doesn't really feel right or didn't feel right when we launched. So we focused on liquid. We have been doing some illiquid deals but very, very tactically and strategically the core of our book is on the liquid side.
00:28:40.383 - 00:29:36.645, Speaker B: One of the things I noted with RE7 is just yeah, this focus on liquid strategies and I feel like the timing of this like your guys success has you know, been in parallel to a lot of criticisms of crypto venture. Like I'm wondering, do you, do you feel like the crypto venture space is broken? There's been a lot of funds that have been launched over the last few years. There's a lot of criticisms about you know, high FDV tokens with low floats which comes from like rounds being raised, you know, one after another to you know, billions of dollars before anyone else is able to like actually participate on chain. I guess. Like what are your thoughts there? Like is, is, is that an opportunity for again the liquid strategy funds or is it something that's like just so broken and is holding us back as a space?
00:29:37.225 - 00:30:11.981, Speaker A: I don't think VCs are evil. Right. For the most part these are people who have experienced careers that were strong enough to enable them to actually go to people and convince them to give them some money to run. And these people then convince other people to be accepted into deals which you know, it's a full time job, it's a very hard job. It's still, it's easy to deploy money. It's very hard to deploy money. Well and you know, being frank, you know, if someone comes to any of us and offers, you know, crazy amount of money to go and run a venture fund, well it's very hard to say no.
00:30:11.981 - 00:31:02.797, Speaker A: And why would you. Right. So I think it's more of a market structure issue rather than anything bad about VCs because these are just people trying to make a living and trying to do a good job and that's perfectly fair. And I think that there probably, you know, at the high level there are two challenges historically, you know, if you are and I've seen, I've seen this on our side. So you know, if you're running a liquid fund investing in tokens, you can be up or down more than 50% in one month as a fund, which obviously firstly it's very psychologically difficult. It's manageable but difficult. But it's very hard for investors because imagine you're holding, you know, pick your favorite token and it's down 50% overnight because I don't know, Trump said something you're like, okay, it's noise, you know, cuddle and you message your friends and everyone is holding and you kind of powering through.
00:31:02.797 - 00:31:41.551, Speaker A: But if you are someone from the normal world and you get your monthly report and you see that you're down 50%, you're going to, you're going to scream and you will, you think it's all a scam. So for large allocators who are on the institutional side, it's a lot of career risk to go and put money into anything liquid. In crypto, it's much safer to give money to a venture fund where nothing really gets marked down for 10 years and then you're very unlikely to get fired unless you get unlucky. And, you know, you, you do an FTX deal or something. So it's much easier to deploy serious amounts of capital into private markets. And that, that's how it played out. That's the thing.
00:31:41.551 - 00:32:31.123, Speaker A: The first reason, the second reason is that if we had this conversation five years ago, yeah, there were a bunch of liquid tokens you can buy, but there was nothing fundamental behind them because apart from Ethereum, nothing was being, you know, being used. So you can buy eth, but everything else is pure speculation. And this is one of the first times ever when you can actually run a proper liquid fund. And more and more are emerging, but there is momentum where large investors are still mainly doing private markets because they're used to it and it takes time for things to mature. But ultimately, I do believe that markets are efficient. They're just efficient on different time horizons. So I think it's unrealistic for us to say, well, the whole capital formation structure needs to change overnight.
00:32:31.123 - 00:33:05.811, Speaker A: But theoretically, let's imagine that we do get a bull run in tokens at some point. And once the bull run is over, you see where the dust has settled and you look and you see, okay, liquid funds, for example, have done so. So venture funds have done amazingly well. Then as an investor, you're like, okay, well, I should put more money into venture funds. If you see the other way around and you're like, okay, well, maybe I give too many too much money to venture funds. I need to even out the scales and give more money to liquid funds and then the market will correct itself with a time lag. So it's a legacy structure of the market.
00:33:05.811 - 00:33:37.665, Speaker A: I think it does change gradually. And even venture funds, a lot of them are actually buying liquid tokens these days. So I do think it's changing behind the scenes slowly. But ultimately, if you're a Large allocator investing serious money and you think you can get the same returns without any mark to market volatility in your portfolio. Why not? So you need to see materially higher returns on the liquid side and then you need to change your strategy.
00:33:37.755 - 00:33:49.345, Speaker C: We've talked a lot about fundamentals and possibly the antithesis of fundamentals is meme coins is re 7 delving into that arena of meme coins.
00:33:49.645 - 00:34:34.035, Speaker A: Yeah, we have, we have. It's, you know, I have to say that there's never been a single other theme or sector where we spend so much back and forth, you know, debating and arguing, because by definition these things don't make any sense and they're not supposed to make any sense. But ultimately, you know, the way how we think about it is our job is not to like investors don't come to us and say, hey, tell me where the best fundamentals are. Ultimately our job is to do the best we can for our investors on the risk adjusted basis. Right. In terms of returns and mean coins. It's interesting, right, that I'm not even going to, you know, celebrity and manipulation because it's a highly, you know, manipulated market.
00:34:34.035 - 00:35:39.669, Speaker A: That, that's just a fact. But what is interesting to me is that the fact itself that people actually go into meme coins, right? So why, why would people do that? Right? And obviously I don't have the answer, but to me it feels that partially, maybe it's entertainment value. They feel it's like a video game where they play with their friends and it's fun and it's a social element to, to that maybe it's a sign of, you know, financial despair in a way because what's happening right now kind of out there in the world from an economic standpoint is, can be best described as stagflation where for most people their, you know, their wages have not increased. Inflation is insane no matter where you live. And inflation at all the areas of your life, you know, healthcare, food, schools, you know, whatever. So you're kind of getting squeezed, right? Your inflation is up, you're not necessarily making more money as a salary through your salary. And then it becomes a sign of like a despair and you go and you buy a lottery ticket and then instead of buying and then maybe it's a fun lottery ticket, then it's very hard to resist.
00:35:39.669 - 00:36:09.509, Speaker A: And obviously there's a whole gambling element to that. And crypto is nothing but a gambling industry at its core. So therefore, if we believe that these behavioral patterns will continue, then it's actually not rational. To ignore it. But also you need to be very mindful that I think that if I make an investment into a defi blue chip protocol, it's hard for me to imagine how it can go to zero. I can obviously imagine how it can go down a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot.
00:36:09.509 - 00:36:40.331, Speaker A: But if I believe that five years down the line is going to be a great business, then okay, maybe I'm very surprised and I take a loss. But at least I can wait and something will be waiting for me on the other side with Meme Quest. They can go to zero overnight and you'll never know why. Right. So it comes down to sizing, right? Am I okay having 100% of my portfolio? Do I think that tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny allocation is probably appropriate? Yeah, possibly. So it comes down to sizing and being very aware of what you're getting into.
00:36:40.443 - 00:37:01.131, Speaker B: So we talked about meme coins on one side of the risk spectrum. We talked about venture, we talked about liquid strategies. One other like sector I'm wondering if you guys are investing in or if you just have thoughts on it, is the OTC markets. Like yeah, what are your thoughts there? Are there opportunities? Why or why not?
00:37:01.243 - 00:38:08.381, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question and it's the short answer. It depends. Right? Because OTC could be, you know, we like each other and you want to sell something and I want to buy something and we just want to do it over a quick message at market price. That's an ODC deal or it's, you know, a four year lock with a 50% discount to sports and then it's a whole different story. So obviously everyone in the fund management facing executive in the Odyssey game in some shape or form, given that we're primarily liquid people, we do very little of it when it requires a lockup because yeah, for us it's very important to have our options open and keep the flexibility. And also if we think back to August and September of this year, a lot of altcoins were down 50, 70% in a month and a half. So it's very hard to justify a multi year lockup when you're getting a 30% discount when you know that in one bad month is going to be down more like everyone else.
00:38:08.381 - 00:38:30.301, Speaker A: We've made those mistakes and we did some of those deals and there are deals which we regretted. There are some deals which we're very happy about. Generally speaking it comes down to the function of your time horizon. Right. So if you are super excited about something and you want to call it for 10 years, you'd be an idiot not to go and do it. I'll see you. Right.
00:38:30.301 - 00:38:37.949, Speaker A: And if you're like, well, I don't know, maybe the cycle is going to about in X months, then obviously you need to stay within that timeframe.
00:38:38.117 - 00:39:00.555, Speaker B: Catch the tide of the mainnet launch of Puffer Finance. Whether you're an Ethereum staker or an aspiring node operator, Puffer delivers the decentralization revolution with its cutting edge technology. Start with just 2 ETH to unlock the potential of native liquid restaking and maximize your earnings. Join the movement now and anchor your stake at Puffer Fi.
00:39:02.255 - 00:39:33.727, Speaker C: I want to talk a bit about vault curation next. With the rise of a lot of these modular protocols like Morpho and Euler, seeing a lot of teams do these like curated vaults. So RE7 is a name that I've seen curating some of these vaults. Honestly, I don't know a ton about it, like behind the scenes, like what you do or how it works, but maybe you can kind of walk us through a bit of the nuances ultimately. Like what is a curator providing here for people?
00:39:33.831 - 00:40:09.405, Speaker A: Yep. So the easiest way to think about it is imagine that you want to create a lending protocol today. Firstly, you need to do a lot of work on the smart contract side and actually build the protocol. Right? So you need to build a software business. And once it's live, you need to make sure that the markets are functioning right. New collateral is being added, bad collateral is being removed, interest rates are being balanced, lending ratios, ltv ratios are being managed somehow and you can choose to do it yourself. And then you'll, you're like, okay, well I'm an amazing software engineer.
00:40:09.405 - 00:40:55.085, Speaker A: Do I know how to do risk management? Maybe yes, maybe no. Should I do it in? How should I outsource it? And then some protocols chose to outsource it. Right. And effectively what this does is from a protocol standpoint, it creates a lot of isolated risk, which I think is great because we all know there were quite a few, well, a lot of lending exploits where everything is one global market. So if you pool, you know, on the weakest link, the whole thing collapses, which is very dangerous and it's not sustainable because maybe eventually you will get to a protocol which never collapses. And for us it's okay as defi people, but you can't expect, I don't know, some pick your favorite bank, look at it and say, well, it hasn't been hacked in two years, therefore we'll put billions of dollars in there. That's never going to happen.
00:40:55.085 - 00:41:52.951, Speaker A: So you need something that's much more resilient at the score. And one way how you can do it is create a lot of isolated markets where if one of them blows up, the rest is okay, like a portfolio approach. And then you can have different curators come and basically compete because someone comes as, hey, there is, you know, I'm willing to offer to the market this lending pair at this lending ratio. And then someone comes and says, hey, I want to go even more aggressive. And then as a user you can choose what you go into, right? So it's like someone prepackages these solutions and you go into the one that you feel is the best one for you. So it allows to create customized, tailored products out of one global kind of universe. And we're seeing this with lending, we're seeing this with restaking, because eventually once restaking is truly life, different people will be delegating to different AVSs and there was going to be differentiation because the three of us could be delegating to three different AVSs and one of us can lose money and the others can be fined.
00:41:52.951 - 00:42:15.007, Speaker A: And the job of a curator is to basically create these vaults and present them to the world and say, well, this vault does abc. Here you go. This vault does something else, something else. And that's it. So this way you can just choose what risk return profile works best for you as a defi user.
00:42:15.071 - 00:42:51.223, Speaker C: Evgeny, you alluded to the competitive nature and kind of like that competition that I guess arises here with some of these vault curators. Ultimately it seems like the users win and benefit to have this kind of almost open market competition for who can provide the best yields. But curious like as somebody in that arena how you're looking at that, like if a gauntlet or an MEV capital comes out with like a really high yielding pool, are you then trying to like reverse engineer any of that? Like, okay, how are they doing this? Break it apart and see how you can kind of like add that into your own kind of toolkit.
00:42:51.359 - 00:43:43.711, Speaker A: That's a very good question. So there are probably two aspects to that. One is, you know, when you, when you have a product and you're seeing a very similar product being rolled out next to you, obviously you're going to look and you're going to figure out what the differences are and are there any learnings, Right? So that's very natural, right? I'm sure. I don't know a phone company buys every iPhone, tries to like figure out what's, what's happening there, right? And then the question is, you know, what do you want to do with that knowledge once you have it? And this comes down to your risk management discipline. Because the easiest way to lose money is to chase yield, right? I've seen this in Tradfi. You can go into making it out treasuries making 5% a year, but you want to get 10%, you go into some junk bond, a new blowout. So when we see adjacent vaults being launched, we have actually very rarely made any changes to ours because we are aware of the choices we're making.
00:43:43.711 - 00:44:30.627, Speaker A: So we can run, let's say we're on a vault and then you guys create a new vault that's alongside ours and yours is more aggressive in yield. If we've chosen to be more conservative, it's because we have a specific view and we want to stick to our view. And then there are some other vaults where, with some different assets, where we may be viewed as being more aggressive than others. And that's because, again, we have a specific view. So we don't really see the point of copycatting each other because it never stops. Because then the person whom we're trying to copycat, they will look at what we've done and they'll go one step further, one step further, one step further, and it becomes pointless. And frankly, we actually, we have collaborative relationships with pretty much all, most and if not all other risk curators.
00:44:30.627 - 00:45:17.847, Speaker A: Because ultimately we all think it's pretty pointless to try and win, you know, a tiny, tiny market share in that business. Because firstly, the risk curation has been around for less than a year, so we don't even know where it's going to go. And I think the best chance that anyone has in succeeding is to basically make sure, as you said, the users get the best possible experience and that helps grow the pie. Because I would rather have, you know, one basis point market share of a gigantic market, then I know 10% of where we are today is defi. So that's why we don't really stress about it too much, because in my view of the world, this is basically perfect competition. There is very low barrier to launching new vault. They're all open sourced, they're all transparent, therefore it's pure competition.
00:45:17.847 - 00:45:25.237, Speaker A: So therefore what you, in our minds, what you can do is just stick to what you do, stick to what you know and try to grow the whole thing and then what happens, happens.
00:45:25.341 - 00:45:56.153, Speaker B: Makes total sense. When Morpho was making announcements about launching, I really wasn't sure if the markets were mature enough to start to grow into this new design. But it makes a lot of sense. Look at all the Bitcoin Ether ETFs launched this year. It mirrors the traditional finance world. And you look at those and go, well, aren't they all the same thing? And you're like, well, yeah, they are. Basically, there's a hell of a lot more differentiation in what you guys and others are doing with vaults.
00:45:56.153 - 00:46:18.841, Speaker B: So. Makes a lot of sense. If you're a DeFi OG and you can just execute on that strategy, well, then, like, maybe it's not worth it for you. But for folks that are looking at these as, like, okay, I do need assistance and identifying the best way to spin up a yield. This is a great place to start to explore that. And I for one, will say I'm just a big fan of Morpho, not an investor. Wish I was.
00:46:18.841 - 00:46:36.601, Speaker B: Big mistake. Should have. Should have begged to try to get into a round like that. But good for them. And we'll continue to be huge allies of them here at the Edge podcast. Guys, I think this is a great place for us to start to wrap up, though. So I want to remind listeners they should learn more about RE7 by going to RE7 Capital.
00:46:36.601 - 00:47:03.375, Speaker B: None of this is financial advice, of course, but you can learn a lot from them, obviously from the podcast. And if you go to their website, if you go to Twitter, follow them at re7capital. Follow evgeny@evgeny, underscore re7. We'll put all that into the show notes so you can easily reference it. And then Evgeny, just thanks so much for coming on. I mean, the background of this is we had a quick conversation and I was just like, wow. Like, that could have been the podcast.
00:47:03.375 - 00:47:28.717, Speaker B: And so I was just so excited to be able to spin up the conversation with you. So thank you for, you know, coming on with us. To close out, though, could you go back to a point you made earlier about you said, if we get a token bull run, and that perked up my ears. Like, do you think we're in a bull run right now? Why? Or why not? Or, like, what's your, like, macro view of, like, where we are in the. The crypto bull cycle?
00:47:28.821 - 00:47:48.355, Speaker A: Firstly, it was a pleasure. So thank you for inviting me, you know, to the point about the bull run. Definitely doesn't feel like a bull run. That's. That's for sure. And again, with a big, big disclaimer that none of it is obviously financial advice, but crypto tends to be cyclical. Right? So we know how it Goes with the halving and everything else.
00:47:48.355 - 00:48:24.185, Speaker A: And I think the answer to that is it depends on. I think it's very hard to be a full time professional in this industry. Not just a hobbyist, but someone who dedicates their career in every waking hour and being bearish. Because if you're bearish, then I mean, you might as well go and get the real job pretty much. Because the sandbox world playing with is still very, very tiny, as we've been discussing. Right. So then the only way to wake up and keep growing the teams and keep motivating people and keep motivating yourself is to be bullish.
00:48:24.185 - 00:49:01.739, Speaker A: So I think we are guilty of having that, you know, permanent kind of bullish bias. It does feel we're overdue for something positive. The only kind of anxiety, I guess, that I have is that we don't really have new use cases at scale within crypto. Right. Obviously there are cool things like social deep in, so on and so forth, but a person could argue that, you know, you can, you can do with crypto today what you could have done, you know, several years ago. But, you know, you have to be a perpetual optimist, which we are. So we, we have high hopes for the next 12 months and then, you know, we'll see what happens.
00:49:01.739 - 00:49:11.483, Speaker A: Macro is impossible to figure out, but if there was ever an altcoin season to emerge, we, you know, hopefully we're not too far.
00:49:11.619 - 00:49:41.133, Speaker B: I'll leave listeners with this. If you get a chance, go back and listen to a podcast we did with Sergey Nazarov, the co founder of Chainlink. He really emphasized the fact that stablecoins are just tokenized cash. That's an rwa. That is an insanely simple but early example of where we're headed. Everything could potentially come on chain. This is why BlackRock and other mega institutional players are coming into the space.
00:49:41.133 - 00:50:14.283, Speaker B: And he just kept emphasizing there's like 200 to 400 trillion in assets out there that could potentially come on chain. Even if a tiny, tiny percentage of that ends up coming our way and gets tokenized, that is enormous growth for a space that, you know, really only occupies a few trillion on its best day in terms of total value. So anyways, to your point, if you're bearish, go get a boring job and get out of here. But if you're bullish, you're welcome anytime. Evgeny, thanks for coming on and we'd love to have you back.
00:50:14.379 - 00:50:16.051, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.
00:50:16.203 - 00:50:39.685, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at 4th Revolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge Underscore Podcast.
