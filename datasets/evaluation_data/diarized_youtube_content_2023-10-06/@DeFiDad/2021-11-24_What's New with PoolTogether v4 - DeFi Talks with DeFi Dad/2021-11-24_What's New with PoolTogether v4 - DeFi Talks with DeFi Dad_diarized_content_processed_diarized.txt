00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.640, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:02.530 - 00:00:03.230, Speaker B: All right.
00:00:03.300 - 00:00:04.798, Speaker A: Here we're live.
00:00:04.884 - 00:00:19.854, Speaker B: Cool. So we are live. Yeah. Hey, everyone, it's Tuesday, November 23, 2021. This is DFI talks with DFI. Dad, thanks for joining us. We're two days out from Thanksgiving, 2021, and we're going to get to talk all today about pull together V four.
00:00:19.854 - 00:01:00.400, Speaker B: Pull together is a protocol for lossless savings. I like to think of it as a game because at the end of the day, someone is randomly chosen to earn or be rewarded the interest from the collective collateral that's deposited and earning interest. And anyways, it's evolved so much since 2019 when Layton Cusack here, who's one of the co founders and now a member of the pull together dow when they launched it. And so, yeah, just excited to catch up with Layton here and like I said, learn all about the improvements that they've made to the protocol. So, Layton, thanks for joining me. How are you doing?
00:01:00.850 - 00:01:14.066, Speaker A: I'm doing good. I'm getting currently kind of blasted by the sun, so that's why my face might look a little bit weird. It's a weird angle, but I guess it's nice to be in the sun. So I'm doing great and happy to be here.
00:01:14.248 - 00:01:31.770, Speaker B: I was going to say if we go back to 2019, you were building pulled together, you were traveling around in a van. So the fact that you have sunlight streaming through a window in an apartment, condo, whatever it is, that's a huge improvement. Actually, I'm curious, do you miss the van?
00:01:33.230 - 00:01:48.960, Speaker A: Yes, I do. If anyone's watching, what Defi dad's referencing is when, for the first year and a half or two years for pool together, I was living full time in a van. And so that was a pretty. It's a great way to live.
00:01:49.730 - 00:02:09.974, Speaker B: I was envious of it. It sounded incredible. You were traveling. You were, like, meeting lots of people. I think it kind of puts into perspective what's important, but also, too, since then, and I'm sure someday you'll be a Defi dad as well.
00:02:10.012 - 00:02:14.230, Speaker A: With kids, there's only one Defi dad, and it's you.
00:02:14.300 - 00:02:14.920, Speaker B: Okay.
00:02:15.850 - 00:02:19.090, Speaker A: There might be other dads in Defi, but you are the defi dad.
00:02:19.250 - 00:02:30.330, Speaker B: I am the Defi dad. Well, hey, do you prefer to talk through some of the improvements, or do you just want to start screen sharing and we can walk through it on the Dap?
00:02:31.070 - 00:02:33.980, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe talking through. Maybe talking through is good.
00:02:34.290 - 00:02:56.838, Speaker B: That'd be great, actually. Maybe you could call out to some of, like, I know a few of the things that I knew that you were addressing with this is. There's the whole thing of, at the end of the day, it's called a no loss or lossless savings scheme, but price savings. Yeah. I still call it a lossless lottery. It feels like that. It's fun.
00:02:56.838 - 00:03:33.710, Speaker B: It's playing the lottery, but it's not a lottery. But it's not a lottery. Yes. I always have to correct similar mechanics, though, because I think you can cleverly play a game here and potentially win a prize. But what's so different, of course, is you don't risk your principal. At the end of the day, whether you win or you don't, you get to walk away with your principal. And then in previous versions, worth calling out, you all added an element of earning interest, or at least something beyond just the actual weekly or daily prize.
00:03:33.710 - 00:03:58.626, Speaker B: But one of the criticisms was, of course, there was gas. Gas has always been high for all of us in Defi. So, yeah, kind of curious how you guys have tackled some of those issues of how do I win? Or how do I more predictably earn more, and then how do you tackle those sorts of gas issues that relate back to the congestion on the Ethereum network?
00:03:58.818 - 00:04:17.390, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, awesome. That's good. I'll answer those two questions. But first, just to start, I would say, just to sort of reiterate what you were saying, in my own words, pool together is a prize savings protocol. And so, prize savings is a financial instrument that's been around for a while. It's really popular all over the world.
00:04:17.390 - 00:04:36.306, Speaker A: The basic idea is like a savings account. You deposit money, you can take your money out whenever you want to. You never lose your money, but while your money is deposited, you have a chance to win prizes. So that's what pool together is. And pool together was one of the first DFI protocols. It launched in June of 2019. That was before DFI was even a term at that time.
00:04:36.306 - 00:05:11.680, Speaker A: It was sort of like SNX. Compound and Uniswap were really the only other ones. And so it's been around for a long time, and for some people in this audience, you may have tried it before, but the new V four is a lot different, and that's why I think it's important to talk about. And so, first off, the V three, the most recent version before this one, a pool together, is probably what most people are familiar with. And the V three had two sort of key problems that I think you touched on. The first was that it had a technical limitation in terms of maybe this is a little less distracting without the sun in my face.
00:05:12.290 - 00:05:13.774, Speaker B: You're all good. You're all good.
00:05:13.812 - 00:05:40.418, Speaker A: Okay. Well, it had a technical limitation in terms of how many people could win prizes. So basically, it was limited to, like, five winners per week. Right. And so what happened is it became very popular. There was hundreds of millions of dollars deposited, but it sort of became a victim of its own success in some ways, because with hundreds of millions of dollars deposited, your chances to win are weighted based on how much you deposit. So if you have a small deposit, you obviously have a very small chance to win if there's only five prizes a week and there's $100 million deposited.
00:05:40.418 - 00:05:45.660, Speaker A: And so, for example, d five. Dad, you've probably been deposited for a long time. But have you ever won?
00:05:46.190 - 00:05:51.466, Speaker B: I have, but that's okay. I have not won. No.
00:05:51.648 - 00:05:52.426, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:52.608 - 00:05:54.686, Speaker B: I keep the hope alive that I will.
00:05:54.868 - 00:06:03.940, Speaker A: Well, this is the thing with V four. You don't have to keep the hope alive anymore. You can actually just realize that hope because. Okay, so with v three.
00:06:04.390 - 00:06:36.762, Speaker B: Yes, what I was saying, actually, hold on. I need to back up on that in a sec. I won when I got my pool airdrop. That was more than any prize I had ever expected. Like a lot of protocols, participating early, getting those airdrops is unreal. So, yeah, I want to clarify. I couldn't have been more grateful when I got that airdrop, but I haven't won the weekly or daily prize yet.
00:06:36.896 - 00:07:27.158, Speaker A: Well, I appreciate you saying that, because the pool distribution was actually, I think, one of the most aggressive, or if not the most aggressive, in terms of community ownership. So from the get go, from the decentralization get go in February of this year, the protocol has been fully decentralized with control fully in the hands of the community. But anyways, let's go back to winning, right? Because if you're depositing into a prize savings account, you want to win, and if you don't win, that's going to feel bad. And so the V three sort of was a victim of its own success. And so what the community really came together and realized is, like, okay, in order to make this work, what we need is, like, an unbounded distribution of prizes and also tiers of prizes. So with V four, with the old pool together, let's say there's $100,000 being given away. So what would happen is there'd be five winners.
00:07:27.158 - 00:08:21.290, Speaker A: They'd each get $20,000.05 times 20 is 100. With the new pool together, the way it works, let's say we're going to give $100,000 away in a week. There can be like one person who wins $25,000, but then there can be like 1000 people who win like $100, or 10,000 people who win $10, or 50 people who win $50, whatever distribution is desired. And so basically what that means now is it's like orders of magnitude difference in terms of your ability to get return and your chance to win these prizes. And obviously you're going to have a small chance to win the large prizes, but you'll have a very high chance of winning these smaller prizes. And if you model it out on sort of an APR basis, you're going to end up beating the ApRs you would get versus depositing into the underlying yield sources.
00:08:21.290 - 00:08:28.142, Speaker A: So d five. Dad, you need to upgrade your deposit. I know that's painful gas fees, but you need to V three.
00:08:28.196 - 00:08:30.960, Speaker B: No, you'd win.
00:08:31.330 - 00:09:03.660, Speaker A: So that's the one thing that's really cool about V four. The other thing that you touched on, right, is gas fees. We were just talking about the old pool together. Had another problem, which was that each prize pool was its own independent entity. And so you could join on Polygon, but you'd be joining the prize pool on Polygon, and that had a much smaller prize than the ones on Ethereum. With a new pool together, it's all one prize pool, regardless of what chain you join on. So you can deposit on Polygon, take advantage of the really low gas fees, and have the same chance to win the same prizes as our on.
00:09:07.230 - 00:09:37.830, Speaker B: Oh, that's cool. That's a big wait. I want to make sure I'm understanding that. Yeah. Before I've participated in pools on Ethereum, but also on polygon, and those were like everything in Defi, it's been fragmented. I'm not benefiting from the greater liquidity, let's say, on Ethereum, if I use ave on Polygon. But in this case, you are now combining all of that.
00:09:37.830 - 00:09:41.110, Speaker B: We're playing the same pools across different chains.
00:09:41.610 - 00:09:53.702, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll talk about it from a tech perspective. If you deposit on polygon, your money is stored on polygon. It's still non custodial.
00:09:53.766 - 00:09:54.346, Speaker B: That makes sense.
00:09:54.368 - 00:10:01.766, Speaker A: So it's still secure in that sense. But the prizes move across the chains, and so I think it'll be helpful.
00:10:01.798 - 00:10:08.830, Speaker B: For me to share my screen to show. Please. That would be great. This is cross chain Defi, what you guys are enabling.
00:10:09.170 - 00:10:17.470, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's like the first DeFi protocol. Obviously there's bridges, but I think this is the first DeFi protocol that actually has cross chain execution.
00:10:17.550 - 00:11:03.774, Speaker B: And obviously, in case if anyone hears that term, it'll become eventually a term that no one will even talk about because we will see money, Legos being used across the different chains. The best other example of this is there's a stablecoin lending earning protocol where you deposit on Ethereum. Or maybe in the future it would be something like, I don't know, avalanche or Phantom. But the yield is being earned on Terra, so that's orion money. This is the first example I've seen since they only launched a few months ago. With that, too, which it's been cool to watch it. This is where now you're catering to these different chains.
00:11:03.774 - 00:11:19.300, Speaker B: I can enter from, let's say, polygon or Ethereum, but I benefit from the total liquidity that pool together is aggregating across Polygon, Ethereum and so on. That is cool, man. I did not realize you guys. Okay, sorry. Keep going.
00:11:20.150 - 00:11:44.666, Speaker A: Yeah, this sort of shows. So, like, what you see here right now, there's $105,000 in weekly prizes. And each day you can see sort of the breakdown. So each day there's like one $2,500 prize, 4003 $100 prizes, and 683 $10 prizes. And these prizes, they will change. This is controlled by governance, by the pool token holders. They decide what these are, and so they will change over time.
00:11:44.666 - 00:11:57.934, Speaker A: So that's what the prizes are per day. And so you can see here, I can just switch, right? I can go. I want to deposit on Ethereum. It's the exact same prizes. It's the exact same prize. Obviously, it's going to cost me a lot more money. $100 to deposit.
00:11:57.934 - 00:12:27.366, Speaker A: Or I can deposit on polygon and pay two cent and have the same chance to win the same prizes. It doesn't matter which network you're on. So the other thing, I'll show real quick, too. It's a little bit different in terms. One thing that's different between v three and V four is with V four, the new pool together, you do have to come and check for your prizes, so I actually haven't checked yet. So I'll check for. This is for a couple of days ago, I guess Monday.
00:12:27.366 - 00:12:40.398, Speaker A: See if there's a prize that I won on Monday. Okay, so I actually won a prize. Okay, so I won $110 on Monday. That's really cool.
00:12:40.484 - 00:12:58.354, Speaker B: Wow, that's pretty cool. That's funny, since I've not won, I was like, I don't know what it looks like. I did see Evan van Ness won a while ago, and I was like, oh, how delightful. Because he had kept money in there, too, for quite a while. That's so cool.
00:12:58.392 - 00:13:28.800, Speaker A: Yeah, he's won a few times. So I don't have any deposits on Polygon. So you can see I don't have anything to check here, but I have some deposits on Ethereum, so that's why I won. But I can seamlessly deposit on polygon or Ethereum and have the same chance. And the next network that's being worked on and assuming that governance approves, it will be avalanche. That will be added here, too. That is the cross chain, actually, I'll stop there.
00:13:28.800 - 00:13:34.900, Speaker A: That's how the cross chain stuff works. Yeah, it's really awesome.
00:13:36.310 - 00:13:52.740, Speaker B: That is really cool. Okay. I'm actually looking at pulled together right now. Just trying to make sure you can use it across Ethereum, polygon, BSc, binance, smart chain, or celo. Right. Those are the four different.
00:13:53.350 - 00:14:08.746, Speaker A: But those are. That's the thing. I was. Let me share my screen, too, and show that, because I want to clarify that. So those are the V three ones. These are the ones that you can join on sello, on Ethereum, on finance, smart chain, et cetera. But this one at the top, this.
00:14:08.768 - 00:14:12.102, Speaker B: Is the one that is the multi chain one. That's the biggie.
00:14:12.246 - 00:14:24.080, Speaker A: This is the biggie that I was just showing. So if you want to navigate to it, that's how you would do it. You would go here, you click deposit USDC, and that navigates you to the V four. That's how people can access this.
00:14:25.750 - 00:14:31.940, Speaker B: Holy cat. Wait, and then. Am I misunderstanding to the right.
00:14:33.990 - 00:14:34.306, Speaker A: Where.
00:14:34.328 - 00:14:55.558, Speaker B: We were looking at the multi chain there a moment ago? Actually, I can just share my screen here. Oh, you got it. Go ahead, share yours again. Yeah, I just want to make sure, because there was an APR to call out there. In terms of USDC, is that available on all of the different chains? Like, if you deposit, are you earning? Is that the pool token that we're earning?
00:14:55.734 - 00:15:27.826, Speaker A: No. So that's a great question. This has 33% prize APR. Okay, I want to clarify because it's a little bit of a confusing term. We're trying to figure out what the best way to talk about it, but basically what that means is you don't earn that APR if you deposit. What that is a representation of is essentially how big the prizes are relative to the deposits that are deposited. And so basically, 33% is what all of the deposits are earning.
00:15:27.826 - 00:15:57.166, Speaker A: But that's distributed in prizes. And so obviously it's nonlinear. So some days you're going to get. I just showed, some days you're going to get $10, some days you're going to get $100. Some days you're going to get $2,500, hopefully. So it's distributed, but it is, mathematically speaking, at least over time, your expected APR, the APR you earn would converge to that number. That's how it would work.
00:15:57.166 - 00:15:58.400, Speaker A: Mathematically speaking.
00:15:58.770 - 00:16:27.110, Speaker B: I get you. Yeah. Because there is an assumption of what prizes they would win based on the probabilities, and that's what you're modeling out there. This is really interesting. So I need to move my money in V three over, just like double checking where. And so when you enter, pull together. If you have money in V three, it'll basically prompt you, it looks like, at the very top, to deposit or to migrate.
00:16:27.530 - 00:16:50.206, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely like a phase. I'm going to just pause my screen sharing again. So it's definitely sort of a phased approach here. I mean, the thing is, the pools get, the protocol is truly decentralized. And the blessing and the curse of that is that no one can access your funds. So if you deposit into the protocol, no one can access them. It's like uniswap is the same.
00:16:50.206 - 00:17:36.030, Speaker A: Right. No one can upgrade those. So the blessing is that is a much more secure, and that's the promise of decentralized finance. That's the whole point of it. The curse is that there's not a way for us to, there's no us to upgrade your deposit and turn it into V four. We are still trying to work out, like, the community is still talking a lot about what's the best way to help people who are in v three be able to migrate, because obviously the gas fees are prohibitively expensive. Speaking just personally, I would basically say, unless you have $50,000 or more, probably just don't deposit on Ethereum, just use polygon.
00:17:37.810 - 00:17:51.122, Speaker B: I was going to say I use Polygon regularly. Now I'm just kind of sharing this because I think people wonder for those that have been in the space versus those that are brand new.
00:17:51.256 - 00:17:51.940, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:52.470 - 00:18:28.894, Speaker B: I still have a majority of my money on Ethereum. It's partially because I'm able to pay for the benefit of the security and the decentralization aspects. But this is one of those examples where before I used to tell friends, like, well, the problem is with pool together is the prizes aren't as big on, let's say, Polygon. But now that multichain offering is huge. If you can earn the same prize, it doesn't matter. So if you got money on Polygon, just use it there. That's not financial advice, but it's a game.
00:18:28.894 - 00:18:32.926, Speaker B: Whatever. We're talking about a game. So that's a game, right.
00:18:32.948 - 00:19:24.100, Speaker A: Well, that brings up a good point that we should always touch on whenever we talk about this stuff, is just overall, obviously, security. And when we say pool together is no loss, that's obviously in reference to all the smart contracts functioning in the way they're intended to function. But just like anything in Defi, there is risk, and you should understand what those risks are. And the community has put together a lot of documentation to explain specifically what risks there are. And the risks of using pool together are very minimal compared to a lot of other Defi protocols, but you should still understand them. And so going to docs pool together, there's a whole section there on risk, and you can sort of read it and understand. So, anyways, I always just like to make sure people are aware of that because we're still at the frontier here.
00:19:24.950 - 00:19:37.174, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. It's like no loss pending some sort of unforeseen exploit, which, thankfully, knock on wood, we haven't had with pull together.
00:19:37.292 - 00:19:41.560, Speaker A: Right. Pull together has never had any of those issues, which is great.
00:19:43.530 - 00:19:59.642, Speaker B: Anything else that has been updated recently? I know Cello being added was. I don't know if that was a part of V Four, but I had recognized that that was newer. Another, cheaper cello is another great network to use.
00:19:59.776 - 00:20:43.318, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great network, and those are good places to save your money as well. You can get high return. That's not the part of the V four network yet, but that will likely, assuming that there's a vote and governance proves that that would happen as well. Like I said, the next one is avalanche. The other big change that's taken place with the V Four is it's really like what we call whale proof. So another complaint that people had with V three was that too many large depositors were monopolizing the prizes, and it was a valid complaint. And so v four fixes that primarily, like we were just talking about, by just having way more prizes so that you have a much more even distribution across all depositors.
00:20:43.318 - 00:21:22.630, Speaker A: But there's also a prize cap. That's another thing that governance controls. And so right now, that's set to two. And so what that means is no matter how large of a deposit you have, you can't claim more than two prizes per draw, which is every day. So that's another thing that is in the V four protocol that governance controls to sort of try to mitigate the impact of super large depositors. And obviously, large depositors are good because that's what generates large prizes, which is what people want, but you just want to have that balance so that the large depositors don't win all the prizes. And that's really what was happening in V three, is they weren't winning all the prizes, but they were winning 95%.
00:21:22.630 - 00:21:26.520, Speaker A: And if you're a small depositor, then 95% feels like 100%.
00:21:27.210 - 00:22:03.342, Speaker B: Yeah. It's been a privilege to sort of watch how you've tried to troubleshoot all of this, because I just remember when the prizes were small, it was like $100 a week. We were all excited and they were growing, and then it got to 1000, and we were all sort of celebrating that. And we talked about the flywheel many times before. This is probably like the fourth or fifth interview done. We talked about that flywheel of like, the more people who participate, the larger the prizes. The more excited other people get, the more they deposit the larger prizes.
00:22:03.342 - 00:22:49.060, Speaker B: So it's this awesome flywheel. The fact that we have prizes going out, it's the weekly prize, the multichain prize being over $100,000, I mean, that's life changing money for most people, especially, too, considering pool together has built communities outside of, I think, like some of the more privileged parts of the world. How is that going? I'm curious, any updates there? Has the Dow hired any core team members on the ground in different parts of the world to try to build more community, or can you geographically track? I don't know if one community is growing faster than another.
00:22:51.590 - 00:23:26.560, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's a good thing to touch on the pool together. Dow is really awesome. There's a lot of people contributing. And yeah, we actually just announced today there's like a new portuguese newsletter, a pool together community newsletter. There's one in Portuguese, there's one in Chinese, there's one in English, and there's one in Spanish. And I think that just shows you the diversity of the people who are contributing to the protocol, that they're all translating this and using it. It's always been an important priority for us to, one, be a place that's financially healthy for people, and two, welcome people.
00:23:26.560 - 00:24:33.490, Speaker A: When you create a culture like that, you naturally attract people who are newer to the ecosystem, and that's what's happened so far. There was actually a really cool, on that note of like, we have an interesting discussion right now because in the Dow we're talking about, should we add a new prize tier, a really small one, that's like one dollars, but there's like 5000 of them every day. So it'd basically be like, it's a really small prize, but you would like win, you'd have a super high chance of winning at least a dollar every day. And there's a lot of people in the community who are like, actually, because some people were like, well, one dollars is not enough, it's not interesting. And some people are like, actually, where I'm from, one dollars is a lot of money and winning one dollars in a day would be a big deal. And so it's really interesting when you have that global community to hear different people's perspectives and try to build something that's going to help the most people. I was also going to flag, there's a really cool argent put out a really cool article from a guy in Argentina who got the uniswap airdrop from using pool together and also got the pool together airdrop and basically was like, this completely changed my.
00:24:33.490 - 00:24:54.570, Speaker A: So, you know, it's just a good reminder, I think I said at that time, which for people who are well off financially, Defi is sort of like a hobby or it can be like a hobby, but for people who aren't, it can be like a lifeline. It's literally a lifeline. It's literally like their ticket to financial health and financial freedom.
00:24:55.310 - 00:25:07.950, Speaker B: Yeah, it's worth just echoing that sentiment. I remember when I was at Zapper, I just had the chance to talk to people constantly in our discord.
00:25:08.290 - 00:25:09.546, Speaker A: I love zapper.
00:25:09.738 - 00:26:04.414, Speaker B: Yeah. And it was really always, I think, heartwarming to hear what a difference Defi had made in some of their lives. And again, it's very simple, like cutting through some of the flowery language bullshit that I'm kind of like adding to. It's just about someone being able to first get exposure to the US dollar despite everyone sort of know, talking about inflation and so on with the US dollar for some life rest turkey or. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then beyond that, if you have access to that, or if you have access know digital assets here, that know outperforming the US dollar over time, the ability just to be able to earn yield on that. So yeah, it's wild, those airdrops.
00:26:04.414 - 00:27:17.682, Speaker B: I still think going off course, off of away from pull together V four for a second airdrops and DFI, it's just the greatest risk reward for anyone who's going to participate. The fact that you might get this larger reward in return for a small amount of effort. Do you think that. So pull together's pool distribution was, I'm not just waxing poetic on this. I think it was applauded as one of the best distributions. One of the reasons was because the way you weighted it, it was like folks who had put in very relatively small amounts of money going back to the beginning were rewarded for keeping it in there for a really long time. And I'm curious, if you had to launch all over again today, do you think that that's the right way to go about it? Because I do think newer protocols that are launching, they're under pressure to create the perfect token distribution.
00:27:17.682 - 00:28:11.020, Speaker B: And without naming names, just obviously, there's been a few lately that have really gotten a lot of heat. So, anyways, yeah, I'm curious if you feel like there were some best practices established by the team back then, or basically if someone risks putting their money into a DeFi protocol, how do you think about that? Do they absolutely deserve the airdrop? Or. I've noticed ENs had a really beloved sort of airdrop that just happened, but they did prioritize those, I think, who were more active more recently, and I think they talked about the engagement there, not wanting to overreward those who had been around five years ago but haven't been around recently. Anyway, just curious how you think about those sorts of design issues.
00:28:11.550 - 00:28:43.442, Speaker A: Well, I'm definitely pro builder, and so I'm very pro whatever people who are contributing to the protocol think is best for that protocol. And so I would never fault anyone if someone said, hey, we're not doing any retroactive airdrop. I would never fault someone for that, because if that's what they think is best for the protocol that's being built, I think that's great. Like, experiment with it. I'm definitely that, but I'm also very pro actual decentralization of ownership. That's the whole promise. Right.
00:28:43.442 - 00:29:16.186, Speaker A: And so even if you're not going to do an airdrop, you got to figure out how to do that. You got to figure out how to do decentralization of ownership. And that was why, when we were originally thinking, okay, how do we decentralize a protocol? It was really important for us that the number one recipient of tokens would be community members. So the largest distribution went to the retroactive airdrop. 15% of all the tokens went to the retroactive airdrop. In comparison, about 7% went to investors who had invested in the protocol.
00:29:16.378 - 00:29:17.070, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:17.220 - 00:29:57.738, Speaker A: So that's like twice as many went to those people. I guess what I'm getting at is I'm talking more about what's the ethos and what's the spirit that you're trying to uphold. I think the ethos and spirit that I'm advocating for is like, look, respect the people who are putting in effort to get this off the ground so that it can be decentralized. And two, respect the dream of Defi, which is true decentralization of ownership and control. And so our retroactive airdrop is the best way to achieve that? I don't think so. There's probably better ways, but it's one of the best ways we've found so far. It's probably not as a story that gets told.
00:29:57.824 - 00:30:20.674, Speaker B: I mean, what you just said about that person in Argentina, one person we're talking about, but I think it's about, to me, like a token at the end of the day is a marketing tool. We can talk about the decentralized governance and so on, but I think it is unintentionally or intentionally like the greatest marketing tool.
00:30:20.872 - 00:30:50.250, Speaker A: But that's a buy, that's a byproduct. It's a byproduct because it does represent ownership and control. And I think the ownership and control is what gives it. That's why it's a powerful marketing tool, because what's more powerful than ownership and control? I do think, yeah, it's a marketing tool, but I see that as a byproduct of what it is more fundamentally.
00:30:51.950 - 00:31:52.266, Speaker B: One other question for you, more as like a founder that I'm sure other founders sort of look to try to learn lessons from. If you were doing a token distribution today, one of the things that every protocol has had to struggle through is you do a liquidity mining sort of program, let's say. And obviously it gets a lot of attention because it's a source of yield. And when the token is being rewarded in an effort to distribute the token and decentralize governance at the same time, you can have folks just picking up that token to just dump it, right? Have any thoughts lately on ways to solve for this? Maybe any money Legos that you really like or just like ideas or strategies for? How do you reward that token, decentralized governance, but try to prevent, I want to say, just the farming and dumping that can happen with mercenary farming.
00:31:52.458 - 00:32:34.746, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. I would say I'm very bearish on liquidity mining. I think it's sort of dead. I think, again, it's one of those things that worked really well, but it's become highly monopolized by people who aren't there because they care about the protocol, they're there because they want to get a token and sell it. And so for pool together, V four for our community, there has been several governance votes to reduce the amount of pool distribution that was happening to farming. And actually with the V four launch, there's no, as of today, there's no pool distribution going to any farmers. And so there was a narrative out there for a little while of like, oh, urine is like winning all the prizes and taking all the pool.
00:32:34.746 - 00:32:46.180, Speaker A: And that was actually never really true and it ended a long time ago. But that's sort of a damaging narrative because people are like, oh, well, I don't want to participate in something if urine is just farming it. Right?
00:32:46.950 - 00:33:41.890, Speaker B: Yeah, curve suffered from this as well, a long time ago. I mean, kind of pull together curve, you guys have only been around for like two years or something, but it feels like it's been so much longer. And I remember curve really suffered from basically the farming and dumping urine strategies at the time. One thing that I've picked up on is I don't think we can stop just someone who mercilessly is going to farm and dump. But I do think it speaks to a lack of utility with some tokens not speaking to pool or any others. But in general, I think that there's a reason that some of these tokens, they get farmed and dumped. And I think it's the goal of the community, the Dow, the co founders, to create utility around that.
00:33:41.890 - 00:35:04.686, Speaker B: And I think one good example is it takes some bravery right now to create a token that allows for a claim on fees. But I think my argument has been we all, of course, worry about trying to stay within compliance with really antiquated laws in a world that is radically changing with digital assets. But at the same time, if you have a token that is deemed to have no utility, then, I mean, your project is going to die anyways. And so it's a really frustrating sort of conundrum, I think, that dows and tokenized communities sort of face nowadays. My takeaway from this is if you can continually provide reason to hold that token beyond just governance, I think there's a fighting chance, again, you're not going to overcome just profit, maximalism and dumping. But I like these programs where you earn the token and then there's an incentive to stake it or something to lock it up longer. And I think curve has been a really interesting example of, in full disclosure, I clearly hold curve, I earned it in their airdrop and still hold it.
00:35:04.708 - 00:35:07.118, Speaker A: But I did too. And I still have some too.
00:35:07.204 - 00:35:33.480, Speaker B: That's my disclosure, not a recommendation to buy the curve token. But curve is really clever because they forced everyone to lock up the token to vote. Voting has huge ramifications on the yield that's being earned and it's a wild sort of model. But back to pull together. Layton, is there anything else you think we should cover here in terms of V four? Like any other updates that we might have glossed over?
00:35:34.410 - 00:36:02.234, Speaker A: I don't think so. I'll reiterate the summary. It's really awesome. And I think, like I said, pool together has been around for a long time. If you tried it in the past and you found the experience didn't meet your expectations, you should definitely give it another try because this is like a way, way better orders of magnitude better. And the other thing, I'd say dows are a buzword right now. Decentralization is sort of a buzzword, but the pool together has a real dow.
00:36:02.234 - 00:36:05.270, Speaker A: It has a real decentralized protocol. And so if you are interested, there's.
00:36:05.290 - 00:36:37.674, Speaker B: Some 8000 holders right now. I was just checking that as we were talking. So there's 8000 unique wallets that hold it. I don't know what the benchmark is supposed to be, but I still tend to think about a few thousand is on the small end and then approaching 10,000. I'm like, all right, we're in the upper echelon of token holders and also I'm excluding the outliers, the ridiculous sort of like Shiba new type stuff out there. Yeah.
00:36:37.792 - 00:36:43.354, Speaker A: I wonder how many holders they have. Actually, I'd be very curious. That's probably the most held token in all of Ethereum other than ETH.
00:36:43.402 - 00:36:51.630, Speaker B: It's probably insane. I'm looking it up right now. Shiva, there's almost 995,000 holders.
00:36:53.410 - 00:37:06.920, Speaker A: That probably gives you a pretty good approximation of how many people are on Ethereum. 70% of all people who are active on Ethereum probably hold that token. I personally don't hold that token, so I'm not shilling it.
00:37:08.170 - 00:37:48.590, Speaker B: No, I don't either. But for what it's worth, I recognize we're in that meme of the market cycle where it shows the person on the left side who's like, doge is a good, yeah, doge is a meme coin. And then up top it's like, but the token supply is ridiculous. All the rational sort of analytical thoughts. And then on the right it's just like, doge is a meme coin. Yeah. You know, what, if anything, actually, I heard the other day there was 2000 people in a DFI Twitter spaces on a Friday, which I thought was just nuts.
00:37:48.590 - 00:38:28.426, Speaker B: I was like, wow, that's crazy. This is cool to see because it felt like we kind of cooled off and everybody was focused on NFTs. And I think it was Sonny. I can never pronounce his name correctly, his last name, but Sonny from Osmosis Dex, which is built on Cosmos. I'm not sure I agree with this, but it made me think that he said that he thinks that Doge might have introduced more people to crypto in the last year than anything else. And I was like, I would be open to that being potentially true. That's hard to debate.
00:38:28.426 - 00:38:41.540, Speaker B: I actually have a lot of friends too, who never listened to me about, we would talk about Ethereum, bitcoin, defi, ignored everything. And then next thing I know, they're like, hey, man, how do I buy doge? I'm like.
00:38:43.830 - 00:38:46.466, Speaker A: Memes are powerful. Memes are very powerful.
00:38:46.658 - 00:38:47.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:48.650 - 00:38:50.230, Speaker A: Especially in bull markets.
00:38:50.650 - 00:39:23.614, Speaker B: Well, hopefully more folks latch onto the meme around being able to play a no loss savings game with just, you know, reminder, everyone. You can check out app pooltogether.com or go to the main website, pulltogether.com, and then you can follow pull together and Layton on Twitter. Also, their discord link is just, you know, that's one of the best ways to get, yes, hop in. It's, you guys are so approachable. Actually, if I have questions, that's normally where I would end up going.
00:39:23.614 - 00:39:45.960, Speaker B: And just reminder, if you enjoyed this, subscribe@defydad.com. We'd love to have you check out more videos, hit that subscribe button. And most importantly, actually, if you're building the next great DFI NFT Web three protocol, reach out to me and my team at Fourthrevolution capital Layton. Anything else you wanted to share before we go?
00:39:47.210 - 00:40:02.510, Speaker A: No, I don't think so. Just, yeah, get involved. Join the fun, join the community, give the feedback. And thanks for everybody for listening. And Defi dad, thank you, of course, for having me. Any important part of my defi journey?
00:40:03.490 - 00:40:43.690, Speaker B: Oh my God. Yeah. Total privilege. Yeah. I was like tweeting today about all the funny, stupid things that I've thought over the years just because everyone talks about why they're right all the time. And I was like, let me share with you all of the dumb things I've believed were true and eventually figured out weren't. But one of the few things I gave myself credit for is summer of 2019 when I tried pull together, which I think was probably more into August, September 2019, whenever you had launched that token sets compound man, again, you got to just try things to understand this space.
00:40:43.760 - 00:40:44.090, Speaker A: Yes.
00:40:44.160 - 00:41:02.320, Speaker B: But then more importantly, go work for a Dow. Oh, my God. There is no greater return than actually working in this space. The connections that you end up making and the opportunities that arise to work on solving real problems.
00:41:02.690 - 00:41:03.482, Speaker A: Totally.
00:41:03.626 - 00:41:37.910, Speaker B: I really think we've sort of downplayed defi over the last six months. I feel like it took a backseat to NFTs. But reminder, this is going to replace the entire back end of legacy finance, traditional finance. That's an enormous endeavor, and we've barely just begun. We're like two to three years into the, you know, get involved. Also, shoot me a direct message on Twitter. I love people reaching out, saying, I'm trying to get a job here, not quite sure where to look or I need a connection to so and so.
00:41:37.910 - 00:41:49.930, Speaker B: Really want to help others find jobs in this space. So. Anyways, Layton, thanks so much for your time. I'm going to end the broadcast here and we'll be in a green room. So bye, everyone. Have a great day. Happy Thanksgiving.
