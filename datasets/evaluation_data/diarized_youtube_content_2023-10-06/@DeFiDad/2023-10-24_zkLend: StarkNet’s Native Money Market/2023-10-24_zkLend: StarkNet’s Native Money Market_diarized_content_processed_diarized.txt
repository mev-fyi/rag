00:00:00.250 - 00:00:41.602, Speaker A: Today's show features ZK Lend, one of the new foundational DFI applications on the Ethereum. L Two Starknet ZK Lend is a money market where users can lend and borrow different assets like ETH wrapped bitcoin, stablecoins and Lido Steth. Launched in May 2023, ZK Lend currently makes up 20% of all total value locked on Starknet as the number one money market protocol. Having rewritten their smart contracts and completed a new audit, they just announced moving on to the next phase of their roadmap called Zklend Mainnet. In this episode, we'll interview the co founders about what differentiates zklend from its competitors and why you should pay attention to the rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem on Starknet.
00:00:41.666 - 00:00:59.210, Speaker B: I admit that we definitely have the advantage of building on the shoulders of giants because we were able to borrow a lot of their ideas, but I think in the next phase of ZK Lend, it's really about how do we make it like a next generation lending protocol, especially when it comes to scalability and privacy.
