00:00:03.320 - 00:00:06.460, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi dad.
00:00:27.540 - 00:00:28.144, Speaker B: It.
00:00:28.262 - 00:00:41.648, Speaker A: Oh, there we go. My video got delayed there. Hey, everyone. By the way, I'm just quickly rechecking my mic because it looked like it dropped off. We're all good. Hey, thanks for joining us. It is Tuesday, May 10, 2022.
00:00:41.648 - 00:01:31.484, Speaker A: Today we're going to talk all about a very new topic. I would classify it as like a new vertical or niche within the web3 space called Decentralized Science. And I'm thankfully joined here by Lawrence Ion and Vincent Weisser from Vita Dao, who are both founding stewards. It's interesting because my background actually is in chemistry, and once upon a time I was in a chemistry PhD program. So I'm very familiar with how challenging it is to get your research funded in the world of science. And so what Vita Dao is doing really stuck out to me because they're a bit like a venture Dow, but they focus on longevity research. And so I'm going to let Lawrence and Vincent tell their story today around Vitadao.
00:01:31.484 - 00:01:45.210, Speaker A: But I do want to more generally help others to learn about what is DSi sci short for decentralized science. So, guy, thanks for joining me. Welcome. How are you doing?
00:01:45.820 - 00:01:52.280, Speaker C: Great to be on, like big longtime fan of the podcast. So, yeah, amazing to chat.
00:01:53.020 - 00:02:18.530, Speaker A: This could be Dside dad in the future here, I might have to do a rebrand, hopefully. Yeah, sorry, Vincent, you were just saying. Yeah, dude. Welcome. And actually, either one of you could lead off with this. I'd like to just get a little bit more about your background. I think it's always a common starting point for anyone in the crypto or web3 space.
00:02:18.900 - 00:03:46.188, Speaker C: Yeah. So maybe my kind of brief story is that I was always kind of really interested in Ethereum ecosystem, really since the Dow. I put my first ETH in the Dow and was really excited by the idea of the Dow, which got me into crypto and Ethereum and actually kind of studied product and design and with my friend did a decentralized Ethereum exchange actually in 2017 called x Blue, and kind of at the same time really got pulled into it more out of curiosity and excitement into longevity, actually. I think Vita Lick actually really supporting it and writing about it got me more into it. So while I was working on the decentralized exchange, I actually went to a longevity research conference in my hometown in Berlin. And actually the first guy I bumped into was Vitalik. So it really was crazy coincidence kind of to see already the fields intersect, but then really kind of like spent most of my time in actually DeFi and crypto, but always wanted to do something in the DAO space and then got really kind of like Matt, Paul and Tyler that built a molecule more like as this platform to fund research with crypto and joined them to kind of coinitiate Vitadao when they had this early idea as well as the platform and kind of like DeFi primitives if you like, with an IPNft to fund research.
00:03:46.188 - 00:04:00.130, Speaker C: So that's how like got involved with Vitadao and kind of like on all different facets of it, from the product tokenomics side to launching initiatives with gitcoin and other things that we can talk about.
00:04:01.320 - 00:04:24.688, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome stuff. Vincent, what's your background? How did you ever get into crypto or ultimately into. Did I just meant to say. Did I just say, Vincent? Yeah, I'm a little rusty today. My mic wasn't working. Got home a little late from the dentist. Anyways.
00:04:24.688 - 00:04:31.230, Speaker A: Yeah. How about let's have Lawrence curious, what is your background getting into web3?
00:04:32.640 - 00:05:38.560, Speaker B: Well, my background actually, I'm a self taught computer scientist and self taught molecular biologist, if you can call, but yeah, no formal training. I'm just very curious about how biology works. Probably also because I've spent a lot of time in hospitals when I was a kid from like age six to I think 18, I have this rare genetic disorder of the bone. But I went into technology as I saw the biggest potential for impact, the highest leverage way to solve problems, initially as a programmer, but then I realized I need to be an entrepreneur to actually build things people want. But now I'm more of a longevity advocate. This new way of tackling age related disease and just new approach to medicine. And I'm also an investor.
00:05:38.560 - 00:06:09.204, Speaker B: And even though most of my career has been tech startups, but because I was in tech, I just heard about bitcoin. I think I was in first year of college, like 2012 or 13. I just liked the name. You could mine it on your laptop, just exchange it with friends. But when the first cycle, I think went to a thousand, I thought, it's crazy. So I kind of focused on tech startups and then I heard about Ethereum. Cool.
00:06:09.204 - 00:07:14.530, Speaker B: You can actually build stuff on it. Went to hackathons, even won a hackathon with my business partner Alex. And then, yeah, got in, got out and so on. And then finally I think I was at burning man and discussing with people to start a longevity Dow because I was getting more into longevity because I noticed that not only do we have maybe short to medium term benefits. Not only are 110,000 people dying every day of aging and millions more suffering, of course, hundreds of millions that are suffering in the last years, with grave implications to society, especially as we have an aging population and most of the kids are in the developing countries. But also, I think, because I'm just super excited to see the future, and I want intelligence, augmentation, brain machine interfaces, AI safety, all of those things I went deep into. But then I realized I might not make it to see that future happen.
00:07:14.530 - 00:07:34.650, Speaker B: Exciting. Good or bad? Who knows? Hopefully working towards making it be good. So that's why I think keeping us healthier for longer in a preventative way, by tackling aging itself, the root cause of most of these chronic diseases. That's why I'm fully dedicated to this.
00:07:35.340 - 00:08:09.184, Speaker A: So I think one puzzle piece to understanding what Vitadao is working on and what decentralized science is. You have to understand how grants work, or just in general, how research is funded. Either one of you want to jump into that and talk a bit about the legacy world of how this works? And also, too, I'd like to blend that with venture capital. Obviously, there's quite a bit of money that has been allocated in the past, but. Yeah, Vincent, go right ahead.
00:08:09.302 - 00:09:35.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the interesting bit is, of course, that there is a lot of biomedical research funding happening at kind of the state level. So kind of like in the US, it's like the National Institute of Health that I think. I don't know the exact numbers, but I think on the order of like 30 to 50 billion a year in biomedical science funding that they are basically giving to universities and academic institutions. And the interesting thing is, I think, to the one point that Lawrence raised is ultimately that longevity and treating and researching the root cause of most diseases, most, like age related diseases, is not the main funding target, or most of the funding goes to Alzheimer's or cancer, et cetera, but more as the symptoms instead of at the root cause of preventing cancer or Alzheimer in the first place. So I think it's like the paradigm is really not on treating the root causes of age related disease. But I think another really important thing to understand is ultimately that the NIH is like, I think, also falls under a lot of the cliches of a gigantic government funding body, that it's a bit bureaucratic, it's fairly slow, it's fairly conservative, and not like there's an extremely recent good read for people that are curious by an organization called newscience.org slash NIH.
00:09:35.480 - 00:10:21.132, Speaker C: It's a report basically on why the NIH as a funding body is incredibly broken. Mostly funds very old researchers, tenured professors with more like incremental research versus the breakthrough research in biomedical sciences. And I think then the course also to understand that it's one of the main and also only funding sources for a lot of people. So there is not that many alternatives to it. And kind of like venture backed biotechs and big pharma is kind of like downstream. So it's like basically taking some of that research and trying to develop it into therapeutics that actually reach humans. But basically big pharma and also biotech is not really engaged in the earliest stages of basic research, or even early stage biomedical research.
00:10:21.132 - 00:11:34.084, Speaker C: And the universities are not really optimizing for treating diseases. It's like the goal of a researcher or professor is not necessarily to lead to successful therapy. So I think a lot of these misalignments would often call it kind of like the value of death between initial funding and actually never reaching humans with those research efforts. So I think this is one interesting thing, but I think on the high level, which is fascinating, I think with longevity, is that it's like a fundamentally different viewpoint on how to treat disease and aging at the root cause. And I think the fascinating thing is this gigantic overlap in crypto of people like Vitalik recently, Brian Armstrong from Coinbase, Balaji and a bunch of others, Juan Beni from IPFS and Filecoin, jet McAlip from ripple and stellar, all getting behind this cause and becoming over the last, even like twelve months, the biggest private funders of the sector, which I think is like a fascinating trend. And Balaji made this really good tweet storm a while ago, basically saying, like, longevity has the potential to be to traditional medicine what crypto is, traditional finance. It changes the terms of the debate and then goes into detail why.
00:11:34.084 - 00:12:15.132, Speaker C: Basically, what they share in common, like how basically longevity ultimately is like a similar radical rethink of what medicine should be, or could be, as DeFi is to centralized finance. So I think that's like an interesting also similarity between the two fields, which is fascinating to me. But yeah, the TLDR is kind of, we need more diverse funding sources. Like the state will go on funding research, but it's good to have alternatives that are way quicker, way less bureaucratic, way more risk taking and ambitious funding. Younger researchers, for example, as well. Yeah. So I think that's maybe the TLDr.
00:12:15.196 - 00:13:38.552, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't have any flashy stats to fire off, but I am aware the fiscal year 2022 budget for the NIH in the United States is 45 billion. And so the NIH has traditionally been this major source of funding for research, and if we break it down even further and dumb this down. So when I worked in an inorganic chemistry lab, our goal as a PhD student, or no matter what your position was, but at the time, I was a PhD student, our goal, of course, was to publish papers of new and interesting research. But I mean, truthfully, the professors that worked within our chemistry department, which was like, really, at the time, UC San Diego, I don't know, I think, was still roughly top ten, but kind of sits within that upper echelon with the likes of, like, a Berkeley and MIT and so on. At the end of the day, you're incentivized to do research on what will get funded. So there are brilliant people who are doing this sort of, like, cutting edge research on all sorts of different topics.
00:13:38.552 - 00:15:19.340, Speaker A: I mean, our research was related to trying to turn methanol back into a precursor for fuel. So, I mean, the idea, there's all sorts of interesting renewable energy research, and then in this case, obviously, we're talking with Vitadao specifically about longevity research. So more related to someone's mean, I can, I think, safely assume that the more niche of a research topic you're talking about, the harder it is to get that funding, because there's also peers who sit on different committees. So imagine you're competing for research grants, and there's other folks who have competed with you in the past or have whatever achieved sitting on these committees to decide where grants go. And so I'm not trying to paint it as, like, it's not a totally broken system, but it is very similar to the way that DeFI compares to traditional finance. You have something that's just much more capital efficient, and it allows you to, in this case, allow anyone to participate in a DAO. So if we're talking about Vita Dao and this new field of decentralized science, the idea that you can easily bring capital together and align people's interests through tokenized systems, that's really compelling, because now I would say you are further financializing a really important field of science, which traditionally, it's very gated.
00:15:19.340 - 00:16:40.464, Speaker A: As you pointed out, universities tend to thrive on the amount of research dollars they can bring in. And a lot of the research that is done, the innovations that come out of that have been, like, some of the most game changing parts of our life, whether it's making use of research that goes into computers back in the day or modern cell phones, there's a long track record of just how impactful those research dollars can be. So I guess I think what you guys have with Vitadao, what you've really brought to the forefront is what happens when you remove the permission that must be accessed to be able to invest in these different fields. What happens when you allow anyone to bring their money together and start to source new research projects that you can invest in, and in this case specifically, longevity research? Guys, anything else, though, historically, about funding that you think we should point out? I'm hoping we've painted a fair picture. Again, not trying to light the world on fire like it's totally broken, but it is very slow and inefficient compared to the way that Vita Dow is operating.
00:16:40.592 - 00:18:08.400, Speaker C: I think maybe two. I think interesting factors on the one is just like the time researchers spend on getting grants. So I think it's like 70% to 80% of their time they spend on writing grants and applying for getting money, basically. And for many grants, it takes months till they hear back and a ton of paperwork. And in our case, most of it is basically written proposal, which can be like one or two pages and then kind of like a zoom talk, literally, with the senior kind of researchers evaluating the research and then some discussions to rephrase it, and then it goes on chain. And in some cases, I think from application to getting funded and going through the whole governance process that people in Defi know from a discourse forum post to snapshot, it took like in some case, I think three to four weeks from getting funded, which I think is like one game changer, like just being way quicker and way less of a hassle to get the funding, and then also having a really aligned community getting behind a project, like wanting to host an interview with a researcher to understand the research versus a state filing the grant somewhere in some department, and no one of the public really gets to see or gets behind a research project. So I think it's also powerful to have a community of over 5000 people now that care about what gets funded and that get engaged on those initiatives.
00:18:09.060 - 00:18:56.400, Speaker A: And by the way, you all have just scratched the surface here with Vita Dow, because Vita Dow, and I'll let you correct me here if this is like misframing it, but I throw you under the umbrella of venture dows. And so if anyone's familiar with the Lao Flamingo Dow, the pleaser dow, this is a dow that is focused on, again, investing in longevity research. So it's very possible that in the future, I think we'll actually see labs that are owned by a dow or operated by a dow versus right now. This model to me is very familiar. It's a model that's thriving within the web3 space.
00:18:56.470 - 00:19:59.696, Speaker C: Totally. I think the interesting angle is maybe that we're like, I think trying to be even more than just a venture dow. So we are also, for example, hosting nonprofit initiatives. Like for example, we're hosting like a Gitcoin quadratic donation round for longevity initiatives that Vitalik matched with like almost half a million, I think. And kind of like that enabled kind of really also a positive sum like support of the ecosystem. So help fundraise on other projects that didn't even had any kind of research or IP path or one of the initiatives I had the most fun with was kind of like micro grants for people getting started in the field where basically we also through the gitcoin round, actually got donations, like 40,000 I think, roughly. And then within two or three days of applications funded students, two people in the lab, two PhDs that were working in the field since 20 years with like $500 to three K within two days, and globally throughout the world through just dispersing USDC, which I think is also a hassle to kick off without crypto.
00:19:59.696 - 00:20:34.320, Speaker C: It's global micro fellowships in a sense that also then bring in back the people in the community. So it's really like think about more than just funding like a VC and being a venture Dow it's really about. And also creating almost like a social Dow in a sense, or like community Dow, where people join to learn about research, join for a journal club, and also to meet kind of like minded people that really care about the research side, but also about crypto. So I think it's also one interesting part beyond the purely financial side of allocating funding.
00:20:34.980 - 00:21:10.270, Speaker A: Hey, Lawrence, can we take a step back then to talk more operationally about Vita Dao? And what's the day to mean? First off, where does the money come that is being used to fund? I'll let you guys talk through more of some of the examples, but to date you've funded ten different projects. My understanding is you've sourced around 200, which we'll talk a little more about the due diligence that has driven that process. But yeah, where does the money come in the treasury to be able to fund?
00:21:11.120 - 00:22:10.720, Speaker B: I'm really proud of the way Vidadao has launched. Smart contract deployed born, chooses 10% of its token supply to put it to what's called gnosis auction, a fair auction. Everyone bids on buying these tokens, governance tokens that give you a vote in what the organization does. Everyone, including, of course, us, there was no presale, there's no such thing as an investor. And at the end of the auction, everyone got the same price. And after that there was a vote, of course, to give a budget to working groups, to service providers, and enable us to go and incentivize people to do this work. And yeah, we have these amazing network effects.
00:22:10.720 - 00:23:08.160, Speaker B: So in a way it's just people pulling together their money and then deciding where to allocate it. But unlike a VC fund, which is probably hard to join, you have to apply. You might not be sure if you want to work for someone or work for a VC per se. Also, of course, specifically in longevity, I think it doesn't really have that much impact. That's why I spent quite a few years just getting to know the industry and I thought, I'm going to be a VC. But it just seemed like there's so many new VC funds all the time in longevity, but so few startups. And so the way Vidada is doing, and this is really important because NIH has this subset, NIA, national institutes of aging, and it has lot less research funding than say cancer or other areas, which aging is kind of the cause of all of these.
00:23:08.160 - 00:24:07.350, Speaker B: But then even there like 80% or more is Alzheimer's research. So you can just call it national institutes of Alzheimer's now and then only like two or 5% max to the actual biology of aging. The rest is sociological things and research on how to make the elderly more comfortable, or things like that, and what benches to put in. So Vidadao is sort of coming in with this ipnft to fund things when they're still in an academic lab, usually early stage research and incubate it to bring it to a stage where it has generated some IP so that a new co or a startup can be spun out. And then it's ready for these VCs angels. It's de risked enough for them. And partners like Apollo Health Ventures, for example, can then go and do the company building and spin it out, or of course from our community with our huge network effect.
00:24:07.350 - 00:25:05.540, Speaker B: We always get entrepreneurs from other fields, or biotech operators or programmers or anything, just wanting to get involved in this field, because it is still usually dismissed by the incumbents. It's just like web3 and D five. I think it's really important. It's really powerful the way we do it, especially for sourcing. You don't need anyone to tell you what to do, you just go ahead, talk to people in longevity, go to conferences, read papers, whatever you want to do. Just cold email someone because you want to help them. And then of course you also get maybe $500 or Vita tokens, $1,000 worth, for example, of Vita tokens for just recommending a project to us, of course, if it's relevant and it kind of checks the boxes.
00:25:07.080 - 00:25:43.910, Speaker A: Yes. So a few other simple stats to help people understand the progress you've made. So we mentioned there was 200 projects sourced, ten projects funded. I'm guessing the 5000 plus community members is a nice looking round number. So that's probably gone up as well. Around $2 million has been deployed. So is that meaning, is your average check size for projects around $200,000? Or can you tell me more about what's the largest check that you've written so far? Maybe what's the smallest check?
00:25:47.000 - 00:26:28.272, Speaker B: Yeah, our sweet spot is really at the 250K level. We have gone quite up and down. It really depends on a case by case basis. We do prioritize applications that have a lower ask, of course, like when people are efficient and don't take too much overhead and things like that. I think the smallest, maybe like 30K, I'm not exactly sure. And I'm only talking about projects that we funded in exchange for IP. Or we have also the Vitality Healthspan foundation, which is related and gets funding from Vidadao and then it purchases equity in some companies.
00:26:28.272 - 00:26:33.750, Speaker B: So I think the 30K was in a company around there.
00:26:35.240 - 00:26:47.688, Speaker A: Guys, tell me more about how deals are actually sourced. I'd love to talk about that and then more about the due diligence that actually goes into that.
00:26:47.854 - 00:27:02.190, Speaker B: So we have this bounty and we hope people kind of go ahead and source for us, but we also, of course, internally use our network and ask everyone and give away these bounties as well.
00:27:02.640 - 00:27:07.592, Speaker A: I would imagine you're probably turning into a magnet already for deals.
00:27:07.656 - 00:27:20.800, Speaker B: Yeah. People also apply, of course, just on the website, randomly. We don't really know exactly. Actually. We should ask some of them we know, but yeah, I don't know about all of them, how they actually heard Bavida.
00:27:22.120 - 00:27:47.272, Speaker A: This is a harder one because I'm not familiar with how to compare what stage of funding these projects are in if I were to draw a parallel to venture and other crypto startups. So I guess I'll just ask, are you putting checks into projects earlier than what, let's say traditional funding?
00:27:47.416 - 00:29:08.132, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah. So we come in before, even before it's a startup and even if it's just a project, like an idea, but the researcher might have published in that area, maybe basic research, they really understand a mechanism and so now maybe they want to find a target and then find a drug to match that and actually have a therapeutic out on the market eventually that's what we really need to fund things that can generate IP. Most of the time they come with plans where probably not going to have valuable IP, but that's where the incubation part comes. So we form these squads and kind of work with the applicants to gather all the information and sort of ask follow up questions. And then we have sort of independent advisory board, senior advisors or scientific advisors that really are experts in the field scientifically, but also most of the time also in the IP aspect. And we really give valuable feedback. I've seen things actually be changed a lot and pretty quickly and really massively improve the R and D plan so that actually something valuable is actually built.
00:29:08.132 - 00:29:31.740, Speaker B: And then at the end of when the milestone is reached, we also have investors from other VC funds in the longevity space, because this is a small space and we all know each other, actually review these deals. So we know that they would be willing to invest if the experiment is successful. And of course we design them in such a way that it's quite derisked.
00:29:32.240 - 00:29:45.984, Speaker A: What would you say is the average timeline to cut a check and fund a project? Let's say someone fills out the form on the website. What's the average time to cut them?
00:29:46.022 - 00:30:21.420, Speaker B: A check between us and the researcher is not that much. It really depends on the project. Sometimes we might incubate it for longer, but unfortunately the timeline can be a few months, like three or four, because we do have to work with the TTO, the technology transfer office in the university most of the time, and they just don't have any incentive going back to the inefficiencies to move fast. They can take their time, they lose nothing, they have no reason to hurry.
00:30:22.880 - 00:30:24.796, Speaker A: Oh yeah, go ahead, Vincent. Sorry.
00:30:24.978 - 00:31:05.710, Speaker C: On the one quickest deal we actually had, extremely progressive tech transfer office. It was extremely eager to move this ahead quickly. I think usually they're more like bureaucratic and slow moving. So I think we in the best case can fund something like three to four weeks, which we did on the second project. But I think usually kind of like it's held back by the university, really straining the negotiations on the licensing of the research for a long time. But of course there's also ways to put pressure onto them and give them deadlines. But it's more on the tech trends office and the university to take longer than on us.
00:31:05.710 - 00:31:35.008, Speaker C: If we are decently convinced by the proposal and have reformulated, which cannot take a week or two to put it on chain in our governance forum, and then make an on chain snapshot vote. So that takes one week of governance discussion and then one week of on chain voting. So that's like two weeks. And then of course before that there's like one or two weeks of evaluating and writing up a proposal, but luckily.
00:31:35.104 - 00:32:22.964, Speaker B: We'Re working on disrupting that. So we have multiple ways of working with researchers. So that's like the sponsor research agreement as the default. But then we're enabling now working with biotechs as well. We can get a royalty agreement, maybe share some revenue, and they work better. But also in general, we can make a consulting agreement and have the researchers with their knowledge if possible. Of course, they get paid as consultants and then used CROs contract research organizations and other academic partners to do the research so that the university doesn't actually have any work on actual IP being done at their lab.
00:32:22.964 - 00:32:26.580, Speaker B: So they don't have any claim on the IP. It's all kind of outsourced.
00:32:30.360 - 00:32:42.312, Speaker A: Very cool. All making sense. I've got a few more rapid fire questions for you, just because I know we're going to be running out of time here shortly. Very briefly, what does the application process look like?
00:32:42.366 - 00:32:45.080, Speaker C: How does it work for the researcher.
00:32:45.580 - 00:32:52.460, Speaker A: Or for becoming a member broadcast for the, for the. Sorry for the deals that you end up funding.
00:32:53.120 - 00:32:55.116, Speaker C: Maybe Lawrence can take this.
00:32:55.298 - 00:33:06.400, Speaker B: Yeah, we have this button on the website. Apply for funding. Also we have their sourcing bounty. It's on our Twitter and probably going to.
00:33:06.470 - 00:33:08.752, Speaker A: What is that bounty like? How much is that worth?
00:33:08.886 - 00:33:22.150, Speaker B: $500 or now it's like $1,000 in beta tokens. And I think it ends on May 24. So you have another 14 days and then we might change it.
00:33:24.460 - 00:33:29.496, Speaker C: Everyone could suggest a project and claim basically tokens for suggesting it.
00:33:29.598 - 00:34:12.900, Speaker B: And that's a great way of getting involved in Vitadao too, because it shows that you actually are resourceful and can get stuff done. Most people come and join and ask how they can contribute and we tell them that and then it is hard. But even if you're not successful there and show that you really care and you want to get it done, I think that's a good signal. And then more for the shepherding part, we call it. It does require more involvement from the existing members to kind of get involved in putting that deal together and doing all the necessary steps to move it forward towards negotiation and funding.
00:34:13.320 - 00:34:28.076, Speaker A: So for these early stage pre patent projects, which I think that probably describes all that you funded so far, who owns the IP, who will own the IP with Vita Dao funding them.
00:34:28.258 - 00:35:29.820, Speaker B: So usually, especially with american universities, they have to have ownership of the IP. But then the new code that gets spun out gets an exclusive license. So we negotiate that license agreement and we pre negotiate the terms of how that is going to look like. And having an exclusive license over a piece of IP is like quasi owning it, because yes, you can do whatever you want, build that product, get all of the value out of it, but of course, because you're licensing it from the university usually, or some from some IP holding company, then you give royalties back. And of course if you don't really do a good job, they can claw it back from you. That's why it's important to kind of hold the ownership in a separate entity. But sometimes, a lot of times we actually do get ownership with the first project and a few others, we definitely have the ownership, I think by the service provider molecule, which then sublicenses to the IP NFT owner.
00:35:29.820 - 00:35:52.880, Speaker B: It's like in that legal contract, it is referenced, okay, this address on the blockchain, and then the NFT of course, can hold research data encrypted, but also the legal contract. So kind of uniting the two, therefore allowing Dao treasury to hold real world IP rights. Legal rights, no.
00:35:52.970 - 00:36:28.604, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. I think you gave a really nice, clean, simple answer to really a very complicated question. That's part of what interested me and what you're all doing with Vita Dow. I think you're on the bleeding edge of another sort of web3 use case, and it just makes a lot of sense to a lot of really smart people. We probably should highlight some of the contributors you've attracted and some of the investors. Actually, do you want to rattle off some of the high profile folks that work with Vita Dow?
00:36:28.732 - 00:37:33.812, Speaker C: I think one of the interesting thing is you can see it also on the website on the community is just like I was surprised by how many amazing people from the crypto space, or also early Ethereum space are kind of really supportive, but then also how the most experienced gravity people come in into this organization. So people were running R and D for billion dollar biotechs for years. Joining our senior reviewer calls, not even asking for compensation, just out of curiosity, as well as a range also of junior and senior researchers. And I think more in the crypto space. It has been amazing to see my biggest heroes, from David Alex Balaji's to Brian Armstrong's from Coinbase, enthusiastically mentioning us and tweeting about us, joining us for conversations before we even started in Vitalik's case, which was amazing to see. But then there's also a bunch of interesting research just getting really involved. And then just like well known faces from the crypto ecosystem supporting us.
00:37:33.812 - 00:37:43.768, Speaker C: Like Stefan, the co founder of Canolas, for example, is like a big supporter and a bunch of people that I don't know if all them want to be mentioned.
00:37:43.934 - 00:37:47.324, Speaker A: By the way you just mentioned, that was Stefan from Gnosis, right?
00:37:47.362 - 00:38:13.540, Speaker C: Yeah, the CGO has been really supportive. He also backed alongside Vitalik and the Gitcon round. And then there's even back to Ethereum. Some of the biggest ethereum crowd sale buyers are also enthusiastic supporters that are just extremely, also just supportive in the background without making a lot of noise.
00:38:14.520 - 00:39:16.392, Speaker A: Yeah, you've definitely tapped into something that people really feel is impactful. This is something that I think a lot of the folks you mentioned, there's quite a few there who probably have more than enough money to live off of for many, many lifetimes. And I think this is one of the reasons we've all admired the likes of Vitalik and Balaji and Brian Armstrong too. I'm a big fan of just who he is and what he stands for, so it's really cool to see that. I know they've all been very intentional about wanting to find ways to give back, and to me this is one way to actually do it. And forgive me, I should know this already, I failed to do research on the Vita token itself, but I've understood it to be a governance token. As of today, I would use it to vote on whether or not to fund a project.
00:39:16.392 - 00:39:25.560, Speaker A: But am I missing any other aspects of the tokenomics or anything else that you think is worth highlighting around the tokenomics of Vita?
00:39:26.140 - 00:40:48.864, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's the main one. I think, of course it's also due to regulatory unclarity that a lot of projects are governance tokens, and pews focus on the governance part. And I think the interesting thing is, of course, ultimately we want also to, even beyond the regulatory, to really be extremely long term oriented. And instead of paying back any investors in five years to have those people that contributed to the Dow to basically reinvest, if we would ever sell any IP or license it, to reinvest into funding more research. And of course also in a sense, enabling the token holders, for example, early access or early insights into the research, which I think is also really interesting for many people, for a lot of people talking to also friends that supported it with big amounts that were early in crypto, they see it more like really as a donation and to become part of a science community, but of course it's a liquid donation so they can get out of their donation. Other than it's very different, I think, which I think is interesting for people to contribute money to a Dow that is really active and has also like a community that cares for the topic, involves them into these discussions versus just like wiring your money to a university and never hearing back from them. It's a much more engaging and natural way, I think, for crypto people to support science.
00:40:48.864 - 00:41:08.990, Speaker C: So, yeah, I was blown away also by some of the people I think they put in big amounts would never have funded research directly before because they didn't have access to do so or the scientific knowledge. So they were lacking in that sense, the longevity working group that we build up to help inform which research actually makes sense to fund.
00:41:11.680 - 00:41:15.740, Speaker A: I'm sorry, Lawrence, just quick question. How much money is in the Treasury?
00:41:20.340 - 00:41:25.664, Speaker B: I think Vincent, the tokenomics, I think he froze there.
00:41:25.782 - 00:41:35.088, Speaker A: Oh, there we go. Now he's back. Oh, Vincent, you were in a pretty funny position there. Hold on. Go ahead, start over. Yeah. How much in the treasury?
00:41:35.264 - 00:42:14.492, Speaker C: So we raised the full treasury in Ethereum. So I think we raised somewhat over 2000 Ethereum, if I'm correct, and then of course allocated some of it to funding research. So I think I'm undenominating it in the east for simplicity, I think. So it's like somewhat like probably approximately like 1500 e or something. So of course, depending on ETH price, we also have some stable coins, but ultimately we also get contributions in USDC, but the initial ethereum contributions are still in ETH. So it's of course somewhat fluctuating, but then of, yeah, we also fundraise more. So it's like the idea is to just have continuous contributions.
00:42:14.492 - 00:42:49.272, Speaker C: But of course, like Lauren said, really with the ethos to start with, like a venture, there are really contributions by the community that made all the decisions. Literally. I put in my own money in the Genesis sale, received zero tokens in the initial genesis, and then the governance basically decides, okay, those core people to, there was a governance proposal, but people could have voted no on any of it or discussed it. So it's like think a really fair launch was just completely 100% governed by the people contributing the capital, which I think is powerful.
00:42:49.416 - 00:43:54.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I think last I looked it was like 7 million considering with all the ipnfts. So if you assume that everything we've funded is at the same sort of value, then it would be that. But of course I'm one of something that hits 7 billion people and could be billions or trillions of dollars, right. So actually having a vote and governing what we do with that, I think people find that valuable and I think they will even more. And also all kinds of other potential things that we might do like early access to certain trials or these iPnfts. Really interesting where we had this framework on our blog published of fractionalizing them. That might be a huge benefit and unique sort of access to the ones that are holding the tokens to have these friends to become friends of the specific research projects, whichever they might want to help govern with us.
00:43:56.740 - 00:44:03.040, Speaker C: We have the ENS Vitadao ETH. So you could literally go to ether scan, type in Vitadao ETH and you see the treasury.
00:44:03.120 - 00:44:09.190, Speaker B: But we also have value like except, right, that's not value there in there.
00:44:09.880 - 00:44:56.980, Speaker C: But then also we're even looking into we're recently teamed up with Prime Dao and did like a token swap. Now there's like a proposal with Bankless Dao and we're planning to do a proposal with Gitcoin and with also just like joining other projects and which is also really fun and powerful. It's almost like these Dao Dao relations emerging other projects and now like Prime Dao that is doing cool projects really is building for our use case and takes our user feedback in a sense into account. And we're economically aligned because we swapped our tokens. And similarly for balancer and a bunch of other projects we're fairly active also collaborating with other projects that share the excitement, like also Bangladesh now recently.
00:44:57.560 - 00:45:49.024, Speaker A: So cool. It's just so cool. I can briefly describe that when I was in grad school, most of our workday was like a very old school sort of office. You worked in a lab and you have meetings in person because your whole team works out of that lab. So this is a very traditionally research at least it's like an office job. You work out of a very tight sort of workplace and you're limited in terms of being able to collaborate with people across the world. Not to compare apples with oranges.
00:45:49.024 - 00:46:48.936, Speaker A: Here again, I think you guys operate more like a venture Dow and I'm thinking more about what's it going to mean when all parts of sciences are able to take advantage of aligning everyone's incentives through tokenized systems. And it's a system too, that relies very much on the universities, all of the research too, that gets published. I mean, it's just insane, like the way they have to pay for these subscriptions. And thankfully it's all moved online now. But even many years ago, we were still having to access printed versions of certain journals, chemistry journals, biojournals and so on. So anyways, long story short, you've really identified a very important part of society that was just like very ready to be disrupted by web3. And I just threw a bunch of buzwords in there.
00:46:48.936 - 00:47:35.416, Speaker A: But it's such a neat fit that you and Vita Dow have identified. One last thing I want to end on then is really just about how anyone can get involved. I do want to clarify for anyone watching this too. We're recording again on what, May 10, 2022. This isn't a recommendation or endorsement to buy the Vita token. I am just very genuinely curious about decentralized science. I personally don't own the Vita token, but I've been drawn to Vita Dow because of some common connections and just been really impressed by the team because I think you guys have been really like you've become more of a household brand name in this emerging space.
00:47:35.416 - 00:47:42.516, Speaker A: So anyways, yeah. Vincent Lawrence, how should people get involved?
00:47:42.628 - 00:49:14.804, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there are two different ways. I think the easiest, and I think most projects on DAos is literally to join the discord, introducing themselves and then like Lauren said, recommending projects and getting involved on writing an article or supporting on specific aspects. So we're always looking for desks for designers for specially researchers et, but literally everyone kind of one could imagine, I think maybe two. I think also puzzle pieces or shoutouts I want to give is on the one side with the IP NFT, which molecules building where I'm also involved really trying to build like a new Lego block for DFI to enable research funding beyond longevity to have this on chain almost like an ESC 20, like token standards for funding research, putting it into fractionalized ownership structures, like fractionalizing it, you can literally create a rari fuse pool around like an IPNFT. All those NFT financializations are also possible with an IPNFt. And then the other is actually one project that got spin out of Vitadao is lab Dao, which actually is building also as a DAO, kind of like the laboratory infrastructure on the bioinformatics side as well as literally wet lab execution side that people could go end to end from discovering an interesting molecule to doing the experiments fully from their command line behind a computer. Also through crypto incentives, like literally getting funding on molecule and doing the research on Labdal.
00:49:14.804 - 00:49:52.180, Speaker C: And basically that's like our vision is to also move beyond kind of like the purely physical pipetting and manual labor of research and really move it to the digital age as an ecosystem. I think a lot of those things are, of course, experiments. Some of them might work better than others. And I think with Vidadao itself, we really try to be a heavy adopter of these experiments, to collaborate with a gitcoin, to try out what Lassao is doing, and to just see what could a radically different path look like and to create almost these case studies of how could one end to end, do research differently.
00:49:53.240 - 00:51:04.776, Speaker B: Thank you. By the way, Defi, that if you're impressed with us, really impressed with some of the other team members, like Michael Stewart, Tim Peterson, and Sebastian Brunemeier, and professor. So Tim Peterson is an assistant professor at YSHU, for example. But we also have other sort of senior reviewers that are specifically focusing on the reviews, like David Wilson or even Morton Shabbainudson, the PI of the first project we funded. And hopefully when we fund a project, then we involve the person that gets funded to review further projects and we get these network effects, but also Kat and Inas and Tyler and Alex and so many other team members that you guys should meet. And I think this is relevant. I'm super glad we talk on this channel, because usually DeFi thinks, oh, what do I have to do with the real world? Or I think it's really important once it's going to really help DeFi, because the skeptics are looking at it and thinking, well, yeah, they're kind of innovating, but kind of playing within their own bubble there with the sort of like computer stuff.
00:51:04.958 - 00:51:06.170, Speaker A: That's why I love.
00:51:06.540 - 00:51:24.188, Speaker B: But then if DeFi takes off, right, or when it takes off with the real interaction of the real world, they might think, oh, so DeFi is also going to revolutionize the financial system. It just seems like everything is more down to earth.
00:51:24.364 - 00:52:00.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that Vita Dow also could be put under this umbrella of moonshot dows. So one that got a lot of headlines in the past year was constitution Dow. It was just such a crazy thing because they raised like $40 million in two weeks and almost bought a copy of the Constitution. Didn't work out as planned, but it's really cool. Then there's Krause Dow, which wants to own an NBA team or own at least a controlling share of an NBA team. And that's really cool. Again, like total fantasy to be able to own a tokenized piece of a professional sports team.
00:52:00.684 - 00:53:04.480, Speaker A: But then this to me, sits within that same sort of like crazy moonshot idea using a Dow. But it actually is addressing a very urgent need where there's researchers who are fighting for research dollars. And I don't know, as pessimistic as I've been at times about regulators, especially within the US, with DeFi, this to me is like another example of, like, this is what happens when you adopt digitally native finance and you stop worrying so much about all the controls, which I would argue have mostly failed in the legacy world given the fact that money is constantly being laundered by banks and criminals. Love to use fiat. So anyways, long story short, it's just so cool what you guys are working on. And I hope this is the first of many conversations we have. And then, reminder to everybody, they can learn more here@vitadao.com.
00:53:04.480 - 00:53:23.608, Speaker A: Follow Vitadao on Twitter. Guys, just thanks so much for your time. I'm going to end the broadcast here in a sec. And if you enjoyed this, you can subscribe at Defi. Dad, if you want to hear more interviews with brilliant folks like Lawrence and Vincent. And I'm sorry, and what were you saying?
00:53:23.774 - 00:53:27.384, Speaker C: No, thanks for time for having us.
00:53:27.582 - 00:53:32.900, Speaker A: Absolutely, guys. Thanks so much for your time. Everyone. Have a great day, and we'll see you next time. Bye.
