00:00:00.160 - 00:00:50.884, Speaker A: Is it possible to build an on chain marketplace where you could go and on one side have liquidity, right, provided by users and on the other side you have these hyper specialized, you could call them programmable markets or whatever you want to call them and then enable anybody to participate on both sides, right? This enables everybody to access these opportunities, but also enables protocols to be spending a lot less on incentives or whoever it is on that other side to be spending a lot less on incentives. There'll be so many more projects at DeFi because now liquidity shouldn't be a constraint for anybody. If you want to go build an AV's and restake, right? Like liquidity should not be the biggest thing that you're worried about. You should be focused on the actual protocol and the actual project and plug into Royco and we will take care of the liquidity.

00:03:59.708 - 00:04:02.084, Speaker A: Hey guys. Doing pretty good. Thanks for having me.
00:04:02.164 - 00:04:55.080, Speaker C: It's so good to see you. As former users of Rari Capital, we really appreciate all the value you brought to the defi space, so we're just excited to learn about what you're building next. What prompted this podcast is nomadic, and I recently noticed that you were tweeting about some of the challenges with high FDV launches and getting a fair token distribution, and so there's clearly some bit of a problem there that you're looking to solve. And so we are truthfully here to learn all the details as we go for the first time on the podcast. So, Jay, before we talk about the Royco protocol, could you kick us off with just a little more about your background in case someone is new to the space and doesn't know Rari capital, tell us about some of the work you've done.
00:04:55.192 - 00:05:28.392, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I guess I can give my whole background. Gone to crypto 2016. I was in 9th grade of high school at the time, and my boss told me, hey, you should put all your money into Ethereum. Thought it was a Ponzi scheme. And a couple weeks later, I read a Vitalik article on Hacker News that explained it, didn't really understand it, but bought a little bit under my parents coinbase or under my like, I had to use their id to open up the Coinbase account and then ended up buying a bunch of eth. It went up and I was like, whoa, I just cracked finance.
00:05:28.392 - 00:05:56.134, Speaker A: So I put all my money into ETH, started learning about it, participated in the icos. But 2017 came around, and everybody wanted to buy and sell all these icos. Everybody wanted to buy and sell all these altcoins. And Coinbase only had three assets. Finance wasn't even out back then, and using Bittrex was a pain in the butt. So built a mobile wallet that made it super easy to go and buy and sell cryptos. Ended up getting acquired by my crypto in 2018, my crypto being the fork of my ether wallet.
00:05:56.134 - 00:06:18.044, Speaker A: And then they actually end up getting acquired by Metamask just a couple years later. So it's during that time that I start learning all about DeFi, all about what was previously called open finance. Gets super deep into the weeds. I'm like, whoa, this stuff is pretty cool. I can do this. And they won't even let me open a brokerage account. So then 2020 comes around.
00:06:18.044 - 00:07:14.736, Speaker A: Build Rari Capital started as a yield aggregator, pivoted to a lending and borrowing platform, which we later became known for called fuse, where we basically specialized in lending and borrowing against long tail assets and long tail collateral. This ended up merging with the tribe. Dow, another Dow in the space. Spent a while just thinking about, okay, what do I want to build next? What do I want to build next? And after the collapse of FTX, understood that custody was a big problem and that I wanted to go and solve custody. And that's really where the origin story for Waymont began, is helping whales go in custody, their crypto assets. We got super familiar with how whales operate on chain, what we could do to help them, and that's kind of what gave way to the unlocks behind Roycos, understanding the behaviors of these whales, understanding the market inefficiencies that they're capturing on. And at Royco, we're trying to bring those like, that alpha to everybody.
00:07:14.800 - 00:07:27.402, Speaker F: So, yeah, maybe, Jay, we can just talk about the relationship between Weymont and Roiko, like, how do those fit into one another? And then are there any other groups contributing to Roiko as well, other than Waymont?
00:07:27.498 - 00:08:45.082, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe I can give the background of how we got to Roiko and then talk a little bit about Roiko. Basically, what we started noticing our whales doing is participating in all of these venture races, maybe on the Kol side of things, where they get in at a really great deal, and then they are able to go and blast this to their followers. And then usually this is in part, what leads to the high FTV, low, low float rounds. And then the second thing that actually became extremely popular in the last maybe seven, eight months is TVL raises, right? So our users actually going and bootstrapping early stage protocols with TVL and in exchange going and getting a great amount of yield, right? So the very interesting thing that we noticed as this was happening with our users is they're getting paid a crazy multiple on what the market yield is, right? So let's say the market yield at any given time is 20%. They'll go get paid 120% or 150% to go and participate in some of these TVL raises. This was uniquely enabled because they were able to inflate their market cap using the VC round to give that yield.
00:08:45.082 - 00:10:14.044, Speaker A: Right. This is part of why the low float, high FDV thing is needed, is so that they can go and use that to bootstrap their TVL and then maybe even again raise at a higher valuation and run back that same playbook. So the basic idea for Royco was look for these protocols that are paying 120% plus they don't need to be paying that. People would be happy to go and do these deals for a lot less because they're pretty great deals. And at the same time, on the other side, it's like, why should these deals be limited to these whales? Why should they be limited to you having a select number of Twitter followers or anything? So basically, what the initial ideas around Royco were about, is it possible to build an on chain marketplace where you could go and on one side have liquidity provided by users and on the other side you have these hyper specialized, you could call them programmable markets or whatever you want to call them, and then enable anybody to participate on both sides. This enables everybody to access these opportunities, but also enables protocols to be spending a lot less on incentives, or whoever it is on that other side to be spending a lot less on incentives. So I think it was during this time that a lot of people started stumbling upon, wait, this would be an extremely powerful mechanic and waymon us being at the center of a lot of these whales activities.
00:10:14.044 - 00:10:30.060, Speaker A: We agreed with that, right? So we said, okay, we want to help build the solution. So now we're one of many contributors who are contributing to the Royco protocol in an effort to help democratize access to these deals and ideally build better markets on chain.
00:10:30.172 - 00:11:40.186, Speaker C: Jay. So just to clarify, the types of deals that nomadic and I have seen behind the scenes as angels or investors through four rc, there are folks with larger amounts of liquidity, which we're calling whales here. They are not just investing in early stage protocols, but they're doing deals where they commit. Let's say, $10 million of stable coins to deposit. And the idea is that they're depositing that in exchange for some share of future tokens. Those deals are fantastic for protocols, because by increasing their total value locked or some other sort of metric like that, that is normally viewed by the public, and also by, like, their future investors, they give themselves a better chance at a better future round raise, potentially also raising their valuation. So this has all happened in the private markets.
00:11:40.186 - 00:12:28.494, Speaker C: And I think, as you pointed out, it comes with the territory of those that have, let's say, a larger social following, those that have some bit of credibility. Maybe they're known for being a whale that participates in protocols like this, but it's all happening privately. And so it sounds like you're creating like a, like some sort of liquidity coordination for this that happens on chain. Like, basically it would, what, open the doors then for anyone? You know, someone doesn't have to have the following, but they could, like, have the liquidity, but like, want to maintain their privacy and be able to, like, connect to wallet and participate. Anyways, correct me if I'm, like, misframing any of that.
00:12:28.654 - 00:13:12.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're spot on. A very simple way to break this down that I recently heard of is the liquidity markets that exist today on chain, whether it be these private deals or even these public deals, they operate like OTC markets do. Right? It's the protocol team going to a select group of people. There's no price discovery that is happening. There's really, like, no efficiency being had here. What we're building is, in one lens, a spot market for liquidity. This can be leveraged and will greatly benefit these private deals that we're talking about now, but will equally benefit public liquidity mining programs.
00:13:12.594 - 00:13:47.744, Speaker A: Maybe now it makes sense to talk about how the protocol itself works, because it's kind of hard to talk about the advantages without going into that. So how it works is, look, anybody can come into the protocol, right? Whether it be a dow, an individual, like a group of people, whatever, and they can create a market. Markets are super simple. They just have two pieces to them. They have the order book, and they have the liquidity coordinator. So we'll start with the liquidity coordinator. The liquidity coordinator defines what happens to the assets that come into each of these markets.
00:13:47.744 - 00:14:19.054, Speaker A: So let's say we were working with somebody like Uniswap. Uniswap would say the liquidity coordinator is going to go on LP ETH and die. Or they could say, hey, LP Ethan Dai and lock it up for 30 days. It's a fully programmable interface, so they can customize whatever they want. On top of each of these liquidity coordinators, this programmable layer, you have an order book. This isn't like a traditional order book where you're buying and selling things. This is an order book where you say, hey, I have this much liquidity, and this is how much incentives I need.
00:14:19.054 - 00:14:59.586, Speaker A: Or here's how much incentives I have. Here's how much liquidity I need. The two dimensions of this order book being liquidity and incentives. Now, let's say Uniswap could come along and say, hey, look, we want $10 million. We're willing to pay 100 uni. Defi dad might come along and say, hey, I'll bring $50 million, but I need 200 unique, right? Then nomadic might see that and be like, I'll actually do it for less uni. And this order book enables Uniswap or anybody using the protocol to understand their cost of capital, right? And understand and actually visualize, wow, if we increase our emissions by 10%, we unlock more like this much TVL.
00:14:59.586 - 00:15:37.984, Speaker A: If we decrease our emissions by this much, this is how it will affect our TVL, right? You build this, like, system for understanding the trade offs between your liquidity and your incentives. And that's currently. And that will always be a nonlinear relationship between liquidity and incentives. So building an order book here is extremely powerful. Does that make sense so far? There's only one other piece. The final piece is when a successful trade is made, right? Or a successful order has been filled, the user coming in and providing the liquidity receives a pool token. This pool token is an accounting method for their deposits in the liquidity coordinator.
00:15:37.984 - 00:16:26.402, Speaker A: So let's say there's a duration, right? Uniswap locks up their assets. Lp's e die. At the end of that 30 days, they can go and redeem it in that underlying liquidity coordinator. But in the meantime, they can use that order book to go and give that liquidity, or to go give that pool token to somebody else, or to go and sell that pool token to somebody else. In certain cases, that pool token could have different dynamics, right? Imagine if that there was Eigen, like the liquidity coordinator was to go and deposit to eigen layer, right? Now, that pool token isn't just the principal, but it is also the points on top of the principal. That's what that pool token represents, because it just represents your pro rata share of the pool. So there's a lot of fascinating dynamics that will come about from the pool tokens, which are just generally this accounting mechanism for what's inside of the liquidity coordinator.
00:16:26.402 - 00:16:36.998, Speaker A: But broadly speaking, we think that this will bring a crazy amount of efficiency to all of these on chain markets and enable protocols and users to both have better opportunities.
00:16:37.166 - 00:17:16.076, Speaker F: Jay, can you think of anything else kind of in market now that is similar to this or anything that kind of, like, gave you inspiration to build this that's maybe similar, like, to me, like, the whole kind of liquidity routing is maybe a little bit reminiscent of, like, tokamak, what they were attempting to do with their v one, but, yeah, and I mean, the OTC side reminds me of what some of these markets, like, whales market is maybe attempting to do. Yeah, kind of like an open ended question, but is there anything else in the market you see that's maybe similar, or is this kind of totally like a net new thing?
00:17:16.180 - 00:17:36.052, Speaker A: Yeah, we actually see this as, like, the first new Defi primitive in a very long time. Right. It's an extremely flexible mechanism, what I just described to you, and there's so many different applications. You can actually go build on top of it. You could go build lending platforms on top of it. Right. You can go build amms on top of it.
00:17:36.052 - 00:17:44.620, Speaker A: You can go build anything on top of it. And it's really difficult to even find similarities between this mechanism and the existing ones.
00:17:44.732 - 00:18:52.050, Speaker C: Jay, I think this is a good point for us to try to create an example out of how Royco will be used. One protocol that's top of mind for me is Athena. Athena had multiple investors on their cap table who had committed clearly large sums of capital to Athena to bootstrap liquidity. And so that all happened in the private market, and that created a lot of early interest for folks. But again, to give the quick synopsis, I would assume, I don't know this for certain, that the conversations went something like, we'd love to have you invest. You're going to get XYZ ticket size, maybe they're going to invest, like, let's say a million dollars, but because let's say they're like a market maker, they're also going to commit to put $50 million into Athena to actually mint their USD coin from day one. This is, like, before anyone else has access to it.
00:18:52.050 - 00:19:19.306, Speaker C: Um, and now, as a result, they're not only helping to bootstrap that liquidity in the protocol, but they're also going to earn some pretty enormous outsized, like, rewards early on in the, uh, the points program or like some yield farming type of program. So maybe you take it from there. Like, how does that setup differ once Roiko is live? Like what are some of the possibilities we could draw out?
00:19:19.410 - 00:20:16.222, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Generally I would say we think that the world where you optimize for each independent target is best. So what I mean by that is, look, as you're doing a raise, you should go in to get the best vc's on the board. Shouldn't be optimizing to go and get a bunch of LP's into the protocol. And when you're going to raise for LP's, you should go and do that independently and go and get the best LP's. So what we will be focusing on and what we are focused on is how can protocols, or anybody for that matter, go and get the best LP's? What characterizes the best LP's for a protocol is usually just your cost of capital and ensuring that you're paying the least amount for each dollar in the door, right? So somebody like Athena could come along, spin up a market, say, hey look, this is going to go deposit into USD or whatever. And now on this order book, users could be saying, hey look, here's how much I need to get paid in order to deposit.
00:20:16.222 - 00:20:59.844, Speaker A: Here's how much I need to get paid in order to deposit. And these could be varying amounts. What you end up with likely is like an interesting curve, right? Where it's like, hey look, if they pay out like 10%, maybe they get like $10 million. If they pay out 50%, then they get like $500 million, and if they pay out 60%, then they get like $3 billion. And now they can see that on an order book, enable anybody to participate, which should cut down their costs significantly, obviously. Now, these days you have all these different points programs and everybody has their own views on these points programs. But you can also do the same with points using Royco, right? If you just replace this transferable token with a non transferable token, you can basically use the entire mechanism I just described with points.
00:20:59.844 - 00:21:58.922, Speaker A: The idea of Roico fundamentally is that you should be able to pay the cheapest amount for however much liquidity you need in the door for any one of these protocols. I'll give you another example that kind of like will help contextualize this. We chat with a lot of the different protocols in the space and a lot of these lrTs, right, a completely different side of the market. They want to go create deals with avss, for example, right? Exclusive deals like the Ether, Phi Lagrange, example, where they made a $600 million deal providing this liquidity to Lagrange. But realistically, Etherfi, they don't know how much liquidity they're gonna have in two months. They don't know how much liquidity they're gonna have in six months. So what we're talking with a very, like a handful of LRT's about is what if you create a Royco market and it does something super simple, that liquidity coordinator takes in an LRT and locks it up, right? Maybe it locks it up for six months, maybe nine months, whatever, up to the LRT.
00:21:58.922 - 00:22:26.572, Speaker A: Now the LRT can go onto the order book and say, hey look, we're looking for $100 million. Here's how many tokens we're willing to pay out for that $100 million. And users can come along and say, hey look, if you want my $100 million, here's what you need to pay me. Or if you want my $100 million, here's what you need to pay me. And you competitively drive down the costs for the protocols to achieve whatever they need to do. So again, this is an extremely flexible system. The way that we think about it is in three key phases.
00:22:26.572 - 00:23:11.514, Speaker A: The first phase is in helping individuals, protocols, whatever, grow their TbL, right? Grow their liquidity inside of the pools. The second phase will be all about how can we help incumbents maintain the liquidity inside of their pools at the cheapest cost, right? Somebody like a compound who integrates this might find, wow, we're overpaying for our liquidity by so much, right? That 90% of their TVL will stay if they cut their emissions by 50%. That's a possible conclusion that they could come to. And they don't know that unless they use a system like Royco, because they aren't going to a b test. Hundreds of millions of dollars of emissions on the scale of billions of dollars in production. That just doesn't make any sense. But when you have an order book, they can actually have a system for thinking about this.
00:23:11.514 - 00:23:30.270, Speaker A: And finally, phase three, which is what I'm personally most excited about, is using the Royco infrastructure. There's an opportunity to go build native applications that leverage the Royco infrastructure and actually take advantage of the liquidity, take advantage of the order book to go build net new applications on chain.
00:23:30.382 - 00:24:12.772, Speaker F: I think it's finally clicking for me right now. And I'll just reiterate a few things that I was thinking through. So the private market deals, like that example we walked through with Athena. It's an inefficient market because you're only polling a small subset of users. Whereas if you open this up and publicize what was previously privatized, you cast a wider net and you can find almost like a more efficient market because you're just opening up to more users and more eyeballs. And those market forces will naturally correct a bit. What it will allow is, say, teams like Athena.
00:24:12.772 - 00:24:41.606, Speaker F: I know we're using them a lot, but they'll actually get a better deal, so they probably won't have to give away as much equity in this arrangement. What also is really interesting to me, I want to hear your, so your number three that you mentioned where you get excited about applications. Let's maybe just ideate on a few of those things. What are you conjuring up? What are other teams maybe even coming to you already with thinking to build here?
00:24:41.750 - 00:25:42.904, Speaker A: Yeah, I recently, I recently heard a really great proposal for something to be built on top of Royco. And this is an application which is a lending and borrowing platform. But it's different than most other lending and borrowing platforms in that how you have this liquidity on one axis, incentives on the other axis. What if you were to transition these words from liquidity to collateral, and you were to transition incentive to how much you can borrow? What you basically enable is a tick based lending and borrowing platform. Why is a tick based lending and borrowing platform great? It's because every lending and borrowing platform out there marks their assets to market. If you go and borrow 1000 uni that's using a chain link feed that is marking it to market. But the thing is, that doesn't work for long tail assets when your position could actually affect the market itself.
00:25:42.904 - 00:26:50.068, Speaker A: So the proposal that I recently heard for this lenient borrowing platform was you could customize your collateral factors for each price range, which basically enables you to support all of these long tail assets, because you don't need to be promising a 70% collateral factor when it's $100 million loan, but you can do a 70% collateral factor when it's a $10 loan. Right? So there's a lot of interesting things that can be built here. Another proposal that I recently heard, and this one's like pretty native to the protocol itself and will be probably supported out of the box, is a lot of groups are still running pool twos these days, right? To go incentivize liquidity on Amms pool twos, they, how they, how they work today is it's just like, hey, I'll pay 500 tokens per day. For liquidity and the token products really just crossing their fingers like oh wow. We hope that enough liquidity comes in the door such that it justifies this spend. You could totally put that on its head and say hey, instead of paying 500 per day, you target some level of liquidity. And now the token project can figure out what they need to spend on a per day basis.
00:26:50.068 - 00:27:32.158, Speaker A: This should ideally cut costs. Now let's say the product's worried that all of the volatility there, they can say hey, not only just lp, it's lp and lockup, like the uniswap example we walked through earlier, but now you have various different counterparties bidding in real time to provide that at the cheapest cost. But I also do think like broadly by like a dollar amount, the OTC. And like these current private deals that are getting done, they're probably a small fraction of the total deals that will be done on Royco, right. I imagine that like the entire private markets are just going to get flushed. Everything will just be done publicly, right. There will be no connotation of this OTC market anymore.
00:27:32.158 - 00:27:42.390, Speaker A: Right. So I think that it not only has massive advantages for the OTC side of things, but also has massive advantages for people who are doing traditional equity mining, running traditional incentive programs.
00:27:42.582 - 00:28:09.684, Speaker G: Defi enables a whole new world of trading and yield opportunities. Sometimes we all wish we had a little bit bigger of a budget so we can make most out of it. That's why we created blueberry. Blubery lets you access the best opportunities on Ethereum all in one easy to use terminal. You can access five x, ten x or even 20 x your money in one click more than any other lending market. So you can maximize your earnings only on blueberry.
00:28:11.224 - 00:28:53.202, Speaker F: Jay, just like thinking through some of the things we've been discussing, I'm trying to like come up with the different markets that maybe you could be, I guess, going after very competitive with and some that come to my like correct me if Im wrong, but I see this being a potentially massive disruptor of especially the private OTC markets, probably some lending markets with applications coming that are built on top. I even see this like encroaching a bit on subsections of VC, maybe. What other areas or sectors within what we know of today as Defi. Do you see this kind of like competing with.
00:28:53.298 - 00:29:32.342, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, certainly. I hope that it's more, how to put it, works alongside a lot of these places or a lot of these current activities that are happening. Some of those activities are these OTC TVL raises for lack of a better word. Right. Certainly you have some subsection of VC, as you mentioned. Some of the other things that we think will happen over time is it will be natural for market makers to come and be replaced, right. Using the Roiko system, because you can go and incentivize liquidity and you could go permissionlessly distribute rewards.
00:29:32.342 - 00:29:39.844, Speaker A: Right. So maybe actually replacing isn't the wrong word, but creating competitive market environments to enable anybody to participate in these opportunities.
00:29:39.974 - 00:29:40.240, Speaker C: One.
00:29:40.272 - 00:29:53.656, Speaker F: One other thing is, I'm curious how this overlaps or what you know about Kobe's project Echo. Um, I feel like he's going after, like, basically a more democratized ICO type platform, but I don't know fully.
00:29:53.680 - 00:30:15.182, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, I think they're like, thematically in the same direction. Right. We're. We're certainly much more focused on, like, the infrastructure side of things as well. Um, so, like, you could go build echo on top of Royco and, like, KYC wrapping and everything, but just fundraisers aren't something that we're focused on. But certainly an application can be built on top of Roico to go do that.
00:30:15.278 - 00:31:08.952, Speaker C: I think part of what really clicks for me with Roico is it goes back to the basics of Defi that drew us all in. It is opening up access for everyone to really great opportunities. Obviously, it's going to be permissionless and trustless through the protocol there. But once upon a time, it sounded crazy that you could be a market maker suddenly, or you could be a lender with very small amounts of money and earn the same high yield that the big boys were able to make in traditional finance, or even more so than traditional finance. But we'll say the whales that were early to crypto on chain. And so this makes a lot of sense. There's a demand that is agnostic to what type of market were in.
00:31:08.952 - 00:32:46.124, Speaker C: Thats another exciting part of this for me is that whether youre in a bull market or a bear market, theres always a demand to bootstrap that liquidity. The issue, and I think youve known it as a founder previously with Rari, its very difficult to find those types of investors or whales that are going to be able to participate early and commit that kind of capital and be willing to lock up or in some cases. I know the terms are really promising for whoever's depositing that liquidity, but in all truthfulness, the protocol knows that they could just withdraw that at any point, and basically the terms of the deal are nullified, and now they don't get their tokens but the protocol is now in a tough spot because they've lost that TVL, which was actually driving more interest. So this just makes sense. Coordinate everything on chain so that everyone's got the same equal access. And I do believe that while you probably will bring down the rates or the rewards, the yield that folks have earned with these deals, like a select few have been able to earn with these types of terms, instead you're going to see these really attractive yields that people were totally unaware of existing previously. So it's exciting.
00:32:46.124 - 00:32:48.328, Speaker C: It all clicks for me.
00:32:48.416 - 00:33:34.300, Speaker A: What was so promising about DeFi Summer and what was so amazing about DeFi Summer is now we had access, and we, meaning the industry, had access to all of these yields, right? That was previously limited to all these trad five firms who had, like, these massive teams. And what we've seen over the last four years. And if you were to ask me why is Defi dead, is we've seen the industrialization of each of these segments. People aren't going to amms. They're going to market makers, right? People aren't going to lending and borrowing platforms. They're going to Genesis, right? Or we're going to Genesis. So what we're seeing now, and what I hope that Roico can do, is revitalize DeFi by bringing these opportunities for industrialization to everybody.
00:33:34.300 - 00:34:10.854, Speaker A: That's simply put, that's what I hope that we can do and hopefully revive DeFi in the process. And to address your point on, like, look, yeah, maybe the yields go down, but if we do our job correctly, what will actually happen? There'll be so much more innovation at DeFi. There'll be so many more projects at DeFi, because now liquidity shouldn't be a constraint for anybody. If you want to go build an AV's and restake, right? Like, liquidity should not be the biggest thing that you're worried about. You should be focused on the actual protocol and the actual project and plug into Royco, and we will take care of the liquidity. Right? Whoever it is, we will take care of the liquidity. Right.
00:34:10.854 - 00:34:23.102, Speaker A: That's what I hope that we can do, is not only bring down access to everybody into these amazing opportunities, but also enable anybody to plug into that liquidity on the other side and not have to worry about it.
00:34:23.238 - 00:34:56.473, Speaker C: Jay, this is probably a good place for us to wrap up. Thank you so much for coming on with us. This was just fascinating to learn about what you've been building. I really feel like you identified a need within the Defi markets. With Rari Capital. And we're just delighted that you're back with yet another product that seems to be solving some like, major missing primitive in the defi space. So I want to remind our listeners then that first they should learn more about the Royco protocol by going to royco.org
00:34:56.473 - 00:35:23.170, Speaker C: dot. They should, of course, follow the Twitter handle for Royco, which is just roycoprotocol. They should also follow the Weymont company on Twitter, which is waymontco, and then follow Jay Bhavnani. All of that is in our show notes. You can easily reference it. And then Jay, just again, thank you. I want to give you the final word.
00:35:23.170 - 00:35:32.494, Speaker C: Any advice for those of us who want to get involved early on in the protocol or if we just want to continue to learn more and stay updated?
00:35:32.614 - 00:35:59.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, thank you guys for having me. First of all, in terms of getting involved, it's like we really think that this is an important protocol. We need a lot of help across the board, whether it's even just hitting the retweet and spreading the word, coming and joining us as a team or whatever is the in between. So just hit my DM's anytime. If you're interested in getting involved, interested in helping, or even just interested in learning more. Always happy to geek out on this stuff.
00:35:59.654 - 00:36:12.174, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Forthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
