00:00:00.170 - 00:00:15.854, Speaker A: Radiant, for example, attracted a huge amount of TvL, over 500 million at some peak point. But that was mercenary farming. We learned the lesson in V one. And. And it's something we. We colloquially termed like D five 30. So we don't want to be D five 1.0.
00:00:15.854 - 00:00:35.510, Speaker A: As. As in 99% of protocols are being farmed to zero because they showed crazy yields in the first days or weeks of. Of the life. Because otherwise, it's not a sustainable business model if you're just highly incentivizing emissions attracting TbL, and then the TBL moves to the next coolest protocol in towns.
00:00:44.570 - 00:01:33.370, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, this is Defi dad from fourth Revolution Capital. I'm here for another episode of the DFI podcast. Today we're going to be interviewing Isaac, who is the head of PR and project management at Radiant Capital. Radiant, you've probably heard of it, is the first omnichan money market launched on the Ethereum L two arbitram. It also is now live on BFC, as in finance, smart chain Radiant launched in the summer 2022 during one of the most unforgiving years in crypto. Despite these market headwinds, they quickly became a darling of the emerging DFI space on arbitrum. And since then, if you count borrowed tokens lent as TVL, they boast an impressive 441,000,000 in value deposited across their smart contracts on both arbitrum and BSc.
00:01:33.370 - 00:02:22.634, Speaker B: If you look at DeFi applications across just arbitrum, I would say they rank in the top two or three applications in terms of most usage on any given day. Part of the reason we're having this interview is my own fascination with Radiant's very progressive thinking on tokenomics. They've brought forth new ideas for vesting reward tokens, how to incentivize users to add value to the protocol to qualify for liquidity mining rewards, and how to better distribute those rewards without becoming the victim of mercenary farmers, which we're going to discuss all of this today, and what lessons they've learned from other DeFI teams in ultimately, the design of the radiant token. So on that note, Isaac, welcome to the DeFi podcast. How are you doing?
00:02:22.752 - 00:02:25.338, Speaker A: Hey. Excited to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:02:25.424 - 00:02:42.190, Speaker B: Yeah, no, thank you for joining me on such short notice, too, because we're recording this on March 31, 2023. You all only released your radiant V two in the past week. I want to say. Was it week or two weeks?
00:02:42.260 - 00:02:44.414, Speaker A: Yeah, it's two weeks and one on BSE.
00:02:44.542 - 00:03:35.566, Speaker B: I'm sure it's been a very exciting time. I have personally had the opportunity to try radiant V two. There's just a lot there that is very familiar if you've used other DFI lending and borrowing applications, but there's all these improvements because you're benefiting from really fast and cheap transactions on arbitrum and BSC. And so this is going to be a part of the conversation, is just what has building on l two enabled you to do from a product design standpoint? But why don't we start with your background and how you got started with radiant? So, yeah, Isaac, anything you're willing to share about just your career and basically what led you to building with radiant?
00:03:35.678 - 00:03:50.914, Speaker A: Sure. Absolutely. So I'm a mechanical engineer. I started working in Formula one some years ago, was lucky enough to win the world championships with Renault Formula One, and then jumped to aerospace. Really cool. Yeah.
00:03:51.112 - 00:03:54.838, Speaker B: Well, you only mentioned to me earlier you worked in Formula one.
00:03:54.924 - 00:04:21.642, Speaker A: That's impressive, with a team of 800 people, so it's quite a bunch of smart guys. And I learned a lot. I was passionate about technology. Then I jumped to aerospace, another one of my passions. And then I started my entrepreneurship career in startup land. And then one of my passions was blockchain. I felt it was the most disruptive technology that I probably was going to live for the rest of my life, along with AI.
00:04:21.642 - 00:04:48.150, Speaker A: And I found the radiant team, the project. It resonated a lot with my values, with what I wanted Defi to be as in a transparent layer for everyone to use it in a seamless way without having to understand the technology under the hood, as we will be discussing later. And it was really, really the passion of the team, the vision that they had that helped me jump into the project. And I'm very happy of what we've built so far and what's coming down the line.
00:04:48.220 - 00:04:56.758, Speaker B: Isaac, when did you get started with Defi? I'm wondering, what was the first application you used? How long have you been using Defi?
00:04:56.854 - 00:05:47.526, Speaker A: Well, I'm quite new to DeFi with respect to the rest of the team, who have been in DeFi for many more years. But I started like two years ago, I remember, with one of my friends back in Spain, trying to calculate whether it was profitable to set up a mining node for blockchain. And that was the beginning when I started learning. And then, of course, we started using DeFi, and, well, I started using the most common protocols, so lending protocols Ave compound and so on. And then I jumped onto radiant, and now it's like a boost in the number of protocols I've been using. Of course, since I started in radiant, I tried to use every protocol that I can get my hands on to really know the value of the protocols that are being built, know how we can collaborate with those protocols, and know how we can add unique features to radiant to be even more useful for our users.
00:05:47.638 - 00:06:38.314, Speaker B: Something you said there that stood out to me is that you actually look to calculate whether something would be profitable before you entered it. So good job. You're many steps ahead of the average investor in DeFi if you're doing that. I think. Before we talk more generally about how radiant is solving a problem for DFI users, do you want to share a bit more about just the philosophy behind building at radiant? I noticed that in the radiant V two launch video, there was a reference to onboarding, like, 100 million users. Absolutely. I recognize there's, like, a lot of ambition there to really make DFI what it's supposed to be, which is accessible to all, to make an impact on those who urgently need it.
00:06:38.314 - 00:06:41.302, Speaker B: But, yeah. What's the philosophy of the team behind radiant?
00:06:41.366 - 00:07:29.482, Speaker A: Well, we absolutely want to be the leading money market, cross chain money market in DeFi. In the whole of DeFi, we also have the ambition of being the most profitable protocol. Not for ourselves, because all our protocol fees are shared with the community. 85% in V two, only 15% is retained for Opex. But we really want to be a seamless experience, a transparent layer, so that people don't have to worry if it's arbitram that they are using, if it's BSc, if it's a layer one, if I have to bridge my assets. What does this really mean? Because many people are challenged by this technology that we are using in DeFi in general, and they don't really jump into it because they don't understand the technology. I really want this to be, and all the team wants this to be like Amazon, where you just buy whatever you want and you don't need to understand the technology that's behind it.
00:07:29.482 - 00:07:55.386, Speaker A: We want people, and that's why we focus on onboarding the next 100 million users into DFI, because we want them to be able to do whatever they want. If it's buying an NFT, if it's gaming, if it's trading, if it's lending and borrowing for whatever trading purposes or strategy they have, we wanted to make as seamless as possible from a user perspective, but also from a technology perspective, so that they can use the most cutting edge technology without having to be very tech savvy.
00:07:55.518 - 00:08:41.534, Speaker B: Yeah. So one thing that everyone should notice right off the bat is this is built on an L two and also on another EVM compatible chain, BSc. And whether you're on BSc or arbitrum, transactions are cheap. They're very fast. I think this has clearly allowed you all to be a little more user friendly for defi users. But, yeah, I guess. What else comes to mind in terms of what separates radiant as an omnichain lending and borrowing market? What else separates it from its predecessors? Something like an Ave or compound or even something like a maker?
00:08:41.662 - 00:09:30.462, Speaker A: Absolutely. We are for kefave, so hats off to Ave and Geist. Also, they are great protocols, Ave, great lending and borrowing protocol, but at the moment, they are omnichain and not really cross chain in the sense that you can deposit on one chain, but you have to borrow on the same chain and then bridge over to a different chain. For example, if you want to deposit on arbitrum and borrow on polygon, you have to deposit, borrow on arbitrum and then bridge to polygon using whatever bridge you want. In our case, we wanted the experience to be one step further. So we wanted to really be cross chain in the sense that you can deposit on arbitrum and borrow on Polygon to buy an NFD or use that cool protocol that you've heard of. And moving further in V three, we really want to go one step further and be able to deposit.
00:09:30.462 - 00:10:06.154, Speaker A: So offer the option to our users to deposit on, say, Mainnet. If that's a chain that we will be launching on. This is of course, down to the Dow, but you will be able to deposit on one chain, say it's mainnet, borrow on arbitrum, and repay the loan on polygon. So it's really, really full cross chain vision. That's b three. V two at the moment is deposit on one chain, borrow on another one, which is already a strong step further with respect to our competitors. But this is from a user perspective, from a community perspective, it's cool that we are sharing all of our protocol fees.
00:10:06.154 - 00:11:04.158, Speaker A: As I said before, 85%, only 15% is retained for Opex, for operational expenditure within the team and within the Dow. But 85% of what we get from the borrowers paying money, paying interest on the loans is shared with the community, shared with the users. Currently, the split that we have, this was a proposal that was voted some weeks ago, is 25% for lenders as part of the base APY and 60% for lockers. So liquidity providers who are locking the liquidity into radiant, so that's loyal users who are not here for the mercenary farming, they are here for the long run, as we will discuss later on, surely. And basically, they are providing value with the liquidity to the protocol, and they believe in the future of the protocol. So that's what stands out, what stands us apart from other protocols, because we sure all that we get 85% of the protocol fees. Of course, the native token that we have, the radiant token is used for governance purposes.
00:11:04.158 - 00:12:10.342, Speaker A: We have a fully fledged voting platform on snapshot, and the feedback and discussion, community wise is held on discourse. And we have very interesting discussions, proposals that are being sent over by community members on our discourse and of course on our socials, discord and so on. And a cool aspect also that I want to highlight is that we pay the yield in hard assets. So the sure of protocol fees, you receive it not in our native token, you receive it in bitcoin, ETH, stablecoins, the assets that we are currently supporting, and the future assets that we will be supporting. So the yield is real yield received in hard assets. And on top of that, as we will explain later on, on how the version two, our V two, is working, and the protocol mechanics that we've launched very recently, those meeting the threshold, the requirements to be eligible for radiant emissions, will get an additional boost of radiant emissions. And of course, that's in the form of radiant tokens, and that really boosts the yield that you're capable of getting.
00:12:10.342 - 00:12:35.626, Speaker A: And then you can go and trade your radiant tokens or deposit them as liquidity. So that's basically what stands us apart. And one key aspect is that you get paid for borrowing. You get paid in radiant tokens for borrowing. So basically, the lenders get the base apy and the boost in radiant emissions if they are eligible. And the borrowers, of course, have to repay the loan with the interest that is currently in the market. And then you get a boost in radiant emissions.
00:12:35.626 - 00:12:49.422, Speaker A: So you get paid in radiant tokens to borrow. That's a cool feature, which also stunts us apart from most of the other lending and borrowing protocols and money markets that you can find around. So that's in a nutshell, what stands radiant apart and makes us unique.
00:12:49.566 - 00:13:17.914, Speaker B: I don't think I could have asked you a harder question. That very open ended question of what separates you from competitors. If you really want to understand all of the nuances of how this protocol is designed, using the platform is easy. If you go to Arbitrum or BSC, I deposit some collateral I can borrow, then against that, to any of the chains that are supported. But you can only deposit, what from arbitram and BSc for right now, right?
00:13:17.952 - 00:13:18.698, Speaker A: Yes, that's correct.
00:13:18.784 - 00:13:19.498, Speaker B: That's correct.
00:13:19.584 - 00:13:20.074, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:20.192 - 00:13:48.902, Speaker B: And then obviously I could go there too, just to lend. Like I don't have to necessarily borrow. I could go there and just look to make some yield lending. But the end result of all of this is deposit on one chain. And again, the borrowing can then be done on any of the supported chains. You don't have to end up with borrowed debt on the same chain as the collateral and then bridge it to some other chain. This is brand new.
00:13:48.902 - 00:15:03.250, Speaker B: I mean, there's no other protocol that enables this. I'm guessing this will become a standard in the near future. But for right now, this is a real first in DFI. Whether you're a trader, farmer, analyst, or newbie, you can trade smart with Kyberswap, the OG decentralized exchange and aggregator on 13 chains. Swap at the best rates, farm with real yields, set limit orders, use their proprietary trading and AI tools with the best UX and defi securely and permissionlessly get better rates, better opportunities, better alpha, and a better trading experience. Tradesmart now@kyverswap.com one other point you made was about the breakdown of fees that if I go to radiant and I lend something like ETH or stablecoins when I'm lending that interest, can you break that down first? Like where is that going? What percentage of the lending interest goes to me as a lender without any sort of locked up liquidity? I'm potentially just a mercenary farmer who's there to earn some interest and not have to add any other value to the protocol.
00:15:03.350 - 00:15:29.106, Speaker A: Absolutely. So that's a cool question because it's basically understanding the nuts and bolts of V two. And just in a very simple way, you can of course just deposit and do nothing else. You can borrow and you can provide liquidity. Those are the three main things that you can do within the protocol. If you just deposit your assets, say ETH, as you said, or whatever asset that we are supporting. Currently, it's ETH, bitcoin, it's BNB, and stablecoins.
00:15:29.106 - 00:16:06.754, Speaker A: If you deposit, you will be getting a competitive base yield paid in the same asset that you deposited. Say you deposit ETH, you will get whatever the base APY is at this moment. And you can check that in app radiant capital in our markets tab, whatever that is. It is a competitive yield, and you can just get it by the simple act of just depositing. Then if you want to go ahead and borrow, you will, of course, have borrowed in the same asset or in any of the other assets. You can borrow in the same chain or in a different chain. So, BSc, you deposit an arbitram, you borrow, or the other way around.
00:16:06.754 - 00:16:46.862, Speaker A: That's not a problem. That's part of being omnichain or crosschain. And you will have to repay, of course, once again, a competitive yield, as you can find elsewhere in other lending and borrowing platforms, you will have to pay in the same asset that you borrowed. For example, if you deposit ETH and you borrow, say, tether, you will have to repay in tether, whatever the API is at the moment. The cool thing comes when one you start using, for example, advanced lending and borrowing features such as looping, which basically repeats the lending and borrowing cycle to increase your leverage. So basically, your deposit is leveraged. You have more deposit because you are repeating the borrowing cycle several times, four to five times.
00:16:46.862 - 00:17:11.894, Speaker A: Normally, this will increase the yield that you're getting. But that's only lending and borrowing. That's basic lending and borrowing. If you want to additionally provide liquidity. The cool thing that providing liquidity activates is that whenever you start providing liquidity, you start earning an additional share of protocol fees. So that's notwithstanding radiant tokens. That's paid in hard assets, as we said before.
00:17:11.894 - 00:18:00.578, Speaker A: So say that, for example, you've deposited $1,000 worth of ETH and you haven't borrowed anything, and you start providing liquidity. Say you provide $1 of liquidity, which basically in arbitrum and in BSE is with the current liquidity pools that we have. It's a pancake liquidity pool in BNB, and it's balanced. Your liquidity pool in arbitrum, for example, in arbitrum, to make the example simpler, it's an 80 20 radiant ETH liquidity pool. So you provide your liquidity in the way of 80% radiant, 20% ETH to that liquidity pool. Say that you provide $1 worth of liquidity. So a very small amount, and you lock it in the protocol, you will start earning protocol fees.
00:18:00.578 - 00:18:37.506, Speaker A: What does that mean? The protocol fees coming from borrowers, for example, you and me borrow money, we repay our loan. Part of that money goes to the lenders. Part of that money goes to the liquidity providers. How much of $100 of debt repayment, $25 would go to lenders in the same asset that they deposited? $60 would go so much more. Nearly three times more goes to liquidity providers. Of course, the protocol fees going to liquidity providers is a mix of the different assets that people are borrowing. So that's where the hard assets come into play.
00:18:37.506 - 00:19:38.206, Speaker A: So you may have liquidity, you may have provided liquidity in radiant ETH, but you are getting wrap, bitcoin, ETH, stablecoins, and whatever future assets we support. So that's the protocol fee split, but that's not receiving any radiant emissions up to this point, then the only threshold that you want to meet, and this is something which was shared by, which was proposed by one of the members of our community. We are very proud of our community. They are very engaged, very active, proposing very interesting ideas. And the discussions are really cool for anyone just wanting to check them out on discord. And the idea that was proposed was, okay, how do we try to get rid of mercenary farming? Tvl so people just coming to radiant because the yields are very high and just moving away once the yields compress once again. Well, one of the options, and that has moved through, and it's the way V two is working, is basically meeting a threshold of the amount of liquidity you provide with respect to your deposit.
00:19:38.206 - 00:20:28.250, Speaker A: So to make it very simple, if you have 1000, as we said before, $1,000 deposited worth of ETH, you have to meet a 5% threshold. That means that you need $50 worth of DLP tokens. So DLP is dynamic liquidity, providing tokens, dynamic liquidity provision tokens. So basically providing liquidity and locking those tokens, you need more than 5% with respect to your deposits. If you have 1000, you need $50 or more worth of DLP tokens. Once you go above that threshold, you not only continue earning protocol fees, as I said before, 60% of the share, but you start earning a boost in radiant emissions, you basically become eligible to earn radiant emissions. And that's where the interesting thing comes, or the most interesting thing comes because of course that adds an APR, that adds yield on top of your basic yield.
00:20:28.250 - 00:21:24.498, Speaker A: And depending on the asset, depending on the chain, depending on the market moment, it's really a very strong boost that you can get in terms of our native token emissions being sent to lenders and borrowers. So whenever you provide liquidity, if you are a lender, you will get a boost in liquidity in terms of radiant emissions. And if you are borrowing, and that was the cool feature I was referring to before, whenever you are borrowing, you get paid to be borrowed. So to be a borrower. So if, for example, say, the borrowing interest for a particular asset is 6% and the boosted emissions mean an APR of 20%, you are getting 20 minus six, net APR of 14%, of course, paid in radiant tokens, 14% net interest, positive interest for borrowing. So you get paid for borrowing within radiant, of course, in our native token in that case. So that's basically in a nutshell.
00:21:24.498 - 00:22:01.714, Speaker A: What do you get as rewards in radiant? You either get your basic py as lender, or you have to pay as a borrower, or you start getting protocol fees as soon as you provide liquidity to the protocol. And if that liquidity is above 5% of the US dollar value of your deposits, you boost emissions. You boost your yield because you start earning radiant emissions. So hopefully that's clear. Basically, it's either hard assets or boost in radiant emissions if you go about that 5%. That's how it works in V two, based on the learnings that we got from V one, this is a huge.
00:22:01.832 - 00:22:43.082, Speaker B: Difference from what kicked off yield farming with comp mining in 2020. If you go back to 2020, what happened was you had lenders and borrowers incentivized, just like you do here, except there was no requirement other than being a lender or borrower. So lenders and borrowers were earning these base rates. Lenders would have earned a base rate from lending. Borrowers were paying an interest rate to lenders, but they were both earning the comp token. There is no free lunch here with radiant. You only get the radiant token unless you commit.
00:22:43.082 - 00:23:32.142, Speaker B: You have to commit to providing. So when you enter into, we're going to talk about looping here in a moment, but if you were to enter into a borrowed position, basically you'll see these really nice looking numbers on the markets tab in radiant capital, it shows you that you can be earning, I'm telling you, like live numbers here. As I look at this, if I look at the markets, if I was lending ETH today, I earn a base rate of 1.77%. That's just ETH like it from borrowers. But I can also earn 11.9% APR in the radiant token. Now, if I borrow, I'm paying 12.6%,
00:23:32.142 - 00:24:14.298, Speaker B: but I'm also earning 21.1% in the radiant token. So there's an incentive here to lend and borrow. But again, it comes with the caveat of you have to add value to this protocol by providing liquidity. And one of the biggest issues that we saw with a lot of other DeFi protocols is they gave away, the reward for participating in the protocol, was giving away their token. And then what happens is those participants, of course, sell that token to realize a profit. Well, in this case, you can't get your hands on that token unless you have more skin in the game and you provide liquidity.
00:24:14.298 - 00:24:31.042, Speaker B: And so the more lenders and borrowers that are participating in this radiant program, the deeper liquidity should become for radiant. And one other thing we're leaving out here is that it takes 90 days for these rewards to vest. Right? It's a linear vesting over 90 days.
00:24:31.176 - 00:24:32.018, Speaker A: So that's correct.
00:24:32.104 - 00:24:58.166, Speaker B: I'll let you explain this, Isaac, but this is just another way to ensure that, I want to say, mercenary types aren't able to ultimately come in and just benefit from the protocol and sell off the token, which really does when you just sell the token into the ground, I think it creates a flywheel of disparity.
00:24:58.358 - 00:24:59.002, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:24:59.136 - 00:25:00.090, Speaker B: In the community.
00:25:00.240 - 00:25:00.758, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:25:00.864 - 00:25:49.850, Speaker B: Folks, look at that price, and now the reward token is decreasing in price, so the rewards or the yield is decreasing. So now the protocol becomes less appealing, the token is going down in price. It can be very brutal for a lot of different protocols. What else do you need to know about how? Let's pretend I'm a lender or borrower. I have deposited $1,000 of ETH, and I want to earn that maximum issuance of the radiant token. I zap into $50 of radiant ETH Lp. So now I'm holding the minimum 5% requirement of liquidity.
00:25:49.850 - 00:25:55.998, Speaker B: What else do I need to do there? How do I lock up? How do I start vesting? What's the next step?
00:25:56.084 - 00:26:01.786, Speaker A: Okay, well, many things that you touched upon there on those questions, it's your guys fault.
00:26:01.818 - 00:26:07.474, Speaker B: This protocol is way too involved. Read the documentation after this.
00:26:07.512 - 00:26:47.054, Speaker A: I'm happy to dissect because there are very cool, many cool features, but it's really simple to understand once you start using the protocol. So as I said, you can lend, you can borrow, and you can provide liquidity below 5% or above 5% to start earning radiant tokens. That's all there is, really. As you said, whenever you want to maximize what you get out of radiant, of course there's the option of looping, which is basically repeating the borrowing cycle to increase your leverage. So effectively, your deposit amount increases, so you have to meet the 5% liquidity with respect to that increased deposit amount. That's something to bear in mind. So you cannot just loop for free.
00:26:47.054 - 00:27:26.598, Speaker A: Your provided liquidity has to meet the 5% of the total. So not 1000 ETH. But if you loop up to 2500, for example, then 5% of that total amount of loop deposits, and that's all there is. To start earning emissions. The interesting thing is we have added, first, we have tried to make the user experience as simple as possible with the zapping feature that you mentioned, which bundles a lot of transactions into one click. So whenever I want to provide liquidity, you have your radiant, you have your ETH, and you go directly into the LP with one click. It's not like many transactions with all those gas fees involved.
00:27:26.598 - 00:28:11.786, Speaker A: That's one thing. Then we have variable locking lengths. So whenever you provide liquidity, you have to say, you have to tell the protocol if you want to be in the protocol for longer or shorter periods, meaning that we can lock the LP tokens for one month, three months, six months, or twelve months. Of course, the longer the period, the longer the period, the more, the higher the yields, the more protocol fees that you're getting. So basically, for example, when I checked it yesterday, it was something like 197% if you locked for twelve months on arbitrary. So that's basically the longest locking period that you can have. Meaning that you are confident or you trust that your liquidity will be in the protocol for twelve months because you trust and you want your liquidity to be there for twelve months.
00:28:11.786 - 00:28:51.094, Speaker A: Of course, then you can auto relock. So whenever that period finishes, you can auto relock, meaning that the LP tokens will automatically relock again for the base for the default period, twelve months or six months, or whatever you selected. And what you mentioned regarding the radiant emissions, once you go above that 5%. So for example, coming back to your example, $1,000 worth of ETH, you need more than $50 worth of DLP tokens. So, liquidity tokens, to start earning that boost in radiant emissions, you start earning protocol fees from the first dollar of liquidity. But above $50, you get your radiant emissions. Once you receive your radiant tokens, there are basically three things that you can do.
00:28:51.094 - 00:29:43.458, Speaker A: You can, one, wait for 90 days for that token to be fully vested. Two, you can exit early during the vesting period. We have a linearly decreasing exit penalty from day one to day 89 or 90 because it's not the same, and we cannot penalize the same that a person who just exits on day one, or a person who exits on day 89, of course. And then the last option would be to claim your radiant tokens fully and zap them directly into LP from day one with no exit penalty. That's once again one of the coolest features of V two. Zap into DLP directly your new non vested radiant tokens, which effectively turn into vested radiant tokens. From day one, if you zap into DLP, if you provide them as liquidity into those liquidity pools, 80 20 on albitram or 50 50 with BMB on BSC.
00:29:43.458 - 00:30:16.594, Speaker A: So basically this means that you can wait for 90 days, and then you can have your fully vested radiant tokens to do whatever you want, trade with them, swap them, whatever you want, or you can, from day one, if you're trusting the long term sustainability of the protocol, you can just provide additional liquidity from day one with fully vested radiant tokens if you SAP them into LP tokens. So that's basically the three things that you can do with your radiant tokens once you start earning that boost in radiant emissions. Hopefully that was clear enough and easy to understand for anyone.
00:30:16.712 - 00:30:51.706, Speaker B: If you're slightly confused, you should be. There's so much detail to this, but I'm telling you that it's very thoughtfully designed. And I say all of this with zero bias. I don't hold the radiant token. I've just been really impressed by the lessons that this team has clearly taken from other protocols and thought, how can we ensure that we reward those who participate in the protocol, but we aren't taken advantage of by those who basically aim to take those rewards and then dump them?
00:30:51.888 - 00:31:29.730, Speaker A: Absolutely. And it's something we colloquially termed, like DFI 3.0. So we don't want to be DFI 1.0, as in 99% of protocols have been formed to zero because they showed crazy yields in the first days or weeks of the life. And of course, mercenary farming was attracted, and they just farmed the protocol to zero because they were emitting. It was like marketing, just because it was excessively incentivized emissions of their own native token. There was no real value behind, not a real long term value of the protocol.
00:31:29.730 - 00:32:08.982, Speaker A: And it was just for the crazy yields to attract TVL, which can be okay for a certain time. Radiant, for example, attracted a huge amount of TvL, over 500 million at some peak point. But that was mercenary farming. We learned the lesson in V one. We introduced a proposal, RFP two, which cut the emissions by half and sent the excess of emissions to the dow treasury. And we've improved the emission Runway so that it's now five years, because we realized that our vision required five years and not the originally thought two years. So it's something that's being optimized day to day with the input from core contributors, advisors, the huge value of our community.
00:32:08.982 - 00:33:09.378, Speaker A: But there are many cool things, as you were saying, and those features that you mentioned were just some of the features that we've input into the UX, into the UI, to make the UX the user experience as seamless as possible, but to reward primarily the small subset of users or large subset of users in the coming months that are really truthful, loyal to the long term sustainability of the protocol. Because otherwise it's not a sustainable business model if you're just highly incentivizing emissions attracting TVL, and then the TVL moves to the next coolest protocol in town. So that's the way we wanted to build it, and hopefully the flywheel will be a very positive flywheel in the coming weeks and months. Well, the first few days in BNB and BSE chain have been great. We've attracted a lot of TVL already and we are here for the long term. This is a huge vision, as we commented at the beginning to onboard the next 100 million users into DFI, you really cannot just be a bubble protocol.
00:33:09.474 - 00:33:57.094, Speaker B: I've got just a few more questions for you that actually came up as I was using the platform, and I've got a feeling other users are going to run into this. First off, no matter what, my position is lending, borrowing, whatever, let's assume that I have a dlp dynamic liquidity position provision, whatever it is, and it's staked. So I'm now qualified to earn these radiant emissions. The default lock length that you all have set up is for one month, but as a user, I can go in there and change that. The default lock length. This only refers to my 5% DLP. I'm using 5% as an example here.
00:33:57.094 - 00:34:02.794, Speaker B: It happens to be mine. That 5% position, that's all that I'm locking, right?
00:34:02.912 - 00:34:46.566, Speaker A: Absolutely. That's the thing that stays within the protocol for twelve months. The rest, the lending and borrowing position, you can unwind, or if you've been looping and you can unwind it, no problem. It's always important that and there's been a massive amount of work from members in the team focused on the UX UI side of things to make it as easy as possible, as handholding as possible for everyone. For example, you have a boosted emissions bar, so eligibility status bar if you want to see how far or close you are to the 5%. So that's on the top of the screen. You can easily see if you're above 5%, if you're coming closer to 5% for whatever reason, volatility, for example, or if you are below to 5%, how much more liquidity you would need to provide.
00:34:46.566 - 00:35:23.922, Speaker A: If you wanted to, to become eligible. Also, there's this cool feature, the health factor, which of course means how far or close you are to the maximum borrowing power you have. Of course, we are always, as in ave and other lending protocols, this is always over collateralized loans, so you cannot ask for more than you put in. Basically, this is called a loan to value threshold or limit. And it's a percentage, for example, 70%. If you deposit $1,000 worth of ETH, you can only borrow up to $700 worth of ETH, or whatever the LTV is at every specific moment. And this means that you have a maximum borrowing power.
00:35:23.922 - 00:35:58.826, Speaker A: If you try to borrow the maximum, you would only be able to borrow up to that 70%, for example. And this is shown by a very simple number, which is the health factor. If the health factor is above one, you are safe. You are above your maximum borrowing power. If the health factor is getting closer to one, and we even have the colors change, so it starts turning into yellow and turning into red as it closes to one. It helps you check your position every time you are trying to, for example, unwind the loop. To unwind loops, you have to start repaying your debt in every transaction.
00:35:58.826 - 00:36:35.414, Speaker A: It will show you what's your new health factor to make sure that you're not being in risk of liquidation or anything. So the UI is designed in a way to make you realize very visually how far you are from being eligible, how much more yield you would be getting, how close you are in terms of health factor to being liquidated, and how safe you are. And that's, of course, for you to do your own research and use your cushions buffers, however you want to be, if you want to be more risky or less risky. But it's all designed to make it as clear as possible so that you can maximize the yield with, of course, your particular investment strategy.
00:36:35.542 - 00:37:01.762, Speaker B: So let's say I'm a lender or borrower, I'm earning the radiant rewards. I've locked up this DLP, but then the value of my DLP falls below the 5% threshold, so I'm no longer eligible for the radiant token rewards. Can you explain, like, there's a really clever mechanism here to keep everybody incentivized, what happens?
00:37:01.816 - 00:37:28.198, Speaker A: Or what could happen? Yeah, well, I'm making notes of everything because there are so many things that I don't want to leave out. Cool. This is what we call the island. It's a bug bounty program that we have, or a bounty program. Not a bug bounty program, a bounty program. That we have inside the platform, it's really cool to use and anyone can use it anytime as long as they are eligible. And the way it works is basically people may have locked.
00:37:28.198 - 00:38:16.438, Speaker A: There is two ways that people may be getting ineligible rewards. One is if your LP tokens have gone past the locking period and the auto relock was not enabled. So basically, if you were locked for one month and it's one month on one day and your LP tokens are still there, you are getting rewards. Unless someone else in the community, in the protocol, reclaims those rewards. Second case is whenever your LP position goes below 5%, of course you're providing liquidity to our radiant ETH pool. So in this case, 80% radiant, 20% ETH and on arbitrum on balancer, as we said. And of course, due to the volatility price of ETH with respect to radiant, the US dollar value has to always be 5% or above.
00:38:16.438 - 00:38:48.440, Speaker A: If the USD value of your position was too close to 5% and due to volatility it goes below 5%, you will no longer be eligible. This will show on the eligibility status bar. So it will show that you're no longer eligible. And anyone in the protocol, of course the protocol cannot be checking this continuously because this is not an elegant way. It will consume too much gas. And the elegant way of doing this is for anyone in the community to run a bounty scan. And there's a very simple click, one click button that you can use on the platform.
00:38:48.440 - 00:39:33.726, Speaker A: It's a bounty scan button that you can click on it and you will see that it starts scanning all the users and it will show any users who have received ineligible rewards. This is a first come, first serve basis. So the first one who sees an ineligible user can click and claim the rewards that they have obtained. Thankfully, the rewards that are being obtained is so people are very active and so this is very clean. I've not been able to find ineligible users every time, anytime that I've done it myself. And judging from what the community members are saying, it's very active. So people are really trying to keep that clean and everyone eligible within the platform and within the protocol.
00:39:33.726 - 00:39:53.066, Speaker A: So that's basically the way it works. And it's like in the island game, being nominated and you go out of the island, you leave the island, it's the same. Whenever someone finds that you are ineligible, the ineligible rewards will come to your account, to your wallet, and that user, of course, will become ineligible and rewards will stop being directed to them.
00:39:53.168 - 00:40:34.070, Speaker B: Is it right to say you have to start vesting, you have to basically click a button to start vesting. Any lot like grouping of radiant tokens you've earned. You could have multiple lots of radiant tokens actually vesting, right? Or you could also have a lot of radiant tokens at risk of being taken away if you don't hit start vesting and then someone comes along because your DLP dropped below the 5% threshold. Am I understanding this all correctly because it really keeps you on your toes about managing and watching your position?
00:40:34.220 - 00:40:58.570, Speaker A: Absolutely. And everything that we are discussing is only summarized in two tabs. So it's only two tabs of the app that summarize all of this that we are talking about borrowing, depositing, looping, DLP, auto compounding, everything. Well, we didn't mention auto compounding. We can mention that too. Autorelog the variable locking periods vesting regarding your question, vesting starts as soon as you start it. So as soon as you click the button, it will start vesting.
00:40:58.570 - 00:41:51.822, Speaker A: If you want to vest, we commented the three options that you had. So claim early zap into DLP or start vesting. If you want to start vesting for the 90 day period and then claim your fully vested radiant after those 90 days, the vesting period will start as soon as you click and it will start for the unvested for the received radiant tokens which have not started vesting period. So if, for example, I have 13 radiant pending vesting, I can start my vesting period clicking on those radiant tokens. Those 13 radiant tokens would start vesting. If by tomorrow I have five additional radiant tokens and I start clicking, I would have 13 tokens in 90 days and five tokens in 90 plus one days because I started one day later. So basically you have batches of radiant tokens vesting for 90 days, depending on whenever you click the button.
00:41:51.822 - 00:42:12.630, Speaker A: So of course it's up to you, depending on the gas fees, transaction costs, if you want to wait for longer and have a larger batch of radiant tokens to start vesting, or if you want to vest every day, for example, or every seven days, however you want. But basically every batch of radiant tokens has to wait for the 90 day period.
00:42:12.970 - 00:42:32.298, Speaker B: Am I missing, is there an opportunity to just stake the radiant token? Or for those that are holding the radiant token that have it locked up or vesting, what are all the different fees that they are potentially earning while their token is vesting or locked up?
00:42:32.384 - 00:43:13.510, Speaker A: This is different from V one. Of course, in V one, you were collecting protocol fees when you were vesting for example. This is not the case in V two. So whenever you're investing, you're not collecting any protocol fees or any additional fees for your radiant tokens, and you have to wait for that 90 day period to start using your radiant token for whatever you wanted. If you want to provide liquidity to many of the different liquidity pools that have radiant on them, trader Joe or for example, plutus, dow for the DLP token, or others, depending on the different chains that we are launched on. So basically, you can wait for your radiant token and then provide it as liquidity. You cannot single sidedly stake your radiant tokens.
00:43:13.510 - 00:44:00.710, Speaker A: There are some options, buybit, for example, but it's like marketing actions from decentralized exchanges that want to incentivize the use of radiant. But as a whole, the protocol does not offer single sided staking opportunities for radiant. You have to provide liquidity and stake your LP tokens, or radiant plus ETH or radiant plus BMB. And it's once again trying to make sure that those who stake really are providing value to the protocol. Because, for example, in V one, that's one of the lessons that we learned. People were able to lock their radiant tokens and single sidedly receive protocol fees, even exit penalties. If you had locked your radiant tokens and locked radiant tokens, really were taking radiant tokens out of the market, they were not providing any value to the protocol.
00:44:00.710 - 00:44:22.250, Speaker A: So that's why we decided to get rid of single sided staking of radiant tokens. And that's why V two demands for you to provide liquidity with radiant and ETH. In essence, ETH's 80 20, so it's very close to single sided on arbitram, for example, but it's still providing a bit of your ETH to the liquidity pool.
00:44:22.410 - 00:44:50.294, Speaker B: One thing that's really important, I know, for the health of lending and borrowing markets is reliable liquidations. Anything to note that is different with liquidations on radiant? Does it work basically the same way as like an ave or compound? And then who does the liquidations? Because I noticed there's no dashboard I could find on the radiant website for liquidations. But if you can point us in the right direction there.
00:44:50.412 - 00:45:25.918, Speaker A: So basically, it works much in the way it works in Ave. So we are, as we said, we are a fork of abbeys. So we've changed many features, of course, but the liquidation works very much as it works in Ave. So anyone knowing that a particular user is in risk of liquidation can essentially trigger the liquidation. And of course it works like we explained in the docs. So it's interesting for the liquidator, it's interesting for the platform, and it's even interesting for the liquidated body, because of course their whole factor increases, although they lose part of the position. Of course, it's a 50% liquidation.
00:45:25.918 - 00:45:36.470, Speaker A: Just as a general headline, it works very much as in Ave, and it's something that we will be rolling out into the UI shortly in V two in the coming days and weeks.
00:45:36.620 - 00:46:20.178, Speaker B: Makes sense. I see that here. So if you go to docs radiant capital, just search liquidations and you'll see there's a whole page there. And this is something that's run by bots. So I'm going to assume that most listeners are probably not running bots, but if you want to learn more about it, it's there in the radiant capital docs. One major piece of news in the last few weeks is the arbitram token was released, and radiant, being one of the earliest builders on Arbitrum, being one of the most popular, most used applications on arbitrum, received an airdrop of 3.34 million ARB tokens.
00:46:20.178 - 00:46:41.850, Speaker B: So if we price ArB at like a dollar, $50 to $2, this is worth anywhere from like five to $6.68 million as of this recording on March 31, 2023. What's the plan for these tokens? Has anything been discussed in the forum yet or proposed that looks promising in radiant?
00:46:41.930 - 00:47:51.010, Speaker A: Not very formally at the moment, but of course, this is part of now Arbitrum's foundation goal of really trying to share the airdrop, the token, to those real users of the chain, not only airdrop farmers, and they were discussing the scheme of the pointing scheme. If you've been eligible, well, you will see that you had to meet at least three of the points or above to be eligible to receive the minimum amount of tokens. And from there, of course, you could receive many more. But they didn't want to share the tokens only with final end users. They really wanted to share a portion of the airdrop with dows, the most active Daos, because they believed that those active Daos, radiant, one of them and the biggest Daos in Arbitrum, also received a chunk of the tokens. They believed that these Daos would know the real users of the platform better, and they could further distribute, share, or do anything with those tokens which was more efficient for the whole of the arbitram ecosystem. Of course, this is something, in the case of radiant, this is something for our dao to decide.
00:47:51.010 - 00:48:39.490, Speaker A: The way it works in a DAO is that normally people share an idea on the feedback section of this course, which is an informal idea, not very complete in most cases. And this opens up the discussion, which is very lively, active, and engaged. And then whenever we have a clear idea as a community of what the real will of the community is, that is turned by the original author into a formal proposal following our template, and then it goes through a voting process, and then the DAO can vote in favor again. So that's how it is going to work for this airdrop tokens that radiant received. At this moment, there's no formal proposal or no formal discussion of the final use of those tokens. But I'm sure there will be an interesting discussion in the weeks to come. We've been very busy in the community.
00:48:39.490 - 00:48:54.038, Speaker A: I mean, in this case, discussing new assets to include new chains, to include new changes to v two, to v one, coming on to v two. The results obtained in BSc. So basically, there were many things to discuss before discussing the airdrop itself.
00:48:54.204 - 00:49:30.050, Speaker B: Yeah, and if you go to radiant capital, scroll to the very bottom of the page, there's a link there to the discourse, which is where all of the conversation is happening there around governance proposals. That's at community Radiant capital. You can also look at a history of all of the live proposals that have either been passed or voted down. And that's on snapshot, of course. So those are two great places to sort of get involved, aside from the discord that they have there for radiant. Two more questions for you. We've talked mostly today about arbitram.
00:49:30.050 - 00:49:37.314, Speaker B: Anything to share about your experience launching on binance smart chain?
00:49:37.442 - 00:49:59.354, Speaker A: Well, first, the first hours on BSc were hectic and crazy. It was wild. So I had never seen APRs so locking, looping. Sorry, Aprs of 2000%, 5000%. That was crazy. People in the community were saying, okay, don't invest your money. I will do all the investing for you for the first hours to get all the yield, of course.
00:49:59.354 - 00:50:42.918, Speaker A: And it was just very funny and wild to see everyone trying to jump onto BSc real quick because they saw that it was a huge opportunity of attracting jokes aside of attracting really sticky TVL. And that's what we're after on radiant. So great experience in terms of the amount of TVL that we've already been able to attract to the protocol on BSC. Some coming from our users on Arbitrum, surely, but some new TVL and much more to come. One of the reasons why we decided to launch on BSE was because it holds around 6 billion of TVL. So it's a huge chain in terms of TVL. The whole of crypto is something like 22 billion of fragmented liquidity.
00:50:42.918 - 00:51:39.030, Speaker A: So BSE was 6 billion alone. And it was a great environment where a lot of TVL was present. And it added up like a great combination or synergy, if you want, with arbitrum, which is a great ecosystem in terms of the DAPPs being built, in terms of GMX, Topex, or Trader Joe, all the great protocols, also the gaming protocols that are building a great ecosystem in arbitrum. And we felt that BSE was a great source of potential, interesting and sticky liquidity that was loyal to the long term sustainability and vision that we have at radiant. The narrative for real yields, DFI 3.0, all the business model, the sustainable business model that we were building with V two plus the transaction fees, were, of course, slightly higher than in arbitrum, but still competitive in terms of a small investor, which is also very important to us. We're addressing all kinds of investors, whales, medium investors, small investors.
00:51:39.030 - 00:52:18.310, Speaker A: And small investors can simply not loop in mainnet because it's too expensive. So it's $50, $100, or even more expensive whenever you have to do four or five of this borrowing and lending transactions. So Arbitrum was really competitive for that. BSE is proving to be very competitive, too. So still slightly more expensive than arbitrum, but still very competitive. So we're very happy to be launching on BSE, and then the plan is to be launched on five major EVM chains in the coming months. The following chains will be down to the Dow to decide, and there's already a cool discussion if the next one should be polygon or Phantom or whatever.
00:52:18.460 - 00:52:30.698, Speaker B: Let's leave with just what's next for radiant. Is there any other major updates that we should be looking for? Any proposals that you've seen in the forum there that we should keep our eye on?
00:52:30.784 - 00:53:20.374, Speaker A: Okay, well, most of the proposals now are for new assets to be added to the platform or new chains that radiant should launch on. So basically, regarding the chains, as I said, we will be launching our five major EVM chains down to the Dow to decide which particular chains those will be. Regarding the assets, our aim is to list more than 2020 plus assets which will be used as collateral types in the coming weeks and months. Some are already being discussed by the community. Of course, the voting period was left on standby during the transition from V one to V two. It will be started again shortly in the coming weeks, and those proposals will be voted. There will be a risk committee assessing the risk parameters for any new collateral types, and then the DAO will finally vote in favor or against those new collateral types.
00:53:20.374 - 00:54:03.798, Speaker A: Think magic, GLP, and so on will be collateral types which the DAO may be in favor of supporting in radiant. In any case, then that's an interesting feature. We tried to build this sustainable business model D five 3.0 for the next five years. We didn't want to do anything crazy or wild. So those new collateral types will not start receiving radiant emissions directly, because otherwise the share of radiant emissions going to the previous collateral types would be reduced. Of course, if you have to send the same number of emissions, the same amount to more collateral types, so that the first weeks or the first period of time during or just after the launch of a new collateral type will be used to evaluate the real interest of our community for that collateral.
00:54:03.798 - 00:54:54.374, Speaker A: If the collateral is being used, is being deposited, is being borrowed, the utilization rate is interesting. If we see that there's traction for that collateral, then the Dow can decide to start sharing a part of the portion of the emissions with that new collateral type. Otherwise it will remain as a collateral type that you can use to deposit a borrower. But no radiant emissions will be built on top of the base APY that you will be getting as a deposit. Those are the two major changes that we are seeing on radiant. Then there's discussion, interesting discussions in our community regarding, for example, credit scoring and optimizing the not necessarily going to under collateralized loans that will be further down the road, but at least optimizing the LTV for a small subset of users. So users who've been repaying the loans well and prudently in the past may receive optimized LTV.
00:54:54.374 - 00:55:16.098, Speaker A: So for example, changing from a 70 to a 72 or 73% LTV so you will be able to increase your borrowing power and so get better yields. That's something which has been discussed and then further collaborations with other protocols. But of course, the main discussion is currently regarding future collateral types supported and future chains that radian should launch in.
00:55:16.184 - 00:55:46.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd love to see higher LTVs, lesser liquidation penalties for those who have a proven track record. That would make quite a bit of sense. Isaac, thank you for letting me drag you through the mud of all the different fees and features and incentive designs there in radiant. I know it's got to still be somewhat challenging, even for you working full time on the protocol to keep it all straight. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we go?
00:55:46.480 - 00:56:16.898, Speaker A: Well, I'd like to encourage everyone listening to the show. Of course, we had a limited time. I would go on for hours explaining all the features and use cases and everything, like being a hands on tutorial. But of course I would encourage everyone to just try it out, just play with the platform, use it, use all the different features. As I say, there's been a massive amount of work to make it as seamless as possible, as handholding as possible. There are migration videos, you will see my face in small explaining the migration videos and so on. So we've tried to make it as easy as possible.
00:56:16.898 - 00:56:58.734, Speaker A: Our long term vision is to embark the next 100 million users into DFI. We tried to make a powerful, simple, seamless UI and Ux with V two, more so with V three. And I really encourage everyone to use app radiant capital and then follow us on our socials. Discord and Telegram Discord is very active and we are holding town hall office hour sessions every two weeks. So we are recording on the 31st. So next week, next Tuesday, we have our next office hour session for anyone wishing to pop around, come around and just ask any question or propose any new idea for the protocol. So very welcome and of course to share any proposal on our discourse, join in the feedback and the discussion sections.
00:56:58.734 - 00:57:15.142, Speaker A: It's really, really enriching to see all the ideas coming in and all the ideas and comments pouring in from our community. That's probably the best active asset that we have at Radiant, our community. So thanks for the time to explain Radiant. That's something I'm passionate about and so I could go on for hours.
00:57:15.276 - 00:57:59.026, Speaker B: Yeah, no, thank you so much. And yeah, definitely want to encourage folks to learn more at Radiant capital. You can also check out the app itself at app Radiant Capital. And then just a reminder, of course, none of this is a recommendation or endorsement to first use leverage. Using leverage is something that should be learned by reading the documentation there and taking your time to really understand all of the risks if you do use leverage. And then second, this isn't a recommendation or endorsement to buy or sell the radiant token, but you can learn more about the tokenomics and everything we discussed here today. Again, if you go to Radiant capital.
