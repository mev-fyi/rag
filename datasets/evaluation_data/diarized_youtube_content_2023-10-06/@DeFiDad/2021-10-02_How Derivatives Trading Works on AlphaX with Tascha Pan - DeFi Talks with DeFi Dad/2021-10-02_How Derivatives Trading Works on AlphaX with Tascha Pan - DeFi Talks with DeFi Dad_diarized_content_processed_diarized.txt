00:00:07.130 - 00:00:37.994, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, it's October 1, 2021. This is DFI. Talks with DFI dad. Today I'm going to be talking with one of the co founders of Alpha Finance, Tasha Pond. Tasha has joined me. Previously, I've been a big fan of what Alpha has built as really, I think, some of the newest, most like bleeding edge defi products. We're going to talk about a new derivatives product that they've created called Alpha X.
00:00:37.994 - 00:01:11.870, Speaker A: It's currently on Testnet. You probably know the name Alpha finance because they have been one of the early builders using leveraged yield farming. So that product was called Alpha Hamora. So this is a totally separate product, but it falls under the family of Alpha Finance products. Before we get started too, just full disclosure. Because of my team here at four RC, we do hold the Alpha token. That is not a recommendation or endorsement to buy the alpha token.
00:01:11.870 - 00:01:23.960, Speaker A: And as always, please don't follow anything we discuss here as a strategy. This is all for informational purposes only. All right. On that note, Tasha, welcome. How are you doing?
00:01:24.570 - 00:01:35.500, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, love coming and just talking about a lot of things. Right, like we've built Alpha Homora, now we're building Alpha X. So, yeah. More than excited to share what we've built.
00:01:35.870 - 00:02:05.010, Speaker A: Yeah. I just got to play with this product today. And again, it's on Testnet. So it's really easy if you just are willing to connect to your wallet and connect to the coven testnet on Ethereum. But it's a totally new product. It kind of reminds you of perpetuals on like a dy DX. But then also it has some of the flavor of an options protocol.
00:02:05.010 - 00:02:35.360, Speaker A: It's very different and new. I was joking around before we got started. I'm like, do you guys all smoke together and then come up with these new ideas? But anyways, now that I've embarrassed you, Tasha, do you want to give some background then to why did you all create Alpha X? I sort of covered the background of alpha finance as a protocol. But what problem are you trying to solve here with this new derivatives product?
00:02:36.210 - 00:03:03.574, Speaker B: Yeah. So we just see there's so many market gaps going on and the reason that it's still not captured is because something's not right. Right. So the first thing that we saw is that, hey, derivatives market is so huge, a lot huger than spot market in traditional finance. So that's one thing, right? But when you look on DeFi, that gap isn't as huge. So there's something missing there. Right.
00:03:03.574 - 00:03:49.190, Speaker B: And then now when you look at Defi, itself. I think a lot of the protocols are trying to simulate the experience that users get when trading on centralized exchange. A lot of times they target experienced traders. Right. But I think to make sure that we grow derivatives on chain or in DeFi, we need to approach from a very defi native and not applying from what works in centralized exchange. So hence we came up with Alpha X that you just mentioned that it has some flavor of official swaps, has some flavor of options, has some flavor of leverage tokens that we just coined a new term, the completely new concept strike token. Right.
00:03:49.190 - 00:04:05.820, Speaker B: And we think that this strike token concept is very defi native such that anyone in Defi can use. We don't want to only limit to experienced traders or experienced defi users. We want it to be an everyday product that any defi user can.
00:04:06.830 - 00:04:40.294, Speaker A: Yeah, and actually we can start to show this off right away. One thing I'll just quickly share this is from a medium post that I'll link to that you all just put up. Let's see. Here it is. So if you're going to approach alpha X in terms of is this exposure that I might personally potentially want. I like the way you laid it out here. There's like two simple questions.
00:04:40.294 - 00:05:46.540, Speaker A: Are you bullish or bearish on an asset? And then what do you think the price floor would be? If you're bullish, what's the lowest price you think it would go to? But then also if you're bearish, what do you think the highest price that that asset would go to? And then these are called strike tokens. So again, kind of reminds you in a way of options, but also at the same time you're getting exposure through a derivative. So in a way placed to the perpetual swaps that we use on a dy DX. And in this case we'll kind of talk through more of what's happening under the hood. There's no funding rate, which is one of the driving mechanisms behind perpetual swaps. And although that can be a good thing, it can also be something that's sort of eating up your profits depending on whether you're long or short. So on that note, Tasha, do you want to share your screen and we can actually talk through it on.
00:05:47.230 - 00:06:16.562, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so actually, let me just quickly show this infographic quickly. Right, so this is the document. Once you go to X testnet, alphafinance IO. This is the Alpha X testnet. All the important documents are here. So if you click on that doc, you will get to this main doc which has everything, including the video of how to use as well.
00:06:16.562 - 00:07:29.754, Speaker B: But if you go here to beginners guide, there's going to be this image, right? And this is all you have to go through in your mind before you use Alpha X. So super simple, right? If you are bullish, you want to long or if you're bearish, short. If, let's say you're in a bullish, which means that you think that asset is going to go up, right? So then the next question is, hey, what's the lowest point you think it may fall down to? Because you definitely think it's going to go up, but what's the alternative, right? So then you come up with the price for if. Let's say you think you are bullish on ETH and you don't think that ETH will come down to 1500, so that would be your price floor. So what you would do is you would just simply use uSDc to buy this long token that we call ETH -1500 so this 1500 is your price floor. And then that's pretty much it, right? You just wait until ETH goes up and then this will be multiplying the profits you get. And then if ETH comes down to a certain point, this token will get liquidated because then it hits the price floor that you've set.
00:07:29.754 - 00:07:40.378, Speaker B: And that's pretty much it. It's very simple. No funding rate like you mentioned, no rebalancing that people have to know. So let's get to the testnet.
00:07:40.474 - 00:08:28.798, Speaker A: Tasha, one question about that and yeah, let's show the actual live product. Let's pretend that I bought. So I'm bullish and I buy the long position. And at this point I'm betting that east doesn't go below 1500 as price goes up. What is the underlying exposure? Am I like two x levered? Basically a part of this that stuck out for me as I was looking through it. It feels like you've tried to abstract away the complexity of opening up a leverage position with a derivatives platform. And then I was almost looking at the 1500 as well.
00:08:28.798 - 00:09:10.090, Speaker A: Just the usual. It's like if I open up a two X position, I know that if the price falls a certain amount that I will be liquidated unless I close the position. Obviously as price falls, if I close the position, it's worth less money and I've taken a loss, but at least I haven't been liquidated, I guess. Am I sort of summarizing? You're accomplishing a similar thing to using another derivatives platform. But I want to say you've made it a little more dummy proof. It's as simple betting on what price floor will this stay above so that I don't get liquidated.
00:09:11.250 - 00:10:12.638, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you nailed it. Except there's one thing that's very different approach that we're taking off. So each token actually represents exposure to one of that asset. So let's say you hold one token of east -22 50, you're getting exposed to one east, same as if you're holding any of these long tokens. So it's just a matter of whether where you think the price floor is for the long tokens, but your exposure is always equal to the number of the tokens that you have. So that just makes it super simple, right? Because let's say if you're already holding ten ETH, for instance, and you think that, hey, with the down market, you want to short ease or to hedge, right? So you want to get exposure to ten short ease as well. So you can just simply choose the price ceiling that you don't think ETH price would go up to.
00:10:12.638 - 00:10:59.150, Speaker B: Let's say you choose 4400 minus east, and then if you want to get exposed to ten e, then you buy ten tokens of this. So it's different from, let's say, I think for the other platforms, you're thinking more of what's the leverage, right? Is it two X? Is it 1.5? And we just think that that's a very difficult question. Like, how do people know whether they want to do 1.5 or 1.6? Or how is that going to be different? But for us, for Alpha X, it's just a matter of are you bullish or bearish, do you think? What's the price floor price ceiling? And then how many of that asset you want to get exposed to? If you want, if you get exposure to ten e, you buy ten tokens. If you want two ETH, you buy two.
00:10:59.150 - 00:12:01.700, Speaker B: So it's super simple. And let me quickly show you this table. So let's say, given that ETH is 3000, the initial capital that you have to spend to get that exposure is 3000, right? So if you were to buy one ETH, you have to spend this much. If, let's say you were to buy ETH -1500 which means that this token itself is costing 1500, and this number comes from literally taking the 3000, which is the ETH price -1500 here, and then you're getting the 1500, which is the value of the token. So you are spending half of the capital to get the same exposure of one east, and hence your capital efficiency is two x. So that's why we focus more on capital efficiency as opposed to leverage itself, because we think leverage is kind of confusing as well in terms of how many leverage you want to do.
00:12:03.910 - 00:13:08.940, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're actually helping people to size their position. This is something that if you're a full time trader, this hopefully is a part of their regiment. But I do think because Defi makes it so much easier to access products like this, there's just that many more people that are looking to explore how does leverage work? How can my money be that much more efficient so that I can potentially profit from the upside on some of these tokens, or potentially from the downside if you're shorting it makes sense to me. I tend to normally think about, I open up a position and I think about how much am I willing to lose? That's the question that I used to ask myself when I did more trading. Now with this, I can sort of simplify that and think more about, okay, where am I willing to bet that the price isn't going to go above or below?
00:13:10.910 - 00:13:50.262, Speaker B: Yeah. Also super easy for you to know how much the token costs. So if you go to Alpha X here, these are long tokens, these are short tokens. The long tokens, as we said earlier, is you want to take a long position of it, you're bullish of it, right. If you think the lowest it can go is 2000, for instance, which in this case is east, then you would buy the E -2000 token. So these are all tokens. Right? And then for you to know how much this token costs, or like the actual token value, simply just plug in the ETH price into the ETH here.
00:13:50.262 - 00:14:10.540, Speaker B: So let's say if we assume that ETH price is 3000, then this token is going to be worth 1000. So yeah, as simple as that. And hence we show the price here of the price of the token itself. You can substitute this ETH price here into here, and you would get the token value.
00:14:11.790 - 00:14:25.550, Speaker A: Sweet. Tasha, could we. Could we go ahead then and yeah, let's open a position. I did this earlier. And again, I think it's a lot easier once you see it in motion.
00:14:26.210 - 00:14:52.070, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So when technically open position, it's literally just buying these tokens. So let's say I want to buy this easement s 2000. Then I click trade here. It would pump you to this trade page. Looks quite similar to uniswap by design, because under the hood it's uniswap V two. So these are literally like you're using USDC to buy this token on uniswap.
00:14:52.070 - 00:15:57.230, Speaker B: But we're making it a lot simple here to show the UI here, right? So let's say if I just put I want to have an exposure to five E, so I want to get five token of this. So we put five here, instead of requiring a lot larger than this amount, I only have to pay 6200 to get exposure to five E. If not, you would have to pay like 15, 16,000. And then after that there's a lot of these information that you show here. These two are quite important, these two lines. So this just means that if ETH price drops down from 30 to 20 that we are here now to about 2400, then your token is going to be liquidated. Or if the token price, which is now at 22 29, going to come down to 400, that's when your token is going to be liquidated as well.
00:15:57.230 - 00:16:01.550, Speaker B: So from there, once you confirm, you just click swap.
00:16:03.830 - 00:17:24.186, Speaker A: There we go. Yeah, I think one example I could think of once this is live on Ethereum mainnet is not knowing where we are in this market cycle, but let's assume we have more room to go up. I could start to hedge against where that top of the market is. And let's say for example, I wanted to short ten ether, thinking that we're not going to go above eventually here, maybe we'll have some 10,000 strike tokens. So then I could say, okay, well I'm going to buy ten of those strike tokens for 10,000 ETH. It's just a little bit like I find the thinking here a little bit easier to absorb than the usual sort of education that one needs, I think to even start to use a derivatives platform and be able to hedge out in certain market conditions. So this to me is like, I don't know, it's some weird splice between like there's leverage tokens that like the ETH fly tokens by index co op that are really interesting.
00:17:24.186 - 00:18:13.610, Speaker A: They've been really popular. They allow someone to get two x exposure to ETH or wrapped bitcoin. This though allows you to also short if you'd like to. So again, just, it's very promising to me this is what DeFi is supposed to do is take some really powerful products and not only simplify them and make them faster and easier to use, but in this case start to create some new Defi native products. This to me is a net new sort of defi product and again starts with am I long or do I want to potentially short? And where do I think that price floor is if I'm bullish? Or where do I think that ceiling is if I'm bearish?
00:18:15.230 - 00:18:42.482, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And that's pretty much it. That's all the thinking you have to do. And here you will see the token that you just bought showing up on my page. So here I have bought a number of tokens before this, but the ETH -2000 is here. It shows how many tokens you have, which the number of tokens here equal the number of ETH exposure. So technically you can think of this as you're holding 6.39
00:18:42.482 - 00:18:52.440, Speaker B: east, right. But in a more capital efficient way because you're spending only 7000 plus dollars as opposed to like 15,000.
00:18:54.490 - 00:19:26.446, Speaker A: By the way, one thing we didn't cover here is, is there an incentive then to mint these strike tokens? I guess, should we anticipate that there will be some incentive? That's one thing we haven't really covered here. I'm assuming pending what liquidity is there, if there's enough, I should be able to just buy a longer short token. But I'm assuming some of the bigger money that comes in will probably look to mint those tokens.
00:19:26.638 - 00:20:06.734, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. Actually, we will have liquidity mining when we launch on Mainet. So if you go down from the home page, you will see these liquidity providing pools. Right? So there are two ways you can kind of gain from this. One way is definitely, let's say I just bought ETH -2000 right? I bought it from the market and then I can take this token to provide liquidity. And then you would already gain liquidity mining rewards from there. So here you can just simply provide, or if you're a bit more advanced, you don't want to buy from the market, you can mint as well.
00:20:06.734 - 00:20:28.754, Speaker B: So if you mint, let's say when you mint, you would need to mint each of the tokens. So one long, one short. And then once you have two tokens, you're actually like delta neutral, right? Because if you take this token plus this token, it equals one e net. So that just means that you have.
00:20:28.792 - 00:20:54.078, Speaker A: Like clearly I have not thought about that. That's really cool. That's really cool. So you're enabling. This is awesome. This is the sort of thing that, this is why I wanted to do this, to see what else is under the hood. So each of those, if you go to mint and become an LP, you are opening a delta neutral position, but then you're earning the trading fees from all of this, right?
00:20:54.244 - 00:20:56.958, Speaker B: Yeah. And liquidity mining rewards too.
00:20:57.044 - 00:21:01.950, Speaker A: And the liquidity mining. Wow, this is cool. And you're minting all of these with USDC?
00:21:02.550 - 00:21:39.034, Speaker B: Yeah. So technically, this is your collateral to mint. So this is not lost or anything. So let's say once you decide to remove liquidity or redeem back, so you can come back to redeem supply one long token, one short token. So minting and redeeming have to be in a pair of one long and one short. So once you supply one long, one short, it will combine and give you the underlying USDC. It doesn't have to be a particular long pairing with a particular short.
00:21:39.034 - 00:21:43.360, Speaker B: It can be any long pairing with any short. So it's quite flexible too.
00:21:44.690 - 00:22:15.830, Speaker A: Really cool. I was excited already about just, I think, the newness of this product. But anytime you can put up stable coins and in this case, open up a delta neutral position, this is potentially something that would interest me, at least my portfolio. That's cool. Okay. Yeah, that's really cool. Tasha, do we know when this is expected to go live on Mainnet?
00:22:16.410 - 00:22:19.610, Speaker B: Yeah, it should be in a few weeks, in October.
00:22:20.110 - 00:23:12.090, Speaker A: Nice. And then I think, just remind everyone the usual risks will exist here. In the past, I've bought Nexus mutual insurance when I use alpha Hamora leveraged yield farming. I'm sure we'll see Nexus bridge unslashed. Whoever, everyone will eventually offer insurance here. But also worth noting just that this is newer code. So aside from the fact this isn't investment advice, I would caution anyone like, this is a new product and as excited as I am to use it and try know there can be unforeseen issues or even exploits in code.
00:23:12.090 - 00:23:20.010, Speaker A: But, Tasha, have you all been able to already get this audited or is an audit in progress?
00:23:20.430 - 00:23:25.310, Speaker B: Yeah. So this has been audited by consensus and opensipline. Two audits.
00:23:25.650 - 00:23:51.686, Speaker A: Excellent. Yep. And then one more reminder to everyone, audits help, but as always, audits don't guarantee that nothing unexpected like an exploit could happen. But that's really great. Yeah, those are two reputable auditors to have already completed this. Gosh. Anything else, Tasha, that you think people should know about? You know, reminder to them too.
00:23:51.686 - 00:24:21.150, Speaker A: They can go here to this website. All you have to do is connect an Ethereum wallet. And this is on Testnet. So you mint the mock USDC in the bottom left, the little green button, and so you're not risking anything at this point. This is truly like this. I can advise this is a mock product at this point to play with the future product is the one where you really should make your own financial decisions.
00:24:22.470 - 00:25:02.742, Speaker B: Yeah. So, pretty much. I think one last thing that we want everyone to be aware of, right, is the liquidation point. So definitely, let's say on the home page, you see here the risk level, right? So that means that these tokens can be liquidated. What that means is if you come to trade page here, you can see these two things that I mentioned earlier. So for instance, this ETH -2000 will be liquidated not when the ETH price is at 2000, because that would be exactly at your price for. Right.
00:25:02.742 - 00:25:45.542, Speaker B: We need to have some buffer. So this token will be liquidated when ETH comes down to 2400. So 2400, a bit of buffer from here. Or if you want to think of this as the token price. So this particular token, which is now at 1229, have to come down to 400 before it gets liquidated. And then what happens when it's liquidated? That means liquidators come in, all the liquidated tokens will be shown up here, they can do the liquidate function, and then they help maintain the solvency of their protocol. You will not lose everything in the token value after liquidated.
00:25:45.542 - 00:26:06.660, Speaker B: You can actually claim it back. So you can claim 70% of the token value back even after liquidated. So here the liquidated tokens will be shown here. This ethanf 2700 that I bought a long time ago got liquidated. So I can claim whatever is left, which is here at about zero point 13 amount.
00:26:07.510 - 00:26:24.920, Speaker A: Interesting. Wait, I didn't realize that then. So even when you get liquidated here, there is quite a bit more leftover than I think, what we're used to seeing when someone gets liquidated, and you were estimating, what was it, about 70% would be left over?
00:26:25.370 - 00:26:29.720, Speaker B: Yeah. So 70% of the value of the token value.
00:26:31.070 - 00:26:52.960, Speaker A: Another maybe quick hack. If you go back to the trade page or my page, if you look in the bottom right there, the capital efficiency, I mean, that can be what likened to if someone said, I have 3.3 x leverage, right? Am I thinking about that correctly or is that the right language to use?
00:26:53.830 - 00:27:28.700, Speaker B: Not quite. So this is comparing if you were to buy, let's say, one ETH, right, versus if you were to buy one token of ETH -22 50, which gives you the same exposure of one e, but you're actually using a lot lower initial capital when buying this token. So in terms of capital efficiency here, it's how much more capital efficient are you to buying this token as opposed to just buying the actual ease itself.
00:27:29.970 - 00:27:49.746, Speaker A: Okay, got it. What I just said was incorrect then. So it's not a 3.3 x leverage. Yeah, well, hopefully, too, in the future. I'm hoping I can end up doing a tutorial too, as I'm trying to play with this once it's live. But yeah.
00:27:49.746 - 00:28:15.290, Speaker A: Thanks so much, Tasha. This was super interesting. Clearly a net new product to me. I just kind of dug into it, you know. Again, everyone should follow your team. This is the core team at Alpha Finance on Twitter. You can also follow Tasha on Twitter if you go to their website at alphafinance IO.
00:28:15.290 - 00:28:43.730, Speaker A: That is where you'll also find a link to their discord. So there's a really active community there that you can learn from. And then also there's the actual Alpha X on Testnet. That's on the coven testnet. So if you're using metamask, just flip it to coven. As long as you have some testnet ether in there. There's an option there then to mint mock USDC.
00:28:43.730 - 00:28:57.000, Speaker A: And if you enjoy this, please subscribe@defiedad.com. We'll continue to do live streams like this and lots of tutorials to help folks learn more about defi. Tasha, anything else you wanted to say before we go?
00:28:57.850 - 00:29:25.440, Speaker B: Yeah, just give it a try. It may seem daunting with all these new terms, but once you understand, which actually is not hard at all, you will think, damn, this is pretty easy to use. So, yeah, I would recommend starting from the video that we have to the guide of how to use Alpha X, which can be found on the document under the testnet section. So start from there. It's just only ten minute video, and then you would. All set?
00:29:25.970 - 00:29:53.074, Speaker A: Yeah, that's at blog alphafinance IO. That's a great place to sort of learn more about all of this. And, yeah, if you have any questions, I would actually recommend just tweeting at some of the tweets for this video and would love to help answer that. So, anyways, thanks so much, Tasha. And I'm going to just end the broadcast here, and we'll be in a green room here in a sec. So, bye, everyone. Have a great weekend.
00:29:53.074 - 00:29:54.230, Speaker A: Thanks for joining.
00:29:54.570 - 00:29:55.410, Speaker B: Thank you. Bye.
