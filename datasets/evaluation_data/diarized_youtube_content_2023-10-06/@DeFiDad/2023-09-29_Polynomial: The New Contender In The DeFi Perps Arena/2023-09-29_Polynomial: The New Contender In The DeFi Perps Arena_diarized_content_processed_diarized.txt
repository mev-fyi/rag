00:00:00.330 - 00:00:35.720, Speaker A: The perps are such a good instrument that, you know, people wanted to use, people started using FTX for it, and they all lost their money. And the biggest issue we saw is that it's controlled by like a few centralized exchanges, right? And the best thing is that you can make perps for any illiquid market, right? And for crypto, it has a product market fit. You see people trading trillions, like in the peak of world market, like 2 trillion of perps was traded per month last year or something, year or two. So we wanted to make that same thing happen on a decentralized exchange, and we wanted to do our part to do that.
00:00:38.170 - 00:01:23.320, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad, and I'm here with my friend and co host from four RC nomadic. Today's show features an emerging giant in the world of decentralized perps trading. Polynomial protocol this spring, Polynomial launched its decentralized perps exchange with up to 25 x leverage on top of optimism, using synthetics as its source of liquidity. Since then, polynomial has seen enormous growth to become one of the top synthetics perps trading front end if not number one. Any given day in this episode, we'll dig into what's attracting so much trading liquidity to polynomial and how they plan to sustain their growth as a DeFi derivatives powerhouse. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.

00:01:52.210 - 00:02:31.370, Speaker C: Hey everyone, my name is Kaido. I'm a co founder at Utopia Labs, and today we're really, really excited to be announcing and launching a feature called USDC bank transfers. We're basically allowing for any company based anywhere in the world to be able to send USDC to any US bank account, whether that US bank account is a US citizen or a person who might have something as simple as a wise account. If we zoom out. Since a year ago, there's been a chokehold on kind of the interoperability and seamlessness between traditional rails and crypto rails. We put a lot of time and effort into this to be able to provide a smooth end experience for you as a consumer or as a company using crypto and using traditional financial rails.
00:02:34.690 - 00:03:16.330, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas. One gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to Instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:03:16.910 - 00:03:23.550, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce Gotham, the co founder of polynomial protocol Gotham. Welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:23.620 - 00:03:50.582, Speaker A: Yeah, hey, guys. I'm doing very well. I'm Gotham. I'm one of the people behind polynomial. So polynomial is D five perps exchange. So we let people trade perps. We have around 45 plus markets, and we have one of the lowest fees on chain from two to six pps with up to 58 leverage, which makes it, like, a very interesting venue for anyone who wants to trade perps edge their portfolio or any of the other things.
00:03:50.636 - 00:04:12.246, Speaker B: It's funny, I did not realize you were up to 45 markets now, but it's grown so much since the launch of polynomial. So why don't we start with the usual background? Can you share anything more about just some of the other defi that you had worked on or maybe that you had been involved in before you started building polynomial?
00:04:12.358 - 00:04:47.986, Speaker A: Yeah, polynomial started like, two years ago. We went to an global hackathon, and we just looked at that entire defi space, and we realized there is a lack of derivatives on chain. And if you look at any traditional finance, you see that derivatives are one of the biggest sectors that exists. So at that time, we started by building our own option succeed, which we realized is very hard to do. And then slowly, we build a product around it. And the first product we launch was an option vault, which is basically, you are selling call or put options weekly. So it was a very interesting idea at that time.
00:04:47.986 - 00:05:35.686, Speaker A: The issues with that is mostly that options as a derivative instrument wasn't getting any more adoption. And we just realized, to scale this options, the instrument has to gain a much more bigger market share. And if you look at it, there have been many players who were earlier on the option game, like people like open, who realize options assetors from traditional finance might not work on thing. And one of the things that we did on a dov or an option vault is that we made, like, an expiry list option. So we think that instruments without expiry are the ones that are going to lead the derivatives, at least in the long term future. Because crypto is so volatile, you cannot predict even a week. And we just realized that an instrument that can perfectly capture that.
00:05:35.686 - 00:06:10.610, Speaker A: And if you look at, if you take all the instruments and rank them on a scale, we give like a spot market, like a one point score. And if you take traditional futures or options, like a two point, perps are maybe like three points, because if you trade like perps, you can get much higher leverage. Like you get leverage up to 50 x. And in traditional futures, you can't get that much price. And the price also deviates in traditional futures. So for a person, generally using options is mostly for trading like 15 to 20 x leverage when they want to trade on here. Perps can give that.
00:06:10.610 - 00:06:57.634, Speaker A: So we think that in a gradual shift of the market, people would generally prefer using perps because it's, first of all, much simpler as an instrument that you don't need to know all the math and all the things behind it, which takes an incredibly amount of time to get used to and from the market participants. What they have seen is a lot of the people who are trading options are mostly like market makers and complex people. And the other side is retail, who's mostly moving money. And so we wanted to make a much simpler instrument, which actually is very popular in crypto at the moment. Right. And the biggest issue we saw is that it's controlled by a few centralized exchanges, right? And the perps are such a good instrument that people started using FTX for it and they all lost more money. And that's kind of what happens.
00:06:57.634 - 00:07:41.486, Speaker A: And the best thing is that you can make pulps for any illiquid market. You have an illiquid market like, let's say we have illiquid markets like flokey or all those kind of assets which are not even very low liquidity, right. But you can make pulse for it. You cannot do that in some instruments like normal features or options. So as a derivative, when we started, the company wanted to build something which makes the crypto much, much better. And because with having a very good, stable derivative market, crypto price will be less volatile and more widely, more people would be hedging, and it could become a much better thing. So it kind of like a very large thought process which lasted for a very long time.
00:07:41.486 - 00:08:17.082, Speaker A: And we raised heightened that. What we need to tackle is that the perks are very good product. And for crypto, it has a product market fit you see people trading trillions, like in the peak of bull market, like 2 trillion of perks was traded per month last year or something. Year or two, in fact. So we wanted to make that same thing happen on a decentralized exchange, and we wanted to do our part to do that. What can we build around it? And that question and the thought process around it made us think about how to make a good pulps. And we made polynomial trade because of that.
00:08:17.082 - 00:09:01.834, Speaker A: And currently, we have a wide range of assets, and we think that having a large variety of assets is the main game plan for us, at least, because we have around 45 markets. And some of those assets we have is not even possible on a centralized exchange. For example, we have staked bead. You can trade stake be, don't polynomial, you cannot trade it anywhere else. So having these wide variety of crypto assets will bring all these, or we have USDT some people who want to use it. So what will happen is when some event, something happens in crypto, people will just move their funds and start using it. And we think they will keep on using our platform because it gives the best user experience on all those kind of things which they really want.
00:09:01.834 - 00:09:07.434, Speaker A: And we are slowly striving towards it. Without promising decentralized Gotham, you started to.
00:09:07.472 - 00:09:59.318, Speaker B: Talk through the most important product, I think the most popular product on polynomial, because I guess if you go to the website, like polynomial, like your mantra, Logan, there is the Defi derivatives powerhouse. So I think a lot of us now know it as the top Dap or one of the top two places to be trading synthetix perps. But you do have these other products, like polynomial earn. Can you just give us the quick rundown of all of the different products that are now offered? We mentioned perps already. Are those options vaults or the polynomial earn vaults? Are those going to stick around? Like, do you anticipate launching more of those? And then, if you can, talk about the other newer product called strategies.
00:09:59.414 - 00:10:29.494, Speaker A: So the truth is, we shut down on vault. It's been like three months, and we killed it because we don't see that much adoption happening for options. So we wanted to focus on perps. And it's more like, do you want to do one thing really well, or do you want to do a bunch of stuff? So we were like, okay, just focus on the thing that is working. And the perps have been performing really well. Like, for example, we had an all time high of like, 350,000,000 per day. And we just launched, like, four months ago.
00:10:29.494 - 00:11:29.986, Speaker A: Four or five months ago, we launched on one day before the April fool's day. Essentially, it's been an interesting thing because we have grown to around 2 billion in volume. Sometimes in the burbs amm space, we are the one with the highest amount of volume, and sometimes we are in the top three, at least most of the days. And so then, other than that, one thing we have seen is we wanted to make a decision on how we build the product. And the way we decided is we'll focus on larger size things, like whales in general, because D five pulps, even though l two s are there and the gas is low and all that stuff, the price for trading purps needs to be, at least on the gas size, should be much lower. So it's very ideal for a person who is trading like $5,000 and above. And if you are trading less, most of the time, people prefer using a centralized exchange.
00:11:29.986 - 00:12:19.590, Speaker A: But if you're trading like five K work, we provide one of the best places. If you are trading against the market, sometimes you even make money on polynomial, because the liquidity pool is trying to give away the risk and you're taking it for the pool. It's like giving you extra money to just take a counter trade against the market. Which makes it really interesting that we see million dollar trades, same wheels happening every few hours or so, things like that, when something like that happened. So that dynamics has been improving. And so to focus more on the power users, what we did is we built a bunch of things. One of the things that we did was we added things like multiple authority, which is like, people generally have two or three devices, like you have a mobile, you have your hardware wallet and all that thing.
00:12:19.590 - 00:12:46.170, Speaker A: So one of the fundamental things we decided in the beginning was like, polynomial is going to be a smart contract wallet. So no more approvals, nothing like that. So when people first deposit money into the smart contract wallet, they can just send it from anywhere. You can send it from a centralized exchange, you can send it from anywhere. You can deposit also, and then the money goes into the smart contract wallet, and then all the trading happens. So we are able to do a much more cleaner way of doing it. Like you can.
00:12:46.170 - 00:13:24.750, Speaker A: Multiple transactions are bashed into a single thing, and which allows us to do things like trade with the other stable coins. And also we have this authority thing where you can trade from your mobile and your desktop and all these things at the same time. Or if you want to make a bunch of friends and trade together, you can do that. Also, we wanted to focus a lot on the power races. And one of the things that we have seen is the current mechanism of how the perps work is that we use that synthetic security providers. And what happens is the LPs want to remain neutral. And how that happens is by modifying the funding rate.
00:13:24.750 - 00:14:19.534, Speaker A: And when you modify the funding rate, essentially is that the funding rate over here is based on something called funding velocity. So in a simpler term, what you can say is if the funding rate is positive and the market is more, people are positive and bullish about the funding rate and slowly increase. So what will happen is the LPs will have some exposure. So what happens over there is, as I said before, if you come and shorter that, and you'll get some money and you'll just collect the funding rate. So a lot of people were making this delta neutral position on DyDX or finance, and then by shorting on, let's say, ETH market, by funding rate, shorting ETH on polynomial, and going there and hedging that question. And it used to give like good APY, like people were earning like 30% to 98 bits on your risk profile. And after we noticed that this was a very big beginning, it happened with Wales, we realized, okay, let's make this easy for people.
00:14:19.534 - 00:15:02.598, Speaker A: And so we made this thing called strategies, where people can have a delta neutral portion with E, just enter the capital, just enter the leverage you want, and then just, you have a portion. If you do it manually, it's like eight clicks. That's the only thing that we did over there. So it's more like, how do we make the experience for the pro users much, much better? And that has been the core driver of the volume for us in the past few months, at least. And we wanted to focus more on that and make the experience as smooth as a centralized exchange, and maybe much, much better, because at least from my side, the goal is to be better than them and not just researching. So that is also a good factor.
00:15:02.694 - 00:15:40.842, Speaker E: Gotham, it's funny, you actually answered most of what my next question was going to be about there. And in your answer, there's like a ton of stuff to unpack. But a few of the things that really stood out to me. A lot of the issues you're tackling seem to be on the UI UX side and making the user experience paramount. But I still want to ask my question, because I'm curious. Other things you're doing to maybe create a competitive advantage against some of the other people in the perp trading landscape. And you mentioned some of them like DydX, GMX, gtrade, I guess.
00:15:40.842 - 00:15:52.618, Speaker E: What are you doing to differentiate and draw in users that they aren't? And kind of like what sets polynomial apart from some of these other competitors, if you want to call them.
00:15:52.704 - 00:16:40.362, Speaker A: So if you compare with Dydx or someone like us, the difference over there is dividends is kind of like trying to replicate what finance is doing. And so what that means is that they have their own chain or they have their own l two, and they do an order and an order book sufficiency is very much for a personal book, how well you can have market vehicles and how many market vehicles you have, because that will define how much slippage you have and all those things. Right. And currently, market vehicles are very bad. So if you go to very long term assets, slippage and liquidity would be really bad. Right. And the advantage of an AMM based poke like us is that when you make a very large trade, regardless of the size, whatever is the price that we're actually saying, and whatever is like a small basic factor, that is the price that you would get.
00:16:40.362 - 00:17:09.046, Speaker A: So you can make like a $10 million trade, or you can make like a 15 million, $20 million trade and with a single button. But if you try to do it in an order book, it would take as much time as you want, because if you just do a market order, you're pretty much screwed. Right, but it based on the depth of. So it's more like how to opposing code farther, because order books are very well understood. So it brings in a lot of market. So it depends on how you want to think about it. Right.
00:17:09.046 - 00:17:40.046, Speaker A: So we have seen this earlier in the unison also. A lot of people tried to make order book for exchanges, but it didn't work out. But nowadays, l two is there, and a lot of people are trying it saying that it might work. But we think people use FedEx like Unisa, because it inherently gives something better than a normal output. Similarly, we think that having an Amm based would be much better in the longer term. In terms of innovation, you can make more complicated things. You can have permissionless market.
00:17:40.046 - 00:18:10.774, Speaker A: Like if somebody spins up a Mario, like anyone can just say that. Let me just lift the purpose for that. You can have a lot more things without going into third parties and doing those things. So I think that is the main game plan on the amm based perp side. So for us at least, the main thing is on ponogranate, the LPs are like synthetic cycles, and the LPs remain neutral. And how they remain neutral is basically due to two mechanisms. One is the funding velocity.
00:18:10.774 - 00:18:48.614, Speaker A: Basically they just modify the funding rate so that the risk is offloaded. And one more thing is the slippage. Sometimes if you are trading against the market you get positive slippage. Even so, if you can go, there is a fault tab in the polynomial markets and you can just see you get a discount or a premium. So based on the direction you take, you can do things like that. And from our side we have been mostly focused on the UX side. We wanted to let the synergy people handle the perps mechanism and all those things.
00:18:48.614 - 00:19:25.054, Speaker A: So for us the main focus has been how can we make the user experience as good as possible. And we started with rack wireless because that helps us do much more stuff. For example, I talked about the strategies. So in the strategies we are interacting with both Aave and polynomial at the same time. And you just happen to do it like one click. We can do those collection based things without affecting the main contract or changing the user funds. It's just like saying like okay, instead of using this protocol we write a new connector and say go to that, go and use that thing.
00:19:25.054 - 00:19:53.990, Speaker A: So it's very close and it's a very good way of adding and integrating products. So that has given us an advantage on speed on integrating and building new features. So that has been one of the main core drivers of what we do. We have in the MSI feature addity and things like that. We are leading on the text per side. At least we have many more features and things like that around. So that has also been advantages.
00:19:53.990 - 00:20:45.706, Speaker A: And there are things like limited, which we do. And what we did earlier was we used to use chain link Oracle for sending it, which is similar to how other pops enter. And we realized like okay, this thing sucks because we were using chain link and it used to be delayed because chain link in worst case takes like few minutes to update. By that time you might get liquidated, right? Like nobody wants to do that. And we launched it and we were like very cool, two weeks in data and we were like, okay, not a lot of people are using it. And then we just talked to the user and we just realized, okay, this thing is pretty crap, right? And what we did was like okay, let's need to fast and low latency oracle. So we use a pipe one which is the same one as in the textbooks and we just shipped it out in two, three weeks.
00:20:45.706 - 00:21:27.670, Speaker A: And in terms of the main advantages for us at the moment is that we have been shipping things constantly and that has been like it will constantly evolve over time. And being the funds, being in a smart contract wallet means that the user remains isolated from the risk. So that also is like a mode on us. There is a whole account exception, kind of why also hacking in crypto. So understand. If true, though, I am a strong proponent of every app should make their own wallet or something like that, so that you get rid of all this crap like approval and all. It's bad idea.
00:21:27.670 - 00:21:31.782, Speaker A: Just get rid of all those kind of stuff and make the user experience as simpler.
00:21:31.846 - 00:21:47.086, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say you're on a fairly short list of kind of front facing user apps that are utilizing account abstraction already with the smart contract wallets. And I think it makes a lot of sense for the setup that you're doing.
00:21:47.188 - 00:22:08.550, Speaker B: Polynomial has been running on the synthetics perps op program. It was like a 20 week program launched in the spring. I think it's been a huge success for synthetics perps. It's notably been a success with polynomial. How do you keep growing polynomial without those op rewards?
00:22:10.410 - 00:22:44.302, Speaker A: That's a good question. Currently, there is a lot of people who are trading because kind of rate to trade, and that offsets the price. The way we think about it is when you are trading perps on chain trade, you make some compromises. One is on latency, still slower, and the other one is like gas and stuff like that. You want to place a trade, it costs like two, $3. Even if you place like a very small trade, it costs like $4. And if you make like a very big trade, it will cost $4 plus the fee.
00:22:44.302 - 00:23:03.942, Speaker A: I'm talking about the base. So that essentially is the big barrier. Right? So we wanted to make sure those things are much better. And the fees, we wanted to be more competitive. Right now, it's two and six. We think it will get lower and lower with time as the volumes increase. Right.
00:23:03.942 - 00:23:41.362, Speaker A: So currently, the main thing is that it's more like we were on a building spree to acquire, to bring a bunch of people, try out our platform, see if it's a good option. And I think in the future, they tried it. And currently, if you look at burps on chain, at least we have the lowest number, lowest fees, and then more assets. I think that is what people care about the most, at least from a burps exchange perspective. And I think that will make them stay. And I think in the future, we'll have reward programs and stuff like that. Opm things are there more or less.
00:23:41.362 - 00:24:20.170, Speaker A: So that will be there, but it's more like, you can't always keep on giving rewards and getting users. So long term, we want to reach the feature parity and build stuff so that people don't feel like they are making a compromise. And the compromise is loaded by op governance. I think it's something like that will happen, but it will take a bit more time. But currently the bigger focus is on integrating pope suite three, which is basically the next version of the synthetics perks. And it has few features which are features which are very, quite interesting. One of them is that you can now use ethos paradise trade, and also there is like native cross margin.
00:24:20.170 - 00:24:42.134, Speaker A: Currently, what there is like a quiet way of doing cross margin, but there is native cross margin, so you can have multiple positions at the same time and they all share the margin. So those kind of things are there. And that would drive more users because it's getting more and more feature parity with the centralized exchanges. That would be good, I guess you.
00:24:42.172 - 00:25:21.474, Speaker B: Mentioned earlier that you've been building features to optimize for whales or just pro users, however you want to classify them. And I had noticed this prior to the interview, just that you've been running. Polynomial has been running these trading competitions which look to target larger traders. And for this week there's 5000 op, so that's 5000 op tokens. And then the competition rules are a trader must complete a minimum of $100,000 in trading volume. I guess, what can you share about that?
00:25:21.592 - 00:25:51.910, Speaker A: So when we started polynomial trade, we started doing some marketing experiments. So what we thought was giving out some NFDs for traders. And then we did some trading competitions and all that kind of stuff. And we realized we clubbed all of them together and made this thing called the trading season. Trading season is a two month long program where a person starts off like level zero and they gain XP every time they trade. And when they trade, they collect NFTs. So we wanted to see who are very loyal and who keep on trading.
00:25:51.910 - 00:26:22.210, Speaker A: And when you reach a certain level, the advantages are two. One is that the amount of op rewards you get, you get a boost on it. So synthetics is running this huge op rewards weekly 300K op. So we give a boost on top of it. Like for example, you got a level four, I think you get 10% boost, level 515, level 620 and level 730 percent. There's a boost on top of the op. So the main thing is the more you train it, the more XP you gain.
00:26:22.210 - 00:26:47.438, Speaker A: And XP is more like made in a way that if you make profits, you get more XP those kind of things are there. And then what we do is we do weekly trading competition. So every level, we make them trade against each other, so that a whale trading is a small trader. It's not a fair thing. People need trade. Who trade? Like, let's say, one hundred K and above. They all are single competition between one hundred K and one.
00:26:47.438 - 00:26:48.074, Speaker A: Gotham.
00:26:48.122 - 00:27:04.350, Speaker E: You're notably, I think, one of the few, if not the only synthetics, perps, front ends that doesn't have a token yet. I'm curious, why no token? And is there any plans to launch a token? And then, I guess, how do you grow without token incentives?
00:27:04.430 - 00:27:30.330, Speaker A: So, currently, we are growing with op incentives. We are borrowing someone else's token. We're not very sure, but we are still on the building phase on. There is a lot more things to be done. We think, like, pops have a much, much bigger way. So I think currently we do few hundred million dollars, and I think few billions and more, many more things are to become.
00:27:30.480 - 00:28:20.542, Speaker B: And let's see, what's really interesting here is we have other models to learn from. Like, we admire the success of GMX, and we had the chance nomadic. And I got to interview Seb from gains or GTrade. We've gotten to talk with Andrew from Quinta. And so there's pros and cons to a token. What I'm excited for is the fact that there's actually lots of peers with similar models to kind of learn from to see. Okay, how might a token be integral to a protocol like this that is focused on building the top defi derivatives on chain? Well, guys, this is a great place for us to start to wrap up.
00:28:20.542 - 00:28:58.790, Speaker B: So I want to remind our listeners that they should first, learn more about polynomial protocol by going to polynomial Phi. Second, they should follow polynomial Phi. We'll show the exact handle there on screen on Twitter. You can follow Gotham on his Twitter account there. It's Gotham with three Z's. Z as in zebra at the very end. And so we've previously covered Quenta, and we're hoping for folks that may have not heard about polynomial that they'll discover that it's just got a killer user experience in terms of Defi perps trading.
00:28:58.790 - 00:29:07.526, Speaker B: But want to allow you then to just share what's the next big milestone or bit of alpha that we can look forward to from polynomial.
00:29:07.638 - 00:29:40.438, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. Thank you for having the time. Do check out about polynomial at polynomial five, or join our discord. We have a great community over there. If you have any questions, just hit it up over there and we'll reply as soon as possible. So what we are focusing on at the moment is an upgrade to the whole system with burps V three from synthetics. So you have like we'll go as many things as possible and we'll be integrating much better ux, for example, like a single click trading, and many, many more things.
00:29:40.524 - 00:29:53.010, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
