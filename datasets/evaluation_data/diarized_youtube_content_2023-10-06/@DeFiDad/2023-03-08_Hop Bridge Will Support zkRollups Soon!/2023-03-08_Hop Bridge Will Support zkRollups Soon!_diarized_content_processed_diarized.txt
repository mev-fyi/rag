00:00:00.170 - 00:00:14.494, Speaker A: Hey everyone, I'm Defi dad. I'm here at East Denver at the ZK sync booth, joined here by Chris Winfrey, who is the co founder of Hop Protocol. Chris, I just wanted to ask you, how are zk roll ups impacting the development of future hop products?
00:00:14.612 - 00:00:35.186, Speaker B: So roll ups are what we do right now. We support two optimistic roll ups, but we don't support any ZK roll ups. Zk roll ups are for sure the future of Ethereum. We can at those instantly. We can just do so much more with them in terms of cross chain validation. And so we're excited to finally get our hands on this. We're excited about the upcoming mainnet release.
00:00:35.186 - 00:00:42.226, Speaker B: And yeah, we're just excited about this entire ecosystem that's blossoming with Ethereum rollups.
00:00:42.418 - 00:00:48.410, Speaker A: Chris, as Defi users, what else should we be on the lookout for in terms of hop products?
00:00:48.560 - 00:01:09.506, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now we're working on the B two of hop. So we've taken kind of this b one design. We had this asset bridge. We wanted to get that in the market. That was kind of the hair on fire need for the Ethereum community. And now we're modularizing the stack. So we're ripping out kind of this middle message layer and we're opening it up not just for the hop bridge to use, but for anyone to use.
00:01:09.506 - 00:01:54.122, Speaker B: And so now all of the different active bridges will all share the same messaging layer. Anyone else can build on the same messaging layer. The more people that use this messaging layer, the cheaper it gets. And it's 100% trustless. And so the way that we see hop now is kind of this asset fridge. We're very user facing and we're transitioning to this more developer facing modular stack for building cross chain applications where you can send data between chains, you can send tokens between chains, you can send NFTs between chains. And we think that the things that people are going to build with this, like cross chain, Dexes, crosschain lending, it's going to go beyond what we can even think of because people in the space are just so smart, they're so creative, and just really excited to see people start building with this deck.
00:01:54.266 - 00:01:57.498, Speaker A: Just one more question. What's your favorite part of East Denver?
00:01:57.674 - 00:02:27.650, Speaker B: I mean, it's just so fun to see the whole Ethereum community in the same space. We've been coming to this for years and years, and when it first started, it was kind of this small community. It was very intimate. Now we're what, 20,000 people here or something? I've heard crazy estimates. That's more than apple pulls into their conferences, big tech conferences. And it's just like, crazy to see how big the Ethereum community has gotten, how many people are here, and it doesn't feel like a bear market. It's really exciting.
