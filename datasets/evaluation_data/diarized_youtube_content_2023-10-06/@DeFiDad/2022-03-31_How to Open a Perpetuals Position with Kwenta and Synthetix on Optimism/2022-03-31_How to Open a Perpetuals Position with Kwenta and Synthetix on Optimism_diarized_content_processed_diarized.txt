00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.022, Speaker A: There are things that you can do on optimism that you just cannot do on l one. Right. And a while ago, we realized that perpetual futures is one of those things. Same thing with Lyra and options within the synthetics ecosystem. We're really pushing kind of, I guess, the state of the art in terms of what you can compute on chain. But obviously, the additional computational bandwidth that you have on optimism makes some stuff viable that just isn't viable on l one. It's not even an issue of cost.
00:00:30.022 - 00:00:43.740, Speaker A: You can't actually do it. It's super exciting to have optimism now. Be, like, production ready and have pro futures released. And as you can see on the screen, go and start trading now.
00:00:44.350 - 00:01:27.794, Speaker B: Yeah. So just quick reminder to everyone, what we're looking at here is on optimism. So if you have an ethereum wallet like metamask, you can go to V two, beta, Quinta IO, and if you flip the little switch up here, it'll then prompt you to switch your metamask network. And then from there, there are, what, guys, there's three markets that are open now with up to ten x leverage. So I could go into the e per market here, and let's say this is actually part of. Before the call, Kane sent over 100 SUSD just so we could play with this. And we were both kind of, like, marveling, of course, at the fact that it shows up within a few seconds.
00:01:27.794 - 00:01:36.780, Speaker B: So if I were going to open up a position here, and, guys, stop me if I'm missing anything. I mean, depends, of course, if I want to go long or short.
00:01:37.230 - 00:01:42.502, Speaker A: I think we want a yolo long e here, right? Like, no one.
00:01:42.576 - 00:01:43.198, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:01:43.364 - 00:01:46.158, Speaker A: What's happening here, right? Yeah. Cool.
00:01:46.324 - 00:01:59.042, Speaker B: Awesome. So here we go. So we'll open a position. The one thing you won't see is my metamask just opened, and I am going to click confirm now. There we go. And there it is. My transactions through.
00:01:59.042 - 00:02:20.854, Speaker B: So I've opened my position anywhere here that I should. Oh, there we go. Now, we can see it here. So here's my position here. And I can track that and what, eventually choose to close it or not. Anything else here, guys, you want to call out or anything I can click on as we're sort of just walking through an example, I think.
00:02:20.892 - 00:02:22.626, Speaker C: Just excited about the future. This is the beta.
00:02:22.658 - 00:02:23.046, Speaker B: We've just.
00:02:23.068 - 00:02:41.978, Speaker C: Just launched this. It's been out for about two weeks now. So it's got its little quirks and stuff. And we were only at three markets, but, yeah, we've already started an sip to expand the markets. And really ramp up. So I think we're excited to kind of start to put more pressure on this and eventually have a competition to really kick it into the next stage. So keep an eye out for that, and we'll have some Quinta rewards once we do launch a token.
00:02:41.978 - 00:02:50.890, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's a lot to take it, but it's exciting to see it finally live. And, yeah, opening up ten X positions with synthetics is pretty big step forward, so, yeah, this is exciting.
