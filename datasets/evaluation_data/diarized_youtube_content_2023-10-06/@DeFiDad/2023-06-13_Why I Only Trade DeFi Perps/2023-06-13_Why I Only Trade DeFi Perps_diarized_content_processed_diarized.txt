You can't have people behind the scenes making their own rules. We're all playing by the exact same rules. If you want to participate in the market, you're stuck with those rules, and then you either use it or you don't. But that's a massive advantage for people who were spooked by FTX because I think, yeah, just having that, like, fairness, that, like, consistency where people can't, you know, abuse the liquidity, I think is just a massive advantage that isn't really tapped into yet.
