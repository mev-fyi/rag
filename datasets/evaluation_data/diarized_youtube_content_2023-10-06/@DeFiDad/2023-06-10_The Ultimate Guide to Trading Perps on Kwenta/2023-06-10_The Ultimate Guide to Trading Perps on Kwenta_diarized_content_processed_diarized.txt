00:00:00.490 - 00:00:33.560, Speaker A: One of the things we talked about right after the FTX collapse was that DeFi really has this interesting ability to set the rules of the game that you want to play. You can't have people behind the scenes making their own rules. We're all playing by the exact same rules. If you want to participate in the market, you're stuck with those rules, and then you either use it or you don't. But that's a massive advantage for people who were spooked by FTX because I think, yeah, just having that fairness, that consistency where people can't abuse the liquidity, I think is just a massive advantage that isn't really tapped into yet.

00:04:37.990 - 00:04:55.642, Speaker C: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce one of the core contributors of Quenta. His name is Andrew. As of this recording on May 18, 2023, Quinta is doing about 200 million in daily trade volume, with its record trading day being 488,000,000 on March 17, just two months ago.
00:04:55.776 - 00:04:58.214, Speaker B: Quinta offers up to 50 x leverage.
00:04:58.342 - 00:05:29.398, Speaker C: And currently 33 trading pairs, including the most popular cryptos like ETH, USD and Bitcoin, as well as forex pairs like the euro and the british pound, and then, of course, commodities like gold and silver. So today we're going to do our best to provide details on how traders are getting paid in Op and Quenta, as well as some detail about the funding rate, which can be used to open up a delta neutral position in certain instances. So let's kick it off. Andrew, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:05:29.484 - 00:05:31.350, Speaker A: I'm doing great, man. Thanks for having me.
00:05:31.420 - 00:05:55.998, Speaker C: Andrew why don't we do the usual here and give a little bit of background about who you are. How did you get into crypto in the first place? I'd also to like to highlight just how long you've been working on the. I think it's one of the things that really stands out for me. This isn't an overnight success. You've really been working on synthetics and Quinta for quite a long time.
00:05:56.164 - 00:06:44.046, Speaker A: So I've been in probably the DeFi space for four or five years now. Right when sort of defi was getting turned into a term originally, kind of like in a project that was doing recurring payments in cryptocurrency. Later I was in a project doing aggregation and also kind of just working, like, with various projects to do kind of like product marketing, which is more about finding fit in the industry, and how we can kind of build out a path forward from there and then through all that. At the end of that kind of journey, about maybe two to three years ago, I started working with synthetics. And that was right before it was cool, like right before it was cool. And I definitely learned a lot about kind of the defi dynamics at that point, and really bought into dows as a potential way to coordinate. And that was the most exciting thing for me at the time.
00:06:44.046 - 00:07:37.326, Speaker A: And I got thrown at basically how to build out the exchange side of synthetics, which is how to actually trade the assets that synthetics was supporting, and that was synthetics exchange at the time. And then we went on a journey of figuring out how know allow it to stand up as something that can attract to a broader audience, differentiate from the underlying synthetics protocol, which is more of like, a way for people to develop with liquidity, less so, like its own product. So we rebranded synthetics exchange into Quinta, and eventually it made sense to split it out into a completely independent protocol. So we didn't have this flag in the ground, said, Quinta is the only people that can build here. We wanted to open it up to everyone, and I think that's worked. You can see awesome projects like polynomial and decentrics have started building on it, but Quinta is still sort of leading the charge there. And now it's completely independent, has its own token, it even has its own other products that it's starting to experiment with.
00:07:37.326 - 00:07:57.060, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's become its completely siloed thing that works really closely with synthetics, but is independent at this point. It had been there from the start, sort of working with the synthetics dow to split it out but it itself was actually voted into existence by the council. So it's sort of like founded by synthetics, which is really interesting. It's kind of like one of the few projects I've ever heard do.
00:07:57.510 - 00:09:35.250, Speaker C: Yeah, I might be able to dig up some old video from tutorials of what synthetics exchange looked like, but, man, I just want to give perspective that back in 2019 2020, it was a point of pride for many of us who were into synthetics, just that we were providing liquidity through SNX staking, and the trading volume was just pathetic at the time. But it was exciting because it was such an early example of where we were headed that a decentralized leverage exchange could eventually compete with the likes of the centralized exchanges. But I have to say, somewhere along that journey, even I was like, is this ever really going to, like, this is such a brutal user experience. Again, this goes back before Quinta was quinta, and it's just insane, like, how far we've come, because now I can trade full time on Quinta. And I would argue that the trading experience, as long as you know how to set up a wallet, like frame or metamask or whatever wallet you use, you got to use like a browser extension, like frame or metamask. It is on par with the likes of bybit and Binance. So anyways, I will try to share some screenshots there, because I think it's really important to understand how far we've actually come in this journey.
00:09:35.590 - 00:10:02.554, Speaker F: Yeah, I love that little kind of history lesson on synthetics. That was a great story. Andrew at four C. I think everybody on the team except for me is like a synthetics OG. So some of that was quite new to me. So appreciate the background. So I guess for those also new to Quinta, can you briefly describe kind of what the trading platform is and what does, I guess, decentralized leverage perps.
00:10:02.602 - 00:10:37.986, Speaker A: Mean to someone just getting started? Sure. So Quinta is a decentralized derivatives trading platform. So it's operated by a DAO. Quinta's deployments are all done through a decentralized manner. Everything's basically housed in decentralized infrastructure, sometimes to our demise. And then, yeah, this platform is really designed to facilitate the trading of derivatives in defi. So, meaning that perpetual futures options and any other kind of interesting assets that you're interesting mechanisms for trading that you think are in demand will probably make their way onto Quanta.
00:10:37.986 - 00:11:09.998, Speaker A: And right now, that's perps. Perps is one of the most popular ways to trade, and perps is basically a way to get leverage or to have like a multiplier for the impact of price movement on your trade. And on Quenza, you can go up to 50 x right now on, I think, ETH and other markets which enables you to have 50 x the action up and down. And that's enabled traders to sort of use smaller amounts of capital to have larger upside or downside. But that's the theory behind perks and it worked quite well for a lot of traders.
00:11:10.174 - 00:12:07.510, Speaker C: Yeah, and I want to highlight that for those that have traded on centralized exchanges, that leverage on a decentralized leverage trading platform. It's really important here because think of FTX, think of how much money was deposited there in order for folks to trade. And at the end of the day, obviously, leverage can be a tool to protect yourself from that counterparty risk depositing into, in the case of a centralized exchange, to protect yourself from the likes of someone like an FTX. In this case, though, that leverage, I think is really important because there is still real risk in using, know, the usual sort of stuff in DeFi, like a smart contract exploit. So we still have to be mindful of risks here. It's definitely not risk free, but leverage is just so important to allowing us to be able to size up those positions.
00:12:07.930 - 00:12:50.882, Speaker A: One of the things we talked about right after the FTX collapse was that DeFi really has this interesting ability to set the rules of the game that you want to play and that can't be tampered with. So I think that's one of the most interesting things that's coming to Defi, is that you can't have people behind the scenes making their own rules. We're all playing by the exact same rules. If you want to participate in the market, you're stuck with those rules and you either use it or you don't. But that's a massive advantage for people who were spooked by FTX because it's a totally different game. You can't get that kind of activity going on in DeFi because the smart contracts sort of fix exactly how the liquidity can be used. No one can tamper with it.
00:12:50.882 - 00:13:03.750, Speaker A: So even if there's definitely differences between CeX and DeFi, I think just having that fairness, that consistency where people can't abuse the liquidity, I think is just a massive advantage that isn't really tapped into yet.
00:13:03.820 - 00:13:29.134, Speaker C: Do you think you could try to summarize some of the major differences between Quinta and I'll just highlight GMX and gtrade because I think those are two of the more popular decentralized leveraged trading platforms on arbitrum, Quinta is on optimism. So I guess that's one difference. But anything else major that you might call out between some of these platforms, for sure.
00:13:29.172 - 00:14:21.626, Speaker A: So the largest difference between us, Quinta and GNS, or GMX, is really that we're, like, working together with synthetix, and synthetics is kind of the underlying protocol that manages the liquidity and offers us perps directly. And in the future, synthetics is planning on evolving into a more versatile platform for really hosting derivatives, liquidity. And that's what synthetix V three is. That partnership that we've had with them enables us to really focus on making the best UX UI ever, and then they could focus on offering the best mechanisms for liquidity. And since we both sort of specialized in those two verticals, I think we ended up with the best of both worlds. We have one of the most competitive mechanisms in DeFi for purpose trading, while also having a really, I think, performant front end that can rival even some of the top centralized exchanges in terms of usability. And that's really one of the biggest advantages.
00:14:21.626 - 00:15:17.186, Speaker A: That partnership enabled us to just have a lot of smart people focused on solving hard problems and gave Quinta a platform to start expanding. So now we have advanced orders, which is something synthetics doesn't offer in margin, and other features that I think we can keep on building out and making robust. So that partnership, that really collaborative nature, it's like the manifestation of that old story about defi acting like Legos, where you can kind of piece them together. Quinta is literally that, like, you've stuck the graph and synthetics and whatever chainlink onto Pyth and all these groups together. And even Lyra, an options trading platform, is something that provides options on Quinta now. So it's really just this combination of all the network effects of us working with a lot of smart people who are specializing on different things, and we've connected that all together. And that's really why I think Quinta has just become something that can compete with the best of them.
00:15:17.288 - 00:15:31.858, Speaker F: So you touched on kind of that relationship between synthetix and Quinta, and just kind of where that liquidity comes from. Can you maybe dive into a little bit more the smart margin account and what that refers to and how that works on Quinta?
00:15:31.954 - 00:16:17.298, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So the smart margin is interesting because it's kind of a way where you can host money in an audited smart contract that will then enable you to instruct that funds on how it wants to interact with a given protocol. So we see it actually being something that can expand to interacting directly with Lyra and options and synthetics and perps and swaps on uniswap or whatever. It'd be sort of this wallet that you can do to interact with that. It's in its sort of first version right now. So I think that does have some limited features, but we've enabled it to have advanced orders which will create stop losses and limit orders for people who want to open up per positions, but have more structure in their trades and even protection with stop losses. So you're avoiding getting liquidated.
00:16:17.298 - 00:16:54.494, Speaker A: And, yeah, it's really just a kind of layer on top of these other underlying protocols that offer derivatives that we can help to facilitate a little bit of that interaction and additional functionality. So it's a very flexible way for us to inform how to instruct those funds to behave. And then in the future, there's even a feature we're working on called delegated trading, which will enable you to have programmability with those funds. So you could instruct the script on how to handle those funds. People could copy trade those scripts and you could have kind of profit sharing, et cetera, built into these smart margins. So it's actually like a really flexible system. Yeah.
00:16:54.494 - 00:17:03.234, Speaker A: Very impressed with the solidity. Engineers came up with that because it seems like something that's been needed for a long time. I'm surprised it hasn't existed. So it seems like a good fit for where we live in the whole space.
00:17:03.352 - 00:17:21.462, Speaker C: Andrew, given that, you know, filling these buy and sell orders by drawing upon liquidity from synthetics, which at the end of the day, I believe is only on optimism. Now, you have to correct me. Is there still liquidity for synthetics on main net?
00:17:21.596 - 00:17:41.018, Speaker A: Yeah, so there is l one liquidity. It's just that perps are on L two. So we really source all of our liquidity to optimism, and it is a better experience. It's like, still very fast, still very competitive. So, yeah, we mainly operate on top of optimism. Yeah, I haven't used l one too much, so, yeah, it's primarily optimism.
00:17:41.114 - 00:17:46.658, Speaker C: No, me neither. Me neither. I prefer Quenton optimism as well.
00:17:46.824 - 00:18:03.286, Speaker A: There's definitely an intention to move to broader chains. We're definitely aware that there's demand and just kind of like a user flow from other chains, like arbitrum and stuff that we're excited about and we're not ignoring by any means, but there's a bit of a pathway to get there that we're slowly working towards.
00:18:03.388 - 00:18:26.654, Speaker C: Is there any guarantee or risk when filling that order? I know that I've had a few of my trades, it fails for whatever reason. Can you kind of dumb that down? What happens under the hood? How much of a guarantee do I have to actually executing my order at the price that I set it at?
00:18:26.772 - 00:19:16.414, Speaker A: Yeah, the majority of times your prices, like your execution is going to be fine, but the reality is there's a lot of decentralized infrastructure under the hood, and we don't have 100% execution rate because of just the infrastructure we're using. So a keeper won't trigger or something like that. And we have it to the point where we've made sure that there's mechanisms in place to ensure that everything's going to go through, and even some recent improvements on synthetic side. Again, a lot of smart people paying attention to these problems. So you have constant improvements happening. But yeah, long story short, there was kind of like a hard cap on using the keeper recently. I'm not sure how deep you want to get into this, but basically we found that decentralized infrastructure can definitely be a little bit inconsistent, and we're working hard to kind of resolve that and even considering what we can use from the real world to sort of add additional reliability to the platform.
00:19:16.414 - 00:19:31.410, Speaker A: So it's one of the things we want to focus on is really just like offering basically 100% execution rate in similar metrics. But it's not something I can guarantee you today by any means. It's decentralized finance. There's definitely some early day stuff happening, so be sure.
00:19:31.480 - 00:19:44.694, Speaker C: If your order doesn't fill, you can just go ahead and Dm a n d o t l a s on twitter. He's available 24 7365. Yeah, to all customer support requests, go to him.

00:21:20.090 - 00:21:21.046, Speaker A: Yeah, no, just kind of.
00:21:21.068 - 00:22:20.040, Speaker F: Like listening to that response like, yeah, it is early days for these platforms, but it's crazy at just how much, and you alluded to this earlier, just how much more functionality transparency there already is, and extrapolating where it's going, it's only going to get better. There's instantaneous, basically proof of reserve attestations that you can look at, whereas a lot of these bigger, maybe less transparent, centralized exchanges do it every once in a while or every quarter or something. It's just amazing to see how much the space has grown and what I think it's going to continue to do with obviously being released on L two s. It's awesome to see, but just getting back into Quenta, if you can kind of tell us a little bit about how stop losses work, take profit orders, are there any limitations to how tight they can be given some of the constraints of the optimism? L two?
00:22:20.590 - 00:23:18.774, Speaker A: So first of all, there's a big upgrade coming to optimism, called optimism bedrock, which should actually make just coins in general, a little bit more performant, reduce execution fees a little bit from the synthetic side as a byproduct or sort of symptom of their upgrade, and I think that's happening within the next two weeks. It's been coming for a long time, so that's one key piece that I think should be watching for. So today's state might change basically, is what I'm trying to get at. But yeah, stop losses are basically just orders you can set up so that if the price hits a certain level that you want it to execute at before liquidation of your perpetual futures position, it'll go ahead and trigger that price for you. So you don't need to be up all night watching price action just in case. And yeah, you sort of COVID that position, close out, and then you're back in your margin where it's safe. And yeah, your only risk there is basically something not executing, which, again, most of the time you're going to be fine, but it's still decentralized infrastructure, so I can't guarantee anyone, like perfect execution.
00:23:18.774 - 00:23:19.580, Speaker A: Right now.
00:23:19.950 - 00:24:04.858, Speaker C: I want to talk through a few strategies with you, and we need to get a few questions answered. Because number one, above all else, we can use Quinta to long or short the different trading pairs. But aside from that, there's this mechanism called the funding rate. It's a very familiar mechanism that is in all the other perps markets. Can you just first try to dumb that down for us? What is the funding rate? What's the significance of it being positive or negative? And I don't know if you could potentially touch on how it might differ from some of the funding rate design for other perps markets. There's something there I thought that was a little more unique about how Quinta does it.
00:24:04.944 - 00:24:51.258, Speaker A: Yeah. So the main difference between our funding rate and other funding rates is that we're basically trying to fix a skew. So we are trying to create an even market for shorts and longs with collateral set up by synthetics. So there's this big pool of liquidity. People are taking different positions. So the tighter that a spread can be, that SKU can be, it's essentially delta neutral for the underlying liquidity providing those trades. And with our mechanism, yeah, it's definitely taken a bit of iteration, but it's offered very tight spreads, meaning that on larger, more traded markets, you're getting pretty fair funding rate charges for like, as you.
00:24:51.258 - 00:25:27.266, Speaker A: As you hold your position. And just to clarify, basically, a funding rate is something that basically continually is charged to the position as you have it open and essentially acts as an ongoing fee so you can retain the position and keep it open, and that sort of pays out the liquidity below it to make sure that it's all even, et cetera. And yeah, you can hold that position open. One other key difference is, I think a lot of funding rates have points. I think every certain amount of time it'll execute. Like, that's when you're charged, whereas synthetix's system is ongoing. So it's like a stream.
00:25:27.266 - 00:25:33.894, Speaker A: You're constantly getting charged, which is a little bit more like even creating stronger efficiency within the market.
00:25:34.092 - 00:25:43.162, Speaker F: Andrew, is there a place on the Quinta platform where users can go and look up historical funding rates just to get an idea of how they fluctuate and change over time.
00:25:43.296 - 00:26:05.898, Speaker A: Not yet, but what we've done is basically prepared a piece of the VUI, which is going to be going out next week. Worst case scenario, two weeks. But, yeah, it's ready. It's probably one of the most demanded features is having an ability to go check the funding rate history for a given market. So, yeah, very excited for that. I saw some screenshots of it, and hopefully we can leak some with you guys. But it's looking good.
00:26:05.898 - 00:26:08.818, Speaker A: I think people will be very happy with it. So, yeah, excited for that.
00:26:08.904 - 00:26:49.322, Speaker C: Defi llama has this long, short strats tab. It's under the yields tab, and I actually tend to use that to look up. So you do have to search by token. So let's just say I'm interested in the ETH funding rate. It's there on Quinta. But again, you got to do a little bit of math just to annualize that or to think about. So my point is, if you were looking to open a delta neutral position and get paid by the funding rate, let's assume the funding rate is positive, so that longs are ultimately paying shorts.
00:26:49.322 - 00:27:03.362, Speaker C: And in that instance, I could potentially then open up a short position on, let's say, the quinta ETH pair. I'm going to go spot long outside of that, just in order for it to be a delta neutral position.
00:27:03.496 - 00:27:27.274, Speaker A: The reality is, we have a subgraph. All this information is out there. It's definitely attainable, and we even have an SDK where you can start to interact more directly with Quinta and open trades, et cetera. But I think the funding rate page coming is probably going to be your easiest way to sort of analyze the different rates. But for now, yeah, it's still relatively new, so I don't think there's a super convenient tool to go and analyze that data unless there's one that I don't know about.
00:27:27.472 - 00:27:55.934, Speaker C: So let's talk about the most important source for yield. There is a synthetics op rewards program that was launched in April. Could you just give some of the key details around that, like, how long does it last? So when would it potentially end? And what are some of the weekly rewards that are being distributed through synthetics, as well as what Quinta is putting up for traders as a reward?
00:27:56.062 - 00:28:33.678, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a 20 week program going on right now, and I think we're into week three, if I'm not wrong, of these rewards, where basically, if you're trading perps, the fees that you accumulate during a given week are added to a sort of like pool, and the proportion of fees that you contributed to this pool gets distributed op rewards. But in addition to that, Quinza also has its own op rewards. So I believe synthetics has around 300,000 that they dedicated to this program. And Quinza, I believe, has 90,000 or something. I have to double check on top of that. So we actually have additional rewards for people who are trading specifically on Quintet.
00:28:33.774 - 00:28:56.786, Speaker C: I'm looking actually at a chart that was kindly provided in a mirror post, 300,000 op rewards, as Andrew noted. And then there's an additional, I think it's 30,000 op that's being currently put up by Quinta. And then there's also quinta rewards as well. Totally separate token. The quinta token.
00:28:56.978 - 00:29:25.070, Speaker A: And Quinta has like a permanent rewards program where if you're trading and staking, you basically get access to Quinta token rewards through each week. And then basically the amount of fees that you've accumulated on quinta dictates what proportion of those rewards you're going to get. And it's a permanent program. It's built into the inflation mechanism, so that's always going to be there. And it's a great way for people who are actually using the platform to become a part of the ecosystem, the DAO, and capture some of the components.
00:29:25.430 - 00:29:46.886, Speaker C: Andrew, I noticed on the Quinta Grants Council, which is a Twitter account, there was a reference to something called an aggregation terminal. It looks like we're comparing opening positions on something like Quinta versus something like GMX. Any other detail you can provide about that?
00:29:47.068 - 00:30:32.898, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's community initiative to analyze the difference between the synthetics perps program on Quinta, as well as what GMX is offering. And this compares basically like what opening a position on a given market would look like and in its infancy. I think it's very focused on just like the Ethereum market compared to GMX and synthetics. So this will kind of enable people to analyze what's the difference between the two protocols. And yeah, we're hoping to see that we're consistently beating other protocols right now, just focused on GMX. And even if it's really just data at this point, for us to understand what the differences are and when it's favorable to open a position on a given platform. But yeah, that's the idea is really to inform traders, like what the opportunity is on each given protocol.
00:30:33.074 - 00:30:47.638, Speaker F: Hey, Andrew, one thing I was thinking of is how does the quinta token work within the Quinta exchange, and what utility does it provide? Why should someone hold the quanta token if they like using the exchange?
00:30:47.814 - 00:31:01.498, Speaker A: Right. So there's two core functions of the Quinta token. One is your dow participation. So governance. So being able to vote and decision making. Quinta is currently council centric. So you're basically voting about twice a year on these epochs where you vote in a council.
00:31:01.498 - 00:31:37.242, Speaker A: So you're voting for one candidate. And then the second function is rewards mechanism. So making sure that the value capture that's happening within the Dao does come back to the token holders, and that's currently just inflationary rewards. So ensuring that anytime Quinta's trading awards, et cetera, are going through the system, like, it's going back to people who are staking. And there's some incentives even for people who aren't staking just to kind of get them into the dow. But what happens is when you stake, you are eligible for a tier of rewards that's more material and you're able to capture that, and that's in the form of quinta. So, yeah, it's really a bit of both.
00:31:37.242 - 00:31:55.698, Speaker A: And then the infrastructure is well set up for us to capture any kind of vow grow that happens in the future. So it's really just kind of like sitting there as like an opportunity for future votes to go through, et cetera, all the governance process that needs to happen for these decisions to be made. But it's in a good place for additional development on top of it right now. So, yeah.
00:31:55.784 - 00:32:09.126, Speaker C: Is a staking apy only based on inflation of the token, or is there currently, when you stake, is there any sort of buyback, burn, whatever sort of thing going on there?
00:32:09.228 - 00:32:52.682, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's no value capture happening right now with the token, but I think all the infrastructure is there. I think the community really wants value capture. And we're starting to experiment with native perps, additional functionality, which will give the opportunity for the dow to decide whether it wants to add in value accrual for stakers. And then there's additional mechanisms in place that are a little more complicated, like the fee for vesting early. So any inflationary rewards and any rewards you get in general for trading, et cetera, on Quenta are locked for one year. However, there's a 90% penalty if you vest day one, and that means that you can get 10% of those rewards immediately. But if you wait the full year, you'll get 100% of those rewards, and those can even be staked so it can build on top of your staking stack.
00:32:52.682 - 00:33:20.394, Speaker A: It's very flexible. People can exit at any time. And anytime that that penalty is exercised, it goes back to the treasury and kind of like, can be used for future use. However, a community member recently proposed that half of that is going to go back to stakers and half of that is going to go into treasury. So even knowing it's not implemented yet, that's actually already being tracked, and it's going to be implemented. So there's going to be additional upside, variable upside, for people who vested early and stakers to get that kind of reward as well.
00:33:20.432 - 00:33:39.570, Speaker C: Yeah, it seems to mirror a part of what I loved about the SNX staking, that we're vesting those rewards over a year, but it's not like it's just locked up vesting. If you're willing to continue to stake that or stake more of it, you can earn that much more yield.
00:33:39.990 - 00:33:46.382, Speaker F: Andrew, do you have any other alpha you'd be able to share our listeners on? Anything coming up for Quinta?
00:33:46.526 - 00:34:31.918, Speaker A: Yeah, so I have a lot of alpha. The next stages for Quinta are kind of like a big step forward. We've been sort of like a front end on top of synthetics, but we're looking to really become something that can compete with centralized exchange on a broader strategy. So synthetics will always be like an integral part of Quinta, just to be completely clear. But we've also started to experiment with additional functionality as well as even native offerings. So in the next epoch or the next six months, we're going to be looking to advance our own experimentation with perps, as well as additional functionality built on top of perps. So being able to have programmable trading that you can interact with, as well as copy trading.
00:34:31.918 - 00:35:13.706, Speaker A: And that's all coming within about the next six months. We have kind of a new Dow model that I've been experimenting with as well. I think I have enough information now based on what's been working for uni, what's been working for synthetics, to kind of come up with more of like, a hybrid model that can work really well. So there's, I think, some progress just in terms of what a Dow is, and that's the stuff that I'm really passionate about. So that I'm excited as well, to start designing and implementing with the Quinta team. And, yeah, I think, in general, we're about to have an election where next council for Quinta is going to come in. This is five people voted in by the community who are staking Quinta to actually vote on proposals that are going through the Dow.
00:35:13.706 - 00:35:39.082, Speaker A: And this will be a kind of opportunity for us to update what is coming up in the roadmap, when that's going to happen, as well as any other key updates like in terms of progress and stuff that's happening. So you can expect in the next week or two a sort of update on how Quinta has been performing, where we're going next, and any other context you want to know about Quinta. So keep your eye out for that as well as kind of open positions and other opportunities to join the DAO. So quite a bit happening in the next two weeks.
00:35:39.216 - 00:36:41.890, Speaker C: All right, well, I think this is probably a good place for us to wrap. I want to remind listeners then that they should check out Quenta at Quinta ETH Li M o that's the website that I normally use. There's a few different websites, actually, but that's the one I use because it uses decentralized infrastructure. And then also remind folks to follow Quenta on Twitter, which is Quinta underscore IO. There are going to be lots of perps protocols that are going to launch in this next crypto bull cycle. Whenever that hits, please be careful, because just because a protocol launches or claims to want to build the next great perps protocol doesn't mean they're going to succeed at it. And one of the things that I look to is teams that have been in the space a long time and continue to build, and there's really, like no team that's been in the space, especially the DeFi space, any longer than someone like synthetics.
00:36:41.890 - 00:37:02.826, Speaker C: And this is a team that originally derives from the synthetics. Team was incubated in Synthetix and thankfully has spun out now to work full time on perps. So I would keep your eye on this. And if you're looking to, again learn about one of the leading Defi perps markets, this is it. Check out Quinta.
00:37:03.018 - 00:37:15.410, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're talented builder like Andrew, please consider reaching out to our team at fourthrevolution capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
