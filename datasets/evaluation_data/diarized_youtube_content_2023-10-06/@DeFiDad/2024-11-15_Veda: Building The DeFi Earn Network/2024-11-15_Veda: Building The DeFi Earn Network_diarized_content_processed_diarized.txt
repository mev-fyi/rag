00:00:00.240 - 00:00:46.325, Speaker A: The first part of our strategy is just getting more distribution for our vaults, right? So like we're continuing to launch products with EtherFi. For the first three weeks of launching the first Etherfi liquid vault, we grew to 400 million in TVL. We also recently launched with Lombard, which if people don't know is a Bitcoin liquid staking token built on top of Babylon. But we launched a vault with them a couple months ago. Today it's sitting at around 150, a little over 150 million in TVL. So so kind of phase one of like the Veda growth plan is really working with different ecosystems and asset issuers to get these products into their users hands, right? Like we go where the TVL is, we go where the distribution is and we're really just trying to build this universe of assets that are built on the Veda infrastructure.

00:03:26.829 - 00:03:32.221, Speaker C: Founder and CEO of Veda Labs. Sun. Welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:03:32.333 - 00:03:34.477, Speaker A: Doing great. Thanks for having me. Big fan of you guys.
00:03:34.581 - 00:04:19.701, Speaker C: Thanks so much. Likewise here and full disclosure too. I'm an investor in Veda. So very excited to have you on board with us today. To talk about what I would summarize as the Defi Earn network, we're going to talk about how Veda is a key piece of infrastructure for making earning yield simple, transparent and secure. So Veda is a type of like vault infrastructure and we're going to break down exactly how that works, but more importantly, the possibilities that it opens for defi protocols or even exchanges to take yield and make it as easy as simply holding a token. That said, sun, why don't we start with a little bit more about your background? This isn't your first rodeo.
00:04:19.701 - 00:04:27.893, Speaker C: You've been building this space for many years. Tell us about what you were working on previously and how that led here to Veda.
00:04:27.989 - 00:04:47.939, Speaker A: Sure. So I joined the space about three years ago. Before that I was actually about to spend my time as an academic. I was about to start my PhD in machine learning. Zero background in crypto. I wasn't one of those people who, you know, I unfortunately didn't get in super early. Didn't like subscribe to bitcoin thesis or anything like that.
00:04:47.939 - 00:05:29.191, Speaker A: But it was like late 2021, obviously like crazy bull market and Defi was really popping off and a close friend of mine from college entered the space and I was already having like second thoughts about going straight to my PhD. I wanted to explore entrepreneurship and like work in industry. And I thought crypto was just like rapidly growing space. So I hopped in, obviously like that, that growth kind of, you know, stopped. And we had some of the most brutal years, I think, in crypto's existence. But I definitely was like ideologically bought in through that period. I think there's a lot of value in like building through bear markets so since I joined, I've been spending.
00:05:29.191 - 00:05:56.863, Speaker A: I basically spent all my time building vaults in DeFi. So vault is this like overloaded term. What does a vault mean? A vault is basically a smart contract that abstracts away some complex DEFI actions for a user. So user can deposit their assets into this contract and it's doing a variety of things on that user's behalf. So our team started out in a protocol called Somalia Finance. Some people might be familiar with that. We built like the core smart contract infrastructure.
00:05:56.863 - 00:06:33.787, Speaker A: We built all the DEFI strategies there and over the course of like two and a half years, scaled from zero to like roughly a hundred million in tbl. A lot of stuff, you know, we learned a lot of stuff on the way. And Veda is, represents kind of the evolution of vaults and of DeFi. In my opinion, it's kind of the culmination of our team's background building vaults over the course of years, working with a lot of top protocols and a lot of users to understand what their UX needs are. So yeah, Veda, you know, we launched in March, but it really has been like the work of our core team working together for the past three years or so.
00:06:33.891 - 00:06:39.779, Speaker D: Son, why don't we just start off with you telling us what Veda is and I guess maybe the mission behind Veda.
00:06:39.867 - 00:07:04.329, Speaker A: Sure. So Veda is the DeFi EARN Network. What that means is our mission is to make EARN DEFI simple, transparent and secure. There's this like deep technical challenge for how you actually do that. And so what we do is we partner with protocols and ecosystems to build EARN products effectively one click access into those ecosystems, but we also build the infrastructure that makes those products possible.
00:07:04.417 - 00:07:31.099, Speaker D: Sun, maybe let's just start with vaults. I'd love to get kind of your take on why they're so crucial for DeFi. We're seeing, I'd say like a big resurgence with vaults and vault products from DEFI teams. We had Tokamak on recently. We talked to Summerfi. They've got a vault product coming to market. It just seems like everybody's sort of starting to converge once again on this concept of vaults.
00:07:31.099 - 00:07:41.459, Speaker D: But yeah, what's your take on why they're so important and I guess how ultimately they scale both to newcomers and to defi crypto natives.
00:07:41.587 - 00:08:10.579, Speaker A: Well, maybe I'll start by saying like, I hate the term vault. It's like the industry standard and it's what it's like embedded into the language that at least people in the know use, but it is like a really bad term. For communicating what it actually does. Like, it's such a generic term. Vault can mean like a million different things. But I think distilling into this concept of curation is the right perspective. And that's actually the broader trend that we're seeing in the market today, which is that DEFI will be curated.
00:08:10.579 - 00:09:16.025, Speaker A: Like years ago, there's this view that, you know, we can like build these crazy exotic base layer primitives like Dexs and like over collateralized lending market CDPs. And maybe there was this like naive optimism that normal people would one day figure out how to use these products. But the reality that I think the industry has learned so far over the last couple of years is that there's just some complexity, like there's some irreducible complexity in the base layer protocols. And to build products that are actually consumable by like normal people, you need to abstract away this complexity, right? So there's like layers between DEFI as the core infrastructure and products that people use. And so you know what I consider vaults are that middleware infrastructure that allows that kind of intermediation to build consumable and usable products on top of DEFI infrastructure. But the like hard challenge is how do you do that in a way where you don't give up the benefits of defi, right? Where you still want these things to be transparent. You, you want to avoid rug risk, right? Custodial risk.
00:09:16.025 - 00:09:22.797, Speaker A: So that's kind of the technical challenge that we're focused on is how do you do this intermediation in a way that preserves the benefits of DEFI in.
00:09:22.821 - 00:10:07.537, Speaker C: Terms of usable products? I think like one of the gold standards in the industry right now is etherfi liquid vaults. I. This was a part of why etherfi grew so quickly in like January, February, March of 2024. They went from I think less than a hundred million in December to like upwards of many billions. And I, I don't know the numbers today, but like it's been six, seven billion dollars of, of ether that is restaked. A huge part of their success story has been Veda. Mike Silagadzi, who's been on the podcast before, has, you know, gone on and on to Nomadic and me about just like what an incredible team you have, you specifically are to partner with.
00:10:07.537 - 00:10:24.249, Speaker C: So what can you tell us about like how did you land that early win maybe two. You can just take a step back and for folks who don't know etherfi liquid vaults, explain like what that is, how it works, and how Veda is ultimately powering that.
00:10:24.337 - 00:11:19.975, Speaker A: Yeah, There's a lot to say on this and etherfi has been early and correct on many things that are now just understood as like the correct views on in for how you like do a go to market and build a protocol. So maybe I can start with like a little backstory on like the how we started working with etherfi. First of all, I'm sure most listeners know what Etherfi is. They started as like a restaking protocol in eigenlayer and they started at a time they were the first restaking protocol and that led to certain advantages like having being one of the only ones with withdrawals enabled basically on day one. So they made a lot of correct decisions on their go to market as a restaking protocol, obviously earning the trust of like most of the people who are deploying capital in that space. So today etherfi has like $7 billion in TVL. They are you know, by far the largest restaking protocol on top of Eigenlayer.
00:11:19.975 - 00:11:59.185, Speaker A: But they have many, many more products that they've launched since then. So etherfi Liquid is effectively a yield aggregator product. What we've partnered with Etherfi to do through Liquid is launch a series of vaults. So again smart contracts and tokens that allow users to get exposure to different defi ecosystems in a really simple way. So we've launched products that are USD denominated, BTC denominated, they are cross chain. So we've actually built products together where a user can deposit their assets on ether mainnet and earn yield from different L2s simultaneously. I think that was like a first of its kind product.
00:11:59.185 - 00:12:40.735, Speaker A: So maybe a bit about the backstory. EtherFi Liquid was conceptualized back in March just like a little bit before Etherfi did their tge and we didn't have like a prior deep relationship. We'd like to work with them a little bit through our in our days at Somalia. So we're friendly with the team but they were really looking to partner with like a, an expert vault builder to pioneer this liquid product line. So they considered various options. We met them through, you know, some mutual contacts and I think it was like very obvious that our team was the most serious about security. We had the best track record for operating these things at scale.
00:12:40.735 - 00:13:11.535, Speaker A: So it was kind of a no brainer. And from there we basically were able to. Veda didn't exist at this point. When we first started talking to them we were just conceptualizing the protocol and so we showed them the tech and we were like this is the end game of vault infrastructure. It made perfect sense to Them. And so we were able to have this really, really strong launch for Veda. Within the first four weeks or the first three weeks of launching the first Ether via Liquid Vault, we grew to 400 million in TVL, which was like, you know, amazing for us, obviously.
00:13:11.535 - 00:13:51.091, Speaker A: And what I'll say is since then etherfi has been like the perfect partner because. Because of their views on how a protocol needs to go to market, specifically on vertical integration. Right. So there's this idea that there's just way too many, like, neutral base layer protocols which are like, we will never build products. We hope users will use our infrastructure because it's the best. But we're very focused on like, one thing etherfi, I think, has the right view, which is that once you get distribution, once you get users, you need to keep building products to keep them engaged and to keep them committed to your, to your protocol. Right.
00:13:51.091 - 00:14:16.141, Speaker A: And so what that means is starting as a restaking protocol, but offering more and more products. And so we've been, I think, really helpful for them to be able to offer this like, growing and diverse suite of products. And it's been perfect for us because they are like the, they totally got the vision. They really, like, are leveraging our infrastructure to the max. And it's been like this, I think, a really, really great success story for both of us.
00:14:16.253 - 00:14:42.227, Speaker D: Yeah. And to kind of hammer that home. Your, your example about etherfi. They started as this staking infrastructure and that's their first product called Stake. They kind of moved up the stack to Liquid. That allows users to kind of, I think, almost like participate at even more of like a retail level. And then cash is kind of the top of that vertically integrated stack, which is even more retail friendly and even closer to the customer.
00:14:42.227 - 00:15:12.935, Speaker D: And I think has massive potential for, to be like a major product breakthrough finally in crypto. So I guess, like from that kind of blueprint, like, what are you drawing from that is, you know, it's kind of like similar story here. You're starting as this infrastructure player, but are you kind of taking some of that roadmap that EtherFi has rolled out and like, okay, well what can we do next to maybe move up our stack, get a little closer to the customer here kind of. Where are you guys going now?
00:15:13.055 - 00:15:43.811, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a great, like, strategic question. So I think the first thing, the first part of our strategy is just getting more distribution for our vaults. Right. So, like, we're continuing to launch products with EtherFi. We also recently launched with Lombardi, which if people don't know is a bitcoin liquid staking token built on top of Babylon. They're one of the best teams in the space. I think there's a lot of hype, rightfully so, behind them, but we launched Evolved with them a couple months ago.
00:15:43.811 - 00:16:25.229, Speaker A: Today it's sitting at around 150, a little over 150 million in TVL. So that's also been a really successful partnership. So kind of phase one of the Veda growth plan is really working with different ecosystems and asset issuers to get these products into their users hands. Right. Like we go where the TVL is, we go where the distribution is and we're really just trying to build this universe of assets that are built on the Veda infrastructure. Now what you can do, once there exists a universe of tokens, yield bearing tokens built on Veda, I think that's where there's some really interesting opportunities. So one thing is creating some sort of shared liquidity between these assets.
00:16:25.229 - 00:17:07.287, Speaker A: I think that's, that's something we're thinking about. Another thing is just like having a distribution channel through the Veda app where people can explore different opportunities. Right. Like if you, if the way we like to think of it is you take an ecosystem and you encapsulate it in a token, right? So a lot of our products with Etherfi are you take parts of the Etherfi ecosystem and you represent it with a token. But where, you know, with Lombard, you take the LBDC Lombard Bitcoin ecosystem and you encapsulate it with a token. As we get these different ecosystems that are represented by a vault or token. I think there's a lot of value in having a shared dashboard or shared marketplace where people can discover new opportunities, move between existing opportunities.
00:17:07.287 - 00:17:21.698, Speaker A: So yeah, definitely we want to try to get closer to the user to some extent. But really our core focus today is working with the top asset issuers and protocols to get our infrastructure and our products into their users hands.
00:17:21.786 - 00:17:49.293, Speaker C: If you're a defi protocol, maybe like walk us through a perfect setup for them to use Veda. You know, you're offering whatever sort of yield or you've got, let's say like an lrt, like eth. Just walk us through some examples of like the struggles of like what it looks like today versus where they could be if they were to work with Veda and integrate all of that technology stack.
00:17:49.389 - 00:18:43.501, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. So I'll go over two like canonical examples. One of them, let's just take like an LST or an LRT or even a stablecoin issuer. When you're issuing, like a DEFI native asset or even if just a crypto asset in general, one of the core challenges is building liquidity on chain, right? It's one of the, you know, arguably L success and their defensibility is a result of steeth being everywhere, right? It's one of the most liquid assets. It's in every single lending market. It's widely available on many different L2s, and that's kind of the North Star for asset issuers. The challenge is how do you get there from day one, how do you build liquidity and build utility? One, in an efficient way that doesn't, like, cause you to burn a lot of money, and two, in like a, in a competitive way, right? Because you're, you're generally competing with other comparable asset issuers.
00:18:43.501 - 00:19:22.891, Speaker A: Like the LRT wars, for example, were really, really heated back in the day. And liquidity was one of the core metrics that users used to differentiate, right? It's like, okay, I don't really know the difference between these two LRTs, but one of them has way more liquidity. So that makes me, like, feel safer, right? But liquidity, meaning, like dex liquidity. So what Veda can do. Veda is effectively like a way to supercharge your liquidity and utility in Defi. So we'll go with Lombard as an example. We were live with them almost on day one, and since then, just over the past couple months, we've been able to create tens of millions of dollars of Dex liquidity.
00:19:22.891 - 00:20:03.907, Speaker A: And this is efficient liquidity. On Uniswap V3, what that facilitates is Oracle integrations. It allows the asset to be integrated into different lending protocols and yield trading platforms like Pendle. But then we go one step further with our Veda vault users who deposit in the beta vault, they're also earning yield from these new Defi opportunities as they come out, right? So Pendle is one of the, I think, the best yield sources in Defi. And so we have this single vault with Lombard that not only creates Dex liquidity for them, but also offers a passive way for their users to get exposure to these DEFI protocols. So this is what I mean by encapsulating an ecosystem in a token. So that's one thing.
00:20:03.907 - 00:20:36.365, Speaker A: You're an asset issuer. You want to build utility, you want to offer a passive way for your users to get exposure to these defi integrations. Another kind of canonical example, which we should have some news coming out fairly soon, is working with L2s. So L2s. You know, I think I have a lot of thoughts on what a winning strategy for L2s looks like in this day. And the winning strategy is not just like, build another generic General Purpose DeFi L2 and Hope users come. Like, I think Arbitrum is fairly ahead with that base.
00:20:36.365 - 00:21:27.985, Speaker A: Obviously has done a great job with their like, distribution cannon. But specifically, like, ideally, if you're, if you're an L2, ideally you have novel protocols and apps that have launched on your chain, right? That's one core way you differentiate, which is do things that are exclusive and like, only, only able to be built on your chain. The challenge with that is that if you have protocols that aren't just like an AAVE fork or Uniswap fork, very few people know how to use these protocols. Right? So there's almost this trade off between like, you want to encourage novelty and you want to encourage uniqueness, but it comes out a trade off of usability. So what Veda can enable is one click access into this unique ecosystem on an L2. Right. So you can imagine an L2 offering a product with Veda that is passive for users, users just deposit their assets.
00:21:27.985 - 00:21:46.113, Speaker A: But that capital is now being efficiently deployed across these interesting protocols. It can be directed based on the L2's goals. So if they want to, you know, prioritize specific protocols, if they want to use that liquidity to attract new builders, they can do that. So yeah, I think this is like the two of the core use cases for Veda.
00:21:46.169 - 00:22:03.391, Speaker C: Just a quick follow up. You've mentioned L2s. Can you remind us who does Veda support in terms of networks? We know Ethereum, mainnet, but what L2s do you already support? And then like, do you support anything outside of the evm, like a Solana? Yeah.
00:22:03.543 - 00:22:50.815, Speaker A: So EVM world, obviously we're on mainnet, we support Arbitrum, Base, optimism, most of the super chains really, because those are all similar from an integration perspective, but also like, you know, Linea, scroll, mantle, those are a couple of other ones. We're really just driven by product demand. So as soon as we have user Demand for supporting NUL2, it's pretty easy for us to add it. Now alt EVM is something that we should have some interesting stuff coming out soon. There's nothing specific to our infrastructure at Veda that restricts us to the evm. It's just taking our core smart contracts and even our off chain stack and deploying that on Solana, for example. So yeah, I can say that Veda will have a presence on Solana fairly soon.
00:22:50.815 - 00:22:57.395, Speaker A: It may not be like within a month, but it's definitely something we're looking at, especially as that like defi ecosystem heats up.
00:22:59.855 - 00:23:01.031, Speaker B: Before we get back to the show.
00:23:01.063 - 00:23:02.535, Speaker C: We wanted to share a quick update.
00:23:02.575 - 00:23:05.303, Speaker B: From our sponsor at Mantle Metamorphosis.

00:23:32.461 - 00:23:33.957, Speaker C: Community for supporting us here at the.
00:23:33.981 - 00:23:36.425, Speaker B: Edge podcast and the Edge newsletter.
00:23:38.245 - 00:24:15.317, Speaker D: And then son, what do you think still needs to happen to bring these Web2 users into this space and to be able to access these yields? Because I think the yields are starting to get close to mature enough where some. You can start to find some stable yields from good sources that we trust and they're more made up of this native yield rather than completely incentivized by native tokens points completely. So yeah, I guess the question is like how, how do you actually bring those users in? Or do you even think we're ready for that yet?
00:24:15.381 - 00:24:54.887, Speaker A: Yeah, so I, I definitely think we're ready. Actually there's been this like sentiment going around which I, I personally agree with, that the infrastructure is ready. Like it hasn't been, you know, it's, it's a new. Something new that the defi infrastructure is ready. So I think there's two things that need to happen to actually get mass adoption of defi. The first is that you do need the infrastructure, right? Like you need defi protocols that are robust, battle tested, have like ideally existed through multiple cycles. But you also need that intermediation infrastructure that I talked about, right? Which is like how you abstract these protocols and produce products.
00:24:54.887 - 00:25:48.095, Speaker A: The other thing you need is consumer focused defi founders. I think there's been way too many just like base layer protocols, which are people who want to be neutral in the sense that neutral, in my opinion just means you aren't building for users, you're just building from a tech perspective. And so I think that we are starting to see a cohort of consumer focused defi founders who recognize that the infrastructure is ready and are even willing to build like develop that infrastructure, but who are focused on like distilling the best parts of defi and making that available. So I think we're, I think I'm very bullish on that right now. I think etherfi is like one great example of a very, very consumer focused protocol. But there's also like, you know, Infinix is another one that like, I think is really exciting. So we're seeing, we're seeing this play out.
00:25:48.095 - 00:26:00.023, Speaker A: Like I think we are at the precipice of teams that are actually have what it takes to take a lot of the value that we've collectively created in DEFI and bring that to users. Son.
00:26:00.119 - 00:26:24.915, Speaker D: We saw what played out with Ethereum liquid restaking and it seems like that is still in its infancy with the bitcoin ecosystem. Just curious, like somebody with your perspective, how big do you think the bitcoin restaking space can get? Do you think it could be something that compares with the Ethereum restaking space in size?
00:26:27.575 - 00:27:26.365, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely think it could be comparable. The interesting thing with bitcoin, first of all, there's some structural dynamics that are very different with Bitcoin specifically, I think the holder base tends to be a lot more concentrated. There's a couple of whales or cartels or whatever you want to call them that control a lot of the bitcoin. So I think part of the adoption story will require buy in from some of these larger institutions and large bitcoin holders. But what we've seen with Babylon and the bitcoin, a lot of the Bitcoin LSTs is that there is meaningful demand for bitcoin yield, right? Like there are, there is a non trivial subset of holders who are looking, who are willing to deploy their capital into DEFI to some extent. Now there's a spectrum here, right? Like staking your Bitcoin with Babylon is kind of one level of risk. Bringing that into Defi and deploying it into DEFI protocols and lending markets and things like that is another level.
00:27:26.365 - 00:28:00.555, Speaker A: But I think there's this clear trend and clear demand and you know, we can see this from Coinbase with their CBTC product as well. That was one of the most successful launches I've ever seen. Especially if you compare that to like, you know, CBE. It's in DeFi. I think like day one, I was watching these markets very closely. Day one, there were tens of millions of dollars of liquidity on Dexes both on base and on Mainnet. You, you could see with aave, as soon as they opened their CBDC caps, that capital that those caps were immediately flooded and filled.
00:28:00.555 - 00:28:21.047, Speaker A: And so yeah, I'm, I'm pretty bullish on Defi on, on Bitcoin Defi specifically. I think that uh, it's clear that there's demand for this now what this will scale to. Will a trillion dollars of bitcoin come on chain? I think that's, that's a harder question and it'll be a really long time to, for that to play out. But there's definitely billions of dollars with demand for, for yield on Bitcoin.
00:28:21.231 - 00:28:53.331, Speaker B: Say hello to Puffer Unifi. Puffer Finance is expanding beyond native liquid restaking with new products such as Unifi based rollup and Unifi pre confirmation. Unifi is not just another L2. Unifi is a based rollup, one that will solve L2 issues such as slow withdrawals versus instant withdrawals. With Puffer Unifi. Puffer Unifi is fast capable of sub second transactions. Unifi also has boosted Puffer points, which means if you bridge assets, you earn boosted Puffer points and rewards.
00:28:53.331 - 00:29:03.535, Speaker B: From Dapps on Unifi. Puffer's core products mean a bright future for Ethereum. Puffer Unify will launch in November 2024. Learn more at Puffer Fi.
00:29:06.195 - 00:29:40.253, Speaker D: Son Switching gears here, we're seeing the AI agent meta return a lot to Defi and crypto more broadly with this Truth terminal coming out. Virtuals IO launched this thing called Luna, who's talking on Twitter all day as well. And then we know the parallel parallel team are working on Wayfinder. So just kind of curious your perspective on kind of this clash of AI and crypto and is this even something that Veda is looking into or taking seriously to maybe integrate into your own products?
00:29:40.389 - 00:30:10.555, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a, this is, this is another great topic. There's a spectrum here. Right. There's like the left curve stuff is definitely these like AI meme coins, which I'm definitely long. I'm like a huge. I think the story of Goat and Truth Terminal is one of the like most interesting like backstories and narratives For a meme coin. You have this like, like, you know, jailbroken AI agent that's like a Kol on CT and shilling its coin and is now like a millionaire or like a Deca millionaire.
00:30:10.555 - 00:31:02.265, Speaker A: I think recently. I think it's just like an amazing story for a meme coin on the other side. Like really right curve stuff is, you know, like real use cases and real, real intersections between AI and crypto which there's like inference, like decentralized inference, decentralized training. I think the overlap with Veda specifically and bringing this Back to vault is that my expectation is potentially in the near future it will be algorithms that do this intermediation. So specifically like you need this layer that is abstracting over different DEFI protocols, whether that's like doing portfolio allocations or like risk management and offering that product to users. I think that that infrastructure layer will be heavily, heavily driven by AI. And there's reasons that I think this will happen in DEFI first, even before traditional finance.
00:31:02.265 - 00:31:35.601, Speaker A: One of the core ones being that all of the data is open in defi and it's permissionless to transact. So it very much lends itself to AI agents taking action on behalf of users. Whether that's like intent fulfillment or portfolio optimization. It might be a while. I think people will take some time to actually fully trust agents autonomously. But for a protocol like Veda, what that means is as we build our DEFI strategies and our vault infrastructure, we can increasingly integrate AI agents into that process. So it's not going to be a zero to one thing.
00:31:35.601 - 00:31:43.025, Speaker A: There will be like kind of a curve of adoption. But I think already today AI agents are useful in a lot of these things.
00:31:43.185 - 00:32:20.417, Speaker C: So interesting. Sun, I want to talk about modularity and like how that fits into the roadmap for Veda. So I think it's fair to say Veda's yield layer or DEFI earn network, it clearly emphasizes modularity. Can you explain how does that create opportunity for, you know, new protocols and assets to be supported? Also maybe you could even take a step back and just talk about like what does that modularity mean to Veda and to the product? Like how does that ensure that Veda as a product stays relevant?
00:32:20.521 - 00:32:59.681, Speaker A: Yeah, so modularity I guess can mean a lot of different things. I think the most relevant definition is we are going to live in a multi chain future. I think that is like clear and we can see that because like a lot of the tough crypto brands and projects, even just today it was announced that Kraken is launching an L2. We're just seeing, we're just seeing tons of like really blue chip companies coming and wanting to build their own chains. We're also seeing apps move to launching their own chains. So multichain world, that's one piece of modularity. Like I also think we'll live in a multi asset world.
00:32:59.681 - 00:33:48.019, Speaker A: This might be sound fairly obvious, but I think that we are just now scratching the surface of the types of assets that live on chain. Right. Like the largest assets, there's like ETH and LSTs and Bitcoin. But we still haven't broken through to actually tokenizing really, really interesting things and bringing them on chain. People are starting to do it. Like story protocol, for example, is tokenizing ip. But the point is, when we live in a world that has many different chains and many different assets, that is even more complicated, right? Like, it is even more essential in that world where you have companies and you have protocols that are abstracting over all of the different legos that exist, plugging them in, and basically distilling that value for users to consume.
00:33:48.019 - 00:34:32.377, Speaker A: So, like, you know, one of our. This is like, kind of core to the reason we think Theta is something useful to build. It's that as Defi grows, we think it'll continue to increase in complexity because there's going to be more assets, there's going to be more, like, primitives and protocols, there's going to be more chains. And so, yeah, I think that's really, really bullish for our story. And this is, this is what, like, you know, interoperability really means. It's like we, we need to build for a world where different participants can, like, express their own worldview, whether that's launching their own chain or launching their own asset. But, you know, how does a user deal with that? And that's, that's really kind of the goal for Vedz, to make that really easy to, to abstract over all these complex Legos.
00:34:32.481 - 00:34:40.593, Speaker C: Son, can you just dive a little bit deeper on interoperability? Like, how does that impact the roadmap for Veda products?
00:34:40.729 - 00:35:18.891, Speaker A: I think maybe the, like, if there is like, more nuance to it, and this is like another trend with Infinix, I think, as like, is talking about this a lot, but they're like, the interoperability doesn't need to be solved on chain. That's. That's maybe like a misconception. First of all, bridging sucks today. Obviously, like, for, for a normal person figuring it out, it's like you want to pull your hair out and it's super stressful, right? Because you don't know if you, like, are getting your funds or not. But that being said, like, it is, it is secure. Like, you can securely bridge if you have the technical expertise to, like, know how to use these systems.
00:35:18.891 - 00:36:12.043, Speaker A: So I think that, like, this ties back to the point of the infrastructure being ready. The infrastructure is not ready for, like, a normal person to use it. But what you can do is move the abstraction and the interoperability off chain and effectively abstract that away from users, right? So, like, if you can create a secure bridging experience or a yield experience. That's cross chain where users don't even have to see it necessarily, but they know that it's happening securely and transparently. I think there's a lot of value in that. So yeah, I'm like very influenced by what Cain and nflnex have been doing, which is you can actually, if you are willing to build stateful apps that you move a lot of the stuff off chain, you keep the financially sensitive stuff on chain, but you can do anything you want off chain to offer a better user experience. So yeah, I think that like, yeah, those are my thoughts.
00:36:12.139 - 00:36:38.187, Speaker C: Guys, this has been an awesome conversation. I think this is a good place for us to start to close out. So I want to remind our listeners they should learn more about Veda by going to Veda Tech. They should follow vedalabs on Twitter or X follow Sun's handle. It's here. It's S U N A N D R underscore. We'll put that into our show notes so you can easily reference it and.
00:36:38.251 - 00:36:40.155, Speaker B: Otherwise son, thanks so much for coming.
00:36:40.195 - 00:37:17.181, Speaker C: On again, like really just a compelling story about a team that has found product market fit, has the background to have been building this space for years. And I really look at your success as it's very bootstrapped. Like there's no like easy route to what you've accomplished. That said, like with partners like etherfi that you found so much success with, you know, there's so many more yield products for Veda to power. So anyways, any final word for us or any like call to action for folks to get involved with Veda?
00:37:17.293 - 00:37:33.109, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. This was a great conversation. What I'll say is it's going to be we're still going to be building through the end of this year. We have a lot of exciting news coming out I think in the next couple of weeks. So yeah, just follow us on Twitter and I think you'll be surprised by some of the stuff that we're going to be launching.
00:37:33.237 - 00:37:50.765, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in.
