00:00:00.250 - 00:00:48.540, Speaker A: This is the DFI download at Permissionless 2022, brought to you by Bancor. I'm joined by Mariano Conte, who is a friend of ethereum, longtime Ethereum. Og Mariano too deserves credit for the, the origination of multicolateral Dai. I mean, you were the head of smart contracts at Maker, but I want to talk to you a little bit about your perspective, having built for so many years on Ethereum, I guess take me back to 2018. Talk to me about all of the challenges, the stresses, the tragedies of building during that really tough market versus what we see today.
00:00:49.390 - 00:01:09.730, Speaker B: It is very different. It is very different than what we're seeing today. Back in 2018, everything was still an experiment. Mostly. The term had only just started. There were very few protocols. Remember, uniswap wasn't even around when single collateral die came out.
00:01:09.730 - 00:01:54.130, Speaker B: That was later. You need to remember it's four years ago, but it's a lifetime in DeFi terms. And the crucial thing was a lot of people thought that it was actually going to zero, that we looked at each other and said, okay, this was a great experiment. It didn't work. We'll fix it next time, maybe, but that's it. And then, of course, it didn't happen because what people had built, most of it had some kind of resilience, right? And it found its product, market fit, it found users, and we saw what happened then. We saw a proliferation of interesting products and what people now call D five 1.0
00:01:54.130 - 00:02:52.306, Speaker B: maybe. But there were real projects with real users, real use cases, and a lot of things flourished from that bear market I mentioned all the time, Molokdao. Molokdao was a community project started by Amin and Cassandra and people who loved the ecosystem so much. And remember, there were projects that had trouble paying their bills, paying salaries, because ether was hovering at 80. After a run up to what, 1400? Nobody knew what was going to happen. And this was a grassroots movement to create a grant dow to just give out money to projects and keep on building. Out of Moloch Dao came a thousand different dows, Metacartel, Orochi, a lot of smaller ones that nobody has heard of.
00:02:52.306 - 00:03:40.926, Speaker B: But it created coordination, it gave us an optimistic view of the future. And in part it even helped with the merge right now and the next version of Ethereum, the proof of stake, because a project called the state of Ethereum two was funded by Molokdao. And out of that, Danny Ryan was selected to be the head of these new developments. So there are tiny ripples that people maybe don't know about, but tiny seeds that blossom into other bigger things. And all of that happened in the deep bear market because some people were optimistic that what we were building was real and had real value.
00:03:41.028 - 00:04:23.050, Speaker A: You give a lot of perspective. There's just so much that we depend on now. You know, if you go as simple as just using dai as a stable coin, that wasn't something that existed at one point. And we were living in a world where you were used to just not being able to do much of anything other than send ether to another wallet. Those at the time were more of a signal of how powerful the whole Ethereum settlement layer was, and that we would be able to build the smart contracts and have all these applications that mimic finance.
00:04:23.130 - 00:04:25.054, Speaker B: But you could see it, you could.
00:04:25.092 - 00:04:26.418, Speaker A: See it, you could feel it, but.
00:04:26.584 - 00:04:28.802, Speaker B: It was coming, but it wasn't there yet.
00:04:28.936 - 00:04:42.578, Speaker A: I thought we were ten years away. To be clear, I thought I wouldn't be able to lend or even trade the way that we do on Uniswap or Bancorp or a Dex aggregator now. I mean, the liquidity is so deep.
00:04:42.674 - 00:05:03.280, Speaker B: How many times did people say uniswap is never going to amount to much and now has more liquidity than centralized exchanges and it is actually easier to use. It's crazy. You go on an aggregator and you grab from many, many different sources and you can swap anything you like.
00:05:04.450 - 00:05:35.560, Speaker A: That was a major flipping, like when we were able to not just go trade on Uniswap because we wanted to dog food this tool that we believed was the future. It was like, hey, there's better rates, there's less slippage. Now trading on a uniswap, I mean, curve didn't exist. You didn't need a curve because you only had dai. And then tether came. I'm trying to remember when tether actually did eventually move over to Ethereum. That's another watershed moment though.
00:05:35.560 - 00:05:42.090, Speaker A: That's so much stablecoin liquidity that's now relying upon Ethereum.
00:05:42.510 - 00:06:30.620, Speaker B: Stablecoins allow people to keep their money in the blockchain, right inside the blockchain. It's always been a little bit difficult to go in and out, and it was okay, you had your money in ether and then if you wanted to go back to dollars, you had to take it out of the blockchain. With stablecoins, we saw that a lot of the money stayed in the system, right? And it increased adoption immensely. So it's cliche to say that this time it's different, but there are many echoes of what happened in the past bear market to what is happening here. And the thing is, right now the market is a lot more mature. There are many, many more projects, and there are things that are not going to survive. I know this.
00:06:30.620 - 00:07:12.578, Speaker B: But the projects that really end up doing something different and something useful, those are going to keep on going because that's the thing. It's just build something that people want and use. It's simple to use and it's easy to integrate and that it has the blockchain ethos of permissionlessness and composability. All those things that we talk about, decentralization, people want those things. And those things in Ethereum, they are only good for everybody. And they make other people want to build on top of them. And then you get a little bit of a moat and then you become unstoppable.
00:07:12.754 - 00:07:43.066, Speaker A: Yeah. I always try to come back to what's the simplest reason that Defi is going to make it. And I just think of my own personal experience. I could not live without DeFi. It is my finance system now. It is not my alternative finance system. It is the home of where my wealth, any sort of money that I would have in my portfolio, it's sitting in my defi portfolio.
00:07:43.066 - 00:08:26.670, Speaker A: What exists beyond that is just fiat on ramps and off ramps, so I can take money and go pay my mortgage. There's a legacy world there that hasn't adopted it, but I have no other alternative. And I know, obviously, you and many other friends and users who are like, I couldn't do what I do with Defi, I couldn't do that with traditional finance. There's so much gating in that world. And I think at the end of the day, we have a long way to go. We know we're still very early. The end of the road is getting to a place where more people on the planet are using, I think, digitally native finance, the likes of Ethereum.
00:08:26.670 - 00:08:30.138, Speaker A: Also, hopefully, to using l two. That's like a whole nother.
00:08:30.234 - 00:09:17.742, Speaker B: That is one of the biggest things for this to be open and inclusive, we need l two s, we need scalability, we need cheaper transactions. And that is coming. What I always say is the cliche that we're so early, but we're so early because we're using Ethereum main net, not in the way that it's intended. The way that it's always been intended is for it to be a settlement layer for the big players, right? And the big players include scalability. So me as a user, I'm not going to send you $10 on L one, that's not feasible in the long run. It used to be when there were fewer users and when gas was cheap. But for that we're going to be using scalability solutions, be there optimistic or secret roll ups or whatever else comes.
00:09:17.742 - 00:09:35.778, Speaker B: It's going to be one of those. But they were not here yet. Now they're starting to become more available. But it's weird to say we've been using Ethereum wrong, but we've been using Ethereum wrong and we're all anchored there. Individuals, we're not going to use that.
00:09:35.864 - 00:10:16.402, Speaker A: All the liquidity, all of our usage has been so anchored to L one. So we got to talk with. Yeah, we got to talk with Kane from synthetics earlier about their move to optimism. And I think that we almost dampened the hype of Ethereum l two somewhere along the way because there were alternative l ones that are EVM compatible, that were able to suck up users. And we were talking about the fact that that's an opportunity. There are users who are living on avalanche, phantom, whatever, and those users also, they talk the same way. They're like, I love this.
00:10:16.402 - 00:10:33.862, Speaker A: This is a better world. It's more accessible. I think ultimately it's a more equal world to be able to use permissionless, trustless applications like this for money and finance. All those folks have to do now is figure out how to bridge over to optimism using the thing is that.
00:10:33.916 - 00:10:53.866, Speaker B: Feeling when you move to an alternate l one, that is not Ethereum, and fees are cheap and you can do DfI again, but it doesn't last. People say, oh yes, on this chain everything is pennies or fractions of a penny. But then they become popular and then they have their own mean.
00:10:53.968 - 00:11:37.322, Speaker A: By the way, if anyone watches this in the future, we're talking after Terra has collapsed to literally zero. I mean, UsT has basically gone to zero and Luna's gone to zero. And there are really talented builders that existed on terra, but there was always this tail risk. And I'm hoping it's a wake up call for more to realize it's never been apples to apples. When you compare L one, it's always been apples and oranges. And we prioritize decentralization security of Ethereum L One, while we're going to benefit from the scaling with L two. And then of course there's other added benefits we're excited about with Ethereum 2.0.
00:11:37.322 - 00:11:50.990, Speaker A: But the reason you'll be able to transact for cheap fees and obviously in a much faster transaction time, that all has to do with Ethereum l two. That's unrelated to Ethereum 2.0.
00:11:51.060 - 00:11:56.222, Speaker B: Yeah, no, the merge is going to be a different thing. We're almost there.
00:11:56.276 - 00:12:16.710, Speaker A: I mean, Netnet of all this is users just want to use applications and they don't need to know all the stuff we're talking about. But I think it's important to understand that context because there's other users that are really early to this space, and I'm hoping those users and builders can find a new home on Ethereuml tool like optimism arbitram ZK sync.
00:12:19.150 - 00:12:51.218, Speaker B: We always have our arms open to receive builders. It's one of the friendliest communities that I've seen and so much easier to get into it now. The amount of information, tutorials, boot camps, whatever, to get in and learn these technologies. Not to sound like an old fart, but when we started it was a little bit harder. There was not much around. You had to bang your head against the wall. And a lot of it was learning as you went and coming up with new things.
00:12:51.218 - 00:13:04.120, Speaker B: Now there's so much that just you have one good idea and almost like everything is there for you to pick and choose and then just add in your secret sauce and come up with the great next thing.
00:13:04.650 - 00:13:13.990, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Mariano, so good to see you. Always like a total joy to hang out with you and. Yeah, man, just excited for what's to come here.
00:13:14.060 - 00:13:15.698, Speaker B: Me too. The future is bright.
00:13:15.794 - 00:13:30.250, Speaker A: Future is very bright. It's.
