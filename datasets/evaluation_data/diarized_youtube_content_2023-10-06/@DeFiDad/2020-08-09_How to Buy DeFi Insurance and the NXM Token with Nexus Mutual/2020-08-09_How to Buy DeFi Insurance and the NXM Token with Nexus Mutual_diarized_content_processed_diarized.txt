00:00:29.410 - 00:01:04.886, Speaker A: Hi everyone. This is Defi dad. Today I'm going to walk you through how to buy smart contract cover, or what I refer to commonly as insurance, with Nexus Mutual. So I've been using Nexus mutual since November 2019. They've been around about one year, and I use this to protect my assets that are deposited into DFI applications. This is like car insurance, but for protecting my DFI assets. So you can see an example here of a quote for Ave where I've got ten ETH that I want to ensure I get a payout for.
00:01:04.886 - 00:01:29.870, Speaker A: So this is how much I would get paid out over the next 30 days and I would pay zero 78 ether, which is a 9.5% annualized premium. So we're going to talk all about how this works today, how I can protect my assets in DFI by using Nexus mutual, but also how Nexus mutual operates as a people powered alternative to insurance that is built on Ethereum using smart contracts.
00:01:34.550 - 00:02:41.830, Speaker B: Before we get started on how to buy smart contract cover, you have to understand what Nexus mutual is and how it's actually operating. So they call themselves a people powered alternative to insurance. It's very much like every other Defi application. The idea is to create a flywheel that is driven by the code or smart contracts that are powering the application. The idea is to decentralize and to allow this code to provide a more effective and a more efficient alternative to, let's say, a legacy insurance company. And so there's two sides to this that we're going to cover today. One is how do I protect myself and buy smart contract cover? Essentially, how do I buy like car insurance but for Defi? And what's cool about this is you can get quoted and it's really straightforward to figure out how much it's going to cost and for whatever customizable amount of time you want in order to protect your assets that are deposited into defi applications.
00:02:41.830 - 00:03:49.982, Speaker B: On the other side of that is those that own a part of the mutual. These are folks that buy the NXM token which powers Nexus mutual. This is what allows Nexus mutual to provide smart contract cover, but it also is a way of growing a quote unquote healthy mutual over time that allows it to continue to offer even more and more cover for this rapidly growing defi space. At this time, Nexus Mutual only offers smart contract cover, and that's a pretty big endeavor because they are the only folks who actually offer this sort of COVID There is a secondary offering from open with a Y. You can buy what is essentially a put option, but it's protection for your assets in specific applications like compound. But it's very limited at this time. And so Nexus is bearing the brunt of protecting us as DFI has exploded here over the last 90 days.
00:03:49.982 - 00:04:35.854, Speaker B: Here it's gone up from 1 billion all the way up to 4.46 billion. Long term, Nexus Mutual is hoping to offer other products like earthquake cover. So I think it's just interesting to note that while this is actually working relatively well, they have much greater aspirations in terms of providing this people powered alternative to insurance. At the heart of Nexus Mutual is a token that is referred to as NXM. And the way that this works is NXM allows them to raise capital. It allows them to create incentives that are aligned so that the token is meant to appreciate as the mutual continues to grow.
00:04:35.854 - 00:05:50.600, Speaker B: And as long as the mutual is quote unquote healthy, which refers to it being over collateralized to be able to pay out all of the insurance covers that have been purchased and that much more so that they always have extra capital on hand. And then lastly, the token price is meant to be linked to actual adoption of Nexus Mutual, and it's meant to be also, I think, unintentionally linked to adoption in DFI. As I was saying earlier, total value locked in USD has gone up almost four and a half x since 90 days ago. And then even if you don't like that metric, measuring it in ether, it's still pretty impressive. It's up about 55%. What's challenging about that, I mean, aside from all that growth happening at once, is that we really need to be able to scale Nexus so that we have more cover and essentially more protection against a smart contract bug, which when I think about defi applications, the number one risk that is always present is a smart contract bug. I will never be able to escape that because it is always present.
00:05:50.600 - 00:06:22.494, Speaker B: And we've gotten better at auditing smart contracts and demanding that teams have their smart contracts audited. But at the end of the day, it's risk that always exists. So this is the one way that I know how to mitigate that risk. Before I go any further, if you're looking to simply understand how to buy smart contract cover, I would skip this part of the video and move to the next section. However, if you also are interested in.
00:06:22.532 - 00:06:25.166, Speaker A: How to stake NXM and be able.
00:06:25.188 - 00:08:03.242, Speaker B: To earn as a member of the mutual who owns a part of the mutual and hence is providing smart contract cover by staking NXM against smart contracts, then I would watch the rest of this. So Nexus mutual is interesting because it provides this token that allows us to what? Raise capital, align incentives of the mutual with protecting the policyholders, and then also align it with actual adoption of Defi and ultimately the performance of the mutual. The NXM token uses a bonding curve. I'm not going to go super deep into this, but the reason I bring it up is because I am going to show how I can become an owner of the mutual and I can purchase NXM and I can actually stake NXM and then potentially earn a portion of the premiums that are being paid by people to obtain smart contract insurance. So the way the token model works is if you look here at this curve, this reflects price going upwards as total funds of the mutual increase makes sense. The mutual is growing in terms of its capital and its ability to offer cover, and that the token price should increase with that. Now, another part of the equation that relates back to why Nexus mutual is able to offer insurance driven by this token NXM.
00:08:03.242 - 00:08:42.138, Speaker B: At the heart of how it actually operates is what's referred to as minimum capital required. Now, everything in Nexus mutual is measured in ether. And I think that makes sense because for those of us who are early adopters in DeFi, ether is a store of value. It's a capital asset. It's a transformable, consumable asset that we use in most of the different DeFi applications. So MCR, or minimum capital required, refers to how much capital is required in order to be confident that all claims can be paid. So this is very important.
00:08:42.138 - 00:09:51.922, Speaker B: Otherwise the mutual would become insolvent and it wouldn't be able to continue operating on offering smart contract cover. So if we know that the total amount of funds in the mutual, which is referred to as the capital pool, needs to grow in order for the mutual to continue to operate and offer more smart contract cover. And if we know that minimum capital required also needs to grow, that's another part of the equation here, measured in ether, that affects the price. Then we can start to come up with what is this price of NXM? So NXM is different than a token that you would find in another protocol where it ends up trading on, let's say a Dex, and buyers and sellers dictate the price. Here, NXM is minted on Nexus mutual, and you want to exchange that NXM for the underlying ether that you might have in the mutual as an owner of the mutual. So this equation here, these are just constants. So I'm just going to ignore them.
00:09:51.922 - 00:10:40.014, Speaker B: They were calculated to enable them to launch and create that curve, the bonding curve. But what you're looking at is minimum capital required in ether, which has traditionally been rising by 1% daily. The idea is to continue to push the mutual to grow in terms of capital, so that it can continue to offer more and more smart contract cover. And then here you notice this MCR percentage. This refers to the amount of capital in the pool divided by minimum capital required. And here's a really simple example to sort of bring this to life over time. We have this capital pool, and it's growing because of two different reasons.
00:10:40.014 - 00:11:47.318, Speaker B: One is there are folks like me who think that the mutual, from a business standpoint, makes sense, and that I want people to be able to have smart contract cover. And so I'm putting ether into the mutual and I'm ultimately taking NXM as the token. Another reason is others are buying smart contract cover. So that's also increasing the capital pool, because just like car insurance, you pay a little premium for protection in case of a catastrophic event. So those two things are contributing to this capital pool on the bottom of the equation. Minimum capital required is the thing that's actually growing by 1% daily. So this is a fraction, and it means that we need the capital pool to grow faster than the bottom of the fraction in order for MCR percentage to continue to grow and for the NXM token to appreciate, which more importantly has to do with the mutual continuing to grow and be over collateralized and hence be able to offer smart contract cover.
00:11:47.318 - 00:12:51.830, Speaker B: Now, a similar but different example is let's pretend that as we focus on the capital pool, again, the top part of the fraction, let's pretend that folks aren't buying smart contract cover anymore. Well, that's not good. That indicates that there's less adoption of Nexus mutual and that people don't believe in the product. And so the capital pool would not be growing as quickly or potentially shrinking. Another thing is, if the capital pool is shrinking because of large payouts, because of smart contract bugs, and because we're having to pay off all of these policyholders who had insurance against those smart contract bugs. So this really incentivizes being well designed, like any insurance mutual, to be able to cover what folks are purchasing, but to not also overextend the risk that we can take on. And so in this example, the capital pool is shrinking.
00:12:51.830 - 00:13:15.746, Speaker B: MCR is mostly unchanged. It could be going up still 1% daily, but let's pretend it's mostly unchanged here. And so the price would fall. And that is how the NXM token works. So the reason I share this is because DFI is growing exponentially. You can see that here. And the mutual recognized that they wouldn't be able to grow fast enough.
00:13:15.746 - 00:13:21.890, Speaker B: The way that their minimum capital required was increasing 1% daily.
00:13:22.050 - 00:13:23.686, Speaker A: So in other words, they wouldn't have.
00:13:23.708 - 00:14:29.158, Speaker B: Enough funds to ever catch up with the growth of DFI. So instead, they decided to increase the minimum capital required, this part of the equation, by 1% every 4 hours, as long as MCR percentage is greater than 130%. So this has been actually suppressing the price of NXM, which is helping to bring down the price, and then ultimately it attracts more capital. And you can actually see that here if you go to Nexistracker IO, while I can see that over the last six months, the active cover. So this is insurance, the amount of insurance that's been bought, and this is being measured, and let's make sure that it's measured in ether here. So it's around 50,000 ether of COVID has been bought. And while that indicates that Nexus mutual is clearly valued, I mean, you can see that it's grown from what, July 2019? From about 1300 ether.
00:14:29.158 - 00:14:36.942, Speaker B: In terms of total insurance bought to now, it would be cover for almost.
00:14:37.076 - 00:14:37.646, Speaker A: What is that?
00:14:37.668 - 00:14:47.518, Speaker B: Almost 50,000 ether? 47,000 48,000 ether. But going back to the NXM token, if we look at the capital pool.
00:14:47.694 - 00:14:49.454, Speaker A: You can see that the capital pool.
00:14:49.502 - 00:15:04.854, Speaker B: Size is growing like crazy. So since July 1, it was around 4 million in US dollars. Let's switch this over to ether again. So since July 1, we've grown from.
00:15:04.892 - 00:15:13.450, Speaker A: About 17.8 thousand ether to about 55.
00:15:13.520 - 00:15:59.270, Speaker B: And a half thousand ether. The other part of the equation we talked about, the bottom of the denominator. So you look here, capital pool was around 55,000 ether. The bottom, the minimum capital required. This is the thing that's increasing 1% every 4 hours to push the mutual to be able to attract more capital and ultimately offer more smart contract cover. You can see here that minimum capital required, which goes up exponentially from July 13 or so and onward. Now, the mutual is saying that it requires 42,722 ether.
00:15:59.270 - 00:16:03.420, Speaker B: And then the last part of that.
00:16:04.110 - 00:16:06.634, Speaker A: Is if we take capital pool, the.
00:16:06.672 - 00:16:50.978, Speaker B: 55,000, over the 47,000 ether, then we get that percentage that needs to remain above 130%. And so as of today, we're around 132%, which is again the capital pool divided by minimum capital required. And this is just like every other DFI mechanism. It's always about being over collateralized and maintaining that over collateralization so that we can ensure that in this case we can ensure that those that are owning the mutual don't become insolvent because we've actually not had enough capital on hand to pay out all of the smart contract covers.
00:16:51.074 - 00:16:52.474, Speaker A: So now we're at a point where.
00:16:52.512 - 00:17:42.406, Speaker B: Our capital pool is growing in nexus to offer more DFI cover. The minimum capital required is growing 1% every 4 hours. Unless this MCR percentage goes below 130%. Then this mechanism gets killed until we reach 130%. And that means that the NXM price is also being pushed to grow so that nexus mutual can continue to grow capital and continue to extend more cover. That's all I'm going to cover on the token model today. I hope that that helps to bring understanding to why Nexus mutual actually works in terms of how they offer this smart contract cover, because that token is what allows them to operate so effectively and efficiently.
00:17:42.406 - 00:18:41.168, Speaker B: If you want to learn more about this or review it further, I'd recommend going to NexusMutual IO Tokenmodel in order to buy protection for my assets that are deposited into defi applications. You want to go to Nexusmutual IO, click on get a quote. Now this is the interface that is actually going to be replaced in the coming weeks. So if you're watching this in the future you won't recognize this and we're going to skip to the new interface. But if you're using the old interface, this is what it looks like and it's pretty straightforward. If I want to quote how much it's going to cost to protect my assets, it's really simple. Let's start with pretending that I have ten ether in Ave, so all I did is I clicked on Ave and it fills in the smart contract address.
00:18:41.168 - 00:18:55.476, Speaker B: So this is where you are filling in the addresses of whatever application it is, and they've got these shortened smart contract addresses that represent the actual address below. This is all a part of just.
00:18:55.498 - 00:18:56.964, Speaker A: Making it easier for you to pick.
00:18:57.002 - 00:19:25.036, Speaker B: The application in the new interface. It's a lot easier. You'll notice first off that the text and all of this is much larger so it's easier to read. And if I just click on cover, I can click buy cover and then I can choose from the many more applications that are available here. You actually can try to paste in a smart contract address here, although I.
00:19:25.058 - 00:19:28.304, Speaker A: Would assume that most of us that.
00:19:28.342 - 00:19:50.564, Speaker B: Are new to this aren't savvy enough to know that smart contract address, it's normally a matter of picking out where is my money? Is my money in an argent wallet? Is it in a balancer pool? Is it in compound? Do I have money in a stablecoin pool? But it's also staked partially in Iearn finance?
00:19:50.692 - 00:19:51.384, Speaker A: Where is that?
00:19:51.422 - 00:20:31.588, Speaker B: There we go. So here's an example. If I have money in the curve y pool, but I then have staked my LP token in Iearn finance, I need to actually buy both of these because it's two different risks that I'm exposed to with two different platforms in terms of smart contract bugs. So let's go ahead and choose. In this case, let's keep it really simple and we'll choose the curve stablecoin pool. So I'm going to go ahead and put in however many days I want protection for. It is a minimum of 30 days, but you can put in as many as you want.
00:20:31.588 - 00:20:33.332, Speaker B: So I could put in here 45.
00:20:33.386 - 00:20:36.310, Speaker A: Days, I could put in 365 days.
00:20:37.320 - 00:21:03.564, Speaker B: I'd recommend being conservative with this, unless you know that you're keeping funds in a pool for something like a year, which is kind of rare in DFI. There's a lot of liquidity that's shifting around. So think about being more incremental in terms of how I buy this insurance. So I'm just going to buy 30.
00:21:03.602 - 00:21:06.936, Speaker A: Days of COVID and then you'll notice.
00:21:07.048 - 00:21:15.808, Speaker B: There is no more capacity available, so there's more staking that's needed in order for me to be able to buy cover. So let's go ahead and go back.
00:21:15.894 - 00:21:19.844, Speaker A: Click on cover, click buy cover, and.
00:21:19.882 - 00:21:31.510, Speaker B: Let'S look for another application that I have money in. So let's choose Mstable. I've got some money in Mstable, so I'll choose that.
00:21:32.040 - 00:21:33.336, Speaker A: By the way, I don't even have.
00:21:33.358 - 00:22:36.350, Speaker B: To have money in any of these applications. If you want to bet that there's a smart contract bug in one of them, you can buy cover, and whatever the premium is that you pay, you will get a payout if a smart contract bug is discovered. So let's say I want cover for the next 30 days and let's pretend that in this case I can choose what payout I want, whether it's an ether or die. Let's pretend that I have 100 die in the application and then you notice I'm going to pay. In this case it's a 20% premium. And you'll notice that certain applications like uniswap, you pay a lot less money because the smart contracts have been around longer they have more audits. Basically they've been deemed less risky versus Mstable is a newer application and so they've deemed that this is higher risk at this point because it's newer, whatever reasons they have.
00:22:36.350 - 00:23:51.174, Speaker B: So you'll notice I have the quote over here based on the 20.87% on 100 die for 30 days, if I pay 1.71 die, I will have protection for 100 die payout over the next 30 days if a smart contract bug is discovered in Mstable. Now normally I would just click continue, but I'm not a member yet here, so I'm going to actually register this address and I have to go through a pretty brief KYC process. Now, you're probably wondering why the hell am I going through any sort of KYC? That is not what DeFi is about. Nexus mutual is run by a team that's out of the UK and they are still in the midst of having to operate under certain regulations and so there is a long term roadmap to them moving into a Dow. Actually, it's not too long term.
00:23:51.174 - 00:24:09.426, Speaker B: I think it's something that hopefully happens over the next six to twelve months. But the key takeaway here is this is a concession I have to make in order to use this right now. Recognize that by me doing KYC, I'm actually linking my name then to this address.
00:24:09.608 - 00:24:12.594, Speaker A: I mean, potentially that data is out.
00:24:12.632 - 00:24:15.266, Speaker B: There somewhere and so I just want.
00:24:15.288 - 00:24:16.686, Speaker A: To call out that risk.
00:24:16.798 - 00:24:44.692, Speaker B: If you would prefer to live without smart contract cover from Nexus mutual in order to preserve that privacy, there's definitely an argument to be made there. And so you wouldn't want to go through this. I'm going to go ahead and go through it though, just because I'm already a member of the mutual. So to become a member of the mutual, I pay a really small membership cost. This is actually a legal requirement. You can see it here.
00:24:44.746 - 00:24:46.872, Speaker A: So they're not trying to charge us.
00:24:46.926 - 00:25:11.382, Speaker B: They just have to do it legally and then I will become part owner of the mutual and the mutual is a legal entity. You'll also notice that if you are in any one of these countries, due to the regulation that nexus mutual operates under, still based in the United Kingdom.
00:25:11.526 - 00:25:14.910, Speaker A: They can't offer cover to any of these different nations.
00:25:16.370 - 00:25:32.210, Speaker B: All right, so I'm ready to become a member of the mutual. If you do check this out later, please make sure you read this yourself. I'm skimming over all of this just because I'm already a member of the mutual through a different address. So I'm going to click confirm.
00:25:35.190 - 00:25:35.554, Speaker A: And.
00:25:35.592 - 00:25:52.426, Speaker B: I'm going to end up paying 0.2 e as always. I checked the gas price at ethgastation info. It says that as long as the gas price is greater than 59, so.
00:25:52.448 - 00:25:54.906, Speaker A: I'll put it at 61, it'll go.
00:25:54.928 - 00:25:59.210, Speaker B: Through in less than 30 minutes and then I can hit confirm.
00:26:01.470 - 00:26:10.506, Speaker A: Okay, so after my transaction confirmed, which shows here that the membership fee is completed, I clicked on membership. Just know that you won't be prompted.
00:26:10.538 - 00:26:11.726, Speaker B: To do this, but you need to.
00:26:11.748 - 00:26:20.066, Speaker A: Click on membership in order to proceed with verifying your identity. And then this is pretty standard KYC AML stuff.
00:26:20.168 - 00:26:21.554, Speaker B: You have to submit your name and.
00:26:21.592 - 00:27:00.142, Speaker A: Address and some sort of ID document which is like a driver's license or passport. Remember, if you are not wanting to tie a name and an address to an Ethereum wallet address where at least a KYC AML partner has access to it, this is where you want to just quit on this video and you won't be able to get smart contract cover. There is promise that they are going to further decentralize into an actual DAO and that this is part of their current operations that will go away. And the key takeaway here is that.
00:27:00.196 - 00:27:03.566, Speaker B: KYC will whitelist whatever the address is.
00:27:03.668 - 00:27:40.714, Speaker A: That you have connected up above. So this is my defi dad ETH address and that's the one that I want to whitelist so that I can become a nexus mutual member and I can buy cover and I can also buy NXM and stake it to provide smart contract cover to others who seek out protection. So below I'm going to click on individual for myself when I get done. I'll be right back. Okay, so I'm back from verifying my identity and now it's pending. So I'm going to have to wait for however long it takes, which says up to 24 hours.
00:27:40.832 - 00:27:49.246, Speaker B: Just be aware, I did have to submit my name, my address, even my phone number as well as a form of ID.
00:27:49.428 - 00:27:51.534, Speaker A: And this is definitely one of the.
00:27:51.572 - 00:27:55.374, Speaker B: Challenges nexus has right now. I know folks who want to buy.
00:27:55.412 - 00:28:00.290, Speaker A: Smart contract cover but they can't just because they are unwilling to go through KYC.
00:28:00.710 - 00:28:04.002, Speaker B: But if you are, you can obtain smart contract cover.
00:28:04.136 - 00:28:07.282, Speaker A: Otherwise I would encourage you hop into.
00:28:07.336 - 00:28:11.478, Speaker B: The Discord group for Nexus and you.
00:28:11.484 - 00:28:47.296, Speaker A: Can learn more about the roadmap there and how they intend to decentralize into a dow. So I'm back about 12 hours later and my KYC went through overnight which means that I'm now able to buy smart contract cover. This is the older UI. I'm going to show you the newer one in just a moment, but just to quickly give you an example of how I can get a quote if I'm still using the old interface for Nexus. The hardest part about using this is that not all of the applications that.
00:28:47.318 - 00:28:48.756, Speaker B: They cover are here.
00:28:48.938 - 00:29:58.644, Speaker A: And you can go to the Nexus mutual Discord group by going to nexusmutual IO, look for the discord icon, and then if you search in there for something like cover or look for a name that's not here, like synthetics, they have a long list of all of the short ens addresses to choose which insurance I want cover for. And so I've bought this before and I just happen to know that if I type in synthetics Nexus mutual ETH, this will load the smart contract address that is cover for synthetics. Otherwise, you would normally just choose. And you can see you've got compound DdEx, DyDx exchange, dydx perpetuals, market, uniswap v one v two nuo zero x, instadap maker, gnosis safe Ave one inch, idle, finance set or token sets, and Bancorp. And there's lots more. Newer apps like mstable are available. You just have to go and look up that list in discord.
00:29:58.644 - 00:30:28.690, Speaker A: So if I'm ready to quote myself for synthetics, I could say, hey, I got ten ETH. I want a payout of ten ETH. If a smart contract bug is discovered, whether or not my funds are even compromised. It is all about if a smart contract bug is discovered, and again, there's nothing else that is covered. It is all about a smart contract bug being discovered. I can get a payout in ETH or die. So I could say I want to pay out 1000 die or however much money it is that I'm trying to protect.
00:30:28.690 - 00:30:52.520, Speaker A: In this case, I'm going to do ten E and then we'll do the minimum of 30 days. I can do anything over 30 days as long as I want, depending on how much value has been staked against the synthetics smart contracts in Nexus the other part of this equation that we're going to talk about later is there are others who are putting up value.
00:30:52.670 - 00:30:55.016, Speaker B: To protect us, to allow us to.
00:30:55.038 - 00:31:29.876, Speaker A: Buy smart contract cover, and then we're paying them a premium and they're taking the bet that there won't be a smart contract bug and that they'll walk away with the premium and that there won't have to be a payout. So we're ready to get our quote. Let's click get a quote. All right, there's my quote again. It's just like car insurance or any other insurance, except I think it's easier to get. You can see it's going to cost me 0.6 e, and that's for a fixed payout of ten e anytime over the next 30 days.
00:31:29.876 - 00:31:32.170, Speaker A: And so I could continue with that.
00:31:34.380 - 00:31:35.656, Speaker B: And all I'm going to have to.
00:31:35.678 - 00:32:37.806, Speaker A: Do in order to buy that smart contract cover is I am going to have to enable the NXM token first, and then I will end up sending in ETH. So it's two steps per usual with most applications in Defi built on Ethereum, there's an approval transaction, which is this approval to move tokens that would be in my wallet so that I can actually pay for something or execute a smart contract. And then after that we'll actually pay in ether, 636 ether in order to get cover. So let's flip over to the new user experience that hopefully you'll get to enjoy with this new design rolling out soon. So it's at preview nexusmutual IO please be aware this is new and there could be bugs. So let's go ahead and buy some cover easier than what I was doing on the old interface. I'm just going to look up synthetics.
00:32:37.806 - 00:33:13.710, Speaker A: There we go. And then I'm going to choose 30 days of COVID for ten ether. And let's see. Looks all good to me here. So this is what I like about the new design or the new dashboard here, is that it shows me what am I actually paying? 7.75% as a premium, and that is annualized. If I were to take this out to, let's say, 365 days, then I would end up paying zero 75 ether.
00:33:13.710 - 00:34:16.500, Speaker A: But I'm going to pay just a little bit less right now just for this demo and show you what it looks like over 30 days. As a reminder, the reason that I don't buy 365 day cover in most cases is that money moves around a lot in DFI. So if you know that you're going to be staking in synthetics and you're there for the next year, hey, that could be reason for me to buy myself 365 days of COVID But otherwise I'm a little bit more cautious and incremental in terms of how I buy cover. Okay, so I am going to pay Zero 66 ether. That's based on 7.75% as a premium. You can see that there's still 1004 ETH of coverage available according to how much stakers have staked against synthetics contracts in Nexus or they've insured against the synthetics platform.
00:34:16.500 - 00:35:11.694, Speaker A: So that's a lot more cover there that someone else could choose to purchase. And then the last bit of it here is just being mindful that I agree that smart contract cover is not a contract of insurance. Cover is provided on a discretionary basis with Nexus mutual members having the final say on which claims are paid. There is a governance aspect to this and so those that hold NXM, they're incentivized to vote truthfully whether or not there's a smart contract bug. But none of this is automated yet. So if there were a smart contract bug, I have to file the claim and then others who are a part of the mutual that own NXM will then vote on my claim. So I'll agree to and oh, one last thing is you can buy your cover using ether or NXM, but in this case I'm just going to pay for it in ether.
00:35:11.694 - 00:35:39.914, Speaker A: So the next step is for me to actually click here. I believe this will be improved when they actually launch this. But just so you know, there's no other obvious step. I will click buy cover after we do this transaction. So I click here. All right, and then just the usual sort of transaction we do before every defi application actually takes my money. So I'm going to click edit to check the gas price.
00:35:39.914 - 00:36:27.450, Speaker A: It looks like anything over 62 guay will get it done in less than 30 minutes. So I'm going to lower this just a little bit to let's do 68. And actually while we're here, the price just went up so I'm going to put it back to 75. When I check the gas station, I always make sure that I click confirm shortly after. Just because gas prices can change really quickly and I don't want to get stuck because my gas price is too low. Last thing I'm going to do then is check the permission. If I know that I am going to buy a certain amount of COVID and I know how much NXM that is, the more proper setting here is to put in exactly what that is so that I'm not giving unlimited permission.
00:36:27.450 - 00:36:58.290, Speaker A: I'm not quite sure what I'm going to be doing here yet. So I am going to leave this at unlimited and I'll use the token allowance checker tac Dapstar IO to later on change that permission back to being zero. All right, so I've got my permission properly set for me in this specific scenario where I'm going to buy more cover. Later. And then I've got my gas set and we're ready to go. Okay, I'm back. A few minutes later.
00:36:58.290 - 00:38:01.066, Speaker A: My transaction has confirmed, so I'm now able to buy cover. I'm going to pay zero 66 ether for cover that will protect me on ten ETH for up to 30 days. And one last reminder, I do not have to actually have ten ether in synthetics under this wallet address. These are policies or cover that I am buying that entitles me to a payout regardless of whether I have assets in it. So I could potentially speculate on there being a bug in one of these applications and I could buy cover for however much is available. So let's go ahead and click buy cover. So you can see that despite the fact that I'm buying only 0636 ether of COVID which covers me for ten ether, like this is the premium that I'm actually paying.
00:38:01.066 - 00:38:41.014, Speaker A: The gas fee is almost equal to it. Why is that? Because of gas prices. Does this have anything to do with nexus? Is like nexus like gouging me? No, it has everything to do with what it takes to execute these transactions, and it's a reflection of the gas price being 76 Gwe. Notice if I were to change this to 20 Gwe, now I'm only paying $6.38 or zero one ether. So I have two options here. One, I could walk away from this right now and say this is actually.
00:38:41.052 - 00:38:42.966, Speaker B: Too much gas for me, even though.
00:38:42.988 - 00:39:34.066, Speaker A: I'm risking leaving ten ether without any sort of smart contract cover. I could also just lower the gas price like I've done here, set it and just wait for it to confirm. Now I run the risk of my transaction getting stuck because maybe the gas price has never come back down to 20 guay over the next day or so, and I need to do another transaction and I can't do that because these transactions run in order. I will not be able to do anything with DFI until this transaction has confirmed. A last consideration is maybe I was intending to buy more smart contract cover. Like maybe I have 50 ether of value in synthetics that I want to cover. It would probably make sense for me to push this all through in one transaction.
00:39:34.066 - 00:40:23.970, Speaker A: I don't want to do multiple transactions buying smart contract cover when I know that I'm going to pay this much gas per transaction. So in the spirit of transparency, I've rejected that quote and now I'm going to find a new quote for more cover on synthetics. That way I can make the transaction more worthwhile when I'm buying smart contract cover. So I'm going to click buy cover and then I just search synthetics. Let's go ahead and cover myself for the next 60 days. So I'm going to buy 50 ETH of COVID and I'm going to pay 7.75% as a premium.
00:40:23.970 - 00:41:25.480, Speaker A: And there's still 1010 ether of COVID available for others to buy against synthetics unless more NXM stakers come in and stake their NXM against the synthetics contract so that more of us can buy smart contract cover. All right, so there we go, 50 ETH for 60 days at zero, 63 six eight ETH. So I'm obviously paying more in terms of ether, but for me it's about peace of mind in terms of this ether that is in synthetics or the value that, let's say, is equivalent to 50 ether. So I'm going to pay for this in ether. I am agreeing that smart contract cover is not a contract of insurance. Cover is provided on a discretionary basis with nexus mutual members having the final say on which claims are paid. And since I already did the permission transaction earlier, I can just click buy cover.
00:41:25.480 - 00:42:24.274, Speaker A: Okay, I am going to put through a transaction at let's do 70 Guay according to the ETH gas station that'll get it through in less than 30 minutes. I am paying about $244 in ether to protect about $20,000 of ether in synthetics. So I'm ready to buy my smart contract cover. Let's click confirm. All right, I'm back and my transaction is confirmed. So I now have smart contract cover for synthetics, and that means that I have 50 ETH of COVID So that's the payout I will receive if a smart contract bug is discovered and the mutual members vote to approve my claim. I've paid zero point 63 six eight ether as a premium to have that.
00:42:24.312 - 00:42:27.206, Speaker B: Coverage, and I am covered for the.
00:42:27.228 - 00:43:25.918, Speaker A: Next 60 days or so through October 6. Another convenience just in the new dashboard is I can see all of my inactive covers. So these would be covers that have expired. So on October 6, this will move over to inactive covers and I'll at least continue to have record of that that is tied to my Ethereum wallet. I'm going to end this tutorial with how to own a part of Nexus Mutual, which is to hold the NXM token and put capital into the pool, which a larger capital pool ensures a healthier mutual that is able to extend more cover. And I can potentially then stake my NXM against other smart contracts here under the pooled staking then this is where I would go. I can only buy this NXM on nexusmutual.
00:43:25.918 - 00:43:47.686, Speaker A: IO there is wrapped NXM. I'm going to skip explaining that today. I can gain exposure to it, but because of the bonding curve I would much rather actually deposit my ether. Personally, I'd rather deposit my ether into Nexus mutual and gain exposure to NXM that way. But the caveat is that I have.
00:43:47.708 - 00:43:49.062, Speaker B: To go through KYC.
00:43:49.206 - 00:43:56.118, Speaker A: So those are different things that I have to weigh in terms of whether I want exposure to NXM and how I gain that and am I willing.
00:43:56.134 - 00:43:57.258, Speaker B: To go through KYC.
00:43:57.354 - 00:44:46.182, Speaker A: So let's say I'm going to buy one ether of NXM. Currently I would get 28.69. It's priced today at 00:39 ether. And again, that's based on the bonding curve. So price of NXM goes up as total funds of the mutual increase. And more specifically it has to do with the minimum capital required increasing, which is an indicator of long term growth for the mutual, meaning that the minimum capital required to assuredly pay out all claims is driving the growth of the mutual. But also aside from that, minimum capital required is the capital pool.
00:44:46.182 - 00:45:33.290, Speaker A: The money that is in the capital pool comes from folks like me who think that Nexus mutual provides a valuable service and I want to be a part of the mutual. And I can then take that NXM. And again, I can earn premiums from others that are buying smart contract cover. So today the active cover amount, or think of it again as insurance, all payouts are equivalent at this point to about 46,638 ether. You can see a breakdown too of how that fits across the different DFI applications. And then you can see that most cover expires about a year out. So clearly most are buying cover for the short term.
00:45:33.290 - 00:46:19.210, Speaker A: You can see the expiration date down here and then it mostly ends around one year out in 2021. I do not buy cover for longer durations because I'm just not sure if I'm going to move my money any sooner. Here's the cumulative premiums that have been paid, so you can see that they've been skyrocketing since May. So to me this is really promising. This means that Nexus mutual is working in conjunction with the adoption of DeFi. This means that we are seeing premiums go up and that more cover is being bought according to this as well. And that to me is a sign of something that is being done correctly.
00:46:19.550 - 00:46:22.234, Speaker B: While we're exploding with growth, we are.
00:46:22.272 - 00:47:09.170, Speaker A: Also mitigating our risk with smart contract cover. So back to Nexus mutual. If I want to buy 28.64 NxM or however much ether, if I wanted to put in, let's say two ether, I'll get double and then I just hit confirm and I would work through the same transaction as most DeFi applications. Thankfully, because I'm working with ether here, I don't have to do two transactions. I'm able to just send ether with one transaction. All right, so let's do a recap of all of the risks that I am accepting as I use Nexus mutual.
00:47:09.170 - 00:47:35.690, Speaker A: First off, there could be a smart contract bug in Nexus mutual. That's right. This is a chicken or the egg type problem. Nexus mutual itself could have a smart contract bug. That is my top concern. That's my number one worry in terms of holding a policy or holding a discretionary COVID policy with them. But also it's my concern if I'm holding NXM or exposed to NXM.
00:47:35.690 - 00:48:21.594, Speaker A: The next risk that I want to cover is the potential for my ether to be locked in Nexus. This could happen if MCR percentage goes below 100%. So today it's around 133% and 130% is the threshold for what is deemed a healthy mutual. So it's 130% over collateralized. Then if MCR percentage falls to below 100%, that means that now the capital pool is equivalent to or less than the minimum capital required to pay out all policies that would then be the equivalent of a lending pool being 100% utilized. I wouldn't be able to pull my ether out. So that's something I want to be conscious of.
00:48:21.594 - 00:49:06.086, Speaker A: That a large decrease in the capital pool, which maybe could be attributed to a bunch of smart contract bug payouts all at once. Even though that's probabilistically unlikely, it could be attributable to a panic amongst NXM holders to get out of NXM. So this really matters. And again, we're 33% above that 100% threshold where my ether is locked until the capital pool grows more. But it's something I want to be aware of if I'm holding NXM. As a policyholder, I'm less concerned. Like if I have smart contract cover, it's easier to sleep at night to know that Nexus is healthy and at 130% over collateralization or more.
00:49:06.086 - 00:50:26.402, Speaker A: But I've already paid my premium, I own my cover, and as long as the mutual continues to operate being over collateralized, I should be assured a payout. If there is a smart contract bug ever discovered in the DeFi app that I've bought cover for the next risk I want to cover is governance, and governance is ruled by voting power with NXM. So there is a core team to Nexus mutual, but it matters how much NXM you actually hold, and so you can vote on different proposals like a lot of the other decentralized finance applications. And so you can see here it changes to pricing model if we click into this. Here's an example of a proposal I could vote on, but it has everything to do with me holding NXM, and you can see that currently 61% or 62% have accepted it. My concern in terms of risk is whether someone could have an outsized amount of NXM and then end up voting for proposals that maybe are not in the best interest of Nexus mutual. However, I have been watching Nexus mutual and participating by holding cover for at least eight to nine months.
00:50:26.402 - 00:50:48.474, Speaker A: So I've witnessed how well they operate and I've seen their governance in action. So this is not something I'm personally as concerned about, but just good to be conscious of. Another risk has to do with whether my cover is to be paid out in Dai or ether. If I choose Dai, I'm accepting the.
00:50:48.512 - 00:50:51.050, Speaker B: Risk that the dai peg could fail.
00:50:51.790 - 00:51:30.854, Speaker A: Another risk would be admin rights that enable someone to make changes to Nexus mutual. I'm not aware of how they handle that, so that's something that I am blind to, and I'll hopefully be able to figure that out in the future by talking more with the team in their discord. If you ever have questions, you can go to their discord group here. They actually have it available here just to click and they always have team members in there almost 24 hours a day. Okay, that's all I've got for you today. I hope this video is helpful. I really value the trailblazing that Nexus Mutual has done to enable smart contract cover.
00:51:30.854 - 00:52:29.670, Speaker A: I recognize that there are some concessions to make in the short term in order to make Nexus mutual work. Also, there's the risks to consider that I've covered here. But at the end of the day, this to me is one of the best options to be able to protect myself against smart contract bugs in DeFi. In fact, this is the only way I know of to actively protect my assets that are deposited into DeFi applications built on Ethereum. Beyond doing my research on applications understanding whether there's an audit, trying to understand the meaning of what's in the audit, this is the one way that I can very simply go and buy protection. Thanks for watching and I'll look forward to making a follow up on how I am staking NXM against DeFi application smart contracts and essentially providing smart contract insurance for others to buy while I earn a premium from the discretionary cover that they are buying.
