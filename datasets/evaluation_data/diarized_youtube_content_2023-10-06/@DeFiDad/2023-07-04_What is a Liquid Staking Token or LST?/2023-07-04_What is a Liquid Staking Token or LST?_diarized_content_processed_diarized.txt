00:00:00.250 - 00:00:43.138, Speaker A: Sure. So an LST is a liquid staking token, and mostly talked about in the context of Ethereum. So Ethereum is a proof of stake network. If you have 32 E, you can spin up a validator. You are validating the blockchain and being paid to do so, but those assets are kind of illiquid. So these protocols allow you to deposit some of your ETH, allow someone else to run a validator for you, and they give you a receipt token that represents the ETH deposit plus the yield that they're generating. So we call those LSTs and LSTs and staking in general just got significantly derisked recently when withdrawals were enabled.
00:00:43.138 - 00:00:58.140, Speaker A: And so what we're seeing now is a lot more liquid staking projects cropping up, which is great. We love competition there. And then be a lot more of the DeFi protocols are feeling like they can safely support those assets for lending and borrowing and various other things.
