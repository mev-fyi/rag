00:00:00.250 - 00:00:26.594, Speaker A: If you think of layer one as being an island, once you finish the space, then property prices start to spike. You think of optimistic roll up as building skyscrapers. You build skyscraper, you get to 40 floors. Now you have a 40 times more space, which is great, but it's not fantastic. At some point, if that island is very desirable, like say New York or Singapore, then people will come and at some point property price will spike again. And then you don't have many things you can do. You have to start to the mall each building and build them taller.
00:00:26.594 - 00:00:49.734, Speaker A: But building above a certain height becomes exponentially more expensive itself. And so it stops scaling. It's really like a property of the system. Zk roll up instead scale like computer system. So scale like Google. If Google has a million more user by 1000 more server. If Google has 100 million more user by 100,000 more server, plus maybe a little bit for overhead, but a tiny amount and zk roll up scale in exactly the same way.
00:00:49.734 - 00:00:58.490, Speaker A: And they use hyperchain, hyperscalability. And they use a recursive zero knowledge proof to do that and really enables now the world of value to come on chain.
