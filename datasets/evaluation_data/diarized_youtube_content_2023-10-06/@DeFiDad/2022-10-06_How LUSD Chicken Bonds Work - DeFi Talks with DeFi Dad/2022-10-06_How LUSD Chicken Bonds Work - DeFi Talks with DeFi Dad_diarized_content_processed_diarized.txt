00:00:00.330 - 00:00:52.974, Speaker A: You. Hey everyone, you're watching D five talks with DFI dad. Hey, thanks for tuning in. It's Wednesday, October 5, 2022. Per usual with D five talks, we're going to get to learn about a brand new DeFi product that recently launched and from a very reputable team, I think one of the most important money Legos that was created over the last few years. So we have with us Robert Lauko, who is the founder of Liquidy, and we have longtime Defi educator, investor, builder, and now head of DeFi strategy at Liquidy, token Bryce. So guys, thanks for joining me.
00:00:52.974 - 00:00:54.240, Speaker A: How are you both doing?
00:00:54.770 - 00:01:03.070, Speaker B: Yeah, hey, thanks for having us. I'm feeling excited to talk about liquidity and also our new latest project, Chicken Bonds.
00:01:04.210 - 00:01:08.990, Speaker C: Hi. Yeah, same here. Glad to be there to talk about chicken bonds.
00:01:09.430 - 00:02:07.194, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny, before we got started, per usual, I was talking a lot to them and just kind of catching up. And yeah, it's funny because liquidy has. We're going to actually talk a bit about what is liquidy. In case you're totally new, liquidy recently got a lot of attention for being, I think, arguably one of the only, if not one of the most decentralized stable coins that's backed only by ether and why that's powerful. And then more importantly, we're going to talk about this new product called chicken bonds. And I'm going to let the guys here, of course, tell the story of what it is, the problem it solves, and how it works. So before we do that and we start to screen share a bit, would you both want to share a bit about your background? Maybe start with Robert? Just a bit about who you are and how you got started with building liquidy.
00:02:07.194 - 00:02:11.320, Speaker A: And then we can talk a bit about how Bryce joined the team as well.
00:02:11.690 - 00:02:49.198, Speaker B: Sure. So I'm Robert. I'm the founder or co founder of Liquidy. I previously worked as a researcher at the Dfinity foundation, which recently built the Internet computer. But before that I was working as a lawyer. So I have a legal background, but I always had a keen interest in everything related to computer science. I did a lot of leisure projects in my youth and then when blockchain became a thing and I was basically at the right place in the right time because I lived in the crypto valley in Switzerland.
00:02:49.198 - 00:03:13.740, Speaker B: And when I first heard about basically Vitalik coming to my hometown and establishing Ethereum there, I got fully fascinated and started doing my own research. And yeah, that's how everything got started. Two and a half years ago, I basically quit dfinity, my first job in the space to found liquidity, the interest free borrowing system.
00:03:18.430 - 00:03:19.980, Speaker C: You muted, it seems.
00:03:20.830 - 00:03:32.510, Speaker A: Oh, my bad, I was going to say. So we'll talk a little bit more about liquidity in a sec. But Bryce, share your background. I know. Like I said, you've been in DeFi since the beginning.
00:03:33.670 - 00:04:29.940, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's say I come more from the community, personal investor side of Defi. So I started a few years ago just being interested about cryptocurrencies, and quickly my interest centered around more Ethereum and what was happening with Defi back then. It was the very first day, the beginning of liquidity mining, for instance, and so it was really fascinating to follow it live. And yeah, I got involved with a few projects as the time went, and about six months ago, a little less maybe, I joined liquidity. It was just, let's say, a very good fit because I've been covering liquidity quite heavily in my content already, well before joining the team. So when I saw they published a job offer for it was head of growth back then.
00:04:29.940 - 00:05:05.440, Speaker C: I applied instantly. Turned out my job is not exactly what we pictured as head of growth. It's more, as we were saying earlier, a role of that is a bit hard to define because it's so recent, but we call it deFi strategist at liquidity, and it's essentially handling everything related to liquidity's relationship, partnership, collaboration with other protocols. So a lot of petitioning on other Daos and then things related to the liquidity strategy on liquidity's token. So, LUSD and.
00:05:06.770 - 00:05:19.998, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. So, Robert, do you want to give us the highlights of some of the innovations behind, like, basically, what differentiates it as a protocol?
00:05:20.094 - 00:05:20.738, Speaker C: And then.
00:05:20.824 - 00:05:28.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd love to. Then we can start to talk more about why chicken bonds made sense as a product to build alongside this.
00:05:29.130 - 00:06:18.150, Speaker B: Sure. So it all started when I delved a bit into the existing DeFi protocols back then, which were basically compound and maker, and I realized that they had a few issues, or at least angles that I wanted to do differently. One was the fact that they weren't as capital efficient as they could be due to their liquidation mechanism. So with liquidity, we introduced the stability pool as an instant liquidation mechanism that also allows people who are not actively monitoring the loans or the borrowers to be part of the liquidation incentive mechanism. So that was one of the innovations. And the other angle was related to the decentralization aspect. So we wanted to build a system which is fully decentralized and not just a little bit.
00:06:18.150 - 00:06:54.980, Speaker B: And we did that on every angle. Like, we only take Eser as the sole collateral type, and we made the system fully immutable and governance free, so nobody can now interfere with it. And last but not least, we also made it so that we are not running our own front end. But there is a built in incentive mechanism that encourages third parties to offer a front end or gateway to the protocol. And last but not least, the whole system is interest free. So when you take out a loan in liquidity, you would only pay a one off fee, but no recurrent fee or interest.
00:06:57.030 - 00:07:03.940, Speaker A: Either of you. Could you talk a little bit about what the stability pool is and why that's so important to the way liquidity works?
00:07:05.350 - 00:07:11.038, Speaker C: Yes, as you want. It's actually like my favorite part of liquidity.
00:07:11.134 - 00:07:11.582, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:07:11.656 - 00:08:08.694, Speaker C: Maybe I can start a new bill on top of it. Right. So it's really interesting because it's a way of supplying the capital required for liquidations and enabling anybody to partake into this activity that on maker Avi or compound, is done by liquidators that provide their own capital. So it's an interesting aspect, and essentially, it's just a pool where users can stake their LUSD and they get a set allocation of liquidity tokens, but they are also providing capital, as I was saying, for liquidation. So potentially a share of their LUSD can be converted to east. However it happens usually at a very favorable price, close to the bottom of the V, essentially, when bulk of the liquidation happens. So, yeah, it's a really cool mechanism.
00:08:08.694 - 00:08:40.370, Speaker C: Both from the US side provides an interesting way to essentially have a sort of buying option into east from your LUSD, plus making some yield. And at a protocol level, it enables faster liquidations that you would see elsewhere and more streamlined. And this is part of what enables liquidity to be more permissive in terms of loan, to value that what you will see on other protocols is simply because the liquidations are a bit more efficient.
00:08:41.190 - 00:09:10.460, Speaker A: Yeah, and liquidity has been through some major stress tests. Now, with the market crash we went through with, I think ether was down at most like 82 80. So we were able to actually see the liquidation engine under a lot of stress. Now, if you're in the stability pool with LUsd, can you remind me, I'm earning fees in ETH, or is that what it would be denominated in over time?
00:09:11.490 - 00:09:50.650, Speaker C: So you get both liquidity tokens over time, it's just a set budget shared in pro ata of your ownership of the stability pool, and then you get ease, and that's from the liquidations. That's when your LUSD are used to liquidate a trove. So it really depends of the activity. It's very spiky, as you would imagine. So most of the time the baseline is not much is happening, but then a few days, a lot is happening. Like we've seen a day with $60 million trove being liquidated. That was like one fourth of the total L USD in existence back then.
00:09:50.650 - 00:09:55.660, Speaker C: So it's like not a sport event, but then for some days, not much will happen.
00:09:56.510 - 00:11:01.674, Speaker A: This is the difference between years ago, let's say 20 17 20 18 20 19 20 18 2019, being really bloody years. In the last bear market, we would all watch as all the liquidations would happen on centralized exchanges. Now, since so much economic activity has shifted on chain to what we would all put under the umbrella as DeFi. Even on a day where market prices are down, if you're in LUSD, if you're in that stability pool, you're actually contributing to securing the protocol, ensuring that liquidations can happen. You're strengthening, I would say you're strengthening confidence in LUsd's peg and from a mathematical standpoint as well. So, yeah, it's a feel good story, I would say. And it's worth noting the yield.
00:11:01.674 - 00:11:28.890, Speaker A: This is not a recommendation or endorsement that you make any financial decisions or get into the stability pool, but worth noting it's around like 5.6% APR, so that's pretty competitive stablecoin yield to be earning, especially considering what you're exposed to, how battle tested the protocol is. Robert, anything else there to add in terms of highlights of liquidy and what it actually does as a protocol?
00:11:29.390 - 00:12:30.414, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just like the functionality of the LQTY token, which you would get as a stability depositor, continuously paid out, which is, I guess, the lion's share of the APR that you mentioned. And this token is there to capture the fee revenue. We have the borrow fee, an upfront fee, and we also have a redemption fee, which is less significant. But both of those fees, they are paid out to whoever is staking the RQTY token. So 100% of the fees goes to the RQTY stakers. Now, there is another fun angle to it, which is or the front ends, they are incentivized as well, and that works in a way that they can basically set a kickback rate, and through that kickback rate, a part of the LQTY that would normally go to the stability depositor would then be funneled to the front end, through which the stability deposits are made so by that mechanism. Sorry.
00:12:30.414 - 00:12:39.550, Speaker B: The front end operators have a vested interest to drive the turnover towards the system because they can benefit from this income.
00:12:40.850 - 00:13:02.200, Speaker A: So would either of you want to start to guide us through what are chicken bonds? And I'd like to talk a bit about what is the problem that you're solving for, what prompted you to create the product. Also at any point here, you just let me know. Happy to start to share Bryce's screen and we can use some of the visuals on the website.
00:13:02.970 - 00:13:11.502, Speaker C: Yeah, we can even share some data about liquidity if you just want to wrap up on it. We have a neat dashboard to kind of see the overview.
00:13:11.586 - 00:13:13.690, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do that. Here we go.
00:13:13.760 - 00:13:14.586, Speaker C: Let me show you.
00:13:14.688 - 00:13:17.590, Speaker A: Okay, so this is data on liquidity, the protocol.
00:13:17.750 - 00:13:53.110, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's just covering the main metrics. So for instance, you can see the LUSD supply and the number of tolls, which are quite correlated. And it kind of tells you a bit about the price history too. So back when we launched, people were still very bullish on east and the price was appreciating a lot, but then it was the beginning know bear market essentially. So you can really see it on the LUSD supply that shrink since then. You also have some metrics on the various staking API.
00:13:53.110 - 00:14:18.080, Speaker C: So the stability pool is here and same here. You can see the spikes when there are waves of spikes of liquidations, essentially. And the liquidity staking APR that is a little bit less spiky and spikes more when there is overall bullishness because most of the fee is coming from the initiation fee when people borrow some other.
00:14:19.090 - 00:14:24.126, Speaker A: Is there a chart of how much LUsD has been created over time?
00:14:24.308 - 00:14:28.370, Speaker C: Oh yeah, it's right here. The total LUSD supply.
00:14:28.790 - 00:14:32.274, Speaker A: Very cool. And how much is there today or.
00:14:32.312 - 00:14:35.038, Speaker C: As of around 170,000,000?
00:14:35.144 - 00:15:21.090, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. Yeah. And again, liquidy really has seen, I would say, a boost in interest. I'm not sure how to compare it to the height of the bull run, but what is always a good sign during a crypto bear market is there's a return to fundamentals, a flight to quality. And I think you start to appreciate again what holds up under the worst sort of stress testing. This has been a really great story to tell of arguably one of the most, if not the most decentralized stable coin designs. Guys, should we then shift over to chicken bonds?
00:15:21.830 - 00:16:30.374, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. Maybe I can start with some ideas or how I kind of came up with it and then I let breeze take over. So basically it all emerged as kind of like a side project from a bigger research that we were doing basically last year or end of last year and between new year and or between over the Christmas period. I basically had this idea that we could build a system that would allow to acquire protocol on liquidity through a novel bonding mechanism. And this protocol on liquidity could then be used for multiple purposes and also be used for stabilizing the peg. Now, for the LUSD, which has seen some issues lately, but the whole system is kind of based on a novel bonding mechanism, which. And that's where the name comes from, which always allows people who are bonded or still in a pending phase of their bond, which allows them to chicken out and take back their principles.
00:16:30.374 - 00:17:42.486, Speaker B: So it's basically an escape hatch for people who are not maybe comfortable with fully committing from the start. So what they can do is basically bond LUsd, wait some time during which they will accrue another token, the boosted LUSd or blusd. And at any point in time they can decide to what I mentioned, chicken out or what's more interesting to chicken in which basically is a conversion. So they convert or they leave the amount of LUsd they bonded to the system in return for the currently accrued amount of blusd. And of course, people would only do that if the blusd they get in return is worth more than blusd. And to achieve that, there is a bit more complicated mechanism under the hood with multiple buckets of pending bonds and other types of liquidity already acquired by the system, which makes sure that the total yield that can be captured inside this novel blusd token is higher than the base yield for the LUSD. And thanks to this yield amplification, we expect the blusd to trade above the Lusd.
00:17:42.486 - 00:18:12.970, Speaker B: So there will be like a price premium which factors in this additional yield. And this price premium, again, is the driver for bonding. Because when you bond, you basically rely on the premium. And as long as we have this premium, bonding should be attractive. And the more people bond, the higher should the premium become, which kind of creates a nice flywheel effect between bonding and just holding the blusd token, which accumulates and auto compounds the underlying yield.
00:18:13.790 - 00:19:10.294, Speaker A: I love the chicken branding behind all of this, by the way. Like day one when I looked@chickenbonds.org I was just like, I don't know if you had an artist do this or if it was one of you being a wizard and using some simple design there, but it's really fun. Would either of you then want to walk through the diagram here? I think Robert you started to tell the story of like, I'd love to kind of COVID more of what happens under the hood. Normally if I have LUSD, I might hold it as just like a stable coin, as like a medium of exchange. I might normally put it into the stability pool, but in this case, this is a new sort of like yield opportunity. And so let's assume that I'm going to create a bond myself and I would then exchange LUSD for bu l SD by creating the bond.
00:19:10.294 - 00:19:14.058, Speaker A: Or am I minting it? Is that maybe the proper term?
00:19:14.234 - 00:19:19.946, Speaker C: Not exactly. So I'm showing on the screen right now we can actually go through creation of a bond.
00:19:19.978 - 00:19:20.558, Speaker A: Oh, perfect.
00:19:20.644 - 00:19:55.130, Speaker C: There we go. So essentially what happens when you create a bond is you will get an NFT that represents your deposit. And so you can see here I have a few. I have five different eggs. And owning the NFT means you accrue blusd over time. So you see here 100 LUSD bond I created yesterday that has accrued so far about 17 b l USD. So I need to wait, obviously a bit more for it to be interesting in terms of return.
00:19:55.130 - 00:20:27.874, Speaker C: I mean, those are small amounts. So I did it more for the egg and the fun of it. But yeah, so we can create a bond if you want to kind of see the process. A cool thing too for people using the app is it implements permit. So I don't know if you see my metamask on the screen. Oh, awesome. Okay, so as you've seen on the first message, there was no aloe was a permit, so no gas.
00:20:27.874 - 00:20:29.062, Speaker C: Just signing a message.
00:20:29.196 - 00:20:30.006, Speaker A: I love that.
00:20:30.108 - 00:20:34.680, Speaker C: But then, yeah, the markets are. Gas prices a bit higher.
00:20:35.610 - 00:20:39.482, Speaker A: I was going to say they're always high when you want to do like a demo.
00:20:39.536 - 00:21:27.314, Speaker C: Exactly. Let's cross finger at 18 right now. Maybe I'll get lucky, but yeah. So when you bond, you get an egg NFT that is generated at the time of the bomb and they have different properties and kind of different rarities. So this one is the most interesting one I got on this address where, as you can see, it features a golden egg. It's really funny because one point we haven't really touched much yet, but is that the chicken bonds are essentially both a Defi protocol and a generative NFT collection. The two go hand in can, you can simply follow the activity of what's happening with the bonding by tracking the bond collection on OpenC.
00:21:27.314 - 00:22:01.300, Speaker C: So I'm showing you on the screen right now, but for instance, this guy got a nice pool. So it's a big bond of 200,000 and he got a rainbow border. You have different variations. This is just the first stage of the NFT. The NFT will get to evolve when people will chicken in and chicken out. So right now, the system is in a bootstrapping period, but then we'll start to see chickens popping up in the collection too.
00:22:02.950 - 00:22:45.810, Speaker A: Bryce, could you go back to either the diagram or the other screen? So let's pretend I've created a bond and you've actually created quite a few already. So you have all this blusd, you're earning more of it. What else would I then be considering next? I guess I have an option, of course, of chickening out and withdrawing at any point. But I'm thinking of the decision tree in my head of like, okay, am I going to stay in? How much have I earned? If I leave right now, am I losing any of my principal?
00:22:46.390 - 00:22:50.820, Speaker C: So, yeah, this is what I really like about. Oh, sorry.
00:22:51.910 - 00:22:53.202, Speaker B: Are you going to go ahead?
00:22:53.336 - 00:22:53.634, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:53.672 - 00:23:45.460, Speaker B: So I think the main consideration for you is basically what you have already accrued, the blusd amount and of course, the market price of it, which will fluctuate. And you will want to time your chicken in in a way that you can maximize your earning, which, of course, depends on the curve, like how this blusd is accrued over time because it starts very deep, as deep, and then it kind of flattens over time, so you won't accrue at the same rate over your bonding period. While on the other hand, the price of your blesd that you have been accruing will fluctuate. So you will try to estimate to be in a good place to estimate the price and then decide whether you want to chicken in now or maybe wait a bit longer and what you do next. And maybe bris can cover that once you have your.
00:23:46.810 - 00:24:22.430, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Just to add to it in terms of really, like, your question about the decision tree, what is really cool with chicken bonds is you have this scap hatch, as Robert was calling it, of the chicken out that is available essentially anytime as long as you haven't chicken in. So it's a binary decision. It's one or the other. And so it makes creating a bond pretty much risk free because at any time you can recover the full amount. So here I'm showing you on screen, this is 100 L USD bond.
00:24:22.430 - 00:24:59.210, Speaker C: If I chicken out on this one, I will recover my 100 L USD. So just as much as I put in, but I forgot what it has accumulated in B USD so far. So it's really a cool mechanism to ensure everybody can just escape if needed. Especially if you consider that those Luzd you're putting in chicken bonds might be coming from a trove. So a debt. So people might need them to repay the debt. But now, once they've waited enough for the return of the bond to be interesting, they can claim it.
00:24:59.210 - 00:25:17.390, Speaker C: And that's the exact opposite of chickening in or canceling the bond. So when you cancel the bond, you forego the BA USD to get the AUSD, and when you claim the bond or you chicken in, you forego the bonded USD to the system and you get in exchange for the BA USD.
00:25:18.950 - 00:25:40.540, Speaker A: So if I deposit 100, just like you did a moment ago, is there any scenario where I could walk away with less than 100? I can withdraw, I guess, at any point, but yeah, anything to make users aware of. Beware. You could lose a part of your principal if this happens.
00:25:41.870 - 00:26:35.978, Speaker C: So it really depends of what they do. Of course, we cannot protect them from everything, but yeah, this is where the chicken out comes into play. Whatever happens with the price of Ba USD, as long as you haven't chickened in yet, you can always chicken out and recover the full principle. And then when it comes to chicken in, you can simply wait for the pool to be live and see what happens there. And so essentially, creating a bond gives you a lot of optionality because of this chicken out. It's, it's a very efficient protection mechanism. The only cost there is to create a bond and just waiting for it to mature is the lost opportunity cost of capital, the yield you could have been making if you parked your LUSD somewhere else.
00:26:35.978 - 00:26:48.750, Speaker C: But so in that sense, it's pretty much like pulled together, where because of the chicken out, the principal is not at risk. What is at play here is the yield your principal generates.
00:26:49.890 - 00:27:34.590, Speaker B: And maybe just to go a bit more into detail, maybe if we can go back to the diagram that you showed at the beginning brief with the three buckets. I mean, that may be interesting. And going back to the question, I think you had Defi dad about how the whole system works under the hood. So what really happens when people bond is that they will be giving their yield away to the system, like pull together. So this bonding bucket, basically here on the left hand side, represents all the pending bonds, and this yield is captured and sent to the reserve bucket. So the reserve bucket earns its own yield as well as the yield from the bonding bucket. And there is also a permanent bucket, which I can maybe say a few words about later.
00:27:34.590 - 00:28:33.898, Speaker B: But this permanent bucket is also kind of sending its yield to the reserve. Now what's important to know is that the blusd token can be redeemed for a peralta share of the reserve bucket. By redeeming, I mean you can burn a share or a number of blusd tokens and you will get back a proportional share of whatever is in the reserve, like you get Lusd. And this creates a price floor. So this means that whenever the blusd price drops below the parata value of the reserve, you can make an arbitrage gain by redeeming. So this should kind of already make sure that the blusd should never fall below dlusd in price. But on top of that, the fact that the reserve kind of not just earns its own yield, but an amplified yield means that this kind of price floor will grow faster than from just the simple yield that would be generated by the reserve.
00:28:33.898 - 00:28:45.410, Speaker B: And this is this yield amplification I mentioned before, which will hopefully, or that's what we expect, lead to a nice premium on the blusd price compared to the LUSD. And this drives the whole flywheel.
00:28:47.210 - 00:29:08.060, Speaker A: And what you've done here is you created the product to, I guess, benefit the liquidity protocol to be able to bootstrap more liquidity to strengthen the LUSD peg. But this product, chicken bonds, could be used by other yield bearing tokens, right?
00:29:10.210 - 00:29:56.810, Speaker C: Yeah, that's part of the vision we had. But for now, the idea was really to first try out the mechanism with LUSd. It's quite novel on several dimensions. The bonding aspect, the NFT side. So we wanted to validate first that there was interest for such a model before thinking too heavily about how we generalize it. But yeah, of course it's part of the plan eventually, but we'll communicate more on a potential generalized version when we have more precise idea of what it is. But the vision is this, I can say, is to essentially do another tryout instance.
00:29:56.810 - 00:30:16.260, Speaker C: So the LUSD chicken bonds were a way to verify product market fit, essentially, let's say. And then we pictured for the generalized version, we will also test it with another token, and this time not a stable coin, but the LQTY token instead.
00:30:18.150 - 00:30:36.758, Speaker A: There's also a chance in the future that something like blusd, if this continues to grow in liquidity and is adopted by lots of users, that this could be another form of collateral that we could be using on a money market like Ave, right?
00:30:36.924 - 00:31:09.700, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good, because I think it really has this price floor, which kind of already gives you the maximum loan amount that you can take out. So it gives this security to the lending platform or to the lenders that you can always get out minimum value from a liquidation of this blUsd, which is, I think, a very nice property, not just that it grows, but also that you can kind of maximize your loan to value ratio based on this inherent and growing value.
00:31:11.750 - 00:31:54.610, Speaker A: So to maybe summarize this and wrap up, if I were to go to chickenbonds.org, I can find one of the front ends that support liquidy and in this case, chicken bonds. And then if I end up creating a bond, the next date that I would look to, depending on what your break even time is. But there is a rebond time that comes on November 5. And that rebond time, am I right to say, like, whether I create a bond this week or next week, November 5, is this sort of like next milestone for the protocol?
00:31:55.590 - 00:32:19.130, Speaker C: So it's the time at which the first bonders would be in a position where it's interesting for them to rebound. So rebounding is claiming the bond, claiming the blUsd, and then swapping them back to LUsd with a profit compared to the initially invested amount, and then recreating another bigger bond with this lUsd balance.
00:32:20.030 - 00:32:39.760, Speaker A: Got it. Is there any period in between the rebond and what would be like the next rebond time when folks may be claiming that blusd, I guess, is there any sort of delay before we'll know what's the next time frame? Is it another 30 days out or something like that?
00:32:41.650 - 00:33:41.060, Speaker C: Yeah. So maybe Robert can add some more specifications to this. But essentially right now, we are in a bit of a bootstrap period, as we call it, where since plUsd accrues over type and the protocol launched yesterday, right now there is simply not enough plusd to have a liquidity or anything like that. So what we have as the market price, 129 LUSD, is an informed hypothesis, let's say, based on modeling, research and so on. But it's still a bit of a virtual price because there is no liquidity pool yet. So as the weeks go by and we exit out of the bootstrap period, and the liquidity pool on curve starts to get further, we'll have an actual market price for blusd. And that would allow for a more precise idea of things like the yield amplification factors and breakeven and rebounding time.
00:33:41.060 - 00:33:41.906, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:41.928 - 00:34:49.850, Speaker B: Maybe just to add to it, is that for any given price, I mean, once we have the market price, there is this reference point the front end will kind of calculate the optimal time to and first of all, the time when you break even, and then also the optimal time to do this rebounding mechanism that Bris just explained. But this, of course, is based on the price, which will fluctuate. So the estimations will also be kind of need to be updated as the price changes, even though there is an interesting built in mechanism that tries to make it so that the optimal rebound time is around 30 days. So there is a controller that changes some of the parameters of the curve inside the system, like the speed of your B token accrual or b L USD accrual, which should kind of target this 30 days. So if bonding becomes less attractive over time, the system will try to make bonding more attractive by speeding up kind of the bond accrual speed. So we'll see how that pans out. I think this is a very interesting experiment also from a controller perspective.
00:34:50.510 - 00:35:23.410, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's really interesting because it's a bit of almost of a living thing, I want to say. So a high level way to describe it would be it's an engine to capture liquidity over time and also provide an interesting earning opportunity for LUSD holders in the process. But it goes in cycle. So right now, it was launched yesterday and it will take about a month to go through the first cycle of bounds, but then there will be many cycles after that. So it's really fascinating to see how it will evolve.
00:35:25.210 - 00:35:51.050, Speaker A: Guys, one last thing I think we haven't covered is, is there then like a curve blusd, lUsD pool? And then is there any incentives or at this point, if you were to be an LP in that, I would say an early LP in what could be a pool, that you cannot even.
00:35:51.120 - 00:36:15.490, Speaker C: Be an LP right now because of what we were saying in the bootstrap period, you cannot claim. So you simply don't have blusd. But yeah, eventually there is this pool. So it's an interesting one because it's blusd against the Lusd sweep pool. So it enables you to swap easily from blusd to Lusd, but also any token of the sweepool.
00:36:16.790 - 00:36:17.654, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:36:17.772 - 00:36:36.086, Speaker B: And this pool is powered or incentivized by a 3% chicken in fee. So that's maybe also important to say that this fee will be paid out to these LPs and will kind of also help to acquire enough like B L USD liquidity to keep the whole system liquid.
00:36:36.198 - 00:37:15.670, Speaker C: So that it's interesting because it creates another dynamic within the system where when people are chicken in, fee is captured. But directed to the LPs. So essentially when there are a lot of chicken in, there is a lot of incentives to be an LP too. So it will make for in a month from now when the bonds are mature and a lot of people are ready to chicken in. It would be an interesting time to be LP. So I think it should balance both should balance out nicely between people who are looking to claim the bond to sell for more LUSD and rebound. Those will simply exit with the profit and maybe do something else.
00:37:15.670 - 00:37:44.530, Speaker C: And those who will look more into the liquidity providing opportunities, maybe. One thing we kind of overlook to I'm realizing it now is that you can also simply buy blusd of the market and that gives you access to the yield application and everything. You don't get the NFT, sadly, it's only if you bought. But still. But of course buying of the market is much more dependent of what is the market price at the time of your purchase.
00:37:45.670 - 00:38:19.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm trying to think if I held a bunch of blusd and I needed my lUsd back, maybe like the markets are crashing, I need to pay back my trove, which is, in case anyone doesn't know, it's kind of like a CDP in maker or a vault in maker. I'm trying to think why would I sell it on the market versus chicken out? What's the factors there that I would consider?
00:38:19.344 - 00:38:52.934, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's another part that would be the redemption. So I mean when you just own the blusd you are entitled to redeem them for LUSD. But given the premium through the yield amplification, we expect that the actual market price would never or very rarely drop below the value that you would get upon a redemption. So you don't really want to redeem because by selling it on the secondary market you would usually get a higher price. So that's for blusd owners. Chicken out is for the sense.
00:38:53.052 - 00:39:17.470, Speaker A: Makes sense, yeah. No, this is a really interesting new opportunity in Defi. I'm excited to play with this myself. So this interview was more for selfish intentions. I was joking with you earlier today that I just really wanted to learn more about this myself. Guys, anything else that you think we haven't covered?
00:39:18.530 - 00:39:57.066, Speaker B: Well, maybe just the point that we have this kind of built in mechanism for shifting the funds. Because under the hood, whatever is in those three pockets can be, or at least a part of it can be shifted between liquidity's own stability pool and the curve pool of the LUSD token. And this would happen in a smart way. So this would happen in a way that kind of drives the price back to peg. So that's also the reason why we built it, because we wanted to have an additional layer of stability on top of the current LUSD or liquidity protocol. But Bris, you wanted to say something else?
00:39:57.248 - 00:40:52.910, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I was pretty much about to talk of the same topic. So the impact longer term of chicken bonds on the curve pool that as you can see right now is a bit unbalanced. But thanks to the shifting function, essentially as long as LUSD is over peg, anyone would be able to redirect the permanent bucket to the curve pool. It should also prove interesting to contribute to the yield application of the system because this curve LP position will also be producing a yield. And one long story short, because we're really at the end. But there is a massive boost coming to the incentives of the curve LUSD three pool pool because there was a bribing campaign. And tomorrow the new round of gold reward on curve starts.
00:40:54.210 - 00:41:02.430, Speaker A: Nice. Could you zoom in on the split between blusd and lusd on that one pool?
00:41:03.570 - 00:41:12.178, Speaker C: No. So this is LUSD three CRV pool again, the BLV pool is created but it cannot be funded yet because there's no.
00:41:12.264 - 00:41:17.222, Speaker A: That's right. Not until. Not until November 5 then.
00:41:17.276 - 00:41:17.446, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:17.468 - 00:41:18.790, Speaker A: That's when we should see.
00:41:18.940 - 00:41:56.382, Speaker C: No, a bit earlier because people will already be able to chicken in earlier if they want. But yeah, the cool thing too is during that period the whole yield of the system because all three buckets are making yield and it's all redirected to the reserve. And the reserve also gets funded when people chicken in. So as the permanent bucket. But since right now they cannot chicken in, everything is impending. But there is already a bit of LUsd balance occurring in the reserve. That's a yield redirected by the pending bucket.
00:41:56.382 - 00:42:06.470, Speaker C: So this first harvest was yesterday, 90 ad USD. But today's harvest, or I don't know exactly what the frequency is when it's relevant, should be a bit bigger.
00:42:07.930 - 00:42:25.980, Speaker A: And those terms that we're using there, chicken out, we could replace with withdraw, withdraw early. Is that appropriate? And then when we say chicken in, maybe like restake or claim and redeposit, is that fair?
00:42:29.150 - 00:43:01.842, Speaker C: Yeah. Console and claim I think are clearer if chicken in and chicken out are a bit confusing for you. But I guess really the main idea is first that both are mutually exclusive. So it's a choice either or. Now as time goes, it becomes more interesting to claim because you're accuring blusd over time. And so it becomes increasingly more costly essentially to cancel even if there is no cost to cancel. But if I cancel a bond I created yesterday, today I've just lost one day of opportunity cost of capital.
00:43:01.842 - 00:43:26.190, Speaker C: If I cancel the same bond 25 days from now, I've now lost 25 days of opportunity cost of capital, 25 days of yield I could have had if I parked my LUSD somewhere else. So it's really an escape hatch offering a protection. But if you're looking for a return, that's the way of the claim bond. And then doing something with your Ba dusd.
00:43:28.210 - 00:44:00.700, Speaker A: Makes sense. And while none of this is financial advice or recommendation or endorsement to make any sort of investment decision, I personally learn a lot more by just putting some money in. So whether I put in ten LUSd, I create a bond or actually remind me the minimum, is it 100? There we go. So I would put in, let's say in my world, I would put in 100. And then that will help me to learn through experience.
00:44:01.150 - 00:44:34.530, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And you can do it when you have a five gray gas period, essentially. And because of what we were saying earlier of the permit, it won't cost you too much. You only have one takes to sign to be able to create a bond. And we're talking about blUsd. But just to finish on a funny note that happened just a few hours ago, the bond NFT you can transfer, you can sell. And we actually saw the first resale of an NFT today.
00:44:34.530 - 00:44:58.154, Speaker C: So it was this egg, the bond number 100 with about 330 LUSD in there that sold for six east. So a nice premium. We're not exactly sure of what was the reason for this guy paying such a premium. Maybe he really wanted number 100. Maybe he's not clear about the system yet. Who knows? But still interesting to see it happens.
00:44:58.352 - 00:45:15.890, Speaker B: And in general, I would recommend or anybody who looks into this, I mean it wouldn't put you like the whole amount in one bond. It always makes more sense to kind of have multiple smaller ones just to be able to react and split your funds.
00:45:16.310 - 00:45:55.998, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean we see different strategies with the depositors. Quite a few people are splitting the bond indeed, because essentially the max excise is obtained starting at 100K. So you'll see people splitting the bond quite often to get a bit more flexibility in their choice. But we also have seen some quite massive bonds. I'm trying to find one. But yeah, there is this one, for instance. And with 500,000 led in there because of the weight generation work, we can see some really cool things happening.
00:45:55.998 - 00:46:05.620, Speaker C: So the biggest bond of the platform is in a rainbow egg right now. I can't remember the ID, but if I can find it, I will show it to you.
00:46:07.750 - 00:46:28.940, Speaker A: Yeah, really interesting use of NFTs here, the fact that you've got that NFT because it's a unique position. But I do love just the creativity that's gone into this. They're fun to look at. Maybe some of these will take off as a profile pick eventually in the future.
00:46:29.630 - 00:46:50.766, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, those eggs are the most basic stage of the NFT, when people will chicken in and chicken out the NFT, they have evolved, but this part is not live yet. It will be live when the bootstrap period is over. But, yeah, I think we have some rendering of how the egg can evolve over here to give you a bit.
00:46:50.788 - 00:47:01.730, Speaker A: Of an idea that is really cool. I didn't realize that they're evolving. You were saying? So they change over time the longer you hold that.
00:47:01.880 - 00:47:11.960, Speaker C: No, not over time. They change in a one time process when you chicken in or chicken out, essentially your NFT evolve. Cool.
00:47:13.290 - 00:47:34.574, Speaker A: Yeah. Like I said, it's just a really fun brand and reminder to everyone. Then if you want to check this out and learn more about it, you can go to chickenbonds.org. Guys, if they had questions and wanted to interact more with the community, they should go to the liquidy discord, right?
00:47:34.692 - 00:47:43.614, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. We have a chicken bond section now in our discord to chat about everything related to chicken bonds. So, yeah, they can join here. Very cool.
00:47:43.732 - 00:48:12.150, Speaker A: And I don't have the link up here, but that would be liquidy liquity.org. That's another great resource to learn more about. And then they've got all the front ends listed there for liquidy as well. And then just quick reminder, too, that you can follow both Robert and, man, have I been mispronouncing your name. I keep saying Bryce, like the ultimate american burger. Do you pronounce it brief?
00:48:12.990 - 00:48:15.914, Speaker C: I take both. That's it.
00:48:15.952 - 00:48:54.550, Speaker A: Okay, so I've lived up to being the burger in the house today, but yes. So thanks so much, guys, for taking the time to talk me through all of this. I think it's a really ideal sort of defi product to have launched in this market. This is a market where we're all looking for stablecoin based yields. There's some interesting opportunities coming there once folks are claiming blusd with the curve pools as well. And, yeah, I guess I'll leave you with the last word. Anything else either of you wanted to share, say before we go?
00:48:54.700 - 00:49:42.600, Speaker C: Yeah, before we wrap up, I just realized on the NFT, I forgot to mention this part. But for those who are interested in trying out the chicken bonds, there will be also some on chain activities that will be checked. So when you get your chicken in NFT, the one you see on the right here, it can gain additional attributes depending on what you have done on chain. And we look for three main activities, which are having a trove open on liquidity, owning or staking liquidity, and then voting for the curve LUSD swiss pool with VCRV tokens. So any of those three actions will give you additional attributes on your chicken in NFT. So if you want to try the app, that's also one thing to consider.
00:49:43.290 - 00:49:45.560, Speaker A: Really cool, very clever stuff.
00:49:46.490 - 00:50:10.160, Speaker B: If you want to be a part of this big experiment or game of chicken, I think this is a good chance to check it out. We'll see how it evolves. It will be just fun to see all the reactions in the market, how they would price it. And with that, I think it was a great interview. Thank you so much for having us.
00:50:11.250 - 00:50:47.690, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us around. Sorry to add one more thing, but I realized I forgot it's also an interesting case because the curveball I mentioned, we are bribing regularly with just bribes on Wadden. But so essentially right now, you get a kind of a double bribe where you get a regular token bribe, but also an NFT based bribe, essentially, where if you do this, you will get additional attributes on your chicken in NFT. So I don't think that has been ever tried before, and I'm kind of curious to see if it will have a serious impact on the voters behavior.
00:50:48.270 - 00:51:47.370, Speaker A: Yeah, no, a lot of experimentation in terms of keeping the community engaged and incentivized. This is really fun. At the end of the day, I'm looking at it as a game and I am interested to see just how quickly this can actually grow. But guys, again, my pleasure to have you on. I'm such a fan of what has been built with liquidy. I think this is a really interesting next generation product, another example of a rich product that gets created because we have a very reliable lower stack protocol that is liquidy. And so this is, to me, what's going to really propel us into, God willing, whenever that next bull market comes, I think we're going to see some really interesting applications because we already have liquidy, we already have Aave, we already have maker and so on and uniswap and curve.
00:51:47.370 - 00:52:20.920, Speaker A: So this is kind of the next generation of experimentation. And then just reminder to everyone, too. If you enjoyed this, you can subscribe@defydad.com. I would really encourage you go to lens tube and you can follow this interview and watch any other interview now on lens tube, which is web three media powered by lens protocol. And yeah, just trying to dog food, really what I think is the future there of web three media. But otherwise, I'll end the broadcast here. And just like I said, thanks again for your time, guys.
00:52:21.850 - 00:52:23.320, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:52:24.490 - 00:52:25.620, Speaker A: Bye, everyone. Take care.
