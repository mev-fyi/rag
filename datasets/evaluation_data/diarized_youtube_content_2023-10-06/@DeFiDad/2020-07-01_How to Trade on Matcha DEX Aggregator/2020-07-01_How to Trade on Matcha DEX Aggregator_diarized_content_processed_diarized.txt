00:00:26.910 - 00:01:28.266, Speaker A: Hi everyone. This is Defi dad, and this is going to be a short video tutorial on how to navigate the new matcha Dex. So Matcha is a Dex aggregator that was created by the Zero X team. It is meant to allow you to get the best rates and the least amount of slippage and be able to, of course, trade while maintaining custody of your assets on Ethereum. One thing to note here is a Dex aggregator is what one inch exchange is, it's what Dex AG is and what Paraswap is. So I think many of us are using these tools already, and probably what's most unique about matcha is just the fact that it has a very pretty user interface and we'll kind of like walk through some of it here and give you a sense of what's different. So first thing is I go to matcha xyZ, and when you get to the page, just the usual thing.
00:01:28.266 - 00:02:00.962, Speaker A: You're going to connect your wallet. So I'll connect Metamask. If you use any sort of wallet, connect wallet, coinbase wallet or bitsky, you can connect it there. And then next up, I'll just search a pair here. If you search any asset, it'll give you some common pairings. But again, this is a swap, just like uniswap, or what you see on like one inch exchange. You can trade between any asset as long as it's a digital asset on Ethereum.
00:02:00.962 - 00:02:38.270, Speaker A: So I'll choose this. First thing I noticed is it really does look a lot like Robinhood. I believe that someone on the team was quoted saying to the block that they are trying to be like the Robin Hood of crypto. And no doubt about it, they're trying to create a really pretty experience for trading. You'll notice here on the right hand side, this is really all that matters to me. I have a market order, so I'm going to pay whatever the market price is. And in this case, let's pretend that I start with die and that I'm going to buy ETH.
00:02:38.270 - 00:03:33.730, Speaker A: And so if I put in that I'm going to buy ten die worth of ETH. Here's how much I'm going to get. Different than that, though, I could put in a limit order. So one thing you'll notice here is I'm currently trading between Die and ETH. But what really happens on matcha is you are trading with wrapped ether, or weath, which is an ERC 20 token. So, long story short, if you were to come into this and try to place this order, it just lets you know that BTWs you're going to receive weath instead of ETH, which isn't a problem because you can actually convert at any point between weath and ETH on this Dex, and it's one to one. And so it's an easy way to switch back and forth.
00:03:33.730 - 00:04:30.600, Speaker A: The reason that wrapped ether or weath exists is that you can't do quite a bit with ether, the native token versus weath, which is an ERC 20 token. And so this is something that often happens in the background of lots of different DFI apps that folks use. You just don't realize it. So anyways, they're just really transparent about the fact that you are in fact receiving weath. And if you were to exit from matcha or just walk away with your wallet per usual, if you need ETH back instead of weath, you can go back and forth here between the two. Okay, the other thing is actually, let's go back and make that weath again. As long as I am trading with weath and not ETH, I am able to place a limit order.
00:04:30.600 - 00:05:16.686, Speaker A: And that's cool because a limit order allows me to get a better price or the best price possible. And so instead of me just buying ten die worth of ether and paying however much that is, I could say that I'd like to buy at 200 die or lower or better. And this order can run until I cancel it. Or you've got other choices here. You can let it run for a day, three days or seven days. So that's cool. It's another option that we often use in stock trading apps like Robinhood, but we also like to use that in centralized exchanges like a coinbase.
00:05:16.686 - 00:05:59.358, Speaker A: And so this is great. It's a really easy to understand order form. So I'm going to buy with ten die at a price of 200 die or better, or in this case that would be lower and the order just will not expire. And I'll get in this case I'll end up getting 0.5 wrapped ether. So if I go to review the limit order, first thing I have to do, the first of two steps I have to do here is approve permission to move my dai. And so this is a really common step in all defi applications or all ethereum applications.
00:05:59.358 - 00:06:35.722, Speaker A: So let's go here and check what the gas price is and I'm checking ethgastation info on my phone and it looks like it'll go through if it's as low as 24.2. So I'll put in how about 28 way cool. So I'm going to save a little bit of money as opposed to what I was going to pay originally. Just, I think, like, $0.20 there. The other thing is, I'm going to change the permission. I like to set custom spend limits.
00:06:35.722 - 00:07:23.500, Speaker A: Sometimes this creates issues for me if I set the limit too low, but I think it's a good practice to not give unlimited approval. All right, so let's make it, in this case, ten die. All right, that's it. So we've got the lowest gas price set, and then I've also got permission to move ten die. So this is my first time seeing this, and this is really nice. I like a timer and just little animations like this to let me know what's going on. Let's see if it actually works.
00:07:23.500 - 00:08:04.454, Speaker A: By the way, forgive me for I sound like I'm whispering because my kids are asleep in the other room. So little bit of a lack of enthusiasm tonight, but it's mostly me just trying not to wake up my children. All right, so what's happened here? Let's view the transaction. All right, cool. So we still got some time. One thing I did notice is that the application suggested that guay price Gwei. It suggested that I put it up as high as 41 guay.
00:08:04.454 - 00:08:37.970, Speaker A: That would have pushed through the transaction in probably less than 30 seconds. That would be putting my gas price up as high as possible. That's fine. That obviously creates, like, a better experience here where it pushes through immediately. But since I'm used to using these applications, I have no problem waiting. So we'll come back to this in just a bit. But if you prefer to not wait, you can obviously just pay that extra few cents that I skipped on, and the transaction should push through much faster.
00:08:37.970 - 00:09:25.060, Speaker A: So my approval transaction for moving my die in my wallet has gone through, and now I can place the limit order. So we're going to pay ten die for zero five. We. That would be if the price is at 200 die or better. And then I think one of the awesome things right now about matcha is that there is no fee. So they've said that for now, there are no trading fees. My expectation is that there will be a fee in the future.
00:09:25.060 - 00:10:03.778, Speaker A: This tends to be something that Defi teams, or just crypto exchanges in general do this to get folks to start using the platform and get accustomed to it and build brand loyalty. So that may come back to us in the future with a fee. All right, so I'm placing my limit order, and this is the last transaction where I should have to pay. Oh, and that's good. Actually, I don't have to pay anything right now, so. Cool. Good to know.
00:10:03.778 - 00:10:45.702, Speaker A: So I'm just signing the transaction and then it looks like we have prepared the trade limit order has been placed. That's it. All right. And then if I click that new trade button, obviously I could continue to place more of these limit orders. I am interested to know how do I cancel that? So let's check. I'm going to go back to where I originally placed this order. There we go.
00:10:45.702 - 00:11:13.070, Speaker A: Cool. Sorry, I just had to scroll down a bit. There it is. Open orders. Let's check something else here. If we were looking at buying, let's pretend that we are looking at a different swap here. So now I would be paying and die, and I would be getting SNX.
00:11:13.070 - 00:11:41.160, Speaker A: All right. And there's no order showing here. So what I have to do is I have to know that I have placed an order using die in weath. Otherwise I could lose track of it. Right now, I don't see another place where I can see all of my open orders. Let's go back to the home page. Don't see anything here.
00:11:41.160 - 00:12:20.500, Speaker A: Let's see. Go to account page again. I don't see anywhere else that would show me any of my open orders. Orders that haven't been filled. But they are limit orders that would fill. And so let's go look at weath die again. Okay, so I should see my order show up here below.
00:12:20.500 - 00:12:55.322, Speaker A: There we go. So there's my open orders that have not been filled. And I'm going to go ahead and cancel this just because I want to see what that looks like. All right. And so for me to cancel, let's see what Metamask asks me to do. Okay, yeah, this makes sense. So when I placed the approval to move my die, I paid a certain amount of gas.
00:12:55.322 - 00:13:38.060, Speaker A: This would be now actually canceling the order. So now you can't move my die. And so if I confirm that the order is dead, I think I will leave this for now then, just to see what happens. But cool, good to know. And yeah, just please be aware that the only way I would have known this is just by noting or remembering that I had placed a limit order. Otherwise, I'm not sure how I would be alerted about this. One thing that could come up in the future is the Ethereum push notification service, which has been building.
00:13:38.060 - 00:14:23.256, Speaker A: Those are the folks that could potentially work with like a matcha. And then you could receive push notifications through their application when something like a limit order hits. That's one of the ideas behind the Ethereum push notification service. They're decentralized push notifications that can be connected to your Ethereum wallet, which I think is really cool. I would love to use that here in this case. So when I'm using this and I think about the risks involved, there's a few first off, there's always a smart contract bug risk. It can be mitigated with audits.
00:14:23.256 - 00:15:14.744, Speaker A: You'll notice that on Macha's FAQ site they have trail of bits and consensus diligence. Having audited it, you can check out the results there. I'm not a smart contract auditor, so I'm not going to read this and pretend that I feel any safer using the application. This is new. I just am very mindful of the fact that when something's new there could be bugs still, and even though I'm in control of my assets again, I wouldn't want to be using an application that has bugs. So just something I'm conscious of and not going to start trading absolutely everything on this when I might be using other dexes. Another thing is the fact that I am using some stable coins.
00:15:14.744 - 00:16:20.250, Speaker A: This has less to do with Matcha, but more to do with the fact that if I have exposure to stable coins and I'm using those on matcha, if the dollar peg were to fail on any of these stable coins ever, that would be pretty disastrous for me and anyone else holding those stablecoins. That would make trading very difficult. The last thing is, I'm not aware of what sort of admin key risk there is here, but I do always assume that with newer defi applications that there is likely some admin key that allows them to maybe shut down the decks if something disastrous were discovered. So anyways, that's something else. Hopefully someone will be able to share more information on that. But for right now I'm going to assume that there's some admin key that the team is in control of. The last thing I want to cover before I go is whether or not I'm getting the best rate on matcha.
00:16:20.250 - 00:17:22.480, Speaker A: I'm not suggesting that I must get the best rate in order to use matcha. Obviously it's a really pretty interface to use, and there's no doubt that some folks will use it just because of that. However, for me, I want to get the best rates and the least slippage possible. And I don't have a way here to look at order book depth, but I could compare quotes for let's pretend that I'm willing to pay 10,000 die to buy as much wheat as possible. And so I would get 44.92 wheat or ETH. In this case, if we go to one inch, let's see what happens when I put in 10,000 die and see how much we can get.
00:17:22.480 - 00:17:55.110, Speaker A: So I'd get 44.919 and in this case 10,000, I would get 44.946. So here's an example where I'm actually getting a better rate on matcha. So that's good. Let's move it up to 100,000. So now I'm getting 447.7, 118.
00:17:55.110 - 00:18:46.380, Speaker A: And by the way, these quotes are going to change constantly, like, just depending on all the trades going on and the liquidity across all the different pools that one inch and matcha source from. Okay, so in this case, I'm getting 447.849. So I am getting more for my money. In this example, I don't have 100,000 die and I have 582 die in this wallet. But if I had 100,000 die, I could buy 447.5 ether or weath. And this is 447.88.
00:18:46.380 - 00:19:22.930, Speaker A: So just a bit more there. I mean, almost like one ETH. And the quotes are constantly changing here. But let's check one more. Actually, let's use USDC instead. So if I were to buy with 10,000 USDC, I could get 44.25, we on one inch and here, let's do USDC.
00:19:22.930 - 00:20:01.680, Speaker A: So I would get 44.31 wheat and here I would get 44.25. So on matcha, I'm getting more bang for my buck. Let's add another zero. If I were to spend 100,000 USDC, how much wheat do I get? 441.91. And on matcha, I get 442.57 here.
00:20:01.680 - 00:20:47.310, Speaker A: So let's see, 442.57. What? Versus 441.91. So, yeah, just a little bit more bang for my buck there on a matcha. So this isn't the most scientific way to go about testing where I'm going to get the best rate, but it's cool so far, it's split pretty evenly there. Earlier, I was playing around with this and I was actually finding that one inch had better rates, almost like nine out of ten times. But that was a few hours ago when I was playing with it, and now I'm seeing it more evenly split, so who knows? All right, so that's all I've got for you today. I hope this is helpful.
00:20:47.310 - 00:21:41.454, Speaker A: I'm excited that there's now another Dex aggregator available and that it's got such like a pretty interface to use. It definitely reminds me a lot of Robinhood. I've used Robinhood before for trading stocks and this definitely should resonate with someone who's less of a crypto native. And yeah, anytime you can make for a prettier tool, I think that's good, just because it might attract more new folks to try trading on Dexs versus using centralized exchanges. And I think the thing I like the most here is I think the limit order works really well. It clearly reminds me here of Robin Hood. They state here's what you're paying, here's the price.
00:21:41.454 - 00:22:19.020, Speaker A: So in this case I would be paying 1.98 or 1.98 USDC per SNX. And then when does it expire? And you can place limit orders to basically never expire in this case. So that's cool. The one downfall of this is I'd love to see all of my open, unfulfilled limit orders in one place, because right now I have to keep track of any limit orders I placed on this platform. Otherwise I won't know when they've executed or if they're still open.
00:22:19.020 - 00:22:32.880, Speaker A: So anyways, I hope this is helpful and let me know if you have any questions or comments in the YouTube video, or also you can reach me through Twitter on any of the post. Just comment with questions and I'd love to help.
