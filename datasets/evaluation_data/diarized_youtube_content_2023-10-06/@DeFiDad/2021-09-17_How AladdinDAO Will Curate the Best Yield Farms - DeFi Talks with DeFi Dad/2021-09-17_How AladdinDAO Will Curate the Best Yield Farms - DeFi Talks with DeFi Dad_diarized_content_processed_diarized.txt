00:00:00.250 - 00:00:49.334, Speaker A: Th, all right, I think we are live. So, hey, everyone, it is Thursday, September 16, 2021. This is DFI talks with DFI dad. I am joined today by Sherilyn Wu, who is a core contributor of Aladdin Dow. We're going to talk about this new protocol in Dow, which really has this mission of helping anyone, whether you're a new or old yield farmer, to find what are the best yields, but what are the best risk adjusted potential returns and really what is the longest, most sustainable yields available. So that's the mission of the Dow. It just recently launched.
00:00:49.334 - 00:00:58.000, Speaker A: There's also a liquidity mining program we'll talk about, but otherwise, yeah. Sherilyn, welcome to the show. How are you doing? Thanks for joining me.
00:00:58.370 - 00:01:01.920, Speaker B: Hi, and thanks for having.
00:01:05.010 - 00:01:32.650, Speaker A: We have, of course, we're talking several minutes here before we get started, the usual thing. So then I come out and pretend like we haven't spoken to each other. But Sherilyn, why don't we start with the obvious about your background. You've been in crypto for a long time. You've been contributing long before this. So, yeah, can you talk about how did you get into crypto and then maybe a little bit about what got you interested in Defi?
00:01:34.270 - 00:02:58.046, Speaker B: So I actually come from traditional finance. So I started my career as investment banker with UBS, and then I moved on to leading fintech and blockchain investment with China Merchant bank. So for people who don't know, it's like the JPMorgan in China. And then I moved into crypto, dropped into the rabbit hole, and just since then, and then I was chief investment officer for leading asian crypto exchange. Think about how to change how finance works and asset management works is question I've been thinking over many years. So I started to dedicate all my time to build Aladdin DA since early this year. And luckily we form a great team and we have got bunch of supporters from a number of core contributors, from investors and also the developers and many community members and help us to build a lot in Dao.
00:02:58.046 - 00:02:59.460, Speaker B: And here we are.
00:03:00.170 - 00:03:20.880, Speaker A: Yeah. So I tried to summarize it, but let's talk about what's the problem that Aladdin Dao is trying to solve. I guess. What was the problem that you saw in the DeFi landscape that said to you, okay, there's something here that we can do to help fix that.
00:03:21.330 - 00:04:25.802, Speaker B: Yeah, I think DeFi has experienced tremendous growth, and this growth has also generated a lot of junk. So from where I sit, I have come across so many investors, investors, local investors, institutions who are new to the space, they just have no idea where to start and what to do. So I think there is a lot of noises in the space and it's really bad information asymmetry out there. And so allowing that to help better structure that information and try to separate signals from noises and help the broader community to optimize Isaac locations and also provide better support, liquidity and community support to the good project really create value for DeFi in general.
00:04:25.876 - 00:05:23.426, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to show it off here, but the end result of all of the effort in Aladdin Dow is you end up having a dashboard with maybe like who knows how many in the future, but let's say ten or twelve of the best yield farms. Full disclosure, I am clearly involved in Aladdin Dow. I am helping to curate and find these farms. The reason that it resonated with me when you originally reached out to me was I spend so much time trying to help with this information asymmetry. I'm trying to tweet daily about new farms that I'll find. I'm writing tutorials in a lot of different places like the Defiant, and then obviously we're doing live streams and creating custom video tutorials, but I can't keep up with it. I'm obviously not like I'm just one person.
00:05:23.426 - 00:06:33.290, Speaker A: There's lots of other people in the community doing this as well. So this is interesting because you're basically bringing together and incentivizing a community that is tokenized to help find the best farms and then provide that information free of charge, put it up on a dashboard, let folks be able to see what those potential yields are and decide for themselves, of course, make their own financial decisions, because none of this is investment advice. So reminder, if you see a farm on Aladdin Dow, obviously that doesn't mean that we are advising you to put your money in it. But our goal as the Aladdin Dow community is to help you identify what are potentially places that might be earning higher yield. That's longer term in terms of the opportunity, something that's not going to be fleeting, like we're not going to be seeing farms go up that last three days. We're looking for stuff that lasts weeks and months, potentially. And then, of course looking for farms that are battle tested, audited, arguably and provably safer than other farms.
00:06:33.290 - 00:07:14.070, Speaker A: What separates, though, I guess, how do you think about this, Sherilyn? What separates Aladdin Dow from other investment dows or even yield aggregators? Someone this week was asking me, isn't this thing just like and I'm like, no, we might show urine farms eventually on the Aladdin Dow dashboard, but the goal is not to compete at all with a yearn. We're not coming up with novel strategies. So anyways, how do you think about the difference between Aladdin Dow and what already exists?
00:07:14.410 - 00:08:02.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's very different. It comes from Aladdin philosophy. We are a bunch of long term thinkers, including you, if I dad. So when we come to liquidity mining, so we fundamentally think that farming assets with most growth potential is much better strategy than just farming down. So Aladdin dump mechanism design is actually to incentivize pool members to select quality assets with most promising growth potential and can run on sustainable basis. And so if you see us as a fund, our strategy is actually lonely a lot in the actually farm and hold. That's the key difference.
00:08:02.198 - 00:08:54.294, Speaker B: And also it's decentralized decision making. So we all know there's no benefits for centralized decision making. It's very efficient. But there's obvious merit for decentralized decision making as well. Just given how multidisciplinary and the nature of crypto investment and everything runs on global scale. We bring people from all different background with different expertise and perspective together. So collectively we get to see, potentially we get to see all the opportunities in the market and have the capability to assess all the opportunities from all possible angles and help projects to build a truly global community as well.
00:08:54.294 - 00:09:34.590, Speaker B: So it's a very different platform from yield aggregator. We are actually farm aggregator. And I think just to answer the second question you asked, how Aladdin Dao is different from the other investment in the market. I think there are many wonderful investment dow in the market like meta tell the law. They have a wonderful group of professionals, people and investing together. I think Aladdin Dao takes on a very different vision. So we are a group of people who have the know how and the capabilities across the different perspectives and metrics.
00:09:34.590 - 00:10:20.100, Speaker B: We not only want to invest it for ourselves, we actually want to serve broader community. So we help to structure the information in the space and to provide these curation services across yield farms, and to help the community to minimize information asymmetry and help the community to optimize asset allocations overall. And besides, we aim to gain fight as well. So we have the, they actually compete with each other under this game theoretical mechanism to select the best asset possible.
00:10:20.630 - 00:10:33.058, Speaker A: Yeah, so the boule, which is like ancient greek term, you can imagine, eventually we'll have 30 members in total, is that it? Sherwin?
00:10:33.154 - 00:10:41.946, Speaker B: About 30 plus running for the bull and we're going to kick off the election. I think we probably will come down.
00:10:42.128 - 00:11:38.842, Speaker A: Yeah. So you've got Aladdin Dow where everyone is in discord and able to contribute in some manner, but there is this elected position where you are working with 30, 40 other folks and the goal is to identify these best farms. Again, the goal is for these to be longer term opportunities, which I think is really a big differentiator. Amidst all the fleeting opportunities that will last for a few days in Defi and then you as a researcher, curator, those people are incentivized because they're earning, we'll call it like a performance fee. And so you want to put up farms that earn for a longer time and earn more yield for Aladdin Dow members. But then at the same time, and we can now talk through this. Here we go.
00:11:38.842 - 00:12:09.526, Speaker A: So at Aladdin club, this is the website and I'm going to actually hop over to go ahead and hop to the actual app here. So I'm going to click the start button in the middle there. But I just put in the URL and here we go. Just make sure everybody can see this. Okay? Yes. Here we go. So the Lendao app, this is where you would ultimately see in the future maybe ten or twelve farms could be.
00:12:09.526 - 00:13:01.302, Speaker A: In this case we've only got four to start. And the idea then is that someone can quickly find great opportunities to participate in. Now what you see here, if we look at like, let's say oops, if we look at just the curve ren WBTC vault, in this case, this is no different than something you would zap into on Zapper, whether you would enter it through curves application. And so this is potentially value already that the community can gain from the Dow. I mean you could just pop in, see the farms and I mean go do your thing. But there is an incentive then to participate through Aladdin Dow. So if I have already added liquidity to that pool, I can stake it here.
00:13:01.302 - 00:14:00.602, Speaker A: In this example with the curve renwbTC pool, now I'm earning the curve governance token. I'm also earning the usual trading fees, but then I can hop over to the staking tab here. So those were the vaults, which there were four of. Now we've got the opportunity to stake that Ald curve ren WBTC token. So long story short, I am earning in this case, if we go back to this, these are the estimated apYs that one earns by participating in Aladdin Dow. Because you're earning the Aladdin Ald token, which is our native governance token and ultimately gives you a voice in future upgrades and proposals in the Aladdin Dow. So I mean, anyways, you can take a look, depending on what assets someone holds, then you can start to think about whether any of these opportunities make sense to you.
00:14:00.602 - 00:15:08.142, Speaker A: But that's the incentive on the farming side. And then again, we talked about the performance fee for those that are curating and researching to find these farms and put these up. Sherilyn, what else are we missing here on the app? Is there anything else to call out in terms of how this works? Another thing I left out there, this is a four week program that just kicked off the liquidity mining program, right? So that is right now there's higher yields on these because there's more of the token being distributed to those who are early participants and supporters of this. Liquidity mining will continue after that four week mark. It's just that per usual, less of the token will be rewarded for those participating and then the yield rewards will decrease by 20% each year thereafter. So typical sort of inflation rate decreases over time. But yeah.
00:15:08.142 - 00:15:12.000, Speaker A: Anything else here Sherilyn, to call out on the application side?
00:15:12.950 - 00:16:12.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we try to be the platform for one stop liquidity mining for all defi users. So not everyone is pigeon, not everyone is sophisticated venture investor. So you have a bunch of really smart defi bitcoins work for you tirelessly. And most importantly, their incentive is totally tied up with how much profit they can generate for allowing users for long term. Hopefully this can help many people solve the problem they get into defi. And if let people get rug pulled because of what we do at Aladdin Dow, I think that will make all the efforts worthwhile.
00:16:12.870 - 00:17:26.470, Speaker A: Yeah, and also just to point out some of the traction so far. So this program started about a week ago. There's a little over 700 million in total value locked, I'd say, having been very active the last several weeks with others that are helping to curate these farms. Man, if you want to interact with some of the smartest people, and I would say more like some of the best experts, I have learned so much in these discord meetings, YouTube live streams, just general meetings with others. In Aladdin, Dow, Sherilyn and other core contributors have worked very hard to recruit some of the most active defi yield farmers. So for what it's worth, I've gotten off multiple calls and said, Holy cow. I had never met VFAT for example, who's an anonymous contributor who has helped so many people to understand the yields in all the different farms available in DeFi.
00:17:26.470 - 00:17:54.842, Speaker A: And he was one person in particular that really stuck out that I was able to learn quite a bit from. So end of day, if you want to learn about DeFi, if you want to learn about new yields, if you want to learn about new trends, this is a really enthusiastic group of people to get to know Sherilyn, I guess. Shoot, I think we just about covered everything. Is there anything else you think folks should know about Aladdin Dow?
00:17:55.006 - 00:18:21.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the community should check up the research meetings we have and all these brilliant bull candidates and presentations and participating in liquidity mining. And we will kick off the bull election process on 24 September. So vote for the bull candidates you like. Vote the people who you want to allocate this capital.
00:18:21.810 - 00:19:09.306, Speaker A: Yeah, the candidates that are participating, the candidates that would like to be a part of this elected group that's curating farms for that dashboard. There's been a lot that's going on behind the scenes. We've been live streaming research meetings and just showing off the type of thinking, I think that different individuals would bring to the Dow. So anyways, it's been a great experience for me. And just reminder, this is purely for informational purposes. Please do not take any of this as like an endorsement or recommendation to buy the Aladdin token or any tokens mentioned in this live stream. But anyways, I hope folks can take advantage of this.
00:19:09.306 - 00:19:38.422, Speaker A: And like I said, get to learn more about Defi. Sherlyn, thanks for joining. I guess remind them to follow Aladdin Dao on Twitter. Follow you as well on Twitter. And then yeah, there's the link to Aladdin Dow, which is just Aladdin club that also has a link to the discord if you want to get involved in the community. And then if you enjoyed this, of course you can subscribe@defiedad.com. But Sherilyn, thanks so much.
00:19:38.422 - 00:19:41.560, Speaker A: And yeah, any last words before we go.
00:19:44.090 - 00:19:50.982, Speaker B: And join us at Disco and with the community. And thank you so much for having me.
00:19:51.116 - 00:20:18.302, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, thanks for joining, everyone. I think I'll be back next week with a new interview. And if you're looking for a new tutorial, I just posted one on Smart Alpha by Barnbridge, which is a product that lets you pull risk and express your view of the market whether you're bearish or bullish. So check that out@defydad.com. Sharon, I'm just going to end the broadcast. We'll be in a virtual room in just a sec.
00:20:18.302 - 00:20:20.060, Speaker A: So bye, everyone. Thanks so much.
