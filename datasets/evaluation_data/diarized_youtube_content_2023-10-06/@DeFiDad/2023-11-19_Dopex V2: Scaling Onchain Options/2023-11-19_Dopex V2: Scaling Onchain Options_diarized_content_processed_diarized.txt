00:00:00.330 - 00:00:18.190, Speaker A: This is what exciting about the current DeFi space is. There is a lot of things that can be done and will be done, and if we build a solid product with solid basis, we will be able to be a part of it and to help make the DeFi go further.
00:00:20.770 - 00:01:14.066, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad here with nomadic from four RC be.

00:02:32.550 - 00:03:16.502, Speaker C: Everybody at this point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your staked ETH mint, a liquid staking token and then use that token in deFi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, oracle networks, other blockchains and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH in Defi.
00:03:16.502 - 00:03:41.694, Speaker C: We are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with liquid restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards, restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:03:41.822 - 00:03:47.480, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:03:49.530 - 00:04:31.170, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain uX. Redesigned from the ground up. The first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadap's powerful custom defi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:31.590 - 00:04:55.418, Speaker B: All right, so let's introduce Boss LMP, who is an anonymous advisor to Dopex. Boss worked previously in tradfi on risk management, interest rate derivatives, FX investment banking, and on options in a fintech. He has been a CFA charter holder, a Defi trader, an investor, and an advisor now for three years. So boss, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:55.504 - 00:04:58.746, Speaker A: I'm great. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.
00:04:58.848 - 00:05:54.878, Speaker B: I think it's fair to say that Dopex was a Darlene of DeFi near the end of the last bull run, and that sort of carried us into the bear market. It was one of the more innovative products. I think there was a general consensus that what Dopex was bringing to market was a new primitive in the options sector, and so that was exciting. But we've all lived through a pretty brutal crypto bear market. It seems like now we're coming out of that, and we're seeing new interest in the markets. And so as we start to grow as a Defi sector again, you start to imagine all of these primitives, whether they're new or redesigned, coming together to create a richer, more matured DFI space. And so dopexv two seems to be a promising component to this story.
00:05:54.878 - 00:06:24.898, Speaker B: And so hopefully today we can kind of break down. Really, what do you need to know to discern? Should I be using Dope XP two? And if I should, how can I benefit from using it as a DFI investor? But, boss, why don't we kick off with a little bit more about your background? You are an anonymous contributor advisor, but anything else you'd be willing to share about what got you into crypto and then maybe more. So why you've dedicated yourself to working on Dopex?
00:06:24.994 - 00:07:00.866, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So my story with crypto, actually beginning with a rug, an era rug. So in 2013, I bought my first half, bitcoin, and it was a coworker who introduced me to it. We became good friends just when I started working in investment banking. So I followed a bit of the crypto. I bought the first stop in 2013, and then I held for a few months, and this coworker actually asked me for my BTC because he was running algo trading and he needed some more funds. So I pretty much trusted him.
00:07:00.866 - 00:07:29.014, Speaker A: I gave him the BTC and for a few months, then he quit the job and we stayed in contact, et cetera. And once I wanted to get my BTC back, I asked for him. He said, sure, I'm running my elgo a couple of weeks and you will get it. And then he, then he went abroad and never heard of him again. So that was my first leg in 2013. Then I came back to crypto in end of 2020. Sorry to defy.
00:07:29.014 - 00:08:06.502, Speaker A: Actually, I came back to when cake was launched, I did some LP. I started very small because at the time, after COVID, I was trading a lot of options on equities, and I was also interested by cryptos, but I didn't do the whole ICO. But Defi really attracted me. So I started by lping with my background. I wanted to understand a little more. We ended up actually writing a paper about impermanent loss in my fintech. So we had this software that, for options, was optimizing gamma, doing like it was optimizing risk management, for example.
00:08:06.502 - 00:09:01.762, Speaker A: And we looked at an application because we have some of the LPs, et cetera, they had gamma too. And we were looking at application of this software. So we actually studied modeled environment lot and application the software in a cool paper, and that sparked my interest. I ended up going more djen, going into the blockchain, seeing the project, getting in that technical and financial level, applying risk management, identifying the good opportunities like crypto as a whole. And the project works a lot like an economy, so you can apply some economic, economic basis for investment also in some projects, like inflation, et cetera. So, yeah, I had a lot of fun with crypto, and I fell in love with it. I quit my job, went full time crypto.
00:09:01.762 - 00:09:26.494, Speaker A: I did advisor. I wasn't advisor for some protocol. Sometimes it was just people came ask me for opinion, and I give it, that's all. And sometimes it was more deep like topics. I ended up contributing for a few months in germs Dow. I was an option strategist there. We were deploying around ten to 15 million CVL in early 2022 for a few months, and then I joined Dopex.
00:09:26.494 - 00:09:54.890, Speaker A: I was an investor in dopex in the public sale in June 2021. I've been using the products from the start. I've known the team, and it made sense to join them with my option expertise and to help them build those products, et cetera. So I have a long history with Dopex, even if I've been working for a few months there, but I know the whole history, and I had friends who worked there. That's actually how I was close with the team and know them, and I ended up joining that.
00:09:54.960 - 00:10:52.650, Speaker B: I am fascinated by the profile or makeup of investors like you who were early to bitcoin and experienced some sort of, let's call it a rug pull here, where you interacted with someone else. You were looking to use some sort of like a service that catered to what was really the only true digital asset at that time, bitcoin. And so you know firsthand just why the permissionless and trustless nature of DeFi is so important, like being able to basically just trust a protocol versus having to trust individuals. But, yeah, that's a story I think we've all heard actually more than once, which is sad to say, that your buddy disappeared internationally. So I'm wondering, you've never been able to track this guy down?
00:10:52.800 - 00:11:06.670, Speaker A: No, honestly. Then Bitcoin went to. I bought it at around one K, and then it went to 300. Or I bought zero five BTC. So far it's 500. It went to 300 or 200. And remember, it was $100.
00:11:06.670 - 00:11:34.694, Speaker A: Like, didn't matter to go and say some more around the world, et cetera. Just bite back. It was simpler than go. But I did, like, for few weeks, I will continue to see him, and I was like, yeah, hey, I have some problem, et cetera. And then he completely, like, he moved on, and I never heard of him again. And I kind of trusted him because he is the one who introduced me to bitcoin, and we entered that job at the same time. So we're hanging out the net, having lunches every day, et cetera.
00:11:34.694 - 00:11:42.086, Speaker A: So I really didn't expect that, but it's okay. I made it up all by.
00:11:42.208 - 00:11:51.098, Speaker E: Maybe if your friend or your old friend is listening to this podcast, they'll have a change of heart and track you down there, boss, hopefully.
00:11:51.194 - 00:11:58.830, Speaker B: Vitalik, just return the bitcoin. My God. Like, you've got enough, sir, please just return the bitcoin.
00:11:58.910 - 00:12:42.010, Speaker E: Boss. I want to get into just kind of the options space in general before we dive into dopex more properly here. I think myself and everybody in crypto have been calling for options to really take off and kind of like how the derivative space in tradfi is just massive. And people have been projecting that activity on chain for quite a while. We've seen perps really start to have product market fit, but I think there's some evidence that options are starting to catch on. But I would kind of love your take on maybe just, like, what's been inhibiting some of that traction that we all think is coming eventually.
00:12:42.170 - 00:13:04.534, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think it comes from two points, mainly. So the first point, when you compare it against perps, perps are pretty simple to understand and to grasp, to start to use, and even like to master in a way, because of their linear payoff. How it works. It's straightforward. It's related directly to the fault. People can take as much leverage easily, and it's really simple to understand.
00:13:04.534 - 00:13:25.642, Speaker A: Options are more complicated. You have a maturity, you have a strike. It depends on the volatility. You tend to mismanage risk, tend to lose everything pretty fast, et cetera. So there is this difference in complexity where perps can be really used by newcomers very easily. They understand that they use it. Options is a bit more complicated.
00:13:25.642 - 00:14:11.690, Speaker A: When they start reading about them, they don't grasp it really well. Use a lot of options. The complication is not theory. It's practice, too. I've studied options in school, then in the CFA, too, and then it really took me sometimes trading to understand, really, how it works, the different parameters, et cetera. First step is the complexity second step is the unchained, in my opinion, had major flaws, which is the capital efficiency. Like as market makers mix weren't interested in on chain because you needed to send one call, for example, you needed one ETH.
00:14:11.690 - 00:15:18.900, Speaker A: So the return on investment is very low compared to the risk you need. So we didn't have, since everything was made bulletproof, we needed the full collateralization. We needed to mature on that whole building of options on chain. And that's why I think when the bear market came, options kind of died on chain, because less liquidity, that capital efficiency aspect, all the activity was on a centralized exchange derivative having 90% of the volume, even if it's lowering a bit now. CME for the future options and buybit, which is catching up a bit. And I think DeFi option on chain summer is coming, because we could be really competitors to centralized exchange if we implement that capital efficiency, if we leverage wrong security. And there is an aspect that for me is really incredible on centralized exchange right now, is the fees we pay.
00:15:18.900 - 00:15:35.298, Speaker A: The fees are so high that DeFi can come and can smash those fees and get a lot of volume if they implement the capital efficiency, the portfolio margin and the security aspects, and they're ready to scale.
00:15:35.394 - 00:16:32.234, Speaker B: Well said. I remember as Dopex and other options protocols were launching, yeah, there was an early recognition, despite all the excitement about Dopex V one, that capital efficiency had not scaled, and that it was just going to be an uphill battle with the likes of derabit and other centralized exchanges. But that said, I'm really excited about the opportunity you called out with the ability to smash those fees that are so prevalent on centralized exchanges. Maybe then, boss, this is a good time for us to start to talk about Dopex V one. I'm thinking that it would be helpful for you to give some high level context for what was working well in Dopex V one, and then what wasn't working well and prompted you all to go back to the drawing board for Dopex V two.
00:16:32.352 - 00:17:03.118, Speaker A: All right, so it depends on the time period. Like I said, early on, we had our SSOV, so single staking options vault. So the SSOV were pretty simple in design. So how it works, you come, you deposit an asset, you will get some incentives, and people will come. Like for a nippoc, an epoch was one week or one month. People come, they will buy options against your assets, and they will pay you premium. Those options had to expire at maturity.
00:17:03.118 - 00:17:37.130, Speaker A: You could not sell them earlier. And that's also for selling one option, you needed to be phone collateral. So if you're selling a put, you needed to have all the money cash secured. If you're selling a call, you needed to have the asset to deposit the asset. That worked well for some time when there was liquidity, but as soon as liquidity dried up, we have seen every CVL getting crushed. Options buyer eventually moved to the centralized exchange. We had other products, so we kept drilling.
00:17:37.130 - 00:18:19.318, Speaker A: We had perks to ignore liquidation using options that worked pretty well. We had trademarks to bet on volatility. So it doesn't matter where the price will go, if it moves or not from current price, we'll make money. That had a certain success earlier this year. We had scalps that were designed for short term high leverage with minimal cost, with no funding. So that launched in, I believe in around April or March, April. And then when the liquidity started to drying up again, and we had also zero day, which was kind of spread.
00:18:19.318 - 00:19:12.030, Speaker A: So you could, like, you buy an option and you sell an option. I won't get too much into detail, but yeah, zero day spread, that will 24 hours. Way to get also a lot of leverage if you bet on liquidity, either to the upside or to the downside. Those last projects didn't work well, I think, because the liquidity wasn't capital efficient, so we need full liquidity. So the LP had to take too much risk, and from the buying side, we had less volume on chain, and I think it was fragmented. You see, we had so many products, straddles, zero day scalps, but with its own liquidity. And overall, the usage fluctuated.
00:19:12.030 - 00:19:23.054, Speaker A: I think if we were to merge all those products and have one liquidity that will be used much more for the tree, it would have been better. Yeah.
00:19:23.092 - 00:20:07.706, Speaker E: Thanks for that recap. I think we should go ahead and get into V two. Now. Just the other day, the dopex team released a paper called Dopex V Two, a new era in onchain options. And there's a lot of stuff to break down in that paper, but I think we should kind of walk through each component. So the three main pieces, I guess, of V two that will be introduced pretty soon are clam options, amm, and then a revised version of RDPX V two. So maybe, boss, could you kind of dive into those one by one? Let's start out with the clam, maybe break that down to our listeners.
00:20:07.818 - 00:20:40.460, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. It'd be my pleasure. So I think before starting into clam, we should do some kind of like, revisit a bit uniswap v three really quick. To get a feel of how clam is built, why clam is built, and why it's a good product, let's just talk about uniswap v three really quick. So when you deposit uniswap in a range, let's say one point nine K, one point seven k. So where is one point eight k? One point eight k. Two k.
00:20:40.460 - 00:21:00.330, Speaker A: Now let's keep it more tight. So 1.9K. So around here to 1.8K around here. So here, you deposit in a range. You will divide your range into a bunch of ticks, as you see in the screen. So the tick is usually around $2 width.
00:21:00.330 - 00:21:43.194, Speaker A: So it will be divided in a bunch of ticks. So how those ticks work, it depends on the current price. So here you see the current price is here, 1865. So above it to the left, you would have only e in the ticks. Below it, you would have only USDC in the ticks. So if the price were to move to like, let's say here, so to $20 to the upside, all the ticks between here and here will be converted from east to USDC. So what does it mean? Buyers came in the markets, they took the east from you, and they gave you USDC.
00:21:43.194 - 00:22:41.374, Speaker A: So your whole ticks have been converted from east to USDC. If we go to the downside now, if the price moves one dollars, $20 to 1845, what does that mean? Means people gave you east and got the USBC. So now on your ticks, the current price is 1845. Now, on your ticks from 1865 to 1845 have owned it in them. So here, like I said, for example, we come, we deposit in this one is 1900 tick. So if we come and deposit E in this tick, 1900, the price is 1865. If the price moves above 1900, we'll be selling ETH at that ETH that we deposited, one ETH at 1.9k
00:22:41.374 - 00:23:13.838, Speaker A: will be converted to USDC. Okay, so now this is how the uniswap liquidity works. Now let's get back to options. So, options, what is a call option? The call option is the right to buy an asset at a certain price at a certain date. So, for example, a call on ETH at 1.9k will give me the right to buy ETH at 1.9k. Let's say it expires tomorrow.
00:23:13.838 - 00:23:40.242, Speaker A: Will give me the right tomorrow to buy ETH at 1.9k. Even if ETH is at three K, I can buy it at 1.9k. If ETH is at two k. I buy it at, sell it right away. So I buy it at, sell it at two k, I make $100. So let's get back really quick to this. If I deploy with liquidity at the 1.9k
00:23:40.242 - 00:24:18.270, Speaker A: tick and ETH goes to two k, it slightly solves ETH at 1.9k right now and it's at two k. So what we do in DotX is we're going to take this tick, this liquidity that is deposited at 1.9k, we're going to remove it from Uniswap and we're going to say it's like an option. Why is it like an option? Because if the current price goes to two k, for example, we have one e because we removed it. The one ETH was not converted to USDC when the price went above 1.9k. We have the one e.
00:24:18.270 - 00:24:48.902, Speaker A: So if someone bought from us a call option, it goes to two k, he can exercise it, we will give him $100 above the we will give back one point nine k to the option seller. So the option seller, it's like he deposited in Univ. Three. The option buyer is like he bought an option. So we replicate exactly with the tick. We replicate exactly the payoff of the call option. It's 100% replication.
00:24:48.902 - 00:25:28.790, Speaker A: The payoff is the same. There is no risk to manage. We make the option center. So the Univ three LP, we make him happy because we got him premium and the option buyer got his payoff, his PNL and everyone is happy. So this is for one tick. But what is really great about clam is let's say the price is at 1865. The price will stay in a certain range here for a few ticks around the current price.
00:25:28.790 - 00:26:11.486, Speaker A: If I have a big range of liquidity like 1901 700, I'm going to be only using six ticks or five ticks or seven ticks during the day, or even a little bit more if there is volatility. But I have plenty of ticks that will get no fees for a mini swap. They will be inactive. And the magic of Claire is we'll be able to use those ticks to sell options against it. So if utilization is high, we will optimize the yield of Univ. Three. If utilization is low, we will give if there is no option buyer, you will still have your LPs in Nev.
00:26:11.486 - 00:26:54.090, Speaker A: Three getting the fees. If it's used, you will get premium, the option premium. And so if utilization is high, on average, you will have more premium for more ticks than the active ticks during the day that your regular Nev three will get fees from. So we optimize the liquidity in the clam by selling options against your whole range. And you won't get only the fees from the active range during the day. You will get premium for all the ticks that are used for options, plus any tick that is not sold as an option, you will get the regular Univ 3ft.
00:26:54.170 - 00:27:16.280, Speaker E: Yeah, that is super interesting. So if I were to kind of replay some of that back to you, I guess from like a user perspective and kind of like if I'm a Univ. Three LP, I'm looking at this as like utilizing clam. The lowest I could get is my Univ. Three LP position, but even if.
00:27:18.170 - 00:27:18.438, Speaker A: I.
00:27:18.444 - 00:27:43.206, Speaker E: Guess it utilizes liquidity, even like outside the range. So essentially your floor is your univ. Three LP position. But what clam allows is even greater yield holds because the clam is using that liquidity as well. On the option side, does that make sense? How would you explain that? Kind of from the user perspective?
00:27:43.338 - 00:28:27.434, Speaker A: Yeah. So from the user perspective, the floor is not necessarily the univ. Three fees because the univ. Three fees depends on the volume. So if we look really quick here, you can see here, this is like, I think for, yeah, if you see lately here in November and in October, this is like a cam zoom, but this is from 19 October or like, let's say from September, you can see here the volume is pretty low. You would have some spikes in volume for some days where you have a lot of volume, but it will go down really quick. So on average, by using clan, you would have more premium than EV three fees.
00:28:27.434 - 00:29:41.320, Speaker A: But if you have a day with a lot of volume, though obviously that can happen, you may have more fees from miniv three because you have way more volume. But on average, since we have more ticks that will be used to sell options than the active ticks, getting mini v three fees and the premium usually matches the fees or is sometimes higher than the fees, depends on the volume. Again, we are looking at sometimes getting twice the amount of fees as premium for a range, or sometimes even three or four times more. Sometimes it will be a little less, but on average we'll make consistently more premium from fees. So if you are an LP that is looking long term and it's not looking at one day, it's looking at ten days, at 20 days, at 30 days on average, you will make more money lping with us because you will have high retrialization for out of range liquidity, you will have more ticks that are active back to premium, else you will sometimes make even more per active tick than the fee you will get from unib three.
00:29:41.690 - 00:30:06.382, Speaker E: Yeah, if you're a Univ. Three LP, this is awesome for you. I'm curious if you're having any conversations with, I guess some of the bigger univ. Three LPs. Are you seeing excitement? Have any of them tried the testnet? Anything you can kind of share on that front? Because I think if I'm a big univ. Three LP, I'm pretty excited about this.
00:30:06.516 - 00:30:54.106, Speaker A: Yeah, so the MPP, no one really used it because we were the one providing liquidity and people were able to only buy options because at that point we didn't finish the security review, et cetera, for being comfortable to people depositing liquidity. We don't want to risk any liquidity, but we have for example a partnership with orange finance which is delta natural vault built on top of free NIv. Three. We are in talks with market makers to use to deposit into clam. They like the concept a lot and we will reach out to more and more. We are in discussion too, but I can't give a name right now but we will on talk with those Univ. Three project that builds want on top of Univ.
00:30:54.106 - 00:31:11.234, Speaker A: Three to build on top of us. And this is like we can use any type of graphic traded liquidity. It doesn't have to be necessary. Univ. Three it can be camel v. Three, it can be switchy v. Three it can be later cake v.
00:31:11.234 - 00:31:47.162, Speaker A: Three, et cetera. So any concentrated liquidity with maybe some adjustment for the more complex decks, but any concentrated liquidity we will be able to integrate into clam later on. And I think this product is really great for people that use Univ. Three to own the protocol and they are seeing the value. Every time I have a discussion with an Univ. Three background or some market makers or et cetera, they're really excited about the project. They see the value and it has great market fit because it optimize a current payoff.
00:31:47.162 - 00:32:06.262, Speaker A: Your benchmark is Univ. Three. It's not necessarily stables or assets that you sell against options like in an et cetera. This is tailored for optimizing Univ. Three and getting the must of it while keeping the same behavior. Exactly.
00:32:06.396 - 00:32:34.858, Speaker B: Who do you envision to be the ideal users for this? Like if you are a uniswap v. Three LP, then you probably would be interested in X anyways. Can you call out some of the characteristics or some of the qualifying traits of those that might be most interested in using the clam.
00:32:34.954 - 00:33:28.746, Speaker A: Yeah, for me there is two groups. There is the active and peers that have strategies built with Univt and they manage it outside, for example, the delta natural with an edge on ave or et cetera, those type of projects that aim to give passive yield to people, superior passive yield to people. So those big projects, and I think, which can be interesting since we optimize Univ. Three, you have all those active strategies that are built on top of Univ. Three. For example, I've been running for a while in a strategy where I will deposit in Univ. Three and I will buy options to handle my risk and my impermanent loss, long term options with lower like theta, et cetera.
00:33:28.746 - 00:34:10.838, Speaker A: And they will argue the difference of volatility between options and volume. So this is an example of strategy that all the active stayer that we are using in EV three in a way, or in some way, can be interested into lping and even buying options from Dopix. So depositing in certain range, buying option in a certain range, or even buying options on different platforms on different maturities, et cetera. So there is for me like two types, the passive and the active will be interested by this and anyone that just want to deposit in EBITDA.
00:34:10.934 - 00:34:25.346, Speaker E: So boss with the clam, what is the timeline for that? And I guess I'm curious how you intend to kind of incentivize early users. Like how do you draw in that liquidity to a net new product like this?
00:34:25.448 - 00:35:03.130, Speaker A: That's a really good question. So thanks to arbitrarium, we got around 1.5 million from stip. We'll be using around I think 400K for clam to incentivize. Clam for free assets will be incentivizing ETH USDC, RBSDC and BTC USDC. So people that will deposit their LP, Univ. Three LP with us, they will get the fees from the swap fees, they will get the premium from selling the option when their NP is in line, and they will get on top incentives.
00:35:03.130 - 00:36:27.186, Speaker A: So it will be a very high APR for three months. We expect really great APR. It could reach, it depends on the TVL, of course, but it could be up to 40, 50 or even higher on some assets just for depositing. Inevitably, NPs, I think that's a great way to bootstrap the market to get some users to get people to LP and to see, even without the incentives, they're getting a lot of return from the premium, from the fees and they will learn to use the product and we will attract also the option buyers that will see and that will use the product since there is liquidity and a lot of people depositing, they're going to talk about it and personally I will buy options on clam because I think the volatility will be very good. I think it's good to bet on the volatility is back in the market. You can see ETH, you can see BTC, you can see Arab, it's moving a lot daily, so you can make profit buying those options or like short dated options and we'll have deep liquidity. So those big players that want to buy 1000 options, 2000 options, they will have the liquidity to do so and they will have the ability to exercise their options and they will have the ability to deposit for a good APR.
00:36:27.186 - 00:36:48.810, Speaker A: So I think we can attract a lot of people with this bootstrap phase and voltary nature like we will have numbers to show APR for the premium, for the fees, how much you can earn and with that we'll convince more and more people to come and to have the sticky liquidity in arbitrary boss.
00:36:48.890 - 00:36:56.180, Speaker B: Are there any shortcomings that you would call out to this new design or are there any drawbacks to.
00:36:57.910 - 00:36:58.466, Speaker A: The way.
00:36:58.488 - 00:37:00.366, Speaker B: That the clam is designed?
00:37:00.478 - 00:38:54.518, Speaker A: I think the major drawback for me from clam is how it's designed. It's a pool based mechanic so people like we will pool all people deposit and if they get used 100%, people may not withdraw their liquidity until the option is settled this is the case for the next few months but we are already working on a solution where we will target a certain neutralization so for example, what was mentioned, if all the options are bought, people can't withdraw the liquidity because the liquidity is needed to settle and to pay the option buyers but in the future we can after this TRP for this TRp, it's not a problem. People are paid so much with the urban center, so with the premium that they will accept to be locked because the APR would be super high in the future, what we will do is we will target a certain utilization like for example, it's done with ave when you have 100% utilization, your interest rate will skyrocket so it will not be interesting for people to choose all the liquidity or to borrow we will attract some liquidity to deposit. So here what we will potentially do is we will find a way to capitalization or to make the premium go really high so the utilization can never go to 100% and people will be always able to withdraw. And if they withdraw, we will have incentives, then we'll have premium that will be giving to other people and to make them incentivized to deposit liquidity. So all those aspects, we are aware of some shortcomings on how we designed Clem, et cetera, but those are worked on. And our goal with clam is to have to iterate on it and to make it really the best product it could be.
00:38:54.518 - 00:39:19.130, Speaker A: So this is kind of the V one, of the V two, but we will iterate on it and we will make informed decision with the databack decisions and make it even better than it is right now. But as a product right now, even with the shortfall, it stays great products. And that is interesting for people that are aligned with Univ. Three long term.
00:39:19.210 - 00:39:50.198, Speaker B: Can you remind us what expiry dates would we have available with these future options through the clam? And then anything to predict, I guess, which assets will be supported. I can imagine, of course ETH will, but curious if there's any other tokens or crypto assets that are going to be launched with the clam to start.
00:39:50.284 - 00:40:30.258, Speaker A: All right, so right now the clam will be up to 24, like the max maturity will be 24 hours, but we can imagine in the near future going to one week and to one month. Personally, I prefer those longer. As an option trader, I prefer those longer maturities. But we will get there. We will just launch with 24 hours. And I think the market will be there, but we will gradually move into those longer maturities, especially with the ethnic that will come on nature. And what markets? The three first markets will be EUSDC, RB USDC and BTC USDC.
00:40:30.258 - 00:41:04.522, Speaker A: But since we have been on top of Univ. Three, we can deploy markets really fast on any assets. So we can imagine integrating more assets in the future. But really for the stip, we want to focus on the most liquid markets and really get the people interest and then scale. We have been in talk with some protocol to have their tokens potentially in the clam. I cannot say more right now, but that's also an option. And like I said, we can easily expand to any token.
00:41:04.522 - 00:41:10.526, Speaker A: That is the mini V three on any chain. So there is no limitation, et cetera.
00:41:10.638 - 00:42:22.406, Speaker B: I think that's what I'm most excited about. Of all the detail you've shared, it kind of reminds me nomadic, kind of reminds me of infinity pools building perps on Univ three liquidity. So now we can imagine that dopex V Two will not only support these major blue chip tokens, which I would focus all of those ARB incentives and all of the attention of the protocol on those major assets. But it's very exciting to imagine that there could be a more permissionless path to listing options markets for long tail assets, which mirrors, I think, the joys of using Uniswap, V one, V two and V three, that ability to start a liquidity pool for any token you want. You just have to be brave enough to put the liquidity in there yourself. Am I capturing the essence of that, though? Am I right to say is that the future for Dopex? This could really open up the floodgates to offering more exotic options than what we would have seen previously?
00:42:22.518 - 00:43:07.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if you want to build complex, structured product, you need to begin simple, you need to have a service. Proclam is one of those bases. Auction Amm is the other base. And then you can iterate, have structured vault products on top, integrate different elements, et cetera. And so if your components are versatile enough and complete enough and robust enough, you can build anything. Like all the financial products we are seeing in the stratify, they started really simple and then they got more and more complicated. They use some aspects of every product, et cetera.
00:43:07.394 - 00:43:54.966, Speaker A: And they really built up into being like tailored products, stricturious products, et cetera. And I think we can potentially enable people to build on top of us and to add even their own magic to it and to iterate more. And we will help them grow, we'll provide them support and if they need some features we are ready to develop for them. I think this is what exciting about the current DeFi space is. There is a lot of things that can be done and will be done. And if we build a solid product with solid basis, we will be able to be a part of it and to help make the Defi go further and the derivative space.
00:43:55.068 - 00:44:28.242, Speaker E: Yeah, totally agree. And just to call out, I think your approach to the ArB incentive grant is spot on. Launching a new product into those grants is just, I think, a really smart approach and kind of like the best way to use that free gift from Arbitrum. So couldn't be better timing, really. Let's get into the option amm and maybe how that works, obviously, and how that plays off the clam as well.
00:44:28.376 - 00:45:04.534, Speaker A: So the option amm is targeted around the capital efficiency I was mentioning earlier. And there is one aspect in the clam that I didn't talk about until now, because I wanted to talk about with it in the option is the capital efficiency. So, with the option, amm, people will be able not only to buy option, but only to sell options. If you want to sell an option in clam, you just deposit and you don't know when your option is going to get bought. So you don't control those parameters. You just provide liquidity passively in the option. Amm, it's designed for active traders.
00:45:04.534 - 00:45:45.722, Speaker A: So I want to sell an option right now at this price, at this volatility, and I want to do it right now. So they want to control their payoff. They want to do more complex option strategies that involve buying and selling options at the same time. So those have like they want to arb volatility, they want to get directional buy debts with a certain risk, et cetera. So they want to be able to set options without having to deposit any b three. So they want just to have a margin like portfolio margin, like it's on derivative, like it's buybit, like Binance. When you do perps, you have a margin you want to take.
00:45:45.722 - 00:46:27.394, Speaker A: When you open a certain per position, a certain percent of your margin will be used. This is like that. They would have a portfolio margin, they send an option, we would calculate what capital requirement they have, and they will have to have it in their margin portfolio. If it goes below the required collateral, their option will be liquidated and someone else will take their obligation instead of them. They will have liquidity fees, et cetera, liquidity penalties. But we can get into that later. So they'll be able to sell options and to buy options to construct complex strategies, and they will be able to edge their delta.
00:46:27.394 - 00:47:12.738, Speaker A: For example, if they want similar to what is done in buybit on derivative, they want to edge their delta with a perp. They would be able to do it and to reduce their margin requirements by doing that. Because you know, when you buy and sell options, you have certain risk, that is in term of the Greeks, in term of delta, gamma, Vega, et cetera. So we have a certain, let's keep it simple. You have a certain risk exposure, and if you buy or sell ETH with perps, if you short or long, you can reduce that risk overall. And if you reduce your overall risk, you need less margin because you have less risk. If you increase your risk, you will need more margin because you have more risk.
00:47:12.738 - 00:48:25.920, Speaker A: So the optinim will be tailored for those more advanced traders that will want to deploy a lot of strategies, complex strategies, and more sophisticated than the clam. It will be built on top of clam, some of the liquidity will be used from clam, but the selling part and the portfolio margin part will be on top, will be different for Clem, and we'll be handling it. And I think the option AMm is really nice because for an exchange, for an open exchange, you want to attract volume. So you want to attract those that will buy and sell and match them together. So if there is someone that comes and that buys the 200 call and sell the 3000 calls, and there is someone else who comes who does the reverse, sell the 2000 call and buy the 3000 call. Like our net risk exposure as an exchange of topics will be zero, but we'll be getting fees from both people. So this is a way also to onboard market makers that want to provide, that want to buy options, that want to sell options.
00:48:25.920 - 00:49:27.570, Speaker A: It enhances the liquidity of clam, it enhances the liquidity of dopex. It will be relying a bit on clam, but the clam, but relying also on those option maker market makers, on those option traders, different traders, et cetera. They provide liquidity from option Amm. And that will potentially help and support to bring more liquidity at a different level, potentially at a longer maturities that are not really adequate for clam. And we will be also like something I wanted to mention with regard to efficiency for clam depositor later on. I think when the option NM comes, we will enable borrowing against your deposit for more capital efficiency and for yield optimization. So you deposit your univ three into clam, you can potentially borrow against it and your asset you deposit, let's say if you deposit ETH, USDC and LP, it's synthetic to borrowing against ETH.
00:49:27.570 - 00:49:37.826, Speaker A: Because if the price go down, it will be all converted to ETH. And it's like as safe as borrowing against ETH. And we will open that capital efficiency also on clam.
00:49:37.938 - 00:50:49.370, Speaker E: That last part is really interesting. I know that it doesn't sound like that'll be something that's launching right away, but this idea to borrow against your kind of passive clam deposits just opens up a whole nother kind of side here. So I think kind of to reiterate, you're basically introducing products for all users. The clam sounds like something for more passive users that just want to deposit liquidity and earn better yield than Univ three. And then the option AMM is for more sophisticated users that want to execute kind of more sophisticated strategies, maybe market makers, but both products are somewhat synergistic to each other, which I think is really cool. So with all that, boss, I'm actually curious, is there anybody else in the space that's doing something similar to this in options? Do you see any competitors that are converging on the same strategy? Or is this somewhat uncharted territory that you're blazing a new trail here with V two?
00:50:49.520 - 00:51:30.714, Speaker A: So I see a lot of people are using Univc based strategy, for example, smiley finance that will be selling a permanent loss. I think what's differentiating for us is where we are using the tick level. That's the difference. Because what I said about the payoff of nini V three LP being like an option, it works at the tick level, but it also works on a range level. If you have like a range, I don't know, one point eight K, two k and you put it. You're also selling a call and a put on that full range. But here we're using at the tick level.
00:51:30.714 - 00:52:15.254, Speaker A: I think that's the difference between us and other protocols. But for the option Amm part, I've been seeing a lot of people building portfolio margin right now because they know they need the capital efficiency. I think, like I said before, I think one of the major pitfalls of all the option protocol was the capital efficiency. Whether it was with providing liquidity or it was with people not being able to sell options easily. I think those two aspects, I see a lot of people in the space. I think the aspect of the tick usage, I think that's really unique to dox from what I've seen. Maybe there is someone that is building on it, I don't know.
00:52:15.254 - 00:52:55.554, Speaker A: But from. I see from smiley, from gamma swap, from a few others, some of them are using Inevit, some of them are not using at all. They're using the vault system. And I think the vault system is really problematic because you are forced to manage the risk. And market making is a really hard job and we are not necessarily equipped for it. You need a lot of financial knowledge and financial tools to even do it right. And some of the market makers in the trotfi business, they don't necessarily make money from their market making.
00:52:55.554 - 00:53:26.954, Speaker A: They make money because they get rebates from exchange for their order operations. So you'll find those big edge funds that will do market makers because they will get less fees on their edge fund business. So it's like even if they lose a beta market making or they don't make enough to be profitable and to be like to justify the usage capital, they will make so much rebates and fees, adjustments from that traditional, from other business it's worth it, boss.
00:53:27.002 - 00:53:41.986, Speaker E: Let's get into the last piece from this recent medium post about RDPX v two. Can you break down what's changing for RDTX holders? I happen to be one, so I'm very keen to learn more myself.
00:53:42.168 - 00:54:44.738, Speaker A: RDPX, which stands for rebate DPX, was first launched as a rebate token, so it would be used in the dopex ecosystem and it will support option writers loss. If you write options and you lose, we will compensate you a bit with the RDPX and that will essentially improve your overall return and make the liquidity sticky and enable you to take the risk, et cetera. So here that's a comeback to that. How it will be used so people will be able to bond RDPx and ETH. So they will use 25% of RDPx, 75% of ETH, and they will bond it and they will get a receipt token of that. This recipe token will be able to get yield from, will be staked and will be able to get a yield from different sources. Notabny will be incentivizing the curve pool to get yields.
00:54:44.738 - 00:55:51.946, Speaker A: We will have other revenues, but the idea is then to use it to compensate. Also, option sellers option sellers give them the ability to get some RDPx for free if they have huge losses and force them to bond it as a compensation for their loss. So we'll not give them RDPx they can send, we'll give them RDPx that they can bond, get them to the chip token and then do whatever they want with it, sell it or whatever, and be compensated for the lot getting the yield. So it will be used from one part for RDPX holders that want to get yield, and it will be a great yield for the next three months. I'm talking with Bstip. I'm talking it should be at least around minimum, I think 12% return on ETH, if not higher. It will have other sources of revenue and incentives except the FTIP ARB.
00:55:51.946 - 00:56:23.026, Speaker A: It will have CDX potentially pointed to it. It will have revenues from the sending tax. We will introduce on RDPX. It will have a percentage of the potential of the redemption. Because when you bond your RDPX and your ETH, you can also redeem it. You bond RDPX and if you get a receipt token, you can redeem that receipt token and get RDPX and ETH back for a fee. And some they will get some of that fees, potentially some of that fee potentially.
00:56:23.026 - 00:56:37.798, Speaker A: So there is a lot of ways to reward those receipt token. And we want to create an old ecosystem around DPXP two and where RDPX will be its own ecosystem, but it will help also the dpxp two ecosystem.
00:56:37.894 - 00:56:53.762, Speaker E: So the DPX token that we know of today will be changing to a vote escrow V token style. And I believe that token will capture a lot of these fees that you were just running through. Is that somewhat correct?
00:56:53.896 - 00:58:01.970, Speaker A: Yeah, those fees. I will get back to VVpx in a minute, but receipt token holders will get some of the fees generated from the whole ecosystem, like some of the tax, potentially like all those are to be determined, but we'll get some of the tax, some of the redemption fee, they will get rewards from CDX being pointed at them, et cetera. And at the same time, VDPX holders will also get some yield from that, some revenue from the ecosystem, they will get. Just to clarify one point, VDBiX has been out for more than a year and you can lock it up to four years. So right now it already exists. BDPX, it gets some of the revenue from the protocol and it gets incentives in term of DPX. And our goal is with DCB two to generate revenue to potentially eliminate all DPX inflation and to give real yield without additional incentive.
00:58:01.970 - 00:58:36.670, Speaker A: And this real yield will come from different sources. They will come from the fees from clam, it will come from some of the cell tax of RDPX. It will come in terms of decayable RDPX, decayable bonding RDPX. What does this mean, decayable bonding RDPX? It means we will give to VDPX some RDPX. They can only bond during two weeks. So we will give them today. They will have two weeks to bond it or it dives.
00:58:36.670 - 00:59:03.166, Speaker A: So it's a way to give them some of the revenue and some yield from RDPX growing and from the RDPX being bonded in the system. And I think that's the three major revenue sources that will be out after DPXV two and RDPXV two for VDPX holders.
00:59:03.218 - 00:59:10.134, Speaker E: Got it. I'm such an RDPX maxi that I didn't even know VDPX was out. So thanks for that clarification.
00:59:10.262 - 01:00:40.946, Speaker A: And I think people had been a lot like you, like yourself, had been a lot like focused on the RDPXV two. But I think the DPXB two is the sleeper good opportunity for now. And later on, it's a coin that will perform very well with all what we are building with different revenue streams with this revenue from Clem, with some of the revenue from RDPX, et cetera. And it's like really different. So if you were looking just to improve your ETH yield, you can go into RDPX, bond it, and you will get that superior yield that should be at least double of what you will get in lido for yield. And it's a very secure system we will have in place because it's backed 25% with RDPX, but we will have puts in place, perpetual puts in place to make sure we can't lose more than 6% of the value of east like more than 25% on the RDPX. We will quickly accumulate revenue in the RDPX v two treasury to go above backing, and when we go above backing, we will be able to never go back below backing and will always be over backing for that recipe token ease and et cetera, et cetera.
01:00:40.946 - 01:01:36.474, Speaker A: And then we will be using some of that revenue to potentially get more incentives for the receipt tokens to grow the amount of RDPX that is bonded and to limit the supply of RDPX to make RDPX worth more. So we'll be able to use it to use less of RDPX as rebate for option writers. And that will enable us to have more liquidity on DPX and that will enable us to have more fees on DPX and ET cetera. So those both system are really connected. And so if you are like more both systems are really connected but are different at the same time. They can live on their own, but they can help each other. So if you're looking for a safe yield, DPX is the way to go.
01:01:36.474 - 01:02:04.738, Speaker A: If you're looking to optimize your yield with clamps, take a little bit more risk if you're looking to use optimum. So DpX V two is your way to go. But I think getting exposure to both systems is really good and is advisable in my opinion, because both are different and serves different risk levels. But both are good and both should really perform well in the next month.
01:02:04.824 - 01:02:58.466, Speaker B: Boss, this is a great place for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners to first, they can learn more about Dopex and Dopex V two by going to dopex IO, or you can check out the app at app dopex IO. We'll also link the recent medium post about dopex V two so you can look for that in the show notes. They can follow Dopex on Twitter or X at dopexio. They can follow Boss on Twitter at boss LmP 75 and then a great place to really start to ask questions or learn about Dopex. And Dopex V Two is just get into the discord and the link there is Discord GG Dopex. We'll also throw that into the show notes.
01:02:58.466 - 01:03:19.146, Speaker B: So boss, thank you for taking the time to walk us through so much detail here in Dopex V Two. I know we're both really excited as users to have that deeper liquidity for on chain options. Anything else you'd like to share though, in terms of product shipping for the next like six to twelve months?
01:03:19.248 - 01:04:16.602, Speaker A: Yeah. To give you a quick heads up, the clam and the DPX should come in the next 1020 days. We'll be having the option amm hopefully in Q one 2024. From that on we will focus on developing the ecosystem of DPX. So getting potentially more liquidity in getting more partners for the inevitably LPs, getting more protocols to build on top of us, and we will try, like I said, to have those features that some projects may need. We don't have a roadmap after help of 2024, but we are currently bouncing ideas on what should we do next and how it will synergize with the world Dopex ecosystem. But what I can tell you is we are having some great ideas.
01:04:16.602 - 01:04:55.062, Speaker A: Nothing is decided yet, but we will have more tokens, we will have more presence potentially on different blockchains, and we will aim to provide people with more products. Where is it structured products? Where is it different ways to use options? More markets? That's not determined yet, but we have been shipping a lot of products in 2023 and we plan to continue the same in 2024, if not more. And hopefully with the market in better condition, we'll be able to do that and to get more partners and to help the overall ecosystem.
01:04:55.126 - 01:05:10.906, Speaker B: Boss, good luck with the launch and like I said, we're just excited as users of Dopex. So hopefully we can have you back in the future and get your feedback on how the product is gaining traction and any other sort of future products from Dopex.
01:05:11.018 - 01:05:15.374, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. It was really a pleasure. I'm looking forward to the next time.
01:05:15.492 - 01:05:28.050, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge underscore pod.
