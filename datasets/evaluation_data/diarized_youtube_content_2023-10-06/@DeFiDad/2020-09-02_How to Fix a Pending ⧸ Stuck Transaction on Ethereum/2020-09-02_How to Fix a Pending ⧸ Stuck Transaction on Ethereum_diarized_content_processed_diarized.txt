00:00:20.190 - 00:01:13.042, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. This is Defi dad, and this is going to be a really brief tutorial on how to unstick a stuck transaction in metamask. This happens to everyone. It's happened to me many times and it continues to happen to me. Not because I don't know how to set the gas price, but it's because of the fact that these gas prices, which you can think of them as a way to bid on, ensuring that your transaction gets confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain. So the higher the gas price, the more likely it is to get confirmed. And because this all sort of works like an auction, it means that these prices can go up if more and more people are bidding and willing to pay higher prices.
00:01:13.042 - 00:02:08.070, Speaker A: It also means that it'll come down when folks say, screw this, I'm just going to set this out and I'm not going to bid higher prices and I'm going to wait until they come back down. So this is the ETH gas station, and this is where I normally come to see what is the average gas price that people are bidding. And it gives me this nice range. So this is at the higher end. I know that the transaction will most definitely go through if I put it at 480 or higher, which is incredibly high. If you've never looked at this or thought about it, gas prices six months ago were well under 30 Gwe. So the fact that these gas prices are really high is one of the most confident indicators that we are dealing with.
00:02:08.070 - 00:02:47.460, Speaker A: Lots of growth and lots of demand for people to use Ethereum. And then in the middle here is sort of the sweet spot. So this is where I normally set my gas price, whatever this recommends, or I will set it between what is the standard less than five minute recommendation time versus what would get my transaction through in less than 30 minutes. So in this example, I would probably set the gas price around 450. But I'm always refreshing this right before I hit confirm to see if the numbers change. And yeah, they look like they didn't change. So yeah, 450 would probably work for me.
00:02:47.460 - 00:03:57.766, Speaker A: If my gas price, though, is set below this number, I could get stuck. And you can think of it as simply as if the gas price is too cheap, then the miners aren't willing to include my transaction in a block. And that is not good, because then it means that I have a pending transaction, which means it's stuck. It doesn't mean that my funds aren't safe. It doesn't mean that I'm going to lose the money that was a part of that transaction it means that I'm going to have to wait until gas prices come back down to around 440 or lower so that my transaction gets confirmed. Alternatively though, what I'm going to show you is if I'm in a hurry and I realize, shit, I just put this thing through, I set the wrong gas price and I really need to get this done because I need to do another transaction after it. I can do what's called dropping and replacing the transaction.
00:03:57.766 - 00:04:21.710, Speaker A: So that's what I'm going to show you here. And we'll run through a quick example and hopefully cover all of the details and frequently asked questions that come up. Okay, so let's do an example with Uniswap. So I'm going to trade some ether for the MCB token, which is the governance token for Monte Carlo Dex.
00:04:22.310 - 00:04:23.986, Speaker B: So if I go here and if.
00:04:24.008 - 00:05:41.390, Speaker A: I'm going to put in one ether, I'm going to get about 112 McB. And when I go to swap because I'm trading ether, one of the first things that's worth pointing out is you might have never noticed this, but when you are sending or depositing, staking, doing whatever with ether, it only requires a single transaction in almost all instances. And that's because ether is the native token of Ethereum and I don't have to be asked permission to spend that ether. It's something that I'm just able to do because again, it's the native token of Ethereum. So if I were to hit swap, here's my confirmation. And this is going to be a single confirmation because remember, I'm starting with ether so I don't have to give approval to spend an ERC 20 token like die. It's just ether, which is great because it saves me money.
00:05:41.390 - 00:06:25.868, Speaker A: Instead of having to work with multiple transactions, it's just one. But let's go ahead and set the gas price well below what it would take to execute this. It's showing that if the gas price is somewhere between 480 and 440, it will likely go through in less than 30 minutes. So let's go back to uniswap and take a look at that transaction. I'm going to set it much lower. So I'm setting that at 20 guay, which is going to then reflect in my gas fee. So it dropped from like what, $38, $37 down to a dollar 63.
00:06:25.868 - 00:07:30.486, Speaker A: And then let's go ahead and hit confirm. All right, so ether scan is showing me that the estimated time to confirmation is 2 hours and nine minutes. Which is funny because I think there's zero chance in hell that this will go through in 2 hours and nine minutes because the gas price I set is so incredibly low at 20 guay. So if it's at only 20 guay, this then leads me to realize that I'm stuck. So let's fast forward 24 hours, and I'm really getting frustrated and worried, like, what the heck? I have other things I want to do with other DFI applications. If I click here on my wallet address, I can see that I'm stuck here still. So pending is what tells me that the transaction is stuck.
00:07:30.486 - 00:08:38.286, Speaker A: Normally, my transaction would be pending, but it would be pending for hopefully less than 30 minutes, at worst a few hours if I have to wait longer because the gas price was close, but just a little bit too low. But here I'm completely stuck. All right, so what we're going to do is go back to metamask and we're going to send a zero ether transaction. So it's basically just a dummy transaction, but we're going to match it to the nonce of the transaction that is stuck. So, actually, let's go back here, click on the transaction hash, which, by the way, the transaction hash is just a unique ID that represents this transaction between my wallet and uniswap. And so I scroll down, I click on click to see more, and then I see that the nonce, which is basically just a number, and they're numbers that run in order. The transaction before this was 256, this one's 257 and so on.
00:08:38.286 - 00:09:42.582, Speaker A: So it's 257. I'm going to send a dummy transaction, and I'm going to put in 257 to ensure that this one gets knocked out it. So I'll go ahead and click send. So this is me sending from dfidad ETH, but I'm actually sending to dfidad ETH. So just be careful that you understand that you are not only sending a zero ether transaction, but I am sending that from one wallet, the one that is stuck. It has to be the wallet that has the stuck transaction, and I'm sending it to the same wallet that has the stuck transaction. So I go here, and I know that the ETH gas station was telling me that it needs to be around 480 or higher.
00:09:42.582 - 00:10:19.022, Speaker A: So 480 guay. So I'm going to set the gas price at 485 to make sure it goes through as quickly as possible. I don't have to worry about the gas limit. Again, this is a zero ether transaction. It's being sent from the wallet that has a stuck transaction to the same wallet address that I am sending from. And then this is where I change the nonce. If you don't have this available in metamask, you can go to up in the top right hand corner.
00:10:19.022 - 00:11:04.580, Speaker A: Normally there's the little colorful icon. Click on that, then click on settings, click on Advanced, and then under advanced look for custom nonce and it'll allow you then to have this more powerful feature. So I need this to match 257 and then that's it. So I've got the custom nonce instead of it being 258. This would have automatically made the nonce 258 because it's the next transaction after it. But I'm going to match it to the one that's stuck. And if I had multiple stuck transactions, I need to choose the lowest number possible.
00:11:04.580 - 00:11:38.780, Speaker A: So let's pretend that I screwed up and now I've got two stuck transactions. Look at both of them, figure out which one has the lower custom nonce or the lower nonce, the number. And once you figure that out, put in the lower number between the two of them. So I'm going to use 257 45 guay. We're all set to go and it's going to cost me $4.85 in total. I think it's a pretty good deal compared to sitting around any longer and being worried about this.
00:11:38.780 - 00:11:48.270, Speaker A: And then you can see up above that I'm sending from dfidad ETH to dfidad ETH and it's zero ether.
00:11:50.930 - 00:11:53.726, Speaker B: All right, we're back like 60 seconds.
00:11:53.758 - 00:12:08.950, Speaker A: Later and my dummy transaction has gone through. So you can see I sent zero ether. I sent it from my wallet to my wallet. It cost me $4.85, which is about 0.1 ether.
00:12:09.450 - 00:12:17.014, Speaker B: And you can see that the transaction number is 257. So that is how I was able.
00:12:17.052 - 00:12:20.330, Speaker A: To cancel and drop the other transaction.
00:12:20.670 - 00:12:30.890, Speaker B: If we go back to that original transaction, let's go and hit refresh. Now it has been dropped and replaced.
00:12:31.410 - 00:12:40.254, Speaker A: So this transaction basically never existed. Now for me, I don't recall exactly.
00:12:40.372 - 00:12:47.106, Speaker B: Why someone once explained this to me, but this transaction cost here, this is.
00:12:47.128 - 00:12:49.380, Speaker A: Not something that I actually paid.
00:12:50.150 - 00:12:56.290, Speaker B: The transaction cost that I did pay is on the one that went through, that was confirmed.
00:12:56.870 - 00:12:59.974, Speaker A: So I did pay $4.85, but the.
00:13:00.012 - 00:13:03.334, Speaker B: Original one that had the gas price.
00:13:03.372 - 00:13:04.658, Speaker A: Set at 20 Gwe.
00:13:04.754 - 00:13:14.662, Speaker B: This is not a cost that I actually incurred. So anyways, that's how easy it is to do. I never wait long for my transactions.
00:13:14.726 - 00:13:17.882, Speaker A: To go through because if I see.
00:13:17.936 - 00:13:53.494, Speaker B: My transaction is not going through after about 30 minutes, I normally go here to the gas station, and I just hit refresh to see what's going on. And if I see that the gas price, let's pretend the gas prices here have moved up to 500. This lower number, let's pretend is at 500. If the gas price I set was at 440. That's why my transaction isn't going through and it's going to be stuck until this ETH gas station shows me that.
00:13:53.532 - 00:13:55.154, Speaker A: Gas prices have dropped.
00:13:55.282 - 00:14:34.192, Speaker B: So it's not a guessing game. It's just a matter of being able to figure out what is the going rate of gas or the gas price on Ethereum. So before I go, there are a few risks that I can think of. They're mostly human error that could come up. Let's pretend that I am going to send that transaction, the dummy transaction, to myself. Please make sure that when you hit send that you use the option to.
00:14:34.246 - 00:14:37.360, Speaker A: Transfer between wallet addresses.
00:14:37.700 - 00:15:47.416, Speaker B: And even so, I'm always very careful, unless you're someone that uses metamask all the time like myself, and I've done this so many times, I know that it works flawlessly. It's important to just double check and make sure. Am I sending from the wallet that has the stock transaction, and am I sending it to myself in the same wallet with the same Ethereum wallet address? And am I also sending a zero ether transaction? So just do yourself a favor and stick to the simplest, easiest ability to drop and replace this transaction. Another problem I could see running into is let's pretend that gas prices are going up like they were today. They just kept going up. They started below, let's say, 300. And even though I'm coming back to fix a stuck transaction, let's say I get unlucky a second time.
00:15:47.416 - 00:16:25.748, Speaker B: I check the ETH gas station. I set it at 490. Suddenly, after I set this at 490, the gas prices jump well above 490. Now I've got two stuck transactions. No problem. It just means that I need to go back one more time and I need to find between the two transactions, what is the lower nonce number. If I were to click next here, I go back and I look for what is the lower transaction number between the two.
00:16:25.748 - 00:17:08.188, Speaker B: So if we go here, that was found by actually, let's see if we have it here. Here we go. It's always hidden, so click to see more and then you can find it right here under nonce. So if I have two stuck transactions and one is 257 and the other one is 258, it means that I have to unstick 257 first and then I need to do another transaction to unstick the second one. Do the exact same thing. Dummy transaction, but match it to 258. That's how easy it is, but yet.
00:17:08.374 - 00:17:11.444, Speaker A: How important it is that I understand.
00:17:11.642 - 00:18:14.840, Speaker B: The sequential order of the two transactions. Otherwise, if I keep trying to unstick 258, and 257 is the one that's also stuck. I'm just stacking stuck transactions now because these transactions confirm in order and 257 hasn't confirmed, and 2582-5926 and so on are all sitting there waiting for this 257 to unclog. All right, that's all I've got for you today. I hope you find this helpful. I know gas prices can be frustrating, but having a stuck transaction is really kind of a rite of passage if you've used Ethereum, and it's pretty unsettling the first time it happens, I do remember thinking that I had lost my funds, but they're not. It's just because the transaction is stuck, and it just requires you to do a process like this to unstick it.
00:18:14.840 - 00:18:17.364, Speaker B: Or you can just be really patient.
00:18:17.412 - 00:18:18.584, Speaker A: And wait for it.
