00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.030, Speaker A: Like as a platform, our job really.
00:00:02.100 - 00:00:26.710, Speaker B: Is to figure out how to help users make their life easier. How do we help them make better decisions? How do we distill insights for them? And I think the tool is really meant to help crypto traders kind of stay on top of the trends, the news, the tokens in order to make better decisions.
00:00:29.290 - 00:00:38.646, Speaker C: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm Defi dad from Fourth Revolution Capital, and I'm here with my friend and cohost from four RC nomadic. Today's show is a shorter episode we.

00:03:38.070 - 00:03:42.590, Speaker D: All right, in just a moment, we'll introduce Imran from Kyber Swap, who is the head of marketing.
00:03:42.670 - 00:03:45.006, Speaker C: Kyber Network was founded by Loy Lou.
00:03:45.038 - 00:04:00.098, Speaker D: And Victor Tran back in 2017 to connect the deepest crypto liquidity at the best rates. They were far ahead of the trend of DFI and long before the term DFI was even coined. Today, Kyber is one of the top multichain Dex aggregators and automated market makers.
00:04:00.194 - 00:04:04.470, Speaker C: We're going to talk with Imron about the return of Kyber's elastic Amm rewards.
00:04:04.630 - 00:04:12.198, Speaker D: As well as their new product release called Kyber AI, which is bound to be a must have tool for every Defi investor and trader.
00:04:12.294 - 00:04:14.874, Speaker C: So let's kick it off. Imran, welcome to the Edge podcast.
00:04:14.922 - 00:04:15.678, Speaker D: How are you doing?
00:04:15.764 - 00:04:17.482, Speaker B: I'm doing great, thanks, Defi.
00:04:17.546 - 00:04:18.314, Speaker A: Hi nomadic.
00:04:18.362 - 00:04:19.806, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for joining us.
00:04:19.908 - 00:05:14.170, Speaker D: So we're going to use this time to give folks some background to Kyber in case they're totally new to Defi. It's funny because Kyber is one of the earliest Defi protocols that I learned about, but this was actually long before the term was even coined. I'm pretty confident I would have been looking at what would have been the Kyber token back in the day and then through that last bear market of like 20 18, 20 19, 20 20. I got to understand the actual utility behind the Kyber network because I started to benefit from trading using Kyber. So why don't we just start with the usual here? Can you give some background as to who you are as a human being and what brought you into working in crypto and ultimately at Kyber?
00:05:14.330 - 00:05:21.810, Speaker B: Sure. So my name is Imran. I'm the head of marketing for Kyber Network. Our core product is Kyberswap. As you mentioned, it's a Dax. It's an aggregator.
00:05:22.310 - 00:05:24.114, Speaker A: In fact, we'd like to think of.
00:05:24.152 - 00:05:38.600, Speaker B: Us as an all in one tool for all Defi users to move forward even beyond what people consider the core features of a Dex or an aggregator going into things like trading tools and things like that.
00:05:39.370 - 00:05:42.794, Speaker A: So myself, I'm a debt as well.
00:05:42.992 - 00:05:45.046, Speaker B: I kind of think of myself as a defi dad.
00:05:45.078 - 00:05:47.322, Speaker A: In fact, I kind of copied you.
00:05:47.376 - 00:05:55.102, Speaker B: I think when I first saw that term, I was like, damn, that's me, right? So I've got three kids. I think a big motivation for me.
00:05:55.156 - 00:05:57.598, Speaker A: As a builder, why I wanted to.
00:05:57.604 - 00:06:03.902, Speaker B: Be in the industry, why I was so excited about it, why I felt completely different about being in this industry.
00:06:03.966 - 00:06:06.434, Speaker A: Versus before I was in ecommerce and.
00:06:06.472 - 00:06:30.794, Speaker B: Stuff like that, was really because I believe very strongly in creating the equitable structures, decentralization, providing access and freedom for all. I really think about my kids when I'm building that right. And I think crypto is not just about pumping our bags. I think crypto is really about creating a system where everyone has free access.
00:06:30.912 - 00:06:32.330, Speaker A: And equity.
00:06:34.030 - 00:06:39.322, Speaker B: Kind of baked in into what was previously clearly a flawed or.
00:06:39.376 - 00:06:47.422, Speaker A: Clearly a biased model. So that's why I'm here. It's very apt that we are talking.
00:06:47.476 - 00:06:58.802, Speaker B: Together on bitcoin day. Bitcoin pizza day. I think my first touch with crypto was I did a tour in Silicon Valley with my university and this was.
00:06:58.856 - 00:07:01.380, Speaker A: Back in like nine, very long ago.
00:07:02.070 - 00:07:25.702, Speaker B: On that trip I did two very remarkable things which I had no idea. I was a dumb kid. I toured the Tesla factory and I received a little thumb drive with bitcoin inside. And I have no idea where the thumb drive is today. And that was my first touch of crypto, of bitcoin.
00:07:25.766 - 00:07:28.314, Speaker A: And I think it was really only.
00:07:28.432 - 00:07:39.390, Speaker B: In 2017 with the ICo hype that I got in touch with crypto again. As a marketer, I did a couple of ICO launches.
00:07:39.810 - 00:07:42.186, Speaker A: I was very disillusioned with the industry.
00:07:42.218 - 00:07:51.390, Speaker B: After that, actually, because there's just so many pumps and dumps and so many irresponsible and incapable or just outright scam teams.
00:07:51.550 - 00:07:55.282, Speaker A: And I did not want to associate with any of them.
00:07:55.336 - 00:07:58.280, Speaker B: I really reconsidered for a long time.
00:07:59.690 - 00:08:01.490, Speaker A: Whether I wanted to be in the industry.
00:08:01.570 - 00:08:03.506, Speaker B: And it was only after Defi summer.
00:08:03.538 - 00:08:05.640, Speaker A: That I re entered as an individual.
00:08:06.010 - 00:08:13.260, Speaker B: Investor, commentator, observer in the market. And then I joined Kyber just over a year ago.
00:08:16.110 - 00:08:17.846, Speaker A: I mentioned the ICO height.
00:08:17.878 - 00:08:23.034, Speaker B: So Kyber actually did an ICO back in 2017. So I think famously Lloyd and Victor.
00:08:23.082 - 00:08:26.174, Speaker A: When they started Kyber, Lloyd was a.
00:08:26.212 - 00:08:33.490, Speaker B: Contributor within Ethereum community. He was doing a PhD in blockchain.
00:08:34.310 - 00:08:36.770, Speaker A: And I think it was somehow through.
00:08:36.840 - 00:08:50.514, Speaker B: Those conversations that he managed to get Vitalik as one of our founding advisors. So I think that's kind of like our first claim to fame where we did the ICO. Vitalik was our founding advisor.
00:08:50.562 - 00:08:53.480, Speaker A: We did 52 million in ICO and.
00:08:53.850 - 00:08:56.438, Speaker B: We never did a VC equity round since.
00:08:56.524 - 00:08:59.770, Speaker A: Right. So we've always managed to find ways.
00:08:59.840 - 00:09:31.410, Speaker B: To prop ourselves up and keep ourselves going. For the last six years. I think the goal has always been to look at how do you take all this little fragmented liquidity in Defi and aggregate it together so that it can be usable, tradable. Because I think the key difference in DeFi and centralized systems is that you and I have to participate and make the liquidity work, right, because you don't have institutions in a centralized system, market.
00:09:31.480 - 00:09:34.180, Speaker A: Makers who are making the market.
00:09:34.630 - 00:09:42.534, Speaker B: You actually have DeFi users like you and I using our liquidity, and that's why you have AMMs or DMMs or.
00:09:42.572 - 00:09:45.958, Speaker A: CLMMs, or however they are known, right?
00:09:46.124 - 00:09:52.746, Speaker B: The market makers are the individuals in Defi. And I think that's really where Kyber started.
00:09:52.928 - 00:09:55.322, Speaker A: I think where it's moving towards is.
00:09:55.376 - 00:10:35.382, Speaker B: The idea that over time, I think users need to have an all in one platform. Therefore we're going multi chain. We're doing cross chain very soon, and we're doing multifunction. So it's not just a Dex, like uniswap, not just an agator, maybe like one inch or matcha or cowswap. And not even just tools. You might think of people like, let's say candlestick nonsense, dextools. And the idea is, what if you could have one platform that has all these functions that perform really well, and so that the user just has everything in one place.
00:10:35.382 - 00:10:38.290, Speaker B: Things are baked under the hood and it's just really efficient.
00:10:38.370 - 00:10:39.586, Speaker A: And I think that's really the vision.
00:10:39.618 - 00:10:42.238, Speaker B: Of Kyberswap to be the most used decks in Defi.
00:10:42.354 - 00:11:50.382, Speaker D: When you look at where Kyber is today, any user that is going to hop on the platform, they're going to lack the appreciation for just all the iterations that you all have been through. I remember this is going back to, I want to say, 2019. I think 2019 is the first time I would have ever swapped with Kyber. There's Kyber swap, which was powerful back then, but the idea of what was a Dex aggregator really didn't exist yet, because we only had a few dexes that were even working on Ethereum. And so over time, Kyber being this major protocol for sourcing liquidity, it seemed like Kyber was actually ahead of the market at the time. And then we grew into 2000 and 22,021, where Dex aggregators became a more common app that you would use to go and trade on versus going to the individual exchanges or amms. So that took some time.
00:11:50.382 - 00:12:33.374, Speaker D: And then of course Kyber early on being on Ethereum, that's where all of our focus was as users. But since then I think you all are on like 13 plus L two s and l ones now. So other evm l ones, that was a huge jump for Kyber to move there. And then on top of that we now have l two s, which really has only become more popular to use now in the last year. So DFI has evolved a lot and I've always thought of Kyber as one of the DFI OGs that has continually evolved with it. And there's never going to be a more killer use case than trading. And that's what Kyber is all about.
00:12:33.374 - 00:12:34.250, Speaker D: Enabling.
00:12:34.410 - 00:12:35.454, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:12:35.652 - 00:12:38.186, Speaker B: So we are deployed on 13 chains.
00:12:38.378 - 00:12:40.078, Speaker A: You mentioned Ethereum and then you have.
00:12:40.084 - 00:12:55.202, Speaker B: Your l two s like arbitram, optimism, polygon avalanche. We are deploying on ZK sync as well. So that's going to happen in a couple of weeks. So we have all of these things.
00:12:55.256 - 00:12:57.286, Speaker A: Going on and we work directly in.
00:12:57.308 - 00:13:02.226, Speaker B: Most cases with the foundations as well to ensure that we deploy.
00:13:02.418 - 00:13:04.550, Speaker A: We are seen as one of the.
00:13:04.700 - 00:13:10.570, Speaker B: Key protocols or supporting protocols for the chain and their vision and their ecosystem.
00:13:10.990 - 00:13:13.494, Speaker A: I would say that our ecosystem partnership.
00:13:13.542 - 00:13:48.660, Speaker B: Strategy is one of our key strategies. Where we deploy our Dex, where we get integrated, where we deploy our aggregators, we integrate all the Dexes that are on the chain, we have our aggregator and then it gets integrated into all the various DApps that are in the ecosystem. Whether it's a trading platform like Dextools or GameFi or a wallet or other type of dapps, and then figuring out co marketing, liquidity partnerships. So yeah, ecosystem partnerships, very key for us.
00:13:49.830 - 00:13:52.102, Speaker A: What I noticed, especially in DeFi, is.
00:13:52.156 - 00:13:56.594, Speaker B: That the role of a marketer like myself is kind of muted.
00:13:56.642 - 00:13:58.842, Speaker A: I think it really starts off with.
00:13:58.896 - 00:14:17.470, Speaker B: The key strategic decisions about what are we really building and then what's the real strategy to go to market, not from a communications point of view, but more so from what are we really deploying and who are we partnering with and what are we enabling when we go to market.
00:14:17.620 - 00:14:44.710, Speaker G: Imran, just first off, before I get into my question here, I just want to touch on that opening that you gave. That was awesome. There's a lot of historical highlights in there. We talked about Tesla, bitcoin, ICOs Vitalik, you're a fellow Defi dad like myself and the one and only Defi dad here as well. So the Kyber team have been longtime builders in the space. What are some of the lessons learned building in DeFi over that time period?
00:14:45.370 - 00:14:46.360, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:14:47.210 - 00:14:53.690, Speaker B: I think we probably learned so much more from our mistakes and missed opportunities.
00:14:55.390 - 00:14:57.162, Speaker A: One of the things that was very.
00:14:57.216 - 00:15:18.914, Speaker B: Clear in DFI summer was that Kyber before 2019, or at 2019, was one of the first Dexes that he can swap on and had a dominant position. And because of the wrong decisions in terms of what we're building, what we.
00:15:18.952 - 00:15:23.534, Speaker A: Position did not benefit from the DeFi.
00:15:23.582 - 00:15:26.230, Speaker B: Summer as much as many other protocols.
00:15:26.730 - 00:15:32.360, Speaker A: And so I think it was very interesting to see what mistakes or what.
00:15:34.650 - 00:15:54.286, Speaker B: Caused those shifting of rankings, shifting of the market dynamics and what led to the growth so far. I think we're still early, but obviously in 2019 and before that was way early as well.
00:15:54.468 - 00:15:56.814, Speaker A: So I think one of the things.
00:15:56.852 - 00:16:06.222, Speaker B: That I see in DFI is that there has to be a certain level of boldness and timing really matters.
00:16:06.286 - 00:16:06.466, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:06.488 - 00:16:24.390, Speaker B: So it really matters if you are going to be a key protocol that's deployed on a key l two, let's say arbitram or optimism or Zksync when it comes to being a dominant dax on that chain.
00:16:25.770 - 00:16:28.314, Speaker A: And there's only so much you can.
00:16:28.352 - 00:16:30.602, Speaker B: Do if you come in a year later.
00:16:30.736 - 00:16:32.602, Speaker A: And a year might not seem very.
00:16:32.656 - 00:16:35.580, Speaker B: Long in any other industry, but.
00:16:37.950 - 00:16:38.326, Speaker A: It'S.
00:16:38.358 - 00:16:42.560, Speaker B: Miles and miles and miles away in the Defi case.
00:16:43.010 - 00:16:45.182, Speaker A: So I think one of the things.
00:16:45.236 - 00:17:34.560, Speaker B: That the team has had to do is really figure out how do we improve and make better our lead times, our decisions, how do we make a lot of these decisions, which are really gut instinct decisions, actually, because it's so early that you have to really figure out, okay, these are all, for example, which other l two should we deploy on? And there's kind of like dozens or handfuls. And if you want to be very data driven, you'd have to wait quite a bit. And I think what you need to look at is how do you thin slice what you see in the market, what you hear from the chains, what you hear from the protocols and the market feedback, and then kind of, like, go your gut on two or three things.
00:17:35.330 - 00:17:37.230, Speaker A: So I think that's one thing that.
00:17:37.300 - 00:17:40.222, Speaker B: Is very interesting, especially as someone that.
00:17:40.276 - 00:17:44.118, Speaker A: Came in seeing how that past unfolded.
00:17:44.154 - 00:17:52.002, Speaker B: And then history happens in cycles, and then you have all these new opportunities with l two s, you probably have.
00:17:52.136 - 00:17:54.274, Speaker A: What we consider might be a very.
00:17:54.312 - 00:17:57.320, Speaker B: Interesting time in the next one or two years ahead.
00:17:59.370 - 00:18:02.694, Speaker A: I think for us, we have made.
00:18:02.732 - 00:18:24.734, Speaker B: A decision with regards to what our thesis is for DeFi platform to be dominant in the future, which is to be all in one, which is to be really ux and user focused. If you notice, our narrative tends to not have anything to do with our token in general.
00:18:24.932 - 00:18:28.174, Speaker A: We don't auto emit tokens, and so.
00:18:28.212 - 00:18:33.554, Speaker B: We'Re really product focused here. And so we have a certain thesis about it.
00:18:33.752 - 00:18:39.620, Speaker A: But we really believe that even without.
00:18:40.950 - 00:18:43.186, Speaker B: Any strings attached, without any bells and.
00:18:43.208 - 00:18:47.478, Speaker A: Whistles, if you looked at before we.
00:18:47.564 - 00:18:55.510, Speaker B: Paused elastic protocol, we were at something like number eight of all d five protocols in 24 hours revenue.
00:18:56.090 - 00:18:57.606, Speaker A: And this year we are switching on.
00:18:57.628 - 00:19:01.370, Speaker B: A few revenue switches, and we are.
00:19:01.520 - 00:19:06.490, Speaker A: Switching on a few growth mechanisms, and I think we're going to hit towards.
00:19:06.560 - 00:19:14.334, Speaker B: That top tree again in terms of 24 hours revenue, in terms of DFI, Dex rankings, all time, and stuff like that.
00:19:14.372 - 00:19:17.054, Speaker A: So I think we've learned a lot.
00:19:17.092 - 00:19:20.894, Speaker B: From that past, and we're very clear about where we're going in the future.
00:19:21.092 - 00:19:50.810, Speaker G: That's a very candid and thorough answer to that question. And something that kind of stuck out for me that is similar on the investor side is that need to kind of make a leap with imperfect information. Because if you always wait for perfect information to emerge, you're late. Right. So I'm sure when Kyber is trying to expand to new chains and new networks, you really have to do it quickly to be competitive and to kind of retain that edge.
00:19:51.790 - 00:19:55.258, Speaker B: We've done some of these things right, and we've done some of these things wrong.
00:19:55.344 - 00:19:57.946, Speaker A: So the most recent one that I.
00:19:57.968 - 00:20:12.880, Speaker B: Would say we did really well was with the arbitrum integration, and arbitram has got a really good l two position now. Probably did the biggest, if I'm not wrong, the biggest airdrop by far in the market.
00:20:13.510 - 00:20:15.810, Speaker A: So our users were really hyped about that.
00:20:15.880 - 00:20:24.450, Speaker B: Our users had good product engagement with us. Our users got the airdrop. We, as a protocol, got the airdrop.
00:20:24.950 - 00:20:34.054, Speaker A: So I think in terms of what went right, that definitely went right. If you looked at what could have been much better, we kind of took.
00:20:34.092 - 00:20:42.378, Speaker B: A nap on Solana for a while, and then we decided to go in on Solana, and you could not time this better.
00:20:42.464 - 00:20:44.714, Speaker A: We deployed on Solana, and it was.
00:20:44.752 - 00:20:47.290, Speaker B: Live two weeks after FTX meltdown.
00:20:48.110 - 00:20:52.110, Speaker A: So it just wasn't great timing.
00:20:53.490 - 00:20:54.638, Speaker B: But what do you do?
00:20:54.724 - 00:20:56.206, Speaker A: Do you not announce it after all.
00:20:56.228 - 00:21:03.534, Speaker B: The engineering and product work? Right. So we have to bite the bullet on these decisions and go in just.
00:21:03.572 - 00:21:05.778, Speaker A: Knowing that, hey, there's just not going.
00:21:05.784 - 00:21:07.346, Speaker B: To be that narrative, there's just not.
00:21:07.368 - 00:21:10.594, Speaker A: Going to be that excitement and that.
00:21:10.632 - 00:21:14.820, Speaker B: Usage on that chain right now just because of where the market is.
00:21:15.350 - 00:21:18.646, Speaker A: And, yeah, I think when you look back on it, then you go, well.
00:21:18.748 - 00:21:21.350, Speaker B: We definitely should have made that call much earlier.
00:21:21.770 - 00:22:31.478, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, short term, the arbitrum launch for Kyber has looked like much more of a success. But I think, to be fair, the fact that you all launched on Solana, obviously, the timing was epically rough for everyone in crypto because of what happened with FTX and how it was tied into Solana. But maybe in a few years, we'll look back and, wow, like, Kyber launched at the depths of what was the bear market really the best time to start to show that sort of support for the users that would be your most loyal users through the next cycle. So, yeah, we both have talked quite a bit about this privately, just about how, I think, bold that was, that Kyber has now made the leap beyond just EVM chains. And so we'll see how that all plays out. Can we just talk a bit more about the current product suite before we move on to what's coming next? You mentioned the elastic amm.
00:22:31.478 - 00:22:48.338, Speaker D: Can you just walk us through, what is the elastic amm? What sort of benefits might it have over other amms? And then also, if you can kind of talk through the bug that was patched and when we can expect amm rewards to return.
00:22:48.504 - 00:22:49.298, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:22:49.384 - 00:22:53.646, Speaker A: So Kyberswap has two liquidity protocols.
00:22:53.678 - 00:23:06.338, Speaker B: One is called classic, and one is called elastic. Classic was our first liquidity protocol, which we termed a dynamic market maker, which we kind of akin to something like Uber search pricing.
00:23:06.434 - 00:23:14.170, Speaker A: When volume is high, then we increase the pricing. So kind of like catering to market.
00:23:14.240 - 00:23:20.102, Speaker B: Demands, we adopted for elastic concentrated liquidity.
00:23:20.166 - 00:23:22.990, Speaker A: Market maker approach, which is what is.
00:23:23.060 - 00:23:39.330, Speaker B: Maybe similar to what maybe people might know uni V three as. So you have concentrated ticks of liquidity, you can set your price range. There's a few things that we created that are unique. So, first of all, obviously, we built it from scratch ourselves.
00:23:39.750 - 00:23:43.220, Speaker A: The second thing is we adopted a certain.
00:23:45.930 - 00:24:11.770, Speaker B: User protection with just in time attack protection with the liquidity protocol. And there's also an auto reinvestment curve where the proceeds from that farming is actually reinvested into the full price range as well, so that you get maximized returns. So we're known as being a very capital efficient Dex.
00:24:12.290 - 00:24:16.222, Speaker A: I think the next thing that you probably want to understand for elastic is.
00:24:16.276 - 00:24:38.886, Speaker B: That we have many price settings or price fee settings. I think most notably, we released price fees for the LPs up to 5%. So you have 5% settings, you have 2% settings. So if you imagine if you are a very sophisticated LP, or you kind.
00:24:38.908 - 00:24:41.074, Speaker A: Of know what you're doing and you're.
00:24:41.122 - 00:24:43.122, Speaker B: In, let's say, for example, meme season.
00:24:43.186 - 00:24:46.054, Speaker A: And then there's paypay and Wojak and.
00:24:46.092 - 00:24:48.198, Speaker B: Various stuff, and people are going crazy.
00:24:48.284 - 00:24:52.086, Speaker A: On the trading volume, and people don't.
00:24:52.118 - 00:25:11.306, Speaker B: Really care as much if I'm getting a little bit of slippage or I have to pay a little bit more fees, but I want to buy it or I really want to sell it. And that's when your LPs, at 2% fees or 5% fees, literally print money for the LPs.
00:25:11.498 - 00:25:13.682, Speaker A: So this is not even talking about rewards, right?
00:25:13.736 - 00:25:43.402, Speaker B: So we created some of these LPs, really to be able to have LPs during certain interesting times, be able to really earn from some of this volume and volatility in the market. We saw some of this volatility that led to a lot of LP earning, not just with the meme coins, but even, for example, when arbitram token first landed and there was so much volume and volatility and price discovery in the market.
00:25:43.456 - 00:25:46.122, Speaker A: So that was very interesting and people.
00:25:46.176 - 00:25:48.246, Speaker B: That were just, hey, I'm just going to hold on to my Arp.
00:25:48.278 - 00:25:49.654, Speaker A: I'm just going to do an Arp.
00:25:49.702 - 00:25:56.426, Speaker B: ETH pool and I'm going to earn on the 1%, 2%, 5% pools during that period.
00:25:56.538 - 00:25:57.806, Speaker A: Of course, this is not something that.
00:25:57.828 - 00:26:02.394, Speaker B: Lasts forever, but those fees were very.
00:26:02.452 - 00:26:03.954, Speaker A: Significant during those time.
00:26:04.072 - 00:26:09.854, Speaker B: So I think with regards to elastic, I think that's where as a concentrated.
00:26:09.902 - 00:26:14.194, Speaker A: Liquidity protocol, we deploy this on our.
00:26:14.232 - 00:26:52.014, Speaker B: Various chains that we have. We work with many of the chains, including Arbitrum, avalanche Polygon, to host some of their native token liquidity. We work with some of the key protocols, for example, Lido finance, Qidao Benchy, and Yeti finance on Avax to host some of their key liquidity for many projects as well. We do particularly well with a lot of liquid stake tokens. So your rep stake ETH, your stakematic, your stake, avax and avex pools, stuff.
00:26:52.052 - 00:26:58.594, Speaker A: Like that, and then we can slap on the farming on top of it, right?
00:26:58.632 - 00:27:12.246, Speaker B: So we will tend to work with either the chain protocols themselves to launch and bootstrap liquidity using liquidity mining rewards, as well as the protocols themselves with.
00:27:12.268 - 00:27:14.742, Speaker A: Regards to the bug that was found.
00:27:14.876 - 00:27:47.810, Speaker B: What we do is we do have close relationship with our community and the devs that are in the community. So one of the devs came to us and said, hey, I did a simulation, I looked through the code, and there is a potential vulnerability here. And when we took a look at it and we conducted our own simulation, we could verify that there's an issue there, particularly within the liquidity protocol, specifically when you are minting new liquidity positions.
00:27:49.510 - 00:27:54.260, Speaker A: The potential attack vector was when anyone.
00:27:54.810 - 00:28:02.374, Speaker B: Wanted to add a position, that is when the attack could happen, and then your funds could potentially get siphoned after.
00:28:02.492 - 00:28:05.878, Speaker A: So I think that's where in order.
00:28:05.964 - 00:28:15.686, Speaker B: To first protect all users, we completely stopped the ability to create new LP positions.
00:28:15.878 - 00:28:17.338, Speaker A: So that's the very first thing, so.
00:28:17.344 - 00:29:06.422, Speaker B: That we eliminated that possibility of anyone getting attacked. So technically at that point, users are safe, the funds are safe. However, of course we wanted to be able to upgrade the smart contract, and that means that eventually we need to redeploy the smart contract. And therefore we told the users, that being the case, everyone should withdraw their liquidity from elastic, and then we will redeploy, and then you can reinput your liquidity. So I think, of course, there were some concern questions when people heard about it. The good part is we went from 108,000,000 Tvl to below two in about 48 hours. And this was like 100% planned.
00:29:06.422 - 00:29:10.022, Speaker B: It was really because we told everyone, just remove your liquidity.
00:29:10.166 - 00:29:12.554, Speaker A: And I think it's really because of.
00:29:12.672 - 00:29:29.634, Speaker B: Our white hack das, it's really because of our team acting immediately, it's because of us just trying to be as transparent as possible and doing everything we could to let everyone know that you need to remove that liquidity, that the user's funds are safe. So the good news is we are.
00:29:29.672 - 00:29:32.706, Speaker A: Resuming elastic in a couple of days.
00:29:32.808 - 00:29:55.180, Speaker B: So what's happened is we have looked through the code, we have updated the code, we are redeploying the smart contract. We had the white hacker, Dev, take a look through everything, and he okayed everything. We got a new smart contract audit, we'll get a second smart contract auditor in time. We are releasing a new official bug bounty program.
00:29:55.710 - 00:29:59.146, Speaker A: And lastly, we are announcing, we just.
00:29:59.248 - 00:30:02.142, Speaker B: Confirmed through the Kyber DaO, a fund.
00:30:02.196 - 00:30:03.678, Speaker A: That has been set aside from the.
00:30:03.684 - 00:30:11.070, Speaker B: DAO reserves, that is specifically to protect the funds on the protocol.
00:30:11.890 - 00:30:13.326, Speaker A: So I think these were all the.
00:30:13.348 - 00:30:26.126, Speaker B: Various things that we really looked at and said, okay, what can we do to improve the smart contract, to improve the security, to keep people more assured. And as well, when we resume, people feel, okay, this is all good, let's move forward.
00:30:26.248 - 00:30:29.142, Speaker A: So obviously the second thing aside, that.
00:30:29.196 - 00:30:41.334, Speaker B: Is to work with the chains, the protocols to relaunch the farms. So the first month of relaunch we will be doing like 100% boosted rewards for liquidity mining.
00:30:41.462 - 00:30:43.306, Speaker A: The second month will be 50% and.
00:30:43.328 - 00:30:46.038, Speaker B: Then the third month onwards as normal.
00:30:46.214 - 00:30:48.186, Speaker A: The other thing that I would like.
00:30:48.208 - 00:30:50.154, Speaker B: To mention is that for the rest.
00:30:50.192 - 00:30:51.994, Speaker A: Of the year we'll be releasing what.
00:30:52.032 - 00:31:03.566, Speaker B: We are going to call founder NFDs, which is when you interact with our LP, when you perform certain trades, when you interact with Kyber AI, there will.
00:31:03.588 - 00:31:07.130, Speaker A: Be certain mintable NFTs that you can mint.
00:31:07.210 - 00:31:12.782, Speaker B: That will be, well, a souvenir of you supporting and using Kyberswap.
00:31:12.846 - 00:31:19.682, Speaker A: And we're not promising anything at this point. But number one, we want to recognize.
00:31:19.746 - 00:31:24.566, Speaker B: All the OGs and the supporters of Kyberswap during all the difficult times and.
00:31:24.588 - 00:31:25.960, Speaker A: The good times as well.
00:31:26.890 - 00:31:34.266, Speaker B: Similar to what happened with Arbitrum, we had a bunch of users that swapped them arbitram with Kyberswap, we minted an.
00:31:34.288 - 00:31:37.994, Speaker A: Arbitrum Kyberswap NFT and we also just.
00:31:38.032 - 00:31:46.286, Speaker B: Airdropped those users a little token of KNC for appreciation as well. So I think these would be the.
00:31:46.308 - 00:31:50.030, Speaker A: Things that people will be looking forward to with our elastic resumption that happens.
00:31:50.100 - 00:31:52.394, Speaker B: Officially on 24th and then the farms.
00:31:52.522 - 00:31:54.960, Speaker A: Will start again on the 25 May.
00:31:56.610 - 00:32:54.766, Speaker C: Meet Stator labs, a noncustodial, multichain liquid staking platform with over 40,000 users across six chains, Stator is just about about to launch eFex, a decentralized liquid staking token on Ethereum, backed by some of the biggest names in crypto. Their multiple audits with top security firms, bug bounties, and real time monitoring are a testimony to their emphasis on security and safety. With a unique multipool architecture and tokenomics, Efex empowers stakers everywhere to run a node with as little as four e and earn 35% more than solo stakers. Sign up for their effects Alpha today and be the first to know about $1 million in staker rewards. Ethereum is fully decentralized, and liquidity is a shining example of decentralization. Liquidity is a nonupgradable protocol where users can deposit their ETH and take out a loan. Interest free users get their loans in LUSD, an unstoppable ethereum native stablecoin that is solely backed by ether.
00:32:54.766 - 00:33:02.406, Speaker C: You can use liquidity to buy real world assets or to earn yield across 20 plus places in DFI. More risk tolerant users can also use.
00:33:02.428 - 00:33:04.354, Speaker D: The protocol to lever up on their ETH.
00:33:04.402 - 00:33:16.810, Speaker C: With over 750,000,000 worth of ETH locked into liquidity's unstoppable contracts, get access to real DFI. DFI that's immutable capital, efficient, and fully decentralized. Learn more@liquidy.org.
00:33:21.730 - 00:34:25.130, Speaker G: I gotta say, Imran, I think that the way that Kyber handled that elastic amm situation was just kind of like a masterclass, to be honest. I think in our space, we're so juvenile sometimes, and some of the DeFi protocols are just kind of flat out embarrassing, and you saved everybody's hard earned money, and we're just very proactive and upfront and honest when you found something in the code. So kudos to you guys and the team for taking those measures and just protecting people's capital and kind of executing on it in such a professional way. So, yeah, just switching gears though, I do want to get into all of these awesome tooling products that I'm starting to see and hear about. I personally have been using the discover tool. It actually just pops up whenever I open my chrome browser. I kind of look at it as, like the front page of Defi.
00:34:25.130 - 00:34:41.734, Speaker G: Like, okay, let's see what's happening today, let's see what's moving, let's see where volume is going. And it kind of helps me establish the narrative of the day, to be honest. But maybe you can kind of describe more about it, how people use it.
00:34:41.852 - 00:34:42.182, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:42.236 - 00:34:46.930, Speaker B: So what you describe is our previous tool called Discover.
00:34:47.090 - 00:34:49.690, Speaker A: We're releasing kind of like a discover.
00:34:50.830 - 00:35:40.134, Speaker B: Version two, and we're calling it Kyber AI. And what's the thesis or the origin story of all of this is, I think, two things, right? So, one is that Defi is meant to provide people access and choice. And I think the flip side to access and choice is now I can go to Kyberswap and I could swap or trade or LP, like, one of any 10,000 tokens. That's a lot of tokens to look at. That's a lot of due diligence to do. Even the best analysts out there can realistically only handle a few dozen or maybe 100 tokens to really look at closely in a day. And what more a normal user.
00:35:40.134 - 00:35:58.126, Speaker B: So I think that was the first question we asked, right? Like, as a platform, our job really is to figure out how to help users make their life easier. How do we help them make better decisions? How do we distill insights for them.
00:35:58.308 - 00:36:00.654, Speaker A: So that they use less effort and.
00:36:00.692 - 00:36:02.874, Speaker B: Get more signal and less noise.
00:36:03.002 - 00:36:03.534, Speaker G: Right.
00:36:03.652 - 00:36:26.440, Speaker B: So that's the fundamental first question. I think the second part of it is that we have that position of building a Dex and aggregator, and we go through billions of volume, of course, lifetime. So there's a lot of data to handle, there's a lot of data to look through. So we kind of know that market inside out.
00:36:26.970 - 00:36:31.354, Speaker A: Our research team, which our research and.
00:36:31.392 - 00:36:40.746, Speaker B: Engineering team, they're really top class. They look at everything from zk research to privacy focused transactions and stuff that.
00:36:40.768 - 00:36:42.054, Speaker A: Are kind of like on the horizon.
00:36:42.102 - 00:36:44.442, Speaker B: Of what's going to happen in the future.
00:36:44.576 - 00:36:48.974, Speaker A: And they really look into it today so that we kind of figure out.
00:36:49.012 - 00:36:50.570, Speaker B: What can we build in the long term.
00:36:50.650 - 00:36:52.126, Speaker A: So one of the things that they.
00:36:52.148 - 00:37:06.166, Speaker B: Were building on is this tool, which really looks at primarily on chain metrics. So whether it's like things like the number of wallets interacted, the trading volume, the price trend line, so on and.
00:37:06.188 - 00:37:09.586, Speaker A: So forth, and that kind of created.
00:37:09.698 - 00:37:53.266, Speaker B: That function that you call discover, and that's really looking at a few on chain metrics that has a certain correlation to when a token trends after. So Kyber AI is going to release next week on the 29th as a beta. And I think the tool is really meant to help crypto traders kind of stay on top of the trends, the news, the tokens, in order to make better decisions. So what we look at is we have the centerpiece, it's called a Kyber score. So it's a score from zero to 100 for any token. So you could take a pepe or.
00:37:53.288 - 00:37:55.098, Speaker A: You could take a maddox, and there's.
00:37:55.134 - 00:37:59.160, Speaker B: A score at intervals of about 4 hours.
00:38:01.130 - 00:38:04.390, Speaker A: Where it gives a score where.
00:38:04.460 - 00:38:14.314, Speaker B: A higher score is more bullish and a lower score is more bearish. And if all goes well, in general.
00:38:14.432 - 00:38:16.506, Speaker A: You would have an indicator that says.
00:38:16.608 - 00:38:21.946, Speaker B: Very bullish, and then later on you would see the corresponding price action. Of course, it doesn't always happen that.
00:38:21.968 - 00:38:23.646, Speaker A: Way, because number one is not a.
00:38:23.668 - 00:38:29.514, Speaker B: Guarantee, number two is purely algorithmic. And then of course the market is irrational.
00:38:29.562 - 00:38:31.582, Speaker A: You never know what the token team.
00:38:31.636 - 00:38:34.462, Speaker B: Or the project team might do behind the scenes or will manipulator.
00:38:34.526 - 00:38:37.294, Speaker A: So of course there are many factors.
00:38:37.342 - 00:38:38.914, Speaker B: That still may be out of our.
00:38:38.952 - 00:38:42.180, Speaker A: Control, but it tends to give certain.
00:38:42.870 - 00:39:09.014, Speaker B: Predictive focus, forward looking type of insight into that token. So again, so this is called the Kyber score. This is on a scale of zero to 100. There are certain back tests that our research team has done. For example, looking at a strategy of deploying a certain amount of assets and then just purely using the Kyber score.
00:39:09.142 - 00:39:13.386, Speaker A: And then setting buy and sell limit.
00:39:13.418 - 00:39:26.002, Speaker B: Orders at 4% appreciation or 4% decline as a cut off, and doing certain historical or statistical analysis on whether it actually works or not.
00:39:26.056 - 00:39:33.314, Speaker A: Right. So I think so far the results are quite promising. Anecdotally, we already have a bunch of.
00:39:33.352 - 00:39:38.470, Speaker B: Alpha testers that are sharing some of the hey, I picked this up, it's already appreciated.
00:39:39.370 - 00:39:42.150, Speaker A: I saw this bearish signal and then.
00:39:42.300 - 00:39:54.646, Speaker B: Now the token completely dumped. So we have some of these anecdotal and I think the goal is to, over time, improve it with the feedback of the better users.
00:39:54.838 - 00:39:57.978, Speaker A: So I think that's the Kyber AI tool in general.
00:39:58.064 - 00:40:03.886, Speaker B: I think it's probably a tool of this time, right?
00:40:03.908 - 00:40:06.080, Speaker A: So I think AI is very much.
00:40:07.490 - 00:40:19.170, Speaker B: The talk of the town right now. What this is not is not a conversational bot. What this is not is not an auto trading bot. It's really focused on providing traders the insights.
00:40:19.670 - 00:40:22.590, Speaker A: But I think things like auto investing.
00:40:22.670 - 00:40:30.840, Speaker B: Trading bots or DCA bots are things that are still on our horizon that could potentially be built on top in the future.
00:40:31.450 - 00:41:13.006, Speaker D: Imran, is it fair to say then the discover tool that will be replaced by Kyber AI? It's basically the upgraded version of the Discover tool. It currently shows tokens that are discovered on and it shows like a date is the kyber score that upgrade where it actually tells us it's discovered whether it's bullish or bearish? Because when I've used the discover tool, I have many times said to nomadic, I don't know if this is being discovered because it's good or bad. It could be ready to dump versus something that looks more bullish on chain.
00:41:13.118 - 00:41:17.590, Speaker B: Yeah, so the background to that discover and is going to trend.
00:41:18.330 - 00:41:21.030, Speaker A: One of the things that the research.
00:41:21.100 - 00:41:46.414, Speaker B: Team was looking at is what is the correlation of on chain metrics that happen before that token trends? And what is the token trending? It is when you see the token being suggested to you as a trending token on Coingecko coin market cap, the question is how does it get there and what happens before it gets there, right?
00:41:46.452 - 00:41:48.122, Speaker A: So if it's going to be bullish.
00:41:48.266 - 00:41:57.940, Speaker B: By the time it's trending on coin market cap, it might be too late. But you're right, because it could trend for the wrong reasons as well.
00:41:58.310 - 00:42:01.394, Speaker A: So you're absolutely spot on here, where.
00:42:01.432 - 00:42:11.682, Speaker B: In terms of the kybus core, it goes a certain level further with regards to bullish or bearish but again, it's not a guarantee.
00:42:11.746 - 00:42:17.754, Speaker A: Right. So I think what some of the, anecdotally, some of the people that have.
00:42:17.792 - 00:42:40.762, Speaker B: Been testing out do is they complement it with looking at their own analysis on the social signals. What's happening with the project? They just announced something. Was there a vulnerability just discovered or are they just about to deploy a new version? I think some of these anticipated market events together with the on chain signals.
00:42:40.906 - 00:42:43.562, Speaker A: Kind of give a more complete story.
00:42:43.636 - 00:42:48.642, Speaker B: For some of the people to make a decision. Some of the things that adding on.
00:42:48.696 - 00:42:55.326, Speaker A: As metrics for the Kyber AI would be to look at things like the.
00:42:55.368 - 00:42:58.886, Speaker B: Top sex inflow, top sex outflow, top.
00:42:58.988 - 00:43:01.734, Speaker A: Holding wallet and stuff like that, again.
00:43:01.772 - 00:43:05.634, Speaker B: To give a bit more complete analysis and insight.
00:43:05.762 - 00:43:07.398, Speaker A: I think one of the things that.
00:43:07.404 - 00:43:09.178, Speaker B: We also looked at is how do.
00:43:09.184 - 00:43:13.354, Speaker A: We get various information that typically would.
00:43:13.392 - 00:43:18.138, Speaker B: Be strolled across a few different platforms, try to put it together?
00:43:18.224 - 00:43:20.606, Speaker A: The second thing is how do we.
00:43:20.628 - 00:43:23.438, Speaker B: Not just give you all that data.
00:43:23.524 - 00:43:26.814, Speaker A: And give you something that is some.
00:43:26.852 - 00:43:33.586, Speaker B: Sort of a filter or prioritization? And then I think that's really the Kybers call.
00:43:33.688 - 00:43:41.554, Speaker A: So I think from that point of view, again, the goal is to help users identify and shortlist. Right.
00:43:41.592 - 00:43:51.350, Speaker B: Because you have maybe on our tool right now, you'll be able to look at about more than 4000 tokens on seven different chains.
00:43:52.010 - 00:43:54.166, Speaker A: And again, it's not something that if.
00:43:54.188 - 00:44:04.506, Speaker B: You'Re an analyst, even if you're a top analyst, not something that you'd be able to go through hundreds and hundreds of tokens and provide that on chain analysis all at the same time.
00:44:04.688 - 00:44:06.986, Speaker A: So I think the whole goal is.
00:44:07.008 - 00:44:13.870, Speaker B: To really simplify life and then at the end of the day, USA as users need to make that final decision.
00:44:14.690 - 00:44:34.260, Speaker G: Imran, I'm personally pretty excited about this Kyber AI. Few questions though that are coming to like say this outputs a bullish or bearish score. What kind of timeframe roughly are we looking at here? Is that hours, days, weeks?
00:44:35.770 - 00:44:38.662, Speaker A: Again, I think there's no promise, but.
00:44:38.796 - 00:45:08.558, Speaker B: The outlook is definitely short term. So the signal here for Kybersko is a short term indicator. It's not meant, for example, to tell you to hold all this to the moon. This is definitely not that I've seen personally where it can take a token from very bullish to very bearish in less than 24 hours. So we've seen that before, but it also turns again after.
00:45:08.644 - 00:45:08.894, Speaker C: Right.
00:45:08.932 - 00:45:23.410, Speaker B: So it's really possible to have all colors of the winds even for a single token. And sometimes, I guess that's crypto and that's each individual project as well.
00:45:23.560 - 00:45:25.814, Speaker A: So what I would say is, for.
00:45:25.852 - 00:45:57.434, Speaker B: Example, for someone that wants to make a certain trade or punt, they need to know what their plan is if they do want to buy a token. I think for sophisticated traders, they have their own trading strategies and stuff. People who are going in their first day in crypto or their first day trading, probably a smart thing to do is to really think around what they want to do. What is my sell price, what is my cut stop loss price? So on and so forth.
00:45:57.482 - 00:45:57.694, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:57.732 - 00:46:13.460, Speaker B: So for example, with Kyberswap, you can set limit orders. So I could discover a token. I can buy the token on spot, or I could buy a token, hypothetically, if it dips at a certain price, and I can set a sell order after as well.
00:46:15.510 - 00:46:20.086, Speaker A: So I would say go in with a plan with what you want to do.
00:46:20.188 - 00:46:23.510, Speaker B: And I think that's really based on short term trading.
00:46:24.170 - 00:46:26.774, Speaker A: Even for me personally, I'm a lot.
00:46:26.812 - 00:46:37.174, Speaker B: Less of a short term trader and a lot more of a farmer myself. But as a platform we have all sorts of users of all types of inclinations.
00:46:37.302 - 00:47:01.550, Speaker G: One other quick one here, we were kind of talking before we started taping about how this AI was trained, and I believe it's trained on, I think you said, over like $98 billion worth of trade volume from hyperswap history. But correct me if I'm wrong, can you just kind of give listeners a quick overview of where this AI is getting its data and how it's trained?
00:47:01.630 - 00:47:01.826, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:01.848 - 00:47:04.082, Speaker B: So the data for our machine learning.
00:47:04.136 - 00:47:10.482, Speaker A: Algorithm was fed through our previous lifetime volume of trading.
00:47:10.546 - 00:47:18.810, Speaker B: So our decks has facilitated right now more than 19 billion of trading volume.
00:47:19.150 - 00:47:20.922, Speaker A: So again, that's a lot of data.
00:47:20.976 - 00:47:31.722, Speaker B: To sift through, a lot of data to look at. So that's what our research engineers and analysts did in terms of building that model.
00:47:31.856 - 00:47:35.834, Speaker D: Imran, how can we get our hands on the Kyber AI beta?
00:47:35.962 - 00:47:44.158, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's going to be a waitlist. The whole intention is over time to turn it into a premium or a premium product.
00:47:44.244 - 00:47:45.986, Speaker A: So anyone that's coming in early with.
00:47:46.008 - 00:47:56.100, Speaker B: The beta waitlist or the whitelist will be able to get full access for free as we improve on this. Right, so you just need to hit on hyperswap.com.
00:47:56.490 - 00:48:00.006, Speaker A: The whitelisting or waitlist will be live.
00:48:00.188 - 00:48:02.246, Speaker B: By the 29 May.
00:48:02.428 - 00:48:06.886, Speaker A: And that's when you can drop in your wallet your email in order to.
00:48:06.908 - 00:48:08.550, Speaker B: Sign up for the waitlist.
00:48:08.970 - 00:48:10.822, Speaker A: I think the only issue is that.
00:48:10.876 - 00:48:16.870, Speaker B: We want to release it in controlled batches so that we get quality feedback.
00:48:16.950 - 00:48:19.146, Speaker A: We can improve it and over time.
00:48:19.248 - 00:48:21.494, Speaker B: We will proceed into a public launch.
00:48:21.622 - 00:48:24.094, Speaker A: So I think the upside here is.
00:48:24.132 - 00:48:28.314, Speaker B: That if you are early you'll get earlier slot into the waitlist.
00:48:28.362 - 00:48:30.814, Speaker A: If you're still waiting then you just.
00:48:30.852 - 00:48:32.446, Speaker B: Need to kind of refer a couple.
00:48:32.468 - 00:48:34.286, Speaker A: Of friends to the waitlist and then.
00:48:34.308 - 00:48:37.250, Speaker B: You kind of skip a few spots in the queue.
00:48:37.750 - 00:48:40.994, Speaker A: So I think you kind of see those kind of mechanisms for example when.
00:48:41.032 - 00:48:44.866, Speaker B: Notion or notion AI launched their beta as well.
00:48:44.968 - 00:48:50.214, Speaker A: So I think that's in terms of releasing the Kyber AI and it will.
00:48:50.252 - 00:48:55.510, Speaker B: Eventually turn into a public launch which will eventually turn into a paid product.
00:48:55.660 - 00:49:05.686, Speaker D: Imran, earlier you mentioned turning on some new fees through Kyber. Can you just share a bit more about what that'll mean for the revenue model for Kyber network?
00:49:05.798 - 00:49:06.634, Speaker B: Absolutely right.
00:49:06.672 - 00:49:08.986, Speaker A: So I think because we are a.
00:49:09.008 - 00:49:28.134, Speaker B: Multiproduct platform, before this we've only ever taken fees via the pools. So from the pool fees you have a certain portion that goes back to the LPs and you have a certain portion that goes back to Dao. Moving forward we will be reviewing what goes back to the DAO.
00:49:28.202 - 00:49:29.778, Speaker A: We might increase it because we are.
00:49:29.784 - 00:49:32.894, Speaker B: Still taking less than many other protocols.
00:49:33.022 - 00:49:35.826, Speaker A: The second thing that's happened, which we're.
00:49:35.858 - 00:50:01.690, Speaker B: Very happy about is we have taken positive slippage surpluses from aggregator. So we don't charge an aggregator fee, but the positive slippage surpluses allows us to maintain the user benefit. So I swap. I agree to a rate, I still get that rate. But if there's any positive slippage, Kyberswap tips it. That turns into a revenue stream for us.
00:50:01.760 - 00:50:03.878, Speaker A: And it's estimated that there will be.
00:50:03.904 - 00:50:06.222, Speaker B: A good seven figure or multiple seven.
00:50:06.276 - 00:50:11.934, Speaker A: Figure revenue in a year. I think we just talked about Kyber AI. I think the intention there over time.
00:50:11.972 - 00:50:19.906, Speaker B: Is to build it into a paid subscription model which is not unlike what you'd see some of the other crypto tools out there as well.
00:50:20.008 - 00:50:21.442, Speaker A: So I think there is this every.
00:50:21.496 - 00:50:27.590, Speaker B: Intention to really turn Kyberswap not just into a usable product, not just into.
00:50:27.660 - 00:50:31.510, Speaker A: Something that's an OG builder, but really.
00:50:31.580 - 00:50:40.322, Speaker B: A very sustainable long term protocol that's here to stay really built on the back of revenue and sustainability.
00:50:40.466 - 00:50:54.862, Speaker D: Hey, this is probably a great place for us to wrap. But before we do, what can we look forward to next? You mentioned a ZK sync deployment. When again is that coming? And then any other future aggregator integrations we can look forward to?
00:50:54.996 - 00:50:59.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the first thing is as a trader you can look forward.
00:50:59.396 - 00:51:02.046, Speaker B: To cross chain swaps with Kyberswap, and.
00:51:02.068 - 00:51:05.440, Speaker A: That'S going to happen within the next week.
00:51:05.970 - 00:51:16.500, Speaker B: So this happens with integration with Axelr, which is a cross chain swap protocol. You have elastic that's coming up again this week.
00:51:17.190 - 00:51:20.358, Speaker A: Zkasing deployment will be happening within, I.
00:51:20.364 - 00:51:21.880, Speaker B: Think, the next three weeks.
00:51:22.410 - 00:51:24.534, Speaker A: I think to kind of really look.
00:51:24.572 - 00:51:33.130, Speaker B: At this from a very holistic perspective, we are really continuing our march towards our goal to be a top three D five protocol.
00:51:33.470 - 00:51:36.550, Speaker A: So from that end, there's really rewards.
00:51:36.630 - 00:52:14.482, Speaker B: Abound, from the LM rewards to the founders NFDs that we're minting as a whole ecosystem. We have about 17.79 million KNC allocated by Kyber Dow for all the various incentives, trading, liquidity and otherwise. We also have a lot of chain foundation incentives, things like Arbitrum foundation allocation. That's about 1.16 million arc. We have op allocation, we have Avax allocation, and we have allocations with partners as well, like Lido finance.
00:52:14.482 - 00:52:20.570, Speaker B: So all of this, we don't keep all of this like 100% goes into user rewards.
00:52:20.910 - 00:52:22.586, Speaker A: So I think that's something that we.
00:52:22.608 - 00:52:27.990, Speaker B: Are very happy to always share with users that, hey, a lot of these rewards are up for grabs.
00:52:28.070 - 00:52:30.934, Speaker A: And really, we want to give it.
00:52:30.992 - 00:52:38.778, Speaker B: As much as possible to good users who are really active in Defi, who are active Kyberswap.
00:52:38.954 - 00:52:40.938, Speaker A: And that's what's happening with the relaunch.
00:52:40.954 - 00:52:43.700, Speaker B: Of elastic and all our liquidity mining this week.
00:52:44.470 - 00:53:06.120, Speaker D: Well, I'm looking forward to the relaunch because I've participated in quite a few of those rewards programs, especially the arbitram ones, and written up quite a few tutorials for that. So excited to see that return. Imran, in case folks want to follow you or get involved in Kyber, what would you recommend?
00:53:06.810 - 00:53:16.380, Speaker B: So follow Kyber network on Twitter, which is Kyber network. You can also join our official discord as well.
00:53:16.750 - 00:53:27.760, Speaker A: You can find myself, I think Defydat and Nomadic will probably put in my handle right in the description, which is Imran, fast start.
00:53:28.690 - 00:53:30.186, Speaker B: That's at Twitter.
00:53:30.378 - 00:53:33.402, Speaker A: And I think you'll find anything that's.
00:53:33.466 - 00:53:36.020, Speaker B: Announced will come from Twitter first.
00:53:36.550 - 00:53:38.066, Speaker A: But of course, you should head over.
00:53:38.088 - 00:53:41.506, Speaker B: To kyberswap.com to check out everything that.
00:53:41.528 - 00:53:52.840, Speaker A: We'Re talking about in terms of the product, the campaigns, the rewards, and anything that's announced or anything that you want to deep dive. You can find it in our blogs and our docs as well.
