00:00:00.250 - 00:00:36.310, Speaker A: This is the d five download at permissionless 2022, brought to you by Bancor. I'm here joined by Mark Richardson and Nate Hyman from Bancor. So, guys, I wanted to talk a bit about Bancorp V three. Obviously, you just launched the first phase of it, so you've got four pools out it. I have been a longtime user of your single sided LPs, which offer impermanent loss protection. What's new with V three? Like, if you were to summarize that for the average DFI user?
00:00:37.290 - 00:01:35.130, Speaker B: Yeah. So Bangkok version 2.1, as you know, as a user, had impermanent loss protection and single sided staking. Right? And these were sort of huge innovations for Amms for its time, but it wasn't without friction. The size of the liquidity pools could be allowed to grow with cap, and the insurance vesting was defined over a 100 day period. And so with Bancorp version three, I think two of the most important user facing features are the fact that that IL protection is now instantaneous, you don't have to wait 100 days to be protected, and that there is no bottleneck to providing as much liquidity as you want. Bancorp version three can accept unlimited deposits, and it's because of a very clever way that we partition the liquidity that the protocol has available to it that allows it to manage that il risk in an extremely sustainable way.
00:01:35.280 - 00:02:43.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember, I want to say it was November 2020. That's when I first deposited into a Bancorp single sided LP. I honestly thought I would go in and I would get out of it within 100 days. I actually remember setting my calendar, withdraw in 100 days, and to date, I think it's the longest LP I've ever been in, actually, multiple LPs now that I've continued to stay in. Part of the reason was just the fact that with liquidity provisions, I've always been used to knowing that the volatility brings lots of trading fees, which is great, but it also brings a lot of pain in terms of impermanent loss. And so, yeah, with V three, you really solved for a number of issues that we were feeling as users. One of those was the cap, which, in a good way, you filled up all of these limited single sided LPs, like, there was only so much limited liquidity or limited deposits that were allowed.
00:02:43.738 - 00:03:00.770, Speaker A: But then the 100 days is now just a seven day withdraw. So there's also a zero point 25% withdraw fee. Can you tell me more about what's the reason for that? Is that to prevent someone from exploiting or attacking that protocol.
00:03:00.850 - 00:03:52.902, Speaker B: Yeah, it's exactly right. So I'm going to publish a paper that explores some of the mathematics behind Bangkok version three design. But yeah, essentially, the withdrawal fee is a necessary component that kind of powers that withdrawal mechanism. And it essentially means that it's impossible to create a situation where, like an Mevbot, for example, might provide liquidity and then try and instantly withdraw it in order to create a situation where they can close an arbitrage opportunity or something and therefore extract more value from the protocol than they put in. And so that zero point 25% withdrawal fee is effectively this kind of buffer zone that the protocol uses to determine which part of the withdrawal algorithm it should commit to based on the size of the user's withdrawal. So, yeah, it's a necessary component of the withdrawal algorithm. It can be set to zero.
00:03:52.902 - 00:04:40.466, Speaker B: By the way, if the Bancor Dow decides that there should be no withdrawal fee, that's fine, but we just lose some of that really interesting utility that we get from having it there in the first place. So, for example, on Bancorp version 2.1, if there's like, Il in your position, you basically are guaranteed that your position is going to be refunded, at least partially in BNT to kind of make you whole as a liquidity provider on Bancorp version three. That's not always true. Even if you've got il in your position, you can withdraw your LP and get 100% the token that you stake. And the reason that that's possible is because of that withdrawal fee and some of the magic that happens behind the scenes in order to make financial sense. So I think that it's a minor inconvenience.
00:04:40.466 - 00:04:54.374, Speaker B: But what you get out of it is that users who are providing whatever Tkn that they've provided, withdrawing only that TkN, it just removes a huge amount of friction. So I think that I concede that it's not ideal.
00:04:54.422 - 00:04:54.634, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:54.672 - 00:05:22.046, Speaker B: No one likes to have a withdrawal fee, but it's so small compared to the overall volatility of crypto markets in general. On a Tuesday, your position might change by 20% or more. So zero point 25% at the end of a yield accumulating period. It just seems like such a small price to pay for that added peace of mind that the token that you're withdrawing most likely is going to be 100% the token that you provided.
00:05:22.158 - 00:06:23.190, Speaker A: Yeah. I have sometimes thought about these single sided LPs almost like a vault. And because obviously, most of us have been LPs in like a uniswap, where we're pairing a token with whatever other token, two tokens together. When I deposit my single token, you're basically taking it, pairing it with BNT market making, but then you're essentially taking the hit on the impermanent loss. And what's been interesting is, and I think it was kind of a bold bet in November 2020. We had just lived through DFI summer, and there was a lot of talk about whether that was the top of the market. And I think what's been interesting is you've sort of proven that this model works in a very volatile bull run, where you're earning so much in trading fees for BNC holders that it's essentially compensating for any sort of impermanent loss.
00:06:23.190 - 00:07:21.558, Speaker A: So I've tended to think of it as like the Bancorp, Dow, and BNT holders, just in general, but is taking the other side of that bet. I'm lending my one token, I'm calling myself an LP, but really, I'm just lending a single token. And then you're doing all that magic under the hood for me, which at this point, with V three is radical, because now I can truly withdraw. I've got a seven day delay. But that's nothing compared to V two, where it took 100 days for me to reach that threshold to have the privilege of having 100% impermanent loss protection. So another part of Bancorp v three is the dual rewards, which is designed to allow someone to create a liquidity mining rewards program, but powered by Bancorp v three. So can either of you kind of walk me through how does that work, the dual rewards mechanism?
00:07:21.654 - 00:08:17.930, Speaker B: Yeah. So the dual rewards is kind of referring to this early promotional period where we want everyone to get really excited by Bancorp version three, where the Bancord Dow is willing to continue to incentivize liquidity provision with the BNT token, as it always has, which is also healthy for the BNT token distribution. And so it's a perfectly healthy thing to do. But the reason why you can have two rewards at once is because Bancor version three supports third parties providing their own liquidity mine incentives. But what's special about third parties participating in their own liquidity incentives is that it can be executed in an auto compounding and gasless fashion. And so how this is done, it benefits both the community and the project that's doing it. And so, for example, imagine that you are a new token project, and you've got like a $200,000 budget for liquidity mining, for example.
00:08:17.930 - 00:08:36.898, Speaker B: Now, over the course of a liquidity mining campaign on something like sushi swap or Uniswap or the standard sort of staking contract. The idea is that these tokens that you're providing to users as incentives are slowly sort of trickled into the market and end up as sticky liquidity. Now whether or not that's a good assumption or not is not something that.
00:08:36.904 - 00:09:18.670, Speaker A: We have to actually, to add context there. I think that this is a part of what's been broken with liquidity mining. You stake the LP, so by the way, you're wasting all that gas to just doing like added actions. And then you have to go and claim separately the Tokens. Then if you wanted to LP and compound the LP, you have to take that token, which you might even sell 50% of it just to create the LP. It's a lot of stuff that people don't want to have to do. Whereas in the V three dual reward system, first off, I'm benefiting from the liquidity that is added, that is the rewards itself.
00:09:18.670 - 00:10:07.470, Speaker A: So that's sitting in the pool. Then as an LP, as I earn it, I'm accruing that reward, but I don't have to go claim it, waste all the gas money on it. And then also at the end of the day, it's just the fact that it is compounding it, so I'm earning more. It's really like, to be clear, I have studied this so much and obviously talked with you guys so much about this because as a power user using those single sided LPs, it has always felt like it's too good to be true. And I think the truth is that you've just solved for a bunch of really difficult problems. It doesn't come without any risk, which we'll talk about in a moment. Is there anything else you think worth noting there about the V three features that I just mentioned?
00:10:07.540 - 00:11:22.194, Speaker C: I guess that point you just made about the current process for, let's say, auto compounding rewards and the way rewards are currently set up, it's no wonder that most altcoins are bleeding versus L1 token. So if you think about the process when that auto compounding happens, right, the token project is minting new tokens and then in order for it to get auto compounded, if you're using a third party auto compounder, it's just getting like auto liquidated back into E. So it's like there's no with how prevalent rewards have been and how people have all of a sudden picked up on them being totally unsustainable and really broken for the token projects, it's no wonder that these charts look the way they do versus the L1 tokens, because it's like structurally built in to the first generation of mining rewards. And so we really think that this is going to know in the same way that synthetics and compound set off defi summer, through the original form of yield farming and mining rewards. We feel like this new version could offer that to the market by saying the rewards exist as liquidity from day one in the pool. They don't need to be auto liquidated in order to be auto compounded. And that's really because of the single sided nature of the pool.
00:11:22.194 - 00:11:25.554, Speaker C: They can be reconstituted because it's single sided.
00:11:25.602 - 00:12:28.774, Speaker A: Another point to make is, in traditional liquidity mining, we tend to reward the total value of the LP, but here we're only rewarding the single token that you're depositing, which I've always thought it's like, okay, yeah, we're spending 50% less, ideally, than the way it works otherwise. So at the end of the day, you're allowing someone to be an LP, continue to earn rewards, but just let it passively sit and accrue that and continue, which I can speak to my own experience. If you allow me to continually compound and earn more without doing anything, I am way more likely to do that. Whereas when I know that I have to go claim that reward token, I'm always thinking, how much is that reward token worth? Should I claim it now? Should I then zap it and sell 50% of it into the LP? And so there's a lot of good behavior that I'm hoping results from this new release.
00:12:28.902 - 00:13:27.898, Speaker C: A bigger issue, if you think about the people who are left standing inside of Amms today, because most token holders have realized, if I'm long on an asset and I really care about it, I probably shouldn't put it in a liquidity pool, given the risk I face with impermanent loss. And the people who are left standing are these sort of like institutional mercenary yield farmers who go from high APR pool to high APR pool. And so as a token project, you end up dumping your rewards on people that are just like these mercenary farmers and aren't necessarily your long term holders. Now, with Bancorp, because people know it's single sided, you're fully protected from Il. It really attracts your token holders to your pool. So you end up dumping rewards on people who are most inclined and who are interested to continue holding. So I think that that's like an underrated component of it is that you're really giving it to people who are least likely to dump it, unlike traditional Ams.
00:13:27.994 - 00:13:57.926, Speaker A: One last question. Obviously, we've covered all the benefits of bank for a V three, and I'm clearly a fan as a user, but it doesn't come at zero cost. So can you talk me through what are some of the risks and then maybe some of the precautions that the Bancorp protocol would take if there was like a major BNT sell off or I guess, any other sort of major threat to the way that single sided LPs work?
00:13:58.028 - 00:14:49.234, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. The threats are real. And I think one of the things that distinguishes Bangkok from some other protocols that have failed recently is that we aren't ignoring that these threats are there. We are aware of them, we acknowledge them, and we are constantly building new systems. We are hiring economists, actuaries to help us manage the risk of the protocol, just like any insurance company would. And so it's not the case that things are ever going to be entirely devoid of risk, but you can still manage it effectively over time. And if it was impossible to do that, then the insurance sector in traditional finance just wouldn't exist.
00:14:49.234 - 00:14:55.258, Speaker B: And so we have hundreds of years of precedent to base the type of product that was built on.
00:14:55.344 - 00:14:55.642, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:55.696 - 00:15:08.142, Speaker B: It's not like as an AMM protocol and as a DeFi protocol, it is very innovative what we're doing. And I don't want to sort of belittle what was made, but in terms of economic theory, insurance is really old.
00:15:08.276 - 00:15:08.622, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:08.676 - 00:15:44.218, Speaker B: It's not like we have to reinvent quantum physics or something to offer the product that we have. All we need to do is study what is already known about these things and then apply those learnings from traditional finance to DeFi. It is difficult. These things are extremely complex. And because it is a decentralized, autonomous organization, we also need to make sure that the voters understand how to evaluate these risks and how to manage the protocol. And so these are very significant challenges. But I'm confident that we can overcome them because we are staring them in the face.
00:15:44.304 - 00:15:44.554, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:44.592 - 00:16:16.154, Speaker B: We are facing them down. I think that the biggest mistakes of some of the cryptocurrency leaders that have seen their protocols collapse is that they treat themselves as being invulnerable or that their protocol is too big to fail. Right. And that by refusing to acknowledge that those systemic risks are there, they do nothing to prevent them. And then that's when you accidentally break your protocol or your protocol breaks itself. So we're not doing that. We're constantly, luck favors the paranoid.
00:16:16.154 - 00:17:11.800, Speaker B: We're constantly analyzing what's going wrong and whether or not the protocol is behaving correctly, and whether or not the economics make sense and developing better systems of monitoring those things. And eventually, we're going to roll out a whole analysis suite and expose that to the community that's actually going to write its own proposals. Right. We want to create an AI that does the economic analysis every week and then provides kind of a checkup for the community to vote on. That just becomes a part of the Dow process. And we can have economists and guests constantly come in and sort of opine on what it is that our system is doing and whether or not it's good enough and constantly develop it. But, yeah, the risk will never go away, but that's okay, because I think that we can still manage it well.
00:17:12.170 - 00:17:22.300, Speaker A: So we've talked a lot about how Bancorp is benefiting DFI users, but how is Bancorp three specifically benefiting the industry in general?
00:17:23.310 - 00:18:17.082, Speaker B: Yeah, there's more than one answer that I could give to this question. But what I want to sort of reiterate is that we have developed a way that you can now incentivize liquidity without driving your token price into the ground. And this is addressing a really systemic issue that I think has plagued all of DeFi since DeFi summer. But even things like the single sided staking paradigm means that Dao treasuries can be staked without having to sell half of it for ETH, or know to deposit both sides of the pool simultaneously. And for legal reasons, there are some dows that even can't sell half their treasury for ETH in order to provide liquidity with it. So in terms of dows themselves becoming liquidity providers on Bancor, it's something that we've seen catch on in quite a profound way.
00:18:17.136 - 00:18:18.234, Speaker C: I've been a part of this.
00:18:18.352 - 00:18:42.722, Speaker A: I forget Nexus mutual, we voted to deposit, we wrapped some NXM and dropped it in. And it makes all the sense in the world because we're deepening liquidity, but we're not having to pair the LP, we're not having to sell any of our own token. Yeah, I cannot imagine more dows would not benefit from that, because what else are you supposed to do with your token at that point? Yeah.
00:18:42.776 - 00:19:28.834, Speaker B: And so there have been a handful of attempts to address this kind of liquidity problem that dows face. And I'm not going to name any of these protocols on this podcast, but a lot of the conversations that I've had from token teams using some of those solutions, let's say they were very disappointed with the results, basically. And it was listening to those stories and actually sort of getting feedback not from users, but from builders somewhere else in the industry at what they need an amm to be. And so Bangkok versions three really isn't just an amalgamation of all the user feedback that we've had, but also all the team feedback that we've had.
00:19:29.032 - 00:20:17.666, Speaker C: And I think that's been proven out in the launch, which just happened last week. It's only four pools live today, but in the coming weeks there'll be 150 plus pools that we had in B 2.1 going live in B three. And so for the launch partners to launch, we had everyone from synthetics to wire to engine nexus who are providing dow treasury capital to increase the liquidity of their token, to get passive yield on it without having to worry about impermanent loss, repairing it. And also a really cool thing that's going to become more apparent to the industry as this is live for a little bit, is we've brought back pool tokens to the system. So in B 2.1, when you deposit liquidity, your pool token was immediately deposited into a protection contract which offered the protection that we give.
00:20:17.666 - 00:20:52.070, Speaker C: But the pool token, your position was not fungible. And so now we've brought back pool tokens. You can deposit liquidity and get back a pool token. And what's different about these than other pool tokens, let's say unique pool token or a sushi pool token, is it can't drop below the value of its underlying asset. So because of impermanent loss in most pool tokens, it can be worth less than the underlying assets. But this becomes a very interesting sort of defi money, Lego or piece of collateral. When it's protected against Il and can't drop below, it becomes a sort of up only pool token.
00:20:52.070 - 00:21:37.562, Speaker C: And all of a sudden we're seeing projects actually saying, okay, well, we can use this pool token, let's say, as a governance token to do voting, or as the native staking collateral inside our protocol. And all of a sudden their holders don't have to decide between natively staking their assets and providing liquidity to it. Because if all your assets are natively staked and your liquidity completely dries up, it can create a lot of instability in your token, be less desirable for people to hold it because they can't liquidate without massive slippage or affecting the price. So native staking and liquidity provision kind of wrapped up in these fungible single sided Il protected pool tokens, we think is going to be a massive innovation that can really kind of.
00:21:37.616 - 00:22:31.270, Speaker A: Yeah, this is something I want to see more of the dows that I'm invested in, participate in, because we're clearly in a bear market now, or at least we're in a downtrend. And those tokens that sit in these massive treasuries, they're just not getting used. When really, in a downtrend, you want to have as deep a liquidity as possible. And I want to find as many ways to make use of that liquidity while we're in this downtrend, while we're building, while we're trying to continue to support all the stuff that you do as a protocol. And so, yeah, I almost forgot about this just because there's so much I've been focused on as your average D five investor. But, yeah, dows should not be holding on to these enormous amounts of tokens. They should be finding a way to make that productive.
00:22:31.350 - 00:23:14.586, Speaker C: People have been talking about super fluid liquidity for a while, theory that is like two or three years old at this point. And because liquidity pools were kind of affected by impermanent loss, it really hasn't come to fruition. We think this could finally kind of create super fluid liquidity that can exist sort of two different places. We're really at a time right now in DFI where I think everyone is just, like, feeling a lot of pain. Crypto is hurting. And this is a pretty timely time for Bancorp V three, our biggest protocol update in the first DFI protocol ever to launch, that we hope we can sort of remind the industry that there are builders still building and bears are for building. Right.
00:23:14.586 - 00:23:30.062, Speaker C: And there's still so much left to do in terms of innovation in detox. And so I hope that Bancorp V three is a sort of reminder of that. It's just industry is moving forward, and there's, like, bright days, bright days ahead.
00:23:30.196 - 00:23:47.710, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, guys, thanks so much for joining me, and congrats on V three. When is the next phase of V three going to launch? Because right now the four pools are link, Dai, BNT, and E. So I guess, yeah. What is that next phase of the launch?
00:23:47.790 - 00:24:53.642, Speaker C: Yeah, so the Dow will vote soon on when we want to deploy full launch in terms of the 150 plus tokens that are whitelisted, v 2.1 that will then immediately go live, or at least are being proposed to all go live at the same time, and that will be sort of full. No restraints, v three, no caps, on the pools, all the features that you get from day one, and we can really start to see this thing kind of perform in an amazing way. And also at the time when those pools go live, you'll see the rewards get activated on them, too. So LPs will be collecting dual sided rewards that are protected from Il. We think the yield will be super competitive in the industry and it'll be sort of just a safer, simpler way to stake this sort of high yield savings account product that people have been really dying for, I'd say, in crypto and DFI, I think will really come to fruition in this launch. So I would say within a week to weeks of having that sort of full network launch go live.
00:24:53.642 - 00:25:16.686, Speaker C: And, yeah, it'll be pretty awesome to watch. We're already at about 300 million in Tbl, just after a few days in a down market when in the initial phase, gas costs were spiking during the dumping, and now we've already seen a good amount of liquidity move over. We think once the full network launch goes live past the four pools, it'll just be off to the race.
00:25:16.798 - 00:25:33.590, Speaker A: Well, once you guys are fully launched with V three, I'm just excited because I would anticipate you're going to move to an L two, which I'm dying for us to move to an l two despite all the gas efficiency improvement. Anyways, congrats on V three, though, and thanks for joining.
00:25:35.290 - 00:25:36.982, Speaker C: Appreciate all your support along the way.
00:25:37.036 - 00:25:42.454, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, no problem. I'm still in those LPs. That's not like I'm still in those.
00:25:42.492 - 00:25:43.400, Speaker C: I've been in those.
00:25:45.530 - 00:25:53.340, Speaker A: 18 months. What is that? Yeah, almost coming up on two years. So pretty mean I got to just migrate over once she makes that available.
