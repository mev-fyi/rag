00:00:00.090 - 00:00:55.454, Speaker A: The idea that was proposed was, okay, how do we try to get rid of mercenary farming? Tvl so people just coming to radiant because the yields are very high and just moving away once the yields compress. Well, one of the options and that has moved through, and it's the way V two is working, is basically meeting a threshold of the amount of liquidity you provide with respect to your deposits. So to make it very simple, if you have 1000, as we said before, $1,000 deposited worth of ETH, you have to meet a 5% threshold. That means that you need $50 worth of DLP tokens. So providing liquidity and locking those tokens, once you go above that threshold, you not only continue earning protocol fees, as I said before, 60% of the share, but you start earning a boost in radiant emissions, you basically become eligible to earn radiant emissions. And it's something think we colloquially termed D five 3.0. So we don't want to be D five 1.0
00:00:55.454 - 00:00:59.420, Speaker A: as in 99% of protocols have been formed to zero.
