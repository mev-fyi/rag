00:00:03.210 - 00:00:41.702, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi. Dad. Hey, thanks for joining and us. It's Tuesday, March 29, 2022. I've got a special two guests for us today. We'll be talking with Andrew Trudeau, who is a core contributor at Quinta. And then we have the founder of synthetics, the godfather of yield farming, Kane Warwick.
00:00:41.702 - 00:00:43.786, Speaker A: So, guys, welcome. How are you doing?
00:00:43.968 - 00:01:00.320, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks. One minor quibble. I feel like you need to update the intro to L 222 instead of 2022. That's just one minor point of order.
00:01:00.770 - 00:01:31.980, Speaker A: Absolutely. Whatever you say, godfather. Thank you. It's funny because, of course, before we got started, I was mentioning to the guys, I definitely want you to give your background, but I do kind of laugh at anyone who is not familiar with synthetics or Kane. So why don't we go by OG status Kane, just in case anyone's new to DFI or learning about synthetics and Quinta for the first time, just a little bit about your background and all the work you've done over the last several years.
00:01:32.670 - 00:02:19.180, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, we started the project back in 2017. It was originally a stablecoin project. We kind of pivoted into this synthetic asset platform. We, over the last, I guess, whatever it is, four or five years, have pushed a bunch of different things like yield farming and some of the decentralized governance structures that we see today. So, yeah, synthetics has always been kind of on the forefront of experimentation, and one of the experiments that is still, I guess, playing out is this kind of subdao concept of splitting out one of the functions of synthetics into its own independent project. And that's how Quinta kind of came about.
00:02:20.030 - 00:02:41.790, Speaker A: Awesome. And, Andrew, do you want to share a bit about your background? Actually, I've never learned about what you were working on beforehand. And there's so many projects that have emerged from the synthetics community over the last several years. I mean, I used to work at Zapper, and that was born out of synthetics. So, yeah. Andrew, what was your background?
00:02:42.130 - 00:03:32.110, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So I've been in the deFi space for probably about, I think, since its inception, like, when people started using the term deFi and is originally exploring recurring payments in cryptocurrency and even baskets of cryptocurrency. And then, yeah, slowly transitioned into more of the core projects that were working in DeFi. And SNX was definitely the most attractive to me, and then I've been here ever since. So for a little over a year now, almost two years, and then, yeah, started working with how we could refine synthetics, the exchange, and how we could kind of grow that community into something that was, like, flourishing, and quickly saw that there was an opportunity to maybe do something one step further where we could spin out, coincidence, its own project, that it could thrive, have its own sort of life, and potentially even achieve its goals in a way that synthetics exchange couldn't. So, yeah, that's me.
00:03:32.260 - 00:03:51.430, Speaker A: Yeah. So you started to give some of the background to this, but maybe if either of you can talk a little bit more about maybe, like, where synthetics left off and that sort of need for quenta. And then, of course, I'd love to talk, really, just for the rest of the time, about the new futures product with ten x leverage.
00:03:53.530 - 00:03:55.126, Speaker C: Don't take this one or me.
00:03:55.308 - 00:03:56.678, Speaker B: Yeah, you go ahead.
00:03:56.844 - 00:04:37.806, Speaker C: Great. So, originally, a lot of people were associating synthetics as an exchange. It was just kind of treated as like a dex, I think, in a lot of the narrative, but it was much, much more than that. It's more of like a foundational layer for developers to build on top of with synthetic assets, and a general liquidity protocol to experiment with and to separate synthetics. The exchange with synthetics, the protocol we created, Quinta, which had separate branding, a separate narrative entirely about exchange and defi. And, yeah, just targeted it with being powered by synthetics and having synthetic assets for spot futures, shorting, et cetera. And now we're seeing kind of like that come to fruition now with synthetic.
00:04:37.806 - 00:04:48.142, Speaker C: Perpetual futures recently launched. So it's kind of reached that end of the timeline of where it originally was splitting out. And now it's really come into its own as a project that can stand on its own legs.
00:04:48.306 - 00:05:55.726, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if you're watching this in L two, 2022. For those of us that were early to using synthetics, just the idea that you could eventually gain exposure to real world assets or derivatives, in many cases, we would all go to talking about commodities and foreign currencies. And I think some of these concepts have become really mainstream in the DFI community. But you have to appreciate that this was really radical, especially back in 2018, 2019. Today, the DFI community is still incredibly small compared to the rest of the world. It's just that I think our bubble, our echo chamber has grown. And so, to me, what you guys have built with synthetix and Quenta is it's a major vertical within defi that I think I, and many people believe is going to be one of the largest verticals within DFI, but one of the challenges that, obviously, synthetics has helped us work through.
00:05:55.726 - 00:06:34.650, Speaker A: And now Quinta is being on l one, where the party's at in DFI, everyone's transacting, and there's been a lot of network congestion. And so, thankfully, having moved to optimism, this is one part of the equation that has been started to be solved. I'll say been solved. You can use the product now, but now we're seeing a huge shift of liquidity to optimism. So I'll leave off at that. Would it be a good time to kind of walk through the new futures product, and I can sort of screen share how it looks on the DAP?
00:06:35.470 - 00:07:02.046, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that would be good. And I think this is one of the kind of keys to this narrative, right. Is that there are things that you can do on optimism that you just cannot do on l one. Right. And a while ago, we realized that perpetual futures is one of those things. Same thing with Lyra and options within the synthetics ecosystem. We're really pushing kind of, I guess, the state of the art in terms of what you can compute on chain.
00:07:02.046 - 00:07:25.340, Speaker B: But obviously, the additional computational bandwidth that you have on optimism makes some stuff viable that just isn't viable on l one. It's not even an issue of cost. It's just you can't actually do it. It's super exciting to have optimism now. Be, like, production ready, and have pro futures released. And as you can see on the screen, go and start trading now.
00:07:26.030 - 00:08:02.822, Speaker A: Yeah. So, just quick reminder to everyone, what we're looking at here is on optimism. So, if you have an ethereum wallet like metamask, you can go to V two, beta, Quinta IO, and if you flip the little switch up here, it'll then prompt you to switch your metamask network. And then from there, there are, what? Guys, there's three markets that are open now with up to ten X leverage. So I could go into the e per market here. And let's say this is actually part of. Before the call, Kane sent over 100 SUSD just so we could play with this.
00:08:02.822 - 00:08:18.380, Speaker A: And we were both kind of, like, marveling, of course, at the fact that it shows up within a few seconds. So, if I were going to open up a position here, and, guys, stop me if I'm missing anything. I mean, depends, of course, if I want to go long or short.
00:08:18.910 - 00:08:24.110, Speaker B: I think we want a yolo long ETH here, right? Like, no one.
00:08:24.180 - 00:08:24.846, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:08:25.028 - 00:08:27.758, Speaker B: What's happening here, right? Yeah. Cool.
00:08:27.924 - 00:08:40.674, Speaker A: Awesome. So here we go. So we'll open a position. The one thing you won't see is my metamask just opened and I am going to click confirm now. There we go. And there it is. My transactions through.
00:08:40.674 - 00:09:02.486, Speaker A: So I've opened my position anywhere here that I should. Oh, there we go. Now we can see it here. So here's my position here. And I can track that and what eventually choose to close it or not. Anything else here, guys, you want to call out or anything I can click on as we're sort of just walking through an example, I think.
00:09:02.508 - 00:09:23.578, Speaker C: Just excited about the future. This is the beta. We've just, just launched this. It's been out for about two weeks now, so it's got its little quirks and stuff. And we were only at three markets, but, yeah, we've already started an sip to expand the markets and really ramp up. So I think we're excited to kind of start to put more pressure on this and eventually have a competition to really kick it into the next stage. So keep an eye out for that while we'll have some quinta rewards once we do launch token.
00:09:23.578 - 00:09:33.070, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's a lot to take it, but it's exciting to see it finally live. And, yeah, opening up ten x positions with synthetics is pretty big step forward. So, yeah, this is exciting.
00:09:33.230 - 00:09:35.890, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:09:35.960 - 00:09:36.642, Speaker A: Oh, no, Kane.
00:09:36.706 - 00:09:36.982, Speaker B: No.
00:09:37.036 - 00:09:38.230, Speaker A: What were you saying? Go ahead.
00:09:38.300 - 00:10:17.700, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny, I used to trade perps a lot back in the day. I was a big fan of Kraken and lived in their perps through a lot of 2017, 2018, and I kind of was banned from day trading by my wife. She was like, you need to stop day trading, which I think was a good decision a while ago, but I kind of turned up this interface, like, a week and a half ago, and I was like, oh, I remember this. This looks really fun. And, yeah, so I've been trading quite a bit last few days.
00:10:18.470 - 00:10:58.186, Speaker A: That's awesome. And reminder to everyone, of course, none of this is financial advice. We're not recommending or endorsing that you go open up a ten X position. But for those who know how to use perps, this obviously can be a lot of fun, too. I don't want to gloss over some of the fundamental value of using this goes back to the fundamentals of deFi. For me to use this, all I have to do is connect my wallet. So it's permissionless, it's trustless, built on synthetics that lives on Ethereum, and now optimism, which is technically the same place, it's just the ability to access this from anywhere.
00:10:58.186 - 00:11:13.170, Speaker A: This is a wildly powerful tool that normally it depends on where you live in the world, what access to different centralized exchanges you have. And here it's all been rebuilt, but with automated money software.
00:11:13.590 - 00:12:34.586, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed. I think one of the key things is that as markets expand, as the functionality expands, there is also a pretty high likelihood that other protocols are going to start to integrate this functionality and start to leverage the liquidity that you have in perpetual futures, which is kind of what we've been trying to do the entire time. This idea of composability is what kicked off defi summer in the first instance. Like all of these things being combined to create novel solutions. And I think we haven't yet really seen a deeply liquid perpetual futures market on chain. We've got DYDX, which is amazing, but it exists in this zero knowledge roll up on stockware that's kind of siloed, right? And so while it's permissionless and has a lot of the defi components that we know and love, it is in its own little silo, right, in the same way that kind of a centralized exchange is. And it just means that you can't access it directly on chain in the way that you can uniswap or compound or aave or the things that we're used to being able to just go from one click to one click to one click and kind of hit all these protocols.
00:12:34.586 - 00:12:42.720, Speaker B: So I think that this is something that, as more protocols come to optimism, we're going to see a whole bunch of really cool stuff emerge out of this.
00:12:44.530 - 00:13:38.814, Speaker A: Just a reminder to folks, if you're new to this, a few other interesting use cases, we can't really walk through them in detail here, but one of the reasons I was so blown away when I, as like a crypto newbie was starting to use a perps market, you would have been genius to do this many months ago. But to open up like a one X short position and be able to hedge against the market going down without actually having to sell, let's say an asset like ETH, which also means that I don't incur like a taxable event depending on what part of the world you live in. Obviously, me being in the like, that's something that I try to avoid. Also, I'm pretty sure Anthony Sassano would ban me from the Ethereum community if I was ever caught selling ether. There's also. Yeah, that's right. I would never.
00:13:38.852 - 00:13:42.740, Speaker B: I don't know if he allowed shorting either. That also might get a banned for you.
00:13:43.190 - 00:14:00.106, Speaker A: That's right Kane, do you want to touch on just the funding rate in case anyone, again, is new to this? What does that allow you to do if you were to open up, let's say a delta neutral position, or basically, what's some of the ways one might take advantage of that?
00:14:00.288 - 00:14:49.274, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think without going too deep into how you construct a perpetual future, this instrument was created by Bitmex, and the idea was that you basically wanted the ability to long bitcoin and leave a position open for a long time. But one of the trade offs is that you need to pay funding in order to do that. And so we have a similar concept where you're paying funding depending on whether the market is bullish or bearish. So if the market is overall very bullish and you want to go long, then you need to pay funding. If the market's overall bearish and you want to go short, then you need to pay funding. And the opposite is true. If you think that ETH is going to hit ten k in the next three months and everyone else is bearish, then you can get paid to long ETH, basically.
00:14:49.274 - 00:14:57.660, Speaker B: And so that's kind of how perpetual futures markets work. There's a cost to keeping the position open that you need to cover.
00:14:58.110 - 00:15:29.590, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, guys, anything else that you wanted to cover before we go? I think we hit on all the different topics, and I just want to remind everyone, you can try this or learn about it at V two beta quanta IO. It's obviously still a beta because I think the guys will tell you here, there's a lot in the works there in the UI, but as a time synthetics user, this is a huge step up. So just excited to see this go live and excited for the next iteration.
00:15:30.170 - 00:15:36.760, Speaker B: It's only been two and a half years in the work, so it took a little bit longer than we thought, but we got there.
00:15:38.090 - 00:16:03.310, Speaker A: It's funny too, because it feels like it was so long ago. But yeah, every time I look back, I go, DFI summer was less than two years ago. How is that even possible? And I remember staking. I think I started staking SNX in the summer of 2019. And that just is so long ago. That's like an eternity ago. But yeah, it's wild.
00:16:03.310 - 00:16:17.842, Speaker A: Just obviously, full disclosure, I clearly hold SNX and I use synthetics, so I have whatever bias in terms of talking about it. But again, this is for informational purposes only. Andrew, anything else you want to share before we go?
00:16:17.976 - 00:16:44.880, Speaker C: Just really want to hammer home that, keep an eye out for what's coming next. This is really like the starting point. So there's a lot of new markets getting added. We're going to launch competition, you're going to see more of the exchange fill out with just swap functionality, et cetera. So this is a good point to kind of start tuning in because, yeah, a lot is going to start happening very soon. So this is a good point to kind of get engaged and maybe learn a little bit about optimism, dabble, transfer a little funds over and see how it feels. Because, yeah, I think it's definitely going to start picking up speed in that.
00:16:45.890 - 00:17:32.174, Speaker A: If you go back into Kane's Twitter timeline or mine back in, I think it was like mid, early March, we did a Twitter spaces and Kane went into a lot of detail about why synthetics and other protocols have chosen to build on optimism. So if you really want to dig into the technical details, it's a really interesting conversation. Mostly Kane kind of teaching us, but other than that, yeah. Learn more here at the Quinta Beta website. And then if you enjoyed this, subscribe@defidead.com also, if you're building with synthetics or on optimism or the next great DeFi protocol, please get in touch with me and my team at Fourth Revolution Capital. So, guys, thanks so much for your time.
00:17:32.174 - 00:17:35.102, Speaker A: I'm going to just end the broadcast and then we'll be in a green room in a second.
00:17:35.156 - 00:17:35.806, Speaker C: Okay?
00:17:35.988 - 00:17:36.960, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:17:37.330 - 00:17:39.850, Speaker A: All right. Bye, everyone. Take care. Bye.
