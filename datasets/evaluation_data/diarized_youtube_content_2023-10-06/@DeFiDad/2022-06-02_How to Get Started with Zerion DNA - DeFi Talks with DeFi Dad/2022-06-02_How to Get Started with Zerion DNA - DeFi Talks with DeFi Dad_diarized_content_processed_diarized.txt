00:00:03.370 - 00:01:02.958, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, you're watching Defi talks with Defi dad. Hey, thanks for joining me. I'm actually back after getting to interview DeFi land just a few hours ago. And so I'm joined here by Alex guy from Xerion. We're going to talk today about some new products that have been launched by Xerion. Most of you probably know Xerion as one of the leading popular dashboards where you can track all of your crypto assets and NFTs, but they've recently launched a new product which enhances their mobile application. Previously, that application was really convenient for tracking your portfolio on the go, but now it is a non custodial wallet.
00:01:02.958 - 00:01:38.522, Speaker A: So it really has pivoted the zapper, or, I'm sorry, the taboo there. It has pivoted the Xerion wallet into being a wallet that really could replace something like metamask. And we'll talk about some of the ways you can import your wallets, whether you use something like metamask into Xerion. And then lastly, we'll get to touch on Xerion DNA, which is a really interesting, self evolving nfT that basically incentivizes you to explore web three. So, Alex, thanks for joining me, man.
00:01:38.656 - 00:01:50.160, Speaker B: Thanks so much for having me. I'm doing really good. It's the end of the day here in Paris and feeling psyched to talk about our new wallet and DNA itself. So thanks for having me.
00:01:50.610 - 00:02:04.050, Speaker A: Yeah, so good to get to walk through this some. I need to get some more defi, dad. Sleep there. I'm flipping names there in the middle of the middle of my sentence.
00:02:04.390 - 00:02:05.380, Speaker B: It happens.
00:02:05.850 - 00:02:27.238, Speaker A: So, Alex, why don't we talk first? Know you are head of marketing and growth at Xerion, which is definitely a role that I can empathize with at one of the top Defi teams in the space, I guess. How did you get into crypto in the first place? I'm also curious how you ended up at Xerion.
00:02:27.414 - 00:03:03.654, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. No, it's a good question because I think everybody seems to have a different circuitous, winding route that takes them into the space. And for me, my background is very much in web two marketing. I've kind of worked in mainly in startups, in different stages, various stages of startups. So I've gone from running out of money and going out of business to a couple of exits and everything in between. So I kind of had this sort of traditional quote unquote, growth and marketing background in various tech companies.
00:03:03.654 - 00:03:57.138, Speaker B: And sort of two years ago, I got really excited by this NFT game, fantasy football game called so rare that maybe people know about, it's basically like digital trading cards plus fantasy sports kind of combined on the blockchain. So I started using so rare quite extensively and get really into it. It's very much like, hits a lot of buttons for me. And I noticed on my cards that there was like an ether scan address for every one of them. And I'd been aware, working in web two kind of startup space, kind of been like adjacent to sort of crypto for a while and kind of viewed it almost as a subset of fintech or something like that. I was aware of Ethereum and not smart enough to get involved early enough, but I was aware of Ethereum and what was going on. And pretty much for me, I have a really good friend that works at Ledger in Paris.
00:03:57.138 - 00:04:35.470, Speaker B: And when we started talking about, like, we started getting more and more and more into crypto, defi more broadly. And from there I started, because you need, obviously, ethereum to buy cards on so rare. I started building out a small portfolio and then from there, yeah, I needed a place to manage it and I found Zirian as a user. And after a few sort of buggy emails to our CEO Yuviani, they were looking for a head of marketing. And I was like, hey, I don't have any experience in web three, but I love your product. I'm a heavy user at this point. Very convinced.
00:04:35.470 - 00:04:57.050, Speaker B: Sort of fell down the rabbit hole, so to speak, as the cliche goes. Can you give me a try? And that was about a year ago. So I've been a Zerian for almost exactly a year now. And so I guess in crypto land, that makes me like, I don't know, like seven years in crypto. Like a dog, like dog years or something. So, yeah, I've almost arrived. My first full year in web three in crypto.
00:04:57.050 - 00:05:26.418, Speaker B: I'm loving it. I think there's a huge amount of, I mean, you mentioned it, but there's a huge amount of rethinking from a marketing and growth perspective that has to go into somebody making that transition from web two to web three, because many of the channels that are like staples are just closed to you. And so that's been just a really fun experience to rethink a lot of the sort of traditional playbooks that I spent a good part of a decade working on prior to joining Xerion.
00:05:26.594 - 00:06:38.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the challenges for you is Xerion covers so much of DFI, and let's just call it like web three. I think it was end of summer 2019. I had only been using compound and a few other applications that existed, but I remember discovering Xerion and being like, oh, cool, now I can track my wallet because I just had no idea where my money was without keeping every tab open on my computer. And obviously, you guys have just grown so much since then. So one of the things I want to cover today is this pivot recently to evolving from more of like, a home based dashboard that you can do all sorts of things in DeFi with, and again, track your portfolio to actually being the wallet that you use. So maybe you could talk us through some of the thinking there. And whenever you're ready to, we could start to sort of screen share what that wallet actually looks like and how it differentiates from the original Xerion mobile app.
00:06:38.640 - 00:07:30.042, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think for us, this has very much been like an evolution to us becoming a non custodial wallet, which is what we announced last week. Actually, almost exactly a week ago, we launched our noncustodial wallet. And the popular perception, I think, still about Xerion is that we are a Defi dashboard, a Defi portfolio tracker, and we started a transition probably about a year ago, maybe even a little bit longer than that, which is like, we wanted to add much more functionality than the sort of three staples of our portfolio tracker that people really liked. First, the chart. Very interactive, evolving, moving real time chart to show both price performance for different assets, but also their people's portfolios. So that was the initial product.
00:07:30.042 - 00:08:11.910, Speaker B: That was the initial thing. Right after that, we added. When the company started, we added really great detailed transaction history that people still talk about as one of their favorite features with Zyrian. And very related to that, particularly on the mobile side, is the sort of like near real time push notifications that we send when a swap has been executed. Whatever you've done has happened. And I think that that's still, again, much like our history, something that people still really love about us, and it's something that we see time and time again, is in this space. Peace of mind, trust, et cetera, are like things that are sort of few and far between.
00:08:11.910 - 00:09:05.786, Speaker B: And so people have really loved that about us for a long time. And those features formed the core of what Zerian was until about a year ago. As I said, at that point, we started to add pretty extensive trading functionality, swap functionality within Xerion that basically has a sort of pretty sophisticated trading aggregation system that when a user goes to execute a trade on Xerion, we scan the top eight dexes out there to basically give you the cheapest trade across every Dex, the main dexes that you would use to execute a trade. Overall, this piece of functionality is a little less known about us and I think it's something that it sort of signaled, I guess gave away our hand a bit, that we were transitioning more away from this just like portfolio tracking functionality and into more of a wallet. And this is again happening like a year ago.
00:09:05.888 - 00:09:25.026, Speaker A: By the way, as we talk through this, I'm just realizing too, in case someone hasn't seen Xerion, do you want to share just the dashboard as we talk through this again, we're going to cover obviously some of these new and interesting products, but you can't get away from the basics of. Yeah, sure, this is the home base.
00:09:25.128 - 00:09:36.150, Speaker B: So this is the home base. And basically what we're looking at here, obviously this is a pretty grim portfolio performance chart here, but you can see.
00:09:36.300 - 00:09:39.014, Speaker A: In this market it looks good, you're doing great.
00:09:39.132 - 00:10:29.160, Speaker B: There's some ups here, but basically you see the sort of interactive chart that is the first piece of functionality I talked about. See the sort of interactive transaction history, which again is something that I think is really important. And it also is a piece of the notifications on the mobile side, you receive push notifications for all these actions and the trades that you've made. So this is sort of like the main Zurian, I guess, selling point. If I go back to the overview here, you can see all of your different assets. You can group them by position and by platform. You can see that we support, we're multichain, so right now we support ten networks, ethereum and nine others.
00:10:29.160 - 00:11:08.094, Speaker B: And so you can group them by different which networks you want to look at. So you have a large amount of control, I think, over sort of what you see and how you see your portfolio performance. We also have two, like I say, I was mentioning the trading aggregation, so obviously you can trade across all these different chains, which is pretty exciting from a multi chain perspective. I was just on with Phantom. I don't have any phantom assets, so it's hard for me to demo this. But basically if I want to execute a trade, let's just go with main Ethereum. If I want to swap, say like what do I got here? Let's just do something random like Decentraland.
00:11:08.094 - 00:11:49.118, Speaker B: So I want to do like ten decentraland for die. Maybe that's even too cheap. But basically this will give me an offered buy rate so I can select different ones. But this swap was basically the cheapest one that we could find was uniswap, and it'll give you an estimation of the network fee. And if I go to approve that, I would actually go and do the trade. But the other thing is that you can select which decks you use, so if you get rewards for a specific one, you can also still do that. But that trading aggregation piece is pretty unique and something that's interesting and also, as I say, kind of signaled that we were moving towards this more wallet style functionality quite a pretty decent amount of time ago.
00:11:49.118 - 00:11:51.550, Speaker B: I think we added this about a year ago.
00:11:51.700 - 00:12:40.702, Speaker A: Yeah, I think when you look at all that you have offered, the most obvious missing piece here has been like a wallet. So it makes a lot of sense to me because I can definitely speak to. I think a challenge for me working in community and marketing at Zapper was that I was always thinking about how to onboard new folks to the DeFi space the way that you are with Xerion. Except there's a choke point there, which is the wallet. You're not in control of the wallet and that is a very frustrating thing because at the end of the day you're like, oh, so you can do all this. It's amazing. But by the way, you need to go set up, let's say metamask or argent, or actually credit to Argent too.
00:12:40.702 - 00:13:03.378, Speaker A: Argent is, I think a really easy wallet to set up as agreed. Maybe, maybe this is then a good time to pivot to. I don't know if one of the tabs there, if you have some sort of screenshots, we could talk through with that wallet. But yeah. What is unique about this wallet? And I guess, what are the benefits of being able to have a noncustodial wallet now in Xerion?
00:13:03.554 - 00:14:00.322, Speaker B: Sure. I actually don't have a screenshot of the wallet itself now that I'm thinking about. You know, I can do it really quickly to basically the non custodial wallet. The first thing to understand is that right now it's mobile first. So it's available on iOS and Android, I guess it also is available through our macOS desktop app, but there's not a web version of it at the moment, although we're planning on some interesting web pieces coming soon, although I don't have full details on those to share yet. But basically the wallet itself for us, I think there's three elements to it beyond the mobile nature. The first is that we wanted the same level of portfolio management to be combined with wallet management itself and almost create this super Wallet, or super wallet app for our users.
00:14:00.322 - 00:15:17.358, Speaker B: And specifically what I mean by that is, with Zirian Wallet, you can create your own non custodial wallet and start from scratch, or you can import your existing wallet with, say, metamask or Coinbase wallet or phantom Wallet on Solana, and you basically can sort of create a nested kind of view of your entire portfolio. One of the big problems, I think you probably feel this just as much as anybody in the space, is when you've got a portfolio that's relatively complex, you have some kind of wallet structure that's usually pretty tricky to navigate. And there's not a really easy way for users to see all of their portfolio in one kind of view. And so what we've done with Zerian Wallet is make it possible for users to create these wallet groups where your portfolio will be listed, your entire portfolio. And all of the wallets, sort of, as I say, nested underneath, will contribute up to the sort of overall portfolio view, I guess is the best way to put it. That means you can obviously look at an individual wallet if you want to manage a specific one, but you can also get this overall portfolio view that kind of combines the wallet management piece as well as the portfolio management piece that we've been known for. So that's like the first element.
00:15:17.358 - 00:16:18.150, Speaker B: The second element is we really wanted to create an experience that, particularly on mobile users, could have basically a multichain experience that allowed them to explore all of web three in one place. And so obviously, users can have the same multichain trading experience in our mobile wallet that they can on the web app. But we wanted people to be able to basically go anywhere within web three all in one place. And that includes NFTs, includes, obviously, all the different d five protocols. Right now we support ten chains, thousands of protocols. So we have this all in oneness, this completeness, and the fact that's available on your phone, you can sign transactions in app, which is always a pretty tricky, hairy kind of experience. I think most people in the space would say that it's something they don't like to do very often, because it's a little untrustworthy, a little unclear of what's happening.
00:16:18.150 - 00:17:11.330, Speaker B: So we really tried to make this experience with our wallet something that's easy to use and trustworthy. And the last element of the wallet is something that we could talk about a lot with the DNA, but that's the social functionality that we're adding and have added specifically around the DNA itself. The ability to watch wallets which is always something that has been in Zurian. But we are transitioning to a situation where people can follow different wallets or follow NFT collections and all the implications. That means from creating almost like a sort of trusted community, I guess, or like a community, you're building your own community within your wallet. But I think that the key piece to show off in terms of the social functionality right now is the DNA NFT. Just really quickly tldr about the DNA.
00:17:11.330 - 00:17:48.020, Speaker B: When users create or import their wallets to zyrian wallet, create their zyrian wallet or import their existing wallet to Zyrian Wallet, they have the option to mint an NFT that we call zurian DNA, which is a living NFT that basically evolves as users perform different actions, hold the NFT in their specific wallet and spend money on things like gas or obviously add the number of add tokens to their portfolio. Basically as people explore web three, the NFT actually changes and evolves over time.
00:17:49.430 - 00:18:16.854, Speaker A: Which is, by the way, it's very cool. We actually should show that here on screen. One thing to cap off on the wallet itself. So I have the Xerion mobile app. I just literally took a screenshot of I created a new wallet address. Normally I would have pasted in an address or scanned it, and this used to be a way for me to just track wallet addresses. It was purely for tracking.
00:18:16.854 - 00:19:06.698, Speaker A: Now I actually have created a wallet address that is controlled by my Xerion mobile app. And then I'm able to ultimately, you can see here in the know, it's, it's multi chain like you pointed break. I can nest this within my other wallets to kind of show a full portfolio view. But let's go back to do you want to show that you had a guide there to Xerion DNA? Because one of the interesting things here is once you set up a wallet, now you can essentially start to evolve this avatar after you claim your Xerion DNA. Whenever you're on that tab, I'll share your screen again here. There we go.
00:19:06.784 - 00:19:36.740, Speaker B: Cool. Obviously, a prerequisite to the DNA is you have to create your Xerion wallet. So there's just a couple of screenshots here about how to go and create your wallet. Again, the prompts are within the app itself, so please go download the iOS or Android app. But basically we have this nice little chat sort of guide to walk you through it. It'll tell you how to backup your seed phrase so you don't have to think about it too much. We have a nice little guide to try to help people protect themselves.
00:19:36.740 - 00:20:29.586, Speaker B: But once you've created your wallet, you're basically going to have to, because although the NFT is free, you either have to transfer ETH into this wallet or buy some new ETH because you have to pay for the gas. We've partnered in the Xerion app with three main on ramp solutions, moonpay, ramp and Mercurio. So it makes it really easy and intuitive, as you can see here, to actually go and top up your wallet if you need to. But basically then there's going to be a claim DNA button that you see here at the top of the nfts tab. But once you click that mint NFT, once you have assets to pay for the gas, if you've imported your wallet, you'll obviously have, you probably will have that covered. But if you need to, you can, as I say, on ramp directly in the zurian app. But basically then you'll just be able to mint.
00:20:29.586 - 00:20:36.150, Speaker B: So there's a little guide here and the transaction will execute. And that's Alex.
00:20:36.650 - 00:21:18.374, Speaker A: Okay, so step one, just need a refresher here. I have to actually create a new wallet address, which is through the Xerion mobile app. But once I do that, obviously you're going to need ether in this case to mint the Xerion DNA. So really that's it. Just the prerequisite is create a wallet address with the Xerion mobile app, then add some ether because you're going to need it regardless. And then you can actually mint it once you mint it. I know also too, you can have multiple and so you could set one of them.
00:21:18.374 - 00:21:24.470, Speaker A: As you're not feeding multiple DNAs at once too, you do have to choose which one is active.
00:21:25.370 - 00:22:04.866, Speaker B: It's something I wanted to talk about a little later on here. Basically, although the DNA will evolve, first of all, you need to set one DNA NFT as active. And that basically sort of indicates that this is the DNA that you want to evolve with you. Now, if you only have one DNA, it's going to be active by default. If it's in the wallet that created it, if that makes sense. So if you just go and immediately create your zerian wallet and mint your DNA and you only have one, then that will be the one that's active. And so if you have multiple, there's a little set active button within the app here that you just have to set that.
00:22:04.866 - 00:22:34.986, Speaker B: And once that's active, then that NFT will be the one that evolves. If you do have multiple DNAs but basically, actually, just really quickly, this is what sort of a newly minted DNA might look like. So it's actually a good excuse to talk about the attributes that we use to generate this NFT. First of all, the primary, as you can see here, this means that the NFT is active. So if you could see this. Yes, it means that this is in fact my active NFT. We basically have six attributes.
00:22:34.986 - 00:23:31.070, Speaker B: The first one is the age, which in this case it was just minted, so it's zero weeks old. That means that the body is black here. The longer you hold the NFT in the wallet that minted it, the sort of body will become more and more transparent. So you can tell how long somebody's had a specific NFT by the sort of clarity that you see in the overall body. Then we used gas spend, and we use gaspend transactions balance and the total number of assets, along with the different networks that a user has to generate the rest of the features on the NFT. So every bit from the background to the headdress, the headwear to the clothes themselves, all of this is generated by the other attributes that you see here. So actually, we have a nice walkthrough, kind of, I guess, for each of the individual attributes.
00:23:31.070 - 00:24:09.366, Speaker B: The colors that you see are very closely, or, well, they're determined by the highest number of assets on a particular network that a wallet has. So if it's phantom network, it's going to look like that. If it's avalanche, it's going to look something along these lines, polygon, et cetera. So it's sort of like the colors that you see are very dependent on the network that an individual wallet has. The most assets in. The headware is linked to the number of transactions themselves. So effectively, the more elaborate the headwear, the more transactions that a wallet has completed.
00:24:09.366 - 00:24:50.730, Speaker B: The clothing is linked to the value of the user's portfolio, like the assets in the portfolio. So again, the more elaborate, the more assets that a user has in their wallet. The body, as I mentioned, is linked. The clarity level is linked to the amount of time that it's been held. So as you see, it starts out as totally like a solid structure and initially evolves to be a pretty translucent, transparent structure. And then the filling is linked to the number of tokens. So again, the more elaborate, the more complex the sort of inside of the body, the more tokens the wallet has.
00:24:50.730 - 00:25:03.158, Speaker B: And then finally, the background is linked specifically to the gas spend. So if it's a really crazy looking background, the person has spent a lot on their transactions versus some more simplistic background.
00:25:03.334 - 00:25:08.240, Speaker A: So much detail. How long did it take to plan all of this out and build it?
00:25:08.850 - 00:25:33.382, Speaker B: So we've been working on this for a good part of four or five months. I can't remember when the initial specs started getting drawn out. It was definitely towards the end of last year when we really started planning this effectively. We got really inspired by the sort of other generative NFT projects for us that was like, sorry, I switched back.
00:25:33.436 - 00:25:36.326, Speaker A: Oh, no, you're okay. That's okay. Now I'll just remove that there.
00:25:36.508 - 00:26:13.730, Speaker B: We got really inspired by OG crystals, I think is probably the most well known of the generative NFT projects out there. Generative NFts aren't new. What is new in the case of the zerian DNA is this NFT evolves as you do things within on chain and across multiple chains. And that is, I think, the first time that a generative NFT has been linked to sort of your footprint. It's like a visual representation of a user or a wallet's footprint on chain, which is pretty exciting.
00:26:14.470 - 00:27:09.714, Speaker A: I've not seen anything like it. It's very interesting, I think before we got on, actually. So I wrote up a guide about this, kind of using your guide there not too long ago. And yeah, I was like, it seems like there's some magic under the hood there to make that possible because normally with generative art, we've seen a lot of copy paste over and over again where there's a set number of traits and then based on when you mint it on the blockchain, you get some new concoction of those traits. And here I think it's just cool that it continually evolves. And I think for better or worse, I'm a little bit nervous. You might inspire a whole new trend of these PFP projects where they're actually changing and evolving.
00:27:09.714 - 00:27:23.050, Speaker A: But this is about actually, I think, what creating a more interesting experience as they use the Xerion wallet. This is specific to the Xerion generated wallet addresses.
00:27:25.470 - 00:27:35.280, Speaker B: No, no, sorry. If you import with your private key or seed phrase, basically what will happen as opposed to starting from zero.
00:27:37.490 - 00:27:37.806, Speaker A: It.
00:27:37.828 - 00:27:49.682, Speaker B: Actually links back, but it's not going to give you like a historical view. It's like a snapshot of like, okay, at this moment I imported, and this is what my wallet looks so like.
00:27:49.816 - 00:28:06.262, Speaker A: Defiedad ETH has a lot of activity. If I were to import the private key, import the wall address basically into the Xerion mobile app, it'll start tracking it but it's not like it'll retroactively reward me. Okay, cool.
00:28:06.396 - 00:28:12.380, Speaker B: So your age will still be zero and your gas spend will be like whatever it is at that moment.
00:28:12.750 - 00:29:02.314, Speaker A: I think that makes sense because otherwise you'd have some people who would just, well, it might be something to consider in the future. I like starting fresh now because again, I got to speak with you more. As someone who can empathize with, I think, the pain of trying to market in web three, it's very difficult. And so you need users to be incentivized to want to try new things with that wallet. But there could be definitely another generation of this where it just sort of represents all of your past wallet activity and maybe there's some added incentive to start using. Or like, in my case, I've got wallet addresses that are very active, but I would need to import them and start fresh. So very cool.
00:29:02.314 - 00:29:04.730, Speaker A: I think they're really creative.
00:29:07.390 - 00:30:17.618, Speaker B: Thanks. We've had good feedback from it. I think that a lot of the people who have used it early have been excited by it. I think it's generated a lot of interest from people who see this as an interesting take on NFT projects in general, because I think that what we really wanted to try to do, although admittedly right now, the main choice or the main statement about your beliefs and the communities that you support is the network factor. We want to continue to try to add attributes that allow this NFT to really be reflective of genuinely of users online on chain identities. I don't think that we're necessarily there yet. We've started with the basic set of attributes, but I think that once we continue to change and improve this over time, the idea is that it becomes like an actual representation of a user's on chain identity and something that people like to show off and clearly demonstrate as like a statement about themselves and what they believe in, what kind of projects they support, what kind of things they like, communities, they believe in, that kind of thing.
00:30:17.618 - 00:30:43.180, Speaker B: So it's definitely not an endpoint for us. We are going to continue to try to add new things to it. And obviously it's clearly acted as an interesting acquisition tool for us from a wallet perspective because people have been really excited by it and so they've been incentivized to think through, like, okay, how can I go and do things in my Zion wallet that allow my creative situation where my DNA, NFT evolved? So it's been a really fun one for us.
00:30:43.710 - 00:31:06.590, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you guys definitely are a part of a special crew that I think continually proves that web three does know how to market. Like, the website is really pretty, the app is really pretty. And I just think these new avatars are really fun to look at, actually. I think I missed that earlier, that the colors actually reflect the network that you're on.
00:31:06.660 - 00:31:44.126, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like network balance. So it'll be the networks that you have the highest balance in. So if you're really heavy into binance, it's going to be yellow. If you're really into optimism, if you've got a big airdrop recently and we're able to claim it, congratulations, first of all. But it's going to be red, that your portfolio will sort of reflect that in your DNA. And so that's kind of like I say, the idea is that we want to tease out eventually is these NFTs are actually a reflection of the things that you believe in, not just like the money you've spent. Ultimately, where we want to take it is these are mean.
00:31:44.126 - 00:32:15.510, Speaker B: Vitalik's been talking a lot about soul bound kind of attributes and traits and things like that. I don't have any alpha about what that could look like in the zyrian NFT or DNA NFT in the future, but it is something that we're thinking about is, like, how do we make these really tied to things that people believe in and aspects of themselves that are really emotional choices versus, I don't know, financial ones, like how much gas they've spent. So I think that's where we're trying to take it in the future.
00:32:15.580 - 00:33:15.382, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I definitely think especially with the l two s that are highlighted here, like, you have arbitram and optimism. And in the future here, I'm assuming we'll have zk sync once 2.0 comes out and you've got polygon, which is like a flourishing D five web three community. So. Yeah, no, it makes a lot of sense. I can definitely see these being used as avatars, but I'm really curious to catch up in the future on whether you've been able to see, because at the end of the day, all this activity is on chain. So you could really start to do some interesting analysis without invading anyone's privacy and going into which users who generated wallet addresses through Xerion mobile wallet, which of them really caught the bug and started to use more applications.
00:33:15.382 - 00:33:30.762, Speaker A: So lots of interesting learnings or lessons to come from this. Alex, anything else you think we should cover here? I think we just about hit on everything but anything else that folks should know about Xerion DNA or the new non custodial wallet.
00:33:30.906 - 00:33:56.502, Speaker B: So first, there's just two really quick things. First of, like I'd said, you can import your wallets with your private keys or seed phrase just to double check and reiterate, make sure everybody's clear on that. We don't store any of that information. It's basically just to sort of render your wallet within the Xerion interface. And we don't take and collect any of that information. In fact, we can't even cross associate wallet addresses. We don't do that.
00:33:56.502 - 00:34:06.220, Speaker B: So from a privacy perspective, if anybody's worried about that or anybody's listening, thinking about that, we don't do anything to store or retain that kind of information.
00:34:09.150 - 00:34:49.146, Speaker A: I think this is definitely a problem I've thought about. You wouldn't be able to look in a database and say this wallet was imported with this wallet and start to connect all of that. Yeah, that's information that people definitely don't want. The mobile app too. I want to make sure this is clarified because there are lots of scammer links that get put out. People will misspell Xerion by one letter. So you really need to be careful because it's Zerion IO and you really got to make sure it's spelled correctly that there isn't a zero where the O is.
00:34:49.146 - 00:35:04.800, Speaker A: Scammers will try to pull those sorts of tricks. It's just the mobile app, though, where you could import with like a key. It is not the desktop. Like, if I'm in chrome, I should never be trying to import.
00:35:05.570 - 00:35:46.860, Speaker B: Don't do that. We take an approach to security where we try to be overly communicative. And if it's us doing it, you're going to see a lot of language that talks through what's happening. If you see things that seem kind of fishy, just like is like a policy beyond syrian or anything. If I see something that feels fishy, it probably is fishy. And there's nothing fishy about what we in our mobile app, the import function, we've had many people do it over the last couple of days, and it's something that I think we're really proud of is that it's totally still with under your control. We do not store associate take anything.
00:35:46.860 - 00:36:52.334, Speaker B: So it's an import only, not a storage or giving up a situation where you give us control of anything. There's no control exchange. And actually, that's just the last thing I wanted to hit on related to the DNA NFT specifically, which is I think that a lot of what we wanted to try to give people was sort of hint at this very common theme and trope within the sort of web three space, which is about ownership and the change of ownership and the change of data. Right. Like, who owns your data? This is a very overt way for us to basically give people the chance to stake really publicly, like, this is me on chain, this is who I am, these are the things I've done, these are the networks I support, these are the assets I own. You can put that out there on the surface in a way that's totally under your control and something that reflects who you are in a digital context. And that idea of your digital footprint being utterly under your control is something that's really important to us.
00:36:52.334 - 00:37:22.646, Speaker B: First of all, it's definitely a goal behind what we wanted to do with the DNA, NFT specifically. But I think also it just speaks to the type of people and the type of community we're trying to build at Zerian. So it's a lot about ownership, it's a lot about making sure everything is under the control of the user and putting that out there in a public way, to say, this is who I am, kind of thing. So, again, it's ultimately moving towards, I think, an area where your digital identity is something you can actually show off, which is, I think, really exciting.
00:37:22.838 - 00:38:18.854, Speaker A: It's a really cool vision I've definitely been most interested in. Just like, I think there's an entertainment to getting that DNA started and watching it evolve, but I definitely could see it evolving into a form of identification or even retroactive. Airdrops have gotten really clever lately, and so they have used different pinpoints on chain or different signals on chain. Like, let's pretend someone is on a multi sig. The optimism airdrop actually rewarded those who were on multi sigs. So I think Azerion DNA would be very interesting for those who do launch tokens in the future to look and say, hey, here's a great sort of score of who's a pro user, who's a more active user on chain?
00:38:18.982 - 00:38:36.514, Speaker B: Yeah, I will say I don't have any specifics because we're still figuring it out, but you're barking up the right tree with some of this stuff. You're really in line with what we're sort of what we got cooking up in the lab, so to speak. I think it's absolutely the right area.
00:38:36.632 - 00:39:12.138, Speaker A: That's cool. I think I can read between the lines, but, yeah, for others that launch a token in the future, this looks really interesting. To me, optimism, it kind of just blew my mind with the fact they looked at who was on multi sigs, they looked at who donated to Gitcoin grants. These are definitely markers of long term, dedicated players to the space and who you might want to be luring into your dow or your community. But Alex, thanks so much for your time. This was awesome.
00:39:12.304 - 00:39:12.734, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:39:12.772 - 00:39:28.130, Speaker A: You guys know I have the utmost respect for, just, like, the long term building mindset you've had going back to Yevgani and the rest of the team. I think he started building Xerion back in 2017 or like 2018.
00:39:29.590 - 00:39:36.194, Speaker B: We're ogs. Not me, as I said at the beginning. But the team is definitely, I was.
00:39:36.232 - 00:40:05.950, Speaker A: Like, whoa, dude, I forget they were like, building. The co founders were building before Defi was Defi. Well, I want to remind everyone, too, they should follow Xerion on Twitter. You can go to Zerion IO, obviously, to get started and check out all the products we showed off here today, including the defi dashboard. And then you can follow Alex there as well. Hopefully we'll be able to do this in the future. And then most importantly, you can get started at Xerion IO slash DNA.
00:40:05.950 - 00:40:22.254, Speaker A: And if you enjoyed this, subscribe@defiedad.com if you're a builder like the savages at Xerion, please reach out to me and my team at Fourth Revolution Capital. We'd love to partner with you and otherwise, Alex, anything else you want to say before we go?
00:40:22.372 - 00:40:30.006, Speaker B: Just thanks so much. I really enjoyed it. And yeah, if anybody who wants to hear more about DNA, send me a message. We'll chat. DMs are open.
00:40:30.188 - 00:40:35.780, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, yeah. Hey, thanks so much and hope everyone has a great day. Thanks for joining. We'll see you next time.
