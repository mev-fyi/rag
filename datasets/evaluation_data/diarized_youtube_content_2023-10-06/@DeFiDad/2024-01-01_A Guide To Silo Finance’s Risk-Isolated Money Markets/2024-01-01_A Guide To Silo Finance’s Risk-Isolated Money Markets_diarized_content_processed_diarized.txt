00:00:00.170 - 00:00:38.578, Speaker A: So if you are a usdc depositor into AAvE, anyone holding the crypto whitelisted on Ave could borrow your USDC. So you could not say, for example, I'm only lending my USDC to users collateralizing ETH, staked ETH. And that's it. That's my risk. So the problem that we solved it by creating small pools, separated each pool is a separate smart contract. There's no systemic risk. So that USDC user now can deposit, let's say USDC in one isolated market and managing risk better.
00:00:38.578 - 00:00:51.710, Speaker A: And of course that creates a lot of benefits. So definitely risk management, better risk management. Second, some other markets, other isolated markets naturally would pay you higher rates for your USDC deposit.
00:00:54.050 - 00:01:48.320, Speaker B: Hey everyone, welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's show spotlights silo Finance, a DeFi protocol on Ethereum and arbitrum for creating risk isolated lending markets different than a shared pool lending protocol. With a single pool lending market for all supported assets, such as AavE, silo uses an isolated pool approach where every token asset has its own lending market. Users or projects can propose new markets to be voted on to support blue chip assets such as ETH, LSTs, as well as long tail assets or even LPs not found on the largest money markets. In this episode, we'll discuss how this approach can provide us more choices and more controls as lenders and borrowers in defi money markets, as well as future plans for silo, including the implementation of vToconomics. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.
00:01:48.320 - 00:02:27.158, Speaker B: For most of us, our crypto journey started with Metamask, and now with Metamask portfolio, we can do so much more. Metamask portfolio puts you in control. Use the dashboard to see all your assets and balances across your wallets in one place. The buy feature allows us to buy crypto assets effortlessly with fiat options such as PayPal or credit card. The swap feature allows us to swap any tokens anytime by finding a selection of available rates. The bridge feature allows us to bridge between networks, including Ethereum, L1s and L two s, based on the best price and fastest delivery time. And with the stake feature, anyone in a few clicks can stake ETH and earn rewards.
00:02:27.158 - 00:02:45.758, Speaker B: Do more in web3 your way with a safe, simple and convenient tool that's all in one place. Track and manage your web3 everything at Metamask IO portfolio Mike, before we get back to the show, can you explain what is liquid restaking everybody at.
00:02:45.764 - 00:03:29.082, Speaker C: This point is familiar with liquid staking. It lets you take your staked ETH mint, a liquid staking token, and then use that token in defi. Well, the hottest thing in staking right now is restaking. It's the ability to reuse your staked ETH to provide Ethereum's trust layer to other services that want to benefit from it, services like data availability layers, Oracle networks, other blockchains, and beyond. The benefit of restaking is that you get to earn additional staking rewards on top of your normal staking rewards. Well, currently, if you want to restake your ETH, your only option is to lock up your ETH. The reason that's a problem is because you can't use your restaked ETH in Defi.
00:03:29.082 - 00:03:54.274, Speaker C: We are launching ETH, the Etherfi liquid restaking token, because with liquid restaking, users get the benefit of staking rewards, restaking rewards, and they get to collect loyalty points for Etherfi and Eigen layer through this token. So it's the easiest way to get exposure to two up and coming early protocols and on top of that, get all the benefits of staking and restaking.
00:03:54.402 - 00:04:00.060, Speaker B: To learn more about ETH, liquid staking and liquid restaking, go to ether five.
00:04:02.110 - 00:04:43.670, Speaker D: It all started so simply with cryptokitties and maker on Ethereum, but quickly became complex with more applications and many chains. Today, everyone agrees UX issues are the biggest blocker standing in the way of crypto adoption. Introducing avocado multi chain UX. Redesigned from the ground up, the first wallet to abstract networks, accounts and gas one gas tank to pay transaction fees on all chains in USDC and native access to instadap's powerful custom DeFi strategies. Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:44.250 - 00:04:51.450, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce AJ, a founding contributor to silo finance. AJ, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:51.520 - 00:04:53.722, Speaker A: Doing great. Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.
00:04:53.776 - 00:06:12.510, Speaker B: I know we've talked quite a bit over the years with Silo, and I've written up multiple tutorials over the years because Silo was a very unique protocol from the time it launched. There are these shared pool lending protocols that we're all very accustomed to, like Aave, and there's a different approach there to Silo. I want to say that you all were like kind of a pioneer trailblazer in building this type of protocol. And just this year, nomadic and I have recorded quite a few podcasts with other founders, some of those founders also being OG Defi founders who have come around to believing that siloing money markets might be a more secure approach, might be even a more scalable approach than what we've seen with the likes of Abe and compound. So, anyways, just excited to kind of dig in with you. What's new with Silo, what's next, and how you see yourself fitting into the DFI landscape going into 2024. But before we talk a little bit more about Silo, can you share anything more about your background and maybe the origin story of building Silo?
00:06:12.590 - 00:07:08.114, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I'm super excited to tell you about Silo and know Silo actually comes thanks to Kashi and Rari, of two and OGs behind those protocols that I wish they had continued. Really have utmost respect to founders. So, 2021, a few of us DFI OGs thought, well, definitely we need to have money markets for some of the token assets that we've farmed, and there's no way you could get them listed on ave and compound. We just entered the hackathon, came up with the idea, the design, and then raised, actually just by doing a token auction through gnosis, batch auction. So with access, of course, restricted in the US, but outside the US was accessible to really any user. We wanted to go that route, we'd not want to go the VC routes.
00:07:08.114 - 00:07:51.650, Speaker A: And we raised a bunch. And then from there, we assembled the team and started coding, really the real version. And in August we launched. And since then, been a grind, really trying to get funds into the money markets and encourage borrowers as well, telling them about the benefits of risk isolation. That's really the key that we're bringing to the table here, is basically how do we give users better way to manage risk? That's it. It's very simple. I think users still need to split their portfolio among two to three lending protocols, and we hope that Silo will be one of them, in addition to, of course, the OGs.
00:07:51.650 - 00:08:39.154, Speaker A: So that's really the thesis here. The silo is really a great story because we just built it from the ground up. New code, hiring, really, we kind of followed the Silicon Valley approach in terms of developing the simplest minimum viable product and rolling it out and finding product market fit and really the whole nine yards of building a company. So it's been really a challenge. Every day is a challenge. Every day is a great day, actually, for us. We're about 1213 people and ten of us are full time.
00:08:39.154 - 00:08:50.454, Speaker A: The rest is just help us out with math and research and all of it. So it's small team, very efficient, and very slow to release as well. We take our time.
00:08:50.572 - 00:09:07.578, Speaker E: AJ, let's get a bit more into silo defi. Dad kind of teased it a bit in the intro here, but I would love to hear it kind of in your words, just at a high level, what silo is and how it differs from, I guess, lending platforms that people may be familiar with as well.
00:09:07.664 - 00:09:47.890, Speaker A: Right? So the key here is to probably giving an example of the great. So if you are a USDC depositor into, technically, anyone holding the crypto whitelisted on Ave could borrow your USDC. So you could not say, for example, I'm only lending my USDC to users collateralizing ETH, staked ETH. And that's it. That's my risk. You cannot, once you deposit your USDC, your risk exposure or your risk is exposed, entire crypto asset in the pool. So there's no way you could segregate that.
00:09:47.890 - 00:10:47.750, Speaker A: Even with risk isolation that I have today, it's really capped, so it doesn't solve the problem. So the problem that we solved it by creating small pools separated each pool is a separate smart contract. There's no systemic risk. So that USDC user now can deposit, let's say, USDC in one isolated market and managing risk better. So for example, on arbitrary, we have about 15 markets, one of them, let's say the lido wrap staked ETH market, that is paired with USDC and ETH. You can say, as a USDC user, I can say like, okay, I'm depositing that specific market, and only users depositing either ETH or wrapped version of lido can borrow my asset, and that's it. So if you have other assets they cannot borrow, so you're basically choosing your risk, customizing the risk, modulating your risk.
00:10:47.750 - 00:11:15.358, Speaker A: Exactly why we created silo. And of course, that creates a lot of benefits. So definitely risk management, better risk management. Second, some other markets, other isolated markets naturally would pay you higher rates for your USDC deposit. So if you're lending to a risky asset, you should expect higher returns. Now, in Ave, that's not possible because they have only one interest rate curve. For all USDC depositors, it's always 3%, 4%.
00:11:15.358 - 00:11:52.490, Speaker A: However, for a riskier asset, maybe some you deem risky, but maybe if they pay you, let's say average 15 or 20% APR, that is enough to justify the risk you're taking. And you could maybe allocate a little bit of your portfolio, not your entire USDC deposit, which is not possible on other lending protocols. So technically speaking, risk management, better risk management, and unoptimized yield as well, because now you could allocate some of your portfolio to higher yielding markets. And that's really what risk isolation. The benefits of risk isolation and lending.
00:11:52.570 - 00:13:01.414, Speaker B: Yeah. When you get into the silo app, what might confuse some, if they've only used something like AAVE, is you just have a lot more choice. You get in there, you have all these markets, and historically, for folks in the future who listen to this, there is an option that will no longer be there, which is this zi stablecoin, which we'll talk a little bit about. But in the past, you would look, and you would normally have the two choices of, you could lend ETH. So as a lender, I might say I want to lend it at a higher rate to something riskier or at a lower rate to something that's not as risky. And then I also have the option of this Zai stablecoin. And so anyways, I think, yeah, what's been really powerful about that is just the controls, the optionality that Silo has provided, which I do remember thinking early on that maybe there was too much choice and that just dumbing it down the way that an Abe shared pool sort of approach does it.
00:13:01.414 - 00:13:44.626, Speaker B: But now, as we go into 2024, we're finding all these other protocols are sort of like reinventing themselves and clearly taking some inspiration from what you've done. We had instadap on with, they have fluid coming, and fluid is taking a somewhat siloed approach. And I think Morpho blue to some degree, has been influenced by what you've done there. One of the things that we called out, though, is the permissionless creation of money markets. Can you just quickly walk us through what is the process behind that? I can't just go in and just create any money market. Right. I do have to get some sort of buy in or process in place.
00:13:44.728 - 00:14:25.266, Speaker A: Definitely the team has to deploy it and we have to activate the oracle for you in order to get the market. And in the beginning, we wanted to do permissionless creation of markets, the uniswap and cashy type. But then we thought, well, let's first learn how that goes. Because with Rari, unfortunately, there was a lot of confusion, although Rari was completely permissionless, but a lot of people did not really understand not. And the team had really nothing to do with it and had some issues, some pools getting exploited due to an oracle. Of course not anything else. So we thought, well, let's just have some control over it.
00:14:25.266 - 00:15:24.050, Speaker A: At least you could delist a market list. A market so the list is actually, the process is quite simple. You contact us or tell us or whatever, like you want to deploy a market and we'll look at it. If there's an oracle and if there is enough liquidity, if we can liquidate, we'll launch it. A lot of assets are not liquid enough to be worthy to have a money market, unfortunately. So this is going to change of course going forward, and we'll talk about the roadmap in a it. But right now, we just normal conversation with the team, request through any of our channels, including Twitter, and we'll deploy it if we can fulfill our basic responsibility here, which is making sure that at least in the beginning, there is a good oracle to work with, a second we can.
00:15:24.050 - 00:16:30.198, Speaker A: Liquidations are possible. You've touched actually on a point, really important point, which is now you could deposit USDC on ten markets on side of arbitram, and you could probably earn now with the rewards, with the OD rewards, you could earn from something between seven to 13%, which is really great for a stable coin. And so how do you handle that? And honestly speaking, that's great, because for us, each silo is only designed to match lenders and borrowers in an obvious, without obfuscating risk. So now if I'm a USDC user, I'm only really matching you with someone who's willing to borrow your USDC user with Eve. Now the risk is not obfuscated. It's clear you're matching two users with two clear collaterals, unlike other protocols where you don't know who's borrowing your USDC anyway. The market should cap at one point, and this cap, we think the logical cap should be proportional to how much liquidity available on Dexes in order to liquidate.
00:16:30.198 - 00:17:03.614, Speaker A: Remember what happened with curve? It grew really massively in relation to liquidity available, and that created some systemic risk. Obviously, to aave in silo, it does not create systemic risk, only creates risk for those who's lending stablecoin to curve depositors. So these are really just your matching users, technically speaking, and risk really just the marketplace. Your matching lender has lender on borrower. And that's it. Yes. You have a lot of choices.
00:17:03.614 - 00:17:37.662, Speaker A: If it happens that you trust multiple collateral, you could split your portfolio, or you could rebalance, which is possible in arbitram. It creates issues on main net because of gas. You have to remove all the time, remove each, let's say, from a market to another. But that's something that I think we will solve in V two. And other protocols can build on top of us. You've mentioned other developers also. They're coming up with their own vault layers that should do this.
00:17:37.662 - 00:17:44.178, Speaker A: Rebalancing among a set of markets you trust without having you doing it all the time.
00:17:44.264 - 00:18:07.158, Speaker E: AJ, you mentioned arbitram. I'm curious just kind of what pattern you're seeing with users between, I guess, your Ethereum mainet offering and arbitram offering. Are you seeing a lot of flow of liquidity to arbitram now? Is that vision kind of starting to play out, or where are your users mostly congregated right now?
00:18:07.244 - 00:18:36.098, Speaker A: Definitely arbitram. Arbitrum. We have about, I think, 90 million in terms of value locked, which is a metric we don't care much about. But we have about 33 million, I think, borrowed, which is really, that's what matters to us. What matters to us. So you'd be surprised when gas is cheap, that opens up a lot of possibility. Arbitrum is a well mature ecosystem, incredibly collaborative, by the way.
00:18:36.098 - 00:19:24.240, Speaker A: There is just a sense of, for example, we've got radiant tweeting silo, which is technically two lending protocols. We do the same, and the support they've given us, actually our tokens as rewards to push their radiant that we listed. We actually have a radiant silo of lending markets for radiant, for example, radiant token. You've got a lot of collaborative ecosystem you don't see on Mainnet and also with other. So it's well, mature. So you see users, because gas is cheap, you see users collaborating or executing sophisticated yield strategies, like basically leverage strategies. So they borrow USDC from us, they deposit it somewhere else, they take another loan and then use it somewhere else.
00:19:24.240 - 00:20:17.874, Speaker A: And of course, lots of rebalancing. So if you earn 8% on your USDC and now it pays 9% on another market, you just remove it and deposit it for this 9%. So constant rebalancing because it's cheap to do so. So definitely in terms of traction, if you don't define traction in terms of also through the frequency of doing something, definitely it has a lot of traction. We've got a few hundred users daily. Users use our app daily constantly, again, leveraging their positions and looking for opportunities. So that's something really important.
00:20:17.874 - 00:20:37.698, Speaker A: And also, again, as I say, the arbor term, because there's so much variety as far as applications, between money markets, derivatives and all, it kind of invites you to use the chain more. And lending is just part of it, really.
00:20:37.804 - 00:21:35.498, Speaker B: The difference between these three markets is really interesting. So if you go to app silo finance, you've got the Ethereum main net markets, which is, I think those are your oldest markets. And then we've got arbitrum and then the llama edition, which we're going to talk about in a minute. And yeah, I did not realize that arbitram alone holds, as of our recording today, around December twelveth, 2023, it holds about 90 million. And as you pointed out, TvL is sometimes a helpful metric, but it doesn't tell the full story. That said, it's a pretty impressive number to see that, especially when you flip over to the llama edition and you see close to 200 million. So clearly silo is growing on arbitrum as an L two.
00:21:35.498 - 00:22:05.386, Speaker B: For all the reasons you pointed out, gas is cheap. It's a lot easier to come up with interesting strategies there on the Llama edition. Can you walk us through this? How did this come about? Why did you start building for markets that would support the curve USD stablecoin, and then also maybe some reflection on why you will no longer offer Zai as a stablecoin.
00:22:05.518 - 00:22:38.702, Speaker A: Right. So honestly, we had a llama version just because our smart contracts enforce having a single asset as a bridge asset across all markets. So traditionally, when we started silo, we had ETH and Zai. Now, if you want to create a new market, you must pair them with ETH and Zai. You cannot pair them with USDC, for example. That was a limitation in the smart contracts and the design. And now this goes away, of course, in Z two.
00:22:38.702 - 00:23:14.834, Speaker A: So when curve USD was released, I was super excited. We were super excited about it. We're still super excited about it. Of course, as a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, we wanted to create lending markets for it. I'll tell you in a bit then. But the issue was we could not add it to our markets because we had Xi and E, so we had to deploy a completely new protocol, obviously the same smart contracts, and hurt the security of those legacy ones. And now we created curvy SD markets.
00:23:14.834 - 00:23:58.274, Speaker A: So you have link with Curvy SD, you have Wifi with USD, and of course curve, the governance token. Now, why? Because I personally and the team, we believe that we need a stablecoin like that. And lending is an incredibly important growth lever for any stablecoin. Stablecoins only grow if you denominate as much debt as possible, because you pay interest in the stablecoin itself. So technically speaking, the more interest you generate, the more supply you need to the more supply for the stablecoin. That's number one. And because also it serves as, because of the interest created, there's always a pressure on the peg upwards.
00:23:58.274 - 00:24:26.034, Speaker A: So it helps actually with stabilizing the peg for the stable coin. So we felt like, well, this is a new primitive, the stablecoin. We were a believer in the curve ecosystem. We're close to it, we've always been close to it. And also users of curve. Well, let's bet on this stable coin. And we had to deploy it and it happened at the time when curve was removed or was forced out of ave v two.
00:24:26.034 - 00:24:47.834, Speaker A: So we thought, well, maybe that we can convince Michael to move some of his position. And he did. And curve USD users started borrowing curvesd and then wanted home for it. So it was just a good timing for silo Lama. Yeah.
00:24:47.872 - 00:25:51.566, Speaker E: AJ I think tying somewhat tying yourself to the success or future success of Curve is never a bad idea, in my opinion. And yeah, I mean, it seems like one of those win win scenarios. I think Curve USD is super interesting and I think it's just getting started and I think it's going to be a big player in this cycle for sure. So you're kind of in at the ground floor, in my opinion. That kind of just leads me to a question though, about your current silo token. What are the visions in the community for the silo token? Has there been anything interesting offered up as far as potentially new utility? And correct me, is silo currently a V token or does it have that functionality, or is that even something that would be considered on the roadmap? Just kind of seeing this synergy with curve now and maybe that whole convex family. I'm kind of speculating now.
00:25:51.748 - 00:26:13.026, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'll tell you a little bit about the roadmap. So v two hopefully comes out in q one. 2024. At the center there is a V model. Obviously we're all thankful for V to economics innovated by the curve people. So V silo will be at the center of it.
00:26:13.026 - 00:27:13.634, Speaker A: So we abandon the current governor Bravo model that we have, which is varied by a compound, and we move into the V model at the center. Our markets are going to be not be any governance for the market. It would be immutable. Probably the first time I share this v silo, it's going to be modeled closer to the V balancer. So you can mint it with you lock Silo and with a little bit of ETH and you mint v silo, v silo, you can use it to vote for rewards in Silo itself, cross chain. So we've worked with Chainlink CCIP on that, so you'd be able to vote for your own, for the markets that you use. If it happens that you're also a depositor and a holder of vsilo or a borrower, you earn boosted the yield.
00:27:13.634 - 00:27:53.358, Speaker A: So that utility is definitely there. There is also a functionality of turned off by default to share revenue protocol with v silo holders. Now, similar to uniswap and other protocols, the functionality is built a little bit complicated to execute, but it is definitely built turned off. It's up to the Dow or Vsido holders to vote to turn it on or not. So that's the major functionality. So you get boost, of course for your borrower and a holder of the governance token. And of course you vote for emissions.
00:27:53.358 - 00:28:41.378, Speaker A: And most importantly, there is a path for you to get something out of the protocol revenue that is more complicated to discuss and activate, of course, but that's what it is. So this all comes out in V one. The Vsilo is already developed audited. We're actually in the process with trail of bits right now. The first of three audits. Vsilo is completely audited. Hopefully we launch the roadmap next month once the audits is complete, and we'll kind of outline our next leg of growth and how we're going to bring more growth to all the domain net and of course the EVM compatible ones.
00:28:41.378 - 00:29:16.986, Speaker A: Now this curve USD, just on that note, just one note, we have kind of like Curve USD is a great growth blueprint for all stablecoins. I want to see, honestly, lesd denominating that. I want to see reserve stablecoin denominating debt, not just centralized one. Because again, that's the more users will always borrow stable coins against collateral. They just need to be there. Right? So CurveUSD, I think we've seen the growth in its supply. It's correlated with the time that we launched Curve USD llama or the llama version.
00:29:16.986 - 00:30:06.842, Speaker A: Now, I think it's a great success story for all stablecoin issuers that would like to do that. Now, why we sunseted or we're sunsetting Zai as a stablecoin, because we've discovered that it's going to be very expensive to create and maintain a stable coin. If you want to maintain the peg itself, you have to spend on that. And traditionally you have to always ensure you have very deep liquidity at the peg and you have to incentivize LPs to keep that liquidity at the peg in curve pools. And that will just honestly always be larger than all the profits. That revenue I'm going to make from that stable coin. So as a lending protocol, we thought that was just an experiment that probably shouldn't materialize.
00:30:06.842 - 00:30:13.226, Speaker A: Now, Zy v two real world asset backed is definitely a possibility that we're exploring.
00:30:13.338 - 00:30:33.400, Speaker E: Oh, that sounds cool. Zy v two RWA. One other thing I was thinking of here that I want to ask before we wrap is just with v silo, is there going to be any support, you think, from the convex community or ecosystem on that? Is that something you're discussing with that team at all?
00:30:33.930 - 00:31:02.698, Speaker A: No, we have not discussed this. And it is possible, and it's possible that we get what's quote unquote convict or whatever the word, it is possible. Personally, we don't see that we're not going to actively seek it. If it happens, it happens. If not, I think the growth mechanism and the reason to hold the silo lock silo for Vsilo is present in the system itself.
00:31:02.884 - 00:31:56.450, Speaker B: If I could make a request, maybe consider in the future once Vsilo is up and running. I love what prisma and f of x have done with convex. If you're like earning rewards, let's say in the future, you're providing liquidity for silo. You can either claim your silo rewards, which might be in like a vesting contract, or you can claim it as like a CVX silo, which I love that concept. It's still really new. To be clear, it's pretty high risk. Like I would tell any user, if they're claiming CVX Prisma or CVX FXN, we're all fairly confident that liquidity will build there.
00:31:56.450 - 00:32:47.358, Speaker B: But you're basically taking something that's liquid now that is not at peg versus holding something that vests. So anyways, long story short, I think it's on the convex community, given the value that silo provides. I know nomadic and I have discussed, we kind of see Silo in that it's like the curve family. Some are almost like brother sisters in law, some are like second cousins. And Silo is in that for sure. So I'm very curious how curve and convex will continue to think about how to add value, I guess, to Silo, because you're doing quite a bit now for curve, for the curve USD token. You're really helping to bootstrap more interest there in using that token.
00:32:47.358 - 00:33:24.814, Speaker B: But AG, this is a great place for us to wrap up. So I want to just quickly remind our listeners that a first, they should learn about silo Finance by going to silo finance, they should follow silofinance on Twitter at silo Finance. They can follow you on your personal account on Twitter. It's aiham underscore ETH. And then AJ just wanted to state the obvious, like thanks so much for coming on. We really enjoyed getting to learn more about Silo. There's quite a bit there you shared that I was totally unaware of.
00:33:24.814 - 00:33:36.286, Speaker B: So excited that we could learn a little bit more about what's coming with Vsilo. But anything else you'd like to share before we go? Any recommendations for folks that want to get involved with Silo?
00:33:36.478 - 00:33:52.374, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Thank you so much for having me. Really, like you say, just to go and try to silo and learn about risk, isolation, and lending. Grateful for the great conversation and looking forward to having another one, hopefully next year.
00:33:52.492 - 00:34:05.010, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
