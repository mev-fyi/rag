00:00:00.330 - 00:00:35.270, Speaker A: On Ethereum, the kind of the protocol layer is very agnostic and removed from what is happening on the application layer. That's kind of created a situation where we have these kind of like champions or giants of the application layer trying to accrue value. But for Kanto, we're sort of like, hey, what if the protocol layer and the application layer were more integrated and some of these core d five primitives on the application layer were actually just free public infrastructure?
00:00:38.010 - 00:01:23.894, Speaker B: Welcome to the Edge podcast. I'm DFI dad here with nomadic from four Rc. Today's episode breaks down what you need to know about Kanto, the Cosmos based EVM blockchain built for the DFI movement. Launched in August 2022, this grassroots chain made waves for flipping the design of L ones on its head by implementing built in primitives such as its own stablecoin called Note, the Kanto Dex and the Kanto lending market. In this episode, legendary DFI builder and Kanto contributor Scott Lewis joins us to share the latest on their product roadmap, what makes Kanto unique among blockchain networks and how they apply a product first mindset to building a community from scratch. But before we do, just a quick word from our sponsors who make the edge podcast possible.

Avocado one wallet to rule all chains.
00:04:32.870 - 00:04:38.806, Speaker B: All right, let's introduce Scott Lewis, a contributor to Kanto. Scott, welcome to the Edge podcast. How are you doing?
00:04:38.908 - 00:04:40.662, Speaker A: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.
00:04:40.716 - 00:05:33.800, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for joining us. It's really good to be able to reconnect some background to having known you over the years. Know Scott has always been early to trends that have become very mainstream in Defi. It starts with the fact that Scott is the founder of Defi Pulse. They actually coined the term total value locked, which if you know the history of DeFi, the run up really, I believe was fueled by an ability for the community to rally around this TVL metric. He would go on to invent the dex aggregator, work on countless other protocols, and now his full time attention is here on Kanto. And the motivation behind our discussion here today is to help folks to level up, to get caught up on all you need to know about Kanto in 2024.
00:05:33.800 - 00:06:02.678, Speaker B: There are a number of aspects to the way it's designed that we're noticing are becoming standards in other L ones and L two s. So hopefully this will bring you up to speed. And Scott, why don't we just then kick off with a little bit more about your background working in DFI over the years? I guess, what else can you share in terms of the highlights real of what you've worked on. And then we'll get right into Canto.
00:06:02.794 - 00:07:00.830, Speaker A: Yeah, so pre crypto, I was a trader for eleven years, options, volatility, arbitrage, prop trading, starting my career at Sasquahana International Group. Got into Ethereum late 2016, early 2017 doing ICOs and then perp swaps. And then sort of my first experiment building was an anti scam due diligence site for ICOs and kind of like had a lot of fun with that, was more of a public service project, and then started trying to build stuff in the ecosystem with, as you mentioned, like Defi Pulse and also Dex AG, which is now slingshot after a rebrand and yeah, just been having fun building different projects and now, yeah, focus on Ganto, now it's a contributor.
00:07:00.910 - 00:07:05.730, Speaker E: Scott, can you maybe walk us through what the motivation was to build Kanto?
00:07:05.810 - 00:08:04.118, Speaker A: Yeah, so we sort of had a kind of front row seat to the emergence and development and maturation of DeFi on Ethereum. And on Ethereum, the kind of the protocol layer is very agnostic and removed from what is happening on the application layer. That's kind of created a situation where we have these kind of like champions or giants of the application layer trying to accrue value. But for Kanto, we're sort of like, hey, what if the protocol layer and the application layer were more integrated and some of these core DeFi primitives on the application layer were actually just free public infrastructure, just like kind know how you have kind know street sweepers in New York City or a subway system. Can we have d five primitives that are like that?
00:08:04.204 - 00:09:12.990, Speaker B: What you've done with Kanto is really interesting, because if you look at other l ones and l two s, they exist as like this core infrastructure that we need to confirm our transactions. And it does that one thing, and hopefully it does it well. But what you've done, what the canto community, I guess, ultimately has done, is wrapped up some of the core primitives that we need for it to be successful. So, for example, we interviewed the founder of Mode recently, which is like a D five focused L two, and they have to rely upon startups to build amms and lending markets. But there are these core features of a lending market and an AmM rolled up into Kanto, which I believe has been a part of the success of bootstrapping the network. So maybe we should start to just get into that sort of core infrastructure that's like a public good. And actually three of those core pieces we want to cover is there's note, which is a stable coin.
00:09:12.990 - 00:09:25.902, Speaker B: There's a lot more going on under the hood. There's the Kanto lending market, and then there's the Kanto Dex. Can you start to talk us through what is the design behind this Kanto note?
00:09:26.046 - 00:10:30.318, Speaker A: Yeah, so note is a over collateralized stablecoin. It started to be backed by T bills. It'll be transition being fully backed by T bills. And note is kind of issued by the Kanto lending market when people borrow it that have collateral at Kanto lending market, kind of like how you have assets at Makerdao and then you borrow die to bring it into the world. And then note is also a little bit unique because there's no one trying to monetize a borrow and lend spread on note. The interest rate you can borrow note at is the same interest rate that you can lend note at, and sort of feel like that's kind of an advantage of the free public infrastructure approach. And then the main Kanto lending market is basically the collateralization engine for note.
00:10:30.318 - 00:11:02.406, Speaker A: And then Kanto Dex is a solidly fork. And so it has Xyk pools. It has like typical XY equals K Amm pools, and then also has some stablecoin focus pools as our option. And the canto Dexo is different because the LP fees are zero and there's no fee switch. And so that liquidity is just incentivized by the L one governance streaming Kanto to the LPs.
00:11:02.538 - 00:11:34.618, Speaker B: So just to clarify, if I am an LP in the Kanto Dex, I'm not earning any sort of trading fees, right? And simultaneously, those traders are benefiting from the ability to trade for free. They don't have to pay the 30 basis points or whatever, uniswap and everyone else charges the yield though there because there is a yield that folks are earning as LPs. Is that all Kanto token, or is there anything else I'm missing there?
00:11:34.704 - 00:11:40.762, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all Kanto token. It just streamed to the LPs, Scott.
00:11:40.826 - 00:12:05.538, Speaker E: Just kind of like thinking through. So if there's a Dex and a lending market at the protocol level, I guess, what is the incentivization for other builders and developers to come in and build dexs and lending markets? Can you kind of walk us through that? Because, yeah, I don't understand what the drive would be.
00:12:05.624 - 00:12:32.526, Speaker A: So for a canto lending market, it really only supports lending or borrowing against bridge stables and T bills. And so if a developer thought there was demand for people to use Kanto as collateral and borrow stable coins, against that, like we saw Ave and Kanban, first product, you would not actually be competing with the Kanto lending market.
00:12:32.628 - 00:12:59.234, Speaker B: Yeah, makes sense. So in the kanto lending market, we've got f bill. If Bill and USYC, for those of us who aren't familiar with those, are those tokens that are issued by another protocol, or is that also wrapped up into the core infrastructure of Kanto?
00:12:59.362 - 00:13:28.606, Speaker A: Those are kind of artifact compliance, RWA tokens. Fbill. And if Bill are issued by fortunify, which is one of the OGS RWA issuers in the space, and then USYC is issued by Hashnote. Hashnote is kind of incubated and supported by DRW, which is one of the largest trading firms in the world.
00:13:28.708 - 00:13:47.990, Speaker E: Wow. Let's maybe key in on the RWA trend a little bit more, because I feel like Kanto has been fairly early to that wave. And there's also a term that I hear about in Kanto called neo finance. Maybe break that down for us as well, and how that kind of relates to RWAs.
00:13:48.890 - 00:14:43.346, Speaker A: Yeah. So neo finance isn't really a thesis. It's more just tries to be a better descriptor. When we think about finance on chain, generally, it's always been deFi, but RWAs don't behave just like protocol tokens or stablecoins in that they do have compliance gating, and they have different compliance needs than just sending ETH around. And so the finance that you're doing with RWAS doesn't feel like decentralized finance to us. And so it also doesn't feel quite like traditional finance. And so we thought neo finance was kind of a good descriptor, so they would be clear and that users would kind of understand they don't have the same decentralization guarantees or properties they would have when they're using Defi.
00:14:43.458 - 00:15:26.134, Speaker B: Scott, with RWAs, Kanto was really early to this movement, and they've grown a lot like RWA related. Defi has grown a lot over the past year, which has coincided with rates being up. So we're all expecting the Fed to cut rates at some point this year. What are your thoughts on RWAs? I think being pretty dependent at this point on folks who want to earn T bill yield on, like, do you see where the puck might be headed next? Do you think rates being cut will affect the RWA Defi markets, or maybe it'll have no effect?
00:15:26.252 - 00:16:19.806, Speaker A: Yeah, I think when you're thinking about T bills on chain, you're sort of comparing that to maybe your dollar interest. You'd earn in a savings account. And by and large, those interest you're earning on those dollars will also be sort of indirectly affected by that short term interest rate for dollars that you see in T bills. So, like, if T bill rate was 6% and you're getting maybe 4% in a traditional checking account, if the T bill rate drops to 4%, you might only be getting 2% in that traditional savings account. Obviously every bank is different, but kind of the relative competition would probably not reflect badly on RWAs.
00:16:19.998 - 00:16:47.230, Speaker F: DeFi enables a whole new world of trading and yield opportunities. Sometimes we all wish we had a little bit bigger of a budget so we can make the most out of it. That's why we created blueberry. Blueberry lets you access the best opportunities on Ethereum all in one easy to use terminal. You can access five X, ten X, or even 20 x your money in one click, more than any other lending market, so you can maximize your earnings only on blueberry.
00:16:49.970 - 00:17:57.080, Speaker G: Maverick protocol provides innovative liquidity solutions for token projects to customize, automate, and incentivize their liquidity with the highest efficiency in DeFi, all powered by Maverick Amm why has Maverick become the first choice for all kinds of token projects, from stablecoins to LRTs as the first dynamic distribution? Amm Maverick AmM provides automated liquidity movement modes, which move your liquidity to follow price, keeping it where it does the most good. This enables maverick powered pools to process higher volume with lower TVL requirements, and means that Maverick supports the highest capital efficiency for LRTs. Like we ETH, Maverick Amm also supports non uniform liquidity distributions, making it easy to concentrate liquidity in shapes that fit each project's individual needs. Finally, Maverick boosted positions maximize incentive efficiency for protocols looking to bootstrap their token liquidity to precise strategic areas of a liquidity pool. Token communities like Lido, Aave, Swell, Etherfi, and Kelpdao have been bootstrapping TVL and maintaining peg using Maverick tools ready to build liquidity with maximal efficiency. Go to App Mav xyZ theedgepodcast today.
00:17:59.130 - 00:18:25.246, Speaker E: Scott, we kind of alluded to this in the beginning, but another trend that we're seeing a lot of these other L two s, and maybe some L ones do, is try and incentivize developers or users in new ways. Something that, again, Kanto kind of pioneered earlier on is this CSR contract secured revenue. Can you explain what's kind of going on under the hood with that?
00:18:25.348 - 00:19:21.360, Speaker A: So before CSR, there were some different experiments with dev rebates, but they required centralized curation. But what CSR did that was a little different, is when you deploy a contract that kind of goes through a turnstile and you get kind of an NFT associated with that contract, and it's just at a protocol layer and no one permits you or unpermits you from doing it. And then the protocol kind of meters all the gas usage that all these smart contracts are running, and that at any time, if you own that NFT, you can claim a portion of that metered gas. And so it's essentially a way to share transaction fees with devs, but without having any high friction coordination problems.
00:19:21.730 - 00:20:00.006, Speaker E: Yeah, very cool. Something else I've been reading about just prior to this was this big upgrade called the Callisto upgrade, and I was a bit confused because it sounds like a pretty big upgrade to the current Kanto network. But then there's also this, I believe, upcoming migration. At some point that I was reading about with Kanto migrating to a zkl two powered by Polygon CDK. Are those two things separate or are they all at all similar? Can you maybe just describe what those, I guess, big upgrades are?
00:20:00.128 - 00:21:17.560, Speaker A: Yeah, so the callisto upgrade is upgrading Kanto with Cosmos SDK version 0.5. That upgrade kind of provides different performance improvements, the one that will most directly affect users. It'll let the block time get down to subsecond block time, which will kind of improve UX and just make using Kanto easier. And then the polygon CDK and Zke Evm. A lot of people think of polygon as just building a ZK roll up, but actually kind of their offering is a bit broader than that. Kanto when we upgrade, we will be kind of proving Kanto like zk proving Kanto into Polygon's proving protocol or algorithm, which will give Kanto trustless zk bridging, which is pretty unique and useful in my opinion. But we won't be moving to a single sequencer model that we see in other l two s.
00:21:17.560 - 00:21:39.350, Speaker A: We plan to keep the validators and proof of stake so there's still decentralized transaction inclusion and kind of trying to get this best of both worlds with kind of like the decentralization on block producing, but also the trustlessness.
00:21:39.510 - 00:22:03.230, Speaker B: I know when we talk about all of this core consensus infrastructure type of stuff, I'm immediately thinking about staking. So with the Kanto token, I know that if you go to Kanto IO staking, it looks like we can stake Kanto for 5.24% APR.
00:22:03.390 - 00:22:35.406, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just like basically block rewards paid out epoch by epoch to different validators. It's a cosmos SDK flavor of staking, but for an Ethereum audience, it's like economically similar with some differences to the Ethereum model. But yeah, it's just kind of like the model people are familiar with.
00:22:35.508 - 00:23:14.726, Speaker B: I feel like that's something we left off in this conversation. When you launched, when Kanto launched, I remember recognizing that this is a Cosmos chain that is EVM compatible. That allowed me to use something like metamask that I was already using, I guess. What else can you share about that? Was there an intent there to try to attract folks who might already be using Ethereum and Ethereum l two s who maybe hadn't ever tried anything in the cosmos ecosystem?
00:23:14.838 - 00:24:48.726, Speaker A: I mean, I would say most of the early contributors, not all, there were some Cosmos centric early contributors, but many of the early Kanto contributors were just Ethereum people. And so we were sort of very familiar with why solidity is easy to develop smart contracts with and kind of the large infrastructure and large tooling and large community developers familiar with that. But at the same time, just because Cosmos kind of with their app chain thesis and just there's a lot of cosmos chains out there prioritizing safety, just that Cosmos SDK has been battle tested and is battle hardened with lots of usage in different ways and people trying to break it a lot. And so we felt like that was a good, secure option to build the protocol layer of the JNOD and kind of the Evmos team building with a grant from the Cosmos community, kind of build a combination where you could have the EVM and slivesy on the application layer, use tooling like metamask or slingshot, and while also getting kind of that battle testedness of the Cosmos SDK.
00:24:48.838 - 00:25:44.710, Speaker B: Scott, what can you tell us about the up and coming startups in the Kanto ecosystem? I know one that's top of mind. Nomadic and I were angels in Cadence protocol, which I think is launching here at the end of February. It's an intense based protocol, basically will allow us, for folks who aren't familiar with this, you will be able to execute a perps trade from essentially any of the supported L two s, including Kanto. And it's going to power something like a perps aggregator, this one protocol. So there's a lot of promise there that will help to unsilo some of the perps trading that's going on across lots of exchanges. But anyways, what other startups would you recommend learning about or getting interested in the Kanto landscape.
00:25:44.790 - 00:26:43.294, Speaker A: Yeah, I've definitely been a fan of watching the cadence team kind of build out and get ready for the launch. It seems like they've done a great job in a lot of different ways. Excited to see what's next with them. Have a great time working with a few RWA startups on Kanto Fortunify, which I think has the most TVL and RWAs on Kanto, I think they're actually getting ready for a broader launch of their core product across different chains. And then Hashnote has been a great team to work with so far as well. And then the third one, high yield, is another RWA issuer that's not focused on T bills and just had a great time working with them, too. So I think if you're looking for exposure, like, I don't know, they're pretty good.
00:26:43.412 - 00:26:56.674, Speaker E: Scott, we were chatting a little bit about this music plus before we went live here with the pod. It seems a little bit mysterious, but can you tell us anything about what you're cooking on the music side of things?
00:26:56.872 - 00:28:54.006, Speaker A: Yeah, so lately I've been focusing. I live in Nashville. This is a lot of music people here, and kind of like, I've always been interested watching kind of from afar music nfts. I don't think the music NFT format that got a lot of hype back in the NFT boom really was a great design. And sort of always been thinking about how to design something like that, how to get the incentives right, not make it quite as focused on number go up and flipping, kind of like make that emotional attachment that we have to music, kind of use the ability to own that, use ownership to kind of make that connection more powerful and more intense and more meaningful to people. And so I kind of had a little idea of how I might do it, and then just kind of in Nashville have found some collaborators to work with and kind of just building self funding, bootstrapping a startup, planning to bring those to Kanto when we launch. And, yeah, just kind of hoping to both create something cool and like a new way of kind of interacting with music and a new way of being a fan, while also kind of finding a relatable way to bring more users on chain in a way that the stakes are.
00:28:54.006 - 00:29:02.982, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, it's kind of like something that's a safe, enjoyable thing to collect.
00:29:03.126 - 00:29:11.662, Speaker E: Sorry. Yeah, just one more question on that. Any idea when we might see something, like when you might roll this out?
00:29:11.796 - 00:30:18.958, Speaker A: So the one thing that I've learned doing music is a lot slower than MVP tech startup iteration cycles. They're like large. Every song is its own mini coordination problem. And so on the first project we have nine songs recorded out of what hope will be twelve or what's planned to be twelve, and is seven different artists, two main producers, and a lot of legal documents. It's just like a very coordination heavy industry. And so, yeah, our first kind of exec started on Monday, another execs starting full time next Monday and just kind of scaling it up as fast as it can go. But yeah, it's kind of a different world and just different constraints.
00:30:18.958 - 00:31:00.830, Speaker A: So I wish I had a, I mean, I thought it was going to be mid January. It was not, and it probably won't be February, but behind the scenes is really fun. I'm just kind of getting involved in situations that two years ago I wouldn't have imagined, like yesterday, kind of like sending an email talking about a potential feature from one of the hottest rappers on YouTube right now, an emerging artist. And it's just like, this is fun. And if it does come together, hoping it does, I hope it's cool. I hope people like it.
00:31:00.900 - 00:31:50.042, Speaker B: Yeah. There's been a huge interest within the web three community to support the music industry through the benefits of web three, but I don't think we've had that unlocked quite yet. I acknowledge the fact there's been a lot of interesting work done and credit to those folks who are working at the bleeding edge of all of that. But Scott, this is a good place, I think, for us to start to wrap up. So I want to remind our listeners that they should first learn more about Kanto by going to Kanto IO. There is links there to all the different primitives we talked about today, like the Kanto lending market, the Kanto amm, and then there's also a bridge there, too. That's one thing we didn't cover here, is there is a bridge.
00:31:50.042 - 00:32:28.618, Speaker B: It's on that site. If you're wondering how folks were transferring value over to Kanto and back. But, oh, one last thing with Scott's Twitter profile, you want to follow him at Scott underscore, Lew? Underscore is we'll have that all in the show notes. Scott, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us about all things Kanto. I want to give you the final word, though. Like, what else that we haven't talked about is coming, or better yet, just highlight for us once more what is the next big milestone that we should look forward to.
00:32:28.704 - 00:32:58.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, thanks. Nomadic and Defi dad for having me on. It's been a great conversation. Yeah. The next thing, I mean, I'm not on one of the teams, but one of the tributed teams will be contributors will be coordinating to get the Callistra upgrade out, which I think will be exciting. And then I'm also looking forward to the cadence launch, which may be coming out a little bit after this show comes or we'll see, but it's coming up soon.
00:32:58.940 - 00:33:12.070, Speaker B: Thanks everyone for tuning in. If you're a talented founder or developer, please consider reaching out to our team at Fourthrevolution Capital. And for future episodes of the Edge podcast, please check out our link tree at Edge pod.
