00:00:00.760 - 00:00:44.993, Speaker A: Hello world, My name is Bogdan, and welcome to let's Get Rusty, a show all about Rust. Not the game, the programming language. On this channel, what we'll do is start with simple Rust tutorials, the very basics, and progressively get more advanced, mostly because I'm still learning Rust myself. Then we'll move on to actually building things with Rust. So, for example, using it for webassembly, building backend servers, using Tokyo or Rocket, and so forth. Now, you might be wondering, why am I filming this on a calculator? Well, my goal was to start filming weekly videos. This week, however, I got sick and unfortunately wasn't able to come up with high quality video.
00:00:44.993 - 00:01:18.595, Speaker A: Also, I don't have all my equipment, as you could see, but I still wanted to post something. So this is my obligatory first video. I might end up deleting it soon after I post it. I might end up keeping it and looking back a few years from now at my very humble beginnings. We'll see. But if you're interested in Rust, if you're interested in learning Rust, news surrounding Rust, or just in general building things with new web technologies such as web assembly, hit the subscribe button and I'll see you next week.
