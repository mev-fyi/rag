00:00:00.360 - 00:00:42.592, Speaker A: Recently, a new version of rust was released, version 162.0. Let's go through the changes together. Dependencies can now be added through the command line with the cargo add command. For example, we can add the logcrate to this project as a dependency by typing in cargo add log. We can also add the serde crate with the derive feature turned on by typing in cargo add. Serde features derive finally, we can add the nom crate at a specific version using the symbol. Another change in this release is that enums can now derive the default trait.
00:00:42.592 - 00:01:24.208, Speaker A: In this example, we have an enum called maybe which derives the default trait. We can mark the default variant using the default attribute. However, note that currently the default attribute only works on unit variance, meaning variance with no fields. Then in main, we can create a new instance of maybe using the default method. Another change in this release is that mutexes are thinner and faster on Linux. Previously, the mutex implementation on Linux required 40 bytes of memory for its internal state, whereas now it only requires five bytes. This is because the Rust standard library now ships with a raw few text based implementation, which is lightweight and does not require extra allocations.
00:01:24.208 - 00:01:58.660, Speaker A: This release also makes building binaries for bare metal targets easier. The x 86 64 Unown none target has been promoted to tier two, which means it's guaranteed to build. Finally, here are the APIs that have been stabilized in this release.
