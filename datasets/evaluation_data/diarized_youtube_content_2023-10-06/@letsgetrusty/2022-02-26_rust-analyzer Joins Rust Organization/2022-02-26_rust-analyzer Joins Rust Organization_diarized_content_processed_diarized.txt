00:00:00.440 - 00:00:48.258, Speaker A: Welcome back to another episode of Rust News. A new article was published on the Rust official blog indicating that Rust Analyzer is now officially part of the Rust organization. Rust Analyzer is a language server for the Rust programming language. A language server gives text editors and ides functionality such as go to definition, auto completion, and much more. Rust actually already has an official language server called RLS or Rust Language Server. However, Rust Rust Analyzer is more fully featured and performant. Talks about making Rust Analyzer the official language server for the Rust programming language have been going on for quite a while, and now that it's part of the Rust organization, that reality is getting closer.
00:00:48.258 - 00:01:21.904, Speaker A: The blog post outlines steps that will be taken next. Rust Analyzer will be advertised as the very likely feature of Rust IDE support. Feedback will be gathered, and if the feedback is positive, the official language server for Rust. Currently rls will be sunsetted. After Rust analyzer becomes the official recommended language server for Rust, the Rust team will double down on making rust analyzer better from a technical perspective. That's it for today's video.
