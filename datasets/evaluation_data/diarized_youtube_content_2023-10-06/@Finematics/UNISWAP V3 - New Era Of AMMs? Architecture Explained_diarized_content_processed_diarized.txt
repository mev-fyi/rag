Although Uniswap as one of the core DFI projects doesn't need much of an introduction, let's quickly go through a few major points before we jump into V Three. Uniswap, in essence, is a protocol for decentralized and permissionless exchange of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The initial version of Uniswap was launched in November 2018 and slowly started building users interest in May 2020. At the beginning of DFI summer, Uniswap launched a second version of the protocol called Uniswap V Two.
00:01:05.122 - 00:02:04.340, Speaker A: The main feature was the addition of ERC 20 to ERC 20 liquidity pools on top of ERC 20 to ETH pools present in V One. In the second half of 2020, Uniswap V Two went through a period of parabolic growth and quickly became the most popular application on Ethereum. It also became pretty much a standard for automated market makers, making it one of the most forked projects in the whole DFI space. Less than a year since its launch, v Two has facilitated over $135,000,000,000 in trading volume, an astonishing number that is comparable with Top centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. You can learn more about the full story behind Uniswap V One and V Two in this video here. Also, the concept of liquidity pools and automated market makers are worth understanding. If you need a quick recap, here is a video.
00:02:04.340 - 00:03:21.182, Speaker A: Just before releasing V Two, the team behind Uniswap had already started working on a new version of the protocol, details of which were announced just now. At the end of March 2021, the team decided to launch Uniswap V Three on both the Ethereum Mainet an Optimism and Ethereum layer Two scaling solution targeting early May for the release. This was clearly one of the most anticipated announcements in DeFi's history, and it looks like V Three can completely revolutionize the AMM space. So what are the main changes? Uniswap V Three focuses on maximizing capital efficiency when compared to V Two. This not only allows LPs to earn a higher return on their capital, but also dramatically improves trade execution that can now be compared or even surpass the quality of both centralized exchanges and stablecoin focused AMMS. On top of this, because of better capital efficiency, LPs can create overall portfolios that significantly increase exposure to preferred assets and reduce their downside risk. They can also add single assets as liquidity to a price range that is above or below the current market price.
00:03:21.182 - 00:03:59.894, Speaker A: Which basically creates a fee earning limit order that executes along a smooth curve. This is all possible by introducing a new concept of concentrated liquidity. More on this in a second. Besides, this V Three introduces multiple fee tiers and improves uniswap Oracles. Now let's go through some of the uniswap V Three features one by one to understand them a bit better. Concentrated liquidity is the main concept behind V Three. When LPs provide liquidity to a V Two pool, liquidity is distributed evenly along the price curve.
00:03:59.894 - 00:04:48.894, Speaker A: Although this allows for handling all price ranges between zero and infinity, it makes the capital quite inefficient. This is because most assets usually trade within certain price ranges. This is especially visible in pools with stable assets that trade within a very narrow range. As an example, Uniswap Dai USDC pool only uses around half a percent of capital for trading between ninety nine cents and one dollar and one cent, a price range where the vast majority of trading volume goes through. This is also the volume that makes the majority of trading fees for the LPs. This means that in this particular example, 99.5% of the remaining capital is pretty much never used in vitri.
00:04:48.894 - 00:05:37.160, Speaker A: LPs can choose a custom price range when providing liquidity. This allows for concentrating capital within ranges where most of the trading activity occurs. To achieve this, VTree creates individualized price curves for each of the liquidity providers. Before VTree, the only way to allow LPs to have individual curves was to create a separate pool per curve. These pools, if not aggregated together, resulted in high gas costs if a trade had to be routed across multiple pools. What is important is that users trade against combined liquidity that is available at a certain price point. This combined liquidity comes from all the price curves that overlap at this specific price point.
00:05:37.160 - 00:06:20.422, Speaker A: LPs earn trading fees that are directly proportional to their liquidity contribution in a given range. Concentrating liquidity offers much better capital efficiency for liquidity providers. To understand it better, let's go through a quick example. Alice and Bob both decide to provide liquidity in the ETH die pool on Uniswap V Three. They each have $10,000 and the current price of ETH is $1,750. Alice splits her entire capital between ETH and Dai and deploys it across the entire price range. Similar to V Two, she deposits 5000 die and 2.85
00:06:20.422 - 00:07:13.746, Speaker A: ETH. Bob, instead of using his entire capital, decides to concentrate his liquidity and provides capital within the price range from 1500 to 2500. He deposits 600 die and zero point 37 ETH, a total of $1,200, and keeps the remaining $8,800 for other purposes. What is interesting is that as long as the ETH die price stays within the 1502 500 range, they both earn the same amount of trading fees. This means that Bob is able to provide only 12% of Alice's capital and still makes the same returns, making his capital 8.34 times more efficient than Alice's capital. On top of that, Bob is putting less of his overall capital at risk.
00:07:13.746 - 00:08:10.294, Speaker A: In case of a quite unlikely scenario of ETH going to $0, bob's and Alice's entire liquidity would move into ETH. Although they would both lose their entire capital, Bob puts a much smaller amount at risk. LPs in more stable pools will most likely provide liquidity in particularly narrow ranges. If the $25 million currently held in the uniswap V Two die USDC pool were instead concentrated between zero 99 and 1.1 price range in V Three, it would provide the same depth as $5 billion in Uniswap V Two as long as prices stayed within that range. When V Three launches, the maximum capital efficiency will be at 4000 x when compared to V Two. This will be achievable when providing liquidity within a single zero 1% price range.
00:08:10.294 - 00:09:38.146, Speaker A: On top of that, the V Three pool factory will be able to support ranges as granular as zero zero 2%, which translates to a maximum of 20,000 x capital efficiency relative to V Two. V Three also introduces the concept of active liquidity. If the price of assets trading in a specific liquidity pool moves outside of the LP's price range, the LP's liquidity is effectively removed from the pool and stops earning fees. When this happens, the LP's liquidity shifts completely towards one of the assets, and they end up holding only one of them. At this point, the LP can either wait until the market price moves back into their specified price range, or they may decide to update the range to account for current prices. Although it's entirely possible that there will be no liquidity at a specific price range, in practice, this would create an enormous opportunity for liquidity providers to indeed provide liquidity to that price range and start collecting all trading fees. From the game theory point of view, we should be able to see a reasonable distribution of capital, with some LPs focusing on narrow price ranges, others focusing on less likely but more profitable ranges, and yet another ones choosing to update their price range if the price moves out of their previous range.
00:09:38.146 - 00:10:36.850, Speaker A: Range limit Orders is the next feature enabled by concentrated liquidity. This allows LPs to provide a single token as liquidity in a custom price range above or below the current market price. When the market price enters into the specified range, one asset is sold for another along a smooth curve, all while still earning swap fees in the process. This feature, when used together with a narrow range, allows for achieving a similar goal to a standard limit order that can be set at a specific price. For example, let's assume that Dai USDC trades below 1.1. An LP can decide to deposit their die to a narrow range between one and one two. Once Dai trades above 1002 di USDC, the whole LP's liquidity is converted into USDC.
00:10:36.850 - 00:11:59.854, Speaker A: At this point, the LP has to withdraw their liquidity to avoid automatically converting back into die. Once die USDC goes back to trading below 1.2, LPs can also decide to provide liquidity in multiple price ranges that may or may not overlap. For example, an LP can provide liquidity to the following price ranges in the ETH Die pool $2,000 between 1502 $500 1000 between 2000 and $3,000 500 between three $505,000 being able to enter multiple LP positions within different price ranges allows for approximating pretty much any price curve or even an order book. This also enables creating more sophisticated market making strategies, as each LP can basically create their own price curve, their liquidity positions are no longer fungible and cannot be represented by, wellknown, ERC 20 LP tokens. Instead providing liquidity is tracked by nonfungible ERC, seven two one tokens. Despite this, it looks like LP positions that fall within the same price range will be able to be represented by ERC 20 tokens either via peripheral contracts or through other partner protocols.
00:11:59.854 - 00:13:02.658, Speaker A: On top of this, trading fees are no longer automatically reinvested back into the liquidity pool on LP's behalf. Instead, peripheral contracts can be created to offer such functionality. The next new feature is the flexibility when it comes to trading fees. Instead of offering the standard zero 3% trading fee known from Uniswap V Two, V Three initially offers three separate fee tiers zero 5%, Zero 3% and 1%. This allows LPs to choose the pools according to the risk they are willing to take. The team behind Uniswap expects the Zero Zero 5% fee to be predominantly used for pools with similar assets, such as different stablecoins zero 3% for other standard pairs like ETH Die and 1% for more exotic pairs. Similarly to V Two, V Three can also enable a protocol fee switch where part of the trading fee would be redirected from LPs.
00:13:02.658 - 00:13:52.050, Speaker A: Instead of having a fixed percentage like in V Two, V Three offers between ten and 25% of LP fees on a per pool basis. This will be switched off at launch, although it can be switched on at any time as per Uniswap governance. Last but not least is a significant improvement to the TWAP Oracles introduced by Uniswap V Two. V Three makes it possible to calculate any recent TWAP within the past nine days in a single onchain call. On top of this, the cost of keeping Oracles up to date has been reduced by around 50% when compared to V Two. These are pretty much all the main features behind Uniswap V Three. What is interesting is that all of these features haven't cost an increase in the gas cost, rather the opposite.
00:13:52.050 - 00:14:31.662, Speaker A: The most common feature, a simple swap, will be around 30% cheaper than its V Two equivalent. It looks like Uniswap V Three can be a game changer when it comes to AMMS. It basically combines the benefits of a standard AMM with the benefits of a stable asset AMM. All of this, while making capital way more efficient. This makes V Three a super flexible protocol, able to accommodate a whole range of different assets. It will be interesting to see how V Three could affect other AMMS, especially the ones that V Two couldn't earlier compete with. For example, stablecoin AMMS like curve.
00:14:31.662 - 00:15:25.918, Speaker A: It is also crucial that V Three launches in parallel on optimism. Optimism is an optimistic, rollup based L2 scaling solution that enables fast and cheap transactions without sacrificing layer one's security. At the moment, optimism is partially rolled out and has started integrating with a few selected partners like Synthetics. Uniswap on L2 should be able to attract even more users who might have been priced out by high gas fees on layer one exchanges. Enabling withdrawals to optimism would be another big step towards the quick adoption of V Three on L2. On top of the V Three launch, an imminent full launch of optimism will clearly be another highly anticipated event to wait for. Besides this, the migration from V Two to V Three will be done on a fully voluntary basis.
00:15:25.918 - 00:16:39.718, Speaker A: In case of V One to V Two migration, it took just over two weeks for V Two to surpass V One's liquidity. It would be also interesting to see if Uniswap's governance decides to further encourage LPs by voting in some kind of incentives only present in V Three maybe another liquidity mining program with the super high capital efficiency of V Three. Even if the existing liquidity is split between V Two, V Three and V Three on optimism, it should still be way more than enough to facilitate trading with low slippage across all of these three protocols. One challenge of V Three is that providing liquidity may become a bit harder, especially for less sophisticated users. Choosing a wrong price range may magnify the chances of being affected by impermanent loss, and it will be interesting to see a development of third party services that could help with choosing optimal strategies for allocating liquidity.
