00:00:00.250 - 00:00:36.658, Speaker A: Base is a recently announced Ethereum L Two built by the Coinbase team. Similarly to other L Two S Base is a separate chain that extends Ethereum and inherits its security guarantees. This allows for scaling Ethereum by creating a low cost environment able to accommodate new users. Base is built on optimism's. Open source op stack. Op stack is the standardized, shared and open source development stack that powers optimism and is maintained by the optimism collective. Building on the Op stack means that Base is creating a specific type of L Two called an optimistic rollup.
00:00:36.658 - 00:00:57.230, Speaker A: Optimistic rollups execute transactions outside Ethereum but post transaction data to the Ethereum mainnet. Optimistic rollups are considered optimistic because they assume transactions posted to Ethereum are valid. In cases where transactions are not calculated correctly optimistic rollups rely on the fraudproofing scheme.
