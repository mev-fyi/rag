00:01:01.420 - 00:01:06.680, Speaker A: Dude, the exit, the production quality is insane. The production value. What the heck?
00:01:07.180 - 00:01:08.084, Speaker B: I know, right?
00:01:08.172 - 00:01:11.180, Speaker A: Even spend time on this.
00:01:11.220 - 00:01:31.254, Speaker B: Take a lot of pride in that. Yeah, great stuff. Always, always gets us hyped before the episode. Like to think it does the same for the guests as well. Welcome back, everyone. Another episode of ex Liquidity. This is episode 85, and today we have tyke with us.
00:01:31.254 - 00:01:33.210, Speaker B: Tyche, thanks for joining us, man.
00:01:34.670 - 00:01:44.410, Speaker A: No worries. Thanks for having me. I watched us a couple of times. So happy to. And, you know, I am exit liquidity most of the time, so, you know, this is very on brand.
00:01:45.950 - 00:02:04.592, Speaker B: Yeah, great stuff, tyke. You're a lot of things. I feel like. Researcher, podcast host, ex liquidity, mid curvereze. We have a lot in common, I think. Um, but I don't think, uh, I don't think a lot of people know too much about your background, at least. I certainly don't.
00:02:04.592 - 00:02:12.500, Speaker B: Uh, would love to hear a little bit about what brought you into crypto and, uh, you know, kind of just your story of how you got here.
00:02:13.320 - 00:02:53.366, Speaker A: Sure. Uh, so I guess I graduated 2019, um, from Berkeley, did business, and I was working at a company called Boba Guys, like, headquarters. I did operations there just because my family owns japanese restaurants, and I was always interested in, like, the food biz. Then 2020 happened. Covid got laid off, everyone got laid off. And I decided to, I guess, look back at my life and be like, you know, like, what do I really want to do? And I started playing poker full time online. That's primarily how I made most of my money in college, and I've always wanted to just give it a shot.
00:02:53.366 - 00:03:25.056, Speaker A: So I was doing that from March to early 2021. But, of course, later in 2020, the markets crypto started pumping. So I slowly just spent more and more time on crypto. And at the time, I didn't really have a finance background. I have a business degree, but not a finance background. So I figured if I wanted to work in crypto, I should just make YouTube videos just to have, like, a digital resume in case I did apply. But it's just, like, my channels just start popping off in, like, early 2021.
00:03:25.056 - 00:03:43.060, Speaker A: And at that point, I was like, okay. Like, there's, like, nothing else that I would rather do. So stopped poker. I also founded, like, a coffee company in college. I also have to. I also left that just to do crypto full time content full time. And that's been me for, like, the past three, four years.
00:03:45.800 - 00:04:01.460, Speaker B: Nice, man. Yeah. Uh, what was, uh. So you got in around, like, it sounds like you got in or, like, went full time around 2021. What were you interested in back then? Like, were there any communities, any specific, like, sectors or technology that really caught your interest to start out?
00:04:02.800 - 00:04:40.440, Speaker A: I mean, I was always into defi. Uh, I mean, I was just, like, punting around on Mainnet. One of the first coins I bought on chain was badger. I was like, oh, my God, this is the blockfi but decentralized future of finance. And then all the farmers dumped on me, and that was really sad. And had to pay, like, dollar 30 in gas costs just, like, get out of just to stop being exit liquidity. And then, you know, I discovered polygon, and I guess I was always interested in, like, using the chain to, I guess, make money.
00:04:40.440 - 00:05:09.272, Speaker A: And I feel like at the time, no one really. I don't know. There was defi somewhere. There was, like, binance, smart chain, but there really wasn't, like, you know, crazy pumps right in, like, q one ish, aside from, like, some defi points. But I think Polygon just really opened up my eyes to, like, what this thing could be also. I mean, it was, like, crazy bull market. So, I mean, if you bridge the polygon, like, you know, it was almost impossible to lose money, I think.
00:05:09.272 - 00:05:22.980, Speaker A: So. I think, yeah, like, polygon just really, like, polygon. Defi season was, like, really the craziest, probably moment in my career, I think, in terms of, like, sheer euphoria, and it's, like, money printer Gobert type of stuff.
00:05:24.280 - 00:05:37.786, Speaker B: That's interesting. I actually don't know anyone who was ever really that into polygon. Polygon pos at least at any point. Cedo is a. Is a known polygon disrespector, actually. I think.
00:05:37.858 - 00:06:10.790, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like everyone's a Polygon disrespect at this point, but I think. I mean, I don't know. I feel like it was hard to miss Polygon back then. In Q one and Q two, it's like token 100 x, and then they were like, you could just loop eat or staples on Aave and get paid, like, 30, 50% for free. And then all the Ponzis on polygon were pumping. So it was basically, like, I would kind of compare it to, like, the pump fun experience that we're having now, except it was on Polygon, but instead of, like, meme coins, it was, like, just defi Ponzi's.
00:06:13.410 - 00:06:36.158, Speaker B: Yeah. Interesting. I'd never heard too much about that. I mean, it sounds like. It sounds like it might have been kind of similar to what was going on on BSc chain at the time or maybe like some of the more involved l one sdHe. Like, I guess phantom kind of had a little bit of a season like that with some of the tomb and tomb forks and all that, like, yield farming craze throughout that process. Obviously, as.
00:06:36.158 - 00:06:52.840, Speaker B: As you've mentioned and as we all have been ourselves, I'm sure there were plenty of ex liquidity moments for you. Um, what was your most memorable, though? What was like, the one time you look back and you think of that as like a. Like, let's call it a career defining, momentous being ex liquidity.
00:06:54.220 - 00:07:25.080, Speaker A: I feel like if we look back on that bull market, because for me, like, I'm not. Yeah, I'm like. I'm like, you know, mid curve, right? I'm not. I don't think I'm like that smart, but I think what I'm good at is, I guess, learning from past mistakes and adapting. And I guess one career defining trade was like, keeperdao. Like rook. Because I was like, doing all this, like, heavy defi research, like on chain, and I was learning about Mev and I was like, oh, my God, like me.
00:07:25.080 - 00:07:52.890, Speaker A: Flashbots. Keeperdao. Meb project, it's going to pump. But in hindsight, in the past four years, I don't think anyone has ever made money from an MEV project. I feel like Meb as a concept is the definition of exit liquidity. It's just like anyone that tries to play the MeV narrative just gets wrecked, gets dumped on. So I guess from that point on, I try not to participate in things that I don't fully understand.
00:07:52.890 - 00:08:14.930, Speaker A: It's okay if I miss random shit, right? So, like, that pumps. It's like, I honestly don't care. I'm okay just staying in my own lane and just doing my thing and just hopefully slowly accumulating more and more wealth, hopefully over time, and just, I guess, try to focus on, like, what I'm good at, what my edges, and, you know, and that way I can't really be exit liquidity.
00:08:17.190 - 00:08:47.893, Speaker B: Yeah, you'd think it finds a way. It finds a way. In my experience, eventually, everybody, everybody at least, you know, we all get better, we all get smarter over time, learn from our mistakes. But I always end up having a humbling moment at one point or another. I think we're never quite out of the woods would be great, though. I think Mev is an interesting example. I haven't really thought about that one too much, but I've definitely had some projects where, you know, they have a big focus on Mev.
00:08:47.893 - 00:09:04.489, Speaker B: And that you, you think you. It makes you feel like you're smarter than you actually are by investing in that, because you can say, like, oh, yeah, Mev thing. And, like, nobody really knows what that means. So it's like you. You seem smarter. You seem like it's a better investment, but it never really is.
00:09:05.109 - 00:09:30.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like with all these fundamental coins, right? It's just like, it's a way for the buyer to feel smarter. It's like, oh, like, my friend made a ten x on this meme coin. That guy's stupid. I buy me bitcoin. You know, this makes money or like, whatever, right? Some bullshit. And I don't think there's any, like, Mev coin that's ever pumped. You know, I mean, that's like sustained a pump.
00:09:30.154 - 00:09:43.080, Speaker A: They all just go down 99%. It's kind of ridiculous. So I guess I'm trying to understand where you are on the information totem pole and the IQ totem pole, I think is very important in crypto.
00:09:44.060 - 00:10:49.280, Speaker C: Yeah, you kind of mentioned the start of YouTube and content for you. One thing that I always found nice about your channel and just kind of your journey and content is you just really never fell into the grift. Especially when I feel like this is probably your second full cycle. But even in your early days of the channel and creating farming videos, I'm sure there are many opportunities to fall into just heavy grifting, as many, like, shows, channels or things do, and you never did. And I'm curious kind of where that kind of came from. Was there kind of a lesson you experienced or were there other content, like producers that you were watching that kind of started grifting and you're like, I'll never do this. What's the story there?
00:10:50.060 - 00:11:32.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, most people in crypto are grifters, right? So it's like, because like I said, I have a business background. I, like, specialized in marketing in college with a heavy focus on, like, brand. So I think when it comes to, for me, I try to value a longer term mindset when it comes to who, like, what my role is in the industry. And I don't. And I try to think more long term, like, you know, in 510 years, like, who do I want to be? And I want to, you know, be someone that people can trust. And trust is one of those things that you can't really buy. You know, there's a saying, like, it takes, like, many years to build up trust, but, like, one day to just lose it all.
00:11:32.310 - 00:11:37.610, Speaker A: So I've always thought that if you have a strong brand, you can just build any product.
00:11:37.770 - 00:11:38.090, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:38.130 - 00:12:06.240, Speaker A: Because once you have. Yeah, it's all about distribution, I think. Yeah. And also, I think one content creator I looked up to was Ben Cohenous. I know he's mostly a macro guy now with bitcoin dominance and stuff, but he also, similar to me, neds no page sales, and I really liked how he did it. So I figured that if I were to make it in content, I want to follow his model. So that's kind of what I've done.
00:12:06.240 - 00:12:36.622, Speaker A: I think it's more so instead of going for views or I. The crazy headlines or thumbnails, it's more so just building a relationship with my audience over time. And, you know, if. I guess, like, at some point, you know, like, you just be a good actor and things will come to you, like, good opportunities, you know, like, if you're a good person, then people want to work with you. People want to, you know, talk to you. And I don't. Yeah, I don't.
00:12:36.622 - 00:12:49.750, Speaker A: I don't really have a plan on, like, where I want to be in, like, 510 years, but I just have a north star to not grift. And, you know, if you don't grift, then that already separates you from the pack. Right. So it's not that hard. So.
00:12:49.830 - 00:13:16.870, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ben Cohen, that's a. That's an interesting one. I see the. I see the similarities. Now, although he's, like, been bearish East BTC for, like, a long time, so there are some differences. But, yeah, in terms of kind of the guests you've had on various shows, do you kind of have a favorite out of the interviews or kind of moments from creating content?
00:13:18.050 - 00:13:35.940, Speaker A: Favorite? I don't know. It's hard. Let me go to my channel. I don't know. I really enjoyed having Suzu on just because I followed him so much last cycle. And, of course, people. I mean, some people, like, hate him and stuff.
00:13:35.940 - 00:14:30.840, Speaker A: Understandable. But to have to be able to talk to sue and I've had him on steady labs a couple times, too, and get his market views, I feel, makes it feel surreal because last cycle, he was kind of this mythical figure that I would never have the chance to talk to. But now if I wanted to get sue on, it wouldn't be too difficult. So, in a sense, it kind of validates all the things I've been doing. It's like, just heads down, just build a good brand, and people will want to work with you or, like, talk to you. And I also thought that the conversation is, like, the conversation I had with Su was pretty good as well. The way he talks, he kind of sounds like a philosopher, and maybe that makes him sound, like, super smart all the time, but, yeah, I think having sue on Washington, a really big deal for me.
00:14:31.300 - 00:14:38.080, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you have, like, a dream guess. Is there anyone that you're still trying to get an interview with?
00:14:39.580 - 00:14:55.478, Speaker A: I guess the audio is, like, the obvious answer is, like, GCR or, like, Kobe, but I don't think GCR will want to dox any part of his voice or face. And Kobe's not doing podcasts anymore, but, yeah.
00:14:55.494 - 00:15:11.210, Speaker B: Like, not long ago, Kobe was saying that he was, like, hinting towards, like, an actual, like, GCR podcast. I don't know how, like, legit it was. I feel like Kobe, like, takes things very not seriously these days, so it's hard to tell when he's being legit or not.
00:15:11.630 - 00:15:24.660, Speaker A: Yeah, he's just like. I mean, he's just, like, focusing on echo right now. DJ and Spartan would be good, too. Like, yeah, just like those. Those mythical characters on CT. That'd be nice.
00:15:25.960 - 00:15:40.740, Speaker C: Yeah. How is. You're on echo now, right? Or, like, yes. How has that been? I honestly don't know too much about echo, but I'd be curious how that experience has been. And.
00:15:42.640 - 00:16:08.906, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So there's a rule. I can't, like, talk about it too much. Like, I can't talk about or I can't solicit. So, uh, you know, but I can talk about, I guess, the platform in general and why I'm interested. But it's like, I've never done private deals, like, before this year. Not because, you know, I didn't see any good deals.
00:16:08.906 - 00:16:54.498, Speaker A: In fact, I think I get, like, good deal flow. It's just that I felt like if. If I make money from private deals, it's hard for me to empathize with my audience, and it's hard for my audience to empathize with me. So I've typically went the path of just building the relationship and whatnot conceptually. But if I can share deal flow with my audience, I feel like that would be a good value add, and also that would allow me to actually help founders work on things, um, build things of value. Uh, so, no, I feel like it goes one of those things where, you know, if it works, I think it's incredibly ambitious, and it could be the most egalitarian thing we've ever seen. Uh, you know, just trying to level the playing field.
00:16:54.498 - 00:17:16.210, Speaker A: Um, not, you know, like, away from, like, b and c tier VC's, right. I feel like echo can, like, just put them all out of business and put more power in the hands of, like, you know, I guess quality kills, I suppose. And if you're, like, a VC, you really have to stand out, you know, if you don't want to, if you still want to stay alive. So pretty bullish. Echo. I really like echo.
00:17:18.670 - 00:17:52.110, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really cool. Is. So you've kind of been in the kind of crypto space last cycle, this cycle. I think I remember kind of the tail end of last cycle. You were obviously kind of probably making less content, but you had. You probably learned some lessons as the rest of us. Do you feel like you applied any of the lessons from last cycle into this cycle so far?
00:17:55.170 - 00:18:48.500, Speaker A: I think over time, I learned a lot. Um, I think one mistake I made last cycle also because I was, like, very new and naive, is that, like. Like, in 2021, I feel like I was just on a roll and, like, all the plays were hitting. It's like, because I was, like, the guy that, you know, was doing the whole alto one rotations and whatnot, you know, just rotating from chain to chain, following the incentives, you know, did, like, the whole defi kingdoms, like, found it early and stuff. And I think because of that, my comments actually, in my audience, they're all like, okay, taiki, what's next play? What's the next play? What's the next play? So my psyche was like, okay, I need to be looking out for the next play, the next play. The next play. And, of course, if that's my mindset and we enter a bearish regime, then I'm the one that's looking for bold narratives when the market's turning down.
00:18:48.500 - 00:19:15.184, Speaker A: So I think, you know, this time around, it's like, I don't really care what people think. I'm just gonna do what I think makes sense. And, you know, even, like, my podcasts, it's like, I have guests on, right? Like, I had a hedgehog on recently, on Monday, and he was, like, just, like, omega bearish. People don't like hearing bearish stuff, but it's like, hey, like, you know, this is what he thinks. You know, like, it's bearish content. You know, just deal with it. So that's that.
00:19:15.184 - 00:19:51.250, Speaker A: That's one. And also, now I feel like if you're, like, a YouTube channel and you talk about alts, it never ends well because alts always go down, like, 80, 90%. So even if you're right for, like, the first couple months, it always makes you look bad. So now I don't really talk about individual coins. I just focus more on podcasts. I made a video on Aave recently, but I think Aave is like, it's fine, right? It's like, it's already down a lot. And, you know, even if it goes down, it's like, you know, I'm not, like, showing some, like, pumpamentals, right? It's more like, hey, like, this is like a defi blue chip.
00:19:51.250 - 00:20:24.340, Speaker A: Hopefully, it can just bottom on its e pair. So trying to be more careful with, like, what I do say and just focusing more on, I guess, podcasting, because it's also evergreen. I want to make content that's relevant. Like, three months from now, six months from now, a year from now. If you're just focusing on short term altcoin narratives, it's probably going to be irrelevant in, like, two weeks. And then people can screenshot that video and be like, yeah, like, this guy's a grifter or something. So just focusing on more evergreen content, I think.
00:20:26.080 - 00:21:04.202, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Makes sense, I guess. Like, alts pretty much all alts trend to zero against bitcoin. And if you're making stuff that's, like, based on a narrative or based on some specific moment in time, there's that one meme that I really like. It's like you're like a c tier reply guy, and, like, somebody talks about an alt, and you comment below, it's like, all right, give me the entry stop loss leverage. Like, like, if you don't provide every single, like, data point, someone's gonna find a way to, like, get mad. So, like, you know, just kind of disregarding that and focusing instead on stuff that's, like, useful time and time again.
00:21:04.202 - 00:21:20.640, Speaker B: Definitely makes. Makes a lot of sense. What do you, outside of, like, outside of content creation, what are you spending your time these days doing on chain? Are you, like, trading perps? Farming, air drop farming? What's got your attention these days?
00:21:21.540 - 00:21:58.076, Speaker A: Yeah, mostly airdrop farming. I mean, airdrop farming is kind of feels done so recently, but, you know, it's. I'm bullish eth. I hold Ethan. It's like, if I can gain some return on Eth for, like, very little risk, I'll do it. So I've been farming symbiotic etherfi scroll mostly is like, what I'm farming. Honestly, there's really not much to do on chain, right? I tweet about this before, but the only use case for mainnet is to buy some tokenless lrt or to bridge to some l two for, like, an airdrop.
00:21:58.076 - 00:22:12.932, Speaker A: Like, that's. That's. That's all you can do. There's, like, no meme going activity. There's, like, I guess you can. There's, like, some defi activity, right? Like, you, like, buy something on uniswap or you pay a loan on. Or you, like, borrow against Eth on Aave or something, but there's really not much to do, uh, on chain.
00:22:12.932 - 00:22:23.770, Speaker A: You know, it's. It's kind of sad. I think I woke up this morning and gas was, like, 0.9 or something. I was like, what? I was like, what? It's below one. I didn't know that was possible. I was like.
00:22:23.770 - 00:22:39.478, Speaker A: I was like, holy shit, it's so dead. So, yeah, there's really not much to do other than just hope that the boomers buy our bags. Honestly, I don't know. What do you guys do? Like.
00:22:39.654 - 00:22:51.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, no. Like, I totally agree with these, but that's. That's. That's Sito's domain. I'm not too crazy about that. I feel like I. I mean, you make good points.
00:22:51.404 - 00:23:25.482, Speaker B: I think you kind of leave out yield farming in general, though, which is, like, kind of. It's weird because I'm not. I'm not doing a ton of it. And it's, like, not really something that I think is super plus ev in a bull relative to. Relative to, like, airdrop farming or playing alts or, you know, other stuff in general, yield farming is, like, a lot more consistent and, like, lower upside. But I still think there's, like, really good yield opportunities on ETh. I mean, better than you'll find pretty much anywhere else.
00:23:25.482 - 00:24:00.182, Speaker B: But also, that usually doesn't come without some sort of points. Farming, too. Like, Pendle is the one big one that comes to mind. Farming principal tokens or, like, principal token LP's on Pendle. I feel like you can get pretty good return on your ETh, like, at this point with how sentiment is around airdrop farming. Like, some of these stuff paying out, some of these things paying out 20, 30% roughly, I guess, in native EtH terms is like, you know, a pretty good bet. That's like, you probably would have done.
00:24:00.182 - 00:24:20.840, Speaker B: Done about the same on that as you will with Eigen, I think, in the longer run, at least. And not if you're not side billing, obviously, past that. It's like, I'm doing less airdrop farming, but that is still, like, one of the only things I'm doing. Holding Eth a lot of eth, unfortunately.
00:24:21.220 - 00:24:21.764, Speaker A: Me too.
00:24:21.812 - 00:24:22.068, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:22.124 - 00:24:22.332, Speaker A: All right.
00:24:22.356 - 00:24:32.480, Speaker B: We had. We had flywheel on last week, and it was. It was just like an ETh, like, alcoholics Anonymous episode, pretty much like, we were just, like, coping for like an hour straight.
00:24:33.140 - 00:24:49.198, Speaker A: No, I'm coping. Yeah, it's, you know, like, kind of. I kind of expected a summer shop, so I was like, okay, like, let me just be overweight. Eat. It probably has less downside than alts, and, you know, maybe the ETF is bullish and then eat has more downside than alts.
00:24:49.334 - 00:24:50.046, Speaker B: Fuck.
00:24:50.198 - 00:25:16.632, Speaker A: Like what? Like, what am I doing here? But going back on the original point, I think airdrop farming is a new yield farming. It's like teams are no longer going to just give away tokens for free. Right. Just for, like, lp'ing or whatnot. There's like, you know, it makes more sense, but, yeah, it makes way more sense for them to just issue points and then tg sometime afterwards. You know, the meta is getting more complicated. There are lots of good yields.
00:25:16.632 - 00:25:19.560, Speaker A: Like, I think Paypal USD on Solana pays like 20%.
00:25:19.680 - 00:25:21.552, Speaker B: 20%, yeah, yeah.
00:25:21.576 - 00:25:36.858, Speaker A: And then on arbitrum, you can. There's still, like, those long term incentive program yields. So various defi projects, you can probably get like, 20% on the Ethan stables pretty easily. But also, it's paid in arbitrary. No one wants that shit. So. Yeah, it's just.
00:25:36.858 - 00:25:41.710, Speaker A: It's just getting sent to the gulag. Just. Yeah, typical farm token.
00:25:42.010 - 00:26:11.920, Speaker B: Not. Not ideal, for sure. I have also, I. I don't know if, like, this has happened to either of you guys either, but I feel like not so much on the timeline, but in some of the groups I'm in, I'm seeing more mentions of, like, structured products, specifically, I guess, like, HLP and GLP. So, like, hyper liquid and Jupiter vaults. Those are, like, the main ones that everyone talks about. But there's also, like, Sega and three, Jane, I think, are the two.
00:26:11.920 - 00:26:14.152, Speaker B: They're both small protocols, but, yeah, just.
00:26:14.176 - 00:26:15.380, Speaker A: Like, the options thing.
00:26:15.760 - 00:26:41.680, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's, you know, obviously it comes with risks, but there's. There's. On Sega specifically, you can. You. You can really, like, there's a lot of different strategies there for whatever's fit to your risk profile. Uh, I haven't, you know, looked into it too. Too much yet, but I'd like to think that that's one thing that's still not driven by token incentives or, like, points.
00:26:41.680 - 00:26:42.580, Speaker B: Incentives.
00:26:43.400 - 00:27:24.850, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm super bullish. HLP, JLP, GLP. Like, during the bear market, like, I think GLP kind of saved my life because on GMX, like, because GLP has, like, outperformed entire markets. Like, even up to this date, JLP is like straight up crack. I wish I deployed more capital into that. But the cool thing about things like these LP assets is that during the bear, I was like, I'd eat this collateral, I borrowed Avax, and I sold the Avax to buy GLPDe. And then as Avax was nuking, GLP would maintain its value.
00:27:24.850 - 00:28:12.210, Speaker A: So whenever Avax would dump 30%, I would just convert my GLP to Avax, pay back my loan. And it's a pseudo hedge, I guess. So that could be something interesting for Solana, maybe in the future where if we go much higher, you can borrow Sol on Camino margin by jlpenty. JLP just really good asset. If Solana goes down, then you just make a bunch of money and you're also farming like a Jupiter airdrop. That could be pretty good. And DejLP, of course, money printer, right? There's always risk, but yeah, like these perps, LP vaults, typically, historically, if you can trust a team like Dejas print, but of course, you have to worry about the tail risks, which is hard to quantify.
00:28:17.870 - 00:28:41.160, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. Yeah, I mean, I haven't spent too much time in them, I guess. I guess I've haven't paid too much attention to the yields overall. But I've always been, like, worried of, like, getting wiped out just by profitable traders, especially, like, in bullish times like this. Or at least what has been for most of the year. Hasn't really gone that direction yet, as far as I know, with any of them.
00:28:41.240 - 00:28:47.728, Speaker A: But, like, profitable traders are not going to trade on chain purpose, right. So it's only like random trading.
00:28:47.784 - 00:28:51.740, Speaker B: So, I mean, it happened with good flip with GLP a few times, didn't it?
00:28:52.200 - 00:29:14.842, Speaker A: Yeah, King made. Andrew King made a bunch, and then I think he, like, round tripped or something. Also, I think he. He was like, because he was like an arbitram investor, I think he like, he like, around the Arbitrum TG. He really. He was like, just trading on GMX so, like, the metrics would look like, sexier. Maybe that was part of it.
00:29:14.842 - 00:29:22.630, Speaker A: He's a great trader, though. I don't know. Like, what are you guys like, what are you guys excited about? You guys look kind of dead.
00:29:26.650 - 00:30:20.318, Speaker C: I'm not a big, like, yield farm kind of guy. I feel like most of the time, I need to feel something a little bit more on the, on the gambling side of things and like newer ecosystem type side of things. That doesn't mean I'm not just a giant eth bag holder, but it is kind of like boring sometimes to airdrop farm and just yield farm all day. So I guess I get my fixed every now and then from like perps and, and, uh, and meme coining. Um, I was going to ask kind of what other ecosystems that, like, you've been in outside of ETh. I know, uh, you've been getting like a lot of, well, a lot of people have been getting a lot of on the like, modular money, uh, stuff. I'm curious if you how you've been feeling about that lately.
00:30:20.318 - 00:30:50.120, Speaker C: It feels like sometimes there's like, um, like a very consistent rotation will be like bitcoin mini pump eth underperforms, solana outperforms modular money AI meme coin somewhere in there and we just kind of repeat over again. I'm curious how you've been thinking about some of the other kind of niches of crypto, like the modular money or the AI side outside of Eve.
00:30:51.420 - 00:31:37.808, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. For AI, I think my biggest stockholding is Nvidia. I actually did a lot of deep work on, maybe not that deep, right? As deep as a mid curve can do, but I did a lot of work on bittensor, filecoin, arweave render, Akash. And my conclusion was that I'd rather own Nvidia. I get that people want to like, crypto AI because it's like, you know, in theory it's like omega, like super high beta, but in practice, I don't really think any of these are like that investable. So I just result. I just own a bunch of Nvidia for like, AI exposure and for, I guess, like the modular stuff, I'm not quite sure.
00:31:37.808 - 00:32:12.362, Speaker A: Right. Obviously the sentiment is in the gutters. That's typically how it goes, right? Price goes up, everyone's euphoric, price goes down, everyone thinks it's scam. Like, my view is that. Or when I, whenever I got into like, Tia, it was like December last year, and I told myself that it would be like a cycle hold, like, whatever that means. So I'm like totally willing to just hold it to zero and, you know, be like the, be like the, like, be the poster boy for, like holding it to zero. But I also, like, minted a bunch of celestine sloth societies that's been holding up pretty well.
00:32:12.362 - 00:32:27.602, Speaker A: Like you had to be like a ts staker to mint. And it's like, worth three k, I think ish or three to 4k. So maybe. Maybe the airdrop meta goes to, like, nFt holders. I have no idea. I still think the modular narrative makes sense. It's just that no one really cares.
00:32:27.602 - 00:32:53.028, Speaker A: And if you look back on the past year, I feel like every quarter has its own big narrative. I think Q three last year was, like, rollbit and, like, unibot, and then Q four was modular. Q one this year, maybe it was, like, meme coins or bitcoin. And then q two. I don't even know what Q two was. Q two probably just meme coins, too. I don't know.
00:32:53.028 - 00:33:08.820, Speaker A: I feel like every quarter. I feel like most of these narratives, they run for, like, three months, and then they just go to zero. So I feel like that's something that people have to take into account. I don't know. There's really just not enough money in the ecosystem to, like, pump these things, you know, in perpetuity.
00:33:09.160 - 00:33:24.580, Speaker C: Have you done it? Is there, like, is there anything to do in the modular world? Like, have you. Have you found yourself going back to, like, any other types of farming in these newer ecosystems? Or is it really just like, steak?
00:33:25.000 - 00:33:45.226, Speaker A: Yeah, all you can do is steak, man. There's not. There's nothing else. There's, like, forma chain, which is like some NFT chain, but I haven't really gone there. There's, like, milky way, right? Like, the liquid staking, but I have no idea what the fuck's happening there. Yeah, I don't know. There's nothing to do.
00:33:45.226 - 00:33:49.350, Speaker A: There's nothing to do anywhere other than, like, punt on memes on sale, I guess.
00:33:49.730 - 00:33:59.440, Speaker B: Well, initially supposed to give us stuff to do over there. Right? I hope. I hope stuff on testnet. I don't know when Mainnet's going to be up.
00:34:00.220 - 00:34:01.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I know.
00:34:04.460 - 00:34:07.920, Speaker C: That'S connected to, like, the whole Celestia everything.
00:34:09.020 - 00:34:40.494, Speaker A: They use Celestia for da, and then I think their idea is, like, interwoven roll ups. So all the roll ups that use Celestia for da or, like, you know, all the modular roll ups, they're going to be connected via initia. But I feel like there's also, like, dozens of these, you know, interoperability stuff. It's like optimism, super chains, like polygon, ag, layer, initia, dimension. Like, they're all trying to do the same thing. Yeah. And it's mostly because all these l two s are just zeros.
00:34:40.494 - 00:34:41.798, Speaker A: L two s. Do you.
00:34:41.894 - 00:34:55.980, Speaker C: Do you think it goes to, like. It centers around just a few successful ones. What's your kind of, like, base case on modular versus l two s and all these different ecosystems? Do you have a favorite? Just, like, on a vibes level?
00:34:56.600 - 00:35:25.886, Speaker A: On a vibes level? I don't know. I feel like all these l two s are just so worthless. Right. Maybe it makes sense for arbitrary monoptimism to stay alive, like, even blast. I didn't think that would. It would launch like, this poorly. I didn't believe in, like, the moon boy math of, like, 5 billion or 10 billion, but I'd be like, oh, yeah, maybe 3 billion and, you know, taper, it'll be around there, but, like, now it's like a billion or, like, sub billion.
00:35:25.886 - 00:35:42.752, Speaker A: Uh, and I guess that kind of tells you where we are. Um, I'm kind of. Except for mega eth. I think people think it's kind of cringe that they call it, like, mega eth. Like, make it their immigrant. But I think that, you know, that that's actually, like, a good branding. You know, ethereum is not great.
00:35:42.752 - 00:35:59.824, Speaker A: So this could actually be, like, the thing to make Eth great again. And, like, I think EtH people understand that the l two roadmap is, like, not really great. So maybe they're going to, like, just really show mega ETh because it's like this omega high performance l two, you know? I have no idea.
00:35:59.912 - 00:36:00.232, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:00.296 - 00:36:04.500, Speaker A: But I feel like the vibes are, like, better than, like, any other l two right now.
00:36:05.560 - 00:36:42.470, Speaker C: Yeah. Apparently Mega also is some math thing, some big brain kind of math thing. So I've kind of enjoyed the name as well, because it's like they kind of position it as fulfilling the needs of the left and the right curve in terms of branding. So, yeah, I think they're pretty exciting. It's like 100K tps. Um, the, the whole, like, sequencer rotation thing, I think is, like, pretty cool and new. Um, if they can pull that off, that'd be cool.
00:36:42.470 - 00:37:10.430, Speaker C: And, you know, chain go fast, maybe we can have some, like, new daps. I mean, I've seen and heard of some, like, interesting, interesting. Some interesting stuff, and, uh, but there's, you know, there's going to be a. There's going to be a lot of competition in the, in the chain go fast world, so it's gonna be interesting to see. But, yeah, they're, they're a cool team. I think Maggie is exciting as well. Are you a.
00:37:10.430 - 00:37:18.230, Speaker C: Are you a, like, discord community farming at all? Are you, like, a big monad person?
00:37:18.970 - 00:37:42.040, Speaker A: No, I mean, that's cool, but, like, I'm not gonna be out here, like, clicking galaxy quests or discord roles. I can't, you know, I. I'm desperate, but I'm not that desperate. Nothing. I mean, nothing against the discord grinders, obviously, but, yeah, respect. I'm just too busy. Yeah, I respect all those guys.
00:37:42.040 - 00:37:49.580, Speaker A: But there's other things I need to do other than, like, beg for, like, a nad role or whatever.
00:37:50.330 - 00:37:51.898, Speaker C: Yeah. Have you.
00:37:51.994 - 00:38:05.550, Speaker B: Those nads have been eating, though, at least, like, in. In the past. Airdrops, they've gotten. They got what, like twelve k wormhole. Yeah, it's worth like $5 now, but at the time, we thought it was going to be worth like, ten k.
00:38:06.770 - 00:38:09.190, Speaker A: It was worth ten k for, like, the first day.
00:38:09.610 - 00:38:10.370, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:10.410 - 00:38:13.070, Speaker A: And then now is it like a three?
00:38:20.210 - 00:38:46.310, Speaker B: That kind of blew me. They vested, and there was, like, a surprise cliff because they couldn't figure out, like, the streaming process or, like, Solana was broken or something. So they. They, like, it was vested. It still is vested for the next, like, I don't know, six months. And there was, like, obviously the token dumped in, like, the first week, and they couldn't get the, like, vesting to work, so nobody got any tokens until the token was already down like 70%.
00:38:47.820 - 00:38:51.172, Speaker A: I can't believe wormhole is at 2.2. It's at $0.21.
00:38:51.196 - 00:38:51.852, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:52.036 - 00:38:52.828, Speaker A: So bad.
00:38:52.924 - 00:38:53.640, Speaker B: Yes.
00:38:54.860 - 00:38:57.052, Speaker A: They reached the bill or something, right?
00:38:57.236 - 00:39:03.360, Speaker C: Have you used wormhole in the last. Since the airdrop. Be honest.
00:39:04.020 - 00:39:12.688, Speaker A: Since the airdrop? No, I mean, even before the airdrop. Like, I used wormhole to bridge, like, bridge, like, away from Luna Terra.
00:39:12.744 - 00:39:13.384, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:13.552 - 00:39:19.740, Speaker A: And also, like, bridging to, like, to and from Algorand. And it was horrible. Like, I hate wormhole. The user experience.
00:39:20.840 - 00:39:33.780, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now deep bridge is just going to be just like, a really bad valuation, I think. Even though it's. I think it's a lot better of an experience.
00:39:35.840 - 00:39:36.688, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:36.864 - 00:39:38.140, Speaker B: It's going to go to zero.
00:39:39.000 - 00:39:39.624, Speaker C: What'd you say?
00:39:39.672 - 00:39:39.952, Speaker A: Zero?
00:39:40.016 - 00:39:57.540, Speaker B: Yeah, their activity is going to go to zero. Yeah. They charge too much in fees and they did a good job with their points program and, like, their. Their messaging and their UI, so, like, it was pretty clear that that's why people were using it. But now it's like, you know, what, what's the point? Jumper has points. Why not go use jumper instead?
00:39:59.160 - 00:40:00.536, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fair.
00:40:00.608 - 00:40:03.518, Speaker B: That's just the bridge game for. For the time being.
00:40:03.704 - 00:40:08.470, Speaker C: Have you. Have you messed around in, like, the bitcoin ecosystem?
00:40:11.330 - 00:40:42.670, Speaker A: I mean, I looked into it. I had people look into it, but I don't know, it's not that exciting. Like, the bitcoin lending bitcoin defi just sucks. I don't think it makes sense. I mean, except for op cat, though, like with UD and Eric wall, I think. I haven't checked quantum cats floor in a while, but I think if there's anything in the bitcoin eco that I want to have exposure to, it'd be quantum cats. Just in case, like, you know, they pull it off.
00:40:42.670 - 00:40:58.984, Speaker A: They pull it off and who knows? Like maybe, like if cat VM has a token, they'll airdrop to quantum cats. So maybe it's worth like just holding one NFT per wallet or something. They're expensive, though. It's like 0.28.27.
00:40:59.152 - 00:41:04.580, Speaker B: Yeah, but they've held up well relative to the rest of the, the rest of the ordinals.
00:41:05.040 - 00:41:09.008, Speaker A: Yeah. Really well, actually, like, they probably really good sign.
00:41:09.104 - 00:41:54.550, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think so. I had some. I used to, like, back when ordinals were like actually kind of hot and like, you know, there would be regular, like good mints and I, you know, puppets and node monkeys were at like half a bitcoin or whatever. I used to spend time in a couple of different, like, discords. And I would, whenever I would talk about quantum cats, I would always get told that, like, they are like the, like the one, like mid curve ordinal, you know, like you can ape node monkeys for like ape node monkeys for like the community or puppets for the culture. But like, if you're, if you're in quantum cats, like, you're just, you're just straight up, like mid curve. Like you're overthinking the trade and you're doing too much.
00:41:54.550 - 00:41:59.950, Speaker B: But look at us now. We're, we're the only ones who aren't down, like 80%.
00:42:01.210 - 00:42:03.930, Speaker A: Isn't pups down? Like, how much are pups down?
00:42:03.970 - 00:42:10.710, Speaker B: Pups are down bad. They're, they're like sub 0.1. I think they went from like what .35 or 0.45 something.
00:42:13.020 - 00:42:20.440, Speaker A: I'm looking at the token it went to. Oh, yeah, like $100. Huh? It's like, now it's $3.
00:42:21.020 - 00:42:24.920, Speaker C: Yeah, that and wizards. Yeah, yeah.
00:42:25.420 - 00:42:26.680, Speaker B: Half of bitcoin.
00:42:28.420 - 00:42:30.560, Speaker A: That's crazy how they were worth having bitcoin.
00:42:31.380 - 00:42:39.432, Speaker B: Yeah, crazy how they were worth half a bitcoin. And I didn't even consider selling. I was like, nah, like, it's, it's going to.
00:42:39.456 - 00:42:40.680, Speaker A: One fair value is.
00:42:40.720 - 00:42:53.980, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. 30k for, for a ten k collection and like, early bull cycle. Like, yeah, this. This is going to run some more. I'll just. My thesis was, I'll just wait till I see Steph Curry buy one and then sell.
00:42:54.440 - 00:42:59.020, Speaker C: But I remember people posting that meme.
00:43:01.560 - 00:43:05.310, Speaker B: I still like them. I still like ordinals too, as a narrative.
00:43:06.010 - 00:43:39.412, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, I'm like, always a bag holder, right? When it comes to tokens, I always bag hold. But, like, I actually, like, sold pudgies, like, near the top because I just like, asked myself, like, should. Should a pudgy penguin be worth like thirty five k? And I was like, wait, like, I'm not sure about this or like, whatever the price was. Like, I love Luca and like, pudgies and whatnot, but it's like some. I feel like sometimes you should, like, look at the dollar value. It's harder to do with tokens, right.
00:43:39.412 - 00:43:59.820, Speaker A: Because you own like, many units of either whatever. And it's like, if you only ten aave or like a $100. Like, yeah, it's like a $1,000. Like whatever, but it's like one NFT for like 30k. It's like, what the fuck? Like, I cannot explain this to my fiance. And like, I heard prices really start.
00:43:59.860 - 00:44:18.376, Speaker B: To. Really start to hurt the. Yeah, there's like a. I don't want to maybe, like, you call it a mental block. It's like at a certain point you just can't really, like, who's. Who's the marginal buyer at that point, who's going to be buying for like 50k? Like, I don't know. It seems so obvious.
00:44:18.376 - 00:44:26.576, Speaker B: And there's like, obviously like a handful of examples that break away. It's the same thing with meme coins. Like, you always think it's going to be yours. That is the exception.
00:44:26.768 - 00:44:27.688, Speaker A: And then.
00:44:27.864 - 00:44:29.260, Speaker B: And then it never is.
00:44:29.640 - 00:44:33.220, Speaker A: I have a question for cedo. Like, are you still bullish parachain?
00:44:35.280 - 00:44:43.456, Speaker C: I don't know if you've seen the story, but basically I've been a bear chain. I had a bit bear for a very long time.
00:44:43.648 - 00:44:47.624, Speaker A: Oh, did you get liquidated with the loan? Yeah, I think I listened to the pod.
00:44:47.672 - 00:45:14.780, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was carelessly lending and borrowing or borrowing on arcade. Arcade for what it's worth. And Nft lending is like a very. I think it's a really good app. I always thought, like, I always thought I'd lose that bit bear from the protocol getting hacked or like something like that. But no, I just set the wrong date on my calendar for repaying the loan.
00:45:14.780 - 00:46:00.560, Speaker C: And wasn't checking notifications and forgot to pay it back, got liquidated. And the dude, I was like, I was like, e begging the dude on Twitter, just like, crying in his DM's, like, please give it back. And he just like, insta sold it for like two eth or something like that. So, I mean, I'm still, you know, happy for the bear chain eco. I mean, sometimes you go to, like, a conference and you see, like, you know, I don't know. I'm not going to try and, like, fud barachane, but it's like, it's part of the. Ali was pushing this narrative a little bit in my mind.
00:46:00.560 - 00:46:24.050, Speaker C: Even when I had my bit bear of, like, who's the marginal buyer of like a ten k bit bear at this point, or like a 20, I think it got up to, like, 18. And of course, I just ended up holding in and ending up losing it. But I. I think it's going to be interesting to see how they, like, prepare the launch and everything. I'd say I'm bullish. A lot of apps in the ecosystem.
00:46:25.350 - 00:46:30.170, Speaker A: Yeah. The vape to earn stuff looks pretty. Looks pretty sick.
00:46:31.270 - 00:46:44.920, Speaker B: Does it? Yeah, I don't, I don't. I feel like I'm going crazy when I see that stuff, man. No, it's like, don't those vapes cost a lot, too? Aren't they like a couple hundred dollars?
00:46:45.660 - 00:47:08.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's going to be really hard to scale that thing. It'll take years if they even make it happen. But I think everyone's just really horny for actual apps. So whenever I see something that's, like a consumer app adjacent, I just, I automatically support it. Good on the founder for trying something.
00:47:09.000 - 00:47:32.504, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. But it's also a vape company that raised up like, a, what, $20 million valuation. People forget how. How decoupled crypto valuations are from, like, reality. It's like, if they have, like, a real thing, like, an actual, like, physical product, that, uh, that makes things a little bit hazy.
00:47:32.672 - 00:47:32.928, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:32.944 - 00:48:28.320, Speaker C: I was in Dubai at one point when someone was pita, like, telling me about the vape to earn, and then they also shared a deck of, like, literally just like a soda, like, just like a, like a drink that was crypto adjacent and, like some kind of consumer. Consumer angle, and I was like, okay, this is, this is a little bit too far, but yeah, no, I think. I think the vape to earn will be cool. I mean, people underestimate. I think, like, I how much people are willing to pay for after the Solana phone? How much people are willing to pay for, like, mid to low level hardware to qualify for some kind of, like, airdrop or, you know, be a part of something. I think the vape to earn will be cool, but will the token do? Well, probably not. And probably not, but yeah, no, I think bear chain is, is cool.
00:48:28.320 - 00:48:46.200, Speaker C: What else is exciting these days? I was going to ask, what's your, like, um, research? Like, how does, how does stuff come up onto your radar these days? Um, is it like a thousand interns in the, in the farmers channel? How do, how do you kind of find new stuff?
00:48:46.940 - 00:49:24.750, Speaker A: I just have two interns now. Like, funny story. Like, I think when the market start pumping last year, like mid, like Q three, Q four. I was like, okay, you know what? Like, time to hire people. I hired, like, three or four additional interns, and then I had to let them all go because the market just turned to shit and I didn't really know how to manage them. Typically, I just, like, try to fuck around and find out, you know? No, no regrets, you know? Like, I have nothing against the people I hired, but, yeah, I just probably was, like, not a great manager anyways. I don't know, I feel like nowadays the markets are so slow, I try to think more longer term.
00:49:24.750 - 00:50:08.810, Speaker A: It's like, what could be hot in three months plus. And because my focus is defi, I've kind of looked back to the defi sector. Like, the defi Ogs. I feel like everyone understands DeFi has PMF, but the tokens are just absolute garbage. So I have this idea that, you know, these tokens won't be garbage forever. At some point they will become investable. So I'm more so looking for, like, high float, decent FTV DeFi projects that are category leaders that could potentially start reviving, you know, and, like, not bleed against ether BTC.
00:50:08.810 - 00:50:36.556, Speaker A: And so far I found Aave. I think Aave is pretty decent. I mean, I don't want to show it too hard, but, like, you know, I. I've been, I've been looking into Aave for like, a year now. Just, like, talking to, like, Aave people, like governance people had a general idea that, yeah, like, buybacks should happen soon in theory. So, yeah, like, let's just, like, buy it. I'm not really trying to do short term trades anymore.
00:50:36.556 - 00:51:07.010, Speaker A: Like, I don't think I have an edge short term. I think it's super PvP. So I'd rather, like, just buy things to hold for multiple months. So, yeah, defi, I think art of a is pretty good. Interesting consumer apps, although that's more like the private markets. And I guess the hottest ecosystems might be like Monad bear chain mega eth. So how does that change the landscape? I try to think about that, too.
00:51:07.010 - 00:51:14.740, Speaker A: Not too exciting, though. I'm just looking at the fundamentals and.
00:51:15.320 - 00:51:33.460, Speaker C: So what's the flow usually like? What's the flow for you? Kind of developing conviction. Is it a tweet? Is it a governance proposal? Is it a research report? Do you have some, like, trusted newsletters that you frequent? Other than the. Other than yours?
00:51:35.230 - 00:52:10.776, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm the one writing these reports nowadays because no one else is. But honestly, Twitter is like, mostly noise now. I think most of the alpha has went into, like, telegram chats or discords. So, you know, just by me being in this, in this space for so long, I think I've built a bunch of good connections. So, you know, if there's an important proposal, I usually am, like one of the first people to know about it. So I actually think that there's a lot of edge in governance forums. It's just like, no one wants to read it.
00:52:10.776 - 00:52:38.044, Speaker A: I don't like reading it either. It's just like, it's boring as shit. But you kind of have to nowadays. So I guess I already have a general view of what could be worth something, what could not be, versus what's going to be zeroed. Uh, so I'm just, like, trying to figure out, like, which tokens could potentially have a catalyst to, you know, go higher. Uh, there's like, no flow. Like, I honestly, I don't really have a process.
00:52:38.044 - 00:52:53.268, Speaker A: I just wake up and I just, I'm glued to the screen and I just, like, process so much information that I generally know what's going on everywhere, you know? Yeah, that's kind of, yeah.
00:52:53.404 - 00:53:04.640, Speaker C: And from like, a high level, would you say, like, you're on the pessimistic or optimistic side of, like, when you're observing the space these days?
00:53:05.500 - 00:53:45.786, Speaker A: I think everyone's getting pessimistic, but I'm like a very optimistic person. You know, even last year, like, fast forward twelve months ago, I think we had, like, the double top on, you know, ETF news, like the bitcoin ETF news, and then we were just chopping for, like, months, and everyone was like, showing rollbit to each other and unibot to each other. And it was also like, you know, pretty miserable back then. I think, like July, August, September last year, so I don't know. I feel like what I've noticed in crypto is that in order for people to maintain the same level of happiness, like, price has to just keep going higher.
00:53:45.958 - 00:53:46.266, Speaker C: Right?
00:53:46.298 - 00:54:08.210, Speaker A: So even if price stalls, the happiness level goes down. If price goes lower, the happiness level even deteriorates even further. So, yeah, it's like, crypto. People just need dopamine. They need pumps. A lot of, like, a lot of us, including myself, I've been holding so much ease that, you know, hasn't really done. Done that well, right, in the grand scheme of things.
00:54:08.210 - 00:54:12.122, Speaker A: So I think that also adds to the frustration and this idea that eat is dead.
00:54:12.186 - 00:54:12.750, Speaker B: I.
00:54:14.240 - 00:54:22.380, Speaker A: But, you know, I'm still optimistic. I just think, like, you know, sentiment gets bad when price goes down and. Or the ratio goes down. It is what it is, right?
00:54:23.920 - 00:54:40.822, Speaker C: Yeah, it's tough. I think that you don't ever, like, dive into. You're never, like, on a random day ape in a meme coin or taking a 100 x 50 x leverage trade. Do you ever need those dopamine shots?
00:54:41.006 - 00:54:57.290, Speaker A: No, no, I don't really. I mean, I punt around on memes, but it's just, like, very marginal positions. Yeah, it's like, I don't care about, like, ct coins, right. Because they're all just pump and dumps. I mean, they're all pumping dumps. Right. But I.
00:54:57.290 - 00:55:09.278, Speaker A: Here, I. One thing I'm looking forward to is identifying, like, a tick tock cabal coin. I feel like that's something that people don't.
00:55:09.334 - 00:55:10.930, Speaker C: There is a TikTok of all.
00:55:11.590 - 00:55:37.702, Speaker A: Yeah, no, there is. There is. But I'm looking for, like, I have this fake account called safemoon billionaire, and I have, like, the. Who is that guy? The lil pump or something, right? With the Solana tattoo. And I just follow a bunch of scammers on TikTok to see what they're showing, to see if I can identify a pattern. So it's maybe this is super mid curve, but, like, I. I'm trying to have, like, some process to identify potential meme coins, right.
00:55:37.702 - 00:55:47.582, Speaker A: I haven't found anything that's, like, that I want to even touch, but it's, like, safe. When Safemoon had pumped so hard last cycle, it's like. And that was, like, a TikTok phenomenon, right? So.
00:55:47.686 - 00:55:50.930, Speaker C: And I think ICP was too, right?
00:55:51.510 - 00:55:53.210, Speaker A: ICP was down only, though.
00:55:53.830 - 00:56:02.490, Speaker C: Yeah. But, like, I think that that high valuation launch was surrounded by, like, just how many people were eyeing it at that time.
00:56:03.040 - 00:56:04.300, Speaker A: And even Cardano.
00:56:04.880 - 00:56:07.500, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, Cardano XRP.
00:56:07.880 - 00:56:32.496, Speaker A: Cardano XRP is like a YouTube, crypto YouTube phenomenon, I think mostly. So even if you think it's a scam, if you can just make this simple bet that, hey, like, retail will buy it, it's like you can just view that as a trade. But I think people are getting smarter, though. I think retail is getting smarter. I think people have this mindset that, oh, we need retail to come to, like, buy our vaporware. But, like, we're all retail. We do our work right.
00:56:32.496 - 00:56:49.300, Speaker A: We think for ourselves. We think for ourselves. So it's like, I don't even think that we will see vapor pump. I mean, I guess vapor will always pump if, like, enough people are showing it. But I try to respect the retail. Respect the retail.
00:56:50.160 - 00:57:53.670, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's interesting how different the, like, adjacent, like, non crypto Twitter communities are with, like, the things that they're interested in. I do think that they are, like, they are like, getting a little bit more, like, smarter, like pro tail, but like, still, you know, if you go to, like, different subreddits that talk about crypto or like, TikTok, for example, or even like, Instagram reels, it's like, I don't know. I think we all kind of consider us, like, crypto Twitter and, like, our own, like, main networks and information diets to be like the real, like the real crypto social media and everybody else is kind of just, you know, like sharing other vaporware. But I mean, it's valuable. Like, it's, it's, it's actually a really good idea to, like, have some sort of a pulse on that because I don't know anyone who, like, really frequents or tries to, tries to keep track of any of these other, these other networks, these other, like, crypto Twitter adjacent bubbles.
00:57:55.890 - 00:57:57.026, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:57:57.178 - 00:58:41.912, Speaker A: Crypto throws mostly traders, right? Like, it's like Eth maxis and traders, essentially, and builders. And there's like, certain coins that never get talked about, but they pump so hard. It's like, I don't own this, but like, there's om, like the om token, like, mantra chain, I think went from, like, I think that thing is a vertical, straight vertical, right? And they're like tokenizing Dubai real estate or something. It's like, no one's talking about this. Yeah, yeah. And they have like some half a billion dollar in real estate or whatever. But I feel like CT has this condescending view of other communities on, like, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, like, oh, I'm on Twitter.
00:58:41.912 - 00:58:57.340, Speaker A: I'm so smart, you know, but I feel like that's like ego that people have. You have to respect everybody. You have to respect the markets, you have to respect all the participants. Otherwise you get cooked.
00:58:58.360 - 00:59:25.150, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you think, like, I don't know what your. I mean, everyone has different metrics for making it, right? But ultimately everyone wants to. Wants to make it. Do you think CT is, or like, crypto in general has engulfed your, like, headspace enough to even when you make it, you're kind of just going to be still around or you think you'll just kind of fuck off and be on a beach somewhere?
00:59:27.090 - 00:59:55.440, Speaker A: I mean, I think I'll always be around. I just enjoyed the making content. I just enjoy building towards something like, I mean, I'm not. I'm not, like, super rich, but I think I'm at a point where I'm, like, comfortable and I don't really have ambitions to be super rich, like, billionaire like. No, honestly, I just want, like, a nice house, you know, I'll be married soon. Just, you know, just. I just want to live a happy life.
00:59:55.440 - 01:00:25.462, Speaker A: I don't care about having a bunch of money. So it's like, I'll just keep enjoy. I'll just keep doing what I enjoy doing. And part of that is content. And I'm fortunate to be in, like, a spot where, you know, there are people that supporting me and I can make it a living. So I think I'll be, you know, like. Cause you know how in tradfite, right, like, you see, like, drucken Miller on tv, it's like, oh, my God, like, this guy's such a chaddha.
01:00:25.462 - 01:00:56.450, Speaker A: He's like 60 years old or whatever. Like, at some point crypto is going to get there. Right there. We're all going to be like 60 at some point and maybe we'll be on tv saying how this TVL metric is a scam or whatever. So I kind of want to get to that point where maybe I write a book, maybe I have a big podcast or something of just having this educator role, entertainment role, and it's like, not really for, like, the money, but it's more for just enjoyment, personal fulfillment.
01:00:58.990 - 01:00:59.930, Speaker B: Well said.
01:01:00.230 - 01:01:05.930, Speaker C: Very well. Yeah, I think. I think we can honestly end it there. I don't. I don't even know.
01:01:06.470 - 01:01:10.610, Speaker B: I don't think my heart touched your heart.
01:01:11.910 - 01:01:18.440, Speaker A: With that being said, buy my shit coins. Buy my shit coins, please. I need it.
01:01:21.540 - 01:01:48.000, Speaker B: No, that's great stuff. I appreciate you putting those thoughts out there. I think a lot of people definitely could benefit from hearing that. Yeah, we are over time here a little bit. So do you want to wrap up before we do? So if there's any other, I don't know, closing remarks, calls to action you have for the people, anything maybe you want to share from what you're working on, or maybe anything you want to show, other words of wisdom, anything like that.
01:01:51.180 - 01:02:07.276, Speaker A: Buy my bags, drive to exit liquidity. And, you know, it's okay to be a mid curve. You know, we're all mid curves. Everyone's trying. Everyone pretends to be right. Curves on Twitter. But the truth of the matter is, it's okay to be a mid curve.
01:02:07.276 - 01:02:09.880, Speaker A: You just have to embrace it. Yeah.
01:02:12.230 - 01:02:18.798, Speaker B: Well said. Well said. All right, well, that was episode 85. Thanks again, Tyke.
