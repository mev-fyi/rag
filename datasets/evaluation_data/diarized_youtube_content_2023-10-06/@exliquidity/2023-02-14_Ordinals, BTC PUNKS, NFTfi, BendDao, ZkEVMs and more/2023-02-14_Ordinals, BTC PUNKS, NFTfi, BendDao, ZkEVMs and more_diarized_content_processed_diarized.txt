00:00:00.360 - 00:00:06.830, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:06.990 - 00:00:47.398, Speaker B: All right. Episode five of this podcast, exit Liquidity. I don't know if you noticed, actually, I forgot to mention this, but I'm back on Riverside for this recording because the whole first half of the last podcast, like, I spent editing it and it all worked. And then it was just a black screen when it published, so I don't know if you noticed that. And then the part where you're sharing screen, the way, like, zoom grabbed the camera angles, like, completely messed it up. So we're back on here. This is much smoother, much easier.
00:00:47.398 - 00:00:51.134, Speaker B: But I'm glad you didn't notice. Hope the viewers.
00:00:51.182 - 00:01:02.170, Speaker A: No, honestly, I told you I don't watch these, so I didn't notice. I watched the clips you put up, but that's all I can really. I can really take, to be honest.
00:01:03.750 - 00:01:18.958, Speaker B: Yeah, but. All right. Another week in crypto as an OG. NFt, people, let's talk about the ordinals. What's your take on the ordeal? Ordinals NFT play from the big.
00:01:19.054 - 00:01:30.498, Speaker A: They became as polarizing as they did this quickly. Like, people either see it as like a zero to one innovation, or they're like, this is fucking dumb. Like, why?
00:01:30.554 - 00:01:30.834, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:01:30.842 - 00:02:17.200, Speaker A: It seems like. Yeah, yeah. To me, it seems like the argument is either like, it's bitcoin's first, like, actual, I don't want to say use case, but it's the first thing that bitcoin does that isn't just bitcoin, the first thing that one has ever done. And then the argument from, like, the EtH Maxis seemed to be like, it's not feasible for there to be infrastructure to sustain this. If you want to inscribe a block, if you want to inscribe something on a block for the sake of doing so, like, that's awesome. By all means, go for it. But there's never going to be, like, trustless infrastructure to trade stuff like this or to do anything more with it than just owning.
00:02:18.980 - 00:02:23.244, Speaker B: You don't think, like, technologically can be flushed out or what do you think?
00:02:23.292 - 00:02:50.648, Speaker A: I don't know. In my mind, the thing is, I don't know. It seems like a tenuous argument because it's not like open sea is, like, decentralized. I don't know. Are people holding this to a higher standard because it's bitcoin or what makes this different? Because I don't know. Obviously a lot of people use blur now. Like, other marketplaces have gotten some sort of market share, but it's still all just like, open and like, with some things being centralized.
00:02:50.648 - 00:03:25.984, Speaker A: Like, I think I've talked about this before, maybe in this episode. I think with some things being centralized, it's like a temporary solution, like, in favor of, like, efficiency or like, scalability over centralization. So, like, having centralized sequencers, for example, that's just a trade off we have to make for now. And, like, it's understood that it's not going to be that way forever. But the argument of having actually, like, decentralized trading for nfts is not one you hear quite often. So I don't know, like, it could just be.
00:03:26.112 - 00:03:51.884, Speaker B: I don't know if. Yeah, I don't think. I don't think people care. Like you said, like, opensea is the biggest one, the bitcoin crowd, I feel like they really like the inscriptions part, because I've seen a lot of people, like, they. I've tried to use that, that ordinals, like website. It's disgusting. It's terrible to use.
00:03:51.884 - 00:04:24.532, Speaker B: I see it getting better. It's so bad and I see it getting better, but I don't see, like you said, I don't know if I see the bitcoin people caring enough to make it better, but I feel like most of the eth people, like it is because it's flooding the, and like, clogging up the bitcoin network. And just like a meme of, oh, you guys were shitting on us for having, like, useless jpegs on our chain and now you do too. Because from what I understand, I think.
00:04:24.556 - 00:04:27.680, Speaker A: You'Re the only person I've heard that from. I haven't looked into it too much.
00:04:29.100 - 00:04:30.196, Speaker B: Like what part?
00:04:30.268 - 00:04:34.960, Speaker A: The argument of Eve Maxis, like, liking it because it's like flooding up the chain.
00:04:35.840 - 00:05:42.120, Speaker B: No, I don't think it, like, is gonna break bitcoin, but I think because most of the, most of the people on that use bitcoin, like, they never liked, apparently I wasn't, like, here to observe this myself, but apparently the sentiment was that attacks on bitcoin have come from people using the chain, other than sharing value from one wallet to the next. And that's where some of the forks came. And that's where some of the arguments over block size and stuff came, is like a safety mechanism. And so the way that ordinals works is basically through, like, the founder, I was listening to what he was talking about, Casey something, and it's not supposed to happen. It uses, they say, like, it's tricking the taproot code into doing something it's not supposed to. And so they use these. It basically just tracks the satoshis or whatever and gives them like a label that is like trackable, almost like a NFT.
00:05:42.120 - 00:06:46.126, Speaker B: And that really wasn't supposed to happen. And so I think that's why people don't like, people from the bitcoin community don't like it. And I think that's why people from Ethereum like it is, because it wasn't supposed to happen kind of thing and someone found a way to make it happen. It's like a weird, I feel like coding nerds like that kind of stuff where like, they trick the code or something like that. And so I think it's a meme of like actually clogging the chain because people say that eventually, when the halvings and all of those end, and whenever they end for bitcoin, there's like security concerns of whether or not the security of the chain can be maintained because there's not going to be much incentive to secure the transactions if no one's doing anything on the blockchain. Because at a certain point they're going to be selling block space completely. If there's nothing happening on the blockchain, no one's going to take the time to secure it.
00:06:46.126 - 00:07:08.240, Speaker B: So the people on sassle, I don't know how much this, how much truth there is to it, but that's like the sentiment from ETh heavy people is that eventually, when the havings stop, then blockchain is not, and bitcoin is not going to be a secure blockchain because no one's going to be. Apparently they're facing a security problem once those, I guess, incentives stop.
00:07:08.320 - 00:07:15.998, Speaker A: That's not like an argument that's new, though, is it? Like, I feel like I've heard that over the past couple months.
00:07:16.184 - 00:07:16.954, Speaker B: Like, just know.
00:07:17.002 - 00:07:19.306, Speaker A: But as that problem, that's inevitable.
00:07:19.378 - 00:07:43.070, Speaker B: Yeah, but the meme is that with this, they make the use case that they've hated the whole time kind of thing, people. And if ordinals come along, like they've hated this idea of NFTs on Ethereum and now it's might be the only thing that saves them in their long term security plan kind of thing. I think that's where the meme come from.
00:07:43.410 - 00:07:53.746, Speaker A: I feel like I haven't heard a lot of those people in the past couple months of the true, like bitcoin Nazis, like the ones who, like the.
00:07:53.778 - 00:07:59.626, Speaker B: Sailor types of bubble. Yeah, like a theory and bubble.
00:07:59.658 - 00:08:09.586, Speaker A: I feel like yeah, but I would hear more of them in the past. Maybe my information died has changed, but I would hear a lot more of them in the past, I feel like. And now it feels like the ones.
00:08:09.618 - 00:08:11.270, Speaker B: Like, saying what specifically?
00:08:11.970 - 00:08:39.692, Speaker A: Like, just the ones who. Who consider Eth like a shit coin and who think bitcoins, like, the best store, the best asset for storing value among all others, going to a million or whatever. It's. It seems like there's less of those people around than there were in the past. And I thought something like this would make them, like, come out more, but it hasn't really. At least not on, like, my.
00:08:39.756 - 00:08:41.440, Speaker B: I feel like they don't know what to say.
00:08:42.620 - 00:08:47.200, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a weird, weird spot to be, like, stuck. Yeah.
00:08:49.820 - 00:09:02.652, Speaker B: But I do the. Have you made any place in the. On those, like, bitcoin specifically, but the ones that are, like, a theory will inscribe later?
00:09:02.836 - 00:09:19.238, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. Fucking bought the top on one and lost 30% or something like that. But I don't know, in my mind, because it seems like a lot of those are either derivatives or they're like. Like, the dumbest shit I've seen is like, the ordinal punks, which, like, like.
00:09:19.334 - 00:09:32.222, Speaker B: The hundred count collection or the one that literally copy pasted 10,000 punk one was. Yeah, the first one has been like, getting the first one kind of makes.
00:09:32.286 - 00:10:15.692, Speaker A: More sense because the first one was a part of the first, like, x number hundred insertion. So it was like a historic thing, actually. No, yeah, I guess it was more of the second one, which was like, maybe I'm remembering wrong, but it was like, inscribed onto bitcoin, wrapped, put on etherium, and then sold on Opensea so they can be like, burn what? I don't understand. And like, these things, like, if you look at the price charts for some of these things, like, some of the existing collections that were just like, hey, we're gonna. We're gonna let you burn. Inscribe onto bitcoin. Like, it's literally just like, flat charts with, like, maybe five sales in the past, like two years.
00:10:15.692 - 00:10:31.100, Speaker A: And then they announced this, and it absolutely moves just like, 200 x's for a day. And then it draws down another, like 80, 90% after that. Like, I totally box playing those. I remember seeing the first one too, the black hole one, whatever. That was totally botched playing that.
00:10:31.180 - 00:10:32.556, Speaker B: That one's been up for that.
00:10:32.708 - 00:10:34.800, Speaker A: The black hole one. What was that one called?
00:10:36.470 - 00:10:40.718, Speaker B: I have not orbit or something like that.
00:10:40.894 - 00:10:50.366, Speaker A: No, celestial something. No, celestial is the other one. I don't remember? It's been out for a while, though. Actually, no, no, maybe not that. Maybe not that one, but the other ones by the same.
00:10:50.438 - 00:10:52.022, Speaker B: Oh, there's, like, two other collections by.
00:10:52.046 - 00:11:12.088, Speaker A: The same creator on the edge of the boardroom. It's 0.65 now. This one's new, but there's two others. There's two others that were made by the same people, that the chart still looks the same, completely, like nothing. And then all of a sudden, ordinals, let's just add another two e to the floor.
00:11:12.144 - 00:11:15.120, Speaker B: So I don't know. I don't really don't like it. You don't like this?
00:11:15.160 - 00:11:19.808, Speaker A: I don't like it. As like, a trading. From, like, a trading perspective, do you.
00:11:19.824 - 00:11:31.452, Speaker B: Think there's the room for infrastructure pitched it at your and different alternate universe?
00:11:31.516 - 00:11:52.000, Speaker A: If opensea exists, then yeah, why not? I don't know. Maybe I don't know enough about the infrastructure to say for sure or not, but maybe it's not feasible for there to be, like, actually, like, decentralized infrastructure for this one day. But I don't know, is that even, like, on the, like, are we ever going to even get there? It doesn't seem to be that important to the community.
00:11:54.990 - 00:12:48.978, Speaker B: Users, I guess I'm also curious of what the percentage of bitcoin people like, those bitcoin people you were talking about previously, what percentage of those people actually enjoy nfts? Because it seems like there's a few of them that would buy these things. But it also feels like everyone's just inscribing anything right now. Like, people are just doing it to do it. Whether or not people are buying these inscriptions, it seems because the inscription count just keeps flying up. Like, I see those charts on Twitter, there's, like, thousands and thousands every single day, and the numbers just, like, multiplying. And so I think people are just inscribing for a joke or, like, on dreams, but I just want to know. I guess it would be interesting to see, like, volume.
00:12:48.978 - 00:13:22.910, Speaker B: It's hard because volume for top, like, the first a thousand inscriptions is gonna be stupid. Like, we already know it's gonna be dumb money. Like, not dumb money, but, like, a dumb amount of money buying those just because it's, like, the first thousand. Like, I get that. But outside of that, I'm be curious to see if bitcoin people are, like, looking for gen art projects and, like, rotating from project to projects, just like, the same way it works on Ethereum. If you see that, if you see that and you like a community flesh out. Yeah, I could see ordinals being a decent play.
00:13:24.210 - 00:13:24.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:25.330 - 00:13:33.098, Speaker B: Maybe we grab something off the first a thousand. Dude, I don't think that's a bad move at all. Those are first a thousand.
00:13:33.154 - 00:13:36.630, Speaker A: I don't think there's a single. I don't think there's a single one under one bitcoin.
00:13:38.270 - 00:13:48.650, Speaker B: Really. First a thousand. I know 1st 100 was going crazy, but first a thousand too. Maybe we target 1st 10,000.
00:13:52.590 - 00:14:14.550, Speaker A: I don't know. What I think was really cool was watching. Just watching how they were able to include more in each inscription from like for. I remember when that. When this thing like very, like when it very first started to get bigger and at first they were just putting some like dog shit. Like a couple of pixels. Like on chain or scribing a couple of pixels.
00:14:14.550 - 00:14:21.494, Speaker A: And then they put. I don't know if you saw. They put. They put doom in its inscription. You can go on like whatever. The ordinal swap people have been playing.
00:14:21.542 - 00:14:23.570, Speaker B: Doom on bitcoin for a while.
00:14:24.150 - 00:14:24.890, Speaker A: Really?
00:14:25.470 - 00:14:35.114, Speaker B: Yeah. The bank was guy talks about it all the time. He's been talking about it for like weeks now. Like they've had that doom shit set up on bitcoin for a good while now.
00:14:35.162 - 00:14:35.346, Speaker A: The.
00:14:35.378 - 00:15:07.980, Speaker B: The guy who made ordinals, there was a. Another random person that before ordinals technically went live as a usable thing. Someone was already on there and used the like ordinals code I guess to be able and mint the first thing. I'm pretty sure the first one minted is like a crypto dick butt. I don't know if you saw that, but yeah, ordinals. We'll see what happens. I think it's something there, but it's still nascent.
00:15:07.980 - 00:15:10.240, Speaker B: I didn't know how nascent it was for.
00:15:11.420 - 00:15:12.748, Speaker A: I'm looking at blur right now and.
00:15:12.764 - 00:15:17.484, Speaker B: There'S still is the 15 minutes like showing a bunch of ordinal shit a couple on there.
00:15:17.532 - 00:15:41.382, Speaker A: Yeah, I was. I just saw one that that is actually like it just launched. It's done eleven eth in the past. Sorry, 18th in the past 20 minutes in volume. That was because it's because it's because they're putting it on ordinals. Series of 3d generative artwork, blah, blah, blah. It's grabbing an asset that backs an NFT of the bitcoin blockchain something.
00:15:41.382 - 00:15:42.930, Speaker A: Censorship resistance.
00:15:44.950 - 00:15:47.774, Speaker B: You want to share screen on that? You're going to buy one. What's the floor?
00:15:47.822 - 00:15:55.668, Speaker A: Maybe it's not the floor .25 just because it's doing like good volume. Like it just launched. It's eleven and 15 minutes.
00:15:55.724 - 00:15:58.920, Speaker B: Yeah. 18 and 20 minutes on a Sunday is.
00:15:59.780 - 00:16:00.324, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:00.412 - 00:16:01.132, Speaker B: Pretty crazy.
00:16:01.196 - 00:16:11.108, Speaker A: And the arts, I don't know how I feel about the art, but it's gen art. 0.25. What did this meant that the weird thing is the Twitter only has 64 followers.
00:16:11.164 - 00:16:12.680, Speaker B: 64 followers.
00:16:16.400 - 00:16:17.344, Speaker A: Something, I guess.
00:16:17.432 - 00:16:26.860, Speaker B: Can you see any of the transactions? Is it all the same fucking wallet? Holy tabs.
00:16:27.320 - 00:16:35.784, Speaker A: Yeah, there's 72%. Unique owners. I guess that's kind of place a trying to fill.
00:16:35.832 - 00:16:36.896, Speaker B: That's a good number.
00:16:37.088 - 00:16:43.240, Speaker A: 2.21, something like that. Maybe I won't get pulled that low. I'll place an order.
00:16:43.320 - 00:17:00.340, Speaker B: We'll be back next week to. Yeah, ordinals. We'll see how that plays out. I like them. I can enjoy the etherium and then we'll burn this and script this and that. I don't know. I think it could be cool.
00:17:00.340 - 00:17:21.510, Speaker B: Next on the dock, let's throw in some. We can transition from ordinals, NfT to a little tiny bit of NFT Phi. We talk about it every week, but. Yeah, I think. I think NFT five. Have you used Bendao before?
00:17:22.530 - 00:17:23.270, Speaker A: No.
00:17:25.490 - 00:17:29.082, Speaker B: I'm not a huge fan of their significant difference.
00:17:29.146 - 00:17:31.322, Speaker A: Last time I took it. Last time I took a look at it.
00:17:31.346 - 00:17:33.470, Speaker B: Are they peer to peer?
00:17:34.250 - 00:17:35.590, Speaker A: Another period of cool.
00:17:37.370 - 00:17:55.522, Speaker B: Okay, they're doing, they're doing a lot of volume. They have a decent percent of market share. Let me share screen here. Just run through this doing thing.
00:17:55.586 - 00:18:36.120, Speaker A: I think that, or at least me personally, I'm convinced that the reason why Bendao is done so much better than because I feel like J. Actually, I don't know when which was launched, but I remember hearing about JPEG much sooner than really any NFT five protocol. Actually. It was just, I don't know, maybe it was because, like, Tetra and like, his crew were backing it, but I. I just remember hearing about it a lot sooner than every other protocol. I mean, as far as I know it works just fine, like, for what it is, but I know that Bendos didn't even have any fucking market share. What happened? What happened to them?
00:18:36.420 - 00:18:43.180, Speaker B: They're taking 50 there. They took 50% of the share just recently. They're blowing up.
00:18:43.340 - 00:18:49.360, Speaker A: Yeah. Why are they doing so well? See what they're offering.
00:18:51.660 - 00:18:55.420, Speaker B: We gotta check them out. Let's see if we can get some more spoon specific.
00:18:57.920 - 00:19:13.712, Speaker A: Apes, hugs, mutant apes, suzuki zoombergs, doodles, space doodles, and clone exes. That's a pretty. Yeah, but for peer to pool, that's a pretty respectable. Pretty respectable.
00:19:13.856 - 00:19:21.976, Speaker B: But why are they going? Why are they going? Why are people going bend down, peer to pool over JPeg? Peer to pool? That's what.
00:19:22.008 - 00:19:25.230, Speaker A: Nobody's going to JPEG, it seems. That's what I'm wondering, people.
00:19:25.310 - 00:19:37.702, Speaker B: Literally nobody. But the borrow, the borrowing cost is like 5% versus like the average for. Yeah, I remember last time I checked.
00:19:37.726 - 00:19:51.674, Speaker A: JPeG, JPeg had bad punks. I think they had those like, rocks. That was a little bit before my time, but there were like rocks, you know, I'm talking about the rock nfts, though.
00:19:51.762 - 00:19:57.074, Speaker B: Yeah, ether rock. I'm pretty sure someone did those on.
00:19:57.162 - 00:20:05.282, Speaker A: Yeah, see, the thing with JPeG has.
00:20:05.306 - 00:20:20.920, Speaker B: A lot of jpegs is they. They use their, like, own basically stable coin, but you can borrow an e too. But it's like Jpeg D's. I guess maybe that's what's causing people not to.
00:20:22.220 - 00:20:28.500, Speaker A: What was the chart you're looking at on Dune? What was that like? Was that number of borrowers? Was that what share?
00:20:28.620 - 00:20:32.200, Speaker B: This was lending market share.
00:20:33.300 - 00:20:59.500, Speaker A: So is this like daily volume or like TBL? Because Bendao has something now. JPEG had apparently almost 30 mil in tbL, according to website. I don't know. I also remember I tried farming on JPEG once, way back when, and I couldn't do it. I have a bit of JPEG I couldn't swap to. I couldn't swap to USD for whatever reason. I don't remember why, but I just wasn't able to.
00:21:01.200 - 00:21:05.040, Speaker B: Here's borrow volume. JPEG has literally 0%.
00:21:05.200 - 00:21:06.800, Speaker A: That's. That can't be zero.
00:21:06.840 - 00:21:25.720, Speaker B: And 1% really a borrow volume. I don't know what the stat is for. Normalized borrow volume. USD weekly bar platform. Yeah, bend out. Just eating away. I don't know why.
00:21:27.780 - 00:21:35.940, Speaker A: I know Ben Dow. I don't know if you would call it BD, but I know they, they work with some, like, larger borrowers to onboard them.
00:21:35.980 - 00:21:47.364, Speaker B: Do they, do they allow for. Do you just borrow straight eth or do they have their own thing? Pendo. Yeah. Cumulative bend out users.
00:21:47.412 - 00:22:11.350, Speaker A: Oh, this is, this is why they're fucking. They're offering rewards and their bend token. So if you bought, you can borrow at 22%, but you're gonna be earning 50% in bend tokens for doing so. So technically it's profitable to borrow, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't.
00:22:11.890 - 00:22:13.350, Speaker B: They've only had one.
00:22:16.290 - 00:22:21.390, Speaker A: Damn. What? Ben? What? Ben? Token.
00:22:23.170 - 00:22:26.670, Speaker B: When was that launch? Ten x.
00:22:27.050 - 00:22:48.178, Speaker A: It's ten x since anywhere. Since December. Like early December. Wow. I guess this is. Maybe this is like an NFT by narrative that people have no other way to play. So it just all goes into the Ben token.
00:22:48.178 - 00:23:08.370, Speaker A: Holy shit. Their fpv is ridiculous. There's five 5% of the tokens in the floating supply right now. Everything else is yet to be circulated. What is it about this 330 mil? They're floating right now. It's 16 mil. 1617.
00:23:08.370 - 00:23:14.450, Speaker A: Damn. How has no one been talking? Surprising.
00:23:15.830 - 00:23:19.110, Speaker B: They've done 1.5 million and borrows just today.
00:23:19.150 - 00:23:22.258, Speaker A: Why would you not be borrowing? Honestly, if you have.
00:23:22.354 - 00:23:23.018, Speaker B: That is true.
00:23:23.074 - 00:23:32.390, Speaker A: Apes, punks, Azuki's, moonbirds, doodles, Cornex's, whatever, you could easily.
00:23:32.730 - 00:23:40.074, Speaker B: Yeah, the borrow volume is like way more significant than the repay volume. I guess this all comes back on certain term dates.
00:23:40.122 - 00:23:43.258, Speaker A: But wonder what kind of LTV you can get here.
00:23:43.434 - 00:24:08.436, Speaker B: 9000 cumulative users. Oh, this is interesting. NfT PI only should be bigger than 16 borrow volume. Yeah, this really should. 1.5 million in the second best is like three hundred k and borrow volumes. Yeah, it's incentivized.
00:24:08.436 - 00:24:25.930, Speaker B: How much more incentivization could they do? 100k for arcade, ten for drops. JPEG cumulative borrow is five point. They don't have the today borrow volume. They got 5.7 on cumulative.
00:24:26.010 - 00:24:41.730, Speaker A: Why would you. Why the fuck would anybody be borrowing Jake, if this exists? Like just borrow on bend out, dump your tokens as you get them. And you're literally getting paid to borrow. It's like. It's like anchor. There was a time when anchor. When it was profitable.
00:24:41.730 - 00:24:43.110, Speaker A: Borrow on anchor.
00:24:44.890 - 00:24:51.470, Speaker B: I'm sure they would love that comparison. No, that's actually really cool.
00:24:56.410 - 00:25:06.070, Speaker A: Like a clone x or something. Whatever the cheapest like token is and just borrow. Let's just print money until the token starts to go down. But.
00:25:07.510 - 00:25:23.490, Speaker B: But they're pretty early because if everyone just mimics that and everyone just starts borrowing dump before it all explodes. Something like that is after comparing it to anchor. Let's go into the tokenomics real quick.
00:25:24.390 - 00:25:29.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I'd have to. It would be good to know like what their missions look like for this.
00:25:29.910 - 00:25:32.950, Speaker B: Is it bend out or bend now?
00:25:33.110 - 00:25:35.134, Speaker A: Bend out.
00:25:35.262 - 00:25:36.862, Speaker B: Oh, I see.
00:25:36.966 - 00:25:43.038, Speaker A: Bendao is a different. There's a bend down and there's also been specific dow. Yeah, yeah.
00:25:43.214 - 00:25:44.650, Speaker B: Let's take a glance.
00:25:45.510 - 00:25:56.782, Speaker A: Oh yeah. And there's about escrow bend also where you earn protocol revenue. Damn. Then that might be doing something where.
00:25:56.806 - 00:26:04.678, Speaker B: Is like docs out here? This is surprising. Look at us. We're giving the people alpha here, we're like ten x late.
00:26:04.734 - 00:26:14.330, Speaker A: But I mean, it's still there. Like still bar some shit off, I guess. How did you have to, like, if you're borrowing, you can pay it off anytime. It's not like you have to.
00:26:15.270 - 00:26:30.460, Speaker B: Same interest models, obvious token, you can. Where is their token? Ben dynamics. I fucking hate that. Borrow incentive, 40% treasury 21. The fuck is an IFO?
00:26:31.720 - 00:26:41.780, Speaker A: Initial, initial fair launch offering. Wait, look at that chart. Look at that graph down there. LP incentive is green.
00:26:42.800 - 00:26:44.540, Speaker B: 14Th month. Lock.
00:26:51.280 - 00:26:57.630, Speaker A: A uniswap lp instead. Not actual. When bombs and invested, one man online.
00:26:58.570 - 00:27:01.950, Speaker B: Literally released, released in five years, man.
00:27:02.330 - 00:27:08.230, Speaker A: All right, maybe don't go and borrow against your punch or whatever.
00:27:09.490 - 00:27:13.618, Speaker B: Why not? Five years, your rewards are gonna be.
00:27:13.634 - 00:27:15.790, Speaker A: Invested for five years.
00:27:16.930 - 00:27:24.970, Speaker B: Oh, wait, that's the lockup for people that are borrowing. Or is this how long they're gonna be able to keep this going?
00:27:26.750 - 00:27:36.610, Speaker A: So it means that whatever the 50% that they're paying out in bend tokens, it takes a year for five years for all of those to unlock. So.
00:27:44.870 - 00:28:08.920, Speaker B: 40% investing linearly across five years. You're right, that's good for them. It doesn't like, shoot. Like, they don't immediately die after everyone just fucking borrows on everything and dumps their token.
00:28:09.000 - 00:28:12.838, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's a shame. I thought we'd found some alpha, but I guess we have it.
00:28:12.944 - 00:28:18.618, Speaker B: But the one thing. Yeah, what are you voting on? You can vote on all of the.
00:28:18.714 - 00:28:43.930, Speaker A: You're getting protocol. You can vote on which what gets whitelisted, what LTV ratios are. Grab a tissue real quick. I guess what this does do is that it bodes well for, like, future NFT fi tokens. I think, like, 330 is over a quarter. Over a quarter bill FTV for a protocol that's dumping tokens to it, to its users.
00:28:45.350 - 00:28:48.142, Speaker B: I'm telling you, man, that NFt, that's a bad valuation.
00:28:48.246 - 00:29:07.102, Speaker A: It's fully diluted. It's hard to say. It's. Especially if they're. Especially if you have users locking up, remote escrowing their bender. If you have a lot of those rewards locked up for five years, it's hard to say, but 330 mil? Yeah. That's a terrible valuation.
00:29:07.102 - 00:29:11.150, Speaker A: How much volume are these guys doing that they deserve a quarter? They did.
00:29:11.930 - 00:29:14.690, Speaker B: They did one and a half in borrows today.
00:29:14.770 - 00:29:18.538, Speaker A: What's. Okay, what's uniswap's valuation? Uniswap is.
00:29:18.594 - 00:29:21.830, Speaker B: Oh, come. Oh, no. Compared to Aave, at least.
00:29:22.450 - 00:29:46.180, Speaker A: Okay, but compare, compare the amount of vault. Okay, fine. Aave sure either way. Either way. Compare the amount of volume that Aave does to their market cap versus the amount of volume that Bendao does to their market. Captain, I guarantee you that there's a pretty big discrepancy there. Abe has about a billion more in market cap than Bendao.
00:29:46.180 - 00:30:03.966, Speaker A: So about five x. Is Abe doing five x, the volume that bendao is? I would be very surprised if it was near that. I mean, it's also, I don't know, maybe that's a shitty comparison because Ave.
00:30:03.998 - 00:30:17.090, Speaker B: Has, they're doing like twelve different markets deposits and outstanding loans. Ave v two today's the twelve. Yesterday did 65 million deposited.
00:30:17.630 - 00:30:47.728, Speaker A: I have to connect my wallet to see Ave's dashboard. What kind of garbage ass, this is not like a data dashboard. This is like my dashboard. That's why. I don't know. My point being that bend down doesn't do a lot of all, like, no NFT five protocol does. I guess they are now maybe not a lot, but they're doing, they're capturing share now because they're, but if you.
00:30:47.744 - 00:30:56.690, Speaker B: Think if they can keep this, would you say the percentage of incentive, Washington, how much you get paid to borrow?
00:30:57.830 - 00:31:00.010, Speaker A: 50% APR.
00:31:04.590 - 00:31:16.054, Speaker B: If you can get that for over five years, you plan on holding your crypto punk for five years. And. But then, but what are you being.
00:31:16.102 - 00:31:21.090, Speaker A: Sustainable, like the, seeing what being sustainable.
00:31:22.870 - 00:31:27.450, Speaker B: Like the incentive timeline and being able to keep this up and just grow the.
00:31:29.190 - 00:31:53.586, Speaker A: I don't think you're really. It's not just that you're, it's not just that you're betting on the asset that you're borrowing against maintaining its value. You're also betting on bend out being a winner in the, or even close to a winner in the NFT buy space, which is so early to tell that I think. I guess they're not the worst. They're not at all the worst team to, or the worst project to bet on.
00:31:53.658 - 00:31:59.482, Speaker B: They're definitely in what they're definitely leading.
00:31:59.506 - 00:32:07.170, Speaker A: On on a five year timeline. And any like, niche, not just NFT five, like, it's a tough thing to do.
00:32:07.250 - 00:32:08.190, Speaker B: Less than five.
00:32:09.330 - 00:32:10.150, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:10.930 - 00:32:23.180, Speaker B: And also, but no, I. You get like a little snack whenever. How they unlock. Literally. Oh, my God. Literally. You get like a little, you get a skimp a little bit off of it.
00:32:23.180 - 00:32:37.336, Speaker B: I think it keeps people at least interested in maybe not the whole five years, but maybe people rotated it in and out, borrowing. I wonder what the incentivization is for lending eth.
00:32:37.408 - 00:32:42.260, Speaker A: I don't think they're giving tokens for that, that would be.
00:32:46.400 - 00:32:53.832, Speaker B: No. They're giving only four and a half percent. Five in east and four and a half and bend.
00:32:53.976 - 00:32:57.580, Speaker A: Now that's not crazy. 10%.
00:32:57.920 - 00:33:06.136, Speaker B: They have 91,000 Ethan reserve. That's a shit tonight.
00:33:06.158 - 00:33:08.412, Speaker A: Wonder how Spice is doing out their rates.
00:33:08.596 - 00:33:16.252, Speaker B: I think. I don't think that's the worst tokenomic mechanism that they could have done. I'm not really mad at it.
00:33:16.276 - 00:33:19.204, Speaker A: No. They're getting volume. Doing a damn good job.
00:33:19.252 - 00:33:20.324, Speaker B: It seems like it's working.
00:33:20.412 - 00:33:38.190, Speaker A: I don't think it's bad at all. Yeah. I just wonder how that's going to perform. As MTP has a competitive space. No one. It's nobody's game to lose yet. Nobody really has it figured out by the means.
00:33:41.770 - 00:33:58.390, Speaker B: There's a 18,000 Ethan JPEG in comparison between. Since they're both peer to pool. I don't get. Why is JPeg not incentivizing with their JPeg token JPeg?
00:33:59.530 - 00:34:06.110, Speaker A: I don't know. Based off of them doing no volumes, JPM says goodness. Dead at this point, maybe even.
00:34:07.850 - 00:34:11.426, Speaker B: Oh, no, I wouldn't put them as good as dead. I think they have a chance.
00:34:11.618 - 00:34:22.762, Speaker A: I saw this. This is, like, totally unrelated, but I saw this protocol on the influencer tool that's like, you can lock up your snake beef for x amount of days and you just.
00:34:22.786 - 00:34:26.250, Speaker B: Oh, and get the ETH in advance. Yeah, yeah.
00:34:27.070 - 00:34:28.570, Speaker A: I've seen a lot of.
00:34:29.390 - 00:34:52.570, Speaker B: I feel like. You wanna explain how that would work? Because I feel like I. If everyone does that and rates don't stay where the protocol wants them to be, isn't there a way that they lose out? Because rates are not gonna stay the same? So you have to really undershoot them because it all depends on, like, validators and shit. Right?
00:34:52.990 - 00:34:53.646, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:53.758 - 00:34:54.198, Speaker B: Like, how much?
00:34:54.214 - 00:35:04.238, Speaker A: But I don't think rates are ease that. I don't think rates are that volatile, are they? It's not like they change significantly day to day, week to week.
00:35:04.374 - 00:35:29.488, Speaker B: No, but I think there's a lot of. I don't know. I didn't really look into this protocol enough, but I don't know. Are they live? They're not live yet, are they? No, they're not. Yeah, but, like, in three days, see, I don't know if I would launch pre, like, withdraws because that's when you'll. Withdraws are not going to be like, everyone withdraws at once. There's going to be a queue or whatever.
00:35:29.488 - 00:35:44.620, Speaker B: So it's not going to be a crazy change. But I feel like I would wait and see what withdraws look like before launching something like that and seeing how rates change, because I feel like we don't know how much rates are going to actually change.
00:35:45.240 - 00:36:12.432, Speaker A: So you lock up your stake deed. If stake Deeth is minted and swapped for your stake deeds, you get your rewards right up front. When you receive your stake deeds upfront yield, you give up the rights to your future yield. Those rights are transferred to the F stake ETH holders because they're the counterparty, taking the risk to reward of interest rate volatility. Does that mean this is also.
00:36:12.576 - 00:36:20.728, Speaker B: This also has to be insanely liquid for. This is a way to kind of, like. This is a way to speculate on what?
00:36:20.784 - 00:36:39.870, Speaker A: On interest rates? A way to speculate on, like, the stake rate of ethereum. Because you can. Yeah, if you think it's going to go down, you can just take your upfront rewards and be fine with it, and you'll make more than you can lock in a certain rate at a given day. Essentially, if you think it's gonna go up, you can.
00:36:40.650 - 00:36:42.270, Speaker B: What's the protocol?
00:36:42.570 - 00:36:58.150, Speaker A: F sticky. Lido. F lido. Oh, yeah. In addition to trading fees, lP's special clinical.
00:37:01.090 - 00:37:05.662, Speaker B: Wait, am I looking at the right thing? This is a taser.
00:37:05.726 - 00:37:21.630, Speaker A: F lido. Five on Twitter. Up front, yield on sticky. Oh, there's a. There's also flash. Take the only account they're following.
00:37:21.750 - 00:37:25.210, Speaker B: 15% APY competitor.
00:37:27.150 - 00:37:28.250, Speaker A: Wait, yeah.
00:37:28.830 - 00:37:31.530, Speaker B: 15% APY does not make sense.
00:37:32.850 - 00:37:34.710, Speaker A: How do they do that sustainably?
00:37:37.330 - 00:38:09.190, Speaker B: They're doing some other shit. There's no way they're just staking with Lido and giving you 15% upfront. What? How much liquidity is going to come with it? For first users, Lido is powered by combining the liquid staking powers of lido with instant upfront yields, abilities of the flash stake protocol. These guys are already doing it. Claim up to two years worth of yield today created by block zero.
00:38:11.730 - 00:38:18.550, Speaker A: Portion of your upfront yield. What? How are they setting this up 15%?
00:38:19.250 - 00:38:34.176, Speaker B: Oh, they're using trading fees. So every time you trade your. Every time you trade your PE for FDA st eth, the holders of FST eth get the trading fees.
00:38:34.208 - 00:38:39.336, Speaker A: But how are they funding the fit? How are they setting it up 15% from day one? They can't.
00:38:39.408 - 00:38:44.648, Speaker B: I think they're expecting a bunch of people to trade from F Ste to Steve.
00:38:44.704 - 00:38:48.968, Speaker A: So they're. They're funding alleged upfront staking?
00:38:49.064 - 00:39:15.850, Speaker B: I don't know how they're doing that up front. I can't answer that. Question someone, some fund or some angel. I don't know why you would take that deal. One of the devs tweeted, give me a loan for 15% and I'll pay you 3.75% monthly. Zero risk.
00:39:17.270 - 00:39:22.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that tweet. Get the joke he was trying to make?
00:39:22.720 - 00:39:43.740, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't get it. In addition to trading fees, lP's are eligible for additional liquidity mining rewards in the form of flash. Good luck to them. I don't see that happening. But if we open up the website and you can actually take 15% upfront, I don't see why that would be a bad idea. 90 days to.
00:39:44.120 - 00:39:49.300, Speaker A: I guess you can pay it off immediately, but I wouldn't if I'm paying it off at 15%.
00:39:49.640 - 00:39:50.384, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:39:50.472 - 00:39:51.656, Speaker A: Maybe. I don't know.
00:39:51.728 - 00:39:53.620, Speaker B: There's Defi for innovation.
00:39:54.600 - 00:39:59.288, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. Defies been innovating, just not. Not enough.
00:39:59.424 - 00:40:00.368, Speaker B: We should bring in more.
00:40:00.424 - 00:40:05.860, Speaker A: A lot of, like, incremental. There's been a lot of incremental innovations, I think, but none.
00:40:06.320 - 00:40:12.048, Speaker B: Anything you want to. Anything you're proud about being an X Defi guy?
00:40:12.144 - 00:40:16.136, Speaker A: I don't really touch defi anymore, to be honest, but that's what I'm saying.
00:40:16.168 - 00:40:19.296, Speaker B: I haven't even seen much of this innovation you speak of.
00:40:19.368 - 00:40:36.120, Speaker A: It's been like incremental shit. There was. There was some protocol in Solana where they. They found a way to be really capital efficient. I remember half exactly, but they were doing like. Yeah, I see that there are some very little TVL. It's just been like.
00:40:36.160 - 00:40:40.798, Speaker B: It's just been like little innovations in capital efficiency. Yeah, yeah, I've seen those.
00:40:40.854 - 00:40:41.398, Speaker A: Which is like.
00:40:41.454 - 00:40:45.078, Speaker B: I also don't know how those work, but, yeah, they are significant.
00:40:45.214 - 00:41:00.454, Speaker A: GMX redacted, all these real yield things. What else? Let's go to defi llama. You got the maker RWA stuff. I don't really want to call that a win just yet, but you got that. You got fracks. Frack ships like a motherfucker.
00:41:00.542 - 00:41:10.050, Speaker B: Oh, speaking of staking, did you see the whole. I don't. I know you don't like to get into regulation, but did you read that, like, choke point article?
00:41:12.380 - 00:41:18.428, Speaker A: I heard the news about, like, cracking. Staking. Cracking likes, not offering staking anymore or something like that.
00:41:18.484 - 00:42:30.150, Speaker B: Yeah. The TLDR is basically that in 2012, the Obama administration basically convinced banks just by sending memos, to not allow online poker to be banked inklings, that they're doing the same thing with crypto. They've been sending out these memos basically saying crypto is not a safe and sound like way to bank and you're pulling this kind of risk into other assets that you shouldn't be doing. They didn't take it to Congress and ban it, but they've just been like sending out these memos and a lot of it's like that choke point of the on and off ramp between crypto and banks. And the part I'm curious about is not your take on the regulation, but maybe we see some kind of innovation in the on and off ramp part of things that's. I feel like that's more useful to focus on. Curious what you think about that area of crypto on and off ramps.
00:42:30.150 - 00:42:49.642, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you think there's a chance that you stay here if you have to like go on some forum and meet up with some guy to get cash for your ethereum? Cuz that's if the on and off ramps die and like, they get killed through this choke point thing. That's what people are kind of disgusting they go back to. You think so?
00:42:49.826 - 00:42:54.204, Speaker A: But like, by and large, like a lot of activity.
00:42:54.252 - 00:43:00.196, Speaker B: Just see the US thing. The US thing. So. Fuck.
00:43:00.228 - 00:43:00.748, Speaker A: I didn't mute.
00:43:00.804 - 00:43:01.580, Speaker B: Bless you.
00:43:01.740 - 00:43:02.940, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead. Thank you.
00:43:03.020 - 00:43:14.360, Speaker B: If it dies. If it dies in the US. Right. On and off ramps. Do you think there's hope? You're an international focus guy. I feel like you have less to worry about.
00:43:15.780 - 00:43:42.080, Speaker A: Maybe I'm still a us citizen, but I think no matter what, it's a long and tough road to recovery. If something like that happens, like, it's. There's not a lot that. I don't know, I think that crypto is. It's obvious crypto isn't like an overly, like, american thing. Like, it's not like there's a larger subset of users in America than anyone else. It's still, like America.
00:43:42.080 - 00:43:48.160, Speaker A: Like, it still dictates the direction and future of this stuff because some people.
00:43:48.200 - 00:44:16.960, Speaker B: Were mentioning the fact that, like, small projects and, like, it was already hard for them to get any kind of banking and now it's going to be even harder. So, like, people in the VC space, we're talking of, like, how hard and how much that kind of limits them. And I didn't really. I mean, I feel like everyone in the VC space just gets like USDC sent to their address. Yeah. Like on and off rank for that.
00:44:17.640 - 00:44:19.880, Speaker A: Not a lot of them are domiciled in the US, though.
00:44:19.960 - 00:44:22.072, Speaker B: Yeah, it's.
00:44:22.136 - 00:44:22.840, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:44:22.960 - 00:44:27.472, Speaker B: You think it's like an overrated worry or do you think it's something.
00:44:27.536 - 00:44:47.026, Speaker A: No. What's your shit like this always moves slow. I think off ramp. On off ramps in their current state obviously won't or shouldn't exist the way they do years from now. But it is what it is. They have to shitty, but like we have to use them. Obviously.
00:44:47.026 - 00:45:23.182, Speaker A: There's, I think there's an argument to be made that if there's an effort to stifle them in their current state in the US, that could hurry along. Other solutions that are more compliant or like kind of circumvent that in some way, maybe, I don't know. It's either like enough economies live on chain that on and off ramps don't matter that much. If we have really good payment rails, why would you need to be off ramping super often? Or we have like smooth enough ramps to the point where. To the point where economies don't need to live on change on chain to that extent.
00:45:23.366 - 00:45:24.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's.
00:45:24.230 - 00:45:28.170, Speaker A: And either one feasible, I think regardless of what happens, like in the US.
00:45:30.070 - 00:46:03.550, Speaker B: I think people forgot about the payment rails once I did, once Ust died. And like, I remember people were talking about Ust being accepted and like, like credit card machines. Yeah, yeah. I think that idea or sentiment or. I haven't seen much of that recently, but that's a good, that's a good point. If they can flush out the payment rails and I can walk into whatever store and just use my mobile wallet to buy something, then, yeah, the on and off ramps become less, less useful.
00:46:04.010 - 00:46:15.528, Speaker A: Accessory payment solutions, to be honest. There's good, there's better solutions out there that are building, but none of them have been, have like blown me away.
00:46:15.704 - 00:46:22.140, Speaker B: Have you witnessed anyone in Argentina, don't they use bitcoin? A bit.
00:46:22.760 - 00:47:06.770, Speaker A: Have you seen, I haven't seen it personally, but I've heard of it. Not in Argentina, but it's like, I've heard like a friend of a friend, like one of those type of situations where not, it's not like people buying like groceries with bitcoin. It's more so, yeah, it's more so like larger purchases because jewelry, cars. Why would they buy, yeah, yeah. Why would they buy that stuff in pesos when it's gonna be down 10% in two weeks? So it's there, but it's not, it's not like the infrastructure is there. It's more so that the need is there so that, and like anyone can transact bitcoin or anyone can transact most crypto, so that's yeah. That's what makes it feasible.
00:47:06.770 - 00:47:08.590, Speaker A: It's just like handshake agreements.
00:47:09.810 - 00:47:38.800, Speaker B: Yeah. And last but not least, I just want to throw the ZK narrative in the air. Me personally, I was. I spent some time this week hearing about, like, ZK sync, and because they seem like the most far along, I like, like, just off logos and name. I don't like ZK sync. I like scroll because I think their logo and name is cooler. I.
00:47:38.800 - 00:48:43.910, Speaker B: In terms of ZkevM umbrella, I'd put scroll previously as, like, the one I thought was the coolest one, and then ZK sync and then whatever Polygon is doing with, because it starts with an h, but I forget what it is. But I listened to a bit about ZK sync and what they were doing, and they seem to be coming up with something pretty cool. I don't know if a lot of people, I feel like not many people listen to their talk, but this dude was talking, like, he was talking layer threes too. He's. Yeah, we've been talking to, like, huge brands and, like, they've been hiring crypto teams and, like, they're well versed in the space and they're. They know that Ethereum is like, the one that they're going to choose as their quote unquote, layer three, like, app chain play, enterprise, chain place. And they're launching with like, 150 projects, 160 projects protocols ready to go.
00:48:43.910 - 00:49:07.700, Speaker B: And they are the. They had said they have a few, like, a bunch in stealth that are gonna launch on Zksync and then maybe add other chains. But I thought they were. Their ethos is a lot better than I thought it was from the beginning. So I was curious what your zk zk Evm take is.
00:49:08.440 - 00:49:09.780, Speaker A: Do you think it's worth.
00:49:12.050 - 00:49:15.410, Speaker B: I think it is worth what? Like, do you think it's worth trying.
00:49:15.450 - 00:50:12.574, Speaker A: To evaluate those, like, given that the tech is still so early and doesn't work and obviously there's all these different ideas as to how to implement it and. No, but what to prioritize throughout that process. There's still. And just because we can't properly look at that stuff and come to a reasonable conclusion, is it worth looking at, like, brand, like, bb? The stuff that we can, like, analyze isn't even worth doing that. Are we gonna get anything from that? I would say there is if there's something to, like, speculate on there, but there's not really yet, I guess, unless you want to weight your attention in one direction or not. But even then, it's like, why like, why try and pick a winner this early in my mind? Like, I was, I've actually heard that Polygon or Mez is like the far so long by quite a decent margin. Like, they should be on main net within the next three or four months.
00:50:12.702 - 00:50:50.160, Speaker B: Yeah, but they're not. The reason I like ZK sync, and I think it's because, or from this talk, what I liked about this talk, I haven't, like you said, I haven't picked a winner necessarily. I'm more focused on the narrative itself because it seems like they're all trying to become. I mean, there was like, what, three months ago, four months ago when they were all declaring that they were the first on testnet. Like, they're gonna do the same thing all over again and then. But when it comes to launch, it's gonna be, I think, quite bigger. And I think the target is Eth Denver, and I think it's East Denver for a lot of them, which is at the end of this month.
00:50:50.160 - 00:51:34.290, Speaker B: And I feel like it could be a significant narrative trade. I think I've seen a. A few people already talking about it on Twitter. And last time we saw people talking about AI on Twitter, we saw people talking about LSD's on Twitter. We saw people talking about what else? I mean, we watched GNS right in front of our face when it was, like, quite obvious. And I don't think it's about picking winners. I think it's like riding the narrative, and I think Eth Denver, the ZK narrative forms, and I think it's a lot more long lasting than these other narrative.
00:51:34.990 - 00:52:03.400, Speaker A: My point is that, like, what we can do with regards to those narratives for this one specifically is completely different. It's not like we can go and buy z 50, get specific exposure to that ecosystem or to scroll or aztec or whatever, unless the ones that do have tokens are, like, not the ones that people generally see as winners or talk about. There's not many. I can't name Mina polygon, I guess I. Polygons always goodbye, though.
00:52:05.140 - 00:52:08.436, Speaker B: They have loop, ring, loop, ring, loop, ring.
00:52:08.468 - 00:52:34.226, Speaker A: You got loops? Yeah, but my point is. My point is for all the ones that are going to be, for all the big names, I think, and all the ones that are gonna be leaders in a proper, like, ZK run. There's nothing we can do right now. Besides, we can try whatever to get. Yeah, but that's not. That's. There's no way to scale to your exposure there.
00:52:34.226 - 00:52:50.660, Speaker A: Like, you, unless you want to go run a validator on Zksync or something like that. Like, then, you know, by all means, try and figure out which one is the best to go do that on. But we're not those people. Most people aren't a like that. So I don't know.
00:52:52.200 - 00:52:54.180, Speaker B: There's nowhere for us to speculate.
00:52:54.880 - 00:52:55.620, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:57.800 - 00:53:25.806, Speaker B: Yeah. But who knows? I feel like finding out some of the aspects of each one before they announce their token makes it easier to evaluate when they do. Or even figuring out which one's the most secure. And like, deploying liquidity there. Whenever these are apps start incentivizing it. I feel like maybe those are the places to do that we could. That we could target.
00:53:25.806 - 00:54:09.784, Speaker B: They are launching with 150 apps and they're completely, they're making it completely open source. They're getting like multiple layers of audits. Like, just the way this guy was talking about it. I felt like it was the arbitrum of the optimistic ones, optimistic roll ups. Whereas, because, like, starkware, it seems like they're not going to get anywhere because they're not EVM compatible. Like something like starkware or like fuel seems like way far out because EVM seems like the only thing that people and developers to move quickly to. But I think ZK.
00:54:09.784 - 00:54:20.560, Speaker B: EVM specifically is a play that we can get into sooner rather than later. I'm just gonna keep an eye on Ethan. I think that's like my. What my next step is.
00:54:21.100 - 00:54:21.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:23.220 - 00:54:43.190, Speaker B: And see what. What happens there and then who knows? And maybe matic is worth picking up pre that. Probably gonna. I don't know. I don't like matic. I'm gonna be honest, I don't. I think the whole bd stick.
00:54:43.190 - 00:55:24.154, Speaker B: I think the whole bd stick, like, only takes you so far. I feel like they're trying like the whole, like, being like the Google or like the Facebook of the industry where they do so many different things and like, they so much money and there's so many different aspects of it. It's like, I'd rather place my bet on someone. If I could put a token, like, if the tokens were out, I'd bet on CKC way before I bet on the Hermes. I put scroll before that too. Because it's just like focusing on one thing. I feel like works out more than trying to do a million different things.
00:55:24.154 - 00:55:34.620, Speaker B: Because also I do remember maybe this was just fud that I was eating up, but I. People talking about the, like, matic chain, like maxing out during the last bull run.
00:55:35.640 - 00:55:36.984, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, like from.
00:55:37.032 - 00:55:45.784, Speaker B: I guess they were like, logging up like, there. It's not that good. I think. I don't like it.
00:55:45.872 - 00:55:57.652, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think. I don't think that Matic is, like a good chain or like a winner in any, from tech or, like, usability perspective. I just think it's a good buy most of the time. Like, I was talking to, I think.
00:55:57.676 - 00:56:02.280, Speaker B: The b, I think the BD, a lot of the BD is, like, hot air. I'm gonna be honest.
00:56:03.620 - 00:56:35.518, Speaker A: I think that a lot of people there don't even realize, like, what their success is attributed to. Like, I was talking to someone who's, like, pretty high up there and I was asking him, what, like, how do you guys do it? How do you just pump out partnership after partnership after with just titans and, like, the real world? And he's, oh, I think it's, I think it's a combination of having a strong product team and having the best, the best resource from a tech perspective. And I'm like, yeah, that's, like, totally not true, though. You know that, right?
00:56:35.574 - 00:56:36.502, Speaker B: Not true at all.
00:56:36.566 - 00:56:51.450, Speaker A: And he's like, oh, yes. I don't know. What kind of an answer is that? Dude, you're the head of something at Matic and, like, you barely even know what's going on. Are they just falling upwards? I don't know. I don't know.
00:56:51.990 - 00:57:37.290, Speaker B: Wait, is it polygon? Is it polygon or optimism that has that Reddit NFT thing polygon? I think, yeah, like, that. That to me is like bullshit. Having trillion people mint a free NFT and just do nothing with it doesn't mean anything. I've seen, I see so many. There's one dev that works at Polygon that flexes that on, like, his Twitter, like, every single day because there was, like, a Super bowl specific NFT from Reddit. I'm like, yeah, that's cool. But, and I'm sure when that BD deal came along, I don't remember exactly when that came along, but I'm sure it pumped the token, like, God knows how much percent and, yeah, that just seems like hot air to me.
00:57:37.290 - 00:58:01.402, Speaker B: It just seems like really not much. I'm not a Polygon fan. I will stick by it. But whether or not they announce some cool shit for ZK and it pumps the market and pumps their token, there's a whole different story. Yeah, I just, I think we keep an eye on ZK, a lot of.
00:58:01.426 - 00:58:03.170, Speaker A: Money, so I'm happy with it.
00:58:03.290 - 00:58:06.906, Speaker B: Were you part of the polygon yield farming movement?
00:58:06.978 - 00:58:07.354, Speaker A: No.
00:58:07.442 - 00:58:08.834, Speaker B: That one summer is the chain.
00:58:08.922 - 00:58:39.540, Speaker A: Actually, I've used the chain twice. Once was right after FTX when I wanted to move everything on chain. I wanted to add stake bids set on polygon. I pretty much always set on Hong Kong, but I had them on Binance and I wanted to move them on chain, so I used quick swap for that. And I've also used polygon for this trump NFT, which I guess I've used polygon. Technically, I've used opensea. So it's not like it's a, it's not like I did anything too crazy, but no, I wasn't a part of all that stuff.
00:58:41.360 - 00:58:48.600, Speaker B: Yeah, zks. I'm also sad that I missed the bear chain pump. That one really hurt. They're probably back down.
00:58:48.760 - 00:59:18.960, Speaker A: But I've been hearing, I've been hearing a lot about Gumball protocol. Apparently it's like unconfirmed they're on arbitrum right now. Apparently it's like unconfirmed that they're going to be launching on Barachain, like one of the first NFT platforms. It's like an NFT liquidity kind of platform. Apparently they're going to be launching on bear chain and they have three like kind of test collections on there, none of which have minted out yet. So that's like a decent way to get exposure there. I didn't, I looked into it and I wasn't a huge fan of the web app, so I don't, I don't know.
00:59:21.420 - 00:59:33.040, Speaker B: All right, I think that wraps it up for episode five. Yeah, good episode. Good episode. I will edit this out probably for Monday.
00:59:34.780 - 00:59:35.180, Speaker A: All right.
