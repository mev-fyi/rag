00:00:43.005 - 00:01:02.153, Speaker A: All right, good morning, everyone, and welcome back to another episode of Exit Liquidity. We are on episode 88 this week, I believe, and we've got a team we've been looking forward to chatting with for a while. We got Danny and Chad from opnet. Thanks for. Thanks for joining us, guys.
00:01:02.329 - 00:01:04.565, Speaker B: Hello. Hello. Thanks for having us on.
00:01:05.865 - 00:01:26.849, Speaker A: I. I don't remember how we first came across you guys, but I do know that a lot of the content and, like, stuff we see on socials from you guys is, like. It's like a special, like, flavor of brain rot that I feel like you like. It's just so unique. I don't know. It speaks to the soul. So I'm.
00:01:26.849 - 00:02:00.409, Speaker A: I'm really excited for this one. And, like, you know, it's one of the. It's one of those deals like. Like Bear Chain or a bunch of other examples that we've seen of, like, you know, just crazy, like, schizo community shit on the outside that you see, and then, like, actually, like, meaningful stuff at its core as well. So we have a lot to talk about, for sure. To get started, I would love to hear a little bit about who we're talking to today, kind of how you guys ended up where you are, a little bit on your backgrounds and just who you are as people. So Danny, to start out, would love to hear that from you.
00:02:00.577 - 00:02:39.635, Speaker B: Yo, I am Danny Plainview. Myself and Chad are the founders of Op Net and MotoSwap. OpNet is a meta protocol on bitcoin, kind of like the ordinal client, but instead of being made for NFTs, it's made for specifically smart contracts on bitcoin. And so, you know, the same way ordinals work, where it's just bitcoin and a bitcoin wallet. It's the same dealio for opnet, where you don't need, like, an opnet token to use smart contracts on bitcoin. And Motos Swap is the dex that we're building on top of that. It's essentially like a.
00:02:39.635 - 00:02:56.185, Speaker B: A fork of uni sushi swap with liquidity mining and V2 pooling and. Yeah, yeah, we've been in crypto. I've been in crypto for 10 years. Got into it like, middle school and then never left. It's the way it goes.
00:02:57.685 - 00:02:59.909, Speaker A: You got into crypto in middle school?
00:03:00.037 - 00:03:24.685, Speaker B: Yeah, I bought a. My buddy and I built a PC to play GTA 5 mods on. And then that same month was when, like, this was, like, December 2013. It was like when bitcoin Hit a thousand dollars the first time. And so we started mining. I think like dogecoin just came out and there's a litecoin client and then everything dumped like two months after we started and never, never left.
00:03:26.065 - 00:03:44.505, Speaker A: That is absurd. We've heard, we've heard the occasional like high school entry, but I think you might be the first person who, who got in, in middle school. Yeah, that's kind of crazy. Chad, what about you, man? What, what brought you to where you're at today?
00:03:45.725 - 00:04:28.665, Speaker C: Honestly, Danny did like, Danny and I were friends in real life for a few years prior to me entering crypto to any meaningful degree. Like, I'd bought bitcoin. I had been around with some alts and stuff, but I wasn't doing it full time by any means until really like the dead bear market. He's hit like 800 bucks after the. The really big cycle. And this dude hit me up and he was just letting me know, like, you know, if you, if you learn this now, there might be some really sick opportunities later once time really goes on and the market recovers. So I basically just hopped straight into the trenches, started trading every single day.
00:04:28.665 - 00:05:07.197, Speaker C: Two of us were trading every single day. And then, yeah, I mean, we had a lot of success doing that. And then pretty much we found bitcoin ordinals and, you know, the narrative was just too strong of like, what you can do on bitcoin if, if you're able to actually replicate everything you could do on Ethereum on bitcoin and the user experience is somewhat seamless. Like, that is right there, in my opinion, like kind of the only new ground you can really break. Like, you know, Danny and I were both super active. We had, we had. We were both really bullish on Bear chain.
00:05:07.197 - 00:06:04.705, Speaker C: We still are, but, like, both really bullish on bear chain. Most of my profits from all my trading was just being funneled straight into Bear because I think that's kind of like, at least until we found this stuff on bitcoin, this is the only place where I was really seeing any sort of like meaningful innovation happening to really push the narrative forward, especially for stuff like defi. So, you know, again, like, the chance to be able to do, to bring defi to bitcoin, a place where I think defi really could thrive. That was really like, that was, that was huge for us. So we basically went full time into this bitcoin world, jump ship on everything we were doing on ETH and everything else. And then, yeah, I mean, we've been basically in research and Development mode for almost an entire year until. Until we basically unveiled OP Net, which is sort of our throwing our hat into the ring of like, this is how you actually get all this stuff done.
00:06:04.705 - 00:06:06.505, Speaker C: Yeah, but that's.
00:06:08.045 - 00:06:24.295, Speaker D: That's super interesting. You mentioned the trading element. I think that's one of my favorite parts about crypto. It's like you talk to builders, you talk to anybody in the space. They're always around on chain. People's moods change, like good for. For better or for worse, depending on.
00:06:24.295 - 00:06:38.155, Speaker D: On if markets are red or green. But the show is called Exit Liquidity. Everyone has like a story. Love to hear your guys's story of when you were. You were Exit Liquidity amongst this journey to building up net.
00:06:39.415 - 00:07:20.679, Speaker B: Oh, many, many a time I. I had a big bag of spell, if you remember that. Yeah, I like bought it the day I was down bad in 2021 when like the crash, the first flash crash happened. And then I aped my full port into Spell the day it launched. And I held it and staked it before it, like, really pumped. And then I sold all of my spell to buy some like, rugged crypto punks derivative that was being shilled by people and totally missed the. I had like a 2 million.
00:07:20.679 - 00:07:25.327, Speaker B: What would have been a $2 million spell bag. So it's a good.
00:07:25.391 - 00:07:36.155, Speaker D: Yeah, that was. That was a good time in defi though, to be honest. All that looping, all that like random shit you could do was. Yeah, yeah, that was a good time. What about you, Chad?
00:07:36.535 - 00:07:55.819, Speaker C: I mean, the most easy and obvious one is literally our own project, which was. Which is. Which is Moto. Like it was. We, Danny and I both bought a ton of this BRC20 token. So there's a. But there's been a bunch of that's been happening on bitcoin over the course of the past year and a half, pretty much.
00:07:55.819 - 00:08:09.355, Speaker C: But the first iterance of like fungible assets on bitcoin were these things called BRC 20s. And they're not fungible assets at all. They're like NFT tokens. They suck. It's there. It's really bad tech. You can't do anything with them.
00:08:09.355 - 00:08:29.505, Speaker C: But when they first came out, they were really, really hype. And There was a BRC20 token called Oshi that was like, we're gonna build a dex on bitcoin. And Danny and I had not dug any at all into the tech. We did no due diligence. It was literally just like, the narrative is so strong here. First decks on bitcoin is gonna be huge. So we like full ported into this thing and then.
00:08:29.505 - 00:08:53.984, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, Danny like got super involved in it. He joins, he basically calls me, he's like, yo, this team isn't building anything. It's a total scam. And then we basically. Yeah, I mean that's pretty much how this whole entire thing started is we could just. We basically CTO'd that project. I mean, at the time the public didn't really know that nothing was being built.
00:08:53.984 - 00:08:58.520, Speaker C: But with Danny, Danny and I basically blasted it out to the, like, I.
00:08:58.552 - 00:09:38.941, Speaker B: Moved to France to live with this former team and I don't speak any French and they didn't really speak any English. It was like I was doing their community outreach essentially. Like I just started doing spaces and doing Twitter threads and all this kind of stuff. And then when I got out there, you know, meet them in real life when the dust kind of settled, it was like, oh man, these people aren't. Yeah, they're not building anything. So we did a, we did like a. Basically like a split of the old team and then this, this new team, literally just me and Chad, which it basically meant we were going to make a new token moto and airdrop that to all of the Oshi BRC20 holders.
00:09:38.941 - 00:10:20.157, Speaker B: And so to do that, the way BRC20s work is you can only deploy the name of a token one time. So like, you know the, the Ordi token. There's only one Ordi token that's like the contract address, right. And so the Moto token on BRC20 had already been deployed by somebody else. And the ticker, you know, like the supply was all whack and people had some already. So we ended up forking BRC20 like the back end of it and tweaking some things ourselves and we made our own or this is like our first kind of meta protocol experiment was called CBRC20, which was like a. Most BRC20 files are.
00:10:20.157 - 00:10:41.205, Speaker B: They're JSON files. It's like the ordinal itself. So this was cbor, which is like a little more compressed than JSON, Same data, and that was the moto token. So we airdropped that to all of the OSHI people and that's where the split happened. I think OSHI is like an 800k market cap now and Moto is like 55 mil. So good CTO.
00:10:41.585 - 00:11:03.195, Speaker C: We unrugged it. But hopefully when we, when I was buying that OSHI token, it was right. I was literally buying the team's bags while they were dumping it. That was a pretty bad instance of being exit liquidity. But, hey, we did something about it. You know what I'm saying? Like, you can't. You can't rug me too bad, because we're gonna come back.
00:11:04.415 - 00:11:06.111, Speaker A: That's crazy, man.
00:11:06.183 - 00:11:06.911, Speaker B: That's.
00:11:07.103 - 00:11:17.029, Speaker A: I. I can't think of. Can't think of anyone else we've had on or maybe anyone else I've heard of who. Whose exit liquidity story is also their founding story.
00:11:17.167 - 00:11:19.833, Speaker C: But we were rugged into being founders. That's straight up.
00:11:19.889 - 00:11:29.673, Speaker A: Yeah. For real. I guess if you get rugged hard enough, that's kind of the way it goes, right? You get everything dumped on you, and then all of a sudden, you know, you got. You got a new. You got a baby to take care of now.
00:11:29.729 - 00:11:47.935, Speaker C: Like, yeah, I mean, okay, like, this is the real. Is that. Dan, I have both been. We were looking for. For a long time. I think, how do we build something in this crypto world? Like, in the eth world, it made no sense for us. Like, maybe we were thinking about building something on Bear.
00:11:47.935 - 00:12:16.473, Speaker C: You know, both of us are like, builder type guys in our non crypto lives. Like, everything that I've done outside of crypto has involved, like, either starting a company or running a business or something. So, like, and we've been wanting to do that, but there just didn't seem like there was a place in crypto where, like, the ground was. Wasn't, like, already ran through. Like, okay, what are we gonna do? We're gonna build another Dex, you know, on. We're gonna build a uni fork. Like, we're gonna do this.
00:12:16.473 - 00:12:46.245, Speaker C: It's like, nothing seemed interesting, I guess, and, like, there wasn't an idea that was powerful enough for us to get off of our trader chairs and into the builder chairs. And then again, the narrative was really strong with. With bitcoin. And. And I think both Danny and I were both kind of just trying to wait around and just trade all the narratives. But it just. As time went on, it became more increasingly clear that nobody had the answer to actually get defi and bitcoin done the right way.
00:12:46.245 - 00:12:51.485, Speaker C: So, yeah, we kind of got rugged into it, but it. It sort. It was sort of the best case scenario, I think.
00:12:52.865 - 00:13:09.873, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, it definitely seems that way. Definitely. Like, super unique founding story. I love that. And I think. I think stumbling into, like, the right opportunity is something that happens frequently in this space.
00:13:09.873 - 00:13:48.165, Speaker A: I think it's happened to me and Sito plenty of times. And it's. It's a. It's a bullish thing I'm curious as to. Before we like, get too deep into opnet and motoswap, all that fun stuff. Danny, there was something you said on our last call which kind of intrigued me about, like, what kind of users you guys are looking to bring to this, like, new environment. And currently it still feels like things are a little bit siloed between what's on bitcoin right now in terms of ordinals, runes, some of the other L2s or meta protocol teams building on there and what's on the evm.
00:13:48.165 - 00:14:23.051, Speaker A: It's still a lot less similar, I think, than I would expect it to be. But, Danny, you're of the belief that or one of the things you guys are trying to do with OP Net or you're hoping to do is to bring some of those EVM users over and to start, you know, kind of bringing those two, those two together, kind of blurring that line a little bit more. Why is that? What is it like? What are the communities like on either side? How are they different? Why do you think we need more EVM people interested in this stuff?
00:14:23.203 - 00:14:44.385, Speaker B: Well, okay, like you said at the beginning of the call, like the Modo and opnet community, they're kind of schizo. You know, it's the. They're real. They're like retardio, you know, they're real out there. And in the bitcoin world, like the ordinals world of that stuff, it's pretty rare. Like, it's not. First off, the culture is like completely different than the ETH world.
00:14:44.385 - 00:14:56.245, Speaker B: It's not like copy pasta, defi, win win, pre sale kind of meta. It's more just NFT meta. A lot of people come from. A lot of the early Ordos, people come from Solana.
00:14:58.365 - 00:15:01.637, Speaker C: Like old solana, like, like $6 Solana.
00:15:01.701 - 00:15:02.197, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:02.261 - 00:15:04.525, Speaker C: Who left Solana when It was like $6.
00:15:04.645 - 00:15:36.725, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And so, yeah, when we first joined, that was like kind of what that was like our community involvement in OSHI that that old project originally was. We were just trying to like bring good culture. You know, there was like some liquidity mining that they were doing on ethics, a token on Bitcoin, and nobody understood what like a liquidity pool was or how to farm. Like, these people are completely green when it comes to defi. But they are. Yeah, they're much more like involved in NFTs and this kind of background.
00:15:36.725 - 00:16:23.649, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it's. We really want to bring EVM users, but more so is like EVM devs, because right now, in. In the bitcoin world, there's no smart contracts really. You know, like bitcoin has script and there's tap script, but it's not like, you know, complex kinds of smart contracts like you have on the EVM or solidity. And so when you have like EVM devs, they look at bitcoin, they're like, there's nothing for me to do here. Especially if you're a defi dev, you're a money dev, basically, right? So if all your choices on bitcoin are just ordinals and runes and BRC 20s, there's not really much money development for you to do as a dev. You can just kind of, you know, there's UIs to make and websites and minting sites and things like that.
00:16:23.649 - 00:16:44.485, Speaker B: But past that, there's not a lot of complex stuff. So we want to bring a smart contract platform to bitcoin which kind of, you know, brings the masses of. There's more solidity devs in crypto than any other kind of dev. So we should kind of give those guys an angle to come into bitcoin and kind of up. Yeah.
00:16:46.225 - 00:17:14.773, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I think, I think it'd be useful because I just to, like, set a little bit of context for this episode. I would imagine that, like, most of our audience has not heard of a lot of this stuff. You know, they've probably heard of ordinals. They were probably familiar with runes, like into the Happening and stuff like that. But I think there's definitely like a gap that we're trying to fill here that I think needs to be filled in the long run. Can you.
00:17:14.773 - 00:17:30.885, Speaker A: So you keep saying, like bringing. Bringing smart contracts to bitcoin, bringing additional functionality, defi. Whatever it might be. What's there right now, like, what is. What is the. What can you go and do on bitcoin that is like, somewhat interesting as of right now.
00:17:31.045 - 00:17:41.897, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I can. You. You want me to. Want me to answer? So basically I. I just for. I'll give the crash course to anyone who's been in the eth world. And again, d.
00:17:41.897 - 00:17:58.725, Speaker C: I come from that world. So, you know, we've been in this bitcoin world since the beginning of ordinals, but it could be really confusing just from the. From the. From the jump, right? Everyone knows ordinals are Bitcoin NFTs, but like, how. Why. Whatever, right? I'll give you the full crash course. So this is how it went.
00:17:58.725 - 00:18:48.609, Speaker C: You can put data into bitcoin blocks, right? You can just stuff data into arbitrary data fields, into bitcoin blocks. This is something you've been able to do for a decent amount of time. This guy named Casey made this protocol called Ordinals. Functionally, the way it works is you put metadata for JPEGs in a Bitcoin block and then off chain. He's got something that is reading the bitcoin blockchain for this specific syntax, like this, the specific format of information. And he's looking through the bitcoin blocks and if you have submitted metadata for a JPEG in that format, it tracks it and puts it in an off chain database. In that off chain database, you basically can be assigned ownership of these images that you're putting on chain.
00:18:48.609 - 00:19:18.897, Speaker C: So that's what the. That's what ordinals are, it's Bitcoin NFTs. But really what it is is you're putting data into bitcoin blocks off chain. You have something looking at the bitcoin blocks and assigning you ownership of this data. There's a few more extra complications in terms of SAT tracking and rarity of sats, but fundamentally it's like everything's happening off chain. It's completely based off of this one guy's design. And then fast forward a little bit.
00:19:18.897 - 00:20:11.449, Speaker C: There was this thing called BRC 20s, which BRC 20s was basically a secondary syntax that was five lines of JSON that was like, here's my token, it's called already, here's my supply, it's 21 million, here's the mint limits, it's 1,000 or whatever, right? And so you can make an ordinals inscription that has the secondary syntax and then make another off chain indexer that's indexing the indexer, which is indexing bitcoin. So you're multiple layers off chain now. And that is what BRC 20s are. So BRC 20s are just NFTs that say the same thing, right? And so that's why they're like tokens. But there's not token contracts, there's no extra functionality. You trade them like NFTs, they don't work like tokens. So to a lot of people, I think people were like, oh, this is going to be the future, baby.
00:20:11.449 - 00:20:39.659, Speaker C: Like, this is sort of the narrative that we saw was defi and Bitcoin's coming. It's starting with NFTs, it's going to evolve in reverse. It's going to be NFTs and coins, then. Then defi, right? But we got stuck with coins because the coins aren't actual coins. They're like NFTs also. Still. Fast forward even further, you get runes, right? And fundamentally, runes are also basically the same thing as BRC20.
00:20:39.659 - 00:21:05.519, Speaker C: The biggest difference is this guy who made the ordinal protocol was really pissed because he made the ordinal protocol to be like, he wanted a database full of art, right? And then people just spammed it and filled it up with five lines of JSON for coins. So he was like this. He doesn't make any money off of it. So he was like this. I'm making my own thing called Runes. And Runes is. It's basically the same thing.
00:21:05.519 - 00:21:26.945, Speaker C: It's just like a different database. So you have the same limitations. Pretty much. It's still a terrible user experience, but it's in a different database. And a bunch of people who didn't understand runes hyped runes up to be something that it just completely wasn't. And I think a lot of people got burned. I mean, Danny and I were kind of ringing the alarm bells about runes for a while.
00:21:26.945 - 00:21:39.221, Speaker C: We still lost money on them. So, you know, we were like. We were like, this is going to be horrible. Everyone, you know, this is not going to be smart contracts on Bitcoin. There's not going to be coins on Bitcoin. It's not going to be anything anyone thinks it is. And we still ended up losing money on it.
00:21:39.221 - 00:22:12.773, Speaker C: So, you know, it's like, it was pretty much a horrible protocol from the ground up. You can't do anything with these assets, which is the biggest problem, right? Like, even if you were making. If I was to just design my ideal meme coin casino, let's just say, right, Like, I would have the ability to trade these tokens liquidly on chain, right? Or, like, make permissionless liquidity pools and be able to, like, actually trade. Like, look at Solana. Solana is pretty much the ideal meme coin casino. So nothing works like that on Bitcoin yet. And so, you know, if you've.
00:22:12.773 - 00:22:37.625, Speaker C: If you're a listener and you've looked at stuff happening on Bitcoin and been like, I've got no clue what's going on over there. I'm fading that you probably were right to do so because there pretty much hasn't been anything. There's been a few chances to make a lot of money, but overall, it's been a lot of. A lot of. It's been a lot. I mean, we've been in the trenches kind of trying to experiment. How do we get this to look and feel like normal Right.
00:22:37.625 - 00:23:04.425, Speaker C: Normal to us is Eth or Solana. So how do we get this to look and feel like this? Obviously you're going to be constrained by Bitcoin block times, but aside from that, how do you make everything else, from the dev experience to the user experience, how do you make that actually feel like normal? And that's where we came to the idea of OP Net, which, I mean, I could pass off to Danny. That's sort of the speed run tldr half of shit on Bitcoin.
00:23:04.765 - 00:23:54.581, Speaker D: The one area that I like what you did, we kind of jumped onto all the buzzwords that I feel like I've heard living in Ethan and other lands from the bitcoin world. The one area that I feel like you didn't touch on was the Bitcoin L2 or the Bitcoin side chain. For people that don't know, like myself, I have a weird understanding. I have a normal understanding of what L2s are from, like an Ethereum perspective, but from the little. I know it's a little bit different on Bitcoin. It's sort of not the same thing. So what's happening with those and what is the experience like on them? And how will that differ or be.
00:23:54.613 - 00:24:43.615, Speaker B: Similar to options the Bitcoin L2s are like, the term L2 technically goes out the window, basically. It's like, no, there's no proofs being posted to Bitcoin after things happen. Like, basically the way that 90% of these L2s work is they use like Polygon Edge and then you send them Bitcoin and they make a wrapped Bitcoin as their gas token or they have, you know, a governance token, kind of like how optimism is. And then you basically have to go from using a Bitcoin wallet with Bitcoin to using Metamask, an eth address. And, you know, all of your apps are completely different. There's no Unisat is like the biggest app in the bitcoin world where people trade tokens. When you go into Bitcoin L2, you're just using like a Unis swap fork or something like this.
00:24:43.615 - 00:25:00.249, Speaker B: And it just doesn't really feel like an L2 either. Like, the technical stuff is not an L2 at all. And to the user, you know, I have to switch my wallet, I switch my address type, I switch all my apps. That doesn't really feel like an L2. It just feels like I just bridged eth. Right, right.
00:25:00.377 - 00:25:37.875, Speaker C: Well, okay, like, what's the purpose of an L2 in the first Place for one, in Bitcoin's current state, you can't actually make a real Bitcoin L2. It doesn't exist. Right? Like you don't have any programmability, there's no ability to post proofs, there's no roll ups or anything like that. So. And there's no trustless bridging, so there's no actual real way to do a real L2. So technically these are semantically correct, they're called sidechains, but really they're not linked to Bitcoin at all. It's just like, it's like calling Ethereum an L2 for Bitcoin because I can use Rap WBTC on it, you know, that's pretty much the, the extent of this abstraction here.
00:25:37.875 - 00:25:40.795, Speaker C: I think that a lot of these.
00:25:41.615 - 00:25:43.719, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry I cut you.
00:25:43.847 - 00:26:16.529, Speaker C: A lot of these have raised a ton of VC capital because venture capital is super, super on Bitcoin. Like the narrative of bitcoin, the narrative of bitcoin defi all this stuff. Like we're going to tap into a trillion dollars that's never been touched before. Like this is the thing that everyone is thinking about, right? But like I think that a lot what the thing a lot of people miss, I think is two things. One, that trillion dollars, have you ever talked to one of these people who's never moved their money off of bitcoin? They're never going to move the money off of bitcoin. They're not going to. They could go to Ethereum.
00:26:16.529 - 00:26:51.171, Speaker C: They don't. Right. They think eth is a shitcoin. So we're not talking about people who are willing to just bridge to wherever because a big VC funded it. That's not the profile of user you're actually trying to tap into here. Secondarily, there's no function on Bitcoin layer 1. So a lot of these L2s are trying to address basic functionality of Bitcoin layer 1 without, you know, they're jumping to scale, they're jumping to the completely shunting all functionality to some other layer.
00:26:51.171 - 00:27:19.185, Speaker C: When it's like what is the reason why you want L2 on Ethereum? Scalability. It's not like you can do so much. It's not like you have so many more new functions on any of these L2s. You just have it faster and cheaper. But you get a similar experience to layer one with bit with Bitcoin because it's hard and there's not really a immediate financial incentive to do it. No one is attacking functionality on layer One. Right.
00:27:19.185 - 00:27:28.625, Speaker C: Everyone's just saying, oh, okay, I could raise, you know, $20 million by making a completely new blockchain and just saying I'm using bitcoin somehow.
00:27:28.665 - 00:27:32.857, Speaker B: Well, they are using L1. It's just not to do anything smart. Like.
00:27:32.961 - 00:27:33.593, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:27:33.649 - 00:28:01.375, Speaker B: Just to clarify, like ordinals, runes, all of these things exist on the Bitcoin L1. Like, these are all the term we use is meta protocol. So you have bitcoin, which is the base protocol, and you have something on top of it. That's what ordinals, you know, BRC 20s even are. Like, technically, BRC 20 is a meta meta protocol because it's, you know, two layers off chain. And so, yeah, people are doing stuff on the L1. It's just not focused on programmability.
00:28:01.375 - 00:28:50.553, Speaker B: It's much more focused on like this NFT aspect that's a lot easier. Like, yeah, you can use this. Basically, ordinals work by serializing bitcoin like you would a dollar bill where, you know, you have the first bitcoin ever mined. We're going to split that into units of satoshis, which is like, you know, 1/100 millionth of a bitcoin, and then track, you know, that satoshi. It's a fake thing that is being indexed off chain. But it's very easy, you know, to build on top of that concept that there's not a lot of programmability. So people have been shunting the kind of programmability experiments onto these L2s, which doesn't really make it feel like anything new or special because it's just like again, Polygon Edge using wrap bitcoin as a gas token.
00:28:50.553 - 00:29:06.185, Speaker B: So the OP Net, just again, to clarify, is existing purely on the L1. You don't have to bridge anywhere to use OP Net. Like you just have a bitcoin wallet and bitcoin and then you can do pretty much whatever you want with opnet.
00:29:09.645 - 00:29:37.995, Speaker A: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I think that's definitely useful context. I think the space is very different from what we're used to. Right. Because I like the way that Chad put it in that it's not, you know, we're not just trying to make things faster and more scalable. There's additional functionality that still needs to be introduced, which is like a whole different type of, type of scaling that we're not used to seeing on the evm.
00:29:37.995 - 00:30:31.215, Speaker A: So now that we're like, at that point, or at least like, you know, you guys have launched on Testnet, I believe, and now you're kind of starting to gain more traction, starting to you know, put yourself out there more. I'm curious as to how you're looking to like position relative to the rest of like the crypto defi space specifically. I'm interested in hearing more about like you guys use the term slow. I think that's, I think that that's something that's definitely like very unique. First of all, it's not something that has really ever been like discuss for what it is nor for like the way it's being done. You know, everything is always so much of crypto is just about like speed and scalability. Everybody's always throwing around TPS numbers, time to finality, whatever.
00:30:31.215 - 00:30:51.915, Speaker A: And we're just trying to do what ETH or salon or whoever else did, but faster in a more secure way. But then you guys come in and you're like no, like this is slow fi like we don't need to be faster necessarily. Can you explain like first of all what that means and why that's important?
00:30:52.535 - 00:31:24.019, Speaker B: Yeah, well like think, think about the real world is how I would first start is like if I wanted right now to physically buy a kilogram of gold, it's. I'm going to have to kyc with my bank. I'm going up to KYC with the company I'm buying the gold from. They're going to have to ship the gold to me. My payment has to clear. Like it's going to take probably five days for me to physically receive my kilo of gold or even to buy a house or even send a wire transfer. Like these things in real life, Real life finance is slow.
00:31:24.019 - 00:32:00.149, Speaker B: It's not very fast. And you can even look at like ETH also where during the bull market eth was not very fast nor was it cheap. Like it was very expensive. I remember like trading om forks, right? I was paying like 0.2 ETH to swap on Uniswap on Ethereum just to make my trade. And that was just kind of the way it went. And then EIP 1559 happened and it's kind of funny because you can look at the defi charts of tokens and they kind of all fell apart very quickly after Ethereum became faster and cheaper.
00:32:00.149 - 00:33:04.371, Speaker B: And the meta in crypto, yeah, it's been like very, very focused on speed and scalability in the smart contract side of things. But Bitcoin, which is still, you know, to this day over 50% of the entire crypto market cap, there's no focus on speed or scalability really on the side of Bitcoin. So like opening up defi onto a slow chain a like Ponzi tend to work out a lot better in a slow environment. Like what? Why is there no defi on Solana and it's only meme coins? Well, because if you launch a staking protocol that everyone is, you know, getting claimable rewards every block. If you do that on something like Solana, Every single second, 100,000 people can all claim their rewards and sell them the next second. Basically your staking Ponzi are going to fall apart right away versus, you know, a slower environment, especially something like Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only handle 6,000 transactions every 10 minutes like that.
00:33:04.371 - 00:33:53.757, Speaker B: That's not a lot of time at all, especially for a $1.2 trillion blockchain. But when you have like defi games introduced into that kind of environment, another fact is like TVL on layer one, Bitcoin is zero. So if that TVL chart starts to, you know, go 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, it probably is not going to slow down. Especially being on Bitcoin and a core part of defi being like staking or locking up your rewards somewhere. The chain literally just can't handle the amount of transactions that will want to unstake and sell. If you have 10,000 people who all own 10 tokens and they want to unstake and sell all those tokens, that's 200,000 transactions that need to clear for everyone to unstake and sell.
00:33:53.757 - 00:34:29.555, Speaker B: On Solana that can happen in five seconds. Boom, everyone's gone. On Bitcoin, it takes a full 24 hours basically for 200,000 transactions to clear. So it's just like kind of in talking to devs that we've talked to as well who are on the east side of things, or Solana, they've been so focused on this speed, speed, speed environment that slow fi is kind of like an interesting challenge to them where it's the same games that we're all used to, but now instead of optimizing for one second blocks, you're optimizing for 10 minute blocks. And it's just like a totally different kind of game that people are used to.
00:34:30.895 - 00:34:45.441, Speaker A: What would that mean for fees? Does that like raise any difficulties there? If you have, you know, 200,000 transactions that want to get pushed through but we can only do, I think you said 6,000 in 10 minutes, do we end up with any issues there?
00:34:45.623 - 00:35:13.811, Speaker B: Yeah, you basically have everybody fighting to get their transaction to clear first. Right. So like, okay, think about runes. Runes, like we talked about was this other token protocol that was made by the guy who made ordinals. And so the first day or two of runes, everyone was trying to mint these first early rune tokens. The bitcoin fees went to like 2 or 3,000 sats per VB, which is like, you know, 100, $150 just to do anything. And that was on like basically gambling.
00:35:13.811 - 00:35:55.195, Speaker B: Like the way that you buy and sell these rune tokens is you mint them and then you list them on something like Magic Eden or Unisat, like an nft and you hope that someone else buys it from you for more than you paid it for. So there's not like arbitrage where I can buy something and then immediately, you know, sell it into a liquidity pool. It's literally just completely peer to peer based. And even when it was just people gambling like that, the fees went to again, 2 or 3,000 sats per VB. So if you introduce an environment where now even, let's just say a dex, right? If you have a dex, you now have arbitrage between different pools. You have sandwich bots, that can happen. You have front running, that can happen.
00:35:55.195 - 00:36:30.557, Speaker B: You have sniping that can happen on new pairs. Like there's multiple levels of arbitrage that are introduced when you have liquidity pools. And every block essentially becomes like a bidding war for who gets to make the free money that's been left on the table by people. If somebody sets slippage to 80% and makes a trade, your trade's gonna be pending for 10 minutes. So everyone can see, I can go and get that free 80%. And they're gonna have to bid essentially over and over and over to get their transaction to go through. So yeah, important thing though here is that there.
00:36:30.621 - 00:37:07.467, Speaker C: There's extremely high value transactions that can be made though, right? Like this is the big difference between we saw people willing to pay these high fees with runes. We saw people willing to pay these high fees for in the peak of Ordinals and BRC 20s. But there's a few things that Apnea introduces here that weren't available before. One of them is liquid on chain trading, right? In completely permissionless way. So for example, there wasn't ever like $1 billion bitcoin meme coin. Why not? Because people didn't want it. Not because that narrative wasn't strong.
00:37:07.467 - 00:38:23.351, Speaker C: There literally wasn't a way to trade on chain to allow that to happen. Like there was not a uni swap. There was not a dex with X times Y equals K. Like there wasn't the ability to make a liquidity pair and then, then open, open trading and then, and then things moon, right? Like you have this super convoluted non user friendly experience of everyone is like free paying high fees to free mint tokens. But you're paying a ton of money in fees then now you've got like 5,000 holders of a token who all are technically in at a zero dollar cost basis. Like it's super complicated and super stupid and it didn't allow for like your typical pumponomics of any other blockchain. So what this is really going to allow for is for teams to come in and utilize applications like a pump fund or whatever, right? Like we didn't even see your typical grifts on bitcoin in the, in the peak of the activity here because it literally is like so not user friendly that even like meme coin grift cabals couldn't come in and launch like banger tokens or whatever, right? Like you didn't even have that type of activity, let alone any other level of, of high value transaction.
00:38:23.351 - 00:38:42.955, Speaker C: So what OpNet really allows for here and what we predict with this slow fight thing is that there's going to be all that type of stuff, right? You know, you might pay a high fee to get a transaction through, but we saw in 2021 people are willing to pay high fees if the return on, on the transaction they're making is valuable enough.
00:38:44.335 - 00:39:15.615, Speaker D: And so those fees when they spike that high in activity is happening in relation to like in other worlds. Other than just sending bitcoin to one person to the other. The people that are just sending bitcoin from one place to another or like one person to another making like this peer to peer transaction element, those people are going to have to also live with the fact that there's another subset of people on Bitcoin and the fees are going to be higher.
00:39:17.675 - 00:40:03.355, Speaker B: Bitcoin basically is like lacking users is basically the thing that it's not had. Before ordinals you've had miners, you've had like investors and you've got, you know, diamond hand Hodlers. I'm never going to sell. But pretty much before ordinals every bitcoin block had like 50 to 100 transactions in it. There was very rarely a block with 5,000 transactions is who's sending bitcoin that much? A lot of, a lot of people who send bitcoin are doing it on centralized exchanges also. So it's just completely off the books. But yeah, I think it's really like highlighting that there's basically a big disconnect between the bitcoin developers of the blockchain and the bitcoin users of the token itself.
00:40:03.355 - 00:40:27.345, Speaker B: There's like a very, very large gap between what the developers want and what the users want to see. And introducing something like Op Net where again every block now basically turns into a bidding war for multiple on chain defi games. It should shake things up and kind of hopefully like highlight all of these issues are fixable but the devs are just are.
00:40:28.965 - 00:40:31.263, Speaker C: What is bitcoin? What is Bitcoin today?
00:40:31.349 - 00:40:31.571, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:31.603 - 00:40:55.163, Speaker C: Like take all the stuff that we're doing outside of it. Right. But like what is bitcoin today? Bitcoin is not what it was meant to be in the light paper, which is peer to peer currency. Right. Like the system is clearly not set up to be cash transactions on a peer to peer level. It's. There's this digital gold narrative, but the digital gold narrative basically says buy it and hold it and don't use the network.
00:40:55.163 - 00:41:28.931, Speaker C: Which basically means that fees to the miners, which is really like that's as the halving rate cuts every four years all. And if Bitcoin doesn't just keep going up by 2x every four years then. And we're talking about a giant Ponzi scheme pretty much. Right. Like that's, that's what Bitcoin without any of this type of activity ends up turning into. Because if people aren't using the network on a day to day basis for, you know, daily transactions, then the fees are extremely low on the network. Okay, that's good to some people.
00:41:28.931 - 00:42:04.985, Speaker C: But then the miners aren't making a lot of money and if the price of Bitcoin isn't doubling every four years, then mining bitcoin becomes not profitable. At that point the entire thing falls apart. So there needs to be something that incentivizes miners to continually to continue securing Bitcoin and keep it decentralized and secure. So that's sort of like there needs to be something that happens with Bitcoin that allows for fees to be higher than the block rewards. You know, even if it's in four years from now, the fees need to be higher than the block rewards at a certain point in time or else Bitcoin won't be secure anymore.
00:42:05.725 - 00:42:38.585, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's just hilarious. So imagining like a large ETF custody or something trying to like move, just move funds fighting against a bunch of like pump fun, doing some meme Code. I think that's hilarious. So I think we might have jumped over just like the 92nd, like what is opponent, if you want to run through that. And then I kind of want to jump into what the user experience is going to be like maybe like the first few days. Day one.
00:42:39.525 - 00:42:42.747, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, Danny, do you want me to, want me to give the ELI five?
00:42:42.861 - 00:42:43.775, Speaker B: Go ahead, sir.
00:42:43.895 - 00:43:26.875, Speaker C: All right. I mean basically, okay, I explained ordinals where you're putting JPEG metadata into bitcoin blocks, right? And then you have this off chain thing that's interpreting it and giving you ownership of these JPEGs op networks a little bit differently, but it's following some of the same principles. We've created our own like basically format of putting data into bitcoin blocks. And this data instead of being metadata for JPEGs, you're putting bytecode for smart contracts into bitcoin blocks. So you're putting these smart contracts into bitcoin blocks. These smart contracts basically live inside of unspendable bitcoin addresses. This is like a function of Bitcoin is you can basically create an address that has a no spend condition.
00:43:26.875 - 00:44:14.093, Speaker C: That's where these smart contracts live. Then the users can interact with those smart contracts by sending their call data to those smart contracts also in Bitcoin transactions. So you're basically. We're creating smart contracts on Bitcoin, we're creating smart contract addresses on Bitcoin which are just bitcoin addresses with no spend conditions. So you know, you can't access the, the, that Bitcoin in that address anymore. So and then basically off chain the only thing you don't have is execution. So off chain, basically you have a indexer/vm that is basically reading, recognizing the smart contracts that are deployed, seeing all the interactions that are done on chain and then just providing you a state of what, what happened in all those on chain interactions.
00:44:14.093 - 00:44:46.915, Speaker C: So all the contract deploys all the contract interactions, all the information is all, it's all done on chain through bitcoin transactions. And off chain you basically have a, you know, read only state. Machine is sort of like a hot buzzword for this type of stuff. But basically you have these indexers that are indexing all the activity that's happened on chain and providing you a state. And so that is basically the fundamental basis of OP Net. In a nutshell, that might be too high level or too low level, but that's not overview.
00:44:49.135 - 00:45:14.289, Speaker D: I think that makes sense. So the terminology of funds locked in a smart contract that I feel like is a thing in regular defi set. How does that, I guess, how does that work? How would a normal liquidity pool work in like on, on OP net?
00:45:14.417 - 00:45:14.657, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:14.681 - 00:45:42.025, Speaker B: So so basically when you deploy a smart contract with OP net, you're making a bitcoin transaction that has what's called tap script. So essentially bitcoin has two scripting languages. Neither of these are touring complete. So they're very, very basic. There's normal script, that's what is like built into bitcoin. And there's tap script which is like, it's like a DLC that came with the Taproot upgrade, right. So you can do a little bit more, you know, fancy things.
00:45:42.025 - 00:46:45.793, Speaker B: And so some of those things are like generating addresses, generating time locked addresses, setting conditions for what this address can do with the funds that it holds. And so we utilize that when you deploy a smart contract. Basically a new address is generated on chain and the private key for that address is there's a function in tab script called tweaking where you can tweak the key of something as you create it the way the creator of the transaction doesn't have access to that private key. And so we use that address as like the called reference point for that smart contract code that is stored in the bitcoin blockchain itself. So on chain, like on bitcoin, Bitcoin doesn't care about any of this stuff itself. It's just, you know, the layer, it's holding all of the data itself. But when you bring these indexers into play that index that on chain data and kind of give the state of what they see, that's where the linking of that address is to the smart contract.
00:46:45.793 - 00:47:21.265, Speaker B: So it's really just like a design choice. So when we want to interact with let's say a liquidity pool, if I want to add a chad token and a banana token to an lp, right, I will basically send a transaction to that LP address on chain that has a little bit of bitcoin in it. And off chain the indexer sees, okay, this user interacted with the smart contract address. What do they do? My call data is in the data of that transaction and it just kind of interprets things.
00:47:22.165 - 00:47:25.301, Speaker D: So where are the funds? Where are the banana and chad tokens at that point?
00:47:25.333 - 00:47:55.315, Speaker B: The banana and chad tokens are essentially like virtual assets. So none of These add ordinals, BRC 20s runes, even OP20 tokens like Opnet, they're all virtualized assets. So like in bitcoin there is only bitcoin Even the concept of SATs, like a unit of bitcoin is totally fake. Basically, every time that you send bitcoin from one place to another, you're like, destroying the original bitcoin and creating technically new bitcoin at this new address point.
00:47:56.855 - 00:48:15.415, Speaker C: Bitcoin's like a ledger, right? So it's not like there's 21 million individual bitcoins. This is like. I mean, maybe I'm just. But, like, early on, I. I was like, okay, yeah, you're sending. When I send one bitcoin to Danny, I'm like, actually sending him the bitcoin that's in my wallet and it's going to Danny's wallet. Not true.
00:48:15.415 - 00:48:17.567, Speaker C: I'm basically. It's just a ledger.
00:48:17.751 - 00:48:19.995, Speaker D: That's how I currently think it works.
00:48:21.175 - 00:48:29.879, Speaker C: Me too. It's. It's just a ledger. So basically, like, it's not that I'm sending one bitcoin from my. That. That. That has my name on it to Danny's wallet.
00:48:29.879 - 00:48:34.231, Speaker C: I'm basically saying minus one Bitcoin plus one Bitcoin.
00:48:34.303 - 00:48:52.338, Speaker B: This is the concept of UTXOS. So, like, if I. If I have 0.2 Bitcoin in my wallet, right? And then I said, I send Chad 0.1 Bitcoin two times. When Chad wants to send 0.2 Bitcoin to someone else, he is destroying those two units of 0.1
00:48:52.338 - 00:49:09.075, Speaker B: Bitcoin and creating a new unit of 0.2 Bitcoin that is now being, you know, sent to this other address point. So bitcoin is a constantly, even satoshi bitcoin. Like, technically, within the bitcoin protocol, it's. It's. There's no fungibility at all to these tokens. Yeah.
00:49:11.215 - 00:49:27.149, Speaker D: Okay, so the money, or let's. Let's just say there's like $10 or $5 on each side of this banana and Chad token. You're burning $10 worth Bitcoin to create these tokens.
00:49:27.197 - 00:49:29.501, Speaker B: And the unit of bitcoin is real.
00:49:29.573 - 00:49:29.805, Speaker A: You.
00:49:29.845 - 00:50:14.463, Speaker B: You use the lowest spendable amount of bitcoin to basically send. It's like I'm sending a command on chain and then off chain. There's like, a VM that is keeping, you know, track of executing whatever I say I want to do in the command. So, like, these tokens aren't really real in the sense that, like, ERC20 tokens feel real because Ethereum itself recognizes the asset. You know, like, the Ethereum nodes are aware of your ERC 20 shitcoins in your wallet, whether it's you know, you bought it or you got airdropped to you in Bitcoin. Bitcoin like itself, only recognizes Bitcoin. And then this data that you can put into transactions, they're stored on the chain forever.
00:50:14.463 - 00:50:24.715, Speaker B: You know, there's, there's no loss of that data. And so off chain we just kind of do like the VM portion where you execute whatever's happening and keep track of the state.
00:50:25.175 - 00:51:29.159, Speaker C: Yeah, I see importantly all of the tokens that we're familiar with, whether it's ERC 20s or any token on any of these other chains, these are all basically virtual assets anyway. Right? The smart contract creates these tokens fundamentally, then you can trade these virtual assets around within the network. We're basically trying to replicate that exact sort of system, but supplement where Bitcoin is lacking so you can deploy your smart contract onto Bitcoin. Bitcoin nodes aren't fundamentally recognizing those smart contracts. So we have these indexers that are able to recognize the smart contracts. And you know, I can interact and do, do everything I'm, I want to do with those smart contracts, whether it's, you know, interact with applications or send tokens around, whatever through these smart contract commands I can send through Bitcoin transactions. And then the indexer, slash VM side is, is, is what's recognizing and interpreting all of that information.
00:51:29.159 - 00:51:47.665, Speaker C: So without the indexer, we could basically, it's like we're playing in the dark a little bit. Like we could, we could trade, you know, using these smart contracts, we can send assets around, we can do all this stuff, but without the indexer to provide you the state, you're just like sending contract commands.
00:51:48.125 - 00:52:29.471, Speaker B: For example, BRC 20s are just JSON files. They're JSON files that are ordinals. And then there's this additional layer of indexing that interprets the JSON files and sorts them and makes it like a fancy file cabinet, links all this data together. We do the same thing, just not built on top of ordinals. So, you know, instead of your token being a JSON file, your token is just raw call data that you are submitting in a Bitcoin transaction. And then off chain, this indexer is reading that call data and then showing, you know, Chad has one banana token or Chad has LP tokens in this LP pool.
00:52:29.503 - 00:53:10.125, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's completely immutable. Right, because all of your smart contracts, all of your interactions, it's all happening on the Bitcoin blockchain in Bitcoin through Bitcoin transactions that are immutable like you're leveraging the security and the immutability of Bitcoin as sort of like a data availability layer you can think of to, to do all this stuff. And the only thing that you don't have in comparison to something like Ethereum is the VM is not built into the blockchain. So you basically just have to shunt that to an off chain style interpretation. An easy way to think about it, it's not exactly like this. So go ahead.
00:53:10.165 - 00:53:32.133, Speaker D: Yeah, you mentioned that all of the data, the call data, is in the transaction of these bitcoin transactions. So the indexers are basically just kind of telling the story that's already in that, already written down there.
00:53:32.269 - 00:53:32.985, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:33.365 - 00:54:11.483, Speaker D: How, what, what trust assumptions are people putting? Like, let's just say I decided to build bridge my net worth to opt at day one. Like where, where is like the trust? Like how much trust am I putting into these like indexers? As someone who has like no idea what an indexer really is, like I, I sort of get it from what you're explaining, but I feel like there's going to be a lot of people that don't, haven't heard that terminology, don't understand what it does, and they're going to be expected to bridge a good amount of ETH or whatever asset to Upnet. Can you explain the indexer a little bit more and what trust you're putting into it?
00:54:11.619 - 00:55:17.687, Speaker B: Yes. So right now if you were to, let's just say BRC 20s and runes, if you were to bridge 100 ETH from Ethereum to Bitcoin and then buy a bunch of, you know, runes, tokens or whatever, all of the indexers for ordinals, BRC 20s, runes, etc. They're all literally just unique instances of these indexers running that have no communication or consensus like between indexer to indexer. And the reason why they're kind of able to get away with that is because they're all working on the same chain of data. Like normally the consensus in a blockchain with smart contracts is going to be in like the data happening and then you know, there will be a secondary level of consensus on the execution happening on eth. It's all built into the same thing. But there's two things that you're having consensus on what is the data of what happened and how are we interpreting that data to show what happened in Bitcoin? You really only have the ability to do the first one on chain itself.
00:55:17.687 - 00:55:51.845, Speaker B: Or you know, if you need to know whether Chad's trade or my trade went through first in an instance. Well, you can just look to the chain and see, you know, this is, this is what happened first and this is what happened second. And everyone will agree on that. And so in the case of ordinals, BRC 20s and runes, every indexer is literally like a unique. If you use Magic Eden and you're going to buy a rune token on Magic Eden. Right, right. Like a website, you're literally trusting their infrastructure to just give you the correct state and give you the correct tokens.
00:55:51.845 - 00:56:28.209, Speaker B: With OP Net we have safety checks in every block because we're talking about programmability. Things need to be deterministic. It can't be the case of Chad runs an indexer, I run an indexer and they say two different things ever. Essentially every single time that something is processed within a block, we create like a hash. So there's the normal bitcoin block, that bitcoin block header is generated from the transaction headers of everything else. And then we have like, you can think of it like an opnet block. It's not a block in the sense it's a blockchain at all.
00:56:28.209 - 00:57:25.205, Speaker B: It's just a hash that's created from all of the OP net specific transactions that happen in Bitcoin. And so when the opt indexers like process a block, they have what's called a proof of authority network, which is really just like again, it's not a blockchain, it's not a consensus network, it's just a check, a way for indexers to communicate peer to peer and they submit the hash that they see. And you know, as long as everything, everyone agrees on what they saw on chain, it really depends on your Bitcoin node. As long as your bitcoin node is, is reading correctly and not crashing, then you will get the correct state. And if you change a single byte of data on your local instance, like if you go into the database and switch a 0 to a 1 or 1 to a 0, then your hash while syncing will just like simply not check out. And so your indexer will crash. So yeah, in most meta protocols you are placing basically full trust in the indexers.
00:57:25.205 - 00:57:34.827, Speaker B: OP Net is the first meta protocol indexer to have like a hash of its own state that is like submitted between indexers itself.
00:57:35.011 - 00:58:23.859, Speaker C: The important thing to understand for those who are unaware of this whole indexer idea, is the phenomena that sort of emerged with indexers. I think this is really the most innovative part about ordinals that sort of changed the social conscience about it is that if everything happened on, on chain, if all the interactions happened on chain, there should be theoretically an objective state. Right. Like there is everything that happened. If, if all the interactions happened on chain, then there is an objective state. Like there should be one state that, that everyone should read. If you're, if you're just indexing every single thing that happened on chain, then you should come to the same conclusion as Danny or anybody else who's running an indexer.
00:58:23.859 - 00:58:52.037, Speaker C: Right. So like, and then this is sort of the concept, I mean, this goes with all this indexer meta protocol stuff. Like if there's no indexers for 10 years and everyone's still doing, doing stuff on chain, you could theoretically just index everything that happened over the course of the past 10 years and still get an accurate state of events, because all of the interactions happened on chain. So all the data is on chain, all the interactions happen on chain.
00:58:52.181 - 00:58:59.229, Speaker D: And that can't be said. Just to clarify that statement you're making, there can't be said for the other meta protocols. Or can it?
00:58:59.397 - 00:59:17.467, Speaker B: No, it can. You can recreate any of these meta protocols. Yeah. From the beginning to the end, because again, all of their data is on chains. Yeah. If the ordinal clients all went down for 10 years, or the op net clients went down for 10 years and people were still, you know, somehow using it, just manually creating it, I guess. Yeah.
00:59:17.467 - 00:59:20.771, Speaker B: You could re index and it would show the same state as what it showed before.
00:59:20.843 - 00:59:50.585, Speaker C: Right. The biggest difference between opnet and these other meta protocols is like, so for example, with ordinals, I can literally run an ordinal client, which is just their indexer. Right. I can run an ordinal client and edit the database locally and say I own everybody's ordinals, but no one would use my. The endpoint that I'm providing from my local ordinal client. Let's just say I'm running a marketplace or something. No one would use my marketplace because on my marketplace I have a version of the OR client that says I own everybody's JPEGs.
00:59:50.585 - 01:00:18.725, Speaker C: Right. So this is like this phenomena that's emerged with ordinals, which is like. Yeah, I mean, every single marketplace or application or anytime you're using the ordinal client to do anything, you're basically relying on somebody's localized state, someone's local database, and there are no safety checks there. But it's just worked because there's no reason for someone to edit a database locally. And if they did, no one would Use it.
01:00:18.805 - 01:00:21.557, Speaker B: The different normal Internet in that case. Yeah.
01:00:21.581 - 01:00:28.733, Speaker D: So each protocol or each website is just running their own indexer and everyone's just like, all right, we're going to have to use their website. We'll trust.
01:00:28.789 - 01:00:39.529, Speaker B: If you want a bad indexer, nobody's going to use your website. Right. The incentive is for you to run the correct state, because if you run the wrong state and say you own everything, nobody's going to use your stuff.
01:00:39.577 - 01:00:42.833, Speaker D: And so would the same thing happen on oppnet?
01:00:42.929 - 01:00:44.345, Speaker C: No. So it would be a bunch of.
01:00:44.385 - 01:01:46.381, Speaker D: Different indexers that are creating these hashes that are like kind of the security checks. I mean, in short, it kind of reminds me of like the whole like sequencer conversation where like people are like, it's a centralized sequencer, but you can just like, you know, shoot out to the L1 if you need to. But, you know, there are people, whoever these people are, that are checking to see if the sequencer is ordering transactions properly is not like acting in a malicious way. It sounds like indexers or something like that. For what it's worth, the fact that there's been so many iterations of these meta protocols on Bitcoin and this is the first time that I'm hearing about indexers or like this kind of aspect of this technology kind of, I think shows, like, shows some character from you guys. It's like the runes guys are just like, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna bring whatever. And like, yeah, you don't need to know about what this indexer is.
01:01:46.381 - 01:02:15.357, Speaker D: It's fine. But it feels like actually taking a sec to learn, especially when there's gonna be smart contracts, there's gonna be all these different things you could do. It's like, I think people are going to need to understand that to be able to like bridge their funds over. But yeah, no, I think, I think that makes, I think that makes sense. So there is no consensus that happens among these indexers for like verifying truth, is there?
01:02:15.461 - 01:03:08.677, Speaker B: In the case of ordinal, there's not. In opnet, there is proof authority network. But it's not like, okay, when I want to get the state of Ethereum, right? I just basically am like calling the general already came to consensus state of Ethereum nodes across the world. That's like the same goes for Bitcoin, right? When you're dealing with these meta protocols, specifically opp. Net, you are still calling the instance of one company or person or whatever's indexer, but that indexer, you know, is the correct state because it's up and running. Like if your indexer has anything locally changed, then it literally will just like crash. And what's weird is that the concept of indexers really stems maybe not invented by, but it's commonly used every day on Ethereum already.
01:03:08.677 - 01:03:44.649, Speaker B: Like Etherscan as a website, it indexes the Ethereum blockchain and then gives you like a readable version of the data that you're seeing. Right. So this concept of indexing already exists across all of these smart contract chains. It's huge on Solana as well. You can't really run a copy of the Solana blockchain. It's like 200 terabytes, like an entire server just to run that. So what people do is they index it and it allows you to like run portions of the chain, the live state, but have a basically record of what has happened in an off chain version of it.
01:03:44.649 - 01:04:23.771, Speaker B: So like when you go to Etherscan and look at a transaction that happened six years ago, you're not calling Etherscan's Ethereum node to get the information of what happened. You're reading their index of what has happened and what they recorded happening. And you know, as long as it checks out, then everyone is pretty much okay with it. It's like a weird mix of on chain and off chain that I think the bitcoin world is like, really. It's like lifted on its head where basically the concept of ordinals is the opposite of ERC721. ERC721. Your ownership is on chain, your data is on IPFS or something off chain.
01:04:23.771 - 01:04:29.211, Speaker B: And in ordinals your data is on chain and your ownership is off chain on these indexers.
01:04:29.323 - 01:04:53.009, Speaker C: Right. OpNet works a little bit differently, but again follows a lot of those same principles. And then the other thing about opnet is that like anyone can run an opnet indexer. So if you don't want to trust any, you know, point anyone's endpoint, you can run your own and verify yourself locally. Is what I'm seeing on mine the same as, as what's happening over there?
01:04:53.097 - 01:04:53.473, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:53.529 - 01:05:20.873, Speaker C: Again, there is also this check that unlike, you know, I saw, I mentioned that you can edit your ordinal database locally to say I own everyone's ordinals. The difference between the ordinal client in OP net is that you can't do that if you, if you change anything locally on an OP net indexer, then because there is an objective state of events that happen. So if you edit anything locally, your indexer locally will also will just crash. So you, there, there are safety checks to make sure the only way you.
01:05:20.889 - 01:05:44.067, Speaker B: Can edit something locally is by basically editing your index of the on chain data. And so because we have these like safety checks of hashing, if one of those hashes, you know, is coming from a root of information where even as a zero has been changed to a one, a single byte has changed, that hash is going to come out completely different than what it should be compared to the bitcoin hash that we already have.
01:05:44.131 - 01:06:03.229, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. An easy way to think about opnet is that it's just a basically like a plugin to Bitcoin. Like you're not bridging funds to op Net, you're bridging funds to Bitcoin. Like you're just using Bitcoin in every, everything that you're doing, you're using Bitcoin. Like you're not. There is not a separate net network or anything like that. Right.
01:06:03.229 - 01:06:50.161, Speaker C: It literally is just something that plugs into Bitcoin that allows you to interpret information like you can already without oppnet ever existing, you can put any amount of data into a bitcoin block. What oppnet's giving you is basically a format to put data into bitcoin blocks that is like allows you to put these smart contracts into bitcoin blocks. Like you could theoretically today put a solidity contract into us into a bitcoin block. But there's not, you know, it's not. The nodes for Bitcoin are not aware of those smart contracts. So what we've done is create basically a format to deploy smart contracts into bitcoin blocks and then a format for you to be able to interact with those smart contracts through Bitcoin transactions. And then the an off chain interpretation of those on chain events.
01:06:50.161 - 01:06:59.285, Speaker C: That's pretty much the way that you can think about OpMed is like it's not. It just plugs into Bitcoin and allows you to basically do a bunch more with it.
01:07:01.545 - 01:07:29.115, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, I think I feel like that's pretty comprehensive. Like that's a good, that's a good like stopping point on like the infra side. I know we're like a little bit over here. I have, and I have one last question specifically about like ecosystem stuff because usually that's like what interests me more. So infrastructure and like new tech is obviously fun and stuff. But like I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be playing around with the ecosystem.
01:07:29.115 - 01:07:55.995, Speaker A: Like I'm gonna be using apps, I'm gonna be getting rugged. I'm gonna be eggs Liquidity. So that's like what's most relevant, you know, what do you guys. And like if you have any like teams or projects you want to shout out, now would be a great time for that as well. What's being built right now that you know of or planning to be built? And in addition to that, like what would you guys like to see built? What would you guys like to see come over to OP net that isn't there yet?
01:07:56.115 - 01:08:45.715, Speaker B: What would we like to see is literally anything from the eth Basically pick a smart contract thing. Whether it's a meme coin or it's a, a tax token or it's a yield farm or it's you know, a website for, you know, snapshot.org. we basically have now like popped the lid on being able to do everything that exists on Ethereum and Solana on bitcoin. So there are like no, we're starting from zero with eight years of previous experience on these other smart contract chains to like know what works and what doesn't work. So for first we want to like see the defi primitives. So we're making MotoSwap again. It's like a fork of Uniswap Sushiswap where we have univ2 style pools with liquidity mining like how MasterChef likes how sushiswap worked.
01:08:45.715 - 01:09:25.229, Speaker B: And then past that there's essentially like a bunch of stablecoins that are building. There's the Stash on BTC guys that are building like a fork of liquidy. There's a couple of different like bitcoin native stable coins. There's actually a very well known ETH Defi stablecoin that is coming over and building their own thing. I don't want to leak that, but it is, it is very, very cool to see, you know, real defi players come in. And then I have the list pulled up in front of me. There are currently over 40 projects that are building on op net.
01:09:25.229 - 01:09:48.195, Speaker B: So yeah, we have everything from lending markets. There's also like a friend tech that people want to make for bitcoin. It's called OP Friend. There's like a lido type thing where you can take bitcoin and liquidly stake it. It's called Bido. There's OP Fun which is like pumpkin fun.
01:09:49.855 - 01:10:04.075, Speaker C: Boundaries is building lbps. You have, there's a few. There's a liquidy fork called Stash that's basically making a CDP like Len to mint stable coin.
01:10:04.495 - 01:10:44.187, Speaker B: There's going to be an ohm fork. There's an ohm fork called Sloan which is pretty funny and specifically things like the omfork and pump fun. You know, people have kind of heard of lending on bitcoin, they've heard of dexes on bitcoin but they haven't really heard of anyone doing an ohm fork or they haven't really heard of anyone doing pump funds type things. So like we've actually had quite a, an uptick in interest from like completely non bitcoiner EVM DeFi people because they see well there's, there's an ohm fork happening on bitcoin. Of course I'm going to go, you know, bridge and search for that is there's free yield there. So like.
01:10:44.211 - 01:11:10.795, Speaker C: Right. And you can also like think of this like planting your flag on the moon. Right. If you're a, if you're a developer there's, there's two things about this. If you're a developer on, in the EVM world which is like a wasteland of L2s and where am I going to fork the next thing? Well like bitcoin is a place where none of this stuff has happened yet and there's a wealth of liquidity there that's waiting to be tapped into. So like plant your what launched on.
01:11:10.835 - 01:11:32.893, Speaker B: Blast that was completely original code. Probably close to nothing. Like everything is a fork of something that happened on ETH or a different L2. So we want to kind of like attract those builders who are. Right, like you're laughing but it's because it's true. Right? Like who is building anything unique in the eth l2 days? Like nobody. They're just forking stuff that already worked.
01:11:32.893 - 01:11:54.811, Speaker B: So we kind of want to see the exact same game but now plopped onto bitcoin which has this trove of liquidity that actually like hasn't been. Like we said before, there are $0 in TVL on Bitcoin layer one. That's like one of the rare numbers that can only go up that's kind of left in the crypto defi space. So if that number starts climbing it's just, it's not going to stop.
01:11:54.843 - 01:12:49.721, Speaker C: We think the second thing there is too like there's not a lot of developers in the bitcoin world to begin with. And one of the things we've done with opnet is just allow for building on bitcoin on layer one to be as easy as it is to build on any ETH related chain. So like you don't have to know too much about Bitcoin to be able to build a bitcoin layer one application. And since there's not a lot of developers in the bitcoin world, it's wide open territory for any builders from the ETH world who again as Danny sort of said before, these are money maxi builders. So if any are listening, it's like there's a very easy opportunity to say what worked on, on Ethereum, what worked on any L2 or what worked on Solana. Like you can very easily port that over to bitcoin layer one and not and be the first to do it or be the second, whatever, right? To build this stuff. Like yeah, you have people making aave on bitcoin.
01:12:49.721 - 01:13:50.831, Speaker C: You have people making, yeah, like pick a billion dollar defi primitive and you can pretty much fork it to bitcoin and now be the first one to do it on the, the biggest blockchain, the one that pretty much leads all of crypto. And I mean again, the other thing is too like these people who are on bitcoin who never bridged off, who think that ETH is like a coin or whatever, it's like these people have never even touched these games. So like they, it's gonna be the first time that any of these guys have any exposure to anything defi. These guys are people who, the only time they've ever been able to even experience any yield on their bitcoin is like Celsius, right? And where they get rugged. So it's like being able to do all this stuff on chain. I mean I'm talking about even the most basic thing, right? Like these guys, their dream, their dream. The extent of their dream is I want to be able to swap my bitcoin for a stable coin on bitcoin without kycing with an exchange.
01:13:51.023 - 01:14:38.289, Speaker B: If you're a bitcoin maxi right now, you can be the biggest bitcoin maxi ever. You read the Satoshi bible every night before you put your kids to sleep. But that is not going to change the fact that you use ERC20 stable coins. Like that is the only option that exists for you. So if you open up the ability to like have a bitcoin, not even bitcoin backed, but just a bitcoin issued stablecoin, these whales are going to go crazy for it. Because right now you can have 100,000 bitcoin and you're still going to need to either bridge it yet to use ERC20 tokens or put it in a centralized exchange that is going to still use ERC20 tokens. So like there's quite a bit of like there's degen attention on, you know, wanting to do yield farming and pump fun and all these kind of degen games.
01:14:38.289 - 01:14:52.949, Speaker B: But there is also like real institutional use case for stables and lending and a basic dex on bitcoin. Because right now, yeah, basically every single bitcoin maxi has the kyc or dox their entire holdings just to get access to their money.
01:14:52.997 - 01:15:30.777, Speaker C: So there's no DAOS, there's no RWAs, there's no, there's no anything on bitcoin. Right. And that's really what Op Net fundamentally is, is it's a platform that allows you to build all that stuff directly on layer one. And so yeah, again that's really on a trading on a. If you're a trader or you're a builder, either way all this stuff is coming to Bitcoin over the course of the next few months. So I think you either pay attention and get in early or you fomo in later. Either way, Bitcoin, I think everyone is, this is why all these Bitcoin L2s are getting so much funding, is because everyone's bullish on bitcoin leading this next cycle.
01:15:30.777 - 01:15:41.503, Speaker C: Bitcoin defi is a very hot buzzword but it's like there isn't a way to do it yet until we, you know, again we sort of put forth the solution with opnet. You made it easy for builders.
01:15:41.559 - 01:16:23.025, Speaker D: So yeah, again so we're going infra ecosystem. Inevitably we have like user experience left. What is it going to look like day one? Like let's say I'm sitting with, sitting with my eth. How do I bridge you? You mentioned the Uniswap Unisat wallet, but like I've used the Unisat wallets, not that good. There's like, I don't know, taproot and then what looks like chain selection for messaging. I'm like, fuck, I'm going to fuck this up and I won't know if I fuck this up until 10 minutes from now. What is day one on op net going to look like for a regular user?
01:16:23.325 - 01:17:10.393, Speaker B: You will have to use the Unisat wallet or Xverse is like the two main Bitcoin wallets right now. We've heard rumors that MetaMask is going to be adding Taproot root support soon. So fingers crossed that they do that. That would be really, really, really cool. But right now, yeah, you do have to have, you know, if you're an ETH user and you have Ethereum, you're going to have to use like you know, fix, float or change now or whatever to get your ETH from Ethereum into Bitcoin out of Bitcoin wallet. And then once you have that bitcoin you basically, you can go to motoswap.org and select the token that you want to buy and then basically click the, the swap button, set your slippage to whatever you want and once you know, the 10 minute block clears, then boom, you've got your tokens.
01:17:10.393 - 01:17:23.657, Speaker B: And again we're going to have like liquidity mining all these other tools. It should feel like ETH is just going to be slow. That's why we call it slow fi, because it's very up front. It's going to be slow and it's going to be fi. Those are the two things that it's going to be.
01:17:23.801 - 01:17:56.695, Speaker C: I mean again, basically from the most basic perspective, go to opnet.org and it'll have all of the resources you need pretty much. Again, like aside from getting your ETH to Bitcoin, like that's, I think everyone knows how to do that. There's a million different options to do. So go through a centralized exchange, you can go through a bridge, you can go through whatever, however you want to do it. We'll even have ways where you can just wrap your eth onto Bitcoin if you want to. But again, I think it would just be better to get bitcoin and then because you'll need it for gas anyway, the gas token is just bitcoin, so.
01:17:56.695 - 01:18:16.779, Speaker C: And then go to opmed.org, it'll have a very easy step by step user guide. You can use any Bitcoin Taproot wallet. Technically with any of these, Taproot is just a type of bitcoin address, but you can use any Bitcoin Taproot wallet. We'll have our own wallet that people can use too. If you just want that easy experience. Everything is right there on opnut.org
01:18:16.779 - 01:18:17.123, Speaker C: but.
01:18:17.139 - 01:18:53.663, Speaker B: It won't be like ordinals where you need to understand this concept of minting. And I have to make a transfer inscription like, like if you are an EVM person. We went to ETH Denver in, what was that, late February, early March and we, we had a booth. So we talked to like a thousand people. And talking to ETH users was actually like super insightful for us really early on in the days of OP debt because we know exactly where they're confused. Like they understand how to get bitcoin onto a bitcoin wallet. That's not, you know, bridging is not a force and concept to them, but it's more like when I have the bitcoin in my wallet, what's the.
01:18:53.663 - 01:19:13.515, Speaker B: Do I buy a BRC20 token? Do I mint it? Do I swap for like they have no clue. Yeah, no clue. And so like this should be the type of scenario where you bridge your bitcoin and then it's basically just like eth. Where you go, you, you, you are very familiar with what you want to do and it's just a little bit slower. Yeah.
01:19:15.985 - 01:19:36.969, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. No, I think that's, I think that's well said. I think there's a lot for users to dig into. There's a, there's going to be a lot for them to play around with hopefully. And, and you know, once, once this stuff is all, is all ready or starts to, you know, starts to really move, we're like way over here. I want to give you guys one last, one last moment.
01:19:36.969 - 01:19:51.197, Speaker A: I, I think you said it pretty well already, but just like kind of wrap up if there's any, if there's any sort of closing remarks, anything that you guys think users should know, any action you think they should take, now would be a great time to throw that out there.
01:19:51.341 - 01:20:31.535, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean the easy, easy way to get involved with this early on, like we're in, we're in testnet. We'll probably be live to mainnet shortly, maybe the next month or so. Maybe don't hold me to it, but we want to make sure everything's, everything's super solid. But join the Moto Swap Telegram, that's like the, that's the hub for information on this stuff. There's a really big autistic retarded community that you will fit right in if you are an ETH person because it's like they basically, they've gathered up every single person who is so early to this that they're willing to sit through all the bullshit on bitcoin waiting for the experience that makes sense.
01:20:32.195 - 01:20:45.097, Speaker B: It's been like the Bearer Chain experience to be honest with you. Like basically Bear Chain was three years of non, to this day product not existing. And so we've got to like meme in the meantime. And that's the same. Yeah. Concept as the Motorswap community.
01:20:45.161 - 01:21:12.813, Speaker C: So yeah, join the Motoswap Telegram. There's, there's discords and telegrams for OP Net and motoswap, but motoswap Telegram is kind of where all the action is. You know either. Following myself, Danny Motoswapnet on Twitter, go to opnet.org there's a lot of resources there. I mean that's the easiest way to get involved right now. Again, like runes and all the shit that's happened on bitcoin before I think is like it's just really preseason.
01:21:12.813 - 01:21:39.985, Speaker C: None of it really makes sense. I mean, even as a user who's involved in this ecosystem for since the beginning, pretty much none of it's really made sense to me either. It's like a really bad user experience. So you'll see with OP Net very early on that the user experience is going to be extremely familiar. It'll be really easy to actually use and interact with. Then you can actually take advantage of all the opportunity that exists on bitcoin. So get involved early, join the chats, mess around, meme around.
01:21:39.985 - 01:21:58.745, Speaker C: That's kind of like where anything is, is happening right now. And if you do that, you'll probably be pretty well positioned to, to get an early to these early projects that are launching again. As Danny said, There's probably about 40 plus that are in development right now and all of those will inevitably roll out over the course of the next couple months. Months.
01:21:59.245 - 01:22:29.375, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, if you're a dev, Definitely check out optnet.org it basically has everything that you need to get started. We have NPM packages that are just like ethers from the EVM side of things. So it all looks very familiar and we like to get in touch with everyone who's building on it. So yeah, shoot us a DM or hop in the MotoSwap chat. We have a chat for all the developers as well, so you can always just message one of us to get into that if you're dev.
01:22:30.795 - 01:22:53.905, Speaker A: Great stuff. Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm excited guys. I think there's going to be a lot of fun stuff going on. I think it's, you know, community in itself is, is a very fun thing with you guys. And to have to have like all this promise of interesting, novel, unique products on bitcoin for the first time is, is pretty crazy to say the least.
01:22:55.085 - 01:23:02.101, Speaker D: We want this to. I want this to work so badly. I'm so bored. If this could actually work, that'd be so fun.
01:23:02.253 - 01:23:28.485, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, again, imagine the situation where everyone who is. I mean this is sort of like we come from the eth world. So I might be like giving ourselves away as secret agents in the bitcoin world by saying this, but I want to imagine a world where everyone who's well experienced on EVM and come to the bitcoin world and immediately be the advantage traders versus you're going to have a bunch of people with a lot of money who have no idea who are touching this stuff for the first time.
01:23:28.565 - 01:23:31.865, Speaker B: What an easy food token season was. You remember that? Like.
01:23:32.805 - 01:24:08.327, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So again we. Inevitably there's going to be big whale activity like down the line, especially once solid stable coins are out there that have a lot of trust and have a lot of value and the bitcoin blocks are going to be massively filled up. But like there's going to be a long period of time, I think where there's going to be all sorts of crazy stuff. We're going to speed run the last three, four years on Ethereum, except on Bitcoin. So that's, that's really where, you know, I'm sure everyone's seen all the false promises of runes and all that, but like the user experience will sort of speak for itself. Like once you.
01:24:08.327 - 01:24:11.275, Speaker C: Once you get going, you'll see the difference.
01:24:12.265 - 01:24:18.657, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm. I'm excited to try it. I'm hyped up for sure. This is gonna be. This is gonna be a lot of fun.
01:24:18.761 - 01:24:19.605, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
01:24:19.945 - 01:24:40.797, Speaker A: Thanks again for joining us guys. This was great. I really appreciate, you know, you guys coming and pilling us on all this stuff and explaining everything in nice simple terms so we could all understand. Yeah, that was episode 86 actually. I totally got. Totally got it wrong at the beginning. Episode 86 with Opnet.
01:24:40.797 - 01:24:44.485, Speaker A: Thanks again for joining us guys and we will catch you all next week.
01:24:44.605 - 01:24:45.005, Speaker C: Hell yeah.
