00:00:02.120 - 00:00:56.950, Speaker A: And then comparing that to LP on a perpetual protocol, especially on a virtual AMM based one. The AMM based one. The LP is there, like, if the market's taking one side of the trade and no one's taking the other side, especially with, like, collections that are super bullish right now, such as Milady's, the LP's need to take the other side of the trade. So what ends up happening is you're basically taking all the unfavorable trades that the market does not want to take. And I don't think that's, like, a very scalable solution, given that a whale can come in. Right. They could take a very leveraged bet on one side of the trade, and then they could try and manipulate the market, and then the protocol itself and the insurance pool could end up being in bad debt, and they could even go insolventhe.
