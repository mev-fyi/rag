00:00:00.320 - 00:00:06.810, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:09.270 - 00:00:14.130, Speaker B: All right. Episode ten. This is somewhat of a Mazda episode ten.
00:00:16.150 - 00:00:18.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I didn't think of it that way.
00:00:19.430 - 00:00:51.140, Speaker B: Heck. Again. So, I think we start off talking about arbitram just because we just did a bit. Mostly about your full circle thought process of, like, feeling like, holy shit, let's ape into every ecosystem. And then when I, like, you know, gave you that realization that you shouldn't.
00:00:52.730 - 00:01:28.100, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, looking back now, I guess it's obvious, but, like, of all the narratives that have happened since, like, the bear market started, like, all of them were, like, cautioned in some way. I think, like, I could step back with all them and, like, kind of realize when it was starting to get, like, too frothy, like, too euphoric. But now with this one, at least not until, like, we started talking about. Until you, like, held me back a little, which is interesting. Did you get that think.
00:01:28.260 - 00:01:39.640, Speaker B: Did you get that with, like, I really both just came off, like, an NFT wave for the arb stuff. Did you feel that happen at all with, like, the NFT stuff?
00:01:40.660 - 00:01:50.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I. I think it coincided right around when, like, feed pics blew up. That was what I was thinking, like.
00:01:50.870 - 00:01:52.810, Speaker B: Oh, that's when you were thinking about it?
00:01:53.350 - 00:01:54.130, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:54.550 - 00:01:55.022, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:55.086 - 00:02:22.060, Speaker A: But, like, I don't think I did anything to. I guess, like, risk off too much. I guess I stopped trading. I mean, my. Like, how actively I've been trading has definitely tapered off in nfts since then, I think. But it wasn't like I went, like, started selling shit or, like, completely, like, committing to that, whereas with arbitrary, my kind of just. I was like, yeah, I gotta get the fuck out.
00:02:23.280 - 00:02:30.140, Speaker B: Is that mainly because you can get out with arbitrary? Most the NFTs at least I bought. I cannot get out.
00:02:30.560 - 00:02:35.558, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I have a good number I can get out with.
00:02:35.664 - 00:02:39.970, Speaker B: Uh, what can you get out on? I can only really get out on.
00:02:40.130 - 00:02:42.106, Speaker A: I have a good number I could.
00:02:42.138 - 00:02:46.578, Speaker B: Get out on, um, Spice, which I don't want to see a reason to.
00:02:46.594 - 00:02:48.010, Speaker A: Get out on spice for. Yeah.
00:02:48.090 - 00:02:49.990, Speaker B: And then, like, web averse.
00:02:50.810 - 00:02:53.430, Speaker A: Web verses hurting, dude. Yeah.
00:02:54.730 - 00:02:57.802, Speaker B: Did you. Did you claim? I didn't. I didn't get the PF.
00:02:57.986 - 00:03:10.780, Speaker A: I did claim. Yeah, but they're. I mean, they're not that cool, honestly. And they're worth. I mean, floor is, like, 0.02, like, five. Five eth volume total.
00:03:11.560 - 00:03:13.736, Speaker B: Jeez, they really fucked that up.
00:03:13.928 - 00:03:14.648, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:14.784 - 00:03:15.288, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:15.384 - 00:03:20.368, Speaker A: I have a lot I could liquidate actually, with NFTs I could sell my renga. I have this one ordinal.
00:03:20.464 - 00:03:22.420, Speaker B: Are you still didn't liquidate that?
00:03:22.720 - 00:03:40.220, Speaker A: No, no, because it's, it's actually for the first time, it's down below. I had such a good entry, but it finally dropped below it for the first time since I bought. It's at .94 right now. I have this like ordinal. Nft I could sell for like half an 8th. I have a little pudgy.
00:03:40.220 - 00:03:43.160, Speaker A: I have, I have one friendship bracelet still.
00:03:43.200 - 00:03:46.560, Speaker B: You have a little, oh, you have a little pudgy or a pudgy?
00:03:46.640 - 00:04:06.670, Speaker A: Yeah, no, a little pudgy. I was, I had a, I was blur farming bids on it and one of them got filled when I didn't want it to. But it's, I mean, it's, it's like right around where I bought it at. Like I could, I could sell it easily and get out the same price, but I'm okay with holding it.
00:04:07.130 - 00:04:08.510, Speaker B: Are you found a lot better.
00:04:11.810 - 00:04:12.650, Speaker A: Weird.
00:04:12.810 - 00:04:22.960, Speaker B: I think I was doing some writing about it and do you remember how I, I still have that same thesis of like they started adding new products, like NFT five products.
00:04:23.980 - 00:04:24.604, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:24.732 - 00:04:33.600, Speaker B: Their roadmap again. And it's pretty like secretive, their roadmap.
00:04:35.540 - 00:04:43.320, Speaker A: It's probably because they don't have any idea. They probably know just as little about it as you do, except for like the more immediate deliverables.
00:04:44.620 - 00:04:57.022, Speaker B: But no, I was really looking into like, okay, how hard do you think it would be to implement something like NFT five on any platform anywhere? I don't think it'd be hard. Is that, is that naive or is.
00:04:57.046 - 00:05:02.854, Speaker A: That, I don't think NFt five is open source. Isn't it like the platform NFT five?
00:05:03.022 - 00:05:10.670, Speaker B: I'm not sure if their exact code base is open source, but when I asked like chat GBT to like write.
00:05:10.710 - 00:05:14.192, Speaker A: A, it's not, it's not a complicated thing to do.
00:05:14.326 - 00:05:32.260, Speaker B: Code inside, it didn't seem that complicated, so. But you're grabbing like 30%, 40% of like NFT find market share just by adding that. If you're blur, like, don't you see they have them eventually absorbing like a marketplace eventually absorbing that.
00:05:32.420 - 00:05:36.852, Speaker A: What was my, what was my argument against this last time we talked about it?
00:05:36.996 - 00:05:41.036, Speaker B: They have to focus on marketplace product, market fit, right?
00:05:41.228 - 00:06:05.096, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think I still, I still would say that. I mean, implementing something like lending is like, is a no brainer. I think they could easily do it, but creating new primitives is too much of a challenge, I think because just because they have all this volume now doesn't mean that that's like enough. Because a lot of its fake volume.
00:06:05.128 - 00:06:45.140, Speaker B: Yeah, but they, it's like users though, I think that's the main point. Like if you have the users logging in the blur every single day, like, you will have a small percentage of them at least use the peer to peer aspect of NFT five. So I think it's super easy to implement. I just don't get why that's not a no brainer. They shouldn't do pooling. Like they shouldn't go bend down, start incentivizing like pools and shit, but throwing him peer to peer there for like almost like a craigslist or eBay of like NFT five. I don't think it's terribly wrong.
00:06:46.600 - 00:07:23.980, Speaker A: No, I mean, I think they could do it. I think they could do it. But it just depends, it just depends on like how, how their markets like match up with what's out there right now. And it's like, I don't think it's a hard thing to do to create something competitive right now for someone like them to create something competitive. But it wouldn't be anything new. Like, it would just be your average like peer lending, lending and borrowing mechanism. Like, I don't see them creating any new primitives was my point.
00:07:25.450 - 00:07:31.190, Speaker B: Do you think they have to, for it to work for it to like bring people to use it?
00:07:32.970 - 00:07:36.490, Speaker A: That's a hard question to answer, I think.
00:07:36.530 - 00:07:40.710, Speaker B: No, I don't think they have to. I think they can copycat NFT five.
00:07:41.770 - 00:07:47.586, Speaker A: Which is, you think they're fine. It's just a marketplace and like, like a basic, like, lending.
00:07:47.618 - 00:07:55.020, Speaker B: I mean, how much, how much iteration do you think they need to do on marketplace if you think that's what they should focus on?
00:07:56.720 - 00:08:30.980, Speaker A: It's tough to answer because, like you have to think about like what the NFT market is going to look like five years from now. Like is it going to be this PvP still? Is it going to, is it going to be like what's going to drive it? Is it still just going to be gambling and speculation? Like is there going to be, what's the market for, like gaming assets going to look like? Are gaming studios going to have their own marketplaces that users are more likely to trade on there?
00:08:32.320 - 00:09:08.750, Speaker B: I think, like the companies or protocols that like facilitate their product for what's happening now will be able to like mesh it and mold it for whatever comes in the future. I feel like that's just a must for like any of these projects that, I mean, nothing in DeFi looked the same as from the very beginning as to what it looks now looks like now. Yeah, and like, there's definitely some not major changes that happened but like some significant new, like, phases that were rolled out.
00:09:10.770 - 00:09:48.190, Speaker A: So I guess it's, yeah, I mean, I guess if that's the case, then it's probably not worrying about the marketplace bit too much. It's like they have, they have the volume. If they can retain it, that's all that really matters. Like, you don't need to worry too much about the direction of what happens with NFT markets or how the behaviors change there. It's more so just about adapting to fit to whatever is needed. And I mean, NFT five also falls under that umbrella because, like, NFT five isn't needed right now. It's, it's not good at all.
00:09:48.190 - 00:09:56.010, Speaker A: Like, just because they just, if Blur were to implement it, just put everybody.
00:09:56.050 - 00:09:59.298, Speaker B: Else out of business, I think it.
00:09:59.314 - 00:10:03.786, Speaker A: Wouldn'T make, it wouldn't make people suddenly start using, using NFT lending and borrowing.
00:10:03.858 - 00:10:11.850, Speaker B: Like, no, but anyone that was, would probably use Blur's mechanism because they probably have a tab of blur open and at that very moment.
00:10:14.110 - 00:10:30.014, Speaker A: If it's peer to peer. No, I would disagree. If it's peer to peer, you're gonna go wherever you're getting the best rates. And liquidity has been reasonably sticky. Ten ft five. Yeah, I don't know.
00:10:30.062 - 00:11:26.180, Speaker B: I mean, that's true, but I feel like, I mean, I, you can see that kind of stuff happening with, like different, like with spice. Like, I'm sure NFT fi. Like, NFT fi. Peer to peer liquidity is because of a lot of the, like, they're the premier choice because of, I feel like, their brand and like, how long they've been doing this and because the people on there are not just like people. Like, I mean, there's probably a few of you, but there's definitely not a lot of me that have like one or two things that are just like looking for, like lending or borrowing on. I'm like, most of that liquidity is probably organizations like fucking goblin sacks or spice that are like doing all kinds of money management via these NFT loans. I'd say the majority of it is.
00:11:26.180 - 00:11:33.488, Speaker B: Or do you think it's individual users? It's like one or two NFts that are grabbing liquidity really quick.
00:11:33.584 - 00:12:16.902, Speaker A: It's, I mean, it's both. I don't know what it's like now, but the statistic from a couple months ago. Was that five? Five entities? Five, like five, I guess, like wallet like groups, like linked. Essentially one organization being one. Five entities make up something like 95% of the lending and borrowing volume and all of an, all of NFT finance and some of that, you know, one, I think I know two of those. Two of those groups. One of them is a person with like a team.
00:12:16.902 - 00:12:35.236, Speaker A: Like an individual who got into this and built a team to help him do it. Another one's an organization. I don't know how that's changed now that this was like well before spice came out and I, before ben daft started offering incentives on lending and borrowing.
00:12:35.388 - 00:12:40.244, Speaker B: But if they do, like season whatever of blur airdrop farming, everyone.
00:12:40.332 - 00:12:43.340, Speaker A: But even blur air drop farming is top heavy.
00:12:43.460 - 00:12:48.440, Speaker B: Like, yeah, but they'll still leave nft file long enough for nft fight to die. I think.
00:12:49.940 - 00:12:53.092, Speaker A: It's tough to say because, like, you.
00:12:53.196 - 00:12:56.358, Speaker B: Why would you stay on nft fire if you can get the, but the.
00:12:56.374 - 00:13:04.966, Speaker A: Thing is, is you're, you're making, you're making assumptions about like market behavior. When it's not market behavior, it's five people's or organizations behaviors.
00:13:05.078 - 00:13:37.766, Speaker B: Like, yeah, those organizations are like the most money hungry, incentive driven people. Like, they have no homage to like NFT five. Whereas like a one user regular person might be like, oh, I love this UI. Like, you know, I've always used NFT file, like, have a connection to it, but like, any that I feel like you're mentioning is just gonna leave for whatever incentives there are. That's why, you see, I feel like, bend out. Get any volume, any liquidity or any volume. It's all just like you said, people.
00:13:37.838 - 00:13:42.918, Speaker A: Volume from, from the incentives who bend.
00:13:43.094 - 00:14:03.930, Speaker B: Yeah, it's all just incentive stuff. And it's all just bored API club holders that are barring against their shit. And then they like cater to those users because they're the biggest ones. And so they give them like ape staking and like a bunch of shit, just like diluting their own token to infinity. What was this?
00:14:05.470 - 00:14:11.910, Speaker A: Sorry, I mean, kind of unrelated, but why did Paris spaces borrow volume skyrocket.
00:14:11.950 - 00:14:59.660, Speaker B: For one way one day? Yeah, I think that was the, um, uh, I'm pretty sure did barimonium. I don't, I don't want to say it was barimonium, but one of the guys from Honeychar was, uh, flexing on like. Or was that caviar that they were doing that on? I don't, I don't really know. I couldn't tell you what Paris spaces are, but it's also like, they're just, I feel like it's just like a copy paste. Like, oh, we'll give you guys ape coins. Apecoin staking. Like you can borrow against blue chips and then, like, what else?
00:15:00.040 - 00:15:00.712, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:15:00.776 - 00:15:04.660, Speaker B: I mean, there's probably gonna be a token.
00:15:05.200 - 00:15:11.920, Speaker A: I'm like a little bit disappointed with Nft five space at this point. I feel like, like it's hard for me to say.
00:15:12.340 - 00:15:13.676, Speaker B: It really fucking sucks.
00:15:13.788 - 00:15:31.988, Speaker A: I mean, but it's like, it was like acceptable for it to suck for a while. And I think we're getting to the point where it's, it's less so. I don't know. I mean, there's just obviously like, it's, it's hard to think.
00:15:32.004 - 00:16:08.030, Speaker B: It's like an over iteration. Like people are just trying to do the same thing slightly different over and over again. I think that's what the problem is. Or at least specifically like lending, borrowing. That's what it feels like. They just do like a slight tweak for like Bendao or NFT five and then that's it. And it's like, why even start whatever this is when there's already so little users for the top protocols in lending and borrowing? You're just gonna make a small tweak and expect to like eat everyone else's market share.
00:16:08.030 - 00:16:11.270, Speaker B: It just seems like wasteful.
00:16:11.610 - 00:16:45.990, Speaker A: I don't think that's the intended goal. I think people, I think people know people. You can say no or assume that NFT finance is gonna be like massive one day. So they see NfT fire bendow or whoever who's been around for a while and been doing okay enough. They see them and they're like, they don't do anything special. There's no edge there. This isn't like a real, like usable product, but it's like all there is.
00:16:45.990 - 00:17:41.240, Speaker A: But there's no more like innovation happening there. There's certain things like requirements that need to be meth before, before, like we can really start to mature on some of these use cases. So let's just, you know, let's just do exactly what they're doing. And then as new things pop up, as conditions start to improve, we can try and be the first ones to adapt and, and, you know, capture market share that way because there, like, there's no way. There's so many lending and borrowing protocols out there that are just so vanilla. There's no, I refuse to believe that, like, there's, we're still this unimaginative you know, that, like, people are just getting into the exact same thing that already doesn't work and expecting it to work for them. Like, they, they have to be.
00:17:41.240 - 00:17:45.600, Speaker A: I just have higher expectations than that, I guess.
00:17:46.630 - 00:17:52.134, Speaker B: What do you mean by already doesn't work? Like, are you saying, like, not that it already.
00:17:52.262 - 00:17:57.310, Speaker A: Not that it doesn't work, but just that it's not useful. It's, it's x.
00:17:57.390 - 00:17:58.170, Speaker B: It's.
00:17:59.150 - 00:18:19.072, Speaker A: At best, it's an opportunity that's easily exploited by a savvy user with a reasonable amount of capital and, I mean, maybe I'm being too harsh. Yeah, I guess maybe I'm being too harsh because I guess it is, like, if with certain collections. Yeah, it is useful.
00:18:19.136 - 00:18:23.656, Speaker B: Like, because we're just not blue chip holders. That's why we're saying it's.
00:18:23.808 - 00:18:49.120, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's, it's not gonna, like, it's, it's not gonna get there for, I don't think it's gonna get there for, like, your longer tail pool of assets. Like, it's. It's just gonna become harder and harder for. For reasonable loans to be offered on most assets on, like, 99% of NFT collections.
00:18:50.260 - 00:19:24.784, Speaker B: Okay, let's NFT fight ecosystem. I feel like both of us had such high hopes for it. Like, two, three months ago, you sold me on it. Like, I really enjoyed it. Like, I was thinking about, like, creating not a whole brand around it, but, like, just making that our whole stick. You know what I mean? Just like, because it felt like, so, I felt so innovative, but now it feels like shit. I mean, like, I was going through that notion and it's like, holy fuck.
00:19:24.784 - 00:20:00.988, Speaker B: Like, I didn't even feel like clicking on or writing like, more than three sentences for any of these play. Like, I was just writing the name and it's like, mid, maybe a token airdrop. Like, that's all I, that's all. Like, any of these are fucking, like, seem, like, useful for, like, spice was really the last thing that I gave a fuck about. I mean, caviar, they're just taking, like, pseudo zero to one, like, innovation and just putting a nicer ui on it, basically making it easier. I don't know, it just sucks. It's just shit.
00:20:00.988 - 00:20:12.220, Speaker B: But let's just. What do you think about, like, the NFTs, like, in general? Do you, uh. You bought some shit yesterday.
00:20:13.160 - 00:20:15.632, Speaker A: Yeah, but it wasn't like, are you.
00:20:15.656 - 00:20:19.020, Speaker B: Thinking of like, are we back?
00:20:19.520 - 00:20:20.096, Speaker A: No.
00:20:20.208 - 00:20:21.080, Speaker B: Should I just.
00:20:21.200 - 00:20:21.552, Speaker A: Everything.
00:20:21.616 - 00:20:23.656, Speaker B: Refresh. Blur, 15 minutes.
00:20:23.848 - 00:20:26.160, Speaker A: Everything. Everything.
00:20:26.240 - 00:20:30.690, Speaker B: Throw on the blur. Throw on the blur. 15 minutes for us real quick.
00:20:31.310 - 00:20:48.770, Speaker A: Okay. Everything that I have that isn't illiquid is, like, pretty much an all time low. So, like, I definitely wouldn't say we're back or any. Or anything close to it.
00:20:49.590 - 00:20:57.450, Speaker B: Do you expect to see the stuff that you have already go up to declare that we're back, or do you expect to see some, like, trend stuff?
00:20:59.050 - 00:21:11.162, Speaker A: I don't know what I expect to see. I mean, it's. It's a Sunday night. I don't think we're gonna see Sunday evening. I don't think we're gonna see anything here. I don't know what I expect to see, but I know that I think.
00:21:11.186 - 00:21:12.830, Speaker B: We should have a mulady, though.
00:21:13.690 - 00:21:16.802, Speaker A: Yeah. I've actually been thinking about getting one as a free.
00:21:16.866 - 00:21:19.030, Speaker B: You should sell your Rengo for milady.
00:21:21.050 - 00:21:27.162, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't. I don't hate the. Yeah, I like that, actually. But rengas are a little bit below that right now, aren't they up here somewhere?
00:21:27.226 - 00:21:27.830, Speaker B: No.
00:21:29.250 - 00:21:38.850, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know what I would like to see or what I would expect to see, but I do know if we just see the same thing that we saw, like, a couple months ago, I'd be pretty disappointed, all things considered.
00:21:38.930 - 00:21:41.430, Speaker B: Like, what do you mean? Trends or.
00:21:42.210 - 00:21:43.322, Speaker A: No, just, like.
00:21:43.426 - 00:21:44.098, Speaker B: Like, meta.
00:21:44.154 - 00:21:58.404, Speaker A: Just, like nothing new, you know, just like some. Some. Some collection popping up. Like this one that I. This one. Like, let's say. Let's say this pumps, like, five x, and then all of a sudden, we see four.
00:21:58.404 - 00:22:04.588, Speaker A: Four derivative collections of that, like, in the top 15, whatever, here on the. On the day.
00:22:04.644 - 00:22:07.200, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. That was disgusting.
00:22:07.500 - 00:22:10.756, Speaker A: Yeah. And then we see that over and over and over again.
00:22:10.828 - 00:22:16.434, Speaker B: Like, I. There's no way we don't see that, by the way. There's no way that doesn't happen for any trend.
00:22:16.602 - 00:22:29.510, Speaker A: What's happening to pudgy presence here, to the rods this thing's taking. Is everything okay, Luca? It's just the rods. For some reason.
00:22:30.650 - 00:22:32.750, Speaker B: You were hoping it was fengement.
00:22:33.730 - 00:22:44.440, Speaker A: No, I mean, I. No, I have nothing. I have nothing bad against. Against pudgies. I honestly. I don't know that they. I don't know that they're, like.
00:22:44.440 - 00:22:53.160, Speaker A: I don't know if they make it to blue chip status. Like, everybody has been, like, assuming. I think it was easy to assume that with, like, the run they had.
00:22:54.580 - 00:22:56.040, Speaker B: No, I think they do.
00:22:56.580 - 00:22:58.480, Speaker A: You think they do? I don't know.
00:22:59.260 - 00:23:13.120, Speaker B: Was it you that was showing me their Instagram? No. Is Josh Siegel take a look at their fucking Instagram before yeah, the way that they're like, you can go on mobile.
00:23:17.660 - 00:23:19.292, Speaker A: Can you see the other tab?
00:23:19.476 - 00:23:21.600, Speaker B: No, but I'm looking at your current tab.
00:23:23.820 - 00:23:24.604, Speaker A: It's all just.
00:23:24.652 - 00:23:26.920, Speaker B: It's all just defy lama.
00:23:29.060 - 00:23:32.116, Speaker A: What am I looking for? Pudgy penguin.
00:23:32.228 - 00:23:33.532, Speaker B: Pudgy penguins.
00:23:33.716 - 00:23:35.040, Speaker A: Pudgy penguins.
00:23:35.460 - 00:23:46.400, Speaker B: It's like a decent, like, uh, it's like a. They're using their brand as like, memes. Like, people who don't even know what an NFC is are like using it as like a cute picture.
00:23:46.980 - 00:23:48.300, Speaker A: Oh, shit. I don't want to.
00:23:48.380 - 00:23:52.988, Speaker B: Decent following. Did you just. Dogs. I'll cut it out.
00:23:53.004 - 00:23:54.720, Speaker A: Not me, but. But someone else.
00:23:57.980 - 00:24:01.400, Speaker B: I mean, what do you think? 300 something thousand followers?
00:24:01.830 - 00:24:05.342, Speaker A: You're gonna have to block that part out, by the way. Whoops.
00:24:05.526 - 00:24:07.694, Speaker B: Wait, I don't even see what part you're talking about.
00:24:07.822 - 00:24:09.490, Speaker A: I kind of like this.
00:24:09.910 - 00:24:18.246, Speaker B: Right? Like, I mean, what's that 2020K likes on a post? It's basically a meme, Pudgy.
00:24:18.278 - 00:24:25.886, Speaker A: Well, look at their followers. Disney, Pixar, Aria, Gucci, like following. Not their followers.
00:24:25.998 - 00:24:28.060, Speaker B: Oh, go to their followers.
00:24:28.520 - 00:24:30.912, Speaker A: They got 360K. But I don't think I'm gonna see.
00:24:30.936 - 00:24:39.580, Speaker B: Anything that's a naughty following. Count for Instagram. For an NFT project.
00:24:40.240 - 00:24:44.780, Speaker A: I don't see any mention. What about on the website? Because here there's no mention of.
00:24:45.520 - 00:24:47.180, Speaker B: Do you. What do you think about that?
00:24:48.480 - 00:25:05.430, Speaker A: I think for. For something like pudgies, it's perfect for any NFC collection that has a super big emphasis on. On community and brand and vision. You really don't want to make any mention of. Dude, realistically, in a space like that.
00:25:06.370 - 00:25:16.554, Speaker B: What was that one? Like mobile or not mobile game. Like browser game. That was a penguin game. You know what I'm talking about? Club Penguin.
00:25:16.642 - 00:25:18.002, Speaker A: No way. You just freak out.
00:25:18.066 - 00:25:18.666, Speaker B: Club Penguin.
00:25:18.738 - 00:25:19.910, Speaker A: Penguin is called.
00:25:22.110 - 00:25:23.046, Speaker B: You're. You're.
00:25:23.158 - 00:25:25.650, Speaker A: That is such cap. No way.
00:25:27.310 - 00:25:32.374, Speaker B: I did, I did. I forgot that. But no, I think we should have a team. Think they should do this?
00:25:32.462 - 00:25:33.450, Speaker A: Had a team.
00:25:33.990 - 00:25:36.654, Speaker B: Why don't they just build out a club?
00:25:36.822 - 00:25:53.340, Speaker A: What are you. What are they hiring a software engineer for a full time? What do they need a full time what? Meme maker. For this. To ship stuff like this. What.
00:25:54.400 - 00:25:55.784, Speaker B: What the fuck is this?
00:25:55.912 - 00:26:00.100, Speaker A: What does this have to do with. With. With pudgy penguins?
00:26:00.680 - 00:26:03.660, Speaker B: Oh, you like the pudgy penguin trades.
00:26:05.400 - 00:26:16.468, Speaker A: All right, so this is why they'll never be a blue chip. I'm just playing. I don't want to. I don't want to badmouth pudgies because I actually, like, but I. I don't think they get there, to be honest.
00:26:16.524 - 00:26:34.692, Speaker B: The. The bite gans one. Remember I sent you that one? The fully on chain, like, robot looking, blurry images? This dude went into, like, sotheby's by the, like, first few weeks after listing on open sea by game.
00:26:34.756 - 00:26:35.212, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:26:35.236 - 00:26:35.484, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:35.532 - 00:26:43.654, Speaker A: See those things blew up, right? Yeah, yeah. Way. Well, not way down, but they're down, like, they do.
00:26:43.782 - 00:27:00.462, Speaker B: Sold, like, a one of one at Sotheby's for, like, a good amount. Anyway. I think, like, I think your tweet was pretty spot on. Like, let's trade arb for a few weeks and then swing back in nft. I definitely see wish.
00:27:00.646 - 00:27:01.326, Speaker A: I wish.
00:27:01.398 - 00:27:04.038, Speaker B: I think it's gonna happen. I'm hopeful.
00:27:04.134 - 00:27:19.356, Speaker A: If you think it's gonna happen, then now is the perfect time to start placing bets, because everything is down a good 20, 30%. I wish I'd sold my small brain. These things pumped and came back down so fast. I actually don't know how.
00:27:19.428 - 00:27:23.560, Speaker B: How that was just, like, an arb token. That was an arb wall token.
00:27:24.020 - 00:27:24.800, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:27.260 - 00:27:41.540, Speaker B: Any other. Do you think you pick up any other r bolts as, like, things cool off and maybe it does, like, an optimism thing that everyone's expecting it to do. I still have its own moment.
00:27:41.700 - 00:27:48.044, Speaker A: Acid, which is, like, an LSD play. I actually don't like this.
00:27:48.092 - 00:27:48.580, Speaker B: Oh, fuck.
00:27:48.620 - 00:27:53.000, Speaker A: It's down a lot. That's down, like, 20%.
00:27:54.180 - 00:27:55.436, Speaker B: That's not bad.
00:27:55.628 - 00:28:14.936, Speaker A: But it's at. I mean, it's at all time lows since they launched, like, four days ago. Um. I know I probably wouldn't be buying anything on arbitrum right now unless there was, like, another narrative attached to it.
00:28:15.008 - 00:28:20.060, Speaker B: Like, do you like the options? Narrative on chain options?
00:28:20.840 - 00:28:58.880, Speaker A: I don't know enough about it anymore. I used to be, like, tapped in enough to make a decision there, but, like, I. Well, I guess I haven't checked, but my initial response is, like, it's still, like. I feel like if it were usable by now, if it were, like, liquid and, like, a viable trading hedging option, we would know by now. And, like, maybe I just haven't looked. Maybe it's there, but that tells me that it's probably not there. And given that, like, I was first exposed to dopex, like, over a year ago, it's like.
00:28:58.880 - 00:29:03.148, Speaker A: It's like, come on, guys, like, what.
00:29:03.164 - 00:29:04.720, Speaker B: Are we waiting for? Kind of thing.
00:29:05.300 - 00:29:10.948, Speaker A: It's like. I mean, it's the same thing with NFTs or NFT finance, where it's just liquidity is the problem.
00:29:11.044 - 00:29:29.750, Speaker B: Oh, do you think, you think we have, like, I feel like the options, like, the option shit was, like, difficult because you don't have people, like, underwriting and writing these, like, options. Nobody really wants to take the other side.
00:29:30.930 - 00:30:35.178, Speaker A: It's also difficult because, like, like, how do you price a crypto option? Like, there's, there's plenty of models for pricing options against equities, but obviously, like, a crypto asset is fundamentally different from a stock. So, like, the pricing just hat, like, it just by nature, the pricing has to be, like, not solved by now, which is, like, I think I might have told you about this a long time ago, like, if you're enough, if, if you're, like, smart enough with mathematic on that level to be able to more efficiently price, like, crypto options than some of these platforms, which I totally think there are people out there who can. There's like, an infinite ARB opportunity for you until that gets fixed. But I'm not smart enough.
00:30:35.234 - 00:30:40.166, Speaker B: I don't follow to do that. I'm not smart enough to follow, like.
00:30:40.318 - 00:30:52.814, Speaker A: Like the price of an options contract. There's, there's formulas to determine what that price is, and formulas are usually used for, for stocks, and it just, people.
00:30:52.862 - 00:31:10.528, Speaker B: Are, or what the market is willing to pay for it. What, like the platform, I guess, is willing to pay for it or like, what absorbs that liquidity? Or is it actually a person on the other side there's following that pricing or some mathematics.
00:31:10.704 - 00:31:52.634, Speaker A: Well, there is. There is a secondary market. Well, actually, no, there's no secondary markets right now, I don't think, for options, but buying them for something like Dopex, where they have like, x number of calls or puts for whatever every, every epoch, they're pricing them with some, with some model. I don't know what model it is, but they're, they're using some formula to figure out how much each option is worth, which is based off of. If it's an ETH option, it's based off of, like, the price of ETH. Funding rates, I'm sure, play some role. There's like, different volatility measures, stuff like that.
00:31:52.634 - 00:32:04.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, it's a lot of math, and it's like, there's no way that that's, like, correct in my mind. Like, they're, they can't have just figured out how to do that.
00:32:04.674 - 00:32:15.710, Speaker B: I think it partially includes, like, what, what's gonna attract people? What's gonna, like, like, oh, this has to work out for me. Like, this has to be a good trade.
00:32:16.250 - 00:32:24.196, Speaker A: How many people? No, people don't care what, what formula they're using. I don't think unless you're on not.
00:32:24.228 - 00:33:21.720, Speaker B: About what formula they're using, but the formula that produces the price that the formula produces is what users first see in determining whether they enter or not. So if the, if whatever price that dopex puts out is like, whatever pricing comes out of the equation is like, holy shit, it's like a deal. Like there's no way ETH doesn't do this or there's no way bitcoin doesn't do this. I feel like that also plays a factor because it like, draws in more people. Does that make sense? Like maybe if you're betting on what is it eth going to like 2000 versus eth going to zero. Like the clear bet is going to be the most attractive. Like if the odds for it going to zero were the same as the odds for it going to 2000, like you would play the 2000 because it's like a steal.
00:33:22.340 - 00:34:16.760, Speaker A: I don't know. The problem is, is that, number one, there's no secondary markets, no proper secondary markets that are like not OTC. So no matter what you're going to be holding until expiry. And also like opportunities like that are very, very few, if at all, where like it's that obvious of a trade because like, like, yeah, you can go and buy an ETH like 1500 call, I'm sure. And chances are that's, that's gonna clear in the money within the month, but the premium on that is gonna be ridiculously high. And I mean, they're volatile assets. So that's, that's all priced into the, into the option with these archaic formulas, the formulas that don't really work for volatile assets like that.
00:34:18.940 - 00:34:22.080, Speaker B: So pricing problem and a liquidity problem basically.
00:34:22.700 - 00:34:30.360, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And a secondary market having, having a lack of secondary markets too, which is all the same as NFT fi, I guess.
00:34:30.940 - 00:34:31.292, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:31.316 - 00:34:33.236, Speaker A: I was looking at maybe the pricing.
00:34:33.428 - 00:34:45.390, Speaker B: People talking about like NFT file like options, like who the fuck is underwriting that if people won't even do that for Defi.
00:34:47.650 - 00:34:54.270, Speaker A: I actually, I haven't, I haven't looked too deep into, that notion is crazy.
00:34:54.810 - 00:35:30.362, Speaker B: Like if you really look through that shit, like there was one talking about, there's one that's actually looks like kind of decent. They're talking about not bringing only like NFT five esque stuff for nfts, but like for everything for LP, tokens for governance, tokens for insurance, tokens for like, any kind of asset. They had an acronym. Not standard asset. NSA. So, like, every single non standard asset, they're thinking of, like, bringing a. Forget what they're called, but what.
00:35:30.396 - 00:35:31.690, Speaker A: Which platform is this?
00:35:32.950 - 00:35:34.622, Speaker B: Let me see if I can actually find it.
00:35:34.686 - 00:35:36.170, Speaker A: Why does that sound familiar?
00:35:37.910 - 00:35:56.850, Speaker B: Pawn five. Wait. Yeah, it might be pon five. You know, NFT perp is, like, dropping the airdrop. Oh, wait, you can't hear me. I forgot you cannot hear me. What do you mean? Yeah, it's pon five.
00:35:56.850 - 00:36:20.350, Speaker B: Uh, the, um. Their airdrop is, like, live. It's like a monthly infinite airdrop with 1.5 million cap tokens. It's like 0.5% of supply if you go to the leaderboard. Someone spent, like, a thousand fucking ETH on the platform in volume to make, like, one eth.
00:36:20.350 - 00:36:24.670, Speaker B: Like, 1500 ETH in trading volume for one ethnic.
00:36:25.880 - 00:36:38.100, Speaker A: Oh, wait, I did not know this. You'll be rewarded with BNFTP tokens based on trading volume. Convertible. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, cool. Did you get any?
00:36:39.800 - 00:36:53.070, Speaker B: I didn't check if I got any. I was just nft per. I don't even think I. I don't think I put a single trade in NFT perpendic. I was always looking at it, but never actually put one in.
00:36:53.450 - 00:37:25.880, Speaker A: I've been, um. Yeah, I've. I've been. I've been using NFT. I saw this tweet a while ago, which was a really good idea. Um, what I do is on insert. Insert finance, which is like, fractionalized nfTs, I bought, like two or three, like, bored ape like shards, which is like, kind of, I guess, kind of just like being security token board apes.
00:37:25.880 - 00:37:46.540, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, you could say that. Yeah, I bought. I bought, like, exposure to board ape through that. And then for each, like, for each shard I bought, which was like, I don't know, maybe like 0.15 eth, I opened an equivalent amount short on NFT perpendic. So it's, like, close to delta neutral.
00:37:46.540 - 00:37:53.540, Speaker A: And I'm farming air drops on both by doing that, which is pretty cool.
00:37:55.080 - 00:37:58.860, Speaker B: That's a good play. Why don't you tweet about shit like that?
00:38:01.600 - 00:38:05.900, Speaker A: I don't know. I didn't feel like it. Yes. I didn't. Well, I guess I didn't think.
00:38:06.800 - 00:38:13.042, Speaker B: That's like. I don't know. It's pretty interesting. I could see that people.
00:38:13.106 - 00:38:18.154, Speaker A: I also rifted it from this guy who. I forgot what his name was. So if I did, that's all Mc.
00:38:18.282 - 00:38:21.710, Speaker B: Anyways, just put his name at the bottom of the true. The tweet.
00:38:22.810 - 00:38:23.626, Speaker A: That's true.
00:38:23.698 - 00:38:33.802, Speaker B: Inspired by. Oh, I saw that you sent me the ck nft. It is a chrome picture. I gotta send that back to you.
00:38:33.946 - 00:38:35.386, Speaker A: I just. Well, it doesn't matter.
00:38:35.458 - 00:38:36.290, Speaker B: Uploaded something.
00:38:36.370 - 00:38:44.230, Speaker A: Life. Yeah, I just. What? I just was just scrolling through my screenshots and just picked anything that wasn't, like, incriminating or like, identifying.
00:38:45.090 - 00:38:54.270, Speaker B: Yeah. For the. I was thinking about this for so arbitrary. Blanched. Like, what? 2021. 2021. Right.
00:38:55.050 - 00:38:56.898, Speaker A: 2020. I want to say.
00:38:57.034 - 00:39:03.154, Speaker B: You want to see 2020? Let's say 20. Let's say 2021. Or take it, let's say 2021.
00:39:03.202 - 00:39:05.420, Speaker A: 2021, yeah.
00:39:05.540 - 00:39:29.320, Speaker B: Their job came March 2023 to two and a half years post launch for an airdrop. Why do you think people are spazzing out for, like, ZK stuff airdrop when we're most likely a year plus out from getting an airdrop? Or what do you think the timeline is?
00:39:29.950 - 00:39:51.358, Speaker A: But they said they've already said the timelines eat, like, I mean, they say that explicitly. Yeah, they said. They said, well, it's like one follows the other. They said, like, there they will have a token and then they said, like, they'll start the process of decentralizing sequencers when they.
00:39:51.534 - 00:39:53.342, Speaker B: They're never gonna decentralize.
00:39:53.486 - 00:40:08.806, Speaker A: Like a separate announcement. Like, we'll start focusing on decentralizing sequencers a year from. From launch. So it's like an if a then b kind of thing. But people are expecting it to be a year now. Pretty much. People are just spazzing out about.
00:40:08.806 - 00:40:10.214, Speaker A: Because it's easy engage.
00:40:10.262 - 00:40:40.760, Speaker B: Yeah, it's engaging for me. Yeah, I knew that, but I was just trying to, I didn't know that they released a timeline. I was trying to see if you had some thoughts on if. Do you think you want to go harder than. Do you want to try cyber? Like, if you had, like, a fat wallet and like, a fat amount of time, would you dedicate to that? No, I mean, like, what's a korean friend portfolio?
00:40:42.660 - 00:40:45.060, Speaker A: I wouldn't. I don't know.
00:40:45.180 - 00:40:46.604, Speaker B: I would. You think that's worth it?
00:40:46.652 - 00:40:57.042, Speaker A: Seems like a lot of work for payoff. Uncertain payoff. Like, yeah, you can. Yeah, there's people that made millions or ck sinks.
00:40:57.066 - 00:40:58.390, Speaker B: Definitely gonna pay off.
00:40:59.130 - 00:40:59.482, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:59.506 - 00:41:27.820, Speaker B: But not, like, not in terms of price of token, but, like, they already released token up or somewhat of an idea of, like, the tokenomics. Like, they're very, like, they have arbitram esque ethos, in my opinion. And so they have good ethos. So, like, they're, they're not gonna go with, like, a 90%. Like, they're gonna give a good share to, like, an airdrop. Like, it's not gonna be shitty.
00:41:28.680 - 00:41:49.322, Speaker A: I mean, they already, they already announced their token distribution, I think, and Arbitrum did not have a good token distribution, by the way. But it's not about, like, how they structure that. It's more so, like, uh, I just don't think I would hope that a year from now, cyber airdrop isn't as easy as it is now. Like, even, uh, even arbitrum was able.
00:41:49.346 - 00:42:12.520, Speaker B: To catch, but it's not worth, but it's not worth falsely catching people that are regular users. Like, let's say you catch five people that are side billing and one user that's not. And it's just like, a regular user, but you pulled them all together. I don't think that's worth a five side bill that you catch. You don't give a fuck.
00:42:14.180 - 00:42:18.492, Speaker A: It's free money. They can, they can give it to whoever they want or whoever they don't want.
00:42:18.516 - 00:42:20.760, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, but that's, that fucking sucks.
00:42:21.180 - 00:42:22.092, Speaker A: Yeah, it sucks.
00:42:22.156 - 00:42:36.440, Speaker B: That sucks for a user. Yeah, I guess it doesn't matter. But if you're a team building that out and, like, you model it out and in your model, you end up catching more people that are just regular users inside bills.
00:42:37.150 - 00:42:54.014, Speaker A: I mean, our, would you. Pretty effective from what I know. I mean, there was some, there was some collateral damage, but for the most part, is pretty effective. And there's projects actively building cyber resistant infrastructure. So, like, I would not be at all surprised to see that get put to use.
00:42:54.062 - 00:42:55.478, Speaker B: My point is, is that I don't.
00:42:55.494 - 00:42:56.758, Speaker A: Think it goes, I wouldn't cycle.
00:42:56.854 - 00:42:57.718, Speaker B: That's my point.
00:42:57.814 - 00:43:21.064, Speaker A: No, it definitely doesn't go away. But you're, it's, you're putting in all this time and effort for, like, an uncertain reward, essentially. And, like, I'm not, like, there's people who are good at this stuff who, like, would get paid to do it or have been successful in doing it in the last, like, five big airdrops, whereas I haven't.
00:43:21.112 - 00:43:41.582, Speaker B: You don't consider yourself successful. If you showed anybody your airdrop wallet, there'd be, like, counts. But that's definitely, like, all right, I pay you to. I just say that you sign. Could just say, you could just say that you cycle. You get what I'm saying? Like, it. I.
00:43:41.606 - 00:43:48.326, Speaker A: Billing or not billing, that people who are cybilling are doing it across hundreds of wallets. Like, if you're gonna do it, you gotta fucking do it.
00:43:48.358 - 00:43:53.770, Speaker B: It's just, I feel like it's just a time thing. It's not like a knowledge barrier thing.
00:43:54.630 - 00:43:57.766, Speaker A: I would rather spend my time doing other stuff.
00:43:57.798 - 00:44:04.210, Speaker B: Exactly. How much would you have to be paid a month to be a full time side biller?
00:44:05.110 - 00:44:07.850, Speaker A: I'd say miserable job.
00:44:08.350 - 00:44:24.142, Speaker B: Honestly, I take terrible 40 hours a week. Like, nine to five. I take, like, three grand for that. Honestly, three grand a month early on tax. You do that.
00:44:24.166 - 00:44:34.778, Speaker A: You could. You could beat that just by the gains you make from. From the airdrops. If you're cybilling an Airdrop 40 hours a week and you're not coming away.
00:44:34.834 - 00:44:39.230, Speaker B: With at least I'm underestimating what 40 hours a week looks like.
00:44:41.130 - 00:44:44.790, Speaker A: And you're not coming with at least half a mil from that airdrop.
00:44:45.290 - 00:45:04.130, Speaker B: Yeah, but I can only fund so many wallets and do so many things, like, with capital. So it's the idea of having, like, an infinite amount of capital and just being, like, the button pusher and, like, a bunch of different wallets for other people.
00:45:04.510 - 00:45:05.230, Speaker A: You have to pay.
00:45:05.270 - 00:45:06.726, Speaker B: I would do it. I would do.
00:45:06.798 - 00:45:13.390, Speaker A: At least you're choking your. Because you're making so much more than that in the end. Like. Yes.
00:45:13.470 - 00:45:21.240, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, let's say. Let's say, okay, you take, let's say you take, like, you know, fees at the end. Take fees.
00:45:21.400 - 00:45:23.904, Speaker A: Okay, then. Then, yeah, then we can talk.
00:45:23.992 - 00:45:44.306, Speaker B: Take, like what? Like, I take 50% of air drop. Yeah, take 50% of airdrop and get, like, three grand a month. That's a great fucking job. Be great with that. Anyway, so are we. Are we gonna sival attack ZK sync the next two, three years post launch?
00:45:44.378 - 00:45:59.710, Speaker A: Definitely not. I will. What I'll do is I'll keep an eye on Zksync the same way I kept an eye on arbitrary. I'll try to at least and anytime, anytime I want to use something new, which is either use a new protocol or buy a new token. I'm just going to make a new wallet.
00:46:00.210 - 00:46:04.450, Speaker B: And that'll should be organic.
00:46:04.610 - 00:46:10.200, Speaker A: That'll be good. Yeah. I'll start using sexes again because I.
00:46:11.580 - 00:46:36.518, Speaker B: Dude, it's actually insanely hard. There is no more on off ramps with Ach wires. At least for, like, the shit that, like, in Australia or New Zealand. Fuck. My mind is blanking. In New Zealand, two biggest exchanges. Fucking OKX, which is disgusting.
00:46:36.518 - 00:46:45.934, Speaker B: And, like, swift x. And the only way you can get on and off is, like, moon pay credit cards. That's basically it. Damn. There's.
00:46:45.982 - 00:46:49.086, Speaker A: But I mean, it's for us. We don't have that problem.
00:46:49.198 - 00:46:54.050, Speaker B: Like, you don't think so. I haven't tried in a while.
00:46:54.710 - 00:47:00.566, Speaker A: I would imagine Coinbase finance, kucoin Kraken just stops.
00:47:00.598 - 00:47:01.054, Speaker B: Ach.
00:47:01.182 - 00:47:02.050, Speaker A: Kraken.
00:47:02.680 - 00:47:07.340, Speaker B: I can just stop the ach. Yep. March they start. I wouldn't tomorrow.
00:47:07.760 - 00:47:09.820, Speaker A: I wouldn't even need to on rip.
00:47:10.400 - 00:47:12.408, Speaker B: Because I'm already offering.
00:47:12.464 - 00:47:15.160, Speaker A: I'm already fully. I'm either one. I'm already.
00:47:15.200 - 00:47:15.976, Speaker B: Well, I off.
00:47:16.008 - 00:47:22.160, Speaker A: I use finance to offer him, but I'm saying I would use sexes to start funding you buy.
00:47:22.240 - 00:47:28.338, Speaker B: Do you offer amp into the crypto.com, cardinal? No, not anymore.
00:47:28.394 - 00:47:35.870, Speaker A: I stopped doing that a long time ago. I offer him. I offer him from binance into my bank account. But I don't do it often.
00:47:37.370 - 00:47:42.706, Speaker B: I finance us. Or do you have a foreign bank?
00:47:42.738 - 00:48:07.466, Speaker A: Finance us? I mean, it's pretty easy. I don't think I. I don't think I've offramped that much money in the past, like, six months. I mean, I don't spend a lot of money, so it's pretty easy generally. And once I can start paying for things like Airbnb and flights with stable coins, I'm not gonna be off ramping much at all.
00:48:07.578 - 00:48:21.690, Speaker B: Like, you should have armed. Shoulda armed an Airbnb with USDC. Imagine that during the Deepak. Imagine doing real life shit like that with the USDC defagging.
00:48:22.190 - 00:48:26.570, Speaker A: I wish. Dude. There's, um.
00:48:27.070 - 00:49:04.352, Speaker B: Should we pay attention to ordinals at all? I had that on the list. Like the barrier to entry in terms of. No, but I really like that. The, uh, I really like the bitcoin ad I was actually writing about that. I mean, I feel like everybody was, but I feel like if you're a marketplace, you should be adding a bunch of chains, should be adding support to everything, everywhere, honestly. But, like, do it better than open sea does. Why do you think magic Eden even gained market share? Did Solana.
00:49:04.352 - 00:49:06.660, Speaker B: Was Solana on open sea before them?
00:49:08.360 - 00:49:11.024, Speaker A: Before them? No.
00:49:11.152 - 00:49:11.656, Speaker B: No.
00:49:11.768 - 00:49:17.720, Speaker A: But magic in Solana used to have a thriving NFT community. It was like one of the best things about it.
00:49:18.940 - 00:49:50.622, Speaker B: Oh, did you see the d guides? They're charging 33% trading fees. If you don't switch from Solana to Polygon by the end of, and then Solana to etherium by the end of, I think, the 27th or the end of this month. He's getting a shit ton of heat for that. But, I mean, it's like the marketing play that he does. 33. That was indeed just under.
00:49:50.726 - 00:49:52.730, Speaker A: Just under one bitcoin floor.
00:49:53.430 - 00:50:17.608, Speaker B: That was insane. That launch was insane. He raised like, a quick, like, 4 million on, like, 500 pieces. Like four and a half million dollars or something ridiculous like that. They're. They're an a plus fucking brand. And then in this space, I actually.
00:50:17.664 - 00:50:20.940, Speaker A: I guess I know that. I think that I don't really pay attention to many.
00:50:25.400 - 00:50:34.990, Speaker B: He's doing a lot of brands. You should pay attention to him. The Frank D guards, at least is something you should be looking at.
00:50:36.810 - 00:50:49.670, Speaker A: Frank D guys do. I've been following my twitter. I don't think I follow my twitter. Frank kind of a father names their child Frank.
00:50:50.530 - 00:50:51.910, Speaker B: That is a shit name.
00:50:53.250 - 00:50:53.762, Speaker A: What's it.
00:50:53.786 - 00:51:10.110, Speaker B: What's his twitter? Frank D guys. But, um, ordinal stuff. Do you give a fuck about that at all? What do you. What have you given a fuck about this week?
00:51:11.010 - 00:51:34.888, Speaker A: This week? It's been a pretty quiet week for me. I can't even lie. I. I mean, I looked into a couple of. A couple of just, like, random projects and determined that they were not really worth looking into too much further. I looked into some venture stuff, I guess, which was okay.
00:51:35.064 - 00:51:49.010, Speaker B: What do you think the last lull in the market similar to this was? I feel like both of us are kind of bored right now. Not bored, but, like, definitely. It's like, I don't know.
00:51:49.090 - 00:51:53.330, Speaker A: Last week was not nearly as eventful as I expected it to be.
00:51:53.490 - 00:52:17.036, Speaker B: I feel like our, like, dopamine hits that come from, like, this fucking hectic space is just, like, changing the way we consume the, like, the news on this stuff. Everyone happy. Everything happens so fast and, like, so big that, like, when nothing happens, we're, like, just bored.
00:52:17.148 - 00:52:18.380, Speaker A: The fuck do I do now?
00:52:18.460 - 00:52:34.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd rather have, like, us, I don't know, another bank collapse and, like, me be bored for the week. I don't know. Is there, was there, like, a lull similar to this?
00:52:35.380 - 00:52:38.520, Speaker A: I feel like. Did you really that. Because I wouldn't remember.
00:52:40.670 - 00:53:21.960, Speaker B: I feel like you would. I feel like I had a. The last lull that I felt was, like, when you previously got me starting to look at, like, nft stuff. Like, and it, like, when I first started, like, paying attention to blur airdrop, when you first started texting me about that, like, that period, like a week or two during that, I was like, lot of macro shit happened, which is similar to what's happening now. And then, like, there was, like, a lull. And the obvious play from then till now was like, I mean, there were some NFT plays that are less obvious. But like, LSD's was obvious.
00:53:21.960 - 00:53:39.810, Speaker B: AI coins was obvious. What else? Or Richmond arbitrary ecosystem coins? Well, that's like a timeline thing. It's like no one, neither of us would have ever known that they were gonna drop like within a week.
00:53:40.510 - 00:53:42.254, Speaker A: Yeah, it's true.
00:53:42.422 - 00:53:50.530, Speaker B: And we would have been too spread out, like trying to buy arbitrary potential drop that we, I thought would be in the summer.
00:53:54.630 - 00:53:55.766, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
00:53:55.798 - 00:54:01.858, Speaker B: I mean, I saw Lynn talking about LSD's. You put any?
00:54:01.994 - 00:54:03.498, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I saw that too.
00:54:03.554 - 00:54:05.310, Speaker B: With Shanghai and stuff coming.
00:54:05.890 - 00:54:22.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I have this, this acid token, but I mean, my entry sucks and I'm not. I don't really like it as a long term play. I don't know why Lynn likes it. It's. I can't really. I can't exactly see like small market.
00:54:22.186 - 00:54:24.850, Speaker B: Cap and like a theme or.
00:54:25.990 - 00:54:49.016, Speaker A: That's what I mean. It's like LSD management strategies, basically, which is cool, I guess. I mean, they're built on top of Pendle now, so there's definitely opportunity there. But like Lynn said, she's building like a long term position there, which like, I totally wouldn't be doing that. Like, it's pretty inflationary to start out of.
00:54:49.038 - 00:55:10.720, Speaker B: And you have 500 paid sums and you can probably like, get the value of like a thousand of them with like one call saying that you're building a long term position somewhere. I don't think that fits in her ethos, but I mean, I wouldn't be surprised. Like, I don't really trust anybody on CT.
00:55:11.500 - 00:55:24.478, Speaker A: It wasn't a big, like, notice. It was just something I picked up on because I'm watching that project too. I don't think it was like a big thing. She shilled or anything. Um, but yeah, I don't know.
00:55:24.494 - 00:55:28.966, Speaker B: What was the bank list shit you were talking about on Twitter? Got to ask you about that.
00:55:29.038 - 00:55:33.850, Speaker A: Oh, bankless is. No, dude. Like, it seems like they're just specifically, um.
00:55:34.350 - 00:55:35.726, Speaker B: David offer.
00:55:35.878 - 00:55:38.566, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, he's just firing for no reason.
00:55:38.638 - 00:55:41.542, Speaker B: Like, about, like, avalanche and like, Solana.
00:55:41.606 - 00:55:45.850, Speaker A: Yeah, about avalanche and solana and like, it's like, dude, like.
00:55:48.090 - 00:56:06.510, Speaker B: Did you see Zack XBT? He said that like, a giant majority of avalanche TPS comes from. Or transactions in general comes from, like, North Korea, north korean hackers. Offloading and offloading. Bitcoin on table.
00:56:07.570 - 00:56:08.910, Speaker A: It's kind of funny.
00:56:09.330 - 00:56:16.240, Speaker B: Yeah, but no, I think. What are you in a Solana? An avalanche supporter? Is that why?
00:56:16.940 - 00:56:29.620, Speaker A: Dude, I have. I probably. I don't think there's anyone who has put as much time and energy into the space as I have without even touching about avalanche. I not even, like.
00:56:29.660 - 00:56:30.276, Speaker B: I don't get it.
00:56:30.308 - 00:56:31.340, Speaker A: Tell you a single.
00:56:31.420 - 00:56:32.680, Speaker B: I don't get it.
00:56:32.980 - 00:56:41.440, Speaker A: I can tell you read. I can tell you, uh, there's a. There's something called a subnet.
00:56:41.860 - 00:56:43.880, Speaker B: That's what I was gonna ask you what it was.
00:56:44.180 - 00:57:00.332, Speaker A: That's all I know about it. I don't give any shits about avalanche. Solana. I was actually recently thinking, I'm gonna start buying Solana. It's just the bridging opportunities suck, and I don't really want to use a sex, but. Yeah, I don't know.
00:57:00.396 - 00:57:07.456, Speaker B: It's a catalyst there. Let's map out this. Trey, why are you buying?
00:57:07.488 - 00:57:12.180, Speaker A: Well, it's been. It's been at a. It's been cheap for a while, I think.
00:57:13.720 - 00:57:14.152, Speaker B: Okay.
00:57:14.176 - 00:57:20.336, Speaker A: I mean, it crashed. It crashed down. Let's go back to the, like, pre FTX.
00:57:20.528 - 00:57:26.064, Speaker B: Was it at pre. Anything above $15 you're overpaying. Anything above ten.
00:57:26.112 - 00:57:29.592, Speaker A: Honestly, it's at 20. Anything above ten?
00:57:29.776 - 00:57:33.260, Speaker B: No, ten is crazy. 15 is, I think, more reasonable.
00:57:34.370 - 00:57:36.350, Speaker A: It's. It's at, like, 20 right now.
00:57:37.130 - 00:57:43.310, Speaker B: What are they. Have they been seeing any TVL growth, some transaction growth, some user growth?
00:57:45.010 - 00:57:49.706, Speaker A: They'll, like, scrap it growth. I couldn't tell you shit about their metro. Let's see.
00:57:49.898 - 00:58:08.830, Speaker B: I like salonic. I think their technology is, like, probably one of the more, like, better shit that's out there. Because they're not just an EVM chain. That's, like, doing nothing. They're actually substantially different and can provide a different kind of solution.
00:58:09.930 - 00:58:14.030, Speaker A: Do you think Moore's. Moore's law. You know, Moore's law is.
00:58:15.610 - 00:58:19.018, Speaker B: I know everyone cites Moore's law. I can't really tell you what it is right now.
00:58:19.074 - 00:59:04.558, Speaker A: I mean, in a nutshell, it's just that, like, data processing power will double every. Was it every year, every two years, something like that. The super, super simple version of the thesis is that if you believe that, like, there's no reason not to buy Solana because it's the only chain out there that directly scales with an increase in computing power. But, like, I mean, that's, like, cool and all, I think I'm. I'm more interested just because I think there's still a lot of good projects building on Solana. Not, like, usable, but name was good teams. And there's.
00:59:04.558 - 00:59:06.038, Speaker A: Huh. Teleport.
00:59:06.094 - 00:59:06.982, Speaker B: Name one.
00:59:07.166 - 00:59:10.798, Speaker A: Name one. Teleport.
00:59:10.934 - 00:59:12.330, Speaker B: I couldn't name what?
00:59:13.150 - 00:59:16.654, Speaker A: What? There's a good number of gaming projects, faraway games.
00:59:16.742 - 00:59:19.280, Speaker B: I don't think teleport is on the Defi.
00:59:19.320 - 00:59:23.192, Speaker A: Llama teleports. Not. I mean, they're not. That's. They're not live.
00:59:23.256 - 00:59:25.264, Speaker B: They're. They're okay.
00:59:25.352 - 00:59:41.700, Speaker A: Like, when I say early, like, I'm talking, like, shit you're not gonna find or hear about or be able to get exposure to. And I like. I like their. I mean, this is, like, dumb, maybe, but I like their dev community, like, on Twitter and shit.
00:59:43.120 - 00:59:45.380, Speaker B: You're on their dev community on Twitter?
00:59:45.690 - 01:00:06.530, Speaker A: I mean, I hear. I see them every now and then. And also, I saw this tweet the other day that was, like, for every outage that Solana has had, it was caused by, like, some specific issue, and each time they, like, patched that hole and moved on, it's just. Holes keep popping up. But I like that. I like that shit out of. Out of it, I think.
01:00:06.570 - 01:00:16.160, Speaker B: I don't think that's true. They're not all different. I feel like. Okay, well, I have no supporting information.
01:00:17.460 - 01:00:19.228, Speaker A: Neither of us knows what we're talking.
01:00:19.324 - 01:00:29.880, Speaker B: I have no supporting information, but that seems very convenient. You know what I mean? You don't think so at all? Like, you have no doubt. You're just like, all right, that's it.
01:00:30.500 - 01:00:51.742, Speaker A: No, I mean, my mind is, if they keep. If they keep fucking up and they keep coming back, they gotta be doing something right. Like, these. These devs aren't just sitting around doing nothing. Like, it's the chains coming back up there. They're still going at it. So, like, I don't know.
01:00:51.742 - 01:00:57.330, Speaker A: I'd imagine. I'd imagine. It's not all smoke and mirrors.
01:00:57.990 - 01:00:59.046, Speaker B: It's definitely not.
01:00:59.158 - 01:01:04.606, Speaker A: Salon is 12th at TVL discuss. It's below defy.
01:01:04.678 - 01:01:11.618, Speaker B: Disgusting. It's disgusting. Did you see people talking about this kava chain, machina, a while ago?
01:01:11.674 - 01:01:30.618, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's. I think that's inflated completely. I looked into it. I thought about going there, but it's. It's like one of those weird, like, anomalies and, like, the news cycle where, like, something shows up and people think it's new, but it's not new. And because it's not new, it doesn't actually mean what it says. And the hype is already there.
01:01:30.618 - 01:01:35.388, Speaker A: So it's like. Like, unless something new has come out in the past, like, two weeks that.
01:01:35.404 - 01:01:45.140, Speaker B: I haven't seen, but somebody's coming out with an EVM chain or an EVM bridge. EOS April 14. I don't know why I know that. I don't know why.
01:01:45.220 - 01:01:48.132, Speaker A: Yeah, I heard he was doing like a rebrand kind of thing.
01:01:48.156 - 01:01:51.520, Speaker B: They're doing EVM bridge next month.
01:01:52.380 - 01:01:53.316, Speaker A: Good for them.
01:01:53.428 - 01:01:54.828, Speaker B: If you want some eos.
01:01:55.004 - 01:01:56.810, Speaker A: Finally make things right.
01:01:56.980 - 01:02:06.490, Speaker B: Near at 19. That's gross. Apparently people farm substantially on Algorand. Say, you that was doing that.
01:02:07.070 - 01:02:08.130, Speaker A: Algorand?
01:02:08.630 - 01:02:09.478, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:09.654 - 01:02:12.118, Speaker A: Makes you think I was farming on Algorand.
01:02:12.294 - 01:02:25.080, Speaker B: I forget. Somebody I know was farming on algorithms. Like, they apparently have decent yields somewhere. TVL is climbing. Mandy. Algorithm might be the next.
01:02:25.380 - 01:02:29.668, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, I heard TVL was at an all time high not long ago, and I was really confused when I.
01:02:29.684 - 01:02:32.660, Speaker B: Heard it almost to find an answer.
01:02:32.700 - 01:02:33.280, Speaker A: Why?
01:02:33.940 - 01:03:03.710, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think. I think maybe there's an lsd play that comes along next couple weeks, but I don't know, I feel like this is the perfect time for us to find something. Find something with, like, some supporting. Like, not supporting docs, but, like, I don't know, more than just like, a feeling. Give the people something, Ellie.
01:03:04.650 - 01:03:17.982, Speaker A: Identify when stuff's quiet is hard. And VC, I mean, I don't think that's valuable to everything we've talked about before.
01:03:18.046 - 01:03:18.582, Speaker B: I think that.
01:03:18.606 - 01:03:42.198, Speaker A: That it's too. It's too lagging. Like, it doesn't. It's not gonna affect. Unless the only thing that would directly affect, like, what. What you and I could trade would be like a big. A big funding round for a project that's already liquid or, like, web averse, getting, you know, getting a.
01:03:42.198 - 01:03:46.328, Speaker A: Closing a huge round and then getting hacked or exploited.
01:03:46.504 - 01:04:02.260, Speaker B: Do you think? I. I do. Like, the synthetix play, like, not the protocol of synthetics, but, like, the synthetic assets. Because you remember mirror on us around Luna. I remember. That was fun. People were doing so many strategies there.
01:04:02.260 - 01:04:04.580, Speaker B: That was a cool time.
01:04:05.160 - 01:04:06.568, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
01:04:06.704 - 01:04:24.150, Speaker B: I think if we find, like, a good synthetix application, that would be awesome, but everyone feels like they're gonna go to jail if they do that for valid. Do you think GMX does synthetics? Wasn't there rumors they do that?
01:04:26.530 - 01:04:32.418, Speaker A: I don't know. I. Synthetix is like. I don't understand. I don't understand enough about that space.
01:04:32.474 - 01:04:34.470, Speaker B: Which is like, just a virtual.
01:04:35.340 - 01:04:42.788, Speaker A: Why can't. Why can't you just use Oracle's? Like, why can't you just do oracle trading and, like, just trade wheat futures or whatever the hell you want?
01:04:42.844 - 01:04:45.788, Speaker B: I think that's what they do, though. Just like virtual amm.
01:04:45.884 - 01:04:51.840, Speaker A: That seems so easy. Why has no one done it yet? Why can't they just have infinite liquidity and just, just honor the price of.
01:04:52.380 - 01:05:31.370, Speaker B: Size, I think because it all comes well, the virtual amm is like separate from the pricing oracle. Like they have to come up with their own way to like filter out data so that they don't fuck up the amm. Basically I was looking on to like how like NFT perp did this and it's like to each their own kind of thing. Each decks has their own or each protocol would have their own way of doing the oracle. I mean like, but I feel like with stocks, like you said, it can't be that hard. Like there's stock information everywhere that's like not really movable. Like an NFC is.
01:05:31.370 - 01:05:46.090, Speaker B: So. Yeah, I like the synthetix. Not specifically that protocol, but like I like that protocol idea happen, I think.
01:05:46.430 - 01:06:05.002, Speaker A: All right, here's my, here's my take, my uninformed take. Um, I think things stay quiet for a little bit. Things stay quiet for a little bit. We go down. We go down a good bit more than people think.
01:06:05.106 - 01:06:08.150, Speaker B: That's consensus though. I disagree.
01:06:08.770 - 01:06:10.630, Speaker A: It's consensus that we go down.
01:06:10.930 - 01:06:20.150, Speaker B: To me I feel like it's consensus. I feel like we're sitting in like a pretty solid place right now. I mean, what's bitcoin at like twenty eight k?
01:06:21.310 - 01:06:25.158, Speaker A: I don't know. Oh, we're not even that low.
01:06:25.334 - 01:06:26.326, Speaker B: That's what I'm saying.
01:06:26.438 - 01:06:28.210, Speaker A: 17. 1770.
01:06:28.910 - 01:06:30.086, Speaker B: Yeah, we're at 28.
01:06:30.158 - 01:06:33.038, Speaker A: Why are people so bare? I guess it's just cuz shit's boring.
01:06:33.214 - 01:06:40.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we just like chill for a bit and then we just fucking perform.
01:06:41.550 - 01:06:56.940, Speaker A: 20%. Up 20% in the past week. I have to unfollow this fucking frank guy. Tell me tweets this. You didn't tell me tweets this much. I just followed him and my feet already has like four tweets for him.
01:06:57.560 - 01:07:12.596, Speaker B: You know, I think. I think. I think we just chop. Like I feel like this is our new range now. Like we won't see below like 24 and we won't see higher than like 30 for like the next like nine months.
01:07:12.768 - 01:07:14.040, Speaker A: So nfts.
01:07:14.700 - 01:07:16.520, Speaker B: So nFts. Yeah.
01:07:17.380 - 01:07:34.600, Speaker A: So what I said from the beginning, one of my friends, I totally forgot he sent me his like whole thesis on redacted. And I was supposed to respond but I forgot. And I feel really bad because you put a lot of work into this, but you think he'd be mad if we talked about it now?
01:07:34.940 - 01:07:36.740, Speaker B: Steal his whole thesis? Yeah.
01:07:36.900 - 01:07:40.520, Speaker A: No, not steal his whole thesis, but I'll give him credit.
01:07:41.070 - 01:07:41.894, Speaker B: Yeah, go.
01:07:42.022 - 01:07:42.782, Speaker A: I actually. Don't know.
01:07:42.806 - 01:07:43.486, Speaker B: Do you have time?
01:07:43.598 - 01:07:49.570, Speaker A: This is. This is like in depth. No, I don't have time, actually. We should wrap up soon.
01:07:50.870 - 01:08:03.302, Speaker B: I got up on the scene. Any calls you want to make, send it to me. I'll look at it. Yeah. Anything you want to, like for your future self next week?
01:08:03.486 - 01:08:10.294, Speaker A: The edgy. The edgy scribbly art thing, whatever that was. What's that called? Dark thoughts.
01:08:10.462 - 01:08:13.614, Speaker B: Oh, dark thoughts, yeah, that's going.
01:08:13.662 - 01:08:18.190, Speaker A: That's going to. For 8th by, you know, what's blur.
01:08:18.230 - 01:08:21.078, Speaker B: Volume looking at now, anyways? Is that on device?
01:08:21.174 - 01:08:35.736, Speaker A: There is no blur volume. I mean, there is blur volume, but it's. It's all forming. What is the token, the blur? Oh, that's a good question. I don't know. I forgot Blur had a token.
01:08:35.768 - 01:08:38.480, Speaker B: I remember I said, I buy under $0.60. Right?
01:08:38.640 - 01:08:44.220, Speaker A: It's under $0.60. It's been under $0.60 for almost a week.
01:08:46.520 - 01:08:48.820, Speaker B: Damn. Do you think that's what happens with arbitra?
01:08:49.840 - 01:08:54.192, Speaker A: You always say you'll buy something under some price, and then it goes under that price. And you never actually.
01:08:54.216 - 01:09:00.870, Speaker B: I never do. No, I buy blur. What are we at, 53?
01:09:01.530 - 01:09:02.914, Speaker A: You're just gonna lower your.
01:09:03.082 - 01:09:09.270, Speaker B: We're not gonna see 50. I would buy blur here. I'm calling it. I'm calling it right here.
01:09:09.770 - 01:09:10.950, Speaker A: Then buy it.
01:09:11.650 - 01:09:31.229, Speaker B: I have no. I have no fucking money. I mean, I might go on like Arb. I have some gains on arbitrary, but I'm just waiting for my, you know, my indicator to tell me to sell eth, but it still has it. It was on the two day. It came up, but it hasn't come on on the three day or the weekly. So we're good for now.
01:09:33.409 - 01:09:38.257, Speaker A: All right, here's my call. Here's my strategy. That I would be. I like blur if I was more.
01:09:38.273 - 01:09:39.505, Speaker B: Like, that's my call for the week.
01:09:39.537 - 01:09:57.380, Speaker A: Yeah. I might play blur. Well, I might consider playing blur, but my. I think it's better Eevee to play some of these, like, second tier nfts that seem to have dropped a lot in price for some reason. So, like, mfers, milady's.
01:09:58.480 - 01:10:14.224, Speaker B: No, ladies. Yes. Ring is no. Ladies have the cult out of all. Out of anything on that list. You pick maladies. Ladies, I guarantee they outperform anything on that list.
01:10:14.272 - 01:10:16.540, Speaker A: They have the strongest cult, I think.
01:10:17.920 - 01:10:21.620, Speaker B: But the other ones are bullshit. They're not real cults.
01:10:22.470 - 01:10:39.462, Speaker A: Yes, they are. Mfers. Mfrs is there. It's just they're quieter, I think valhalla. I feel like valhalla is secondary. Like, nobody is a valhalla. First there about how like second or third, they're all as rengas.
01:10:39.526 - 01:10:40.558, Speaker B: I don't know, that are trying to.
01:10:40.574 - 01:10:42.810, Speaker A: Get like, shit about the Rena community.
01:10:43.190 - 01:10:48.896, Speaker B: Exactly. I say, man, you know what? I can't wait.
01:10:49.048 - 01:10:49.856, Speaker A: That's another one.
01:10:49.888 - 01:10:51.100, Speaker B: Dog coins again.
01:10:52.760 - 01:10:55.944, Speaker A: I mean, that was happening on Zk sync, like, right?
01:10:55.992 - 01:10:58.088, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was funny.
01:10:58.264 - 01:10:59.912, Speaker A: Zk. You knew all that stuff.
01:10:59.976 - 01:11:14.850, Speaker B: I mean, I guess someone on the manage is one of those accounts, like, was talking shit, like cussed somebody out or like completely obliterated somebody on Twitter with a Zk dog one account. Pretty funny.
01:11:15.270 - 01:11:22.166, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw that. It was like. It was like, no, actually, don't repeat it on stream.
01:11:22.198 - 01:11:23.130, Speaker B: Can't. Definitely.
01:11:23.950 - 01:11:33.690, Speaker A: It was actually really fucked up. I remember what it was. But, like, people. People were responding to, like, the screenshot and they're like, oh, that's base. And then they posted like a screenshot of them following.
01:11:36.350 - 01:11:50.820, Speaker B: The token. Probably appreciated like 60% at least post that tweet. Yeah, that's the worst part. Oh, wait, let's look at my matic call. Didn't I say matic back to like, zero?
01:11:52.080 - 01:11:53.880, Speaker A: I mean, you're always calling back to zero.
01:11:53.920 - 01:12:04.980, Speaker B: I can't keep their down. Let's look at the weekly. They're down close to 8% on the week since. I mean, I've been wanting.
01:12:06.680 - 01:12:09.600, Speaker A: Eth terms. Not in bitcoin terms. E terms.
01:12:09.760 - 01:12:12.600, Speaker B: Oh, let's do that.
01:12:12.760 - 01:12:17.340, Speaker A: They're also down in eth terms because they're shit.
01:12:19.520 - 01:12:19.976, Speaker B: Terms.
01:12:20.048 - 01:12:24.600, Speaker A: They're probably down in bitcoin. I would be. You know, maybe. Maybe we buy Maddox soon.
01:12:24.640 - 01:12:26.512, Speaker B: This is getting fuck, no.
01:12:26.616 - 01:12:31.184, Speaker A: Coming down to a pretty well, actually. Not really.
01:12:31.272 - 01:12:37.550, Speaker B: No, not Maddock. Back to $0.80. Didn't like four weeks.
01:12:39.290 - 01:12:47.510, Speaker A: Six weeks goes back to $0.80. Within four weeks, eth goes back to 1600 at least. At most.
01:12:48.370 - 01:12:51.550, Speaker B: Stop associating Matic with ease.
01:12:52.810 - 01:12:58.418, Speaker A: I'm not associating them together. I'm just. I'm just saying the only way Matic goes that low is if the rest of the market.
01:12:58.474 - 01:13:05.670, Speaker B: That's like saying matic is gonna pull down bitcoin. It's bitcoin that goes down and Matic is going to go down afterwards.
01:13:06.690 - 01:13:08.990, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but one doesn't have.
01:13:09.530 - 01:13:16.938, Speaker B: If Matic is just a shit project, they'll just go down by themselves, is what I'm saying. That's not going to happen. And no one else will be affected.
01:13:16.994 - 01:13:28.350, Speaker A: Without some big news. That is definitely not going to happen. That rarely happens with, like, a top 20 coin. I think that it just tanks on its own without any news.
01:13:29.590 - 01:13:30.330, Speaker B: Watch.
01:13:31.910 - 01:13:32.686, Speaker A: We'll see.
01:13:32.798 - 01:13:39.410, Speaker B: I mean, I'm not saying there's not gonna be any news. I think the news is they run out of money and they don't produce anything. Cky, you think they.
01:13:41.430 - 01:13:43.810, Speaker A: Okay, we'll see.
01:13:45.310 - 01:13:59.870, Speaker B: Anyways, that's the end of the pod. I say buy blur short matic and buy em a lady. That's all you need to do this week. That's how we should close off the episodes weekly.
01:14:00.290 - 01:14:12.350, Speaker A: Actually, I actually kind of like that. Except we definitely have to disclaimers, not financial advice. You just put that in the. In all the. All the channels, all the socials, and that'll probably get the point across.
01:14:13.890 - 01:14:15.586, Speaker B: Fuck it. Let him do it.
01:14:15.778 - 01:14:22.786, Speaker A: What's my advice? What's my advice right now? I'm gonna. I'm gonna be a contrarian and I'm gonna say, is there someone in your.
01:14:22.818 - 01:14:24.560, Speaker B: Room or the hallway or something?
01:14:24.640 - 01:14:25.368, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:25.544 - 01:14:26.380, Speaker B: Okay.
01:14:33.480 - 01:14:45.984, Speaker A: I'm gonna say stables are king this week, but shitty staples. So I'm just. I'm just pulling this straight.
01:14:46.032 - 01:14:47.968, Speaker B: I like this. So like Lusd.
01:14:48.144 - 01:15:05.910, Speaker A: So. No, no, no. See, what you're going to do is you're going to go. To go to y two k and you're going to provide liquidity for the hedge pool against Mim for epic. What am I earning for that? What am I earning for this?
01:15:07.450 - 01:15:17.396, Speaker B: Oh, my God. I have to turn on a VpN to use y two k. Ha. That's constantly annoying. Share screen. I'm curious. Huh? I want to see what, though.
01:15:17.468 - 01:15:27.636, Speaker A: I actually don't know how to use y two k. I know how y two k works. I've never used it before, though. I can't even lie. There's no.
01:15:27.748 - 01:15:30.604, Speaker B: You're banking on a stables collapse now of all time?
01:15:30.652 - 01:15:43.244, Speaker A: No, no, no. You provide for hedge, so you're banking on it not collapsing. Oh, there's like, no liquidity in this thing. Oh, just like a week. What's. No, not even a week.
01:15:43.332 - 01:15:46.452, Speaker B: Like, what's the return? Over a week? Over five.
01:15:46.556 - 01:15:58.400, Speaker A: Well, none of these are. None of these are live right now. But in the past for fracs, it was 18%.
01:16:00.820 - 01:16:05.480, Speaker B: For betting on 18% in five days.
01:16:05.860 - 01:16:09.694, Speaker A: Yeah, that's any position.
01:16:09.742 - 01:16:11.770, Speaker B: Wait, no. Is that a pr if you.
01:16:12.510 - 01:16:26.046, Speaker A: No, no, you're not making 20% in five days. You're making. You're making 20% apr. Forget I said anything. I was trying to be quirky, backfiring.
01:16:26.158 - 01:16:27.790, Speaker B: Give us the week.
01:16:27.910 - 01:16:34.608, Speaker A: I don't think we buy anything this week, really. Consolidate. You consolidate where? Your convictions stronger.
01:16:34.784 - 01:16:38.368, Speaker B: And I turned you into a full bear within, like, six.
01:16:38.464 - 01:16:45.152, Speaker A: No, I'm not saying sell, because I have. I have a lot of holdings, so I wouldn't be selling any.
01:16:45.336 - 01:16:50.140, Speaker B: I would just consolidate. Into what? High conviction or, like, high market cap.
01:16:51.680 - 01:16:52.784, Speaker A: High conviction.
01:16:52.912 - 01:16:56.776, Speaker B: So, like, give us some high conviction. No beating around the bush.
01:16:56.808 - 01:17:08.478, Speaker A: Holy gearboxes. A couple of NFTs maybe if you got squiggle money. Always, always a good time to be buying a squiggle. What else?
01:17:08.534 - 01:17:11.930, Speaker B: I kind of want to sell my arb to buy a milady right now. Is that bad?
01:17:14.150 - 01:17:21.450, Speaker A: Do you think the ladies outperform arm within a week? It's a tough question. Are you gonna rotate within a week?
01:17:22.030 - 01:17:37.328, Speaker B: I don't even think that play out performs east within a week. But, no, I just. I know Arb is easy. $3. That's the thing. I know as soon as I sell it, I'll go to $3.
01:17:37.424 - 01:17:44.300, Speaker A: Who knows how long it's gonna take? I don't know if it gets there soon. I think Arb is easy.
01:17:45.000 - 01:18:00.310, Speaker B: It's programmed at $3, but I don't know about $3. It's never going below a dollar, and it's programmed at three. Give us a call, man. Give us a very specific call. I gave. I gave exact names and tokens. I give exact financial.
01:18:00.310 - 01:18:08.346, Speaker B: Give us something. Then. No one's gonna watch this gearbox.
01:18:08.418 - 01:18:09.426, Speaker A: We'll say gearbox.
01:18:09.538 - 01:18:10.818, Speaker B: Gearbox. Within a week.
01:18:10.954 - 01:18:15.498, Speaker A: Okay, but just a good time to add to the gearbox bag.
01:18:15.674 - 01:18:23.480, Speaker B: Add to the gearbox bag this week. Do you have an NFT one? Are you still on the gen art wave?
01:18:25.540 - 01:18:41.040, Speaker A: Generates pretty cheap right now. I wouldn't be mad about buying any gen art if I were to recommend one. Please don't say mfers are at a good price. I think, honestly.
01:18:41.340 - 01:18:43.370, Speaker B: What are they, Athenae?
01:18:43.440 - 01:18:44.150, Speaker A: They're at a.
01:18:44.230 - 01:19:05.210, Speaker B: .89 oh, what's the one that, um, that we looked at with the weird, like, art? The. It was around milady Price. I'm blanking on the name. That one. It's like a. I'm losing my mind right now.
01:19:05.210 - 01:19:36.020, Speaker B: It's like a lady arthem. No, it's not Meladie art. It's. How do I have to connect my wallet to blur to search? Anyways, it's like the scream image almost. It's like very neon colors. What the fuck is it called now? This is gonna hurt my gun wrecked guy. What are they sitting at.
01:19:36.020 - 01:19:42.460, Speaker B: Holy shit. Lenses at $283 for a profile?
01:19:43.360 - 01:19:51.620, Speaker A: Pretty expensive. Because especially. I mean, they're gonna open it up to everyone at one point. So it's just speculation for the airdrop right now.
01:19:53.080 - 01:20:07.190, Speaker B: So I should wait. I should. Bought one a long time ago. Wrecked guy. Let's see what they're saying. Yeah, it's one of those ones, like, along with milady. Kind of like 200 something volume.
01:20:07.190 - 01:20:20.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think Rex guy at half an 8th is an auto bar. And you buy a malady now.
01:20:20.186 - 01:20:24.698, Speaker A: Yeah, they're .8 down to half an.
01:20:24.714 - 01:20:32.072, Speaker B: E. They don't have. They don't have enough use case as a milady does have enough traction.
01:20:32.176 - 01:20:34.680, Speaker A: Enough use case? What use case?
01:20:34.720 - 01:20:54.016, Speaker B: Lady has a lot of use case. Did you see the fucking malady game that someone is making? It literally looks like a better version of fortnight. Holy fuck. Hold on, I have to show this. I get to eat in like a few minutes. And why there's no shot. I find it, but it's like a full fledged video game.
01:20:54.016 - 01:21:13.610, Speaker B: Like a PvP video game. It's actually insanely cool. It's like an anime style, but also like Call of Duty. Milady maker probably tweeted it, I think. Yeah, I think milady is like. Do you consider milady a blue chip?
01:21:14.110 - 01:21:21.086, Speaker A: No. The fuck what? You have way too loose of a.
01:21:21.118 - 01:21:22.558, Speaker B: Melody'S definitely a fucking.
01:21:22.614 - 01:21:25.210, Speaker A: There's three blue chips that exist right now.
01:21:27.720 - 01:21:30.580, Speaker B: Okay, name the three. I guarantee you end up naming five.
01:21:31.160 - 01:21:33.820, Speaker A: Board apes, punks, Azuki's.
01:21:35.080 - 01:21:43.912, Speaker B: You left out chrome chromies, squiggles, or whatever the fuck. So there's four. And are you not putting d guides as blue chip?
01:21:44.056 - 01:21:57.018, Speaker A: D gods are not blue chips. I don't even know. Did I even. What is it d God worth? I can ballpark what all those first three are worth. Off the top of my head, I can't tell what a d got. Is the gods on Ethereum. You're not about to tell me that.
01:21:57.018 - 01:21:58.898, Speaker A: It's going to be on eth main net.
01:21:58.954 - 01:22:00.482, Speaker B: They're going to be.
01:22:00.666 - 01:22:02.698, Speaker A: You're not about to tell me that a collection not on.
01:22:02.754 - 01:22:29.396, Speaker B: Dude, you saw the BTC guys are selling for one bitcoin. Okay, first of all, it's one thing to sell those things for a value of a bitcoin. It's another thing to get fucking people on bitcoin. Get people to actually use it. You see how many people are auctioning there? Hi. If D guys is not a blue chip, I'm sorry, there's no brand.
01:22:29.508 - 01:22:33.012, Speaker A: There's just price. It's not just price and hype.
01:22:33.036 - 01:22:34.404, Speaker B: It's, yeah, it's a brand need to.
01:22:34.412 - 01:22:49.410, Speaker A: Be able to sustain it. They haven't sustained it yet. They've been doing cool shit for. In the recent and recent memory. Sure. But they haven't, they haven't actually, like, they haven't backed it up with I gained the trust yet.
01:22:50.030 - 01:22:56.894, Speaker B: I disagree. I think, I think, I think D guys outperform apes next bull run.
01:22:56.942 - 01:22:59.838, Speaker A: That doesn't make. That does, that doesn't make them a blue sign.
01:22:59.894 - 01:23:00.702, Speaker B: Seal and deliver.
01:23:00.766 - 01:23:02.982, Speaker A: It may, maybe they do.
01:23:03.046 - 01:23:03.598, Speaker B: You disagree?
01:23:03.654 - 01:23:05.610, Speaker A: Outperform doesn't make them a blue chip.
01:23:06.830 - 01:23:09.130, Speaker B: Yes, it does. How does it not?
01:23:09.790 - 01:23:39.850, Speaker A: Blue chip isn't performance. Blue chip is as image and it's value retention, I think likelihood of value retention, if it is much, much, much less likely that that, like, like, sure, maybe D gods outperform, but there's a greater chance that they underperform ETH or some other asset, whereas bored apes or punks underperforming is like, practically not possible.
01:23:41.510 - 01:23:46.530, Speaker B: Board apes and punks underperforming Eth not possible over the next bull run.
01:23:46.950 - 01:23:47.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:23:47.710 - 01:23:51.510, Speaker B: Mmm. I put, I would say they're, they're the only.
01:23:51.670 - 01:23:57.118, Speaker A: They're the only two undisputed. I don't want to put apes in that category, but I have to.
01:23:57.174 - 01:23:59.610, Speaker B: Don't put it. I think apes get rich.
01:24:00.430 - 01:24:03.810, Speaker A: Apes have to be there. Yeah, I guess they could.
01:24:05.570 - 01:24:07.754, Speaker B: Yeah. I think that's what happens.
01:24:07.882 - 01:24:08.658, Speaker A: But they have anyway.
01:24:08.674 - 01:24:09.750, Speaker B: I gotta go eat.
01:24:10.690 - 01:24:11.470, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:24:13.410 - 01:24:19.970, Speaker B: Oh, are you hungry? I'm sure you're just as hungry.
01:24:20.010 - 01:24:21.510, Speaker A: A little famished. Yeah.
01:24:22.610 - 01:24:25.258, Speaker B: That's episode ten. I'll see you.
01:24:25.314 - 01:24:25.586, Speaker A: All right.
01:24:25.618 - 01:24:25.970, Speaker B: See, Ellie?
