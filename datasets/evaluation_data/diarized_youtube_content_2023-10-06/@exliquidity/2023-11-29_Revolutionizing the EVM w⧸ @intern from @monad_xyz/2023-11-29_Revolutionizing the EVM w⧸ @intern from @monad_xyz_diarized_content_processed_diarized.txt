00:00:55.170 - 00:01:08.712, Speaker A: All right. Episode 45 of Exit Liquidity, we got on CMS or intern previously. CMS Intergalactic.
00:01:08.736 - 00:01:12.752, Speaker B: Yeah. Do well, too. Well. How are you guys doing?
00:01:12.816 - 00:01:14.580, Speaker C: Well, thanks for coming on.
00:01:15.680 - 00:01:22.460, Speaker A: Yeah, really appreciate it. Ollie, did you actually ever watch the. His episode on up only?
00:01:23.440 - 00:01:38.400, Speaker C: No. I think I've seen. I think I've seen maybe one crypto podcast, and it was, like, the post. The post, like, FTX fallout one on up only, where they had, like, Martin Shkreli and. And do Kwan.
00:01:38.700 - 00:01:40.124, Speaker B: That one was crazy.
00:01:40.212 - 00:01:52.650, Speaker C: That one was legendary. But besides that, I've never been a big podcast guy. Despite doing 50 episodes. Despite doing 50 episodes of my own. How long ago was that?
00:01:54.310 - 00:01:55.790, Speaker B: The do Kwan one?
00:01:55.950 - 00:01:57.650, Speaker C: No, the one with. The one with you.
00:01:59.190 - 00:02:18.312, Speaker B: That was summer of 2021. It was actually. I wasn't even a guest. I was a co host, really. Crypto, cred, and Don on vacation, so they were bringing on a few co hosts to run it. Yeah, it feels like five years ago.
00:02:18.456 - 00:02:24.140, Speaker C: But, yeah, two years is a long time in this space, for sure.
00:02:24.680 - 00:02:34.100, Speaker A: That'll lead us into, like, a bit more about your. Your background, kind of how you got started in the space, how you got to the up only episode. What was that like?
00:02:34.440 - 00:03:23.080, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I initially. I mean, my first foray in was in, like, the middle of 2017. I was a freshman in college at the time. I studied physics, and there was this pretty crazy kid in my physics class who just kept talking about random shitcoins, and that pulled me in. I was like, what on earth is this? Fell down the bitcoin rabbit hole round, tripped a massive amount for me at the time. And at that point, once you feel the euphoria and once you feel the despair, you kind of have, like, you're emotionally attached, which I think is part of the reason crypto is, like, I don't know, people stick around and care about it so much.
00:03:23.080 - 00:03:53.866, Speaker B: Yeah. So, essentially, like, got in, followed, like, learned a ton about bitcoin. Ethereum, specifically, knew I wanted to work in the space at some point, so, like, was always just trying to find people who actually, like, worked in crypto in some form. Um, I kept that going through college. And then in my last year, uh, I ended up talking to Dan at CMS. Um, talked to him on the phone, for. It was literally a two minute conversation, and I was essentially like, I'll intern for you for free.
00:03:53.866 - 00:04:17.272, Speaker B: I'm going to be doing a bunch of research anyways. Uh, if you can point me in a direction, I'll create it for you. Um, he's like, yeah, no brainer. Let's do it. Um, so I was lucky enough to. To get an internship at CMS, uh, in the, like, towards the end of 2020, and then got hired on full time after that in, like, February of 2021, working.
00:04:17.336 - 00:04:25.064, Speaker A: Were you an intern when you started the intern account, or you full time? Okay, yeah, I started the intern account at that point.
00:04:25.232 - 00:04:55.220, Speaker B: Yeah. So that was in January, essentially. Dan is, like, a hilarious guy, but literally just, like, tweet whatever's on his mind. Um, it kind of, like, not completely, but there were shades of, like, kind of a barstool type of feeling to it. And, like, he was at CMS holdings, and I was like, well, Barstool's got a bunch of characters. Like, it'd be funny if there was, like, an intern, like, replying to. To Dan's tweets and just, I don't know, falling in line with the culture, showing some of what's going on at CMS.
00:04:55.220 - 00:05:13.426, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, I think it was a product of Dan just, like, being open to it. Right. Like, I felt comfortable enough where I was, like, literally as an intern was like, is this okay? Um, he's like, yeah, run with it. Sounds great. Uh, and then, yeah, that kind of. Yeah. Sparked off the intern stuff.
00:05:13.426 - 00:05:17.310, Speaker B: On, uh, for crypto, was there, like, a whole.
00:05:18.290 - 00:05:34.700, Speaker A: Yeah. Was there. Was there a reply moment where you're like, okay, this is going to work? Like, this is. I'm finally in the weeds enough to where I know what's going on. Was there an interaction with anyone big on CT that kind of kickstarted the intern account?
00:05:35.480 - 00:06:13.882, Speaker B: So I would say no. I think it was just a much more gradual type of process. It was just funny from, I don't know, the content. Like, dam would put out this gigabrain, been in crypto forever type thesis. And I would reply with a classic intern, you want a coffee, or should I take notes on this? I'd say, like, two of the main. Like, the two main things that kind of became, like, the staple of what I would put out were, like, notes, which obviously falls in line with being an intern and memes. So, at the time, CMS was like, we need to hire a full time meme guy.
00:06:13.882 - 00:06:22.170, Speaker B: Like, memes are important in crypto. Like, there's no getting around it. And I think they were ahead of the curve on that. And I was the youngest guy at the firm.
00:06:22.210 - 00:06:22.908, Speaker A: Bye.
00:06:22.954 - 00:06:47.192, Speaker B: I don't know, like, there are a bunch of, like, 30, 30 to 35 year old, like, professional traders. And then I at the time, was like, maybe 22. Um, I was like, I'm the youngest guy. Like, I should be the guy, the go to guy for memes. So I had never really created anything before that. Um, yeah, fell, fell into line, started making memes at that point. And, like, those would get a lot of traction.
00:06:47.192 - 00:06:59.070, Speaker B: And then I would note for every up only podcast, and, like, Kobe and Ledger would retweet them sometimes, and that would be like, a lot of traction. So it's like, all right, these are, these are kind of the two main verticals, but, yeah.
00:07:00.770 - 00:07:09.538, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, CMS was a, was that. Or I guess, is it like a hedge fund or like a venture fund? What's their, like, mandate?
00:07:09.714 - 00:07:31.364, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's technically, it's a prop shop. So it's just partner capital. Its about 50 50 split between actively traded funds, like a hedge fund style, and then their venture investing arm. And I worked on the venture investing arm for almost three years, two and a half years for CMS. Yeah.
00:07:31.532 - 00:07:51.120, Speaker C: Damn. Okay. I dont know how much of our podcasts youve seen, but we always like to properly start off with an exit liquidity story. Given your almost decade in crypto, what's been some of your favorite moments where you were exit liquidity?
00:07:55.260 - 00:08:39.638, Speaker B: That's a really good question. A lot of nfts, I would say nfts by far. I think that there's like, I don't know, nfts. A lot of the reason people, like, people get into them and just buy and never sell them. And I think it's a product of, like, when there's an NFT, you only have, like, a lot of time. You just have one of them, and so you don't want to, like, sell because your exposure is either one or zero. So I think a lot of the guys who had a bunch of money would buy like five, and then they could kind of unload it over time, but everyone else, we would just buy one and kind of rat it up.
00:08:39.638 - 00:08:59.486, Speaker B: And then the guys who had a ton would dump, and you're just like, all right, well, I can't sell now. I'm down. So you end up with a lot of guys with one Nft kind of holding the bag. I don't know. I don't think I regret a single NFT purchase, though. Right. It kind of like, you learn a lot from just seeing how the markets there.
00:08:59.486 - 00:09:04.730, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Expensive tuition, but fun, for sure.
00:09:05.150 - 00:09:10.290, Speaker A: Which, which NFTs were your exit liquidity ones?
00:09:13.750 - 00:09:50.620, Speaker B: I was bit like Solana. NFts were really the biggest for me. So, like, DJ and apes was the first one that I really got into and loved. And then there were, I mean, there were a bunch of others. Like, I don't know if you guys were trading Solana nfts in, like, august or September, but there were mints, like, every three days that would just completely sell out, and people were going crazy over them. I think it was the first time that a lot of people got onboarded to Solana because there's just so much hype and excitement around them. I don't know, Solana, they're interesting.
00:09:50.620 - 00:09:59.676, Speaker B: I don't know. I think mad lads are one of the coolest things that's going on in crypto right now. Their community is just crazy strong. Um, they're right at the forefront of this.
00:09:59.708 - 00:10:03.440, Speaker C: Lana, thesis, uh, what do you think of the exchange?
00:10:05.180 - 00:10:25.894, Speaker B: I'm. I'm bullish. Right. I think that it's, like, a lot of in exchange comes down to the team that's kind of building in, like, their mindset around it. And, like, tristan and Armani kind of leading from the fun, uh, leading from the front. They're just two guys that, like, I would always bet on. Armani's been.
00:10:25.894 - 00:10:39.814, Speaker B: Armani and Tristana both been, like, awesome supporters of us so far, too. So we're, like, marrying the communities a little bit. Between monad mad lads, people have grabbed on to nad lads, which is pretty humorous.
00:10:39.942 - 00:10:40.970, Speaker C: I like that.
00:10:41.670 - 00:10:49.726, Speaker B: Yeah, I like the exchange. Right. We'll see. Exchanges have been a very polarizing topic in crypto for a long time.
00:10:49.758 - 00:11:15.346, Speaker C: So, yeah, I was just confused by it when I first heard. I don't know if that was. I mean, I'm guessing that was their plan from the start, but it just seemed weird to, like, do, like, a wallet. Like, the whole, like, x nft kind of narrative they were getting after building the community around mad lads and then, like, exchange, it just seemed like a weird, like, a weird step to me.
00:11:15.498 - 00:11:26.252, Speaker A: Do you think it was planned? Did they, like, has it, was it planned that far ahead? Like, was the whole purpose of an exchange, or was there, like, a pivot at some point?
00:11:26.356 - 00:11:45.170, Speaker B: I don't think so. Um, I wouldn't even call it a pivot. I think it's just an expansion. Right? Like, they're. They're building, like, a suite of a ton of very cool things. Um, like, their wallet's awesome if you use backpack. They have their NFT community, which are, like, they're super loud, and it's a lot of marketing for them.
00:11:45.170 - 00:12:24.900, Speaker B: And exchange is just, like, another big step, right? Like, FTX went down. They were like, obviously outspoken pro salada and I think there's just like, there was a void in the market and they were kind of like, you know, a handful of smart people working really, really hard at a problem. Like, tends to solve it sometimes. Um, and they could be that team. So, yeah, very, very excited for, for what they're doing, but, yeah, I think it's like they're building, like, it honestly, like a backpack universe. Um, I think their brand is going to, to grow a lot over the. At least the next year.
00:12:26.160 - 00:13:11.140, Speaker C: Yeah, it's very, it's. I, I'm kind of in the same vein that I, I mean, mad lads has been like, my, I think, like, over the past year, probably like the most profitable, like, longer term thing I've been in. So, like, you know, it's hard not to like them when, when you have an NFT that ten x's against. Well, I guess against USD, but it's, it'll be like, at the very least it will be like a show to watch. I think we've never seen like this, these kind of, these kind of steps being taken. Um, I'm always curious to, to hear, because I used to, I used to be in VC as well. Um, I'm always curious to hear why.
00:13:11.140 - 00:13:22.184, Speaker C: Why people decided to switch from like the venture space or the investment space over to like, the protocol side. What was that, like, decision, like, for you, for sure?
00:13:22.272 - 00:13:44.490, Speaker B: Um, yeah, honestly, I, uh, I never planned on it. Like, I. My plan for the last three years was like, CMS is, this is like, I'm so lucky that this was the first real job I have. This is ten out of ten. I never want to leave. Everything about the firm was just awesome. So, like, my plan was to stay in venture.
00:13:44.490 - 00:14:56.260, Speaker B: I mean, over the course of those like two and a half years, I probably saw like somewhere between 2003, thousand different pitches in crypto. So just by nature of spending that much time trying to dissect different projects and think about a thesis, I don't know, you get a lens for it. So when I initially heard the pitch for Monad, it was February of 2022, and Keone and James had Jeff just left jump to basically start it. Um, and I heard the pitch and it is, it's like, it was one where I just have no, like, I did not have the technical chops at all to know if you could rebuild the EVM from scratch in C and Rust and get a 1000 x increase in performance. Um, it was just, I had no idea if it could work. Um, and I waited at, like a 10% chance in my head, and I was like, but if it can work, it's a massive deal. Like, that's a main.
00:14:56.260 - 00:15:39.498, Speaker B: Like, you get a lot of the pros of Solana and you open it up to the EVM community, which doesn't have a great path at, like, very high performance scaling. So I was like, there's a 10% chance this works, but on the off chance it does, it's incredibly important. Like, that's the only thing that I actually bet my career on. Um, after seeing like, a ton of pitches on the venture side, um, and I told Keone that on the first call, like, I don't know if this is possible at all. Um, but if it is, please call me because I, I would love to be involved. Um, so, yeah, basically, time went on. Um, ended up reconnecting earlier this year and essentially, uh, had a conversation.
00:15:39.498 - 00:16:17.650, Speaker B: Kenny was like, hey, I remember what you said on the first call. Just wanted to let you know we figured out the hardest problem, that we weren't sure how solvable it was. And he's like, it's solvable. Now we just need to put our heads down and grind through the actual architecture and building it. I was like, all right, that's the vote of confidence I needed. If it just went from 10% to, I don't know, 60, 70% chance of being able to do this, that's worth it. So it was not wanting to leave the venture side to go to the builder side.
00:16:17.650 - 00:16:32.490, Speaker B: It was more, I think this is going to be an incredibly important and incredibly powerful thing in crypto, and I just want to be able to help in any way that I can. So, yeah, that was the reason for the transition.
00:16:33.280 - 00:17:05.830, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny to, it's funny to think about, you've seen at CMS, you probably, you said you saw like 3000 slide decks and nothing, nothing else, I guess, made you sort of want to join the team and start creating something with them other than Monad, which is, I guess, a really interesting vote of confidence. So you hear about Monad. What exactly are you, like, doing at Monad? What's your day to day like? What's the kind of, what's the goal there?
00:17:06.610 - 00:17:47.200, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mainly wear two hats, both of them just tied to, like, growth in general. One is leading the ecosystem growth charge. So like, very similar to kind of the vc side where you're talking to a lot of teams, you're figuring out which ones you think are very high potential, and then basically working with them to build on top of Monad and, like, grow the ecosystem. Right. Like, an l one is. Is basically just a computer for a community. It's just, it's like Ethereum is just a big, massive computer for Ethereum's community, which their community are users.
00:17:47.200 - 00:18:10.040, Speaker B: And in that case, an l one is really only as important as the Dapps that are building on top of it. So, yeah, working a lot with individual teams that are building on Monad, getting ready to deploy on testnet, and then the other side is on the marketing and community front.
00:18:11.100 - 00:18:36.562, Speaker A: So did you start from scratch there where all the things that we see in the Monad community right now? Because, I mean, there is a lot. It's. It's insanely impressive what you guys are doing and, like, building a community, it's almost. It, like, sits in a great middle ground between, I want to say, like, solana and bear chain. In a weird way, I think it.
00:18:36.586 - 00:18:38.026, Speaker C: Like, a good example.
00:18:38.178 - 00:18:57.620, Speaker A: Like, the chain isn't real yet. I feel like you've kind of absorbed that. That meme and you guys have made it your own in a way. And then with the TPS, it's just like, we're super focused on speed, kind of Solana vibes. You started from scratch there. Where did the ideas come from?
00:18:59.000 - 00:19:10.260, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, it's really good question. Yeah, it essentially started from scratch. Right. They were looking for someone to really, like, spearhead the initiative.
00:19:11.650 - 00:19:14.610, Speaker A: So there was no, like, character, nothing?
00:19:14.730 - 00:19:15.786, Speaker B: No, no.
00:19:15.858 - 00:19:20.674, Speaker A: Oh, that's awesome, too. Yeah, that's super impressive. It's super impressive.
00:19:20.802 - 00:20:35.192, Speaker B: I think it's one of those things that, like, you spend, like, a bunch of months building out the fundamentals and, like, what, you know are going to be important, but just, like, there's not enough people to make it work yet, but, like, you just, you just know that, like, this is going to be a big deal. People will care, and we need to have these kind of, like, systems and, like, things for the community to enjoy. So a lot of months spent in just building out the fundamentals, having the correct energy, making sure you match your audience, which is very much crypto Twitter, at least at this stage. I think that's a place where a lot of protocols will drop it, they'll tweet fun stuff off of the own account and then, like, well, this is a corporate account, so we need to tweet as if for ups or something. And I think they just miss, like, they don't understand that Twitter is just, like, one big attention economy and you're not competing. It's not like commercials at the Super bowl where like, you get rated based on how entertaining your commercial is compared to the other commercials. Right.
00:20:35.192 - 00:21:18.784, Speaker B: Like, if, if people see your tweets from your main account, but they'd rather like, go look at Kobe's tweets or like crypto cred or anyone, like, you're just gonna fall away. Like, no one's gonna care. So it's an interesting dynamic, I think that's happened in really, like the last ten years where like, creator content really kind of dominates what everyone pays attention to. And, like, brands fall to the side. So I think making sure that, like, you just mirror that, um, you are entertaining in your own branding is like, that's kind of the only way to actually grab, um, grab attention, uh, like in this kind of like, big, you know, slush that is the algorithm. Um, yeah.
00:21:18.912 - 00:22:29.840, Speaker A: I just think, like, the certain aspects of your guys's marketing that are impressive to me are just like the taking the TPS meme. Like, nobody, I feel like, even kind of dared inflex TPS like a few months ago just because it was like kind of cringy and like during the Alt L1 season, it was clear that like just naming TPS in a random number, like, it was just, it just didn't have the same vibe. And like, nobody touched that kind of meta for a while. And then also, I've never seen anyone hype the release of their documentation, like, so well, like there was, I mean, you can only do so much with docs in terms of like grabbing attention, but at least the ct I won had like at least a day, at least like a full day of like, oh, monads dropping their documentation and like, I don't know, I thought that was awesome. I'm kind of interested to hear, like, is that like planned out? Like what pieces are you putting together to make something like that happen?
00:22:30.700 - 00:23:13.026, Speaker B: Yeah, no, and I appreciate the kind words. I think it was like we were hoping it would become somewhat of a meme where it's like, it's literally documentation. Like, most people are not going to go and read this. So, like, if you can take docs and make it feel exciting and have people excited about it like that, that just fully comes from just like, I don't know, organic engagement and I, people just like liking the Monad brand. But yeah, I think that, I mean, they're, I think they're just like small things that, that we've just found work and kind of hit a vein over time. And like once one of them works, and we know, we're like, oh, this is high potential. People really like this.
00:23:13.026 - 00:23:41.500, Speaker B: The community enjoys it. Like, let's just stick with it and double down and make sure that we do it again. I think we've just been building up, like, a number of those over time. So, like, one is this locked telegram chat. So there's 999 people in the chat. There will only ever be 999 people in that chat. And every week we go and purge 25 people, usually the bottom performers, and add 25 new ones.
00:23:41.660 - 00:23:44.960, Speaker A: And, like, what's performance tracker like activity?
00:23:45.720 - 00:23:54.820, Speaker B: Um, vibes. Yeah, yeah, I won't. I won't, like, give it away because I think once people know exactly what's measured, then you, like, lose.
00:23:55.360 - 00:23:55.648, Speaker A: Right?
00:23:55.664 - 00:23:56.560, Speaker B: It's like one game.
00:23:56.600 - 00:23:57.016, Speaker C: It.
00:23:57.128 - 00:24:26.710, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's like when you see someone tweet out, they're like, this is how we're doing. Points for this. Like, this is the exact formula. Then it's like, well, you just lost all organic stuff because people just care about the formula. I think one of, like, there is no exact formula, which has been really good. It's like, the measure that we try to get is, like, is this person positive to have in the chat? And, like, a lot of the time, it's like, in just talking, having a conversation, talking with other community members.
00:24:26.710 - 00:24:48.492, Speaker B: We do, like, a weekly mission. So, like, the one way to ensure that you won't get purged from the chat is if you participate in it. We try to keep them, like, fun and lighthearted. So over Thanksgiving, it was like, share a pic of your Thanksgiving dinner and if you're not in the US, right. Just share a pic of some food on the day. And they were like, but that's like.
00:24:48.516 - 00:24:53.292, Speaker A: A thousand people in there. Is that just you behind the scenes or, like, looking at everyone?
00:24:53.396 - 00:25:23.740, Speaker B: No, there's a team. Yeah, we have a team. We just hired kryptoons full time, which is awesome. He's been, like, a staple in the community. But, yeah, there's, like, I'd say that there are. There are probably six people who solely focus on making sure that the community aspect is as great as possible. And, like, I, Juan, really respect Keone, the CEO, for, like, deciding that this is a thing that's worth investing in.
00:25:23.740 - 00:25:24.700, Speaker B: I think it's really smart.
00:25:24.740 - 00:25:35.350, Speaker A: You have to, like, pitch him on this. Or was this like, because signing six, I'm assuming, full time people for communities, it's probably a big decision for.
00:25:35.430 - 00:25:54.936, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So not everyone is full time. There are a few part part time people, but, yeah, I mean, I think it's, like, I agree that it's a lot of people focusing on it, but.
00:25:54.968 - 00:25:57.776, Speaker A: I also definitely paid off, though, that.
00:25:57.808 - 00:26:35.308, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And this is, like, what I'd say that the Monad community has been, like, at least, like, known or somewhat relevant for, like, a handful of months, but it's been a long time. Kind of build it, like, the locke telegram for a long time. Like, people didn't even care notice if they were purged, right? Like, it probably was, like, two or three months of, like, purging people and putting stuff out that weren't really catching on. And then, you know, as Monad's brand has kind of grown, people are like, wait, I don't want to get purged from the locked telegram. Like, this is cool. Like, Monad's cool, and I'm an insider now, and I want to be part of it.
00:26:35.308 - 00:27:02.830, Speaker B: And so I think, like, the demand to be in it, as well as people that are in, like, not wanting to leave has been, like, a really powerful. And, like, people that don't really care, like, they probably end up getting purged. So you. I don't know, you end up with just under a thousand, like, monad spartans that are just, like, you know, we're die hard. Like, we love this community. We love this chat. We're going to follow this to the end of days.
00:27:02.830 - 00:27:13.450, Speaker B: I think, like, having a thousand people that truly, really care about what's going on is way more powerful than, like, some empty discord with, like, 100,000 people just, like, sitting around for launch.
00:27:13.760 - 00:27:17.968, Speaker A: Is there a mana discord or focus on telegram?
00:27:18.024 - 00:27:27.192, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, there is that. The discord. The discord's been actually in an area that we wanted to double down on in the last few months. So, like, now, the way.
00:27:27.376 - 00:27:28.680, Speaker A: Poker, too, right?
00:27:28.840 - 00:27:38.368, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Poker. Poker every week on Thursdays. Absolute staple. I haven't missed a game in. In months. I think that's my favorite community thing that we do.
00:27:38.504 - 00:27:39.700, Speaker A: Have you been the.
00:27:40.330 - 00:28:02.870, Speaker C: The onboarding for the discord is really interesting. I joined it, like, last week. It's different from any. I don't. I don't know if you're in it, Sito, but it's not like. It's not, like, usual, like, captcha verification. There's, like, a waiting room chat almost, and you have to, like, humanly prove that you are, like, not a bot just by, like.
00:28:02.870 - 00:28:12.502, Speaker C: Like, acting humanity, like, in the chat. And eventually you'll get approved and get access to the rest of the discord, which is. That's really interesting.
00:28:12.526 - 00:28:13.210, Speaker A: I've never.
00:28:14.470 - 00:28:21.790, Speaker C: I just, like, sent memes for a little while, and I just, like. I don't know. I just, like, talk shit, basically, and I got in within, like, 20 minutes.
00:28:21.830 - 00:28:23.530, Speaker B: Maybe that works.
00:28:23.830 - 00:28:45.784, Speaker C: It's cool. It's really cool. I liked it because it was like. Like, a lot of the times I wouldn't care in something like that, or I would just, like, you know, click the check reaction or whatever, and then I'm. Don't send a single message in the discord, but that way, I was like. I almost took it, like, personally when I saw that. I was like, how dare they not, like, let me in right away? Like, now.
00:28:45.784 - 00:28:47.620, Speaker C: Now I have to, like, prove it.
00:28:48.600 - 00:29:04.162, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And when it, like, when. When you guys are coming up with. With that kind of stuff, like, who. Where do the. Where do those ideas flow? Is there, like, an approval process? Like, can't imagine. Like, yeah, no captcha.
00:29:04.162 - 00:29:14.110, Speaker A: We're just going to make people wait and talk shit in this. In this chat before we approve them. Like, is that just natural off the. Off the dome, or is it, like, strategic?
00:29:16.370 - 00:29:43.770, Speaker B: I think it's, like a combination. I mean, we talk about it all the time, right? Like, we want to make sure that, like, your community, being happy and caring about what's going on is, like, that's, like, everything, right? Like. Like I said earlier, l one is literally a computer for a community. So, like, we're the devs. There are 20 people over there building out the. The l one. You know, we need to focus on building out the community.
00:29:43.770 - 00:30:09.510, Speaker B: It's been, like, a. For sure, like, a very serious. I guess. Not even serious, but, like, it's something that we just care about, and we want to make sure it's as good as possible. So. Yeah, like, the discord waiting room. I think that there are, like, two things that come from it, right? One, you get, like, an actual filter so you're not just, like, so many times I've joined a discord, it's like, all right, click through five captchas, then you're in, and then you forget about it.
00:30:09.510 - 00:30:32.384, Speaker B: So if you lose maybe 50% of people that, like, don't really care to kind of prove that they're a human, like, that's fine. If you can't send one meme, then that's okay. You probably won't fit in well with the community in the first place. If you do, though, you might care more once you're in. You spent 20 minutes, you got added. Now you're in there, and you take a little bit of pride. You care.
00:30:32.384 - 00:30:59.504, Speaker B: It's like, you're truly part of it. But, yeah, I think that. I think it's just over time, like, brainstorming with a bunch of the guys that we work with on a daily basis and having a, um, a handful of weekly calls and just be like, you know, community is really grabbing onto this. Let's run with it. Um, you know, this might be a high potential idea. Let's test it out. And, like, if you test it out and it works, that's fantastic.
00:30:59.504 - 00:31:09.380, Speaker B: If you test out, it doesn't work, then kind of move on. Um, but, yeah, definitely, like, a. An important push that, like, is on purpose. Yeah.
00:31:09.960 - 00:32:00.100, Speaker A: And you, you touched on the character and the memes. What was the process there, making the Monad character? I think it's like, again, honestly, you might be taking, like, 100% of these. It'd be really impressive if every one of these is your idea. But, like, because I think it's kind of nuts, but, like, to make the mascot for monadental just, like, perfectly. Like, it's basically the same thing as a pepe with some tweaks and some purple, but that allows anyone to make the meme for any previous pepe template. And, like, I thought that was a pretty smart move. How did the creation of that, like, happen and.
00:32:01.120 - 00:32:31.596, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think same with everything else. I think it's a combination of, like, a few of us putting our heads together and thinking through good ideas and then just, like, grabbing on to what the community, like, naturally gravitates to. Like, if everyone, if, like, the 1000 people in the chat are really excited about this one thing, like, it's silly to not run with that, right? Like, memes. Memes, like, catch a vein and then they become a staple.
00:32:31.788 - 00:32:35.060, Speaker A: Was there a thought about maybe, like, another character?
00:32:35.600 - 00:33:18.514, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think initially, the kind of purple pepe character, people started calling him a prune, which I think is pretty funny. But it just, like, I think it was a combination of. There are a lot of templates of pepe out there, and it's somewhat easy to change it to purple. And, like, just that one thing, like, all of a sudden now it's Monad branded. So I think it was, like, running with that idea that the community kind of created on their own and then highly incentivized, like, socially incentivizing very good art. So, like, we're blessed to have a number of, like, amazing artists in this. In our community.
00:33:18.514 - 00:33:32.130, Speaker B: Like, shout out, skilly, Mario, Rachel. Like, these people literally grind out, like, high quality art pieces for Monad, like, all day. That's been, like, the most impressive thing to me so far.
00:33:32.990 - 00:33:35.930, Speaker A: And just, like, how much, like, system night.
00:33:36.230 - 00:34:02.776, Speaker B: Yeah, so you get it, like, in discord, you can get knighted as, like, a mon artist. So, like, it's like, it's a point of pride that people take. Right there are, like, you know, ten to 15 mon artists. And, like, if you're a mon artist, you know, people are gunning for your spot. Like, other people are creating art, trying to get into that. That rank. Um, yeah, I think it's just, like, a lot of it.
00:34:02.776 - 00:34:49.058, Speaker B: It's like, if you put, you know, if there are 300 kids playing at recess and, like, they decide that they want to play football, like, all of a sudden, you know, everyone wants to be a great football player, right? Like, that's just, like, they decided this is what they want to do. And, like, now that everyone likes this and wants to do it, like, I want to be good. So it's really just been, like, you know, incentivized through, like, kind of status within the Monad community, which has been, like, cool to see. That's been, like, an emergent property that, again, you hope becomes something. But you got to wait and see what. Like, the members who care about Monad and are posting every day, like, what they like, and then once they, like, tell you that they like it and, like, this is awesome, um, you just do it with them. Right? Like, you.
00:34:49.058 - 00:34:59.070, Speaker B: Like, I am just one of the community members as well. Right. Like, I just post stuff that I like. Uh, and then, yeah, the masses kind of decide what they. What they want to run with.
00:35:00.650 - 00:35:48.090, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really cool. It really feels like you guys, like, are in the process of, or have sort of, like, caught lightning in a bottle, almost, like, you know, in terms of marketing, well, before anything is even out there, in terms of the actual one in the ecosystem, I'm interested to talk about that a little bit. How you're thinking about what a fully realized monad ecosystem looks like or what it looks like from day one. Are there any specific types of protocols or any Dapps specific that you are particularly keen on getting them on Monad from day one?
00:35:48.710 - 00:36:35.942, Speaker B: Yeah. So at a high level, I think Defi is like, that's like v zero kind of product market fit. Keone and James, like I said, came, like, their background. They're on the same high frequency trading team at jump for seven or eight years and then got moved over to jump crypto. James was one of the first people ever working on PiF and Keone, working on the trading side, and after spending so much time in HFT and then seeing how crypto works, I think it was nine months, and they're like, we can rebuild the EVM, and you can have all of this type of trading activity on chain. It's just not possible right now. So Mona was kind of born out of.
00:36:35.942 - 00:37:44.610, Speaker B: Out of like the trading style that sees like trillions of dollars of volume in normal assets, and crypto just can't really touch that. So, like, bridging the gap between centralized exchange trading execution and DeFi trading execution is kind of like the core mission. Right? Like, trading on Monad should be just much, much more efficient than trading on any other EVM environment. So because of that, we've seen a lot of interest from DeFi focused teams. We think the backbone of our DeFi ecosystem will be essential. In my order book, which it's impossible for any EVM environment right now, you really need very low fees and high throughput to have market makers quoting many times every single second and still have it be profitable and worthwhile. So I think the central order book will kind of be like one of those zero to one moments for a lot of people who trade on Ethereum, l two s or other EVM environments.
00:37:44.610 - 00:39:01.996, Speaker B: With that, you're going to get high performance perp dexs, you're going to get borrowing lens that have much higher capital efficiency than you can have in any other EVM environment. It just like, if you're building anything in DeFi, and then you can just, it's EVM compatible, so you can just go and deploy it on Monad, you're going to see a massive performance increase. So I think that's been like the first initiative, which is kind of like, it's an obvious choice from the dev side. So we've seen a lot of interest in the ecosystem from Defi. And then I think the step after that, which potentially is even more exciting, is the consumer facing side, in my opinion. I think Solanas first surge, where a lot of users were actually going on and testing it out, I think that was the first time that you could have very high throughput, low transaction cost, or apps that need those characteristics in order to perform, you saw step in, or like any other consumer facing app, that like, if you have those characteristics, then you can build these really cool things, and a lot of the time, it ends up being consumer facing. So, like, you know, sports betting is another one.
00:39:01.996 - 00:40:01.700, Speaker B: Like sports betting. I don't know where you guys were for Thanksgiving, but it was like, I've never seen more people betting on football than this past thanksgiving. And I think it makes a lot of sense to be able to do that on chain. There just hasn't been a great environment to allow it up until now. Because if you have, if Ethereum doubles in price and on chain activity, like ten x is because of that l two s at like, even like $5 transaction fees on l two s, if I'm placing $10 parlays on sports, I'm not going to pay $5 to place the beta. So, like, those small transaction, those small transactions are kind of the first things that go once. Like, chain congestion is a real thing, and if you're working full time in crypto, you have at least somewhat of a bullish opinion on what the space does in general.
00:40:01.700 - 00:40:38.768, Speaker B: And consumer facing apps, I think Frontech was one that was in social fi, consumer facing type of application. I think it caught a lot of wind because it was a novel idea. It was cool and people liked it and could test it out. So I think there's going to be a lot more experimentation on the consumer facing application side. And I think if you're building an app, you're going to want it to be sub $0.01 transaction cost for your user. Um, there's just, like, no reason to, to build it where it costs $3 to.
00:40:38.768 - 00:40:45.700, Speaker B: To do something in your app. So that's. That's kind of like the other area that has been a main focus so far.
00:40:49.360 - 00:41:04.590, Speaker A: Sorry. I want to. I want to play Devil's advocate a bit, just because I think it would be funny to hear your take on it. Um, why. Why does it have to be Evm? Why couldn't all of this be solved with Solana?
00:41:07.690 - 00:41:10.362, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's a great question, right?
00:41:10.546 - 00:41:12.722, Speaker A: Like, in your opinion, I guess, yeah.
00:41:12.866 - 00:42:00.928, Speaker B: I think the answer is somewhat more on the left curve. It's like, you know, 95% plus of devs that work in crypto build for the EVM, right? Like, they know solidity, that's how they build, etcetera. Even a higher. I want to say, like, 97%, but I have no idea after Solana's recent run. But the vast majority of TVL is also on the EVM. It's just such a common environment that people have accepted as, if you're going to build in crypto, you learn to build in the EVM. And if you see, like, Solana is one of my favorite projects in crypto, for the record, like, I love Solana.
00:42:00.928 - 00:42:33.006, Speaker B: Like, the first time I used Solana, that was, like, a zero to one moment for me where I was like, holy shit. Like, this is awesome. Like, I don't have to spend $40. It's free, and it's instant. I think just introduce, if there's all of this excitement and all of these developers that know this language and how to build on it, uh, giving them a scaling solution that is, like, where the. The UX is similar to Solana. Just, like, unlocks a ton of potential of what can be done.
00:42:33.006 - 00:43:02.110, Speaker B: Um, yeah, I think that's, like, the kind of the left curve. Easiest answer, right? Like, EVM is the dominant. It's the dominant, um, like, environment for crypto right now. So, like, if you can, you know, ten x 100 x the scale of what's possible with it, like, that's a problem worth going after. Um, yeah, so that's point, right? Like, why not the SVM? Like, it's. It could be, right? It's. It's also very important.
00:43:02.970 - 00:43:25.090, Speaker C: Yeah. So. So then what are the trade offs gonna be from at least, like, within the first year, like you mentioned, like, if you're looking to deploy something on. On the EVM or on main net, you know, just come do it at Monad, and it'll have orders of magnitude more efficiency and speed. What's the downside there?
00:43:28.630 - 00:43:40.838, Speaker B: There shouldn't be. Right? It's fully EVM compatible. You don't have to do, like, you can take uniswap, copy and paste it, and it'll. In 30 seconds, and it'll run on.
00:43:40.854 - 00:44:04.682, Speaker A: Monadental from what on the left curve? Since we're. Since we're there right now, how does that work? Like, how does that work? Is it, like, an evolution in the way some, like, code is written? Like, there has to be, like, how do you take the EVM, copy and paste, but still get ten k, two p's?
00:44:04.826 - 00:44:52.866, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. Not the best suited person to answer it. So I'll keep it on the left side of the curve just in case. Keone watches this, and he's like, you're talking about the wrong code. But, yeah, essentially, the EVM was built in 2016, the release of Geth, and it has not been changed in any significant way in the last seven. Coming up on eight years. Ref is one that a lot of people at paradigm are working on, which you might see some marginal improvements with maybe I don't want to speak to what the improvements might be, but it's a very similar thing.
00:44:52.866 - 00:45:51.490, Speaker B: But it's slightly more efficient. The Monad team rebuilt the EVM from scratch in Rust and C. And when you do that, you can implement a lot of core computer science optimizations which have been tried and proven over the last 20 plus years. So when you build in Rust and C, you can introduce optimistic parallel execution, which is kind of like the headline optimization that a lot of people like, for it to go fully left curve. Right now, the EVM is completely sequential, so you can think of like a mile long backup for everyone going through, like one toll road on a, on a highway. Parallel execution basically allows you to. Now you have 30, right? So you can do 30 cars at a time instead of just one car at a time.
00:45:51.490 - 00:46:31.036, Speaker B: I think that's the analogy most people grab onto and like, and like, I think people think that that's kind of the only core optimization that exists in monadental. There's really four. So you have parallel execution, you have separation of consensus and execution. So right now, Ethereum has all of consensus and execution in each of the blocks. Consensus takes up the majority of the block space. So on average, over 90% of the block space is spent on consensus, which means you have this small amount left for execution. So basically what Monad does is split them.
00:46:31.036 - 00:47:17.300, Speaker B: So you have consensus, which is everyone agrees that this is the list of transactions, and then you have another one that has execution. So if in Ethereum, 5% of the block space can be for execution, in Monad, you can have 100% of the block space on execution. So you get another order of magnitude there. Then we also have our own custom high performance consensus mechanism, monad BFT, which is a derivative of hot stuff, and then also our own custom backend state database. Those are the four key optimizations that allow you to get much more scale and maintain EVM compatibility.
00:47:18.360 - 00:47:33.052, Speaker C: How is, I think it was either the first or the second one you mentioned separating consensus and execution. Is that not what l two s do as well, except they're moving execution to a separate layer and rolling up the data.
00:47:33.236 - 00:47:45.640, Speaker B: Yep. So that might be where we get into the point where Keone might yell at me if he was my answer to it. To a certain extent. Yeah, yeah. That aims to solve a similar problem.
00:47:46.130 - 00:48:06.466, Speaker A: So immediately, like, I feel like the crypto mind goes from like, okay, is it fast? But the, the immediate rebuttal is going to be like, what's the decentralization that happens there? Is that something you guys think about? Is that like a core ethos at Monad? Yeah, or you're just like, let's go fast.
00:48:06.658 - 00:49:04.690, Speaker B: No, no, absolutely. I think that's like, again, it's like people kind of think about, well, you have Ethereum and this has low hardware specs and is like Max decentralized. And then you have Solana, which has higher hardware specs, but if you beef up the computer, you can send a lot more through. And that has kind of like, that's become kind of the decentralization metric that people look at is like, how expensive is the hardware? I would say I have a skinny screen to work with here. But if Ethereum is here and Solana is here, Monad is here. It's very similar to Ethereum, which is extremely important. The mission of Monad is to be able to help decentralize state access and make a scalable blockchain that does not have the decentralization trade off.
00:49:04.690 - 00:49:31.460, Speaker B: It's slightly more intensive than an Ethereum node. I believe that most of the specs are about two x that of Ethereum, but still completely. Our CTO likes to say you could run it on a Costco computer. Costco sells these computers which hit all of the specs that are required to run a validator for Monadheendeh.
00:49:32.710 - 00:49:36.490, Speaker C: Will there be high capital requirements like there are on Ethereum.
00:49:39.110 - 00:49:42.182, Speaker B: In terms of the amount of eth you need staked, for example?
00:49:42.246 - 00:49:44.974, Speaker C: Yeah, if you want to run your own validator.
00:49:45.142 - 00:50:36.660, Speaker B: Yep, it's a good question. Again, our dev rail guy is probably the best guy to answer it. I think a stat that people grab onto and make sense for them is like a lot of chains that use tendermint consensus have a cap of 150 validators, and that's the main validator set. In order to get into that 150, you need to have x amount of capital. Initially, Mana was considering using tenement consensus and ended up creating our own custom consensus mechanism to make sure that that was not a cap. So any amount of validators will be able to participate in similar to Ethereum and Solana. But yeah, in terms of the actual state cap that you need.
00:50:36.660 - 00:50:43.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I'll ping our answer for it.
00:50:45.680 - 00:51:36.430, Speaker A: For like, the relationship between Monad and the EVM from like a bridge level to an app level to kind of like just simplicity level. How do you guys see that relationship, like, being, do we, are we going to see like a bunch of uniswaps, or is there going to be like a killer custom app that's only on, on Monad initially? Like, how do you feel? I mean, I'm sure like, you're going from seeing a bunch of slide decks at CMS to seeing a bunch more slide decks. Now, has there been, like, this is only for Monad and this is going to be amazing. Or has there been like, just a bunch of, like, forks?
00:51:36.770 - 00:52:29.786, Speaker B: Yeah, there are, there are a few on the consumer facing side that, um, very excited about. Um, we actually have an initiative launching, uh, at the turn of the new year, um, basically focused on these apps. But I, uh, when it comes out, I'll ping you guys and we can add an update or something. Um, I think the main one that's going to make a big difference and, like, everyone will kind of realize it's a big deal is the central limit order book. Um, it, it really should be like, the first killer app that only exists on Monad. And you basically, like, in order to get access to it, you'll come onto Monad, use that app, and get much better execution on a lot of the things that you're currently looking at. Yeah, I would say, like, any slide.
00:52:29.818 - 00:52:31.954, Speaker A: Deck names that you've seen, any hints.
00:52:32.042 - 00:52:34.630, Speaker C: Doesn'T have to be names either, just ideas.
00:52:35.140 - 00:52:42.396, Speaker B: Yeah, we will probably release the teams that are working on it in the coming months.
00:52:42.588 - 00:52:48.320, Speaker A: Is there a number? How many, how many slides have you seen so far there?
00:52:49.420 - 00:53:30.490, Speaker B: I mean, there's kind of a line, right? Like, how many do you want to include in it? Right. Like, if it's one guy and we don't believe that that's going to be like, that, he's going to be able to follow through and execute on this promise. Um, probably not including it. I would say that currently somewhere between three to five, like, super star studded teams, um, working on that problem. Because, I mean, like, if you believe that Monad will be, like, an important aspect of crypto and one of the, like, the first killer app on it, uh, should be the central IMA order book. Um, then that's like, that's an awesome spot to be in the, in the ecosystem. Right? Like, you're, you kind of become a main character.
00:53:30.490 - 00:54:16.560, Speaker B: So I think it's something that we want to make sure an amazing team is the one that is working on that day in and day out. But, yeah, I'd say that, I mean, there are a lot, I was actually surprised at the quality of teams that have reached out and shown proof of concept. A few of them were working on essential motor book for EVM even before they heard about Monad. And we're trying to overcome the barriers that exist in, like, all current EVM environments through, like, very, very smart kind of engineering methods. They're like if you're building Monad, that solves all of our problems, right? Like we, we can build this the way that it should be built without the trade offs. So yeah, I'm really excited about the development going on there.
00:54:17.340 - 00:54:41.566, Speaker C: That's awesome. Yeah. I mean, even three to five, like rockstar teams at this stage is, to me that sounds like a lot like, especially with none of it being public yet. Is there any information you can give us in terms of timeline? Like when we might be able to expect to see certain announcements, maybe like around when test nets plan for stuff like that?
00:54:41.758 - 00:55:51.648, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. So kind of a level of publicity that they are allowed to talk. So this is probably a public facing podcast is probably the, I should be the most conservative, the first working version of Monad where kind of like you hit Frankenstein with the shock and he's alive for the first time and transactions are processing and the MVP is alive will be very, very soon, which we're excited about. You kind of go through an iteration then from the first working version to them what you consider completely debugged to the point that like public testnet is ready and available and you basically just like build up the amount of optimizations you're putting into it, et cetera, until you hit like mainnet ready stage. So, yeah, I would say that there's like, from the initial, first working version, you probably won't have a Monad main net, uh, for about six months. Um, public test that sooner than that for sure.
00:55:51.648 - 00:56:32.000, Speaker B: Um, but yeah, I mean, it, it's tough to put like, I don't, I think about things a lot in terms of timelines and like, from working with like super high quality devs, uh, full time over the last, I don't know, five or six months. Um, I realized that they think less in terms of like timelines, in terms of days. Right. It's more like, um, you know, this problem could take 1 hour or ten days. And I will know when I know. So, yeah, we kind of have like internally an optimistic timeline and a conservative timeline that we're looking at. But yeah, next year for sure, you will be able to use them on ma net.
00:56:32.000 - 00:56:34.160, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:56:35.340 - 00:56:35.748, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:35.804 - 00:56:36.400, Speaker C: Cool.
00:56:37.220 - 00:57:13.082, Speaker A: For the people, for the people listening, I'm going to make a, an educated guess and just for an educated observation and just see your reaction. But I will say nobody, no projects or protocols are going to launch anything significant within, within the holiday, with the, within the holiday season. So take that with the grain of salt. Take that with a grain of salt, I guess. But I'm going to guess like February. You know testnet, right? You're right.
00:57:13.106 - 00:57:15.910, Speaker C: Before his eyebrow twitched, I saw it.
00:57:16.650 - 00:57:50.588, Speaker A: He's trying to stay as still as possible. No, I think it's going to be interesting to see we're coming up on time. I wanted to ask a completely random question, but I'd regret not asking. The moment I heard about Monad, someone had sent it to me and said, kobe's on the cap table. This is gonna go crazy. Like, that was the first message I ever got about Monad. Is he involved at all? Like, are you getting like a text messages from Kobe? Like.
00:57:50.588 - 00:58:00.806, Speaker A: Like, good morning and what are you doing today, Monet? I feel like if he'd be involved, it'd be in the community aspect, like a lot, I think.
00:58:00.958 - 00:58:19.690, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, he is on the cap table. That's in. We have our raise announcement from February of this year. So yeah, Kobe's publicly named as investor. He has sent a handful of Gabon ads in the community chat over the last few days. Has started using the stickers.
00:58:19.690 - 00:58:41.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, he, like, he's got some of the best judgment in all of crypto. Right. Like, the reason people know about him isn't like some mistake. Right? Like, he's been in the space for a super long time, has awesome intuition about a lot of things and has been like, super helpful in, you know, a lot of questions that. That I've had. He's just had great perspective on it. So.
00:58:43.860 - 00:58:48.040, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, as he mentioned, up only at all.
00:58:49.660 - 00:59:06.630, Speaker B: I have no insight into when up only is, uh, coming back. I know Ledger put out a tweet saying if they raise a million dollars, they'll do one show. I don't know. We'll see what that dynamic looks like. I hope it comes back. That was like my favorite crypto podcast by far.
00:59:09.050 - 00:59:10.590, Speaker C: Your second favorite now.
00:59:14.170 - 00:59:23.334, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I do have to up here, but yeah, for sure. Any other questions? Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:59:23.462 - 00:59:36.490, Speaker C: No, we're. We're all good on. At least I'm on my end. I'm all good. Um, really appreciate you taking the time. This was, this was a lot of fun. Definitely looking forward to Monad, um, as we were before, but more so now.
00:59:37.150 - 00:59:37.598, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:37.654 - 00:59:37.926, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:59:37.958 - 00:59:40.742, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, man. That's episode 45. We'll see you guys.
00:59:40.886 - 00:59:42.990, Speaker B: Appreciate it. Talk to you guys soon. Peace.
