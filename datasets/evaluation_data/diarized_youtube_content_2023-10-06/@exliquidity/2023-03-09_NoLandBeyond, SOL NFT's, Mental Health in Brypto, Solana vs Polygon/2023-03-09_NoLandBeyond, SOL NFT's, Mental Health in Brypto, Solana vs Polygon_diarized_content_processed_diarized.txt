00:00:00.320 - 00:00:06.810, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:07.430 - 00:00:17.370, Speaker B: All right. Exit liquidity. That's the name of the podcast, by the way. Do you know, you know hard rock Nick? Yeah.
00:00:18.350 - 00:00:20.518, Speaker A: The guy that does, like, the video camos cameos.
00:00:20.614 - 00:00:31.944, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I actually got him to do it. That's gonna be the intro to this video I would love this year. Pretty funny, but yeah. Episode seven. Yeah. What's up, Josh? Dude, how's life, man?
00:00:32.032 - 00:00:56.730, Speaker A: I'm chilling. Been actually recently stepped away from crypto quite a bit. I noticed for a while it took up a lot of my headspace in not the healthiest way. Like, I wasn't being productive in my trades and education and research. I found myself staring at a lot of charts, which told me, like, I was pretty burnt out. And, like, I need to step away from a bit. I'm still connected through my job, which I can't touch on too much.
00:00:56.730 - 00:00:57.042, Speaker A: But.
00:00:57.106 - 00:00:58.590, Speaker B: What kind of stuff are you trading?
00:00:59.090 - 00:01:26.972, Speaker A: Mainly when the NFT market slowed down, it'd be a little more coins. But recently it's been nothing. I've just been AFK and holding liquid soul and USDC and a couple tees that I'm somewhat confident in. And then one that I'm trying to on Twitter. It's a crypto duck punk. It's a rug project, but it's a nice little pixel PFP, which is funny because a ton of rugging that happens in the NFT space.
00:01:27.116 - 00:01:31.228, Speaker B: But if those actually have one of those fractures. Really? That one.
00:01:31.284 - 00:01:33.000, Speaker A: The soul gods, right?
00:01:33.540 - 00:01:34.540, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:01:34.580 - 00:01:35.640, Speaker A: How do you like it?
00:01:36.580 - 00:02:03.304, Speaker B: I got it randomly. Like, I was like, I didn't have a PFP, and I really liked the fucking d gods, one of theirs. And so then I started, I was like, I'm. I can't afford any ethereum ones. Like, any of the good ones are, like, insanely overpriced. And so I was just browning suit. Yeah, and browning browsing through, like, Solana and I saw them and I was like, this thing is sick.
00:02:03.304 - 00:02:17.032, Speaker B: And I just bought it. And then after that, like, the whole, like, movement that they had on, if you saw that, like, what they were doing with transitioning to gods and. Yeah, they were doing a bunch of stuff with, like, bonks and, like, bunch.
00:02:17.056 - 00:02:38.824, Speaker A: Of shit and, like, bit of money in punk. Those fun. Yeah, nice little free airdrop. Yeah, I was like, you were here for that, dude. I was like, $200 worth USD worth of bonk and I sold it, like, same day. And I think four days later it would have shot up to two grand or something ridiculous. If I had just hauled it, it did a multiples, like a five or a ten x from when I got the airdrop.
00:02:38.824 - 00:03:06.652, Speaker A: And I just sold it so early as the story because I didn't know the narrative. And I discovered that like, a lot of coins will not do well. But if a coin has a narrative that enough people can get behind, it raises the ceiling for how many people can be interested in it, which raises the price ceiling, which is how I've understood it. And it's actually been a little bit easier to read. When the top is going to happen is when is peak narrative, peak euphoria, peak greed, honestly. Yeah, yeah, so it's.
00:03:06.716 - 00:03:22.460, Speaker B: Dude, I'm in the same space. I feel. Don't you feel like you've learned? Cuz I remember talking to you at that one tailgater, whatever, it was at a college park and I was like shilling fucking magic Internet money and like, time rebates.
00:03:24.760 - 00:03:25.640, Speaker A: That was my intro.
00:03:25.720 - 00:03:55.874, Speaker B: Yeah, so many like, hardcore lessons from that dude. So many hardcore lessons. I feel like I've aged like insanely. I look at everything like pessimistically, like nowadays. I get what you mean, but I still have that touch of Optimus, like, optimistic idea. But for instance, the reason I left, like my last, like, crypto gig was because I'm like, at the end of the day, no, no regular person is gonna hold this token. It was like some really deep.
00:03:55.874 - 00:04:07.580, Speaker B: It's hard to Cli thing. Yeah. And I'm like, no one is like, no one is gonna do anything with this. No one's gonna hold x cal token. No normal person is gonna do that.
00:04:07.660 - 00:04:09.920, Speaker A: Unless they don't know they're holding the token.
00:04:11.380 - 00:04:13.284, Speaker B: Very true. So what do you mean by that?
00:04:13.332 - 00:04:30.796, Speaker A: So do you know step in? It was this app on. It was a Solana native. Yeah. So people could walk. You basically earn money from walking. And. Yeah, it's funny, I remember hearing the spaces where someone was like, I walked up to this lady at the beach and I asked her, hey, you know about Solana? I see you using stuff in it.
00:04:30.796 - 00:04:55.636, Speaker A: She's, what's a Solana? And I was like, really? Oh, this makes sense, dude. Like, step in, so on. Hello moon. Hello moon. Tracked, like, the top volume projects and coins and everything. GST and GMT were consistently towards the top of the charts in terms of volume traded and just how much activity was happening on chain. And I find it so fucking hilarious.
00:04:55.636 - 00:04:56.680, Speaker A: Can we curse?
00:04:57.070 - 00:04:57.850, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:58.590 - 00:05:04.670, Speaker A: Found it so hilarious that they didn't even know they were using a wallet. They didn't know you. They were using a blockchain. They just saw.
00:05:04.790 - 00:05:05.310, Speaker B: Really?
00:05:05.430 - 00:05:25.232, Speaker A: Yeah, they just saw. They might have had a clue with Coinbase, but they see USDC being withdrawn and they're like, oh, I can spend this. They don't really fully understand its crypto. They're just like, interface, very easy to use, so to speak. And I walk and I get paid and simple. And people, people didn't have to interact with the wallet. The wallet was hosted on the app.
00:05:25.232 - 00:05:26.072, Speaker A: It was integrated.
00:05:26.136 - 00:05:28.992, Speaker B: It was like, did you mess around with that?
00:05:29.096 - 00:05:47.408, Speaker A: I did. I used steppin. It was like, dude, but for an onboarding tool, it was like a through and through product. And the beauty of it was that you didn't have to know anything about blockchain. There was no risk of you getting rugged. You don't have to remember your seed phrase, none of that bullshit, really. You just download the app and play, dude.
00:05:47.408 - 00:06:07.230, Speaker A: And that's ultimately where it's going. And I saw one tweet today that actually really put it into perspective. Me. They were like, the Ethereum EVM has 329k active addresses over some. I think it was like a small time, maybe weekly or daily timeframe or whatever. And in web two, that's a rounding error. And the point he was drawing from that was like, everything is up for grabs.
00:06:07.230 - 00:06:28.016, Speaker A: There is no winner yet. No one is declared the winner because nobody uses fucking crypto. So if nobody is using it, then stop trying to declare a winner and fight for the piece. And it, which is a really nice perspective shift, because especially in Solana, which is a very passionate but very toxic community at times.
00:06:28.088 - 00:06:30.240, Speaker B: How did you enter that community, dude?
00:06:30.280 - 00:06:46.756, Speaker A: Like one or two years ago, Ollie told me, hey, buy some Solana. They do proof of history. Like, the tech is pretty cool. So I bought in at like $12. And I remember you kept texting me when it was pumping. It was like, Solana is now $127.50 sense or some shit.
00:06:46.756 - 00:07:01.052, Speaker A: It was very. Yeah, but it was funny. And he kept doing that until the top, towards 250. And I was like, holy shit. And so at the top, actually, or towards the top, Solana was like 220. And I was like, okay, I'm familiar with this chain. I'm familiar with how to make a wallet.
00:07:01.052 - 00:07:11.566, Speaker A: I want to trade nfts. I want to be say that I've done that. So first of all, I was going into it for the wrong reason, but then I bought a rug project and I lost a soul. And I was like, I'm never touching.
00:07:11.598 - 00:07:17.526, Speaker B: This, you think it was, like, hard for you for that whole, like, doing the wallet? Did you have that?
00:07:17.558 - 00:07:45.304, Speaker A: Like, I had experience doing it, having a wallet, and I did metamask and I got burned on own. But I knew, like, the process and the number one thing I was researching was, am I gonna have to pay $50 in gas fees every time I make a transaction? And on Solana, that was not the case. On ETh, depending on when it was the case. And so this is, mind you, this is like a year and a half ago. Yeah. Solana was just way more attractive to low liquidity, low capital user like myself.
00:07:45.392 - 00:07:53.936, Speaker B: And saw people part of that. Like, when did you get involved in NFT space? Because I feel like that's where you, I just decided around the most.
00:07:54.048 - 00:08:14.010, Speaker A: So I saw Gary v. Launching v friends and I was curious about the NFT stuff. And I was like, dude, people are making bank doing this. Can I get in on these trades? I started watching YouTube videos, which was a funnel to this dude's discord, which was a funnel to. It was a paid discord. So I paid a little bit, but I made my money back. He made like one call on a rug project that was, that pumped.
00:08:14.010 - 00:08:31.778, Speaker A: He didn't know was gonna rug at the time, but he called one project and I was like, oh, I've already made my money back. It's easy to make money in Solana nfts. And Solana was 100, 5180. So it was a nice price. So I was like, oh, you can print doing this. And then not only, not even a few months, took a year later we seen $8 Solana.
00:08:31.874 - 00:08:32.410, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:32.530 - 00:08:42.670, Speaker A: So overall, it's just really put into perspective for me, like how much things can fall from under you if you, during that whole time, what you're besting.
00:08:42.970 - 00:08:50.050, Speaker B: Yeah. During that whole time, were you completely tied to Solana? You didn't venture out anywhere else?
00:08:50.130 - 00:09:00.020, Speaker A: I was a maxi because I got burned on own and so I had a, actually, that's not true. I was curious.
00:09:00.060 - 00:09:01.960, Speaker B: Never hopped on any of these. Curious?
00:09:02.780 - 00:09:14.724, Speaker A: No. Such a naive understanding. But I was like, why do you need l two is if the l one isn't scalable, like the l one isn't scalable, then I don't know.
00:09:14.812 - 00:09:15.480, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:15.780 - 00:09:40.850, Speaker A: And Solana seem more attractive in that respect. So I was just like, I was the soul maxi from there and Solana motherfuckers made money until I realized that a lot of them are poor. And as such, it's a lower liquidity market. And when things get dry, it can be harder to make money because of that fact. Like a Solana NfT project that would pump. It would pump like, 510 sol and be like, oh, my God. But in eth terms, that's not even 0.05
00:09:40.850 - 00:09:53.594, Speaker A: eth. And that's when it really put into perspective for me. Like, eth not only is more mature market, but the coin is more mature. Like people. Like, it's more secure. People understand it better a little bit more. Whereas Solano is this kind of new kid on the block.
00:09:53.594 - 00:09:58.842, Speaker A: And so did you never get to that understanding? As I got burned a little more, but yeah. What's up?
00:09:58.986 - 00:10:24.958, Speaker B: Was it like a feeling of. Because I feel like for me, the reason I enjoy Solano, or have started to enjoy it more is because it's like, it's. What's the word? It's not like an underdog, but it has. It's always. It feels like there's something to prove there. And a lot of people are actually. Is that what, like, you gravitated to think? For me, I feel like I gravitated to.
00:10:24.958 - 00:10:40.686, Speaker B: It is a narrative in itself. And it is a little bit, like, kind. It's pretty much. It's not total bullshit, but if you're using an l two, it's basically bullshit. The whole idea of decentralization and like, all those, I bought into that aspect. Like, that's what I connected with.
00:10:40.758 - 00:10:41.110, Speaker A: Sure.
00:10:41.190 - 00:10:59.416, Speaker B: And in the beginning, like, I was, like, hating on every other. I just became like a full maxi. And then I was like, okay, people are making money. Like, I don't give a fuck. I'm just gonna go make money. Especially with. I saw soul, obviously saw Luna, saw like, phantom apex.
00:10:59.416 - 00:11:14.744, Speaker B: I feel like I missed a ride on the coin on every single one. So I would go even deeper in the degeneracy on every single project. Go own forks. Fucking anchor. And so with Solana, there wasn't. I wasn't an NFT guy. Did not like nfts.
00:11:14.744 - 00:11:22.584, Speaker B: And there wasn't that. Or I hadn't seen that degeneracy. That was like, on the other projects. I just never picked it up.
00:11:22.672 - 00:11:23.176, Speaker A: You didn't pick.
00:11:23.208 - 00:11:26.208, Speaker B: I just never know. I just never promise you.
00:11:26.224 - 00:11:27.140, Speaker A: It was there.
00:11:27.600 - 00:11:29.976, Speaker B: Like the defi degeneracy, though.
00:11:30.088 - 00:11:31.100, Speaker A: What does that mean?
00:11:31.720 - 00:11:54.178, Speaker B: Like, thousand percent apy. Basically that's on rebase tokens. I saw, like, a few of, like, own forks on Solana, but I. I don't know, it just never felt like. It felt like to me, it was like such a good chain. Like, it felt like a prop it didn't feel like as grimy as, like something like Phantom or Avex.
00:11:54.314 - 00:11:56.722, Speaker A: And now it feels snappy as fuck.
00:11:56.906 - 00:11:57.322, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:57.386 - 00:12:22.380, Speaker A: Make a transaction, you send something like, oh, it feels like iOS. Like, it feels pretty instant. But I remember when I first started using sold spam, the same transaction twelve times and it wouldn't go through, or one. One transfer or one swap would take, I don't know, 20 seconds, 25 seconds. And now it's sub one, sub 2 seconds. Like it's 30, 00, 40, 00, 50, 00 tp. Like right now it's at 5000 DP's no problem.
00:12:22.420 - 00:12:22.684, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:22.732 - 00:12:30.876, Speaker A: So I've been impressed with the scalability and I've never really questioned the security. So if you look at the Nakamoto coefficient for soul, it's like one of the highest out there.
00:12:30.948 - 00:12:33.020, Speaker B: What? Explain the Nakamoto coefficient.
00:12:33.100 - 00:12:59.660, Speaker A: It basically speaks on how many validators it would take to be corrupted, so to speak, to put a false transaction through. So the higher the number, the more decentralized it is, meaning the more independent users that are launching or staking their own soul in different programs. And so the more diversity you have in that, the more secure it is, is part of the premise there. And that's what the Nakamoto coefficient reflects. So I thought that was a cool.
00:12:59.700 - 00:13:03.542, Speaker B: So fully a proof of stake chain.
00:13:03.686 - 00:13:26.062, Speaker A: Or I think he's proof of his. I'm not like 99% uses proof of history and proof of stake, something like that. I'm not too familiar with the tech anymore, and I don't really care. I'm like, I don't care. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sure it's doing the job, and I'm sure they're iterating, and I'm sure it's pretty secure. And I'm acknowledging the ignorance that comes with saying, I'm sure there's.
00:13:26.062 - 00:13:27.094, Speaker A: That I haven't.
00:13:27.142 - 00:13:38.168, Speaker B: Me and Ollie basically call it, like, the nerd. What? The nerd. Like the nerd side of what's going on in the system. There's some shit that we just can't explain. That's. But what we're not in that.
00:13:38.264 - 00:13:45.900, Speaker A: What has fascinated me, though, is less of the nerd stuff and more what people are attracted to. So do you know pudgy penguins?
00:13:46.640 - 00:13:47.488, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:47.664 - 00:13:49.300, Speaker A: Have you seen their Instagram?
00:13:50.240 - 00:13:50.840, Speaker B: No.
00:13:50.960 - 00:14:09.208, Speaker A: It is fucking not Instagram stick. Really? Yeah. I saw a tweet of this dude. First of all, go check it out. But second of all, I saw a tweet of this dude who screenshotted his text with like, his high school boys. And someone sent a pudgy penguins meme in there. None of them are crypto bros at all.
00:14:09.208 - 00:14:26.458, Speaker A: They're just like that average person that doesn't know anything about crypto, and he sent a crypto meme, and he didn't realize it. And if you look at the pudgy Instagram, they are a masterclass in branding and making people relate to their product. And it's so beautiful.
00:14:26.474 - 00:14:27.666, Speaker B: It's like the cute aspect.
00:14:27.778 - 00:14:34.354, Speaker A: Exactly. But it's beautiful, and it's repeatable, and people care about it, even if you have nothing to do with pudgy penguins eth.
00:14:34.442 - 00:14:35.898, Speaker B: Wow. They've been doing this for a while.
00:14:35.954 - 00:14:39.394, Speaker A: Like, everyone can use it, and look how many followers they have.
00:14:39.562 - 00:14:42.190, Speaker B: 300 something. Thousand is nuts.
00:14:42.530 - 00:14:47.920, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty crazy. And that's what has really caught my attention recently is.
00:14:48.010 - 00:14:53.076, Speaker B: So you were doing everything, like, solo, starting off. You never were working with anybody?
00:14:53.188 - 00:14:53.676, Speaker A: No.
00:14:53.788 - 00:14:59.252, Speaker B: How was that navigating? Do you have, like, a crew of people? Like, in some.
00:14:59.396 - 00:15:00.308, Speaker A: I had what he was leaving.
00:15:00.324 - 00:15:02.116, Speaker B: You don't telegram? Honestly?
00:15:02.268 - 00:15:22.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I had a couple people that I traded with, but I did things on my own, and I really. I don't know. I never really found a squad for trading. I found a couple groups, couple discords. The soul army discord in Solana was my home base because I just got this free airdrop, and it sold for ten k. Like, within the first two weeks, I was like, oh, my God. Like, I got this for free.
00:15:22.210 - 00:15:46.070, Speaker A: What a blessing. It has been quite cool staying in that group. But at the end of the day, there's opportunity everywhere, and every day, everywhere, there is opportunity somewhere to make money. And it's really a question of, are you tuned in or are you tuned out of it? And, yeah, I was. I guess subconsciously I was more tuned out of it than I realized because I don't really partner with people. I didn't do my research. Like, I wasn't.
00:15:46.070 - 00:15:47.254, Speaker A: I was. I had a little more.
00:15:47.302 - 00:15:49.670, Speaker B: How are you finding stuff? Just, like, solely Twitter?
00:15:49.750 - 00:15:55.526, Speaker A: No, mainly discord Twitter. Twitter you can use to gauge how well something might do until.
00:15:55.638 - 00:15:56.918, Speaker B: Until, like, by the time it's on.
00:15:56.934 - 00:15:58.454, Speaker A: Twitter, it's over, but, yeah.
00:15:58.502 - 00:15:58.798, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:58.854 - 00:16:18.248, Speaker A: And as soon as, like, this botting, the Twitter botting meta came up. They could pot likes, they could pot followers. At first, it wasn't meta. And why I say this, once it became meta, it became a little bit more obscure, which projects actually had hype and which ones didn't. And it's funny, there were all these whitelist grinds and. Yeah, that shit was crazy. But I've got.
00:16:18.248 - 00:16:26.064, Speaker A: I got a few whitelists, good white lists through the soul army. And it altered my relationship with money. I sold this ok bear for 16 grand.
00:16:26.152 - 00:16:27.500, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I remember.
00:16:28.720 - 00:16:30.220, Speaker A: I lost most of it.
00:16:30.600 - 00:16:31.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:31.040 - 00:16:42.342, Speaker A: And so that taught me a lot about capital preservation and being mindful of where you put your money and aggressively taking profits. So that was a good lesson for me to learn, as painful as it was.
00:16:42.446 - 00:17:01.522, Speaker B: God, those suck, man. Even, like, to this day, I still. I feel like everyone does this. Most of the people in crypto, when you're, like, done your fucking day, you lay down in bed, shut the phone off, and you're just staring at the ceiling. All of those bad trades come to mind, at least for me. Like, over it.
00:17:01.626 - 00:17:03.714, Speaker A: I don't lose. Yeah, for any of them, but.
00:17:03.842 - 00:17:28.594, Speaker B: Oh, no, I definitely do. I definitely do some. Not every night, but, like, once a week, once a month. That's just really bad ones. Really bad ones. The thing is also that bothered me is, like, the reason I reason mean, Ollie sit here every week as much as we can talk about narratives is because. And why this show is called exit liquidity is because I was exit liquidity for so many different things.
00:17:28.594 - 00:17:43.220, Speaker B: It was like. It's, like, shameful that I couldn't map my head around, like, all these things. Like I was getting played. I mean, I had good runs, good trades, and, like, good opportunities that you probably put on under a bucket of luck.
00:17:43.340 - 00:17:43.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:43.732 - 00:18:11.462, Speaker B: But I was also, like, never taking profits where I should and, like, just always one out that door. Yeah, I was never reading. I was never reading the top. And I think that NFT part of it, you really start to understand the marketing behind every single token, not just nfts. And, like, the actually observing that, like, top for anything grifters, because your salesman. Yes.
00:18:11.606 - 00:18:16.170, Speaker A: They're so good at their craft, what they can't execute for a dime.
00:18:16.630 - 00:18:17.438, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:17.614 - 00:18:28.990, Speaker A: Except for premium. Every. Everything it takes. Yeah. And just with how rapid the Solana community has been through throughout much of its history, a lot of rug projects sold out, and it is what it is.
00:18:29.450 - 00:18:39.666, Speaker B: Yeah. So you had. Okay, bears as I feel like a good chapter. What other, like, points were, like, pretty memorable in your run up until now?
00:18:39.858 - 00:18:46.466, Speaker A: Definitely that soul army air drop. I got. I got a Kleinosaurus pre sale. Do you know Kleinosaurs are Kleinosaur?
00:18:46.498 - 00:18:50.070, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, they just had a new all time high on the floor price. Yeah.
00:18:50.150 - 00:19:02.478, Speaker A: So I got access to that pre sale for fucking 15 of them. So yeah. So I bought the full allocation. I dumped everyone as soon as I got it. Pretty much I shared it with the friend. So I got ten, he got five. Yeah, because.
00:19:02.478 - 00:19:28.864, Speaker A: Yeah, and it was a money printer for three, four, eight weeks. However, five weeks I think was how long the airdrop was. And then now I'm watching the floor price climb. Yeah, you only need to sell three and I'd be at what, 150 soul in my wallet. But I sold three for 60 at the time because I was impatient. I wanted the money and it wasn't a bad trade. I de risked but then I kept de risking aggressively until I had nothing left.
00:19:28.864 - 00:19:33.744, Speaker A: Then I just had liquid sold, which, yeah, again, if you're optimizing for taking.
00:19:33.792 - 00:19:35.376, Speaker B: Profit, what's the prices hole right now?
00:19:35.448 - 00:19:57.820, Speaker A: 21, 2079 currently. So by 50 it's what, two grand? Grand, maybe 808, 900 for a klein. Oh, right now, something like that on the floor. So yeah, definitely not terrible. And okay, bears are at 42 soul, which is funny because I sold the fucking top at 190.
00:19:58.440 - 00:19:59.600, Speaker B: Holy shit.
00:19:59.760 - 00:20:32.570, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like early, early on, which is funny too because then I reap and it led to my new rule. Cause I double dipped and I bought another bear that I thought was a steal and I was gonna get. It was a mid rare and I'm gonna get a good price on the next pump. And it's funny, the next pump came, but Solana was worth less and I wasn't willing to sell because I was, I would not be in profit. So that would have only been like a 1500 or two grand loss because it was like eleven k I put into that next bear and I was like, I'm a trader now. I know what I'm doing. Oh, he spent this big bag.
00:20:32.570 - 00:20:42.634, Speaker A: It's because I didn't know how to manage that much amount of money. And it's energy. And for as long as I was in this place of being greedy and wanting more and double dipping, it's also.
00:20:42.722 - 00:20:52.322, Speaker B: So weird, like seeing like a coin logo verse. You see it in the dollar torrent terms in your wallet or whatever. But it does not feel like that.
00:20:52.346 - 00:20:57.826, Speaker A: Kind of money doing it like magic Internet money, dude. Like, yeah, it feels, it's so abstract.
00:20:57.898 - 00:21:21.470, Speaker B: That you're just like, see, this has got to work. This has got to work. And then just fucking call. You literally will some. Like, at one point I was like, dude, did I get fucking, did my fucking wallet just get hacked? Like, where's, where the fuck did all of my money go? You just realized your transactions. You just burned through so much shit, doing massive amounts of stupid stuff and dumb trades that you shouldn't have done, but. And then you got into working for different projects.
00:21:22.130 - 00:21:40.700, Speaker A: No. So actually only worked for one project, which I still work for. Hello, Moon. So I'm a moderator there at the moment, slash somewhat community lead, but mainly moderator stuff there. And it's been a good gig. Keeps me in touch with crypto and web3. But outside of that, I've stepped away from it for the most part.
00:21:40.700 - 00:21:54.352, Speaker A: Recently, I've really delved into pickleball, which has been super fun and interesting. It's a great way to keep me active, and I know there's going to be a point where I'm gonna want to come back and play in this market again and either try to make money or collect shit out.
00:21:54.376 - 00:21:57.940, Speaker B: You don't. You're not afraid that you're, like, gonna miss something?
00:21:58.720 - 00:22:00.220, Speaker A: I'm always gonna miss something.
00:22:00.920 - 00:22:02.024, Speaker B: No, not like.
00:22:02.152 - 00:22:02.680, Speaker A: What do you mean?
00:22:02.720 - 00:22:15.314, Speaker B: Like, the major things. The major things. I feel like, from what, I don't have a good envisionment of what the last bull run was because it was just so, like, euphoric and I missed the first half of it.
00:22:15.392 - 00:22:15.822, Speaker A: Sure.
00:22:15.926 - 00:22:47.620, Speaker B: But from what I know, in the ethereum world, there were, like, a lot of different things and different narratives that people were talking about way before that happened, that happened leading up to the whole fucking thing happening. And sometimes I'm actually. I would say I'm like, I'm just as involved as I was just without the quote unquote job, but I'm still in this 24/7 like, it's bad.
00:22:47.740 - 00:22:48.600, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:22:49.220 - 00:23:09.214, Speaker B: It's like, really. It's really bad. But I feel like I have that not fear of missing out, but I just know that I'm putting in this time that you feel like you have to hit on something. Something's got a hit. You can't be, like, missing it out. If you were on, like, discord and Twitter, like, for the past week, and then you watch something pump without you.
00:23:09.302 - 00:23:17.166, Speaker A: It fucking sucks for the most part. What are you hearing about so massively, so obviously on Discord and Twitter for one or two weeks?
00:23:17.198 - 00:23:22.246, Speaker B: For instance. For instance, like the. Have you heard of Barachain?
00:23:22.438 - 00:23:23.170, Speaker A: No.
00:23:23.990 - 00:23:38.298, Speaker B: Barachain is like this. Do you know Cosmos and Adam heard of it. Yeah. That world. They're building some kind of chain with atom that's going to connect to ethereum. It's called bear chain. Utilize nfTs, like a whole different level.
00:23:38.298 - 00:23:51.786, Speaker B: They have five rebases of these bear nfts. It's actually a really fun community. I think you would like it. It's like, they're like, really fucking cool. And they recently raised. It's like bear market, but they're like. It's a call.
00:23:51.786 - 00:24:23.610, Speaker B: It's literally a cult. Like, there's no tech, there's no Devnet, there's no testnet, there's nothing yet. They just announced, like an open source code that they've released and everyone's like, anonymous. And they've been going since like August of last year. And they've had these nFts and you don't even. Nobody even knows what the NFTs will give you once a chain launches. But the assumption is if you want exposure to this new l one, then you hold that NFT.
00:24:23.610 - 00:24:53.168, Speaker B: And so, like, it's on the fucking podcast. But, like a few weeks back, I'm not putting a lot into crypto nowadays. And so I try to be sparse and make calculated small bets with what I do have in this world. And I had like, just under one eth liquid, and these fucking. The smallest rebase was at like one eth. And I was like, I gotta catch this before they start announcing shit. And I knew it was gonna happen, and they, like, I missed it.
00:24:53.168 - 00:25:05.034, Speaker B: I put a bid at one eth. It was at like 1.14. Didn't get filled at one eth, didn't get knock. It filled at one east. And it's. It pumped three the other day.
00:25:05.162 - 00:25:09.386, Speaker A: So that's what I asked myself a lot. Would you have sold the top or would you have sold if your bid went?
00:25:09.418 - 00:25:10.418, Speaker B: I would have sold to.
00:25:10.554 - 00:25:11.066, Speaker A: Would you?
00:25:11.138 - 00:25:13.066, Speaker B: My rule is double, okay?
00:25:13.138 - 00:25:13.546, Speaker A: Rules.
00:25:13.618 - 00:25:18.882, Speaker B: My rulers double nowadays. Yeah. I can't live with. I can't live with it. And I've been telling, what if, you.
00:25:18.906 - 00:25:20.202, Speaker A: Know, it's not the ceiling?
00:25:20.346 - 00:25:25.890, Speaker B: I don't, though. I can't like my financial situation right now. I have to take on every double.
00:25:25.970 - 00:25:26.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:26.482 - 00:26:01.000, Speaker B: Especially with NFT game. Like, I'm so, so new to it, but it's actually very fun. I'm so new to it that, like, I can't help but take on the doubles because it's too crazy for me. I'm too, like, especially with NFTs, it's even more emotional than, like, regular altcoins are because it's the image, it's the community. Like, you're, like, hearing shit. The devs start saying, even with the fracture, I was gonna. That was the only double I haven't taken recently because I just like the PFP and I was like, this is my image for my six followers that I just fucking want to keep.
00:26:01.080 - 00:26:31.024, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, do it for you. At the end of the day, that's what this is about. When you're trying to chase pumps or chase narratives. You're a trader and you're a consumer. And that's the realization I ultimately came to was when I think it all trading is I was a consumer of the chain, I was a consumer of these different products. I'm not actually producing or creating anything. And when I saw that relationship with all of crypto, I did some internal work and realized I don't really want to create.
00:26:31.024 - 00:26:34.688, Speaker A: I'm not a dev, I don't want to create apps. I don't want to market some nfts.
00:26:34.704 - 00:26:37.728, Speaker B: You ever thought about making a rug an NFT project?
00:26:37.864 - 00:26:56.964, Speaker A: Dude, the responsibility on that is just too crazy for me. Like, it's not worth the hassle of some. It's not worth it to me. I've seen people do it and get burned out. They have so much accountability to their fucking entitled shareholders. At least in Seoul. On ETH, I believe it's a different vibe.
00:26:56.964 - 00:27:04.332, Speaker A: But I haven't bought ETH nfts ever. And actually it's one thing I am curious about dabbling in, but if there is one nft I want to buy.
00:27:04.436 - 00:27:05.760, Speaker B: You haven't used blur.
00:27:06.500 - 00:27:08.560, Speaker A: No, but I know what it is. Really.
00:27:10.460 - 00:27:14.240, Speaker B: I wonder how many Solana NFT traders actually.
00:27:14.960 - 00:27:22.112, Speaker A: I'm sure it could amount anyone that's on money. Maxi is would have used blur and just put bits on decent projects for that.
00:27:22.176 - 00:27:25.904, Speaker B: Such a nice product. Yeah, it's such a nice, it's very nice to use.
00:27:25.992 - 00:27:39.016, Speaker A: They're building something similar right now on unsol called tensor trade. Tensor dot trade, yeah, is a pretty sick, pretty sick trading platform. I think they're gonna do something similar with their airdrop mechanics. But even then, dude, like, I don't see.
00:27:39.088 - 00:27:41.200, Speaker B: I also really do like magic Eden.
00:27:41.360 - 00:28:11.548, Speaker A: Magic Eaton's great. I just don't find myself excited about trading or making money in this way cuz like, I'm sure, I'm sure I could if I put my energy towards it. But the last time I didn't have a healthy relationship with the space raw. Yeah, I was looking at discord, refreshing Twitter, twenty four seven. And whether or not I was making money almost felt irrelevant because, like, you're just consuming. It's like at its core that didn't resonate with if I. Okay.
00:28:11.548 - 00:28:19.292, Speaker A: And to be clear, if I get to a point when I need the money and I don't have a job and this and that and, like, I'm really stretched. Like, absolutely, I'll use this.
00:28:19.356 - 00:28:25.972, Speaker B: You don't think you would do it just for the. Oh, dude, I feel like I'd stay. I'm gonna stay consumer in this world.
00:28:26.076 - 00:28:47.288, Speaker A: And there's nothing wrong with that. Consume whatever the hell you want. If there's a project you really want to be a part of, you, like the Pfp, whatever, have fun with it. And ultimately, those are the people that make the most money anyways, the people that are having fun and actually, like, vibe with the projects that resonate with them. And I think that's really cool. But when you're in this trader and you're playing these announcements and this airdrop and this liquidity pool.
00:28:47.384 - 00:28:55.192, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it gets a little messy, but me and ali are just like on 15 minutes volume on blur. And if we like something, we'll throw 0.05.
00:28:55.376 - 00:28:56.568, Speaker A: Exactly. Keep it simple.
00:28:56.624 - 00:29:21.422, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, it's very basic. Like, we're not really whitelist farming. We're not like, doing too much, but we also play, like, the other all coin narratives and things like that. I know you said that it's your, you can't talk about your current job. Are you allowed to talk about the role at all? Like, no. Not even the role? Like, not even your position name?
00:29:21.486 - 00:29:22.730, Speaker A: That's part of the NDA.
00:29:23.270 - 00:29:23.774, Speaker B: Really?
00:29:23.862 - 00:29:24.102, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:24.126 - 00:29:30.092, Speaker B: Okay. Is it? Can you even say what chain? It's on the solana. Okay.
00:29:30.196 - 00:29:31.652, Speaker A: I assumed for Solana.
00:29:31.756 - 00:29:33.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I assumed, but I was like.
00:29:33.332 - 00:29:34.600, Speaker A: You'Re a soul, maxi.
00:29:36.300 - 00:29:38.300, Speaker B: Also, how do you like it overall?
00:29:38.340 - 00:29:47.996, Speaker A: I think it's, yeah, it's pretty cool, dude. I've gotten into a rhythm with my job. I like the people I work with. I like my boss. Chill gig, but yeah, yeah, there's not too much I can go into.
00:29:48.068 - 00:29:48.340, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:48.380 - 00:29:52.452, Speaker A: That regard, and it's not here if I were to talk about it, but.
00:29:52.556 - 00:29:54.402, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just glad you're enjoying it.
00:29:54.516 - 00:29:59.010, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what it's about, dude, if you don't like what you're doing, what are you doing?
00:29:59.470 - 00:30:02.678, Speaker B: Yeah, and I remember you were talking to me about, like, you were trying to find someone.
00:30:02.734 - 00:30:05.982, Speaker A: Your major was business ops management. Business analysis.
00:30:06.006 - 00:30:17.646, Speaker B: Yeah. You were, like, looking for a traffic job. And I was like, and I knew you were, like, still in Solana, deeply. And I was like, did I hope this guy finds, like, a crypto job does not do trifle jobs aren't even.
00:30:17.678 - 00:30:19.038, Speaker A: All that really depends.
00:30:19.054 - 00:30:19.886, Speaker B: I mean, not all that.
00:30:19.958 - 00:30:28.790, Speaker A: But it really is where you. Because you can get a crypto job that pays decently. I know you wouldn't for an NFT project. And they just run.
00:30:28.830 - 00:30:37.182, Speaker B: Yeah, but I feel like it would have been. Obviously a rug is not more enjoyable than try five. But, like, the traffic, it sucked. It drained me. So.
00:30:37.246 - 00:30:38.174, Speaker A: Really hated it.
00:30:38.222 - 00:30:42.814, Speaker B: Oh, dude. I hated it. I can't go back. That's like. I can't. I'd rather.
00:30:42.982 - 00:30:44.302, Speaker A: Line. Go ahead.
00:30:44.486 - 00:30:47.454, Speaker B: I'd rather just fucking trade. 15 minutes. Blur volume.
00:30:47.542 - 00:30:52.782, Speaker A: Dude, if that's what you want to do, fucking send it, man. Do what you want to do. At the end of the day, that's.
00:30:52.806 - 00:31:00.050, Speaker B: It's. Yeah, I'd rather. I couldn't do it. Fucking suck so much. Yeah. How's life in general, though?
00:31:00.710 - 00:31:05.190, Speaker A: Are you still, like I said, dude, I found pickleball, and I have been enjoying myself way more.
00:31:05.230 - 00:31:07.650, Speaker B: You're really pushing this pickleball narrative.
00:31:08.790 - 00:31:10.530, Speaker A: You describe it as a narrative.
00:31:11.870 - 00:31:13.826, Speaker B: What's. How did you get into pickleball?
00:31:13.958 - 00:31:14.914, Speaker A: He played tennis.
00:31:15.042 - 00:31:15.306, Speaker B: Played.
00:31:15.338 - 00:31:15.858, Speaker A: Hello? Tennis.
00:31:15.914 - 00:31:16.986, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, yeah.
00:31:17.138 - 00:31:20.818, Speaker A: And then Ben Johns actually is the number one pickleball player in the world right now.
00:31:20.874 - 00:31:21.914, Speaker B: Who's Ben? Jon.
00:31:22.082 - 00:31:40.310, Speaker A: Ben Johns. So he went to UMD. He played. He did club tennis. He studied mechanical engineering, and then he went back and engineered, worked with engineers at EulA to work on his own paddle, which was pretty cool. And I know this isn't, like, pickleball thing, so I'll keep this pretty short, but basically.
00:31:42.060 - 00:31:43.920, Speaker B: It'S more interesting than crypto nowadays.
00:31:45.060 - 00:31:59.860, Speaker A: But, yeah, basically it's. I started playing. I got a membership at this gym who had. Which had a couple of nice pickleball courts. And I stuck around until I found some good players. And now I have a decent. Pretty decent squad that I'm trying to play with and link up with more.
00:31:59.900 - 00:32:10.840, Speaker B: I've seen a lot of people play, like, the tournaments. Like, a lot of local tournaments happening. It's like, picking up as, like, a real, like, a sport, like, that's gonna do, like, significant numbers. It's pretty entertaining to watch.
00:32:11.270 - 00:32:13.654, Speaker A: Is it? I'm glad you say that, but why do you say that?
00:32:13.702 - 00:32:18.510, Speaker B: I watch. I haven't watched it. I don't tune into any team specifically.
00:32:18.590 - 00:32:18.806, Speaker A: Sure.
00:32:18.838 - 00:32:45.088, Speaker B: But there was this one guy I watch on YouTube, and he just fucking plays pickleball sometimes. And it doesn't look like. I feel like it started out as an old cut, like an old person, like, retirement game, almost like with football. Average people think it is. And so I saw that transition and I'm like, this is pretty cool because if you're nimble, you can make some crazy plays with it.
00:32:45.224 - 00:33:21.964, Speaker A: Correct. But also, unlike tennis, where you have so much court to cover, even if you're playing doubles, like pickleball, it's so approachable for almost all levels and all skill levels and most ages, which is in the boomer population, playing so much pickleball, which is, first of all, it's incredible. But second of all, it's like, it is way less strain on the body than tennis because you have to cover less court, but you still have to. If you're playing at the most athletic, highest level you can, you should be pretty exhausted pretty consistently if you're playing it well, which is where the fun is. Right. You can raise the bar for yourself, and it raises the bar for everyone around you.
00:33:22.012 - 00:33:22.308, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:22.364 - 00:33:37.568, Speaker A: Which I found a lot of fun in. And it keeps me in shape, dude. Keeps me sharp. It keeps me like. It's a lot like a chess match. The higher up you go in the sense that your targets, your choosing targets, you're choosing weak sides. You're choosing a play player to pretty much abuse if you're playing doubles.
00:33:37.664 - 00:33:40.464, Speaker B: And I basically try playing an indoor court or outdoor.
00:33:40.512 - 00:33:41.400, Speaker A: Indoor door.
00:33:41.480 - 00:33:41.864, Speaker B: Indoor.
00:33:41.912 - 00:33:44.600, Speaker A: It's getting nice soon, though. So I'm gonna be outside pretty soon.
00:33:44.640 - 00:33:52.552, Speaker B: Yeah. Which is why I feel like the reason people aren't playing it here is because it's the shitty weather and there's that facility. Yeah.
00:33:52.696 - 00:34:12.096, Speaker A: But the demand is crazy. And now I'm in a good position. Tennis, like, as a player, as a young player and as somebody who's coached tennis for several years, to get into the pickleball scene, if I desire, and there's definitely demand for people to play. Have you ran into tournament for people to learn? Have I ran into what?
00:34:12.128 - 00:34:12.848, Speaker B: Any tournaments?
00:34:12.904 - 00:34:13.536, Speaker A: No, not yet.
00:34:13.568 - 00:34:13.728, Speaker B: Dude.
00:34:13.744 - 00:34:15.576, Speaker A: I picked the sport up three weeks ago.
00:34:15.768 - 00:34:16.752, Speaker B: Oh, shit.
00:34:16.856 - 00:34:17.568, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:17.744 - 00:34:21.288, Speaker B: Oh, I thought it's been, like, wild.
00:34:21.344 - 00:34:24.140, Speaker A: No, not middle of February. This is super recent.
00:34:24.480 - 00:34:29.280, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's good, though. Yeah. Like the crypto mine.
00:34:29.440 - 00:34:42.360, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly, man. And, yeah, I didn't have that 24/7 fomo. Like, as long as I'm. As long as I'm a giver, member of the space, I can't be angry that I'm not making enough money. You know what I mean?
00:34:42.660 - 00:34:50.460, Speaker B: I tweeted about this, but it's. If you made it, like, once you make it, are you still gonna be on crypto Twitter?
00:34:50.500 - 00:34:51.100, Speaker A: If I want to.
00:34:51.140 - 00:35:22.750, Speaker B: Are you still gonna be like, okay, for instance, the etherium community of people that are like the, I guess I, not the higher ups, but like, the people who obviously made millions and sure have a rug pull from 2017 and, like, they show different projects and their quote unquote angel investors nowadays, it's like those people have made it and they're still just on CT talking about this coin and that coin. You think you'll be something. You think you'll end up going that route or you just like, ever. Angel investing.
00:35:23.180 - 00:35:29.204, Speaker A: I'm not really like that. I'm not closing myself off to the opportunity, but it just doesn't excite me as much right now.
00:35:29.372 - 00:35:35.324, Speaker B: Yeah. Does what you're, does your, does your job excite you?
00:35:35.492 - 00:35:46.412, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm learning. Excites me because it's applicable to a million different industries and very supportive of me being an entrepreneur, which is even more exciting.
00:35:46.516 - 00:36:06.462, Speaker B: So if you, like, made it, if you made it and you had 100k on Twitter and, like, this specific project approach you for angel investing, it's something that you. Something you're interested in. Are you, like, getting involved for the further adoption of crypto and you want to support something that's gonna maybe be spread to the masses or something?
00:36:06.566 - 00:36:27.518, Speaker A: Dude, if I'm, if I have a position like that, if, first of all, if I made it on Twitter and I have 100K followers, that means I'm actually invested in crypto and, like, I care about what happens. And so you're, like, you're presenting like a golden, pretty much opportunity, something exciting that's gonna bring people in adoption. If it's actually a good product, I'd consider investing. Obviously, I need more info, but yeah, yeah, if I'm in a position, yeah.
00:36:27.534 - 00:36:34.678, Speaker B: I'm just trying to gauge, like, whether or not you, for me, genuinely, I feel like I genuinely care for the spaces.
00:36:34.854 - 00:36:49.036, Speaker A: I do too. I wanted to. Yeah, I wanted to succeed. I'm just not invested in the super micro of every little thing that's coming out and what's driving mass adoption next. When shit catches fire, you will know. I'll say that much. Step in.
00:36:49.068 - 00:36:58.532, Speaker B: Do you think you're, and we knew. Do you think you'll be back in that headspace? You were no. Run. No, I hope not.
00:36:58.636 - 00:37:12.238, Speaker A: Well, you asked. And will you be in that same headspace, which implies a lot of the baggage that came with it or, like, the perceptions that I had with it, and if I were to come back into this space, it would be with a revitalized perspective of what I want.
00:37:12.374 - 00:37:14.902, Speaker B: But in terms of time commitment, maybe.
00:37:14.966 - 00:37:49.468, Speaker A: It'S time commitment, but it's hard to judge, man. There could easily be a day where I just decide I'm obsessed with crypto again. But until that's the case, it's not the case. And I'm not going to try to force it. I'm just, I hope everyone is building earnestly and I trust that people are going to build better and better products and eventually it'll reach a critical threshold where people are using crypto and don't even realize that people are interacting with digital collectibles and don't realize it. And when that's when that starts to become more prevalent and I think we're seeing some of that now. Amazon wants to introduce some nfts.
00:37:49.468 - 00:37:56.060, Speaker A: Yeah, doctor disrespect was talking about it was talking about like the promise of nfts and digital collectibles.
00:37:56.140 - 00:37:58.836, Speaker B: And he was calling, he's like making a game too.
00:37:59.028 - 00:38:14.804, Speaker A: Yeah, and he was calling, ah, interesting. But he was calling people brain dead for saying, oh, it's all scam. Like I forget the exact wording of the tweet, I can't be bothered to look at it. But at the point being like he's challenging the big narrative that nfts and crypto were a scam and he's getting on board. He's a big gamer, he's a big voice.
00:38:14.932 - 00:38:24.780, Speaker B: I don't understand someone who plays a shit ton of video games. I don't understand. I understand the idea of why people hate it, hate nfts. But I just didn't think the backlash.
00:38:24.820 - 00:38:30.068, Speaker A: Would be that big people don't like change. I don't know. Yeah, it's the way it's presented.
00:38:30.124 - 00:38:32.960, Speaker B: Hey, it just felt so natural to me.
00:38:33.740 - 00:39:21.992, Speaker A: If you're a gamer, what is. How does that sound? Versus do you want this exclusive digital collectible for this Pokemon game that'll live with your person forever and you can bring it to any Pokemon game in the future that we ever make? What sounds more exciting, right? Like the latter because it's more integrated, it's more. It flows with ecosystem of the game. And people actually give a fuck about the game. And so they'll play and they give a fuck about what they're receiving. But NFTs feel forced to a lot of people, NFTs feel greedy. People already have a distrust for the gaming industry with respect to, I suspect with respect to like how corporate profit, corporate greed and like activision for example, and Call of Duty is just wrecking themselves with reshaping product and like people get tired of it and do something.
00:39:22.056 - 00:39:26.032, Speaker B: That'S probably started from the gaming world. Yeah, now that we think about it.
00:39:26.216 - 00:39:51.046, Speaker A: But like, yeah, yeah. It's essentially that it's all about how it's framed and it really level with people and like, the baggage that comes with introducing a new idea when so many people reject it. Because at the end of the day, if they're rejecting money, if they're rejecting something that's truly good for them and then truly promises something cool and unique, it'll be there and there will be demand. But if you try to shove it down their throats, like, of course they're gonna resist. I don't know.
00:39:51.238 - 00:40:27.790, Speaker B: Yeah. The final things I wanted to talk about where we were texting about it a bit about the whole Polygon Solana situation, because I've been saying this for weeks, I think Matic is a complete shit chain. I think it's because I just, I put this out there on the last episode we did. And I was like, this thing because Ali loves. He doesn't love Polygon, but he's a significant fan. And I was like, there's no to me. Because I remember like from the.
00:40:27.790 - 00:40:43.490, Speaker B: In the Ethereum community that when everything, everyone was on chain and everything was getting clogged up. Classic Ethereum things fucking, like their side chain, Washington completely clogged. It literally just fell over like a million times.
00:40:43.570 - 00:40:44.106, Speaker A: Yikes.
00:40:44.178 - 00:40:59.858, Speaker B: And it's like they do like a few instances of like business development with Starbucks and Google and everyone's like, oh yeah, they're the face of Ethereum for the real world. Like they're gonna bring the real world to Ethereum. They're not even gonna know that they're using Ethereum.
00:40:59.914 - 00:41:05.782, Speaker A: They cut fat checks to those guys today. I'm not sure what the actual value exchange was. I don't really know. I'm ignorant.
00:41:05.846 - 00:41:13.006, Speaker B: I don't know either. And I don't think anyone knows. I'm gonna be honest. I don't think a lot of people know what the real relationship is. I mean, I was.
00:41:13.158 - 00:41:15.370, Speaker A: And they hear credibility, essentially.
00:41:15.710 - 00:41:57.860, Speaker B: Yeah. And I was in, when we were in Columbia for Devcon, there was like a polygon guy there and he was like, ollie was trying to explain the Starbucks deal to me and just didn't, it didn't really make any sense. Sends why they would use it. Like it was like they're gonna build the whole infrastructure of their rewards points using polygon instead of what they use now because it's gonna cut their employee headcount by a certain amount. I feel like if everyone heard that, as that was the deal, instead of we're partnering with Starbucks and that's it, people would be like, okay, like, what does that do? Like, what does that do for. For anyone? Like, they're really. It's like, pretty shit of a partnership.
00:41:57.860 - 00:42:05.884, Speaker B: And then I saw that they made, like, an l two for Solana, and they're making a Zk evm, and they're making Solana.
00:42:05.932 - 00:42:06.760, Speaker A: What's it called?
00:42:07.620 - 00:42:09.780, Speaker B: I sent it to you. I forget what it was called.
00:42:09.940 - 00:42:12.324, Speaker A: Are you talking about jump fire dance something?
00:42:12.452 - 00:42:17.520, Speaker B: No, it was. What was it called? Eclipse? Yeah.
00:42:18.140 - 00:42:18.780, Speaker A: I have not.
00:42:18.820 - 00:42:40.828, Speaker B: They're launching Polygon SVM, L2, capable of running all smart contracts and tooling compatible with Solana. So basically, any dapp that's built for Solana can easily migrate or go multi chain to polygon. Solana virtual machine. Okay. I don't think it's tied to ethereum at all. It's just tied to Polygon, but it's just. It felt like they were.
00:42:40.828 - 00:42:51.880, Speaker B: It feels like to me that they're doing so much shit. And then a few weeks after I texted you that they came out that they had to hire, like, 15% of their staff, they burn through the polygon.
00:42:52.220 - 00:42:53.068, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I know.
00:42:53.124 - 00:42:58.636, Speaker B: Yeah, they had. They burned, like, through $150 million worth of their cash already in one year.
00:42:58.708 - 00:42:59.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:59.180 - 00:43:20.368, Speaker B: And I'm like, this fucking thing is trash. Like, this thing is trash. And they might come out with a good ck evm, but holy shit, is this thing trash? And so I was wondering, I feel like. I feel like I know your perspective already, but also, what don't I know from that situation that the Solana world.
00:43:20.424 - 00:43:46.244, Speaker A: Is, like, talking about in terms of frank d gods and him trying to move d gods to ethan ute's thematic, I personally observe, and I'm not in the discord, I only see twitter presence, and I see pretty distant takes from people just spewing their opinions about d gods and that whole ecosystem. So that's the source of my knowledge. So take that as you will. But what I've seen is basically, d God. Max. These are like, yeah, youths are the best. Polygon's the best.
00:43:46.244 - 00:43:47.492, Speaker A: Yeah, bring culture.
00:43:47.556 - 00:43:47.940, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:48.020 - 00:44:10.584, Speaker A: Awesome. I feel like most people are like, why are you moving to Polygon? Eth makes a little bit more sense in terms of attracting more mature liquidity, so to speak. So, like, people that have bored apes or punks, trade and buy your d gods in an instant, essentially without having to bridge between chains, which is cool in terms of if you think you're worthy of. Anyone can move whenever they want, but there has to be.
00:44:10.584 - 00:44:18.784, Speaker B: It's like, I feel like those guys would have bridged over to Solana. They're not like the bored ape holders are really dumb crowd and they lose their nfts like a million times over.
00:44:18.832 - 00:44:19.424, Speaker A: I've seen that.
00:44:19.472 - 00:44:25.216, Speaker B: But I feel like they're smart enough to go on Coinbase, buy soul and go on magic Eden.
00:44:25.248 - 00:44:30.776, Speaker A: It's not about being smart, though. It's about friction. If you've never done it before, how likely are you to do it? Versus if you've already done it.
00:44:30.808 - 00:44:30.976, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:31.008 - 00:44:33.260, Speaker A: Versus if it's the same eth.
00:44:33.960 - 00:45:07.942, Speaker B: But what's his name? Deep Frank was talking in a space about or on a YouTube video about a polygon in Ute's. And. And he was talking about the idea of, for instance, if you are a Game of Thrones fan, you're buying an HBO subscription. If you're. Yeah, like you're basing it off that one show and people are going to base their activity on Polygon for you. That's his thesis. So I'm like, how are you going to say that and not expect people that want d gods exposure or d gods holding to not just go to Solana? It doesn't make sense to me.
00:45:08.086 - 00:45:22.734, Speaker A: I don't know. I think part of his vision is to grow his brand's multi chain and to be omnipresent, so to speak, in a couple of different areas. And I guess he looked at matic and he was like, this has potential, definitely noise, but yeah, yeah, for matic.
00:45:22.782 - 00:45:28.262, Speaker B: As an eth maxi guide. I'm telling you, there's no way. There had to have been a check of some kind.
00:45:28.326 - 00:45:49.166, Speaker A: And that's why I'm saying that most of the people that support that matic move are Utsur d gods Maxis. And they're Frank Maxis and they support whatever he does. And for what it's worth, he's given a lot of reasons to support him almost blindly into things that he does because he's this young ass kid running this massively successful NFT project so far.
00:45:49.238 - 00:45:51.102, Speaker B: And did you watch that run up.
00:45:51.166 - 00:45:54.550, Speaker A: Visions and what do you mean d gods?
00:45:54.630 - 00:46:01.524, Speaker B: I know you're part of youths. You run the youth list. I saw that on your twitter. Oh really?
00:46:01.622 - 00:46:03.784, Speaker A: Yeah. Dumped it as soon as I got it, pretty much.
00:46:03.832 - 00:46:10.688, Speaker B: But what was like, what was that run like? Was it like. I know he was anonymous, friendly, just.
00:46:10.704 - 00:46:31.812, Speaker A: Kept making fucking marketing stunts, man. Every he would hat, he would post one thing that was, like, slightly controversial, and all of Twitter would go crazy for it. They would be like, this is shit. This is the dumbest thing you've ever done. Like, dust emissions to zero. Like, d gods zero. You guys don't build anything like a.
00:46:31.836 - 00:46:35.004, Speaker B: Zero to one innovation that he brought that no one else was bringing.
00:46:35.092 - 00:46:41.876, Speaker A: Like a cultural, like, I can make you feel something if you're part of this group kind of thing, which.
00:46:41.948 - 00:46:43.020, Speaker B: Yeah, fuck.
00:46:43.140 - 00:46:48.084, Speaker A: If you can bring fun experiences to an NFT project, you win. Right? And.
00:46:48.172 - 00:46:50.508, Speaker B: Yeah, when, right, what were those?
00:46:50.564 - 00:47:11.306, Speaker A: Give your holders fun experiences, which is one. And again, I'm. I've never held the d gods, so I can't speak too accurately, but from what I've observed, it was, like, so much hype. And so as a d gods holder, you felt like you were already a part of this exclusive list that was getting this cool new NFT, which is, first of all, it's hard to dilute your collection and still maintain value.
00:47:11.418 - 00:47:12.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:12.218 - 00:47:46.286, Speaker A: And Frank did that quite well, which was really impressive. But then there was the dust, which is decently valuable for a while. And there were these dead gods that you had to pay like a couple thousand dust to transcend it from the old art to the new art, which was cool. And then I remember he gave this offering that you can buy a rug for a certain amount of dust, and it ended up being like the USD equivalent of two grand. So you'd pay two grand for a rug, which is like a pretty funny joke for a lot of people. But some people were outraged when he offered it. Some people were like, hey, you're just here to have fun, dude.
00:47:46.348 - 00:47:47.634, Speaker B: Like a physical rug.
00:47:47.802 - 00:48:27.998, Speaker A: Yeah, physical rug. Physical rug. Oh, yeah, it's cool, right? But two grand for it. But in terms of dust, if you're just a holder and you're like, I just want to have fun with my fucking nfts, then you go buy it because you have enough dust from staking your magic Internet nft to get this magical token to buy cool shit that you care. Like, it's the fact that it was controversial and that people had so many differing, violent, aggressive takes about it, emotionally charged takes, in my opinion, his ability to do that over and over. Ute's list, the rug, the dead God transition, the dust emissions to zero. Like, these were all things that people talked about and they cared about whether they were a part of it or not.
00:48:27.998 - 00:48:53.100, Speaker A: And just that constant exposure, that constant reiteration of this is what d gods are doing, like it or not. Some people are in favor, some people are not like, people cared at the end of the day. And because people cared, it raises the ceiling of not only who knows about your project, but who cares about it. And the more people you have caring, the more volume you can attract. So, yeah, I think he's done that masterfully well. I think it's quite cool.
00:48:53.960 - 00:49:05.296, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I just want the record to be known that I'm also actively short matic. And I will be until it's $0.20.
00:49:05.408 - 00:49:15.444, Speaker A: But, yeah, for what it's worth, my personal take, I think the matic move is, like. I want to call it dumb, but it's so early to really say it's dumb. Like, it's just a move. I don't care.
00:49:15.492 - 00:49:15.884, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:15.972 - 00:49:23.956, Speaker A: Okay. At the end of the day, if you think you can do cool shit on matic, go do it. And if you don't do it, the market will decide that you didn't do it, and they will dump that good.
00:49:23.988 - 00:49:31.740, Speaker B: Time for them is the fact that magic Eden is even, like, going on there. But that could also just be a check out of the $150 million pot.
00:49:31.780 - 00:49:36.420, Speaker A: So you mean with Polygon, NFTs and shit? They hold the Ethan of teas, right?
00:49:37.160 - 00:49:38.200, Speaker B: Who magic eating?
00:49:38.280 - 00:49:41.016, Speaker A: Yeah, the support. Do they as well?
00:49:41.208 - 00:49:43.728, Speaker B: Really? No, I don't even know that.
00:49:43.904 - 00:49:54.496, Speaker A: And their business, like, the whole goal is to capture more market share. If they can do that just by adding more chains. And if they have the development tech to do it, why not, right?
00:49:54.688 - 00:49:55.320, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:55.440 - 00:49:59.402, Speaker A: And so many people hate it on magic Eden for. For a while, which is funny.
00:49:59.466 - 00:50:13.090, Speaker B: Yeah. Is there anything happening on Solana that you wanna not show, but enlighten the Ethereum? Maxi zombie close. Dgods will shit for us to search on Twitter.
00:50:13.130 - 00:50:47.436, Speaker A: Dgods will keep running, in my opinion. Kleinos making their shot at a Marvel animation studio type thing, that people can really care about these cute little characters. So that's its own vibe. And I'm sure it's for some people, actually, in terms of, like, long term bets that you can make on Seoul, it's one of the few that's probably not a bad idea. Ute's everyone knows galactic geckos had a big pump. They're this big OG project that stuck around for a while and they accumulated for months and months. And a couple days ago, they had a pretty big run up, like 40, 60% or something crazy.
00:50:47.436 - 00:51:13.358, Speaker A: And it was cool to see an OG project at recognition in this space. And you see now, like, watching geckos pump till 63 and I'm like, okay, that's around the ceiling for a mid to high tier project in terms of floor price and what people are willing to pay. Klein is in the same area. Elixir NFT is their own automated market maker. So they have an amm and holders get benefits somehow. They have a 21 sole floor price. Okay, bears.
00:51:13.358 - 00:51:16.952, Speaker A: I still don't know what they're doing. I feel like most people don't, but they're brandable.
00:51:17.016 - 00:51:18.272, Speaker B: They had a shot there.
00:51:18.376 - 00:51:30.336, Speaker A: They had a shot. But like, what do you do with that shot? What, like, what lands? What can you possibly do that's gonna make everyone excited for the next thing that's gonna come up with them and, and then do it?
00:51:30.368 - 00:51:41.780, Speaker B: I think it's that it's the character that Frank became, the figure behind a project like an Ethereum world. It's like Vitalik.
00:51:42.420 - 00:51:43.812, Speaker A: That's true. That's true.
00:51:43.876 - 00:51:48.276, Speaker B: Anything he says, like any podcast. Yeah.
00:51:48.348 - 00:51:49.000, Speaker A: Smart.
00:51:49.420 - 00:52:08.892, Speaker B: Yeah. He's a little different than Frank, I feel, but in their own worlds, I feel like I understand because I feel like I don't, I wasn't paying attention to the ecosystem on Solana. Nfts probably as well, but okay, bears, I felt, could have been like punks on Solana if they could have been.
00:52:08.956 - 00:52:41.344, Speaker A: But it's hard to create consistent demand and to actually do shit that people care about and expand your collection in a meaningful way that's non dilutive. It's a really big task to undertake and to have the market decide they care more about it than they did yesterday, which means you have to be iterating on the next thing already. And that's something that I've observed Frank is quite good at, is once one thing is done, he's on to the next thing it's been brewing is building in the process. And within a few weeks or months and some odd days, like, people are talking about him again and he wins again.
00:52:41.392 - 00:52:41.616, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:41.648 - 00:52:43.288, Speaker A: In the sense that people give a shit.
00:52:43.344 - 00:53:01.560, Speaker B: And I feel like sometimes. So people want him to win. Like, people like him so much or people he's proven, like his character. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I just think, like, you can easily relate or gravitate to his. I did.
00:53:01.720 - 00:53:02.080, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:02.120 - 00:53:13.080, Speaker B: Like, I was like, this guy's cool. Like, this guy's fun. This guy's doing something cool. And I'm like years late from the Ethereum or months late from the ethereum world, and it's still like clicks.
00:53:13.240 - 00:53:13.672, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:13.736 - 00:53:28.976, Speaker B: And so if you tell me who. Okay, bears, CEO or representative, no fucking idea. You're my okay bears representative. That's the only, like, real. That's the only connection, like, I can make. So usually a couple.
00:53:29.008 - 00:53:51.224, Speaker A: Yeah. 100% notable leaders. It's funny, the more I've really resonated with, like, what a floor price is, how much someone is willing to spend for this project, for this particular nft of this project, what it really. I have a different relationship to it now. It used to mean just money. Now it means energy. To me, money is a reflection of energy.
00:53:51.224 - 00:54:23.986, Speaker A: How much energy are. Is the market collectively willing to put into d gods to see what they're about to join the colt and pay for the next one if they're, if they feel so inclined. And it's the same thing with Ute's and Kleno and galactic geckos. Like, these are projects that the market has decided they care about, they want to see more from. And so they've invested more energy money, so to speak, into it, because they either believe you can get more return or they just want it. And compare that to all the rug projects that are worth .001 soul and haven't had a sale in the past like six years.
00:54:23.986 - 00:54:33.586, Speaker A: There's zero energy. There's zero attention moving through it. And this game is such an attention game. It's such a life game. It needs life and it needs to attract more life.
00:54:33.698 - 00:54:42.938, Speaker B: And do you think you ever step out? You've heard of the NFT fi narrative, the taking barring against nfts? Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:54:42.994 - 00:55:08.624, Speaker A: That's huge on soul. That's huge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You actually had an edge on them market if you had your finger on the pulse for which projects are way over leveraged. Because I had one friend that fuck, he lent out like some dual bots. I don't know if you heard what those are, but it was like a community rewards program for this casino on Solana. So he bought a few.
00:55:08.624 - 00:55:22.362, Speaker A: They pumped like crazy. He knew the top wasn't in yet. He took loans against other things. He bought more. He bought more dual bots cheap. He sold high. It still had so many of them in escrow that he was like, he was doing fine on.
00:55:22.362 - 00:55:56.276, Speaker A: And that behavior can predict how far a floor will crash once the interest is gone or once people decide, oh, it's time to take profits. No one's buying here. This isn't the real floor. People just. It's an artificially held floor, so to speak, because there's so many off market, so many people loaned out, so many are staked, so many people are waiting for the next 20 soul increase to get their exit. And, yeah, it's an ugly game that people play, but you have to be aware of, especially in Seoul, dude. Just the degenerate behavior of so many of so many.
00:55:56.276 - 00:56:08.680, Speaker A: These players, these consumers, like, gotta have a finger on the pulse of what the lending market is looking like if you want to have a sense of whether the floor is gonna crash, timing the top, et cetera, et cetera.
00:56:09.100 - 00:56:14.364, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. Sounds good. This was fun.
00:56:14.492 - 00:56:19.620, Speaker A: That was fun. I haven't done a podcast on Riverside. Yes.
