00:00:31.100 - 00:00:43.706, Speaker A: All right, good evening, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of exiliquidity. Episode. I'm losing track again, I want to say. 84. 80.
00:00:43.708 - 00:00:44.268, Speaker B: 84.
00:00:44.364 - 00:00:44.732, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:44.796 - 00:00:45.588, Speaker B: Impressive.
00:00:45.724 - 00:01:02.880, Speaker A: 84. And we got a crossover episode today. Fun stuff with. With. I'd say one of, if not the best, Defi podcasts out there. Maybe I'm a little biased, but I definitely think it's up there. We got and Dave from flywheel.
00:01:03.780 - 00:01:04.404, Speaker B: What's good?
00:01:04.452 - 00:01:05.388, Speaker C: GMGM.
00:01:05.524 - 00:01:06.508, Speaker B: Happy to be here.
00:01:06.564 - 00:01:07.316, Speaker A: Happy to have you guys.
00:01:07.348 - 00:01:08.300, Speaker B: Thank you for having us.
00:01:08.380 - 00:01:32.540, Speaker A: Thanks for coming on. This is gonna be a fun one. Excited to see. Excited to see some ideas clash and hopefully drop some alpha along the way. As usual, we wanna get started by just getting to know everybody, see who we have with us today. Starting off with you, Dave would love to get a little bit of background, just about who you are. Kind of what brought you into crypto, what brought you to flywheel as well.
00:01:33.520 - 00:01:56.042, Speaker B: Yeah. So, everybody defi. Dave, I've been in crypto for seven years. I started off at this website called Everpedia as a writer. I joined this website before I was even crypto. And, like, a year into it, in 2017, the guys who founded it woke up and were like, what if we were a blockchain encyclopedia? And, like, that's how I got into crypto. Like, just, like, being a part.
00:01:56.042 - 00:02:30.608, Speaker B: And, like, the people that founded this website were Sam Kazemian and a few others and Travis Moore, who went on to find, like, found fracs. So I was just, like, when I was getting into crypto, I was just kind of, like, around them and just absorbing information like a sponge. So I got quite lucky. And then in 2020, came along, then Defi started, and I really got inspired by it in the same way. Like, when I discovered Bitcoin 2017, same thing happened when I discovered Defi. I'm like, holy shit, this, like, this could really change everything. And then I kind of had, like, a whole.
00:02:30.608 - 00:02:52.178, Speaker B: I've been all over the place. I worked at Gelato for a bit. You know, I was with fracs for a little bit. And, you know, from that, I started flywheel. So been doing a little bit of everything, and now I'm at Dinero, of course, doing dinero things. So that's my long story short. Cool.
00:02:52.234 - 00:03:19.414, Speaker C: And similar to Dave, actually, I'm also class of 2017 coming into crypto. And except for Dave, I actually stuck with one firm. I was at a fund called science, basically from 2017 up until 2022. So I was pretty much with one shop while Dave was hopping around. But interestingly, science is located in Santa Monica, which is about, like a 20 minutes drive from UCLA, where Sam Kazemian and all.
00:03:19.462 - 00:03:23.750, Speaker B: Hey, I was there for four years. What do you mean, hopping around? Is that ever Peter Parker? Oh, yeah. Okay.
00:03:23.910 - 00:03:35.414, Speaker C: That's true. That's true. That's true. That's fair. That's fair. And then after that, I decided to take. I decided to take a step back from the fun and kind of caught the entrepreneurial bug.
00:03:35.414 - 00:03:55.318, Speaker C: That's effectively when Dave hit me up. I was like, hey, I got this thing called flywheel. You know, actually, in the. In the beginning, we were thinking of calling it Frax cast because we needed to take the narrative back from, you know, at that point in time. 2022 May. The worst thing you can be in crypto was these two words. It was Algo and then stable.
00:03:55.318 - 00:04:14.536, Speaker C: But that was exactly what Frax was. But they were built different. And that asterisk we built different comes with a 69 page documentation on why. So we figured we needed to take back the narrative and really kind of educate people on why this is indeed different. And, yeah, that's kind of how we kind of came together. And we'd be doing this for how long now, Dave? Almost two years.
00:04:14.568 - 00:04:20.820, Speaker B: We haven't missed a. I think we had, like, 115 episodes or something. You guys aren't too far behind. Don't worry.
00:04:21.200 - 00:04:33.670, Speaker A: Well, we'll get there. We'll get there. Dave, why? What made you call Kett specifically to get this thing started? Like, what about him made it seem like a podcast host, actually.
00:04:34.010 - 00:04:54.954, Speaker B: Kid actually hit me up in, like, march of April, 2022. He was like, Dave, come on, let's, like, start this podcast. Cause we were, like, already talking about, like, convex and the whole fracs convex ecosystem. And, like, the. But the thing is, with, like, anything in crypto, it's all about a timing thing. It just wasn't the right time. But post Luna crash, when it was just.
00:04:54.954 - 00:05:21.440, Speaker B: Everyone was just down so bad, then it became the right time. Then it was like, okay, Frax doesn't have any marketing or any education. It's quite complex. So, all right, there's an opportunity here to do something. Let's go podcast and experiment and see what we can do. Then I remember just make a bunch of random group chats, and one of them was a podcast group chat. It was me, kit, and our producer, Sam.
00:05:21.440 - 00:05:50.870, Speaker B: And then we just started making content, honestly, like, we were just like, okay, like, one pot a week. I was, like, very, very militant about that. And then first it was, like, frac centric that was like, we gotta be general. So we went general for the main pod. And, like, I obviously travel, lots of conferences and stuff. And so I think the funniest thing, if you look back at all the episodes, you can see, like, all the different backgrounds I'm in, it's like, every other week it's a different background, and, like, some of them you can, like, oh, he's like. He's a.
00:05:50.870 - 00:06:02.230, Speaker B: He's in this place. Oh, he's, like, back home. Or, like, oh, he's over there. But, yeah, we just, like, grew our content from there, and, like, flywheel was, like, a great experiment. And, you know, you know, we're pretty lucky to keep it going.
00:06:03.170 - 00:06:04.298, Speaker A: That's dope.
00:06:04.474 - 00:06:26.478, Speaker C: Yeah. To give you a more bow tied answer is that, you know, Dave is very much more like a word cell, and I am very much more like a shape rotator. And that's kind of where, like, you know, we kind of came in together. And he brings in the softer, know, philosophical, you know, poli sci elements and all the touchy feely dow stuff, as.
00:06:26.494 - 00:06:31.410, Speaker B: I like to call it, and then touchy feely dow stuff. Okay. All right. Let's see how it is.
00:06:31.790 - 00:06:33.410, Speaker C: No, no, I'm just kidding.
00:06:34.670 - 00:06:36.094, Speaker B: I'm just shitting on you. Don't worry.
00:06:36.182 - 00:06:53.058, Speaker C: It's a nice juxtaposition against my more, you know, harsher, analytical side of things. And just, you know, I actually dive into the dogs. I kind of look at. At the business models and all that kind of good stuff. So then I couldn't come in and compliment his softness with a little hardness.
00:06:53.154 - 00:06:56.030, Speaker D: Wait, we're supposed to look at the docs of this stuff?
00:06:58.810 - 00:06:59.978, Speaker B: I'm with you. I'm with you.
00:06:59.994 - 00:07:02.230, Speaker C: Sita uninformed project that's.
00:07:04.050 - 00:07:27.124, Speaker B: Kid is definitely the finance guy with the numbers, all that. All that stuff that people with numbers care about. And I'm definitely, like, more, like you said the word cell. I'm more into, like, the humanities and all that stuff and, like, asking more of, like, I guess, the right brain questions, and he's more left brain, and that's why we compliment each other well, and I don't think I could do my podcast without kid. That's honestly, like, it wouldn't be the same.
00:07:27.252 - 00:07:31.092, Speaker A: That's. You guys kind of just, like, literally described us eerily.
00:07:31.156 - 00:07:40.920, Speaker D: So I'm more figured out, like, oh, are the logos right? Is the color looking good? Is there a good story? Ellie's like, does this thing actually work?
00:07:42.730 - 00:07:56.314, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. It's. It's a it's very similar. And then same thing as you, Dave. If you watch, if you watch, like, every other episode of ex liquidity, I have a different, different background. Like, I'm always hopping around somewhere or other. It's.
00:07:56.314 - 00:08:05.522, Speaker A: And also, like, we started ex liquidity initially. A big part of it had to do with, uh, with the terror collapse. Like, that's, that's where the name.
00:08:05.586 - 00:08:07.266, Speaker B: Oh, you guys are also post terracotta.
00:08:07.298 - 00:08:14.890, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah, it was a little bit further after, but that was like, very, yeah, look, he did something good.
00:08:16.270 - 00:08:18.930, Speaker C: Instead of baby boomers, we're terrible.
00:08:20.630 - 00:08:52.544, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe some good came out of that after all. But no, that was why we ended up starting it. Or one of the reasons, at least, trying to help people avoid the same mistakes that we did that caused us to be exit liquidity. So bad, so bad, so early and so often. And that's always been mine. And Cedo's, like, one and biggest, like, exiliquidity story. And as I'm sure you guys know, that's also how we like to kick off this pod, by hearing what your most memorable moments were as being ex liquidity.
00:08:52.544 - 00:08:55.100, Speaker A: So Kit would love to start off with yours.
00:08:56.720 - 00:09:33.542, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I gave some thought on this one. I initially came in with a story, but since that we brought Terra Luna, I'd also have that one to share as well. I was also kind of caught up in that piece, so I, too, were hurt alongside you, you know, obviously in anchor as well as Mars. The landing protocol that was going to be on terra Luna. Right. Got caught in those two, and, but the story that I came prepared to share was actually about such a coincidence in timing, but it's about Arweave and ao, their new, basically super layer computer.
00:09:33.542 - 00:10:05.340, Speaker C: Um, I'm sorry, there's a supercomputer layer on top of our weave. And for me, when I, I like to consider myself, I am more technical than the next non technical guy. And when I dove into the docs of AO, I was like, yo, this, this slaps like, this is extremely different. This is literally built differently. And I got to take a look at this and dive deeper. And, but this was, frankly, a little bit later. It was maybe like a month or so before the launch of AO.
00:10:05.340 - 00:10:13.068, Speaker C: And at that moment in time, I decided to bet, like, half the farm on this thing because I was like, oh, my God, this is like, no one's talking about this. This is, this is going to be.
00:10:13.124 - 00:10:14.600, Speaker B: Do the chickens come to roast?
00:10:15.260 - 00:10:46.804, Speaker C: Oh, dude, the chicken came to roast. To reap to every r word you can think of on me. And obviously, after the AO network launch, like, you saw the AR price. And it taught me a valuable lesson that timing matters a lot, even when you have conviction. Right? And I said this to my buddy. My buddy told me, he's like, bro, now is not the time to have conviction. Deep in the bear, when no one else has conviction is when you have to have conviction.
00:10:46.804 - 00:11:05.984, Speaker C: And I was like, damn. Like that. That really resonated with me because I really felt like this thing is really big, and I still am farming al. So full disclosure there as well, too. Like, I still believe in it, and I still think it was. It's literally going to be the next way. Blockchain's architecture will be like, but I need to time my conviction better.
00:11:05.984 - 00:11:08.860, Speaker C: And that was the lesson of that. Of that story.
00:11:09.720 - 00:11:11.064, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a very cool lesson.
00:11:11.112 - 00:11:14.368, Speaker A: Timing's a tough one. Timing is a tough one for sure.
00:11:14.424 - 00:11:17.860, Speaker B: We may or may not have. Are we podcast coming out this week?
00:11:18.760 - 00:11:33.896, Speaker C: Literally. That's why it's so coincidental. But no, no, it's not just timing. Timing is the obvious part. But I felt that if I had conviction, timing irrelevant, right? But actually, no, you know, actually there isn't. There is a time to be convicted. Nice.
00:11:34.048 - 00:11:41.340, Speaker D: There's a very well thought out is liquidity story. I don't know if many people come. Come to the table with that. It's a tough one to follow, Dave.
00:11:43.000 - 00:12:02.460, Speaker B: Lesson learned. All right, I thought of this. Okay. I want to, like, you know, like, kind of set the context here. This is like my first cycle, 2017, 2018. And, like, the big, like, the hot new kid on the block was eos. I think everybody remembers Eos.
00:12:03.080 - 00:12:03.776, Speaker C: Yes, yes.
00:12:03.848 - 00:12:14.992, Speaker B: And like, the lip balm. Yeah, no, yeah. Eos. Eos was the original Ethereum killer. It was like the original high throughput. I mean, low, you know, low latency. Like trans.
00:12:14.992 - 00:12:41.460, Speaker B: Like, every pitch of alt one before. Like, Eos was, like, the first one of it. And so anyways, like, where I worked at Everpedia, they were building on eos. And so, like, I was, like, my first cycle where I see myself, I see us building on Eos, I see, like, all this stuff happening. I don't know anything because I'm so fucking new. I shit you not. I was getting paid in Eth, and I would, like, convert all the Eth into es.
00:12:41.460 - 00:13:15.912, Speaker B: That's not the most painful part. That's not even the most painful part. Yeah. And so the time comes when, like, you know, because they had their ic the year long ico and, like, it was on Ethereum, but they had to, like, convert, go to Eos and stuff. And so my paranoid ass writes his seed phrase on paper, and he writes it wrong. I write it wrong. And, like, when I go to, like, put it in, it's, like, not working.
00:13:15.912 - 00:13:39.438, Speaker B: The fuck. What do you mean it's not working? And I got, like, a strong lessons about, like, double cryptography. Double key cryptography right there. I spend, like, a year trying to, like, get. I wasn't the only one with this problem, so I spent, like, my year trying to get my, like, key back. And that whole time else is just dumping to zero. Like, I think its high was like 20 and then just, like, dumped to zero.
00:13:39.438 - 00:14:00.626, Speaker B: And then, like, I finally got it, like, unlocked and, like, by the time it got unlocked, it was like 90% down. And so there's, like, a few lessons learned there. Few, like, first cycle lessons about hype trains, few lessons about, like, key management right there. But you know, that, that's my exit liquidity story, so it a lot of pain.
00:14:00.738 - 00:14:35.112, Speaker D: That's a rough one. But these are all, like, the core. I feel like, as you guys say, these you, like people who've experienced them and everyone I feel like has experienced each of those, like, are just imagining themselves making those same mistakes back in the day. So it's, like, inevitable. And I think, like, sometimes you forget about those stories because when I'm talking to new people who are, like, onboarding, the. The biggest thing I tell them to worry about is, like, phishing links and kind of just, like, every link out there is, like, probably gonna try and steal your. Steal your shit.
00:14:35.112 - 00:14:44.856, Speaker D: But you forget about, like, the basic stuff of figuring out conviction and timing and then writing down offer, like, private key and all.
00:14:45.048 - 00:14:51.216, Speaker B: She just had an encrypted file, like a normal person. Like, whatever it is what it is.
00:14:51.328 - 00:15:38.760, Speaker D: And speaking of, like, killers, Eth hype trains, I feel like we're all sort of Eth boys here. And it's been a, it's, it's been a, it's been a rough journey this, this cycle. And I'd say, like, part of the news these last few days was around this, like, what, 17%, 70 billion wiped in like four minutes on, on the ETh chart. And just, I think Ali and I were staring at that on a call watching that just nuke live. So that was pretty fun. What are you thinking about, Eth? What are you thinking about? Kind of what happened there? Any thoughts, any insider info that you guys have on that?
00:15:41.020 - 00:16:05.194, Speaker B: My feelings towards EtH, this cycle are just, like, to give context for the past seven years. It's like when you first got. When I first got into crypto, it's like, all bitcoin. It was like the bitcoin, the hard fork. Everything was still, like, bitcoin centric. But then really, like, 2020, I think if I had to, like, describe bitcoin, bitcoin is all about, like, scarcity. Like, oh, like, I'm going to get in the Citadel, 21 million, blah, blah, blah, which is great.
00:16:05.194 - 00:16:27.270, Speaker B: It has its, like, place. But I think Ethereum in 2020 really had a moment of inspiring builders that we haven't seen. And, like, that's. I think that's. That's kind of like the root and that all of us come from. We saw, like, the magic that happened on ETH with Defi NFTs, even daos. Like, all this stuff in 2020, 2021, it was all happening on ETH in one place.
00:16:27.270 - 00:16:55.808, Speaker B: It was like, wow, this shit. Like. Like, if bitcoin is about digital scarcity, then, like, ETH is more about abundance and we can, like, create this world together. And so that was definitely a high point for ETh. The problem is, though, like, this cycle, it's like, eth has, like, a few problems, like, a few things going against it. One, it's like the mind sharing attention is split between all these different l two s that claim to be, like, Eth aligned. Yeah, I mean, you have, like, optimism.
00:16:55.808 - 00:17:04.200, Speaker B: I mean, optimism. So eat the line. But they're like, oh, we're not an l two. We're a super chain. You have, like, you know what else you had, like, blast. I'm not, like, l two anymore. They're doing, like, blast, whatever.
00:17:04.200 - 00:17:29.540, Speaker B: Like, full stack chain. Who knows what the fuck they're doing? But, like, you basically have, like, the attention in mind. Share being just, like, stripped, like, death by a thousand cuts. The second thing is just like, it's just like, it seems like Eth hasn't just, like, kept up with, like, the times or the. There's, like, a disconnect between. There's always been a disconnect between, like, the Eth foundation and, like, the builders. Like, that's existed even before defi summer.
00:17:29.540 - 00:17:51.226, Speaker B: But, like, it seems like that disconnect is even more so now. And now, like, before there wasn't competition. It was just like, eat. But now you have, like, Solana, you have, like, other things. You have, like, other all, like, evms. So there's, like, actually competition, which is good because it, like, forces eth to, like, get up off its ass to do stuff. Like, I still have, like, faith in Eth.
00:17:51.226 - 00:18:29.428, Speaker B: Like, I think eth, its power and value comes as, like, itself as an asset. Like, the fact that things are denominated in ETh, like, especially gas, is, like, for the most part on all these l two s are still in eth. What else? Like, you know, things being priced neat, like nfts and, like, whatnot, I think that plays the eth strengths. And, like, eth is still, like, the most decentralized, you know, world computer, quote, unquote. So it has that going for it, but, like, and I think it'll be fine long term. But, like, I feel like ETh is going through what bitcoin went through in 2020, 2021. Like, it's just like, some, like, there's some, like, ossified, like, parties and, like, talking heads and, like, things are a bit stale.
00:18:29.428 - 00:18:51.622, Speaker B: And, as, like Machiavelli said in the discourses, olivia, like, the body, like, corrupts over time. And so you just got to, like, clean the body a bit. It just needs, like, a little bit of refresh. It needs, like, a little bit of, like, new life. Like, I have faith in eth, but, like, I'm not sure where it is. Like, if I learned, like, one thing, like, the one thing I've been doing, honestly, it took me seven years to realize this is, like, I'm just, like, d saying to bitcoin. I'm just, like, so fucking tired of, like, chasing shit.
00:18:51.622 - 00:19:06.690, Speaker B: I'm just like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm just gonna desaint to bitcoin. That's it. I've, like, played, like, what? What? You know, I'll play, like, trends and shit here and there, but, like, I'm just gonna, like, desain to bitcoin and not touch it. That's what I'm doing. Not financial advice, of course, but, yeah, that's. Sorry, that was a long rant.
00:19:08.990 - 00:19:52.216, Speaker C: Yeah. Um, what was the question again? Just like, oh, I'm just kidding. I'm scared I did that to break the comic relief. But, yeah, ETh is one of my biggest, you know, holdings as well. And it's just, I think we have this for those who've been in multiple cycles, we have this almost, like, legacy mind where we just can't help but have Eth in the port. And that's why I'm so jealous of all these, like, news cyclers or folks who are very much more fluid in their mindset and mental is that they can just switch to the meme train and just be, hey, this is like, the meme is the meta, and that is it. Sell all your eth, stay in stables, and just ape into means when you're ready, you know, or, you know, stay in Seoul and ape into memes when you're ready.
00:19:52.216 - 00:20:22.170, Speaker C: And, like, I wish I had that mental, you know, elasticity for me to be able to just switch like that, but I just couldn't. I just. ETh is home. ETh feels comfortable, and there's, you know, and you always should stretch beyond your comfortability levels. So that's, at least for me, on, like, a mental level, on, like, a traitor s level is. That's what kind of grounds me to Eth now, in a macro sense. I feel like Dave is kind of spot on about Eve's attention and love, and my share kind of got fragmented.
00:20:22.170 - 00:21:33.390, Speaker C: The modular money thesis pretty much was like the death to the ultrasound money thesis, because if you think about it, initially before the l two s or actually before Celestia kind of, or any da layer, you know, projects came out, l two s had to settle all of their transactions and post their transaction data, as well as the proofs, all onto Ethereum, which is really expensive, right? Because gas is expensive. But that is how you demonstrate ETH alignment. ETH alignment doesn't mean, hey, I'm gonna use the eVm, but never touch the eth chain. Like, that is not eth alignment to me. And on a podcast with a spider chain, which is a BTC l two, that is EvM. I asked, you know, the founder direct, I was like, would you consider yourself, you know, Eth aligned, right? And she said, no. And I think that's very truthful and honest, because, like, if you just use the EVM and you don't really touch the ethereum chain or, quote, pay your dues, then how are you eth aligned? Right? You literally just took all the good things of Eth, that you took the evm, all the toolings and everything that you've had to kind of grow, go through the growing pains for, and you're just using it without ever paying your dues to the base chain.
00:21:33.390 - 00:22:09.816, Speaker C: So, like, that's, you know, I think, David, spot on there where it's like the modular of everything is kind of taken away from eth itself. Now where it's going to go, I feel like zero. I mean, again, this is probably just lazy thing on my end, but. But it's zero. But I can guarantee you all four of us have Ethan our portfolio. Right? So then, like, why? Why are we doing that, right? Like, I. I'm trying to get to the root cause there, and maybe I'm just talking to the wrong people because everyone has Eve and has this, like, kind of legacy minded, but I'd love to throw it back on you guys.
00:22:09.816 - 00:22:14.776, Speaker C: Like, why are you still holding eve if you think it's going to go to zero or. I'm not zero, but you know what I mean?
00:22:14.808 - 00:22:16.180, Speaker B: The masochists, like us.
00:22:16.760 - 00:22:17.432, Speaker C: Yeah, masochist.
00:22:17.456 - 00:22:29.928, Speaker D: I mean, when you frame it like that, it sounds like you're in, like, almost like a. It sounds like we're in, like, a very toxic relationship or like, it's like a very. It's like, PTSD driven. Like, action.
00:22:30.064 - 00:22:31.640, Speaker C: Yeah, she beats me, but I like it.
00:22:31.720 - 00:22:59.736, Speaker A: I think I. I think I feel like there's valid answers. Like, there's valid reasons to hold ETH right now while also being, like, bearish on its price action long term. And I think that's part of the reason why it's, like, performed so poorly this cycle, because everyone, a lot of people, it feels like, have just had this. Like, I'll be in ETH until x happens, and then. And then, you know, I'll rotate to this or I'll be more risk on. In that direction or in this direction.
00:22:59.736 - 00:23:42.840, Speaker A: Like, I still think the best yield opportunities are on ETH or are denominated in ETH if you're an airdrop farmer. I still think the best airdrop farming opportunities require you to hold or do something with Eth. Like, just by. Just with those two, you cover, like, eigen layer, pendle, symbiotic, as well as, like, some of the deeper, like, some of the deeper lp stuff that you don't really have on Solana or any other chain. If you want to generate yield, you hold ETH. Basically, the issue there is that a lot of that is propped up artificially. I think Eigen layer restaking is really going to.
00:23:42.840 - 00:24:03.530, Speaker A: It's not going to be erased to zero, but it's going to be erased down to, I don't know, some single digit percent, whereas right now it's some single digit plus whatever Eigen is worth, which it's like, I don't remember. I don't remember what that mean was, but it's like, it could be anything. You know, it's probably only, like, 5%, but it could be anything.
00:24:03.910 - 00:24:17.886, Speaker B: Can't remember what Sam said. We'll do a little preview of what Sam of from our. We've said on our pod. It's like, why do you need, like, $10 billion or whatever restake to secure a, like, ten dollar transaction. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
00:24:17.958 - 00:24:51.780, Speaker A: It's. And I think, like, a lot of. A lot of that activity is like, medium term thinking, right? Because all these points programs are going to come to an end. ETH restaking yield is going to trend downwards in the long run, and that thesis is going to start to run out, I think. And that's where you can say, okay, right now, yeah, I want to be farming symbiotic or whatever on 50 wallets. I want to have this many yield tokens. I want to be holding this many principal tokens for like, 20%, whatever.
00:24:51.780 - 00:25:05.216, Speaker A: But in the long run, like, that's going to run out. And then what's left? Like, are we. Do we flip back to the ultrasound money thesis? Do we flip back to, like, X, Y and Z? Like, that's where I don't have an answer. I haven't thought far ahead enough.
00:25:05.288 - 00:25:21.584, Speaker B: I don't know. It's like, I feel like this cycle, it's like, well, with. It's trying to be like, ultrasound money, but BTC is like digital gold. It's not exactly BTC as money. It's not exactly so in execution. And, like, that's how people are framing it, that it's in the middle. It needs to, like, I don't.
00:25:21.584 - 00:25:49.608, Speaker B: I feel like ETh just needs to go, like, back to its roots somehow. If we can go back to its roots of, like, encouraging builders to cool, to build cool novel shit that people want to use, then the rest will work itself out. Like, I think in 2019, when it was the depths of back, that bear, like, none of us could have imagined Defi, it was like there was no. There was no such thing as on chain. There was no liquidity in the centralized order books. Like, the only thing that was happening is, like, liquidity money and mining on centralized exchanges. And that was all wash trading.
00:25:49.608 - 00:26:03.580, Speaker B: That was the only thing that was happening. And then Defi came along and surprised a lot of people. So first eth to, like, you know, kind of reclaim its place on, like, carving its own path without being a mid curve. It needs to, like, come up with novel shit again.
00:26:03.880 - 00:26:25.150, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's happening to some extent. Like, obviously not as much as we would like to. And in the bull, it's always kind of. It's always kind of tough to filter out that stuff. But I'd like to think there is still cool shit going on. You said something earlier, Dave, when you were responding to this you mentioned, like, oh, eth has competitors now. Like, there's Solana, there's whatever other alt l one.
00:26:25.150 - 00:26:31.826, Speaker A: Like, how long is that list after Solana, realistically? Like, is there really any vibe?
00:26:31.978 - 00:26:35.706, Speaker B: No, no, not right. Not yet. Not right now. It's just Solana.
00:26:35.778 - 00:26:37.830, Speaker A: Yeah, ao.
00:26:38.730 - 00:26:40.626, Speaker B: Not yet. All right.
00:26:40.698 - 00:26:41.670, Speaker A: Timing buddies.
00:26:44.050 - 00:26:44.786, Speaker B: Just kidding.
00:26:44.858 - 00:26:55.510, Speaker A: Do you guys think that, like, would eth be. Would eth sentiment be as bad as it is right now without Solana? Like, is Solana kind of like, is it the eth killer we thought it would be?
00:26:58.530 - 00:27:05.518, Speaker B: I don't. Like, I wouldn't. I mean, it's. It's. I wouldn't say it's killing Ethan. I don't, like frame. I know.
00:27:05.518 - 00:27:31.514, Speaker B: I know I said, like, they're competitors, but, like, I don't think, like, any of these things are gonna go to zero. Like, I don't think, like, there's no way eats going anywhere. But I like, I think Solana is, like, making people reevaluate. Like, oh, shit. Like, we need to, like, actually focus on, like, things that users want, like ux and this and that. And honestly, I was, like, thinking about this, like, how I'm thinking about, like, blockchains now. Like, people like, oh, blockchains are countries.
00:27:31.514 - 00:27:48.906, Speaker B: I'm, like, thinking, like, no, like, let's, like, think of blockchains, like, different blockchains as websites. They're basically different websites. And all the apps are, like, the different features on the website. You're basically, like, going to, like, the different websites to do shit. And so, like, what I'm think. I think, like, in, like, the next iteration of crypto. And I feel like.
00:27:48.906 - 00:28:13.164, Speaker B: I think, like, Kane with Infinix is really executing on this well. Is, like, thinking about consumer ux. And, like, you don't even think about, like, the. You don't even think about the servers that your websites are on. You just go to the fucking website. And so, like, that will probably be, like, the novel cool shit I'm talking about will probably be on that level. And then each just has to be, like, friendly to, like, to that stuff.
00:28:13.164 - 00:28:34.226, Speaker B: I mean, what ETH has to its advantage is that it's, you know, it's decentralized. It has most of the liquidity and capital. It's been around the longest. So that's what it has to its advantage. It just needs to get, like, a bit more performant and, like, being attractive destinations for these, like, what I call, like, the future, you know, web browsers. Like, what's gonna be, like, the chrome? It's not gonna be fucking metamask. It's gonna be something else.
00:28:34.226 - 00:28:40.106, Speaker B: I don't know what it is. It's gonna be something else. But yeah, yeah.
00:28:40.138 - 00:29:14.680, Speaker C: So let me jump in here. And to answer your question, ali, I think if Seoul weren't here, we would still feel salty because of the ETH ratios. It's particularly ETH BTC, right. I feel like regardless, since the beginning of time, that ratio has been there. And if you just kind of look at it, you just see it as, like, the saddest thing, right? Regardless of Solana being there or not, like, you still see that. I feel because of that, we're always going to have a comparison point between ETH and something else, right. Rather than ETH against ETH.
00:29:14.680 - 00:29:48.972, Speaker C: Now, one thing Dave said that I kind of came to the realization is, like, in 2017, there was a chance of existential threat. Like, all of this could go to zero. In the bearer of 2021, it proved that, hey, now, ETH, or just BTC, has a non zero price. At the very least, ETH and BTC have a non zero price and that it will survive. So that, for me, is, like, almost this lizard brain in the back of my head. It's, like, total Eth. You know, that shit's not going to zero.
00:29:48.972 - 00:30:00.720, Speaker C: Everything else could. So that's effectively an element to it of why, like, I'm still holding ETH and it's such a large portion of it, but, yeah, that's. That's kind of the way I would frame it.
00:30:01.460 - 00:30:03.800, Speaker A: Feels like a pretty low bar, doesn't it?
00:30:07.020 - 00:30:09.652, Speaker C: It is the lowest bar. It is the lowest bar.
00:30:09.716 - 00:30:10.360, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:10.710 - 00:30:12.210, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know.
00:30:12.910 - 00:30:18.014, Speaker C: How about you guys? What is your guys's high bar for Ethan? What does success look like?
00:30:18.062 - 00:30:25.934, Speaker B: I love how he gets a podcast mode kid. It's funny. It's so funny. Like, being on the other side of sea. Like, oh, wow. That's what it feels like to be interview.
00:30:26.022 - 00:30:44.268, Speaker A: We take turns passing the mic. I don't know. I spend. I think I spend more time on Solana and insult Solana communities than the self proclaimed eth. Maxi, I never. I kind of got into that dollars.
00:30:44.444 - 00:30:45.920, Speaker D: While I just watched.
00:30:46.740 - 00:31:19.880, Speaker A: I tried to get close, but I don't know if I got that exactly, but I was in Solana from before all of the Alameda stuff. And then, as well as for the downfall of it and being around through that, as well as most of early 2023, when things were boring and everybody thought it was going to go to zero, it was pretty. It was pretty clear to see that things weren't, like, going anywhere like that. There was still a lot of really productive activity and just honest, honest good builders there.
00:31:20.460 - 00:31:21.240, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:21.660 - 00:31:23.268, Speaker A: But, like, what it is today.
00:31:23.324 - 00:31:24.348, Speaker C: Shout out, Cindy. Drift.
00:31:24.404 - 00:31:56.770, Speaker A: Yeah, drift. Great team. But what it is today compared to where we were a year ago or like a year and a half ago, I never could have dreamed that it would have come to be as big as it is now. It's, like, seriously starting to give ether run for its money and lots of very key metrics. And, like, you can go and say, like, yeah, it's all meme coin trading, but I mean, you can, you can boil down any action to, like, acting with financial incentive and, like, it's all the same, really.
00:31:57.470 - 00:32:40.130, Speaker B: I have a question for you. So, like, what I guess I remember in, like, 20, 2021, everybody was, like, talking about, like, the flippening, the flipping, like, oh, it's going to flip in BTC. Like, do you feel like the soul eat flippening is, like, more possible? And I hate saying that word because I know, like, when I know I'm not saying it now because everything's down, but whenever, like, soul doesn't run up and someone says flipping, it automatically goes down. But, like, always the top. But, like, now in this, like, do you feel like it's, like, more, like, does it, do you feel like it's more likely now that there could be a flipping or, like, close, like, running to its funding for that to happen? Because I think we all agree nothing's, like, going to be the killer, but, like, they're like, do you think it's like, a real possibility?
00:32:41.350 - 00:32:52.670, Speaker D: So, yeah, I mean, I see, like, the DJ news account, like, as soon as even like, a penny or, like, just like, an incremental all time high, they're just, like, so quick with saying new soul.
00:32:52.790 - 00:32:55.490, Speaker A: That account is straight misinformation.
00:32:56.750 - 00:33:57.408, Speaker D: Every single, every single large liquidation, they're just, like, posting. It's fucking hilarious. But I think, I think the same way. I feel like back when, I feel like even when the, like, we went to proof of stake in eth world, there was the whole, like, flipping narrative starting to come back. And, like, I feel like in my mind, even though I was very uneducated back then, there was, like, there were all these metrics I had in my mind on, like, how much eth was being used, how much better it was as, like, a general system, and, like, all these boxes checked off in my mind and what seemed like everyone else's minds, and then it just didn't happen. And then like we just got fucking like nuked. In terms of ETH BTC, I want to say, I mean for my own bags, but like, I mean I have soul, but like in terms of the flipping of ETH and soul, I think the same thing will happen.
00:33:57.408 - 00:34:13.512, Speaker D: It's just there's like, you think every single checkbox is like checked in terms of marks to kind of have soul be more valuable than ETH and then it just won't happen. I have no fucking idea why, but that's what I think.
00:34:13.656 - 00:34:19.400, Speaker C: So I love that. My question was about what is the success s looks like for Eve?
00:34:19.440 - 00:34:21.900, Speaker A: And then we just talk about salt.
00:34:23.400 - 00:34:25.280, Speaker C: Okay, that tells me all.
00:34:25.360 - 00:34:29.020, Speaker D: Well, no, I think I kind of subscribe to some of the like tradfi.
00:34:29.600 - 00:34:35.464, Speaker A: Adoption and, yeah, tokenization, tokenization on chain ETF flows.
00:34:35.512 - 00:34:35.784, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:35.832 - 00:34:53.026, Speaker A: Interest rate of the information age. All that stuff makes sense to me. But like, like, you know, right now we're also trading like, you know, we're trading meme coins and have like all this other stuff, all of these like real hard like solid metrics on Solana.
00:34:53.178 - 00:35:13.350, Speaker B: But yeah, let's take like a step back for a sec. It's like, okay, like right now in the moment, it's like meme coins and shit. Okay, great. But like let's take a step back. Like, let's look at like a little long term, guys. It's like, look a little bit long term with Defi Ali we mentioned earlier about like Defi on ETH is just like a lot more mature and like works better. It's just cleaner.
00:35:13.350 - 00:35:37.128, Speaker B: Like, I think there's like something there. I feel like I take, take a step back with like Eth. It's like Defi itself is like in its like weird middle. It's like growing pain state where it's not as like novel as like meme coins and shit on Solana, but it's not exactly like tradfi yet. It's, it's getting there. It's growing and it's getting there. And like, I have no doubt in my mind that Defi will be like underlie all of global finance.
00:35:37.128 - 00:36:09.236, Speaker B: It's just a matter of like how we get there. And so I, I like, and it's interesting seeing things I don't mean to plug like, where I work with Daenerys. You had Sami on like last week or two weeks ago with the Bloomberg news of the income fund of the income thing of IPX. That's huge. Like basically creating rails for tradfi that they understand that they can comply to. To get on board with Defi. Doing more stuff like that is like how we win in Defi.
00:36:09.236 - 00:36:42.256, Speaker B: And that's how, like, more TVL grows on chain. Like, Defi is like, what's it like? Not even 100 billion, maybe it is, like, I think deep, like, I'll make this statement. I think Defi is in what bitcoin was in like, 2013, 2014. I think it could, like, really cat, if you, like, think about it on that scale and, like, how big it can get into, like, the trillions and, like, what's global finance? Tens of trillions. Like, then we're, like, really early to that. It's just, like, so hard to see because it's everything so fucking cooked right now. Defi's just been down on, you know, what's been worse than Eth? It's Defi.
00:36:42.256 - 00:37:08.978, Speaker B: Defi has just been, like, bleeding like this. There's been no bull market for Defi. It's just been, like, red. But if you take, like, a step back and, like, once regulations get cleared up and, like, we get, like, defined, like, okay, this is what we can do and not to, or, like, this is what you can do and not to. And then, like, these, like, actual, like, people with money go and play with Defi and go on chain, then it's game over. Then, like, wag me. I dare I say it, just to.
00:37:08.994 - 00:37:12.530, Speaker D: Play devil's advocate there. I think some of the.
00:37:12.650 - 00:37:13.310, Speaker C: Please.
00:37:13.810 - 00:38:00.246, Speaker D: I was about to do it. Thank you. Sentiment you hear from, like, the Solana people when it comes to institutions getting involved with, like, maybe ETF's, I hear less about kind of defi on Solana, but just institutions being involved in that ecosystem at all. It's like, I feel like, in their minds, once the ETF for ETH is greenlit, regulations for ETH world stuff is greenlit. There's no reason for Solana world to get greenlit. And then it's just a game of almost ux. I think that's maybe the argument on the other side for, like, part of that.
00:38:00.246 - 00:38:32.592, Speaker D: I tend to believe the case for ETh having more institutional adoption makes a lot more sense. I think, like, it was solidified. I saw, like, I mean, there's still a chance for these, like, l two s that are specific for institutions to maybe work out. But I don't think that that's. I think, I don't think that's going to be, like, a winning kind of thing. I think they're actually just going to do stuff on ETh. But, like, what do you think about kind of just the, like, if, if it.
00:38:32.592 - 00:38:47.100, Speaker D: If it's like, a six months, six month time window between, like, these kind of approvals happening for the ETH ecosystem and Solana happening and then them having happening for the Solana ecosystem, do you think that's, like, enough of a lead for ETh? Or do you think.
00:38:48.600 - 00:38:49.904, Speaker B: Oh, you mean, like, for, like, a.
00:38:49.952 - 00:38:59.520, Speaker D: Sol ETF or sole ETF or, like, kind of clarity and regular, like, insight onto how institutions could, could do stuff on chain on Seoul? I mean, like, the.
00:38:59.860 - 00:39:11.640, Speaker B: I don't. Didn't yet. Didn't the sec just, like, take back. I could be wrong, but didn't the sec just take back saying, like, oh, yeah, they did. Like, saying, like, so, like, isn't a security. Okay, that's good. That's step in the right direction.
00:39:11.640 - 00:39:40.830, Speaker B: I don't know. I guess, like, it's hard to say because the. That world just moves so much slower. And even with the ETH ETF, even with the bitcoin ETF, like, I don't expect the inflows to come in for, like, months, if not years, like, the proper inflows and stuff, maybe, you know, probably not until, like, 2025 for the bitcoin ETF ETh. Like, who knows? So, like, it's hard to say with. So I think, like, I feel like it's on such a long time ago that six months is enough time to, like, give it an answer. Yeah.
00:39:41.770 - 00:39:56.452, Speaker C: Okay. Okay. Let, let me ask the panel here then. Let's. Let's. Let's go with tokenization. No, I have to, because I got all the brains here, right? What, am I going to sit back and not tap the brains? So let's think about this.
00:39:56.452 - 00:40:23.106, Speaker C: Let's take this all the way through. It's like, okay, tokenization is here. You know, think is the man. He is the ultimate person to bring, you know, ETh on chain and ETH defi, everything is regulated. You're gonna get a, you know, 1099 B from your local defi protocol, and you're gonna have to submit to get your taxes. Everything is figured out right. How does that translate into EtH price going up? Right? Like, one way.
00:40:23.106 - 00:41:00.800, Speaker C: Let me just kick off the conversation here is ETH becomes so productized, it just weaved into every single product, just like how Apple is, or just like, how the S and P 500, as, like, an ETF, as an index, is incorporated across all of tradfi. I can see that kind of playing out. ETH becoming a staple part of everybody's portfolio, and everyone just buys into ETH and just kind of holds it. Okay, I could buy that. But now how about like all these other tokenization bit, like, do you think the amount of gas that's going to be generated is going to really cause, you know, eth price to go up or, you know, where does that price appreciation comes from?
00:41:03.340 - 00:41:04.548, Speaker A: Yeah, I think.
00:41:04.684 - 00:41:05.612, Speaker C: Don't all just jump in.
00:41:05.636 - 00:41:53.440, Speaker A: No, no, I'll take a stab. It's a good question. It's a difficult question. Um, I, I guess like the, the clearest and like, most ideal answer is that if we have meaningful economic activity on chain, it will come back to ETh, either in the form of, of burning of whatever. L two, we're on paying sequencer fees that end up translating into, uh, translating into, like, not crazy. I mean, I. The gas debate on mainnet is like a challenging one, but there is some equilibrium that we should be able to approach that would be a net positive enough to make eth in demand, but not so much that we're just deflating supply like crazy.
00:41:53.440 - 00:42:04.020, Speaker A: We've had the former in the past couple of months. Before this big crash, Gui was single digits for what? Multiple months.
00:42:04.060 - 00:42:04.540, Speaker C: Lovely.
00:42:04.620 - 00:42:05.772, Speaker A: In like a bull market.
00:42:05.876 - 00:42:07.852, Speaker B: Low gas, it's finally been achieved.
00:42:07.996 - 00:42:19.124, Speaker A: It's like, edits. It's crazy how the narrative is like, it's like nobody's using, no, it's using the chain. No one's using the chain. Gas is low. Nobody wants to fucking use a chain. It's a ghost chain. And then when everybody's actually using our gas is too high.
00:42:19.124 - 00:42:43.334, Speaker A: Like, this is unusable. It's like we can't never win. But no, I'd like to think that we reach a point of equilibrium. Like, eventually, eventually we come to a point where l two s are interoperable enough and are, I guess I don't like the term eth aligned because I feel like it's not, like, it's not quantitative enough.
00:42:43.502 - 00:42:45.646, Speaker B: I hate that. I hate any align term.
00:42:45.718 - 00:42:46.750, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:42:46.870 - 00:43:01.366, Speaker B: Like, you know, it reminds me of, I said this, it reminds me of like an EOS back in the day. They had these like, block producers and other block producers promised that they went bribe because they, they're all eos aligned. Like, oh, we promise we won't bribe. We won't bribe. Went live literally a week later. Everyone's like, bribing for the top 21 spots.
00:43:01.438 - 00:43:01.710, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:01.750 - 00:43:08.942, Speaker B: Like a line, like alignment and dog dogma. Like, this doesn't work. Yeah, you need to have it, like, enforced by, like, the code to me.
00:43:08.966 - 00:44:08.098, Speaker A: What it reminds me of is like when, like when you work for like a company with like hundreds of thousands or like millions of employees and like, they tell you your family, as if like the system, like, cares about you. Like, it's, it's like, that's not what, like, like, I, I think Ethereum is one of the greatest things ever, like, created. But I'm not going to sit here and like build something that is like spiritually. Like I'm talking, I'm talking stuff that like meaningfully brings value back to the chain or to the asset. That is, like, I'd like to think we converge on that with when we have actual tokenization that matters. Like, you can, your employer, your employer like pays you by giving you an NFT which they can burn at any time in the form of firing you. And that like, that gives you your set, it like air drops your salary every month, which you can take out future loans against your like next 24, whatever, whatever, you know, all the, all the like crazy shit that people like to talk about.
00:44:08.194 - 00:44:11.586, Speaker D: Points for salary, paid in points, whatever.
00:44:11.618 - 00:44:14.962, Speaker C: It might be, payday loans on chain.
00:44:15.146 - 00:44:20.060, Speaker B: It's like company money getting paid in, like, company bills being paid in points.
00:44:20.960 - 00:44:49.420, Speaker A: I do think that not all of, like, I don't think that. I do think that the future is multi chain. Like, I don't think that there's going to be one base layer. Like, ETh obviously has a great institutional tokenization narrative, but I don't. And I know, like everybody hates, I mean, I personally hate talking about meme coining these days. Um, but whether we like it or not, I think it's here to stay. And I don't think that that continues to happen on Eth.
00:44:49.420 - 00:45:36.828, Speaker A: Um, and I think that that's, that, like, I don't think that we're going to be using the word meme coining or shitcoining or whatever forever. I think that Solana or some performance chain, it's hard to say whether like the move chains are going to play a role in that at some point. If so, it's, I don't think it's going to be until next cycle. But I think that that type of like super performant, like almost like Zoomer chain is like the perfect place. Yeah, it's the perfect place for like all of the, it's like, you know, it's like the tick tock of, of blockchains. It's like the, it's, it's where all of like the nonsensical, super degenerative, like, you know, people are going to people are going to use Solana. Twelve year olds are going to use Solana when they go to like buy an ice cream from the ice cream truck.
00:45:36.828 - 00:46:05.658, Speaker A: And they need to micro finance it because they didn't get enough. Like they didn't get enough. Yeah, they didn't get enough allowance from their parents. So they'll micro finance the next 24 months to buy this ice cream cone. Like I legitimately, okay, obviously not that extreme, but I legitimately think that like intense, like rampant micro financialization is gonna be a thing in the future. And I think that that's gonna happen on a very performant blockchain. And I, I have proof too.
00:46:05.658 - 00:46:37.740, Speaker A: Because if you go anywhere in Colombia, Paraguay, or like some places in Brazil as well, you can pay for $20 worth of groceries. And the first thing they ask you is how many quotes do you want to finance it across? You can do like six to twelve quotes for buying a fucking frozen pizza, dude. And obviously these countries are a lot more affected by inflation than we are. But like, I mean, we all know how like the story ends.
00:46:38.120 - 00:46:46.488, Speaker C: And in Brazil they have quotes mean installments. Just so what's that? What does quotes mean? It's that like installment.
00:46:46.584 - 00:46:46.928, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:46.984 - 00:46:47.368, Speaker C: Or.
00:46:47.464 - 00:46:53.424, Speaker A: Yeah. Over x amount of months and you pay some absurd level of interest on it.
00:46:53.552 - 00:46:58.224, Speaker B: I didn't, I didn't realize that. So like $20 groceries turn to $40 groceries.
00:46:58.352 - 00:47:01.140, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's ridiculous.
00:47:02.240 - 00:47:11.352, Speaker B: I know in Brazil they have picks and like you can literally use USDT on tron on Brazil picks without Internet connection. It's crazy.
00:47:11.456 - 00:47:13.080, Speaker A: That's crazy. Damn.
00:47:13.160 - 00:47:24.470, Speaker B: Yeah, so actually it's like quite the advanced, like central bank. Like they're really at the cutting edge of all that stuff. I believe they like cryptographically sign their mints.
00:47:24.640 - 00:47:52.990, Speaker A: That's sick. Damn. I didn't know about any of that. Actually. I'm gonna make it out there some, but that's like, that's just like one example of like something, some use case specific thing that I think won't exist on ETH. In the same way that I don't think trading memes, trading culture, like probably even like predictions markets, maybe even like perp Dexs and like other types of high frequency trading avenues, I don't think that that necessarily needs to happen on ETH. I don't think that that's the best place for it to happen either.
00:47:52.990 - 00:48:07.632, Speaker A: Yeah, Cedaw is a, I think Cedo's a little bit ethed out. He's breathe.
00:48:07.696 - 00:48:11.528, Speaker C: Let's switch topics. Let's switch topics. Last quarter here.
00:48:11.624 - 00:48:27.270, Speaker D: If you guys used the ETh chain or any of its l two s, do you use them consistently? What do you do on these, on these chains? What do you maybe theoretically do in other countries if need be?
00:48:29.370 - 00:48:55.000, Speaker B: I like, honestly, I like playing around with novel applications and dapps. Like, that's what I'm, like, hungry and looking for. I can only use like, the same forks insert here so many times, like when friendsec came out, yeah, you can give it shit now, but when it came out, it was like something novel and like, cool. And I'll like, oh, I'll try that out. Like, that was cool. Even though, like, yeah, we saw how it ended up. That's why it's all experiments.
00:48:55.000 - 00:49:56.092, Speaker B: Another one I liked was like baseline on blast. I really, I thought, like, what they were, like, trying to do was really cool. I actually ended up, like, having them on the pod and, you know, just like having rethinking, like, you know, the beginnings of liquidity for like tokens and their token launches and everything. I like they're trying to crack a hard problem and I'm like, oh, like, I'll like, go try this out that, and like, honestly, I'm kind of like, you don't have to, like, try everything. You just have to, like, try the things that, like, I kind of just get like, intuition on things and I haven't really gotten around too much to cycle, like, but yeah, meme coins here and there, but I'm also just like waiting for bear train to come out. And like, I'm biased obviously, because I love those guys, but like, I feel like all the defined mind share or like most of it at least, has just like, moved over to bearishing and like, you, I mean, I've been to their events and I like, see like the projects that are cooking on there, it's like they're really cultivating like a very deep, novel defi ecosystem. And so I'm like, excited for barachain to come out.
00:49:56.092 - 00:50:04.228, Speaker B: I think that's when I'll like, you know, kind of like other kind of be out of my DCA mode and like try some new things, but I just search for novelty. That's it.
00:50:04.404 - 00:50:34.448, Speaker A: I think I have, I think I probably have the most utilitarian use case here. I use, I use, I use base and arbitrum to pay for my rent and my, like, cost of living. So every, every week, every two weeks, I, I shoot a guy a text. I tell him how much I want. I send that money to his address in either arbitrum or base, USDT. USDC, whatever. Really? He's, he's a flexible guy.
00:50:34.448 - 00:50:45.140, Speaker A: Nice guy. A little bit suspicious, but nice guy. And then he pulls up with about two of these stacks. These are, these are, this is, this is about $150.
00:50:46.680 - 00:50:47.232, Speaker C: No?
00:50:47.336 - 00:50:48.592, Speaker A: Yeah, this is.
00:50:48.696 - 00:50:50.160, Speaker D: That's $150.
00:50:50.240 - 00:50:50.648, Speaker B: Damn.
00:50:50.704 - 00:51:00.256, Speaker A: Well, okay, one of these. One of these is like, probably like seventy cents. Sixty. Seventy cents. So, I mean, like, jeez. Yeah.
00:51:00.408 - 00:51:01.568, Speaker C: How much are groceries?
00:51:01.664 - 00:51:15.912, Speaker A: Groceries are not that expensive for content. Like, I eat out a lot, but, like, I'll get, like, fruit. Like, I don't know, two, three times a week. It runs me, like, make sense. I don't know, five, $6 for a couple pounds of fruit. It's not a lot. It's.
00:51:15.912 - 00:51:22.120, Speaker A: It's not a lot of, like, it's a low cost of living, definitely, but use cases. Like, use case.
00:51:22.160 - 00:51:26.264, Speaker B: I wish I could pay my rent and die. I get paid. I want to pay my rent.
00:51:26.352 - 00:51:45.592, Speaker A: It's very nice, honestly. Is it, like, is it like the breakthrough crypto use case I hope for? Not really, because I'm pretty sure I'm just sending it to a. So, like, you know, like, who's really winning here? But it's. But it's utility, you know, I like to think it's. It's like a step in the right direction.
00:51:45.656 - 00:51:50.140, Speaker D: Yeah. I paid my sublet recently using USCC on Soldo.
00:51:51.400 - 00:51:56.216, Speaker B: Oh, I've done that. I've done. I paid sublets with, like, USCC on Eth.
00:51:56.408 - 00:52:17.642, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, for me, I kind of bucket it into, like, three things. Like, one, farming. Obviously, you got to put your capital to work. And whenever Dave brings on both yield farming, airdrop, industrialized farm. I just don't want to play those game. Right. I just want to know what I'm going to get and just.
00:52:17.642 - 00:52:38.630, Speaker C: I'm happy to sign up for that full stop. The second thing is, since Dave finds projects so early on in their life, like, usually he's in test debt mode or just like, they had just launched. Like, that's my motivation, to go and use the product before kind of having them on the pod and so that we can talk about it intelligently. So that's like, my way of being still in the trenches, per se.
00:52:38.670 - 00:52:40.822, Speaker B: I feel like we're sorry I cut you off.
00:52:40.926 - 00:53:03.000, Speaker C: And the third point is just actually using it for, say, like, you know, big purchases. So, you know, for me, I'm a huge watch guy and I recently became a father, so I was like, hey, I got to get a birth watch. You know, I'm saying, thank you. Thank you, brother. Thank you. So I got to get a birth watch. I was like, so I start shopping around and then, you know, one thing led to another and then I decide to make the purchase.
00:53:03.000 - 00:53:26.870, Speaker C: And obviously I had to use stable coins for that. And surprisingly stable coins on Tron. USDT on TRC is the way. And actually, surprisingly enough, I am also really good friends with my watch dealers and they're huge in the. The space. And everybody there no longer uses swift. Everybody just use Tron USDT.
00:53:26.870 - 00:53:57.952, Speaker C: Like, believe it or not, like, stable coin activity happens on Tron. Like, if you want to see actual utility usage of the stable coin itself, it happens on Tron. And you know, Ali, like, like your, you know, sus but nice guy. These watch dealers, they have a side business and all they do is like taking USDT charge like one or one and a half percent and then swap it into cash for you. Right? And that's their business. Or you want. If you have cash and you want to go into USDT, they take one and a half percent coming in the other way.
00:53:57.952 - 00:54:04.528, Speaker C: So it's like, it's crazy. It's crazy. The amount of utility that is happening.
00:54:04.584 - 00:54:04.984, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:05.072 - 00:54:06.392, Speaker C: Lucrative business no one talks about.
00:54:06.456 - 00:54:07.512, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure.
00:54:07.616 - 00:54:20.134, Speaker D: Watch super dealer and crypto person overlap is always so surprising. I always, I always hear about watch dealers that are really. That are into crypto or, like, people.
00:54:20.182 - 00:54:20.854, Speaker A: Like, it makes sense.
00:54:20.902 - 00:54:26.694, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think they're into it because their clientele is into it. So they just naturally, I think it's.
00:54:26.702 - 00:54:32.766, Speaker B: Just like, a really autistic thing to be into is watches because it's like really mechanical and shit. That's why, like, yeah, that's actually funny.
00:54:32.798 - 00:54:35.530, Speaker D: Ollie love. I think Ollie's a big watch guy.
00:54:36.030 - 00:54:38.450, Speaker A: I was gonna ask what kind of watch did you get?
00:54:39.430 - 00:54:47.830, Speaker C: I. Oh, I really. I took a lot of time to think about this one, but I'll tell you offline. I'll tell you offline. It's pretty.
00:54:47.910 - 00:54:51.894, Speaker A: We'll make a separate, separate watch podcast and we'll start there.
00:54:52.062 - 00:54:54.850, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch liquidity.
00:54:55.230 - 00:55:26.024, Speaker B: I was gonna say the amount of guests we've had on, or, like, there's been quite a few words. Like, I find them early and then they go, like, do very well and they just blow up. Like, I remember earlier it was like f of x. They were like $15. And then they went up to, like, a think, like, probably my most notable one recently was pump fun. The first one to interview Alon back in like March or April when like, God knows what was on pump dot fun. And now, like, there's Bloomberg articles about it and shit.
00:55:26.024 - 00:55:35.304, Speaker B: So it's just like, I don't know. I enjoy being in the trenches. I like, some people try, like, oh, I'm gonna get. Make it out the trenches. Like, no, I have my tent here in the trenches. I'm fucking saying.
00:55:35.432 - 00:55:36.840, Speaker D: Yeah, shout out to a lot.
00:55:36.880 - 00:55:37.480, Speaker A: Yeah, for real.
00:55:37.560 - 00:55:40.420, Speaker D: That guy was awesome. That guy's a hustler. Shout out to that guy.
00:55:40.970 - 00:55:42.870, Speaker B: Yeah, dude.
00:55:44.650 - 00:55:49.074, Speaker D: I was in DM's with him around then at that time. I think he was doing something before pumped up, dude.
00:55:49.122 - 00:55:59.750, Speaker B: Yeah, he was DM. Everybody. He was dming every. Everybody. Like, literally think about all the people that faded. Yeah. And, like, now it's like, yeah.
00:56:07.100 - 00:56:08.280, Speaker D: Shout out to him.
00:56:11.060 - 00:56:11.940, Speaker C: Okay.
00:56:12.100 - 00:56:23.200, Speaker D: And then in terms of, like, the last. The last transaction that you guys have made, the last app you've interacted with, what chain? What app? Maybe it was today. Maybe it was yesterday.
00:56:25.500 - 00:56:39.808, Speaker C: Was two days ago. Main chain ao farm. Because everybody was leaving because of the price action. And I was like, oh, now it's my time to, like, increase my stake. You know, I can catch it more.
00:56:39.984 - 00:56:50.660, Speaker D: I'll start with my. I mean, like, I think we can filter out meme coin buys. I don't think that's. I mean, if I filter out meme coin buys, is there anything else I'm doing?
00:56:52.800 - 00:56:54.100, Speaker B: I don't want to see the meme.
00:56:56.560 - 00:56:58.220, Speaker A: You don't want to incriminate yourself.
00:56:58.360 - 00:56:58.924, Speaker C: Uh.
00:56:59.012 - 00:57:06.280, Speaker D: Oh, no. I mean, a perfect hyper liquid. Maybe in another country. Okay.
00:57:07.980 - 00:57:10.796, Speaker C: Test net. Test net hyper liquid. Right, yeah. Got you.
00:57:10.868 - 00:57:15.412, Speaker A: I've used, now that I think about. I've used a lot of shit in the past week. I've used polymarket.
00:57:15.556 - 00:57:16.364, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:57:16.532 - 00:57:38.376, Speaker A: I've, like, messed, I've, like, messed around with lp ing on Meteora, on Solana. Did, like, a couple airdrop claims on there. Pendle symbiotic. And then just like some, I mean, dexs spot Dexs on eth as well. Just buying the dip. Hyper liquid as well. It's like, the only perp Dex I use.
00:57:38.376 - 00:57:41.820, Speaker A: Only perk. Only perp Dex anyone uses at this point. Really?
00:57:43.400 - 00:57:44.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:44.640 - 00:57:46.780, Speaker A: I'm still pretty active on channel. I don't know.
00:57:47.800 - 00:58:04.578, Speaker B: Yeah. Other than bonkbots, I'm trying to think. I've honestly just been like. It's been. I gotta think. I was like, what did I last do? I bought some. I bought some crv on, like the.
00:58:04.578 - 00:58:05.434, Speaker B: On the damn.
00:58:05.482 - 00:58:06.070, Speaker A: Why?
00:58:07.290 - 00:58:11.354, Speaker B: Because I like pain. I like pain.
00:58:11.402 - 00:58:13.562, Speaker C: Questioning your life choices bro, are the.
00:58:13.586 - 00:58:15.110, Speaker D: Curve words still happening?
00:58:16.460 - 00:58:43.230, Speaker B: No, I cuz, like, not financial advice, but, like, I interviewed Michael from curve, like, fireside chat, and, like, I did research before, and I'm like, wow. Like, the state, like, the stable coins, like, actually quite profitable. Like, like, it's actually. The stable coin is, like, carrying the revenue of, like, the. It's more profitable than the, like, the Dex. And, like, the protocol is, like, running fine, and, like, it's actually running not just fine, but, like, very well. And I'm just like, okay.
00:58:43.230 - 00:59:00.110, Speaker B: Like, he just got liquidated. Like, come on. Like, all the sellers must be gone now. No, no, all the sellers. But, like, it's one of, like, it's like, the underlying. It's like the, like, where, like, price is determined of stable coins. Like, people, like, look to curve.
00:59:00.110 - 00:59:05.454, Speaker B: They don't look anywhere else but to curve to, like, figure out if something's deep hex or not, so.
00:59:05.582 - 00:59:12.284, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, but my brother, my brother, we know this. There have been hundreds of thousands of CRB being emitted per day.
00:59:12.332 - 00:59:14.532, Speaker B: It's about to get cut. It's about to get cut.
00:59:14.596 - 00:59:20.124, Speaker C: It is. It is August 15. I think it's, like, next week. Yeah, it's about August 20.
00:59:20.172 - 00:59:20.468, Speaker B: All right.
00:59:20.524 - 00:59:22.708, Speaker C: Yeah, I just like pain.
00:59:22.764 - 00:59:24.760, Speaker A: Oh, my God. This chart is horrific.
00:59:27.140 - 00:59:31.084, Speaker C: It's criminal. Yeah, it's criminal.
00:59:31.212 - 00:59:33.652, Speaker D: And I guess we're.
00:59:33.796 - 00:59:37.596, Speaker A: We got to do, we got to do calls of the calls of the week.
00:59:37.628 - 00:59:55.650, Speaker D: I was going to wrap it up and, and something else. More of a, you know, not exactly calls, but maybe, you know, things you're excited about that you haven't, maybe haven't already mentioned or work or work with.
00:59:58.350 - 01:00:00.350, Speaker B: You know. I'm excited. I'm excited for Eth Bushman.
01:00:00.390 - 01:00:00.998, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
01:00:01.134 - 01:00:07.212, Speaker B: Six inside. Six inside. More info soon. Bushwick.
01:00:07.236 - 01:00:09.372, Speaker D: Do you have a month? Have you picked out a month?
01:00:09.436 - 01:00:09.892, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:09.996 - 01:00:11.068, Speaker D: No, no, no.
01:00:11.124 - 01:00:12.740, Speaker B: Figure it out. I got it.
01:00:12.860 - 01:00:16.132, Speaker A: Where the. Where the Bushwick is. I'm like Illinois or something.
01:00:16.196 - 01:00:19.596, Speaker B: No, no, dude, it's in Brooklyn, New York.
01:00:19.708 - 01:00:23.668, Speaker A: Yeah, it just sounds like a, like a midwest, like central.
01:00:23.804 - 01:00:28.880, Speaker B: I mean, it's Dutch. It's originally a dutch name, like most New York things, but, yeah.
01:00:32.190 - 01:00:39.502, Speaker C: For me, uh, what I'm excited for, um, I don't think you guys have. Have heard this from me yet, but I really think, um, ao being built on our.
01:00:39.526 - 01:00:40.494, Speaker B: We. I haven't heard.
01:00:40.542 - 01:00:56.326, Speaker C: Interesting thing. I'm not sure you guys have heard that from me, but I think I highly recommend everybody to look at it, but look at it from the tech side and go dive into the docs and like, you know, make sure you have chat GPT open as you're reading it, so you can ask it like an AI computer science question.
01:00:56.398 - 01:00:57.290, Speaker D: Say the thing.
01:00:59.680 - 01:01:25.860, Speaker C: It'S possible you can run it. The whole point is that you can run as kind of large arbitrary size as you want because of the arweave underlying. But the point is that the way they architected the whole blockchain, I'm not going to get into it here, but all I can say is go into the docs, watch the videos and literally have chat GPT open and ask it computer science questions. You got to ask the computer science questions for you to appreciate how this design is. Yeah, that's my last.
01:01:26.680 - 01:01:28.900, Speaker B: I love how you did this. And it just went down.
01:01:31.400 - 01:01:32.360, Speaker C: I tell you.
01:01:32.480 - 01:01:35.060, Speaker B: Remember, lesson in there.
01:01:38.600 - 01:01:40.128, Speaker A: All right, this is, this is also.
01:01:40.184 - 01:01:49.736, Speaker D: You can, like sometimes on these shoot the shit episodes, we do, we do calls cause of the week. I mean, you can, you can pick a time frame, maybe a month or a few months.
01:01:49.768 - 01:01:54.352, Speaker A: Yeah, but I'm not gonna, I don't want to show my bags. I wouldn't. Yeah, wouldn't sink that low.
01:01:54.416 - 01:01:56.020, Speaker D: Yeah, but.
01:01:58.880 - 01:01:59.900, Speaker C: I'm just kidding.
01:02:02.040 - 01:02:08.208, Speaker B: Every time kids said Aox, man, I'm.
01:02:08.224 - 01:02:09.152, Speaker C: Trying to get people to read the doc.
01:02:09.176 - 01:02:19.240, Speaker A: I got a good one, actually. Yeah, we just had a call with them today, opnet. Oh yeah, bitcoin meta protocol. See, this is actually just made announcement.
01:02:19.280 - 01:02:24.430, Speaker D: Like this is bear. Yeah, this is not another bear situation for ETh.
01:02:25.330 - 01:03:10.730, Speaker A: They actually made an announcement, like during this podcast or an announcement of an announcement when they're going to be dropping like the light paper and testnet and all this fun stuff. Basically my understanding of it is that all of the dog shit we saw in bitcoin up until now, like runes, ordinals, BRC's, those are like, they're like first generation bitcoin metaprotocol. So the first, like one of the. Not the first, but one of the first instances where you could do something more than just transfer tokens. And in this case it was like inscribed data mint collections, transfer those tokens, stuff like that. None of the Dex functionality actually works, even though it might seem like it does. Like when you go and use an ordinals Dex, that's like a centralized process.
01:03:10.730 - 01:03:53.942, Speaker A: But obviously all that stuff sucks. It's basically OTC trading, but worse because there's block times. Opnet is like essentially a step further than that, to the point where you can have actual smart contracts and you can wrap bitcoin and create actual amms and defi and all this other fun stuff on bitcoin. And it's too long to get into why that is special and different from all of the other l two stuff. But I can tell you that of all the other bitcoin infrastructure I've looked into, very few of it is actually, like, legit or actually seems legit at this stage. Opnet is one of them. I think so, yeah.
01:03:53.966 - 01:04:13.870, Speaker D: I mean, I'll summarize with some of the cool points that he told us. And, I mean, now we just. Now I think they're probably going to clip this. Now we're going to be like, just the shills of Opnet now. But, like, I don't even know if there's an adjacent token. I think there's an adjacent token. Don't fucking buy the adjacent token.
01:04:14.370 - 01:04:15.910, Speaker B: It would be very BTC.
01:04:16.250 - 01:04:47.552, Speaker D: I don't think Opna will have it. I'm pretty sure he said there's no token, so. But I summarized it pretty well. Apparently, these dudes are like, x. I don't think they worked for Ohm or the Olympus. I don't think they're directly from that crew, but they're apparently, like, in those trenches, bear chain trenches, like, from that kind of community. Just very ETH defi dudes that decided to build some, like, just uniswap on bitcoin.
01:04:47.552 - 01:05:16.940, Speaker D: It's like what their goal has set out to be. And the one thing that hooked me as the resident, like, not reading the white paper person is the fucking branding is hilarious. The website plays music. It looks sick. Like the videos where they're depicting a demo walkthrough, they're putting just schizo music behind. It's really. I think they're like.
01:05:16.940 - 01:05:50.950, Speaker D: It's almost like the one of us meme. They just really seem like the ETH boys just decided to make some kind of bitcoin infrastructure. Who knows if it's gonna. Who knows if it's gonna work? But, yeah, that was, that was pretty exciting. I'm excited to see what those guys can cook up. Other than that, let me pick something semi original. Damn, I forgot anything that was valuable.
01:05:50.950 - 01:05:56.144, Speaker D: I mean, I'm excited. I'm excited about some of my meme coin bags.
01:05:56.322 - 01:06:00.292, Speaker A: Um, I think talking about or recently, right?
01:06:00.396 - 01:06:02.268, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, dude, I don't know if.
01:06:02.284 - 01:06:02.932, Speaker A: You dig on that.
01:06:02.996 - 01:06:03.932, Speaker D: I don't want to.
01:06:04.076 - 01:06:07.924, Speaker A: That bags down like 50% or.
01:06:07.972 - 01:06:08.580, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll say.
01:06:08.620 - 01:06:08.820, Speaker B: Or.
01:06:08.860 - 01:06:27.370, Speaker D: I'm like that whole, I mean, that whole, like, fucking, I mean, shout out to Cal. Like, he he's the one who fucking messaged me about that. But that. That it's. I couldn't even explain it. Apparently they're trying to do, like, bitcoin mining on Solana.
01:06:27.870 - 01:06:29.110, Speaker B: Oh, I read that. Yeah.
01:06:29.150 - 01:06:31.278, Speaker D: It's been down only from here for me.
01:06:31.454 - 01:06:37.090, Speaker B: But you know that when I. We know, it reminded me of. Remember grin?
01:06:37.550 - 01:06:38.270, Speaker D: No.
01:06:38.430 - 01:06:39.890, Speaker B: Do you guys remember grin?
01:06:40.190 - 01:06:40.930, Speaker A: No.
01:06:41.230 - 01:06:41.798, Speaker C: I do.
01:06:41.854 - 01:06:55.438, Speaker B: This is like. This is like the shit coin that, like, the BTC Maxis, like, first loved because it was like. It was like. I don't. What was. It was like anonymous mining. It was like the closest you could get to decentralized.
01:06:55.438 - 01:07:15.940, Speaker B: And it was like. It passed, like the litmus test for BTC Maxis where you had, like, Jameson Lopp tweet running grant in 2018. It was like shitcoin lite for BTC Maxis. And it was just down, only it was just literally inflation at, like, through the roof. And look it up. Look, this is some history for your everyone. Uh, grin, mimble.
01:07:15.940 - 01:07:17.360, Speaker B: Wimble. That was it.
01:07:18.260 - 01:07:20.108, Speaker A: Comforting as. As an or holder.
01:07:20.204 - 01:07:26.120, Speaker B: Yeah. It's how, you know, I've been around too long because I know very nimble. Wimble is.
01:07:28.420 - 01:07:28.924, Speaker A: Damn.
01:07:28.972 - 01:07:30.188, Speaker D: Um, that's pretty cool.
01:07:30.284 - 01:07:31.440, Speaker C: Uh, cool.
01:07:31.820 - 01:07:36.956, Speaker A: Yeah, we're, uh, we're about a time here over time here. Cedar, you got anything else you want to wrap up here?
01:07:37.028 - 01:07:44.894, Speaker D: Uh, no, I think that's it. I think that's it. Yeah, this is fun.
01:07:44.942 - 01:07:45.494, Speaker A: All right.
01:07:45.622 - 01:07:46.574, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been a good one.
01:07:46.622 - 01:07:49.694, Speaker A: Yeah, this was fun. Nice little yap session late at night. Always.
01:07:49.742 - 01:07:51.046, Speaker B: Thanks for letting me yap.
01:07:51.198 - 01:08:01.422, Speaker A: Absolutely. Thanks. Thank. Thank you for yapping. And obviously, you know, throwing the mic back to us as well. That's always fun stuff to switch it up. Yeah, this was great.
01:08:01.422 - 01:08:10.298, Speaker A: Thanks again, guys. This was episode 884, exiliquidity Flywheel. And we will see you guys next week.
01:08:10.434 - 01:08:11.150, Speaker D: Peace.
