00:00:00.360 - 00:00:03.302, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how.
00:00:03.366 - 00:00:06.890, Speaker B: Not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:07.790 - 00:00:18.570, Speaker C: We actually appreciate, like, I actually saw, you were, like, the first person, I told you this. You were the first person, like, in our comments about it. How did you even, like, come across the video? Was it through Twitter or, like, YouTube?
00:00:19.110 - 00:00:44.560, Speaker B: I think I just stumbled upon. I can't remember which one of you tweeted about it. I don't even know how because I didn't even follow any of you at the time either. It just came on my feed. And, you know, I'm always excited about seeing, like, people coming into the space, creating content, especially us people who are, you know, brown people, etcetera. So it got me excited just seeing, like, more brown creators in the space. Let's go.
00:00:44.560 - 00:01:02.180, Speaker B: So, yeah, I clicked on it. And you know what? To be honest, one thing that I really like is, especially when I see content creators who are small or just starting out, I always think that they've always got something nice to share or something new to share, new opinion. So I thought I'd check it out, and straight away, like, within a couple of minutes of watching, I was hooked.
00:01:02.760 - 00:01:12.740, Speaker C: Nice. We appreciate that. We really appreciate that. How'd you get started with, like, crypto, and how do you decide to, like, make the content and stuff?
00:01:13.360 - 00:01:51.472, Speaker B: So when I was in medical school, I think I just started reading about finance, personal finance, investing, all that sort of stuff. I think in medicine, people are so focused on, like, the science y stuff and trying to get published and, you know, focus on their careers and whatnot. But they don't really focus too much on the money side of things that come with a career in healthcare. And just when I was in medical school, just reading, and I used to read a lot of books back then, so just built upon it back then. And I think sometime in medical school, I just stumbled upon crypto. And then after that, I just, the more I learned, the more I was interested. Just kind of, you know, grew from there.
00:01:51.472 - 00:01:53.592, Speaker B: Really nice.
00:01:53.656 - 00:01:58.648, Speaker C: Have you made other content or. We're off on the timing here.
00:01:58.704 - 00:02:02.300, Speaker A: Go ahead. There's a delay, I'm telling you. You go ahead.
00:02:03.600 - 00:02:41.676, Speaker B: Yes. In terms of creating content, I did. I actually used to make, and some of these videos are on my channel, but they're unlisted, so you can't see them anymore. But at the start, I used to make videos about how to get into medical school, studying strategies, you know, how I learn stuff, you know, how to get good grades in school, that sort of business a day in the life of me in medical school, I used to do vlogs and things like that, which sounds so bizarre if you look at my channel now. But that's basically how I got into the whole content creation side of things. And then I think eventually I just came a point where I was like, I'm going to medical school and I'm coming back and making more videos about medical school. It's just too much.
00:02:41.676 - 00:02:50.060, Speaker B: Maybe I should make something else that I'm interested in. By the time I was super interested in crypto, so I thought, you know, let's make videos about that.
00:02:50.560 - 00:02:54.420, Speaker C: Nice. Cool cat. I'm gonna give you a few seconds.
00:02:54.800 - 00:03:10.542, Speaker A: Appreciate that. Yeah, because you're, I'm curious about, like, the med school thing. Your bias says you're a part time doctor. Like, what does that mean? Like how, if you don't mind, curious to hear. Because I don't know. Yeah, like something so distinct. IRL.
00:03:10.542 - 00:03:11.474, Speaker A: Crypto at least.
00:03:11.522 - 00:03:39.110, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm not actually a part time doctor, I'm actually a full time doctor. I just want to go part time so I can handle crypto. But yeah, I say part time doctor because I do crypto so much that it almost feels like medicine is my part time thing. But actually, I'm actually still working full time. I graduated medical school like two years ago. So I've been working in the UK healthcare system, which is called the NHS, for a couple of years now.
00:03:40.250 - 00:03:42.938, Speaker A: Damn. Damn. Dude's a doctor.
00:03:42.994 - 00:03:58.050, Speaker C: So how do you like start and, yeah, where do you start out as like a. How did it come across? Like, how was the seed planted? Was it like Ethereum, Maxi? Was it, did you catch like some meme coin? Was it Solano?
00:03:58.170 - 00:04:44.618, Speaker B: No, it wasn't anything like that. I think it started off with just kind of learning the complete fundamentals, really. So before I even bought any sort of altcoin or anything like that, I made sure that I had a really good understanding of the pure fundamentals that come with crypto. Like, what is a blockchain? What is proof of work? What is proof of stake? Trying to just really get my head around all of that sort of stuff. And I think from a complete beginner who's got no exposure, some of that stuff can take a while to really get your head around and appreciate. And I think at the time as well, I was just trying to really get my head around the point of bitcoin and things like that. This is quite a few years ago now whilst I was in medical school, and so my first actual exposure with crypto probably would have been something on coinbase or binance.
00:04:44.618 - 00:05:17.368, Speaker B: But very quickly, I think it was about learning about the stuff on chain. And I think probably my first defi experience would probably be something like Uniswap or very quickly after that pancake swap when that kind of came out. So, you know, the kind of coins that come on Pancakeswap. Yeah, I think I just got. I just really enjoyed the whole unchained experience. So I, as soon as things started developing on chain, I was ready for that. Really nice.
00:05:17.424 - 00:05:22.540, Speaker C: And what was, like, what were some of the first threads that you decided to write about?
00:05:23.440 - 00:05:51.448, Speaker B: The first threads would have been probably a couple of years ago. I probably wrote about, maybe I wrote about Ust or Luna anchor protocol, something like that, which is kind of some of the content that I made, you know, quite a while back now. I did. I read some threads about nfts back then as well. But looking back at them, they were really poor. And it's good to see kind of how my writings kind of changed over time as well.
00:05:51.584 - 00:06:03.340, Speaker C: Nice. And at like, a very high level, like, where do you see your end goal being with, like, the threads and your writing?
00:06:03.690 - 00:06:46.390, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you see, I'm at a very difficult point right now where, you know, I love crypto, and I kind of really want to work in crypto. I have do have. I do work in crypto at the moment, but it's not really a full time role. And so my end goal really is to find some sort of balance between, you know, my IRL stuff with working as a doctor, but also, you know, having some sort of solid income that I can basically live off from doing the stuff that I enjoy, which is creating content, whether that's video form, written content, or just kind of giving value. And I think really this is something that I probably just developed over the years that I really like teaching. I've always been a teacher. I used to teach younger students maths and English, maths and chemistry.
00:06:46.390 - 00:07:07.170, Speaker B: Sorry. And then kind of after that, just kind of teaching people about what medical school is like, but then kind of teaching people what crypto is and, you know, how crypto works and some of the things that you can do in defi and that sort of stuff. So all of it comes from my passion for education. So if I can. Basically, my end goal really is to just kind of create an income from that.
00:07:08.830 - 00:07:44.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. I think that's, like, pretty important, and it's a good way to, like, take you from one level to the next. I feel like, I feel like me and Ali are working somewhat in the same direction of just, like, using the knowledge we have and, like, trying to not monetize it specifically, but because we also believe, at least for me, I believe, like, most of the knowledge should be, like, free. It shouldn't be like, gate camp. Like, that's an ethos that comes from, like, crypto and how I learned about it, definitely. But making this a full time gig through that education would be awesome.
00:07:45.070 - 00:08:12.082, Speaker B: Yeah. I think one of the things that I think in life that, you know, I should do is whatever I'm doing, I should be doing it because it's providing value to people and I think I get an enormous amount of self satisfaction from providing value. And I think it just makes me enjoy life, enjoy work a lot more. So, you know, the things that I can do to provide value, whether that's educating Defi or crypto, whatever, if I could do that full time, it means work is fun.
00:08:12.266 - 00:08:49.205, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. And for not to get, like, down into the weeds of, like, crypto and stuff. How are you feeling, like, in general, about where. Actually, let's talk a little bit about. I feel like one of our first episodes and why we started this is because, like, me and Ali of, and I'm sure a lot of people have become exit liquidity for a lot of the Ponzi's that we've been involved in. And so I just want to touch on, like a few of the. Maybe the Ponzis that you've been involved in or maybe the times where you learned, like, a really tough lesson in this space.
00:08:49.317 - 00:09:31.840, Speaker B: I mean, there's one that really stands out a lot and it's the whole lunar ust fiasco. So, yeah, that's the biggest one for sure. I think I did pretty well in the last bull market, actually. But I made the big mistake of when selling the top, consolidating my holdings into UST. Yeah, I learned loads of lessons. I was too overexposed to the whole terra ecosystem at the time. I was so interested in everything that terra were doing, not only just because of the whole UST and anchor stuff, but a lot of the early content that I made was around the delta neutral strategy that you could do on mirror going long and short on stocks.
00:09:31.840 - 00:10:06.310, Speaker B: Some of the cool stuff on Mars with leveraged farming, they had self repaying loans as well on kinetic money. So there's loads of cool, really innovative defi stuff which is actually just coming back into play now. Actually, if you look at things like Pendle, it actually existed on terra. Like two years ago, but, yeah, that was the biggest lesson. I learned a lot from it in terms of not only just risk management, but also marrying your bags and not being emotionally attached and things like that and really just diversifying a little bit more.
00:10:06.810 - 00:10:17.930, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, we definitely fell for a lot of the whole Luna ecosystem. We both, like, wrote stuff about those, like, jumping into strategies and stuff that brought back a lot of flashbacks and PTSD.
00:10:18.010 - 00:10:26.670, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like one of my most viewed videos on YouTube as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I definitely learned a lot from that.
00:10:27.450 - 00:10:45.490, Speaker C: Yeah. Leading into, like, the. Where you're at now, how are you feeling about the space at like, a high level? Do you even, like, take into account macro how much analysis goes into how you're feeling today?
00:10:45.790 - 00:11:17.670, Speaker B: No, I try and do a bit of everything. I think ultimately I'm a fundamental investor and you could probably tell from deep dives and things that, like, and things that I do, but I do try and, like, pay attention to macro and a bit of technical analysis and things like that as well. But, you know, there's only so much really that I. That you can do before you really kind of have to come to a decision yourself. Making that decision yourself is probably the hardest thing, especially when there's so much noise around on Twitter or kind of everywhere. Everyone's got polarizing opinions. Some people think markets are going up, some people think markets going down.
00:11:17.670 - 00:11:37.660, Speaker B: There's so many. So much information. It's quite easy to get information overloaded. So for me, I keep it simple. I'm very bullish on everything related to crypto, particularly Defi. And I. I think as long as I feel that way, I'll continue to accumulate assets that I'm bullish on regardless of price.
00:11:38.440 - 00:12:32.382, Speaker C: Yeah, I think me and Ali, I think Ali can touch on this a bit more, but we've lost our, like, we were very much Defi boys, like, probably nine months ago, twelve months ago. And as, like, the NFT stuff started to pick up, we took a step back and, like, I feel like for me, my whole thesis changed on, like, because I've worked in like, a. For. I've done research for, like, a Defi protocol that came out and I don't know, I had, like, this awakening where I was like, I don't, like, how am I going to justify this investment on, like, a longer term perspective? Like, am I going to expect, like, normies to hold, like, curve tokens or like, ve curve tokens? Like, I don't know. My defi heart has left for a bit and I'm just. So what's your conviction? Where did your conviction come from?
00:12:32.406 - 00:13:03.860, Speaker B: There, I think, to be honest, I do appreciate the kind of sentiment around that because you're absolutely right. I don't expect normies to be holding curve either. But kind of all the value that curve creates and all the other kind of hundreds or thousands of applications, it all kind of roots through to Ethereum. And so ultimately, my thesis is really because I think Defi is going to do well. I think Ethereum will do well. And so the majority of my allocation is going to be towards things like Ethereum anyway.
00:13:05.000 - 00:14:01.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for me, what kind of happened was like, it feels like for so long, Defi was just like, so uninteresting. Like, there were improvements, obviously, but they weren't, like, marked and like, particularly, like, like, groundbreaking. So after a while, for me, I kind of just got, like, bored of sticking around for so long. And then, you know, kind of shifted focus for a while, actually, like a good, like half a year and then coming back and there's all this, like, there's all this cool stuff that's been being built for, you know, an entire half a year, an entire year. So, like, the space has completely been transformed and then I, there's all this new stuff to get into. So at this point, Defi is definitely way, way different from what it was like a year ago. But in my opinion, it definitely still has, like, it still has a long way to go.
00:14:01.674 - 00:14:16.940, Speaker A: What do you think about where it's headed right now? What do you think needs to happen to get more adoption, whatever that might mean for you, whether that's more capital, efficiency, or like, like normal people or just better products in the current state.
00:14:17.640 - 00:14:57.364, Speaker B: I think all of those things, like you said, are happening. You're absolutely right. Like, the state of DeFi now is so much different to what it was a year ago. But I think at the moment, and one of the reasons why I kind of feel this sentiment is because I have a group of friends from medical school, some of my fellow doctor friends and things like that, that really want to get into crypto and kind of want to understand and get involved with some of the stuff that I talk about in my videos, but for them, it seems so complicated and so difficult to even interact with some of this stuff. So really, I think the main thing is account abstraction. I think people really need an easier way to kind of on and off into crypto. Off ramp or on ramp.
00:14:57.364 - 00:15:50.350, Speaker B: They need, like, even the wallets that we have today are still not good enough for people like us, they might be easy to use, but for normies, like, if you put a metamask wallet or any other kind of wallet that you use in front of your parents, it's gonna be difficult. Like, it's gonna take them a while, you know? So I think maybe things like mobile will help, but I don't know, the workarounds of security and things like that there. But definitely account abstraction needs to be, like, one of the major things that really going to make the space 1010 or 100 times bigger than what it is right now. It needs to be way easier than what it is right now. Even some, literally, my friends might be some of the smartest people around. Yeah, these guys got straight a's in school and, you know, they can't figure out some basic defi stuff, really. Basically just highlights the fact that if they can't do it, then the majority of the rest of the world will find it difficult.
00:15:50.930 - 00:16:27.830, Speaker C: Have you tested out any of these, like, alternative wallets? Because me and Ollie have talked about this for a bit now, and there was that whole metamask thing that was happening with. Yeah, like, the past few weeks that people were freaked out about and. Yeah, it's just I still haven't found a reason to leave metamask. I mean, like, there's different projects that I think are going to do well, but I feel like it's just that, like, that fear, that security fear that, like, this is a new product. I'm not going to put my trust in it when I know Metamask so well, and I know it's going to work, and it's been working for so many people. Have you tested out, like, the wallet?
00:16:27.870 - 00:16:33.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I've tested out quite a few. I actually don't use metamask anymore. I use rabbi wallet.
00:16:34.430 - 00:16:34.934, Speaker C: Really?
00:16:35.022 - 00:16:56.710, Speaker B: Yeah, just, it's got a much cleaner interface. I know what I'm signing when I'm approaching transactions and stuff that really make it clear what I'm doing. When I'm doing a transaction, I know exactly what funds are going in and what funds are going out. I can see everything on all chains. On one page, you can see Rabbi r a B y.
00:16:57.570 - 00:17:00.750, Speaker A: Thought it was Braba, or am I thinking of something else?
00:17:01.450 - 00:17:02.710, Speaker B: No, it's rabbi.
00:17:03.450 - 00:17:04.146, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:04.258 - 00:17:05.630, Speaker C: I haven't heard much about it.
00:17:08.029 - 00:17:19.621, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of the great things is that you can actually import your metamask account directly into it, so you don't need a new seed phrase or anything like that. You can use the same one that you've got for your wallets at the moment, and I think it's been able.
00:17:19.645 - 00:17:21.501, Speaker C: To, like, sleep at night and everything with that.
00:17:21.605 - 00:17:25.529, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty good. It's actually been created by the people who made dbank.
00:17:26.349 - 00:17:27.277, Speaker C: Oh, okay.
00:17:27.373 - 00:17:40.720, Speaker B: Yeah, same team. So, yeah, I really like it. You've got like a. An in house approval system as well. So, you know, revoking approvals are very easy. You can do it directly on the wallet as well. So if you.
00:17:40.720 - 00:18:04.110, Speaker B: If you've, like, you know, approved, you know, some random contract or token or whatever, you can just revoke it within seconds. Directly on the app, though, it looks really nice. There's another wallet that I tried out called frame, which some of the big defi users are using, but I just preferred the experience of rabi, and ever since I moved over to Rabi, I've never even thought about using metamask again.
00:18:04.850 - 00:18:08.466, Speaker C: Dang. Damn, that's a big claim. I might have to try it out.
00:18:08.578 - 00:18:14.430, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely try it out. The experience is so much smoother than metamask, honestly.
00:18:15.650 - 00:18:16.298, Speaker C: Really?
00:18:16.434 - 00:18:24.530, Speaker B: Yeah. But I think small steps like this are going to make more people get into defi and kind of try things out, really. You know, metamask is poor, in my opinion.
00:18:24.690 - 00:18:32.040, Speaker C: Do you think you can hand something like Ravi to friends or family and they'll be able to use it, or is it still a little more advanced than that?
00:18:32.580 - 00:18:48.440, Speaker B: I think they will be able to use it, but, like, there's still this. I think it's still a while away before, like, let's say, my parents would be able to kind of use something like rabbi independently, but it's still miles better than metamask, I'll tell you that.
00:18:49.180 - 00:19:00.330, Speaker C: Interesting. Are they, like, doing anything out of the ordinary, like token dao governance? Because I know tally ho does a little bit of that.
00:19:00.870 - 00:19:15.410, Speaker B: No, there's no rabi token. There's nothing like that. It's just a nice wallet, nice user interface, lovely experience. You can see all your tokens in one place. You can revoke approvals they've got. Yeah, just try it out. Try it out.
00:19:15.410 - 00:19:20.930, Speaker B: I mean, worst case scenarios, you don't like it and you just delete it.
00:19:21.840 - 00:19:24.500, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, good point.
00:19:24.800 - 00:19:39.940, Speaker B: Yeah. That was my theory with testing out some of the different wallets. I tested out XDefi wallet, frame, rabi, Kepler, a few other wallets as well. And frame was the one that. Not frame rabi. Sorry, was the one that I enjoyed the most.
00:19:40.400 - 00:19:54.152, Speaker C: Nice. Have you made a video on that? Yeah, yeah. Cool, cool. I see you have some, like, video I know, you mentioned the video of you're going from, like, zero to six figures.
00:19:54.296 - 00:19:54.832, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:54.936 - 00:19:58.312, Speaker C: How's that been going? Yeah, so far you've been into.
00:19:58.456 - 00:20:33.246, Speaker B: So far, it's pretty good. I mean, it's a portfolio where I'm continuously adding money. So I think in the next episode, I probably need to clarify that because a few people have messaged me saying, I thought you were starting off with $500 and making it into 100k. Like, what's going on there? Why does your money keep going up? So it's basically just me just showcasing what I'm buying and me just kind of explaining my thesis behind it. I'm not asking anyone to copy me because most likely some of the things are going to go down and they are, in fact. But it's just a way for me to just also have some history where I can also go back in time and look. Oh, look.
00:20:33.246 - 00:20:57.838, Speaker B: Six months ago, these were my thoughts on this particular token. What's changed? It's a way for me, it's basically an online journal of what I'm thinking at any point in time in the market. It's a fun way to interact with other people, kind of get thoughts and things like that regarding what I'm doing. So I thought it was just a fun little thing to do. Let's see how it goes. If it goes to zero, I don't. It goes to zero.
00:20:57.934 - 00:21:01.890, Speaker C: You know, you just keep adding funds and it will never work.
00:21:02.910 - 00:21:09.490, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. But, you know, so far it's going pretty good. We're in the green by a fair amount, so we'll continue to add to it.
00:21:10.270 - 00:21:18.474, Speaker C: Is this, like, more of, like, a djen portfolio, or are you keeping it high level for, like, with all l ones and stuff, or.
00:21:18.642 - 00:21:47.672, Speaker B: I would say that it's somewhere in between. Like, it's definitely not just a top ten crypto holdings. It's like a wallet with bitcoin, Ethan matic or something like that. It got a variety, some kind of low market cap coins in as well. So it's somewhere in the middle, really. But really, it's just me just trying to rationalize some of the thoughts I have and some of the interesting things that I like and kind of. Yeah, that's it.
00:21:47.672 - 00:21:48.260, Speaker B: Really?
00:21:48.880 - 00:23:03.536, Speaker C: Yeah. For your high level thesis, what is your take on l one l two s? How that kind of plays out in the future, near term and long term? Because just to lay the land, me and Ali had an argument about this yesterday. You know, when the telegram arguments go from text messages to, like, voice memos, like that's where it started, because I had to, like, we had to get our points across to each other. But basically, I tweeted a bit about the Solana and Solana phone, basically saying, like, if, because Ali was talking about the UX is on Solana, and I just said, if you think the UX on Solana is so good, why don't you have a Solana phone? And, yes, that take, like, kind of is very broad and kind of throws away everything they've done and maybe wrong. But I think my sentiment for that was I just don't think Solana is good enough and that different or that, like, extraordinary for me to put my funds there. And I have a Solana PFP. I mean, like, my profile picture is a Solana NFT project.
00:23:03.536 - 00:23:08.660, Speaker C: So I do think there's something there, but it just hasn't been enough to me.
00:23:09.510 - 00:23:11.742, Speaker B: And what's Ali's thoughts?
00:23:11.886 - 00:23:13.810, Speaker C: Ali, you can take that.
00:23:14.870 - 00:24:02.026, Speaker A: I think that, like, most of that is valid, but I also think that for where they're at right now and, like, like, yes, they have good ux. I'm not gonna go buy a new fucking phone because I used a wallet that was better than metamask. Like, it's more so just the idea that I think that. But if we're going to have, like, if we're going to have on chain consumer facing apps one day, then right now Solana is better positioned for certain use cases than even L2 is. And, you know, things like layer three and even, like, properly optimized l two s are still a far way along. And I think that people have just given Solana too much shit for what it's actually. What it's actually, like, worth.
00:24:02.026 - 00:24:48.416, Speaker A: I think that, and I think this is also, like, I think me and cedo have pretty different feeds because what he sees is, like, people more bullish on and people, like, people thinking that a return to something close to what it once was is likely. Whereas, like, on my feet, I mostly see just, like, fud and, like, super, like, eth maxi stuff. So it could just be like a different information bubble too. But I don't know, I just think that they, I think that for some of, like, the no brainer blockchain use cases like, Solana could do them better than Ethereum without needing to compete with Ethereum. Like, they can coax this just fine.
00:24:48.488 - 00:25:06.684, Speaker C: I think I'm gonna save my rebuttal and give you the floor to kind of give your l two versus l one and Solana versus Ethereum. It's not really Solana versus Ethereum. Just your thoughts on any l one s anything that you do on them, kind of how you feel overall about what their long term outlooks look like.
00:25:06.812 - 00:25:53.138, Speaker B: So I use Ethereum mainnet quite a lot, particularly some of the stuff on kerb or convex or yarn or any of those kind of defi farming platforms. And I think it's clear to see that most people can't access that sort of stuff. So there is clearly a need for alternative. Still, even today, when gas fees or Ethereum price is like 50% lower than what it was before, there's still a need. So there's still that block space demand elsewhere. I think we've clearly seen that L2 s have been working pretty well. We've seen the rise of optimism and arbitrum and now Zksync, and there's hundreds more coming as well.
00:25:53.138 - 00:26:26.370, Speaker B: So it's clear to see that those are working. But I think also the alt layer ones still have value. It's clear to see, in my opinion anyway, that there is value on networks like Polygon, for example. I think you already know. I already know. I think Solana has some pretty hardcore fans and I think as long as developers and Dapp creators are still there, there will be value in the future. Now, I don't know which one's going to outperform in the future.
00:26:26.370 - 00:26:38.950, Speaker B: I don't know if it's going to be Solana or Arbitrum or polygon, I have no idea. But I do think that probably all three will do well. And so whichever one you pick, there's probably some value there and you probably will, you know, be up in the future.
00:26:40.450 - 00:27:02.186, Speaker C: Yeah. Aside from price action though, specifically, like, my point is that like for instance, if you're a defi farmer or if you're any other kind of user on ethereum, there is not a lot of reasons to use Solana at this point in time. Do you use Solana?
00:27:02.338 - 00:27:04.950, Speaker B: I completely agree with you. I do not use Solana.
00:27:05.730 - 00:27:08.230, Speaker C: Do you use any other, all l ones?
00:27:08.650 - 00:27:11.418, Speaker B: I use as many as I possibly can. So yeah, I do.
00:27:11.474 - 00:27:16.608, Speaker C: I'll use like day to day. Like what have you done on them? Kind of. Which ones have you used day to day?
00:27:16.624 - 00:27:30.340, Speaker B: I think the three chains I probably use the most are ethereum, optimism and arbitrum. But you know, if there's something exciting on other chains, I have funds on all, pretty much all chains, really. So, you know, if there's something exciting on a new chain, I'll use it.
00:27:30.880 - 00:27:34.256, Speaker C: Basically, if there's like a farming opportunity there. You'll go there?
00:27:34.368 - 00:28:09.804, Speaker B: Possibly, yeah, but no, there are other, like, cool stuff. Like, for example, not even just defi, but I mean, like, on polygon, like, I've started to use lens protocol quite a lot, using Leinster and uploading some of my videos on lens tube just because it's something different and sounds fun. There's like, some. On Polygon, there's some cool stuff related to Ens domains. So, like feline, you can, like, build your own land and showcase your on chain achievement. So there's like little fun things like that to do, which I enjoy and I think other people will enjoy when they kind of explore and see them on Solana. I don't actually know, like, what's exciting.
00:28:09.804 - 00:28:16.240, Speaker B: I haven't explored it as much as I probably should have. But I mean, the metrics are just down only, so why would. I.
00:28:19.780 - 00:29:13.396, Speaker A: Mean, he's right. He's right. But I'm saying that, like, I was never claiming that Solana as this, like, hidden gem with like, all this cool, like, hidden stuff going on right now. All I'm saying is, like, you know, you pay attention to stuff when it's uninteresting at face value, and then when you find what's beneath the surface, when there's actually substance there, that's where you can get the best returns as, like, a fundamental investor. And, I mean, it's just a different game. Like, anything on Solana right now is like, for the most part, you can do on Ethereum, but better. But that being said, you know, the definition of, like, what success is for a chain is like, super murky.
00:29:13.396 - 00:29:19.228, Speaker A: I think, like, what can we really say was successful? Like arbitrum, he made that.
00:29:19.364 - 00:29:21.200, Speaker B: I think Solana is successful.
00:29:22.220 - 00:29:23.240, Speaker A: You think so?
00:29:24.660 - 00:29:25.440, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:25.790 - 00:29:26.742, Speaker C: What do you have?
00:29:26.886 - 00:29:28.170, Speaker A: How do you define success?
00:29:29.110 - 00:29:50.174, Speaker B: Like, I think it's got fans, it's got users. There's a variety of applications to use. There is some, you know, block space value there. People are using it, there's nfts, there's lots of few defi stuff. I think it's pretty successful. You know, I don't. In terms of price, action, I don't know, and I don't really.
00:29:50.174 - 00:30:11.984, Speaker B: I'm not too fussed about that, but I think as a core, there is stuff to do there and there is demand for it. So I would classify that as a success. There's hundreds of other layer ones and L2s that literally no one uses at all. Like, they have less than 100 daily users. That's not a success. So I would say Solana is a success. Let's see which way things go.
00:30:11.984 - 00:30:23.070, Speaker B: But I'd like to think that they probably will continue to develop, continue to grow. They've still got a lot of core developers. You know, I think people shouldn't write it off completely.
00:30:24.290 - 00:31:27.070, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I don't think I write it off completely, but I will say, like, I'm curious what you think the pathway is to, like, if you were creating your own l one, how do you kind of envision a successful route? Because to me, the only way it really works, and it's been proven to work, is like one killer that highlights how you kind of how your chain differs. And I think my problem with Solana is they had a lot going for them. They had a lot of the hype. They had a larger community than they do. They had, you know, people like people, money, everything they needed. And they had a moment in time where their technology was better and more usable for specific apps than Ethereum. L1 was my main example, is something like GMX.
00:31:27.070 - 00:31:53.620, Speaker C: To me, Solana had an opportunity before Arbitrum did to build something similar to GMX and grab all of those t five specific users. Because at the end of the day, that's what brought a the Defi community to Arbitrum, I think, was that GMX protocol. And so it's like they already missed the mark on that. And then I just don't see what the next option is for them.
00:31:54.520 - 00:32:25.204, Speaker B: I think there's multiple winners. So I don't think arbitrum is going to be the only winner or optimism is going to be those two L2s are going to be the only winners. I think right now there isn't many users around. There really isn't. But give it a few years, and I think as long as Solana continue to create new dapps and all it takes is, like you said, just one dapp. So next week we could see some killer, new, innovative derivative product that everyone loves. That game changes everything, but it's on Solana.
00:32:25.204 - 00:32:28.380, Speaker B: People will use it also.
00:32:28.500 - 00:32:29.920, Speaker C: I hope they develop that.
00:32:30.620 - 00:33:16.500, Speaker A: I also think it's important to remember that Solana is, what, five years old maybe? And yet they were still, during the bull crushing Ethereum and NFT volumes. They. I mean, it onboarded me, it onboarded other people. I know, like, yes, maybe they didn't make GMX, but it was for a lot of people in the same way that BNB chain was. It was a place for new, hesitant users to go and play around with stuff when fees were high and learn how shit worked before they could, you know, commit to. Commit to moving over to Ethereum or moving over to something that's a bit, either a bit more challenging or a bit more expensive to use. So that's like, that's a success in its own way and my eyes.
00:33:17.920 - 00:33:27.220, Speaker C: But to me, that opportunity won't happen again for Solana. Like, Ethereum community has found the solution for those users.
00:33:28.280 - 00:33:30.260, Speaker A: Did you see gas last week.
00:33:32.370 - 00:33:33.218, Speaker C: On arbitrary?
00:33:33.274 - 00:33:58.880, Speaker A: On arbitrary, I mean, arbitrum was, arbitrum was not more than a dollar at any point. I think the highest I saw was like $0.60. Maybe ZK sync, I know, was fucked. I think people were paying like $30 there, and Eth mainnet was 30, $40. And keep in mind, there's like five of us on chain right now. What happens when we have actual users?
00:34:00.460 - 00:34:02.680, Speaker B: And that's why I think all of them will do well.
00:34:03.260 - 00:34:10.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess we'll wait and see for that one. But my money's not on Solana, to be honest.
00:34:10.860 - 00:34:25.959, Speaker B: I mean, that's the thing. Like, we've only got a limited amount of capital, so we have to pick our winners and losers. But I think ultimately all of them will do well. I don't know which ones will do more well than others, but that's the ones that we have to decide based on the information that we have.
00:34:26.539 - 00:34:47.639, Speaker A: How would you like, what's, like, an ideal? Not in terms of, like, what you would buy, but like, in terms of how you would balance it. What's an ideal? Like, portfolio allocation for you across, like, high risk plays versus. Versus whatever you consider blue chip? Like, what's ideal?
00:34:48.539 - 00:35:18.341, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess, obviously it depends on the person. Everyone's lives are completely different, so my portfolio is going to be completely different to other people's portfolio. I'm in a place where I'm able to take more risk, and so my portfolio will always be a bit more on the risk side than anything else. So I won't have a portfolio that's like 50% ethan, bitcoin, etcetera. Mine would be much lower. And otherwise, you know, I kind of try and balance across a variety of different areas. So I kind of COVID everything.
00:35:18.341 - 00:35:54.670, Speaker B: So I'd like to have, you know, some allocation towards layer ones and L2s, some allocation towards defi, some allocation towards stable coins, some allocation to NFT, some allocation to derivatives or other stuff, and some allocation to infrastructure, maybe like Chainlink, for example. So I think finding some sort of balance between them all is kind of what I think is an ideal portfolio, and those percentages will change based from person to person. So I try and basically build my portfolio over those categories and, yeah, pick the winners and pick the winners in each of those categories.
00:35:55.350 - 00:36:11.854, Speaker C: What kind of. So speaking of those winners, like, what are your not highest conviction bets, but like, what products or protocols are you most surprised by? Most intrigued by that. You use the most that you see doing well, next bull.
00:36:12.022 - 00:36:41.472, Speaker B: I think in terms of like, layer ones and L2s. Like, it's the main ones that we all talk about already. Ethereum, arbitrum, optimism, polygon, maybe Solana. I think those are the main five at the moment. So those are the ones that I would probably place my bets on. I think I probably have a bit more exposure to ethereum and polygon. And polygon mostly because I just think it's going to be the next normie chain that people will flock to.
00:36:41.616 - 00:36:47.060, Speaker C: Really interesting. You think they'll be able to handle that influx?
00:36:48.210 - 00:37:04.590, Speaker B: I mean, let's see, they've got a variety of products that they're building. Let's see how scalable they can make. Things like ck Evm. It's still early days, so. But, you know, things change in crypto really fast. You know, six months ago it was completely different, and in six months time, it'll be completely different. So.
00:37:04.590 - 00:37:36.770, Speaker B: But yeah, I'm hedging. I'm, you know, hedging my bets there just because of that. But then I think ultimately, like, I'm a DeFi heavy user, so most of my portfolio will be, like, defi related. There's a lot of products that I like and use pretty much every single day. The whole curve flywheel effect. So things like fracs and convex, I use a lot, and there's lots of ways to kind of get leveraged exposure to the whole curve wars as well. So I'll hedge my bets with them, like conic finance, for example.
00:37:36.770 - 00:37:38.710, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys are familiar with it.
00:37:39.410 - 00:37:41.790, Speaker C: I think Ollie's had a run with them somewhat.
00:37:42.820 - 00:38:04.000, Speaker B: Yeah. So things like that. Cool. Yeah, it's a really cool protocol. I definitely recommend checking it out. Basically, leverage bet on curve fracs. I'm a huge fan of frax just because I think the team are, like, really focusing on innovating DeFi and creating some of the most interesting products around.
00:38:04.000 - 00:38:31.450, Speaker B: And we saw that with their frax eth liquid staking derivative. And I think they've got some interesting things coming up. There's fraxv three coming up. Pretty soon, Twitter log will be full of that pretty soon. And then other kind of defi stuff. I like things like butterfly by redacted. I like ohm Olympus which have really innovated quite a lot over the last year with range bound stability.
00:38:31.450 - 00:39:01.338, Speaker B: And then yeah, just kind of concentrate my bets around, you know, things in defi that are most interesting. I think things like options as well, kind of. I don't think they're there yet. I think they still need a bit of work. But there's definitely some really interesting products around and some new ones coming pretty soon like IVX and RISc that I'm keeping a close eye on. I think Lyra at the moment probably have the best options kind of platform around the one that I use anyway. And then kind of.
00:39:01.338 - 00:39:16.300, Speaker B: What other defi stuff is there? There's a lot of NFT finance stuff coming. I mean you guys will know better than I will. I'm still trying to learn and kind of see, you know, which winners there are from the, from that category. So yeah, that's basically where I'm hedging my bets at the moment.
00:39:17.720 - 00:39:21.300, Speaker A: Have you tried out a Evo yet?
00:39:22.160 - 00:39:49.340, Speaker B: It's like your from ribbon. Yeah, I've had a look. I've had a look. I haven't actually used it myself yet, but I have had a look at it. I think options are, I think they'll grow over time. I think the whole question is really about how can they build sufficient liquidity and how can LP's protect themselves against the downside as well. But I think we'll see lots of innovation come, especially in the next six months to one year.
00:39:49.340 - 00:39:53.740, Speaker B: Avo is one that I've definitely had my eye on, but I haven't actually used myself yet.
00:39:55.680 - 00:40:25.230, Speaker A: I think it definitely has one of the better, if not, well maybe not the best, but definitely one of like the top user experiences and like the options space. But like, yeah, the like, liquidity and like capital efficiency issues are still very much there. Like with any other platform. I think options is like one of the most interesting spaces to be building right now, if you're, if you're into that. But it's also grueling, I would imagine, and still far down the line.
00:40:26.290 - 00:40:55.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I think IVX is an interesting one that's coming out pretty soon. It's not out yet and they have no product just yet, but they're building their options on top of GMX. So all of the liquidity from GMX hopefully can somehow be utilized in another way with options. So I'm keeping an eye on that. But, yeah, I completely agree with you. Like, I think it's a pretty untapped space at the moment, and it's just a matter of time, I think, before they really do. Well, I think the total value locked up for all options is like 300 million or something.
00:40:55.910 - 00:41:14.264, Speaker B: I don't know. Let me have a look. Maybe less than that. Maybe like 150,000,000. Tvl yeah, it's like a pretty low. Yeah, it's all built on top of GMX, so I would have a look at that. But, yeah, 100 5200 mil TVL.
00:41:14.264 - 00:41:21.140, Speaker B: I mean, it's so, so small. And I think the more competition, the more innovation. So it's just a matter of time.
00:41:22.000 - 00:41:28.320, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Any recent, like, pawnees that you've been a fan of recently?
00:41:30.620 - 00:41:35.520, Speaker B: I mean, I've just been farming the hell out of om right now because the yields are so high.
00:41:37.580 - 00:41:41.360, Speaker C: So that's you holding on to that or just dumping?
00:41:41.740 - 00:42:23.678, Speaker B: Yeah. Ohm is really incredible now because they've got this system called range bound stability, so it's not volatile anymore, and they don't have, basically, phasing out staking altogether. I think if, you know, back in the day, ohm staking was like 100,000% APY, and now it's 2%. And they've got, with range bound stability, they have this complex mechanism which uses Amos to basically hold the price of ohm within a certain range. When the price of om reaches the top of the range, new Ohm is minted and sold. And when Om reaches the bottom, the treasury, which is about $250 million, is used to basically buy Ohm. And they have lots of interesting bonds and things like that to help basically keep that up.
00:42:23.678 - 00:43:06.566, Speaker B: The treasury is mostly in stablecoins as well, and all of them are yield generating. So things like fracs that they hold, it's used in curve, so they're earning like three, 4% on their fracs. That's used to build a treasury, which ultimately leads to greater backing for Om. You can see if you just look at the Ohm price for the last maybe four or five months, it's been so stable. And I think it's a pretty interesting change to how people use stable assets in crypto, especially in DeFi, because I think, for me, I think the number one product market fit of Defi is stable coins, really. Or crypto, I could say. And I think stable coins is, like, probably the one area of crypto that I'm most interested in at the moment.
00:43:06.566 - 00:43:56.440, Speaker B: So any product built with or on or with the concept of stable coins pretty much has me hooked straight away. And I think a lot of that comes from like just looking at kind of macro stuff and seeing how people are using stable coins in Turkey and Lebanon, where inflation rates are so high. And in Turkey nowadays, most people are not using turkish liras, they're using USDT on Tron, and it's traded at a 12% premium there. So the more stablecoin products that come around, the more excited I am. And yeah, I think OM is definitely, Olympus is definitely like changing the way that we use stable assets, especially with the recent USDC and circle issue, Silicon Valley bank issue. So I think, yeah, it's definitely caught my eye and I'm definitely interested in.
00:43:57.220 - 00:44:04.400, Speaker C: Speaking of, how do you feel about the dinero stuff? Could you explain that to us like we're five?
00:44:04.700 - 00:44:39.310, Speaker B: Yeah. So Dinero is basically redacted's stablecoin, which is going to be backed by ETH and staked ETH. So essentially what will happen is ETH gets deposited onto one of redactus products that they have at the moment called Pyrex, which is essentially an auto compounder. And when that happens, eth gets converted into px eth or pyrex eth. So redacted, the stablecoin de niro. Sorry. This stablecoin will be backed by both Vanilla EtH and staked ETH.
00:44:39.310 - 00:45:28.294, Speaker B: And essentially what they're going to do is they're going to build out their own validator set. So we're going to see lots of redacted validators come out. And I essentially because of not now, but in future, when redacted's validators grow to a substantial level, they will be able to enable things like meta transactions. So we'll be able to use dinero as a token for paying gas because this is all going to go through the redacted validators. So, yeah, essentially it's a new player to the liquid staking derivative game. All of these kind of interesting things are going to be quite a while away because redacted need to build out their validators. So, I mean, that's pretty much it really.
00:45:28.294 - 00:45:30.650, Speaker B: It's just a eth back stable coin.
00:45:31.230 - 00:45:46.020, Speaker A: Do you, if you were to, do you have like a decentralized stable that you're particularly fond of or that you would have more conviction in? I don't know. If you're like in the weeds with some of the newer ones, like, I don't know, like dyad or like gyroscope or something like that.
00:45:48.040 - 00:46:17.790, Speaker B: Not really to be honest, at the moment, the stable coins that I use mostly it's just because of liquidity issues is USDC fracs. I try and device diversify a little bit. So I do have USdt as well. I have Dai and I have ohm. So I've really tried to kind of range out a little bit, but ultimately I know that most of them are essentially a wrapped version of USDC. So that's why I'm pretty excited for De Niro. LUSD is pretty interesting, but it's over pegged so it's not really working very well.
00:46:17.790 - 00:47:03.520, Speaker B: Let's see how the stablecoin market develops. At the moment, USDC and USDT have such an enormous market share that the stablecoin market is still pretty immature. And because I think stablecoins are like the number one product market fit of crypto, I think it's going to be the one place where we'll see a lot of innovation over the coming years, especially as more people are forced to use it. Being in countries like Argentina, I don't know, it may be in Argentina, I don't know how people use stable coins but I definitely know in Turkey and Lebanon people use them. So yeah, those are the stable coins I use and I like the concept of ohm. So I use ohm as well. I haven't tapped into some of these kind of new ones just yet, but Daenerys I definitely will be.
00:47:04.410 - 00:47:05.590, Speaker C: You heard of yama?
00:47:06.810 - 00:47:14.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I have. Have, yes. Oh, the other stable coin would be from tapioca.
00:47:15.410 - 00:47:37.640, Speaker A: Yes. I actually don't know. I don't know how I feel about that one yet. I really like tapioca but I think. I don't know. I like how they built this stable coin into their mechanism until the DSO, the DSO model. But I don't know how like scalable it'll be.
00:47:37.640 - 00:47:49.020, Speaker A: Like I think in a vacuum for creating like properly aligned incentives in tapioca. Like it's great for that. But as like a standalone stable coin, I'm hesitant.
00:47:50.240 - 00:47:58.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we'll have to just see how they actually launch it. But it's something I'm definitely excited about. I'll definitely keep a close eye on it.
00:47:58.680 - 00:47:59.320, Speaker C: Definitely.
00:47:59.360 - 00:48:00.744, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be a fun one.
00:48:00.832 - 00:48:31.674, Speaker B: I think the problem with all of these newer stable coins is that there just isn't enough liquidity around so it's so easy for them to just kind of die and like people just stop using them. And because there's such a big dominance that USDC Dai tether, I mean maybe even BUSd have it makes it hard really for some of the other stable coins to come up. But I think as they continue to innovate, like people will use them, there will be nice features and there will be interesting use cases for them.
00:48:31.842 - 00:49:17.942, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. To me, my smooth brain thesis on a lot of protocol specific stablecoins that I see come out is that it's all the value just going to have to go through something like curve for those liquidity issues because I feel like a solution that a lot of protocols have found is just launching their own native stable coin to make it, I guess, easier for them and like JPEG test their own. And NFT Phi is still very small, but they're utilizing like the benefits that come with having their own stable coin. And so I think most of that will just come down to the trickle down into like the curve ecosystem.
00:49:18.086 - 00:50:17.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I think that's where things like Konnick Finance will do really well because Konnick have these stablecoin omnipools where lots of these new protocols who are all making their new Stablecoin will want liquidity. So they'll go to conic and they'll basically use their conic governance tokens to bribe so that they can get allocation towards their pools. Essentially what happens is let's say there's a USDC pool on Konnick. That USDC goes into a variety of different curve pools to build liquidity. And so, you know, let's say, you know, we have exit liquidity create their own StaBlecoin and they want to, you know, BuIld SOme liquidity, they'll create a bribe on KOnnIcK and you know, if the three of us will be bribing and buying conic tokens to bribe for liquidity, and hopefully, you know, the exit liquidity stablecoin grows in mass, you know, and has a huge TVL across all the different curve pools. And I think that's what a lot of other daoism projects will do.
00:50:17.262 - 00:50:26.490, Speaker C: Interesting. Wrapping it up on like a higher level, just like some quick hot takes from you specifically.
00:50:27.030 - 00:50:27.902, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:50:28.046 - 00:50:31.250, Speaker C: Do you, are you in the boat that the bottom is in?
00:50:31.950 - 00:50:32.730, Speaker B: Yes.
00:50:33.470 - 00:50:59.770, Speaker C: Really interesting on everything. How do you feel about, from what I grasped your like main, the only thing you really care about, similar to me, is like eth price. Really? And that's not the only thing I care about per se, but that's how I like gauge the market as a whole. Do you pay attention to like ETH BTC chart? Are you like in the boat that there's going to be a flipping.
00:51:00.270 - 00:51:36.674, Speaker B: Yes, I do. I def. I think, look, bitcoin is great. Bitcoin has its two main functions, you know, a transfer of value and a store of value, and it does it very well. I mean, some might argue that it doesn't hold value well, but I think it does. But Ethereum just has that extra, you know, optional programmability. And I think just the fact that we are able to use all of these different, amazing, innovative applications and because I'm such a big fan of all this defi stuff, options and real world assets and derivatives and stable coins and all the stuff, I only think it's going to grow.
00:51:36.674 - 00:52:17.480, Speaker B: And I think all of that value ultimately goes back into Ethereum. Just look at how many L2s there are right now. The growth of all of them is basically directly tied to the growth of Ethereum, in the sense that as the L2s grow, we'll see Ethereum grow as well. And so I think there will be a point in time where Ethereum just has so much more value. It's the currency of the Internet and it's a matter of time, especially with account abstraction and all this other stuff, where people will hopefully be using some of these crazy defi apps on their phone in the future and they won't even know that they're using some random L2. And all that value will hopefully go back to Ethereum. I think at that point, Ethereum probably has more value than bitcoin.
00:52:19.460 - 00:52:21.480, Speaker A: I like that. I like that take.
00:52:23.540 - 00:52:24.868, Speaker C: Okay, so do I.
00:52:24.924 - 00:52:42.464, Speaker A: Should I had something, but I totally forgot. This isn't what I was thinking, but we, what we usually do on like, our subtle episodes is just for shits. We'll do calls of the week at the end of every episode, which.
00:52:42.592 - 00:52:43.632, Speaker C: Forgot about that.
00:52:43.696 - 00:52:47.100, Speaker A: What's gonna outperform over the next week, do you think?
00:52:47.520 - 00:52:48.464, Speaker B: Over the next week?
00:52:48.512 - 00:52:57.320, Speaker A: Financial advice or anything? Obviously super short time frame. So it's like, it's like, like dumb in its own way, but it's fun. So let's hear it. Calls of the week.
00:52:57.480 - 00:53:02.660, Speaker C: I haven't brought anything. I'll give. Throw some out here.
00:53:03.050 - 00:53:36.080, Speaker B: I mean, the thing is, a week is too short. Anything could happen in a week. But I definitely have a feeling of like, some things that will hopefully outperform soon. I don't know if that's going to happen this week or next week or something, but I mean, we have like, hopefully curve USD coming out pretty soon. I think as soon as curve USD comes out just watch curve and conic and all of those kind of things really outperform fracs. Version three is coming out and, you know, hopefully we'll see fracs shift from USDC collateral to something else. So watch FXS.
00:53:36.080 - 00:53:38.868, Speaker B: Those are the two things I can.
00:53:38.884 - 00:53:44.044, Speaker C: See about the whole fracs thing. I saw some news about them doing a deal with Paxos.
00:53:44.212 - 00:54:03.824, Speaker B: Yeah. So it seems like, I mean, we don't know too much at the moment. That was just a small, like, snippet, really, in the telegram, just about how potentially USDC will be started to phase out and USDP will kind of come in, but we don't have much information. Yeah, I've gone through the telegram, like, so many times and couldn't find anything.
00:54:03.872 - 00:54:15.940, Speaker C: So is that like a. The USDP, is that basically because the sentiment on CT has been that's basically backed by treasuries?
00:54:16.560 - 00:54:20.280, Speaker B: Is that's right, legit, as far as I'm aware. I think so.
00:54:20.320 - 00:54:52.786, Speaker C: And do you think the Paxos partnerships is like. Like, if it does happen, especially with, like, what the news on Paxos has been recently, do you think that's beneficial overall for the long term success of. Because I know that Franks and Sam have discussed opening a Fed master account and things like that. I don't know how likely that is. I hope they do, but they're not even giving anybody that. I think it's a little bit farther out. Do you think this is a better alternative?
00:54:52.918 - 00:55:27.610, Speaker B: I think, yeah. I mean, no one has a clue, like, how long that will take or even if that is possible. I mean, they're saying that they want to achieve it, but they haven't really been able to expand too much on it. But I think definitely this is something more interesting in the short term anyway, where perhaps they've created a partnership where some of the treasury value goes to fracs that paxos make. If that is the case, and that's bullish, because fracs will make another 20, 30 million in revenue a year. Everything is unknown at the moment. We don't really know, but I think if that is the case, then hopefully that works well.
00:55:27.610 - 00:55:31.470, Speaker B: More revenue, more profit. Fxs token goes up.
00:55:31.810 - 00:55:39.242, Speaker C: Yeah, simple as that, huh. Do you have any other ones for the week or for the timeline, if you want?
00:55:39.346 - 00:56:02.036, Speaker B: Well, I know that y two k are working on version two for earthquake, so if that comes out whenever it does, expect y two k token to go up. Gearbox, they've got version three coming out pretty soon, or kind of a phased release anyway, so they actually I don't know if this is coming out next week or the week after a proposal.
00:56:02.068 - 00:56:04.160, Speaker A: Just went up for redefining tokenomics.
00:56:05.380 - 00:56:16.870, Speaker B: Oh, nice. So there you go. I think that's the main thing. My main concern regarding gearbox is. Yeah, exactly. So, yeah. Whenever gearbox v three comes out, well, it's coming out anyway.
00:56:16.870 - 00:56:34.150, Speaker B: That's gonna be good for gear. So what have I said? I said fxs, curve, convex y two k, and gearbox. A good group, but it might not be next week.
00:56:34.770 - 00:56:59.628, Speaker C: Yeah, I haven't. I honestly have no. I have nothing high conviction. I'm not gonna lie. I mean, this is less of, like, buy this today and pray that it goes up in a week, but if there's ever a world where you see arbitrum close to a dollar, you should buy that. I feel like I have the same bags. Same thing with, like, blur.
00:56:59.628 - 00:57:02.760, Speaker C: If you see that below $0.50, it's automatic.
00:57:03.990 - 00:57:07.310, Speaker B: Need to spend more time looking at blur. Don't ask myself.
00:57:07.390 - 00:57:36.892, Speaker C: My analysis on blur is not fundamental in any way, shape, or form. I think those guys just build out everything that's needed. And if you want to bet on, like, nft growth and adoption. And I also think this is, like. Again, there's no fundamental. Like, I have no alpha in terms of whether this is legit or not. But based on the guys that I think they are and the interviews I've listened to with Pac Man, I think they're going to stay on cutting edge for everything to do with NFTs and NFT five.
00:57:36.892 - 00:57:59.538, Speaker C: And so I think they're gonna. They're gonna be, like, the go to product for that for, like, a long time. Yeah. I mean, I would. Anything, you know, $1.50 for synthetix, I would grab. I would also just, like, I'm probably gonna start using them because they're doing the op rewards, incentives and stuff.
00:57:59.674 - 00:58:00.910, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough.
00:58:01.770 - 00:58:04.010, Speaker C: Seeing milady at three eth after.
00:58:04.170 - 00:58:09.470, Speaker B: Damn cedar. I have a question. What keeps people from using blur at the moment?
00:58:10.450 - 00:58:12.098, Speaker C: What keeps them from using blur?
00:58:12.194 - 00:58:16.910, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean. Sorry. Why do people use blur at the moment? What's. What's keeping them on blur?
00:58:18.170 - 00:59:27.728, Speaker C: I think they will garner people's attention for the foreseeable future and after that, because they can do more things they can do not just, like, incentivizing with tokens and airdrops, but they can, like, they. With their token and with its current valuation and future valuation, I think, is not going to be far off of where it is now. I think what happens is they're like maneuverability and it's okay, it's a security. Well, it's not a security, but if you're doing illegal things versus doing legal things. So Opensea versus blur, you have more flexibility and you can drive people to your product when you're able to do illegal things versus opensea, that's bound by their legality, I feel like. And I think that alone is going to keep people using blur. I also think it's a better product than Opensea Pro, even with that bullshit that came out and like, people fantasizing about some dumb gem Nft or whatever.
00:59:27.728 - 00:59:54.790, Speaker C: I think Blur's partnerships, their ethos, their like, products that they have in the pipeline are going to keep people coming. And they know, they clearly know how to drive incentives. I mean, they worked through that whole incentivization airdrop and have kept the hype going. They have a roadmap with shit that's like literally blurred out. Like they're gonna keep people's, they're gonna keep attention in people's mind for a long time.
00:59:55.730 - 00:59:57.842, Speaker A: NFT volumes are all, dude, when they.
00:59:57.866 - 01:00:20.212, Speaker C: Came, okay, that's the NFT market. That's the NFT market in general. That's NFT market in general. But I think the, the thing with blur is, fuck, I lost my training clock, but Opensea just can't do the same things blur can do. And it comes with a token. I think it all revolves around the token.
01:00:20.236 - 01:00:28.720, Speaker B: What happens if another protocol platform comes out next week that does what Blur can do? Will people move over?
01:00:29.300 - 01:00:30.964, Speaker C: No. Yeah, it's already happening.
01:00:31.012 - 01:00:34.040, Speaker A: Like, people are not gonna, I think is what it's called.
01:00:34.900 - 01:00:37.276, Speaker B: People are people moving over or not?
01:00:37.348 - 01:01:17.792, Speaker A: People farmed it, people are farming it still. But, but no one's like, no one's becoming like a magically power user like blur. Blur has done a good job retaining for the most part and also like they're approach to like Ux and NFT trading in general was novel at the time. And people like magically or like Opensea Pro are pretty much just copying them. I honestly think they're both better now in Ux compared to blurtaindeh. But Blur is stickier because the incentives are going to be way higher there and people are used to blur by now. So no, like, it's not that much doing.
01:01:17.792 - 01:01:19.060, Speaker A: People are going to go and switch.
01:01:19.880 - 01:01:37.980, Speaker C: Doing what Blur did was considered impossible before they came out. So I like, in a place where like a lot of stuff is hot air and all you can really bet on is teams, I'm putting my money behind a team that did what they did because I think they're going to be able to iterate further on that.
01:01:38.600 - 01:01:49.340, Speaker B: I just wonder, do, does Blur have the same effect that uniswap has? Like, even though there's better exchanges around, people still use uniswap. Is the same thing gonna happen with blur?
01:01:49.960 - 01:02:32.740, Speaker C: See the thing? Well, Uniswap came out with an actual token. Whether or not it has fee share and all of those things is a different story. But that token allowed for the speculation and Opensea doesn't have that alone in itself. And then there's also the governance aspects. So when you're releasing a token that has no, like, intrinsic value, but has speculation value and you can do governance, it's like you're absorbing all of the decentralized ethos that come with being involved in crypto. And so I feel like me as a user, I gravitate towards protocols that, like, invoke that ethos just off that. I feel like that's what the main purpose of the token really is.
01:02:32.740 - 01:03:24.626, Speaker C: And when you're with Opensea, like, when you use blur, it's a little cliche, but like, you feel like you can. You're a part of the growth. That's what happens with like, you know, joining these fucking cults of crypto protocols, but you're part of the growth. You tell other people to use it because, you know, token price goes up when other people use it. It's the idea of like, like with Amazon, if, like people token, if Amazon was tokenized and your prime membership was tokenized, you would be like, incentivized to have more people use it and tell more people about it. But I think, like, opensea just loses all of that when they like, because there's no retail that's just going to buy NFTs right now. And so, like, the pro people and the degenerate people are carrying the market right now and I think they're going to stick around with blur.
01:03:24.626 - 01:03:26.750, Speaker C: I don't think they're going to go back to Opensea.
01:03:29.370 - 01:03:30.034, Speaker B: Oh, and Ali.
01:03:30.082 - 01:04:39.330, Speaker A: Yeah, the uniswap comparison is tough to make though, like, because, I mean, Uniswap was much more innovative at its time with v one and v three both, I think. And I think the reason people still use it now, or the reason it's retain so much is because what v three offered, people weren't able to find elsewhere. Whereas with blur, I mean, you can't, sure, you can't fork what they did with. With capturing so much of open sea share with pretty much how they expose like, the whole nature behind your average NFT trader and how all it took was well, line incentives to get that attention. I don't think that's like as sticky as what Uniswap did or what Uni v three does now, because if anything, it proved more so how low switching costs are, how easy it is, not how easy it is, but the fact that it's feasible to get people to switch en masse to a new product without having too much of a significant innovation over the incumbents.
01:04:40.080 - 01:05:12.628, Speaker C: I think, like, filling the bags of people that are threaders and, you know, there's a community behind blur that whenever a new product comes out or a new feature comes out, you're gonna see a shit ton of threads upon it and people are gonna start speculating on it again. And you can't do that. You can't do that with Opensea. Like fucking McKenna or whoever. Like pick your favorite threader is not gonna make a thread on an Opensea product because there's no fucking speculation where they don't have any bags of it. Yeah, these people are. Yeah.
01:05:12.628 - 01:05:19.116, Speaker C: And so, like, when the normies come back, like, they're gonna hear about blur more often than they're gonna hear about open, see, because there's a token to speculate on.
01:05:19.228 - 01:05:34.802, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough. I mean, the other day, I haven't bought an NFT for a long time now, but the other day I was looking at some and I did want to buy one, but when I went to, I couldn't even, I couldn't even find it. Damien Hurst, the currency, I don't even.
01:05:34.826 - 01:05:36.230, Speaker C: Know if that's the current.
01:05:36.690 - 01:06:20.096, Speaker B: Yeah, so, so back in the day, like, I can't remember when this was, but this was like, always trending on OpenSea. And it's basically these 5000 pieces of artwork that Damian has created, these, like, dots. And I think there was some interesting concept where like, you could burn your NFT and claim a real one in real life and the real ones are selling for like $10,000, but on chain they are only like $5,000 in ETh. But Damien has stopped the ability to make real copies of it now. So I just thought it was really cool. And then I went to Amsterdam and I saw it in a gallery and I was like, oh, I recognize this from Opensea. And I just thought it was really cool.
01:06:20.096 - 01:06:27.690, Speaker B: I liked the story behind it. And I think Damien Hirst might be british. I can't remember. But if he is, then extra bonus.
01:06:28.270 - 01:06:55.912, Speaker C: Yeah. Other than that for my bags for this week, I mean like curve at $0.50 is beautiful. I think I really started to like Trader Joe. I think just seeing a product do more with little versus Uniswap, it's just always good to see. So like watch that ship fall to like forty cents and then start paying attention. But other than that, like, so you.
01:06:55.936 - 01:06:59.740, Speaker B: Asked me the question before, but do you guys think that the bottom is in?
01:07:00.120 - 01:07:03.740, Speaker A: I don't like to answer that question. I mean, I take offense to that.
01:07:04.360 - 01:07:26.466, Speaker C: No, I think there is a world where the bottom is in and if we're living in that world, like the real question is do I buy eth at this price? No, I don't. When it starts getting closer to like 1400, you know, but if it gets to a $1,000 ever again, like, yeah, I'm loading up.
01:07:26.498 - 01:07:30.314, Speaker B: Like if it gets a $1,000, I'm selling my house and buying eth.
01:07:30.402 - 01:07:44.750, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah, that's like a lot of pretty much it for me. Definitely a lot easier said than done. But if you have the capital sitting and the ETH is at a $1,000, like I think that's one of the easiest trades.
01:07:45.170 - 01:07:49.450, Speaker B: So I'm guessing, uh, unsure is the answer.
01:07:49.830 - 01:07:53.366, Speaker A: I mean, my answer you're gonna go with.
01:07:53.398 - 01:07:56.770, Speaker C: My answer is I'm more leaning towards no, yes loosely.
01:07:57.350 - 01:08:10.930, Speaker A: My answer is yes loosely. And I don't really care whether I'm right or wrong because I'm not really gonna change the way I position because of it. Like, either way I'm gonna keep doing what I do, you know?
01:08:11.430 - 01:08:43.042, Speaker B: Fair enough. I think the same for me. Like, I do think the bottom is in, especially after FTX. Like, I can't see how there's going to be so much more contagion that's going to cause prices to go below where they were before. I think certainly prices can go down, but whether or not they surpass the previous lows, there has to be some ridiculous crazy event for that to happen now, I think. But it doesn't matter for me because I think this whole year is going to be accumulation for me. So I'll just keep dollar cost averaging.
01:08:43.066 - 01:08:48.356, Speaker C: In altcoin season boat. Are you like buying off this like mini dip that's happening?
01:08:48.508 - 01:09:08.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll continue to buy. I'll buy every single month this year. I think. I think that one thing that I'll find is that at certain points in time, like, it doesn't make sense for me to buy one particular asset, but I'll definitely find another asset that's at discount. So I'll go for that instead. But yeah, I'll continue to buy for the rest of this year.
01:09:08.820 - 01:09:49.260, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, definitely the same over here for mine. I am actually really excited to read this gearbox pre proposal thing, because the token was the biggest thing that LA. I guess the token and the scalability, definitely, but it needs to be limited for the time being. But as long as these tokenomics aren't a complete scam, I think it's going to be pretty bullish, because there, like, it was literally just the governance token up until whenever this passes, assuming it passes. And gearbox is really cheap now, too. I had a bag.
01:09:49.260 - 01:10:14.610, Speaker A: I had a pretty big bag, actually, but I started to realize it was a bit too early, so I exited almost completely, and then it fell like 50% from there. So I ended up either getting lucky or playing that one well. But I'm liking where it's at now. It's like, near all time lows, so I'm going to start building up a pretty substantial position there. Pendle is good. I've just. I'm really bullish on Pendle, man.
01:10:14.610 - 01:10:46.136, Speaker A: Ever since. Pretty much ever since, like, Shanghai went over successfully, I've made that one of my, like, primary holdings, I would say. Meaning that I added on a bit and will continue to add on, and I try and keep up with, like, updates and governance and stuff and make sure things are just going smoothly. So pendle's always good. It's down too. I think it's down like 30% from all time highs already, which is pretty sweet. I still want to squiggle.
01:10:46.136 - 01:10:53.020, Speaker A: Nothing has changed on that for, I think, and like every other, it's like eight nineties. I think.
01:10:55.120 - 01:10:56.300, Speaker B: This, this.
01:10:56.890 - 01:10:57.530, Speaker A: Go ahead.
01:10:57.610 - 01:11:28.200, Speaker B: I was just going to say one of the. I think squiggles and the NFT that I wanted the currency have quite a few similarities in terms of they held historical significance and they look similar as well. One of the reasons why I was going for the currency is just because it's cheaper than the squiggle, but I wonder how easy is it to get exposure via insert finances shards or anything like that? I don't know if they have one for squiggles yet.
01:11:28.500 - 01:12:31.070, Speaker A: They do, they do, but they're full and they're overpriced as well. Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily be looking at that. I mean, you can get squiggled out tokens, but they're in the process of, like, reworking that. I know squiggled out is dropping their, like, own membership NFT soon, but squiggled out is cool, but it's not the reed. Like, I'll give you the pitch on squiggles real quick, like without like getting in, getting too deep into like the community or like the history behind it, which personally I think is like the strongest, like value add for it. But it's also like currently it's the most like financially utilitarian NFT. I think you can, I mean, guess, I don't know how big you are to nft five, but squiggles from squiggled out, they have standing, standing offers to borrow against them for like six ETH at 5% APR for a year.
01:12:31.070 - 01:12:57.696, Speaker A: So if you buy squiggle, that's pretty good. And still, yeah, you can still retain like something like 60, 70% liquidity against it. And, you know, you pay off like half an ETH an interest per year, something like that. And nothing else comes anywhere close to that. And it's standing off between the Daos too. So there's no shortage of them as of right now. For me, that was like the tipping point.
01:12:57.696 - 01:13:03.660, Speaker A: Once I heard they were doing that, I was like, all right, this is my next big thing one day.
01:13:04.200 - 01:13:14.980, Speaker B: Fair enough. I think they held historical value, so I don't think that they're ever going to go away. I think if you get one, you hold it for a long time.
01:13:15.720 - 01:13:18.260, Speaker A: Definitely, definitely.
01:13:19.840 - 01:13:20.780, Speaker B: Fair enough.
01:13:21.120 - 01:13:29.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess that's what I say. Gear Pendle squiggles. That's like what I, that's like pretty much what I say every week. Honestly, these are my babies.
01:13:30.240 - 01:13:39.220, Speaker B: What are your thoughts on, like, some of the defi stuff that I'm more interested in, like, you know, butterfly or Frax share, convex, etcetera.
01:13:41.100 - 01:14:17.560, Speaker A: I like butterfly. I have a reasonable bag of locked butterfly. Dinero is interesting. I haven't fully formed my opinion around it yet, but I think just because of the redacted treasury, I think it's bound for a top five spot among decentralized stables, not including USDC, USDT. So it's already pretty well positioned. But the mechanics behind it, I'm not fully sold on yet. Curve, I think I stand in a different spot from you guys on stable coins in general.
01:14:17.560 - 01:14:56.642, Speaker A: I think the stablecoin wars are largely over. And I think that while curve is important and will continue to be, I think that its growth is going to be limited because of that. Like, I think the way that the tokenomics were designed weren't done so to make the price go up, it was more so to retain value. So curve is going to be a good investment, I think, but it's going to be a safe investment. It's not. I don't think it's like. I don't think it's going to outperform more, most if not all of the newer defi stuff I would rather be buying.
01:14:56.666 - 01:14:57.470, Speaker B: No, I agree.
01:14:58.140 - 01:15:03.120, Speaker A: Yeah. That being said, safe investments are hard to come by. Crypto.
01:15:03.740 - 01:15:26.420, Speaker B: I think there's going to be a curve wars part two, especially now that aave are making their stable coin. We've got the curved stable coin, we've got dinero, we've got tapioca, we've got basically 2030 new stablecoin products coming. And I think because of that we'll see some sort of stable coin wars again, part two with the new saber coins.
01:15:26.840 - 01:15:28.140, Speaker C: I agree as well.
01:15:28.760 - 01:15:31.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we'll see how that comes.
01:15:31.680 - 01:15:59.990, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it comes. I just don't think it comes at the scale that we saw before. So we'll see. Definitely it'll be interesting in any case. And I'm curious to see how the tokenomics age like once, because as far as I know, like most of the larger lp's on curve are four year lockers to at least two up to four year lockers for the most part. So I'm curious to see how like the unlocks start to start to factor in the token price down the line. Yeah, Frax is awesome.
01:15:59.990 - 01:16:36.820, Speaker A: What else did you talk about? Most of the. I think it sounds like what you're mostly into is like the remnants of what succeeded in the earlier days of Defi, which is super, super important. I think products that I love, teams that I love, but some of them curve convex. I haven't looked into conic yet too much, but if it's a leverage bet on curve, then I probably have a similar take there. Bit more lukewarm on, I would say, in terms of the future outlook.
01:16:37.440 - 01:16:40.552, Speaker B: Fair enough. I think. Yeah.
01:16:40.736 - 01:17:07.310, Speaker C: I was going to mention for one of Ali's takes because he reminded us of it in the DM's for the Dow incentives that are coming to the arbitrum daos. People should probably start paying attention to what happens on the governance side of those things. I feel like that's a good place to precede any speculation in token price for these daos.
01:17:07.850 - 01:17:19.480, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. I don't know how they're gonna play out. I don't. I personally, I'm not expecting them to give out any kind of incentives or anything. I think they should just basically hold onto the arb and build their treasury.
01:17:20.580 - 01:17:21.492, Speaker C: Interesting.
01:17:21.636 - 01:17:25.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not expecting any crazy rewards or anything like that.
01:17:26.700 - 01:17:37.890, Speaker C: I actually think magic is gonna start giving out some good rewards. I feel like if they lean into some of the games they have on their platform, start rewarding people for playing them with Arp tokens. That'd be cool.
01:17:38.710 - 01:17:49.890, Speaker A: Magic games. Because I know people talk about how they have, but I. Yeah, I haven't. I played bridge a while back, but Bridge World is pretty, uh, it's pretty just like Barbie click and earn type of thing.
01:17:50.630 - 01:18:09.410, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I haven't. I think the last thing that I used to play was defi kingdoms. Thankfully I got lucky. I think I sold the top, or very close to the top on that. Just, it became so overvalued to me and I could, it just felt like pure euphoria at the time. So I just got out.
01:18:11.030 - 01:18:27.766, Speaker C: All right. That is. Oh dude, I never did an intro. This is episode 15, episode 15 of the Exit liquidity pod. We got a big announcement for the coming weeks. Got some big stuff planned. So we appreciate you for coming on.
01:18:27.766 - 01:18:45.658, Speaker C: What I really appreciate, you got any recommendations? Because I really like bringing threaders on and I, after this next season that we have planned a few months, probably around the summertime, I want to bring on like more threaders and like, it's interesting to hear your guys stories.
01:18:45.834 - 01:18:57.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm in a big group chat with lots of the big threaders. So I'll definitely send your podcast their way because I'm sure many of them would like to participate. Potentially.
01:18:57.358 - 01:19:00.350, Speaker C: Awesome. I appreciate that. Thanks for coming on.
