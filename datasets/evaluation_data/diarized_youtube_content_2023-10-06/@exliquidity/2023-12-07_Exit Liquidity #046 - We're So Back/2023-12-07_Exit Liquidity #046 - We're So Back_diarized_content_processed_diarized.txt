00:00:13.080 - 00:00:14.542, Speaker A: I didn't. I didn't feel like running the music.
00:00:14.606 - 00:00:16.010, Speaker B: The hell was that?
00:00:17.950 - 00:00:20.170, Speaker A: I'm starting to not like the music as much.
00:00:20.710 - 00:00:27.010, Speaker B: You gotta change it up. We can't have the same song every time. But that was lame. I was lame as hell.
00:00:27.170 - 00:00:34.430, Speaker A: It's hard to, uh. It's hard to make these, like, mixes thingies and make them actually sound good.
00:00:35.730 - 00:00:42.870, Speaker B: Have you seen there's, like, some people have. Or, like, one guy I saw has been getting banned for using music in his videos.
00:00:44.610 - 00:00:46.154, Speaker A: Banned from what? Twitter.
00:00:46.282 - 00:00:49.642, Speaker B: From Twitter? Yeah. See if I can find it. I think.
00:00:49.786 - 00:00:50.830, Speaker A: No shot.
00:00:51.300 - 00:01:14.516, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's somewhere. It's somewhere on my slack. But I definitely remember, like, he got banned twice with, like. No. With, like, no real reason why besides like that. Or like, they didn't tell him, like, which one it was or anything like that. So might have to worry.
00:01:14.516 - 00:01:16.840, Speaker B: Worry about that someday.
00:01:19.310 - 00:01:21.250, Speaker A: We'll deal with it when we get there, I guess.
00:01:24.150 - 00:01:29.550, Speaker B: Damn. I really needed. I don't know. I was used to that intro. I needed some. I don't know.
00:01:29.670 - 00:01:34.286, Speaker A: Every time you, like, I thought you really, like, didn't like the music.
00:01:34.358 - 00:01:48.490, Speaker B: I was like, I didn't. But I think, like, you know, like the Pavlov's experiment where, like, he makes the dog salivate at, like, the sound of a. The sound of a, like a button or something. It's kind of like that. Like, it, like, puts me in the mood, you know?
00:01:48.790 - 00:01:53.846, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you want me to end the. End the stream restart?
00:01:53.918 - 00:02:02.190, Speaker B: No, no, no. It's too far gone now. What was the last time we did a solo episode? Last time we did a solo episode.
00:02:02.230 - 00:02:04.610, Speaker A: Was a couple weeks ago.
00:02:05.190 - 00:02:05.718, Speaker B: Recently?
00:02:05.814 - 00:02:06.046, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:06.078 - 00:02:06.854, Speaker B: Not that long ago.
00:02:06.902 - 00:02:07.494, Speaker A: Not that long.
00:02:07.542 - 00:02:11.180, Speaker B: Do we talk about. You just kind of. You just kind of complained about bank list the whole time.
00:02:11.310 - 00:02:15.380, Speaker A: I know. That's why I don't want to, like, uh, over speak again.
00:02:16.280 - 00:02:18.216, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, um. I think too hard.
00:02:18.248 - 00:02:19.408, Speaker A: Last episode.
00:02:19.584 - 00:02:21.300, Speaker B: Well, we haven't really, like.
00:02:21.800 - 00:02:22.496, Speaker A: I was.
00:02:22.608 - 00:02:23.560, Speaker B: You're right.
00:02:23.720 - 00:02:25.220, Speaker A: I mean, I was sort of right.
00:02:25.720 - 00:02:27.900, Speaker B: Because they had another controversy.
00:02:28.720 - 00:02:54.158, Speaker A: Mmm. Because it was like a controversy that, like, aligned with what the. What I believe the kind of people they were. And I, uh. A lot of people only realized through that specific controversy, I guess it's actually pretty funny now, um, that David Hoffman guy, I'm not going to get into it, but he's not.
00:02:54.254 - 00:02:56.406, Speaker B: We already did a whole solo. Have you seen on this?
00:02:56.478 - 00:03:09.980, Speaker A: Have you seen that meme, though? It's like a. He's been. He's been posting a lot of Solana memes, like, just straight dunking on Solana. I kind of respect it. I kind of respect it. Like, he's going very hard on the hate for Solana.
00:03:10.600 - 00:03:42.310, Speaker B: I don't know. The less we talk about those guys, the better, to be honest. That episode is all they get. We're done with that. ETH is at 22, 50 today, bitcoins at 44. It looks like it's going to stay there, or at least stay above that. What are you, like, what have you been, like, looking at? Like, is there anything that, like, new that you.
00:03:42.310 - 00:04:06.050, Speaker B: I don't know. I've been adding, like, more. More, like, leaders to my watch list. I haven't been adding any of them, but I've just been watching them a little bit closely because stuff like. Like Tao prime, like, I don't know, like, actually, the tweet that I put out today, pretty much the stuff that's on that list.
00:04:07.750 - 00:04:13.062, Speaker A: You want to share screen. I don't think I saw the tweet that you put out today. Oh, well, I saw the one where.
00:04:13.086 - 00:04:23.094, Speaker B: I was list the names on it. It was just, like, leaders in different categories. I put Pendle on there, which is pretty biased, I'm not going to lie. I don't know that Pendle is necessarily a leader right now.
00:04:23.262 - 00:04:29.770, Speaker A: I saw put a thread, like, an RWA thread for. For Pendle.
00:04:30.630 - 00:04:33.370, Speaker B: How do you see rain and that RWA stuff?
00:04:34.630 - 00:04:41.846, Speaker A: Yeah, well, like, many people signifying it or categorizing as an RWA project, which is interesting to see.
00:04:42.038 - 00:04:53.030, Speaker B: It's one of those things that, like, you can kind of apply to a lot of, like, people, like, talked about it as project a lot. Uh, yeah.
00:04:53.490 - 00:04:54.442, Speaker A: What's that about?
00:04:54.546 - 00:04:55.602, Speaker B: I think it's dumb.
00:04:55.746 - 00:04:58.630, Speaker A: I don't have a feeling yet, but I kind of like it.
00:05:00.050 - 00:05:38.498, Speaker B: It's just like. I don't know. The only. The only, like, I saw this one graphic from. I don't remember which, but some RWA projects docs, which was, like, um. Normally, like, in defi, the yield you get on a token is, like, all defi, which is, like, lending and borrowing rates or, like, fees from LP ing. That's, like, where all the yield comes from, versus, like, having natively yielding assets, like, rwas, like, t bills, you can, like, kind of fill that gap a little bit, and then the defi yield goes on top of that.
00:05:38.498 - 00:06:25.558, Speaker B: So, like, you take, like, I don't know, like, SDI or something, which natively yields 4%, and then you can get another 2% for lending it out or another 15% for lp ing it with eth or something. Thats cool. I think it creates more sustainable yields, I think. But I dont think people really care about sustainable yields in the bull market. People care about Ponzis and, you know, quintuple digit yield. I mean if RW, RWA, if it happens this cycle, it's just going to be a product of like VC's and Kols pumping it, which is like probably the way it's.
00:06:25.614 - 00:06:32.982, Speaker A: What do you categorize? What? That's everything. But what do you categorize as like an RWA project? When I hear RWA, I just think of like, it's.
00:06:33.006 - 00:06:34.558, Speaker B: It's pretty broad, honestly.
00:06:34.614 - 00:06:43.464, Speaker A: Like, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like what, what, what category do you hate within RWA thing? He is a strong word, but like, you know what I mean?
00:06:43.592 - 00:06:46.848, Speaker B: Well, I don't like, I like the T bill stuff.
00:06:46.984 - 00:06:51.072, Speaker A: I think that stuff is cool and it can be.
00:06:51.096 - 00:06:57.416, Speaker B: I think that's good for institutions. I wouldn't. I don't have any reason to use it myself, but I think it's, it's a good way to get institutions.
00:06:57.448 - 00:07:02.352, Speaker A: I think it could be a base, a good base for like Ponzi's right.
00:07:02.416 - 00:07:20.650, Speaker B: I know. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think that's. I think that turn it into a posse. I think that, like, the government based rwas, like t bills are like, like some basket of goods is going to be. Is going to be won by the compliant people.
00:07:20.650 - 00:07:58.668, Speaker B: So it's going to be won by like Ando and Bakt. Because Ondo, you have to like jump through like seven different hoops and like, undergo like, like an anal cavity search of a kyc to even like, hold the tokenization. I think that's going to do well because one big fund with some hundred billions in Aum is going to come and put 3% of their portfolio into on chain treasuries. And that's going to five x to tbl, just like that. But what I don't like are apps.
00:07:58.684 - 00:08:09.596, Speaker A: Like Ondo permissionless enough for some, like a non dev psychopath to build something like, no, there's like no way to access.
00:08:09.708 - 00:08:33.794, Speaker B: There's. There's some interesting loopholes that Ondo doesn't allow, but backed does allow. So Ondo is like all the way on like the far side of the spectrum. And Bakkt is like, like a little bit closer if like, this is like permissioned and this. I don't have a lot of this is permissioned and this is permissionless. Ondo is right here as permissions it can be. And Bakkt is a little bit closer.
00:08:33.794 - 00:09:08.008, Speaker B: For example, there's a project that allows. Bakkt is a market maker of tokenized T bills. Basically same thing. You can only buy them if it's permissioned in certain ways. But there's a project that has a smart contract which serves as an intermediary that's managed by a KYC fund. A Kyc fund. They, they purchase the assets from Bakkt and then they essentially lend it out to anyone.
00:09:08.008 - 00:09:18.420, Speaker B: So there's like a layer of separation kind of. Ondo wouldn't allow that because to even hold the asset, you have to prove something. Yeah.
00:09:19.280 - 00:09:28.218, Speaker A: Is in the chat saying that the like, t bill stuff is a pretty good point. It's like good for non us residents who don't normally.
00:09:28.274 - 00:09:29.070, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:09:29.370 - 00:09:30.298, Speaker A: Access to that.
00:09:30.394 - 00:09:31.790, Speaker B: Where are you seeing the chat?
00:09:32.170 - 00:09:34.274, Speaker A: You can't see the comments on the right hand side.
00:09:34.362 - 00:09:36.610, Speaker B: Oh, shit, we have comments. Oh, it's good. Watch.
00:09:36.690 - 00:09:37.390, Speaker A: I mean.
00:09:39.370 - 00:10:51.148, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. I think what I don't like about, about RWAs is the other stuff specifically, like the NFT guys trying to push it as a narrative because no one NFT, like, like, it's cool. It's cool that you can, like, don't get me wrong, I love the NFT fi space. Like, I love plenty of people in it and plenty of builders in it, but like, like, to think that people are going to come and borrow against their watches or their cars or their home in any meaningful capacity when it truly is not permissionless in any way and like a meaningful amount is just like you're just kind of spreading hopium, to be honest. Like, you can't. You like putting a physical asset like that on chain when some, some, like something that, like big that some third party has to custody and because like, like, if you think about like Maple finance, they kind of tried to do it but on a different scale with like small businesses, basically. And they had this whole thing happen where like some like motorcycle business who took out a Maple loan wasn't able to pay back the loan.
00:10:51.148 - 00:10:59.360, Speaker B: So now what do they do? They have to. They, like, someone from Maple or whoever they're like custody is. Has to go and like repossess those motorcycles.
00:11:01.100 - 00:11:28.186, Speaker A: That's the thing. Like, yeah, like in the Land X thing. Like, I was looking at that, that chart, I. And it's just one arrow for like between on chain us, DC and like people doing agricultural, physical labor. And, like, that's more than one arrow. There's, there's so much going on there and that's gonna be the entire, like, point of failure. And I don't know, people.
00:11:28.186 - 00:11:38.280, Speaker A: That's all like, like, but did you see, that's the same thing that happened with, oh, my God, what's his name? DCF. God is like, trying to bet on the repeg there.
00:11:38.940 - 00:11:41.548, Speaker B: Oh, was it Ave?
00:11:41.724 - 00:12:13.670, Speaker A: No, that actually repeats, like, oh, tangible, tangible, tangible. Yes. They were doing the real estate shit. And the whole problem happens when, when there's no, some difference between liquidity, insolvency and, and all those things. And, like, they had no ability. Once people started pooling funds from the pool, they couldn't sell the houses fast enough to keep the thing pegged. So inevitably, like, if they actually do have the assets, they actually do have the houses.
00:12:13.670 - 00:12:27.832, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, it'll get, like, repegged, but, like, there's so much going on between the house and the chain that, like, that's, that's the only thing that bugs me about the whole RwA thing. It's like, it's just a lot of.
00:12:27.976 - 00:13:09.658, Speaker B: Like the, like, all the things that can go wrong with intermediaries are bound to go wrong there, I think. Yeah. Which is like, like when you're dealing with that plus smart contract risk, plus, like, plus all the stuff that goes along with DeFi, like front end risk, smart contract risk, accidentally, like typing the wrong character in a wallet address. Like, you're just, you, you're, you're getting the, like the worst of both worlds really, in exchange for, like, you know, a very small subset of people being able to lend and borrow against, against their watches or whatever. Um, I will say that I would trade, I would totally trade the price of like, Rolex or something on chain.
00:13:09.794 - 00:13:10.882, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:13:10.946 - 00:13:32.326, Speaker B: Like, that would be fun, I think. But you don't need, you don't need physically physical backing to do that. Like, I would be perfectly comfortable doing that on a VMM if it was structured the right way, like a VMM backed with some sort of like, synthetic infrastructure. I would rather do that than have to have pretty cool backing.
00:13:32.358 - 00:13:35.090, Speaker A: It'd be crazy to see what the oracle for that would look like.
00:13:35.990 - 00:13:38.118, Speaker B: I would love to see that Rolex.
00:13:38.174 - 00:13:40.670, Speaker A: Store or like Rolex website or like.
00:13:40.710 - 00:14:21.648, Speaker B: Some, some, yeah, some major, like, provider. I would love to see, like the Bitcoin Rolex chart, like, how closely correlated those two are. Can chain link not bring the oracle? Yeah, I mean, Chainlink. Chainlink can do a lot, like, the challenges. The challenge is, like, finding market makers for something like that and just, like, figuring out what the right, like, system is. Because historically, the only way to trade, like, Oracle backed assets on chain is, like, with a VMM of a VMM of some kind. And that's never really worked.
00:14:21.648 - 00:14:43.532, Speaker B: Like, you end up with, like, skewed funding rates that eventually get taken on by the, by the protocol and all sorts of problems. So, like, it's. It's not quite there yet, but I think people are making. People are making good improvements in the VMM space. So, uh, while they will probably continue to blow up, I hope that they.
00:14:43.556 - 00:15:11.272, Speaker A: Won'T after a while, I I want to give you the. The opportunity to give everyone, you know, I want you to have your, your victory left. I know you don't want this, but I think it's honestly pretty, pretty well deserved. Give us the. Give us the initial story to kind of where you're at now with the tweet you put out. The Solana. Yeah.
00:15:11.272 - 00:15:45.200, Speaker A: What? Because you were. I remember that phone call very vividly. Like, it was the one where you were saying, like, yeah, I'm just going to keep buying a bunch of, bunch of Solana. Like, I'm just going to keep, like, DCA or something in this, Lana. And I was just, like, dunking on you a bit, but also, like, trying to understand, like, the, the. The play, and then you made that, that mad lads play and just like, you know, fuck it, I'm just gonna have this exposure. But, yeah, what was the, what was this thought process? How much faith did you actually have?
00:15:47.860 - 00:15:49.788, Speaker B: I I mean, take us through that.
00:15:49.884 - 00:15:51.476, Speaker A: That Ali conviction.
00:15:51.668 - 00:16:20.292, Speaker B: I think the faith I had in Solana was. It was less. It wasn't on the level of, like, the same people you see, like, the Solana boys on Twitter or, like, Ansem. It was more so just, like, it was very clear that people were throwing the baby out with the bath water after a while. Like, people were saying, like, oh, the community doesn't matter. Oh, the chain goes down. The chain goes down every five minutes.
00:16:20.292 - 00:16:37.020, Speaker B: Like, oh, it was just an SPF chain. It literally took maybe 30 to 45 minutes of research at any given point between now and, like, the start of the year to see how false all of those things were or just how, like, misconstrued they were.
00:16:37.440 - 00:16:41.408, Speaker A: But what, those are false, right? Like, I want to pick on the chain.
00:16:41.464 - 00:16:42.140, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:43.680 - 00:16:47.752, Speaker A: Yeah, the SPF chain. Like, throw that out. Like, I don't, I don't care about that, but just.
00:16:47.816 - 00:16:50.170, Speaker B: But let's answer it.
00:16:50.320 - 00:16:58.078, Speaker A: Community being a thing for a chain is, like, just very dumb to me. I just don't understand.
00:16:58.214 - 00:17:41.574, Speaker B: Did you see Cardano? Did you see tower right now? You like, it matters. It matters. And the thing is, it relates back to the SPF chain thing because people thought it was just. It was just low float, pump and dumps, which it was. But then if you go and see at the start of 2023 what teams are building on there, what they're building, how they're thinking about things, it's pretty clear that there's, like, genuinely, like, earnest, like, integras, builders who have been, like, who have either been here since before SBF and stuck around, or who have come in after. When you combine that with people who, like, genuinely care about what the chain.
00:17:41.742 - 00:18:23.180, Speaker A: What'S the thing that makes a difference for you? Right? Like, there's, like, at one point, people thought the Luna guy was, like, had some integrity and was, like, legit. Maybe not people who were smart, but, you know, there was, like, a good majority who kind of thought that about this person. People thought that about, like, Daniel Sesta. Like, what's the difference? Not technically, but in terms of, like, just like, the. What's the word? Like, what is the difference in thesis between Solana and Avalanche? There's a community on avalanche. There are people building on avalanche. Yes, it's a whole different, like.
00:18:23.180 - 00:18:52.672, Speaker A: Like, vm. Like, Solana is actually more than just like, a fork of the EVM with different subnets. But you know what I mean. When people say community, it's like, every chain has a community. Like, what. At what point does it get big enough? Or like, yeah, at what point does it get, like, what point does the community make a difference to you? Because you could tweet out the ticker, like, sweet, and have, like, 20 people in your DM's, or, like, 20 people.
00:18:52.856 - 00:19:09.436, Speaker B: Sweet is not like that, actually. Like, okay, well, I know what you mean, though. Like, say, yeah, like, whatever. Yeah. An exception, though. They don't have, like, an actual proper community, but I know what you mean. And I think there's two possible answers.
00:19:09.436 - 00:19:22.724, Speaker B: Like, one is, like, kind of a cop out and saying, it's just like, a vibe. It's just a vibe. And when you look at what's being built there, it makes a difference. Like, when you look at what was.
00:19:22.772 - 00:19:33.020, Speaker A: Being built at Solana, like, when people were saying, the community is so big and there's, like, stuff to do, I legit. Couldn't name on chain order books, drift.
00:19:33.060 - 00:19:45.060, Speaker B: V two order book based lending and NFT an NFT community that rivals eth or that rivaled ETH at one point. The best NFT marketplace in crypto.
00:19:46.040 - 00:19:53.192, Speaker A: I'm talking about when you made the initial, like, the initial thing, all that stuff.
00:19:53.216 - 00:19:58.408, Speaker B: Some of those apps weren't live, they were being built. I didn't know about all of them. I knew. I've always.
00:19:58.464 - 00:19:59.838, Speaker A: Which one did you know about that?
00:19:59.944 - 00:20:27.114, Speaker B: I've always believed that tensor is the best NFT marketplace in crypto. I knew about drift back then. I knew that Solana was pretty much the only place that you could try to have an on chain order book. And that still hasn't happened yet. It's happening right now, and people are kind of overlooking it, I think, because they're not really marketing, but, yeah, a little bit of, like, there's nothing to show there, but I think it's important.
00:20:27.162 - 00:20:29.252, Speaker A: To keep an eye building an on chain order book.
00:20:29.426 - 00:20:38.232, Speaker B: Phoenix, they're still, they're not really, like, super loud yet, but they process, like, a third of all transactions through Jupyter, which is pretty cool.
00:20:38.416 - 00:20:47.968, Speaker A: Explain why this is a bit of a tangent, but explain why we would need an on chain order book. It's just like, why should.
00:20:48.024 - 00:21:19.680, Speaker B: It's just more ethos aligns maker. It's. It's just more ethos aligned than the off chain models with on chain settlement. It's feasible on Solana versus anywhere else. Maybe it'll be feasible on, like, an l three someday, but we're definitely not there yet. I think it's very easy to sell to crypto natives. I think that when you consider stuff, like, intense, it gets a little bit murky as to, like, how it would specifically be, like, useful or better.
00:21:19.680 - 00:22:44.348, Speaker B: But if you could operate an on chain order book and you could have someone like elixir making, making liquidity on the same xy equals k curve, to tap into those, to tap into those maker rewards, you would have, like, you know, in theory, you would have insane liquidity or liquidity on par with off chain order books, but in a more decentralized way. Um, so that means no more of those. Of those DyDX or price manipulations or GMX, Oracle price manipulations. You would have incentives still going towards users with the elixir integration, and it's just easier to sell to crypto natives. I think the reasons to hate amms are very valid, but when people like Aori throw the whole thing out, I think that it, like, we have to at least try to maintain some semblance of decentralization. I think even if, even if, like, it's the harder and more difficult route, I think, I respect, I really respect builders who are doing stuff like that. And I think that if we don't keep trying to push that forward, um, you know, we're just going to end up making, we're going to end up making trade offs that, in the long run, end up hurting us.
00:22:44.348 - 00:22:56.734, Speaker B: Have you been seeing those Coinbase ads? Dude, those are so fire. And that's exactly where this is. Like, dude, I should show that to my fan. That those are like, those are, by.
00:22:56.742 - 00:23:01.334, Speaker A: The time I got to the end of the coinbase logo, like, pops up, she's like, fuck that shit.
00:23:01.382 - 00:23:04.622, Speaker B: Like, dude, I like, I love the, I love that campaign.
00:23:04.686 - 00:23:07.490, Speaker A: I thought it was great. Like, they did a great job.
00:23:07.990 - 00:23:43.758, Speaker B: Yeah, but, like, that's a good, that's like, you know, that's a good example. If we're making trade offs to, to be more centralized or more permissioned in the name of speed or efficiency, that's fine. Like, we should explore both routes. But there's a reason why we're all doing this. Whether or at least there's a reason why a lot of people are doing this. I think obviously a lot of people here are just for the money and, or maybe they want to act like they're here for the decentralization, but they're really not. But I don't know, it's, it's important to me.
00:23:43.758 - 00:23:50.918, Speaker B: At the end of the day, I also want to say, like I've said.
00:23:51.094 - 00:24:37.564, Speaker A: Sort of want to say I did. The irony of, like, caring about decentralization and then being on Solana, like, pretty. Yeah, I think, like, Solana isn't enough yet, right? So, like, for the decentralization focused people, building an on chain order book be, it is like a good achievement, but doing it on Solana kind of puts you in the similar, like, in a similar space. Like, like, you're not really that decentralized, in my opinion. Wait, the same can be said about, like, l two s and stuff, but.
00:24:37.612 - 00:25:01.016, Speaker B: It'S just, I think it's just hard to decentralize systems. Like, you can't. Like, Solana's made great progress. Like, no one can say that they're not trying to get there. It's like, it's not an easy thing to do. It takes time, especially for, like, a general purpose computer like that. It's, it takes time.
00:25:01.016 - 00:25:11.168, Speaker B: So, like, you know, people make all these comparisons between Solana and Eth. Solana has been around for what, like, five years? Four or five years. And ETH has been around for a decade now.
00:25:11.304 - 00:25:41.722, Speaker A: I asked this question. Yeah, but Defi has only been alive for, like, three years. But I will say, like, this question I have is, like, if you had a billion, like, if you put all your net worth. I mean, we basically put all of our net worth on chain, but let's just say, like, you. Yeah, you put all of your net worth on chain. You have, like, daily activities that all relate back to the chain. You go grocery shopping, you spend money from on chain.
00:25:41.722 - 00:26:07.116, Speaker A: You pay your rent on chain, your electricity bill, everything. Can you sleep at night with all your money on Solana? That's how I understand decentralization. And to me, like, I'm just not there yet. I'm just not there yet. That's my coefficient for decentralization coefficient.
00:26:07.308 - 00:26:31.604, Speaker B: I feel uncomfortable sometimes about having my money on ETH because I know when the time comes that I need to move it, I'll have to pay 20, $40 to do so. So I just, like, put that off. I just don't do it. Um, I'm, like, scared to take profits sometimes, or not scared, but, like, I don't want to because I, you know, I would rather just sell all in one go and pay gas only once.
00:26:31.732 - 00:26:41.124, Speaker A: Yeah, but in my mind, in my mind, like, uh, the ETh ecosystem is better for that decentralization. I'm not gonna, like, we're not gonna do this.
00:26:41.212 - 00:26:49.430, Speaker B: No, no, no. Don't say eth ecosystem. Say eth because you're not comfortable. No, because money on arbitrum, where they can forget to refill the gas on the sequencer.
00:26:49.580 - 00:27:01.018, Speaker A: Yes. No, I'm not. But would I be comfortable, like, taking 10% and putting it on arbitrum for, like, my grocery shopping every week, so.
00:27:01.034 - 00:27:04.202, Speaker B: I don't have you be comfortable doing that on Solana. Would you be comfortable?
00:27:04.266 - 00:27:20.132, Speaker A: No, but there's nowhere that you have to keep all of it somewhere, and you have to stay in your ecosystem. I mean, it's a dumb take, I'll be honest. It's a dumb take because, like, if you're bridging just fucking bridge to Solana for your daily transactions, if that's the.
00:27:20.156 - 00:27:41.004, Speaker B: Case, and keep your most word happen to your grocery store example, it's more. It's most likely that payments happen on Solana versus anywhere else. As of right now, at least there could be an l three that makes it happen. But as of right now, I also want to say I'm not that. I'm not, like, pro pro Solana, you know, like, I, like, don't.
00:27:41.052 - 00:27:41.676, Speaker A: All your money.
00:27:41.748 - 00:27:45.840, Speaker B: Would you keep all your money on Tara? I tried to. Yeah.
00:27:47.600 - 00:27:48.820, Speaker A: We tried to.
00:27:50.520 - 00:28:10.784, Speaker B: But. Yeah, no, I'm. I still acknowledge, like, the issues with the ecosystem and, like, the shortcomings still. I like to. I like to dunk on both and I like to support both as I choose to. It's funny because I have, like, Solana Bros. Like, bro, just try out the chain.
00:28:10.784 - 00:28:25.946, Speaker B: Like, you'll notice the difference. And it's like, dude, I've. I've probably been on Solana, like, longer than. Than you've been, like, out of high school. Like, people don't realize. I was, like, I first bought Solana, like, $4. I was, like, onboarded by the thing.
00:28:25.946 - 00:28:30.950, Speaker B: So, like, it's just me if I think I'm qualified to speak on it, you know?
00:28:31.370 - 00:28:42.168, Speaker A: I just don't see the difference, to be honest with. What, like, to me, that's why you got the Sol Luna Avax trade, because they're all basically the same thing.
00:28:42.224 - 00:28:43.152, Speaker B: Two of them.
00:28:43.336 - 00:29:00.288, Speaker A: It's like, it's like the. It's all basically the same, like, thesis. And if all of. If the thesis. Because they're not. Even if you look at payments right now, yeah, they could transform payments in the future. But if you look at payments right now, like you said, it's Tron right now.
00:29:00.288 - 00:29:40.478, Speaker A: So you're not the cheapest for payments yet. Maybe the thesis is that the. They're going to be, or, you know, there's like. But I also saw that when there was, like, some mint or something happened recently, like, the chain, like, shit itself and gas fees went super high. It could be like, some Eve maxi post, but yeah, it's just like, the idea of, like, just cheaper fees or cheaper gas, cheaper transactions, I think, doesn't get. Doesn't get you far. It's not a big enough, like, mo, in my opinion.
00:29:40.478 - 00:29:51.798, Speaker A: And then it's just gonna have to boil down to apps and, like, drift is cool. And maybe I overlook that because I'm not the biggest trader. I didn't really see apps on Solana.
00:29:51.894 - 00:30:05.890, Speaker B: You're not looking hard. There's nothing. Okay. There's not that much that's ready yet. But there's enough potential going on, especially when you compare it to something like Zksync or like Starknet or really anywhere except for arbitrum. Let's be honest.
00:30:07.030 - 00:30:11.614, Speaker A: In my mind, you could build anything. You could build on Solana. Just build it on avalanche.
00:30:11.662 - 00:30:11.942, Speaker B: But it's.
00:30:11.966 - 00:30:23.710, Speaker A: Being there was alive. You could. Yeah, but, like, if you're saying, like, you have to look on Solana to find those things. If I looked at Avax, I'd see the same things.
00:30:23.830 - 00:30:28.632, Speaker B: No, no, because look.
00:30:28.696 - 00:30:30.960, Speaker A: Activity. But, like, the stuff that's gained.
00:30:31.040 - 00:30:39.120, Speaker B: The stuff that's gained traction or, like, made news on a backs over the past year is not, like, you'll see Kaylee O. Like, shilling.
00:30:39.280 - 00:30:41.736, Speaker A: And that is so disappointing.
00:30:41.888 - 00:30:48.400, Speaker B: That was. That made me so sad. I'm not gonna lie. I actually used to doing it. I'm still doing it.
00:30:48.520 - 00:31:03.554, Speaker A: Like, I don't think it stars arena, but I recently, like, I think last week, saw some random Avax project to be shelling. Super disappointing. Anyway. Yeah, I mean, I'll just bury the hatchet on the Solana.
00:31:03.642 - 00:31:04.066, Speaker B: Let's.
00:31:04.138 - 00:31:06.270, Speaker A: I just still don't see the thesis.
00:31:07.810 - 00:31:11.170, Speaker B: Let's. Well, we'll. We'll put a pin in that for now.
00:31:11.250 - 00:31:12.466, Speaker A: I think I'm just copy.
00:31:12.538 - 00:31:42.900, Speaker B: Also, I will say. I will say that everybody who's, like, everybody who's, like, victory lapping right now, like, I don't think it's fair to be doing so because. And I think, like, either Mer totally said this. Said this, too. Victory lapping off of, like, price appreciation is, like, a pretty, like, low consciousness thing to do when you were. When you were shilling the tech and the ecosystem and the builders. Like, just because price three x's doesn't make the tech any better.
00:31:42.900 - 00:32:10.868, Speaker B: Like, I know it's a meme that it does, but it really doesn't. So, like, you can victory lap when your theses actually, like, start to be true? It's on the right track, sure. But, like, you know, don't. Don't. Don't shill it as if you're, like, a builder or, like, a visionary who sees. Who sees potential, and then victory lap, like, a trader, when the price goes up, that's, you know, it doesn't make.
00:32:10.884 - 00:32:16.170, Speaker A: Sense to me, but I'd definitely be victory laughing if it was me.
00:32:16.830 - 00:32:20.406, Speaker B: I. I've done a little bit. I'm not gonna lie.
00:32:20.518 - 00:32:22.450, Speaker A: A little. I think everyone.
00:32:23.470 - 00:32:26.190, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:32:26.310 - 00:32:42.860, Speaker A: So, like, last thing on this. Last thing on this. Are you. Are you. Do you have any of the same conviction you previously had in Solana in any of these other l ones? Maybe the newer, shiny ones?
00:32:45.160 - 00:32:51.424, Speaker B: No, no, I mean, I like the. As, like, a trade? Yes. Yeah, as, like.
00:32:51.472 - 00:33:11.250, Speaker A: No, I'm talking about, like, the same thing or similar thing you saw in Solana in terms of, like, these. These different layers of community, you know, actual protocol building. Like, building protocols that are, like, actually different than where they are at the EBM or wherever else.
00:33:12.150 - 00:33:16.590, Speaker B: I think I got lucky with Solana in the sense that because I was first.
00:33:16.710 - 00:33:18.254, Speaker A: No, I'll give it to you.
00:33:18.422 - 00:33:45.776, Speaker B: No, no, no, let me explain. Let me explain. Yeah, let me explain. I was lucky because I was exposed to it so early, so I was able to watch its, like, development fall and then, like, rise again. I always, like, kind of had the ecosystem on my radar in a way that I don't with other chains. So I was able to come to a more complete conclusion. Like, I also, I had this.
00:33:45.776 - 00:34:18.452, Speaker B: I would say I've had the same coverage of, or similar coverage of, like, cosmos, too, but I haven't, I haven't seen the same, like, reasons to be, to be bullish in, like, the medium term there as I have for Solana. So it's hard for me to say whether, like, whether like, swe or apdos or, like, say, or, you know, one of those other ones are going to be successful because I haven't been around any of them long enough and I haven't taken a close enough look at the ecosystem.
00:34:18.596 - 00:34:20.840, Speaker A: Where would you go if you wanted to take a look?
00:34:21.620 - 00:34:31.166, Speaker B: No, just like, their ecosystem website. I did that would say, not long ago. And it was all right to do that.
00:34:31.198 - 00:34:34.710, Speaker A: On the many lists of, like, l one s that are out there right now.
00:34:34.870 - 00:35:02.241, Speaker B: Nothing else special. I think. I think all of those l ones are still new enough. That ecosystem, I don't know that ecosystem matters that much yet. It's more so trying to show, like, the tech, the infrastructure value prop. Um, which is why, like, the, say, the recent, say, like, EvM edition was pretty big news. Um, I don't know how important ecosystem is at this stage.
00:35:02.241 - 00:35:26.430, Speaker B: I know there's like, there were, like, some stable coins building on Apdos and swe that got really good backing when they were first coming out. And they had, um, they had tons of vc backing and just, like, hype at the time, but they were just, you know, like, makerdao forks. So in terms of apps there, I don't, I don't know. I don't think so.
00:35:28.810 - 00:35:41.042, Speaker A: You think? Actually, let me not ask the question. Part of me still thinks Solana will never reach all time highs and could fade into a level of.
00:35:41.186 - 00:35:46.048, Speaker B: That's a good question. I think that that's a. I want.
00:35:46.064 - 00:37:32.000, Speaker A: To ask the question less about price and more about, like, you know, because in my mind, there's a level of, like, Solana that could just be like an EOS or like some crazy old thing that used to be revolutionary has like multiple cycles, follows the trend in general, gets the attention, but like inevitably doesn't do anything. I'm not saying Solana doesn't do anything, but I think you get my point of like is there are the moats that are driving them to where they are at now strong enough to keep them alive. Like in the, in the long term, what is the, what is the big brain long term outlook look like? Because honestly, have we gone that far? Like how long have me and you been doing this of shit? Like been talking about this stuff for a year now on this podcast almost. And like even before then we were discussing stuff like privately before then. And I feel like I've, like both of us have learned a lot personally, but like, where, where do you think we've gotten? How far have we gotten as like an ecosystem? Because I remember you were one of the first people to really be like, you know, there aren't any winners yet. And at that time I was very much like, Eth has won kind of person like early on and that was part of your thesis of like, you know, there hasn't even been a winner yet. Like Solana provides a different alternative and could end up as a winner in like some aspects of.
00:37:32.330 - 00:37:34.650, Speaker B: What question can you ask me?
00:37:34.810 - 00:37:43.874, Speaker A: Like how far along are we as a market from when you first observe it? Like, do you think we made any like decent progress and what progress?
00:37:43.922 - 00:39:02.410, Speaker B: Yeah, forward to seeing, yeah, I like seeing stuff like, like helium offering cell phone plans or like, I'm trying to think of a good example on Ethan or Coinbase offering one click payments or sending crypto with a link. I like the marketing stuff they're doing. I think that 100% also contributes to growth. I think we've been making progress, but the thing is for who we are, but it's hard to do so because people like to gamble. People like just want to make money, which is fine. That's a core use case of crypto too. But the thing is, when you combine the hyper financialized nature of what we're doing with just the nature of people, you're going to end up with an ecosystem that's like a vast, that's just vastly like, you know, money grabbing and pushing back against that is difficult to do, I think.
00:39:02.410 - 00:39:28.960, Speaker B: Or just building something that is like independent of that is also difficult to do. And it's what a vast minority of people are doing. I don't know, I think I. Yeah, I think we're making progress. I think we've obviously been making progress for a while, but I think it's a. It's a lot longer journey than people are expecting it to be. Like, what do you.
00:39:28.960 - 00:39:37.584, Speaker B: Like, what do you think crypto looks like in 2025? Like, at the end of 2025, two years from now? Like, what's different?
00:39:37.672 - 00:40:13.070, Speaker A: I've more and more. I've more and more thought that there will be, like, minor improvements to the technology. Like, yeah, minor improvements to technology, but, yeah, I think, like, looking back on it, I feel like we're in the same Ponzi we were when we, like, first joined, like, crypto, to be honest. Like, it's. It's. Yeah, it's pretty much the same fucking Ponzi, and I honestly don't think it's going to change. Whether or not that's a good thing is a different story.
00:40:13.070 - 00:41:02.920, Speaker A: I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I think one thing that I like about the hyper financialization of crypto is, like, small problems get solved quickly in a way. Like, I think the smaller stuff gets solved pretty quickly, but the bigger things just take forever because people are so distracted by the financialization aspect of. So it's like, we're chipping away at the problem, but we're not making, like, any significant, like, strikes to the. To the boulder, and it's, like, kind of frustrating. Like, we'll, like, be chipping for a whole year, and then number goes up and everyone puts, like, the pickaxe down and. And starts staring up into, like, at a rocket ship, you know what I mean? And then, like, it's like.
00:41:03.350 - 00:41:08.454, Speaker B: Or, like, SBM. Yeah, like, era happens and we get distractions.
00:41:08.582 - 00:41:22.582, Speaker A: Yeah, distractions in general. Like, I don't want to be, like, the armchair developer, but, like, wasn't, like, 484 for supposed to be out. Like. Like, there's been, like, delays and shit there.
00:41:22.686 - 00:41:45.090, Speaker B: Deadlines are hard in software. Yeah, I try not to. Try not to. It's. The thing is, is I think people use that as an excuse sometimes, or they will. Like, like, it's hard to discern when a team is just being lazy or not meeting their expectations versus just the usual process of, like, building. Building software.
00:41:45.090 - 00:41:52.930, Speaker B: But, like, I think it's. It's beneficial to give people the benefit of the doubt more often than not.
00:41:53.950 - 00:43:16.176, Speaker A: Yeah, I just think, like, the same major problems we had last cycle, we pretty much still have. And, like, nobody expects the next major problems. Like, you know, decentralizing a sequencer. Like, I was looking at that 365 days of threads that I was writing, and I was talking about, like, I think, like, verkle trees, like, being implemented in the ethereum and, like, the research going behind that. And, like, I just kind of forgot how, like, and maybe I'm not looking enough for it, but it's like, it feels like nothing has really come from that. And we've been talking about finding a way to lower gas fees for a while, and then we've also been talking about, it's like, different aspects of a lot of it where, like, I honestly expect very much for Solana to, like, hit a, hit a point where they begin to just, like, you know, go down a bunch. I think there were, like, fixes there, but I think the general genuine building and, like, fixing kind of has stopped as people just get distracted by price moving and they just like, oh, just let the chain run how it is and more people will come and it'll just shit itself again.
00:43:16.176 - 00:43:43.800, Speaker A: It's like the same thing. Like, people are just not putting enough attention into the. The progress that was supposed to be made. Like, when are we supposed to get decentralized sequencers? When are we, like, fraud proofs? Like, all of that. All of those things that were, like, promised so long ago just, like, feels. It feels like no progress is being made on any of them. Yeah, you see it in, like, cosmos with Adam, too.
00:43:43.800 - 00:44:01.344, Speaker A: They had such a head start in the app chain thesis, and they're the way their governance works and, like, how weird the people are there in terms of, like, financializing things. It seems like they're stuck in the same spot.
00:44:01.392 - 00:44:10.648, Speaker B: They were, like, last year, DXv four just launched. Akash is, I only think, all time highs on almost all metrics.
00:44:10.824 - 00:44:27.036, Speaker A: I only think is launched because they had to make that decision when they had no other options and they didn't want to pivot. Like, I think they had to sit down and really say, all right, we're going to commit to this, even though we're seeing, like, a million optimism. Chains go out.
00:44:27.068 - 00:44:31.040, Speaker B: Dy DX made this decision well before, like, opstack chains were.
00:44:31.700 - 00:44:32.660, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying.
00:44:32.780 - 00:44:33.804, Speaker B: They evaluated.
00:44:33.932 - 00:44:35.000, Speaker A: Stick to it.
00:44:35.500 - 00:45:13.316, Speaker B: But, but l two app chains were still a thing at the time. I mean, they were on an l two app chain. What? Like, I'm sure. I'm sure they knew the trade offs of going from being a stark x based app chain to some other software stack they evaluate. Because Antonio's talked about this a lot. When I was researching DydX, one of, like, the core questions I was trying to answer was, why? Like, why is v four on cosmos. Like, is that bearish for ethereum? And it's like, basically the decision was, it didn't have that much to do with like scalability or anything of that nature.
00:45:13.316 - 00:45:38.734, Speaker B: It was more so like the fact that, yeah, yeah, they needed to be, they needed something out of the box that they could set specific validator requirements on in a way that allowed them to further decentralize their, their like, existing model. How would you rate them in decentralization right now? Or, I mean, v three is like, v three is like, just like, no, v four.
00:45:38.782 - 00:45:40.730, Speaker A: Like what v four is supposed to be?
00:45:41.560 - 00:45:59.296, Speaker B: Well, in theory, from like reading about it, I think it's on par. No, I think it's a step further, a step closer to decentralized from other order book based Dexs on like l two s. So if you look at.
00:45:59.328 - 00:46:07.220, Speaker A: Like, if the equivalent of like a decentralized on chain order book.
00:46:07.730 - 00:46:08.470, Speaker B: No.
00:46:09.050 - 00:46:13.162, Speaker A: So it sits like more centralized than something like that.
00:46:13.346 - 00:46:48.156, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but no, it's less centralized than fully on chain, but it's more centralized than the other order book models we have on the EVM. So if you look at something like Rapidx or like hyper liquid, their order books are managed by either permission set of operators or at best, it's like market makers can come and run them if they'd like to, but it's not like an easy thing to do, obviously, and it's a distinct set. And for what dy Dx is supposed.
00:46:48.188 - 00:46:53.100, Speaker A: To be, I'm assuming. Yeah, like to run a validator.
00:46:53.260 - 00:47:36.310, Speaker B: Yeah, it's either that or it's just like a high barrier to entry. But for DYDX, given that the validator requirements themselves include running an order book, and that process itself is permissionless and anyone can delegate to those validators as well. And you can distribute stake more fairly, I definitely think it's a step in the right direction. I think it's like, as far as you can take an off chain order book to be decentralized without putting it on chain, at least that I know of right now. I can't think of any other way to go about doing that.
00:47:37.770 - 00:47:43.230, Speaker A: That pump tweet 17 days before the unlock for Dy DX was.
00:47:43.530 - 00:47:47.910, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that was, it's below like $3 now too.
00:47:48.450 - 00:47:49.830, Speaker A: That's pretty hilarious.
00:47:50.250 - 00:48:14.460, Speaker B: And I just like to remind everyone that lots of influencers shielded at the top there. And I literally, I literally said they're like, they know what they're doing here. I've been calling DyDX since below $2 now. Influencers are showing it. There's an unlock coming in like two weeks I'm out. Like, don't listen to these guys. And then ansem, like, replies to me.
00:48:14.460 - 00:48:29.258, Speaker B: He's like, bro, like, you didn't even call it a you. Like, he takes like two pictures completely out of contact. He's like, bro, like, you should have given an entry and an exit and all. Unlike journaled it contract ads like entry price UId X is under $3 now.
00:48:29.354 - 00:48:43.270, Speaker A: Leverage, you have to. The tweet can't be anything other than your, like, the exact contract address, entry, exit price, leverage amount. And. Yeah, that's funny.
00:48:43.640 - 00:48:46.780, Speaker B: It is what it is. It's just the way the industry works.
00:48:47.240 - 00:48:57.580, Speaker A: I'm glad, though. I'm glad I still get to at least have another chance, or at least more time to like copy your calls without anybody else.
00:48:58.240 - 00:49:21.088, Speaker B: I, dude, I should have been. If I was a bigger account and like, I didn't have morals, I would be fudding the shit out of dy DX right now. I'd be like, oh, price is down like 30%, volume on v four is at an all time low. And the unload. Speaking of that, all that is true, by the way, but it's taken out of context. It sounds bearish, even though it's not.
00:49:21.264 - 00:50:11.060, Speaker A: Speaking of that, I think the l two governance token discussion would be interesting. I think there's clear value prop in that. I don't know. I have a, I tweeted this out. I think like the kind of revenue or potential revenue or like guidance that's going to come from governance on these l two s is going to become significant and meaningful, like a lot quicker than people expect. And so I think like control with the, with these governance tokens is going, going to be pretty, pretty useful. You tend to think that it's hot garbage, or at least for now.
00:50:11.100 - 00:50:14.120, Speaker B: I don't think it's, I don't think it's as, I don't think it's.
00:50:15.020 - 00:50:27.484, Speaker A: And I do still think arbitrary is a good eth beta play. Maybe not yet. It's only been up, you know, people like to look at the chart. It's only been like, it hasn't been that long. Okay.
00:50:27.652 - 00:50:29.340, Speaker B: There's some discovery that seven, eight months.
00:50:29.380 - 00:50:37.420, Speaker A: I think there's some discovery that has to have. I don't know, I think they start aligning soon.
00:50:37.500 - 00:51:16.726, Speaker B: I think that in their current, in its current state, arbitrum has the same value prop as any Lt tokens. Yeah, I, that was actually like all of my arb was in GMx, um, and GMx v two. And they're like Gm pools. Um, and you know what I did? I sold it all for the Solana Gm pool when Solana was at like $30. So that. And, like, that had nothing to do with, like, me thinking that the pump would happen. It was more so just like, like my options.
00:51:16.726 - 00:51:32.976, Speaker B: I wanted to keep it on GMX because incentives were starting soon and the only options I was open to were, like, bitcoin eth and, like, solana. Like, I'm not going to buy bitcoin because I'm under the age of 70 and I have enough ethereum. So I was like, you know, let's just put in Solana. And they were earning high yield too.
00:51:33.088 - 00:51:49.442, Speaker A: Do you think arb ever? Because I know Starknet at one point was mentioning that they're going to have their token be used for gas fees. You think any of these l two start doing that to, like, provide a base level of value prop for themselves?
00:51:49.506 - 00:52:07.002, Speaker B: I mean, that's the nice thing about governance, is they can always happen. And it, like, if it happened, it hasn't happened anywhere yet. It hasn't happened on any l two yet. But if it happens on one and it works well for driving value to the token, it's like it's going to have a domino effect almost.
00:52:07.066 - 00:52:28.498, Speaker A: Why don't they do this dumb idea. Why don't they do like, like, holder incentives? Like, you know how, like, if you used to go on, you know, I never did this, but if you used to go on binance and you had, like, certain amount of BNB, you would get, like, less trading fees. Like, what if you, what if you. If you hold a certain amount of rv, you have less.
00:52:28.554 - 00:52:31.210, Speaker B: That's like sex tokens. It's the less gas fees.
00:52:31.290 - 00:52:35.618, Speaker A: Less gas fees? That'd be pretty hilarious.
00:52:35.714 - 00:52:36.762, Speaker B: That's kind of interesting.
00:52:36.866 - 00:52:37.442, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:52:37.506 - 00:52:41.590, Speaker B: But in theory, gas fees shouldn't matter. On our post. Post 4844, right?
00:52:42.990 - 00:52:47.410, Speaker A: Yeah, in theory. Whenever the fuck that happens.
00:52:47.710 - 00:52:49.330, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, the goal.
00:52:50.310 - 00:52:55.250, Speaker A: Do you think the l three s happen anytime soon to drive any of that value? Last. Last question.
00:52:57.510 - 00:53:31.812, Speaker B: Well, I don't think l three should happen unless they're purpose built. I think l three should be app chains and they should never be general purpose because then I like, what are we doing? But l three s as like, app chains, I think makes a lot of sense. Like, I'm excited to see RbX chain. What are some other ones? I think Unidex. Unidex is like Caldera or whatever it is. I think that's either. It's either an l two or an l three.
00:53:31.812 - 00:53:32.720, Speaker B: I can't remember.
00:53:34.430 - 00:53:36.290, Speaker A: Unidex guys are gonna be.
00:53:36.630 - 00:53:56.766, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't, I like Unidex. I don't know enough about them to be honest. I haven't really looked into them too, too deeply. And they've changed a lot since I first looked at them. When I first looked at them, they were kind of just a perps aggregator and now they're doing intense stuff and they have Caldera with celestia support and all this. Like, I just haven't looked into it.
00:53:56.958 - 00:54:01.224, Speaker A: Let's, let's do, let's do, do you remember we used to do like calls?
00:54:01.272 - 00:54:02.184, Speaker B: Calls of the week?
00:54:02.272 - 00:54:13.780, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do calls. See if we, if we kept doing calls of the week every week, we would have hit on, at least I would have hit on more of your calls.
00:54:17.120 - 00:54:21.780, Speaker B: Let's uh, let me, uh, let me share some shit. Why not, you know?
00:54:22.800 - 00:54:29.504, Speaker A: What do I got, dude? I got nothing. I feel like, I feel very washed. I'm working too much. Gotta stop working.
00:54:29.672 - 00:54:32.500, Speaker B: Look at some, some prices and see what's up.
00:54:32.800 - 00:54:39.208, Speaker A: We were very, I feel like I never even considered rabbit X token price when we had them on, but we.
00:54:39.224 - 00:54:42.544, Speaker B: Were actually very, I kind of just mid curved it. We were super early.
00:54:42.592 - 00:54:45.840, Speaker A: Yeah, but I just super fucking early to them.
00:54:46.000 - 00:54:46.384, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:46.432 - 00:54:51.086, Speaker A: Like now everyone and their fucking mother is biggest Rob deck supporter.
00:54:51.248 - 00:54:51.586, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:51.618 - 00:54:54.642, Speaker A: Do you want to add this crazy. Do you want to add, huh?
00:54:54.826 - 00:54:58.430, Speaker B: Do you want to, am I not sharing screen?
00:54:58.770 - 00:55:04.362, Speaker A: Oh, I gotta add it here. Yeah, I didn't know if you look.
00:55:04.386 - 00:55:05.830, Speaker B: At roll bit, dude.
00:55:06.130 - 00:55:07.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I looked at it as soon.
00:55:07.898 - 00:55:10.986, Speaker B: As we got these wicks, dude. My goodness.
00:55:11.138 - 00:55:16.758, Speaker A: I had a line that was like, you know, an imaginary line and it felt, it just fell below them.
00:55:16.834 - 00:55:31.478, Speaker B: My imaginary, I don't know, I don't know what's happening here. Like, like the longer this continues with a market like this, I just become more and more suspicious. Like you're like where there's smoke, there's fire.
00:55:31.534 - 00:55:37.590, Speaker A: You know, your microphone is like doing something where, hello? Yeah, no, you're good.
00:55:37.670 - 00:55:39.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I was touching something.
00:55:41.470 - 00:55:50.380, Speaker A: Yeah, no, this is pretty sad. I, oh, is this, whoa, we got, we got, uh, we got all these watch lists here on the right hand side. Are interested.
00:55:50.460 - 00:55:54.924, Speaker B: I, this isn't complete. I've been adding stuff to this like this week actually. Like I just added Tao, did you.
00:55:54.932 - 00:55:56.428, Speaker A: Get the premium for this?
00:55:56.604 - 00:55:58.040, Speaker B: I did get the premium.
00:55:58.460 - 00:55:59.228, Speaker A: Can you do anything.
00:55:59.284 - 00:56:14.280, Speaker B: Deal. I think I, I just set alerts because I obviously I can't do limit orders on chain, so it's, it's good to have alerts. Um, I bought some prime earlier at seven, which looks pretty good. Actually. Looks really good.
00:56:15.020 - 00:56:16.160, Speaker A: What looks good?
00:56:17.260 - 00:56:39.280, Speaker B: Well, just the fact that I caught the bottom of these wicks. I didn't buy enough, I guess. Dwodx. Let's take a look at this. What is prime? Yeah, it's like a gaming. It's like everybody's favorite gaming token right now. I think we should probably talk to.
00:56:43.000 - 00:56:45.504, Speaker A: We need to talk into our discord boy because.
00:56:45.592 - 00:56:46.008, Speaker B: Yeah, we do.
00:56:46.024 - 00:56:51.752, Speaker A: What's his name is super into, into gaming. And like gaming has been popping off. Ben. Yeah.
00:56:51.896 - 00:56:54.040, Speaker B: Yeah, he's probably been been eating.
00:56:54.200 - 00:57:00.540, Speaker A: Yeah, he's probably, he was super like into the gaming stuff for a while.
00:57:00.840 - 00:57:08.022, Speaker B: This is where you, this is where you bet the house, by the way. 2.25 ish. 2.23.
00:57:08.136 - 00:57:09.510, Speaker A: What chart is this? Daily?
00:57:09.930 - 00:57:10.750, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:11.570 - 00:57:14.270, Speaker A: Any lines we can draw. That's the only line.
00:57:16.410 - 00:57:33.162, Speaker B: You can also just buy it like regular. Regular, like emotional zones. Like $3.02 and a half. Two and a half looks pretty good actually. We should do something there too. What else would it give me? Give me a ticker.
00:57:33.162 - 00:57:34.186, Speaker B: What do you want to look at?
00:57:34.298 - 00:57:37.114, Speaker A: What. What's the call? What are the calls?
00:57:37.282 - 00:57:58.230, Speaker B: The calls. Um, well, I mean, I bought some dy DX here. I think it's a decent play or decent rr right now at least. Um, it could keep going down because metrics aren't crazy. I gotta jump in a second, by the way. Um, yeah, I'm still looking for a fucking entry on Tao. Where did I put that 220?
00:57:58.650 - 00:58:16.744, Speaker A: I caught the bottom on that Romilly though. But that's the, that was a nice one. I haven't had any, any real good trade since then. I do think I've done like prime though, to be honest. I don't want to be like super basic.
00:58:16.792 - 00:58:45.002, Speaker B: Yeah. But I think I actually have some puts on eth right now. So, you know, a little bit. Say I've, I've done really well trading. Say, um, I like, I bottom and sold the top like on two consecutive occasions. Um, I'm still not fully in, which makes me a little bit uncomfortable. But, um, I don't want to be buying here.
00:58:45.002 - 00:58:59.040, Speaker B: I think my average cost right now is like, I first bought at like 0.14, I think. Do you have any added some? No, dude, I wet, dude. I wish I never sold my airdrop.
00:58:59.780 - 00:59:02.480, Speaker A: I wish I actually fucking claimed lie.
00:59:04.140 - 00:59:13.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I had like two k Celestia and I sold it. I sold it at, you know, whatever it was.
00:59:13.788 - 00:59:22.354, Speaker A: I was lazy to do what I had to do to try and claim that. And I. And yeah, that sucks. Anyway, I think that.
00:59:22.402 - 00:59:23.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I got it.
00:59:23.130 - 00:59:25.070, Speaker A: Does it for this.
00:59:25.690 - 00:59:28.150, Speaker B: Don't want to keep my buddy waiting. I got to go soon.
00:59:28.610 - 00:59:29.234, Speaker A: All right.
00:59:29.322 - 00:59:29.906, Speaker B: All right.
00:59:30.018 - 00:59:36.058, Speaker A: That's episode 46. We're so back. Watch this fucking nuke we're going to do.
00:59:36.074 - 00:59:40.590, Speaker B: We got to do another solo episode like first week because that's our one year anniversary.
00:59:41.970 - 00:59:42.710, Speaker A: January.
00:59:43.210 - 00:59:43.990, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:44.290 - 01:00:03.530, Speaker A: I don't know who we're gonna have on next week. Somebody I DCF God. If DCF God is watching this, answer my fucking Dm. Other than that, I think we'll have to see next week who's coming up. All right, that's episode 46. Peace.
