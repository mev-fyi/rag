00:00:00.120 - 00:00:59.160, Speaker A: So if you're interested in buying options, we've actually just gone through audit on a, on a new order type that we support in our system that allows you to basically make a single order on the entire collection and that order will automatically compute a price for you every time it gets filled and just buy options on your behalf without you having to do those updates and without you having to have as much risk that you've like horribly mispriced something on the option writing side. So that's depositing NFT and creating a call option. So you have now instant liquidity for writing options and then also again abstracted away the pricing question by working to make sure that prices that are offered to those users and this is via our product are fair and it's in like a user friendly interface where you can select not exactly like what option terms do you want, but basically just like how much risk do you want? Which is an easier question for most people to answer.
