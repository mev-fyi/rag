00:08:52.750 - 00:08:55.130, Speaker A: All right. Morning, guys.
00:08:56.520 - 00:08:57.260, Speaker B: Morning.
00:08:58.320 - 00:09:03.580, Speaker A: I think we're all good. Everyone here at all right?
00:09:05.560 - 00:09:06.340, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:10.520 - 00:09:11.780, Speaker A: Cindy, are you there?
00:09:15.760 - 00:09:19.700, Speaker C: We can't hear you. I don't know if you can hear us, but see you talking.
00:09:24.890 - 00:09:27.146, Speaker B: Can you guys hear me? The floating z?
00:09:27.218 - 00:09:27.730, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:27.850 - 00:09:28.386, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:28.498 - 00:09:29.270, Speaker C: Okay.
00:09:30.570 - 00:09:31.710, Speaker A: How you been, man?
00:09:33.130 - 00:09:49.040, Speaker B: Good. I'm not sure if we've ever met or chatted before, but I've been watching. I watched some of your guys clips from the old episodes, so I hope ours can be, like, as good as those. I don't know. Have a natural combo.
00:09:50.500 - 00:09:52.400, Speaker A: Thanks, man. Appreciate that.
00:09:53.500 - 00:09:54.960, Speaker D: Can you guys hear me now?
00:09:55.460 - 00:10:19.382, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, perfect. All right, let's get rolling. So episode 33, we're doing our derivatives. For Djen season. We have on drift a text. Basically, you guys do a lot more than just perpetuals.
00:10:19.382 - 00:10:40.550, Speaker A: You guys have swaps, vaults, all kinds of things. Before we get there, could you give us each of your own intros? But we like to center those around your background and kind of lead into some moments where you guys were exit liquidity throughout your journey into crypto.
00:10:42.770 - 00:11:07.692, Speaker D: I love that. Yeah, I can get started. So my name is Cindy, one of the co founders of Drift. Been in crypto since around 2017. 2018 started off really just doing a bunch of trading in the space. I think that the kimchi premium arb was the trade that started it all. And maybe that was my exit liquidity moment.
00:11:07.692 - 00:12:18.340, Speaker D: Towards the end of the trade, where spreads kind of closed to, like, less than 10% post the 2017 era. Started a small prop shop where we were mainly trading off chain perps and still doing a bunch of funding trading posts. Doing that for about two years. Early 2021 was looking at the explosion of on chain options in the space and found it funny that there were so many builders building on chain options when Pertz was 100 x bigger market. So early 2021, we saw that Solana was also taking off, and the infrastructure on Solana seemed ripe for a derivatives product that nobody was really looking at at the time. So essentially built a team together with Z as one of my co founders to build drift. Initially, we started off as the virtual EMM in our V one, which launched in October November 2021.
00:12:18.340 - 00:13:11.270, Speaker D: But earlier this year, we launched a v two that has not just a virtual AmM, but also an order book just in time liquidity auction, as well as more improvements on the VMM. So we recently just launched drift liquidity provider DLP for short, which allows you to stake into the EMM and get the returns, get the return payoff of an EMM. So overall, we're now, the largest perp Dex in Solana, with the largest amount of users, comparable to EVM chains in terms of users and active users, which we're very excited about. And, yeah, really just looking to scale up the capacity, scale up the user growth and write the current way.
00:13:14.730 - 00:13:21.580, Speaker A: Awesome. And, Z, could you also go into maybe how you guys met as well along that journey?
00:13:23.440 - 00:13:59.902, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So I guess I met Cindy through a mutual friend before I was ever working in crypto. And, yeah, I just had a conversation with them and started learning more about Solana. Honestly, I've never, like, tried to build anything in crypto before this. I remember looking at solidity in, like, 2020 when we were all just sitting at home and I was just thinking, oh, this is seems like, kind of weird. It kind of reminded me of, like, building iPhone apps.
00:13:59.902 - 00:14:34.896, Speaker B: Like, you had to learn your whole, a whole separate language. And it wasn't like, I don't know, like, it wasn't, like, transferable. But then I heard Solana was writing in rust, and I was like, oh, rust, like, you can use that for lots of things. And I keep hearing all this good stuff about rust. So that just, I guess, kind of encouraged me to go down the rabbit hole there. And I guess since I've started to now, I feel a lot more confident in, like, building robust risk engines and smart contracts. It's kind of just a rite of passage that you have to go through as a developer.
00:14:34.896 - 00:15:16.060, Speaker B: Like, you need, you need a lot of time. You need to see, like, you know, a lot of use cases, and then you start to get a feel for the extent that problems can occur and, like, how to prevent them. And what level of, like, unit testing and fuzz testing do you need before you can, like, be reliably confident about something. So that's kind of been, I feel like that was my evolutionary arc since getting into crypto is just being super savvy on the risk protection side while not compromising all the, like, fun, useful, capital efficient features that people enjoy, too.
00:15:18.800 - 00:15:40.070, Speaker A: Awesome. And so I want to get into a bit about v one and kind of that history, but if you could just give us the, like, I'm five explanation of how drift works on the backend and why specifically something like this is you guys chose for it to be built on Solana.
00:15:45.690 - 00:16:55.110, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe I can talk through the evolution and then Z can talk through the why Solana backend in terms of the evolution. Initially, like we mentioned, we were built using virtual EMM and a lot of the features that users requested inching towards building and getting, like, centralized exchange experience from the VMM. So obviously, I think there's some issues with the VMM, like long short imbalance that we strive to solve, but ultimately, we believe that it would be better solved by having a robust liquidity mechanism that included more matching engine abilities, such as order bugs and the jet auction as well. And ultimately, we've seen the positive effects of this in v two, where liquidity is a lot deeper. We have multiple makers, we have multiple deposit mechanisms where you can provide liquidity. So it's a lot more robust, especially for more longer tail assets.
00:17:02.010 - 00:17:55.326, Speaker B: Yeah, and I guess the why Solana, or I think, I think we both alluded to why Solana. Like, when we initially started building for the project, like, we just saw it as it was, I guess, more comparable to the financial system that people are used to off chain. Like, you have much faster block times. There's ability to parallelize things with, like, the write and read locks on the account level. So if you're a savvy builder, like, you can build something that's really scalable and whatnot, assuming that the infrastructure is actually there. And then I guess over time, honestly, when we started building, the promise of Solana wasn't really working. You try to use rpcs, you try to get transactions through.
00:17:55.326 - 00:18:43.388, Speaker B: There would be a lot of problems back then, honestly, during the time that the token's price was the highest, ironically. And then right now, if you use Solana, I think a lot of the apps are much more mature. And it seems like a lot of the infrastructure at the validator level is also becoming more mature. And there's now, like, multiple different implementations coming out behind the scenes. Like, not really for not really, like, on the consumer facing side, but just, like, back end engineers, like, really, really pushing the network improvements there. So I think it definitely makes sense not to, like, hop. Lily pad.
00:18:43.388 - 00:19:27.490, Speaker B: Lily pad. Like, every new chain, like, I remember, like, near came out and everyone's like, oh, are we all going to near now? And then, you know, you just repeat that every three months. There's like, this new thing everybody's talking about, but it's a really big investment to, like, move somewhere else and, like, try to become, you know, technical experts there. And, you know, everybody has their own set of trade offs, and ultimately, it just makes sense to, you know, like, pick your, pick the thing you want to be an expert in and push forward until you think there's literally no room to push forward. At least that's, that's my mental model. I don't know if that was the answer you guys were trying to, but.
00:19:27.910 - 00:20:04.194, Speaker A: That'S great just to. I'm sure you guys get the Solana question, like over and over again. So I don't want to harp on it too long, but I wanted to hear maybe a bit about what you guys. Obviously, Solana has grown pretty significantly in terms of people using it. The apps on there, you described some of the evolution of it. Some things weren't working, and now they're working a lot better. What kind of things do you guys see as the improvements that need to happen that haven't happened, or maybe some that have happened that kind of changed the game for you guys? Or.
00:20:04.194 - 00:20:08.550, Speaker A: Yeah, just touch on a little bit about the Solana ecosystem and its development.
00:20:11.730 - 00:20:12.510, Speaker B: Yep.
00:20:13.090 - 00:21:14.264, Speaker D: I think I can start off here and you can probably dive into the details a bit more. So, yeah, for context, I mainly lead product MBD, whereas Z needs the research and dev side. On our side, I think the main blocker that we've had to the ecosystem growing and maybe like some things that we really want to see improve is probably on the bridging capabilities into Solana. I think when we talk to traders and users, that's been like the number one question. It's like, okay, how can we actually get funds onto Solana? Obviously, wormhole is the biggest bridge right now, but for liquidity and on wrapped assets like ETH or BDC, that's something that definitely needs to grow in order to promote usage. We recently listed wrapped ETH and wrapped BDC on a platform as well. And hopefully that grows the liquidity for both assets significantly.
00:21:14.264 - 00:22:11.048, Speaker D: But that's been a key issue for traders using our exchange. But what we think is going to be very exciting, that circle is looking to launch in the next couple of months is CCTP into Solana and out of Solana. So that will allow for a native mint and burn of us Ec natively on Solana and Eth and from l two s as well. So hopefully that should drive a lot of adoption. We recently added a bridging function onto our website where you can auto bridge from ETH, l one, arbitrum and BSE. We actually seen a lot of inflows from there. So, yeah, I think, I guess what we want to dispel is this myth that you can't bridge into Solana, or it's too hard to bridge in Solana by just wrapping it into the experience as like, as simple as we can and increasing liquidity on the underlying as well.
00:22:11.048 - 00:22:56.300, Speaker D: But yeah, that's been like the main thing, I think, that is kind of, you know, taking us a step away from EVM integration. The other thing that we're really excited about is metamask snaps. So this is still kind of under the wraps, but we've been working with the Metamask snaps team to build a custom drift snaps that allows you to approve transactions and hold funds within a metamask wallet. Allows you to connect to drift and other Solana apps as well. So we're excited about ways to essentially connect to other ecosystems and to expand the slow ecosystem from there as well, just by making it super easy for anyone to participate.
00:23:02.920 - 00:24:02.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I think everything that Cindy said is great for what's to come, uh, for the sole ecosystem. And I guess I don't really know if I have anything to. To add on. Like, how do we make people more excited about using this blockchain versus another? But the thing that I feel like my, my talents could go into is just trying to help make sure that protocols don't get exploited or there's any security vulnerabilities in the frameworks for writing smart contracts on Solana. So, yeah, if Solana can avoid any sort of major exploit or issues, once people feel confident using the chain, I think that'll just increase confidence and protect user capital. I know, like, for instance, audits, just a small team trying to get an audit is really, really expensive right now. The auditors are great.
00:24:02.674 - 00:24:30.100, Speaker B: They know their stuff, but it's just, it's kind of out of reach for a lot of up and start projects. So I'm thinking that over time, if there's, like, a fuzz testing framework or, you know, we use, like, chat, gBT just gets, like, super good over the next year, and, like, you can just use it to audit smart contracts better. I think those things could be a real boon.
00:24:31.730 - 00:24:38.314, Speaker A: Sorry, could you explain the fuzz system? I'm not familiar, so I'm going to assume some people.
00:24:38.482 - 00:25:29.240, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, of course. So fuzz testing, I guess just a buzzword for, like, throwing the kitchen sink at a smart contract in, like, a sandbox setting. So what that means is just, like, literally trying every single input and, like, possible action, you can do, like, thousands, hundreds of thousands, and just seeing if, like, any invariants break. Like, did. Were you able to drain funds by just sending, like, random transactions for days? Right. Like, this is, this is, like, this is used a lot in, like, other industries where they're really security conscious. So building, like, a general framework for smart contracts to just use that could help the security situation.
00:25:31.780 - 00:25:44.160, Speaker A: Awesome. Could we go into, I want to ask about the three different liquidity mechanisms that drift uses and how they all work together.
00:25:50.430 - 00:25:54.210, Speaker D: Yeah. Z, maybe you can take this one. This is your brainchild.
00:25:55.990 - 00:26:35.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess. As Cindy mentioned, like, originally, the only liquidity mechanism was virtual amm as a counterparty for takers. But now we have a three step esque process where a user basically submits an auction. Every single order that they submit. Like a market order, is just an auction. And an auction has three parameters, a start price, an end price, and a duration. Like, how long is the auction running for? And basically all that happens is the user is like, I'm willing to buy it at this price, like, let's say dollar 20.
00:26:35.610 - 00:27:45.820, Speaker B: And then the next slot, it becomes $20 and a penny. So it just becomes slightly more attractive for somebody to fulfill them over time. And the first step for the liquidity process is like adjusting time maker. So adjust in time maker can submit an order that would satisfy the user's auction and be their counterparty. The second step, or kind of tied with the first step, is the order book, where a filler, or anybody can search all the user orders in the system and then match them with that one taker. And then the final step is if there is no user provided liquidity on the books for that order, that satisfies the auction price, after a ten slot or so speed bump, the user order can fulfill itself against the virtual amm. And the reason there's a speed bump is to avoid latency arbitrage against the virtual amm and have it be hit by lots of toxic flow.
00:27:45.820 - 00:28:35.080, Speaker B: And then I kind of described in silos, but the way that they all work together is that people can provide liquidity on the virtual amm, and then the virtual imm will kind of look at what's happening with the JIT auction and order book and decide to provide supplemental liquidity, piggybacking off those active market maker prices in order to rebalance. So you kind of have the system where there's this, you know, there's these three systems you can get filled, but all of those systems are kind of interconnected in a way where the virtual mm can mimic the original guys for liquidity.
00:28:38.860 - 00:29:34.960, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, I want to try and get into each one of those a bit more specifically, starting off with the JIT liquidity, I guess I have two kind of, like, different areas of not concerned, but just interest. Number one being I haven't looked at the numbers in a couple of weeks, but as far as I remember, the amount of orders that are actually filled by JIT liquidity or JIT makers isn't really that substantial compared to the order book or the VMM. I'm wondering if you guys have a good idea of what kind of impact having the JIT liquidity mechanism has on drift as a whole, given that it doesn't process tons of volume. How useful do you see it being, or how useful have you found it to be thus far?
00:29:38.940 - 00:30:58.300, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. Honestly, until recently, I don't think the SDK etcetera has made it very easy to be a JIT maker. So when somebody comes in to drift, they either are just going to passively lp on the van or they're going to do a normal, you know, order book strategy that they're used to on any other venue. So honestly, as of recently, there's a new JIT proxy contract and a new JIT proxy like SDK where it's a lot easier for anyone who's integrating to easily express the JIT liquidity that they're willing to provide at in a way that's not as infrastructure intensive. So this is like basically we noticed basically exactly what you've been saying over time too. And on the development side, we've made a lot of improvements to the way somebody can get integrated with JIT liquidity. I think my thesis is that this is the most profitable end state for somebody to provide liquidity to a user, and will ultimately be the best way for benign flow to get good execution.
00:30:58.300 - 00:31:41.680, Speaker B: So just somebody clicking on the UI or your typical even uniswap user would be considered benign flow. Uniswap X came out recently to maybe mix, but mostly positive things like no gas, you get better execution than on normal uniswap. So I feel like there's a lot of confirmation that this type of liquidity mechanism could prove useful, but I definitely making it as simple and easy to integrate as a market maker is kind of the hurdle we feel is the thing we have to cross right now.
00:31:44.940 - 00:32:26.480, Speaker C: Right? So in that scenario where you're able to make it more democratized or easy to access, I guess does that. I guess this is kind of like a good segue into what dlps are, because im wondering if greater utilization of chit liquidity kind of results in worse flow for dlps. So if you could maybe explain how liquidity is provided from via dlps and whether or not more liquidity being processed by the JIT mechanism is kind of affects what kind of returns they see or what kind of order flow they get.
00:32:33.820 - 00:33:17.350, Speaker D: Yeah, I can give a quick primer on what dlps are and how the liquidity is provided there. So, with DLP's, it's kind of our answer to what GLP was for GMX. It's a very easy way for users to provide liquidity to an existing liquidity mechanism without needing to customize. Market making strategy. Do all that infrastructural jazz that most people don't have the time or energy to do with DLP, you're essentially depositing into isolated pools for each market. So we have a market for Seoul, which is our biggest market yet. I think we have about five mil of liquidity there.
00:33:17.350 - 00:34:12.130, Speaker D: You essentially take on a counterparty position to the traders who are trading in the sole market who get filled with the EMM. So I think how we describe it is that you take on a share of the EMM fills as a proportion to how much liquidity you provide versus the other DLP providers. And the EMM itself, which has a pool of liquidity it taps into. And so, yeah, if a trader goes along on the exchange and it matches against the EMm, that increases the EMm's net short position. And the trader who. Well, the person who's deposited into DLP will also inherit a percentage of that short position. What they also get outside of the short position is a proportion of fees, some funding if their p and l is settled.
00:34:12.130 - 00:34:52.030, Speaker D: And, yeah, that's essentially like what. What it looks like. A lot of the returns actually come from just holding the opposite position from traders. So I think over the last month, it's actually generated around 140% because it's been short. And that's been pretty profitable for anyone who's been short in the slow market. But if you strip all of that out of, and let's say you built like a Delta hedging thing around it, the actual fees, like the fee, only APR, is closer to, like, 30%. So it's a much wilder swing if you're just, like, depositing to DLP.
00:34:52.030 - 00:35:46.500, Speaker D: As for how, like, if jet market is really active, how that would affect the DLP returns, I'll say it doesn't really. It would maybe push slightly more, like, toxic positions onto the EMM. But the EMM has a lot of protective mechanisms against any sort of, like, toxic flow. Like, for instance, a lot of the JIT delays help protect the EMM against more toxic pills. The EMM can also participate in the jet auction. I can see talk a little bit through that, but, yeah, I'll stick there in saying that the EMM has a lot of ways to protect itself, to make sure that the net position and the prices that it provides is sort of a fair price in regards to, with regards to the inventory that it holds and to, like, the state of the volatility of the market as well.
00:35:50.480 - 00:37:07.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I want to say that what Ali asked about, like, well, if the AMM is going to get this position and there's more jet liquidity providers, the AMM is going to end up holding a bag it doesn't want to hold is basically, I think, within, like, a month of the v two development, our community was asking the exact same question. Like, everybody, everyone who was analyzing the stuff we were doing, that was always their first, the first thing they came to drift for. Yeah, I think it's really good to see, like, people actively thinking and contributing so early on. And basically that the mitigation measure around that is the AMM participation in the JIT auction that I alluded to earlier. So, like, if the AMM is holding inventory, but there's a JIT order that would rebalance the ammdez, the AMM is going to provide supplemental liquidity and basically, like, partially jit the flow as it comes in, kind of relying on the skill of the market maker who's actively jitting. Right. So there is a, there's an assumption made, but it's not an assumption.
00:37:07.860 - 00:37:39.770, Speaker B: Like, we're not like, categorizing certain makers or anything. You're just kind of, there's no, like, discriminant behavior with the amm. And we also think the non discriminant behavior of the AMM is important on an exchange where things could be literally discriminant. Like, you could imagine a jit maker doesn't want to fill somebody who might. They might classify as a smart trader. Right. So you'd only fill the traders you think you can win against.
00:37:39.770 - 00:37:54.330, Speaker B: And if that trader doesn't have access to liquidity, that kind of breaks down the whole ethos of an exchange. Right. So the idea of including indiscriminate liquidity in the exchange is really important for a system like this.
00:37:58.150 - 00:38:28.710, Speaker C: Yeah, awesome. Yeah, thanks for that. I want to just back up a bit to the dlp bit. You said 140% APR against Solana. That's a projection, because you guys just launched that, I think, like a week, maybe two weeks ago. So that's what the performance has been like up until now. And you said, I think you mentioned just looking at fees, it ranges somewhere around 30%.
00:38:28.710 - 00:38:41.870, Speaker C: Why is it so high? Like 140%. How are you guys, how are you guys hitting that? Like, at least two weeks in, that's a decent amount of time to still get there.
00:38:43.730 - 00:39:30.132, Speaker D: Yeah. So that is actually a 30 day return. So if you deposit into solace DLP 30 days ago, you would get that return. But if you actually break down, like, the sharp of that and, like, look at the volatility, it's pretty crazy. And the reason that it's so high, it mainly comes from the volatility of the market itself. We like to say that DLP is actually a pretty djang strategy without putting any traits on yourself, because you are exposed to all of the swings of the EMM without being delta hedged at all. So, yeah, DLP is essentially like you getting filled in net short, net long position.
00:39:30.132 - 00:40:12.110, Speaker D: So it does, like, move around a bit. It adjusts its inventory a lot, and that's why the returns are so high. But if you deposited maybe like two and a half weeks ago, your returns might be down from then, because the positions that you inherit at that time might have a different delta profile. So it's quite hard to say. That's why we say the average person who invested, like 30 days ago is up this amount, which sounds like an insane number. But when you actually break it down and look at the returns, it's very much because of the way the market has been moving. So, yeah.
00:40:15.490 - 00:40:55.300, Speaker B: Gotcha. For anyone interested, too, we have, like, the calculator in Grafana that really breaks down, like, in supreme detail, the performance from holding a position, the performance from fees, the potential funding that you can earn. And we're always looking to improve that. And there's people hopping in the discord, asking really all the tough questions on that. And, yeah, they've been happy with the details of that calculator. So if you, if you love drilling into the numbers, hop into the discord, we'll, we'll share the calculator and explain things to you the best we can.
00:40:58.080 - 00:41:21.690, Speaker C: Great. Yeah. Would definitely, would definitely be interested in looking at that, because, and is there, is there a reason why your, the returns for Solana, for the Solana DLP is so much higher than the rest? Is that just a product of liquidity somehow? Because I'm seeing it's, it's like head and shoulders above the rest in terms of TVL.
00:41:24.710 - 00:42:01.976, Speaker D: Yeah, I think majority of the trading volume still happens on Solana right now, at least on the Solana pair. I mean, yeah, I think people sort of come to Solana not to short the chain, probably prefer to come in and, like, trade the asset. Solana is also like a relatively exciting asset to trade compared to BTC Neith, which is a lot. It doesn't move as much. There are smaller pairs that gain attention here and there, like, from narratives that pop up. So Op was a pretty big narrative in the last month. Hepe also had some sick returns.
00:42:01.976 - 00:42:19.540, Speaker D: I think it was like six, 7%, not as high as Solana, but yeah, I think as a pot for activity like solpurp has been the best, and that's why it's been the most profitable to LP there. From both, like, a fees and utilization point of view, Solana has been the highest.
00:42:23.960 - 00:43:28.200, Speaker C: Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Moving on to the order book now, are you guys able to, I guess, first of all, just touch base on how that's managed a little bit, maybe go into the keeper network and kind of how feasible it is for someone like me to go and run a keeper bot. And then from there, I would also like to hear your opinion on, I guess, like, the importance and conversely, the feasibility of decentralizing an order book on a perp. Dex, we had rabbit Exxon, I think, last week or the week before last. The week before last, yeah. And we had a lot of good conversations there about just the path to taking an order book, from being maybe off chain managed by some users or market makers, or entirely managed by a protocol, to being at a point where it can be fully on chain and decentralized and whether or not that's even possible in the next year or two.
00:43:28.200 - 00:43:32.640, Speaker C: So, yeah, I'm curious to hear your guys thoughts on that.
00:43:37.700 - 00:44:43.020, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I can say a bit and then Cindy can handle the questions. I forgot. So in terms of running a keeper bot, if you have typescript installed on, like, if you know how to run a command on the console, if you open the terminal on Mac and you know how to clone a repo and run a command, it's literally as simple as that. Just to run a bot, a keeper bot doesn't need to have any capital up front. They just need to have some soul in a wallet. And the rewards for running a keeper and matching and searching for these orders definitely exceeds the cost for, you know, like, the sole transaction fee, which is, you know, five zeros and then a five sold. So, yeah, we have, I'd say, like, you can go to the streamlet page to see how many keepers there are and what their keeper volume is.
00:44:43.020 - 00:45:23.822, Speaker B: But last I've checked, it's like there's at least like 15 active keeper bots. We don't really know who these people are. And every time we try to make announcements in Discord. But yeah, we don't really know who's running a lot of these, to be honest. Which is kind of fun too, right? It's like a permissionless system. We've been working on even lighter versions of the Keeper network. If you don't have like a private RPC or anything like that, like you couldn't really compete with the original open, with the original open source bot.
00:45:23.822 - 00:46:13.802, Speaker B: But we've worked on an open source filler Lite is what we call it, where you can just run with a public RPC and potentially get some fills as well, which is, yeah, just democratizing it even further. The order book, I guess you brought up Rabbit X and decentralized versus like off chain order book. Everything about drift, all the orders, everything is on chain. So you place the order on chain, the order gets matched on chain. The only quote unquote off chain thing is the searching process. So there's two users who have open orders. Both the orders are on chain, but somebody needs to find these two users and match them.
00:46:13.802 - 00:47:13.654, Speaker B: That's kind of what the decentralized or unstructured order book would be. Another way to describe it relies on this keeper network for just to kind of maintain, maintain what you would see in a central limit order book. Like, here's the best bid. Best asks if you match them according to their fills, you get the highest incentive. But if you match them in a way where the taker gets a worse price, the incentive, the reward is much lower. So basically the cold keeper network is incentivized to mimic the price time preference that orders have in a normal order book. And we're doing it through incentives and game theory rather than by structuring and writing to a single account, which can cause write lock contention and slow down the process that people get filled on chain.
00:47:13.654 - 00:47:38.060, Speaker B: So that's kind of like our angle at tackling this. Like, don't compromise on the off chain front, just compromise on the price time ordering front. But try to resolve it using incentives and game theory, I guess, is the, that's like the trade off. That's a trade off. There.
00:47:41.080 - 00:47:59.200, Speaker C: Are the incentives that you mentioned, I guess, specifically for the keeper network. Is that something you guys are actively paying out or is that a product of how you're structuring your fees? So is it incurring any sort of expenses for you?
00:47:59.280 - 00:48:28.600, Speaker B: Oh, no, no. Yeah, it's a fraction of the taker fees that are paid. So in theory, I guess in order for the keeper network to survive, the taker fee can't go to zero. Otherwise the keepers have no incentive to match users. But yeah, it's all self contained. And like within the, the money flow of the protocol itself, there's no like extra subsidy going out for keepers that isn't really sustainable.
00:48:31.620 - 00:48:56.680, Speaker C: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, thanks for clearing that up. And then the. I guess from more of like an ideological standpoint, how do you. Because, you know, obviously a lot of drifts. Order book infrastructure is off chain, but done in a way that it's still decentralized or censorship resistant to an extent.
00:48:56.680 - 00:49:30.260, Speaker C: Do you think that bringing an order book entirely on chain is something that is feasible or even necessary compared to some of the solutions we've seen that get a bit more creative with trying to have it be decentralized without being entirely on chain? Like what you guys do, or like what DyDx V four is trying to do? Do you think that in the long run we'll see more creative solutions like that? Or will we see more of an attempt to try and put this stuff fully on chain?
00:49:34.760 - 00:50:49.180, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question. I think what we want to avoid is situations where you could spoof an order book, or you could essentially run matching in a way that isn't known to the public in option order books. I think there's a lot of creative implementations, potentially with ZK on an application layer, where you could make sure that the matching logic is done correctly and provably fair without bringing the entire order book on chain. That's an interesting application, and maybe something that the market could look at eventually. But I think the situation we want to avoid is having this AWS database that's matching orders in a way that the general public or traders don't know, and that turns it into more of a centralized exchange fashion. Wherever I you could have people getting advantages over others or certain makers that have advantages over others. That's the situation we want to avoid, in all fairness.
00:50:49.180 - 00:51:52.980, Speaker D: So any kind of innovation that we think of would avoid situations like that where matching could potentially be malicious in saying that other matching engine innovations such as the Oidx before. I think it's actually quite similar to what we're doing with drift and keeper bots, except that the Keeper bots are validators on their l one instead of just participants on the exchange. I think with Solana, with drift, what's interesting is that you can sort of do that without building a whole l one validator network. And this is happening on an app level. So, yeah, for DyD, access is really just like bringing that onto the app chain level. And I guess what we're not sure of is whether that's going to see as much uptake as well.
00:51:57.370 - 00:52:32.996, Speaker C: Gotcha. Okay. I think you cut out a little bit there, but essentially, the gist of it was being on Solana, at least towards end. You were saying being on Solana specifically allows you to do what Dydx does, or Dy DXv four will do, essentially, which is securing the order book via validators. But that would be feasible on an app chain level on Solana. Can you. Can you explain a little bit more, like how that's possible or what that means? I don't know if you caught that question there.
00:52:32.996 - 00:52:35.316, Speaker C: Looks like you've lost connection, I think.
00:52:35.348 - 00:53:26.490, Speaker D: I'm back. Sorry. Had some Internet cut up. Yeah, I think basically this happening versus on a validator level versus on a smart contract level, we've made the intention for this to be on the smart contract level without needing to work the entire l one, because we think that with the throughput Solana, it's actually possible to do all these things on an app level itself, while sharing light block space with others, and have the incentive mechanism baked into the protocol versus the entire chain. And we say incentive mechanisms in this case, it's like giving up a percentage of fees to keepers. But, yeah, I think doing this on an option level has been pretty efficient, and we think could be the prevailing model in the future.
00:53:30.030 - 00:54:01.220, Speaker C: Interesting. Okay. I wasn't aware that something like that was super feasible on Solana. Good to hear. Definitely cool. Moving on to the VMM, which is probably the most controversial of the three. I think for those who are not super familiar about, I want to say, three weeks ago now, NFT perp, v one had to sunset due to incurring some bad debt.
00:54:01.220 - 00:54:58.830, Speaker C: They had a pretty straightforward virtual AMM model, and I think that sparked a lot of discussion around. Specifically, there were a lot of people saying that vmms are just inherently bad systems, like they're never really going to work. People are comparing them to under collateralized stablecoins. And Z, you had a really good thread that I think took a view that had a lot more nuance to it, mostly just about not consolidating good VMM design principles with bad. Can you talk a little bit about how you view the issue, kind of what some of the common concerns are, and why you think that drift remedies them, or why you think that vmms aren't as bad as the popular crowd seems to think.
00:55:02.670 - 00:56:21.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess like the first thing I want to say on that is that pretty much everything that FUBAR or the other people posted about NFT perp is like pretty much like 100% accurate with like why that particular one failed. But I guess like you mentioned, I just wanted to bring a little more nuance to it rather than just trying to like kick, kick an easy target down. Right? So I guess you can either look at the drift VMM maybe as an example for a slightly better one. Wherever I made this analogy, I don't know how broken it is, but I'm going to try to make it anyways. There's this concept in computer science with virtual memory and physical memory. And the idea with virtual memory is that you can push complexity down to the hardware. It's up to the hardware to decide how to actually resolve the liquidity and profits and losses between users.
00:56:21.756 - 00:57:17.274, Speaker B: And by hardware in drift, you can think of that as the accounting and risk engine. So you can think of like, there's a backstop liquidity provider for a non fungible asset. This is not, you know, the most dangerous thing you can concoct in crypto. It's non fungible, it can't leave the Dex. And then you basically have a risk and accounting layer which decides, well, how am I going to settle my profits and losses? And this is something that all leverage exchanges need, virtual amm or not. You need a system that can properly handle settling losses between people, can avoid giving out too much leverage because bankruptcies exist. And when bankruptcies happen, like we've seen it on order books exchanges, we've seen it on like centralized and decentralized order book exchanges.
00:57:17.274 - 00:58:29.090, Speaker B: We've seen bankruptcies or these exploits. So by deferring a lot of this to the accounting system and the risk engine, I think you can build a lot of things in terms of really concrete good examples of vmms. There's this group that I would encourage people to look into called best labs. So they're like a crypto research firm, and they write very mathematically mature papers about building proper virtual amms. And you can actually build these things in a way where there's no way for someone to settle a negative value with the virtual amm. So you could literally quote as wide as it takes in order to ensure there's never a loss in the system. And people might ask like, well, why are you designing these crazy things anyways? Can't we just have normal exchanges and normal collateral? And honestly, the problem is that there's too many crypto exchanges being built and there's not enough high quality market makers or capital willing to deploy to, like, bootstrap these exchanges.
00:58:29.090 - 00:59:36.298, Speaker B: So even if you're not a Vam Maxi, you'll end up doing all these weird things like line of credit deals, token deals with market makers, all these weird emission schemes in order to try to bootstrap, which effectively is, it's kind of the same thing. It's a non sustainable, potentially damaging thing for a project. And you don't, and you don't ever build a loyal market maker for the Dex who literally was like, is programmed to not leave. You can make a deal with the market maker. They're kind of a mercenary. Maybe they'll stick around, but then as soon as things stop looking good or another project is offering more, they'll just hop away and you're left with, you know, nothing, no, a positive accumulation. So I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to paint them all as vultures, but to hinge the entire project on one or two external market makers cooperating with you gives them a lot of leverage.
00:59:36.298 - 01:00:38.430, Speaker B: And I think trying to design systems where, well, how can we effectively bootstrap in a way that isn't loss leading and has proper resolution mechanisms, like built in. So it's not like the developers have to go in and concoct some weird bankruptcy scheme. It's all programmatically built in. Like, if there's a loss, how is that settled? Can I claim P and L in the future when it's available? I guess. Last thing I'll say, just to continue the analogy, is with FTX, for instance, there was a hole in the balance sheet. But a lot of people, I read some comments where it's like, well, if FTX kept running honestly and profitably for long enough, they probably could have paid it all off in the future, right? Maybe. I mean, this is just, this is an argument, like, if you're profitable month over month, you can pay off a debt.
01:00:38.430 - 01:01:26.920, Speaker B: You know, just like when you, you get a credit card, you know, and you're in debt, like, you can pay it off in the future if you're a profitable venue. And the idea that we can't let protocols kind of have this bond like behavior, I think, I think it's like it's trying to limit the design space too much. I would love to encourage, like, a bunch of really smart economic tinkerers to come into crypto and try to design, like these more complex bootstrapping systems. And I'm not saying that drift is down that risk curve at all, but I just want to encourage more people to come in and do creative economic designs in crypto.
01:01:30.860 - 01:02:10.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a great point. Cindy mentioned that most of this is kind of your brainchild, and we've had a few discussions on bmms and other parts of derivatives protocols. But I'm very curious how exactly this was your brain child. Like, did you come up with this? Just, I just don't understand how you came up with this system. Were you mimicking something like in tradfi or. Yeah. Could you go into a little bit about how you kind of came up with this system and this model?
01:02:13.500 - 01:02:58.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Cindy is being very generous by calling it my brainchild. It wasn't like I was just sitting in a room by myself thinking for a month and then popped out with a. With a speck in my head. I think a lot of the ideas here just come from talking to people who have seen a lot of different systems, looking at a lot of different protocols, and then just trying to mesh together a combination of things that work. And then as you're building, you kind of just iterate and notice, well, this kind of is weird. How do we fix that? You try to. You can either zoom in, zoom out to figure out, oh, if I link this, you know, if we use the jet auction, maybe the AMM can become more balanced.
01:02:58.210 - 01:03:33.630, Speaker B: So, yeah, I would like to. I would like to say that a lot of this comes from talking with other team members, especially people who have seen a lot of other crypto projects and can point like, yeah, there's, like, there's GLP, there's cap finance, there's. There's lots of these projects doing interesting things. Maybe like, that could maybe be enhanced or improved by meshing different ideas together.
01:03:36.370 - 01:03:51.370, Speaker A: I know, Cindy, you have a hard stop, so I wanted to give you guys a chance to kind of maybe bring up something that we might have jumped over or kind of give you guys the floor to discuss. Anything, really.
01:03:59.270 - 01:04:08.126, Speaker C: Yeah, any. I guess any, like, shilling or any calls to action for the audience would be good here. Definitely.
01:04:08.278 - 01:04:17.140, Speaker A: Or maybe we could ask the burning question of one token. We jumped over here.
01:04:19.760 - 01:05:21.970, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, obviously this project has been around for a pretty long time. We started all the way back in 2021. And, yeah, I think the question of when token is, I guess, dependent on what our conditions look like, whether we feel like we sort of hit certain level of velocity that's unincentivized. I think one big theme for drift to wrap all this up is that a lot of the activities and the systems that we've built have run on very little incentives so far. So I think the incentives have been organic and natural and built in within taker fees. So even like when you look at the keeper system, it's a percentage of the taker fees that are paid to the network. Jits and makers all take a percentage of like maker fees we've never paid market makers externally.
01:05:21.970 - 01:06:19.700, Speaker D: And you know, everything has sort of been like this bootstrapped ecosystem, which we're really happy about because it means that the system can grow on its own accord, like without like the need of an external like, thing that brings some additional potential energy into the mix. That doesn't mean that having this additional incentive mechanism can't grow. And we absolutely think that's necessary for the rocket ship. But what we've been excited about is building this natural incentive system that works really well and then like, you know, putting the fuel on the fire. Right. So yeah, that's all I have to say. I think legal is probably gonna like text me now, but yeah, I mean, very excited to see this like continue to grow.
01:06:19.700 - 01:06:22.320, Speaker D: And then I feel when it makes sense.
01:06:25.980 - 01:06:46.404, Speaker C: So big said PMF in the chat. So it sounds like it's a. It sounds like you guys are treating the whole token, or I guess external incentivization aspect as secondary to the product being able to function on its own, which I'm a fan of. Definitely.
01:06:46.452 - 01:06:53.400, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Anything else you guys wanted to, anything we might have missed?
01:06:56.030 - 01:07:47.230, Speaker D: Yeah, obviously call to action. The easiest thing to do right now on drift is probably just deposit into DLP. But we mentioned as well earlier that the DLP is on hedge at the end of the day. So what we're trying to do is work with some protocols to also build hedged version of the DLP. So I think a lot of this was quite popular with GLP back in the day where building like hedge GLP, we think that's a good opportunity here because everything is in perps and it's much more liquid to hedge in perps that you could have a strategy of the DLP that's like running with the hedging built in. So very excited about that. Something may be announced in the coming weeks or so, but yeah, that's been in the works for a while.
01:07:47.230 - 01:08:02.970, Speaker D: So if you haven't yet deposit into DLP, and then when hedge DLP comes out, maybe you want to, you know, put, put some more risk off capital there. But that's not financial advice, so. Yep.
01:08:04.870 - 01:08:24.106, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, I'll definitely be checking it out, and I'm curious to see more from that. The calculator you guys mentioned as well. What about. I mean, I know roadmaps are memese, but do you guys have any, any cool stuff planned between now and then of the year that we can expect.
01:08:24.138 - 01:08:29.590, Speaker A: To look forward to or any goals that you guys have set for yourselves and the team?
01:08:30.650 - 01:08:53.550, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah, great question, I think. Yeah. Right now, we're number one Dapp for perp Dexus on Solana. We want to be number one across all chains. That's the goal. And I think a yardstick as well is not just to compete against other privexes, because that's probably like 50 per vexes today.
01:08:53.550 - 01:09:32.069, Speaker D: Our goal is really to increase the market share against centralized exchanges. I think dexs are still, like, less than 5% SX volume, and we think that this time the infrastructure has been the best it's been for nexus to rise up against centralized exchanges. So. Yeah, very excited about that. A couple of things. A couple other things coming up where we're launching vaults. So vaults allow you to delegate your account, essentially, delegate some other people's account to yours so you can run strategies for them.
01:09:32.069 - 01:10:04.470, Speaker D: This is useful for fund managers, anyone who's building a managed protocol of sorts. So a lot of interesting applications there. We are pretty excited about launching something that appeals more to DJ's as well, like higher leverage curves and things that could bring more the rollbit type flow into the exchange. Yeah. What else is coming up? Z? I know there's. We've been cooking up a lot of stuff that sometimes it even escapes my mind.
01:10:07.030 - 01:11:04.500, Speaker B: Yeah, there's. If you go to the drift labs repo, which is the whole project for drift, you can see all the commits coming through and all the new stuff that we're working on and testing. Another thing that we've been thinking about is similar to, like, these, like, you can run more automated strategies on centralized exchanges, having like, a way to do, you know, twap buys or just other, like, risk, like, automations you can put on your account. Definitely has been requested. And then. Yeah, just, just making it easier for somebody who doesn't want to invest, you know, weeks of their life in order to do something on the protocol. Maybe make it like an hour.
01:11:04.500 - 01:11:21.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I've noticed, like, a lot of people just want something that works, is reliable, and they can use quickly. So a lot of the dev effort has been around doing something like that.
01:11:25.050 - 01:11:39.714, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, definitely lots to look forward to there. Thanks for that. It's, like, unrelated, but I've been. I've been trying to sell cedo on drift for, like. Like, since, like, the three or four months when. Ago when I first found out about it.
01:11:39.714 - 01:11:47.750, Speaker C: And he just told me. He's. He's converted now after talking to you guys. So thanks for helping me help him see the light.
01:11:49.110 - 01:12:19.576, Speaker A: I think it was more out of ignorance than actually just disagreeing with what you guys think. I just haven't had the time to delve into your guys ecosystem. But we had a discussion a few weeks ago on our primer with Nate Zero x perp on Twitter. He mentioned you guys as one of his favorite derivatives protocols and you guys model, and we had a whole virtual Amm discussion. Yeah. Kind of led up to that. And I think this conversation was.
01:12:19.576 - 01:12:24.900, Speaker A: Was really great. You guys really kind of lit the light bulb. I guess.
01:12:26.640 - 01:12:26.928, Speaker D: So.
01:12:26.944 - 01:12:46.240, Speaker A: I appreciate it. I think that just about. Just about does it. Thank you guys so much for coming on. Really appreciate you guys taking the time, and thanks for building all of this stuff and, like, just thinking about it, just so we can just talk about it.
01:12:47.340 - 01:12:48.820, Speaker C: The armchair analyst.
01:12:48.940 - 01:12:49.640, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:51.900 - 01:12:59.292, Speaker D: Yep. Look forward to seeing you in the order books underneath.
01:12:59.316 - 01:13:00.052, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:13:00.116 - 01:13:00.996, Speaker C: Really appreciate this.
01:13:01.068 - 01:13:03.412, Speaker B: Thank you. Great chat. Bye.
