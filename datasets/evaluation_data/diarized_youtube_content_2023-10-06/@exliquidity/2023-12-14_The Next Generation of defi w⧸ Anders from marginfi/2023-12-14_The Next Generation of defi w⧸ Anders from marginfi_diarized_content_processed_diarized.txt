00:01:24.960 - 00:01:37.340, Speaker A: All right. Little fuck up there on my end. Episode 47 of Exit Liquidity. We got Anders from Marginfi. How's it going, man? Hey.
00:01:37.840 - 00:01:41.300, Speaker B: Just tweeting. Just tweeting the link. Doing good. How are you guys?
00:01:42.920 - 00:01:45.272, Speaker C: Doing? Well, pretty good.
00:01:45.376 - 00:02:01.492, Speaker A: Well, the name of the show, exit liquidity, it's got some deep history in it. Can you give us a bit of an intro about yourself and throw in a story of where you might have been someone else's exit liquidity?
00:02:01.676 - 00:02:31.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I was exit liquidity on Cheetos. No. So I. Let's see. I did, like, kind of some normal finance stuff before. Got interested in crypto back in high school, like, right before the 2017 cycle, so kind of, like, followed it since then and then. Yeah, I joined Marginfi right after the seed round closed in late 21, so.
00:02:31.270 - 00:02:48.736, Speaker B: Been with the team. Actually. Tomorrow will be two years. I didn't realize that. So the team, like, two years now, was, like, one of the first hires there. And, yeah, I can talk a little bit more about, like, what we're building if you want, but let's see. I didn't actually bid judo.
00:02:48.736 - 00:03:00.408, Speaker B: I just held my airdrop this whole time. But I definitely got dumped on recently. I'm trying to remember. Oh, I bought one of those, like, exile d gods. You guys see that? Those, like, pumped?
00:03:00.464 - 00:03:06.856, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Before or after that? He announced the bridge, I think right after.
00:03:06.928 - 00:03:35.580, Speaker B: I think that's why it didn't go well. Also, there's, like, 30% royalties on those, and I just, like, wasn't paying attention, and it was, like, completely optional, so I just, like, burned a ton of money on that for zero reasons. So that was my recent. Yeah, it's crazy, because they had the, like, the bridge tax to basically incentivize you not to trade them on slaughter. I think that's what it was. But so I don't know. Yeah, it wasn't, like, a yde.
00:03:35.580 - 00:03:39.060, Speaker B: Big size trade, but it was very, very poorly done.
00:03:40.360 - 00:03:43.744, Speaker C: I mean, you know, still going to $10 as. As far as I'm concerned.
00:03:43.872 - 00:03:44.480, Speaker B: That's right.
00:03:44.560 - 00:03:51.792, Speaker C: I think. I think you're. Yeah, it'll take some time. Take a little bit longer than. Than initially thought, but the. The. What's.
00:03:51.792 - 00:03:59.060, Speaker C: What's that thing that crypto. Capo says? The something scenario still in play? Target still.
00:04:01.250 - 00:04:03.178, Speaker B: Yeah. Bullish. Scenario is not.
00:04:03.234 - 00:04:03.514, Speaker C: Bullish.
00:04:03.562 - 00:04:05.618, Speaker B: Scenarios invalidated.
00:04:05.674 - 00:04:08.746, Speaker C: Yeah, not in. Yeah, that's the one. That's the one.
00:04:08.938 - 00:04:10.390, Speaker B: Yes. How feeling?
00:04:12.330 - 00:04:23.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess it would. It would be good to, like, get a little bit about, like, what margin is why. Why you chose to start there. Just like, set the scene a little bit, first off.
00:04:23.610 - 00:04:51.460, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have two main companies now. So we have Margin Inc. Which is like kind of almost product studio now. And then we have margin research, which is a HFT prop fund. So I'll talk mostly about, like, marginfi side, but, like, on the Margin Inc. Side, we are the core contributors to Marginfi, which is the largest DeFi app on Solana. And, like, the most liquid borrowed on Solana.
00:04:51.460 - 00:05:33.906, Speaker B: We're rolling out a few new products in the next few months. So we'll be doing like a over collateralized stablecoin that I could talk a little bit more about, a few other things we haven't talked publicly about much yet. So that's like, margin fi side. The way I got interested in that was, like, following Defi all last cycle. And I think Ethereum did a good job, kind of like bringing some of these primitives to light and making them a reality. But, like, once you've used Solana, it's, like, really annoying going back anywhere else. And I think that more and more people are realizing just, like, how much more enjoyable it is to use.
00:05:33.906 - 00:05:52.740, Speaker B: And that's just like, the Ux side. Like, from a performance perspective, there's a lot of benefits to something like Solana. And so, yeah, I guess, like, Solana was just super early when I got interested in it. And so it was like, a great opportunity to build out of some of these early primitives on a chain that seems really promising.
00:05:54.160 - 00:06:02.380, Speaker C: Were you, were you on the ETh side of things for, like, a significant period of time, or did you catch Solana pretty early and make the switch from there?
00:06:03.320 - 00:06:19.180, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Like, I like both ecosystems. Like, I still do stuff on ETh. I've done stuff on ETh for a while now, but, yeah, got interested in Solana, like, spring, summer 21, and have, like, mostly stuck around since then.
00:06:20.800 - 00:06:37.660, Speaker C: Interesting. Did you, did your faith ever waiver, like, after all the SPF stuff and, like, when, like, I think now the chain going down is a meme, but there was a time when it was like, a genuine. Was there ever a time where you, like, where you were worried about that kind of stuff?
00:06:38.040 - 00:07:22.448, Speaker B: Yeah, the outages, I think, never concerned me as much as some other people because there's always, like, pretty clear reasoning for them to happen. What concerns me more, even to this day, is the supply concentration on Solana. So if you look at ETH, total TVL divided by the FDV or the market cap of ETH, it's a pretty healthy rate. It's like 10% or something. But then if you look at that for Solana, it's closer to, I think it's like 2% last time I looked. And then if you look at, like, sole denominated TVL on Solana, it's been, like, pretty choppy this whole year. Like, like, the last month, everyone's like, oh, my gosh, like, Solana defi uniform, all this.
00:07:22.448 - 00:07:52.170, Speaker B: And so, like, all the numbers are going up, but that's really just, like, the dollar value going up. But if you look at, like, how much Solana is actually being used, it's, like, still quite a bit lower than last year. And so I think that remains, like, my big concern is that, like, too much of the supply is in people's hands who just want to, like, stake it and not do much with the chain. But as far as, like, the outages, I think, like, most of that's been mitigated at this point. And, like, all of the historical ones, there is clear reason for it.
00:07:53.950 - 00:08:27.570, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. I think, like, one of my, I definitely like one of Cedaw's bigger concerns and I guess most people's with Solana valid concerns at least, is on the liquidity side. And, like, you'd think that, like, everything that's been going on the past month, at least in sole terms, would eventually, like, transition into an uptick there. It could still, I think. And, like, especially with all the stuff that's still yet to come, that's, like, the one thing that's, like, worth monitoring, I think, just to see, like, how this. How this transitions.
00:08:27.990 - 00:08:37.389, Speaker B: Yeah, the liquidity is still really bad. I tweeted, I was tweeting a ton about this yesterday, but the guy that, like, deepak dem Sol, it was like a 8 million.
00:08:37.429 - 00:08:39.229, Speaker C: It's like a 7 million sell somewhere, right?
00:08:39.269 - 00:09:05.320, Speaker B: Like, literally all you need to defect. The largest one on Solana is, like a couple million, which is really, really bad. And there's some, like, nuance there. So, like, I don't know if you guys know synctom on Solana, but basically, like, MSL is, like, the only LST that could happen to. So the liquidity is, like, better for all the other ones than it seems, but it's still just, like, very, very small. It's not great.
00:09:07.020 - 00:09:23.412, Speaker C: I also on that, like, same, I saw a tweet explaining that, and on the same one, I saw that a 7 million sell into USDC of just native soul would drive the price down to, like, 40 on specifically.
00:09:23.596 - 00:09:26.000, Speaker B: I saw that, too. I didn't fact check that.
00:09:26.490 - 00:09:34.230, Speaker C: I didn't either. But it was hilarious to me. First thing I thought was like, all right, I know what I'm doing. If I ever, if I ever come up with $7 million.
00:09:35.330 - 00:09:41.666, Speaker B: I mean, it's. Let's see, that's 3 million, I guess.
00:09:41.778 - 00:09:45.746, Speaker C: I don't know if Jupiter misses any crucial sources for that.
00:09:45.938 - 00:10:15.920, Speaker B: Jupiter is really comprehensive, especially on, like, a major pair like that. Yeah, it's not. It's not good. I haven't checked this data recently, but I remember over the summer, it had been, there hadn't been a seven figure swap, like, one transaction over seven figures since FTX blew up. It was months and months and months. So, yeah, the liquidity remains very concerning. And it's interesting because the volume is really good right now.
00:10:15.920 - 00:10:40.090, Speaker B: I think a few days ago, it was 70% of eth on chain activity, which is pretty crazy, like the TVL, but there's just, like, not the depth for size right now. There's, like, a lot of people buying, like, you know, these just very low effort tokens. Having fun with that. But we need, like, much more liquid markets to get bigger players in.
00:10:40.830 - 00:11:24.864, Speaker C: Yeah, the spikes are very encouraging, I will say. Like, when you see that, like, salon is doing, or, like, Jupiter's doing 70% of, like, uniswap volume on, like, a given day, or, like, mad lads or tensorians is, like, the most traded collection in the past 24 hours in all of crypto. That stuff is super bullish, I think. But it's the moments outside of that, which is what I would like to see tick up. I feel like we've seen a lot of this happens anytime there's a somewhat new narrative. You see the same thread repeated, where it's, like, the same six projects mentioned. It's like, oh, like, it's not too late for Solana.
00:11:24.864 - 00:11:41.500, Speaker C: Airdrops farm these, like, six gems, and it's. It's always, like, margin camino drift tensor, you know, like, the usual suspects. Airdrop farming aside, what are, like, what are some projects in the ecosystem that you find to be, like, particularly exciting?
00:11:42.280 - 00:12:19.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I like. So I like keto, obviously, and then I like, what have I seen recently? I'll talk about sanctum, because I think that doesn't get, like, as much attention as it deserves. Yeah. So basically, all of the liquid staking tokens on salon are. They're all built on the same, like, SPL token standard. And since they're standardized, like, the way they're built is they're all stake accounts, technically, so they're all, like, staking to a validator. So what sanctum is, is it's basically this, like, huge pool of Solana.
00:12:19.510 - 00:12:54.740, Speaker B: And what you can do is you can swap any stake account into Sol. Normally, you'd have to, like, wait three days to unstake. But with this, it basically is like a future, almost, where it gives you liquidity on that. And so what that does is that means if you can, like, swap any LST to soul, then you can tap into all the liquidity that, like, Sol USDC has. And so it makes these lsts way more liquid. And it's also like the liquidity is fungible in a way. So any LsT that's built on that token standard can tap into that.
00:12:54.740 - 00:13:30.344, Speaker B: And so that was like, there's, like, two lsts that I think this is, like, interesting for. So if you look at, like, msoul yesterday, like, they didn't have sanctum liquidity. So that, like, hurt the depth quite a bit. And then if you look at, like, our LST product, initially, we didn't see, like, a dollar of liquidity for it. It was like, just using the sanctum liquidity. And so, like, even with that, like, we were able to, like, use it as collateral and margin finance stuff. And now it's, like, gone to the point where we have, like, meteor and camino pools and all that.
00:13:30.344 - 00:14:13.114, Speaker B: But I think sanctum is, like, really interesting. I think it's definitely, like, a only possible on Solana use case because you have, like, you're like, the LSTs are almost enshrined at this point, that, like, program on Solana. So I think that's, like, pretty cool in the defi side. What else have I liked recently? I think I want to play with parcel a little more. But hearing more and more about parcel, like, at face value, it's like the most ridiculous product, right? Like, perks on real estate on chain. Like, that's. It's pretty like you're not building that outside of a blockchain, I don't think.
00:14:13.114 - 00:14:41.450, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's, like, pretty cool. I want to play around with that some more. And then what else have I been using? Those are, like, the two I've been intrigued by the, like, a lot of the other ones are, like, things you've seen before, right? Like a borrow lend or a perp dex or some, like, liquidity manager. So I guess those two interest me because they're pretty unique use cases and things I haven't seen elsewhere.
00:14:42.670 - 00:15:07.296, Speaker C: Yeah, parcel is parcel is interesting. I haven't read up on it too much, but from what I've been told, like, it sounds. It sounds like, not, like, great. Well, it sounds like the infrastructure is, like, not great. You know, like, as far as I know, it's just a regular, like, vmm with. No. The same thing that's blown up in, like, three different scenarios already on Ethan L.
00:15:07.296 - 00:15:08.220, Speaker C: Two s. So.
00:15:08.800 - 00:15:15.296, Speaker B: Yeah, but the mechanisms trade. Miami, I guess, a little sketchy. Yeah, you can, like, go long Miami, and that's.
00:15:15.368 - 00:15:31.606, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess it's fun. It's the whole people will gamble on anything thesis, which is, like, a compelling one. I mean, let's be honest. People will gamble on anything. And it's, like, funny to talk about, too, like, going short. Miami going short. You know, whatever.
00:15:31.606 - 00:15:34.530, Speaker C: There's a lot of meme. Meme potential there, I think.
00:15:35.230 - 00:15:50.114, Speaker B: Yeah. I wouldn't want to be the guy, like, managing risk for that product, but I will definitely not try it out and be amused by it, for I.
00:15:50.122 - 00:16:15.610, Speaker A: Have a good idea of what it is, and I've seen the lido plus flashbots comparison. Can you give us, like, for someone who hasn't looked into it deep enough yet, can you give us the. Not necessarily the bull case, but, like, what it is, what you can do that's so different about it? What gave you the conviction to hold, like, fat airdrop bags to what is supposed to be $10?
00:16:16.550 - 00:17:02.672, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's, like, three core judo products. So there's the kind of, like, the main thing that everyone's. Everything's built around is the, like, MeV auction system. So the way Solana Mev works right now is you don't have a mempool at all. So it's basically like the transactions are all sequenced just according to what time they were submitted. It's not like all the transactions within a ten second period are then ordered arbitrarily based on what a blockbuilder wants. And so what happens with that is as soon as there's some sort of arbitrage opportunity on chain, there's just tons and tons of transactions spammed to try to get it before other people.
00:17:02.672 - 00:17:45.850, Speaker B: And so the problem with that is it leads to a ton of network congestion. It's something like 98 or 99% of transactions on Solana are just like arbitrage bots. And so what that does is that makes it way harder for normal people to land just some sort of simple transaction. And I think it'll also lead to higher fees in general. So what the Jito auction does is very similar to flashbots, basically. Now searchers can bid on these particular transactions that they're all trying to land. And the thought is that will reduce congestion and also distribute MeV from searchers back to stakers.
00:17:45.850 - 00:18:35.170, Speaker B: So kind of like a redistribution of the MEV there. So that's like the core thing that's like that. Everything else will be built around is that MeV engine. And then what they did after that was kind of their go to market was like, the way this works is it only works if the validator that's leading that slot is running Geeto as the validator client. And so if only 1% of the network's running it, you can't reduce all of this spam on the network. And so what they did was they made a LST that only stakes to validators running Jito. And the thought there is like, if you're holding Jito sold, then you're going to receive all of these mav tips from searchers.
00:18:35.170 - 00:18:57.760, Speaker B: And so they launched the LST. I think it's very close with marinate. Marinade has this native product. So they're like, if you go on defi llama, they have way more TBL. But if you look at just the stake pools, they're like, Nick. And right now, at one point, Jito is bigger, but I'm not sure right now. So they have this, this LST.
00:18:57.760 - 00:20:06.910, Speaker B: And then the last part is the stakenet product, which I don't think most people are familiar yet. And I think it's actually like pretty interesting from a governance perspective. But basically right now, like that stake pool program I mentioned is like fully on chain, but the delegation strategy is not on chain. So basically you have something off chain that's saying stake to these validators or stake to validators with x amount of stake in X countries, something like that. But what stakenet does is it lets that be fully decentralized and on chain. And now with the Jito token, you could vote on where stake goes. So I think from a governance perspective, this will be pretty interesting because you can, if Jito has like the most stake of any liquid staking pool and you can like vote on where that stake goes, there's like pretty clear value in that because I mean, like for one, there's just like the commission from staking and then two from like landing a transaction perspective, having more stake is like much better.
00:20:06.910 - 00:20:32.710, Speaker B: So yeah, that's like the three, the three biggest products with Jitto right now. And then I think as far as like trading goes. I think it's just like the. There's simply not enough coins on the market. Is my entire thesis there. So we'll see if that plays out. But there's, like, low flow, there's no meaningful supply changes for another year.
00:20:32.710 - 00:20:47.450, Speaker B: And if you look at, like, just the market cap basis, it's still quite cheap, even if the FDV is really high. So not financial advice, but that's why I, like, haven't sold any of my airdrop, and I'm gonna sit on these for a while.
00:20:49.070 - 00:20:57.850, Speaker A: Nice. That was a really good explanation. I can't tell if we asked this, but what is, like, the. What is your role at marginfi?
00:20:58.390 - 00:21:07.930, Speaker B: I work on the growth team there. So do, like, marketing community product, and then more like, BD sales type stuff.
00:21:09.510 - 00:21:09.942, Speaker A: Nice.
00:21:10.006 - 00:21:12.330, Speaker B: What was the writing code?
00:21:12.710 - 00:21:21.370, Speaker A: What was, like, the moment that, like, where you switched to Solana? Do you remember, like, the kind of, like, first few things you did on there?
00:21:22.030 - 00:21:49.992, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember I had before that. Yeah. So I. I remember buying Solana over that summer, and then I didn't get, like, really into it until the, like, dj n ape mint. So I minted those, and those did really well. And then it was crazy, man. Like, I remember I was in college at the time, and, like, in between classes, I was just, like, minting nfts.
00:21:49.992 - 00:22:11.180, Speaker B: And, like, anything you minted for this, like, two week period, like, you could immediately just sell it for like, five tedx more, and it was just like, two of them a day, nonstop. So that was when, like, Solana got really crazy and. And that was quite a bit of fun. But had been looking, like, a little bit before then, but, yeah, that was when it got, like, more serious, I guess.
00:22:11.600 - 00:22:21.680, Speaker A: What kind of stuff do you, like, only do on eth or only do on Solana? You said, you mentioned you do some things on eth. What are, like, the main things you're doing over there?
00:22:21.840 - 00:22:44.444, Speaker B: So, I don't know. I got pulled into the, like, shitcoin vortex of the summer on Eth, so I. That was kind of fun. I don't know. Probably not a great idea, but. So there's, like, historically much better, like, low cap stuff like that on eth. And then now I'm mostly just, like, just trying out some of these new l two things.
00:22:44.444 - 00:23:02.360, Speaker B: So, like I said, some money to blast, like, a little friend type portfolio. I want to get into Eigen layer when those caps go up. I tried out, honestly, ZK sync. I think it's the 18th, right? I thought it was the 18th or.
00:23:02.400 - 00:23:05.900, Speaker C: Maybe they announced it. I don't know. If they did, it might be right.
00:23:08.200 - 00:23:21.380, Speaker B: Yeah. I used Zksync, and honestly, it felt pretty fast. I was expecting to be, like a full hater of Zk sync, but my brief usage of it really wasn't that bad. I don't know.
00:23:21.720 - 00:23:25.976, Speaker C: That's crazy. I'm a pretty big Zk sync hater, I'm not gonna lie.
00:23:26.088 - 00:23:28.128, Speaker B: Really? What's your. What's your peep with them?
00:23:28.184 - 00:23:48.908, Speaker C: It's not. Well, okay. It's not the actual, like, interacting with the actual chain is better than something like Starknet, I think. I've tried. I've tried. And, like, linia, I've tried literally, like, every l two at this point. My problem with Zksync is the ecosystem for how long it's been around.
00:23:48.908 - 00:24:23.220, Speaker C: Like, I don't consider it to be like a new, like a new new l two anymore. It's been around since like, march, I think, which, like, yeah, that's not that long. But, like. Like, I think I would rather go and use something like, like scroll because they have, like, they have the same, like, top decks that Zk sync does sync swap, and they have ambient. And, like, I would have no problem using ambient. I mean, I farm it, obviously, but I also just. I like the interface.
00:24:23.220 - 00:25:08.024, Speaker C: Zksync, they've just. I don't know, I feel like I just had my hopes too high. Like, I did this whole thing. This was like, this was like, maybe like a month or two ago, they, like, I found this, like, GitHub repo where they were talking about this like, block timestamp issue that Zksync had had for a while that they were fixing. It was like a, like a six to eight week development process or something like that. And after that was fixed, the block times would be synced with mainet and with other l two s again. So other EVM projects could, like, ease much, easily, much more easier deploy onto Zk sync, whereas before it was like, you had to kind of start from scratch.
00:25:08.024 - 00:25:47.390, Speaker C: So I found that and I was like, holy shit, guys. Like, we can finally have, like, uniswap and like, chain link and curve and all this, like, important infrastructure on zksync. And mind you, prior to this, I was also, like, convinced that Zksync was going to have some sort of, like, a killer app just because it was like the first big l two after arbitrum and optimism, arbitrary Mobi said GMX optimism had, like, synthetix and Bell drome. So I was convinced Zksync was going to also, but they never did. And then I found this thing. I made like a whole thread about it that like kind of blew up. And then the date came and went like a month ago and there's still nothing on there.
00:25:47.390 - 00:26:19.060, Speaker C: And it's like, it's pretty expensive sometimes too. Like two, $3 for swaps. I think I just had bad expectations for it. So like, it kind of holds like a poor place in my heart. On the bright side, I'm going to be getting one hell of an airdrop from them because I've been using it literally since day one on like six or seven different wallets, just like trying different things. But I, I don't know, I think, yeah, I think it was more so. More so my fault for getting my hopes up more than anything because I know that happened with other l two s.
00:26:19.060 - 00:26:20.912, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:20.936 - 00:26:24.740, Speaker B: When, what was the launch date again? How long has it been?
00:26:27.200 - 00:26:30.820, Speaker C: March something? I don't know. Let me check. Defy llama.
00:26:31.320 - 00:26:32.660, Speaker B: Yeah, that is a while.
00:26:33.600 - 00:27:26.830, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, it's not as long as like arbitrary optimism, obviously, but when I, what I compare it to is like the other new gen of l two s, which is like, which is like linea Scroll, I guess, really just those two, mainly starknet kind of mantle. Yeah, Starknet kind of, but Starknet has, I also dislike Starknet, but they, I wasn't as close to them because for like a good year after their launch, transactions took like an hour each. It was a joke. And they were, they were running like farming campaigns on there through, through like via Argent or something like that. And just because I was on there so early, I like, you know, wanted to take advantage of that. So every week I would log on, I would do Argent's like stupid little task of like swap $20 or whatever.
00:27:26.830 - 00:27:44.110, Speaker C: I would submit the transaction and then I would go and do something else while I waited for it to, while I waited for it to be submitted. I'll come back like a half hour later and it wouldn't be done yet because everyone would log on and there was like no throughput whatsoever. So Stark nets just always been a joke to me. I never gave them a chance to begin with.
00:27:46.570 - 00:28:04.902, Speaker B: Did you see earliest tweet about how they got like locked out of their wallet, basically, or they like, stop servicing their account? I gotta, I saw someone like, had a stark net wallet and then they just said, like, your wallets basically. It was very bizarre. I didn't look into it a ton.
00:28:04.966 - 00:28:44.770, Speaker C: But they had a, Argent had an issue specifically a while back, or. I think it's still an issue now, if you haven't updated your wallet in a while, but you have to, like, update every so often, or you did in the past and there's, like, a bug or, like, not even a bug. I think it was just like, like, I think this was just the way it worked. Like, you update and it clears, like, your funds and you, like, can't. You can't, like, I don't know what happens to them because it happened to me. I only had, like, $50 on that wallet, but it happened to me once. And, like, I literally, like, I got the seed phrase back and everything, and I went through all 100 wallets that were attached to that seed phrase, and I couldn't find my money.
00:28:44.770 - 00:28:52.690, Speaker C: So I don't. Stark nets just, I don't know, they're. There's something else.
00:28:54.190 - 00:28:55.050, Speaker B: I just.
00:28:55.750 - 00:29:08.254, Speaker C: This was a different issue. This was a different issue than the one I had. Yeah, well, it's a different one. No, I have no idea. I know. You have to. I know you do have to update accounts every so, every so often.
00:29:08.254 - 00:29:14.210, Speaker C: But I guess after a while, sometimes you just get locked out too easy.
00:29:19.600 - 00:29:29.960, Speaker A: I remember seeing those guys in Columbia. They always seem sketch to me. Since then, they never, like, put out anything solid. Yeah, they like a talk.
00:29:30.040 - 00:29:32.680, Speaker B: It's with RJ.
00:29:32.720 - 00:30:09.910, Speaker C: It's an interesting ecosystem. It's very. I worked in VC for a while, and it's of getting into, like, at least back then, getting into anything starknet related was impossible unless you were, like, in their ecosystem because they raised so much money that they would just fund every project themselves. And, like, they're the few cap tables they did have that were public were, like, super competitive. But, like, besides that, like, Starknet was just siloed from everything else. Like, they had very little bd effort and other. In other ecosystems.
00:30:09.910 - 00:30:43.150, Speaker C: Like, you couldn't really invest in them unless you were, like, really in there. It was. I don't really know what the, what the plan was there with that, but, yeah. Interesting. I want to switch over to, like, margin fi a little bit here. Can you give us, like, a rough, rough overview of, like, the products you guys have specifically? Like, specifically, I'm interested in hearing about the LSD and the stable coin you guys are looking to launch.
00:30:43.920 - 00:31:15.700, Speaker B: Yeah. So we have, right now we have, like, two core products, I'd say. So we have, like, margin Phi, sometimes called marginland, which is the borrow end. So that's just like, a very high quality borrowlent. Like, it's nothing fancy, really. It's just like, it does what you'd expect, like, an aave or compound to do, but it just does it very well. And we've done a ton of, like, research on the risk side with this.
00:31:15.700 - 00:31:51.178, Speaker B: So we have, like, these deposit and borrow caps that are driven, like, entirely just by this, like, that market liquidity we were talking about earlier. So, like, if you look at our app right now, like, there's only, like, a couple assets you can actually deposit at this point, just because. Because everything else is maxed out. And we're hoping we can raise caps more. But it's just a function of what the liquidity is like in the ecosystem. So that's like, the borrow side. Like I was saying earlier, it's largest app on Solana now, or like, highest TVL app on Solana.
00:31:51.178 - 00:32:50.850, Speaker B: And then we also have an LST, which is called LST. And what our idea there was Washington, like in a, in a post sanctum world where LST, liquidity is all fungible, there's much less of a liquidity moat with an LST. So, like, lido has a monopoly on ETH because they had all the liquidity early on. And so, like, no new borrow or perp Dex is going to list something outside of steth unless it has a lot of liquidity, just because there's, like, risk associated with that. But on Solana, since this is 15, $20 million sanctum pool everyone can tap into, all of a sudden, the liquidity is in a moat, which makes all these fungible. And so then I think we start seeing more specialized lsts. And so what we are doing with ours is it's just entirely performance oriented.
00:32:50.850 - 00:33:32.290, Speaker B: So it only sticks to two validators that we operate. There's no commission on the validator. There's no commission on the stake pool. And then the validators themselves are like, some of the highest yielding on Solana. So if you want to hold Solana in a liquid staking token, it's the highest yield option for that available. But it goes back to this thesis that lsts will become commoditized, and basically, people will use lsts for, there'll be, like, niche lsts for different things you want to do. So there's one called, like, dao Soul on Solana, which is it only sticks to, like, you know, the monkey Dao and the bonk and the Madlad validator.
00:33:32.290 - 00:34:05.800, Speaker B: It's a community run LST. Something like Jitto only sticks to things that stick, that run the jito client, obviously. So that's our LST product. And then the next product will kind of use both of those. So we're building this over collateralized yield bearing stable coin. And so what it will do is you'll be able to mint it against any LST deposit in marginfi and not just like our LST, but like all the different types of lsts. And it'll be yield bearing.
00:34:05.800 - 00:34:34.749, Speaker B: So basically the like, yield from the, from the staking rewards will get redirected to holders of the stable coin. So kind of similar to like a Libra on ETh. But that should be. I'm very excited for that. We're targeting like end of January for that. And it'll definitely be like the most complicated product we built, I think. But if it works the way we're expecting it to, I think it'll be really, really interesting.
00:34:36.569 - 00:34:50.320, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Ollie had to go piss. The. The question on my mind sitting on, on the left curve, who named LST? LST?
00:34:52.020 - 00:34:53.080, Speaker B: I think I.
00:34:53.580 - 00:34:54.320, Speaker A: They.
00:34:54.700 - 00:35:02.788, Speaker B: I think it was me. Remember it was funny when we did this and the stable coin name, we were like. We were just like spitballing.
00:35:02.844 - 00:35:06.562, Speaker A: We released the. Have you released the stable coin name yet?
00:35:06.746 - 00:35:08.670, Speaker B: Yeah, it's called YBX.
00:35:10.410 - 00:35:11.722, Speaker A: YBX.
00:35:11.906 - 00:35:19.750, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll let people ponder that. But yeah, it's LST and YBX.
00:35:21.010 - 00:35:52.418, Speaker A: How have you guys been thinking about like the risk stuff there with like a yield bearing stable coin? So I feel like Libra is all right, but there have been some competitors that have tried to tweak the things that they've done and tweak the kind of risk parameters and like, basically they've kind of like shit themselves a bit. There's been some like big issues there. Have you guys been thinking about the risk there and deploying that? Yeah.
00:35:52.434 - 00:35:59.956, Speaker B: Is it like prisma or who? Have you seen that Ethan's doing better, doing the best?
00:35:59.988 - 00:36:05.828, Speaker A: No, I'd say Libra is. Is doing the best, but I think some of their, their competitors kind of sucked.
00:36:05.924 - 00:36:11.840, Speaker C: Raft had an exploit recently, right? I think not. Maybe two months ago, something like that.
00:36:13.420 - 00:36:21.762, Speaker B: I see, yeah. So you're curious about like, the risk management side of it or how we're thinking about like competitors trying to build it.
00:36:21.956 - 00:36:27.850, Speaker A: The risk management side, like seeing the failures of like other, other protocols.
00:36:28.510 - 00:36:59.612, Speaker B: Yeah. So dogs going crazy. It'll leverage all of our like, existing risk infra we built for the borrow lend because I think at the end, I mean, like, most of this is just like a liquidity question. And so we have like really good insight into. On chain liquidity. And when you have that, you can, like, more comfortably set parameters and different constraints around it. So I think, like, from a risk perspective, it'll be.
00:36:59.612 - 00:37:15.980, Speaker B: It's obviously like a different problem set because you need to maintain the peg. But as far as, like, maintaining collateralization and stuff goes, I think it's like a very similar problem space to what we did with the borrow lens. So I think we're gonna be able to leverage a lot of our existing infrastructure further.
00:37:18.720 - 00:37:35.500, Speaker C: Anders, to, to the best of your ability. Can you give us the, uh, can you give us the rundown of the. The soul end margin beef, like the history there and kind of like what, what the two sides are so mad about?
00:37:36.560 - 00:37:49.154, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm trying to remember how it. Someone asked me this last night. I think it was Jerry at ellipsis. It was like, uh, what was like the first. The first strike in the view?
00:37:49.202 - 00:37:50.810, Speaker C: Who threw the first stone? Yeah.
00:37:50.890 - 00:38:38.414, Speaker B: Yeah. Honestly, I don't remember. I've been, like, kind of sidelined on this whole scuffle. But basically, like, we have some, like, we built this bar of land because we saw, like, how, like, the whole FTX collapse went down, right? Like, there was a bunch of oracle issues and then there was, like, people borrowed way more than they should have been able to. And so it felt like there's, like, a lot of, like, pretty low hating optimizations to be made. And so we're like, all right, we're just going to build, like, a better, safer borrow lend. And so, like, most of the disagreements we've had have come, like, from this risk discussion.
00:38:38.414 - 00:39:21.220, Speaker B: So, like, yesterday, like, one of their engineers tweeted, like, oh, we just, like, peg LST prices to the sole price plus whatever, like, premium they've accumulated. And then that's, like, their methodology. Because the thought is, like, the LST is always solvent. It might just take some time. And so you can, like, price it at that because you can, like, eventually get those funds back. And then our argument is that, like, it's not, it's solvent, but it's not liquid. And the point of a borrow lend is to, like, maintain the liquidity of it.
00:39:21.220 - 00:39:32.976, Speaker B: And you're, like, incurring bad debt if you're nothing, even if it's, like, transient. And then that's all without even looking at a scenario where maybe the LST isn't solvent.
00:39:33.048 - 00:39:33.256, Speaker A: Right?
00:39:33.288 - 00:40:31.110, Speaker B: Like, if the stake pool contract got exploited, like, your LST isn't solvent anymore. And so, like, how do you price that for lenders that are lending against those assets? So that was, like, the beef yesterday, I think, like, I kind of see where they're coming from, but I think it's, like, pretty akin to if you hard code USDC as one in your risk engine. USDC is backed, but obviously it's deep before. So all of our risk management and all of our pricing methodology is on some zero hedge perma bear mindset because we basically assume anything can go to zero at any point in time. And so all of the constraints are, like, built around that, like, worst case scenario mindset. So that's why we, like, price things, how we do. That was, like, the Twitter beef yesterday.
00:40:31.110 - 00:41:01.954, Speaker B: Honestly, like, I don't really. I don't know. I don't, like, mind the solent guys, but they do seem like. I don't know, like, I don't think we're really, like, provoking fights much anymore, but they'll get, like, very, very, very heated in the replies out of nowhere, even if we're just, like, trying to discuss, like, a particular, like, methodology or feature. So, yeah, this is the beef.
00:41:02.122 - 00:41:14.010, Speaker A: It was funny to watch last night because every reply between, like, in the beef was happening within, like, two minutes of each other. So you knew the other guy was on the other side just, like, waiting.
00:41:14.050 - 00:41:16.350, Speaker C: To see what the next guy was typing.
00:41:17.760 - 00:41:35.368, Speaker A: It was. It was super funny to see. I mean, yeah, the vibe of the solon guy just, yeah, I don't. I don't understand, like, the technicalities too much, but they were trying to say, like, you guys, like, stole some, like, code base or something, and I'm like.
00:41:35.424 - 00:42:07.470, Speaker B: Oh, that was, that was another one, too. They said, like, we stole this, like, brick, the program feature, which is, like, basically what it does is it's just like a kill switch, right? Like, if something goes wrong, you just, like, effectively pause everything. So out of nowhere, like, unprovoked. We didn't, like, tweet at them or anything. Reuter, just, like, tweets. Like, it's cool to see them, like, steal this feature, basically, which we, like, didn't even. We didn't fork their repo, as far as I know, before, something else.
00:42:07.470 - 00:42:37.640, Speaker B: So then I, like, quote, tweeted him and basically said, like, you're entire protocol is a fork of something else, which it is. It's like an SPL lending program that all they've done is added, like, switchboard support, too, and now they're starting to build out the risk features. But, yeah, that was like, something unprovoked that. I don't know, it's just like, we're not trying to argue about that stuff. We're trying to build better products, but they seem, like, pretty set on, like, some of the name calling and stuff like that.
00:42:38.810 - 00:43:00.746, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I don't know. I mean, I don't. I can't say that I know much more about solon than I do about margin Phi. I mean, I guess maybe now I can after this episode, but even before that, I kind of felt just like a bystander to the whole thing. And just the tone of the stolen guys has been very. Has been very off putting.
00:43:00.746 - 00:43:23.196, Speaker C: So, I don't know. Yeah, very, very. Not a fan of that. But Solan's been around for a long time. I remember I was using them, or I was using them intermittently when I was first on Seoul. I think I first got on soul around the same time you did. I was more on the defi side, though.
00:43:23.196 - 00:43:55.726, Speaker C: So I didn't have the five, six x. Six x mints. I had. I had the, like, 200, 300% APY farms on radium and tulip, which you definitely had the better end of that deal, I would say, because I lost everything to impermanent loss within, like, a week or two. I didn't even. I didn't even get the five x or the six x. I'm curious, like, so margin fi lending product, lsT yield bearing stable.
00:43:55.726 - 00:44:07.260, Speaker C: What? Like, what do you guys hope to be in, like, two years or, like, five years? Like, what? Like, what role are you trying to fill in the ecosystem?
00:44:07.920 - 00:45:04.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we have a pretty clear vision of being, like, the hub for spot assets on Solana. So if you're trying to, like, lend, if you're trying to get liquidity on an asset, or if you're trying to, like, swap into another asset, we want, like, marginfi to be this, like, hub for all of that spot activity. So there's, like, the borrowlend side, there's the CDP, and then lastly, we're looking at building a, like, integrated, stable swap as well, which would allow for, like, stablecoin transactions with the borrow length liquidity. So, yeah, the vision is basically, like, margin will become, like, the place you go to do, like, anything with your spot assets on chain. And it'll support, like, all of these different actions that historically have been broken into different protocols, but we think are much more efficient when they're shared between one.
00:45:06.150 - 00:45:11.490, Speaker C: And how do you see the LSD and the stablecoin fitting into that vision?
00:45:12.150 - 00:46:16.320, Speaker B: Yeah, so the LST, we want to give people an option to maximize their yield without compromising on the optionality with it, because you could go stake to some validator that's doing really well right now, but then you can't do anything else with that. We're looking to enable that best in class native yield with the flexibility of having it tokenized. Then the stablecoin is just like a sustainable source of yield on stables. So I think if you can get sustainable yield on dollars, that's kind of like, there's always going to be demand for that. I think a lot of people are trying it with t bills right now. You use t bills to subsidize the yield, but there hasn't been as many people trying to do it with the, like the staking emissions. So it's just like a different source of yield, and it's a much more decentralized, stable coin than something that's like backed by t bills, obviously.
00:46:16.320 - 00:46:19.320, Speaker B: And so that's like the whole. That, that's Philly.
00:46:21.620 - 00:46:57.472, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Obvious. I feel like I had, you know, we have to ask this question throughout the. Just given the legendary wag me one token, I have $30 on Marginfi. Given everything that's happened, we have to ask if there's any information you can give us on. And it can just be like, if there's nothing specific, you can also just give us vague directional stuff. That's kind of what drift gave us.
00:46:57.472 - 00:47:22.060, Speaker C: And it was actually really useful, especially considering like, how early they, they spoke about it with us. It was like, you know, well before anyone was even looking at Solana in our audience. But it also gave us, like, good insight as to, like, how they're thinking about it. And I think that's definitely still relevant today, even though they haven't launched it. So any, anything that you can give us there?
00:47:22.520 - 00:47:26.590, Speaker B: Yeah, can't say too much.
00:47:27.890 - 00:47:52.500, Speaker A: Maybe it's, you know, points. Points is token, and in the name of, well, it's maybe token and in the name of decentralization, maybe there's a similar, like, way governance was done with a token that you enjoy that could look like, how margin might look like.
00:47:53.200 - 00:48:22.790, Speaker B: Oh, so just like totally randomly, there's this governance model called future key, iterative future key, which is basically where you use prediction markets as a voting mechanism. So people like, bet on outcomes rather than voting on outcomes. Just like totally randomly, just like, thought of that. Wanted to mention that totally random idea.
00:48:22.910 - 00:48:27.662, Speaker C: Is that practical? That seems like more of like a, like a fun, like, social.
00:48:27.726 - 00:48:29.130, Speaker A: Has anyone done that yet?
00:48:29.670 - 00:49:00.140, Speaker B: So there's one guy who built it on Solana, but I'm not entirely sure what it's governing. You know, like, it wasn't like a large protocol that like, used this for their governance model, but there's like, there's some like fairly academic clues, literature about it out there. I haven't. I'm trying to remember what, like, the biggest example of it implemented is, but, yeah, it's an interesting model. Yeah.
00:49:04.040 - 00:49:16.290, Speaker C: So back to margin. If you want to dodge the question, that's fine, we'll let you. If. Yeah, yeah, no, I think.
00:49:18.190 - 00:49:19.250, Speaker A: It clicked.
00:49:20.990 - 00:49:27.610, Speaker C: I don't, I don't think he. Okay, that's it. That's interesting.
00:49:28.070 - 00:49:34.930, Speaker A: I might look into that, those academic resources and maybe get a better idea of what that, what that looks like.
00:49:35.310 - 00:49:35.902, Speaker B: Yes.
00:49:36.006 - 00:50:00.762, Speaker C: Yeah, I, I do. I'm curious to ask, like, um, I'm gonna be honest, I don't like points systems. Um, I realized, like, I realized it's a means to an end. I realize it's a. Yeah. Point system that, that are drawn out, um, like blur or swell or NFT fi, um, or dozens of others. Um, judo was a good timeline.
00:50:00.762 - 00:50:03.610, Speaker C: Judo was very. Is what, like two, three months?
00:50:03.770 - 00:50:05.150, Speaker B: Yeah, judo is quick.
00:50:05.820 - 00:50:33.620, Speaker C: But there's a lot of hate circulating around point system today, especially people are, and obviously it's a means to an end, to dodge regulation while also generating hype and making some sort of an agreement with users. Are there any other models you guys considered for incentivizing activity without going the token route directly?
00:50:34.680 - 00:51:14.790, Speaker B: Yes, so we've done other incentive models. So the first, like, when we launched, we did this like liquidity bootstrapping program where we basically took, we just wanted like Sol and USDC liquidity. And so for Sol we're like, we'll give you 1% above the staking rate. And then for USDC we'll give you like 1% above the lending market rate on USDC. But the thing is, it's locked for six months. So that was our initial bootstrapping model. And then after that we had some third parties bring incentives onto our platform.
00:51:14.790 - 00:51:48.854, Speaker B: So very traditional liquidity mining. But yeah, I think outside of token and points, I haven't really seen any other incentive models like you could do maybe something with an NFT, but NFT is still just a token, I guess, for like, I get how people are excited for the actual token, but if there were, I guess if you dislike points, it's like, would you prefer to just have, like to just go into the token creation blindly?
00:51:49.022 - 00:51:56.632, Speaker A: Like kind of like, and anatoly have a comp, like some commentary on that, like, recently for.
00:51:56.696 - 00:51:59.860, Speaker B: Yeah, he was like, icos, basically.
00:52:00.160 - 00:52:12.060, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Was there anything there that was, like, feasible in the way he was describing that? Because I feel like, yeah, pitching icos is just not feasible.
00:52:13.840 - 00:52:42.910, Speaker B: Yeah, he was more talking about little, like, conversion process, I think. But I guess my, like, big question is, like, would users really, like, would you. It seems like it's better for users to, like, go into, like, with Jito. It's better to know where you stand, relatively, than just be going into a blind, you know? So it feels like it's not, like, hurting users from that perspective. Perspective.
00:52:43.610 - 00:52:47.470, Speaker A: Do you know who the number one margin? Five points. Guys.
00:52:48.130 - 00:53:06.858, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we had. It's not Kyle. Kyle's, like, not even top five, actually. I'll be in these, like, research chats, and people are like, oh, it's just Kyle. I'm working. He's, like, not even top five. So, yeah, I know the guy.
00:53:06.858 - 00:53:14.932, Speaker B: I don't like dox hime. I think he's, like, kind of low key about it, but, yeah, he's like a. That guy is a massive solo.
00:53:14.956 - 00:53:16.040, Speaker A: A solo guy.
00:53:18.140 - 00:53:24.520, Speaker B: No, actually, that guy's, like, he's up there as well. But, no, he's not the top guy.
00:53:26.340 - 00:53:27.920, Speaker A: It's not you, is it?
00:53:28.300 - 00:53:29.280, Speaker B: Not who?
00:53:30.020 - 00:53:30.960, Speaker A: Not you.
00:53:31.260 - 00:53:32.620, Speaker B: Oh, no, it's not me.
00:53:32.740 - 00:53:33.600, Speaker A: I wish.
00:53:36.300 - 00:54:00.200, Speaker C: We're coming up on time here. I want to circle back to when we asked you about some ecosystem projects you, like in Solana to ask you about mine or my current favorite one. I've been showing this to all my friends because it's still super early. So I'm curious to hear what you know about them. And if you have an opinion on Phoenix.
00:54:01.480 - 00:54:02.500, Speaker B: The Dex.
00:54:03.040 - 00:54:03.776, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:03.928 - 00:54:07.420, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. They're great, dude. Like, crazy sharp.
00:54:08.160 - 00:54:18.260, Speaker C: It's tough because they have, like, no online presence right now, so it's tough to get a gauge for anything besides, like, what their product is and for how early it is. It's. It kind of blows me away, honestly.
00:54:18.800 - 00:54:41.870, Speaker B: Yeah. So they've been building for about a year now, I want to say. And I think. I think they're kind of taking the serum approach, which was like, just be the order book. You don't need to, like, like, you own the infrastructure. You don't own the app layer. Right? So, like, I think, like, 90% of their flow comes from Jupiter.
00:54:41.870 - 00:55:22.958, Speaker B: Like, they have, like, they honestly have, like, one of the best uis I've seen. Like, for order books. Like, it's. It's amazing, but, like, no one, like, most people don't use it, but I think they're just, like, quoting much better and so they're getting the fills without having to, like, you know, have some, like, obnoxious telegram chat with people spamming and stickers and all that stuff. So, yeah, I mean, they're like, they're really, really sharp, smart guys. The product's doing great numbers. I think it's, like, doing more than USDC or lfinity and orca on the sole USDC.
00:55:23.014 - 00:55:30.170, Speaker C: It's pretty consistently top three on. On Jupiter every. Every time I check, at least in 24 hours volume behind, just like, radium and orca.
00:55:30.910 - 00:55:40.770, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. It's good. I I would be surprised if they launched a token anytime soon, quite frankly, but, yeah, me too. Yeah, it's a great product.
00:55:42.150 - 00:56:08.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I. I kind of try and I check out their discord every now and then. I, like, drop some feedback in there and, and, you know, try and be a helpful community member, but just like, no one's really around there and, like, everyone who is around there is kind of just like, just like, looking for incentives or something. So, like, not really any. Any reason for the team to check it out, but I'm excited for those guys.
00:56:09.280 - 00:56:12.752, Speaker B: Do you, do you use their site? Do you, like, trade on their.
00:56:12.896 - 00:56:19.424, Speaker C: Yeah, I. Sorry to admit it, but I did sell some of my Jito and I did it.
00:56:19.472 - 00:56:20.232, Speaker B: I mean, it was.
00:56:20.336 - 00:57:00.334, Speaker C: Yeah, I did it all through Phoenix. It was for a good cause, or I guess it was like my only experience using Phoenix because they listed judo. It was, it was interesting. They listed it right at launch, and the order book didn't hit any fills until maybe like 20 or 30 minutes in. But there was liquidity on there and you just watched the spread get closer and closer and closer until it hit a fill. But maybe like two or three minutes post launch. It was something like a 10% spread, which is not that bad, honestly, for what it is, and I don't.
00:57:00.334 - 00:57:07.220, Speaker C: Are Jupiter limit orders routed through that? Like, if I place a limit order on Jupiter, I don't think it goes rest in Phoenix order book.
00:57:10.040 - 00:57:29.020, Speaker B: If there's, like an ask on Phoenix or depending if you're buying or selling, like, they'll match those two orders, I think. I don't think it puts it on their book. But if there's, like, if you have, like, a limit order on Jupiter and someone's, like, willing to do that on the Phoenix book, it should route that.
00:57:30.480 - 00:58:05.060, Speaker C: Yeah. So at most it only takes taker liquidity, as far as I know, or at least from Jupiter, I don't think you can make directly on it. You have to make either on the Phoenix app or if you're like a market maker properly. But given that fact and given that not many people know about it, I was surprised that they had decent depth after half an hour. And that's where I was. That's where I was placing most of my limit orders once I did start selling. Last question.
00:58:05.060 - 00:58:20.340, Speaker C: Sito is having some connection issues, so I will ask for him. If you were to recommend someone for us to have on next, let's say one from Solana and one from ETH, who would you recommend?
00:58:21.440 - 00:58:31.710, Speaker B: Yeah, you should have let me look at my telegram recently.
00:58:33.890 - 00:58:37.658, Speaker A: You can go by project not person if you want.
00:58:37.754 - 00:58:38.082, Speaker B: Okay.
00:58:38.106 - 00:58:41.050, Speaker C: But I like having good personalities on.
00:58:41.170 - 00:58:43.790, Speaker B: You guys should have you guys know r 89.
00:58:45.770 - 00:58:46.830, Speaker C: Vaguely.
00:58:47.290 - 00:58:55.220, Speaker B: I don't think he'll do your podcast because he's, like, very. But I would try to get him just because he would be pretty.
00:58:55.260 - 00:58:58.440, Speaker A: We've had some in that. Guys, come on. No cam.
00:58:59.060 - 00:59:22.944, Speaker B: But, yeah, you might be able to video avatar sometimes and then on ETh. I have to think about that a little more. No, it's coming to mind. What projects have I used that were cool? I mean, if you could get Pac man on, I would definitely listen to that.
00:59:23.032 - 00:59:24.900, Speaker C: It'd be like, we tried.
00:59:25.760 - 00:59:29.740, Speaker B: We tried a lot smaller. Yeah, yeah.
00:59:30.280 - 00:59:32.544, Speaker C: We were like 200 followers when we tried.
00:59:32.632 - 00:59:35.140, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a chance.
00:59:36.360 - 00:59:37.380, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe.
00:59:39.080 - 00:59:40.620, Speaker B: Yeah, it's probably.
00:59:42.970 - 00:59:43.802, Speaker C: Check out.
00:59:43.946 - 00:59:44.658, Speaker A: What's his name?
00:59:44.714 - 00:59:45.790, Speaker C: Familiar with him?
00:59:47.810 - 00:59:52.830, Speaker A: Fuck. I'm blanking on his name. I wanted this guy. Oh, Frank from D guides.
00:59:53.290 - 00:59:54.110, Speaker B: Oh.
00:59:54.890 - 01:00:01.714, Speaker A: Do you think he'd be a good guess? I doubt he would. Come on this. We're near. Not nearly big enough, but yeah, I.
01:00:01.722 - 01:00:22.228, Speaker B: Don'T know if he would. He's. I mean, he's definitely a good marketer. Like, he knows what he's doing there. I'd be curious how he's, I mean, someone should get him on a podcast to get, like, his. His stance on, like, youth versus soul these days, because I think that would be amusing. But, yeah, I don't know.
01:00:22.228 - 01:00:30.480, Speaker B: I feel like he's definitely a good marketer. I have, like, respect for that. But obviously they've been struggling recently.
01:00:32.260 - 01:00:32.876, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:32.988 - 01:00:35.934, Speaker C: That's all the more reason to have them on controversy.
01:00:36.092 - 01:00:37.010, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:00:37.130 - 01:00:43.230, Speaker C: That's what we're here for. That's. We. We just had you on because the soul and tweets. Honestly, that was. That was it.
01:00:43.810 - 01:00:47.550, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't want to highlight the beef too much, but.
01:00:51.890 - 01:00:52.602, Speaker A: We had you on.
01:00:52.626 - 01:00:54.082, Speaker C: So GT was, like, last night, too.
01:00:54.146 - 01:01:00.202, Speaker A: $10 as it. Has the price gone up as this episode, it's gonna have that kind of.
01:01:00.226 - 01:01:23.650, Speaker B: A red candle every time I, like, mention, you know, it goes down, and every time I go to bed, it goes up. It's near. Shut up. No, I was just looking at Phoenix, though, the judo book, as I could just, like, put my. My stack at $10 on the book to just put my money out of my mouth. Yeah, just, like, leave it there. I don't know if I want to lock it up there, though, but I don't know.
01:01:23.650 - 01:01:25.150, Speaker B: Might do that with some of it.
01:01:26.410 - 01:01:27.190, Speaker C: Cool.
01:01:29.850 - 01:01:34.450, Speaker A: That's episode 47. I appreciate you coming on. Thanks, everybody, for tuning in.
