00:00:00.320 - 00:00:06.810, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:07.470 - 00:00:48.640, Speaker B: So this is episode eight of the NFT fi summer season we're doing at exit liquidity. So we got Oogway and Dylan on the spice account. I appreciate you guys popping in here, given us the time. We usually like to start this, just kind of given a brief history about where you've been in the space. But more importantly, to kind of signify your stripes, I guess, is to kind of give us your biggest moments where you were someone else's exit liquidity.
00:00:50.380 - 00:00:51.220, Speaker A: All right.
00:00:51.380 - 00:01:21.956, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess I got involved in the space. Used to work in tradfi con, mergers and acquisitions. Kind of put around, did a few deals in gaming, entertainment, fintech, healthcare. Really everything under the sun. And a few years into tradfi banking, I got around to playing around in Defi. Mostly just trading, shaping governance tokens. Probably the place where I became a lot of peoples exit liquidity, but also got a little exit liquidity myself was in the rebase tokenization arena.
00:01:21.956 - 00:01:38.332, Speaker C: So that was, I think Olympus now would probably be really the first time I wrote that thing out all the way to the end, basically. And yeah, obviously got dumped on pretty hard with other people's actual liquidity. But I think it was a pretty good learning lesson, that's to say, yeah.
00:01:38.436 - 00:02:09.366, Speaker A: I come from a pretty. Or I guess first I can introduce myself. I'm, uh, I go by many names nowadays and maybe even buy more names into the future. But currently I'm known as either Dylan or formerly shirtless founder, currently Duncan, and who knows in the future. But yeah, my background is a bit non traditional. So I was actually a chemical engineer before going into defi and crypto. So something kind of out of left field.
00:02:09.366 - 00:03:02.658, Speaker A: But, you know, the more I've been in the space, the more I've realized that there been many chemical engineers that have kind of entered into the crypto sphere, maybe for several reasons, but we can go into that if you want to talk about it later. But anyways, like, my startup in crypto is actually really kind of guided by the two co founders that I'm working with right now, Ukwe, and then our co founder Nietzsche. So they were more entrenched or more. They had more experience in crypto than I did when we all started spiced together. So they were really my guides going into crypto. But what really interested me about crypto was just like the philosophy around it, the ethos, the political, personal, political alignment I had with the space. So that's really how I entered into the space and really got involved from that angle.
00:03:02.658 - 00:03:44.952, Speaker A: I think in terms of exit liquidity, the biggest l I probably took was one that actually like Ugwe and I took together. I think around last year we were kind of getting involved or we were looking from the outside in at the maledy community about a year ago and we were priced out of actually buying Milady's. So we were looking at derivatives. And the one derivative that didn't pop off, we bought, which were the soy lads, I had like a 65% soy soy lad, we got it. I don't think the floor price rose at all and it just dumped. So I don't think I was necessarily exit liquidity in that situation, but it was an l that I could take.
00:03:45.056 - 00:04:02.192, Speaker B: Yeah, those are some good ones. I do remember the fourth moment very vividly. Definitely took some L's there. Were you guys involved in like any, any projects before spikes? Did you contribute anywhere else? Were you a big fan or a big user of any other projects?
00:04:02.336 - 00:04:41.788, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I had actually been one of the first. I was one of the first policy members over at Olympus when it first launched that for a few months before leaving. And that's kind of how I also got around to accumulating non insignificant own bag. And then kind of like after Olympus, I was just playing around in that general defi space. Nothing. I don't think I was a contributor in any capacity, but I was kind of involved a little bit with some, some of the RFV cartel. So just playing around with governance there, trying to figure out how to recoup some of the Ohm fork capital that's been locked up in some of those protocols out there.
00:04:41.884 - 00:05:03.066, Speaker A: Yeah, Spice is really my first like foray into really diving into working or building on a specific protocol. You know, beforehand I was just like playing around myself as like an individual person, just managing whatever funds that I had. But this was like really my first full time commitment to any type of defi protocol.
00:05:03.178 - 00:05:11.430, Speaker B: Awesome. And for NFT five specifically, what made you guys kind of even start looking at the niche in general?
00:05:12.410 - 00:06:25.002, Speaker C: Yeah, I think like, well, we had been playing around with DeFi for quite some time and we're really thinking about where it's kind of like the next evolution of DeFi. Obviously one of those kind of obvious spaces is really probably going to be just more efficient structures on l two s, like high throughput exchanges and whatnot. But one area that we think wasnt explored honestly in any capacity was how non fungibility would apply to finance. And part of going into NFT finance was our conviction around the value of non fungibility. Both at can represent pretty large complexity in different assets, but I think more so in the sense that most of the assets, most of the items and things we interact with in called the meat verse in real life has a layer of non fungibility to them. So that being your house, a car, intellectual property, even like if you're going into like video games, right, you'll have in game items such as counter strike skins. And so what we thought was that NFTs are actually fairly suitable for representing a lot of assets on chain.
00:06:25.002 - 00:07:07.022, Speaker C: And the future for where DeFi is going to go is really toward NFT finance, non fungible finance, Oracle less designs, something that can represent more assets on chain than just fungibility. Obviously there is a set of problems that goes along with that. And I think that ultimately what attracted us was the fact that when we looked at NFT finance, it actually wasn't that simple. It's not a very simple space. And I think we're at the very beginning. If anything, we're pre defi summer for where Defi was. So I think that was what was really attractive for us, or at least for me, towards why we should go into NFT finance.
00:07:07.022 - 00:07:10.690, Speaker C: I think Dinkin might have some additional thoughts there.
00:07:11.030 - 00:07:26.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I agree with everything that Uber is saying. I think the only thing that I would add, or I would maybe further emphasize upon, was, for me, what was really exciting was the potential, how wide the NFT use cases can really be.
00:07:26.792 - 00:07:26.976, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:27.008 - 00:08:40.864, Speaker A: Because I think that we're really just scratching the surface in terms of the potential of the technology, that being non fungible tokens that exist on the blockchain in its current use case, that being pfps and arts and collectibles, I'm not necessarily bearish on pfps and arts and collectibles. I think that they will persist as the visual identification layer of the blockchain based metaverse going into the future. But what really interests me is really the expansion of the use cases. We had mentioned Gamefi assets, real world assets coming on chain as well, or even financial positions in what's now termed as financial nfts. I think that the total addressable market, the total opportunities, the total use cases, the value propositions of nfts as, let's say, more so of a primitive than it is as an asset class as most people currently view it, is something that really interests me. It just seems so vast of a space to play in. And then from there, I think that internally, we've developed a thesis that finance the value proposition is just like unlocking capital efficiency within these assets.
00:08:40.864 - 00:08:59.208, Speaker A: I think that in any way that we can help bootstrap a digital economy by building out spice as a protocol. Helping other protocols that do or provide a similar value proposition thrives is something that is just exciting for me personally.
00:08:59.344 - 00:09:44.640, Speaker B: I think a lot of the founders that we've interviewed in the NFT PI space, similar belief where pfps and the like are not the fullest potential that nfts have. And when it comes to spice, could you. I mean, the product is beautifully simple, I think, and like an over complicated ecosystem where things just try and get complicated for no reason. You guys do like, you guys do your thing very well. Could you give us a little rundown on how exactly that works on the back end? And just for people that are unaware what exactly you do at Spice?
00:09:45.540 - 00:10:47.656, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess, yeah, like with spice Finance, we're really looking to, or we're looking to build an aggregator and a simplified liquidity protocol for just routing capital to the most promising NFT finance projects. I think what that means more simply is we build simple automated vaults for users to deposit their ETH or stablecoins, and then earn yield across the NFT finance ecosystem. In order to get that off the ground, there's really like three core pieces of infrastructure that we had to build out. The first are like pricing feeds. So we aggregate a variety of pricing oracles, ML Oracles and whatnot to get appraisal values for the NFTs we like route to on these NFT fi exchanges. The second piece of infra are risk feeds. So not only do we measure the price of, or do we try to estimate the price of, let's say an NFT or an NFT collection prior to building out a strategy, but we also have to understand what is the liquidity, what is the volatility.
00:10:47.656 - 00:11:21.680, Speaker C: And so there's a set of oracles that effectively feed data around how volatile an asset might be, and it feeds into other strategies that we have built out. And the final piece are just smart contracts. And these smart contracts aggregate existing protocols. So this is what kind of does the heavy lifting of when a user deposits ETH, that capital can get routed to an NFT finance protocol. It's not custodial in nature. And then they're able to earn that yield in ETH or stablecoins, and that yield goes back to the original depositor. And that's all done using smart contracts.
00:11:21.680 - 00:11:34.924, Speaker C: Those are the three pieces of infrastructure that allow for a really simplified user experience where all user really needs to do is hit deposit and then they're able to earn yield in native token.
00:11:35.092 - 00:11:56.750, Speaker B: That's interesting. I think what you guys do with that mechanism, was it something that naturally came as a second thought for like, was it a natural thought that you guys had to start something like this? Or was there a problem that you faced that you experienced in NFT five specifically that made you want to start twice?
00:11:57.530 - 00:12:43.182, Speaker C: I think it's a mix of both. We knew we wanted to explore NFT finance, and immediately day one of going into NFT finance, we realized, holy shit, this is pretty complicated and not very intuitive for an end user. And as we were kind of just trying to play around, get some experience in the space, we would just note down all the problems that we ran into. There were probably 2030 problems that are really plaguing the space. And we decided to go after the one that felt the most promising at the time and the one that would provide most value for users that are trying to get into the space. That being know, having simplified automated deployment of capital in the NFT finance space.
00:12:43.286 - 00:12:58.966, Speaker D: And then for, like, how you kind of took that idea to market, what was that, like, thought process, like, because I know you guys started with, like, the prologue vault and then built out two others from there. What was the thinking behind each one and, like, the progression there?
00:12:59.078 - 00:13:53.376, Speaker A: Yeah, I can kind of speak on this. So, yeah, the, I mean, the, I guess there are several things that were kind of involved. So we ended up starting with the prologue vault. And the prologue vault was, I think, primarily like a go to market execution or a go to market strategy that we wanted to execute upon. We were aware that none of our presences or like, we didn't have any kind of prior reputation or prior presence in the space. So we needed, we were aware that we needed to kind of make a splash with the launch of the protocol in and of itself in order to just get some eyeballs on spice for people to be aware of what value proposition we were bringing into the market. So that was really the main driver, main motivation for the prologue vault as the initial launch for Spice.
00:13:53.376 - 00:15:08.170, Speaker A: Yeah, the initial product launch for Spice. So it was a way for us to be able to kind of bootstrap a community, reward early holders, and really just kind of cause a scene in terms of, like, the uniqueness of the NFT as well as the vault and kind of the interplay between them, I guess, kind of backing up the prologue vault is the first vault that Spice has ever launched. And it's like the first external facing vault, right? So the money that's deposited into the prologue vault gets routed to the underlying marketplaces that we currently route two. So that being NFt fi x two y two, arcade bendao drops out and a pair space. But in the same vein that it is a vault, it's also kind of a financial NFT in and of itself, or at least like the Prologue NFT. So, unlike our other vaults, when you deposit into the prologue vault, or at least when you initially deposited into the prolog vault, you received an NFT receipt token. What we did that was pretty unique was we skinned the NFT receipt token with, like, a PFP collection that we had developed internally ourselves.
00:15:08.170 - 00:16:14.154, Speaker A: So it was a cool way for, like, the community to be able to represent that they were parts of spice. And then, you know, simultaneously, it serves as, like, the receipt token for your position, right? So if you hold the NFT, the prologue NFT, then you were able to easily just deposit and withdraw from the vault. And then likewise, the NFT also represents, like, the EtH position in that vault as well. So it was just like a pretty cool dynamic that we wanted to kind of experiment with, and then also, like, reward early holders with. It was also like a way for us to kind of bootstrap liquidity into the vault. So we ran a strategy immediately after the launch of the prologue vault, which we called the prologue playoffs, which was essentially a bidding war via deposits into the vault in order to get more pfps to increase your chance of getting assigned a PFP that's of a higher rarity in the collection. And we thought that went extremely well.
00:16:14.154 - 00:17:29.713, Speaker A: Essentially, the question that is asked is, like, you know, using this bidding war method, being highly public with the vaults, were you able to bootstrap more TVL than you could if you just, you know, drop the vault? I don't know, in the middle of the network without much of a splash. And I think that it was pretty successful. We were able to boot shopping off the ground. But the story from there kind of goes one, how do we increase the value of the prologue vaults and the prologue NFTs for Prolog holders? And the kind of the answer that we provided to the community was this idea of, like, providing prolog holders with an exclusive feature that we're calling Prolog leverage, which is an ability to kind of borrow against your prologue and by proxy, the ETH position in the prologue and loop that borrowed funds back into your position in order to de facto increase your yields. So that's something that we launched and that was the purpose of the leverage vault. The leverage vault being the vault that funds these loans that prologue holders can give out or that prologue holders can take out. So that was a pretty successful launch.
00:17:29.713 - 00:18:34.922, Speaker A: We learned a lot of things from there because in some ways that was our foray into settling loans onto our own platform. So there was a lot of learnings that we could take in terms of further developing our strategies for the deployment of capital across the industry as a whole. And then lastly, or the latest vault that we released is what we call the flagship vault. The flagship vault is running a very similar strategy to the prolog vault. The biggest difference is that the flagship vault is a public access vault, right? So we started to realize that the prologue vault, it was very good in identifying a core community and it was very good in like kind of receiving sticky TVL just because, you know, it was very, it was in a very exclusive vault. It was kind of like, you could say, potentially like detrimental to our attempt to increase the TVL of the protocol as a whole. Just because like, in the same way that the prologue NFT was a receipt token, it's almost like a yemenite key into the vault as well.
00:18:34.922 - 00:18:52.306, Speaker A: And the key was getting priced by the secondary market to be anywhere between 0.2 to 0.5 eth. So there was like a 0.2 to 0.5 eth barrier to even depositing into the prolog vaults and the earning yield. So that was really the main motivation for launching the flagship vault.
00:18:52.306 - 00:19:13.548, Speaker A: It was just a way for us to just increase the base of users that we could potentially suck up TVL and as such, reward them back yield. So that's kind of like the progression of how each of the vaults were launched and the motivation behind each of the vaults. But that's how we got to where we are today.
00:19:13.684 - 00:19:39.786, Speaker D: Right. And as far as I understand it, the flagship vault especially has been performing really, really well since its launch. I think it was doing something like 40% APR last time I checked. How do you guys determine, like determine the split between different NFT collections and between marketplaces? Or is it mostly just based off of, based off of opportunity, based off of what's out there on the market?
00:19:39.938 - 00:20:48.264, Speaker C: Yeah. So I guess the first thing to note is flagship and prologue have the exact same strategy. So I know that flagship, I think it's like printing like historical 40% APY in that same tier time period. Prologue has also done that. It's just that log also has like, you know, has a lot more runtime in the past. So I think that that's just like a first caveat in terms of this like, strategy or like where capital gets routed, collections and marketplaces, that's completely done algorithmically, we can get into the technicals of it, but effectively there are a few, like, financial engineering algorithms that determine that, like, try to maximize returns while also minimizing risk on the end user, so risk of bad debt or negative exposure. And there's also other algorithms that try to make sure that the collections are diversified, the marketplaces are diversified, and that the users aren't ever exposed to one marketplace for too long or too much exposure on a single marketplace, as well as just any given collection.
00:20:48.264 - 00:21:17.396, Speaker C: But, yeah, like I mentioned, the two pieces of infrastructure that can kind of roll into that are the pricing infra and the risk infra combined. They effectively spit out what is like the optimal allocation of funds across the entire space. What's the best way to kind of get that yield? And that has resulted probably. I'm not entirely sure, but I imagine we're probably like a top three protocol in terms of native e field on mainnet at the moment.
00:21:17.508 - 00:21:45.360, Speaker D: Yeah, and that's like, that's like a pretty big fucking deal when you, when you like, you kind of just glossed over it. But that's, I don't know, that's huge to me. And I see there's like a pretty big allocation towards Bendav specifically. Is that because of incentives mostly, or is that just a way for you guys to easily deploy without having to kind of wait for offers on some sort of peer to peer platform?
00:21:46.500 - 00:22:27.644, Speaker C: Yeah, that's likely temporary. X two, y two recently migrated their system from like v two to v three. So kind of x two, y two bidding, which usually takes up, let's say, 40% to 50% of the strategy. That's been somewhat offline for the last week and a half. So that's kind of the big reason you've seen a lot more exposure to bend out. You're right in the sense that going to Meddao or let's say, drops one of the p two pool protocols is a really easy way to get yield while you're looking to deploy more capital in the p two p space. So that's what's happening as x two y two is getting migrated.
00:22:27.644 - 00:23:21.678, Speaker C: Bendao is the best place to put that yield. In the meantime, that's, I guess, how the algorithm probably tries to figure out why, you know, or where to best that capital. And that just happens to be bent out in terms of incentives, those are accounted for and they're kind of market sold at the end of the week. We did build an infra for additional vaults where when users choose to spin up our vaults or when we choose to spin up new vaults, we have the ability to not market sell, kind of like the incentive tokens and let users just redeem the incentive tokens themselves. I think that probably begins to look a little bit more exciting as you begin to think about spice Finance as an aggregator, as this layer on top of all these other marketplaces that could potentially begin to direct governance, power and direct liquidity across the space as a whole, instead of just trying to earn yield.
00:23:21.854 - 00:23:45.106, Speaker D: Gotcha. And then on the incentives bit specifically, I guess that's a pretty good segue into. Into blur and what you guys are thinking there. It looks like you have something that's been in the works for a little while. I'm wondering if there's anything you can share about the thought process there, what might be coming if there's something specific to blend. Specifically.
00:23:45.218 - 00:24:50.644, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So there's, I guess, like, the main thing to talk about is just that, as you guys may know, Blur launched a product, a lending product called blend. And it has like, pretty unique mechanisms, but we're very interested in the potential opportunity that it gives our depositors as a source of yield. And then also secondarily, it's also a unique, interesting value proposition in terms of, like, the points that the vault could accumulate and then as such, distribute back to our depositors as well. So something that we've heard as of late, or at least ever since blend or blur launched its blend product, is that a bunch of people want exposure to these blur points, but they've been complaining that it's kind of hard to or complicated to farm these points via lending themselves. So this is like a very clear problem that spice is uniquely positioned to tackle.
00:24:50.644 - 00:25:45.566, Speaker A: And this is something that we want to step in and kind of capitalize on the opportunity that's presented here at blend. As an aggregator, we're pretty agnostic to the protocols that we route to. We really just want to present our users with a good source of yield, no matter where that may lie. And we see blend as a really interesting opportunity for us to aggregate into our system as well. The exact details are going to be released going into the future. The biggest thing that I can reveal is just that it's in the works and we're currently in a sprint to get that product to market. So definitely follow along our Twitter join our discord in order to get the latest updates in terms of where things stand, how you can get in early and how can you take the biggest advantage of the vault when it drops in the near future.
00:25:45.678 - 00:26:09.258, Speaker D: Interesting. So you mentioned people wanting exposure to blur points and that kind of being, because that's like an additional thing that spice would be providing in addition to being a lending aggregator. So it adds another element there. I think that goes even beyond NFT lending to begin with or NFT finance to begin with.
00:26:09.414 - 00:26:52.350, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think like, I mean, the way we really thought about like obviously blend launching was pretty exciting for us. Kind of validated a lot of our beliefs about where the space is going. I think the specific design, which I'm also happy to kind of like dive into, makes it so that in an efficient market there's going to be pretty attractive yield opportunities. Right now, you know, the point farming, let's call it, I mean, just, just the points that users are getting massively subsidizes all the yield and for all the rates across blur lending. So in terms of APY, it's not, I wouldn't. We haven't seen it be as attractive as, let's say, NFT fi or arcade.
00:26:52.350 - 00:27:41.178, Speaker C: And there's also a lot of reasons behind why that might be, but we have kind of identified that one. There are a lot of users who want access to something more automated on top of blend. And the point distribution that blend is giving users is incredibly attractive. I think the way we may think it's worth thinking about it is the same way when we route capital across NFT PI, we get NFT five points they're going to be kicking off. And I'm sure arcade might be doing something similar down the line. We want to be doing the same thing with Blur. It just so happens that because of Blur's valuation and the amount of points they're giving to the lending product and how difficult it is to go out and lend that you're able to farm like honestly a ridiculous amount of points in a pretty quick, short amount of time.
00:27:41.178 - 00:28:14.450, Speaker C: But to do so autonomously is obviously where it really spice shines. Those key pieces of infrastructure that we had built out were built for something like this. Those are really the motivations for building on top. Its also pretty great exposure for us. I think from a marketing side and pr side I think its going to get a lot of users looking into spice. Obviously, NFT finance itself is still a burgeoning field. Mbler, I think has a little bit more mind share than most NFT finance protocols out there.
00:28:14.570 - 00:28:52.302, Speaker D: Do you think its feasible? I guess probably not, given you guys are giving out genuine loans. But do you think it's feasible that some of your lending activity on Blur could be marked as somewhat of like a Sibyl? Or do you think it's possible that some of it doesn't go through to get the incentives? Because I know that they're compared to NFT five at least. I don't think NFT five is doing much to that end. But as far as I know, Blur is still trying to catch some of that activity and getting mislabeled or being someone who gets caught there could be a bit of a bummer, to say the least.
00:28:52.446 - 00:29:27.580, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, that's always like a risk and I think that's something. As we get closer, we're going to advertise around the vault. I can give a quick plug to. There's this group called underground free speech. We have like pretty direct contact with the Blur team and as we understand it, a lot of the decisions they have around, you know, preventing sibling sibyls and whatnot are really around preventing fake liquidity from coming in. So users that end up getting marked are ones that are kind of spoofing chain that are canceling transactions before getting hit and whatnot. So they're users that are looking to get blur points illegitimately.
00:29:27.580 - 00:30:18.178, Speaker C: The entire strategy that we have developed is like a fully legitimate strategy is probably, as they get closer to releasing APIs, probably something that is more likely than not going to be the market efficient strategy, the one that people converge to. And so were not concerned that were breaking any rules on both side because as we know, all the accounts that have been marked and whatnot are players and accounts that have been trying to effectively find loopholes in the system. Everything were doing is really around providing lending in a proper manner. And it just so happens that the proper manner pays a shit ton of points as well. So obviously, like, we're going, we're doing a little bit more research into that and that's something we're going to be advertising around the vault itself. But, yeah, we're not too worried.
00:30:18.274 - 00:30:32.240, Speaker D: Awesome. Good to hear. And do you, I don't know if you have an answer to this or if you do, if you're able to reveal, but do you have an idea of like, what kind of yield you guys would be seeing from a strategy like this?
00:30:32.410 - 00:30:57.120, Speaker C: Yeah, so im hesitant to give numbers because the range is so wide and the numbers are so ridiculous. But yeah, I think when we first started testing the strategy and obviously the meta is evolving in terms of lending basically day in, day out. But we were looking at implied apys in the thousands just from the blur points that we were getting. Yeah. So theyre pretty ridiculous.
00:30:58.970 - 00:31:09.250, Speaker D: Damn. Okay, that's, that's nuts. Cool. Okay. I was not expecting that high of a number, to be honest. I wanted.
00:31:09.290 - 00:31:15.030, Speaker C: Yeah, that probably, that probably paints the motivation around, like why the points are attractive in the first place.
00:31:15.370 - 00:31:48.416, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I mean, attractive is an understatement, I think. I don't know that that can be matched anywhere with something, with something like this. I want to switch gears a little bit here. Away from blur, we had, well, I guess more broadly about like competition. When I first started looking into spice, what was really interesting to me about it was the fact that a competitor like, doesn't really exist. Like anything that could be considered a competitor would really just add to spice more than anything.
00:31:48.416 - 00:32:15.276, Speaker D: And, you know, now, almost a full year later, I guess we're not really seeing many other, many other people enter the space or the niche that you guys are specifically in. Why do you think that is? And also like more specifically, we had Goblin Sachs on not long ago and they were talking about productizing their offering. Do you have an idea of like what that looks like and how that would differ from what you guys are doing?
00:32:15.388 - 00:32:58.180, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'm nothing entirely sure what Goblin Sacks is planning on doing. I know last time we had conversed this was probably close to six months ago. They weren't really looking to do something that we were doing. But I kind of have to talk with, with the team to get a feel for where they're at in terms of why we think that there aren't a lot of players doing what we're doing. The first is it's like really fucking hard. There's a big reason we even went after this problem is that it's probably the, one of the more sophisticated and complicated problems to be dealing with is how do you deploy capital in these ultra complex marketplaces? And weve spoken to some players that are interested in providing NFT yield solutions.
00:32:58.180 - 00:34:00.106, Speaker C: Almost every single time they effectively just ask, how can we route capital to your vaults? How can we just deposit in your vault? Because you guys have done the heavy lifting. Your vaults have already done all the hard work and were okay to pay the fees to get that exposure. So I think the difficulty piece is probably one of the biggest moats there and a big reason why you don't see a lot of players. And then the second piece, I think is just NFT finance honestly doesn't have that much mind share at the moment. I'm very confident that we're going to see competitors down the line, but that's probably going to take place as the winning marketplaces begin to settle out, which I think we're pretty far away from. That blend is probably one of the first marketplaces where we've looked at it and seen that, like with the distribution as well as the product they can, they have, there's not that many improvements that can be made to improve on what they have for that specific target customer. But there are definitely, there's definitely pretty strong room for improvement across the entire NFT finance space.
00:34:00.106 - 00:34:26.244, Speaker C: And I think it makes it pretty difficult to build an aggregator or build just like a simplified yield solution if you don't even know who's going to win. Right? Like the same way someone might build products on top of GMX and arbitrage, going to have to know that GMX is going to be the winning protocol there. And that's just not that clear in that finance space. And I think that probably prevents a lot of players from even beginning to tackle the problem.
00:34:26.372 - 00:34:40.791, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, lending protocols are a dime a dozen these days. I think. I think a lot of people don't realize how many smaller ones exist there that may not have too much of a marginal improvement over what already exists.
00:34:40.975 - 00:34:41.815, Speaker C: Do you?
00:34:41.967 - 00:35:14.640, Speaker D: And then for like, because obviously we need time for the space to mature and for these tools to find greater, like product market fit. Where do you see spice fitting into that? Do you see, I guess it's kind of like a chicken and egg problem, but do you see spice as bridging the gap for users who have never touched NFT five before or people who are maybe already familiar, who are looking to, I guess, outsource their activity a little bit once they're already familiar with something like blend or NFT five.
00:35:14.940 - 00:35:16.120, Speaker C: You want to take this?
00:35:16.500 - 00:36:12.550, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really a combination of both. We think that the deepest need is going to be from people who are outside of NFT five, let's say more. So leading into the defi scene. Who wants to gain exposure to the space? There's like a variety of reasons. One, potentially you believe in the same ethos as we do with NFT finance kind of expanding to many opportunities and a larger tam going into the future. So you just want to be involved with that to whatever capacity, whether or not that's like exposure to air drops, exposure to yields, whatever, and then secondarily in the same vein, NFT fi, as it currently exists right now, is a source, is one of the highest sources of yield on ETH mainnet that you can get. So if you don't believe in this space and you are just a mercenary, there's still value to be gained from participating and providing liquidity into the space as well.
00:36:12.550 - 00:37:46.340, Speaker A: Like UWU was saying, a bunch of like exposure to the space is not simple, right? So we provide those users that being like the DeFi users who are less familiar with a way to gain exposure without going through all of the work that they may need. We've heard from doing interviews with a bunch of lenders in this space that lending, at least on your own, is more or less a full time job when it comes to sifting through the loans, analyzing which ones are good, and then also rebalancing your portfolio. Costly because it's very, can be a somewhat volatile space to kind of operate in. So that kind of leads into the second point of my answer, which is, secondarily, I think that there is still a value proposition that spice can provide for current lenders in this space that being just like a way for them to potentially allocate some portion of their funds that they're already lending out into the space, into a more hands free type of passive opportunity to earn yield while still remaining, keeping their exposure within the space, if that makes sense. So if you're a lender and you still want to play around with strategies that you developed, maybe you take some portion of your funds, do that, and then the remainder of the funds that you would already allocate to loans you can just deposit into spice and not have to worry about constantly, you know, managing that portion of your portfolio. So it's really like twofold. I think we target both types of users.
00:37:46.340 - 00:38:11.194, Speaker A: I would say that what we're especially interested in is targeting the users from the outside. Right? Because I think that, and I know that you're involved in this pseudo analytic, but like NFT finance can be some, somewhat of an echo chamber and a bubble. And I think that what is very important that we're hoping to do is bring outside capital in the, which is like a main motivation for this blur vault as well.
00:38:11.282 - 00:38:59.836, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, totally agree. And I mean, in terms of like for like existing lenders, even like the more savvy ones, like for what you can make with an active, like, lending strategy versus 40% from just throwing it in spice and not having to think about it again is not a bad trade off. Like, even that is hard to outperform with, with like stringent risk parameters, especially given the time you have to put in, I think. So that's, you know, something, something every lender will have to consider at some point. I think I do want to. I realize we touched base on prologue way at the beginning on the NFT collection, but I didn't get to ask what's left to come for the NFT collection. If you guys have any other plans for prologue holders in the future?
00:38:59.908 - 00:39:41.236, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's always plans that we're working on. We always want to continue to add value to prolog holders where we can. Just because, you know, these guys are like our core community members, right? Like I see tum tum here. I know that ND, Norl, MK, these guys all have prologues. They're very active in our community and they've been supporting us for a while. So it's always like within our best interest to support and provide value to those core constituents where we can. But that being said, we want to make sure that the products that we drop, for example, the prologue leverage feature, is something that provides value and is what they need from the jump.
00:39:41.236 - 00:39:59.050, Speaker A: And so we don't want to prematurely promise any kind of features. But what I can promise is that we'll always be looking to add value to the users, whether or not that's for the current product or I, any future products that we kind of bring online into the future, maybe even outside of vaults.
00:39:59.170 - 00:40:09.586, Speaker D: Right, right. Is there, I mean, we talked a lot about incentives today. Have you guys thought about a broader incentive structure for spice in the near future?
00:40:09.778 - 00:40:59.236, Speaker C: Yeah, we do. I think a fair amount of thinking on this. It's largely informed on what that end product looks like. And that's something that obviously, like we haven't revealed yet. But yeah, like proper incentive structures as well as like taking advantage of the position wherein as an aggregator is both, you know, like a premier liquidity router, a protocol that's able to control liquidity, you know, able to collect governance tokens and whatnot. You know, that's something that, like I said, we've thought about pretty heavily. There's a few ideas from some of our community members that we've been playing around with, but I think like our approach is really make sure we build a good product first, make sure we really iterate and get something off the ground that works well for users and then nail in an incentive structure that gets that flywheel rolling.
00:40:59.236 - 00:41:48.432, Speaker C: The last thing we want to do is build out an incentive structure that locks us into a specific type of product. And that product isn't really the best thing we could have built because we built the incentives around that product. And now you have to deal with there being economic incentives that are driving users in the wrong direction. So we try to approach incentives, I think, rather thoughtfully. We don't want to do so prematurely, which could end in the demise of a protocol. And that's probably one of the biggest lessons that we've taken away, just playing around in Defi. As much as incentives and decentralization are at the very core of crypto, it's also something that can, if done incorrectly and prematurely, can absolutely cripple protocols.
00:41:48.432 - 00:41:58.272, Speaker C: And so we just want to be very careful with how we do this, and we want to make sure that when we do it, it's done in such a manner that, you know, it's like a full win win situation for everyone involved.
00:41:58.376 - 00:42:44.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I think when, when you're really thinking about the potential token or some kind of decentralization in the form of governance, what a lot of people we talk to speak on is kind of thinking about the weakness within the protocol and kind of seeing how that token or that incentive structure can provide a solution or make that weakness less noticeable. When it comes to all the different strategies on spice, the ones that you have now and the ones in the future, what would be that weakness that you guys think is kind of plaguing the protocol right now?
00:42:44.850 - 00:43:46.884, Speaker C: That's a good question, Duncan. You can definitely step in if you have anything. I think one area that we are pretty cautious about in terms of building out incentive structures, I wouldn't say this is, I mean, I guess it could be considered a weakness, but it's also one of the areas that we try to put the most time into. And in many ways, it's our strength above what anyone else could build. Nfts tend to be very liquid, and there's, they're like, rather easy, I would say rather easy. Like, the smaller the market cap, the more liquid into the collections you go, the more manipulable those collections are, the more volatile they are in terms of price movement, in terms of what users are doing with that collection. And so it's something that we want to avoid, is kind of a situation where end users can take advantage of whatever incentive structures we have in order to route liquidity to a collection that should have liquidity routed to them, for example.
00:43:46.884 - 00:44:49.248, Speaker C: Or, I mean, like, most of this gets determined algorithmically, but at the end of the day, the algorithms are also determined by liquidity itself. And so something we just want to be very careful of is preventing our systems from kind of exposing themselves to, let's say like hostile market capture by malicious users that are trying to extract value. That's kind of a lot of the work that we've put into the infrastructure that we've built out. A lot of behind the scenes work. We don't like talking about it too much because a lot of those algorithms are proprietary, the same way you might have it on, let's say like ribbon finance. But it's definitely like one of the biggest failure points. I think in NFT finance generally you're playing around with fairly liquid collections and the same way Aave doesn't lend against super liquid shit coins because oracles don't really do a good job of protecting against bad debt.
00:44:49.248 - 00:45:22.196, Speaker C: If you're building with Oracle list designs, then you have to take that into account. You have to understand that there are those risks. And I think that's probably the biggest weakness of just like playing around in NFT finance. I think it's like biggest area that users can get burnt and it's the place that we put the most work into as a team. And so I think incentives are really going to be built around that in mind, trying to prevent that from happening, but also having some kind of positive feedback loops that various communities or individuals who want liquidity can get in.
00:45:22.268 - 00:46:20.570, Speaker B: Awesome. And when you're thinking about the iteration of the products that you guys offer, you guys have brought out like a bunch of different vaults. How much do the strategies differ and what kind of iteration do you see coming in the future? Because the goblin Sachs guys, when they were discussing their product, their product faces more on like something like a non custodial bot that kind of works for a user. Do you see a future where some, like you guys lean into some non custodial things? Do you see different kinds of deployment? Maybe both sides of the liquidity, maybe like pulling nfts and ethereum, do you see yourselves deploying it in different places, maybe in strategies with like, wasabi, with options? What, what kind of future iterations have you guys been the most interested in recently?
00:46:21.150 - 00:46:39.130, Speaker C: Yeah. So wasabi is definitely on the table for us. We've been in contact with them and I think we have a, like, we've announced a partnership with them. Yeah. So we're definitely not limited to lending in that sense. Like, I think generally just NFT finance as a whole is on the table for us. I think we like to think about our products as broad as possible.
00:46:39.130 - 00:47:32.276, Speaker C: One of the good positions of being an aggregator is we get a lot of information about all the products that are coming out there. And as a protocol, I think were probably some of the more entrenched users. So we have a pretty good idea of where the intricacies lie. And so that also means in terms of building our products around where capital should get routed, what that strategy might be maybe just offering vaults to, let's say, just a single bidding bot, or letting users spin up vaults with their own set strategies, with their own set parameters. Those are all things that are on the table that we've considered. So I think that's to say like there's definitely for spice, at least there's nothing that we consider to be off the table, just given how much exposure we have to all the various different types of products out there. And we have a pretty good idea of what needs improvement, what users want.
00:47:32.276 - 00:47:48.960, Speaker C: So I think some of the next iterations for spice that kind of come, I would say, toward the end of the summer are probably going to be pretty surprising for a lot of users because we've been really working on some kind of novel designs in the space and we haven't limited ourselves to just nft.
00:47:49.540 - 00:48:17.670, Speaker B: Awesome. That's great to hear that you guys are always focusing on iterating. We're leaning into the last few minutes, I don't want to keep you guys too long. We're going to lean into some like hot takes and more interesting questions about you guys personally. If you want to give us both of your kind of dream pfps other than the prologue pfps, of course. Are you ape guys or punk guys?
00:48:17.750 - 00:48:23.980, Speaker C: I'm definitely a punk guy. I kind of see them as the Ogs and that's definitely. Yeah, I think I've always been aligned with that.
00:48:24.800 - 00:48:27.664, Speaker A: I'm a lady Remilia world order guy.
00:48:27.792 - 00:48:46.550, Speaker B: Awesome. Awesome. And I know you spoke on this a bit about the kind of iterating for l two s in the nft fight ecosystem. Are you guys eth maxis? Are you guys multi chain guys? What kind of camp do you guys reside in? The personally?
00:48:46.630 - 00:49:02.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I'm chain agnostic, but I also am, I have very high respect for what EVM and what ETH has done for crypto. And so I think even though I'm chain agnostic, most of the time, I'm going to be interacting with ETH based chains.
00:49:02.750 - 00:49:28.466, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm also like a multi chain feature type of person. But I think that honestly, my future or my thesis is that like in the MiDi, in the. In the medium term, we'll have a multi chain future. I think long term, everything consolidates into. Into one chain. So there'll be like one settlement chain and then everything else will kind of be built on top of that. ETH is probably looking like the best bet for that future as of now.
00:49:28.466 - 00:49:34.450, Speaker A: But, you know, that isn't to exclude any value that's created until that potentially happens.
00:49:34.570 - 00:49:50.110, Speaker B: This is completely random, but I just thought of this. Are you guys even taking a glance at the whole ordinal stuff? Do you think there's a chance they build, like, a lending borrowing market in that ecosystem? Do you find it interesting at all?
00:49:50.450 - 00:50:17.188, Speaker C: Yeah, we got put onto some project that's trying to build lending on ordinals. I don't know how feasible it is. I minted a single. Minted an ordinal. But besides that, I haven't really been kind of too tapped into the ecosystem because I'm like, even though I'm chain agnostic, it seems like my twitter feeds a little bit east echo chamber centric. Yeah.
00:50:17.204 - 00:50:40.772, Speaker A: There's a guy in our community that's putting us on some ordinal stuff and some ordinal lending stuff, but it seems like, as far as I know, they're all rugs. So there hasn't been anything that's been robust that's been built out yet. And, you know, where we follow is where the volume kind of pops up. So, although we'll have, you know, some interest in that space for now, it's just like, keeping an eye on it is where is where we stand.
00:50:40.876 - 00:50:50.908, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, I appreciate you guys taking the time. Thank you guys so much for coming on last few minutes. Do you guys want to do anything we missed? Anything you guys want to mention?
00:50:51.004 - 00:51:11.810, Speaker A: No, I think that's pretty much covered it. Ollie, was nice to catch up with you again. It's always a pleasure talking to you guys about this stuff. Love the exit liquidity podcast and what you guys are up to. All I say is that things are going to get shaken up at Spice within the next month, month and a half. So definitely follow along. We're hoping to restart things and shake things up.
00:51:11.810 - 00:51:24.418, Speaker A: So new vaults, new community, new people coming in. That's the goal. So definitely follow our twitter if you're interested and then also come onto our discord so that you don't miss any of the alpha that we're going to drop there.
00:51:24.514 - 00:51:25.330, Speaker D: Great stuff.
00:51:25.450 - 00:51:25.730, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:25.770 - 00:51:27.830, Speaker D: Excited for that. Definitely be watching along.
00:51:29.170 - 00:51:29.786, Speaker A: Cool.
00:51:29.898 - 00:51:31.750, Speaker D: Thanks, guys. Really appreciate this.
00:51:32.770 - 00:51:33.258, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:51:33.274 - 00:51:43.710, Speaker B: Thanks so much, guys. Thanks for everybody that was listening. We're going to be dropping some clips and stuff, and the full episode will be on our twitter. Appreciate you guys coming on.
00:51:44.010 - 00:51:45.066, Speaker A: Thank you, guys.
00:51:45.218 - 00:51:45.850, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
