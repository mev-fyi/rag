00:00:00.240 - 00:00:23.958, Speaker A: I don't know if Anatoly is autistic enough to really be the leader of a chain. Dude, he's so level headed. It's just too normal. I feel like Solana the past couple months has been rivaling Ethereum, and a lot of different metrics are outright beating it. And there hasn't been a single instance of downtime or outages, I think. I don't think it competes with Ethereum. Like, the thing is, you can't talk about Solana without comparing it back to Ethereum.
00:00:23.958 - 00:00:41.874, Speaker A: And I don't like them. They can coexist. Solana can be the deep in AI meme coin chain, while ethereum has the payments l three, the perp dexs, all the liquidity. Like, that's like a near term future. That makes sense. The problem is Solana faces scalability problem. They did like the pith airdrop and they had some problems then.
00:00:41.874 - 00:00:59.650, Speaker A: This is clearly not ready for like scalable payments infrastructure. And then Mert replies, and he goes, but it's orders of magnitude better than Ethereum. It's like, that shouldn't be the benchmark. The benchmark should be actual products. Why are we comparing back to something that charges $100 when more than five people decide they want to make a swap?
