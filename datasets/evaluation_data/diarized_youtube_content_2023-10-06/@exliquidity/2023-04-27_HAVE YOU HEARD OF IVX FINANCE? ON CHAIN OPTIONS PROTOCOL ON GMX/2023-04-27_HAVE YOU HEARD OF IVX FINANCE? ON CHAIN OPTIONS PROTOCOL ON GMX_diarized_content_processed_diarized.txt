00:00:00.280 - 00:00:29.640, Speaker A: Yeah I think IVX is an interesting one that's coming out pretty soon. It's not out yet and they have no product just yet but they're building their options on top of GMX. So all of the liquidity from GMX hopefully can somehow be utilized in another way with options. I'm keeping an eye on that. But yeah I completely agree with you. I think it's a pretty untapped space at the moment and it's just a matter of time I think, before they really do well. I think the total value locked up for all options is like 300 million or something.
00:00:29.640 - 00:00:56.960, Speaker A: I don't know. Let me have a look. Maybe less than that. Maybe like 150 million tvl yeah it's like a pretty low. Yeah it's all built on top of GMX so I would have a look at that but yeah 100 5200 mil tvl I mean it's so so small and I think the more competition, the more innovation. So it's just a matter of time. Yeah, yeah.
