00:00:00.360 - 00:00:06.850, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:07.510 - 00:00:47.340, Speaker B: All right. Episode 13 Exit Liquidity got our second or first guest with Ali involved. We had matt on with just me, but we got our second official guest, the one and only Brenna Renato from Nexo. Big, big character in NFT fi, at least to me, I think, like, you were one of the first people I talked to other than Ali about NFT fi in general. And, yeah, appreciate you coming on. Appreciate you even answering my DM's and stuff.
00:00:47.720 - 00:01:11.150, Speaker C: No, man, super bold. Thanks for the invite. Love the naming of the podcast. Have to say, pretty abbreviated stuff. And. No, yeah, I mean, super excited as well. I've been here, I've talked about this new vertical, who I talked with Ali as well before, but this vertical is super, like, I don't know, crazy stuff happening in this bear market and.
00:01:11.150 - 00:01:12.786, Speaker C: Cool, cool.
00:01:12.898 - 00:01:32.226, Speaker B: So first couple questions. We're gonna get into the semi big stuff about you. You know, kind of how you got involved in the space specifically, like NFT five, because it's such a small niche, like how you even came across it, how you joined Nexo, kind of that history there.
00:01:32.378 - 00:01:58.698, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'll get back to 2017. One friend told me, this is a blockchain. This is the future. My friend is like kind of genius in mathematics and this stuff. So I say, okay, yeah, I will trust you, will research and learn more about it at the time. You know, there is no infrastructure, just two or three coins in December that year.
00:01:58.698 - 00:02:45.440, Speaker C: Everything pumps crazy. And they say, hey, okay, this is type of a bubble. I will exit my positions and do my life as a normal, normal person. The pandemic in 2020 started and I spend this many years, okay, I will be more involved with this stuff and see all the defi happening in that year and say, okay, I want to be here full time. What I can do? Join Bangladesh Dao and start contributing to employee. Thanks to Bangladesh, I meet some friend who introduced me to the c five world. At the time, I had never interact with sales with this platform that doesn't exist right now.
00:02:45.440 - 00:03:03.840, Speaker C: And, you know, 2021 was this NFT summer. I started doing my digital activities part time, flipping, winning all of this crazy stop happening and saw position on Nexo for doing nfts. And I say, okay, I was doing nfts. Let's do it for a company.
00:03:04.630 - 00:03:15.022, Speaker B: What, what specifically were you doing with nfts? Like, at first with Nexo, was NFT fi even, was it even called NFT fire? Were you just not looking at pfps.
00:03:15.206 - 00:03:52.430, Speaker C: The position was NFT. So really, really, I have the screenshot, I think. And the first things we start, we started like talking was NFT fact. This was March 2022. At that time there was like only I think four projects, you know, NfT five maybe, even though robs and arcade. And we start like having this, this Friday to restrict more of the vertical tons of project at the time, like in beta or like just without a waiting list. And there seem ways to start doing loans.
00:03:52.430 - 00:04:03.904, Speaker C: In May 2022 we did a, yeah, one $2 million loan against mega or some me punks don't remember.
00:04:03.952 - 00:04:06.392, Speaker B: Well, until what protocol were you using?
00:04:06.576 - 00:04:48.494, Speaker C: Two pill mostly. But yeah, I mean, that was like my first interaction with the vertical. Talking with tons of the founders, tons of the people there and seeing that we tried to do with some friends and space in October 2022. And just ten people in the space, right. And now you see the space. I think you, Aliyah, maybe you also have joined some of them and you have 100 people, 200 people maybe. And for me, it's like a sign that the vertical, although it's niche, it's super small so far it's growing.
00:04:48.494 - 00:04:53.590, Speaker C: And that also is signaling this road too.
00:04:54.410 - 00:05:08.670, Speaker B: Is Nexo usually on like the edge of crypto in general? Are there like, is that like a ethos there? Is there like a sentiment of trying new things?
00:05:09.690 - 00:05:23.020, Speaker C: I would say so, you know, gonna revolve so much of what they think are doing there, but I think that we have, in general definitely doing stuff there as well.
00:05:24.560 - 00:05:36.900, Speaker A: So what do you like, I guess with, with Nexo specifically, what is your, like, day to day look like these days? Like, are you, are you constantly like scoping for opportunities or new projects or what is that like?
00:05:37.600 - 00:06:16.598, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a mix of research, new project. I think each week you have two, three projects pumping or starting to launch. My feeling in the last, I don't know. In all this year I had this feeling also monitor our loan book. We have around three $4 million actively rolling over in NFT market loans. And you know, with blur happening with this crazy stuff that nfts are more fungible than some shitcoin. Sometimes it's important to have like this active risk management.
00:06:16.598 - 00:06:50.750, Speaker C: So far we have not had more defaults or something, but always trying to be cautious of what we are doing, how we are doing loans and monitoring our balance sheet and the third party maybe trying to see ways or we can interact with other verticals. You know, maybe the first one was this NFT finance stuff, this NFT landing, sorry. But you have new stuff happening. You have perpetuals now you have amms, you have derivatives also happening and potentially explore similar.
00:06:51.050 - 00:07:17.796, Speaker B: Cool. And when you're managing that loan book, I feel like my understanding of doing that, it comes down to a lot of like the pricing of these nfts. I feel like that is one of the hardest aspects. How do you guys kind of go about that? Is there like a sweet spot in terms of like LTV that you guys try and hit and kind of return that you are pursuing in some way?
00:07:17.828 - 00:07:17.996, Speaker A: Yes.
00:07:18.028 - 00:07:43.800, Speaker C: I mean this is for our treasury. We have so not doing DJN loan to own loans. We try to, you know, Lido can be four or 5% which by to be on top of it as a way to get an additional premium. And there, I mean our sweet spot is not the 70% of the way, it's much lower and there.
00:07:45.260 - 00:07:50.212, Speaker B: Have you seen that like kind of like demand for that growing or.
00:07:50.356 - 00:08:15.234, Speaker C: Oh yeah, yeah. I mean I think demand growing in each. I mean at the beginning, you know, you have now pans at 75% APR which is if you compare it with a bank in Peru, it's like ridiculous. Advanced charge. You hear, I don't know, 1112. So having this, this different collection I had seen were defaults in general. Talking in general.
00:08:15.234 - 00:08:42.660, Speaker C: Of course in I don't know, in other collections like non blue chips someone saw with a ruler. You have like this sentiment attached to the collection. I mean I am the holder. I like my PFP. I don't want to sell it. But I have seen this like in some way evaporate, have to say in Morgan with premiums being more specific. Someone saw what you have like this.
00:08:42.660 - 00:09:40.570, Speaker C: If you're like nonetheless NFT. But you like ranked eight, 8000, you get a premium. Now with this has disappeared. You have like more, more stuff trading as floor and some specific trades are more valuable but seeing growing growth in each category, fluorization of these, the rare ones as well. We have maybe one of the grail assets in our loan book at the moment. But if you see how the market has changed, I mean generally speaking you have like peer to pool models doing around 60 70% of the world market. You know they have of course their, their advantages against a peer to peer model which is more, which has more fraction in doing the long and settlement and trying to figure out correct terms.
00:09:41.390 - 00:09:53.246, Speaker B: Which model do you think is inevitably going to be more useful and successful or peer to peer or do you think there's going to be a mix that happens.
00:09:53.398 - 00:10:48.666, Speaker C: It's a good question. I think a mix will be good. You have like really rare nfts, you know, Alden new Alvalde who might be more and more interested the holders to have tailor made terms maybe in a specific world who can secure the, any potential defyres hack or something build to pool I think will be most useful for these floor based nfts or maybe mid level nfts. And however I am seeing now new models, you know, sodium another platform for trying to make models more mixed where you can like have a specific pool. And at the end I think it's, it's a positive for the, for the wall ecosystem. My view is like you don't have, you have tons of lenders because it's easy for a lender to pitch. Okay.
00:10:48.666 - 00:10:59.470, Speaker C: You get two, three x Lido returns possibly maybe more. But it's needed an education on the, on the borrower site, right?
00:11:00.250 - 00:11:00.722, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:00.786 - 00:11:10.870, Speaker C: Because it's difficult to say. Okay. I will lose my NFT. Something can happen and this stuff I think should be located. Cool.
00:11:11.410 - 00:11:12.950, Speaker B: So I was question.
00:11:13.530 - 00:11:49.840, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious to hear because in our last call we had way back when we talked mostly, I mean pretty much only about like NFT. Fine. That's like probably most is going to be about as well. But I'm pretty curious to hear a bit more about like some of the other stuff you spend your time on. Like I know you're, you're pretty research heavy. You do some vc stuff as well. How does, how does all that kind of like work together and like are you, are you like mostly just in that one niche right now and does everything kind of revolve around that or does some of your other stuff dip into, dip into other areas as well?
00:11:50.390 - 00:12:27.560, Speaker C: No, I mean I think research on these can come. They of course NFT is a good component but you have different verticals. You know someone some months old ordinals stuff happening on bitcoin and what it would an interesting use case. I don't know if you guys are kind of max or something, but I think a good potential there as well. And things on fashion and music as well. It's something like also keep part of my day in figuring out ways to make stuff there. But a good component is the NFT landing.
00:12:27.560 - 00:12:48.390, Speaker C: The stuff is growing really good and on the venture busy stuff also is bringing deals. I think I talked with you a little. Okay. I really see tons of potential in Latin America in terms of world startups. So way to reach this gap is doing, doing this, right?
00:12:48.470 - 00:13:25.438, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I think a lot of people, especially me, I'm not as well versus as Ali is in the latin american ecosystem. I think Ali, his Internet had a messed up a bit, but we'll just keep. Keep it running. But in, like, Latin America, he'll be able to join back. But in Latin America specifically, like, if you want to touch on, like, you know, where you're from, kind of how you see the community, the ecosystem, like, in real life within Latin America, how does that look like for people who are unaware?
00:13:25.614 - 00:14:11.764, Speaker C: No. The stuff is pumping massively in each country. I think Argentina is maybe the biggest one. But you have Colombia, you have Peru, you have Chile, which if you recall, I don't know, five, four years ago, it was maybe two, three, four enthusiasts in different parts of the series. And now you have meetups, at least in Peru, and I know in Argentina as well. Bi weekly, weekly, basically just one, two, three meetings with people trying to understand ecosystem, to learn more about this stuff happening. You know, crypto is so broad that you can, like, get lost when you just leave the trading side of using an exchange going with a perpetual.
00:14:11.932 - 00:14:25.360, Speaker B: Do you think it comes from, like, is it easy to use? Is regulation, like, clear and people know what's exactly gonna happen? Are you able to, like, pay for stuff? You're in your day to day with crypto, how does that look like?
00:14:25.980 - 00:14:37.320, Speaker C: Not so far. I see regulation as always. Sorry. It's, like, behind the technology. This happens also fintech, like, fintech web does. We've to. Sorry.
00:14:37.320 - 00:15:22.850, Speaker C: It's happening in crypto web blockchain. I know, in chill, in Argentina. Sorry. You have, like, this exchange problem is regulated how much you can exchange. And when I went there, you can exchange stables or bitcoin, two pesos in a bill to pill way to signal. And in some stores, you can purchase with crypto, you have this QR code where you can scan and pay with any currency. And in Peru, some stores are approaching this, connecting maybe a local wallet or international crypto exchange QR code.
00:15:22.850 - 00:15:49.890, Speaker C: And I think it's happening. It's still too niche. I mean, but I think this also can help people. You know, if you see a QR code saying, okay, pay with crypto and low of whatever exchange. Some people who are not maybe in the ecosystem can, like, ask questions. I don't know, what is this? And hopefully the guy in the store can kind of, like, on board them, right?
00:15:50.310 - 00:16:03.246, Speaker B: Yeah. Have you had to, like, have you experienced that onboarding process yourself for, like, family, friends? Has that reached their attention? Yet or is it still. They still don't know what you're doing?
00:16:03.398 - 00:16:25.180, Speaker C: No, it's difficult. It's time to families. Okay, what are you doing? Because they have any conversation with family or so you difficult explaining you are doing just to say specifically loans again. Monkey pictures in the Internet. It's crazy. I never mind doing this when I would like to study university.
00:16:25.800 - 00:16:27.352, Speaker B: What did you study in university?
00:16:27.496 - 00:16:50.850, Speaker C: Finance. Like finance, rational finance. I came from venture capital and it's difficult to tell them. Today I made a loan, I don't know, $2 million. Again, one golden monkey. It's crazy. Sounds crazy because, you know, you have to explain maybe the metaverse, then what is defi then what is nfts? And it discount takes you, I don't know, one long conversation.
00:16:50.850 - 00:17:15.531, Speaker C: Yeah, I had onboard a few, but more in the times where, you know, you have like maybe interesting deals in the steels bull market mostly. But based on this, right on the inflation is pumping in North America. Let's, let's do some. Don't. Don't lose wealth and invest on something that pays you more.
00:17:15.715 - 00:17:24.875, Speaker B: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about your PFP specifically. Is that. I haven't seen it before. Is it like a one of one or is that a project?
00:17:25.027 - 00:17:50.140, Speaker C: No, no, it's a derivative. I mean, I purchased some playoff rabbit earth nft back in the bull market. I was expecting, you know, three turn x because it's the company playboy behind. That doesn't happen. Well, I like, I like the NFD. And one peruvian guy has a podcast, crypto and blockchain and this stuff. And when you participate, he gives you a one.
00:17:50.140 - 00:17:57.424, Speaker C: Well, so. So he grabbed my NFT, put it on the blockchain with its changes and have it.
00:17:57.572 - 00:18:01.300, Speaker B: Awesome. That's pretty cool. I think it suits you pretty well.
00:18:01.600 - 00:18:08.304, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, it's really cool to happen. I mean, you could.
00:18:08.352 - 00:18:25.250, Speaker B: Have you done any loans against any one on ones? What are the main projects that you guys are loaning against other than like punks? Is there anything other than punks, apes or maybe squiggles that you're loaning against blue chips?
00:18:25.410 - 00:18:31.950, Speaker C: Top ten, mostly blue chips. All of these.
00:18:32.690 - 00:18:42.314, Speaker B: Have any of them dropped out of that, you know, list for you guys and, you know, had other ones replaced them or is it pretty consistent?
00:18:42.402 - 00:18:43.338, Speaker C: What do you mean?
00:18:43.514 - 00:18:58.440, Speaker B: For instance, like moonbirds, they face like a pretty decent drawdown in the past few months. Do they fall out of your category for lending and maybe something like Memeland or something else, you know, kind of climbs back into what you guys are comfortable learning against?
00:18:59.300 - 00:19:47.478, Speaker C: That's a good question. I think that I like moon builds, but yeah, as you said, they was punished a lot in these past months. They have not like drop out. But it's more difficult to do alone because you know, if the, if the asset is, I don't know, four or five years either 50% LTV, its two, three and might be for size stuff being a bit small. But if you check the demand in terms of collection, you have, most of the board tapes are like having the highest demand in terms of NST fans as well. And with squiggle, with credentials, with skills in particular, it's difficult to compete of squiggled out on the other side doing.
00:19:47.534 - 00:19:57.606, Speaker B: This NFT, do you think that's good for the ecosystem? Something like squiggles Dow? Because I wasn't aware of that until last week when Ali was telling me a bit about it.
00:19:57.718 - 00:20:26.690, Speaker C: No, for me when it first came out, I mean you have this problem with NFT. You don't have liquidity. That's why NFT finance exists. And if you have the dao doing this, for me, it's a win to win. Let's say the loan is paid, the Dow gains extra money to make an event or do something else. And if they default, they grab an asset for the treasury at a lower balance, at a lower price. Sorry.
00:20:26.690 - 00:20:45.984, Speaker C: Without hurting much, the floor price. And it's positive for the holder as well. Right. You have like this, just a holder now that you can get liquidity easily and doesn't have to dump the fluor if you need to delete.
00:20:46.152 - 00:21:29.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you think this is something that more projects should start to implement? You think it's better or you think it should just be kind of more open to like the free market of NFT five to kind of set the standard, I guess, of how much these nfts are worth because it's kind of like with squiggles, it's almost like they're setting an artificial floor for what these nfts would be worth. I understand that it's variable, they change it every now and then, but yeah. Do you think this is something that more projects should implement, especially the blue chips or do you think it's better to just let the free market decide something like this?
00:21:29.550 - 00:22:15.660, Speaker C: I would say it's a good positive. Yeah. They are like in some way trying to set an APR, maybe a maximum APR. Right. But you have other participants who can of course, outbid base, maybe going higher LGB and maybe higher APR as well. And if you can see like what is happening with blur and opensea that they drop out the royalty fees, maybe some, probably, maybe not the blue chips, because they have busy investment and they have ways to monetize withdrawals and so on. Mid level players, I think with quite a strong balance sheet, it's a way for them to get additional revenue if they get the goods on, on royalties.
00:22:15.660 - 00:22:41.100, Speaker C: I see Sapi sales, I think do something with automated market makers, these Ammsdez for the community, which is also something I like a lot, like controlling your own marketplace, controlling the way you can trade and sell the nfts. And yeah, if they can do it, why not? It's decent VPR and you get this additional benefit for the holders.
00:22:41.400 - 00:23:30.894, Speaker B: Okay. All right. A little bit of technical difficulties from Molly, but we're back, we're back in action. Let's get into like the marketplace stuff. So me personally, me and Ali disagree on this very heavily, and I have somewhat of an alternative take on the marketplaces and NFT fi underneath that in general. And my whole thesis is a very blur, maximalist thesis where I think they hold marketplace market share, and I also think they are just as degenerate as the NFT five community and niche is. And I think they start to lean.
00:23:30.894 - 00:24:12.090, Speaker B: I have no, like, I have no proof or anything really to back this up, but I think they start leaning into NFT Fi because it just seems easy to me for them to grab that ecosystem. So my thesis is they start implementing things like NFT five peer to peer lending, because to me, it's like they're the front page for anyone involved in NFT. The marketplaces are. And it's like, why would you give that up to another protocol? Why would you, like, give that kind of thing up? Ali disagrees. I mean, you can give your main disagreement, Ali, if you want, and then we can hear from why, what Rena thinks.
00:24:12.130 - 00:25:10.314, Speaker A: I just think blur, blur is, I mean, the market share is one thing. If you're assuming that they're going to be able to retain that, then you're probably of the opinion that they're, they're good at what they do with marketplaces, in which case it makes the most sense to stick to that. Like, I mean, you can look at like, x two, y two was a marketplace that introduced lending, but nobody uses the marketplace like it's one of the top, it's one of the top lending platforms. But being one of the top lending platforms isn't, like, right now in my mind, doesn't mean too, too much just given how low volumes are in general. So blur branching out to that in my mind, doesn't really make sense. And I'm also not convinced that Blur is going to be able to retain their competitive advantage in marketplaces in the long run. They have really just incentivization on their side for the time being, I think.
00:25:10.314 - 00:25:21.630, Speaker A: And that can't run forever. Like they have to iterate at some point to have some, some type of remote at some point.
00:25:22.730 - 00:26:18.310, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I like to separate these into markets. The pro djen guys were like in Blur recently in Gemdez, in game Opensea probe as well, and maybe the other 80%, which is like the creators who are like in Opensea are hearted by blur completely. I see the verticalization of the stuff from minting to NFT finance. Yes. But I'm not sure if Blur will retain this competitive advantage. As Alice said, currently you have like two or three whales, Franklin, Macie, something else holding, I don't know, tons of the volume, tons of the eating in the it. And if something else you see appears, I think they will flew to the other protocol to gain APR.
00:26:18.310 - 00:26:54.690, Speaker C: Nobody knows so far. If OpenSea Pro will do something similar, will incentivize the, the bids they are saving in some way your activity in the platform. This can be something. And at the end, for me, the competitive advantages in how these marketplaces engage with the, with the projects now. The projects now have the infra to make your own stuff. You have protect to do some way of marketplace aggregation. You have reservoir doing what you can create quickly and marketplace for your project.
00:26:55.070 - 00:26:55.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:55.542 - 00:26:58.890, Speaker C: So if they don't find ways to.
00:26:59.510 - 00:27:08.330, Speaker B: So you think the marketplace sector will start getting broken out by specific projects that want to make their own marketplaces?
00:27:09.030 - 00:27:32.300, Speaker C: I think that will happen if the marketplace doesn't just continue. Okay, we won't pay you royalties. You're just a community for us. And we made the revenue. The project has the infra to do it. They have their communities. I mean if you, if you want to be a holder of moonbeards or doodles, Razukis, you are there for the community.
00:27:32.300 - 00:28:18.080, Speaker C: Not so much for the marketplace intermediary in the middle. They can, with the infra corp, with the current infra, they can do these marketplaces. Yes, it's costly, it takes time. But if you don't find additional value in the, in the marketplaces, it's difficult to have like this test, at least for the pro traders, difficult to have this, this thesis. And there Ali made a good point with XY X. They have not much trading activity, but good stuff happening in the lending side, because at the end, I think they're like different user Persona, you want to call it in some way. The DJ goals get up at 20% profit and say bye.
00:28:18.080 - 00:28:31.160, Speaker C: The lender might be more attached with, you know, if seto defaults. Me, I get for NFT and I am no part of the community. And the messages, at least to sell are quite different. I think.
00:28:33.020 - 00:28:52.902, Speaker A: I've been looking at x two I too, a little bit more recently as like, a lender. And it seems like they have the most, like, degenerate opportunities, honestly. Like, it's not like blue chips, really, like 200 plus percent apy over like three to seven days. Like, just like super short hedges.
00:28:53.046 - 00:28:53.438, Speaker B: It's.
00:28:53.494 - 00:29:32.152, Speaker A: It's an interesting, interesting market there, definitely. But, yeah, no, a lot of good points you made there. I guess, like, that's like kind of a decent, that's like a good segue into. I'm curious as to what your opinion is on the future of, like, NFT communities in general. Because, like, it's clear things are pretty like rag and I guess just like, flexible right now. Like, it didn't take long for blur to take over a good portion of what Opensea had. And all they really had to do was start offering incentives.
00:29:32.152 - 00:30:09.510, Speaker A: And even then, you look at what it's like now and it's like blur has something like 70, 80% of the total trading volume. And like you said, a lot of that is just farmers. So it's, in my mind, it's really, like, up for grabs as to, like, what happens next with the behavior of normal or more normal users than farmers. Do you have any ideas as to where you could see that heading? As we start to get back into more normal or more bullish market conditions?
00:30:11.650 - 00:30:41.474, Speaker C: The 21 market was, as you may know, full degeneracy. You mean something 0.2, you grab a coffee, it's .4 randomly, right? This happened. The fragmentation will continue. I mean, they will have pro markets trying to compete for this in an 80 20, for the 20% of the users, but maybe the 80% of the volume. But I think the long case for NFTs is more like, you know, artists in one side.
00:30:41.474 - 00:31:38.830, Speaker C: Yes, it's happening in or change, maybe, but the gaming stuff, the projects like Reddit, even Trump NFTs, which is a particular market for the, for the supporters of Trump happening. It's crazy talking about drumming, but, but you have like, like these different niches. And even if you see in some way these real world assets going on, chain it, serve. And I think that you won't flip in to housing and it will be, maybe you will need the kind of marketplace, web two marketplace, but where you hold the ownership of the assets. Amazon is trying to do something with nfTs. I don't know what they are doing, but I think more the creator side of things that the marketplace, which is more aligned with the communities will be the one who will lead the Negro bull. Bull market.
00:31:38.830 - 00:32:05.222, Speaker C: Yeah. There will be always institutional funds trying to flip in a news, trying to flip in an event, trying to do some technical analysis in this stuff. But I think the donates are 90% served with blur open C Pro. In terms of analytics, in terms of data aggregation, in terms of access to the wall, to the Walmart marketplace. Right.
00:32:05.356 - 00:32:06.386, Speaker B: That's a good point.
00:32:06.538 - 00:32:07.154, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:32:07.202 - 00:32:11.530, Speaker A: They really just need capital. Yeah.
00:32:11.570 - 00:32:12.426, Speaker B: Utilities and something.
00:32:12.498 - 00:32:33.740, Speaker A: I always like to say, I have one of the Trump, like, gala dinner nfTs. I always like to say that's, that's the one, out of all the digital assets I've owned, the, you know, fungible or non fungible, that's the one with the most utility. Because like, gets me something, you know, like I get to go to dinner with Trump if he's, if I, if that ever ends up happening.
00:32:34.320 - 00:32:57.500, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And you have, like in Mexico, one example of a short time guy who drops a collection and it's based on this creator's economy. Like he is the utility. He has experience in the startups. I know. And he drops a collection. If you want to have a lunch with him or talk with him or etcetera, you have to have the NFT.
00:32:57.500 - 00:33:44.490, Speaker C: And yeah, it's utility. Some people like, like it. I would say in the future, more creators will start doing this stuff. I'm not sure if the fans will just like flipping in their nfts in blur. Other scene that I think would happen is as NFT perpetuals get more traction, which I think they will be, they will do more of their retail trading will go to perpetuals because it's more easy, it's capital efficient, it's the way you can get leverage if you want. Let's say I want to speculate in a mutant instead of paying, I don't know, 11, 12, 15. If I put five, if three, four eggs do it right.
00:33:44.490 - 00:33:46.726, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:46.798 - 00:34:41.349, Speaker A: I used NfT perp for the first time like a couple weeks ago, and I was, I was pretty disappointed to, to be honest. I mean, I definitely waited like longer than I should have to use it. But like, I guess because most of what I do use is peer to peer, peer to peer, and NFT perp is just such like an, at least right now, it's like too imprecise for me to really like, want to use it. Like it's. If you want to hedge. Yeah, it's like a quick, dirty way to get that done. But just given the liquidity and the way they're pricing, I would rather just set my own terms on NFT, fire something else and wait for that to come along, then enter at a market price that's quite off from what the actual market price is.
00:34:41.349 - 00:34:55.716, Speaker A: Among the five or six collections they offer, too. It's still really limited, but I mean, like anything, at least in the space. But, yeah, I definitely agree with you that that's, that's, as that starts to improve, that's gonna be a big one.
00:34:55.748 - 00:34:56.228, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:34:56.284 - 00:35:03.400, Speaker A: It's definitely a lot more like institutional, I think, than the other options.
00:35:04.380 - 00:35:09.908, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah, everything is a complete, I mean, I would show in any.
00:35:09.964 - 00:35:45.106, Speaker B: How do you feel about the oracle choice in terms of like, how these things are being priced? Because I know, like, for instance, Bendao has faced that problem a lot where they use the chainlink oracle. The timeframe on that updating allows for like really messed up liquidations to happen, mass liquidations to happen. But then you'll see like a lot of protocols are using off chain oracles like upshot and other places to get like very quick and accurate price feeds. Where do you think the sweet spot is in terms of that?
00:35:45.258 - 00:36:28.354, Speaker C: I think that the more boost and less, like easy to manipulate, the better. Maybe with chain lane don't remember well they deserve. But if you're just based on fluor and a time weighted average, it's easier, if you're aware, to manipulate. You have like more robots, machine learning based mechanisms which would try to hold the pricing goals. Consider maybe most, most historic data, even consider the trades or the community value for each particular trade. I think that's better for perpetuals in particular. At the end, you know, it's a term of funding rate, how you balance both sides of this virtual amm.
00:36:28.354 - 00:36:58.014, Speaker C: I remember one of the projects in the perpetual market had some problem in, in avata with the fluor. I think budget apes went from 60 to ten e based on the funding, which is crazy. Let's say this happened in main market. Now you have a big week till Denise, which can liquidate tons of people. But I think at the end it's liquidity that have to call more liquidity and they'll liquid the market the better.
00:36:58.162 - 00:37:07.294, Speaker B: Any projects in the perpetuals or derivative space that are doing it better that you like not.
00:37:07.342 - 00:37:14.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean one of them drive three is in, is in, is in. May a testnet stuff.
00:37:14.830 - 00:37:15.974, Speaker B: What's the name of it?
00:37:16.102 - 00:37:17.170, Speaker C: Drive three.
00:37:18.030 - 00:37:22.210, Speaker B: Drive tree. I haven't heard about that one. What are they doing differently?
00:37:23.480 - 00:37:52.198, Speaker C: They are focusing more on gamification on how the perpetuals work. Other project who caught my eye a lot is sim filters. They are doing perpetuals but with a thinner model. So you just swipe right and left. Super, super duper. But I think this can be super, can create these dopamine loops. So yes, you can stay 30 minutes swiping live.
00:37:52.198 - 00:37:55.930, Speaker C: Right. The product gets tons of volume. Right.
00:37:56.950 - 00:37:59.982, Speaker B: And so when you swipe left and right, you're entering positions.
00:38:00.086 - 00:38:06.650, Speaker C: Yeah. You swipe left, right, low. You swipe left. Sure.
00:38:07.310 - 00:38:09.810, Speaker B: That's actually, actually kind of like that.
00:38:10.150 - 00:38:12.086, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:38:12.198 - 00:38:14.090, Speaker B: I haven't heard of that one. What's it called?
00:38:14.670 - 00:38:15.970, Speaker C: Sim futures.
00:38:16.600 - 00:38:30.740, Speaker B: Futures. Interesting. I don't, I don't have either of those two on my, on my 30 pages of NFT fun. Have you done, have you looked into like the financial NFT stuff like with that rebus is doing?
00:38:31.600 - 00:38:31.992, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:32.016 - 00:39:16.710, Speaker B: And some other. They're trying to like package rc twenties into these nfts. You think there's any use case there? Especially with like I feel like because a lot of NFT lending is like just looking at it as like a regular loan and nothing more and nothing less and seems like there could be something there because you look at it, look at these financial nfts the same way. And the reason I like revest is because it's just a cool design of the NFT itself and it's completely tradable on secondary. I don't, I just don't know who's going to be using it that often. What do you think about those financial nfts in general? Like rap?
00:39:18.010 - 00:40:11.740, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's super cool happening. I mean in the future I think there will be compensability between both sides within financial nfts and NFT finance. But we are not, not there yet. I saw some project doing liquid staking positions of ether staging ether with nfts so you can get for example, an auto repaying loan. You get the yield from Eve and you can take a loan based on your nfts to do some individual firm and get the 4% lido as a prepayment of a loan and some stuff like that. But it is difficult to price for this stuff, just the units of positions. It's complex because they have some mechanism in hope of the position in the project.
00:40:11.740 - 00:40:56.530, Speaker C: One stuff that I think will be, or at least my opinion interesting is having this. Sorry. When you basing in the tokens, you get logged tokens, you can get a secondary market for. I don't know, for the ideals where I get some, any project with a vesting and I can write these tokens in a secondary market possible. Then however we enter in the regulation, the regulatory stuff that if it's possible or is not possible. Yeah, but I think the developments in that vertical are interesting. But again, regulations might be quite challenging.
00:40:57.510 - 00:41:06.262, Speaker B: Have you guys been dabbling at all at nexo into derivatives or perpetuals at all? Or is it still just completely lending?
00:41:06.446 - 00:41:35.856, Speaker C: Not yet. More on the lending. I mean. So hicco, which is in Solana, it's also in testnet, NFT burp is in meta, in beta Baynet I think in the future potentially. But right now, right now we're focusing on lending. And one more vertical that I think could have potential to is the option site, at least for institutional, the options market for nfts. It's.
00:41:35.928 - 00:41:44.514, Speaker B: I think options make more sense for like speculation than perpetuals do for NFT specifically.
00:41:44.562 - 00:42:39.522, Speaker A: Personally, I would argue the opposite actually, because I don't know, I mean, unless someone can find a way to make a protocol where you can sell, where you can sell naked puts and or calls. I know Wasabi has that on their roadmap, but like it's like it shouldn't. I mean you're talking about on, like you're talking about way under collateralized lending in that scenario, which is like a problem of its own for institutions. It totally makes sense because if you're, if you're having to sell covered calls or cash secured puts, then institutions have plenty of nfts and plenty of ETH to earn yield on. But like, I don't know, for someone like me, like if I want to hedge, I'm not going to go and lock up ETH an NFT and like the requisite amount of ETH to do so like it just doesn't make sense for me.
00:42:39.626 - 00:42:40.290, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:40.450 - 00:44:29.720, Speaker C: So yeah, I would say, I mean if you ask all of your friends in crypto, 99% of their, of them, sorry, had trade with leverage in any exchange. So it's easier for the project to pitch, do the same stuff on a decentralized way with jpegs and trade ten x 100 x wherever I with water daves with new them with new dance, with weather collection and for the retail it's attractive as they might not have 60 for a word a day but they without one means and 68 leverage get the trade on. However, for institutions I think they have, as Ali said, the balance sheet. They have the eight and the the NFTs to do these options rate in Wasabi is one of them. Instead of, you know, doing the dean stuff with librarians on the profitable market as options give you. Plus sorry option is difficult to understand if it's maybe difficult to understand for people in finance at the beginning at least, which option to the normal user I think will be super difficult because it's, you know, I think Ali you also came from finance stuff and it's hard to understand the premium, the strike, the duration, the gamma, etcetera. The normal user who if we think NFTs that people who embrace culture and onboard to web3, they may not understand how this works, but they had possibly play with perpetuals with filters in any exchange and they're more used to it.
00:44:33.820 - 00:45:47.900, Speaker B: I just think options like when you have these and my options knowledge isn't that great. But I just imagine that you have more commitment to the underlying liquidity of the NFT that you once it settles like there's going to be a buyer or a seller on the opposite end. And I think that could allow for, I don't know, better price. I feel like in terms of like the loans for nfTs, it's hard to give a good LTV because the pricing like I feel like abacus is what I'm trying to referred to where they have like these pricing tranches that basically people can commit money to like that this is the price of this NFT. And so it just allows for more like, you know, higher ltvs. So I think the options layer itself is not going to be useful for retail. But just like Jones on top of Dopex, it's like that second level where a lot of yield can actually grow off of.
00:45:47.900 - 00:46:00.032, Speaker B: I could be completely off basis, but I don't know, I think I just nfts need more like NFT liquidity just needs more commitment and I feel like options contracts bring that.
00:46:00.216 - 00:46:53.896, Speaker A: I think I'm probably a bit more bearish on NFT options than the both of you teams that are building in that space and the projects and what they're doing. But the problem for me is that like we don't have, we don't even have like product market fit or anything close to it for like like fungible token options. Like you can't really, and like that's not to discount like things like Premier or like Dopex or some of these guys that are building for years now. It's just like with, with crypto, like options just aren't like solved yet. Like we don't fully know how to price them against, even against like Ethereum or like Solana or something. Well maybe not ethereum necessarily, but, but other like less liquid tokens on chain. And it's like when you're trying to do that for nfts that becomes like that much harder.
00:46:53.896 - 00:47:19.692, Speaker A: So like to me, I wouldn't be ready to, I wouldn't be ready to put any bets on like NFT options until I saw more traction. And like fungible token options as an LP, as an institutional LP, especially if I were one, I think it makes a ton of sense. But as a user, I think it would be really difficult to find an edge there like as a buyer personally.
00:47:19.716 - 00:48:09.900, Speaker B: Or I just, I think that the fungibility of like regular shitcoins make perpetuals a better product than options and easier to understand product and like it's just better for a user when it's like there's more fungibility. But I think that the less fungible the token, the more options make sense. That's my idea of it. I don't know if that, I don't believe in options either, totally. Just because like you said, nobody uses options on chain for regular tokens. I just feel like there's a, there's something there in terms of like what that kind of liquidity will bring for like the second layer above it.
00:48:10.920 - 00:49:03.042, Speaker C: I don't know, maybe we are hiring right now. The great history of the borrowers and lenders in NFT finance and I think maybe the best or at least the first type of option. Who will get an option? You see this created default soft, some fonts are already using it. Yeah, it's difficult to price, but I think as the world vertical grows and as the world vertical has more data in terms of over wallet, you could potentially get a better pricing of these three default swaps based on the history of, of the collection of the LTV, of the user as well. But this both calls options. I think it's difficult to beat. I mean I don't see any price as well.
00:49:03.106 - 00:49:17.670, Speaker B: Yeah, back on the lending and borrowing stuff, you said the main protocols you're doing for your loan book is like peer to peer. So I'm assuming like NFT fi, what other protocols are, you know, kind of entering your ecosystem on your loan book?
00:49:18.610 - 00:49:34.550, Speaker C: No. We are right now doing pedal to beat the peel to pull model, you know, has been now I think suffer. Is it nothing against them, but I think each three, four months they have one potential cafeteria creation effect.
00:49:35.290 - 00:49:36.070, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:36.570 - 00:49:52.492, Speaker A: All right, Rena, I was wondering if, you know, because I've asked in like a couple different discords on this, but I haven't gotten any answers. Why is there no, like, why is there no lending market for nouns? I can't find like a single noun on. On offer anywhere.
00:49:52.556 - 00:50:02.916, Speaker C: So that's how the question. I have no theory. I mean, I'm not that's myself yet. I think maybe they are like more. More. I don't know. No.
00:50:02.948 - 00:50:39.510, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's what I was thinking. Is that the reasoning behind that is because no other NFTs like. Well, first of all, not a lot of NFTs have like a governance component, but the ones that do, nouns have by far the most weight. Like, you're voting within a group of what, like 5600 on proposals that will spend millions. And that like, literally decides people's, like, careers. Like that esports. One that went up like that just employed like eight people for a year or two.
00:50:39.510 - 00:50:47.230, Speaker A: So, like, the voting rights are like, really? Yeah, yeah. Now it has like a top tier cs go team. I don't know if you know that.
00:50:47.730 - 00:50:48.234, Speaker B: Really?
00:50:48.322 - 00:50:55.202, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And also cs go is like, like more popular than it's ever been right now, which is crazy because I. Yeah.
00:50:55.226 - 00:50:56.882, Speaker B: They'Re coming out with CS go too.
00:50:56.946 - 00:51:50.810, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But anyways, like my, I can't find an answer to it, but my thinking is that it's because like, the utility that now tab is like, what makes them, them. Like, yes, there's like a big culture component and like the community, as with any NFT, but it's like actively, it's actively used for like these high value proposals. So people don't want to lend them because then they get locked up in a smart contract and they'll miss out on, you know, whatever proposals come up within that period of time. So I was thinking for, and this is like, like voting is one like, case for this, but any really, any like, utility that an NFT has, I think could apply also. But like, if you take nouns for like a super simple example, let's say I go, let's say I'm a noun. I'm a noun holder and I go and borrow against it for 30 days.
00:51:50.810 - 00:52:41.578, Speaker A: During that 30 day period, either someone can their, like, I can put it up for auction or something. I can put the voting rights for that month up for auction and users can come and bid on it. And the costs of that, you can do it a lot of different ways like that can either, it can be a way to incentivize the borrower to get lower rates. It can go protocol, the protocol can take fees from it and feed that back into the token or something like that. But generally the idea is, like when you borrow against an NFT, it gets locked and any like on chain utility it has, is lost for that period of time. So I think that that's why now don't get lent, don't get barred against. And if you created a market for that utility while it's locked up, that's like a pretty easy, like, revenue stream.
00:52:41.578 - 00:53:04.180, Speaker A: Like, I don't know how much people would pay for 30 days worth of one nouns votes, or even for like one vote on a single prop, but I know it's not zero. Like, there's definitely people who would pay for that, if nothing else, than the people who submitted the proposal would just go as like a bribe to buy it. So I don't know. Have you ever thought about something like that?
00:53:05.200 - 00:53:32.006, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there has been. I think this also happened with mumberts. The nesting they have makes them with no much loans or lending activity. Yeah. I think one way to solve this is what you said, or even maybe have this composability as you have with word tapes, with doodles, with, with clonic. Sorry. Where you can get this virtual NFT.
00:53:32.006 - 00:54:12.978, Speaker C: It has a name, but it's like a key access to the NFT. The NFTs in the world where you can get the utility of NFT property is the airdrops or the app staging for artifact, these airdrops, where you could potentially have this access to governance, access to nesting for Moonbeard, but at the same time have a liquid asset. I think it's a good way to see it. And hopefully one of these protocols decide to make this possible. Right? I think they may have to. To connect with the teams or something to, to make it, make it possible.
00:54:13.154 - 00:54:14.922, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:54:14.946 - 00:55:09.840, Speaker B: I mean, do you think that does, that has anything to do with like the fractionalization protocols? Do you think there's a decent market there? I've seen one or two projects that are like where you get some kind of say and like, let's say an NFT is announced that they're going to airdrop and a derivative or some kind of secondary project. There's a market for people that want to like almost like buy now, pay later as well, where you can buy with like half of what you would need to buy it off regular marketplace and then be able to speculate on whatever airdrop happens or you know, all kinds of different things. Do you think there's a market to be had there any protocols you like that are doing fractionalization or buy not pay later?
00:55:10.420 - 00:56:18.940, Speaker C: I think buy not pay later. It's a good way to, I mean, is the next step in as a value proposition and as a region proposition for any NFT lending product maybe in partnership with a marketplace x has this already established I think as well. And yeah, it's interesting, as you said, right. You would with a small down payment get access to the NFT, possibly the utility and stay paid during the time. Our fractionalization I think maybe is the less vertical with less structure at the moment. There is like one project out there working with a, with a crypto exchange having one, two, 3 million trading volume. They try to fractionally fractionalize the NFT as a tradable altcoin for say something.
00:56:18.940 - 00:56:34.710, Speaker C: But the others is super small activity because it's different. It's difficult to price on one side to redeem the NFT at the end and people just hold it. Cause the history.
00:56:34.790 - 00:56:36.610, Speaker B: Are you referring to insert?
00:56:37.150 - 00:57:16.320, Speaker C: No, no, don't remember the name at the moment. They were with penis exchange. No, no, no, can't send you the name on, on Twitter later. And then the point I was like trying to go through is insert because they are like doing fractionalization but adding the component. I mean they're not focusing on making nfts fungible. I think they're focusing on make the NFT lending or NFT finance easier for the holder, for the user.
00:57:16.860 - 00:57:20.892, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the better version of insert is nibble.
00:57:21.076 - 00:57:36.372, Speaker C: They, they are doing bonding curves, I think. I mean, as a controlling marketplace for all kind of amm for the, for the NFT, fractionalized derivatives can be there.
00:57:36.556 - 00:58:07.390, Speaker B: Yeah. Are you guys at Nexo, like do you think there's any or maybe even in your own personal like portfolio? This is like a cutting edge niche, I guess. And like, you know, you could probably, you yourself could probably write like 100 airdrop threads on this space alone. Do you, do you think that there's going to be some real value that comes from that? I know NFT five just took their snapshot. Are you targeting any specific protocols for, for an airdrop coming soon?
00:58:08.010 - 00:58:50.990, Speaker C: No, I mean interacting with, with most of them. In some cases it's for the yield. You know, met street power space has good, good yields, at least for it. I think eventually, as everything in crypto will potentially have a token, some of the projects are already incentivizing the usage, you know, NFT perp, one of them, I think pirates face has already dropped their bolt. Little og nft like that. For the users affected by the hack. Something similar is happening in WhatsApp, you think with a trading competition.
00:58:50.990 - 00:59:10.030, Speaker C: And, you know, in crypto, as always, if you're early, you potentially get rewarded. Of course, nobody knows when this happened or if this happens, but I think that, I mean, if there is a way to make the vertical growing forward, it would be good. Yeah.
00:59:10.610 - 00:59:26.710, Speaker B: The last thing I wanted to touch on in terms of sectors within the space is the pricing. The only one worth mentioning is abacus. Have you looked into them at all and how their protocol works? What do you think about them?
00:59:27.180 - 01:00:04.222, Speaker C: Yeah, that's about the question. The uprising is, I think one of the key issues to move this stuff forward, the Ava cool designs, as far as I remember, it's a bit like complicated to understand at the beginning because you have like this type of pseudo knowledge, proof if I recall. Well, I am seeing despite this, more. More traction in the machine learning based mechanisms. Internally we had incubated a project which is metaquants. They are also doing pricing, pressing analytics for nfts.
01:00:04.406 - 01:00:06.010, Speaker A: You guys made better quads?
01:00:07.070 - 01:00:08.494, Speaker C: Yeah, we incubated.
01:00:08.622 - 01:00:09.290, Speaker A: Really?
01:00:09.590 - 01:00:33.202, Speaker C: Oh shit, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really good guys. Good technical math background, as we believe. As we said before, pricing is key to move perpetuals, options and even, and of course the lending markets. And you have the. Maybe the, which are, you know, upshot.
01:00:33.202 - 01:00:34.202, Speaker C: All of it.
01:00:34.386 - 01:00:52.968, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I like, I like abacus. I think their, their mechanism is going to bring a, a lot of like that, like a very deep liquidity layer. Have you researched into them at all, Ali? Abacus?
01:00:53.104 - 01:01:31.030, Speaker A: No, no, I mean, I remember what you told me like last week, I think. Sounds interesting, definitely. But no, I haven't looked too, too much into any different, like, valuation engines. It's kind of difficult to really like, besides performance and like even that's challenging because past performance is not like a yemenite proper indicator. So unless you're like an investor, like someone who's able to learn more about like, how exactly it works, it's kind of difficult to evaluate. Renata, go ahead. What was that?
01:01:31.190 - 01:01:44.312, Speaker C: So personally speaking, at the end, one brain tells you we have a margin error, I think, of 3%, the other four. But as a normal user, you don't even understand what this means.
01:01:44.416 - 01:01:45.140, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:45.840 - 01:02:05.710, Speaker C: And at the end, the algorithms, in my opinion, will all tend, if you have good mathematician and good machine learning, learning people for the same pricing in some way with the same level of error, if you have the right team. So, yeah. Not much competitive, advantageous embracing alone.
01:02:06.250 - 01:02:36.256, Speaker A: Yeah. And as a user, you really like, unless you're using something like, like spice or like, that's really the only product that comes to mind. Any of these valuation engines really won't, like, you really won't come into contact with them. I mean, I guess on like NFT fire x two, y two, you'll see like the NFT bank or like upshot valuations. But even then, it's like, up to you to, to decide what to do with that information. So, yeah, it's not super important.
01:02:36.368 - 01:03:52.712, Speaker B: I just think, like, for, with something like, like if a regular user, I guess I don't know if I'd classify myself, classify myself as a regular user. I have a few ETH I want to, you know, lend it out on NFT fire or whatever. And the biggest concern or the biggest worry is that you're going to, like, end up lending against something that, you know, someone's just using as a hedge or a way to just take a bunch of liquidity out against and then never pay it back. And that comes down to future pricing. And so with abacus, to me, it's like, if you could have, like, for me, I would just like, you kind of browse 15 minutes blur volume. I would browse, like, liquidity on abacus, like, see where people are putting their ETH into the pricing mechanism to help me figure out where, like, what my LTV should be that I'm lending against. And like, you can imagine they have, they're plugged into the back end of some lending market that allows for just like guaranteed floor price, basically, or like guaranteed, like, loan buys.
01:03:52.712 - 01:04:37.196, Speaker B: That's why I like abacus. And I think yield is going to, I think there's a chance that real yield in terms of, like, the speculation comes from their protocol. I really, I think they're a very solid project and I like the guy behind it. Like, they don't even want to, they don't even want a treasury for, like, they don't even want team treasury. They're just like, oh, well, like, they're trying to compare their token balancing and tokenomics to, like, the way eth, like, inflates and like, I don't know, the guys seem smart. I like, I like their protocol I'm excited to see what they can do. And I think it does take t five to another level that I think.
01:04:37.228 - 01:04:47.124, Speaker C: Also I already said, yeah, the new lending model sodium I like a lot. Hybrid air approaching.
01:04:47.292 - 01:04:47.852, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:47.956 - 01:05:04.956, Speaker C: I mean you mix different risk level. I mean I can be, I only lend 30% LTV. You probably can learn, I don't know, DJ percent, LGb and they can combine us in our own loans. I think it's something cool to have two more. More lenders. Yeah.
01:05:05.068 - 01:05:36.482, Speaker B: And you can hop in and borrowers can get instant peer to pool the liquidity and then they could get like they can just refinance with a peer to peer loan on top of that for more liquidity. I like their model as well. I think they're going to perform well. I said that was the last thing. But I wanted to ask a little bit about the amms specifically. Caviar is one that a lot of people have been talking about. Like, you see, you saw the failure of, I guess you.
01:05:36.482 - 01:05:41.362, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know. I'm going to call it a failure and I know Ollie is going to call it a failure of pseudo swap.
01:05:41.506 - 01:05:43.030, Speaker A: Would call it a failure.
01:05:43.770 - 01:05:45.242, Speaker B: I think they brought a zero to.
01:05:45.266 - 01:05:47.730, Speaker A: One innovation model a failure. I would.
01:05:47.770 - 01:06:22.526, Speaker B: Yeah, no, the model failure. Yeah, the model is zero to one. And I think the way I look at it is like how sadly started with VE 33. It was like a good model, but like it took some time for people to iterate on it. And because they messed up their tokenomics so bad, nobody participated initially. Like initially after launch it was very low liquidity. But it's clear now, like you see so much Ve 33 like protocols popping up everywhere and they're having success on different change, you know, in different places.
01:06:22.526 - 01:06:34.760, Speaker B: I think the same thing's going to happen with Sudoswap. And I mean, you see caviar iterating off of it, making a better uI. Do you see the, what do you see for like the future of Amms and NFT five?
01:06:35.420 - 01:07:37.630, Speaker C: I think they have, I mean, all started with Sudo, with win NFTX. Also I think what collection XYZ is doing is interesting. They're considering rarity trades as well, so it's more flexible and doesn't have this problem with the trails and the rarity and how the community perceive the nfts. I say it's a good opportunity maybe for some NFT holders to get yield on their nfts. You can build different strategies, combining options and amms and perpetuals and can create some defi products on top of it. But my bullish test is for Amms is the creator side. You can have again this community owner liquidity where the community own the liquidity of the project using amms as their marketplace.
01:07:37.630 - 01:07:47.960, Speaker C: If they will play out, I think will depend on how the marketplaces interact with the creators and the communities in the coming the coming term.
01:07:48.260 - 01:08:04.852, Speaker B: And last but not least, PFPs specifically, do you got any projects that you're a big fan of? Me and Ali talk a decent amount about what projects we think outperform eth come next bull run. I'm curious if you have any takes.
01:08:04.876 - 01:08:56.700, Speaker C: On that one side of me. Maybe the demo rationale tell me that we won't see the BN vibes of 2021 again. And the other side of me is more betting on the projects who had been showing off doing doing the stuff in this Burberry market. I like artifact mass betting on the culture, on the growth potential. Asuka is an interesting market for chinese communities. It's something I think we the next bull bull run if you see yourself, I don't know, 20 years ago most of the people who are now in crypto had interact with something chinese, Pokemon, Goku. Any of these series, at least in Latin America.
01:08:56.700 - 01:10:01.800, Speaker C: I don't know how this play out in the yeah, I don't know. Tons of series. We can continue talking about animes if you want, but you have this kind of culture popping up and maybe being a really good part of our lives. So this can potentially play out as now we have tons of people from that era has more money can be more attached to this type of project in some way if they of course get or find the way to get the right piece in animes or in comics or in figures toy figures. Right? This will have a good way to monetize the brand and ips. It's sad to see Gan I think dropping out so much in the last month. I think the breaks were like good balance sheet and continue playing.
01:10:01.800 - 01:10:41.410, Speaker C: Sorry, doesn't know how to say in English but continue doing stuff in this bear market will be the ones with the most checks in the next bull run. There are small projects I like for example a lot on chain monkeys since the last market they recently pump in this in this world they have. I mean I am more seeing NFTs as a startup investment right now where you more have to value the teams behind and at least they have solid team with tons of experience in crypto and having the good connection I think to move forward the stuff. Yeah.
01:10:42.430 - 01:10:44.530, Speaker B: And what's your dream PFP.
01:10:46.110 - 01:10:50.210, Speaker C: My dream PFP. No, I think I am okay with the one.
01:10:50.850 - 01:10:51.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:52.050 - 01:11:02.190, Speaker C: For collecting stuff. Yeah. I mean, other collections as part of the portfolio will be good, but yeah. For PFP, it's, I think it's something unique. Cool.
01:11:02.930 - 01:11:19.290, Speaker B: All right. That was awesome. I really appreciate you coming on. I think a lot of people are going to benefit from the insight. You know, the couple hundred people that are even paying attention to NFT five are probably going to enjoy this. So I really appreciate you coming on. Yeah, thanks.
01:11:19.290 - 01:11:22.650, Speaker B: That's episode 13. Awesome.
