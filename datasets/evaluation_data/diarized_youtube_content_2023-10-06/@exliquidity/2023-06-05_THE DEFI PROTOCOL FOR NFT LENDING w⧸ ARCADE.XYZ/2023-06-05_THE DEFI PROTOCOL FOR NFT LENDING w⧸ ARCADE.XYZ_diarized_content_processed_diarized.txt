00:00:00.320 - 00:00:06.810, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:07.510 - 00:00:37.830, Speaker B: This is episode seven of the NFT five summer. We're interviewing, chatting with a bunch of the best people in the ecosystem. Small ecosystem, super great people. We've been having a great time just talking to everybody. So we have today Castro with arcade, the DeFi protocol for, for NFT lending. So I appreciate you coming on. We'll jump straight into the.
00:00:37.830 - 00:00:56.706, Speaker B: How'd you get into crypto, et cetera, et cetera, more specifically the NFT ecosystem. But we like to start off with kind of your biggest, your biggest or most interesting moment that you were exit liquidity. Kind of give us a gauge of where you've been, where you earn your stripes.
00:00:56.898 - 00:01:45.398, Speaker C: I feel like this space is so, so intense that I think I've gone through a lot of things and some things that, for OpSEC, I probably don't even want to mention. I'll tell you the top of mind this morning for me, because somebody sent me something about people who paper handed their shib bags to claim an airdrop. So top of mind for me today is I used to be an intense gem hunter back in like, 2020, and I found shib, like, hours after the launch. So at the time, I wasn't very liquid, and every penny counted for me, even though ETH was like, I think around 400, $400 at the time. So I took one eth, and that was, like, a lot for me at the time, like I said, and bought a bag of shib, and it immediately went down, like 90, 95%. That was day one of shib launch, right. And so I was, like, really upset.
00:01:45.398 - 00:02:20.160, Speaker C: I was being a troll in the telegram, talking crap to Ryoshi, and just held the bag, right. There was nothing else to do. Like, to me, it was sort of like a lesson learned. Fast forward a few months. Squiggles came out by Eric snow fro, and I was so traumatized from some of the poor moves that I had made earlier that year, including the shib buy, that I capitulated my shib bag at dollar 600. Mind you, I bought it at dollar 400. And to buy a bunch of squiggles, which definitely well worth it, right? I mean, I still hold majority of my squiggles, but at the peak, that bag would have been worth 15 million.
00:02:20.160 - 00:02:40.712, Speaker C: So I don't let it haunt me, by no means, because if you do and you let it eat you up, you know, that's not a good thing at all. But I was reminded this morning of it because somebody's handing out an airdrop for people who paper handed their shit bags. And for some reason, the airdrops telling me I don't even qualify. So, like, I don't know, I got to reach out to someone because I should definitely qualify for that. Yeah, I don't know if that constitutes for story for you guys.
00:02:40.816 - 00:02:54.750, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a tough one. I mean, I was crying, like, last week when Elon tweeted about milady, and I didn't. Didn't hold on to that. So, yeah, definitely a big difference there. But, yeah, it's hard to not let those eat you. I can't imagine.
00:02:54.830 - 00:03:06.558, Speaker C: I'm holding my pipe. I didn't buy. I saw Pepe day one. I didn't pick up a bag until it was at 150 mil market cap. But, yeah, I'm just. I'll hold that one to zero and I won't care. So I'm just gonna hold it until the next cycle.
00:03:06.558 - 00:03:08.518, Speaker C: Now make the same mistake I did with shit.
00:03:08.614 - 00:03:18.158, Speaker B: Yeah. The meme coin. The meme coin journey is definitely an interesting one. How'd you transition from gem hunting to kind of the NFT ecosystem?
00:03:18.294 - 00:03:55.572, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good question. So I've been, you know, I guess, retail participant in the space since, like, 2016. Not too seriously, right? Very, very normy. Very just buying whatever influencers were shilling after the crash in, what was it, January of 2018 or whatever, I took a step back and just focus on other things. And then in 2020, or actually towards the end of 2019, I started to get re involved and took it a little more seriously, trying to learn from some of the, you know, mis happenings of my previous cycle. So by 2020, Defi Summer was going on, and I was all in. I was just, you know, gem hunting all the time, just online, non stop.
00:03:55.572 - 00:04:21.778, Speaker C: Right. And not much has changed with being terminally online. But at the time, most of my time was dedicated to gem hunting. So by the end of that summer, Nfts kind of were being talked about more. They obviously existed for a few years prior to that, but more and more people were talking about it more and more. Defi people were looking for the next thing. And so I was pretty fortunate just sort of being in the right place at the right time to stumble upon nfts.
00:04:21.778 - 00:04:45.590, Speaker C: I have a creative background. I come from filmmaking and tv production. So to me, it clicked right away. What I didn't expect was how quickly it was going to blow up and become this, you know, multi billion dollar market. So at first, I was just literally picking up stuff that I liked, stuff that I still hold today, stuff that probably will never be worth much. But I liked it. I was just consuming art at the end of the day.
00:04:45.590 - 00:05:17.838, Speaker C: And so, like I said, it clicked with me really easily because I was a creative and this just felt like a new medium to create on. And I guess really, the rest is history. I just got, you know, Defi Summer was just a summer. You know, literally, if you continued to use Defi products, which I did, then, fantastic. But we were using them for very practical purposes. NfTs, on the other hand, despite being in a bear market, like, it really has not stopped, right? There's always something new, there's always some move to make. And so, you know, like I said, the rest is history.
00:05:17.838 - 00:05:26.248, Speaker C: Since 2020, it's just been nonstop. And here I am now, you know, helping to build arcade and which is a pretty vital protocol in the whole NFT fi system.
00:05:26.344 - 00:06:02.250, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, Defi summer was, I think I caught, like, the very, very tail end of that and got absorbed by, like, the DeFi 2.0 stuff that came around. But defi itself in that whole era is something I feel like a lot of sectors within the space tried to, like, mimic. There was Defi 2.0, now there's nFt phi summer. What phase do you think NFT Phi as an ecosystem is? Do you think it's ready? Do you think it's prepared for a summer moment? On the scale that defi summer was?
00:06:03.110 - 00:06:34.926, Speaker C: DeFi summer happened pretty organically. Like when, when compound was out, when some of these early DeFi protocols that blew up were out. Nobody was calling it DeFi Summer. I think, like, the first time I heard that term was in July. So still pretty early on. But I think it was a term that was made after the mania had started, whereas here with, like, NFT five summer, I think a lot of us are trying to force it. Like, don't get me wrong, I would love to see an NFT five summer, but we're making up the term before actually seeing it happen.
00:06:34.926 - 00:07:28.936, Speaker C: That being said, there are protocols out there that are really well developed, and I'd like to think arcade is one of them. Like 90 million plus in volume, you know, essentially in less than a year. So there are plenty of protocols out there that you can use to their fullest abilities that you can leverage very well, the same way you could leverage, you know, the blue chip DeFi protocols that exist and that we know very well. And so I think that those protocols, including arcade, that are already well developed and seeing volume and seeing users and seeing trends continuing to go upwards, are already prepared for a new influx of participants. And so if we do have an NFT five summer, I think there's plenty of infrastructure right now to support that. But my cynicism tells me wait and see if we're going to actually have a craze this summer. I know there's a lot going on.
00:07:28.936 - 00:08:02.364, Speaker C: There's a lot of protocols with their incentives, trying to encourage participation. But at the end of the day, I think we are, I think the greater market is going to tell us whether or not we will have an NFT five summer. You know, again, anything's possible. I guess my only apprehension there is a lot of us, including myself, you know, I'm guilty of it or are pushing for NFT five summer before we're actually getting it right. Where again, like I said at the beginning, defy summer started. Right? The mania started and then we all started calling it Defi summer. So I think those are, that's a key differentiator there.
00:08:02.452 - 00:08:28.636, Speaker A: I love that. That's, that's hilarious, actually. I'm totally in agreement that, like, it, it's, people are trying to make it happen rather than it happen organically. But it's just funny because you're on a podcast right now in our NFT five summer season, so we're very much guilty of that, too. Definitely trying to stoke the fire there. But no, I think that's a great point. It still is going to take some time to see if it's going to catch on to some end.
00:08:28.636 - 00:08:51.489, Speaker A: I would like to get into arcade a little bit at this point. I would like to hear, like, more of a chronological perspective, if you don't mind. I guess, like. Cause I was only familiar with arcade from v two. I wasn't super aware of it before that. So I'm wondering, like, more so where the idea came from, what it looked like during v one, and kind of how it's become what it is today.
00:08:52.429 - 00:09:26.938, Speaker C: Yeah, great, great question. And Gabe Frank, who's in the audience right now, is one of the founders of Arcade. And just to give a brief background of his story, he came from a line of family owned pawn shops. And so Gabe and I both kind of came up in Defi summer together. And so we really stumbled upon nfts together. And for him, the idea was like really early, right? Being from the pawnshop industry, he recognized nfts as these high end luxury type of assets, right? And those types of assets always get financialized. And so he had the idea really, really early on.
00:09:26.938 - 00:09:55.252, Speaker C: And I remember when he first told me about the idea? Like, I was like, holy smokes, like, my mind was blown. And so he basically doubled down on that idea and started raising almost immediately. We launched V one in January of 2022 and had been building it for several months prior. I mean, the first seed raise was back in 2021. And so v one launched. We had a great protocol. We were getting some volume on it.
00:09:55.252 - 00:10:29.710, Speaker C: It was still very early. We were obviously not the first movers, and the first movers were doing fairly well, relatively speaking, at the time, too. But there were a lot of learnings to be had in v one because we were trying to differentiate ourselves from the infrastructure that already existed. How can we be better? How can we be more innovative? Our v one was great. Like I said, the protocol was amazing, and we learned a ton. And so at one point, we decided to take our learnings and create a v two. And v two is where things really started to shine.
00:10:29.710 - 00:10:59.760, Speaker C: Everything was amped up. The team grew. We knew exactly who we needed to pull in. We knew exactly what we needed to do. And so in August of last year, 2022, we launched V two. And the app that you see today is v two. It's, you know, taking all the learnings that we got from v one, that we saw from others building in the space as well, that we had as our own experiences, too, because many of us who are part of the team, myself included, were users of the app itself.
00:10:59.760 - 00:11:29.830, Speaker C: I'm a borrower, and I'm a lender personally. And so once v two came out, if you look like at our dune dashboard, it's literally been up only ever since, which is really, really exciting. And we continue to learn, we continue to enhance the app. Early this morning, before I was even awake, we deployed an update on the UX. We've made the UX a lot more intuitive. So I definitely encourage you guys to check it out because it does look quite a bit different from how it looked yesterday. And we're really flexible, which is one of the things that excites me the most.
00:11:29.830 - 00:12:11.480, Speaker C: We have a really top tier engineering team who takes our feedback and takes our users feedback very seriously. And so every time a piece of feedback comes in that we think is very worthwhile, we literally try to deploy an update to the UX immediately. And so the new UX that we launched this morning is all that feedback that we've been receiving since v two launched back in August, redone. It's still v two. Yeah. So the timeline, just to reiterate, January of 2022, v one launches, we see decent volume. At the time, we actually saw, I think are still our single biggest loan, which was for two crypto zombie punks.
00:12:11.480 - 00:12:28.688, Speaker C: And that was like at the top. So that was like a really, really huge loan. And, but, you know, the volume wasn't significant. I think it was significant, relatively speaking. But once v two launched, the app and the protocol were just totally different. Super flexible. You know, we can basically support any utility out there.
00:12:28.688 - 00:13:01.698, Speaker C: Your loans are airdrop friendly, delegate cash, warm XYZ, even unique integrations that don't have those universal protocols like artifact has done a lot of utility drops that required manual intervention from our side to make those things happen. You know, we allow our basie and Macie borrowers to ape stake. So super flexible, super innovative. And, you know, I think that is all the stuff that we learned from v one to applying to v two. And, you know, I do really think that the numbers don't lie and that our charts, especially if you look at Dune, our representation of that.
00:13:01.794 - 00:13:58.658, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I, thanks for mentioning that because I see, I was mentioning that you guys had a new Ux coming and I was checking out the site yesterday. Like, where is it? Like, am I, am I missing something? And I'm just now looking and it definitely looks quite a bit better. I'm going to have to take some time to dig into this a little bit. I was talking to some of the guys from Spice Finance yesterday about just like lending behavior because I'm, I guess not so much as of recently, but I have been a pretty active lender in the past and the experience obviously isn't great. But there's like, I think that there's certain like quality of life improvements that could be made to make managing your own lending a whole lot easier. And the biggest but like simplest thing that has stood out to me to like kind of address that is the has term set filter you guys have on for listed collateral.
00:13:58.658 - 00:14:31.650, Speaker A: So essentially, like for the loans that already have or for the listed nfts that already have offers or terms set for them, you can just go click that button and you can immediately start a loan if you're willing to agree to those terms. I'm wondering if you guys have any like specific ideas for how to take the direction of improving lender experience, just given that it's such a, it's such an active and oftentimes time intensive, painful process for, for users on certain platforms.
00:14:32.230 - 00:15:14.946, Speaker C: Yeah, well, you know, sometimes it's the little things like having a filter for past term set, but you know, I think we're always trying to improve the experience for both sides, for both the borrowers and the lenders. But I do have to say that I think that our focus is, is more on the borrower side. You know, the borrower is the user, right? Like who's making the money here? And it's the lender. Right now, the lender is also taking on risk in the peer to peer setting. But really the borrower is like the user that we want to accommodate the most. And with people like spice, and there's, and there's plenty of others doing it, I love the spice team. There's others who are trying to improve that lender experience outside of the actual infrastructure that's been built that, you know, the settlement layers like arcade.
00:15:14.946 - 00:15:34.202, Speaker C: And so I'm not saying we're ignoring the lenders. By no means. Our lender experience, I think, has greatly improved since the day we launched v one. And I think it's greatly improved since the day that we've launched v two. You know, just that term has terms filter is just one example. But I think on our side we are mostly thinking about the borrower. We want to improve their experience.
00:15:34.202 - 00:16:17.388, Speaker C: We want to make sure it's easy for them to get a loan. We want to make sure that conditions are as liquid as possible for them to get the liquidity that they're seeking. And also as a consequence of that specific action item on our plate, that also improves the lender experience. So, you know, even though we might be putting an extra emphasis on a borrower's experience, a lot of that sort of flows over to a lender experience. But listen, like I said before, we take feedback very, very seriously. Like I wish me being on the front lines, I see it happening in real time. Every ounce of feedback that we get is being brought to the table, is being brought to the team and we're talking about it and trying as quickly as possible to figure out if it's worthwhile.
00:16:17.388 - 00:17:03.818, Speaker C: And so if anything, I just ask that you take my word that we take that feedback seriously. So if you guys, or anyone listening or just anyone in general has real feedback, even if you're not using the app as a settlement layer, even if you're just browsing the app to check it out to learn a little more, we take all that feedback seriously. So I highly encourage tell me now or tell me in the discord, tell me in our Telegram chat, bring it to the table and I'll see what we could do about it. I'm like, last night's deployment this early morning deployment was a significant change in the UX. But, like, we are constantly pushing out updates and deployments, even if it's the littlest thing, just to accommodate something that somebody suggested that we agreed with. Right. Like, we're not perfect, so we rely on our community to help us there.
00:17:03.914 - 00:17:45.080, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I love that energy. I guess just to backtrack a little bit, I would kind of like to flip the question that I just asked because you mentioned that you're kind of focused on having a super borrower friendly experience. And in my limited experience, borrowing, I find that direct peer to peer is often not conducive to the best borrowing environment. So, for example, obviously all the solutions are still quite early. But I. For everything that I've used as a borrower, I've had the best experience on abacus, for example, which, like I said, super limited. I think they have like three or four collections, something like that.
00:17:45.080 - 00:17:57.700, Speaker A: But how do you guys approach that issue of having a great borrower experience when it. And my. In my eyes at least, it seems inherently difficult to do so on a peer to peer platform.
00:17:58.360 - 00:18:32.822, Speaker C: So there's no doubt that there is a. A layer of friction when it comes to these peer to peer settlement apps. So what. What you really are using a peer to peer app for is so you can get specific terms that you normally couldn't get in another environment, say a pooled environment, that the terms are set right. Maybe I have a rarer ape. You'll see that there's, I think, two or three golden bases right now on the app. You can't just go deposit that in some pooled protocol or a quasi pulled protocol and get the terms that you would get on a peer to peer app with an asset like that.
00:18:32.822 - 00:19:03.196, Speaker C: Sure, I know some of the pooled protocols out there have, like, trait boosters, but they're very inefficient still. And that's not me knocking them at all. It's just a fact. And so you're coming to a peer to peer protocol to get terms that you might find more favorable, that you can negotiate a little bit. And so one of the things that has been happening on arcade this year, specifically, a lot of fine art has been coming to the app. Bunch of x copies, bunch of purchases. Just the other day, three, one of ones from Tyler Hobbs were actually collateralized.
00:19:03.196 - 00:20:04.286, Speaker C: So these are very illiquid assets, but still very high value that you can't just go to any given pool protocol and get a loan on. You have to go to a peer to peer setting. And so, you know, if you have a floor basie or a floor punk, there's plenty of places where you can just go and get instant liquidity. But if you want some higher LTV on those assets, even if they're floored assets, or if you want a better rate on it, or a longer duration, whatever it might be, or you just want to avoid the risk of liquidation, because on a peer to peer protocol like arcade, you don't have a risk of being liquidated, regardless of price fluctuations, as long as you pay back your loan, you get it back, you don't pay it back, then you obviously risk a default and then the lender can claim it. So there is a unique proposition here to use a peer to peer app, right? Again, you're looking for that instant liquidity. You just, you need it right now, right? Like some influencer just launched a shitcoin and they're telling you to send your eth to their wallet so that you can get an allocation. You need that money quick.
00:20:04.286 - 00:20:37.210, Speaker C: All right, you know, you could take a collection offer on a peer to peer app, but still you don't care too much about customizing your terms. On a peer to peer app, you're customizing your terms, you're negotiating a little bit, which of course is a layer of friction, but it's just one that comes with the peer to peer nature. But most importantly, we're catering to these high value assets. You go and check out the loans right now at arcade, you're going to see the rare end of Macy's. You're going to see the rare end of Macy's. I mean, there was a megamutant loan on the app for like the last six months. It was two mega mutants in one loan for.
00:20:37.210 - 00:21:06.394, Speaker C: In one vault for 1000 eth, right? You're not going to get that anywhere but a peer to peer protocol. And, you know, like I said before, we try to cater to that higher end stuff. And so that's why you're seeing the fine art. Now, come on. The app, we have a network of lenders, a network who trusts our protocol, who trusts our team, and they're willing to provide that liquidity on the app to make it as a settlement layer for this fine art. And there's even some fine art listed now that I'm helping borrowers try to get build on. There's a couple.
00:21:06.394 - 00:21:20.732, Speaker C: Jack Fry or Jake. Fraid excuse me, Jake fried. 100 one's on the app right now, some high end squiggles. You'll see that are on the app right now. There's a full spectrum one and a hyper. Right. These aren't assets that you can easily find liquidity for.
00:21:20.732 - 00:21:26.204, Speaker C: And so, you know, where arcade is positioned is making that experience easy.
00:21:26.292 - 00:21:45.090, Speaker A: Awesome. What's, you mentioned that you're helping some higher end NFT owners find suitable lenders. What's that process like? Do you have like, specific lenders you're familiar with who are willing to do stuff like that? Are you, how much of this, like, process are you arbitrating?
00:21:45.630 - 00:22:15.530, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, just that. Right. We have a lot of relationships at arcade with, you know, some of the biggest players in the space, some of the biggest liquidity providers, you know, and so those relationships we're just able to harness and make things happen at the end of the day, even when conditions might not be great. I mean, I think it could be argued that NFT conditions right now are at the best that they could be. There's still people who want to play the game. There's still people who want to borrow and lend and. Yeah, I would say it's just we have a really large relationship network to make that happen.
00:22:15.650 - 00:22:53.350, Speaker A: Right. Right. Okay. I want to, I want to talk a bit more. I mean, you touched base on the vault functionality a little bit, but to me, that's, there's a lot of interesting stuff to get into there, specifically the delegate cache integration. What do you, what do you, or what have you seen so far as, like, that being used? Have you, have you seen any, any notable use cases while NFTs have been escrowed for a long? And what do you see that looking like as the market, like, matures? Do you see having delegate functionality as being like a game changer, mid loan at least?
00:22:54.330 - 00:23:28.202, Speaker C: Yeah, our smart vaults are really, really innovative. I mean, we were the first to introduce this concept. You know, the vaults let you do a ton of stuff, and I'll definitely cover that in just a moment. But I'll talk about, like, utility here for the time being. You know, one of the motivating factors to incorporate delegate cash specifically, and now warm XYZ was the Yuga ecosystem. Right. Being able to, you know, use your other deeds to access the game or being able to use the fact that you own Macy's and basies to claim an additional asset.
00:23:28.202 - 00:24:03.916, Speaker C: And so, you know, traditionally, if you had these assets in escrow, you were just kind of Sol, if there was a claim or if there was an airdrop. But we wanted to make sure that our borrowers weren't Sol. We wanted to make sure, we were accommodating them. And so that's why, you know, that's part of the reason why vaults were created, to allow for utility. And so the vaults came first. The vaults are so flexible that we could just basically incorporate these types of utility into them at any given moment. And so that's why delegate cash is on our smart vaults for a given collection that supports delegate cash.
00:24:03.916 - 00:24:48.976, Speaker C: And that's why you'll see warm Xyz with you gum no longer using delegate cash, you know, specifically because that's still sort of the king of the ecosystem in the NFT world. Right. And so we just want to make sure that our borrowers are able to access the games, able to access claims, and then ensure if there are any true airdrops that happen, which there are, that they're able to do that as well. So I think it's really important, you know, fine art, for example, probably doesn't have much utility. Maybe some artists will be releasing utility, and I know some already have for their fine art, but the utility stuff really comes into play when it comes to collections, pfps, gaming assets, land ownership. Right. And so we just want to make sure that people can access that.
00:24:48.976 - 00:25:39.400, Speaker C: And so the vaults give you delegate cash, give you warm Xyz, give you legit airdrops. And like I mentioned earlier on, the spaces here artifacted a bunch of stuff in the recent months this year that didn't involve any sort of delegation. And so we were able to incorporate that utility into the vaults for Clonex borrowers to take advantage of, or sneaker borrowers, whatever line that they were using as collateral. In addition to that, one of the big things about our vaults are that you can bundle multiple assets in one vault and take out a loan on that entire bundle, rather than taking out a loan on one asset. And so we were the first there. I can't remember off the top of my head, I want to say that the largest vault that's ever gone through, Arcade, had something like 85 or 90 assets in it. So that's pretty crazy, right? And, yeah, so the vaults also allow you to escrow eleven fifty five s.
00:25:39.400 - 00:25:49.336, Speaker C: Eleven fifty five s pose a challenge for a lot of settlement layers out there. But with arcade, if you want to use an 1155, no problem. Put them in a vault and take out the loan.
00:25:49.408 - 00:25:55.168, Speaker A: Did you say, did you say the largest vault that you guys have had on record had 90 assets in it?
00:25:55.304 - 00:25:59.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it was just like shy of 90. It was like 85 or 87.
00:25:59.880 - 00:26:06.360, Speaker A: Wow, that's nuts. And was that, were those all, were those all nfts? Were there any ERC 20s in that. In that bunch?
00:26:06.400 - 00:26:31.262, Speaker C: It was, it was all nfts. On the UX side, we don't support eRc twenty s to be used as collateral. Technically, on the protocol side you can, but I don't think there's a. You know, we're focused on nfts, right. So we're not necessarily encouraging ERC 20 escrow. But the cool thing is, and if I didn't mention this already, it doesn't have to be like, from the same collection. Like, it doesn't have to be like ten basies, right? It could be basies and Macy's and punks and artifact stuff and knock amigos squiggles.
00:26:31.262 - 00:27:04.002, Speaker C: Like, it could be a variety of assets all in one vault, and it could be a mix of both seven hundred twenty one s and eleven fifty five. So, like, they're super, super flexible. A vault, essentially is a wallet. You know, like it's got a wallet address. The borrower actually owns that vault. And so when a loan begins, the borrower gets their note, and then as long as they pay off the loan, they re access their vault key, as we call it, so that they can then unlock the vault and get their assets back. But as long as they have the vault, they technically still own the assets.
00:27:04.002 - 00:27:07.402, Speaker C: The assets are just locked in escrow during the time of a loan.
00:27:07.546 - 00:27:43.756, Speaker A: Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. And then going back to the functionality bit, an idea that I've talked to tacito about quite a bit because you mentioned, like airdrops and stuff. But the. My biggest question is around, like, nouns is like the best example. So, like, being able to, given that the, like a noun vote tends to be higher value than most other, like, dow votes, I've always wondered if it's feasible to still be able to vote on Dao proposals while your NFT is escrowed for a loan.
00:27:43.756 - 00:27:45.540, Speaker A: And if so, who does that, right.
00:27:45.620 - 00:27:46.108, Speaker C: Go to?
00:27:46.164 - 00:27:55.316, Speaker A: And also a tangentially related question, which I don't know if you have the answer to, but I've always wondered why there's no lending market for nouns specifically.
00:27:55.428 - 00:28:27.426, Speaker C: Yeah. So to the first part with the voting, it's not up to arcade to whitelist or verify a given collection with delegate cash or warm Xyz. It's up to those collections themselves. Right? So if you go to the app right now and you click on some, I don't know, a non yuga or non artifact asset, you might not see the delegate cash function pop up on the app. That's because that asset probably doesn't have it. So it's up to the collections themselves to enable that, and then we can support it. If.
00:28:27.426 - 00:28:58.230, Speaker C: So, if nouns, and I'm not sure if they have delicac or warm xYZ enabled, but if they have that, then we could easily support people borrowing against their nouns and then still participating in governance. If they don't have that, there still might be a way. I said earlier, that artifact had a bunch of stuff that happened earlier this year that had unique utilities that we had to manually sort of integrate, and it didn't take us long at all. That's why I think so highly of our engineering team, because they were literally able to do that in less than 24 hours. So, you know, there's. There's the ability, the. It's open.
00:28:58.230 - 00:29:20.230, Speaker C: I'll put it this way, it's fully possible that any collection out there that has a governance function like nouns, dow, can still vote with their nouns even if they're escrowed. The latter part of that question, I've tried. I've tried to get nouns. Nouns have been listed before. I'm not positive if one has gone through or not. I can't remember. I want to say, like, maybe one happened, but, yeah, I think that would be.
00:29:20.230 - 00:29:56.286, Speaker C: Unfortunately not to, you know, put the question off of myself. But I think that's more of a question for, like, the people who own nouns right now. I know, like, nouns have gotten a lot of. A lot cheaper since when they were super popular, and so, you know, market conditions might have something to do with that. And as far as I understand, a lot of the nouns that are being sold right now are being sold basically at a backstop bid to keep the floor at a somewhat healthy level. So I think all those things regarding nouns specifically probably don't make it the best sort of collateral to borrow or against, but that's just my opinion. I would still love to see nouns on the app.
00:29:56.286 - 00:30:10.526, Speaker C: I would still love to see them just using NfT fi in general. Like, I still love what the nouns dao does. You know, I'm not one of those haters at all, but it's probably because I don't have a stake directly in there to be mad about anything. So, yeah, it's not the best answer, but that's just my observation.
00:30:10.638 - 00:30:45.626, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I think the nouns ecosystem is definitely an interesting one. I did want to circle back a bit on your mention of incentivization. You see, nft fi, the protocol come out with their. Their point system. And, of course, blur's incentives are some of the biggest out there. How do you see arcade stacking up? I mean, because you guys are performing significantly well with basically no incentive.
00:30:45.626 - 00:30:53.990, Speaker B: Do you guys think that's something you'll need in the future? Do you think that's something on the table? How does that kind of get planned for you guys?
00:30:54.410 - 00:31:23.804, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question. I don't think it's needed, but I do think it's necessary to deliver a fully decentralized, abiding by the ethos of web3. The ethos of web3 is decentralization. It's community governance. And so at Arcade, we're now pursuing a path to decentralization. We want our next version of the protocol to be community governed. And so that comes with all the traditional things that we see today.
00:31:23.804 - 00:31:52.716, Speaker C: With governance and rewarding, or handing over governance, rather, to the borrowers and the lenders of the app. So that's where we see Arcade. We're trying to do it as best as we can. We don't want to make this a gambling thing, right? And listen, blends got a nice product out there. But those incentives are not incentives to make blur or blend a community governed thing. As opposed to nifty five. Right? They're very much focused on governance and making a community thing.
00:31:52.716 - 00:32:06.358, Speaker C: So kudos to them. And so we want to do the same thing at Arcade. We want to abide by the ethos of web3. We're all Defi Maxis at the end of the day, on the team. We believe in all that stuff. So we're really excited about the future of decentralization. And so, you know, our incentives.
00:32:06.358 - 00:32:17.878, Speaker C: You know, I even hate calling them incentives. It's really, how do we hand it off to the community and make sure that the community is structured in such a way that they could, you know, handle the governance and the future of the protocol.
00:32:17.974 - 00:32:40.640, Speaker B: Interesting. I think that's. That's a great point. Having that ethos is something that is very important. We took a look at your guys's new ux, and we see the on chain lending and borrowing. It says all on chain activity on arcade is being recorded. Could you give us some insight on what exactly that's for?
00:32:40.980 - 00:33:00.916, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe not. Maybe not my favorite way to word it. But what we're basically saying is, like, you know, that. That alludes to what I just talked about. About the future of decentralization, right? Like, you know, if you're using the app, you're going to be given the responsibility, right. Of governance at one point. So that's what that means, you know, but it's not knocking anyone there.
00:33:00.916 - 00:33:02.456, Speaker C: But not my choice of words. That's all.
00:33:02.548 - 00:33:22.100, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I think the, so for the decentralization aspect, do you expect like adding new collections to the protocol being like a major governance aspect? How deep do you think the governance is going to be? Is it going to be full on one day or is it going to be a slow transition?
00:33:22.920 - 00:33:40.904, Speaker C: You know, I don't have like an answer there because this is still all exploratory stuff on our end. Right. We're trying to figure that out right now. So I don't have an answer. You know, right now when we verify new collections, we just sort of do it as long as the collection has a decent amount of volume. You know, that's, it's coming from a legit place. It's not just some rug.
00:33:40.904 - 00:34:02.004, Speaker C: You're never going to see us verify like a bored ape knockoff, right. Where it's just using like the actual board ape pictures, because that's, that's a scam, right. So yeah, I don't really have a good question there, but. Or rather a good answer. Sorry. I guess we'll see as time, you know, that's the best answer I can give you. You know, we're watching people who have good reputations, who are good borrowers, who are good lenders.
00:34:02.004 - 00:34:23.066, Speaker C: And so, you know, I trust that the ultimate decision makers at the end of the day, given our alignment in the ethos of web3, are going to make the right decision. But I'm handling the wheel in and deal in here. You know, I'm making sure that borrowers and lenders are getting matched. So I'll probably find out when you guys find out about what the future of decentralization looks like for arcade.
00:34:23.228 - 00:35:17.710, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think that's, I think that's totally valid. I like that you guys are planning on having an emphasis for quote unquote good borrowers, good lenders. Not to, like, not to throw a slight at blend, but like also to totally throw a slight at blend. Like they have not exactly done that to say the least. You know, not that, not that that didn't have significant impact or anything, but I like to see that like the NFT five point system, for example, they're really trying to incentivize healthy loans and healthy borrowers rather than just liquidity above all else. I think that's a good segue to the broader NFT financialization space. Just given that it's been a pretty busy month for what has been a relatively quiet industry, I think, since its inception.
00:35:17.710 - 00:35:48.382, Speaker A: I would like to get into, like, a couple of more, like, recent topics, if you have any specific, like, takes or insights, starting out with Paris space, and I know that that's still, like, fresh, and there could be, if there's anything you're, you're not comfortable talking about there, but I'm wondering if you have, like, a specific take there, what your thoughts were on the situation where you think this is headed, or if it's, if it's kind of just gonna fizzle out and that's it for, for them.
00:35:48.486 - 00:36:36.110, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I'll touch upon something you said first, and then I'm, I am happy to talk about Paris space and what others are doing in the space, but you sort of said up until this month, it's been kind of quiet. And, you know, I think it's just quiet because we're not seeing people talk about, like, loans too much on, like, Twitter. Right. But, like, you know, I think it was a month or so ago, we, like, had just been touching $1 billion worth of volume across the NFT finance space, I think maybe specifically in the lending and borrowing space, not even with, like, options and derivatives. And so that's not really quiet, in my opinion, like, for being in a bear market, for utilizing these assets that have been trending down for so long, doing that much in volume across the space is, like, in my opinion, pretty impactful. So I understand why you say that. It's been quad until recently.
00:36:36.110 - 00:37:17.166, Speaker C: And I think really, the drama with powerspace and the blend product has probably made it a bit louder. But, like, in my opinion, it's not that quiet. It's just that, you know, it's not a great market right now, and it's just sort of the same people that have been here for a long time participating in it. And so when those new participants start to enter, as the next cycle ideally starts to pick up here, hopefully sooner than later, I think that's when a statement like it's been quiet won't be relevant anymore. Right? Like, it's, it's going to be a lot louder because people are going to be discovering these products. They're going to get more excited about it, they're going to be talking about it, and especially with incentives coming out from different protocols. Right.
00:37:17.166 - 00:38:07.444, Speaker C: That's always a reason to get a little louder. So, you know, despite the Paris based drama kind of being, you know, not great and, and despite, you know, blends robust incentive program, maybe also not being that great. You know, I do appreciate the extra attention that's coming onto the space because it's not all bad attention. So I think it's been like, like, I'm shocked, to be honest with you. Like, how much the space has grown and how much volume the space session. Like, you know, for being such a niche space in an already niche industry, I think it's been pretty fruitful and gives me the extra confidence that I think I need to, like, keep going because this is already really cool stuff. And then seeing people use your own product, seeing people use other products and just like really diving deep and like, I mean, let's face it, a lot of NFT people, like, were defi people, and now a lot of them are.
00:38:07.444 - 00:38:56.180, Speaker C: And so that's really cool to see, right? As someone who really fell in love with defi and permissionless and trustless types of infrastructure and protocols, like, it's really exciting to now see these people who just came in to like, you know, buy their jpegs and their art getting into it as well. You know, if you followed Paris space from like day one and you knew what to look for, I think you would have seen that they weren't a truly decentralized protocol, you know, and I don't mean like the Dao stuff. I mean their actual protocol, right. There was a lot of control and centralization over, you know, parties that were running paraspace over the actual code. And so that was always a red flag from the beginning, right? And I haven't been following this last week, but I think there was a resolution there. With the drama, I think, Yubo, we'll be keeping control, but I don't know for sure. So I don't want to misspeak there.
00:38:56.180 - 00:39:38.060, Speaker C: But, you know, I would encourage anyone who wants to start utilizing DeFi protocols, make sure it's a real DeFi protocol. Make sure, like, all the contracts are trustless, are permissionless, and there's plenty of places both in the peer to peer side, the peer to pool side, and other NFT financial derivatives. There's plenty of places that are actually truly decentralized protocols. So I'm not surprised at what happened. The drama that followed, I think was a little shocking, and I don't really have an opinion there, but if Paris space is going to stay around, I don't know if they've made any changes to the way their infrastructure is, but I hope that they do, because if they want a chance at surviving, I think that's their only shot. At it. And as more and more people get educated, become privy.
00:39:38.060 - 00:40:00.800, Speaker C: I mean, at arcade, and I know a lot of the other NFT five platforms, we do a really good job at educating people. And so as we educate people, the network effect is going to grow and others are going to be educated and so on and so forth. People will only want decentralized, fully decentralized protocols. They won't want to screw around with protocols where their funds can essentially be controlled by a centralized party at any point.
00:40:00.880 - 00:40:32.652, Speaker A: Gotcha. I totally agree with that sentiment that users need to be vigilant. To that end, this is not really an NFT five focused question, but like a broader crypto user kind of question. I think that's also a lot easier said than done. From your average user's perspective, is recognizing something fishy when it's there or something that's pseudo decentralized. How did, how do you personally go about. Because you mentioned that you have quite an extensive background in gem hunting.
00:40:32.652 - 00:40:41.484, Speaker A: What was your process for identifying what was safe and what was not or kind of what was past your line or not?
00:40:41.532 - 00:41:40.062, Speaker C: I think once you understand smart contracts, and I'm not saying like, you know, I'm some giga brain here, like, I understand it on a very arbitrary level and most of it, you know, self taught and just reading a shit ton over the last few years. And obviously I do have a bunch of people I can tap in to help educate me when I have questions, both on the arcade side and just my network in general. So I'm always thankful to be connected with people who are a lot more sophisticated than I am. So if you just understand like smart contracts and who controls the smart contracts, like even a multi sig being controlled by two or three people is still kind of risky, right? Like those two or three people can collude at any time to, to do something, you know, not great. So you know, it's, it's those sort of things. I mean, like, I think we could probably have like an entire, like our talk about it, but you know, protocols need to be protocols. They need to control the funds every, if it's not code, then it's probably not kosher sort of thing, right? If, if you got, if you got a multi sig of two people controlling funds of a protocol, right? Like, I don't mean the treasury, like, I mean the funds that are being deposited into some sort of pool, right.
00:41:40.062 - 00:42:18.198, Speaker C: I'm not talking about anyone specific here, right. A lot of, unfortunately a lot of protocols have done this pass right then, and it's not really decentralized, right. Because those guys could just, you know, take the funds at any point and tell you to piss off, right. And, you know, there probably would be a lot of authorities active and maybe even other people trying to get them. But, like, I think, I think first and foremost, like, you don't have to necessarily, like, be a nerd and look into all that stuff. I mean, if you're entering the space today, it's probably overwhelming. I think you probably just need to figure out, like, the people to trust who are going to tell you, like, yeah, this thing is actually decentralized, but I think it's always advantageous to also try to learn as much as you can.
00:42:18.198 - 00:43:01.524, Speaker C: God forbid a UX goes down one day and you need to pull your funds out of that protocol for whatever reason, good or bad. It's always good to know how to do that directly on Etherscan. If you're using a protocol regularly, I highly suggest knowing how to use etherscan if you have a lot of fun somewhere or if you're using it regularly. Right. I know arcades etherscan really well. If I ever need to actually do something or tell a user to do something via etherscan for whatever reason, I also know aaves, you know, etherscan contracts really well, right? Because I'm big aave or I was a big Aave user. So I would say that maybe I retract the sentence I just said before about maybe just trusting other people.
00:43:01.524 - 00:43:17.334, Speaker C: No, you should. If you're going to get involved in this space, you should probably figure that stuff out. But you know what? That's also a really idealistic thing to say. And, you know, there's going to be plenty of people who enter the space who are just going to be too intimidated by that and they are going to just trust other people. So I guess hopefully they trust the right people, right?
00:43:17.422 - 00:44:16.620, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a lot we could unpack there. But I think I, I agree with the sentiment that newer users should. Well, first of all, it's on us to promote and have actors who are, are reasonably able to be trust and then trusted. And then newer users as they come in should kind of have to lean on them a little bit before they can get to the point where they can tread water on their own. Like, from a security perspective, there is like, you don't have to be like, technical to protect yourself, I think. But there is like a minimum, a minimum level that is better to be met. Like you said, you know, interacting with etherscan, for example, that is, you know, not anything crazy, but enough to the point where it's worth learning that it can protect you in certain situations, like a front going down or something.
00:44:17.480 - 00:44:43.706, Speaker C: And I am not technical, right. Like, you know, I'm trying to read and figure out what I can understand. Like sometimes I'm having discussions with devs or whatever and I'll ask questions or make comments that make them. LAUGHTER right. And it's not that they're making fun of me, it's just like, oh, wow, people still think this way, right? Think very arbitrarily. And so it's okay, right? Like they'll then correct me or help me understand better. So, like, you know, it's not like you have to be some technical wiz.
00:44:43.706 - 00:45:05.420, Speaker C: Like I don't really have any sort of coding or technical background. I just read and read and read until I can absorb it and ask questions and try to put things into layman's terms as best as I can to understand it even more. And so, you know, it's a, it's not easy. Right. And I know that could be intimidating. But, you know, at one point I told myself I was going to take this stuff a lot more seriously. And taking it more seriously, that's part of the game.
00:45:06.160 - 00:45:33.976, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, I would not at all consider myself technical either. But, you know, it's, it's, it's not, it's not a huge mountain to get to that like minimum viable level, I think. And it's, it's well worth it as well if you're, if you're going to really dive in, head for first. I want to jump back to NFT five specifically for one last question there on the broader space. I was combing through arcade stocks a little bit yesterday, preparing for this.
00:45:33.976 - 00:46:19.232, Speaker A: And like most other NFT five projects, there was reasonable mention on composability specifically for loans. And I feel like I see that in a lot of different projects on how, you know, financial products for NFTs will be composable, will be usable across all of Defi. But it's, you know, from a user perspective, we really haven't seen much of that at all yet, which is, you know, not to, not to knock any of the projects who are building that stuff because it's, it's a monumental task, I think. But it does make me wonder, like what the first steps are. Like the catalyst to financial products being more broadly applicable would look like. Have you thought about that at all?
00:46:19.416 - 00:46:54.554, Speaker C: I think about that, like almost daily. Like, I love thinking about that. And I had like a bit of a debate on a roundtable discussion a couple weeks ago with someone who doesn't think nfts are going to cross over that much into other financial assets. I'm someone who does, and we already see that. And so first and foremost, Arcade is a settlement layer for these loans, right? Arcade's not necessarily worried about that stuff. We just want to make sure that we're prepared for when that stuff becomes more popular and stuff. But, you know, we've already seen projects out there like 4k protocol, tokenizing in real life assets.
00:46:54.554 - 00:48:14.616, Speaker C: You know, they had a. Someone had a Rolex from 4K on Arcade and escrow not too long ago. I think it rolled over for like four or five months consecutively. We saw a plot of physical land, I think, based in Arizona, that was tokenized by Fabrica come on the app and do a proof of concept to make sure that they were comfortable with encouraging their users to settle on arcade. And obviously, I'm talking to people like left and right who are building these other types of products. And so there's plenty that I want to say that just out of respect to those projects that I'm talking to on a regular basis, I won't say, but there's so many people building that. And, you know, I think, like, in a future at one point, you know, I'm of the belief that, like, a lot of things that we own, whether it's our houses, aka house deed, your card note, I think a lot of those things will be tokenized, but the owner of that asset necessarily won't care that it's tokenized or won't care that it's an NFT, right? Like, I have a house deed right now, and like, if I'm just like my neighbor who has his house deed, like, whether it's on a piece of paper in some sort of digital database being hosted by AWS or actually on chain, like, what do they care? Like, they probably aren't going to care too much, but all the benefits that come with utilizing the blockchain for, you know, the industry.
00:48:14.616 - 00:49:00.340, Speaker C: I don't mean the crypto industry, I mean, like, industries, I think is going to be really advantageous. And I do think that a lot of the people pushing that sort of stuff today are going to be forces to reckon with in the very least by making that the new standard. So I think that's going to happen. We're already seeing it happen, just like, it's just like a nibble right now, you know, but I'm also one of the guys who's always like, you know, slot first and all at once. So, you know, I'm excited for what that future is going to look like. Like I said, I'm always talking to people who are building these types of products and I do hope that those products and those users of those products, when it comes time to collateralize their financial assets, you know, use a settlement layer like arcade or not like arcade, just use arcade. Got to keep the bias here.
00:49:00.340 - 00:49:19.748, Speaker C: So yeah, I'm pretty, I'm pretty bullish on that. I don't think it's going to happen overnight. Then again, sometimes I think things aren't going to happen for a little while may happen overnight. So we'll see. You know, you got to stay flexible and adaptable. And, you know, my least favorite, because I had this debate, like I said, like they were so adamant that it's just not going to happen and they had really great reasons why they think it's not going to happen.
00:49:19.884 - 00:49:24.440, Speaker A: But what were those reasons? If you're able to recount some of them?
00:49:24.820 - 00:50:23.498, Speaker C: I just remember, like, not being able, and I don't remember the exact reasons, I apologize there, but I remember like being like, all right, like, that's a hard reason to argue. I think it was mostly like a high level, like about how like why tokenize, right? Like why should I tokenize when you could just keep these all on some centralized database that is probably never going to go down because in a way it is decentralized across, you know, various countries and freaking caves that could probably withstand nuclear blasts sort of thing. Like, and yeah, that's all great points, but what about like, you know, the integrity? I don't know, like if I could find the roundtable for you and I'll send you the link if you want to listen to it. It was actually a roundtable of just NFT finance builders, right? So like these are people who are building in the same space that we are building in and they have these opinions and that's fine, right. I guess if anything puts a chip on my shoulder to like, make sure that these types of products become, you know, bigger. But I do think it starts with luxury goods. You know, I think it starts with the easy stuff, you know, just, you know, sort of related Pokemon cards.
00:50:23.498 - 00:51:18.502, Speaker C: Right. There's big controversy recently where people working in the printing factories were taking the rare ones and selling them on their own. And so if you're buying Pokemon packs as a, you know, retail buyer, your chances have greatly decreased in getting something rare, getting something worthwhile. And so now you know, I mean, you know, I know Nintendo is getting into blockchain and why wouldn't they want to verify each card that's printed on the blockchain, right? It doesn't have to be eth because that'll just be crazy expensive. Right. But why can't they, why shouldn't they verify if they've had this issue, which to my understanding has been an issue for years now, that people were just stealing the rare prints from, you know, the factories like blockchain solves that. You can't get away with stealing those cards because at one point there's going to be some sort of integrity process where those cards are scanned before they get packed up.
00:51:18.502 - 00:51:43.128, Speaker C: And if they're not there getting packed up. Red flag, right. Systems going to red flag that and there's going to be an investigation. So I just, those types of things like that you could never, you could never get away with, without the blockchain. You could do it to a certain extent. Right? There are high integrity SaaS solutions that are essentially centralized that plenty of companies use. I don't know if Pokemon, or I keep saying Nintendo, obviously, that's not the same thing.
00:51:43.128 - 00:51:57.590, Speaker C: The Pokemon company, I don't know if they use any of those things, but if they were using those things, it still wasn't working for them. That's just one reason why I'm pretty optimistic on the, using this tokenization beyond what we use it for today.
00:51:57.710 - 00:52:43.880, Speaker A: Right, right. I think, I mean, myself and I would, I would assume or hope most of the people in this spaces are kind of in agreement on that. And it seems to me that the argument of whether or not it's like necessary or useful kind of comes down to, like, practicality versus like, ethos. And obviously, you know, given everything that's happened in this space, everything that we've seen, seen, we've kind of been reminded over and over and over again how important it is to hold that ethos true and make sure it's applied correctly. So it's one of those things where like, you know, we'll see, obviously. And I think, you know, you and I, and I'm sure a lot of other people here are all on the same more optimistic side there. We're running on time here a little bit.
00:52:43.880 - 00:52:56.088, Speaker A: I do want to, we like to, towards the end of this, get in towards some opinions, some like hot takes. I'm wondering if you have any favorite NFT collections or NFT communities, like a top three maybe?
00:52:56.224 - 00:53:15.008, Speaker C: Ah, yeah, sure. I'll start off with one of my favorite artists. Dutch tide. Dutch tide is the creator of Midnight Breeze, which are. It's a collection of 6969 banners. I use it as my Twitter banner. I use one of my midnight breezes as my Google Meets background.
00:53:15.008 - 00:53:33.996, Speaker C: So if you ever have calls with me, if you're going to be on the Skylab call later today, you know, that's. That's usually what I use as my background. Really love dutch tide. And everything that dutch tide builds, not just midnight breezes, dutch estates. I have a lot of dutch tide, maybe a little overexposed on dutch tide. I even have some physical dutch tide stuff, too. So I really love dutch tide.
00:53:33.996 - 00:54:17.680, Speaker C: And everything dutch tide builds, I. You know, there's a lot of, like, fine art stuff that I'm into because I come from the creative world, so I'm not gonna, you know, and I do think dutch tide creates fine art, but he also creates collection types of, you know, the midnight breezes is obviously a collection. And so, you know, I'm very big on. On fine art, and I thank NFTs for introducing me to fine art, because even though I kind of came from the creative world, it was. It was more of a film and tv thing. So fine art, you know, a little different definition in that world than it is, you know, on canvas. So, you know, some of the fine artists that I love and pieces that I own are from people like feuocis, you know, and, of course, we have few oceans on the app as well.
00:54:17.680 - 00:54:51.244, Speaker C: People have collateralized our few oceans pieces. I love. I love art blocks. I mean, one of the things that made me so, like, in love with the space was when Eric Snowfro released wiggles. Like, that was at a time I was minting squiggles at a time where, like I said earlier on the spaces, I didn't think that the space was going to go parabolic, like it did. And so squiggles were minting at, like, 0.035 ETH at the time, which was, depending on the price of Eth, anywhere from, like, 30 to, like, $60 a squiggle, right? And so that's, like, nailed it, right? With, like, the move there.
00:54:51.244 - 00:55:32.008, Speaker C: But, like, I wasn't minting squiggles because I thought they would go up. I thought they would go up eventually, but, you know, not two, three months later. And Squiggles really spoke to me because here I am coming from this creative space, and Eric was, you know, obviously coming from a creative place as well and using code gen art. Like, that was something I didn't even know existed like Jen, art's been around I think since like the fifties or the sixties, something like crazy like that, which is pretty shocking if you didn't know that before. And I know I was shocked when I first learned that. So I'm always going to be long squiggles. I'm always going to be a big fan of what snowfro has built with art blocks and given a platform for, you know, gen artists to produce amazing, beautiful work.
00:55:32.008 - 00:56:09.898, Speaker C: I mean like, I just love everything that comes out of our blocks. And of course let's bring it back to arcade. You know, there's been plenty of art blocks and squiggle stuff on arcade and including artists just like, you know, a few days ago Tyler Hobbs had his one of ones which are not art block stuff, but it's still Gen art. Tyler Hobbs, you know, the creator of Fidenzas had those three, one of ones on arcade and there's been plenty of fidens on the app as well. So let's call that three, let's just, let's just say dutch tide because I love dutch tide. Let's just say art blocks proxy by snow fro and then let's just say like fine art in general. If you go to like my on cyber gallery, it's, it's basically just my fine art pieces and a bunch of squiggles and a lot of dutch tide too.
00:56:09.898 - 00:56:27.300, Speaker C: And you know what, just to throw it in there because you know, Pepe is life, right? Like the creator of Pepe, Matt fury. Like I own a bunch of Matt fury stuff. No, one of ones from Matt Fury, meaning none of his fine art, which I just can't afford. So maybe one day I'll be able to. I think my Airpods just died here. So if you guys can still hear me, let me know.
00:56:27.420 - 00:56:28.100, Speaker A: Yeah, you were good.
00:56:28.140 - 00:56:32.300, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. So I think let's call it that. I'll call it four. Even though you asked me for three.
00:56:32.340 - 00:56:58.130, Speaker A: Lots of fine art. Yeah, that's okay. A lot of good recommendations there too. Stuff that I haven't heard of, so. And you might have just given me a rabbit hole to go down because I had no idea. Gen art dates back to the eighties and now I kind of want to go if there's, you know, if there's 80 years of 70 years of history there, I kind of want to go and see what that's looked like. So I'll be diving into that some point later today.
00:56:58.210 - 00:57:06.434, Speaker C: Crazy rabbit hole. Because these guys were using like computers that can't even fit in our offices nowadays. To like, do this sort of stuff. So it's like pretty insane punch card.
00:57:06.482 - 00:57:23.650, Speaker A: Type type computers, right? Yeah, that's. That's nuts. Damn. Okay, cool, man. Well, that's all we have from our end. Did you have any closing remarks? Anything you wanted to call out about Arcade or any, any last thoughts?
00:57:23.810 - 00:57:42.930, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say please visit Arcade XYz. Check out the new ux. Feedback is always welcomed, even if you don't want to use the app. I always encourage people just to check it out, let us know what they think. Perspective from every type of person is always beneficial, but also we use the app. If you want to lend, check it out. If you want to borrow, check it out.
00:57:42.930 - 00:58:00.776, Speaker C: You could always dm me. My DM's are always open. I'm happy to help people, help them learn, help them get matched with counterparties and just, you know, keep an eye on the arcade Twitter account, arcade underscore xYz. A lot of good stuff coming. Decentralization. As we mentioned it, a couple new features I'm pretty excited for on any given day. I don't know if I'm allowed to show them or not.
00:58:00.776 - 00:58:21.430, Speaker C: So on today, I'll stay conservative and I won't show them. But yeah, I think we're just going to keep building. I think we're here for the right reasons. I appreciate everyone else who builds in the NFT five space, almost everyone else. And I just think, you know, it's. We're all in this together, so we're just going to keep making the space bigger and bigger. And, you know, I think that whoever does it the best is going to have the biggest piece of the pie there.
00:58:21.510 - 00:58:33.182, Speaker A: Awesome. Great stuff, man. Yeah, I'll be checking out the arcade app myself later today. I mean, I somewhat frequent you guys anyways, so it's going to be good to check out the new ux. Awesome. Well, thanks so much for coming on, man. It's been, that's been a lot of fun.
00:58:33.246 - 00:58:35.126, Speaker C: Cool, man. This was fun. This was good.
00:58:35.238 - 00:58:36.750, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, everyone. Have a good weekend.
