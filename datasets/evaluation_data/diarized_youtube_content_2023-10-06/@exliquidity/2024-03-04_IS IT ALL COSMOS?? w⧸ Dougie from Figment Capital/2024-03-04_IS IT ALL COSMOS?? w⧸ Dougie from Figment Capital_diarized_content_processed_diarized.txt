00:00:00.200 - 00:00:28.520, Speaker A: And we are live another day, another exit liquidity. This is episode, I'm going to guess 54 50. Okay. I was close to episode 52. That's like a full year, I guess. And today we have on Dougie from Figment Capital and a bunch of other fun stuff on chain. Dougie, thanks for joining us, man.
00:00:29.420 - 00:00:43.956, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me, guys. Been watching for a bit. I'm glad I, what, second or 1st, 2nd episode of the new year? I think since your one year, I think Smokey may have gotten the honor to do the first one, but. Yeah, pleasure to be here, guys.
00:00:43.988 - 00:01:05.010, Speaker A: Excited for sure, man. Happy to have you on. It's not often that we get the chance to have on an old friend because we've been, we've been connected for what, like a year and a half by now. Back when I was still in the VC game. And then there was the whole, what was it? Reading Rainbow that one of my, that.
00:01:05.050 - 00:01:20.066, Speaker B: Failed, somewhat failed attempt at trying to get, like, people reading. It was great, though. I mean, the group chat was awesome. And it was a hard market to get attention for people to read about stuff in crypto because prices were not going up like they are now. So it's a bit of a different context.
00:01:20.178 - 00:01:29.220, Speaker A: And by now, nobody wants to spend time reading because by the time you slog through an 800 word paper, your bags have gone down or gone up. So what's, what's the point?
00:01:30.320 - 00:01:37.120, Speaker B: That's what chat GPT's for. You just plug it in there, gives you everything you need to know in 3 seconds, then you're off and running. It's a beautiful tool.
00:01:37.160 - 00:02:00.160, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, Dougie. We start out all of our episodes by, first off, hearing a little bit about your background and what brought you here today. But more importantly, we like to hear everyone's favorite exit liquidity story of your. Your favorite moments in your time in crypto of being exit liquidity.
00:02:02.220 - 00:02:38.812, Speaker B: Okay, I'm gonna start with my background and then I'll go into. I have many of those moments, so hopefully I'll think of the exact one as I go. Yeah. So for me, I've been in the space four or five years now. It's actually like research that really got me into crypto. I was studying finance and economics in college, and I was taking a class in developing country economics. And it just like, kind of brought me to crypto on a few different points where, like, currency risk can kind of be evaded for different, like, basically people in developing countries, as well as the access to, like, financial infrastructure, which a lot of people lack in many countries.
00:02:38.812 - 00:03:06.886, Speaker B: So that was good timing because shortly after that was like the bottom. In March 2020, I happened to get lucky and buy some bitcoin. And then when the prices started going up, naturally I just, like, wanted to learn more. Um, so I got really into ethereum, bitcoin, and actually shortly after Cosmos, um, and so that was in 2020, I, you know, bought. Adam just started, like, learning all that I could because cosmos was very different at that time than any other ecosystem. It still is. Um, and, yeah, it's kind of like meeting people there.
00:03:06.886 - 00:03:33.130, Speaker B: Uh, building my network got me to figment capital in early 2022. Uh, and so it's where I've been since I do early stage blockchain, investing lots in cosmos, outside of cosmos, you name it, try to cover pretty much everything. I'm someone who tries to be unbiased in how I view crypto. I think it's a space of maximalism. I try to not be a maxi. I am in definitely some ways, I'm not ignorant of that. But, yeah, so it's been awesome almost two years now.
00:03:33.130 - 00:04:15.024, Speaker B: It's cool to be working in crypto now in a bull market or what seems to be a bull market my entire time before, basically just been bear market. I joined like a month before terra crash. That gives you a gist of, like, my kind of welcoming into the space, but we come a long way and so, yeah, I mean, what brings me here, Ali, just meeting you via that fateful LinkedIn DM I sent like two years ago. So it's been great keeping in touch. Since I've been mostly in New York, you've been traveling the world. It's been cool seeing the world kind of like through the lines of, like, camera calls with you and, yeah, I got my. This is my best example of me being ex liquidity.
00:04:15.024 - 00:04:54.012, Speaker B: So this was in November, actually. I was trading meme coins on Solana. There was a token called Doug that dropped. And, you know, I thought I had alpha and I was like, oh, I'm going to buy this. This is going to go up because obviously my name is Doug and like, I have conviction in myself. I literally bought in, and right as I placed my buy, you could see just a massive red candle form where I was literally the exit liquidity. And I think today I am still probably the only holder of Doug token I couldn't sell, so why sell? There's literally no market to sell, so I remain a dough holder.
00:04:54.012 - 00:05:08.362, Speaker B: Luckily, it was just a small bag, so it's not a big loss by any means, but it's worth the meme. I literally tweeted, like, this is mass adoption post the Doug token, and before I could even do that, it was already gone. So happens to the best of us. Got to chase the meme sometimes I.
00:05:08.386 - 00:05:35.390, Speaker A: Think that's definitely one of the most understandable exit liquidity stories we've had. Like, it's, you know, you had to do it, right? It was your name. There's a token out there called artificial liquid intelligence. Ticker is Ali. My friend Matt, every time he sees, he, every time he sees a transaction on ClO, he always sends it to me. He's like, some big transaction. He's like, why didn't you, like, where was my insider information? Dude, what the hell?
00:05:36.130 - 00:05:36.610, Speaker B: You.
00:05:36.690 - 00:06:07.190, Speaker A: They just have a special place in your heart. They have to, um, they have to. I'm curious about, uh, so you, you work at Figment or you've been there for a while? Um, in my view, figment is like, definitely a bit of a different fund or like, has a different thesis from most other ones, especially given that, um, I don't know whether Figment capital came first or whether figment, the infrastructure provider, came first. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Kind of clear there?
00:06:08.090 - 00:06:43.392, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So Figment came first. So Figment launched in, I believe, 2019, like very, very early Pos days. So I think the first network that Figment supported was actually the Cosmos hub and its testnet launch, which again, was now a while back. And so the way that Figment capital came to be, I'll keep this somewhat short, but basically, validators oftentimes get opportunities to invest the networks that they support. It's basically a way to give them skin in the game. And Figment being a pretty big validator starting in 2020, 2021, was getting a lot of these opportunities.
00:06:43.392 - 00:07:29.880, Speaker B: And so instead of going the corporate PC model, where you invest off your balance sheet and are kind of limited to the size of your balance sheet, Figment had the unique idea to start externally funded, which is now called Figment Capital. And so we share a name and we work very closely together, but we're unique in the sense that we have this great relationship, but we don't invest strategically for Figment. So we invest in the stuff that our team deems is like a compelling investment opportunity, not necessarily something that's a good opportunity for the validator. And so we're different from a lot of CPC's that exist because they invest strategically first and returns are kind of a secondary thing for them. And so, yeah, you know, our fund has been kicking around since 2021. I joined about a year after its launch. And that's really a story.
00:07:29.880 - 00:07:39.068, Speaker B: It's. We've come a long way. You know, when I joined, we were a very small fund. We have grown a bit since, and it's been cool. Kind of like being here for that growth story.
00:07:39.204 - 00:07:54.940, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And is the. Obviously, you talk a lot about Cosmos. You've. You've got a bad kid. PFP. Is, is that, uh, is there a lot of overlap with that at Figment? Do you guys do a lot of stuff in the Cosmos space, or is that more of a personal interest?
00:07:56.360 - 00:08:38.194, Speaker B: Yeah. So, um, for me, Cosmos is personal and both professional. Like, for me, Cosmos is really where I first, like, dug into crypto and, like, really started to meet people again. It was like, I have a lot of thanks to Oda Cosmos for kind of, like, getting me deeply involved in this space. Like, a lot of people in cosmos, when I didn't know anything about crypto, quite frankly, like, gave me the time of day to, like, explain things to me, kind of coached me in certain regards, give me opportunities that maybe I wasn't quite ready for at that time and ultimately, like, got me to where I am today. Like, I actually kind of was able to get to this position because I was writing twitter threads and a bunch of different cosmos chains back in, like, 2021 and just caught the right eyes, I guess, got kind of lucky. And that led me to basically get to where I am.
00:08:38.194 - 00:09:06.469, Speaker B: And it's also professional because our fund is definitely one of the, I'd say, bigger Cosmos investors. We don't do cosmos only by any means, but it's a big part of our portfolio. I think we support, I don't know, there's an exact number, but quite a few Cosmos chains and Cosmos teams. We've just been believers in the app chain thesis for quite a long time. And I think for us, we want to support the best teams building app chains. We think it just makes sense for a number of reasons. And then that also led us to, I think, being an early investor in Celestia as well.
00:09:06.469 - 00:09:26.630, Speaker B: And so we obviously support the app roll up thesis and the roll thesis as a whole and the modular thesis, all that good stuff. I personally view Celestia as a part of cosmos. Maybe they don't go old head for believing that. I don't think it's a common belief, but, yeah, again, it's been awesome supporting cosmos personally, but also as a member of my fund for a couple years now.
00:09:30.810 - 00:09:32.030, Speaker C: You'Re muted, Ellie.
00:09:33.170 - 00:09:34.470, Speaker A: Thanks for that. Sorry.
00:09:35.410 - 00:09:36.162, Speaker B: All good, man.
00:09:36.226 - 00:09:53.926, Speaker A: Yeah. Being early in Celestia is definitely no, no small achievement, especially now, given everything that at least, like, from a social perspective, everything that people are talking about and then all the. All the subsequent partnerships, too, that are coming out. Definitely a lot of exciting stuff there.
00:09:53.958 - 00:10:09.742, Speaker B: And crazy, super proud of that team. Like, years in the making. I remember first reading the Celestia, like, well, the lazy ledger went years back, and I had no understanding what was going on. Like, 2020 me or whatever that was, was not ready.
00:10:09.886 - 00:10:36.818, Speaker A: I remember seeing, like, I think it was, like, altcoin psycho or someone, like, talking about how it was just, like, alpha hidden in plain sight. And I went and read it, and I, like, this was when I thought, like, ust would be, like, the future of stable coins. Like, I read that thing and I was like, like, wow, this is so cool. I had no idea what I was. What I was talking about, but I was right in the end, I guess, even though I didn't know you were.
00:10:36.834 - 00:10:41.498, Speaker B: Right about one of the two things you mentioned there, unfortunately, we were both wrong in the other thing that you.
00:10:41.594 - 00:10:48.654, Speaker A: Horrendously wrong, too. Like, not even, like, a little bit wrong, but embarrassingly wrong, but, uh, I.
00:10:48.662 - 00:10:57.414, Speaker B: Could say, in hindsight, hilariously wrong is how I'd frame it. You know, it was a bet worth taking, I think. But obviously, I was blind to a few pretty obvious things in high.
00:10:57.462 - 00:11:07.686, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the. The cost of doing business here, I think. I definitely wouldn't trade it. Learned. Learned a lot of valuable lessons throughout that. Um, agreed. Before we, uh.
00:11:07.686 - 00:11:42.330, Speaker A: Before we dive, like, too deep into ecosystem or I guess, like, more so. Cause we wanna talk about. Spend a little bit of time talking about Cosmos before we talk about what's there, I'm curious as to, like. I mean, you mentioned that you kind of owe a lot of where you're at now due to the early stages of being in Cosmos and writing about it. What specifically from, like, an infrastructural perspective, do you think makes cosmos exciting or what makes it more differentiated to you compared to looking at, you know, a traditional, like, monolithic l one?
00:11:43.750 - 00:12:34.002, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think there's a few different angles you can look at. The first, just like the tech angle itself, which is. Cosmos was the first to actually offer developers, like, application developers, specifically, the opportunity to, like, customize the blockchain that their applications built on top of. An easy example is, like, if you're uniswap on Ethereum, you can't really? I mean, you could try to politic your way into doing this, but it's very difficult to actually alter the Ethereum core protocol in a way that benefits uniswap because again, there's a lot of other applications built on Ethereum that have differing views and different users who are different views. So it's a very challenging landscape to actually go about and, like, pass the EIP to, like, advantage Lee, position your protocol. So what cosmos enables, again, to, like, use osmosis as a comparison? Like, osmosis controls the stack that they're built on from top to bottom. There's validators that support it that obviously have governance power.
00:12:34.002 - 00:13:27.812, Speaker B: But if osmosis wants to pass something to basically further enhance the osmosis core application, like the AMm, they're largely able to do that. And so far they've done that with, like, work with scip on capturing mvv in an in protocol way and, you know, giving value to stakers and just doing things that, you know, an application building on a model will think blockchain just cannot do. And it's been pretty exciting, I think, to see how that's all evolved on Cosmos over the last few years. Like, we've seen a number of teams come to Cosmos because they want to basically embrace that customizability aspect that you can't get on a monolithic l one. And I think, like, you know, with app roll ups as well, there's interesting design space for that. And then the last thing I want to mention is like, you know, I think I undervalued this for a point in time, but I think it really matters is, like, cultural and, like, actually idle ideological sovereignty. When you are building an application on Ethereum, you're a part of Ethereum.
00:13:27.812 - 00:13:56.952, Speaker B: Like, you're generally bought into that ethos. You're part of that ecosystem community. When you build an app chain, you are the ethos, you are the community, and you can design the culture around, like, your own ideals, the community's ideals, all these things. And so I'm a big believer in sovereignty. I think, like, people naturally seek it, especially at a certain scale. And Cosmos tech stack allows that to happen. And I think, like, we'd all be kind of, you know, blind to not say that cultural identification doesn't have a role in crypto.
00:13:56.952 - 00:14:04.390, Speaker B: It very much does, in my opinion. And cosmos uniquely allows people to kind of embrace that makes sense.
00:14:05.730 - 00:14:48.640, Speaker C: Yeah. I like what you said about kind of the adjustment that Cosmos app chains can make, that ethereum dapps really can't make. That's in their favor. I really was excited to have you on just because I feel like I have a high level understanding of the cosmos ecosystem. But I think what entices me about crypto is getting into the weeds on what the core believers are arguing about within each ecosystem. I feel like I have a good grasp on the arguments within the eth ecosystem. Risks with eigen layer, different ercs, whatever it may be.
00:14:48.640 - 00:15:15.876, Speaker C: What are people talking about in the cosmos ecosystem? What are the improvements that one group wants to make versus another? Because I've heard high level that there's been, like, big blockers in different ecos or at different stages with, like, what was supposed to be Adam 2.0 and all these other things. Is there any, like, ounce of value in them or some understanding that maybe general, you know, crypto people are not understanding or not seeing?
00:15:15.908 - 00:15:49.188, Speaker B: So Cosmos is really, really complicated, and the ecosystem, I'll include myself in it. We fight like family, like, people really care about it. And there's some pretty nasty battles that tend to happen. It seems like every year at least. I think the first thing that's important to address is there's no real definition of what cosmos is, because some people might say it's the Cosmos hub and the things built around it, because that was the first blockchain to be deployed on Cosmos, and now there's ics in these things. But obviously, there's an underlying tech stack. The Cosmos SDK, which a lot of different protocols are built on top of.
00:15:49.188 - 00:16:29.738, Speaker B: DYDX now is Celestia is, say, many others, and, like, whether they're a part of Cosmos is a point of contention in itself. You might talk to different members of their teams and they're going to give different answers. But to zoom in on the Cosmos hub, that's generally where most of the contention exists. I think the biggest argument that's persisted over my time in cosmos has been whether or not the Cosmos hub should have smart contracts. So right now, and to date, the Cosmos hub has not had smart contracts. It basically right now acts as a security protocol where different chains via ics can leverage staked Atom for security. And so neutron exists in that way, strat exists in that way.
00:16:29.738 - 00:16:56.978, Speaker B: There's a few others as well, and there's a lot of contention around ics and whether or not that should exist. And so it really, in my opinion, largely boils down to the Cosmos hub. Atom 2.0 is another example of a highly contentious debate that didn't end up getting passed that surrounded the Cosmos hub and its future. To boil it down. It was kind of like, okay, we have this token with quite a bit of value, but not a lot of utility. And so the people that were supporting Adam 2.0
00:16:56.978 - 00:17:20.390, Speaker B: basically were thinking of ways to actually bring value to Adam as a token. Again, it wasn't shot down, but one of its components was ICS. And so that has been built out. Other components of it are kind of in the works, mostly actually built by third party teams. Not really directly associated with Cosmos Hub. But, yeah, Cosmos governance can be a mess, I'll say that. And this is a good history there to look into.
00:17:23.010 - 00:17:26.674, Speaker C: When you say ICS, you're mentioning interchange security.
00:17:26.802 - 00:18:26.880, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Please throughout this, correct me if, or like, stop me if I'm like going too in depth explaining the high levels. So ICS is a shared security mechanism that is supported by the cosmos hub that basically consumer chains that they're called are able to leverage the security staked on the Cosmos hub by atom stakers to secure their own protocol. And so most cosmos chains to date, because ICS hasn't existed for that long, have their own validator set and therefore their own security propositions for Stargaze, for example, where bad kids exist, is secured by star staking. And so stakers who want to support Stargaze stake their stars tokens and kind of like due to the fragmentation that that kind of creates naturally when you have potentially 1000 chains with their own security propositions. The idea was to basically centralize security around the cosmos hub, which is the most liquid and most valuable token today in cosmos. Well, depends on how you define cosmos.
00:18:26.880 - 00:18:38.410, Speaker B: I think Celestia is ahead of it at this point. And so the idea was to basically build an ecosystem which all leverages the cosmos hub security without actually having to acquire smart contracts on the Cosmos hub.
00:18:40.990 - 00:19:03.314, Speaker C: Interesting. And so can you explain, like, the journey that some of these, like, consumer chains go through for setting up that validator set? Is it, is the meta just airdrop to Atom stakers and just hope your token has a market cap valuable enough for, for people to kind of like, value securing it?
00:19:03.362 - 00:19:30.670, Speaker B: This answer probably won't age well because ICS is, like, being reworked. I think, like, ics 2.0 is, like, on the horizon. And so that's one thing to be cognizant of and look out for right now. How it works is basically it's up to each consumer chain to, like, go out to governance and submit a proposal which basically outlines why they should be a consumer chain and receive security from the cosmos hub. There's no one size fits all model, like what neutron proposed versus what stripe proposed. Vastly different.
00:19:30.670 - 00:20:11.970, Speaker B: Definitely it's in your best interest to appeal to token holders because they ultimately have the vote to say yes or no. Another kind of factor in this is validators who also have a governance vote. And so the one big critique of ICS to date, and again, maybe I'm biased because of my experience and time spent with figment is validators are kind of getting the short end of the stick right now. They're not being paid out in the same way that token holders are. And the reason for that is because validators are actually running the infrastructure and paying the cost to actually do that. Where token holders do not do that, you just stake with a validator, you get staking rewards and you're a happy person. I think where ICS 2.0
00:20:11.970 - 00:20:37.890, Speaker B: and the new work and thought being put into it is we have this trilemma almost where you have atom holders, atom validators and consumer chains. How do we satisfy all three? Crypto loves trilemmas, TBD. There's definitely a lot of interesting discussion going on in the forums right now. We don't need to get in too much detail into that, but I would recommend reading all of that discussion because it's really insightful.
00:20:40.150 - 00:21:12.536, Speaker C: Okay. And just last bit on the security aspect, because I think the whole Eigen layer ecosystem is pretty interesting. And there's conversation on how I'm going to butcher this explanation, but how their AV's systems can kind of be the security solution instead of going the airdrop for validators. Could you maybe touch on the differences and maybe like what might why one is worse versus the other?
00:21:12.608 - 00:22:04.464, Speaker B: So from a function standpoint, there's one big difference in how avss work versus how ICs today works. And I think this will actually change to function more like avss. But basically right now, um, every single validator on the cosmos hub is required to support a consumer chain where for avss, if you're a theory invalidator, um, you don't have to support every single AV's that launches. Um, you know, one of the reasons why like LRT's exist is like this can like actually help like figure out for validators which avss they'll support versus which they wouldn't. There's an ever evolving design space around that. But yeah, in terms of the functionality and application of it, it's largely similar. The big difference is Eigen layer is kind of more like avalanche with subnets where you don't need every single validator to actually support every single subnet.
00:22:04.464 - 00:22:37.064, Speaker B: You just need a select amount that basically you're like, okay, we want to do this. We like this proposition. But I do think ics will evolve to have more of a subnet style approach. One interesting thing to note is that eigenlayer is actually going to be coming to Cosmos. Whether it's through ethos or teams building out their own avss, there's no reason why it can't happen. And it's one of the things that I'm most excited about. I've actually been tweeting about this for, like, a while now, and it's actually happening, which is awesome, because I think, like, for Cosmos, like, why not bridge this gap? Like, there's really no reason not to be.
00:22:37.064 - 00:22:45.660, Speaker B: Sounds like maybe some tribalist elements, but it's a pretty exciting thing to kind of see these two ecosystems fully merged together and become kind of like one big happy family.
00:22:46.000 - 00:22:58.980, Speaker A: Wait, so if you can bootstrap security with Eigen layer on Cosmos chains, what is Cosmos two? Like, why do we still need ics?
00:23:01.040 - 00:23:22.314, Speaker B: That's a big question you're asking there. I mean, again, that's when you can argue that the cosmos is not necessarily a function of the Cosmos hub. It could be something bigger, like the Cosmos SDK, which, like, is very much alive and well. If you're looking at everything happening between. Obviously, you guys talked to Smokey last week. Like, he's building on Cosmos initiatives. Building on Cosmos.
00:23:22.314 - 00:23:43.532, Speaker B: A bunch of great teams are. And so, yeah, it's hard to say how this impacts the cosmos hub. I mean, the Cosmos hub could use Eigen layer. It just really is going to be interesting. I'm not here to really take a stance on, like, what's going to happen, but I do think economic security is going to be one of the really interesting things to watch throughout the, you know, persistence of this bull cycle that we're in.
00:23:43.676 - 00:23:54.348, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Definitely a question I am not remotely qualified to unpack. So we're just gonna. We're just gonna move on from that one. Let's talk.
00:23:54.444 - 00:23:55.520, Speaker B: Neither am I.
00:23:55.820 - 00:24:26.668, Speaker A: Let's talk ecosystem a little bit. I. Maybe this is, like, the wrong understanding, but I feel like when I hear people say cosmos ecosystem, I find that to be, like, a bit of a misnomer. Like, they're not really any more connected than an app on Solana. Well, an app on one l two. And an app on another l two. I don't really consider Cosmos apps to be part of this ecosystem necessarily.
00:24:26.668 - 00:24:53.440, Speaker A: Would you say that makes sense, or do you still consider, because you said yourself, if you are running an app chain on Cosmos, you have the. The. I guess, the privilege and the burden of being able to create your own culture and community and ethos. But by the same token, you also can't exactly leverage that of what's around you as easily. Is that the case when it comes to building on the cosmos?
00:24:55.100 - 00:25:48.846, Speaker B: So it is in terms of how closely you want to associate yourself with Cosmos. Again, deploying an application on Solana, you better want to be a part of Solana, or else what are you doing? Whereas in Cosmos, you have the optionality to be like, all right, I'm going to be fully bought in or not bought in at all, or somewhere in the middle. The one big difference between two l two s versus two Cosmos app chains is Cosmos has an enshrined interoperability protocol called IBC. It comes out of the box with the Cosmos SDK. Essentially, it's like a light, client based bridging mechanism that connects cosmos chains. And the TLDR of how it functions is essentially like, instead of actually having trust placed on the bridge. So for AXLR, wormhole, et cetera, you are depending on security and the trustfulness of the consensus for each of those things.
00:25:48.846 - 00:26:09.936, Speaker B: Whereas for IPC, basically, it's just verifying that chain a and chain b have reached consensus. And if that is the case, then you can go ahead and bridge. So there's no trust placed on the bridge in between them. IBC is actually, like, likely going to be ported over to Ethereum and rollups as well. I know union polymer. I think a few other teams are working on that as well. So that'll happen.
00:26:09.936 - 00:26:31.918, Speaker B: At which point, what is cosmos? I have part of my french no fucking idea. But, you know, I think, like, right now, the big difference, I would say, is, like, having an enshrined interop protocol connecting them where for l two s, there's nothing like that that exists today. Like, it's. There's a plethora of options, or you can just go through the l one, which takes forever, but I guess that would be the enshrined way to do that.
00:26:32.054 - 00:26:53.036, Speaker A: It's interesting. You have to, like, ask questions if you're a cosmos builder, I feel like you have to ask questions that don't exist elsewhere. Like, stuff that you would never think would. Would matter on a normal. Or our definition of what a normal chain is. And, like, definitions are. Like, definitions are, like, flimsy almost.
00:26:53.036 - 00:27:00.760, Speaker A: It feels like it's. It's tough to, like, really, like. Like, what is the cosmos really? You know, like, I don't.
00:27:02.380 - 00:27:12.172, Speaker B: It was way easier to define a few years ago, and then now that cosmos is actually, like, done well, it's just become way more confusing because the bigger it grows, the harder it gets to define, pretty much.
00:27:12.196 - 00:27:59.710, Speaker A: I'm sure. I'm sure. I think. I think, for me, what really helped me understand, at least from someone who's more on the, I guess, app building side, someone who's more interested in stuff like defi and consumer applications, I think the Dy DX change was something that really helped sell kind of why someone would go build on cosmos. And it's not like they did it because they wanted to be a cosmos chain, because they wanted to buy into that philosophy in the way that, like, Unibot going to Solana wanted to get some of that hype. It has nothing to do with that. It's more so just they wanted the sovereignty to create infrastructure that they can't create elsewhere, where they can't alter the rules of other chains.
00:27:59.710 - 00:28:22.440, Speaker A: So let's just. Let's just make our own. That, to me, made a lot of sense, and it was like, it was the first use case I understood, um, where, like, of something that is only possible in the cosmos. Um, what are some other examples you've seen of apps that exist there that can't exist elsewhere?
00:28:24.020 - 00:28:53.280, Speaker B: It's a great question. Um, you know, so far, Celestia is the only modular da layer that exists. Um, mind you, Eigen is building their own solution. Avail is going to exist as few others as well. But Celestia has benefited, I think, in its time to market by using a stack that's already been battle tested. They're using tendermint consensus, they're using the Cosmos SDK. All of these things that have been tested throughout the years of cosmos existing.
00:28:53.280 - 00:29:25.678, Speaker B: And it also shows some strengths, I think, in terms of its access to cosmos. Cosmosis has been very key in Celestia's early growth. And so having that accessibility, I think, has been very valuable for them. And I think, beyond that. Another example I started talking about it was osmosis. Osmosis, in my opinion, is one of the most advanced amms that exists because they've been able to do things at the protocol layer before anyone else even really thought to. Mind you, they do miss out, maybe on some network effects.
00:29:25.678 - 00:30:12.200, Speaker B: You're not on Solana, you're not on Ethereum, you're bringing liquidity to osmosis specifically. But the stuff we've done with Mev, the stuff they've been able to do with different other things. The governance as well is just, I think, very innovative, and it's just going to keep going further. I think besides that, I mean, look at Barachain. Barachain has been able to do some super interesting things with consensus, with proof of liquidity that has never existed before. And then you have teams like Anisha and dimension that are serving as a l one settlement layer for different roll ups and enabling all sorts of composability benefits that really no one else has been able to derive yet. And so I think, like, you know, to summarize this answer, I think what I've always kind of seen Cosmos as is, like, the testing grounds for a lot of other kind of ecosystems to look at and follow or choose not to follow if something goes wrong.
00:30:12.200 - 00:30:51.502, Speaker B: I do think in many ways, Ethereum's roadmap has evolved to match Cosmos. Cosmos had app chains before Ethereum even had roll ups. And now you're seeing app roll ups exist on Ethereum, like Evo. And so it's all kind of going in the same direction. And it also makes sense now that we're seeing Ethereum and Cosmos really merged together, like, in five years, are we going to know what's Ethereum and what's Cosmos? Maybe not. It's hard to say right now, in crypto's nascent sea, it makes sense to have this, like, kind of divide and have these different cultures and ecosystems. But I do think over time, it's going to be a lot more blurred lines, and probably Cosmos will be a big part of crypto without really anyone even knowing it.
00:30:51.646 - 00:31:12.454, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that's, that's the thesis for a lot of teams building on there, right. Is people don't need to know what chain we're on, necessarily. They just need a good application. I. The idea of cosmos being like a sandbox or like a place to test things out is, as an outsider, one that, that really resonates. And I think that.
00:31:12.454 - 00:31:43.720, Speaker A: And maybe, maybe your thesis is different for this. I don't know exactly know, like, what the, what the core of the community thinks. But to me, that really, like, exemplifies kind of the bad kids, like, builder thesis. And I'm wondering, like, kind of what can you tell? Like, I feel like not enough people know about that sort of culture or, like, what it is really. Can you talk a little bit about that? Because I know you've been, I mean, as long as I've known you, you've, you've been a bad kid.
00:31:45.130 - 00:32:14.422, Speaker B: Yeah, bad kids are an interesting one. I think a lot of us just silently bought into it and, like, these are freaking awesome. Like, let's. Let's do this. It's kind of like, yeah, the rebellious nature of cosmos. I think, like, the obvious thing to do if you're a smart contract developer. Like, really anyone who's interested in building on chain for a while just to go on Ethereum, obviously, Solana, others came to exist, but, like, Cosmos was one of the first ecosystems to really exist besides Ethereum in terms of, like, smart contract environments.
00:32:14.422 - 00:32:57.310, Speaker B: And so I think it was a rebellious choice to go to Cosmos to kind of, like, believe in the multi chain app chain thesis, because for a while, no one believed in that, really, besides, like, Cosmos and then Polkadot and so, yeah, kind of, like, throughout its history, I think maybe without even realizing it, a lot of us kind of, by supporting cosmos, viewed ourselves as, like, the bad kids of crypto, and not being. Not listening to people who kind of said, like, no, this is the right design. Cosmos is the wrong design. And, you know, there's been a lot of times, I think, where people doubted whether or not cosmos would make it, like, the last. Besides, until recently, the last year was pretty tough. Cosmos, like, I think a lot of people were asking pretty existential questions about it. I was on a few panels and people were like, cosmos has six months to live.
00:32:57.310 - 00:33:16.496, Speaker B: What do you do? And it's like, oh, damn. And, like, those six months are already up. So I think we've survived it. But, like, I think, again, it's like being determined to, like, let this tax, this tech stack thrive, let the ecosystem thrive. All summarizes bad kids, basically, like, whoever drew that up, amazing job, because they're freaking awesome.
00:33:16.648 - 00:33:17.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:18.480 - 00:33:20.888, Speaker C: Was it really like an eleven year old or.
00:33:20.984 - 00:33:37.638, Speaker B: I actually have no idea. That's why I said whoever, like, there's rumors out there. I don't think it's an eleven year old, but it certainly could be if so, that eleven year old did a lot cooler things at that age than I did. I, um. Someone out there probably knows, but I actually do not know who the bad creator is.
00:33:37.654 - 00:33:45.814, Speaker A: That would be kind of messed up. Somebody sat their kid down and was like, draw 10,000 different, like, characters for me. That would be.
00:33:45.902 - 00:33:59.434, Speaker B: Maybe the kid was just doodling and, like, his, his or her school book anyways, his journal and then his, like, the parent was like, oh, these are awesome. I love Cosmos. Let's put this on stargaze and then the rest of history, I don't know. We can all speculate.
00:33:59.622 - 00:34:23.270, Speaker A: I think bad kids have been, like, my only, like, cosmos exposure, I guess, if you can. If you can call it that. I guess there really is nothing else. I mean, nothing else that is, like, holy cosmos besides, like, Adam, which nobody, you know, nobody cares about that, let's be honest. And, like, maybe osmosis. That's, like, more defi centered and, like, also, you know, not. Not ideal.
00:34:24.620 - 00:34:37.420, Speaker B: Has, uh. Again, I'm kind of, like, unaware of this because I've just been in cosmos for a while. Is bad kids. One of those things is, like, a cultural artifact of cosmos. Like, even outside of Cosmos, everyone's like, that's cosmos. Have you. Have we hit that point?
00:34:37.460 - 00:34:39.700, Speaker A: I don't know. I. I think.
00:34:39.780 - 00:34:40.520, Speaker B: I think.
00:34:41.060 - 00:34:53.180, Speaker A: I think we're lucky, because I. I don't remember why, but I bought two, like, maybe two and a half, two years ago, something like that. Um, when they were, like, 400, I think, like, a couple hundred dollars.
00:34:53.800 - 00:34:54.224, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:54.272 - 00:35:29.330, Speaker A: And I was like, I'm just gonna. I think I was just listening to someone smarter than me, and I was like, I'm just gonna let this be, like, my cosmos thing, you know, I don't need anything else. Maybe I'll stake some Adam for airdrops, but that's it. And now that they're, like, getting attention via airdrops and via, you know, like, a smooth ten x in price, I think now people are more aware, the people who have been around for a while, and I. I think everybody sort of had somewhat of a cosmo. Not everybody, but a lot of people who've been around long enough had somewhat of a. Of a cosmos phase.
00:35:29.330 - 00:35:47.890, Speaker A: If you're like me, you were probably turned off to it from just the user experience, from going over there and just having to deal with that. What's happening there? Is there a lot of concentrated effort to address the issues with ux?
00:35:49.990 - 00:36:35.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say so. Again, this is hard because the big issue that Cosmos has run into is when issues cross over into other app chains, and now you're treading on people's land almost. It's like, okay, who really controls the stack that connects everything? Cosmos is different than Solana, Ethereum, and other l one s and ecosystems that have a foundation that's basically responsible for looking after the health of the protocol and ecosystem. Cosmos has no centralized foundation. It has a bunch of different orgs that exist and try to all help Cosmos. But it tends to be a complicated matter to get really anything done that helps everyone out in Cosmos. And, yeah, I think Kepler has been doing a lot of work to try to revamp Kepler wallet.
00:36:35.620 - 00:37:36.546, Speaker B: For those unfamiliar, Kepler is in many ways the metamask of Cosmos, the go to wallet for most cosmos users. Actually, metamask has recently been brought over to Cosmos via metamask snaps. So people can actually use metamask now, which is a great unlock. And, yeah, I think skip has done interesting work with IBC fun, which basically tries to abstract the complexity of using IBC to transact between different chains. Where you go to this one dashboard, you say, I want to swap Osmo for Kujira, and then it gives you, basically, it's like Jupiter, but for cross chain IPC stuff, it's like, this is the best route based on the optimizations you want, and then it executes that transaction for you. So I do think we're seeing a good amount of abstraction from, like, the multi chain kind of element of Cosmos, but we still have a ways to go. Like, today, I was trying to play around on a devnet, and I literally couldn't find it in my Cosmos wallet because I, like, go to the faucet, it's like, what's your address? And I'm like, I have no idea what my address is.
00:37:36.546 - 00:38:03.430, Speaker B: And so we still have work to do. Mind you, it's the devnet. So, like, that's about the earliest of stages you can go. But I do think, like, that's the big thing that crypto is a whole lot to solve for. Like, if Ethereum is going to move towards l two s and op chains, like, they're going to run to all the same UX issues. And that's why I think a lot of people still support Solana, because, like, Solana is super easy to use, it's cheap to use, everything's accessible, so you don't run into the complexity of having to manage multiple chains, multiple potential wallets, and everything in between.
00:38:06.120 - 00:38:43.070, Speaker C: Yeah, the fragmentation issue is like a shared one across a bunch of ecosystems. Now, Ethereum, Cosmos, you mentioned how cosmos is like more of a sandbox to try things and some of the things that osmosis tried. I sort of liked that team for a while. I've listened to some of their interviews, but I haven't kept up with what they're doing. Have there been any kind of new breakthroughs in solving some of the liquidity fragmentation across defi within osmosis?
00:38:44.450 - 00:39:42.692, Speaker B: Months ago now, I think, developed and released concentrated liquidity. So that's a great way to make liquidity that exists in osmosis just more efficient, because especially in the bear market, like post terra, there was a lack of liquidity that made transacting quite prohibitive for cosmos more broadly. Again, I think it's more abstraction rather than unifying liquidity. It's hard because chains want to have their own dexs and own their own liquidity, but at the same time, for users, it becomes very challenging to actually use that type of structure. And so that is where IBC fun is valuable, because it does, again, be able to route into different pools and different chains. But I think, like, what say thinks it's best for its own liquidity, what DyDx thinks, what's best for its own liquidity, and what osmosis thinks what's best for its own liquidity are always going to be butting heads to a degree, as a chain, especially a defi focused chain, your moat is liquidity in many ways. And so you're not really naturally incentivized to share that with everyone else.
00:39:42.692 - 00:40:03.090, Speaker B: Naturally. It does happen across exists, obviously, outside of cosmos. And so I think we're going to see things get better. But, yeah, that was a long non answer. I'd say I feel like stuff is happening, but at the same time, it's like, not openly embraced necessarily, just given the stuff that people care about.
00:40:05.830 - 00:40:21.346, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we've kind of went pretty deep into the cosmos ecosystem. I'm sure you're exploring more than just the cosmos ecosystem. Anything else outside of that that you're interested in these days?
00:40:21.378 - 00:40:55.040, Speaker B: Yeah, so I've been playing around, playing around a lot on sweat, I'd say the last, like six or so weeks, maybe a month, two months now. Just. I like trying net new blockchains, like things that swe's obviously new with move. It has this, like, novel consensus mechanisms, all these different things. And so that's like playing around with things and kind of trying to break them, see what works. I was saying earlier, the one thing I think I've under explored is roll ups on Ethereum. I've used the basics, but I'm definitely not super, super in the weeds yet there.
00:40:55.040 - 00:41:20.234, Speaker B: So I still have a lot to learn in that capacity. But honestly, I'm someone who uses blockchains because I enjoy using them. It's just a way that I learn. I learn by making mistakes and figuring out ways to fix those mistakes and identifying problems that hopefully translate to good outcomes and kind of like my job and, yeah, I mean, like everyone else. I've been on Solana quite a bit. Love Solana. I really just like everything.
00:41:20.234 - 00:41:24.950, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm trying to think of anything else. What do you guys use the most?
00:41:28.810 - 00:41:29.194, Speaker C: Question.
00:41:29.242 - 00:41:30.258, Speaker B: It's a hard answer, right?
00:41:30.314 - 00:42:05.946, Speaker A: I think, surprisingly enough, like, when I think about the last, like, six months, I don't really think I use roll ups either. Genuinely. I farm the shit out of those things, but I I don't really like, I mean, in some cases, if a token exists on Ethereum that I. That I want to hold, and it's also available on an l two with decent liquidity, I'll buy it on the l two every time. Just because of gas. Yeah, besides that, like, I don't. I don't really do too much on l two s.
00:42:05.946 - 00:42:22.110, Speaker A: I do quite a bit on Solana these days, quite a bit on main net. But I don't know. I'm not too active in the roll up game anymore, which I didn't even realize until, like, you brought it up. I was like. I was like, damn. Like, really? That's kind of surprising. I feel like everyone's on l two s, and I realized, like, I'm not even.
00:42:23.530 - 00:42:24.978, Speaker B: I assumed you were deep in l.
00:42:24.994 - 00:42:43.060, Speaker A: Two s. I definitely have been. Like, the thing is, is not enough interesting stuff has been going on there for me to pay attention. There's a lot of really cool teams building, and they're. I think they are building stuff that will bring me there. But, you know, stuff takes time. Right now is, like, a.
00:42:43.400 - 00:43:03.858, Speaker C: It's a lot of infrastructure. Not enough, like, cool apps. I think it's the l two problem right now. Like, I don't even remember the last transaction I did on arbitrary. It might have been like DMT, but I've messed around with base. But, yeah, Solana has been fun, and I.
00:43:03.994 - 00:43:05.434, Speaker B: Yes, Lana's been great.
00:43:05.602 - 00:43:06.898, Speaker C: Was late to the Solana game.
00:43:06.954 - 00:43:30.232, Speaker B: I do think, like, I mean, I've thoroughly enjoyed using both hyper liquid and evo. Unfortunately, I'm not the best perpetrator, and so I try to avoid kind of them right now because it's just, like, a habit I'm trying to break. But, like, I think both applications are of brilliantly designed and kind of, like, embrace. Like, why l two s are a valid solution for a lot of things.
00:43:30.296 - 00:43:32.420, Speaker A: Hyper liquids, a cosmos chain. Dougie.
00:43:33.960 - 00:43:34.928, Speaker B: Is it on arbitrary?
00:43:34.944 - 00:43:39.020, Speaker A: Its onboarding is on arbitrum, but hyper liquid itself is a cosmos chain.
00:43:39.840 - 00:43:40.860, Speaker B: Are you serious?
00:43:41.160 - 00:43:42.580, Speaker A: I am pretty sure.
00:43:44.480 - 00:43:45.168, Speaker B: Wow.
00:43:45.304 - 00:44:27.180, Speaker A: I think they have plans to migrate to being an app specific l two, but as far as I remember, they have been. I mean, it. Say what? Like, the argument against, like, these perp dexs on app specific chains not named DydX is that, you know, you're dealing with a front end for a Microsoft Excel sheet, basically. But, uh, yeah, no, I'm pretty sure hyper liquid is a cosmos chain, and they have, like, rough plans to move to their own, like, EVM compatible. I don't know whether it's arbitrum or what, but their own EVM compatible.
00:44:27.920 - 00:44:37.336, Speaker B: L two to my friends are hyper liquid. I apologize. I thought you were just an application on arbitrum. A great application, but I didn't realize that.
00:44:37.408 - 00:44:50.070, Speaker A: Definitely, yeah, it's very surprising. I remember onboarding there first, and I was like, I didn't really believe it at first. I was like, this. This is like, I'm just using arbitrum, right? Like, that's what it feels like.
00:44:51.370 - 00:45:03.306, Speaker B: That's kind of proving the thesis of, like, you're going to use cosmos without even knowing it. Like, here I am. I think I'm pretty deep in the space, and I didn't even know until now. I've been using it for like, a long time.
00:45:03.378 - 00:45:15.496, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy. They have a great thing going. Definitely. I'm a big fan of theirs. Um, I have a. I have kind of a big question to ask. Um, or like, a hard question, I guess.
00:45:15.496 - 00:45:16.256, Speaker A: Um.
00:45:16.408 - 00:45:16.880, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:45:16.920 - 00:46:02.970, Speaker A: I. Based off of, like, what I know about you and figment and like, the things I see you talking about, um, I would describe you and like, your organization as people who, builders who are trying to improve block space, basically trying to make it more scalable, composable, antifragile, just trying to perfect it, really. But obviously, the use cases for that block space or the demand for it is still kind of weird. Like, let's say. Let's say we have it like, nailed down tomorrow, right? Like, let's say somehow everything just ships. Everything that is supposed to happen over the next 50 years, just ships in terms of infrastructure. And we're there.
00:46:02.970 - 00:46:06.660, Speaker A: What now? Like, what do we use this block space for?
00:46:09.120 - 00:46:42.070, Speaker B: It's a great question. Also, the way you just, you described us was fantastic. I'm have to use that for, like, I have to pitch myself because I was like, succinctly and just well put. Okay, so, I mean, I'm biased here because, like, I think a lot about, like, economics and finance, and that's what brought me into crypto. It's what kind of, like, my thinking space evolves around. Like, I do think blockchain's, like, core value prop is like, enabling fast exchange between humans. And a lot of that naturally does lead to financial kind of purposes for that application.
00:46:42.070 - 00:47:38.036, Speaker B: I think the fact that, like, if either of you guys are in, I don't know, Thailand and I'm here, I can send you money or transact with you instantly at a very low cost. And obviously, I think you need to make the user experience better, but I can pretty safely know that it's you without having to, like, go through these weird kind of, like, backdoor ways to do that. And so I think, like, what we've seen crypto do extremely well. It's a very high velocity economy, and media, like, value exchange arena, you can call it. And, like, that's why we see these, like, extremely volatile periods, because things happen quicker on chain than anywhere else. And, like, when you kind of unpack that, I do think there's real financial, long lasting use cases that can exist. Again, whether it's cross border payments, whether it's like, people who need loans and want to access, like, a, you know, stable, coin driven loan, and they have to worry about this currency risk and all these things, and you can get immediate liquidity.
00:47:38.036 - 00:48:16.392, Speaker B: You don't have to worry about, you know, driving all the way to a bank that may or may not be open to actually get your money back or pay with, you know, whatever. And so all of those things got me into the space. I still believe, like, they have legitimate legs to them. But, you know, again, going on, like, kind of the medium, medium of exchange thesis, like, I do think games are interesting thing as well, because, like, games are very isolated right now by nature. And, like, if you think of a world where games are composable and users of one game were able to interact with user another game, like, it is interesting, again, like, limitations need to exist. I don't think a user playing a civil war game wants to all of a sudden be, like, in Halo world. That would make no sense.
00:48:16.392 - 00:48:49.946, Speaker B: But the design space becomes very interesting. And so I do think understanding the benefits of blockchain, fixing some of the rugged edges right now and then applying that, we have a lot of the use cases just a matter of reaching a scale where it makes sense for more people to interact, because compliance is one thing that does not exist. If you want rwas to happen at scale, things need to change along those lines. User experience is a major inhibitor. Most people's first interaction on chain is a very bad one. You either pay $100 on ethereum, or you set it to the wrong address. You lose your money, you do something you can't recover.
00:48:49.946 - 00:49:12.020, Speaker B: And so we need to build, like, kind of guardrails around that, or at least, like, have environments that are safe, environments that are just, like free for all and understand the differences between them. So I think it comes down to, like, education, smoothing out the ux, and just, like, fixing some of these issues that haven't been addressed yet. But the applications, in my opinion, actually aren't bad. They just aren't as good.
00:49:12.060 - 00:49:12.660, Speaker A: That's a hot take.
00:49:12.700 - 00:49:13.572, Speaker B: So we have a ways to go.
00:49:13.636 - 00:49:15.640, Speaker A: I feel like most people wouldn't agree with that.
00:49:17.500 - 00:49:57.098, Speaker B: I think everyone, you know, I love using blockchain, so maybe I'm biased again here where, like, for me, Defi is like, I mean, obviously it is like investing, so people shouldn't treat it like this, but it is fun. Like, I do, like, love using it and, like, talking to my friends in my group, chats about these different things. Like, the act of being a DeFi participant to me is very engaging. And I think, like, that's a demonstration of a good application. Like, for a lot of people, Instagram is a lot of fun. And so, like, if you enjoy the applications you're engaging with, mind you, like, we all are very niche. Like, we don't represent the greater population by any means, but I do think if you make things more accessible and easier to use, more people would find the same thing.
00:49:57.098 - 00:50:22.080, Speaker B: And not everyone wants to be trading, you know, shit coins. But if you can, you know, take out a loan from your computer that is not controlled by, you know, people, you don't want it to be controlled by, then. Like, that's a huge unlock. So I don't know, maybe I'm one of the few to believe crypto is in a pretty healthy state as a matter of reaching scale. But there are. There are definitely other applications that I'd love to see exist that aren't just, like, entirely financially rooted.
00:50:22.940 - 00:50:50.586, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good point, actually. It's. It's interesting to think about, like, how things would be different if I. We were scalable and regulated and usable to an extent. The UX is just, like, still killer in a lot of different ways. I remember, like, not long ago, CeDaw was, like, off boarding to some exchange from arbitrum and he accidentally sent USDC. Like, what was it? Like, bridged USDC instead of regular USDC.
00:50:50.586 - 00:51:00.052, Speaker A: And it was like a week or two after they did the migration. Like, that is just so dumb, dude. That's like, such an unnecessary problem.
00:51:00.156 - 00:51:02.876, Speaker C: I had to wait close to like.
00:51:02.908 - 00:51:08.320, Speaker A: A month and a half, and that's one, like, issue. Like, that's so specific, dude.
00:51:10.300 - 00:51:37.370, Speaker B: I mean, if we're being very honest here, I got scammed like, two weeks ago. I was, again, this is where I should be smarter about when I use blockchain. But I was, like, at an airport and I, my flight was about to, like, take off and I thought an airdrop had just been announced and I lost all of my tokens that would have qualified me for the airdrop. Again, it's survivable. It wasn't. It is what it is. It's an expensive lesson to learn, but, like, that shit just can't happen.
00:51:37.370 - 00:52:00.292, Speaker B: Like, I, again, we've all been using crypto for a long time and, like, cedo sending thing the wrong token format to an exchange and, like, takes two weeks to get it back. I sent my money to God knows who and we're still making these mistakes. Like, for the average person who, like, either doesn't have, like, the financial base or just lacks the experience, like, you make that mistake once and you're done forever. Like, you're never coming back. And, like, we need to fix that.
00:52:00.396 - 00:52:44.640, Speaker A: You definitely. I think we've all, like, got the hair on our chest at this point to, like, make mistakes like that and, like, learn from it. But, like, you know, most, most newcomers making something, even half the severity of either of those things are going to be turned off, like, from day one. Pretty much like that kind of stuff just. Exactly, just can't happen. Um, shifting back towards, like, uh, figment capital or a little bit or I guess not figment capital specifically, but you, your time as an investor. Um, what are some deals you guys have done that you can talk about obviously in the past, like year or so that you're excited for? And what are some that you've seen that you have not been able to get on but you wish you could have.
00:52:44.640 - 00:52:47.980, Speaker A: Either you, you know, you missed it or for whatever reason you didn't make it on.
00:52:49.050 - 00:52:52.666, Speaker B: So this is where I have to do the disclaimer that none of this is financial advice.
00:52:52.738 - 00:52:55.226, Speaker A: The whole episode. That applies for the whole episode.
00:52:55.418 - 00:53:23.102, Speaker B: Yeah, it goes without saying, but this part especially. Or else my CFO will come through this door and tackle me very quickly. So, yeah, I guess, like, publicly, we invested recently in Renzo, which I think is extremely exciting. So Eigen layer. We're a seed investor in Eigen layer. So obviously our fund and myself included, has very high hopes for that ecosystem and what it's going to evolve to be. But I do think LRT's really have to exist.
00:53:23.102 - 00:53:52.028, Speaker B: Like, on one note, like, people want LST's because they want liquidity for staked assets. It's only natural that you want that and you can use it in DeFi. Exactly. Same goes for eigen layer. But uniquely, what Renzo offers, which lsts don't, is access to an index, basically, of different avss. So LST's for Ethereum, for example, stake Deeth is just Ethan. But for Renzo versus Etherfi and other LRTs, they could be entirely different compositions.
00:53:52.028 - 00:54:12.732, Speaker B: And so now it's almost. I can't say this on a podcast, I'll just say it. It's kind of like an ETF where like, you know, you're able to access, like, all sorts of different, you know, weights and balances of different positions. And like, you're like, oh, I like this one. Like, this has these avss that I want to have exposure to. So I'll buy this one. Like, oh, that one doesn't have that.
00:54:12.732 - 00:54:51.190, Speaker B: So I'll avoid that one. So I think from a user standpoint, that's super interesting. The last thing that's also really interesting, and I've been able to uniquely observe this, is validators have an issue where they're not really able to select avss they want to support, because by doing that, you're making decisions on behalf of your stakers, which makes you more like an asset manager rather than actual technology provider. And so what LRT's do is basically they work with different operators to inform them. Okay, our governance decided that we're going to support these avss. So you guys go out and do this and everyone's happy. So it's a way to kind of circumvent that potential compliance issue that otherwise Eigen layer spawns.
00:54:51.190 - 00:55:10.512, Speaker B: So, yeah, love Renzo. They've been crushing it. Also, lots of respect for ether five kelp. I know both those teams and think they're great, so nothing against them. Another investment, I would say this is going back to Cosmos, so it's relevant to we. I don't know if it's not announced.
00:55:10.576 - 00:55:13.296, Speaker A: Yet, if you don't have to. You don't.
00:55:13.368 - 00:55:14.460, Speaker B: We're not, we're not.
00:55:14.760 - 00:55:16.456, Speaker A: Do whatever you feel comfortable doing.
00:55:16.568 - 00:55:47.250, Speaker B: No, no, it's good. Yeah, I'll skip that one. But things that I missed to go to that I think, barachain, I kick myself over every single day. Those guys are incredible. Like incredibly, incredibly smart people. Unfortunately, I didn't speak to them until their round about a year ago where the market was just not in a good spot and they were raising at a valuation that was now looks really good. And so unfortunately just never pulled the trigger on that one.
00:55:47.250 - 00:56:11.020, Speaker B: But absolutely love those guys. I'm already trying to use barachain. I sadly have not been able to get my tokens from the faucet yet, but hopefully one day I will. And then I just love those guys and what they do and everything they stand for. Yeah. Besides that, I think the AI space is really interesting. And this is more of like a stance of our fund where it's like, we do have interest in it.
00:56:11.020 - 00:56:38.700, Speaker B: We have dipped our toe into AI, but we try to stick to what our expertise is. And as someone who has a brain beyond crypto, I think AI is obviously a massive, massive space that's going to change the world. And it makes sense how it can be applied on chains. There's things that have to exist, I think, that only blockchain can offer for AI to be safe. I think one example is, a small example is like, verifying the validity of something. You know, I'm a big Drake fan. I've been listening to Drake since I was like, I don't know, ten years old.
00:56:38.700 - 00:57:11.310, Speaker B: And I heard it AI generated Drake song a year ago, and I thought it was a new Drake song. I didn't see the title, and I was like, oh, this song is amazing. When did Drake put this out? And then I saw the title was AI generated, and I'm like, oh, my God, like, I'm gonna fall for this shit all the time. Time. And so with blockchain, you can actually verify that this is an original work. It was published at this time, and anything derivative, you can easily point to that and prove that it's a derivative, like work of something. And so applying that to a much larger scale, I think crypto and AI have a very interesting intersection that.
00:57:11.310 - 00:57:20.482, Speaker B: Not yet, I don't think we fully embraced as a fund, but definitely as a person who researches and is interested in the space more broadly. I think it's a really exciting thing.
00:57:20.626 - 00:58:01.270, Speaker A: Yeah. AI is definitely a big one that I also wish I caught on to a little bit earlier. We're coming up on time. I wish we had more time to talk about Eigen Lair because I definitely had a lot of questions about that, but I wanted to cover the cosmos stuff above all else. I guess one, maybe this is a far fetched question, but I don't remember who, but I saw a take on Twitter not long ago of someone saying that Eigen Lair is the biggest innovation to blockchain since smart contracts. Is there any part of you that agrees with that, I think Eigen layer.
00:58:01.310 - 00:58:50.030, Speaker B: Can forever change Ethereum. I do see a world where Ethereum, whether it's through roll ups, Eigen layer or both, is basically just security chain, where not a lot of stuff actually happens on the l one itself, but roll ups and chains using Eigen layer tap into its security offering, and that gets around some of the scaling issues that Ethereum has and is consistently faced. And so if you are someone who believes that the future is very ethereum centric or involves Ethereum, then Eigen layer plays an important role in that, in my opinion. Without a doubt. I think what's important is taking a safe and controlled approach to this, because if you just open the floodgates and let people do whatever they want, there is a world where you can see some risks. I'm personally a believer in taking risks. So I love that Eigen layer is existing, and I think it's going to be a very good outcome for Ethereum.
00:58:50.030 - 00:59:28.994, Speaker B: I think inevitably the hiccups in the road for everything, but the long term view for me is a very good one. I think it's a new concept, but it's not completely net new in terms of the most unique and powerful thing to happen on chains and smart contracts. I don't know if I quite buy into that because shared security has existed. I mean, Polkadot has been doing it for a while, Cosmos has been doing it, others have been doing it. Eigen layer is kind of like a new take on shared security and applying it to Ethereum. And so is it amazing and like going to change Ethereum? Absolutely. But do I think it's like the most net new innovation to ever take place? Not necessarily, but it doesn't have to be.
00:59:28.994 - 00:59:32.850, Speaker B: I don't think there's no reason to reinvent the wheel if like the wheels already existing.
00:59:33.510 - 00:59:42.550, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I guess I never thought about bootstrap security kind of existing already, but I think just not the scale. Not at the scale.
00:59:42.630 - 00:59:46.502, Speaker B: Polkadot never reached the scale. And ICS is also far away from.
00:59:46.526 - 01:00:06.520, Speaker A: This scale, and certainly not leveraging something as robust as Ethereum security either. I mean, not to like rag on Polkadot or Cosmos, but it's a definitely like a different game at that point. Yeah, we certainly, we got a wrap up here, unfortunately. Do you have anything else? I know you have a hard stop here, so.
01:00:09.780 - 01:00:11.828, Speaker C: No, I'm good. This was awesome, man.
01:00:11.884 - 01:00:21.412, Speaker B: I really appreciate having me guys. I hope I didn't get too far in the weeds to a point where it's confusing, but really appreciate you guys. Having me. It was great to chat, and hopefully I can come back again at some point.
01:00:21.436 - 01:00:32.656, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. We'll try and find some time. Maybe when we have some other interesting developments. I mean, I'm sure we could have you on again and have no shortage of things to talk about, but definitely.
01:00:32.688 - 01:00:37.940, Speaker B: We'Ll have plenty of other people as well, so. I get it. The time comes, it comes. But until then, no worries.
01:00:39.440 - 01:00:44.420, Speaker A: We'll make it happen, man. For sure. I appreciate you, though, man. This was great. Thanks again.
01:00:45.320 - 01:00:46.320, Speaker B: Yeah, likewise, guys.
