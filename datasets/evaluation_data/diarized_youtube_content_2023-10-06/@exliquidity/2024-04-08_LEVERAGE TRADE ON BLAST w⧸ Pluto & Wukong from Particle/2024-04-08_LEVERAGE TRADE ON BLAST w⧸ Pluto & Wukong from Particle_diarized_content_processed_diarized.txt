00:00:00.200 - 00:00:14.770, Speaker A: All right. Episode 60 or 59? Episode 59 Exit Liquidity. We got on Pluto and Wukong from particle. How you guys doing?
00:00:15.430 - 00:00:17.970, Speaker B: We are doing well. Thank you for having us.
00:00:18.750 - 00:00:21.090, Speaker C: Yeah, doing well. Thanks for having us, guys.
00:00:22.750 - 00:00:33.870, Speaker A: Cool. We'll, we'll jump straight in. Can you jump into a little bit about each of yourselves? Kind of intro on your background into the ecosystem?
00:00:34.330 - 00:01:07.726, Speaker B: Of course, yeah. My background is in engineering, went to MIT before in computer science. Going to crypto around 2021. Started with joining some company, starting a few companies, and then landed on Defi eventually. Just love how things are quickly scaling up. Good ideas can just grow very quickly in the Defi landscape. Yeah.
00:01:07.726 - 00:01:18.010, Speaker B: And going to blas ecosystem October, November last year. Very excited. Building in the ecosystem.
00:01:20.080 - 00:02:07.510, Speaker C: Yeah. So my previous experience is in the gaming and virtual goods space. I've been following crypto since I think pretty early 2012, but I really got into it around 2019 when I used it to start trading virtual currencies specifically for games. And then I built some startups in the space and then I became the growth lead at this Y combinator backed company called RCtai, as well as the subsidiary delysium, which was pretty big in Korea. And, you know, I led it to this token listing at roughly a $1 billion fully diluted valuation. I left and then I joined particle after that.
00:02:09.930 - 00:02:26.800, Speaker D: Nice. Great stuff. Yeah, I think the gaming to crypto conversion is a pretty compelling one. I mean, that's like what prompted Vitalik to go and create ethereum, I think. And that's a lot of people on board that way, interestingly enough.
00:02:27.460 - 00:03:20.680, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. The amount of people who are onboarded by runescape is either, most people either tell you, but some of them don't admit it. But a lot of us found out about crypto early in 2012, 2013 during that period of time, but also during these, I guess, like big ico wave. And after that, a lot of the skill sets that you learn as part of the ecosystem there, you'll find that the transition from virtual currency to, I guess, like cryptocurrencies is a really, really natural transition. And a lot of the elements of it, like for example, just a peer to peer market, for example, are aspects that are really, really, I guess, transferable and convertible.
00:03:22.300 - 00:03:48.570, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. You guys were asking us before we went live here about the name exit liquidity. One of the reasons we are called exit liquidity is we can't start an episode until we hear both of your favorite exit liquidity stories of your, your favorite time being exit liquidity in this industry. So Wukong, you want to, you want to go first?
00:03:50.870 - 00:04:33.480, Speaker B: You mean like the best as it. I know from the, from the industry. I mean I so I came from a mostly web two background. I tend to believe in a decent asset meaning investors are making a good return. Almost all the users, at least the early users got there. It's not rugged to be very honest with you. I think Blur did a pretty good job over their two seasons of airdrops and right now it's their third season.
00:04:33.480 - 00:05:36.230, Speaker B: If we look at their token launch events, obviously their investors are making pretty good return. Even the first airdrop and then until the token unlock for the insiders that's a pretty good return. And most importantly for their, let alone like the big users, the big farmers, they got pretty good return. But like me as like I'm not like a huge farmer on blur before the little money and time I put in there, it's good return at least for the early users. I think they did a pretty good job over there and that kind of I think goal is what we are trying to hit with our plan. Yeah, that's my current observation. Just being decent for your investors, for your early users, for your ongoing users.
00:05:37.330 - 00:06:10.022, Speaker D: That's my take, yeah, for sure. I guess just to provide a little bit of context on that question, I think I may have mis explained that one. We're looking for your a time when you were exit liquidity in the industry. So like for example, mine was or my biggest one was probably Luna I bought on the way up and I held it all the way down to zero. So your story of being someone else's ex liquidity.
00:06:10.206 - 00:06:33.010, Speaker B: Oh, I see, I see, I see. Probably our gobblers. I bought one. I like tennis. And then I hold until now I still redeem the. What's that called? The Gu token every now and then. I still haven't like made it back for my initial investment, but based upon time.
00:06:35.470 - 00:06:39.290, Speaker D: Yeah, that was definitely an entertaining one. An interesting one for sure.
00:06:39.670 - 00:06:40.318, Speaker B: I thought.
00:06:40.414 - 00:06:41.414, Speaker D: What about you?
00:06:41.582 - 00:07:11.260, Speaker B: I thought that. Sorry, I thought the tokenomics was like. Was a killer. It's. It's like the, it has some duality about the token NFT interplay similar to the ERC 404 thing recently, but maybe it's too complicated. People didn't get it and it's just infinitely diluting. So the price didn't hold up for long, but yeah, it was still.
00:07:11.880 - 00:07:24.680, Speaker D: Yeah, ahead of its time maybe. That was definitely. It was an experiment for sure. But I don't want to call on you too much. I know you're not. You're under the weather. But if you got your ex liquidity story, we'd love to hear it.
00:07:24.980 - 00:08:05.390, Speaker C: Yeah, for context, caught something at Denver and, you know, Denver has hands. So, yeah, in terms of exit liquidity, I think in my case it was investing in like the Agix like, singularity net ecosystem. So like, they spin out like, projects, right, which are really their team members and then their own little projects as kind of like. And then they ido it. And in one particular, there's this thing called Cogito protocol, which is kind of doing something like Athena, except I guess, like more directly just doing like a tokenized fund with AI on chain. So I thought it was a good idea.
00:08:05.730 - 00:08:06.114, Speaker A: Put.
00:08:06.162 - 00:08:47.266, Speaker C: Put, you know, a significant amount of money in there thinking that, okay, I won't get rugged because, you know, singularity net is like behind this. Right. But what I didn't realize was that, like, singularity net has not done anything in a long time. And so, you know, that culture apparently has passed on to their. Their sort of side projects, or at least not to say they haven't delivered, but they just move like extremely, extremely slow, like Cardano. So, yeah, that project, it's been almost a year. It's trading at like 30, 40% discount and that the fund or anything still hasn't been set up.
00:08:47.266 - 00:08:50.310, Speaker C: So I am definitely exit liquidity there.
00:08:52.290 - 00:08:54.458, Speaker D: Yeah, those are interesting one.
00:08:54.634 - 00:08:57.682, Speaker A: I haven't heard of that one. Sounds interesting.
00:08:57.746 - 00:09:10.882, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was safe. Right. Because, you know, the biggest issue for anything is that you don't want to get rugged first. So I was like, okay, I'm not going to get rugged here. Right. But then I failed to. And also I thought the idea was interesting.
00:09:10.882 - 00:09:47.366, Speaker C: I just failed to account for the fact that, like. And which is really important. Right. Which is that sometimes teams don't really have the motivation. Or it's like with big companies, when they spin off their own teams, you'll see a lot of the culture, a lot of the characteristics pass on. And it's very. It's very rare that you'll see like an offshoot of a large company or a spin off get extremely successful or surpass the success of their, I guess, original sort of company just because of the.
00:09:47.366 - 00:10:18.626, Speaker C: I guess the main thing is just the team, but also the management probably maintains a certain degree of control. But in either way, I'm pretty bad at sickle equity there. And, you know, my thesis was I wasn't going to get rugged. It's pretty smart and, you know, they should be able to deliver it. Right. So, yeah, but I mean, like, the other thing is my Zuki is down, I think, like, 40, 50%. But, you know, I'm, I bought it for the art is what I tell myself these days.
00:10:18.626 - 00:10:24.218, Speaker C: And, yeah, that's pretty great art. So I'm cool holding it to zero or to infinity.
00:10:24.274 - 00:10:58.120, Speaker A: So. So, yeah, I think not. Impossible to get rugged is a solid one. I think we've all felt that with certain projects, great backgrounds from both of you guys, we're getting into the kind of start of blast. It's been a few days. When did you guys first decide to launch on blast, and why? Were there any other chains that were, like, front runners that could have been the place where you guys resided? Or was it blast from the, from the jump?
00:10:59.820 - 00:11:29.530, Speaker B: So we talked to the blast team, Pac man and the team November last year, and after the call, we just decided right on blast is the choice. It's very obvious. It's, there's a lot of liquidity flowing around. There's a lot of users, a lot of attention. It's a very good go to market strategy. At the time, all other choices were established. L two, optimism, arbitrage, basically.
00:11:29.530 - 00:12:34.380, Speaker B: But the thing we look up mostly for outside of go to market strategy and users is the ability to work with the chain itself closely. So, yeah, we have the fortune to, to work with the blast team closely on the technical front, on the product front, on the incentive front. Yeah, I think that gives us a lot of good feedback for how to build our product better. And also on blas, it's apparent early on that a lot of the creative and committed teams are there. Like, for example, we got to know thruster on December last year, and it was really efficient. We explained our ideas, they explained their plan on building thrust on blast. And it's just after one call or two, it's immediately clear that we should get along together.
00:12:34.380 - 00:13:00.090, Speaker B: And, yeah, examples like this, it's a positive feedback loop on the entire blast ecosystem. I would say. It's easy to collaborate with others. It's easy to talk to. I mean, blast team is being overwhelmed all the time, but they remain like an open attitude to the projects. So, yeah, overall, it's a very good experience, and it's a good ecosystem to attract users.
00:13:01.790 - 00:13:41.960, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I mean, all the different mechanics aside, it definitely, from the outside, it seems like they have a really strong, like, just feedback process advisors, they seem to be very involved with the teams. They, uh, the teams that have decided to build there, they've I think they've probably had one of like the most complete ecosystems pre launch that we've seen in a while. Um, you mentioned thruster. Are there other like, teams in that ecosystem that you people either who you think are going to do really well or you're already partnered with? Just anything else you're excited for in that ecosystem? Outside particle, of course.
00:13:42.620 - 00:14:15.780, Speaker B: Right. So we are collaborating with quite a few teams there. For example, Guice, meta street pack finance, orbit, lending protocol. A lot of the teams there are very strong, very committed. Looking at the maybe like DeFi Llama leaderboards, I mean, DeFi Llama is focusing on TVO and trading volume. Yeah. A lot of the teams up there, I mean, I'm pretty sure they are doing really well.
00:14:15.780 - 00:14:24.620, Speaker B: We are not very far ahead on the leaderboard. Those are our target to learn from and to catch up.
00:14:25.690 - 00:15:22.746, Speaker C: Yeah, I think to tan on to that, there's one project that we're working with that hasn't fully launched yet, but I think they're ex Spartan and X Goldman called I think, agent five and they're looking into like, I guess, releasing nfts with like an existing trading strategy and letting the sort of AI agent execute on that. I thought that was just really, really cool. So I'm pretty bullish on that. But everyone in blast is generally very, very capable. So like, even the meme coins when it comes to, I guess, like Pacman or another, some of the other meme coins, they're very, very good at what they do. So I think the blast ecosystem has been a lesson and a journey. It's just been such a pleasure, but also extremely tiring to be a part of.
00:15:22.746 - 00:15:24.650, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:24.690 - 00:16:10.582, Speaker A: I think Pac Man's initial ideas and initial announcement, it definitely got some pushback. There were concerns, but I think it's been somewhat of like a master class in game theory and incentivizing not only users for their own liquidity, but also kind of talent and developers to harness that liquidity. So I think they did an awesome job and I'm excited to see all the projects that pop up, especially. That's why we have you on here today. Could you talk a little bit about particle and kind of describe from a high level what it is and what you guys want to accomplish?
00:16:10.776 - 00:16:54.320, Speaker B: Of course. Of course. So let me just explain how we got the idea and what's our specific solution to the, to the problem? So, so we look at. So we build in the bear market. Obviously we started in the bear market and then we now, we are now in the bull market. But when we observe the crypto market, financial market in general, we observe that across bull market, cross bear market leverage trading volume is always at least like ten times the spot market. This is universally true across traditional markets like Nasdaq Robinhood to crypto market, decentralized or centralized.
00:16:54.320 - 00:18:17.150, Speaker B: But on crypto, the current status quo for leverage trading is that someone has to permission it, right? If we look at all the tokens with over $1 million market cap, two thirds of them are not leveraged, tradable anywhere. It's not on binance, it's not on Dydx, it's not on GMX. But if we think about it, those tokens, those two thirds of tokens, they exactly are the tokens that need efficient price discovery. The price moves a lot, and if you add leverage to it, price can converge faster in their price discovery mode. And if we talk about technical norms, the reason that leverage trading is not feasible for those not like the blue chip, blue chip tokens is that one big reason is there's no like robust price oracle for those, for those tokens. And leverage trading in the traditional sense requires a very precise price oracle. Otherwise there's this like risk in either the lp side or on the trader side.
00:18:17.150 - 00:19:22.490, Speaker B: So, and doing particle, we're trying to think about this whole like clearly there's a market to build a leverage trading platform for any asset. And then we start from thinking the basic mechanism, how can we enable this for any assets, just permissionlessly? And we are a big fan of uniswap. On Uniswap is like any token can be tradable as long as there's liquidity. There's no dependency on price Oracle or anything. I mean, you can think of it as they are like the base market, everything trade there. So you don't need the price oracle, but the design over there, like the EMM design, eliminating the price oracle, that's something we start with. So particle is the goal for particle is really reaching the same level of permissionless as uniswap to enable leverage trading for any token.
00:19:22.490 - 00:20:52.170, Speaker B: The way we do this is basically margin trading. And that's why blast was putting us in the lending category in their blast winner list is that, I mean, if we think of a particle, the underlying mechanism is margin trading. You borrow asset and then you can trade with a larger exposure, that's leverage. And the borrowing on protocol is that we borrow from the Amm liquidity pool and there's a set of mathematical model there using ammdhenna liquidity math to make sure that the LP is always kind of like solvent, meaning that from. From protocols, protocol, or the underlying AMm, the LP can always withdraw the same amount of token. So in the AMM terminology, the LP doesn't feel a higher impairment loss base, basically. So over here it's like, yeah, we're going into a little deep here, but the LP is always kind of earning more because the liquidity is used for both spot trading and leverage trading, and they are suffering less, no higher imperial loss compared to the underlying amn.
00:20:54.550 - 00:21:15.468, Speaker D: Gotcha. Okay. Um, yeah, definitely a lot to unpack there on. On the product side. Um, can you. So, as far as I understand, um, lp's are able to earn more and they're not exposed to impermanent loss when using particle or when lp'ing on particle. Um, are you guys.
00:21:15.468 - 00:21:28.880, Speaker D: Is this your own amm that's backing this trading or are you using some, you know, like, in the way that other products will use Univ three for similar stuff? Like, this is the Amm yours? Are you getting it from elsewhere?
00:21:29.040 - 00:21:39.220, Speaker B: We're getting it from elsewhere. We built on top of uniswap V three standard. And on blast, our underlying amm is thruster.
00:21:41.040 - 00:22:03.114, Speaker D: Okay. And do you. So how does that. How are lp's not. Because impermanent loss is obviously, like a big consideration when LP ing on a place like uniswap or any. Mm. Really? Can you explain how that works, how they're not subject to that on particle?
00:22:03.242 - 00:22:31.536, Speaker B: Right. Right. So we do have impermanent loss. It's just the impermanent loss is no higher than the underlying amms impermanent loss. So the flow of liquidity is the following. So when an LP comes through protocol, their liquidity is by default used by thruster. So if there's no leverage trading, even zero leverage trading happening, their liquidity is still being used for spot swapping.
00:22:31.536 - 00:23:05.490, Speaker B: Right. So it's still generating a considerable amount of yield. And on blast, they are getting thruster reward. Blast reward, all by default. And blast yield, obviously. And when their liquidity is being borrowed, because we connect to thrusters contract, we use all the parameter from uniswap three standard. So their liquidity, their borrowed liquidity will be earning same monthly yield while suffering no higher impairment loss.
00:23:05.490 - 00:24:16.400, Speaker B: Because we use all the liquidity math from the underlying contract. And in doing so, basically one unit of liquidity is getting higher amount of yield in the traditional sense for liquidity provision. And on blast, one unit of liquidity supplying to protocol will earn multiple folds of reward. You will earn blast reward, you will earn thruster reward, you will earn particle reward. So what we want to demonstrate here is the liquidity efficiency. Deploying on particle is considerably higher than just sitting in the liquidity idle or just plainly deploying the liquidity on simple emm. Yeah, so I think just to expand this here a little bit, our goal with this protocol, unlike just long term protocol standpoint, is to increase the liquidity efficiency for LP's and traders obviously will have the option to do leverage trading.
00:24:16.400 - 00:24:24.380, Speaker B: And on blast, we want to optimize for per unit liquidity reward on multiple fronts.
00:24:27.600 - 00:25:24.896, Speaker D: Okay, gotcha. Yeah, I think, I think when you really start to break down the rewards available on particle and on blast in general, it can definitely make like head spin a little bit. I do want to talk about that a little bit later, but I want to allude back to before we, before we started the live stream, we were talking a little bit about meme coins and just like tail assets in general, trading stuff outside of the usual bitcoin, ethereum, whatever else, like big cap assets. And I know that one of the advantages of particle is that we can start to offer those assets with leverage. What does that look like in practice? Let's say I were to go and launch a token tomorrow, and I want to get it on particle one day to trade with leverage. How would that process happen? Would I have to have a certain amount of volume, a certain amount of liquidity? What's the prerequisites to get something tradable on there?
00:25:25.038 - 00:26:01.646, Speaker B: Yes, yes. So the step, like the actionable step, is very straightforward. So you have a new token, you have a new pool. You first open that pool thruster, because we need to have unity three pool that exists. And then you put some liquidity into that pool. And on protocol you can transfer that liquidity position to particles contract. And on unib three, transferring liquidity positions, basically transferring the position NFT right, on political contract.
00:26:01.646 - 00:27:06.968, Speaker B: And that will just be enough to trade with leverage for that token pair. And in fact, there are people doing that already, we don't even know what token that is. And people just supply into protocol and permissionlessly, our front end will just pick up the available liquidity for different pairs. Yeah, and you brought up a very good point about amount of liquidity that's needed, because the underlying mechanism is margin trading. The total amount of borrowable liquidity will be bounded by amount of liquidity supplied on protocol. So let's say you're putting a like one hundred k of liquidity into this pool, and then supply the protocol, the maximum amount of liquidity that can be borrowed will be that 100k. So if someone is doing like a ten k long exposure with ten x leverage, yeah, that will be the only position that can be opened with that liquidity provision.
00:27:06.968 - 00:27:21.540, Speaker B: So yeah, similar to all other DeFi protocol, we want to attract as much liquidity as possible to enable more leverage trading, enable more positions to be opened for that pool.
00:27:24.120 - 00:27:40.300, Speaker A: What's the process for increasing that leverage? Will users on particle just hop into particle and just lp in those specific places? Or will just a majority of USDC be distributed to wherever it's needed?
00:27:41.470 - 00:28:23.340, Speaker B: Right. So this depends on the users, I would say. We want to make the platform kind of permissionless, like uniswap. So as long as this liquidity available, leverage can happen. But obviously in the beginning, we want to use whatever incentive we have to, to guide the market towards certain pairs. Those pairs include bluetooth pairs, like East USDB. Whatever reward we get from blast from thruster, we'll be diverting a lot of them to those pools.
00:28:23.340 - 00:28:52.560, Speaker B: Those pools include ecUsDB, traditional pairs, and some partnership pools like token projects or other projects that launch their token. If we collaborate with them, we'll divert some incentive there. And with the incentive, people will divert more liquidity into those pools and more like TvO, higher, higher availability for leverage trading and so on.
00:28:55.220 - 00:29:19.390, Speaker D: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I want to, I want to take a step back real quick and like try and make some comparisons just to help me understand a little bit more. Right. As far as I understand, this is a similar approach to what people like. Infinity pools, panoptic, limitless, good entry. Those guys are kind of doing. Is that a correct assumption?
00:29:20.290 - 00:29:37.024, Speaker B: Yeah, we can compare with, I think it's fair to compare with all those protocols. Um, it's all permissionless and it has some, um, it has ability to do leverage trading for all those either like option or other margin trading protocol. Yeah, gotcha.
00:29:37.112 - 00:30:04.922, Speaker D: Okay, so um, my question like with regards to that is each, uh, each of those kind of have like a bit of like a niche, right? Like canoptic presents them as options or like perpetual options, right? Infinity pools is all about like, you know, 1000 x leverage or whatever, without, without liquidations, right? What would you say sets particle apart in that crowd? What's your kind of like niche there?
00:30:05.106 - 00:31:09.924, Speaker B: Right? So panonic is option. So this by category is pretty different. I think options are more for professional users who understand Blackshore and they know what they are doing to make a big fortune out of there. I think the closest comparison is indeed infinity pools. I think on the technical level, the main difference is that they build their own amm and we build on top of existing emms and there's pros and cons in the decisions that we make. But yeah, the designs, the goal is very similar. We all trade, we want to enable leverage trading for different assets and yeah, they want to emphasize on infinite amount of leverage, we emphasize on permissionless on different assets.
00:31:09.924 - 00:31:51.822, Speaker B: Um, yeah, um, and, and the difference in amm choice. Um, so, so for us, I, we just feel like um, it's a, it's an, it's an aligned goal with different, um, with different parties at play. Like basically on protocol there are four parties. Um, there's underlying amm, there's token project, there's traders, and there's LP. We feel like working with the underlying Amm can align to all four parties together. You know, so if we work with underlying AMM, higher trading volume means both higher trading volume on particle and higher trading volume on the underlying amm. So we are not competing.
00:31:51.822 - 00:32:21.712, Speaker B: So that's why we will have like a very collaborative experience with, with thruster since day one. Right. And because the actual trading happens on the underlying amm, all the swap happens there. The trading volume is the actual trading volume for token projects. So coming to LP enables leverage. Trading enables higher trading volume for the token project. That's higher visibility for token projects traders.
00:32:21.712 - 00:32:47.586, Speaker B: Obviously they will have more options to long and short for LP's. The LP into particle is basically LP into two projects. Into both roster and particle. They earn multiple rewards. Um, and, and higher trading volume means higher swapping fee. Um, and, and protocol allows them to um, have like the, like borrow, like lending liquidity. Like the liquidity can be used for like lending.
00:32:47.586 - 00:32:53.710, Speaker B: So it's like two folds of, of liquidity efficiency, um, in doing, doing this kind of design.
00:32:56.770 - 00:33:46.340, Speaker D: Gotcha. Yeah, um, definitely a lot of different like stakeholders with this model, which I always find interesting. Definitely going to be interesting to watch it scale and see how those different incentives and those different costs and benefits play out. You alluded to this earlier. I wanted to ask you guys about how you're planning on using blast incentives, but now I'm realizing it will be particle plus thruster plus blast incentives, which just like, you know, makes the question that much more complicated. Just like broadly. I'm curious as to, I mean, you talked about the different stakeholders and, and kind of what their priorities might be with all the different incentive sources that you would have from a design like this.
00:33:46.340 - 00:33:55.626, Speaker D: How are you guys thinking about that system, what kind of activity are you most looking to incentivize or what's like highest priority for you there, right?
00:33:55.698 - 00:34:43.421, Speaker B: Most mostly will be liquidity provision, but I just want to touch on blast incentive a little bit. So blast has two sets of incentive, right? Incentives. So one is blast liquidity point, the other one is blast gold. So blast liquidity point is like, I don't think there's much room to play with blast liquidity point. Blast liquidity point is like if the liquidity was in your wallet, you will earn blast points. Now you move the liquidity from your wallet into some dapps. From blast point of view, the liquidity is now in the Dapp's contract.
00:34:43.421 - 00:35:20.580, Speaker B: So blast will give those contracts some points. Now, this is kind of like a slight loss for the, for the users, right? Because previously with liquidity in their wallet, they will earn plus point, like continuously. Now it's the contract that earns the point. So plus liquidity points is basically for the contract to redirect the points they earn back to the users, right? So let's say I put in one eth to protocol. Protocol should count that one is as my point, right. My liquidity point. So that's like one to one mapping.
00:35:20.580 - 00:35:48.802, Speaker B: Our goal with blast liquidity point is really to make sure fair accounting and like accurate accounting. So, yeah, and our protocol is a little more complicated. So it took us some time. This is because we have to work with roster first. So from, uh, blast point of view, all the liquidity is on thruster. Um, and thruster will, will need to redirect the .2 different projects.
00:35:48.802 - 00:36:22.550, Speaker B: That's on thruster. We being one of the projects, right. So from thruster point of view, particles are big lp, even though users come to protocol, to LP first, right. And then LP will go to go to thruster. So like the flow of blast liquidity point is blast will give the points to thruster, and thruster will give the point to particle, and particle will give it back to users. So this requires a three party play. And we share the same code base with thruster to make sure fair accounting on the blast liquidity point.
00:36:22.550 - 00:37:02.584, Speaker B: So over there, that's a long story to tell. Liquidity point, that has little room. Let's just do fair accounting. We need to make sure per dollar amount of spending on the liquidity, we have to fairly count it back to users, so there's little room to play. But I think what's important is the blast gold. So that incentive is interesting. So from blast's at least like public announcement, I think they divide the incentive into half.
00:37:02.584 - 00:38:08.436, Speaker B: Half of them is for liquidity provision, the other half is for all the Dapps. So it's now up to all the Dapps. The other half is they call it blast gold. So now it's up to all the Dapps to design incentive program to distribute the blast goal to attract users. And for us, our goal is really, we want to optimize for per dollar spent or per e spent, the amount of blast gold you will get from all the protocols you combine. So if someone is spending like $1 protocol, they will get blast gold from our protocol, from thruster, and from all the other protocols that collaborate with us. One example is really there's a giant LP, Bigwell depositing LP for a metastreet wrapped token.
00:38:08.436 - 00:39:11.596, Speaker B: So this example really shines for our permissionless design. We didn't know about this token before and clearly we cannot plan for this. But someone just putting, I think, $4.5 million worth of liquidity into that pool and I think if everything plays out, they will earn Metastreet plus particle plus thruster blast gold for all those projects combined. So out of that 4.5 million, we want to demonstrate that per dollar spent, the amount of blast gold they get is really substantial. Yeah, and what's interesting about blast gold, outside of this relatively short term incentive for the blast gold distribution, we just want to make sure that this incentive program aligns with the long term play for the, for the protocol.
00:39:11.596 - 00:39:57.890, Speaker B: So even if without, it's without like blast incentive, like doing this kind of like wrap token and then the liquidity provision, it's incentivizing like inherently, inherently doing so should give this LP some reward. Like large liquidity that facilitates, you know, like the trading for that, for that poets deep liquidity. So like the order, price impact and so on, and the fees will be, will be small. So, so doing so like it will attract more traders. And if you attract traders, the LP will naturally get incentivized. So we just wanna make sure long term, the blasco incentive aligns with the protocol. Like native incentive.
00:39:57.890 - 00:40:10.950, Speaker B: So it's like over the long term, like we use the blas goal as like the, like a guide to structure the user behavior. And over long term, this role, like persist, hopefully.
00:40:11.850 - 00:41:01.440, Speaker D: Gotcha. Yeah, yeah, that's really interesting. I think an important distinction you made there, which not many users I think are aware of, or at least I'm not hearing that much about it, is that blast points and blast gold are two different things. Blast points are distributed based on liquidity and blast gold is, it's still uncertain. It's subjective really, how it'll be distributed. But what they, they've given some ideas and one thing they've made clear is that they will reward projects who, who utilize like blast native features creatively. So people who do an interesting job of redirecting the gas revenue or the, or the points or the gold or any of that stuff in an interesting way.
00:41:01.440 - 00:41:11.020, Speaker D: Are there any features you guys have thought about that, like might do a really good job of hitting on that, of being seen as like super black native features?
00:41:11.640 - 00:42:06.852, Speaker B: Right. So um, so we tend to be as, as DeFi project, we tend to be like accurate on the numbers. So we, so for the blast native yield, we just distribute it back to LP's fairly according to their liquidity provision amount and gas rebate, we give it all back to the users also proportionally to their, their spending on the, on the protocol. So basically it should be gasless transactions for all the, all the interaction with, with our protocol gas rebate will take some time. This, this hits some technical ground. I think blast has this 30 day, I think if I, if I read the doc correctly. So after three days, you will be, you will get, it's kind of like a rolling basis.
00:42:06.852 - 00:42:43.654, Speaker B: So after 30 days you will reclaim all the gas you've spent for the past month. Basically. Yeah. We do that for all of our users. I think the creative incentive here we got is really Blasco, like I said, we really want to optimize for the per dollar spent of the glass blasco receipt for the end user. And we'll incentivize that by directing that to certain pools. Give certain pools some multipliers and so on.
00:42:43.654 - 00:42:44.330, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:47.550 - 00:43:07.640, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. I'm really excited to see that kind of stuff. Just to see how different teams. It's really not like anything we've seen before. And it's just going to start to roll out more and more. Going to be fun to play around with and also to just like as a researcher, see, see how it works.
00:43:07.640 - 00:43:46.810, Speaker D: I'm interested in like timeline because we've seen, we've started looking into like these sort of concentrated liquidity Dexs since, I don't know, I think I first heard about them back in like March or April. And on most other chains, I think there are a few that are live, but none of them have really scaled too much yet. I'm wondering how are you guys thinking about 2024? Sort of like a rough roadmap where do you hope to be like by the end of the year? What are some key dates you're looking to have stuff rolled out by?
00:43:47.270 - 00:44:36.090, Speaker B: Right, so, so right now everything is structured around blast. There will be this blast token generation event around May or June. So we'll plan. So we'll do a lot of product updates and our incentive program around that time frame. Going more into the future, we might build second version or just improved products along the way. We really want to just factor in all of the users feedback. Like you said, we are one of the very few protocols that really launch and hit the market.
00:44:36.090 - 00:45:17.614, Speaker B: It's a brand new, it's a wild west, I would say permissionless leverage trading for anything. First time this is being achieved. So we are also learning along the way as well. So we believe in iterating on users feedback rather than just build something behind the scene and ship to the market. We just want to factor in all the users feedback. To be honest, what it will look like in six months of time, in a year of time, this will be very much determined by the. By the users, by the market.
00:45:17.614 - 00:45:27.410, Speaker B: We don't want to make something like clever prediction over time, and then it can be hard to predict. I would have to say.
00:45:29.470 - 00:46:33.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this was really good. I want to summarize the product alongside of the problem and how this product is potentially the solution, and correct me if I'm wrong. So, and Ali touched on this a bit, but the idea that I'm getting from, from this conversation is that this design has somewhat been attempted before. You know, trying to provide permissionless liquidity to these long tail assets and usage isn't really a problem. It's definitely been, or user demand hasn't been a problem. The problem has arose from the ability to provide liquidity for these. And so article solution revolves around like, it's basically native design inside of blast, and being able to reward these lp's in the most proper way to kind of fill that gap.
00:46:33.350 - 00:46:34.598, Speaker A: Do I have that correct?
00:46:34.774 - 00:46:36.302, Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes.
00:46:36.406 - 00:46:57.494, Speaker C: Yeah. I think. I think to add on to that, you can, you can kind of think of particles more of like, I guess like a layer of leverage in that it can aggregate, you know, spot liquidity from any underlying Dex. And it's very. It's highly aligned for dexs to do so. Right. As well as, you know, LP's and all the other projects.
00:46:57.494 - 00:47:53.476, Speaker C: So I think in terms of like, to competitors, well, I wouldn't say competitors, because when you bootstrap your own amm, you are kind of fighting a war. On two fronts. Right. Firstly, you have to fight, you have to bootstrap liquidity for your underlying, I guess, spot amms liquidity, in which you would be competing with everyone in the ecosystem that way. And then also, of course, the purpose of that is to enable, like a yemenite perp like experience in which now you're also fighting for trading volume and traders with, you know, anything from like a hybrid decks, a hybrid perp Dex, to, oh, sorry, you guys froze. Yeah, a hybrid perp Dex, you know, to other sort of similar, I guess, perp related platforms. So I think particle is kind of like aligning ourselves with, you know, the spot dexs and aggregating their liquidity.
00:47:53.476 - 00:48:53.590, Speaker C: And we're going to focus on using that liquidity to allow traders to trade with leverage while being aligned, highly aligned with the ecosystem. So I think that's the key here in that a lot of these projects that will bootstrap their amms, they're fundamentally fighting a much tougher battle, we feel, from our architecture and our approach to it is not exactly needed. So I think it's like if you are trying to bootstrap your own amm and also get setting up, I guess, your own derivative, not derivatives or perps platform, you're kind of trying to build essentially like an empire, right? You're trying to own the whole vertical, which fundamentally, it's a much different approach, I guess ours is more like composable, and we would be more so like a layer of leverage on top of all of these spot X's.
00:48:54.170 - 00:49:30.080, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think that message has became clear through this conversation. We talked a little bit about where volume has been kind of in these early days of last. We have some base references. We saw a bunch of meme coins and then kind of the majors popped up as volume. But we're in this kind of meme coin altcoin mania. What have your guys observations been on where volume on blast is and where you guys think it's headed?
00:49:31.620 - 00:50:42.750, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, it caught us by surprise that meme point volume is substantially higher than even, even the blue chip coins. But it's early days. It's hard to tell over the long months time, weeks time it's going to sustain or not. What I would say is there's a lot of interesting launch pattern mechanism for meme points altcoins. So this baseline project, launching coins by making sure the token deployer has to lock in some liquidity and giving the tokens very initial utility available for lending and so on, that's a very interesting way to launch projects and we know projects like Zap and Metadrop, they will do something interesting for token launches as well. So very excited to see different meme coins launch and altcoin launch on blast. I wouldn't say like specific which project to look up to.
00:50:42.750 - 00:50:51.270, Speaker B: It's really hard to tell. I'm not a big, very big name coin trader. So yeah, I don't have any financial advice over here.
00:50:52.890 - 00:51:18.390, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, fair enough. Definitely, definitely not looking for any necessarily. We're coming up on time here. I'm curious as to, before we start to wrap up, you guys have been live in Testnet for a little while. How has that been so far? Are there any observations that have come up? Any interesting activity you've seen anything unexpected? Just overall, how is the testnet period been?
00:51:19.170 - 00:51:50.124, Speaker B: The testnet period has been. It's overwhelming. We got a lot of transactions going, but Testnet is Testnet, right. So it's like free money and it's really stress testing like the system, but not stress testing like economic. We are live on Mainnet now and it has some considerable amount of TVO and traffic over there. Yeah, it's really different, a different beast. Mainnet.
00:51:50.124 - 00:52:07.256, Speaker B: We are trying to observe the user behavior. Fixing bugs everywhere. Yeah, it's hard to say any specific lesson so far. It's mostly just grinding on products and improving user experience.
00:52:07.448 - 00:53:07.976, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one thing that did send out from Testnet, obviously we had, I think over 50,000 users for each phase of our testnet. And before we closed the blast test and we had 500,000 transactions, this was not incentivized. But a really, really key thing is when we talk about the niche is leverage trade anything is that we found that the biggest audience for particle actually came from, I think, four countries. It was Japan, Korea, China and the United States. And one thing you'll notice about these four regions is that firstly, they're very highly sought after markets, but also they have this kind of regulatory wall closing in. For example, Korea has no leverage trading, they only have spot. Japan has I think been limited to two times leverage.
00:53:07.976 - 00:53:57.610, Speaker C: And things are getting closer, closer. China, Hong Kong, for example, you know, like crypto trading is already restricted there. United States as well. We're seeing like everything start to close in on exchanges, right? So I think we're, the key thing is we're seeing that a lot of these countries that don't really have, you know, like the full leverage training experience find particles super, super attractive and super interesting just because it enables something that is limited in their sort of geography. So I think that's probably like the key. Key thing that we noticed is that we didn't specifically target a specific region, but activity in these regions and the audience and reception in these regions has picked up significantly, naturally.
00:53:59.310 - 00:54:44.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that important to mention, you also touched on, I mean, 50,000 people on testnet on each phase is pretty remarkable. I think it's pretty clear what those users need and what they might be waiting for. I wanted to touch a little bit, as we wrap up here on if you guys had any specific plans on particle, specific incentive mechanisms, and then maybe touch on how you guys think about governance. You talk a lot about kind of the permissionlessness of the application. Are there any governance structures and any other prep Dexs or any other projects that you guys feel works well?
00:54:44.410 - 00:55:23.660, Speaker B: Yes. So we are a big fan of curve's ve model. So the Volscore model, they allow the token holders to vote which pool should attract more liquidity. Right now, we divert the blast gold as an incentive, like a guide for users to put in liquidity. But over long term, we want to do something along the lines of be model two, to let users permissionlessly incentivize other users to put in liquidity for certain pools. Um, yeah, I think. I think that will be a very good future to building to.
00:55:28.920 - 00:55:36.280, Speaker D: Nice. Yeah. There's a lot on the governance side we. We definitely find interesting. It's. It's. It's cool to see how.
00:55:36.280 - 00:56:02.450, Speaker D: How projects are thinking about that at this stage. Obviously quite early for you guys, I think, but always good to get thoughts there. We're about up on time here. I want to just give you guys a minute or two in case there was anything we missed that you wanted to let our audience know, any sort of calls to action, anything that you think the people should be aware of before we sign off.
00:56:03.110 - 00:56:23.800, Speaker B: I think we touched pretty much everything. Thanks once again for having us. So, to get to know more about particle everything is protocol trade. Our main page. The app is live on blast. Mainnet on app. Protocol trade.
00:56:23.800 - 00:56:50.450, Speaker B: Yeah, on our main page, protocol trade, you can see all the docs, all the social Twitter discord docs, and some medium article. Yeah, everything is there. If anyone has any, any question or run into any bugs in the. In the. In the product or improvement suggestions, feel free to come to our discord and open the ticket. Our team will be working on that.
00:56:52.750 - 00:57:03.574, Speaker A: Awesome. Great stuff. Again, we appreciate you guys for coming on. I hope everyone enjoyed that has been. That's it for this week. Thanks, guys.
00:57:03.742 - 00:57:04.886, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:57:04.998 - 00:57:05.790, Speaker B: Thank you for having us.
