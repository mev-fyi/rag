00:00:36.285 - 00:01:04.841, Speaker A: There we go. All right, welcome back, everyone, to another episode of exit liquidity, episode 90 this week. So we're coming up on the big 100 and eventually 1 billion. Last week we decided that's going to be a thing. Road to 1 billion episodes. This week we have a very special guest who I feel like we actually talked about having a long time ago, but we finally made it work this time. Darius from Vertex, thanks for.
00:01:04.841 - 00:01:06.313, Speaker A: Thanks for joining us, man.
00:01:06.489 - 00:01:25.925, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, guys. And you're going to age me, but you had this like ironic entry graphic that is actually like my first memory of computers was essentially what you put on the entry graphic, which is going to really fucking age me for this call. But yeah, I was fun. I like that a lot. It was cool.
00:01:26.395 - 00:01:32.375, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, we try to go for like a bit of like a retro video game vibe. Yeah, I like that.
00:01:32.835 - 00:01:36.295, Speaker B: Retro. Okay. Just move on. Move on.
00:01:36.995 - 00:01:52.855, Speaker A: Cool, man. Great to have you on. Of course. Would be lovely to start off with a little bit of background on who you are, who you were before crypto, how you got in, kind of what compelled you to enter this space and all that fun stuff.
00:01:53.345 - 00:02:16.725, Speaker B: Yeah, so my background is in trading. I started trading in like 04 straight out of university. I was an options trader in banks. And then I ended up running some desks at various companies. And then I was running a hedge fund. And so I heard about bitcoin like very early. A friend of mine tried to get me to buy around $10, I think.
00:02:16.725 - 00:02:52.165, Speaker B: And the famous words he said to me were, come on, let's put 10 grand in. What's the worst thing that could happen? I was like, fuck that, dude. I ain't gonna lose 10 grand. So that was my like first brush with the orange coin. And then I sort of kept my eye on it and missed it a couple of times that I was gonna buy and I didn't. And then I really got involved a bit more heavy handedly. When Bitmex first came out, I was working at the fund and it was like very boring at the time.
00:02:52.165 - 00:03:28.703, Speaker B: And then Bitmex brought up derivatives and it was like finally something that sort of connected to what I did in my day to day. So I was doing like cash and carry on bitmax and playing around with a few things. And so I was sort of involved in like 1718 with the ICO bubble and various things that happened then, and it sort of drifted away. It was kind of a hobby. I tried to get the fund involved but just couldn't get it over the line. And then when 2020 happened, Bitcoin had been very quiet for a couple years. I sort of took a punk.
00:03:28.703 - 00:04:12.955, Speaker B: So I sort of could see that with where we were going with monetary easing, it was probably going to be some uptake for btc, bought some btc, bought some ETH as a lagging trade because you could just see it just wasn't following. Made some cash. That sort of led me down the rabbit hole. Started looking at Defi Summer type stuff started happening because when I last looked at it, there was all this promise of doing stuff with smart contracts, but there wasn't really anything happening. You know, it was all just sort of pie in the sky. Then Defi Summer started happening, was all a bit more real and I sort of got excited and I was a bit bored. I'd basically been trading commods for like the worst five years you could have ever traded commodities in a hedge fund.
00:04:12.955 - 00:04:42.275, Speaker B: And I just thought I would take a flyer. So by the end of that year I had a job in crypto. Ended up leaving that quite quickly and then quickly jumped into the builder space. So the original idea for Vertex was like a cross currency trading platform built on Terra. And the idea was to be like a multi currency version of Anchor. That was the sort of killer app for it. Obviously most people know what happened to Tara.
00:04:42.275 - 00:05:21.225, Speaker B: So we'd raised money at that point and we realized like, actually all the things we built in terms of like cross collateralization, cross margining, the efficiency of how we did it, the speed of how we could execute, there were like a lot of things we built. We realized like, oh, the application of this would work well just for crypto. Could just build a really great exchange that was sort of the exchange we would have wanted when we were trading. And so we sort of pivoted, we moved to Arbitrum, we built out the V1 of the product and then we launched about 18 months ago.
00:05:25.045 - 00:05:50.515, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah. Always, always good to meet another Terra victim. I would say probably. It sounds like. It sounds like you probably had it a bit more jarring than we did being a builder there. But it's good to see validation of your idea and then moving somewhere to where it's not built on a house of popsicle sticks is very encouraging.
00:05:50.515 - 00:06:18.615, Speaker A: I think that is a good segue into. It's kind of a rite of passage on this show. It's a rite of passage in crypto that, you know, you get rugged, you get dumped on, you are someone's exit liquidity. And in order to be on the show you obviously have to have been exit liquidity at some point. So before we get started, we like to hear everybody's favorite exit liquidity story of a time when you were exit liquidity in crypto.
00:06:19.475 - 00:06:55.797, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, I think the first time I. But I bought some bitcoin, I think it was on Coinbase and I read something was saying about, oh, you should custody your own btc. And back then there was no real custody solutions. Right. It was not an easy thing to do. I don't know what fucking got into me, but I decided to like send a test transaction, having no real clue what I was doing. And I think I sent like three bitcoin, which is the time was like, I don't know, like $300 worth.
00:06:55.797 - 00:07:21.109, Speaker B: But obviously now I'm like, yeah, what a fucking idiot. So I have a few mistakes like that, which were just pure functional ones. I don't know, like first time I started interacting with smart contracts. I think I got. I was playing around on BSC for some reason. I don't know why or something. Bsc, I got scammed on some project.
00:07:21.109 - 00:07:47.139, Speaker B: The project got rugged. I think I lent, you know, in that 2021, my neighbor asked me to lend him a couple of each so he could do a NFT mint. He got scammed in the Discord Group. So I ended up having to like socialize that loss with him. I mean, you name it, I've probably done it. Really. You know, a lot of people say, like, ah, you know, I'm too smart to get scammed.
00:07:47.139 - 00:08:10.985, Speaker B: If you haven't been scammed, I don't think you've been trying hard enough. Like, everyone's been scammed somehow. There was an amazing one. I was waiting for a white list on something on a telegram channel and it popped up and said, click this link now. And it was on Salada. The transaction got confirmed so quickly that my wallet drained before I even knew what was happening. I was like, is it.
00:08:10.985 - 00:08:25.405, Speaker B: Did it go through? Oh, all my soul have gone. Well, luckily I got a bit smarter by that point, so I think I had like one soul in there. And it was kind of a couple hundred dollars at the time. But yeah, I've had loads of those.
00:08:26.545 - 00:08:30.245, Speaker A: Yeah, Yeah. A true trench warrior, it sounds like.
00:08:31.425 - 00:08:34.085, Speaker B: Or idiot, whichever one you want to call it.
00:08:34.585 - 00:09:04.885, Speaker A: There's some overlap there for sure, but we, you know, we take pride in it for sure. I'd like to get a little bit into Vertex now, more specifically. Obviously, you guys were building on Terra for a while. It sounds like the vision was a Little bit different or at least the infrastructure behind it. Can you talk a little bit about what Vertex was then or what you were building was then and how it's become what it is today?
00:09:05.645 - 00:10:15.689, Speaker B: Yeah, so the reason we were building on Terra was that Terra had this like set of stable coins. Everyone knew about ust, but it had the ability to mint and redeem like a euro based coin, Chinese coin, Aussie coin, Yen, Korean, Korean was actually used for chai, which is like a payments network. But there was like a few different use cases. And my background, I actually started out as an FX trader and I was like, wouldn't it be cool if there was like a little bit more utility for these coins? Because there are a lot of people using crypto that are not US based that you might want to do something in something that like more closely relates to their home currency. And so the initial concept was if the biggest utility on Tara is anchor, how do we make anchor yields available for people in these other currencies? And the answer in FX is quite simple. You do what's called an FX swap. So you like, you sell swap and you buy a forward and you translate the interest rate risk from one into the other.
00:10:15.689 - 00:10:59.025, Speaker B: It's like quite a simple thing to do. And I realized like, well, we don't have FX forwards but you do have perps. So if you could build a market with FX perps and do these swaps, you could translate anchor into many different currencies. And so that's what we designed for. But actually once you start to go down the rabbit hole of that, what you realize is what you've really built is a platform for translating currency risk on anything. So the target we then got to was we were literally about to release it. It was, it was fucking cool, was you could come in and trade on leverage, any crypto against any currency.
00:10:59.025 - 00:11:52.905, Speaker B: So you just come and say like you want to be long litecoin versus yen. There you go, 10x leverage, done. You want to be sure like you know, Solana versus Aussie, no problem, done. And so we had this all mapped out and what this needed was like you could cross collateralize things, cross margin them, have liquidity on all these things, have different pairs going on. It was like a genuinely difficult problem to solve. And yeah, we were, we launched a test net, we closed it down, then we rebuilt to this test net and we were two weeks away from launch. We were doing all the marketing and stuff and then Tara blew up and it was kind of a crazy week because we managed to move all of our ust off before it, you know, I think we got out at a $0.98
00:11:52.905 - 00:12:26.775, Speaker B: average. So it was like incredibly lucky or foresight or whatever you want to call it, and then moved away. But, you know, we ended up with this thing where we'd spend some money already we had a Treasury, but like our reason to live was very connected with the chain. So we ended up going down to like a core team of about six. And then we just like rebuilt everything from the ground up. So that was May. We launched Test net on Arbitrum in December and then we launched the product in April.
00:12:28.755 - 00:12:41.507, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. 98 cents on the dollar is very, very, very good. Very lucky. That's like 98 more cents on the dollar than me and C. Yeah, it's.
00:12:41.531 - 00:13:07.395, Speaker B: One of those things where like, obviously I haven't seen something actually go to zero before. Right. Saying something's going to go to zero is like a thing traders say on a trading floor. Like, this is going to zero and you short it. It's the first time I've actually seen something go to zero. So that was fun. And then, but, but a D peg always looks like a D peg and like I traded D pegs before.
00:13:07.395 - 00:13:43.095, Speaker B: So once you see that the thing is not connected on price, the logic is always like risk 2, or depending how you think it, like risk 50 to make 2. It's just bad risk reward once a dpeg starts to happen. I didn't, I didn't think it was going to go to zero. Right. But the best risk management thing I had in my head from years of trading was it doesn't matter, you got to sell. So we sold and we got out. And I think that was on the Monday morning.
00:13:43.095 - 00:13:52.295, Speaker B: By Monday afternoon we were out. And then by like Wednesday, all my friends from the ecosystem were calling me, crying. It was like. It was bad.
00:13:53.995 - 00:14:16.145, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I think, well, when you were making that decision to move, you're kind of moving a whole team watching like the world behind you collapse. What was it like on Arbitrum that time and building in that ecosystem? Was it an easy choice? Was it, did they do something special?
00:14:18.245 - 00:14:54.705, Speaker B: So it took us a little while to actually decide to move to Arbitrum because frankly, we just weren't that in tune with what was going on in the EVM ecosystem. We were like very terror focused. And I don't know if you remember, but after Terra collapsed, like I used to refer to it as like a refugee crisis. Right. Like all these people left Terra and if you imagine like each Blockchain is like an island. Most people just swam for the nearest island and the nearest island was Cosmos. Right.
00:14:54.705 - 00:15:21.105, Speaker B: You didn't have to rewrite your contracts really. Everything worked. The tooling was similar. Like you could just go there, get going, it would be fine. We took a look at everything we said, like, you know, probably this is going to be like a bit of a credit crisis for crypto. It's not going to be the case that, you know, all these ultimate L1s and everything survive. You know, we kind of expected there to be issues.
00:15:21.105 - 00:15:53.935, Speaker B: As we said, the place it makes most sense to be is where there's the most capital, which is Ethereum. And we want to do a high performance trading thing that's not going to work on L1. So we need to go to L2. ZK solutions just weren't there at that point. So it really came down to is optimism or Arbitrum. And at that point we just felt Arbitrum had executed better and the decision was sort of made for us, if you know what I mean. It wasn't really like a big choice once you sort of did the process of elimination.
00:15:53.935 - 00:15:55.811, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:55.963 - 00:16:12.215, Speaker C: And what was, what was Defi and Arbitrum like back then? I'm trying to remember, to feel like I was around. But was it the dominant player? Was it, you know, as strong as it is perceived now and like in the past year.
00:16:13.075 - 00:16:41.625, Speaker B: So I think you'd have this like big knock from terrible. If you remember, it took some time before FTX went down. Right. The two things were connected, but there was this whole thing of like consolidation and Sam was kind of like running to the rescue. So a lot of things were just sort of operating almost business as usual, but it had changed a bit. You couldn't quite tell, but it was a bit weird. Right.
00:16:41.625 - 00:17:14.575, Speaker B: And then Arbitrum, I think GMX had been pretty successful there. Right. But they were sort of new. I don't know exactly when they launched, but I think it was like early 2021. So by the time we were looking for somewhere new, they kind of established themselves and got some popularity. And partly that was driven by a lot of speculation that Arbitrum were going to do a large airdrop at some point and that you wanted to be on there because and trade something. And that was like the best thing to trade on at that time.
00:17:14.575 - 00:17:33.265, Speaker B: So I don't think when we made the decision it was quite such a thing, but by the time we launched it was way more of a thing and GMX was kind of. When we Launched was like peak, peak gmx. Like everyone was just talking about gmx.
00:17:34.325 - 00:17:58.659, Speaker C: How was it like launching into peak gmx? I'm assuming it wasn't. Maybe the vision was of course like kind of what is live now with Edge and this kind of cross chain ecosystem function. But was it originally just very high performant multiple markets? What were the main focuses when you guys first launched on Arbitrum?
00:17:58.787 - 00:18:36.341, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's a great question. Honestly it was brutal, man. Because our vision, we didn't have the Edge vision at that point. Right. The cross chain thing evolved with time and our point of view was, and it may have been a bit naive, I think we underestimated the tribalism of crypto. We were like, all right, there's loads of users on Arbitrum who are trading perks. A lot of those obviously want like super high leverage on GMX trading BTC and eth because they only had BTC and ETH really at that point.
00:18:36.373 - 00:18:36.565, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:36.605 - 00:19:09.125, Speaker B: Because of glp. So we're like great, like that's perfect for them. We can offer a much more like pro oriented service, like super cheap, very high throughput. We're going to list a load of tokens over time that like give us different trading options and it'll just be a different offering. It's just different. I don't know that some of the GMX community felt that when we originally came to Arbitrum. So that was a surprise for us.
00:19:09.125 - 00:19:58.061, Speaker B: But you know, like now if, you know, I talk with coin flip semi regularly and like, you know, I think we both acknowledge like our platforms do different things, it's just a different product, you know, it's not really competitor, it's complementary in a lot of ways. So the, I guess it's played out as I thought it would eventually. But originally day one it was definitely like, who are these guys? And you know, honestly we just weren't a competitor then to start with. Right. They were doing like hundreds of millions a day and we were doing like in the first couple of weeks if we did $10 million, I was really stoked. You know, I have a funny story. When we launched day one, we didn't even have a market maker.
00:19:58.061 - 00:20:28.035, Speaker B: In the first couple hours they committed and then they never showed up. And so the first two hours, myself and one of the team, handmade markets using our UI because we hadn't had the foresight to build a bot to help us out. I was entering bids and offers using my own capital on the book just to make sure we had something people could Trade against. So yeah, it was. We were small and scrappy to start with, but we've grown since then. Yeah.
00:20:28.075 - 00:20:31.547, Speaker C: And that was April 23rd, you said?
00:20:31.640 - 00:20:33.459, Speaker B: That was April 23.
00:20:33.507 - 00:20:44.135, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And what was like the general perps landscape across chains, across the whole crypto kind of sphere at that time, looking like.
00:20:44.595 - 00:21:28.905, Speaker B: So I think because of the success of gmx, there'd been this like absolute flurry of people launching forks or definitely things that were inspired and that used a peer to pool model. So when we launched Vertex, obviously it takes time to spin up liquidity, especially on an order book. Like, it's a complex thing to do. It's not easy. There were a lot of haters, like people that said, why are you doing this? This is a stupid way to get liquidity. Order books suck. Why would you do an order book, do a pool, much, much better, et cetera, et cetera.
00:21:28.905 - 00:22:18.365, Speaker B: And at the time, the most dominant perp decks in the space, funnily enough, was dydx. They were the og, they were doing the most volume. And it was very clear to me that if we wanted to have longevity for the sort of thing we were doing and that we thought we were good at, order book was the way forward. We just had to like persist and get over that sort of J curve, you know, get through the dip at the bottom where it's hard to spin up. I think now most people would say that like an order book is probably the better model for almost all things. I know that there's been like a lot of innovation and if you want to be like truly fully on chain, you can't really do an order book because of the latency requirements. You know, like on chain order books kind of suck.
00:22:18.365 - 00:22:54.835, Speaker B: Right, because they're slow and the latency that adds means the liquidity is worse. And that then in turn means that like people trade less and it's kind of a horrible cycle. You need to have some kind of like off chain solution that solves for that. You know, we have our sequencer, different people have different solutions. But yeah, at the time this was all like a huge debate. And you know, we ended up, you know, I put a lot of thought pieces out on Twitter that people didn't read, explaining our point of view. But I think eventually with air now, people kind of get what the value prop is.
00:22:56.575 - 00:23:20.615, Speaker C: And could you kind of walk through the. So it was DYDX main player at the time. What were you guys thinking about at that time in terms of like, how to take some of those larger incumbents I don't want to say down but like you know how to move up the, move up the ladder. What was the like thought process on your guys aside?
00:23:23.595 - 00:24:25.625, Speaker B: I think like always for me the main target initially was to overtake dydx. So when I looked at what was going on in the space it was like clear. DYBX had this sort of rarefied air where they would OG protocol, they had the brand name but we knew that they were working towards V4 and our view was that an on chain order book would be necessarily worse than a off chain order book. And whilst we have a lot of respect for that team so you know the thing I always said to people was like yeah, if anyone can work it out it'll be them. I just don't think it's possible to work out. You know we took a lot of inspiration from what they've done around UX and look and feel like I think they were like one of the first defi things that really felt nice to use. It's like a good experience.
00:24:25.625 - 00:25:21.375, Speaker B: Like I even I was a user, you know, I still like using their app. I thought it was great. So we sort of took from that and we said okay, what's the next evolution of that? It's a better matching engine. It's multiple collaterals, it's the ability to do spot, it's the ability to have like cross margin, cross collateralization that it just all kind of works together. And we sort of borrowed from a few places, made a few things up ourselves and the idea was to be like the place for so more higher volume, more professional type traders, like a pro, retail type person, Prosumer. My consumer guys like to tell me as a name that prosumer person was the kind of person we wanted to go after and we have a lot of those, you know. And so funnily enough we have overtaken DYDX in terms of volumes on most days.
00:25:21.375 - 00:25:48.755, Speaker B: But the space has grown and you know, what you see now is like token farming on various protocols is a massive driver of volumes. So we've seen various people go up and down. That continues to happen. I think we found a kind of a different groove that we've had it after can talk about as well.
00:25:48.795 - 00:26:41.835, Speaker C: But when like you have your initial idea in your head that you're kind of like building towards and that your team is like building towards, you're making certain design trade offs and decisions you're watching competitors make, you know, other decisions. Did things I guess progress the way that you anticipated? Did you notice Anything or kind of, you know like there was, there's always a debate in crypto, there's always a debate between chains, between infrastructure, between models for liquidity. What were some of those that were like pretty pivotable or pivotal across your guys growth that you're kind of observing now and you're like I can't believe people were arguing about this. This was obviously the better choice or you know, this is, this type of model is probably going to kind of crush and burn or you know, xyz.
00:26:42.175 - 00:27:15.615, Speaker B: Yeah. So like I think the pool versus order book one was huge when we started and to me it's like you just cannot compete with the capital efficiency of an order book. It's just impossible. You can do other things with the pool which are useful. Right. But in terms of just like pure risk expression, an order book is an order book for a reason. There's a reason that all tradfi exchanges use an order book that's just for me inarguable.
00:27:16.435 - 00:27:26.935, Speaker C: If, sorry, I don't want to cut you off but if you had to steel man, the argument for a pool based model, what would you say the main argument is?
00:27:28.115 - 00:28:02.639, Speaker B: There's no real J curve to a pool, right. So when you start, you don't have such a cold start problem. Right. If you have a pool and it's active, that will drive yield, that will boost, strap in line with your usage and there's like a very organic path to growing there. The trouble with an order book is it's either good or it's right. So to get from to good you've got to do some work to get through that hump and that hump is painful and you've got to have a certain skill set. You've got to be able to talk to traders, set up your tech for it.
00:28:02.639 - 00:29:08.711, Speaker B: You've got to do a lot where the good thing with a pool is you can just say to a bunch of djs, come and drop your capital here and then other djms are going to trade against it. Yeah, it's way cleaner way to spin things up, like way cleaner. And there were points where I'm arguing for an order book and I was thinking maybe my life would be easier if we'd done a pool, you know, so like it's not, it's not clear cut in all directions. And the other thing with a pool is, you know, maybe not with the way GMX have done it, although they've done some nice like redesign I think with the GLV they've done recently. But the you know, say gains, they have a dollar pool, right? They just like strap in a price feed, put an open interest cap on, have some like funding rated charges, pretty high fee and then people just trade like amazing. And if people want to trade a new thing, they just put a new price feed on and some risk like amazing. Like for me I gotta like do the new product, I gotta set up all these feeds, I gotta go and get market makers to make prices for it.
00:29:08.711 - 00:29:50.845, Speaker B: Like it's quite a lot of hassle. So there's probably like a biting point for on chain stuff where it's somewhere between the two. You know, like having been like an order book maxi. I still am an order book maxi. Yeah, I'm a bit more like pragmatic now where it will probably make sense for Vertex to have a few price feeds for longer tail assets that retail folk want to trade in small size. Like we should have that to facilitate for them. So like I've done a bit of a360 myself where I can say like yeah, look there are benefits I think for the bulk of our trading order book, still the best, but there are reasons we might add a pool and do other things with it.
00:29:52.265 - 00:29:55.325, Speaker A: Yeah, we've had a number of.
00:29:57.025 - 00:29:57.313, Speaker B: Order.
00:29:57.329 - 00:30:54.395, Speaker A: Book maxis and just AMM gigabrains on the podcast before. I guess we haven't talked about in a while but it definitely is a debate we touched base on multiple times in the past. The order book argument definitely is salient but I think from my perspective the way I see it is like by trying to go and build like an AMM based perp decks, like purely AMM based. That's like you're taking a system that is like still way too immature and trying to apply it to like a very mature product which is perps trading. And like order books have been like a, you know, a table of bids and asks has been, has been a thing since like we could write stuff down really. Obviously you know, that's an oversimplification of what it is now. But it's been around much, much longer than AMMs than like passive, passive liquidity pools.
00:30:54.395 - 00:31:38.521, Speaker A: So like I'm, I'm definitely not an order book maxi. I think it has its place in like perps especially but like I think we can get to a point where AMMs have their place as well. It's just you can't start off by like trying to find a way to make passive LPing profitable against perp traders. You have to start with like the fundamental issues of like getting It, Right. With one really liquid, highly traded pair figuring out stuff like, figuring out stuff like mev, like asset risk, impermanent loss, all that stuff. It's, It's a different problem though. Like, it's, it's, it's not the same design space at all.
00:31:38.521 - 00:31:44.645, Speaker A: It's like seeing people compare them almost feels like, I don't know, weird to me.
00:31:45.465 - 00:32:19.895, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, honestly, like, I think GMX did a great job with what they've done. I think they've sort of pushed the boundaries of what can be done. And I think for me, as I've evolved, I've become more of a like, user experience maxi. I don't really care, like if users tell me they need something, I'll just look for whatever the best tools are and I'll use it. It just so happens, like most of the time that's an order book. But like, as I said, like, if you want to facilitate certain kind of risk profiles or assets, like, yeah, pool makes sense.
00:32:19.895 - 00:32:21.795, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:21.835 - 00:33:05.355, Speaker C: And when you guys were building out the order book, you meant, you touched on some of the things that make an order book a good order book and the humps that you guys have to like, get over. But there's also what you discussed earlier of fully on chain order book or the concept of a fully on chain order book. Could you walk through kind of like the benefits? I mean, I don't even know if fully on chain order book totally exists at the moment and like why people want to work through that so much. And kind of some of the humps that you guys have gotten through through Vertex itself for making a good order book.
00:33:05.655 - 00:33:43.457, Speaker B: Yeah. So the main problem with order books. Right. Is like, you want there to be as much liquidity as possible, as close to the top of book as possible so people can execute and get their risk on. That's like the core problem you're trying to solve for is you're trying to create a marketplace where there's lots of supply and that will bring lots of demand. And then you end up in this like network effect where more demand comes, so more supply comes and blah, blah, blah. But if you can't get it to like a critically acceptable mass, you never get the demand side, so the supply side never comes.
00:33:43.457 - 00:34:51.475, Speaker B: So good example is like if you go to an online shop and just everything's expensive and there's no stop, you just won't go back there. Whereas if you go to Amazon and there's like a million retailers like battling on price to try and get your attention and they have everything there, you just go there over and over again, right? That's just how it works. Same thing with an order book. Now for suppliers to be close to the top of the book and to fulfill these orders, there's like a problem. Because like a market maker is basically like short an option, right? They put the price up for you to trade, but if the price moves quicker than they can like cancel and replace their trade, then they stand to lose money. So market makers make that back in two ways, right? One is the spread, so they'd like distance they have from what they think is fair value and the other one is like a rebate. So typically the exchange will pay back some element of the trading fee to the market maker to compensate them for that short option.
00:34:51.475 - 00:35:52.895, Speaker B: So combination of spread plus fee is like your premium for selling the option. Now the problem is with an on chain order book is that the latency is sort of constrained by how dispersed the nodes are within the chain, right? There's like an actual physical amount of time it takes for light to travel between the nodes to achieve consensus. Even if you like co locate the nodes such that the latency goes up by multiples. So you know, like even like hyperliquid have done like a co located nodes for their chain, right? So they've done a pretty good job. I think they're. I didn't check the block time recently, but I think it's like 200, 250 milliseconds, something like that. But like if you look at vertex, you know, a lot of traders trading with us via private link, they effectively have like a co location with our server.
00:35:52.895 - 00:36:17.885, Speaker B: They can change orders on the order of like 800 microseconds, right? So the level of optionality they're leaving out there is less. So the ability to put liquidity at the top of the book is better, right? So once you go into like an on chain order book, like you gotta do other things to protect the market makers. So like sometimes people do. Do you not have frequent batch of auctioners?
00:36:18.385 - 00:36:20.505, Speaker C: Yeah, that was my next question.
00:36:20.665 - 00:37:06.185, Speaker B: So sometimes people use like frequent batch auction mechanism, which is actually like perfect for blockchains, right? Because you say like, okay, we won't do it as like moving sequentially. We just every time a block updates, then we'll say, okay, these are the state of the order book and this is what matches. Then we'll do another one and another one. The main problem with that is actually that like market makers are incredibly lazy, right? They have all these people working really hard they're super resource constrained. So if you say to them like, oh yeah, we built this new thing, you're going to have to build a whole new model to market make on it. They're just like, oh screw that, I just can't be bothered. Right? So you don't even get them trying and then you never get customers and you have the same problem and then you run into other things.
00:37:06.185 - 00:37:31.139, Speaker B: So like I actually think it's pretty smart. Hyperliquid put a like last look mechanism in on their book, right. So what they say is this is like, it's typical in crypto. Everyone thinks they invented it. This has existed in FX for like 20 years. But what do they say is they prioritize cancellations on the block. So now every 200 milliseconds you have the right to cancel your trade.
00:37:31.139 - 00:38:14.875, Speaker B: So if you see an order come in and you don't like it, you jump to the front of the queue, you say no, I won't do that order anymore. So now what's that created? Like? Okay, yeah, I'll be comfortable showing size at the top of the book, but if I see an order I don't like, I just remove it and I retreat back in the order book. So they increased their optionality that way because they decreased the optionality with the level of latency built in because of the chain. So some way, somehow you gotta find ways to protect market makers, but you gotta decide where's the balance between protecting the market makers and allowing takers to still get their flow done. That's kind of a constant challenge.
00:38:16.655 - 00:38:49.365, Speaker A: Right? That's so that's like, that's like the functional and like performance component of the order book. What about, to me the most interesting thing about Vertex is edge layer. I think that that was a huge, huge step in the right direction and something that was like something that was much needed like within the perp decks space. Can you talk a little bit about like how that plays into, how that plays into the order book and like across different chains?
00:38:50.025 - 00:40:00.435, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think basically with how the market's set up, if you look at the order book perp daxes, the prevailing so wisdom has been, well, this needs to be high performance, therefore I want to save gas, therefore I want to make things quicker, I want to decentralize. The best way to do is build an app chain, have my order book run on that app chain and I will bring everyone to me. Right? And that's the route that DYDX have gone as the route hyperloop would have Gone. And it, it makes sense, right? It's like it has a logic to it. With us, the, I guess there were a few like insights or assumptions we made. One was that like, okay, we're really good at product, but like, are we going to win at community building? We weren't so sure that like necessarily we would be the biggest winner if that was the battle, which is essentially the battle you enter if you go into building an app chain.
00:40:00.435 - 00:40:44.363, Speaker B: What we realized was, well, we already had our own sequencer that sits off chain and there are two problems we're trying to solve for. One is how do we settle? And the other one is how do we decentralize the sequences? Let's deal with those two things differently. On the settlement layer, we realized if we allow users from different chains to match at the sequencer level, a purpose is synthetic assets. So we don't really have to do a transfer until there's a settlement of P and L. Right. So let's say you guys trade. One of you is on mantle, one of you is on arbitrum, you trade with each other, and now we settle your trades.
00:40:44.363 - 00:41:04.979, Speaker B: Right. So one on arbitrum is long, the one on mantle short. Well, the risk is imbalanced. So what we do is we have what we call an X account that sits on both chains and it has equal and opposite positions. So it's basically we've kind of teleported the risk from one chain to another. Right. So now risks imbalance.
00:41:04.979 - 00:41:25.709, Speaker B: Cool. But now one of you makes money, one of you loses money. What happens? Well, in isolation, we just have to do a bridging trade, in which case would be very expensive. Right. We haven't really saved ourselves anything by doing this cross chain trade. But actually what happens is we see a lot of netting. Right.
00:41:25.709 - 00:41:46.185, Speaker B: Because you're not the only traders on mantle or arbitrum. There are lots of other people on arbitrary mantle taking the other side of the position. So now that P and L imbalance doesn't happen so often. Okay. We say, well, it will happen sometimes. Right? That's true. But also we have borrow end markets built into every chain.
00:41:46.185 - 00:42:21.365, Speaker B: So now the X account can borrow from one side and lend to another. And so long as those interest rates are in balance, we don't really have to move the cash across unless there's like a cash crunch on one chain or other. Right. And when we built this, my expectation was we would probably bridge, I don't know, two or three times a week like I thought would be efficient. We've been up and running now for like six months. I think we bridged like four or five times. And one of those really we can actually, we probably shouldn't have.
00:42:21.365 - 00:42:48.379, Speaker B: So it's been extremely efficient. It's been very, very good way of translating liquidity from one chain to another. And the nice thing is we just solved that cold start problem for perps. You don't have to build liquidity every time you go to a new chain. In fact it doesn't really matter. We could go to one chain and if we get 10 users, was 10 more new users. It doesn't really matter where.
00:42:48.379 - 00:43:18.985, Speaker B: Like under current circumstance, if you build liquidity somewhere and the users don't come, it's disaster right? With us we have that room to experiment, make mistakes, move on, get to somewhere new. And that's been like super. And it allows us, it allows us to partner with chains as well and do work with them. So it's been really good for us. Like we get the community on various chains, we get support from foundations. Yeah, it's been good.
00:43:20.285 - 00:43:38.025, Speaker C: Sorry, I just thought of a, I think that's interesting and it led me to think of a random hypothetical. Could you theoretically, you could theoretically launch this with some type of front end on any permissionless chain.
00:43:40.225 - 00:44:20.455, Speaker B: So we'd have to launch the contracts to integrate it with the sequencer because the moment the sequencers permission. But say, for example, I can tell you quite openly we're speaking to teams where they will run a front end on top of Vertex liquidity. So Edge broadcasts the liquidity into the chain, they manage the front end, they have their own token, they trade. We actually did this an experiment on Blast. So we built another brand ourselves which is called Blitz that is like more aligned with the kind of Blast ethos and community. It's kind of smaller. It was a bit of an experiment on our part.
00:44:20.455 - 00:45:07.085, Speaker B: I think the learnings we had from it was it's better if it's separated out into a slightly different entity. So you know, we have a couple of members on the team that deal with that solely as like their kind of province. But what it made us realize was like, oh, we could get third party teams to build on top of Vertex and just have a whole different brand and a whole different thing. So I won't mention the change but I think you could very easily guess chains where they're going to have very much their own vibe and their own thing going on. That's like a way better route to market than taking Vertex there. And Vertex holders can still benefit because still Flow and revenue and stuff coming through Edge into the system, but it just brings us to a whole new audience.
00:45:07.705 - 00:46:01.509, Speaker C: Yeah, I think most of the new chain integrations have been bringing perps and sophisticated perps to an ecosystem that is pretty nascent or new or doesn't have a very good perps platform. We saw that with something like say recently. You guys are on base now. I was thinking of it more in the hypothetical of trying to grab liquidity from other ecosystems. Theoretically you could just launch this thing on hyper liquid on different. Like yeah, if that becomes a chain, you can just. Has has that ever been thought of in terms of like targeting different chains or ecosystems? Because there's also mega Eth that's launching.
00:46:01.509 - 00:46:39.635, Speaker C: That's you know, thinking about, you know, there's movement, there's monad, there's like a bunch of different places that are. And in all of Those performant blockchain L2L1 spaces, they. The. The main debate is around order books and on chain order books. So there will be like different types of solutions. But I was curious if you were thinking about like using the abilities of Edge to I guess compete and win in a newer area or an area that has a dominant PROS platform there already.
00:46:40.175 - 00:47:17.235, Speaker B: Yeah. So honestly, we don't worry too much about where we go. Like as I said, the sort of origin story we started on Arbitrum and GMX was the king of Arbitrum. Right. So I don't think anything could be much more difficult than that in terms of like walking in somewhere. Yeah, look, we look at all these chains and look at opportunity. I think the biggest thing for us now is we run a parallel EBM in our sequencer.
00:47:17.235 - 00:47:47.333, Speaker B: Right. So to change that to another VM would be difficult. It's not impossible. But to have like more than one VM going in parallel across various chains and maintaining state, it starts becoming like quite a gnarly problem. You know, of course we talked about it in the context of like Solana, which is obviously like a big opportunity. There's a lot of people trading there. You know, we looked at the move chains as well.
00:47:47.333 - 00:48:10.659, Speaker B: Like for now I think we've just focused on deploying to EVMs. But you know, like, yeah, you know, if, if hyper liquids L1 becomes like a genuine thing where people want to trade on other apps. Like, why not? I don't know how low, how welcome we'll be. Might be a bit of a troll, but yeah, sure, why not? We'll see.
00:48:10.707 - 00:48:15.491, Speaker A: That would be hilarious. Honestly, I would love to see that.
00:48:15.683 - 00:48:20.055, Speaker B: Yeah, they're building a blockchain. They surely will welcome all apps.
00:48:20.355 - 00:48:40.905, Speaker A: Yeah, I would hope so. Yeah. Would, would be entertaining if nothing else. You mentioned some other L1s there. What's like, what does it look like operationally or like technically to deploy to a non EVM chain? Is it, is it more work for you guys? Is it, is edge layer just like him?
00:48:41.685 - 00:49:00.313, Speaker B: Yeah. So first of all you got to be okay with watching engineers cry. Like having grown men just sob at you when you ask them to do something. I got no problem with that. Second of all, they then have to do a fuckload of work. So when we built the Rust based EVM that we have now. Right.
00:49:00.313 - 00:49:47.731, Speaker B: So it's, it does a lot to recreate that on say Solana. Like I think it would probably be a pretty solid three or four months of work for like a couple of our more senior team members just because maybe it would be less. We've gone back and forth. The other problem is it's hard to maintain. Our code base is still live, right. So we still push updates and change things like pretty regularly because we're updating features and stuff. But part of that problem would become then you like square the risk that something goes wrong.
00:49:47.731 - 00:50:15.125, Speaker B: We have auditors looking at things and we double check everything and then you gotta like double check both of those. But then double check they match each other. Double check they then match the power. Like it becomes like a very difficult problem to deal with. Well, so it's not impossible, but I think just from a resourcing standpoint and like where it makes sense to go for the easy wins, we're just not there yet.
00:50:17.045 - 00:50:23.305, Speaker C: So it's basically like a, almost like a clearing house in inside 100%.
00:50:23.765 - 00:50:42.973, Speaker B: Right. It's a clearing house with like settlement into many different chains. So we never touch flow of funds. Right. All the orders come in signed, hit the sequencer and then we just like assign them to all the different chains. So if you're, if you're on a chain, you never feel anything else. You're just on that chain merrily trading away.
00:50:42.973 - 00:51:12.375, Speaker B: Do whatever you do. But it may be that you've matched and traded with someone on another chain you know you're on say where you know, you pointed out it's very active. They don't know that they're not trading on SEI with SEI liquidity. They. But they usually because SEI's new to us, we don't have many market makers there. You know, most of the market making is happening on arbitrary so then they're trading on sei, but they're trading with people on Arbitrum. It's just seamless.
00:51:12.375 - 00:51:22.855, Speaker B: So, yeah, that, like, clearing house analogy is a good one, right? It just comes in, it clears through, it goes down and settles, and then we manage things on a chain by chain basis. Then.
00:51:23.635 - 00:51:30.335, Speaker A: Do you have. Do you have a favorite deployment like a favorite child?
00:51:31.915 - 00:51:35.095, Speaker B: No, I have a favorite child. Don't tell her.
00:51:37.125 - 00:51:45.105, Speaker A: You don't have a preference? You don't have, like, any soft spot for any one of them or like, any particularly more bullish feelings on one deployment over the other?
00:51:45.765 - 00:52:37.855, Speaker B: No, look, I think actually, like, the benefit of being a bit more agnostic is that you can take something out of all the chains that we go to. You know, we don't deploy on a chain unless we think it's going to be good. You know, we talk to the foundation teams, we talk to the community. We go and see what's going on there. You know, we want to see, can we make an impact on this chain? Can we make something different happen here? And, you know, if you look at all the chains we're on, we tend to be the biggest, if not one of the biggest on that chain in terms of trading volume activity, block space consumption, whatever it is. And so, no, they all bring different things and there's all different challenges and fun, you know, like, your arbitrum tends to be more of the, like, defi heavy crowd. Mantle is kind of like more regionally focused in, like, Asia.
00:52:37.855 - 00:53:08.961, Speaker B: So we're connecting with people there. And you go with, like, say they've got like more of a defi sort of culty, NFT sort of culty community that's built up there. So, like, you're introducing them to Defi for the first time. You go to base and there's like a meme coin culture. So now we're interacting with meme coin projects to bring some coins onto us in this spot or perp, and then we take out to their community and bring them in. So, like, each one's got its own thing going. You know, you go to blast, it's like much more.
00:53:08.961 - 00:53:28.945, Speaker B: Again, they're a little bit more culty, sort of aligned with Pac Man. Like, it's got like his own vibe come over from the Blur ecosystem. Like, they just. Each one's got something to play with. And I sort of envisage that would be the case. And I think that's the strength in what we're doing. Right? It's got a.
00:53:28.945 - 00:53:45.261, Speaker B: It's got a Little bit more heterogeneity to it. Right. So like in that sense it's not all levered to one thing. You know, if we don't hit somewhere, we'll hit somewhere else. Like it's cool.
00:53:45.293 - 00:54:09.885, Speaker A: Yeah. Would it ever make sense to. I don't think L2s have been around long enough for us to really see this at scale. But one of my predictions and like I think a pretty popular prediction is that some L2s are just going to trend to zero activity over time. Would it ever make sense to like wind down a deployment or. It's like once you're there, it's just like, you know, it just runs itself.
00:54:10.625 - 00:54:54.661, Speaker B: Yeah. So like I think from our point of view, Alwyn and I both come from a trading background, so we always think in terms of like, what's the worst thing that could happen? You know, that's the sort of thing people say. But with us we really think about what's the worst thing that could happen. So you're like, well, chain could close down, bridge could get hacked, stuff could go wrong if it's not maintained anymore, like it would start to fail to produce blocks, whatever it is. Right. Like you could have all these different issues happen. So I think if we didn't believe in anything in something anymore and we start to see an issue with a chain, it's not worth leaving that risk open ended.
00:54:54.661 - 00:55:10.875, Speaker B: You'd probably just say, okay, like we'll try and migrate the users we have there to a different chain. We'll give them options. You know, we'll try and do the right thing by everyone. But like you don't leave risk open if you don't have to. Yeah.
00:55:11.215 - 00:55:42.805, Speaker C: And I guess in the spirit of further predictions, I'm sure you guys internally have your own roadmap. What areas of the protocol and edge you guys want to advance. But to start like on a more general landscape, we talked about all of these different styles of perps markets. Where do you see things kind of trending towards across the ecosystem in the perp space?
00:55:46.505 - 00:56:22.989, Speaker B: Kind of interesting, right? Because like when I got more heavily involved like three years ago, the whole matter was around sort of defi and innovation and it was quite technical. You know, people are reading white papers and looking at things but you know, as time's gone by, like the market's oriented more towards this sort of financial nihilism, the kind of meme coin thing. And so, you know, like, I think one of the things you can see we're all wrestling with it to some extent.
00:56:23.037 - 00:56:23.221, Speaker A: Right.
00:56:23.253 - 00:56:51.525, Speaker B: Is how do you get a faster deployment deployment of long tail assets? Because those assets are what users really want to trade on with leverage. So you know, Hyperlip would have their hlp. You know, they have an internal. I don't know, it's a team or whatever. But you know, it's like a little mini hedge fund that trades on the platform and makes markets. That's their way of getting liquidity for these things. DYDX is trying to emulate that with a Megavolt.
00:56:51.525 - 00:57:39.711, Speaker B: I think we'll probably have some kind of pool product that like leverages price feeds to give people quicker access to some of these markets. You know, you look at products like Pump Fun, they've really like simplified both the launch and the trading of these things. I wonder if that continues until we start to see a real turnaround in alts. Because we just had this like two tier market, right, where BTC and ETH have done pretty well from the lows, have sort of recovered and then ETH less so obviously. But then you've got the like long tail of alts where none of them has really done that. Well. I think mostly it's a liquidity issue.
00:57:39.711 - 00:57:57.571, Speaker B: You know, three years ago the people that are now trading memes were trading alts. They would come in and investigate and read white papers and now they're like, well, I don't need to read anything. I just like the picture of the hippo. I'm going to buy that. Right? Fair enough. Like fair enough. It's fun.
00:57:57.571 - 00:58:11.495, Speaker B: Why not? Made you laugh. You put some money on it, it made some money. Okay, great. Now you feel good. It does leave alts in this sort of weird middle ground where you're saying like okay, well where does the market go from here?
00:58:13.995 - 00:58:59.315, Speaker C: So do you guys internally feel pressure to list the longer tail stuff? Are there products where. One thing I've thought about is perps have turned up the like leverage knob. Like you can go to certain venues and get like a thousand x leverage or something crazy and that fuels the degenerate. The degenerate, like the person who would really enjoy meme coins. Have you guys thought at all about like the way the perps product could evolve to give those like crazy returns? Would you guys ever implement a thousand x leverage or some crazy stuff?
00:59:01.655 - 00:59:52.531, Speaker B: So we have a product we're working on which without going into all the details could theoretically accommodate like a thousand x leverage. I think personally I have a little bit of a problem with 1000x leverage because it's essentially saying to people like oh no, 99.99% of the time you are going to lose all your money, which is a horrible product in a lot of ways because you make choices about what you put out there. But I think there's always going to be those products. People are going to do it. I mean anyone that starts to offer thousand X on meme coins, I will laugh to see it. But at the moment we just sort of focused on giving the people what they want.
00:59:52.531 - 01:00:03.105, Speaker B: So that means like slightly higher leverage, you know, 50 to 100x on BTC and ETH, more tail assets. See what we got from that.
01:00:03.445 - 01:00:38.355, Speaker C: There's also been other platforms that have leaned into, well, I mean Vertex and Edge specifically. You guys do spot trading. So there's like more advanced kind of stuff traders can do. With the access to Spot, it is almost like you're, you know, building toward a little bit beyond perps and more towards like a kind of defi hub or the super app terminology that, you know, some protocols use. Are you guys like, is that what you're looking to build or are there other products that you're looking to bake in?
01:00:38.975 - 01:01:17.255, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we're almost there, to be honest. Like this last product that we've got in mind, it solves two things. One is it enables higher leverage, but it also enables like a yield product. People want a kind of passive income type product that they can put their money in and see what happens. I think once we have that, we're pretty product complete. And like, it's nice for me when I hear from users how they're using the platform without me feeling that we've told them, you know. So like one of the common use cases, we have quite a large borrow lend platform baked into the contracts.
01:01:17.255 - 01:02:05.855, Speaker B: You can borrow against your BTC or ETH or whatever, but then if stuff starts to get choppy previously, if you're on AAVE or something and the chain got congested, you're really worried that you're going to get liquidated. It's hard to pay back the loan or do whatever on Vertex because we have our own sequencer and everything. You just come, you press a button, you sell a perp against the loan you've taken and you hedged and you got like zero liquidation risk and you sleep at night, right? And like a number of users told me they use it, they say, oh no, I always borrow on Vertex way easier. I know I'm not going to get liquidated. I know how to risk manage it. That's nice, that's a Nice feeling to hear that from people. Or they leave a stop loss in, in the perp.
01:02:05.855 - 01:02:34.505, Speaker B: They don't have to worry, just say, okay, I'll just stop in the perp and I know I won't get stopped on my spot. Easy. So things like that are cool. I think it's a unique product we have in that sense, like other people don't have that capability and so I think it's more about expanding it and getting it to more users than it is about changing the product too much. Once we get this final leverage yield product in place.
01:02:37.365 - 01:02:42.013, Speaker C: Are you guys going to go mobile? Mobile ux, Mobile ui.
01:02:42.189 - 01:03:06.649, Speaker B: Yeah. So we have an optimized web app, pwa. It works pretty well and we're doing some more work on that to make it better. I think long term it would be great to have an app on the App Store. The DYDX one for me is like the gold standard. I think that's really great. It's just tough to get it done.
01:03:06.649 - 01:03:16.765, Speaker B: But yeah, like that's the kind of 2025 squad goal, like get a proper mobile app set up. Yeah.
01:03:17.345 - 01:03:26.005, Speaker C: And just blanked on the last question. Oh, the name. Where did the name for Vertex come from?
01:03:28.785 - 01:03:29.953, Speaker B: Was it the same name when you.
01:03:29.969 - 01:03:31.489, Speaker A: Guys are on Terra?
01:03:31.657 - 01:04:03.115, Speaker B: It was, yeah. We kind of capped it. I basically wrote out like 500 words over the course of about three days, just like trying to get to something, something I had like the sense of an exchange, something being connected, something being good. And like Vertex was the word that came out. I think at one point we were going to call it Monera. At one point we were going to call it or Moneta. Moneta, which is a horrible name, the awful name.
01:04:03.115 - 01:04:24.143, Speaker B: And then just funnily enough, it came up with the name, put it in a chat and do just came in and blessed it. I didn't even know he was in the chat was just like, guys, what do you think of this name? And do just came from our house. This is great. Use this. I was like, okay, done. Do likes it. It's great.
01:04:24.143 - 01:04:28.205, Speaker B: Good. Let's. Let's get on with it. So it was as much market testing as that.
01:04:30.025 - 01:04:32.233, Speaker A: Thorough process for coming up with a name.
01:04:32.369 - 01:05:01.841, Speaker B: 100%. 100%. I mean, if I'm honest, the name, I think the name's pretty good. I think we could have changed things a bit in terms of SEO or like making it a little bit simpler for people where, you know, you don't think. But what I've realized is like, we have a lot of users where English is second language and the word vertex is kind of an alien word to them. It's kind of an unusual niche word. Right.
01:05:01.841 - 01:05:10.845, Speaker B: There's things like that you don't think about when you start. You're a little bit ignorant. And I've learned, like, next time I'll probably try something a little bit different.
01:05:12.185 - 01:05:28.307, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, Makes sense. Darius, we're. We're about a time here, so we're going to wrap up. Not take too much of your time before we do. It's always good to get any closing remarks from you in case there's any calls to action. Anything you want to let our audience know.
01:05:28.307 - 01:05:30.055, Speaker A: Now would be a great time for that.
01:05:30.395 - 01:05:43.731, Speaker B: Yeah. Follow us on Twitter. Follow me on Twitter. I usually put bits and pieces out. Come and try us out if you haven't used us before. You know, try us on. Say we've got, like, rewards running there.
01:05:43.731 - 01:05:51.345, Speaker B: It's basically close to free to trade. And, yeah, anything interesting, like, ping us, we'd love to hear from you.
01:05:52.885 - 01:06:06.965, Speaker A: Nice. Great stuff. Thanks so much for joining us, man. This was a great time. Definitely learned a lot and a lot to look forward to. So that was episode 90 with Darius, and we will catch you guys next week.
