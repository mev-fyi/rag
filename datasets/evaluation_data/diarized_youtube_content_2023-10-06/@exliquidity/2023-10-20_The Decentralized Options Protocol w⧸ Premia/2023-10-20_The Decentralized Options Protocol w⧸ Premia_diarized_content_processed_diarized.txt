00:00:00.160 - 00:00:10.690, Speaker A: I see a world where we're doing cross exchange integrations, potentially. There's some interesting things that we're thinking about there, but bringing in multiple different inventory sources. So you can just come to us. We'll make sure you get the best price.
00:00:29.670 - 00:00:41.630, Speaker B: All right, good to go. Episode 35, we have on premium, cozy, and DK from premium. Appreciate you guys coming on.
00:00:41.970 - 00:00:43.274, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:00:43.442 - 00:00:46.830, Speaker C: Yeah, see you, Ali. Pleasure. Thanks for having us.
00:00:47.730 - 00:01:14.080, Speaker B: All right, we talked about it a bit, kind of like how we got started, the different camps and crypto as the space kind of developed. I wanted to ask, well, I want to hear from both of you guys, but we'll start with cozy on, like, your history in the space, kind of how you got started, how you got involved with premium and maybe toss in a few bits about some good moments of when you were exit liquidity.
00:01:16.660 - 00:02:20.090, Speaker C: Yeah. So I started working in crypto in, like, mid 17, 2017, working from, like, training desk to non custodial wallets, non custodial exchanges. And then that kind of led into DeFi with premia. I met DK and a couple of the other founding team members. While we were just kind of, like, volunteering and working as community members, contributing to a project in, like, 2019, late 2019, or early 2020. And throughout that time period, DK, Froggy, Lumio started talking about, I believe, futures products built off of Sushiswap. And from there, kind of led down the path of options, because there we were looking at, like, what kind of financial products don't exist at the moment.
00:02:20.090 - 00:02:51.040, Speaker C: And there was no options market for all coins. There was, like, hedgehog, and DK was open around, yet. Open may have been around, but there really wasn't much. So premium V one was a peer to peer options market that supported, I think, 17 of, like, the top altcoins at the time. So all, like, the Defi 1.0 stuff, sushi, uni urine, stuff like that. And I.
00:02:51.040 - 00:03:58.716, Speaker C: That was, like, a novel idea, but we kind of quickly realized that people don't know how to price options, and there was a request from the community to build something that would assist in doing that. And that kind of led to v two, which was the amm pool to peer path. It worked great for what it is. It's kind of. We think of it as, like, the beta two, v three, or premiable, but with premium v two, you could deposit into pools as an underwriter, and then you would be underwriting the options for the amm. What we had built with each of these, that was kind of unique, was there was a supply and demand pricing function tied to these pools. So if there were, there was high utilization rate or, you know, a lack of capital in any of the pools, then it would incentivize deposits by apologies, by over the market premiums, by charging more for people buying those options.
00:03:58.716 - 00:04:51.250, Speaker C: And then on the other end it would provide under the market premiums when there was an excess of liquidity to incentivize people to buy options. So there was this kind of equilibrium that took place to help fairly, quote unquote, price the options. It's great in theory, but it doesn't really give you any optionality, no pun intended. Um, you know, you can't uh, you can't choose ranges that you're, you have no choice in what you're underwriting. Um, so that like level of risk is fit for like defi degens and like, you know, retail that want to speculate. It's not really tailored to protel or market makers, institutions, uh, things like that. So there were a lot of requests when we were kind of marketing our product around for uh, to be able to deposit into ranges or be, to be able to underwrite, uh, ranges.
00:04:51.250 - 00:06:18.914, Speaker C: So that kind of sparked, you know, and led to v three. Oh, cool. Um, and in v three, um, you know, we've, we've kind of started from the ground up and built a fully functional like options exchange. So in v three, where v two was pooled up here and it was permissioned, like you couldn't add anything you wanted, there were certain restrictions that were on marketplaces and for the markets, uh, one of those being that they needed a chain link, Oracle. So that kind of limits you to what assets have kind of stood the test of time, have garnered enough liquidity and attention to be on x amount of exchanges have pretty high trading volume, which is great for users who are looking for assets that they are speculating will be around for a more significant amount of time. Usually assets that meet that criteria are of a certain class, you could kind of say, but what you miss is kind of like the attention catalyst and like base attention layer that forms around new assets or like their zero to one moment. And that's something that Uniswap, we think, brought to like all coin spot markets where it didn't exist before.
00:06:18.914 - 00:07:33.740, Speaker C: And I saw that kind of firsthand because I was working on the exchange side of things in my previous jobs when I was working on the more, quote unquote corporate, you could say, side of crypto stuff. And you understand and see the process that protocols and projects go through to get listed on the centralized exchanges and the loop. Not loopholes, but hurdles they have to go over and get through, as well as on the other end, what the exchanges or wallets, non custodial swaps, like what they're looking at in order to list these assets or to put pressure on the centralized exchange to list the assets because they have so much demand from their customers, which does happen. A lot of times there is influence from third party services because of demand. It's not just a protocol is paying a centralized exchange or something like that. So you see this need for listing and this kind of cumbersome process that used to happen. And with uniswap, they kind of removed all of that friction.
00:07:33.740 - 00:08:12.750, Speaker C: And it was like, if you have a project, you have an idea. I thought of it as the era of ideas, because if you had an idea, you created a token, you could launch it. And it was very simple. It's kind of like how. How like Soundcloud, like, you know, helped kill some of the music industry because artists were able to just independently put up their own music and they could, you know, get clout and kind of blow up on YouTube and Soundcloud and start their own careers. They didn't need to go and like whore themselves off to a record label right away and get a deal and then start getting promoted and be in debt. So, like, uniswap kind of did that for like tokens in a funny way.
00:08:12.750 - 00:09:52.000, Speaker C: So premium v three aimed to kind of do that for. Not only that, that's one of the things for options, because there was nowhere where you could permissionlessly deploy a new options market. And on top of that, if you're using something like premium v two, you're very limited to what you could underwrite out 90 days max and limited to your assets. So with v three yet fully parameterized, modular, from the base layer, base layer exchange, you could create a market for any asset that has a spot market and has an oracle of really any kind. We'll have a margin layer, and then we'll have a vault layer, premium v two you can kind of think of as just a vault. And in premium v three, given the base layer exchange that will be there, premium v two will be moved onto or on top of premium v three, and we'll call it underwriter vault. So if people are looking for kind of passive yield or to just passively underwrite options, they'll still have the option to do that just like they did in v two, but without, without the same level of risk, I guess you could say, because there's now competing inventory sources for pricing, which should keep pricing from falling too far on the outer bounds of either direction.
00:09:52.000 - 00:09:54.400, Speaker C: DK, you can go ahead and talk a bit.
00:09:55.670 - 00:10:19.718, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Just background on myself. I spent ten years out of college working at a bulge bracket bank on the broker dealer side. Spent time in multiple different countries, but during that time of the bulge bracket bank, spent some time on the listed derivative side sometime in. Majority of my time, actually in big data analytics. And then I've always been in the crypto space.
00:10:19.718 - 00:11:06.380, Speaker A: Used to make some videos right around early youth days. You know, the first video I ever made was right on the Dow hack. Sold way too early on the first bull run. You know, I thought a three X was nice with my, like, entry on all of my eth was $9, and then kind of left this, the space a little bit, because I'm sure, as everyone kind of understands, your brain kind of perceives a lost opportunity as, like, an actual loss of capital, right? So I left the crypto space for quite a bit, and then I spent some time in Europe. In Europe, I found myself up more time, got back to the crypto space pretty heavily. That rolled into Covid. I moved back to the States right before COVID And then prior to defi summer, I was getting in the nitty gritty.
00:11:06.380 - 00:11:40.420, Speaker A: I met cozy in the NFT project. They were speaking about, which we were all exit liquidity for. Even though it was an airdrop and we were the ones that were working on it, we were super bullish on ourselves. Our lead solidity engineer, when he entered the project, he didn't even get the airdrop, so he had to mark a buy in that marked pretty much the top of that market is when we had a lead solidity. Anyways, we were super bullish on ourselves. And then, yeah, one thing led to another. We were talking about sushi swap futures products, and then we're like, well, we can do options, probably better, especially all coin options.
00:11:40.420 - 00:12:03.088, Speaker A: And that weekend, we started drying up user stories. And then fast forward to February 2021. We launched MVP of peer to peer, found out no one else had a price options, pivoted to peer to pool in November of 2021, and we've been working on v three ever since. So we got here. That's how I met cozy. We're all airdrop. Airdrop winform channels.
00:12:03.184 - 00:12:06.100, Speaker C: You know, when Google form.
00:12:08.080 - 00:12:27.350, Speaker B: Cozy. Any moments other than one DK mentioned where you were. Exit liquidity. I also want to hear you guys seem a lot, you guys seem like you've been in the space for a while. I kind of want to hear the. Like, we haven't. Me and Ali have been in the space for what seems like a while, but in comparison, not as long.
00:12:27.350 - 00:12:41.046, Speaker B: And I'm kind of curious, like, I don't know what things were like back then, what kind of camps you guys were participating in, what the arguments on CT were just kind of some highlights that you kind of. That are stuck in your brain from.
00:12:41.078 - 00:12:45.414, Speaker A: Those moments and on ethos, for sure. I'll let you go first. Cozy.
00:12:45.582 - 00:12:53.204, Speaker C: What was the first, uh, question? Because I got kind of lost in the reminiscing when you start talking about. Let me hear about the old stuff.
00:12:53.252 - 00:12:55.108, Speaker B: Just some exit. Exit liquidity.
00:12:55.204 - 00:12:55.876, Speaker C: Liquidity?
00:12:55.988 - 00:12:56.364, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:56.412 - 00:13:32.530, Speaker C: Um, yeah. My. The exit liquidity moments I probably remember the most are from, uh. There was a small part of Defi summer after DSD and ESD where there were a lot of seniorage tokens that were being launched. And there were some really, really out there ideas, some that were tied to the price of gold or the golden ratio was being used. A lot of weird shit like that. I lost a bunch of money on the forks.
00:13:32.530 - 00:14:35.948, Speaker C: I did well on ESD. And then from DSD through a few forks of that, I lost a good amount of money. And other than that, I haven't really lost money in, you know, pools, making trades, anything like that. Because I've been pretty conservative after, you know, this past run up. I don't think very few people sold the exact top, but I got out pretty close to for a lot of my stuff and have been pretty selective on, like, what I've aped since then. I think preserving your capital is, like, the hardest part about trading, that a lot of people over trade and that's how they lose money. And when you kind of been around for a little bit, you understand that, like, there's a million opportunities, so there's no need to fomo into a missed opportunity.
00:14:35.948 - 00:15:07.260, Speaker C: You just can, you know, get back in the grind, get back in the trenches and find the next 1020, you know, even if it's just like a five. Like five x, you know, you're still outperforming, like every other market that exists. Um, so, like, you hit a few of those a year and you're pretty well off. Um, especially, like, in. In these types of markets. And when it's a bull market, then, you know, it's a different story. Like, you can just throw a dart at a ticker on the chart and, you know, not over trade and you're going to be fine as well.
00:15:07.260 - 00:15:43.888, Speaker C: So the other, the only other things that like, are stand out to me is in my very like early days, I got hacked and lost to like ten BTC. And this was like, before it really started to run up. So like, it didn't really eat me alive until it hit twenty k. And then I was like, oh my God, like, you know, I'm so stupid for doing that. And it was an electrum hack. Like, there were, you know, back then it was like all proof of work coins. And there weren't a lot of, there just weren't like alts, like there are now.
00:15:43.888 - 00:16:21.600, Speaker C: Nothing was, there weren't tokens that were launching on Ethereum. It was just like a ton of proof of work tokens. So every alt was running some, like some algorithm that they were saying was like the new, like fastest or the, the highest security or something like that. And uh, there was just a lot, a lot of spec mining. So like the, I think the two groups back then were bitcoiners and just shitcoiners. Um, you're either bitcoin, Maxi, or you're a shitcoiner. And uh, until the first bitcoin fork happened, well, maybe before that.
00:16:21.600 - 00:16:36.040, Speaker C: Um, but then there was kind of like two bitcoin camps. So there were only two. You're a bitcoiner or shitcoiner. And then it went into like, you are a big blocker or a small blocker. Bitcoin. Bitcoiner or you're a shitcoiner.
00:16:38.500 - 00:16:41.116, Speaker B: What games were were you in at the time?
00:16:41.228 - 00:17:07.898, Speaker C: I was always a shitcoiner. I was like an early miner. I still have like some decommissioned rigs downstairs. So a lot of the people that I met kind of early on were from, you know, like the shitcoin camp and were spec miners. Not so fast. Was like one of the earlier guys I remember talking to. But yeah, times were much different because things weren't easy.
00:17:07.898 - 00:18:12.730, Speaker C: Like, the UX was really, really bad. So if you wanted to be involved, you know, you kind of had to put some effort in. And my contrarian take is that, that's good. Like, you know, we should. I don't think that like, having ux that's up to par with web two stuff is always a good thing because there's inherent risks with, there's inherent risk that people aren't accustomed to, right? Like, everyone should be used to controlling their own money and to like, being in charge of their own things. But we've all been so conditioned to give up control of everything that we, like, think that it's difficult or we make excuses for, like, why we shouldn't or why it's okay to trust other people. But I think history has shown, like, time and time again that, like, you shouldn't trust anyone that, you know, even the best people in your life, like, sometimes do you wrong and, like, it's up to you whether or not you, for a given, forget or, like, you're bitter and you hold a grudge, but, you know, everyone's human, and humans make mistakes and learn from them or don't.
00:18:12.730 - 00:18:56.040, Speaker C: So, yeah, it's always been, like, a core ethos of mine to not trust anyone, make them prove they're trustworthy and make them earn respect through proof of work and reputation and things like that. So, yeah, times are much different now because I think of the Ux improvements and obviously, like, the amount that the space has grown and, like, you know, we've grown into building products that are more aligned with traditional web, two products, social media, apps, things like that. But, yeah, I don't know. It's a double edged sword.
00:18:58.110 - 00:18:58.558, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:18:58.614 - 00:19:07.250, Speaker C: We build products for everyone. So, like, you know, we focus on ux at premium, but, you know, I have my own takes about how I want to use things.
00:19:08.150 - 00:19:16.490, Speaker D: A little bit of a getting into some, like, morality there as well as, as much as I would like this to be like a philosophy podcast, we don't, we don't get enough of that.
00:19:18.110 - 00:19:20.918, Speaker C: We'll do it on the back end. We'll go back to that later.
00:19:20.974 - 00:19:33.270, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that'll be part two. DK, what about you, man? What was your, like, early day? What did your earlier days look like? What did you, where did you find yourself coming back to time and time again?
00:19:35.570 - 00:20:21.176, Speaker A: Gem hunting. No, I mean, I spent, like, when I was in Europe, I spent three years in Europe, and that's when I, like, really dove back into things. Like, I'd never been on four chan before. And that's like, when I dove back into, like, you know, dove into biz for, like, the first time. And I think Biz is all noise now. But back in 2016 time, you know, there was a lot of Alpha and Biz, even though the market was, you know, maybe, excuse me, 2020 ish, 2019, maybe there's a lot of alpha there. Not so much anymore, but, yeah, started building out, like, you know, Twitter, Twitter followers that had, that always constantly had Alpha.
00:20:21.176 - 00:20:41.780, Speaker A: There was obviously biz left. Reddit. I hate Reddit now. I'm not a fan of Reddit. I feel like a lot of the a lot of the signal is lost in Reddit as well. But, yeah, I was just constantly chasing stuff. I was looking at what makes sense to me from a technology perspective and doing insanely deep fundamental analysis on those.
00:20:41.780 - 00:21:15.518, Speaker A: There were a bunch that I had picked back then, and then during the Bull run, you know, we're rewarded with, and then, you know, you kind of, you transfer into capital preservation, similar to cozy. But one thing that always kind of resonated was, like, the premium, we call it privacy forward. But like, the, some of the, like, anon, anon based ethos, that was always something that was like, you know, big within our crew. And I know at the time, especially during Defi summer, it was, you know, back and forth between if you were doxxed or not.
00:21:15.574 - 00:21:20.158, Speaker C: And then, like, stuff like the faces versus the masks.
00:21:20.294 - 00:22:15.796, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And sushi didn't quite help in that regard, but, yeah, that's always been something that's kind of stuck with us. And that's where a lot of our crew that we initially, you know, met online that, you know, we, we, that are, like, close friends in the space still to this day are all, you know, similar. When we started premium back in the day, the founding members had never had maybe spoken on the phone to each other like, I don't know, less than a dozen times and never met in person. Obviously, it's changed a lot now. We've been building in the space for quite some time, but it was just, that's the way it was back then. And like, my first, I don't give too much away, my first web3 call was with people that were also very prominent in the anon space of a project that was massive during Defi summer.
00:22:15.796 - 00:22:52.888, Speaker A: And they all joined, we joined in, like, some weird, anonymous chinese video chat room, and they all had, like, scary face dangers on, yeah, scary faces and voice modulators and stuff. And I'm like, is this what, is this what Defi is like? Is it all like this? It's not, but still, it was, I mean, it was funny and intimidating, but also kind of exciting. But, yeah, that's where I started. Now I'm like, you know, I'm pretty open about what my portfolio is. It's premium Ethereum. I'm a boomer now. I don't really have the time to do all that gem hunting anymore.
00:22:52.888 - 00:23:02.040, Speaker A: I don't really have the time to spend in that fundamental analysis anymore, unfortunately. Uh, but those times were fun for sure.
00:23:02.540 - 00:23:09.948, Speaker B: Is that renowns? Um, I wanted to ask you a bit about that. It sounded like, you were leading in. Into that.
00:23:10.044 - 00:23:28.080, Speaker A: I mean, I can lead into it. So, yeah, so our, like, um. Maybe it's real, maybe it's not. I, you know, I can't confirm or deny, but, um. Yes, so, powered by anons, uh, or three anons, which. Power by anons. Like, more like the dev side of things in three nons, more of the venture capital side of things.
00:23:28.080 - 00:23:55.440, Speaker A: However, I mean, there's more than three and ons, but it's still funny because three and on capital. It was three ac at the time. Three arrows still existed back then, so we placed some better bets than they did, I guess. But, yeah, it was just a group that we had operated out of. Sometimes investment comes out of that entity, but it started as a meme, but we've been building on it ever since.
00:23:56.600 - 00:24:39.770, Speaker C: Yeah, it originally was, you know, talking about, like, early groups, like, in when defi, like, 1.0 kind of rolled around. My, some of my closer friends from the 2017, like, run and era were, like, icebergy carbon based screen times. Some other, you know, some of those guys on Twitter, stoic, savage, top tick. And we all stayed pretty close, like, through the bear market. So when Defi summer came around, we were all kind of, like, dming each other individually about things. And then me, carbon, and icebergy created a group of the three of us, and I think we called it, like, the honest farmers union.
00:24:39.770 - 00:25:44.312, Speaker C: And it was just, like, a way for the three of us to kind of share, like, the things that the gems we were finding and, like, projects we were looking at together. And then when three ac kind of came around, we knew that they weren't copy trading us, but it almost seemed like they were because we were really early to all the NFT stuff. And a lot of the projects ended up picking up on the defi side of things we were. Earlier on, I made the three anons account originally just to make memes about, like, how we were better traders than them. And after, like, a couple days of it being live, someone wrote an article saying that, like, a new fund popped on the scene, like, investing in risky things. So we, like, you know, quickly came up with a banner and a website and, like, threw it up to, like, make it more real. And then, like, you know, we started getting, like, offers and stuff, and people knew that we, like, operate out of that, like, meet.
00:25:44.312 - 00:26:22.950, Speaker C: The only rule is that there is, like, there needs to be a group of three. So. So, yeah, there's, you know, like, groups of. There's more than three anons that are there it's just like we have kind of kept it to where there's like, you know, I think nine, maybe. Yeah. But like DK said, like investments started coming out of it because people knew that who was kind of involved in it and that we had been doing like angel things on the side. So it just made sense for us to kind of collectively look through things and deploy capital.
00:26:24.650 - 00:26:43.650, Speaker B: Yeah, we have to talk about Premier. Last thing before we get there is you. I think this is just popped up on your Twitter for Eden Aet X. Not sure what that is, but it looks really interesting, so I thought I'd ask.
00:26:46.390 - 00:27:20.764, Speaker C: Dope. Yeah, so I think similar to how you guys started exit liquidity. So something me and DK are starting up that'll be kind of a daily, like new show or cover macro stuff, things happening in crypto. If people want to join us, have desk, have guests, come on. But keep it pretty informal. Obviously going over formal information, but keep it pretty informal and chat. Because just like you guys were like, there's not enough people that are kind of covering what's happening day to day in crypto.
00:27:20.764 - 00:27:36.170, Speaker C: What new shit coins are getting a lot of attention. And it won't be any type of charting or shitcoin shilling, but just talking about where kind of the attention is shifting daily in the crypto space.
00:27:37.790 - 00:27:58.396, Speaker B: Yeah, that's awesome. It definitely feels like none of the media is like, represents Ct at all. That's kind of our understanding of the stuff you'll see on YouTube with like, like the people enter this space and the first person they'll see is like bit boy or something. And like, that's just the, that's just not CT.
00:27:58.468 - 00:28:02.460, Speaker C: So moon, Carl, bitboy, crypto, stuff like that.
00:28:02.500 - 00:28:04.796, Speaker A: All coin daily or whatever. Yeah, yeah.
00:28:04.868 - 00:28:42.640, Speaker C: All that kind of shit like that all exists and like, uh. Yeah, I mean, you guys already know because you're doing the same thing. Like, you know, there's just not enough people that are out there kind of talking about where the actual attention in crypto is at. You have news outlets that will write articles on it, but you know, they're, they're pretty biased and they're biased in a way that's usually because of money that's been put towards them or lack of on the ground information that you kind of get when you're actively involved in the space.
00:28:44.100 - 00:29:20.760, Speaker D: I feel like that kind of speaks to what you said earlier about good ux not necessarily being a prerequisite or it's the same concept. Whereas if you get into crypto and you're presented with all that stuff. You kind of have to. You have to have the wherewithal and the drive to be able to dig deeper, to, like, actually get past it to a point where you can figure out what's going on and, like, really be a part of the community. I mean, I feel like that's what a lot of us went through when we first got into it, and I think it was. It was valuable in the wrong in the long run, even if it was, like, even if it was tough at first.
00:29:21.260 - 00:30:10.320, Speaker C: Yeah, I've talked about this on a stream in the past, but I got added to this group chat of, like, older guys in my city. They're all a bunch of business owners that are into crypto, and a guy who I used to talk with who was in that group added me to it. He's like, I. You know, I know everything that you do, and, like, you know, I think you'd be an asset here. And what amazes me is, you know, when there's a lot of money at stake and you want a piece of that, people will, like, they won't learn the how, you know, everything or the why everything you know is doing what it does, but they will quickly learn how to go from point a to point d and get back. These guys were. They were on BSC.
00:30:10.320 - 00:31:10.124, Speaker C: They were pancakeswap, like, you know, kings, and we're farming the shit out of, like, you know, every, like, shitcoin ponzi that, like, I'd ever heard of on BSC. Like, things I had never. I had no idea existed. Like, these guys were. Were in, like, making killings on, and, you know, it opened up my eyes to, like, you know, this, I don't know, contrarian idea that, like, you know, we all want good ux, because I think as a user, like, you know, you want a smooth, good looking app that, like, you know, just works like butter, because that's what we're used to now. We're used to apps that are made by huge corporations and Macs that have insanely powerful hardware inside of them, and everything just fucking is like butter now. So when you get something that doesn't work like that, you start getting frustrated and anxious.
00:31:10.124 - 00:31:23.300, Speaker C: So we want that. Yeah. The, like, ux hurdle, I think, because it makes you, like, have to learn or have to want it. You know, it's not always a bad thing.
00:31:26.400 - 00:32:03.220, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, it's. Well said. Cool. So getting into premia, v one was peer to peer, v two, peer to pool, and v three hybrid. I'm wondering if, like, throughout the years throughout that process, there were any particular, like, innovations that you guys saw in the option space or just the broader, like, defi space that you found a little bit more compelling that may have, like, snuck its into the premium infrastructure. Was there anything in specific that jumped out throughout the development process?
00:32:04.050 - 00:32:05.590, Speaker C: Uniswap? V three.
00:32:06.370 - 00:32:09.430, Speaker D: Yeah, it's kind of a layup. I was hoping for that one.
00:32:09.930 - 00:32:10.754, Speaker C: DK.
00:32:10.922 - 00:32:45.286, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's a lot of stuff that we brought back in v three that existed in v one. We're just, I guess we're like, too early for the market. Plus there are some, there are some constraints in the infrastructure side. Like, we launched v one before, like, L2s were a thing, right? And so, like, we got the run up on gas and, like, to cancel an open order was going to cost you like $80 to $100 in Ethereum gas fees. And, like, that's nothing sustainable. Right. Like, especially if you were trading in less than, like $30,000 an option size, then, like, it made no sense to even put up an order if you're going to have to change it the next day because a little bit of volatility.
00:32:45.286 - 00:33:11.306, Speaker A: Right. And so there are quite a few infrastructure issues, like account abstraction didn't exist. Obviously, L2s didn't exist. So the cost of gas was extremely high. We were constantly running up into, like, contract size limits. And at the time, there wasn't really, like, an elegant way to expand that contract size. That was near the beginning of proxies to begin with.
00:33:11.306 - 00:33:39.268, Speaker A: So there's been a lot of development on the technology side that maybe users don't see. So a lot of things that we're bringing back is like, our referrals we're bringing back, we're bringing back. So, like, we had OTC. Our peer to peer was OTC. It was straight OTC. You put up your order, you either could, you could minute beforehand and put it up, or you could mint on demand match.
00:33:39.364 - 00:33:39.572, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:39.596 - 00:34:17.688, Speaker A: So if someone came in and bought your option, then we actually had unlocked, you had already approved your wallet's ability to spend, right. So if someone matched order, then it would actually, you know, it would actually take the coins from that individual's wallet. Right. Which was like an early form of kind of what account abstraction was, but it still was like an odd user experience. Do the mint from. Right. It's kind of, we pretty much took a lot of the Opensea design mechanisms of how filling an order in Opensea kind of works and how we performed our OTC but yeah, in terms of like, super low cost chains in the technology space, arbitrum Nova.
00:34:17.688 - 00:34:48.074, Speaker A: So our order book lives in Arbitrum Nova. And to this day, I'm pretty sure we're still the only one that's even plans on doing an on chain order book. All the other options exchange are typically off chain, so ours is on chain. However, we bring in the hybrid approach of APIs to connect. So if you're a programmatic trader, we can still have the order book on chain. You can check to see that you're not being censored, you can check to see that you're not being front run. However, we'll cover all the costs for you because it's insanely cheap to cover on Operation Nova.
00:34:48.074 - 00:35:33.026, Speaker A: But at the same time, if you just want to build a bot that lives on a server that you host, then easy peasy for you to do that. We brought in a lot of the developer tooling, because developer tooling has come a long way. And I think that also the pure decentralization Maxi ethos has fallen by the wayside a little bit. I think people are willing to do trade offs, especially when it's their capital that's up for grabs, right? So if you launch a permissionless, you know, contract and it can't be upgraded and your capital is in there, then if there's a hacker screw, right? So you can't really, you can't do upgrades. You can't, you know, there's. There's ways that you can do it. I.
00:35:33.026 - 00:36:14.704, Speaker A: Our engineers are kind of. Of the opinion that, you know, upgradability might be the future. You just have to do it in a way that is, you're the protecting yourself from like, any sort of not short sightedness, but like, especially in the opset world, right? So, like, exposing a private key, if you could, if you could upgrade a smart contract and it's one of your dev wallets, and they lose their private key, then you know that the smart contract can get rigged. So as long as you're putting like, time locks in place or governance control in place, I think the upgradeability will continue to live. That's the path that we're kind of taking. And, yeah, we took out all these feature sets. We have, we've grown the team, right? So when we started, we're at four, and now we're roughly 25 full time.
00:36:14.704 - 00:37:04.726, Speaker A: So our research group, which is, you know, is quite an asset for us. They've been able to, like, iterate and, and test out new ideas and stuff over the course. Of, you know, the almost two years now at this point. And kind of see like what are the trade offs? We've been having a lot of like discovery with different types of users, right? So like V two is, is predominantly a retail only platform because you cannot really parameterize options that you're selling, right. And so we needed, that was like one of the biggest ticket items in B three is like you have to fully parameterize. But we don't want to lose the amm elements, right. So we need to have a composable, we need to have a composable a product that allows you to trade order book, but then also trade versus an amm, right.
00:37:04.726 - 00:37:42.620, Speaker A: And so we built that. And then we needed to take into account, like if you're only trading in Darabit, what's going to make someone come over from Derevet, right? Like it's one thing if we try to inform and educate people that are already doing defi perps, right? That's, that's a user group. That is, I would say is a, has relative level of complexity or financial literacy. They understand the products. Maybe they haven't moved over because, you know, the one click buy is so simple. So we're doing a lot in education side of things on, you know, to bring over people from the perp world. But then also, like you got the main market share is dare bit.
00:37:42.620 - 00:38:43.074, Speaker A: We have to bring over people from dare bit. How do you do that? Well, derivatives traders are extremely sensitive to pricing and fees, right? And so whereas someone that's trading swaps on uniswap or through an aggregator like one inch or defi llama, that might not be so sensitive to fees on derivatives trading, where there's a lot more activity on the, you know, both ways, especially if you're not buying and then holding until expiration, but you're actually trading in out of these positions multiple times during the lifecycle, then a small difference in fees can actually play a massive amount into the p and l of that position. And so derivative traders, you're always competing on fees, right. And so that's one thing that kind of came to the forefront as we started to finalize the fee structure. And so we matched airbit on pretty much everything. There's a slightest, there's a slight difference in that we don't charge any maker fees and derivate, charge a little bit of a maker fee. And then our, if you take our maker plus our taker is the same as derabits.
00:38:43.074 - 00:39:07.850, Speaker A: Right. And then the only exception is on our exercise. So on our exercise, our fees are, you know, a little bit higher, actually. I mean, a decent amount higher than a darabit. But if you're not holding to expiration, then that's not going to affect you. And the reason that we do that is because for our amm to be composable when, wherever that option settles at the very end, needs to have the exact same fee structure. There's different ways that we can incentivize users to come over.
00:39:07.850 - 00:39:53.616, Speaker A: The referrals are going to have rebates. So essentially anything that you route over to our platform, you get a portion of the taker fees and you can use that to refer yourself as well. Then also we have some token components on the utility side, whereas if you are staking a certain amount of tokens, then you also have a drastic fee reduction. So there's, there's a lot of ways that we are even more competitive than Darabit. I think the technology stack is there now that it, you know, it that you can get the economies of scale that you get with dare bit and you get with like having API programmatic, you know, no cost cancel and corrects. We can do that on chain now. And so they have the next, you know, six months for us.
00:39:53.616 - 00:40:16.348, Speaker A: That's what it looks like. It looks like scaling up, getting flow to move over from a centralized exchange to decentralized exchange, and then working on the margin elements. Right? Because like the isolated margin, are specs fully done? It's just a matter of coding that up. We're going to knock on wood. We'll have that done before the end of the year. Our spreads is already done. We'll probably have spreads which will reduce the amount of margin that's needed within the system.
00:40:16.348 - 00:41:08.880, Speaker A: We should have that by beginning of October and then portfolio margin, which is like the holy grail on options. We're expecting in Q one, that one's going to take a little bit more. We need to battle test some of the isolated margin components first before we move over to portfolio margin, and then kind of build out the products, the fixed income products that play into isolated margin and get people comfortable for that and make sure that we have appropriate lending, whether it be warehouse lending or we work with other protocols to get exposure and get people to lend into our pools. There's a little bit of business upkeep that we need to do business development than we need to do before we can really turn on margin lending or, excuse me, cross margin or portfolio margin. Yeah, there's technology. The change in technology is really what got us here.
00:41:09.780 - 00:41:44.380, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's definitely apparent when you really look at where you guys have been and what you're building now. So, so far, you've alluded to the order book on Arbitrum Nova, as well as the vaults you guys have earlier. I would like to get, like, a quick explanation of range orders as well for the people. I think that's, in my opinion, that's like, the most interesting component besides, like, the fact that they all work together so well. Yeah. Can you explain a little bit how those range orders work and why that's so exciting?
00:41:44.540 - 00:42:11.810, Speaker A: Yeah. So, taking a step back, we built it in a layered fashion. The entire exchange is built in a layered fashion. So we have the base layer, which is the exchange layer, where all options are fully collateralized. So we don't, you know, there's no situations in which that a position can't settle or a person, you know, we have bad debt that gets accrued. Base layer always fully collateralized. What's plugged into there is that's where everything that's been matched is cleared and settled.
00:42:11.810 - 00:42:40.524, Speaker A: Then we have amms, which work on top of that. Then I'll circle back to amms in a second with range orders. Then we have the vault layer, which plays on top of that, where we bring in the ivault surface from mature exchange. Like dare bit. We model it, we price it for users. If you want to deposit in a vault and you want to passively collect yield in that circumstance, you can deposit in a vault. They'll take in the parameters that's brought on chain.
00:42:40.524 - 00:43:09.980, Speaker A: They'll price those options and sell them for you. Those are the underwriting vaults. So that's the same experience that you have in v two right now. Whereas it's a pool to peer model. And then we have the RFQ and the OTC order book, the stuff that's hybrid off chain and on chain, that's abstracted away as we allow you to connect to it in a web two fashion. However, from the matching and settlement and clearing, it all happens on the web3 layer at the base level. So circling back to amms.
00:43:09.980 - 00:43:52.264, Speaker A: So in a traditional amm, right, for Uniswap, you have asset a, let's say Ethereum, asset b, let's say USDC. And as those trade, the ratio of those two assets kind of moves around. In ours, you have the collateral asset, and then you have short options. Right? So let's say in our example, we are going to deposit just Ethereum into a. Let's say you have to pick the series. So, let's say August 31, expiration 2000, call Ethereum pool. And so you're saying while depositing that liquidity, you're like, I will underwrite options.
00:43:52.264 - 00:44:25.618, Speaker A: So if people want to come in and buy call options, I'll underwrite them. So if they come in and they buy one ETH worth of a call option, they now have a long call option. And that ETH gets converted from collateral into a short call option. So you get this ratio of the short call options in the pool versus the collateral that has not been utilized yet. Once it's utilized, it transforms into a short call option. And so there are going to be scenarios in which that may be, initially, that first person that came in and bought, they bought it for, let's say, the premium cost of 0.1, Ethan.
00:44:25.618 - 00:44:53.810, Speaker A: And then if there's more buyers than sellers, then when I deposited my collateral, I said, I will underwrite between this range, let's say between 0.1 ETH and 0.2 ETH. By the time it hits 0.2 eth of a market price on the premium, I want to be fully allocated. So that's what the range order means is. So, so if, let's say that I had only written, let's say I had, I don't know, ten eth I put in that pool, right? So the first one goes to 0.1,
00:44:53.810 - 00:45:22.540, Speaker A: and then it's the. The range will slightly move over. The next one will be slightly more expensive all the way till we get to 0.2, where all ten of my ETH are now fully collateral or fully are sold. And I now, technically in the pool is ten short call options. Whereas the person that came and bought them their long call options. Now, let's say that volatility moves and people decide to start selling those options back, right? And so at that point, what happens is they'll sell that long call option back into the pool.
00:45:22.540 - 00:45:43.936, Speaker A: We will then close out the short apps, we'll pair it down versus a short option, and then that will unlock the collateral on the pool. So now I have nine short options, short call options, and one eth of collateral. And so it goes all the way back. Let's say there's nine more cells. And now we're back at the starting point, where I have ten eth of collateral in the pool. The price is back at 0.1 eth.
00:45:43.936 - 00:46:08.772, Speaker A: However, I collected fees from 20 different trades there, right? All the buys and all the sells, right? And so that's where it's like an actual amm, that, like, that hasn't really existed before. Right. So that range liquidity of what that, of what you're doing is saying, I'm willing to write within these two ranges. I want to be fully allocated when it hits this point. You can do full range, right. But you just won't be able to create as many trades in that range. Right.
00:46:08.772 - 00:46:47.712, Speaker A: So if you're, if you're, if you want to optimize and you want to say, I don't really actually want to hold any short call options at the end of this, really looking to just buy and sell options, why it's in this range. And then ultimately hopefully the price comes back to where I deposited at and then I can exit with all my collateral plus all the fees that I collected. Right. So you're kind of incentivized to keep your range in a tighter area if, you know, if you want to fully allocate, collect all the fees in those 20 trades. If you were to do something more wide, then someone else could come in and because it's similar to the Uniswap design that it will stack on top of each other, someone else could come in and say, I'm going to write between 0.1 and .2 and you're now writing between 0.1
00:46:47.712 - 00:47:07.638, Speaker A: and five. So like they're going to get all that trading volume, right. I'm not going to get a lot of that trading volume. And so that's where the concentrated liquidity comes in. It's something that we spent quite a while getting tick sizes correct. And then it's not as easy as just like looking at a useful contract because we have an entirely different dimension, which is time. Right.
00:47:07.638 - 00:47:35.566, Speaker A: We have to have the expiration, which is not something that's in a uniswap pool. Right. There is no expiration. It's just always a ratio of, you know, of one to the other, whereas ours, we have to, we have to manage that time element as well. So yeah, we're happy, we're excited about it. The permissionless pooling, we think that, you know, you have to have permissionless pulling to really scale up in this space. There's so much volume that happens in the altcoin arena and I, there's no one really utilizing, like, no one's really tapped into that yet.
00:47:35.566 - 00:48:25.040, Speaker A: Right. So we have to be able to, to scale that up. So you just, you bring an oracle, you either provide yourself, you use a chainlink oracle, which we're completely support, completely out of the gate Uniswap v three, we decided to not support fully out of the gate, even though we do have an adapter, especially since we're on arbitrum. There are some like fundamental arbitram specific items that make it, I wouldn't say like risky per se, but not up to our standards. So we're going to kind of wait for Uniswap V four to come out for us to do Uniswap based oracles. However, we partnered with Redstone, which is a oracle competitor to Chainlink, and so that we can spin up some of these prices that may not exist on arbitrary in a quicker fashion if they don't necessarily meet the standards for a Chainlink oracle. So there's a lot of different ways that you can build markets out.
00:48:25.040 - 00:48:34.760, Speaker A: Yeah, that's going to be ready the first week of September when we go live. Referrals will be ready that week. It'll be exciting to see.
00:48:35.660 - 00:49:41.800, Speaker C: I think one cool thing that may have gotten lost in there is on premia natively will support for permissionless pooling with the caveat that it has a Redstone or a chain link oracle. But there's an adapter, an oracle adapter to where if you're using, I don't know, let's say we don't have pith natively supported or something. You have a pith oracle, or you've created your own oracle for like an index that you have, you can create your own markets and still deploy those. And because of us using arbitrum Nova, all of your orders are going to be displayed for you to be able to pull and index yourself. You could create your own native order book that only display the orders for the assets that you have through the Oracle adapter that you've created. You can create token lists. So, like, I don't know if you're a Dao, like a developer Dao, and you have a lot of projects that are kind of built within your group and you want to have an options market for those.
00:49:41.800 - 00:50:21.510, Speaker C: You have your own bespoke oracle for those assets. You can do that. You can set up your oracle adapter to, to work with the markets, spin up markets for all those assets on a spot exchange, and plug that all in and then create that natively to where you have a token list. And anyone with that token list can come onto premia, import the list, and it will show all of your markets for all of your assets, very similar to Uniswap, and how you can go on there and import a token list and see a bunch of new markets that maybe Uniswap has either chosen to delist or just are not supported because of how new they are.
00:50:24.650 - 00:50:56.460, Speaker D: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, definitely a lot to potentially dissect there. I think that the prospect of having a concentrated liquidity amm for something other than spot assets is like, I don't know that we've seen that yet. I think this would be the first one, not to mention the. Also the first protocol to have an integrated order book using arbitrum Nova. So I think the possibilities are pretty exciting.
00:50:56.460 - 00:51:37.570, Speaker D: I also want to touch base on the token a little bit, or at least the changes going into v three for those unfamiliar. V three, I believe, is shifting from a normal standard liquidity mining model to an options liquidity mining model. Can you talk a little bit about what the thought process was behind that choice? And if you guys looked at, I think there's maybe one or two tokens live right now that have an options liquidity mining model. So I'm wondering if there was anything super compelling you saw there that led to this decision.
00:51:39.450 - 00:52:41.842, Speaker C: To be honest, we thought about this a couple of years ago, but the issue was that premia didn't have a chainlink Oracle. So we couldn't really issue options for premia in the fashion we wanted to, as well as v two wasn't really designed for that because you could issue them, but with the way the model was, you may be paying significantly more because of liquidity available, uh, than other people at, like, the time of, uh, exorcism. Um, so it was kind of necessary for us to have v three to be able to do option liquidity mining the way that we had, we had envisioned. Um, yeah, there are a few other models that are a bit different that exist. I know Andre Cronje had a write up on an o token model, and I'm not sure if tapioca based theirs off of that. But tapioca has, like, o tokens and an option liquidity mining model. There's timeless.
00:52:41.842 - 00:53:28.850, Speaker C: Timeless has, like, o lit tokens. I know theirs aren't, like, true options, but it's still, like the same concept. They may have been the first ones to do an option liquidity mining concept. So if they are props to them and then bond protocol, they were something that kind of came out of Olympus dow. I know they're doing option liquidity mining as well. So, yeah, I mean, I personally think that it is one way to maybe address, I don't know, the common path for traditional liquidity mining, which is like, people race to take advantage of high py and free tokens. And like they're just trading it back to the base asset.
00:53:28.850 - 00:54:06.360, Speaker C: They started with either ETh or USDC and it's just free money to them, or they think, quote unquote risk free money for them. So one way to kind of curb that is by adding different variables. And one of those is, you know, something, options provides time and set price, a cost to capital, things like that. And so I think, like, the model we have now is kind of a culmination of learnings over the last like few years.
00:54:07.780 - 00:54:47.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll add on that. So, yeah, options have been something we've been looking at for a while. Like we're an options platform, we should have options, liquidity mining. But there were a few things that both the community had brought up and then some things that we wanted to solve as, as developers as well. Right? And so one of the biggest things community always brings up is the dilution, right? So if I'm currently holding the token, then why, like, you know, these liquidity providers are getting it for free and then I'm fully deluded on it. There's, you know, there's not enough being made in the protocol fees to cover, you know, me locking up for a certain period of time. And so we solve that.
00:54:47.374 - 00:55:14.010, Speaker A: Bye. Implementing a physically settled model. So our peer to our peer to peer model in v one was a physically settled model. What that means is that at exercise, if you choose, if you choose to exercise, then you actually swap assets. So it's not cash settled. So in that circumstance of where I had one ETH and a strike of 2000 USDC, you would give me one ETH, I would give you 2000 USDC. Right.
00:55:14.010 - 00:55:58.700, Speaker A: It wouldn't be a cash settled difference between the price of, you know, between the price of 2000 USDC and whatever the current market price is. Right. So that physically settled option, what we do is we, if you are a liquidity provider, and also we felt like our V three model has a lot more in terms of returns for liquidity providers than our, maybe our V two model had been modeled out for. Right. So we feel like we don't need to do as much on the, you know, giving tokens away at zero cost. So what we've decided to do is we give you a at the money, or it's deep in the money, actually 50%. The current trading price of the asset is what your strike is.
00:55:58.700 - 00:56:30.652, Speaker A: Then at 30 days, you can choose to exercise or not. And if you choose to exercise, then you'll say, for example, and the circumstance of where Ethereum is 2000, you would pay 1000. That 1000 goes directly to premium stakers. So that dilution is then split evenly with the premium stakers. We solve that problem then. Also one thing that sets us apart from the others is that we're going to have a secondary market. Obviously we'll have premium tokens and we set certain parameters for what makes sense for us in our liquidity mining.
00:56:30.652 - 00:57:06.722, Speaker A: But we built a completely modular fashion and we can spin one of these up for anyone else in almost zero time, less than a week. Now we just got to make sure that there's a proper oracle for you. Other than that, we built in a modular way. You can choose the fees to go wherever you want, you can go to your stakers, you can go to the dow. There's a bunch of different protocols that have tons of their native token and they don't really know how to create yield on that. Two ways within our system can do that is you can sell cover calls on the amm or you can implement a liquidity mining system in which you're collecting uh, the, the exercise cost on these options. Right.
00:57:06.722 - 00:57:33.472, Speaker A: And so we also have a secondary market. Right. So during the period between um, the date that they're written and ours are set for 30 days and the 30 day sell expiration, you can trade these, you know, you can maybe, let's say I just want to get rid of them at $0.10 on the dollar and have someone else, uh, take over the obligation. Awesome. You can do that. Um, you know, it adds in a, some interesting game theory dynamics, um, of having this option that's already like deep in the money.
00:57:33.472 - 00:58:16.060, Speaker A: But then maybe you don't want to spend additional capital, right, to actually purchase these. And you know, maybe you just, you know, you're not liquid on USDC and so, you know, you sell them, you sell them for a cheaper cost to someone else. Or maybe, you know, it could be a native premade user that's just trying to get tokens at a cheaper price. So there's, there's those elements of things. Um, and yeah, like I said, it's super easy for us to spin these up for other groups and so I am, knock on wood. This is one of our first offerings in the protocol to protocol space and it's not going to be the last, that's for sure. We want other protocols that were in situations that's similar to ours in the past of what do I do with all these native tokens? I got to cover Opex.
00:58:16.060 - 00:58:41.992, Speaker A: How do I do that? How do I generate yield on the tokens that I have or how do I, you know, do this without just negatively dumping it in an amm? Right. Which is the worst option out of all the different options. So it's a better, it's a better solution than that. We think a lot of people take it up. We have a few people that have reached out to us and we're excited. We're excited about that as well. We spend a lot of time with our community.
00:58:41.992 - 00:59:15.980, Speaker A: So we have, in our governance process, we have a group of ten elected members called parliament and we spent pretty much one of the tokenomics revisions that they wanted to address between pretty much April until August was this liquidity mining incentive. And how does it actually bring more of a fundamental return to current token holders? Why does it make sense to lock up for four years? Well, in the past it was less of a reason. And going forward there's definitely more of a fundamental reason.
00:59:18.810 - 00:59:57.920, Speaker D: Awesome. Yeah, you can definitely just. The community bit you mentioned there, I think you can definitely like see that in the discord and on Twitter. People in the premier community are like very much in the premier community, which is like a very difficult thing to cultivate, I think, or at least it seems to be based off of how uncommon it is. Definitely props for that. I have like one more larger question and then I want to give you guys a second in case there's, in case there's anything we missed that you might want to get into or any call to action you have. So just taking a step back a bit.
00:59:57.920 - 01:00:44.830, Speaker D: In our past episodes with other projects, we've talked a lot about the trade offs between order books and amms. So like had like drift or Oxperp on who were very much in favor of a hybrid model, or we had a ore on who was very, very much in favor of a pure order book. And then, you know, you've. Historically, amms have been the more prevalent model, especially in the option space. I'm wondering like what issues you guys have faced in the past, given that you had both approaches and kind of like how you struck a balance between the two and why you think that it's like the best of both worlds without really too much of a sacrifice.
01:00:47.010 - 01:01:56.390, Speaker C: In like the simplest terms or thinkings. I think like amms allow tokens to kind of have their zero to one moment and have fine price. Discovery and order books are better fit for mature markets. You usually find that pricing becomes pretty centralized in regards to depth on order books around, especially for options around specific strikes. And amms allow you to have a much wider range. So I think choosing a hybrid model, at least for options, you know, I can't speak on like perp and spot markets, but makes more sense because you're able to, you know, for this, provide markets to a plethora of different user types. If you're a user that does not know how to price options, and you just need a venue to price for you, you have the amen that you can buy from that will source you the best price for that option that's available.
01:01:56.390 - 01:02:21.690, Speaker C: And if you're someone that's building a more complex strategy, and you're looking for specific option types, then you're able to go into the order book and pick the options that you want to build out, the strategy that you're trying to trade or build in your portfolio. So that's why I think in very simple terms, like, why a hybrid model for us works the best dk you can go into, you know, whatever, however you feel on it.
01:02:22.590 - 01:03:34.622, Speaker A: I mean, if it's composable, then I think that the hybrid makes the most sense. Right? So, professional or people that know how to price options correctly, or maybe more on the programmatic side, are going to want an order book because it gives them a little bit more flexibility, especially if they can, you know, cancel and correct at a relatively cheap to zero cost, right? And in our model, I think that we allow up to like a million at the cost of like $20 a month, because we have like some API credentialing. But the fact that ours is composable, the way that it looks on the front end is we actually bring in all three inventory sources. So we have an inventory source of the AMM, we have an inventory source of what the vault is willing to underwrite at. And remember, the vault is essentially an algorithmic strategy, taking in multiple different variables, bring them on chain, and then we'll look at utilization of the MM as well as what the current price of that risk is. And it will give you a quote, but it's restricted to maybe certain products, certain series. It's not going to write you a 90 day call.
01:03:34.622 - 01:04:12.074, Speaker A: It's only going to write. These are parameters you can set too. If anyone else wants to spin up the fault, let's say that an iv of 45 and expiration of 30. And so, like, there's only certain, and only for Ethan Robbit coin, right? So there's only certain things that will actually underwrite for. And then the third one is order book, right? So if someone already has a resting limit order. What happens is when you come to our site, if you were to go put those parameters in, I want to buy an ethereum call quoted in us dollars. I want to buy one ethereum of an off of a call option.
01:04:12.074 - 01:04:52.954, Speaker A: We will then bring those three different order or inventory sources to you and then showcase to you which one is the cheaper one. Where we took inspiration is from the aggregators. You go to one inch or defi, the llama swap, you put in a price that will tell you okay, these are the seven quotes that you're getting. You pick the cheapest one, it's sorted by the cheapest one. You click on that, you submit the order, you get the cheapest price, right? So ours is similar, whereas you have those multiple different inventory sources and it's, you know, it's able to expand out to different inventory sources. I see a world where we're doing cross exchange integrations potentially. There's some interesting things that we're thinking about there, but bringing in multiple different inventory sources.
01:04:52.954 - 01:05:48.520, Speaker A: So you can just come to us, we'll make sure you get the best price. And you know it's, if it's highly liquid then you know, there's probably, there might be something on there. But if it's more of a liquid product then there's going to be people competing for that, right? And as more groups or professional market makers kind of onboard onto our platform and just cross exchange between a dare bit and a premium, for example, you're going to see those spreads come down, the depth of liquidity go a lot deeper too, right? So you get the benefits of decentralization. However, you might have to pay a little bit more of a spread on the price compared to the deribit. But you also, you get some, you get some, I don't know the right word but there's some trade offs obviously in the price, but you get some security in knowing that everything is fully collateralized at the base layer. You don't have any real counterparty risk advantages.
01:05:49.660 - 01:06:20.630, Speaker D: Right, right. Yeah, I think I'm definitely more like in the hybrid camp myself as well, for a lot of the reasons you just stated, which I think is also why premium blue has been an interest of mine. I know we're over here so we can start to wrap up. I just wanted to give you guys a second in case there's anything you want to promote, anything you think that the users should know, anything we might have missed, whatever.
01:06:23.860 - 01:06:42.760, Speaker C: I think one thing I'd like to highlight is just that if options are something that's new to you or you've been intimidated to get your feet wet in. We have an academy. It's completely the DK. The training competition test isn't up anymore, right?
01:06:43.700 - 01:06:44.364, Speaker A: Correct.
01:06:44.492 - 01:07:15.064, Speaker C: All right, so it's completely platform agnostic. So if you know premium isn't your platform of choice, it's not a problem. Or if you're wanting to go use like Lara, for instance, fine. Hopefully you come back to premium, but you can go there and learn the basics of options through more complex strategies. And Marty, some people know him on Twitter. He's in the process of putting together a kind of masterclass that will go up there as well. They're really easy to read through.
01:07:15.064 - 01:07:54.330, Speaker C: There's little quizzes at the end of every course that you can take to kind of test your knowledge. So it's a great way to kind of start learning the basics of options, start getting the hang of the tournamentology and feeling comfortable with the things that you're looking at. If you're looking at any ivil charts, you're looking at velodata or coin metrics or something. But yeah, so there's the academy. And then I think everyone has been asking, like when, when, when premium blue audits have been complete. So we'll be releasing it very, very soon.
01:07:57.870 - 01:07:59.090, Speaker A: Two weeks. Tm.
01:07:59.750 - 01:08:02.110, Speaker D: It's always soon. It's always two weeks.
01:08:02.270 - 01:08:18.360, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I want to reiterate, the academy, like, 90% of defi based academies is just like a blog article. Ours is definitely different than that. We have, every course is made up of five different classes. Every class has a quiz. At the very end of the course, you have an exam.
01:08:18.360 - 01:09:01.004, Speaker A: If you complete that, you get an NFT. The NFT is going to be integrated into the platform for certain cosmetic based improvements, especially when it comes to referral addresses and sharing that. And so, like, we encourage everyone to do it. Like you said, we have options 101 to learning the greeks, to something of a more advanced strategy, like a bull call spread or something. Right. And those spreads will be available on our platform, knock on wood, in roughly six weeks from now. So encourage you to go learn.
01:09:01.004 - 01:09:30.560, Speaker A: Like, like Cozy said, it's platform agnostic. Look, we're just trying to educate people. We think that most people in the crypto space, especially if you're already using a L2, like from a technical perspective, you definitely, you definitely can learn options. I think that most people think it's more of like a speculative asset when we're trying to kind of break down that barrier and demystify that it's not necessarily only for speculative use cases. You know, you can lock in profits. You know, you can. There's a bunch of different things that you can do in an actual hedging environment that is not just speculative in nature.
01:09:30.560 - 01:10:09.624, Speaker A: And we've been also trying to bring a lot more awareness to volatility in general. Volatility as a concept, which I think that most people know that crypto is a volatile asset. What does volatility mean? They have no idea. We're trying to bring that to the forefront. I think that the next major run up, I think, is when options will have its renaissance moment, its Robinhood moment of crypto. And so we're just trying to get everyone educated in that space. And the example I like to do is, you know, between us and the competitors, we're not trying to, you know, take, you know, we're trying to bake bigger pies instead of gaining more of the same, you know, the same existing, existing pie.
01:10:09.624 - 01:10:14.460, Speaker A: So that's that. Take an academy course. You'll enjoy it.
01:10:15.080 - 01:10:30.796, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Plus one to that. I haven't gone through the courses myself too deeply, but just from the skimming I've done, it's definitely, like, the way that I learned options was just, like, scraping through investopedia and, like, you know.
01:10:30.828 - 01:10:32.460, Speaker C: Many separate resources I could find.
01:10:32.540 - 01:10:43.960, Speaker D: Yeah. And it's like, it's not a. It's not a fun or necessarily, like, friendly process. So the fact that you guys have, like, packaged it in a way that is, is really good to see.
01:10:44.620 - 01:11:50.020, Speaker C: That was the thing in the, like, kind of earlier days in our discord. You know, people would come and asking questions about options, and it was a lot of the, like, early community just sharing, like, invest, investopedia articles and, you know, videos from YouTube. So it was like, why? When you think about ux, right. Like, as a builder, like, I know I said earlier, my contrary, an opinion about, like, for crypto, rough ux is sometimes, like, a good ux, but when you think about a product for a user and their user experience, when they're there, having all of that there for them so they don't have to leave to go anywhere else, is what everyone should be thinking. What will my user need to redirect for? And how do I make them not have to do that? Trying to encapsulate everything they need to do on premiere, they're on premium for them. Um, is, uh, I don't know, kind of the. The angle that we're going for.
01:11:54.600 - 01:12:03.020, Speaker D: Great stuff. Yeah, I think that's a. I think that's a good spot to wrap up, Cedaw, unless you had anything you wanted to touch base on.
01:12:03.880 - 01:12:16.920, Speaker B: No, I think that's everything. I appreciate you guys for. For coming on. Um, and that is episode 35. Thanks for everyone who tuned in and watched. Bye.
