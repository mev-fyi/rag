00:00:48.805 - 00:01:01.285, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Exit Liquidity. Episode can't page fast enough. 89, I think.
00:01:01.325 - 00:01:03.545, Speaker B: 88. No, 89.
00:01:06.365 - 00:01:11.545, Speaker A: Okay, 89. Almost at 100. We're getting there.
00:01:13.565 - 00:01:17.545, Speaker B: You think we would have made it? You think we would have guessed we would make it to 100?
00:01:18.485 - 00:01:21.957, Speaker A: I mean, we wanted it to be around Devcon, right? But then, like, we would.
00:01:21.981 - 00:01:49.645, Speaker B: Yeah, I know, but I'm talking about, like, at the start Start, because I remember we would always talk about most. Most podcasts don't get to, like, 20 episodes. And I remember we. We, like, not celebrated, but we sort of celebrated getting to 20. Yeah, it's like a milestone. It's pretty wild. Like, this podcast is.
00:01:49.645 - 00:02:00.345, Speaker B: You know, it's opened a lot of doors for us. I don't know if the audience realizes that. I don't think I would have stayed in Crypto if we didn't do this.
00:02:01.125 - 00:02:01.865, Speaker A: Really?
00:02:02.205 - 00:02:05.905, Speaker B: I don't think I could have made it, dude. I don't think so.
00:02:06.685 - 00:02:30.525, Speaker A: Damn. Well, you did. No reason to wonder about what if. Yeah, it's pretty funny. Sometimes when I meet new people or someone introduces me to someone, even outside of Exit Liquidity stuff, they introduce me and, like, I'm sure this happens to you too. They introduce us as, like, co founders of Exit Liquidity. It's like one.
00:02:30.525 - 00:02:35.037, Speaker A: They don't mention any other past experience. That's the only thing. And I love that, honestly.
00:02:35.101 - 00:02:35.745, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:37.805 - 00:02:38.357, Speaker A: It'S pretty.
00:02:38.421 - 00:02:39.225, Speaker B: Pretty cool.
00:02:39.645 - 00:02:48.117, Speaker A: Yeah. What was the. So we did a solo back. We mostly just talked about Pump Fun garbage, I feel like. And, like, how did we.
00:02:48.141 - 00:02:49.785, Speaker B: What was the last thing we talked about?
00:02:50.315 - 00:02:56.775, Speaker A: I think so the episode. I don't remember what we talked about, but the episode's titled, like, Ethereum and Pump Fund or something like that.
00:02:59.995 - 00:03:08.615, Speaker B: What's your give? The. How are you feeling? How do you feel about Crypto right now?
00:03:09.475 - 00:03:13.775, Speaker A: I feel about. I feel pretty good.
00:03:15.565 - 00:03:17.825, Speaker B: Like, aside from price action, like.
00:03:19.565 - 00:04:10.979, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so I guess, like, a lot of it is affected by my, like, personal situation. And even though I plan to take time off for, like, most of the summer, like, it was totally way worse for price swings when you're, like, living off of your portfolio. Because when things are bad, it's like the whole, like, you know, the whole world is ending and, like, you're super, super just, like, nihilistic about everything. Now that I have, like, a job, it's a lot easier to be okay with that stuff. Especially, like, when you spend most of your day working on, like, actual products. It makes it A lot easier to ignore. Most of the stuff that like, previously would have made me more.
00:04:10.979 - 00:04:51.461, Speaker A: Made me more pessimistic about things, but overall I feel pretty good. Like it was a pretty boring summer. We had like a fun last, like week, maybe two weeks, something like that, up until, up until things turn around a little bit. But I feel like most people were in the camp of like, it's going to be a boring summer. Kind of just, you know, don't spend too much time on any charts and come back in October and things will be good. And October hasn't started great, obviously, but, you know, things can only be boring for so long. I mean, we've been ranging forever now.
00:04:51.461 - 00:04:57.021, Speaker A: It feels like, yeah, I've.
00:04:57.173 - 00:05:18.195, Speaker B: I've. I've begun to just not even care about price. That's. I've had a job and doing, doing exit liquidity stuff, which has not been great for my P and L. I do think I'm underperforming. I think I'm underperforming. I don't even know if I'm underperforming eth in total, but I think I'm.
00:05:18.195 - 00:05:56.995, Speaker B: That's, that's, that's like impossible to do. But I'm. I think I'm teetering on underperforming Bitcoin. So I don't know. I've come to realize I'm not a great trader. And my best bet is to surround myself with people that are better traders, people that are smarter than me via this podcast and try and try and snag some decent wins every now and then. But nowadays I think my focus has really been trying to build cool, like make cool content, don't really care about price action.
00:05:56.995 - 00:07:15.607, Speaker B: There still isn't any app that excites me enough besides like maybe like Poly Market. That's really it. I think I was thinking about this recently, but I feel like the people that were building things during the bear were doing a very good job of like preparing themselves and preparing their protocols for this like, up cycle. Some of the bigger projects are like, you know, getting to the point where they're actually going to have to ship a product. But I was thinking more recently, especially for how we think about like new guests and stuff and trying to find like, interesting protocols, which there is like simply a giant lack of that. I wonder where I should be looking for that newer stuff and those newer builders. It feels like most new builders and newer protocols have like gotten the attention they deserve, maybe more than they deserve and are getting to their kind of launch date, like There is the, like.
00:07:15.607 - 00:07:35.311, Speaker B: You know, there was the whole, like, Olympus Dow ecosystem crew that. I can hear your. I can hear each breath that you take right now. I think your mic, he's like, unplugging or something. I don't know. But I. I think.
00:07:35.311 - 00:07:44.841, Speaker B: I think, like, each. The. The. The bear chain. Older defi. Ohm. Fork guys have.
00:07:44.841 - 00:08:17.235, Speaker B: You know, those builders have come and they're building their great protocols, and Sammy is building his shit. Smokey and that crew are building their shit, and there's some defi people that are building in that ecosystem, and they're getting to the launch day. That cohort, I feel like, is graduating, basically. And then there. There's like, the Solana cohort that I feel like is. Is. Is going as well.
00:08:17.235 - 00:08:51.409, Speaker B: Thank them. I mean, I. I'm not gonna act like I was aware of the Judo cohort or, like. But I feel like that generation of builders have, like, reached their. I don't want to say highest form of potential, but, like, reach their launch points, their launch dates. And I feel like my most. The most interesting times are watching those very early on and watching those builders come out of the ashes of another ecosystem and build something successful.
00:08:51.409 - 00:09:48.675, Speaker B: Like, you see, with Zon and initiative coming from the lunar ecosystem, the thing that I'm curious about is, like, I feel like there isn't. I can't find the next cohort. Like, I don't know where to find that next cohort of, like, very strong builders who, you know, worked on something else and now have this very interesting new idea that they're. They're building towards. And, yeah, that's the area that I think I'm really looking for. I'm not looking for another or I'm not getting excited about another perp stacks on another L1 or an L2. I don't really care about how many times people are looping some type of stable coin or something.
00:09:48.675 - 00:10:16.051, Speaker B: I don't know. Maybe this is it. Maybe this was, like, the last moment for interesting protocols or interesting new builders. But what I've been thinking about more recently is where to find that next cohort of very strong builders who aren't just looking to raise $5 million and making a fork of an app on a different chain, but.
00:10:16.083 - 00:10:30.291, Speaker A: Well, I guess you have to think about how to find them, necessarily, because if you think about the last one. Well, no, I mean, like. Like who? Like, how would you know one if you spotted one? In my mind, what you're talking about.
00:10:30.403 - 00:11:16.301, Speaker B: Is I spotted one who. I think the guys who are Doing doxa are pretty cool. It's like a different take on prediction market stuff. Those guys feel like pretty young, smart people that are trying to solve something that is a tough problem and it's not being tackled in the same way by a lot of people. They aren't just going to throw leverage on prediction markets. They're trying to offer a different solution. And it's just a feeling like you find these guys and sounds kind of whack, but it is just.
00:11:16.373 - 00:11:45.157, Speaker A: I think you can find them intentionally though too, because what you're talking about essentially is the examples you're referring to is people who worked on other stuff in the past that it wasn't worked on other stuff necessarily a failure, but, like, they worked on something novel in the past that was like us. It was a success in the sense that it was like a good learning experience for them.
00:11:45.261 - 00:12:19.845, Speaker B: So, like, where's the guy that created Abacus Man? Like, I feel like that co. That cohort. If. If that dude makes another protocol, like, you know, it's going to be a difficult problem that he's going to try and solve for. And he is not just looking to fork something on L2. And his Twitter isn't just crowded with meme coins during his free time. He's actually focused on building like a strong new type of dap or solution for something.
00:12:20.585 - 00:12:26.857, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's what you have to look for. When I say that worked in some way in the past and people who are working on stuff.
00:12:26.881 - 00:12:29.655, Speaker B: Does anyone come to your mind that that excites you?
00:12:30.755 - 00:12:49.683, Speaker A: Not anyone we don't already know. So like, so, like, Sammy is a good example because redacted, like, I mean, they were good at what they did, but it wasn't super scalable. It was. It didn't really find fit at scale. And now they're doing something that's. That's more scalable. If you go.
00:12:49.683 - 00:12:55.585, Speaker A: You would have to go back and look at this. What do you mean the story's over? It just launched.
00:12:55.665 - 00:13:01.073, Speaker B: Like, when you're reading a book, you can tell us the last chapter of the book. There's still more pages, but it's obvious it's the last chapter.
00:13:01.129 - 00:13:04.521, Speaker A: Nah. No way. I mean, we don't know what's going to happen with Dinero.
00:13:04.713 - 00:13:08.153, Speaker B: It's just institutional LSTs, right?
00:13:08.209 - 00:13:15.325, Speaker A: So if it blows, I mean, it's cool. It's 20 billion TVL. That's not. Then that would certainly be another few pages, I think.
00:13:15.745 - 00:13:20.613, Speaker B: Yes, it would be. It would be another few pages, but there wouldn't be a whole new chapter for it.
00:13:20.769 - 00:13:38.429, Speaker A: Beyond this, they totally could. Dinero is something completely different. A year ago, Daenery was a stable coin. Like, who knows what can happen in a year, in a couple years. I can't think of any other examples off the top of my head though. Really?
00:13:38.477 - 00:13:39.265, Speaker B: That's it.
00:13:40.085 - 00:14:10.485, Speaker A: I'm sure there are more. I'm sure there are more. He's the easy one. His, his case is the easiest one to point to, I think, because it was like the most clear and we literally like talked about it. But maybe it makes sense to look in other ecosystems, like to look into people building on Sui or. There's a lot of, there's a lot of failed Solana projects that are building new stuff now. Not anyone I'm necessarily willing to take a chance on.
00:14:10.485 - 00:14:46.365, Speaker A: But like Solend wasn't a failure, but it wasn't special by any means. And now they have Sweeland and they made save and like the meme coin shorting thing, there was Mango markets, which obviously the whole thing happened with them. Now they're building a Jupiter competitor. I think in Solana you would probably find some good examples. The problem is, I feel like project development infrastructure. I think infrastructural improvements move pretty fast on Salana relative to Ethereum. I mean, everything moves fast relative Salon.
00:14:46.405 - 00:14:49.785, Speaker B: Is probably the price going up. Moves a lot faster.
00:14:50.155 - 00:14:52.643, Speaker A: Yeah. No, but the actual infrastructure too.
00:14:52.699 - 00:14:53.523, Speaker B: Solana makes it.
00:14:53.579 - 00:14:56.355, Speaker A: Yeah, but the projects don't move that fast.
00:14:56.395 - 00:15:25.065, Speaker B: I don't think Salana could be interesting. I think you're right. Any other L1 or alt L1, you're just going to see a whole phase of, hey, we need a perp sticks on monad. Hey, we need a liquidity lending protocol on monad and we need it on say, and we need it on SWE and we need it on aptos. We need it on all these places. There's no, there's no evolution for any of this stuff.
00:15:31.245 - 00:15:43.293, Speaker A: Aerodrome, that's a good example. Even though I don't think that success is going to last. And like, it's pretty much just driven by coinbase because, like, velodrome metrics have been like, down.
00:15:43.349 - 00:15:57.683, Speaker B: That was such a. You were so right about that. You were so right about that play that or you talked about it so much that I, I, I don't want to say I'm disappointed that you didn't capitalize off.
00:15:57.739 - 00:16:02.435, Speaker A: No, I didn't mean. But like, I never bought the token. Not one thesis.
00:16:02.555 - 00:16:08.655, Speaker B: Yeah, the thesis that you had was so Pinpoint. I'm pretty sure there's an episode with you talking about it.
00:16:08.955 - 00:16:14.855, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, since before they launched too. I remember when they announced. I, like, sent it to you. I was like, this is.
00:16:15.035 - 00:16:16.167, Speaker B: It was simple.
00:16:16.351 - 00:16:18.195, Speaker A: It was just like Coinbase.
00:16:18.895 - 00:16:20.715, Speaker B: Yeah. It was so simple.
00:16:21.815 - 00:16:22.635, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:24.055 - 00:16:26.823, Speaker B: But is that exciting, though? Like, are you getting.
00:16:26.879 - 00:16:29.959, Speaker A: No, because it's. Because it's not a new product. Like, it's.
00:16:30.007 - 00:16:30.727, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:30.911 - 00:16:41.593, Speaker A: The only reason it is what it is is because it's on base. Coinbase is pushing it and there's the whole, like, base normie thesis, which is, like, honestly pretty weak right now.
00:16:41.759 - 00:16:42.545, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:43.325 - 00:16:49.665, Speaker A: But it's still. I mean, metrics still look great, so it's like 5x TBL and velodrome by now.
00:16:50.085 - 00:16:57.145, Speaker B: Did you see the whole, like, Vermilion and Lady Eco, like, pissed at him because he pissed at Jesse because he, like.
00:16:57.965 - 00:16:58.773, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:16:58.909 - 00:17:00.625, Speaker B: Retardio out of their.
00:17:01.085 - 00:17:15.115, Speaker A: No, I don't think it was that. I think someone. Someone, like, made a joke about killing someone. It was like, very clearly a joke too. It wasn't like, it was not something that could have been misconstrued. And they, like, banned him.
00:17:17.655 - 00:17:39.197, Speaker B: Yeah, that was pretty funny. Yeah. I mean, I still want. I mean, like, look at this. Like, even when I look at the group chat we have, you have this little perpetual friends group chat. The people that are in there, like, I just want to be like, what are again? Armchair developer. 100%.
00:17:39.197 - 00:17:49.021, Speaker B: It's just like, can somebody make something cool? Like, please someone make something cool that isn't anywhere else.
00:17:49.213 - 00:17:54.749, Speaker A: We've already talked to everyone who's made something cool. There's no one left. We did.
00:17:54.837 - 00:18:20.025, Speaker B: Full lap, please. And the thing is, it was funny because you started this thing of, like, we're going to run out of interesting people to talk to. And I was in complete denials. Like, nah, this ecosystem is huge. Like, there's no way we actually run out of people. And like, these days, it's just impossible to find something that isn't just mid.
00:18:20.645 - 00:18:40.783, Speaker A: I don't think we've run out necessarily. I mean, we definitely have blind spots. We definitely have blind spots. And there's just, like, in the AI, in some spaces, like the AI space specifically, there's like, too much noise for me. There's too much. Yeah, it's too theoretical. There's too much noise.
00:18:40.783 - 00:18:47.235, Speaker A: And like, I. I can't evaluate that stuff. I think I, like, most people are larping.
00:18:47.855 - 00:18:55.159, Speaker B: I like Tao. But why. Why do I use Claude and chatgpt? Why isn't there a Solution there I.
00:18:55.167 - 00:18:59.021, Speaker A: Like probably is virtual reasons. It has nothing to do with AI.
00:18:59.183 - 00:19:34.107, Speaker B: I know, but like that's what I mean about like the whole AI sector. It's like, yeah, this is going to change this, just going to change that. But I'm, I'm as, I'm the, I'm probably the most like prime consumer for these like AI apps and I don't use them, nobody uses them. So I like the AI space theoretically. But it's just, that's all it is, it's all theoretical, it's. It's nothing. And then people have been talking about like, I mean the Wayfinder shit is kind of cool.
00:19:34.107 - 00:19:35.411, Speaker B: Have you been seeing that?
00:19:35.603 - 00:19:37.095, Speaker A: No, I don't know what that is.
00:19:37.595 - 00:19:45.695, Speaker B: It's like the. Do you know like the Slate Spice guys trying to make it is like a chat bot for executing transactions.
00:19:46.075 - 00:19:48.015, Speaker A: Just like an AI interface.
00:19:48.355 - 00:19:49.855, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually pretty good.
00:19:50.395 - 00:19:53.105, Speaker A: I mean from the demo. Are you going to use that?
00:19:53.235 - 00:19:54.117, Speaker B: I'm not going to use it.
00:19:54.181 - 00:19:54.677, Speaker A: Use that.
00:19:54.741 - 00:20:44.085, Speaker B: I'm not going to use it. I think at most I could see a world where like if you had like a Robin Hood mobile UX and you're like, you know, it's one margin account, you're doing lending on one protocol, doing you know, trading delta neutral or like arbing funding rate on a perps protocol on one side. And then like an AI makes a suggestion like, hey, like you could get, you know, kind of like when you're driving on Google Maps is like, hey, there's a roadblock ahead. Like go this way and you get like two minutes saved and you can decide if you want to change your route or not. That's the only thing I think I would actually do for the AI stuff is like if I'm. If the AI could recognize that my wallet is already doing a certain type of activity, if they can find me, yield, that's more advantageous and like explain the risks to me. And then one button to like execute that.
00:20:44.085 - 00:20:55.835, Speaker B: I think that makes sense. But I'm not gonna wake up and instead of clicking metamask, I'm gonna click Wayfinder and type in a chatbot. Hey, send $5 to Ollie. Like I'm not doing that.
00:20:57.735 - 00:21:05.395, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty specific. It's pretty like, I think it'd still be a while before that stuff is actually like useful.
00:21:06.375 - 00:21:24.465, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, it was sad that I was talking about today. Payments are still like mid. Like we can't even pay people. We have to pay people. I mean we had to, we had to Fold to the tri gods.
00:21:24.585 - 00:21:25.905, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:21:26.065 - 00:21:28.445, Speaker B: For the most simple use case in the world.
00:21:29.425 - 00:22:06.621, Speaker A: Well, I mean, post the blocking, the blockage there is regulatory. That's the problem. Like if somebody, if somebody like paying a crypto user is easier than it has ever been like there. And it's never really been that bad. The thing is, is like, it's like if you want to pay someone who uses crypto and you're also a crypto user, you can do it easier than you could with literally anything else. But if you want to go outside of our ecosystem, you quite literally have to chew glass to get there.
00:22:06.653 - 00:22:06.893, Speaker B: It's.
00:22:06.949 - 00:22:12.669, Speaker A: It's the worst, like the worst experience ever had with any product ever.
00:22:12.837 - 00:22:19.637, Speaker B: And you know, it feels whack. No one's trying to get around it. I mean, I'm not gonna. I think just because it's like long enough.
00:22:19.821 - 00:22:22.349, Speaker A: I think that's just because of regulatory stuff.
00:22:22.517 - 00:22:30.253, Speaker B: Yeah. Back. Back in my day, people were willing to go to jail for a good D5 protocol or a good or good DAP man.
00:22:30.429 - 00:22:35.305, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. That's true. I guess people are more scared now.
00:22:35.765 - 00:22:42.825, Speaker B: I guess so. But like, then they'll still do this. Well, shady with their token and then act like nothing.
00:22:44.005 - 00:22:54.265, Speaker A: I think it's because you have to like, you have to like. Well, I don't know. I mean like, just getting into a bank is. Is difficult to do. I think that's the biggest thing.
00:22:55.895 - 00:22:56.415, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:56.495 - 00:22:56.943, Speaker A: Like, you can.
00:22:56.959 - 00:22:59.835, Speaker B: You can probably end up being like made by usdt.
00:23:00.815 - 00:23:03.959, Speaker A: Somebody's got him in usdc. Apparently.
00:23:04.127 - 00:23:19.919, Speaker B: You're right. The regulatory rails. The regulatory rails are the biggest problem. And the people who have been. Or the ories that have been embedded in those the most as of late have been. Or like since. Not as of late.
00:23:19.919 - 00:23:26.365, Speaker B: Since the dawn of crypto has been usdt. It may be usdc.
00:23:27.625 - 00:23:41.325, Speaker A: USDC has apparently good rails already, but it's expensive. As far as I know. It's like 80amonth. And I'm pretty sure you still have to go through like an anal cavity search of a KYC to get there.
00:23:42.825 - 00:23:56.935, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. Seems. But yeah, this. This is basically the introduction. This 20 minutes is please give us somebody build something.
00:23:57.595 - 00:23:59.275, Speaker A: I need somebody to go live.
00:23:59.355 - 00:23:59.891, Speaker B: Dude.
00:24:00.003 - 00:24:02.855, Speaker A: I feel like there would be so many Ponzi's on op Net.
00:24:03.555 - 00:24:19.075, Speaker B: Yeah, that'll be fun. But it's still gonna be just for like. I really like the Joey's analogy on like car enthusiasts. Like current, like DEFI enthusiasts are really going to enjoy OPPNET I don't think anyone else will.
00:24:19.815 - 00:24:37.835, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, that's fine. Like as long as I have somewhere to to dick around. That's, that's new. I don't really, I don't need stuff like that to appeal to a wider market. I just need it to appeal to the current market which like nothing is really doing right now besides memes.
00:24:40.785 - 00:24:41.257, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:41.321 - 00:24:42.689, Speaker A: So I don't know.
00:24:42.857 - 00:24:47.245, Speaker B: You don't have anything else that you're excited about before we jump into like Poly Market stuff?
00:24:49.185 - 00:24:52.833, Speaker A: Not really. I mean I want another airdrop farming.
00:24:52.889 - 00:24:55.085, Speaker B: Opportunity, but that's over.
00:24:55.945 - 00:24:59.745, Speaker A: Yeah, I, I like not even like everything's capital now.
00:24:59.785 - 00:25:21.963, Speaker B: Fun game. How much, how much, how much is bear chain monad movement farmers are going to make? You could throw in like test. Don't throw in scroll, don't throw in scroll. Just like the average farmer, let's just.
00:25:22.019 - 00:25:24.155, Speaker A: Say because all those guys are on test net.
00:25:24.315 - 00:25:30.469, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you think their airdrop is going to be fat enough because the arc they're on devnet.
00:25:30.597 - 00:26:15.791, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think test net farmers make more than like 200 per wallet. And that's like the bull scenario these people have. And like it's honestly Mark, it depends on when they drop because there have been people market making for a while and forming Poly Market for a while and only just now are people starting to talk about it. Poly Market could be good because it's, it's largely like it's not been common to farm it or to, or to sybil that drop up until like just now. So like if they, if they wait too long then it's going to be really diluted.
00:26:15.983 - 00:26:23.165, Speaker B: Break down the civil strategy or the most basic one from a high level on Poly Market. Yeah.
00:26:23.585 - 00:27:00.935, Speaker A: Oh, it's super simple. You just, you, you find markets that are trading at like 99 to 1 and you bet on the 1, you pay a penny for a share that gives you a dollar worth of volume. So essentially you get a hundred x the actual like dollar amount you're putting in and you just pay a penny for it. So like if I have a hundred dollars and some market is trading at $0.01 I can go and buy what is that, like 10,000 shares of that. So $10,000? Sorry. Yeah, $10,000 worth of volume.
00:27:01.755 - 00:27:03.855, Speaker B: But someone has to fill you on the other side.
00:27:04.675 - 00:27:18.475, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean you'd have to pick up wrestling liquidity or, or get filled. Do you think if you, if you place a bid then you earn USD rewards which is the nice thing. It makes Your margins a little bit, little bit better.
00:27:18.895 - 00:27:32.207, Speaker B: Do you think they're tracking USD or people that are LPing that are earning USD as probably a form of criteria? Or do you think they're just like, take the USDC and off they See.
00:27:32.231 - 00:28:17.845, Speaker A: The thing is, is like now that they are talking, I think they're kind of up by like they added a section to their docs about a token and about an airdrop, obviously a lot. Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't confirm anything. It just says like, we have not launched the token yet and like there has been no announced airdrop yet. Like all official communication will come from our Twitter account. And the problem with that is poly market volume. I, I think I'm like, obviously I haven't looked at the numbers, but I get the sense that up until that started to happen it was mostly organic, like overwhelmingly organic. Especially compared to like any other crypto like trading platform.
00:28:18.665 - 00:28:25.405, Speaker B: They said they had 10,000 daily. Was it 10,000 daily activities or said maus or.
00:28:26.065 - 00:28:58.855, Speaker A: I don't have a sense for the numbers. It's just based off of straight vibe. No one ever talked about farming a poly market token. People were trading on it because they wanted to trade on it and that put them in a really good spot because then they could drop, they could drop like a normal allocation, like 8 to 12%, whatever. And the actual users would like, they would make a lot of money. That's how you do a good airdrop, literally. And now that they're teasing it to try and juice their volume a little bit more.
00:28:58.855 - 00:29:13.825, Speaker A: It's not there yet. Obviously it depends on how long they go without. But the longer they wait, the more dilutive it's going to be and just the more like the more fake volume they're going to start to see.
00:29:17.085 - 00:29:20.825, Speaker B: I was looking at this recently. Can you see this? Well, should I zoom in?
00:29:22.965 - 00:29:23.945, Speaker A: I can see.
00:29:24.805 - 00:29:31.765, Speaker B: I don't know what this no data should is, but.
00:29:42.825 - 00:29:43.641, Speaker A: What are you looking at?
00:29:43.713 - 00:30:08.575, Speaker B: Volume? I'm looking at the volume per day. Oh, 62 mil. Yeah. Daily users. Like what the is this? Yeah, I mean in reality, like the volume just flew, dude.
00:30:11.555 - 00:30:25.017, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean like they, they, they got traction really quickly and were all over like even mainstream media. Mainstream media. And now that they're.
00:30:25.081 - 00:30:48.153, Speaker B: I was, I was arguing about who tokens, who. What do you think the split is between users that are crypto native versus non crypto native. Yeah, let's just say they have 10,000 users.
00:30:48.329 - 00:31:29.905, Speaker A: I think it's mostly, I think it's mostly crypto users. You can probably approximate it by comparing the odds. Comparing the odds for the presidential election market to like actual polling data. Because crypto is like overwhelmingly right leaning, especially because Trump is a lot more pro crypto crypto than Kamala. Like right now it's at 5049 in Trump's favor. Let's see where we're at here because I'm pretty sure Kamala is ahead on most other polls.
00:31:30.765 - 00:31:34.465, Speaker B: Is she really? I think she's the head on Poly Market.
00:31:35.525 - 00:31:40.945, Speaker A: She's out on Poly Market, but not, not most other places, I think. I'm not sure.
00:31:43.765 - 00:31:46.065, Speaker B: Yeah. Donald Trump is ahead on Poly Market.
00:31:46.535 - 00:32:04.835, Speaker A: Yeah. This, this website looks like. Looks like it just aggregates polling data from different places. It shows Kamala at 49.9 and Trump at 45.8, which is a pretty big difference, honestly.
00:32:08.855 - 00:32:09.675, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:12.185 - 00:32:17.881, Speaker A: I think, I think it's pretty heavily skewed to crypto users still. I don't think that.
00:32:18.073 - 00:32:23.265, Speaker B: So 80, 20, 60, 40, 70, 30.
00:32:23.408 - 00:32:27.285, Speaker A: 70, 30. Probably somewhere around that.
00:32:29.345 - 00:32:29.721, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:29.753 - 00:32:35.445, Speaker A: Everything I'm seeing is showing, is showing Harris like a good 3 or 4% ahead of Trump.
00:32:37.935 - 00:32:38.715, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:39.215 - 00:32:49.167, Speaker A: And that just. That just like goes back to my point of how like they should not be teasing a token or an airdrop. Obviously they can't win.
00:32:49.271 - 00:32:53.671, Speaker B: They're not gonna have any more attention than they do right now into this next month.
00:32:53.863 - 00:32:55.143, Speaker A: They're not gonna have what?
00:32:55.319 - 00:33:03.795, Speaker B: Any more attention. Any more volume, Any more attention. Any more users. Why wouldn't all going to be maxed. Because the election is going to be over.
00:33:04.545 - 00:33:06.089, Speaker A: Oh, well. Yeah. Next month.
00:33:06.257 - 00:33:12.325, Speaker B: Yeah. A billion dollars does not need to sit in anywhere in that. Without a presidential election.
00:33:13.105 - 00:33:19.753, Speaker A: If they're smart, they're launching their token before the election because like, I mean.
00:33:19.769 - 00:33:26.685, Speaker B: Yeah, but you're saying why should they talk about token and stuff? I'm. I was saying that that's. They're doing that because they have.
00:33:29.025 - 00:33:59.433, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean that would be a super aggressive strategy. If they like tease a token and then they drop they. Because they literally just started talk like adding it to their language like in the past couple weeks. So if they do that and then launch the token within the next month, that would be dope. I would, I would love to see that, honestly, but I don't think it's likely. Like, I feel like when you add a mention of a token that's that loose to your.
00:33:59.433 - 00:34:02.725, Speaker A: To your messaging, like, it means it's still far off.
00:34:03.905 - 00:34:55.025, Speaker B: I don't think so. I think, I think Shane and those guys have been thinking about this stuff. For a while. And I think they closed that round that they recently announced a lot earlier than people expected or a lot earlier than it was basically announced. I'm hoping they update the fucking protocol. I hope, I'm hoping they at least do they provide like more, more things for that fucking billion dollars in TVL to do as instead like I hope they, I hope their focus was creating a better protocol versus trying to cash out token wise in time and creating like fake bullshit use cases for a token. They're probably gonna launch a.
00:34:55.025 - 00:35:04.805, Speaker B: I mean some people have said they're going to launch a little chain and, or a little extra layer or something is I think what people are expecting.
00:35:04.885 - 00:35:25.711, Speaker A: But I just hope they hope that's not it before August. They're literally like they're cutting off. At least give me November or sorry, November. Yeah, they're cutting off like at least a third of their market cap, I think. And they have to know that they can't be that naive. Unless they, unless their initial TG roadmap was still years out. I don't think that they would like.
00:35:25.711 - 00:35:49.645, Speaker A: I think they're smart enough to either like their token plan was always to wait till like 2026 or something or like they're launching within the next month. Anything in between is just like a gross mismanagement of their token launch. I think because they can't be that naive that they're like, oh, we'll find a way to like maintain volume after the election. It's like, nah, dude, there's no way be real.
00:35:50.505 - 00:35:53.041, Speaker B: And people must have been telling them this though for a while.
00:35:53.113 - 00:35:53.545, Speaker A: They have to.
00:35:53.585 - 00:36:02.073, Speaker B: They must know. Yeah, they must know. They must know that they have to be like more capital efficient. They must know. They have to like figure some out some stuff.
00:36:02.129 - 00:36:15.201, Speaker A: But in fairness, you don't, you don't get to that level of success. You don't get to be like a successful team, a successful founder without being, without being like delusional, you know. So like maybe it's possible that's still.
00:36:15.273 - 00:36:17.961, Speaker B: They're delusional in a good way. They're delusional.
00:36:18.033 - 00:36:19.405, Speaker A: You don't know where it is always.
00:36:20.185 - 00:36:30.201, Speaker B: They've always believed though in like the, the prediction market world and that being like a tough problem to solve.
00:36:30.353 - 00:36:31.081, Speaker A: So then don't you.
00:36:31.113 - 00:36:32.209, Speaker B: I think it is like they would.
00:36:32.297 - 00:36:40.525, Speaker A: Delusional not launch like if they are delusional, don't you think they would be like, oh well, the election will make it up anyways.
00:36:40.945 - 00:37:13.857, Speaker B: I think they have a rough. I think they have a Hard balancing act to solve for. There's demand from the crypto side to make more complex financial product basically or like a more advanced financial product. But there's also that they need to be able to fulfill the. I think in their minds they probably have a higher skew of. They believe that they're the consumer app for crypto and that there's a bunch of non crypto people using their protocol. I doubt that more than I think they doubt that.
00:37:13.857 - 00:37:29.873, Speaker B: And I think they might over index for the non crypto natives and then slowly watch TVL just like vanish. Unless they advance the protocol, they probably.
00:37:29.929 - 00:37:42.745, Speaker A: Know what users aren't crypto native. It's so. It's probably so easy to, to figure out. Like you just look at the wallet history and the funding source and that's like a rough, a good enough way to approximate.
00:37:44.285 - 00:38:46.771, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I don't know. It's gonna be tough for them. I, I think, I think they can get away without with, with not launching a token if they've really thought about advancing the way the protocol works and the capabilities it has. I think that if they cater towards a crypto native money strong enough, they'll maintain a strong amount of TVL and just find a way for more complex financial stuff, more capital efficient stuff to happen on the app. People don't want to show up to some and not get filled on the bid and they don't want to bridge the polygon to use the app. Like those things that can make for a way better experience and more advanced types of trading because there is like.
00:38:46.771 - 00:38:48.895, Speaker B: Is your money in like a D5 protocol?
00:38:52.885 - 00:38:54.185, Speaker A: Probably, yeah.
00:38:57.685 - 00:38:58.585, Speaker B: Which one?
00:39:00.485 - 00:39:01.141, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:39:01.213 - 00:39:02.037, Speaker B: What percent?
00:39:02.221 - 00:39:04.505, Speaker A: Symbiotic. I have money in symbiotic.
00:39:05.765 - 00:39:35.923, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think they don't have to drop a token. I think they can do like more advanced stuff that could generate yield and people will put their money there because it's like it's still poly market. It's still the best place for a prediction market. It's still, you know, this X, Y and Z thing and they can maintain that and still not drop a token and still get people excited about a future. Token is my thing. I don't think they have to drop a token within this month.
00:39:35.923 - 00:39:39.295, Speaker B: I think they need to create a better fucking protocol.
00:39:40.075 - 00:39:49.165, Speaker A: But how do you top literally being a data source on like CNN and shit like that? Like what are they gonna build?
00:39:50.505 - 00:40:39.145, Speaker B: All you want. You can be a data source on CNN all you want, but if you can't find a Home for a billion dollars in TVL once the election is over. It's the same problem that like, like Sanctum Sanctum had that moment where there's like giant amount of TV on the protocol. This is their loudest moment. They're about to drop a token. They have to do things that remove people's willingness to just remove the money out of the protocol. I think if they can maintain above $500 million in the app and create a better app, you could probably generate really solid yield.
00:40:39.145 - 00:41:25.745, Speaker B: What if, like, they just immediately have like a really dope market for the next election market and they're like, yeah, like, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll throw your fucking. The money that you're gonna like put in here for four years. We'll throw it into like fucking yield opportunities. Well, like there are some CFTC regulated prediction markets that bet on NASA moon landings and stuff like that that put their money like the, the protocol. The app takes their money and because it's going to sit for like years or months, they'll put it into like treasuries and get 5%. Like that's, that's a step above than what Poly Market has right now. And those guys are CFTC regulated.
00:41:25.745 - 00:41:33.625, Speaker B: So I think they just need to do cooler and more capital efficient shit and advance the protocol rather than just dumping a token.
00:41:36.325 - 00:41:56.261, Speaker A: I don't. Well, no, I'm not saying they should dump a token to retain users. That's not going to accomplish that. The point of launching the token then is so you launch at a higher valuation. Let's just be real. They want to launch at the highest possible. Obviously they want their token to be worth something in the long run.
00:41:56.261 - 00:42:04.805, Speaker A: I think we've matured enough step in that process. No, we have not a step in that process. At a high initial valuation, I think.
00:42:04.845 - 00:42:28.695, Speaker B: We will look far out in advance and say, you know, they're going to dominate in an election space. They're creating a more, you know, efficient protocol that is going to create better yield opportunities. Better. Kind of like there's no money in the protocol. They're going to create sports betting. They're going to create, you know, this Poly Market is a household name at this point. Like I could still see people using the app at this point.
00:42:28.695 - 00:42:53.049, Speaker B: Like they have the clout to like partner with some of the biggest streamers. They have the clout to do like, really cool. The only other risk I'd see for them is like the regulatory, because they could just get regulated to zero. Be honest, that's what.
00:42:53.097 - 00:42:54.609, Speaker A: I don't think there's some other prediction.
00:42:54.657 - 00:42:57.285, Speaker B: Markets saying that it's gonna happen.
00:42:57.905 - 00:43:23.035, Speaker A: I don't think there's any market that they can launch any product, any yield, anything they can offer that is gonna, Is gonna come close to what is literally the biggest news event of, of every like, of every four years. Like, there. There's nothing they could do that's bigger than the catalyst of being a month, a couple months out from election day.
00:43:23.975 - 00:43:28.875, Speaker B: I think they got it in them. I think prediction markets have a lot more to offer than elections.
00:43:30.255 - 00:43:42.447, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, but not at that scale. Because you have to remember they have friction too. They're. They have. It's not. They have so much friction to their platform too. Because you have to.
00:43:42.447 - 00:43:43.079, Speaker A: You have to.
00:43:43.127 - 00:43:43.583, Speaker B: That's what I'm saying.
00:43:43.599 - 00:43:45.971, Speaker A: They have to get better product.
00:43:46.083 - 00:43:55.115, Speaker B: They make a better product and a more advanced product. They need to give you reasons to keep money in the protocol outside of the election. Well, anyway, how do, how are people.
00:43:55.155 - 00:44:05.267, Speaker A: Going to get election timeline? They're behind if, if they know 100. Because you still have to onboard through Polygon. And there's no other, there's no other markets that are exciting.
00:44:05.451 - 00:44:35.955, Speaker B: I think they prioritize the fact that this is working for the elections now. We have half a billion dollars in this app, or even if they were at 100 million, we have $100 million in this election market. Let's just keep this shit working until the election is over. We'll advance the protocol and try new shit once there's like, once there's not the biggest prediction market in the fucking world on this, on this app. And we can do cooler shit. We can change the onboarding experience. We can change things around and we can try cooler shit.
00:44:35.955 - 00:44:37.867, Speaker B: Sports betting, streamers.
00:44:37.931 - 00:44:40.851, Speaker A: Wait till this has to happen before the election settles.
00:44:40.923 - 00:45:23.915, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like they've been working on it because there's no way. There's no way you as a grown man, you as a grown man onboard onto Polygon the way that the onboarding experience has been now and say, yeah, this is, this is the future of finance. I think they realized that a long time ago and have been building towards changing that for a very long time. I, I think that, that, that's my thing, granted. I do think, I do think very highly of that Shane guy. I think he's like, could be like a pretty, you know, smart dude, but yeah, I don't know. How are people gonna make free money?
00:45:26.135 - 00:45:35.635, Speaker A: Well, I mean, you can still. You can, you can. That has nothing to do with. With the election market. It's quite the opposite, actually. Those are. Those are the markets you want to stay away from.
00:45:35.635 - 00:45:46.275, Speaker A: Like, I'll still be using Poly Market. Not that I'm like an active user, but I'll still be looking for. I'll still be looking for, like.
00:45:46.575 - 00:45:47.527, Speaker B: Are you gonna hide.
00:45:47.591 - 00:45:48.559, Speaker A: Are you off?
00:45:48.727 - 00:45:52.423, Speaker B: Are you gonna hide what we were talking about from the audience?
00:45:52.599 - 00:45:53.991, Speaker A: What were we talking about?
00:45:54.143 - 00:45:59.583, Speaker B: The. The three observations for free money on pot, free 20 X's on pod.
00:45:59.639 - 00:46:01.795, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I tweeted about it.
00:46:03.515 - 00:46:04.255, Speaker B: Man.
00:46:04.675 - 00:46:25.575, Speaker A: I mean, no, I'm not gonna hide it because I think people. Because I think people. The thing is, is, like, I was not gonna. I was not gonna, like, tweet it out at first because I knew, like, it's pretty clear. It's pretty clear something like that would go viral. And I was not gonna tweet it at first, but then I realized, like, no one's gonna put in the actual work because you have to actually pay attention to do it.
00:46:26.115 - 00:46:30.267, Speaker B: So what should people. What do people have to do for a free 20x on Poly Market?
00:46:30.411 - 00:46:44.123, Speaker A: Well, you have to. First of all, you have to be, like, monitoring the markets regularly. Like, you can't. You can't just. Anytime a new market goes up, you should know about it and you should check it within, like, at least a day or two.
00:46:44.259 - 00:46:46.815, Speaker B: What should you be looking for? Or what are you looking for?
00:46:48.435 - 00:47:23.323, Speaker A: You would be looking. The difference in, like, the question that they ask and the actual settlement conditions is pretty important. It's not often that those. That those don't line up, but when they don't line up, that's when you can literally, like, break the system and stuff that is just like, stuff that is uncertain and has, like, skewed public perception. A lot of it is also around announcements. It helps. It helps a lot to check odds immediately after announcements, especially because polymarket is super inefficient.
00:47:23.323 - 00:47:48.011, Speaker A: So for these markets that have like 20k of volume lifetime on them, it's going to take like 20, 30 minutes for things to swing for people to like, for people to put the connection together between an announcement and a Poly Market bet, which is, like, if you just pay attention, like, that's plenty of time to go on there and be one of the ones to swing it in the first place.
00:47:48.163 - 00:47:56.237, Speaker B: So observe new markets. Look for a market that you think you'd have an edge in. Or is it just any market that has a very skewed opinion?
00:47:56.421 - 00:48:03.185, Speaker A: It helps. It definitely helps to have an edge in it like. And that's what's good about so many crypto markets.
00:48:03.685 - 00:48:05.589, Speaker B: Is that what you focus on, the crypto ones?
00:48:05.717 - 00:48:30.595, Speaker A: I mostly look at the crypto ones. Yeah. I'm sure there's such a broad base of topics on here. Like, I'm sure there's other stuff you could find. But like, like the Venezuelan election one was like super random. I have no expertise there whatsoever. But it took like, you know, 10 minutes of Googling to kind of get a rough idea of what was going on and profit off of that.
00:48:30.595 - 00:48:33.159, Speaker A: I'm sure there's tons of more examples.
00:48:33.247 - 00:49:09.929, Speaker B: Like, the thing is, when the market comes brand new, there is like 50, 50, volume is very slow to move in and you don't see this skew. So like when the market immediately comes on, are you looking for something that you like could have an edge in and you're like, all right, I'm going to wait for volume to kind of move the odds into what I think is too skewed to like something like a 99 to 1, which happened with the Eigen layer airdrop. You just kind of favorite that market and just observe it over time, Wait for volume to move because they come in at 50, 50 and then you're kind of just like sitting there. Like, what the. Or do you place bids even when they're at 50, 50?
00:49:10.097 - 00:49:29.605, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't place bids at 50, 50 most of the time. I don't usually get to markets that early. It's. It's usually like I'll check them a couple days after they go live and by then like odds have settled a little bit. Honestly, like an. Big announcements around an existing market are probably more actionable than, probably more actionable than new markets themselves.
00:49:29.605 - 00:50:08.093, Speaker A: Just because people are super, super slow to react to news. And when they do react, it's not uncommon for it to be like a knee jerk overreaction. Like it was with like, it was with Eigenlayer. Like it was with like the Trump token stuff. That's another thing is like not just, not just being early to announcements, but like even being late and, and like catching just a complete overcorrection in one direction. So like the Eigen token. The Eigen token announcement is a really good example because it happened like three times.
00:50:08.093 - 00:51:01.739, Speaker A: It happened again after, like after we had talked about it because apparently they launched early or something like that. So it swung from like, it swung from like 99 to 1, back to 99 again, which is crazy. Or maybe even more, maybe even once more than that and the thing is, is like people were treating this like an all or nothing thing when like settlement takes time. We still had days to expiry. And like, you know, like people in these markets, people don't think about like the value of time in this. Like, even if eigenlair announces their token is launching after the settlement date, there are still like two to three days for that to be realized. That should be factored into the odds.
00:51:01.739 - 00:51:17.815, Speaker A: Like mentally not. It's not factored in the market, but you have to factor it in yourself precisely because no one else is like this. I'm sure, I'm sure. When will bear chain launch in 2024. How much volume has that done?
00:51:19.395 - 00:51:20.375, Speaker B: 5K.
00:51:21.195 - 00:51:22.055, Speaker A: Okay.
00:51:23.635 - 00:51:31.411, Speaker B: Like if these, if bro, this at 91, there might be a good. There might be.
00:51:31.603 - 00:52:02.305, Speaker A: You know, I mean, like, so a basic thing here is like, like, let's say so for that market specifically, like, as we get closer to the end of the year, I'm sure there's going to be announcements. Oh, that's actually not a bad punt right there. I would not hate taking that one. Maybe if. Maybe. I think it has a lot to do with like the market downturn. If not for that, then this would probably be a lot higher.
00:52:02.305 - 00:52:06.025, Speaker A: But yeah, let's say like we're approaching.
00:52:06.325 - 00:52:13.805, Speaker B: This feels like it hits your criteria. 19k in volume. It's almost that I don't have 1% odds.
00:52:16.665 - 00:52:27.845, Speaker A: Here. Like, intuitively, I would probably price it closer to like 8 to 10%, which is like not enough of a. That's not enough of a discrepancy for me to really be too interested in it.
00:52:28.945 - 00:52:32.085, Speaker B: Like, look at this. $1 in volume for this.
00:52:32.785 - 00:52:37.469, Speaker A: What the. I can't. I can't see. Our faces are on the left side, so I can't see the.
00:52:37.617 - 00:52:39.509, Speaker B: Ah, my bad. Hold on.
00:52:39.677 - 00:52:53.345, Speaker A: You're just gonna have a little haircut. Wow. Well, these just went live, I think. Oh yeah, these just went live last week. I'm pretty sure. I am actually as swell on here. Swell should be on here, right?
00:52:55.165 - 00:52:56.157, Speaker B: Yes. There.
00:52:56.221 - 00:52:59.101, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm.
00:52:59.253 - 00:53:04.191, Speaker B: You can bet your. You can bet your life savings that they'll delay a airdrop.
00:53:04.373 - 00:53:14.643, Speaker A: I. Yeah, I'm, I'm. I should probably set a bit on this because I'm leaning towards no, I do not like swell. I. I openly hate anyone who does.
00:53:14.779 - 00:53:16.099, Speaker B: Anyone who does those guys.
00:53:16.187 - 00:53:47.435, Speaker A: Like, like, not only did they continue to delay over and over and over and over again, but then when I bring it up, when I bring it up to them, they send Their intern, like, oh, well, well, Solana subsidizes validator emissions and you get points for holding Swell. It's like, brother, points are worth $0. And they have been since Brother. I. We were like, actively farming this thing too, back in, like, literally in like, April, March of 2023.
00:53:47.515 - 00:53:56.535, Speaker B: I recently. I recently saw someone write a thread saying, I'm sick of Swell. They've. They've. They've delayed too many times. I'm like, brother, you're just noticing?
00:53:57.315 - 00:54:19.585, Speaker A: They. They just continued. They continued. They, like, I was upset at them delaying over a year ago at this point, and they continued to delay for a whole other year after that. And the worst part is, is if you go to their Twitter, look at how much they talk about swell. Look at how much they mentioned, like, sweat. Oh, they launched the Checker or the Checker next week.
00:54:19.585 - 00:54:36.435, Speaker A: The Swell Checker will launch next week. I don't give a. I'm not. I'm not believing this token is launching until it is sitting in my wallet and I can see it, at which point I'm sending it. I'm. I'm. Oh, yeah, yeah, look at this.
00:54:38.095 - 00:54:40.095, Speaker B: Still have nothing to show for it. You have.
00:54:40.135 - 00:54:41.983, Speaker A: You have more pearls than what you.
00:54:42.039 - 00:54:55.503, Speaker B: Started with, along with 3% plus yield in December of 2023. Could you imagine, bro, when soul validators are actually profitable without subsidies from the foundation?
00:54:55.559 - 00:54:56.707, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, bro.
00:54:56.771 - 00:55:00.055, Speaker B: Someone put this on the top of the mid curve chart, man. Holy.
00:55:00.515 - 00:55:16.131, Speaker A: I think. I think the initial tweet was about Jito, because I was like, yeah. I was like, yeah, like, dude, I like, Judo literally changed lives. Judo changed my life. I would go as far as to say that, like, shout out to those guys. Shout out to Buffalo and all them. Those guys are fucking chads.
00:55:16.131 - 00:55:47.025, Speaker A: Regardless. Like, airdrop aside, they have a genuinely good, like, industry dominant product, whereas Swell, like, was. Was, like, unoriginal first thing when it was just, like, trying to compete as an lst. Now they're doing the whole now. Then they've, like, pivoted to restaking like most failing LSTs did, and then now they're doing a L2. Like, they're securing a L2 with restaked assets like, dude, send it, send it. Please get it together.
00:55:47.025 - 00:55:59.071, Speaker A: Honestly, we, like, I want to say that we deserve better in this space, but we don't. Maybe that's a stretch. Maybe we deserve projects like Swell.
00:55:59.263 - 00:56:06.995, Speaker B: Yeah. Liquid token launch.
00:56:08.015 - 00:56:22.465, Speaker A: This is an interesting one. There's probably this. This will actually. This is a really good one to watch today and tomorrow because yesterday was the last point snapshot. Which means they are likely going to announce something tomorrow or early next week.
00:56:23.605 - 00:56:26.037, Speaker B: So damn.
00:56:26.061 - 00:56:31.557, Speaker A: November is. Is it way. Is it launch in that month or is it launched before that month?
00:56:31.741 - 00:56:33.421, Speaker B: It's just like basically when.
00:56:33.573 - 00:56:34.877, Speaker A: So okay, so if it launches, you.
00:56:34.901 - 00:56:36.013, Speaker B: Pick a month or go later, all.
00:56:36.029 - 00:56:41.383, Speaker A: Other ones are going to settle to zero. October is not bad here, honestly.
00:56:41.559 - 00:56:42.275, Speaker B: Really.
00:56:42.895 - 00:56:48.607, Speaker A: Well, okay, not yet, but I think.
00:56:48.751 - 00:56:50.835, Speaker B: I think it get really bad.
00:56:51.135 - 00:57:21.745, Speaker A: I think something you can do literally right now is set. Turn on Twitter notifications for hyperliquid, move their discord to like the top of your thing. So it's right there and just like as soon as you see an announcement come up, you go straight to this market. And if it's. I don't know what it's gonna be like. I don't think they have a super long period with no points and no tge. Like I think they have to roll into either more points or give more information about tge.
00:57:21.745 - 00:57:45.505, Speaker A: But the idea is like look at these markets like mid four figures in volume. They have an announcement coming probably tomorrow, if not tomorrow, early next week. With just how few people are on here, it's like practically certain that if you're early enough to the announcement, you can, you can find an ARB here. If they say something. If they say something telling.
00:57:50.285 - 00:58:06.515, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean what's the return at these rates? 28 cents. It's not bad returns for what it's worth like 200%. Yeah, I just wish like.
00:58:10.135 - 00:58:31.353, Speaker A: Spread'S pretty good. That's actually surprisingly liquid. Maybe this won't swing that hard then I was well, ah, never mind. Yeah, down to 11. It's like a couple hundred dollars. But yeah, no like this like winning on this app.
00:58:31.369 - 00:58:32.445, Speaker B: What the is this?
00:58:32.785 - 00:58:34.125, Speaker A: Sonic's Phantom.
00:58:35.825 - 00:58:40.089, Speaker B: 2025. If this goes to 99, I feel like this is a dude.
00:58:40.137 - 00:59:05.495, Speaker A: Any. Any like 99 token launch event. Token launch event that hasn't been like done yet. You can probably like just punt on because it's 100x and people delay all the time. So like, like just broadly the entire crypto space, I think there's a greater than 1% chance of like everyone delay.
00:59:07.755 - 00:59:08.615, Speaker B: This is.
00:59:09.075 - 00:59:27.025, Speaker A: But I wonder like it would be really interesting to look at all of the crypto launch markets and back test like the returns for every time a market hit 1% because I'm fairly certain it would be quite plus EV.
00:59:30.765 - 00:59:33.341, Speaker B: Cracking IPO in 2024.
00:59:33.668 - 00:59:46.305, Speaker A: IPO? Isn't Kraken launching it? Maybe an L2 question mark was that Kraken or someone else. OkX. OkX already has an L2, I think.
00:59:46.685 - 00:59:47.237, Speaker B: No.
00:59:47.341 - 00:59:48.505, Speaker A: OkX chain.
00:59:48.995 - 00:59:49.775, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:54.275 - 01:00:00.635, Speaker A: They still have that token, right? Was it okt or something? Remember when you hated that? Okb. That's what it was.
01:00:00.795 - 01:00:03.535, Speaker B: Oh yeah. Fuck okb.
01:00:04.755 - 01:00:17.585, Speaker A: It's worth 9 billion ftv. Oh dude. It looks like it's outperformed eth like by quite a lot actually. Oh wait, I'm looking at the wrong time frame. Maybe not.
01:00:22.885 - 01:00:23.197, Speaker B: Tim.
01:00:23.221 - 01:00:23.557, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:00:23.581 - 01:00:30.585, Speaker B: This thing Was John McAfee alive? How does this settle? This will never settle.
01:00:32.405 - 01:00:34.625, Speaker A: Well, scroll down to the settlement conditions.
01:00:36.565 - 01:00:37.581, Speaker B: Proof is public.
01:00:37.733 - 01:00:54.595, Speaker A: Hit show more. Hit show more. Is there a timing on it? Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean it's gonna settle and he has to. That would be, that would be like wild, wild news.
01:00:55.655 - 01:01:00.395, Speaker B: In 2024 criminal charges.
01:01:00.775 - 01:01:26.697, Speaker A: I like Selkis. I don't care what anyone says. He's probably mentally ill. But I, I respect his mental ill. I respect his conviction even if I don't agree with everything he says. What else? We're going to talk about airdrop farming. There's nothing to airdrop farm.
01:01:26.697 - 01:01:53.725, Speaker A: I was, I, I, I benchmarked my portfolio the other day. I don't know if you saw. I sent a picture in in front running Friends and like I was thinking about how I didn't actually like do the math but I was thinking about how how much of those returns are just from airdrops. It's probably a lot. It's probably like a majority of it. So it's like the do I do now Just keep holding Ethan using money.
01:01:54.105 - 01:01:59.585, Speaker B: Can you go into no zones with size? What?
01:02:01.405 - 01:02:02.825, Speaker A: Just check the order book.
01:02:05.165 - 01:02:06.957, Speaker B: Can make a quick 2% I guess.
01:02:07.021 - 01:02:09.545, Speaker A: You do not place. You do not place.
01:02:10.885 - 01:02:11.461, Speaker B: I wonder.
01:02:11.533 - 01:02:15.625, Speaker A: Don't place market orders on. On Poly Market. That is a terrible idea.
01:02:21.285 - 01:02:28.875, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. My market is fun and I like prediction markets as the.
01:02:30.615 - 01:02:53.745, Speaker A: It's a fun app. I'm not bearish on them by any means. I just think that, I mean I don't think it's an uncommon opinion but I just think that they have to do something within the next month. Either launch a token or some other product or product improvement. Wouldn't be ideal but it would be better than nothing. They just have to act. They got to do something.
01:02:57.125 - 01:02:58.665, Speaker B: Farming opportunities.
01:02:59.485 - 01:03:01.013, Speaker A: There's nothing where to go from here.
01:03:01.069 - 01:03:01.665, Speaker B: Really.
01:03:03.725 - 01:03:09.145, Speaker A: You can wrap up here. I didn't like your title.
01:03:10.125 - 01:03:22.451, Speaker B: You're being. Dude, do we have the clip? Do we have the clip? Did you name your three criteria, I think. So there's a good clip in there maybe.
01:03:22.523 - 01:03:24.251, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, it's in there somewhere.
01:03:24.443 - 01:03:25.147, Speaker B: Somewhere.
01:03:25.251 - 01:03:26.655, Speaker A: I don't want to force it.
01:03:27.435 - 01:03:28.375, Speaker B: What else?
01:03:30.755 - 01:03:37.491, Speaker A: Nothing else. We can. We can wrap up here, like just a poly market episode, basically. That's what that was.
01:03:37.523 - 01:03:40.655, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. And the thing is, I wanted to do one with Nate as well.
01:03:41.595 - 01:03:48.567, Speaker A: We can still do one. I mean, this was mostly just like he's. He's more interested in, like, he actually.
01:03:48.591 - 01:03:49.503, Speaker B: Knows what he's talking about.
01:03:49.559 - 01:03:53.595, Speaker A: Yeah, he actually knows what he's talking about. That's the main difference.
01:03:54.695 - 01:04:00.199, Speaker B: Yeah. And please, someone, build something cool and DM us.
01:04:00.247 - 01:04:02.407, Speaker A: Please was the main takeaways. Pretty much.
01:04:02.471 - 01:04:03.075, Speaker B: Please.
01:04:04.655 - 01:04:05.375, Speaker A: All right, all right.
01:04:05.415 - 01:04:10.995, Speaker B: That was episode 89. Road to a billion episodes.
01:04:12.375 - 01:04:13.355, Speaker A: Hell, yeah.
01:04:14.455 - 01:04:16.015, Speaker B: All right, peace, guys.
