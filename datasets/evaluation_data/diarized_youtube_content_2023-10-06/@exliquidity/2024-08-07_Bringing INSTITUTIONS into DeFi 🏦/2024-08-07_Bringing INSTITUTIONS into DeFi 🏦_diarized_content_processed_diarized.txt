00:00:00.120 - 00:00:22.982, Speaker A: The due diligence process is like, yeah, let me just message someone and see if they're legit or not, and I'll just send them money or something. Right. We were able to put a very substantial amount of money together by providing an institutional rail into this stuff for anyone who's, like, interested in it, they're calling laser. It's very tratfi, very suit. Now, they don't have to set up this. Whatever. Fire blocks custody and talk to their lawyers and make sure that's okay.
00:00:22.982 - 00:00:52.402, Speaker A: And we're gonna punt ten mil into this Eigen layer pool. But, oh, actually, if a deposit comes into a NATO cash, we have to get out. It's never gonna work. If we want to get DeFi to a place where the master are actually using it and trusting it, we have to comply to their standards so that we can onboard institutional money, so that retail money can trust DeFi again. Because in some ways, the Defi bull run came too soon, in the sense that we didn't fix any of the problems with DeFi. We didn't fix the hacks custody problem, we didn't fix the trust issue. The bull run came back with the bitcoin ETF's, and Defi was still the exact same as it was before.
00:00:52.402 - 00:00:59.010, Speaker A: Now there's even more issues. The only way we're going to progress the industry forward is if we take a step back. Comply to what these family offices and big trading.
