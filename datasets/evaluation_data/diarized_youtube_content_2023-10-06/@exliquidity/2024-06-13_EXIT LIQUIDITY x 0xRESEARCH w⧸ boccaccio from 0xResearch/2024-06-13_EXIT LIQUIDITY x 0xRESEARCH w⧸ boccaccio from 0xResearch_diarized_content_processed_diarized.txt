00:00:26.880 - 00:00:44.980, Speaker A: Welcome back to another episode of Exit Liquidity. This is episode 77, fun one this week, little crossover episode with Zero X Research, and we've got boccaccio with us. I hope I'm saying that right. Thanks for joining us, man.
00:00:45.800 - 00:00:47.632, Speaker B: Thank you for having me. Yeah, I'm excited.
00:00:47.736 - 00:01:10.362, Speaker A: Fun stuff. Yeah, we've been mutuals for a while. I think we've interacted plenty of times on either some of your work or my work on Twitter. Just like, I don't know, just yapping about something at one point or another for past year or so. So good to finally. Good to finally do a pod together to start out. Like, would love to hear a little bit about your background.
00:01:10.362 - 00:01:17.910, Speaker A: We have chatted before, obviously, but not too much. It's always good to hear why you're here. Kind of where you came from, that kind of stuff.
00:01:19.930 - 00:01:31.670, Speaker B: Yeah. So I got started. 2021, like, mid 2020. 2021. Close to the top. But I didn't. I didn't technically buy the top, but I did buy the top of some coins.
00:01:31.670 - 00:01:54.050, Speaker B: And then I stuck around 2022. 2023. I started doing more and more research throughout that time. Like, actually serious stuff. Just looked at, like, okay, these are down. Why? And then. Yeah, and then stuck around and joined blockworks research, where I do zero x research as well as, like, other research stuff.
00:01:54.050 - 00:02:05.070, Speaker B: That's really it. I feel like I don't have that interesting of a story. It's kind of like a basic background of class of what, 2020? 2021? But that's really it.
00:02:05.150 - 00:02:06.494, Speaker A: I think that's about our class, too.
00:02:06.542 - 00:02:15.610, Speaker C: What was, like, the. Yeah, what was, like, the crypto pilling moment? What were you doing at the time? Were you working in, like, another industry?
00:02:16.150 - 00:02:35.732, Speaker B: I, um. I was, but I wasn't working in anything related to crypto. I, um. Actually, my father told me about crypto, which I feel like is a rare, rare thing to happen. And, yeah, he was like. Because it was Covid, he was like, look into this stuff. 2021, I would say.
00:02:35.732 - 00:03:12.870, Speaker B: Like, I bought the top of some coins, but before that, I was already, like, kind of. I feel like people do this, they're, like, DCA ing into e for something like a year before, like, six months before they actually join. So I was doing that, and then, like, I think that's. I don't know if I was, like, crypto pilled. I just felt like it was interesting. And then when I really started looking into it, I got, like, that's when I got crypto pilled, because there's so much stuff going on all the time, and I was at that stage where in Covid, you were so bored, and you were like, I need to do something, and crypto. Was it?
00:03:13.030 - 00:03:13.770, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:14.270 - 00:03:43.768, Speaker C: Was it. What were some of, like, the first things that you wrote about? Because I really resonate with what you said of, like, why is this going down? Except most of the stuff I bought in my portfolio, and so I was, like, panicking, trying to figure out why most of it was going down. And that's, like, what enticed me to start actually learning about what was happening in the background of these things. Like, what were some of the first pieces, what things went down that you decided to research?
00:03:43.904 - 00:04:19.804, Speaker B: I think I'm looking back at it now. I found my old substrate, but I think the main thing that I was, and I feel like this is such a. If you're not, like, really in crypto for long, you get really, like, you know that, like, learning curve chart where it's like this? I got really into fracs because I feel like that's what people get really into. And they're like, right at that stage, it's like, whoa, there's so much stuff going on here. There's liquidity into FXS, and they're launching FBI and, like, so much stuff happening. So that was one of the things. But I'm sure I wrote about other stuff.
00:04:19.804 - 00:04:35.690, Speaker B: That's just the first thing that I could find that I published. I know, I like, I also did some stuff on option stuff, like delta neutral strategy vaults and stuff. I don't think I've ever used one in my life, like, since then.
00:04:36.070 - 00:04:44.810, Speaker C: And how did you, like, was it like, a viral tweet or a viral piece that got the block work guys attention? How do you get connected there?
00:04:46.070 - 00:05:35.472, Speaker B: So I used to do these notes on podcasts and on videos or, like, spaces, and I think that kind of got me through the door of a lot of, like, these chats where they're like, oh, like, this guy wrote, like, really good notes on this. We should let him in. Like, and so we can discuss, like, whatever, alpha or just mostly, like, not alpha, but, like, whatever research notes you have, because people hate listening to those, like, two hour podcasts, like, the really technical, technical ones, and. Yeah, so that's how I got in. I, um. I think, like, just writing stuff also gets people's eyes. Like, if you're spending time trying to make stuff look pretty and writing, like, obviously spending effort trying to understand, like, mechanics and stuff, then people are like, oh, okay.
00:05:35.472 - 00:05:37.100, Speaker B: Like, I want to chat to this guy.
00:05:38.600 - 00:06:10.000, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds like a pretty similar pipeline to what me and Cedo had around the same time, too. I think, like, definitely dcA'ing into this stuff first before really understanding it. That was something that was like, honestly, I got pretty lucky with that. That worked out the way it did because I only started paying attention because I started buying and it started going up, and I was like, holy shit. Like, this is making me money. I should probably figure out what's going on. It's like, if that didn't happen, I may have never actually dug deeper, but, yeah.
00:06:10.000 - 00:06:29.310, Speaker A: Cool to hear that. Kind of similar pipelines there. Before we start yapping here, we have a little rite of passage. All of our guests we have on is before we can get into the episode, we got to get your ex a liquidity story. So your. Your most memorable time in the industry of being exit liquidity?
00:06:30.170 - 00:06:57.504, Speaker B: Yeah. Full disclosure. They mentioned this to me accidentally beforehand. So I've been thinking about it over the past week or so, and honestly, like, there's a lot, but also not any that's particularly memorable. I think the one that I wanted to say was Juul and DFK. I feel like that was, like, later. So it was very, like, easy to get caught up in it and say, oh, like, the market's actually not gone down.
00:06:57.504 - 00:07:16.750, Speaker B: We can. We can make it work if we believe enough. So I think it's the everybody, like, in all honesty, my big problem isn't being exit liquidity. It's more so being, like, mister fumble. Just selling something way, way too early is, like, my signature move, I think.
00:07:17.570 - 00:07:45.010, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a classic, for sure. I think if we scroll through mine and Cedaw's texts over the past 15 months, there's probably a good dozen. Two dozen of one of us just saying generational wealth fumbled again, where we saw something at the right time, we were like, oh, this is cool. And then by the time it took off or by the time we sold it, it was already too late. So that's definitely, definitely one that resonates.
00:07:47.070 - 00:08:03.742, Speaker B: I think it just comes turf, though. Like, if you're on Twitter every single day and you're, like, in the market, you're either gonna sell stuff way too early or way too late. I am. I don't know. Like. Like, cryptos just regret all the time, and then every while, you're like, it.
00:08:03.766 - 00:08:06.170, Speaker A: Really is all, like, psychological sadness.
00:08:06.600 - 00:08:07.144, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:07.232 - 00:08:07.860, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:08.640 - 00:08:38.740, Speaker A: It's one of the things that I, like, learned pretty recently, actually. Maybe in the last, like, six to eight months that kind of helped me, like, cope a little bit better. Was that like, catching 60% of a move is a win? Because even that is hard to do when you think about it. And it's like you have all these people posting about, like, seven, eight figure wins and, like, perfectly, like, top ticking or bottom ticking, it's like, that doesn't happen in real life. You know, you gotta be. You gotta be realistic with your trades.
00:08:40.200 - 00:09:07.532, Speaker B: Yeah. Especially, like, most people lose money a and B. It's that just, like you said, just the ability to make, like, it's just getting so much more competitive now. It, like, it's really, really getting more and more competitive. Like, more sophisticated people are entering the space. It's not also, like, asset selection actually matters. Like, picking winners before.
00:09:07.532 - 00:09:23.692, Speaker B: I feel like. Or at least this is what I hear people say a lot. So maybe it's like, just bias. Everybody's just repeating the same thing. But I've been thinking about it, and it's like, last cycle, if you bought anything, it went up. Maybe, like, at least now it doesn't. It's not like that.
00:09:23.692 - 00:09:34.996, Speaker B: Like, you can be in coins that is. That just don't. That are negative. And it's because there's so much. There's so many coins and so little attention and not enough money to go around.
00:09:35.188 - 00:09:59.274, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, that's actually a good question. Do you. Do you feel like things are, like, different this time around or do you often think about, like, where we're at in the cycle? Or, like, just kind of, like, if. Because, you know, it's. It's weird this time around, right? Like, we're at all time highs. There's not that much retail interests like Iggy Azalea and porn stars and everything are making meme coins.
00:09:59.274 - 00:10:08.830, Speaker A: That feels super toppy in some ways, and in other ways it doesn't. So it's really difficult to gauge where we're at. I feel like.
00:10:11.130 - 00:10:49.636, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree that it's very difficult to gauge where we're at technically. It should. The thing is that if we start saying this time is different and it's super cycle all over again, and then I'm not doing, like, I'm not doing that, but it is really weird, like, things. The thing is that I feel like last cycle, this also happened at, like, I like to think of it, like, every cycle, like, obviously gets bigger and then, like, more people stay. So it also gets larger in that sense. Like, even at the bear, it's still larger than the last cycle. So I think it's just natural.
00:10:49.636 - 00:10:56.012, Speaker B: It's just gonna get sillier and sillier eventually, I think it'll be like a proper industry and a proper asset class.
00:10:56.076 - 00:11:56.850, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, let's hope so. I saw our buddy 563 sent me a tweet yesterday that kind of, like, helped, like, cope a little bit, maybe. Basically the way it goes is, you know, just given the way the cycles has gone so far, like, this person's thoughts are that ETF flows essentially, like, warped the early cycle. Expectations, expectations, and the ridiculous soul rebound that was catalyzed by the FTX collapse kind of just, like, destroyed early expectations because that brought on the meme coin hype and everything that's happening right now when, like, all this stuff seems like it could be, like, late cycle activities, when in reality it's just those two facts. The ETF combined with, like, the FTX collapse into the sole rebound. It makes things feel like late froth, when in reality, like, you know, there's still not a lot of retail interest. We're still on the same kind of timeline that we have always been post having.
00:11:56.850 - 00:12:03.830, Speaker A: So kind of helps, like, process that a little bit. But who knows? Really, who knows what's going on?
00:12:04.690 - 00:12:29.506, Speaker B: I mean, the best way to gauge this is just talk to your friends, but, like, not really close friends, like, further out friends. And then if they. Because, like, for example, last weekend I was talking to people and they were very much still like, oh, crypto is a scam. Not like that. But you know how people get kind of, like, on their high horse. So I think that's like, a good way to gauge. But I mean, obviously, like, everybody's a bit.
00:12:29.506 - 00:12:58.390, Speaker B: Gonna have some bias because they know you and they know that you're in crypto, so they're gonna be a bit, like, interested. But I mean, the FTX thing, I honestly did. Never thought of it. But that makes a lot of sense. The ETF. Yeah, I think that kind of, like, pushed us up a bit. Like, in general, just when price goes up, things get sillier and prices went up earlier than they should have, probably.
00:12:59.050 - 00:13:15.460, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, definitely. My normie friend test group is on to me. Every time I reach out to them and ask them what they think, they're like, ah, shit. I like, here he is again, using us as guinea pigs. So I think. I think you're right. I need to go a little bit outside my friend group.
00:13:15.460 - 00:13:41.560, Speaker A: I want to. I like the idea. I like the idea cedo had last night and just, like, taking a step back and seeing where we've been the last six months or so. Because six months ago was the was the bitcoin ETF approval. And that feels like a pretty, like, salient starting point. That was maybe January 13, something like that. It was on our one year anniversary episode of Exit Liquidity.
00:13:41.560 - 00:13:49.680, Speaker A: What's happened since then? What was like the. Do you guys remember, like, the immediate reaction post ETF?
00:13:51.620 - 00:13:59.524, Speaker B: It was people saying it, sell the news. And then we did actually sell the news for some time, but then we went and everybody was like, yeah, yeah.
00:13:59.572 - 00:14:05.826, Speaker A: We went to all time highs not long after. Right? I. Yeah, yeah.
00:14:05.938 - 00:14:13.594, Speaker C: But, like, in terms of when. When were people staking Tia? Like, one did that.
00:14:13.722 - 00:14:17.242, Speaker A: God, that was earlier. I feel like that was like, right.
00:14:17.266 - 00:14:19.234, Speaker C: After the air drops earlier than the ETF.
00:14:19.322 - 00:14:33.750, Speaker A: That was. No, I guess that was. I mean, Tia launched in November and it. It topped out in February. So I guess, like, it was maybe a little bit before that, but there was. There was quite a bit of overlap.
00:14:35.330 - 00:14:36.310, Speaker B: The top.
00:14:38.130 - 00:14:53.110, Speaker C: Yeah, that phase was interesting. I think people are still, like, looking for a comeback from that kind of. What was it like, Celestia? What was in that group, like, modularity bracket in there?
00:14:53.690 - 00:14:57.470, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Like the early cycle runners say injective.
00:14:59.280 - 00:15:01.272, Speaker C: Yes, injective bonk.
00:15:01.376 - 00:15:05.580, Speaker A: Probably in there, too, but not the same category at all. Just the same timing.
00:15:07.560 - 00:15:18.740, Speaker C: Yeah. I was curious what you think about, like, that, that category in general. Do you have, like, a bag of ts staked? I mean, like, is there a modularity thesis you believe in?
00:15:19.200 - 00:15:39.426, Speaker B: I do have a bag of ts staked, but it's from before, and I forgot that it's 21 days on bond. So I'm still. I start. I don't. I need to actually check if I wanted that. Modularity is kind of like, it's. It's an easy narrative to latch on to.
00:15:39.426 - 00:16:05.200, Speaker B: I feel like it's like, because it's what ETh is going for is, like, this world with a thousand roll ups. But I think, like, people aren't thinking about it practically. Like, can you imagine a world where there actually are a thousand roll ups? And how much of a pain that would be, like, just because I will want to at least try out, let's say, like, 30% of them. That's 300 roll ups. That's way too many roll ups. You can't do 300 roll ups. Like, it's.
00:16:05.200 - 00:16:13.500, Speaker B: Even if, like, these are exaggerated numbers, but I mean, they're going out there and they're saying, we want, like, a world with a thousand roll ups.
00:16:13.540 - 00:16:14.120, Speaker A: Like.
00:16:16.460 - 00:16:39.440, Speaker B: But I mean, Tia is, like, cool. They're not making a lot of money. I don't know if you guys saw. If you guys have seen that, but they, like, it's dirt cheap to post data. So it's like, as a business, I think it's at, like, one of the lowest pe. Yeah, pes. It's just not a very good business, but it has such a, like, it just works so well.
00:16:39.440 - 00:16:56.810, Speaker B: Like, Solana's monolithic. Okay, single chain. The exact opposite of that is Tia. And modularity. It's like midwit bait plus, like, techy enough that it's, like, complicated, but also, like, not super complicated that people don't understand the thesis behind it.
00:16:57.190 - 00:17:30.057, Speaker C: Yeah, I've always. I mean, like, I resonated with it. Not enough to, like, buy celestial. I I looked at it from, like, a mid curve level of, like, this industry or, like, this business model is going to trend to zero anyways. So, like, it's not really something I want to be involved in, but just, like, as a category, when there are so many altcoins, there are so many categories, there's so many narratives now. And I think that's the differentiation between last cycle and this cycle. Like, is there any value in looking at.
00:17:30.057 - 00:17:52.554, Speaker C: I guess you can call them old runners or old narratives and waiting for a comeback in some sense or waiting for that next evolution of the narrative itself? Do you stare at, like, governance forums, or are you, like, you know, in the trenches of each community to kind of, like, decipher that? How do you. How do you, like, evaluate?
00:17:52.682 - 00:18:09.386, Speaker B: I'll, um. So with Tia, I'm going to talk about. So it's three other. It's like three coins. It's eigen, technically, with Eigen, da, um, Celestia, and it's avail. There's others. Near is somewhat like that.
00:18:09.386 - 00:18:48.564, Speaker B: Like, they're really gunning for that now, but near has that every three months where they're like, oh, this month we're doing AI, who are an AI coin now. So they did that with Da as well. But, like, those are so. I don't know because modularity is, like, one of those feces that will likely have, like, in my opinion, it will have a comeback. I just don't really, like, these things are already in the ten billions. Like, FTV wise, what are you getting out of that? Like, realistically, but with narratives and, like, trying to keep up with those. I feel like you kind of need confirmation.
00:18:48.564 - 00:19:09.196, Speaker B: Like, if something keeps coming back, then you can be, like, social fi. I feel like it's such a clear narrative. We had, like, three waves of it already. People keep remembering it they're like, oh, there's social fi, and it, like, it might actually work out. And then they're like, we're buying Djen, we're buying friend or something. Every three months that changes up. I feel like that's.
00:19:09.196 - 00:19:25.040, Speaker B: And like, a lot of people are actually spending money to be on those apps. Um, so I'd like, I don't know unless I see, like, some form of celestia, like, interest again, I wouldn't be like, trying to actively trying to actively get into that market.
00:19:26.350 - 00:19:52.908, Speaker C: Yeah. And when you're, like, researching those, well, actually, maybe we should get a better idea of what research you're currently doing or interested in. But in my mind, like, if, like, how do you approach, or how would you approach, like, researching that kind of sector to kind of like, make it more informed decision for people that are in kind of like, Noob said this.
00:19:53.004 - 00:19:56.600, Speaker B: For data availability, like celestial stuff.
00:19:57.660 - 00:20:07.440, Speaker C: Like, you can just start from a narrative at like a high level. Like, if you're like, into the modular narrative, how deep do you get before you make a decision?
00:20:07.980 - 00:21:06.488, Speaker B: Okay, so I would like, so I wrote actually, a report on data availability a few months back. How did I approach that? I may, like, may basically just want to figure out a who's, who are like the big players that are not non grifty, that aren't just trying to latch on. And then I went through the docs, but really, like, what you want is dev, not dev calls, but like those panels that they do at ECC and stuff where the devs are talking. Because I feel like that's where they're actually like mentioning. For example, one thing about Eigen DA is that they're like specifically positioning themselves for Ethereum roll ups versus like Celestia, which is more interested in roll ups that are settling onto themselves or not necessarily settling to Ethereum, which is two different types of roll ups. There's sovereign roll ups, and then there's a lot of different types. But for this purpose, it's like smart contract roll ups.
00:21:06.488 - 00:21:38.494, Speaker B: If you're in based versus sovereign roll ups, which is like their own thing, they have different, their stack is like jumbled up. It's different. It doesn't have settle on Ethereum. Yeah. So like, that's one of their distinct thing. And then you can start thinking about it like this. Okay, where do I see most roll ups going? Do I think there will be more roll ups than Ethereum or like Ethereum based roll ups? Or do I see, like more roll ups in general? Sovereign roll ups? Well, sovereign roll ups rely on sovereign roll up SDK, which hasn't launched yet.
00:21:38.494 - 00:22:07.586, Speaker B: Like, it's a separate app that hasn't launched yet. But Ethereum roll ups are also like arbitrum, and optimism is never going to use Eigen Da. They're just going to keep settling. They're just going to keep posting data on Ethereum, and then Ethereum is going to have full dank sharding in two years, meaning that data costs are lower. So you don't really even need Eigen Da and Celestia in two years. So it's just thinking about stuff like this, like how they can position, but at the end of the day, it's all narrative based anyway. Like, I think anybody who does research also knows this.
00:22:07.586 - 00:22:46.580, Speaker B: Like, there's very minuscule differences in how these products market themselves and, like, how they try and approach things, like, but at the end of the day, Celestia had the most attention. It was Eigen wasn't out yet, but also, like, when all roll ups that want some form of a narrative to latch onto are using you. I think the big one at the time was Evo, was like, oh, we're going to use Celestia for our data availability. You're like, okay, like, this is obviously the data availability coin that not just the market has through price action, but also, like, other products I've chosen. So if I'm interested in that, I should just go with this.
00:22:47.880 - 00:23:20.420, Speaker C: Yeah. And you kind of touch on it a bit. But, like, there's this mysterious aspect of each narrative that's, like, hard to, I guess, quantify or research, like, people. People's value of, like, community that, you know, each narrative have. What kind of community does Celestia have? The community that Solana has. Like, is there, like, how much weight do you put into the community evaluation of a narrative or a specific protocol? And how do you, like, analyze some of that?
00:23:20.800 - 00:24:14.288, Speaker B: That's, like, with ethereum, I think it's way too big to, like, the thing is, there was the whole ETH alignment meme where it was like, oh, like, this is Eth aligned. And I think that's what I can da was going for. They were going for, like, being EtH aligned, which is like, I don't know if you can be Etha lined, if you are, like, if you're 60% vc. And, like, it just doesn't work very well. You can't be aligned with the trustless network and be, like, investor owned, basically. How do you think about community? I honestly like, it's so, like, the moment that you see those communities popping up, I feel like you got to take a step back and be like, okay, like, is this cringe or is this, like, are we having fun? Etheligned was, I think, always cringe. Cringe.
00:24:14.288 - 00:24:33.128, Speaker B: Solana Manlets was fun. I don't like, at the beginning, it was like, especially when I think it was, like, 25 or $30. Solana and Ansem was bull posting it, and everybody hated Solana still and everybody. Yeah. Solana manlets were gonna keep going. That was fun. I don't know.
00:24:33.128 - 00:24:35.540, Speaker B: Honestly, I don't think about the community at all.
00:24:36.250 - 00:24:53.986, Speaker C: Yeah, I like that metric, though. If it's. If the community screens are fun. Yeah. And then. So, like, just. Well, I think we should just save some time here to start on this, like, ZK narrative.
00:24:53.986 - 00:25:23.028, Speaker C: We were talking, Ali and I were talking to someone yesterday, and their whole interest laid out in crypto centered around, like, ZK and ZK tech. I mean, like, their positions were, you know, in all of that. So that was the reasoning. But I was. I'm curious how you, like, evaluate something that's been talked about like that for so long. And Ellie's gonna. Ellie's getting riled up as I say this, but, like, I feel like the.
00:25:23.028 - 00:26:05.540, Speaker C: The technical blockers that limited ZK from actually working are pretty much over, or if not, like, very close to being over yet. People, like, there's nothing to do on most of these, like, ZK based chains, and they're not really that interesting. We'll start off with the airdrop, Zksync airdrop from a high level, you know? What do you think about it? There's, like, some rumors about some, like, sibo stuff that's happening. Are you going to stake or lock your ZK token for the rest of your life? What are your thoughts there?
00:26:05.700 - 00:26:23.318, Speaker B: No more locking up. I think it was, like, 18% is huge. I think it was 18% or, like, 17.5% or something. That's a lot of money. They airdropped people. Yeah, it's Sybil, obviously, but I don't even know how you can filter out that.
00:26:23.318 - 00:26:51.266, Speaker B: I mean, I hope that they filtered up the 60,000 wallet sybils. Like, obviously, everybody's sybils. Like, I'm sure you guys also have, like, at least ten, maybe not ten, but let's say five to ten wallets that you attempted with. So that's, like, technically sibling, but I think it's fine to do that. I feel like the 60,000 is what you want to worry about. But those guys, I don't even know if like you can really cash them. You need like Nansen and Arkham to come together to figure them out.
00:26:51.266 - 00:26:58.110, Speaker B: But I thought like, the airdrop was fine. I think, like the next few will be really bad. Now scroll, Linnea. These are gonna get.
00:26:58.410 - 00:27:28.076, Speaker A: That's how it goes. Usually. It's, it's a very, like, it's very like obvious from a broad, like, game theory perspective. There's one really big airdrop and everybody comes expecting five more, expecting the next ones to be just as good. And it's like the Ro, you know, the roller coaster meme where it's like the biggest loop and then small and it's like that. I, um, I think it was a great airdrop too. Like, uh, I mean, great token distribution, like, or at least like pushing, pushing the envelope, you know, 66% to community.
00:27:28.076 - 00:28:22.580, Speaker A: I didn't read too much about like the assembly stuff, but like, I'm guessing it's some like Ponzi stuff that will reward users who are more active or reward users who lock or something like that. Um, from, like, from like an actual like ZK, like, tech perspective. And this kind of goes back to like, what you guys were talking about with like, evaluating these, these like, modularity or like, roll up narratives. I feel like I've become pretty like, reductionist with infrastructure these days. Partially because it's advantageous for like, focusing attention on the stuff that is actually, like, making money in a market like this, but also because like, I mean, all things considered, we're doing pretty well. I mean, for the demand we have, like, for the demand we have. Introducing blobs was huge.
00:28:22.580 - 00:29:03.240, Speaker A: Like, I don't think there has been a time since that happened where we've really feel like we've been constrained with roll ups. Solana is making good progress too. I mean, fire dancer is still far away, but, like, having apps that frequently have dedicated validators and dedicated, like their own dedicated pool of LST liquidity from, uh, from sanctum, like, that makes things a lot better too. And it's like, and this kind of like goes to why I'm, I'm like, I'm kind of anti Zk sync is like, we don't, I don't think it's a hot take either. I think, like, we have good block space. You know, like, the teams have good roadmaps. They're going to keep building those out.
00:29:03.240 - 00:29:39.252, Speaker A: Let's just ship something people actually want to use. If that's more meme coin tools, fine. If it's social fi, whatever, just try new stuff. That's all I really want to see. And to see these apps who are continuing to try and push the scalability of their block space when they don't even have demand for what they have as is. It's like, come on, guys, like, really? You raised 500 mil and this is where we're at? Like, I don't know. I don't know.
00:29:39.436 - 00:30:42.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I saw what I think is interesting. I don't want to be like super negative on Zksync, but I saw a tweet that was tracking some wallets that all made identical eth deposits at the same time for like on the same day for the. An insane amount of wallets. And I've heard rumors of other protocols who use, you know, air, like insider airdrop information as a way to have, like, employees be able to exit some of their, like, allocation. So I slowly stopped putting that much weight into this, like 17 and a half percent. But it is, it is cool to see it is going to make people happy. But in terms of like the tech and their strategy in general, what like for.
00:30:42.090 - 00:31:02.130, Speaker C: I'm going to assume that you probably Picachio, you probably know like a lot more about the tech and the research than we do. Is there, is there something like we're missing from like this is going to change the world aspect because everyone says they're going to change the world. Like, is ZK tech going to change the world?
00:31:04.510 - 00:31:43.990, Speaker B: I like ZK tech is cool, but like, one thing that I've been thinking about is that I'm not sure if tech is the difficult thing with L2. I think it's like liquidity and attention and volume and fees and revenue and everything. Like, whatever attracts capital into your ecosystem is like the most difficult bit. And that's like, I agree with you, Ali. It's like you can launch whatever tech you want, but at the end of the day, if you're not building stuff that people are interested in, it doesn't really matter that much. And on the other, like, I have two things with the ZK sync. This was the same with Starkware Darknet.
00:31:43.990 - 00:32:17.476, Speaker B: I think a, they're going to have guardrails when they initially launch. Just like we didn't have proofs on. Like, we still have centralized sequencers on Optimus and arbitrum. So it's not going to even be like the full ZK tech that everybody's like, oh, this is going to be the future. But the other thing is that as far as I understand, this might genuinely be, like, a dumb take, but as far as I understand, it's arbitrum. And, like, I know optimism is already working on ZK tech, and I'm sure that arbitrum can adopt this as well. So, like, ZK proofs aren't necessarily.
00:32:17.476 - 00:32:37.786, Speaker B: They're very expensive, and it's like, compared to fraud proofs, and they're more complicated. But you can just adopt that eventually. Like, focus on. You can't just bring in capital, though. Like, you can't just bring in users. So that's the, like, more difficult thing. Long story short, I don't think the tech will change everything.
00:32:37.786 - 00:32:46.990, Speaker B: I just feel like they're kind of building for it to look cool, but it's not necessarily useful at this point.
00:32:47.970 - 00:33:30.760, Speaker C: It's what I don't understand, and I agree with that, I think. And this, I don't know if this is totally right, but I've been seeing a lot more announcements from these. Like, I guess you can call them protocols, where they're handling the ZK proving aspect as a service. I don't know if that's going to be a way that this tech gets adopted by a bunch of other protocols without the need for something like Zksync, but from a general standpoint. Well, I'm going to ask, have you used or done anything on Zksync the last six months?
00:33:30.880 - 00:33:31.224, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:31.272 - 00:33:32.700, Speaker C: Other than airdrop? For me.
00:33:34.400 - 00:33:37.304, Speaker B: Yes, kind of. I did. Stop.
00:33:37.352 - 00:33:38.816, Speaker C: Which protocols have you used?
00:33:38.968 - 00:33:43.160, Speaker B: I, um. I think I sync swap. That's it.
00:33:43.200 - 00:33:50.160, Speaker A: That doesn't count. That's airdrop farming. That doesn't count. You can't tell me you were doing something fun on sync swap.
00:33:50.280 - 00:34:03.056, Speaker B: No, no. The thing is that there's literally nothing to do on there. Like, what am I gonna do on ZK? I think the last time anything anybody was attracted to ZK sync was Merlin. Do you guys know Merlin?
00:34:03.208 - 00:34:08.860, Speaker A: Yeah. That rugged, right? We both got my think I got. I don't know about Cedo, but I nearly did.
00:34:09.720 - 00:34:10.776, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the last.
00:34:10.848 - 00:34:11.900, Speaker C: Remember that one?
00:34:12.400 - 00:34:38.676, Speaker A: That was the one where. That was the one where digits, like, posted a thread, like, gassing it up. And he was like, he, like, mentioned the vest for the team, which was like, like 35% at TGe, and then, like three month vest, and he was like, oh, so the inveter. The team is long term. And I was like, dude, what the hell are you talking about? That's not long term. And then we, like, got into, like, a little argument about it, and then they ended up rugging, obviously. So like, you know, I was right.
00:34:38.828 - 00:34:40.292, Speaker C: What was it supposed to do?
00:34:40.436 - 00:34:50.360, Speaker A: It was a, it was a v. Three. Three dex, I think. Right. Or no, it was either that or was a camelot fork. Maybe there's a dex.
00:34:52.060 - 00:34:57.180, Speaker B: I think it was ve three. I think Velocore launched after that as a ve three as well.
00:34:57.220 - 00:34:58.300, Speaker A: And they got exploited too.
00:34:58.340 - 00:34:59.640, Speaker B: I mean, that was.
00:35:01.340 - 00:35:18.320, Speaker C: Is there like any reason or justification you can think of for not having any good dapps for a year and then doing the token? Like, is there some strategy in that that I'm just like not understanding?
00:35:20.100 - 00:35:41.860, Speaker B: I think it's like two things. First of all, I think, like, I don't, I haven't built anything. I'm not a developer. But as far as I understand, people have this sense that if you build it, they'll come. And I just don't think that's worked so far. Like the only people you really attract is mercenary. I actually really liked Kanto the way that they approached it.
00:35:41.860 - 00:35:57.110, Speaker B: They launched with some basic primitives. I don't know if you guys remember, but, like they already had lending and dex and stuff. And I think Barrett and will do something similar as well where they'll launch like a bunch of stuff enshrined. They'll have their own like perp stuff. Why are we smiling?
00:35:58.250 - 00:36:02.390, Speaker A: Anytime the comments, there's some comments coming in.
00:36:03.890 - 00:36:14.144, Speaker C: Anytime someone mentions bear chain mean all. They get flashbacks to internal arguments about what, what to do with, to do with our exposure.
00:36:14.272 - 00:36:30.736, Speaker A: With your exposure. Don't include me in this. I've been trying to convince Cedar to sell his, his Barra NFts for the better part of like, I don't know, three months now. But, uh, yeah, that's a whole. We've talked.
00:36:30.768 - 00:37:00.988, Speaker C: He did also try and tell me to sell it three before. We talked about this like a million times on the episode. You're saying, you're saying like the base level protocols. I mean, I, I disagree. I think, like if, if you do build something actually good people will come. Like the core. Like if you build a core primitive and you think it's like a tad bit better than it is on another chain.
00:37:01.044 - 00:37:01.276, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:01.308 - 00:37:19.790, Speaker C: That's not like that doesn't fit in that category. But I think if you build something new and innovative and you have like baseline level marketing per se, I do think nine times out of ten people will come. But I would agree with that.
00:37:19.830 - 00:37:24.570, Speaker B: I think they're ganging up on me now.
00:37:27.630 - 00:37:47.650, Speaker A: I just think, I just think it's kind of like it's one of those things where, like, if you don't believe in it, it's kind of like a sad world. Like, then, then, because you're, like, not that many steps away from just being fully, like, fully reductively. Like, we're just all here for straight, like, farming and incentives, you know?
00:37:47.810 - 00:37:48.258, Speaker B: No, no.
00:37:48.274 - 00:37:54.910, Speaker C: Are you saying that there's, like. No. Are you saying there was a protocol in ZK sync that was good and nobody came?
00:37:56.170 - 00:38:29.262, Speaker B: What I'm trying to say is this, is that, like, a lot of people will just build the tech and they won't do anything else. Like, you'll have some basic form of marketing, you'll have some form of appointment program, whatever. But there's no, like, blast blasted this very well. Ignore munchables, the $90 million rug. Apart from that, they did this very, very well where they actually, they didn't launch anything enshrined, but they had an entire ecosystem designed very clearly, like, from the very beginning, um, the, the, I don't know what they're called. Like the big bang program or something like that.
00:38:29.366 - 00:38:29.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:30.062 - 00:38:31.034, Speaker B: What was it?
00:38:31.182 - 00:38:31.870, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:34.010 - 00:39:04.100, Speaker B: That structure worked out well. And like, okay, blast is literally nothing special. Like, it's a fork of the, I think it's a fork of optimism or like the op stack, something. Nothing special. But they've managed to attract actual people. Like, they gave them points initially, and then now you can actually do stuff. And I think they have the only, like, I think they've had the only interesting protocols launched this year.
00:39:04.100 - 00:39:09.860, Speaker B: They haven't done well, like, a lot of them, but they're at least trying new stuff on that chain as opposed.
00:39:09.900 - 00:39:11.524, Speaker C: To, like, that's fair.
00:39:11.692 - 00:39:16.108, Speaker A: Blast has a lot of good examples. Yeah, yeah.
00:39:16.244 - 00:39:20.720, Speaker C: They have a lot of, like, new, actually interesting protocols.
00:39:21.300 - 00:40:15.466, Speaker A: They also, like, didn't do, like, they also kind of didn't follow through on some stuff. Like you said, it's just an opstack chain. But their whole thing at the beginning was like, oh, we have gas revenue and staking revenue like native staking yield, and developers can do with that as they please. And at the start, people were talking about that. And even blass was saying, if you use these features to create unique products, will reward you more with golden points, then people realize that staking yield and gas revenue is negligible unless you're a massive platform with a bunch of TVL and you let it accrue for a long period of time. And even then, the best thing you can do is giveaways and jackpots and stuff like that. It's just not as useful as they thought it would be, but they did still do a great job generating that hype.
00:40:15.466 - 00:40:22.870, Speaker A: Like, they have fantasy, they have, um. What. What else is on blast?
00:40:24.730 - 00:40:29.778, Speaker B: They did it. They had a few games. They had crypto values, which did not do very well.
00:40:29.834 - 00:40:32.550, Speaker A: They got NFT perp. That's. That's unique.
00:40:34.450 - 00:40:55.200, Speaker B: I mean, anywhere but base. I feel like it's base blast. I'm ignoring Solana and stuff now, but just like, let's only talk roll ups. It's just based on blast. Is there anything else? Like, arbitrum dominated for two years, three years, and then now it's like, what's the last time you DMT Sanko Game 21.
00:40:55.580 - 00:41:14.578, Speaker A: That's. But that's about it. Besides that, it's just mismanagement, misuse of funds, and just not like they, they just like got too comfortable in their lead and they're like, defy is gonna be the thing and we're just gonna define gaming, you know, and like, no one cares about that stuff these days, so.
00:41:14.714 - 00:41:25.830, Speaker C: So in conclusion, there's no reason, no strategy, no justification to not have a single interesting DAp on a chain that you raise 500 million for.
00:41:26.130 - 00:42:13.732, Speaker B: They should have done something, obviously. But I feel like the reason that I say that you should launch with some apps is because if you launch with the base primitives, people can't just come on and be like, oh, we're gonna launch, like, sync swap. Sync swap shouldn't exist realistically. Like, it's just, it's, it's not like the ve free remodel at least has some form of like Ponzi nomic emission style where it's like differentiated. But sync swap doesn't have that. It's literally just a regular uniswap v two fork or v three fork. So, like, if you provide these, then you do some form of like an incentive program for developers or like blast that where you go all out, you can, like, you should have some apps that aren't like just basic stuff.
00:42:13.732 - 00:42:24.052, Speaker B: But they don't do it because I think they build it. Our tech is superior. We built it, they'll come. Nobody like, but I've heard that.
00:42:24.116 - 00:42:30.742, Speaker C: I've heard that it impossible to actually build on the chain. Like, it's a terrible developer experience.
00:42:30.886 - 00:42:37.054, Speaker A: So they didn't even, they didn't even take that approach because they didn't even build it. They were. They just skipped straight to the.
00:42:37.142 - 00:42:47.262, Speaker C: I truly just don't understand it. Yeah, I truly. I truly don't understand it. I mean, I'm going to take the small airdrop I received.
00:42:47.406 - 00:43:27.740, Speaker A: I think. I think a really interesting, like, niche case study, like, with regards to ecosystem development that we're going to see hopefully soon. I don't know when their launch is, but nimble is launching on save e two. And that decision was baffling to me when they made it, because it was at the time when no one had any reason to believe that se v two was like, was like the place to be building. You know, even now, I still don't think that's anywhere near a popular opinion or. Or anything close to that. But nimble, before they announced that they were seen as a very promising project.
00:43:27.740 - 00:44:00.278, Speaker A: It's like an AI execution platform. Good backers, strong team, the whole nine yards that you look for when looking at early AI projects. The whole ritual ionet type hype, but maybe a little bit on a little bit of a smaller scale. And they chose to launch on say. And I don't think that that decision was technologically driven. I think that there's some stuff that went out that went on behind the curtains that we didn't see that got them to go and build over there. And if, like, that works out well.
00:44:00.278 - 00:44:04.450, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, yeah, probably, realistically, they probably gave them a lot of money.
00:44:05.310 - 00:44:06.166, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:06.358 - 00:44:26.440, Speaker A: But, like, if that's all it takes, like, I don't know, there. I struggle to believe that there is a valid reason for why I. Why chains that raise so much money can't get an act like a single, I don't even want to say unique app, just a single non forked app, because that's how low the bar is.
00:44:29.220 - 00:44:31.428, Speaker B: Yeah, it's.
00:44:31.604 - 00:44:50.086, Speaker C: It's. It's disappointing, I think, like, there is. Yeah, it's almost, like, inexcusable. I don't know. I'm just, like, baffled by. Because on the other side of the scale, it's like, announce every single partnership with. With Starbucks and everything, like.
00:44:50.086 - 00:45:29.890, Speaker C: Like Polygon did and just never actually go through with anything. But I was a. I was a ZK sync, you know, supporter in some senses. I believed in kind of like, the evolution of the technology and now got nothing to show for it except for, like, a little bit of an airdrop. Is there any other place that we should, or people should look towards for actual development in ZK tech? Maybe not like another chain? Maybe it's like some kind of other, like, the whole CK prover stuff, I think. Succinct.
00:45:30.050 - 00:45:47.312, Speaker A: I feel like. I feel like we've spent a ton of time talking about ZK stuff. Like, I kind of wanted to get to some of the base stuff. I know, I know. Box, spend some time on base. I wanted to, like, you know, I don't mean to cut you off, but like, we got 14 minutes here. I'd be curious.
00:45:47.312 - 00:45:58.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw, I know you mentioned like base ecosystem stuff. I don't really spend that much time there. Like, I own some friend pet. I had some meme coins. Is there anything interesting you're doing or watching over there?
00:45:58.240 - 00:46:44.118, Speaker B: I, I feel like base is the only change, like roll up at this point that has something apart from Defi that people actually use fronttech. I know people don't use that much, but as well as like, Farcaster, I feel like Farcaster now. I saw a chart this morning and I was like, oh, I got to bring this up on exit liquidity. Like, I'm going to say I'm bullish social fi, and then the chart is basically just, it's a double top on active users and it's at zero. Like it's all the way down. But I don't know, like they had such a good run. I mean, I don't know anybody else who's done well with social fi and I'm like a firm believer that it'll be a decent narrative throughout the cycle.
00:46:44.118 - 00:47:13.122, Speaker B: I just feel like it keeps coming back. But my main thing was that I actually asked this to a couple people last week, but I don't know what base beta is. I don't think they're going to launch a coin. This is what, like, I was told there won't be a base token, but I've been trying to think of like what the base beta would be and it's either Djen, arrow or friend. And I feel like it's, feel like it's djen, but what is arrow? I'm not sure. Arrow drum.
00:47:13.146 - 00:47:21.106, Speaker A: Oh, aerodrome? Aerodrome. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't think it could be like a leading meme coin?
00:47:21.178 - 00:47:42.900, Speaker B: I no like, cuz. Okay, picture this. It's six months later, everything's looking great. We're not stumbling around 70k anymore. Life is good, base ecosystem is popping and. But there's no base token, what do you think? Where do you think attention goes? Like, what do you think people are like, oh, I'm gonna buy this.
00:47:43.240 - 00:48:47.776, Speaker A: I mean, like, if you subscribe to the belief that one of base's competitive edges is the whole smart wallet thing and onboarding directly from Coinbase, then I think the argument for one meme coin, and I know you said you don't want to talk too much about meme coins so we don't have to get, because we're all sick of it. But if that's part of your thesis, then you have to imagine that the average user is going to be more likely to go and buy something like. Like, I don't even know what meme coins are on base, but some. Some base meme coin over, like, over a velodrome fork, maybe friend, pet, friend pets. Pretty, like, that's pretty normally friendly. Yeah, I was gonna say Djen's like, I feel like there's a lot of. There's too many, like, meta games there, you know? And that was kind of what was the issue with Farcaster, I think, is they did well because they were around for so long, like, so much longer than people realized there was a community on there, and it was just kind of stewing.
00:48:47.776 - 00:49:16.736, Speaker A: Like, people were still having conversations on there. Colibrium, like, doesn't have any socials except for on Farcaster. There's stuff like that going on. But, like, when it started to gain attention, it couldn't sustain it because it kind of just felt like a. Just like a lifeless social network. Like, it didn't feel like it had the same culture that CT did, had something, but it wasn't, like, wasn't, like, magnetic in the way that crypto Twitter is. So that one.
00:49:16.736 - 00:49:28.968, Speaker A: And then, you know, like, I don't even fully understand what DGen is or why it is relative to Farcaster. So that, to me, I feel like that is a stretch, but I could just be missing stuff. I don't know.
00:49:29.144 - 00:50:08.108, Speaker B: I feel like Djen is. Yeah, it's been two things. Like, yes, Farcaster has been around for really long, and the early days was so much. I feel like. I'm not sure if it was better or worse because initially it was just like, devs Eve devs talking random stuff and, like, people posting about web3, changing the world, a lot of vc talk, and then it got a little bit better. But I feel like DJ kind of ruined forecaster, but also, like, would have forecasted, never would have become as popular as it did if DJ wasn't there, because now it's like people begging for Djen tips. Djen's a tipping system for forecast.
00:50:08.108 - 00:50:34.464, Speaker B: Just in case people weren't aware is you tip people with Degen. So if Ali makes a nice post, I can be like, hey, Ali, here's 100 degen for you. And that's not working at a daily allocation, obviously. Like, people who want to farm this can just go and farm it, and it made the experience, like, really bad. But also, it would have never been that popular if people weren't giving out, like, ten grand tips to each other.
00:50:34.632 - 00:50:35.944, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay.
00:50:36.032 - 00:51:30.014, Speaker C: I never liked the farcaster community, to be honest. I thought it was always, like, really dumb, and then I saw the. Actually, I'm not even gonna get into that. I honestly, as we say it out loud, the more I kind of think it's going to be friend pet or some game fight thing. I usually hate gamefi, but I think if you're coinbase, you are really interested in having something that will show off, like, basic user metrics. And so if you get, like, a very simple game that runs on base, that can work on mobile, it's in their best interest to start talking about that very often. So I think it could be friend Peter, but I also think there's room for, like, a better game.
00:51:30.014 - 00:51:34.926, Speaker C: That game is, like, fun, but it's a lot less fun than I thought it was.
00:51:34.958 - 00:51:44.854, Speaker A: It's not that fun. I'll be honest. I kind of. I kind of like. I kind of. Yeah, it's bag bias. It's not even bag bias, because I know, I know it's not fun.
00:51:44.854 - 00:52:00.556, Speaker A: I just have a bag. It's just like, it's long and, like, it's hard to progress early on. It's. I don't know. I don't think it's that fun. But, like, it's there. You know, it's there.
00:52:00.556 - 00:52:02.800, Speaker A: It's familiar. It's. It's nostalgic.
00:52:06.740 - 00:52:38.598, Speaker B: They have Pixochi, which is a friend friend pet fork. It's, like, polished up a bit. There's EtH XY, which is backed by a 16 zenith. It's not fun as well. I think it's like one of those a 16 Z games where they had, like, money lying around and they were like, okay, like, let's put some money into gamefi, I guess. And they just chucked it around like 150 projects. I don't know if they're, like, particularly interested in Ef XY.
00:52:38.598 - 00:52:42.926, Speaker B: Their ticker is sexy as well. So it's a bit of a silly one.
00:52:42.998 - 00:52:43.470, Speaker C: What is it?
00:52:43.510 - 00:52:47.940, Speaker B: Xyz Eth X Y is the game.
00:52:48.360 - 00:52:55.580, Speaker A: That's the grid thing, right? Where you can buy grids and they, like, multiply. Or am I thinking of something else?
00:52:56.040 - 00:53:01.664, Speaker B: I think you're thinking of something else. Xy friend pet got.
00:53:01.752 - 00:53:04.872, Speaker C: I don't think I played this integrated.
00:53:04.936 - 00:53:12.180, Speaker B: Into the smart wallet, which is good. It's good news for you guys. Bags. But I don't know if that's old news. I think it might be last week.
00:53:16.590 - 00:53:24.650, Speaker C: I mean, I think it could be. Yeah, it could be. Could be a game. I don't, I just don't think it's going to be Defi.
00:53:26.910 - 00:54:05.910, Speaker A: Defi. Defy is a bear market narrative. I'm fully convinced of that now. It's, it's never, I mean, it's going to have like times where it does well, obviously, but for people like me who are not smart enough to rotate on like a week or even like a month's notice and still be profitable, like, I just, I just wouldn't be holding Defi. It's like when Defi is like what you grab like post FTX collapse when GLP is paying out like 30%, 40%, whatever, and like, fundamentals actually matter. But we're, we've crossed that line a long time ago.
00:54:08.290 - 00:54:20.842, Speaker B: It's tough though, because there are some like, things that are relatively, like hyper liquid I feel like will be an interesting one. That's Defi sanctum. I feel like it's going to be, it's launching at like 50 mil FTV on Jupiter.
00:54:20.946 - 00:54:22.130, Speaker A: So that's crazy.
00:54:22.170 - 00:54:24.346, Speaker C: Like in general, shout out to those guys.
00:54:24.498 - 00:54:48.252, Speaker B: Yeah, but I agree, like defies, I'm not sure if Defi is a bear market narrative. I just think we haven't had enough apps. Like, people don't want to launch apps. It's all about let's launch a ZKL two, let's launch some data availability thing, let's launch another roll up infrastructure. Just pay. The incentives are so good for a developer. Like if you're a dev, it's like, why the, why would I launch an app?
00:54:48.436 - 00:55:30.320, Speaker A: That's a, yeah, that's a fair take. I guess. We haven't, we haven't seen much Defi innovation and in the past year or so, um, in fairness, Defi is also super competitive. Like it's, it's pretty hard to be like, I'm going to go out there and build a perp Dex and then proceed to compete with the same attention that, um, hyper liquid has or GMX once had, or, you know, obviously uniswap. Like if you're spot, then, you know, just very, very, very difficult to get attention there. So I guess the odds are kind of stacked against them, which sucks because I don't know, me and Cedar love defy. You seem like the type of person who is pretty defy heavy at one point too.
00:55:30.320 - 00:55:35.372, Speaker A: All researchers. Yeah, all researchers at one point or another. Like, you know, they.
00:55:35.436 - 00:55:37.108, Speaker C: We all thought Frax was the future.
00:55:37.244 - 00:55:47.084, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, well, I don't know if I'd go that far, but I love Defi. Like, it's why I'm here. It's why. Yeah, it's what kept me going.
00:55:47.132 - 00:56:14.696, Speaker B: You know, infrastructure is not as fun because at most you can. You can, like, I don't know, there just isn't that much to do. At the end of the day, you feel like you're getting shafted a bit. Because, like, anytime you log something or like, you're longing something, that's 15 bill FTV. What am I gonna do there? Oh, yeah. I don't know.
00:56:14.848 - 00:56:27.340, Speaker A: You got a. You got a question here, Bach, from someone named Aidan. Are you still bullish on the cream team? Whoa, whoa. What does that mean?
00:56:29.000 - 00:56:29.820, Speaker B: That's.
00:56:32.120 - 00:56:33.140, Speaker C: A phantom.
00:56:34.200 - 00:56:37.300, Speaker B: No, I think he's talking about.
00:56:40.450 - 00:56:41.298, Speaker A: Cream finance.
00:56:41.354 - 00:56:51.482, Speaker B: Just not going to. Yeah, I think. Yeah, he's talking about. Not cream finance fold. No. What did they do to get that?
00:56:51.546 - 00:56:54.110, Speaker A: Maki's project. Machi's project.
00:56:54.530 - 00:57:05.390, Speaker B: I am not. I am not bullish on manifold Machi at all. He's like steady dumping friend. Now, he owned 10% of that coin at some point, which is ridiculous.
00:57:06.030 - 00:57:09.450, Speaker C: Was he able to. Is he able to, like, exit?
00:57:10.590 - 00:57:13.490, Speaker B: Um, I don't know.
00:57:14.990 - 00:57:16.334, Speaker C: Because he started or.
00:57:16.462 - 00:57:23.090, Speaker B: I think he sell. Like, he sold quite a bit now, but I don't know. That's a.
00:57:25.790 - 00:57:32.010, Speaker C: And they're. They're going to launch their own chain. No. Or is that a joke? You can't trust that. That intern on that account.
00:57:33.070 - 00:57:44.930, Speaker B: No, I think it's real. I don't know why. It'll be fun for them for a few weeks. We'll see. That's kind of like. I feel like V two was quite good. I don't know if you guys are big fanta people.
00:57:46.510 - 00:57:47.342, Speaker A: Not really.
00:57:47.446 - 00:57:48.734, Speaker C: I had some bags.
00:57:48.862 - 00:57:50.838, Speaker A: See, don't try to trade it. Yeah.
00:57:50.974 - 00:57:52.090, Speaker C: $5.
00:57:52.670 - 00:57:53.974, Speaker A: I never did.
00:57:54.142 - 00:57:57.090, Speaker C: I got out. I got out, you know, in the green.
00:57:57.510 - 00:58:02.754, Speaker A: I just never, just never. I could never get past the 20% fees. That was my thing.
00:58:02.882 - 00:58:05.858, Speaker C: Like, Ollie was so angry about the 20.
00:58:05.954 - 00:58:19.794, Speaker A: I was not angry about it. I was just. I was just like, how can you trust, like, fine. Like, everyone's like, oh, they're so generous. They're giving away 100% of their token. It's like, yeah, cuz they already farmed more than the total of their TVL and fees. Like, what do you.
00:58:19.794 - 00:58:28.002, Speaker A: It's like they buy back some friend and give it away. Oh, it's coming out of their own pockets. It's like, no, it's not. It's coming out of yours. It's.
00:58:28.066 - 00:58:28.610, Speaker B: It just.
00:58:28.690 - 00:58:30.510, Speaker A: It's baffling to me.
00:58:31.890 - 00:58:34.146, Speaker B: They made, like, 40 mil or something.
00:58:34.338 - 00:58:49.706, Speaker A: They. More, maybe they. I think, like a couple weeks in a couple weeks. And they surpassed their TVL even during. Even when they were, like, quite hyped up. And during V one, it was looking at. No, it took a little bit longer than that.
00:58:49.706 - 00:58:55.320, Speaker A: They. They farmed a total of 65 mil in fees, and they have less than ten mil in Tbl.
00:58:56.980 - 00:59:03.732, Speaker B: Ignoring that. Racer farmed us to death. That was at least semi fun.
00:59:03.916 - 00:59:14.980, Speaker A: Racer is hilarious. I will. I will give him that. One of the funniest guys on Twitter. He's so funny. Yeah, besides that, I'll keep following him. I'll keep.
00:59:14.980 - 00:59:31.680, Speaker A: I would love to have him on the pod someday just to yap, but, like, I wouldn't, uh, wouldn't be using that product myself. We're at time here. I don't want to keep anybody too long. And everybody's got a. Got a busy day, I'm sure. Macaccio, thanks for joining us, man. This was a lot of fun.
00:59:31.680 - 00:59:47.812, Speaker A: Really appreciate you taking the time. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Got to do it again sometime. Next, after the next big airdrop that we can fud, we'll hop on here and start arguing. Perfect.
00:59:47.812 - 00:59:51.540, Speaker A: That was exaliquidity. Episode 77. Thanks, guys.
