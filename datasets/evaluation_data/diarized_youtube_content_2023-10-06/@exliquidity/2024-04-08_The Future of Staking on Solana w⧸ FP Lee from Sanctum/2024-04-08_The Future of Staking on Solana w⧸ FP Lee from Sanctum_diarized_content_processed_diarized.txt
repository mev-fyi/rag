00:00:00.240 - 00:00:22.894, Speaker A: All right, happy Tuesday, guys. Welcome to another episode of Exit Liquidity. 58. I'm going to guess 58. 59. Somewhere around that today we have FP Lee from Sanctum, a very interesting project that we really wanted to talk about. Felt like more people needed to know about.
00:00:22.894 - 00:00:24.798, Speaker A: So, FP, thanks for joining us.
00:00:24.814 - 00:00:27.540, Speaker B: Mandy, thank you for having me.
00:00:29.040 - 00:00:58.160, Speaker A: Awesome. We usually like to start out like most other calls or podcasts do, just to hear a little bit more about you and what your background looks like. Kind of what brought you to where we're at today. I'm curious to hear, like, specifically around. When I was looking through some of your documentation, there was a pretty big emphasis on, like, the team being very, like, Solana Ogden. I'm curious as to, like, what that looked like in the early days and kind of what attracted you there.
00:00:59.660 - 00:01:25.578, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, three years ago, I started building on Solana, and I chose Solana. It wasn't like a really big brain thing. I chose it just because it was cheap and it was fast. And I think, you know, cheap and fast are really, really important. It's not just, it's not just a performance thing, but it also was like, you know, I didn't have that much money. I was like, a casual user.
00:01:25.578 - 00:01:39.346, Speaker B: And I think the idea of trying to get into ethereum, and then every swap, you've got to pay like, $100 or every nft, you have to, you know, mint paying thousands of dollars in gas, you know, I was like, okay, you know, I can't. I, you know, I don't have this much money. I'm not, I'm not willing to spend it.
00:01:39.418 - 00:01:39.674, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:39.722 - 00:02:06.060, Speaker B: But, you know, Solana being cheap, very, very cheap, very, very fast, meant that I could start. Start exploring the chain, start building on it, start buying some soul, you know, start playing with all this, you know, funny defi stuff. Get rocked as well. But, you know, it is what it is, and I think that's, that's where I got into it. And the more I got into it, the more I realized, like, okay, I think, like, this chain is going to be the future I want to build on it. And, you know, three years later. Yeah, here we are.
00:02:06.060 - 00:02:06.800, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:07.740 - 00:02:36.130, Speaker A: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. I think that that, uh, exemplifies the IQ curve meme pretty well. You know, it's like, on the left curve, it's like, cheap and fast. Right curve is like all the stuff on Solana that I probably can't even begin to explain. What about what kind of brought you to crypto in general? Like, obviously, when you got here, you know, you were attracted to Solana, but what attracted you to crypto to start out, or what's, like, your non crypto background before that?
00:02:36.600 - 00:03:14.052, Speaker B: Yeah. So I studied economics in college, and afterwards, I actually worked as a software engineer in Singapore. And I think at the time, I wasn't being sort of fully utilized at my job, so to speak. It was Covid times. I had some assignments to do, and I did them in 2 hours, and then I had lots of time. And so at the. Anyway, at the time, Solana was asking for people to build staking dashboards, dashboards for this new thing called stake pools.
00:03:14.052 - 00:03:36.856, Speaker B: And no idea what stake pools were. It's very new to crypto, but they were offering something like $20,000 or something like this if we could build a dashboard for stake pools. And I was like, okay, I don't want to build a dashboard. I'm an engineer. I was like, it'll only take me two weeks. I built it. But then of one thing led to another, right? So we built the dashboard.
00:03:36.856 - 00:04:16.594, Speaker B: But before we finished the dashboard, we realized, okay, like, okay, this is a dashboard for state pools, right? And then I asked Solana, I was like, you know, do we have any stake pools yet? And they're like, oh, no. And I was like, when are they coming? I was like, oh, we don't know. Sometime in the future. I was like, what's the point of building a dashboard for something that doesn't exist? And so we thought, okay, well, maybe we can help to build the stake pool, you know? And, you know, so, so we were helping to build the state pool, and we realized, oh, okay, um, this code isn't quite ready that, you know, there's this exploit. This exploit we found sort of some. Some buggy sort of edge cases. You know, they was like, oh, you know, those are some good suggestions.
00:04:16.594 - 00:04:48.920, Speaker B: And. And at that point, we were, like, three months in, you know, and we were like, okay, you know, we know this program, like, back to front. We helped even to write some of it. Like, why don't we launch a stake pool, right? And I was like, okay, we'll just launch it and, you know, make, you know, put some soul in it and make a couple, you know, a couple, couple grand or whatever. And then sort of one thing led to another, really. And so we thought it would take two, two weeks, and then it take two months, and then, so now three years, like, we're still here, so, you know, funny how things go. Yeah, yeah.
00:04:49.220 - 00:05:06.880, Speaker D: You mentioned a bit about, you know, some of the, some of the rugs you've been a part of the show is called exit liquidity. We like to ask some of the founders, what was a story or your favorite moment of you being exit liquidity that kind of represents your journey in the space?
00:05:07.220 - 00:05:35.156, Speaker B: Oh, that's a good question. So I'm like a Defi guy. So I really bought into the hype for some of this defi stuff. One of my good, uh, good friends was like, oh, om is like such a, you know, big brain thing. Do you guys remember om? Like, like olympus? Yeah, yeah. And I was like, I read the documentation, like, like five times through. I was like, this doesn't make sense.
00:05:35.156 - 00:05:54.624, Speaker B: But, you know, like, maybe they know something that I don't. And so we just went in, you know, like ten k, put it in. And, yeah, I was absolutely. Exit liquidity held it all the way to zero. I don't know why I did that. But, you know, I thought, okay, you know, it's so big brain, you know, this. It must make sense somehow.
00:05:54.624 - 00:05:58.032, Speaker B: And I think the lesson there is to sort of trust your instincts.
00:05:58.096 - 00:05:58.296, Speaker C: Right?
00:05:58.328 - 00:06:35.482, Speaker B: Like, if, you know, if I think it's a bad deal, like I should trust myself. Right. Yeah, that was one. And I think what was another one? I think there was, you know, there were a lot of sort of defi projects that I saw put in back in the Solana days. And I will say, as an aside, that I think the quality of projects, like back in 2021 versus now in 2024, there's a big difference. Like the quality of founders. Just candidly, right, back in 2021, there were a lot of founders who were there just for the money or just for just running semi rocks or outright rugs.
00:06:35.482 - 00:06:52.840, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys know Parrot finance. This was back in 2021. They did this like 100 million sort of ideal, and then they basically just cut it and left with all the money. So it was like a serious, serious rug. I didn't put money in there. But anyway, sorry. The point is.
00:06:52.840 - 00:07:21.200, Speaker B: The point is that in 2021, the projects were kind of dubious. But I think if you look at the top projects now in the Solana space, I really think that these guys are really here to build, especially because a lot of them were forged in the bear. So a lot of these mercenary founders have been washed out by that one year of Solana being really down in the dumps.
00:07:22.620 - 00:07:49.950, Speaker D: Yeah, three years is a pretty long time, especially in this space. And to be kind of fully in on the Solana ecosystem during those hard times that you just mentioned, you touched on kind of the founders and the quality of founders at that time versus now. What were some other, like, noticeable differences or moments from when you kind of first joined the Solana ecosystem to where we are now?
00:07:50.450 - 00:08:49.338, Speaker B: That's a, that's a good question as well. I think in 2021, Solana was, I think, relatively new, right? So I remember it was trading at like a dollar or something, and then it went up to ten and then it went up 30, and then it got like, huge wave of attention, because obviously price drives everything, right, in this, in this industry. And I think a lot of that, a lot of the projects, like, there was a lot of interest, there were a lot of projects building and a lot of it, to be frank, it was basically the pitch to VC's were like, oh, we're building this botan Solana and where sort of x would be something on ethereum, right? So, in fact, this is, I'll be frank, like how we pitched it as well. We didn't know anything about liquid staking. We didn't know really much about soft stake pools. I mean, we did as we went. But really, the idea, including sort of how the Solana foundation and Solana labs thought about it, was like, okay, let's just take the lido staking model and let's just copy it on Solana.
00:08:49.338 - 00:09:55.698, Speaker B: So we're basically saying, okay, this is Lido on, on Solana, right? And then people were fighting to be Lido and Solana, right? And it's not just this as well, right, because if you think about the sort of like borrow lending, right? That's again, you know, it's basically like a translation from ethereum to Solana, right? Like, you know, same thing with the, with the LP's, with the swaps and stuff, right? So, you know, a lot of that, it wasn't real innovation, if I can say. This was just, you know, a copy and paste job from Ethereum, right? And that's kind of how the first wave of projects come out. And I think three years from now, particularly in bear, you have founders really thinking hard about what do these primitives actually look like? How should they look like on Solana? Because it's completely different chain. You don't have these gas concerns. First of all, it's fast, it's cheap. I know best for me, I speak from the staking perspective. I can tell you that staking on Solana, just fundamentally with the idea of stake accounts and all of this stuff is very, very different.
00:09:55.698 - 00:10:18.252, Speaker B: Like, you know, how long is the cooldown, how long does it take to withdraw? Right? All of these stuff, like, all this stuff affects the primitives that you develop, right? And it's the same not just for staking, but for everything else. And so we're seeing lots of very, very interesting projects nowadays, which are not just aping what it's like on Ethereum, but actually trying to innovate, you know, on the basis of, like, Solana.
00:10:18.316 - 00:10:18.516, Speaker C: Right?
00:10:18.548 - 00:10:24.200, Speaker B: What, how would you build from first principles something on Solana? Does that make sense?
00:10:26.260 - 00:11:03.090, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, 100%. Um, I think that's a lot of what, um, you know, for those who, like, still stuck around paying attention to the ecosystem over, I guess, like pretty much after the whole ftx blow up. Um, that was, at least for me, that was like the saving grace is that there were like, teams there building cool things, building unique things. Um, and, you know, obviously that hasn't slowed down now at all. Quite the contrary, actually. Um, I would like to get into sanctum a little bit here. Um, sort of, if you could just describe from a high level what exactly it is you guys are looking to do.
00:11:03.090 - 00:11:14.330, Speaker A: Um, but more specifically, like, looking at it from the backdrop of the problem you're trying to solve. So, like, if you could explain what the problem is and kind of how, how sanctum's addressing it.
00:11:15.350 - 00:11:24.342, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Um, yeah, so the problem really we're trying to fight is that of centralization. And let me explain.
00:11:24.406 - 00:11:24.630, Speaker C: Right?
00:11:24.670 - 00:12:28.028, Speaker B: So from what I've observed, ethereum is doomed. Um, it really, you know, I know this is kind of like a hot take, right? But I think ethereum is doomed and solana still has a chance, right? So the reason I say this is because, you know, liquid staking. This is the reason I think liquid staking on ethereum is the reason why Ethereum is going to go down, like, go down a very dark path. We have Ethereum and Solana is a proof of stake network, right? And whoever controls the stake controls the network. This is by definition, right? This is, you know, you can't argue with this, right? And we have Lido, who has for longest time controlled almost one third of the stake, or probably one third already, right? And, you know, we know for a fact, at least theoretically, one third, you know, if whoever controls one third of the. Of the soul can base, sorry, of the stake, not the soul of the stake, can basically hold the network. This is a liveness violation.
00:12:28.028 - 00:13:16.050, Speaker B: Now, this is a theoretical concern, and it may not happen in the future, but nonetheless, whoever controls this one third of stake controls the network. And you have this Lido token, ldl token, as a governance layer on the whole of the network. And this is not how it should be, but you have people who are, you know, buying in, who have large bags of lido as a governance layer, who can basically dictate what Ethereum is, right? It's a governance layer that nobody asks for or nobody wants. So that's what we're fighting against, right? We're fighting against. We're fighting against stake inevitably centralizing towards one entity which represents an existential threat to any blockchain.
00:13:16.170 - 00:13:16.714, Speaker C: Right?
00:13:16.842 - 00:13:24.940, Speaker B: And I. I think Ethereum is a cautionary tale on what could happen to Solana if we don't fight against it. Does it make sense?
00:13:26.560 - 00:13:57.870, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, totally. I think. I think lots of people, especially in our audience, are familiar with the, with the issue of, I guess like Lido. I mean, I want to say stake decentralization, but just Lido centralization. And then even when you take it a step further and you look at like, who the, like three or four biggest stakers are, there, even like the individual stakers, that it is quite, quite concentrated. How does that, like, issue, or I guess, does that issue exist on Solana to a similar extent?
00:13:58.690 - 00:14:50.002, Speaker B: So that's exactly kind of what we're fighting against, right? So let's first, you know, let me just explain a little bit why sort of decentralization happens, right? Like why, you know, why. Why do we think it's inevitable? And I think the core reason, if you have to distill it down, is that liquidity is a positive feedback loop. Liquidity leads to more liquidity, which leads to more liquidity, which leads to more liquidity because you have this LST. And what's the purpose of an LST? The whole point of an LST is to be liquid. So you need to have a liquidity pool, and what it looks like is a uniswap or whatever, some sort of LPD. The bigger that gets, the safer it is to put, you know, to deposit into lido, right into that particular LSD, because you know that there's now a deep pool of liquidity. But that, in turn, right, drives organic demand for that LSD, for that LP.
00:14:50.002 - 00:15:58.490, Speaker B: And so it just centralizes, because the bigger you are, the safer it is, which means the more people deposit, which means the bigger your LP gets and so on and so forth, right? So liquidity inevitably leads to centralization, and it also means that you have this huge liquidity mode. And that's why any kind of new entrants will have to fight, at least put up millions of dollars in capital to at least be competitive with this liquidity pool. So this is why I think that if we don't do anything on Solana that we will inevitably look at, basically, we will go down that path and we will get a one entity controlling all the stake. So what are we doing exactly? We are fighting against this kind of centralization by building a unified liquidity infrastructure. Basically, we are combining liquidity into one unified whole. And what that does is that it tears down the barriers to entry. So you don't need to have millions of dollars to just start your own LST.
00:15:58.490 - 00:16:28.228, Speaker B: You're leveling the playing field so that even if you're something, it's not about how deep your pockets are, but it's about how much value you deliver to your stakers. And with this unified infrastructure, we're driving switching costs down from one LST to another LST to near zero. And this basically means that you don't have that same centralization feedback loop. You don't have that liquidity mode. And also, you've got lots more innovation at the LST level.
00:16:28.284 - 00:16:28.596, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:28.668 - 00:16:35.400, Speaker B: Without having to have high barriers to entry, millions of dollars even, just to try out your new idea. So that's what we're doing at centum.
00:16:38.420 - 00:17:13.050, Speaker D: Yeah, I think. Could you paint a picture from a very high level on what staking on Solana currently looks like? You don't have to get too technical, but just so people have a. I think people understand the eth staking mechanisms and the way validators kind of fall into that process. But I think people don't have a similar understanding with Solana. So could you break that down and maybe touch on maybe the largest stakes or largest lsts on Solana currently?
00:17:14.270 - 00:17:20.650, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So are you asking about how native staking works or how liquid staking works in particular?
00:17:21.070 - 00:17:24.130, Speaker D: I think you're going to have to explain both and the differences.
00:17:25.030 - 00:17:30.590, Speaker B: Okay, cool. So let's just talk about soft native staking. Right, which is that sort of non liquid staking.
00:17:30.670 - 00:17:30.958, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:31.014 - 00:17:40.640, Speaker B: And this is, you can think about, you know, putting your. You have gold bars, which is. That's like sol, and then you're putting it in a vault. Right, and my bank vault. And so if you're locking it up.
00:17:40.720 - 00:17:41.080, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:41.160 - 00:17:51.416, Speaker B: And, um, so, and here's where the analogy breaks down, because gold doesn't multiply itself if you put it in the vault. But, you know, uh, in this sort of magical vault, you put the gold bar in.
00:17:51.448 - 00:17:51.640, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:51.680 - 00:17:52.736, Speaker B: And you get more gold bars.
00:17:52.768 - 00:17:52.912, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:52.936 - 00:18:10.270, Speaker B: As you go. Um, and then, so, you know, imagine it's this big vault deep underground. You know, every time you've got to retrieve it, you've got to wait two days. You've got to go down, you know, unlock it, and takes a long time. That's what staking is, right. So you're locking it your. You're locking the gold bar into the vault to get more returns.
00:18:10.270 - 00:18:42.412, Speaker B: But in return, you're sort of giving up the ability to access it immediately. So that's native staking for you. And so a little bit of a technical detail is that when you are staking, you're choosing a validator to stake two. But that's not so relevant to our discussion right now. So that's native staking, locking it. Your gold bars into a vault. And what liquid staking is, is that it's the same mechanism, right? It's locking your gold bars into a vault.
00:18:42.412 - 00:18:55.600, Speaker B: But in. In return, the protocol. You're giving it to the protocol, which then locks the gold bars into their vault. And in return, the protocol gives you, like, a piece of paper. And this is like an IOu, or like, you know, like. Like a. Like a piece of paper money.
00:18:55.600 - 00:18:58.556, Speaker B: And that's that piece of paper money we call the LST.
00:18:58.708 - 00:18:59.236, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:59.348 - 00:19:17.040, Speaker B: So the idea is that the paper is redeemable for the gold bars in the vault. But you don't want to redeem it. What you want to do is you want to use it in defi. You want to trade it around. You want to do all of that stuff. Because it's very hard to trade gold bars in a vault. But it's very easy to trade this piece of paper.
00:19:17.040 - 00:19:33.176, Speaker B: Does that make sense? This is the difference between staking and liquid staking. So notice that in liquid staking, we think often about liquid staking as state pools. And we conflate these two, but they're actually not the same.
00:19:33.248 - 00:19:33.624, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:33.712 - 00:19:47.816, Speaker B: So liquid staking is just this process of having, sort of taking the paper out of the vault. I'm sorry, issuing a paper for issuing the IOU, for gold bars that are in the vault. But that says nothing about who are you delegating to? Who are you staking to?
00:19:47.848 - 00:19:47.992, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:48.016 - 00:20:16.614, Speaker B: This is a completely different sort of concept. Now, in a state pool, what the protocol does when you give them your gold. Is that they distribute it to different sort of validators. They stake it to different validators. Maybe hundreds or 50 or 20 or whatever it may be, in different proportions. But you don't have to do that, really. You could delegate it to one validator like a single validator, your own validator, for example, there's no reason why you want to split, why you would split your stake this way.
00:20:16.614 - 00:20:34.010, Speaker B: And so these are what we call single validator lsds or single validator tokens, which are essentially the same thing as lsts, except on the backend. Instead of delegating to hundreds of validators, you're delegating to one. So that's the difference. And I hope that makes sense.
00:20:35.670 - 00:21:15.766, Speaker D: Yeah, that helps a lot. And so currently, I'd say I'm not too Solana. Ali is the resident Solana guy here. I've been wrong about Solana for months now, so he really saved our podcast on that end. But the lsts, I guess that could come to mind initially for me, would be LST, msoul, judo soul. Are those the bigger, the biggest players in this game? And then could you talk about the different, uh, decentralization levels, um, in some of the top ones, sure.
00:21:15.878 - 00:21:32.142, Speaker B: So let me. So the top three by, um. Let's talk about top four, because you mentioned LST. So top one is the large. Sorry. Um, the largest one by TVL is Jito Soul. Um, this is a staple ran by Jitto, you know.
00:21:32.142 - 00:21:52.798, Speaker B: Yeah, by jitto. Um, and, um, they. The tagline is mev powered staking returns, but that's actually not an accurate tagline. And I can go into why then. Second is marinate. So Mso. And I think their shtick is that they are very decentralized.
00:21:52.798 - 00:22:19.434, Speaker B: They have a good delegation strategy. They delegate to lots of validators, and they are very careful thinking about how to support hundreds of validators. So that's the second one, solace. I think what's special about Solblaze is that it's very community based. So we have a high. It's not VC backed, it's high token float. And he's very generous with the rewards.
00:22:19.434 - 00:22:44.996, Speaker B: So the token is very well distributed, and he's very generous with giving this out. So it's a true sort of community staple. So it's a good choice as well. Um, so all of these three delegate to, like, lots of validators. And then fourth on the list is LST. This is the one by Margin Phi. And the special thing about Marginfi's LST is that it has zero fees and it also delegates to only the marginfi validators.
00:22:45.108 - 00:22:45.356, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:45.388 - 00:22:51.372, Speaker B: So they. I think they, they spun up like, two different validators of both of which are their own.
00:22:51.476 - 00:22:51.740, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:51.780 - 00:23:01.208, Speaker B: And they don't, you know, they don't claim to be decentralizing. Stake. That's not, that's not what they care about. They care about giving their stakers, like, top tier apy.
00:23:01.304 - 00:23:01.536, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:01.568 - 00:23:05.500, Speaker B: That's. That's the idea. So these are the largest four? Yeah.
00:23:07.360 - 00:23:28.298, Speaker A: Why? Uh, I'm not too familiar. I mean, I know there was some, like, drama recently, actually, actually this week, I think with, with Jito and Judo soul. Why would it not necessarily be like a. An MeV protected? Or I guess, you know, what. What's the claim they make and what's wrong with it?
00:23:28.474 - 00:23:42.818, Speaker B: So, to be clear, the claim is not wrong, not incorrect. I just want to make that clear. It's. I think it's a little bit more like misleading marketing. Right. So Jitto says it's mev powered staking rewards.
00:23:42.914 - 00:23:43.218, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:43.274 - 00:23:52.448, Speaker B: And that kind of implies that it's the only LST or the, you know, that gives Mev powered staking rewards. Right. You know, that's kind of the idea.
00:23:52.504 - 00:23:53.100, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:53.640 - 00:24:26.242, Speaker B: And many people don't know this, but in fact, all of the lsts give me the powered staking rewards. And, you know, and, you know, people say, oh, but if I go to Jiro, I'll get Mev rewards. Yes. But also, if you go to any other of these staples, you also get the MeV rewards. So it's kind of like, it's kind of backwards claim. And the reason is because the way that Jiro distributes its MEV rewards is actually through the validators itself, and the validators themselves can decide whether or not to sort of kick back the MeV rewards. So that goes at the level of the validator.
00:24:26.242 - 00:24:54.702, Speaker B: And so we've actually helped to set up, like, six new lsts with lots of new validators. And one of them. One of them is giving up 50% of block rewards plus Mev rewards. So this is very common. Another one's giving out, like 10% and so on and so forth. So it's actually, and many validators, in fact, are giving out Mev rewards to their stakers. So it's not the case that Jira Sol is the only place in which you can get Mev rewards.
00:24:54.702 - 00:25:12.130, Speaker B: It's a place, and I think they run. They have a really, really good sort of moat with their MeV client, which is really, really smart. But it's not if you're staking into digital soul stake pool because you want to get me view boards. That's not correct. Yeah.
00:25:13.660 - 00:25:20.080, Speaker A: Okay, I see. Yeah. They did a very good job on the marketing front then, because I was certainly not aware of that.
00:25:21.180 - 00:25:23.060, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, more power to them.
00:25:23.100 - 00:25:23.276, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:23.308 - 00:25:31.852, Speaker B: Like it's. Yeah, yeah. I think it's, it's an accurate statement. I wouldn't dare to say, you know, they're not lying or anything. It is true. It's Mev powered. It's just not exclusively geo sold.
00:25:31.852 - 00:25:33.440, Speaker B: It's Mev powered. Yeah.
00:25:34.020 - 00:26:08.780, Speaker A: Okay, that's interesting. Cool. So now that we have, I think we have like a yemenite, a pretty bare bones understanding of like kind of what the space looks like and the problem here. And obviously, like, what sanctum is hoping to do from a high level. I'm interested to hear about your products. As far as I know, there is the Sanctum reserve, there's the infinity LST, and then there's the sanctum router. Can you explain what each of those things are? Maybe how they, how they work to other, just I guess like each component?
00:26:09.560 - 00:26:35.304, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I think, um. Let me, so before I get into the nitty gritty details, right, let me just say that all the three, three products are trying to solve that one inherent problem, right? Which is that, um, you know, which is that liquidity is a mold, right? So if you've got a big investment from, you know, some very deep pocket VC's, it's easy for you to get lots of liquidity, right? And that inevitably leads to its centralization through the mechanism that I mentioned.
00:26:35.352 - 00:26:35.970, Speaker C: I.
00:26:36.160 - 00:27:22.100, Speaker B: And what we're really trying to do is we're really trying to break this mode, just destroy it. And so all of our products are meant to basically unify the liquidity and make it accessible to small LSD's. So let's first talk about how lP's work, how liquidity pools work. Before sanctum, you have orca, radium, saber pools, whatever. And this would be usually, let's say, msoul Sol, right? So two assets. And what the idea is that if you've got holding MSO and you want to go, you want to do an instant unstake, you would go through these liquidity pools. There would just be a swap on a stable swap pool.
00:27:22.100 - 00:27:31.030, Speaker B: And of course the larger that would be, the larger that is, the safer your stakers become, because now it's backed by more liquidity.
00:27:31.160 - 00:27:31.858, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:32.034 - 00:27:53.922, Speaker B: And all of this was the most important thing is that all of this was like separate. If you have St Sol or if you have Jiro soul, you cannot go from, you know, like, there's no way you can go from sort of like you cannot borrow the liquidity pool of marinates. Like you have to. You have to make your own right. And so what router does is that it basically unifies all of this stuff.
00:27:53.986 - 00:27:54.186, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:54.218 - 00:28:25.824, Speaker B: So it allows you to go as if from magic, from zero sold to MSO, and from MSOl to be sold, and from any LST to any other LST. What that means is that if you have a single LSD that is very small, it has maybe a couple thousand bucks in a sable pool. So that usually would be quite useless. But with the router, it unifies the liquidity. So you can go from your LST to amsoil and then borrow the millions of dollars of liquidity in that pool and in any other LSD pool.
00:28:25.872 - 00:28:26.296, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:26.408 - 00:28:30.672, Speaker B: And this is not just good for small LSD, it's good for the whole ecosystem as well.
00:28:30.736 - 00:28:30.936, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:30.968 - 00:28:44.528, Speaker B: Because now these lsts don't have to fight for, like, oh, I need to ensure liquidity in my LST. And as long as the pool of LST liquidity grows in general, then this is good for everybody.
00:28:44.584 - 00:28:45.064, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:45.192 - 00:28:49.580, Speaker B: It makes all these liquid staking tokens much more liquid. Does that make sense?
00:28:50.740 - 00:29:00.356, Speaker D: Yeah. Could you describe. Well, I want to take your word for it that it's a magic. But could you explain maybe some of the mechanics.
00:29:00.468 - 00:29:01.124, Speaker B: Sure.
00:29:01.292 - 00:29:02.516, Speaker D: Of how that would work.
00:29:02.628 - 00:29:03.724, Speaker B: Sure. Happy to do that.
00:29:03.812 - 00:29:04.108, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:04.164 - 00:29:41.950, Speaker B: So the trick is that LST's are wrappers over stake accounts. And stake accounts are the fundamental unit of stake on Solana. Okay. So this is very different from what it looks like on eth. And the idea is that when you have m soul or when you have Jiro soul, these are just wrappers. Imagine you have a suite in the middle, and you've just got a wrapper on top. And so what we do, how we do it is that we just unwrap the first wrapper that says m soul, and then we put another wrapper on that says jiro Sol.
00:29:41.950 - 00:30:08.370, Speaker B: And this is how you can transfer the stake from one LST to another. Yeah. So that's kind of how we do it more technically. It's just we take a stake account. Sorry, we take MSO. Let's say you want to go from Msoul to Jirozo. So we take the msoul, we do a withdrawal, we unwrap the MSO into get a stake account, and then we deposit the stake account into the new LSD.
00:30:08.370 - 00:30:16.416, Speaker B: And to get the. That new LST, like, put the wrapper on. A new wrapper on, and then you can go to the, you know, the different LP pools.
00:30:16.568 - 00:30:16.880, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:16.920 - 00:30:17.936, Speaker B: Does that make sense?
00:30:18.128 - 00:30:23.376, Speaker D: Yeah. And that's all happening in seconds, in one transaction.
00:30:23.488 - 00:30:28.960, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely. It's like atomic, right? You can go, you know, and with Jupyter, right. Jupyter is like insane router.
00:30:29.000 - 00:30:29.176, Speaker C: Right?
00:30:29.208 - 00:30:43.116, Speaker B: So, you know, it's not just one wrapper, right. You can. You can split it into four and then wrap with four different ones. And then, you know, like, you can go. Each of them can go to a liquidity. Different liquidity pool. So, you know, it's all very complicated, but, yeah, it just all works in a single transaction.
00:30:43.116 - 00:30:45.980, Speaker B: Yeah. Which. Which in Solana takes, like, seconds.
00:30:46.020 - 00:30:46.220, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:46.260 - 00:31:06.640, Speaker D: So, yeah. And in the pool itself. So the creation of that original pool that everything is routed through, is that where your guys is? I want to call it an LST comes in. Like, people that kind of go from sold to that LST contribute to that pool.
00:31:06.800 - 00:31:20.488, Speaker B: Right. So that's a slightly different product. So what I've described now is the router, right? So the router is basically the claw. You know, a special claw that sort of, you know, unwraps and wraps and unwraps and wraps and therefore soft shares the liquidity pool.
00:31:20.544 - 00:31:20.760, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:20.800 - 00:31:49.382, Speaker B: So that that is okay. That that does work. The building next, or what we've just launched, is in the infinity pool, right. And the infinity pool, um, you can think of it as an LP that has all the lsts in it, right. Um, and so, you know, basically, just think of it as, like a multi asset LP, right. So, like something like curve, I guess, for stable coins, but a little bit different. And, you know, so basically this, you know, there's.
00:31:49.382 - 00:32:19.136, Speaker B: There's no unwrapping needed here. Right. You can just go from any LST inside the pool to any other LST inside the pool. So it's a different mechanism, but it's cheaper because when you do this unwrap that I mentioned with the router, you do have to pay a fee to the stake pool for doing this withdrawal. The idea of infinity is that it cuts that fee to zero. Basically, by not doing this unwrapping, you're able to get much cheaper rates. Infinity just let you go from any LsT to any other LST within the pool.
00:32:19.136 - 00:32:23.438, Speaker B: So if there's ten different lsts, then you get 100 different swaps.
00:32:23.494 - 00:32:23.974, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:24.102 - 00:32:25.686, Speaker B: Well, you know, something like this.
00:32:25.718 - 00:32:25.886, Speaker C: Right?
00:32:25.918 - 00:32:34.810, Speaker B: So ten times ten. Yeah. It's not quite. It's not quite that. But you can think of it like this, right, because you've got, you know, every single pair of the 1010 assets. Yeah.
00:32:36.430 - 00:33:05.360, Speaker A: Is that a. Is that. I'm not 100% sure, because I haven't looked into these guys in a while, but is that kind of similar to what unsheathed was doing back? I think they've pivoted since then, but it was, it was, I think, a similar concept in that they had their own LsT that was backed by a pool of five or six some lsts that they would just try and maintain a healthy ratio of all of them to each other. Is that kind of similar to what's going on here?
00:33:06.420 - 00:33:13.040, Speaker B: I'm not so familiar with what unsheathed is doing, but it does sound similar. Yeah. What chain was this on?
00:33:13.620 - 00:33:35.090, Speaker A: This was on Ethereum. Yeah, I think, uh, maybe on arbitram as well. Um, so if I. If I. If I go to, like, the sanctum website right now and I want to deposit some of my m soul and receive, um, infinity in, uh, in return, what does that process look like on the back end? When I deposit my m soul, what happens to it?
00:33:35.710 - 00:33:42.684, Speaker B: Um, yeah, so that's, that's pretty, that's pretty straightforward. When you deposit the amsoil, that goes straight into the infinity pool.
00:33:42.772 - 00:33:43.400, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:43.900 - 00:34:02.036, Speaker B: And then you're done. Right. So what we do on the backend, right. Is like, we may do some rebalancing, right? So if we have seen, like, I mean, so, you know, if you have too much msoul in the pool, lots of people depositing MSOL, it does no good if, like, this pool has, like, only one asset because it can't do any trading this way.
00:34:02.068 - 00:34:02.236, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:02.268 - 00:34:09.618, Speaker B: So, you know, we may sort of rebalance it so that we get a nicer sort of distribution so that it can service more.
00:34:09.754 - 00:34:10.410, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:10.570 - 00:34:20.550, Speaker B: It can service more. More trades. Yeah. But we, you know, we can do that via an economic mechanism or via the actual sort of wrapping and unwrapping mechanism that I told you about.
00:34:22.690 - 00:34:32.934, Speaker D: Okay. I think. I think you're doing a great job of explaining those things. Again, we're usually an eccentric show, so.
00:34:33.082 - 00:34:33.534, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:33.622 - 00:34:54.410, Speaker D: Appreciate that explanation. Someone in the comments has asked about incentives for holding infinity. So they're referencing like, I think, bonk soul. You know, you earn bonk for holding bonk soul, apparently. Will there be similar incentives for infinity?
00:34:55.110 - 00:35:28.750, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, we helped Bong Sol set up this. Sorry. We helped Bong set up bong solutions, gotten lots of organic interest because people just love bonk. People want to support the project. So we're really happy that they are getting lots of traction. We haven't announced anything yet, but I can say that we're working with our partners to try and get basically to make sure that INF holders get something, too.
00:35:28.750 - 00:35:29.470, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:31.690 - 00:35:43.990, Speaker A: Wait, can we. I know that the token stuff's fun to talk about, but there's a bonk soul that, like, you earn bonk for. For holding a bonk or for holding an LST.
00:35:44.770 - 00:36:09.880, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, this is something that we're really, really proud of, right? Because. So, you know, we've built all of this liquidity, right? This unified liquidity layer. And it's not just, the idea is that it's not just helping the existing Jiro Sol MSO. These incumbents, they are big enough. They don't really need help. What we really want to help is that we want, with this infrastructure, all these kind of small lsts become viable.
00:36:09.880 - 00:36:36.352, Speaker B: Because again, if you think about Ethereum, if you want to make any headway, you have to pony up millions of dollars in base liquidity. That's hard. That's really hard. As you grow bigger and bigger, you have to pump even more capital in. But we've solved that. Now, that is a done problem. You can go from any LST to any other LST, and you can get lots.
00:36:36.352 - 00:36:55.036, Speaker B: Big trades, no slippage, whatever. So that's what we've done. And what that implies is that you can spin up tiny lsts. Tiny lsts that don't have any native liquidity. You don't even have to spin up an LP of your own. You don't have to pay up millions or even hundreds of dollars. You can just spin up the LSD.
00:36:55.036 - 00:37:23.150, Speaker B: And we work very closely with all these products to spin these ones up. So we have bong sol, compass soul, drift soul, supersoul power soul. So we've got tons and more are coming. And the reason all of these can just work from day one is precisely because of why we have built this unified liquidity layer. So if you guys want to do exit liquidity, sold. Okay. I mean, that's not a great name, but, like, exit sol.
00:37:23.150 - 00:37:23.638, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:37:23.694 - 00:37:23.934, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:23.982 - 00:38:01.280, Speaker B: Like, you could just spin one up and you would be like. You would be guaranteed that. Yeah. You know, you would have deep liquidity, right? If someone wanted to ape in like a million, and then they changed their mind, they want to sell it off. Like, that's no problem for that, right? So, and you know, this, this unified liquidity layer, you know, we've seen, we've seen so much innovation in the past one month, right, from, you know, as I said, you know, like, all these projects spinning up their own lsts, each of them having their own idea of what they want to do with their stake. So bonk dropping bonk rewards, right. Other people dropping different rewards, right? We've seen more innovation in one month than we've seen, like, in the fucking whole history of ethereum, you know, like, with Lido.
00:38:01.280 - 00:38:02.740, Speaker B: Like, that's. That's crazy.
00:38:04.480 - 00:38:14.022, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Is. Is there no, there's no, like, uh. I mean, I guess just from your tone, it sounds like the answer is no. But there's no, like, limit I or anything to this. Like, if I.
00:38:14.022 - 00:38:34.974, Speaker A: If I wanted to go and spin up, like, Alisol and I wanted to take, like, a 0.5% commission on that, whatever, like, I could do that with. You guys have deep liquidity, like, you know, share it with all of my followers and friends, have them, you know, ask them to hold Alisol instead of Jito soul or m soul or whatever. And I could, you know, earn revenue off of that if I wanted to.
00:38:35.102 - 00:38:36.654, Speaker B: Absolutely. Absolutely.
00:38:36.702 - 00:38:48.658, Speaker D: How deep is it? How deep is that liquidity? Day one. So you use the million as an example. I'm kind of curious what the top end of that looks like. Or is a million kind of like.
00:38:48.674 - 00:39:01.554, Speaker B: The top end, like day one if you go to. So let's. Let's. You know, let's look at, for example, like, if you just type on Jupiter, right? You've got, you know, let's type like bong Solen.
00:39:01.602 - 00:39:02.190, Speaker C: Right?
00:39:02.650 - 00:39:10.650, Speaker B: Let me. Let me. Let me just look at that. Right, so you can do. I'm typing the numbers in right now, right. You can do, like. Yeah, like millions.
00:39:10.650 - 00:39:19.582, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you can do. I think maybe like, over 10 million. I think. Yeah. So I.
00:39:19.646 - 00:39:23.810, Speaker A: With what kind of. Is there slippage or price impact to that at all?
00:39:24.750 - 00:39:37.212, Speaker B: I mean, yes, there will be price impact, but I think it's. It's not. So, basically, we have this reserve pool, right? And the reserve pool has 200,000 sold in it, which I think current price is, like, $30 million.
00:39:37.276 - 00:39:37.476, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:37.508 - 00:40:04.060, Speaker B: And that will. That will service your thing with, like, less than 5% slippage at the top end, right. If you're doing smaller amounts, it's like, you know, 30 bps, 50 bibs, ten bips, you know, five bit, depending on how large the amount is. Yeah. So. So at the positive, like, if you wipe out, like, 30 million of that, right, then, you know, it will cost you, like, 500 bps, but if you're doing, like, 3 million, it will cost you, like, 30 bits at the most. Yeah.
00:40:05.920 - 00:40:33.560, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, that's a. That's a very, very exciting vision. I think it's it's kind of coming together now, for sure. I want to, you talked a little bit about incentives. I'm curious as to, like. So obviously, the, the whole goal here is to kind of maintain a, maintain decentralization across lsts, kind of avoid what we've seen happen in ethereum and other issues that might come as a result.
00:40:33.560 - 00:40:44.360, Speaker A: What about sanctum itself? Like, what's the path to decentralization look like for you guys? And, like, how far off are we from that?
00:40:45.260 - 00:41:03.506, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. So for us, right, it's been, you know, we are in no hurry to rush it away. And I have, you know, like, I have been building here for three years, and I think if I were a little bit more mercenary, I definitely would have launched it, like, a long time ago.
00:41:03.578 - 00:41:03.834, Speaker C: Right?
00:41:03.882 - 00:41:11.514, Speaker B: So we are here because we see a problem that needs to be solved. We are looking at an existential problem that needs to be solved.
00:41:11.602 - 00:41:11.898, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:11.954 - 00:41:14.498, Speaker B: And I think we have done, like, our product is good.
00:41:14.554 - 00:41:14.938, Speaker C: Right?
00:41:15.034 - 00:41:30.050, Speaker B: I will be honest with you. Like, our product is good. Like, don't just ask me, like, ask the margin fi team. Ask, like, anybody who's, anyone on Solana who's defi or liquid staking. That is. Right. And they will be like, yes, sanctum is doing foundational work just like Jupiter.
00:41:30.050 - 00:42:07.418, Speaker B: And I think our product is good, but what we really need now is for people to understand what is this future that we're building? What is this infinite LSD future when that you can have an Ali soul and an exit soul and all kinds of all these different souls for all kinds of different people, all kinds of different needs, right? And this like, a thousand different flowers blooming as opposed to, you know, ethereum, where you have one, one and a half, you know, you've got Lido, and then you've got rocket pool as a distant second. And how the hell, you know, lots of others, you know, who cares? Right? Yeah. So that's the vision.
00:42:07.474 - 00:42:07.738, Speaker C: Right?
00:42:07.794 - 00:42:11.882, Speaker B: And I think we have, like, a little bit more way to go.
00:42:11.986 - 00:42:12.346, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:12.418 - 00:42:31.400, Speaker B: But I think we're finally there. We're finally at the finish line, I think. And I think we didn't expect this, but the bull market seems to be coming, so that's also a good thing. But, you know. Yeah, I think, like, we are finally at a point where I can say, like, yes, I'm proud of this thing that we have built over the past three years. I think we're ready. Yeah.
00:42:33.140 - 00:43:06.700, Speaker D: Yeah. Is there, you guys have built all these different pieces to kind of accomplish this end goal. And, you know, it feels like you. You guys are pretty much there in terms of accomplishing it. I think in the future, you guys are just kind of grab more liquidity onboard, more lsts. But is there anything else on your guys, like vision board, North Star, any other problems or areas where you want to kind of improve or develop in the Solana ecosystem or maybe in the eth ecosystem?
00:43:07.000 - 00:43:50.510, Speaker B: Well, two years ago, three years ago, Solana is copying Eve, right? And we are copying, I'll be frank, right? Like the initial v zero of the program. We just say like, oh, what's Lido doing? And let's build it on Solana, right? And I think now, you know, they should look at us, right? The eve guys should look at, like, holy shit, like, look at this crazy stuff. Look at this, you know, deep, you know, 100 million pool of liquidity, right? Not just. Not just sanctum, by the way. We obviously, we have 30 million, but there's lots of other pools out there and we love, you know, we want to support and unify all this stuff, right? I want Eve guys to look at. Look at this. Tons of hundreds of different lsts, all magically working interoperable with one another.
00:43:50.590 - 00:43:50.806, Speaker A: No.
00:43:50.838 - 00:44:15.160, Speaker B: Winner takes all. No wringing your hands about the Lido dominance every single day. I think it's time for Yves to look at Sol and holy shit, this is a future that we should be part of. We should try and I don't understand if well enough, I think someone else should build it. But I think this is the future. We are showing all of these proof of stake chains out there, especially Ethereum. A better future is possible.
00:44:17.100 - 00:44:44.960, Speaker D: Yeah, I like that completely tangentially. Sanctum aside, you talk a little bit about the problems with Lido and the governance surrounding that. Are there any good governance models that you personally think have been successful or kind of how you think about governance and crypto as a topic?
00:44:45.740 - 00:45:06.054, Speaker B: This is a great question. I have actually been thinking about this a lot because we are moving towards our own governance. I think one failure case is that you, okay, this is not, this is not an original thought by any means, but I think it's true.
00:45:06.102 - 00:45:06.286, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:06.318 - 00:46:08.444, Speaker B: I think a lot of daos try to decentralize too fast, you know, and I think that's like a. That's like a huge failure case. Um, because, you know, the moment you get that and you get, like, token voting on any small thing, you can't get anything done, you know, I can tell you, like, if we had, like, dialed and launched our token, like, two years ago, like we could not, you cannot move like this fast and there are entrenched interests and, and there are people who are out there who are, you know, much more short term and, and to be frank they don't understand the problem domain nearly as well as we do. Right, because we've been here and then these guys bought some token and they think they're experts. It's just not, you should not, I think it's a big failure case if you try to decentralize anything too fast. Now at the same time I think if you decentralize too slow then I think the governance portion is just theater and that's again not what we want. You want people to have like really, really like be, to think that they, you know, to really be sure that their token actually is, you know, doing something useful.
00:46:08.444 - 00:46:33.980, Speaker B: So I think it's a bit early days but I like what Jupyter is doing. Right with their token. Right with their token model. I think so. You know they are not saying they're not committing to sort of, you know, anything like sharing revenues or having this shared treasury or whatever, right? Not yet at least. But look at what they are doing with the LFG. You guys know the LFG, the launchpad.
00:46:33.980 - 00:46:56.088, Speaker B: They are getting people to vote on which projects they launch and I think that is really great. Why? Because when you have a centralized exchange binance, how do they decide how to list projects? You have no idea. You have no clue. I can tell you that a lot of them is very predatory. They are asking for your token, they are asking for these market making deals. You have no control. They're going to pump and dump it.
00:46:56.088 - 00:47:26.300, Speaker B: You have no idea, right? You have no idea. And I think what Jupiter is showing is like, hey, we're planning to launch these projects, vote for the ones you want. I think that's great. That is really, really good. This is exactly what governance should be used for. But should governance be used for things like, okay, can we manage this treasury money or what products should we develop next? This, I think this is best left at least at the start to the people who have lived and breached the product. Does that make sense?
00:47:27.480 - 00:48:00.226, Speaker A: Yeah, no, for sure. I think it's definitely one of the more interesting thought experiments I guess you can take on at this stage. Implementation is obviously a whole other thing but we always like to hear where founders heads are at there. Want to go off topic a little bit here or I think off topic at least this is the first I've seen of this. Eric asked about 1015 minutes ago. Whether there's going to be a link between sanctum and Pathfinders. And I don't know what Pathfinders is.
00:48:00.226 - 00:48:02.282, Speaker A: I just saw it in your bio just now.
00:48:02.386 - 00:48:02.666, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:02.698 - 00:48:05.070, Speaker A: I'm wondering if you can tell us what that is.
00:48:05.690 - 00:48:38.598, Speaker B: Right. So Pathfinder started off as kind of like a throwaway thing that we did for Socian, which was what we were before we rebranded. And it was basically like an NFT project, that. It was a bit throwaway. But then we realized that we have really, really talented folks on the team. We have a very strong ip and we've been building it for so long and now we've completely spun it up into a different project. But the teams are in very close contact now.
00:48:38.598 - 00:48:54.366, Speaker B: I don't. I'm not working on a day to day for the Pathfinders NFT project, but, you know, we have some, you know, very, very capable people at the helm and working on the Pathfinders project. Pathfinders is a studio Ghibli inspired project. The art is fantastic, the law is wonderful.
00:48:54.438 - 00:48:54.814, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:54.902 - 00:49:10.322, Speaker B: Like, I mean, you guys should go check it out. Will there be a link between sanctum and Pathfinders? Yes. You know, we are planning something really, really new with pathfinders. Let me just sort of quickly sketch out the problem.
00:49:10.386 - 00:49:10.586, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:10.618 - 00:49:27.194, Speaker B: I think with a lot of NFT mints, like when you mint, right, your soul is just gone. Right, it's in Project treasury somewhere. And then you've got to get. You've got to pray that the founder is not going to take your soul and sort of sell it all off or go and have parties with it.
00:49:27.282 - 00:49:27.530, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:27.570 - 00:49:31.066, Speaker B: So we're looking at, is there a way that we can use lsts?
00:49:31.138 - 00:49:31.750, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:32.170 - 00:49:52.030, Speaker B: With sanctum, powered by sanctum. Can we do nfts that really kind of change this matter of how nfts are? Can we do mints? Can we basically just change the meta such that nfts cannot rug you? That's something that we want to do because I think that's the biggest problem with nfts.
00:49:54.530 - 00:50:15.864, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. That's some exciting stuff to know. Didn't know that that was even on the radar. While we're. While I'm snooping through everybody's twitter here, I got another tweet I would like to ask about from. This one's from sanctum from yesterday says, we have four pieces of the sanctum jigsaw live at this moment and one more to be announced soon.
00:50:15.864 - 00:50:28.210, Speaker A: There's the router reserve, infinity and validator lsts. And then there's a fifth one that starts with a. Jdehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe. Can you give a. Can you give us any more letters there?
00:50:28.590 - 00:50:35.770, Speaker B: You should ask. You should ask jay about it. He's, you know, it starts with a j. My name starts with an f. Right. So.
00:50:37.150 - 00:50:38.070, Speaker A: I'm kidding.
00:50:38.230 - 00:50:46.290, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's, you know, something very, very interesting, I think. Yeah, no, no comment right now.
00:50:47.590 - 00:51:31.404, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough that I had to ask. We're starting to come up on time here. Definitely have gone over a lot of interesting stuff so far. A lot of stuff that I think a good chunk of our audience and me and cedaw at least, weren't super aware of. But definitely now, I think, are finding ourselves more interested and wanting to be involved as a user, as a creator, um, for, I guess, like, just a last thing to leave our audience with. Is there any sort of, like, calls to action, anything that you think the people should know about you or about sanctum or about the problem you'd like to solve? Kind of like any.
00:51:31.404 - 00:51:33.360, Speaker A: Any closing remarks here?
00:51:34.100 - 00:51:48.870, Speaker D: I. Sorry, I just want to mention, for the people watching, I think they're pretty interested in you personally and what you're doing. Could you maybe tell the people where you're at right now what you're up to right now?
00:51:48.990 - 00:52:06.930, Speaker B: Oh, sure. So the team is in New York right now. We're going to be here for a bit, but we're all working together. I am not sure we can announce why we are in New York at this particular time, because we're working with some external organizations. But all will be clear very soon.
00:52:07.280 - 00:52:07.616, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:07.648 - 00:52:20.944, Speaker B: If you guys are in New York, want to meet up, like, you know, please, please just drop me a DM on Twitter anytime. Like, we love to meet, you know, people. We love to meet our users. Right. You know, collaborators of all kinds.
00:52:20.992 - 00:52:21.176, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:21.208 - 00:52:26.528, Speaker B: So we're in New York. The other thing. So call to action.
00:52:26.584 - 00:52:26.968, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:27.064 - 00:52:29.080, Speaker B: So I think two things.
00:52:29.160 - 00:52:29.640, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:29.760 - 00:52:39.840, Speaker B: Like, okay, maybe three things. Yeah. Not to overload. Right. First is, you know, try and understand. Like, please try and understand what we're doing and why. We're not trying to be a lido.
00:52:39.840 - 00:53:08.202, Speaker B: We're not trying to be yet another centralized authority. That's not what we want to do. A lot of people are asking, should I deposit to inf or should I deposit into all the other lsts? I think the answer is both. They serve very different purposes. Here's first call to action, understand what we're doing and why. Important for Solana, for the network. Second, look at all the lsts.
00:53:08.202 - 00:53:20.914, Speaker B: And I mean all of them. Look at which one appeals to you. If you're a bond holder, you want to hold bong, great, go to bong. So we support that. If you want to support Jitto's Mev stuff. Absolutely. Go for Jito soul.
00:53:20.914 - 00:53:55.350, Speaker B: If you want to support compassoul drift. Soul drift. Really good perps project, go for that. Go and support the LST that you want. And then the last call to action is, if you want to help to build this liquidity future, if you want to help to support the infinity pool and make sure that we get deep liquidity for all of these lsts, then deposit your LST also into iNf, into the infinity pool. But again, only do that if it makes sense for you. If you just say, hey, I'm not interested in providing liquidity.
00:53:55.350 - 00:54:13.138, Speaker B: I'm interested in just holding bong Sol because I'm a huge bond supporter. Great, go ahead. You know, I don't, you know, we are not going to, we're not, we're not trying to swallow up the LSD's here. Just think of it as a liquidity pool in which you can provide liquidity for all lsts. Yeah. So those are three calls to actions, right. One, understand what we do, right.
00:54:13.138 - 00:54:19.786, Speaker B: Two, ape into the different LSD's and three, ape into infinity. So those are the three. Yeah, yeah.
00:54:19.938 - 00:54:40.840, Speaker A: Very straightforward, very easy to follow. I think that makes a lot of sense. And it's definitely, you know, important for people to understand out of curiosity, you know, what's, what would be your preferred LST, you know, infinity aside, obviously. Where, where would you, where would you be parking your, your steak?
00:54:41.500 - 00:54:45.052, Speaker B: Ah, this is, you're putting me on this part here.
00:54:45.076 - 00:54:47.638, Speaker A: The hardest, hardest question of you can.
00:54:47.654 - 00:54:58.942, Speaker B: Give multiple incredibly neutral, right. So I'm not sure, but, okay, so personally. Personally. Personally, right. Like, not, again, not financial advice. Like, this is not what sanctum is.
00:54:59.086 - 00:54:59.414, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:59.462 - 00:55:07.550, Speaker B: Personally. But I think. Okay, so there are these validators. Single validated lsts, right. So we have cogent for Cogencox.
00:55:07.590 - 00:55:07.766, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:07.798 - 00:55:14.450, Speaker B: We have lane. Right, compass, right, etc. A lot of these are. And bonk, as well as a single validator. They delegate to a single validator.
00:55:14.530 - 00:55:14.962, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:15.066 - 00:55:38.802, Speaker B: I think a lot of people forget or they don't realize that validators are not just machines. You know, like, I mean, yes, they are machines and they're running, you know, they're helping to keep the Solana network alive and stuff. But there are people behind those machines. Yeah. Like, they're real people. And I, you know, one, like, I think one of my close, like, so, you know, we've gone to breakpoint. We've spoken to lots of validators.
00:55:38.802 - 00:56:12.640, Speaker B: I've been to really, really close, like, close personal friends with some of these validators. So I want to give a shout out to two. One of them is compass Johnny from Solana Compass, and another one is Michael from Lane or Stakewiz. So both of these I've met in person multiple times, personal friends. And apart from them running good validators, I can see that they are also huge net contributors to the Solana economy and the stake, you know, state, like, informing people what staking is. So if you go to Solana compass.com.
00:56:12.720 - 00:56:12.912, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:12.936 - 00:56:35.566, Speaker B: Solanacompass.com. or you go to stakewiz.com. so that's steak. And then wiz.com, you know, they have like, huge, like, lots of information about what staking is, how lsds are, and, you know, like, I am very, very happy to support, like, both of these guys, you know, because these are, like, really, really good validators who are really caring about the space. Yeah. So.
00:56:35.566 - 00:56:37.490, Speaker B: So those will be my two. Two picks.
00:56:40.910 - 00:56:56.334, Speaker A: Good. Very good answer, I think. Definitely. I'm always a fan of shouting out the smaller guys, the unsung heroes. Yeah, we'll definitely have to check some of those out as well as, you know, as well as Pathfinders. Go deeper into sanctum. All the other stuff you mentioned, a lot of.
00:56:56.334 - 00:57:16.930, Speaker A: Lot of cool stuff to look into. I really appreciate you coming on and, you know, walking through everything with us, making everything super easy to understand, kind of like expressing the. The urgency and the importance of kind of what's going on over there. Yeah, I think that about takes us the time here. Cedar, you have any other questions here?
00:57:18.270 - 00:57:39.360, Speaker D: I think we don't usually ask this every episode, and you mentioned a few names, but I think this domino effect of good episodes has come from this. We talked, you know, we heard about you guys through Anders from margin Phi. Is there any other projects or anybody out there that you haven't already mentioned that we should look into?
00:57:41.460 - 00:57:45.516, Speaker B: Oh, good question.
00:57:45.548 - 00:57:50.240, Speaker D: We've had drift on who else have we had on from Solan Ali?
00:57:52.970 - 00:58:00.150, Speaker A: Parcel margin drift. There's more than that.
00:58:02.730 - 00:58:04.946, Speaker B: You know what? Let me take a rain check on that.
00:58:05.138 - 00:58:05.626, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:05.698 - 00:58:13.458, Speaker B: Like, I like these are all the good, these all products I think are really good. But I'm trying to give you guys like a, like a deep cut you know, like something that you may not have heard of.
00:58:13.554 - 00:58:13.762, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:13.786 - 00:58:16.076, Speaker B: So let me, let me get back to you on that. Yeah.
00:58:16.188 - 00:58:22.200, Speaker D: Awesome. That's it for this week. Appreciate, everybody for joining. Thanks again for coming on, Lee.
00:58:22.700 - 00:58:23.900, Speaker B: All right, cheers. Pleasure.
