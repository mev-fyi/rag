00:00:00.280 - 00:00:26.808, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. I think there will be a way to play it, but I think that it's gonna be tough to see that play out cleanly just because, like, people aren't. I guess account abstraction isn't that big of a narrative or, like, that well known of a thing among. Especially among, like, djens. Yeah. Which works in our favor, because if something like that does happen, where we'll start incentivizing activity, like, it can be on top of that, and that'd be cool.
00:00:26.808 - 00:00:44.816, Speaker A: Touch some incentives before incentivize wallet activity. I like that. Like, you can see that running as I get. Dude, are there any walls? You could see? So many threads. I don't think so. Not that I know. Yeah.
00:00:44.816 - 00:00:46.480, Speaker A: So then it's weird. I don't know how they would do.
