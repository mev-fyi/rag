00:00:00.280 - 00:00:02.153, Speaker A: Are you going to hide what we were talking about?
00:00:02.249 - 00:00:05.313, Speaker B: No, I'm not going to hide it because, like, no one's going to put in the actual work.
00:00:05.369 - 00:00:12.489, Speaker A: Well, what do people have to do for a free 20x on poly? It's obvious. It's the last chapter.
00:00:12.537 - 00:00:14.273, Speaker B: Like, nah, no way.
00:00:14.329 - 00:00:19.713, Speaker A: The thesis that you had was so pinpoint. I'm pretty sure there's an episode with you talking about it.
00:00:19.769 - 00:00:22.321, Speaker B: It took 10 minutes of googling to profit off of that.
00:00:22.393 - 00:00:25.657, Speaker A: Back in my day, people were willing to go to jail for a good D5 protocol.
00:00:25.721 - 00:00:30.393, Speaker B: I don't have a sense for the numbers. It's just based off of, like, straight vibe. That's how you do a good airdrop.
00:00:30.449 - 00:00:41.921, Speaker A: I'm just fucking flu, dude. I hope their focus was creating a better protocol versus creating like fake use cases for a token. Look at this. Still have nothing to show for it.
00:00:41.993 - 00:00:45.537, Speaker B: With just how few people are on here. You can find an ARB here.
00:00:45.601 - 00:00:47.205, Speaker A: Road to a billion episodes.
00:00:53.185 - 00:01:05.425, Speaker B: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of exit liquidity. Episode 89. Almost at 100. We're getting there.
00:01:06.565 - 00:01:08.733, Speaker A: You think we would have guessed we would make it to 100?
00:01:08.829 - 00:01:13.749, Speaker B: I mean, we wanted it to be around Devcon, right? But then, like, we would have had to hustle to get there.
00:01:13.837 - 00:01:33.845, Speaker A: Yeah, I know, but I'm talking about, like, at the start start because I remember we would always talk about most. Most podcasts don't get to like 20 episodes. And I remember we. We like, not celebrated, but we sort of celebrated getting to 20 as like a milestone. Yeah, it's pretty wild.
00:01:34.385 - 00:01:35.041, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:35.153 - 00:01:51.393, Speaker A: For what it's worth, like, this podcast is, you know, it's opened a lot of doors for us. I don't know if the audience realizes that. I don't think I would have stayed in crypto if we didn't do this.
00:01:51.489 - 00:01:53.569, Speaker B: I definitely didn't think we would make it to 100.
00:01:53.657 - 00:01:55.177, Speaker A: I don't think I could have made it, dude.
00:01:55.241 - 00:01:55.633, Speaker B: Really?
00:01:55.729 - 00:01:57.001, Speaker A: I don't. I don't think so.
00:01:57.113 - 00:01:58.185, Speaker B: Well, you did so.
00:01:58.225 - 00:01:59.633, Speaker A: Yeah. No.
00:01:59.729 - 00:02:22.891, Speaker B: No reason to wonder about what if. Yeah, it's pretty funny. Like sometimes when I meet new people or like, someone introduces me to someone, like, even outside of Exit Liquidity stuff, they, like, introduce me and like, I'm sure this happens to you too. They introduce us as, like, co founders of Ex Liquidity. That's like the one. They don't mention any other past experience. That's the only thing.
00:02:22.891 - 00:02:32.435, Speaker B: And I love that, honestly. So we did a solo back the episode. I don't Remember what we talked about, but the episode's titled, like, Ethereum and Pump Fun or something like that.
00:02:32.555 - 00:02:36.375, Speaker A: How are you feeling? How do you feel about Crypto right now?
00:02:39.195 - 00:02:40.763, Speaker B: I feel pretty good.
00:02:40.899 - 00:02:42.403, Speaker A: Like, aside from price action.
00:02:42.459 - 00:03:36.895, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I mean, so I guess, like, a lot of it is affected by my, like, personal situation. And even though I plan to take time off for, like, most of the summer, like, it was totally way worse for price swings when you're, like, living off of your portfolio. Because when things are bad, it's like the whole, like, you know, the whole world is ending and, like, you're super, super just, like, nihilistic about everything. Now that I have, like, a job, it's a lot easier to be okay with that stuff. Especially, like, when you spend most of your day working on, like, actual products. It makes it a lot easier to ignore most of the stuff that, like, previously would have made me more. Made me more pessimistic about things.
00:03:36.895 - 00:04:13.365, Speaker B: But overall, I feel pretty good. Like, it was a pretty boring summer. We had like a fun last, like, week, maybe two weeks, something like that, up until. Up until things turn around a little bit. But I feel like most people were in the camp of, like, it's going to be a boring summer. Kind of just, you know, don't spend too much time on any charts and come back in October and things will be good. And October hasn't started great, obviously, but, you know, things can only be boring for so long.
00:04:13.365 - 00:04:17.305, Speaker B: I mean, we've been ranging forever now. It feels like, yeah.
00:04:19.005 - 00:04:41.551, Speaker A: I've. I've. I've begun to just not even care about price as I've had a job and doing doing exit liquidity stuff, which has not been great for my P and L. I do think I'm underperforming. I think I'm underperforming. I don't even know if I'm underperforming eth in total, but I think I'm. That's.
00:04:41.551 - 00:05:08.295, Speaker A: That's. That's like, impossible to do. But I'm. I think I'm teetering on underperforming bitcoin. So I don't know. I've come to realize I'm not a great trader. And my best bet is to surround myself with people that are better traders, people that are smarter than me via this podcast, and try and try and snag some decent wins every now and then.
00:05:08.295 - 00:06:21.915, Speaker A: But nowadays I think my focus has really been trying to build cool shit like make cool content, really care about price action. There still isn't any app that Excites me enough besides like maybe like polymarket. That's really it. I think I was thinking about this recently, but I feel like the people that were building things during the BEAR were doing a, a very good job of like preparing themselves and preparing their protocols for this like, up cycle. Some of the bigger projects are, are like, you know, getting to the point where they're actually going to have to ship a product. But I was thinking more recently, especially for how we think about like new guests and stuff and trying to find like interesting protocols, which there is like simply a giant lack of that. I wonder where I should be looking for that newer stuff and those newer builders.
00:06:21.915 - 00:07:49.645, Speaker A: It feels like most new builders and newer protocols have like gotten the attention they deserve, maybe more than they deserve and are getting to their kind of launch date. Like there is the like, you know, there was the whole like Olympus DAO ecosystem crew that I think like each like the Bear chain older Defi Ohm fork guys have, you know, those builders have come and they've, they've, they're building their great protocols and Sammy is building his Smokey and that crew are building their. And, and like there's some DEFI people that are building in that ecosystem and they're getting to like the launch day. Like that cohort, I feel like is graduating basically. And then there, there's like the Solana cohort that I feel like is, is, is going as well. Thank them. I mean, I, I'm not going to act like I was aware of the JITO cohort, but I feel like that generation of builders have reached their, I don't want to say highest form of potential, but reach their launch points, their launch dates.
00:07:49.645 - 00:08:47.125, Speaker A: And I feel like the most interesting times are watching those very early on and watching those like builders come out of the ashes of another ecosystem and build something successful. Like you see with Z and Initia coming from the Luna ecosystem, the thing that I'm curious about is like, I feel like there isn't. I can't find the next cohort. Like, I don't know where to find that next cohort of like very strong builders who, you know, worked on something else. And now I have this very interesting new idea that they're, they're building towards. And yeah, that's, that's the area that I think I'm like really, really, really looking for. I'm not looking for another like or I'm not getting excited about another perp stacks on another L1 or an L2.
00:08:47.125 - 00:09:24.895, Speaker A: I'm not really. I don't really care about how many times people are looping some type of stable coin or something. I don't know. Maybe this is it. Maybe this was like the last moment for interesting protocols or interesting new builders. But what I've been thinking about more recently is where to find that next cohort of very strong builders who aren't just looking to raise $5 million and making a fork of an app on a different chain.
00:09:27.435 - 00:09:41.827, Speaker B: Well, I guess you have to think about how to find them necessarily, because if you think about the last one. Well, no, I mean, like, who. Like, how would you know one if you spotted one? In my mind, what you're talking about.
00:09:41.931 - 00:09:43.455, Speaker A: Is I spotted one.
00:09:45.485 - 00:09:46.109, Speaker B: Who.
00:09:46.237 - 00:09:50.773, Speaker A: I think the guys who are doing doxa are pretty cool. They're like.
00:09:50.869 - 00:09:51.869, Speaker B: I don't even know what that is.
00:09:51.917 - 00:10:26.825, Speaker A: It's like a different take on prediction market stuff. Those guys feel like pretty, young, smart people that are trying to solve something that is like, a tough problem and it's not being tackled in the same way by a lot of people. They aren't just going to throw leverage on prediction markets. They're trying to offer a different solution. And it's just a feeling. You find these guys and. Sounds kind of whack, but it is.
00:10:26.865 - 00:10:56.765, Speaker B: Just like a. I think you can find them intentionally, though, too, because what you're talking about essentially is the examples you're referring to is people who worked on other stuff in the past that, like, worked on stuff is not necessarily a failure, but it, like, they worked on something novel in the past that was like us. It was a success in the sense that it was like, a good learning experience for them.
00:10:56.885 - 00:10:59.453, Speaker A: Like, where's the guy that created Abacus Man?
00:10:59.549 - 00:11:00.717, Speaker B: Oh, I don't know. That guy left.
00:11:00.781 - 00:11:31.011, Speaker A: I feel like that co. That cohort. If. If that dude makes another protocol, like, you know, it's going to be a difficult problem that he's going to try and solve for. And he is not just looking to fork something on L2. And his Twitter isn't just crowded with meme coins during his free time. He's actually focused on building, like, a strong new type of dap or, like, solution for something.
00:11:31.123 - 00:11:37.975, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's what you have to look for. Stuff that kind of worked in some way in the past. And people who are working on stuff now.
00:11:38.055 - 00:11:40.875, Speaker A: Does anyone come to your mind that that excites you?
00:11:41.295 - 00:11:59.075, Speaker B: Not anyone we don't already know. So, like, Sammy is a good example because redacted. Like, I mean, they were good at what they did, but it wasn't super scalable. It was. It didn't really find fit at scale. And now they're doing something that's. That's more scalable.
00:11:59.075 - 00:12:06.089, Speaker B: Yeah, but you go. You would have to go back and look at this. What do you mean, the story's over?
00:12:06.137 - 00:12:12.313, Speaker A: Like. Like when you're reading a book, you can tell us the last chapter of the book. There's still more pages, but it's obvious it's the last chapter.
00:12:12.369 - 00:12:16.017, Speaker B: Like, nah. No way. I mean, we don't know what's gonna happen with Dinero.
00:12:16.081 - 00:12:21.665, Speaker A: It's just institutional LSTs. That's it, right? I mean, it's cool. It's cool.
00:12:21.785 - 00:12:26.969, Speaker B: 20 billion TVL. That's not. Then that would certainly be another few pages, I think.
00:12:27.057 - 00:12:33.009, Speaker A: Yes, would be. It would be another few pages, but there wouldn't be a whole new chapter for it. Beyond this chapter.
00:12:33.057 - 00:12:38.845, Speaker B: I think there totally could. Daero was something completely different a year ago. Daero was a stable coin.
00:12:40.225 - 00:12:40.849, Speaker A: I know.
00:12:40.937 - 00:12:49.169, Speaker B: Like, who knows what can happen in a year, in a couple years. I can't think of any other examples off the top of my head though.
00:12:49.297 - 00:12:50.445, Speaker A: Really. That's it.
00:12:51.945 - 00:13:13.791, Speaker B: I'm sure there are more. I'm sure there are more. He's the easy one. His. His case is the easiest one to point to, I think, because it was like the most clear and we literally, like talked about it. But maybe it makes sense to look in other ecosystems, like to look into people building on Sui or. There's a lot of.
00:13:13.791 - 00:13:45.743, Speaker B: There's a lot of failed Solana projects that are building new stuff now. Not anyone I'm necessarily willing to like, take a chance on. But like, Solend wasn't a failure, but it wasn't special by any means. And now they have Sweeland and they made save and like the meme coin shorting thing, there was mango markets, which obviously the whole thing happened with them. Now they're building a Jupiter competitor. Like, I. I think in Solana you would probably find some good examples.
00:13:45.743 - 00:13:55.737, Speaker B: The problem is, I feel like. I feel like project development infrastructure. I think infrastructural improvements move pretty fast on Solana relative to Ethereum. I mean, everything moves fast.
00:13:55.801 - 00:14:01.045, Speaker A: Solana is probably. Solana is probably. Yeah, the price going up moves a lot faster.
00:14:02.785 - 00:14:08.265, Speaker B: No, but the actual infrastructure decentralized pretty. Yeah, but the projects don't move that fast.
00:14:08.305 - 00:14:32.053, Speaker A: I don't think Solana could be interesting. I think you're right. Any other L1 or alt L1, you're just going to see a whole phase of. Hey, we need a perp Sticks on monad. Hey, we need a liquidity lending protocol on monad. And we need it on say, and we need it on sui, and we need it on aptos. We need it on all these places.
00:14:32.053 - 00:14:36.265, Speaker A: There's no. There's no evolution for any of this stuff.
00:14:43.215 - 00:14:54.351, Speaker B: Aerodrome, That's a good example. Even though I don't think that success is going to last. And, like, it's pretty much just driven by Coinbase because, like, Velodrome metrics have been.
00:14:54.463 - 00:15:10.175, Speaker A: That was such a 20, 23. You were so right about that. You were so right about that play. That or you talked about it so much that I. I don't want to say I'm disappointed that you didn't capitalize off it, because it doesn't matter to me.
00:15:10.215 - 00:15:13.155, Speaker B: But, like, I never bought the token.
00:15:13.955 - 00:15:21.475, Speaker A: The thesis that you had was so pinpoint. I'm pretty sure there's an episode with you talking about it early on.
00:15:21.515 - 00:15:26.339, Speaker B: Like, since before they launched, too. I remember when they announced. I, like, sent it to you. I was like, this is.
00:15:26.387 - 00:15:31.895, Speaker A: It was simple. It was just like Coinbase. Yeah. It was so simple.
00:15:33.755 - 00:15:34.575, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:35.235 - 00:15:38.715, Speaker A: But is that exciting, though? Like, are you getting up in the morning?
00:15:38.795 - 00:15:56.015, Speaker B: No, because it's. Because it's not a new product. Like, it's. It's the only reason it is. What it is is because it's on base. Coinbase is pushing it and there's the whole, like, base Normie thesis, which is, like, honestly, pretty weak right now. Yeah, but it's still.
00:15:56.015 - 00:15:57.743, Speaker B: I mean, metrics still look great.
00:15:57.839 - 00:15:58.135, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:58.175 - 00:16:01.335, Speaker B: So it's like 5x TVL and velodrome by now.
00:16:01.415 - 00:16:13.055, Speaker A: Did you see the. The whole, like, Vermilia and Lady Eco is, like, pissed at him because he pissed at Jesse because he, liked, remove the word out of their discord or something.
00:16:13.135 - 00:16:26.555, Speaker B: No, I don't think it was that. I think someone. Someone, like, made a joke about killing someone. It was, like, very clearly a joke, too. It wasn't like, it was not something that could have been misconstrued. And they, like, banned him.
00:16:28.855 - 00:17:00.125, Speaker A: Yeah, that was pretty funny. But, yeah, I mean. I mean, like, look at this. Like, even when I look at the group chat we have, you have this little perpetual friends group chat. The people that are in there, like, I just want to be like, what are what again? Armchair developer. 100%. It's just like, can somebody make something cool? Like, please, please someone make something cool that isn't anywhere else.
00:17:01.155 - 00:17:05.739, Speaker B: We've already talked to everyone who's made something cool. Like, there's no one left.
00:17:05.787 - 00:17:06.163, Speaker A: Please.
00:17:06.259 - 00:17:07.419, Speaker B: We did a full lap.
00:17:07.507 - 00:17:31.225, Speaker A: Like, please. And the thing is, it was funny because you started this thing of like, we're going to run out of interesting people to talk to. And I was in complete denial. I was like, nah, this ecosystem is huge. Like, there's no way we actually run out of people. And like, these days it's just impossible to find something that isn't just mid.
00:17:32.525 - 00:17:55.947, Speaker B: I don't think we've run out necessarily. I mean, we definitely have blind spots. We definitely have blind spots. And there's just like in the AI, in some spaces, like the AI space specifically, there's like too much noise for me. There's too much. Yeah, it's too theoretical. There's too much noise and I can't evaluate that stuff.
00:17:56.011 - 00:17:57.531, Speaker A: Like, I think most people can't.
00:17:57.563 - 00:17:59.011, Speaker B: I think most people are larping.
00:17:59.123 - 00:18:07.131, Speaker A: I like Tao, but why, why do I use Claude and chatgpt? Why isn't there a solution there? Like, there probably is.
00:18:07.163 - 00:18:10.475, Speaker B: Like how? For spiritual reasons. It has nothing to do with AI.
00:18:10.515 - 00:18:33.821, Speaker A: I know, but like that's what I mean about like the whole AI sector. It's like, yeah, this is going to change this, just gonna change that. But I'm, I'm as. I'm the. I'm probably the most like prime consumer for these like, AI apps and I don't use them, Nobody uses them. So I like the AI space, theoretically. But it's just.
00:18:33.821 - 00:18:46.505, Speaker A: That's all it is. It's all theoretical. It's. It's nothing. And then people have been talking about like, I mean, the Wayfinder shit is kind of cool. Have you been seeing that?
00:18:47.545 - 00:18:48.793, Speaker B: No, I don't know what that is.
00:18:48.889 - 00:18:56.845, Speaker A: It's like the. Do you know, like the Slate Spice guys trying to make it is like a chat bot for like executing transactions.
00:18:57.985 - 00:18:59.641, Speaker B: Just like an AI interface.
00:18:59.713 - 00:19:03.569, Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually pretty good. I mean, from the demos I've seen.
00:19:03.617 - 00:19:04.457, Speaker B: Are you going to use.
00:19:04.521 - 00:19:55.265, Speaker A: I'm not going to use it. I'm not going to use it. I think at most I could see a world where if you had like a Robin Hood mobile UX and you're like, you know, it's one margin account, you're doing lending on one protocol, doing, you know, trading delta neutral or like arbing funding rate on a perps protocol on one side and then like an AI makes a suggestion like, hey, like you could get, you know, kind of like when you're driving on Google Maps is like, hey, there's a roadblock ahead. Like go this way and you get like two minutes saved and you can decide if you want to change your route or not. That's the only thing I think I would actually do for the AI stuff is like, if I'm. If the AI can recognize that my wallet is already doing a certain type of activity, if they can find me, yield, that's more advantageous and, like, explain the risks to me. And then one button to like, execute that.
00:19:55.265 - 00:20:06.985, Speaker A: I think that makes sense. But I'm not going to wake up. And instead of clicking metamask, I'm going to click Wayfinder and type in a chatbot. Hey, send $5 to Ollie. Like, I'm not fucking doing that.
00:20:09.715 - 00:20:11.575, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty specific.
00:20:12.075 - 00:20:12.763, Speaker A: It's pretty.
00:20:12.819 - 00:20:17.387, Speaker B: Like, I think it'd still be a while before that stuff is actually, like, useful.
00:20:17.571 - 00:20:35.775, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, it was sad that I was talking about today what payments are still, like, mid. Like, we can't even pay people. We have to pay people. We. We had to. I mean, we had to fold to the trad gods.
00:20:36.345 - 00:20:37.361, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:20:37.393 - 00:20:41.409, Speaker A: For the most simple use case in the world, that crypto is.
00:20:41.457 - 00:21:18.531, Speaker B: Well, I mean, the, the blocking, the blockage there is regulatory. That's the problem. Like, if somebody, if somebody like, paying a crypto user is easier than it has ever been, like, there. And it's never really been that bad. The thing is, is, like, it's like, if you want to pay someone who uses crypto and you're also a crypto user, you can do it easier than you could with literally anything else. But if you want to go outside of our ecosystem, you quite literally have to chew glass to get there.
00:21:18.563 - 00:21:18.819, Speaker A: It's.
00:21:18.867 - 00:21:24.139, Speaker B: It's the worst, like the worst experience I've ever had with any product ever.
00:21:24.187 - 00:21:28.917, Speaker A: And you know, it feels whack. No one's trying to get around it. I mean, I'm not gonna act like.
00:21:28.941 - 00:21:33.869, Speaker B: I've been in this, I think just because of like. But like, I think that's just because of regulatory stuff.
00:21:33.917 - 00:21:34.997, Speaker A: Yeah. But back, dude.
00:21:35.061 - 00:21:35.789, Speaker B: Back pain.
00:21:35.877 - 00:21:41.385, Speaker A: Back in my day, people were willing to go to jail for a good D5 protocol or a good. Or a good daft man.
00:21:42.285 - 00:21:44.665, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. That's true.
00:21:45.045 - 00:21:45.477, Speaker A: I'm not.
00:21:45.501 - 00:21:46.973, Speaker B: I guess people are more scared now.
00:21:47.069 - 00:21:55.835, Speaker A: I guess so. But like, then they'll still do this most shady with their token and then act like nothing happening.
00:21:55.955 - 00:22:06.051, Speaker B: I think it's because you have to, like, you have to like. Well, I don't know. I mean, like, just getting into a bank is difficult to do. I think that's the biggest thing.
00:22:06.163 - 00:22:19.531, Speaker A: I don't know. It'll probably end up being like made by USDT and usdc. Because the rails. You're right. The regulatory rails. The regulatory rails are the biggest problem. And the people who have been.
00:22:19.531 - 00:22:30.723, Speaker A: Or the orgs that have been embedded in those the most as of late have been. Or like since. Not as of late. Since the dawn of crypto has been.
00:22:30.859 - 00:22:44.575, Speaker B: USDC has apparently good rails already. But it's expensive. As far as I know. It's like $80 a month and I'm pretty sure you still have to go through like an anal cavity search of a KYC to get there.
00:22:45.395 - 00:22:58.531, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. Seems. But yeah, this, this is basically the introduction. This 20 minutes is. Please give us some.
00:22:58.723 - 00:23:06.051, Speaker B: Some please somebody else to go live. Dude, I feel like there would be so many ponzies on opnet.
00:23:06.163 - 00:23:21.615, Speaker A: Yeah, that'll be fun. But it's still gonna be just for like. I really like the Joey's analogy on like car enthusiasts, like current like defi enthusiasts are really going to enjoy OP Net. I don't think anyone else will.
00:23:23.075 - 00:23:28.575, Speaker B: Yeah, that's, that's fine. Like as long as I have somewhere to. To dick around. That's. That's new.
00:23:28.995 - 00:23:29.555, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:29.635 - 00:23:41.095, Speaker B: I don't really. I don't need stuff like that to appeal to a wider market. I just need it to appeal to the current market which like nothing is really doing right now besides memes.
00:23:43.325 - 00:23:45.173, Speaker A: Yeah. So what are.
00:23:45.229 - 00:23:45.517, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:23:45.541 - 00:23:49.785, Speaker A: You don't have anything else that you're excited about before we jump into like poly market stuff?
00:23:52.445 - 00:23:56.637, Speaker B: Not really. I mean I want another airdrop farming opportunity.
00:23:56.701 - 00:23:57.305, Speaker A: That's.
00:24:01.325 - 00:24:05.585, Speaker B: Yeah, I, I like not even like everything's capital now.
00:24:06.605 - 00:24:25.355, Speaker A: Sure. How much is bear chain monad movement farmers are going to make? You could throw in. Nah, don't throw in. Don't throw in. Scroll. Just like the average farmer.
00:24:26.095 - 00:24:29.071, Speaker B: Let's just say like on testnet. Because all those guys are on Test Net.
00:24:29.103 - 00:24:35.205, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think their airdrop is going to be fat enough? Because the ARG's not even on test net. They're on devnet.
00:24:37.545 - 00:24:48.121, Speaker B: I don't think testnet farmers make more than like $200 per wallet and that's like the bull scenario these people have.
00:24:48.233 - 00:24:51.729, Speaker A: What about polymer and like it's. Honestly, it's a great transition.
00:24:51.817 - 00:25:20.661, Speaker B: Polymarket. It depends on when they drop because there have been people market making for a while and forming polymarket for a while and only just now are people starting to talk about it. Poly market could be good because it's, it's largely like it's not been common to farm it or to, or to Sybil that drop up until like just now. So like if they, if they wait too long then it's going to be really dilutive.
00:25:20.733 - 00:25:24.065, Speaker A: Break down the civil strategy or the most basic one from a high level.
00:25:26.055 - 00:25:27.039, Speaker B: On Poly Market.
00:25:27.127 - 00:25:27.795, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:28.935 - 00:26:06.241, Speaker B: Oh, it's super simple. You just, you, you find markets that are trading at like 99 to 1 and you bet on the 1, you pay a penny for a share that gives you a dollar worth of volume. So essentially you get a hundred x the actual like dollar amount you're putting in and you just pay a penny for it. So like if I have a hundred dollars and some market is trading at $0.01, I can go and buy what is that, like 10,000 shares of that. So $10,000, sorry. Yeah, $10,000 worth of volume.
00:26:06.393 - 00:26:08.325, Speaker A: But someone has to fill you on the other side.
00:26:10.025 - 00:26:15.245, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean you'd have to pick up wrestling liquidity or, or get filled.
00:26:15.705 - 00:26:17.665, Speaker A: Do you think if you, if you.
00:26:17.705 - 00:26:23.559, Speaker B: Place a bid then you earn USD rewards, which is the nice thing, it makes your margins a little bit, little bit better.
00:26:23.647 - 00:26:37.551, Speaker A: Do you think they're tracking USD or people that are LPing that are earning USD as probably a form of criteria? Or do you think they're just like take the USDC and off they See.
00:26:37.583 - 00:27:23.145, Speaker B: The thing is, is like now that they are talking, I think they're kind of up by like they added a section to their docs about a token and about an airdrop. Did they really? A lot of like, yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't confirm anything. It just says like, we have not launched the token yet and like there has been no announced airdrop yet. Like all official communication will come from our Twitter account. And the problem with that is Poly Market volume. I, I think I'm like obviously I haven't looked at the numbers, but I get the sense that up until that started to happen it was mostly organic, like overwhelmingly organic, especially compared to any other crypto trading platform.
00:27:23.305 - 00:27:26.921, Speaker A: They said they had 10,000 daily. Was it 10,000 daily activities?
00:27:27.073 - 00:27:59.845, Speaker B: I don't have a sense for the numbers. It's just based off of straight vibe. No one ever talked about farming a Poly Market token. People were trading on it because they wanted to trade on it and that put them in a really good spot because then they could drop like a normal allocation, like 8 to 12%, whatever. And the actual users would like, they would make a lot of money. That's how you do a good airdrop, literally. And now that they're teasing it to try and juice their volume a little bit more.
00:27:59.845 - 00:28:14.765, Speaker B: It's not there yet. Obviously. It depends on how long they go without dropping the token. But the longer they wait, the more dilutive it's going to be and just the more fake volume they're going to start to see.
00:28:17.265 - 00:28:21.085, Speaker A: I was looking at this recently. Can you see this? Well, should I zoom in?
00:28:23.905 - 00:28:24.889, Speaker B: I can see.
00:28:25.057 - 00:29:08.785, Speaker A: I don't know what this no data should is, but yeah, volume looking for. I'm looking at the volume per day. Oh, 62 mil. Yeah. Daily users. Like, what the is this? Yeah, I mean, in reality, like, the volume just flew, dude.
00:29:12.525 - 00:29:23.785, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, they, they, they got traction really quickly and we're all over, like, even mainstream media. Mainstream media.
00:29:24.605 - 00:29:27.765, Speaker A: And I was arguing about who juice.
00:29:27.805 - 00:29:29.145, Speaker B: Volume with a token.
00:29:29.325 - 00:29:49.289, Speaker A: Who. What, what do you think the split is between users that are crypton native versus non cryptonative and a percent on poly market? Let's just say they have 10,000 users. Or you can do a percent.
00:29:49.377 - 00:30:18.215, Speaker B: I think it's mostly. I think it's mostly crypto users. You can probably approximate it by comparing the odds. Comparing the odds for the presidential election market to, like, actual polling data. Because crypto is like, overwhelmingly right leaning. Especially because Trump is a lot more pro crypto crypto than Kamala. Like, right now it's at 50, 49 in Trump's favor.
00:30:18.215 - 00:30:32.105, Speaker B: Let's see where we're at here, because I'm pretty sure in most other polls is she really.
00:30:32.805 - 00:30:34.665, Speaker A: I think she's ahead on Poly Market.
00:30:36.445 - 00:30:41.905, Speaker B: She's on Poly Market, but not, not most other places, I think. I'm not sure.
00:30:43.965 - 00:30:46.265, Speaker A: Yeah. Donald Trump is ahead on Poly Market.
00:30:47.445 - 00:30:47.909, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:47.957 - 00:30:51.205, Speaker A: This, this website Manifold is probably the most.
00:30:51.285 - 00:31:05.745, Speaker B: It looks like. Looks like it just aggregates polling data from different places. It shows Kamala at 49.9 and Trump at 45.8, which is a pretty big difference, honestly.
00:31:09.085 - 00:31:09.905, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:13.685 - 00:31:18.397, Speaker B: I think it's pretty heavily skewed to crypto users still. I don't think that.
00:31:18.461 - 00:31:24.026, Speaker A: So 80, 20, 60, 40, 70, 30.
00:31:24.187 - 00:31:40.925, Speaker B: 70, 30. Probably somewhere around that. Yeah. Everything I'm seeing is showing. Is showing Harris, like a good 3 or 4% ahead of Trump. Yeah. And that just.
00:31:40.925 - 00:31:47.925, Speaker B: That just like, goes back to my point of how, like, they should not be teasing a token or an airdrop.
00:31:49.425 - 00:32:04.005, Speaker A: They're not gonna have any more attention than they do right now and into this next month. They're not gonna have what Any more attention any more Volume. Any more attention, any more users, it's all going to be next because the election is going to be over.
00:32:06.465 - 00:32:06.817, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:06.841 - 00:32:12.295, Speaker A: A billion dollars does not need to sit and anywhere in that app without presidential.
00:32:13.875 - 00:32:22.427, Speaker B: If they're smart, they're launching their token before the election because like.
00:32:22.491 - 00:32:32.459, Speaker A: Yeah, but you're saying why should they talk about token and stuff. I'm. I was saying that that's. They're doing that because they have. They need to pump those.
00:32:32.547 - 00:32:58.029, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean that would be super. That would be a super aggressive strategy if they like tease a token and then they drop they. Because they literally just started talk like adding it to their language like in the past couple weeks. So if they do that and then launch the token within the next month, that would be dope. I would, I would love to see that honestly. But I don't think it's likely.
00:32:58.029 - 00:33:06.235, Speaker B: Like I feel like when you add a mention of a token that's that loose to your. To your messaging like it means it's still far off.
00:33:06.695 - 00:34:07.585, Speaker A: I don't think so. I think, I think Shane and those guys have been thinking about this stuff for a while and I think they closed that round that they recently announced a lot earlier than people expected or a lot earlier than it was basically announced. I'm hoping that at least update the fucking protocol. I hope, I'm hoping they at least do they provide like more, more. More things for that billion dollars in TVL to do as instead like I hope they, I hope their focus was creating a better protocol versus trying to cash out token wise in time and creating like fake bullshit use cases for a token. They're probably gonna launch a. I mean some people have said they're gonna launch a little chain and or a little extra layer or something is I think what people are expecting.
00:34:07.585 - 00:34:10.641, Speaker A: But I hope that's not it.
00:34:10.673 - 00:34:22.827, Speaker B: If they don't launch before August, they're literally like they're cutting November at least like a third or. Sorry, November. Yeah, they're cutting off like at least a third of their market cap I think. And they have to know that they can't be that naive.
00:34:22.931 - 00:34:23.259, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:23.307 - 00:34:53.144, Speaker B: Unless they're initial like TG roadmap was still years out. I don't think that they would like I think they're smart enough to either like their token plan was always to wait till like 2026 or something or like they're launching within the next month. Anything in between is just like a gross mismanagement of their token launch. I think because they can't be that naive that they're like, oh, we'll find a way to like maintain volume after the election. It's like, nah, dude, there's no way be real.
00:34:53.304 - 00:35:05.528, Speaker A: And people must have been telling them this though for a while. They must know. Yeah, they must know. Yeah, they must know that they have to be like more capital efficient. They must know they have to like figure some out, some stuff out on like.
00:35:05.616 - 00:35:17.979, Speaker B: But in fairness you don't, you don't get to that level of success. You don't get to be like a successful team, a successful founder without being, without being like delusional, you know. Oh yeah, like maybe that's possible.
00:35:18.027 - 00:35:21.539, Speaker A: They're delusional in a good way. They're delusional in that they've all.
00:35:21.587 - 00:35:22.883, Speaker B: You don't know where it ends.
00:35:23.019 - 00:35:35.027, Speaker A: They've always believed though in like the, the prediction market world and that being like a tough problem to solve. So I think it is like good.
00:35:35.051 - 00:35:43.795, Speaker B: Delusion plan to not launch. Like if they are delusional, don't you think they would be like, oh, I think they have a balancing matter, like we'll make it up anyways.
00:35:43.875 - 00:36:27.205, Speaker A: I think they have a rough. I think they have a hard balancing act to solve for. There's demand from the crypto side to make more complex financial product basically or like a more advanced financial product. But there's also that they need to be able to fulfill the. I think in their minds they probably have a higher skew of. They, they believe that they're the consumer app for crypto and that, you know, there's a bunch of non crypto people using their protocol. I doubt that more than I think they doubt that and I think they might over index for the non crypto natives and then slowly watch TVL just like vanish.
00:36:27.205 - 00:36:32.913, Speaker A: Unless they, unless they probably advance the protocol. They should have like a.
00:36:32.969 - 00:36:46.315, Speaker B: They probably know what subset of users aren't crypto native. It's probably so easy to figure out. Like you just look at the wallet history and the funding source and yeah, that's like a rough, a good enough way to approximate.
00:36:47.095 - 00:37:47.325, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I don't know. It's going to be tough for them. I think they can get away without launching a token if they've really thought about advancing the way the protocol works and the capabilities it has. I think that if they cater towards the crypto native money strong enough, they'll maintain a strong amount of TVL and just find a way for more complex financial stuff, more capital efficient stuff to happen on the app. People don't want to show up to some and not get filled on the bid and they don't want to bridge the polygon to use the app. Like those things that can make for a way better experience and more advanced types of trading.
00:37:47.325 - 00:37:51.685, Speaker A: Because there is like. Is your money in like a D5 protocol?
00:37:56.385 - 00:37:57.685, Speaker B: Probably, yeah.
00:38:00.455 - 00:38:04.583, Speaker A: Which one? What percent?
00:38:04.679 - 00:38:08.035, Speaker B: I have to check Symbiotic. I have money in Symbiotic.
00:38:08.535 - 00:38:38.727, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think they don't have to drop a token. I think they can do like more advanced stuff that could generate yield and people will put their money there because it's like, it's still Poly market. It's still the best place for a prediction market. It's still this X, Y and Z thing and they can maintain that and still not drop a token and still get people excited about a future. Token is my thing. I don't think they have to drop a token within this month.
00:38:38.727 - 00:38:42.075, Speaker A: I think they need to create a better fucking protocol.
00:38:43.575 - 00:38:50.315, Speaker B: But how do you top literally being a data source on CNN and shit like that?
00:38:50.905 - 00:38:51.457, Speaker A: Dude, you can.
00:38:51.481 - 00:38:54.625, Speaker B: What are they going to have further than that?
00:38:54.705 - 00:40:00.895, Speaker A: You can be a data source on CNN all you want, but if you can't find a home for $1 billion in TVL once the fucking election is over, it's the same problem that like, like Sanctum Sanctum had that moment where there's like giant amount of TV on the protocol. This is their loudest moment. They're about to drop a token. They have to do things that remove people's willingness to just remove the fucking money out of the protocol. I think if they can maintain above $500 million in the app and create a better app, you could probably generate really solid yield. What if they just immediately have a really dope market for the next election market and they're like, yeah, like, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll throw your, the money that you're going to like put in here for four years. We'll throw it into like fucking yield opportunities.
00:40:00.895 - 00:40:36.425, Speaker A: There are some CFTC regulated prediction markets that bet on NASA moon landings and stuff like that that put their money like the protocol. The app takes their money and because it's going to sit for like years or months, they'll put it into like treasuries and get 5%. Like that's, that's a step above than what Poly Market has right now. And those fucking guys are CFTC regulated. So I think they just need to do cooler shit and more capital efficient and advance the protocol rather than just dumping a token.
00:40:39.405 - 00:40:59.021, Speaker B: What I don't. Well, no, I'm not saying they should dump a token to retain users. That's not gonna be, that's not gonna accomplish that. Like the point of launching the token then is so you launch at a higher valuation. Like, let's just be real. They want to launch at the highest possible. Obviously they want their token to be worth something.
00:40:59.093 - 00:41:01.181, Speaker A: I think we've matured enough a step.
00:41:01.213 - 00:41:03.491, Speaker B: In that process as. No, we have not.
00:41:03.573 - 00:41:04.271, Speaker A: I think we have.
00:41:04.303 - 00:41:06.559, Speaker B: I think people will. Launching a token at a high initial.
00:41:06.607 - 00:41:20.831, Speaker A: Valuation, I think we will look far out in advance and say they're going to dominate in an election space. They're creating a more efficient protocol that is going to create better yield opportunities. Better kind of like reasons to have.
00:41:20.863 - 00:41:21.911, Speaker B: Money in the protocol.
00:41:22.063 - 00:41:54.215, Speaker A: They're going to create sports betting, they're going to create this shit. Poly Market is a household name at this point. I could still see people using the app at this point. They have the fucking clout to partner with some of the biggest streamers. They have the clout to do like really cool. The only other risk I'd see for them is like the regulatory. Because they could just get regulated to zero, to be honest.
00:41:54.215 - 00:41:56.467, Speaker A: That's what I've heard.
00:41:56.531 - 00:41:58.411, Speaker B: I don't think there's any markets saying.
00:41:58.443 - 00:42:00.015, Speaker A: That it's gonna happen.
00:42:01.325 - 00:42:26.385, Speaker B: I don't think there's any market that they can launch any product, any yield, anything they can offer that is gonna, is gonna come close to what is literally the biggest news event of, of every like, of every four years. Like there. There's nothing they could do that's bigger than the catalyst of being a month, a couple months out from election day.
00:42:26.765 - 00:42:34.781, Speaker A: I think they got it in them. I think prediction markets have a lot more to offer than elections. I think, I mean, yeah, I think.
00:42:34.853 - 00:42:36.045, Speaker B: Not at that scale.
00:42:36.205 - 00:42:36.869, Speaker A: I do.
00:42:36.917 - 00:42:45.837, Speaker B: Because you have to remember they have friction too. I think they have. It's not. They have so much friction to their platform too. Because you have to.
00:42:45.901 - 00:42:46.373, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying.
00:42:46.389 - 00:42:48.821, Speaker B: They have to make better to get there product.
00:42:48.933 - 00:42:58.179, Speaker A: They make a better product and a more advanced product. They're. They need to give you reasons to keep money in the protocol outside of the election anyway. How do, how are people going to.
00:42:58.187 - 00:43:08.307, Speaker B: Get behind on the election timeline? That's what you think they're behind if, if, if, if they. Because you still have to onboard through Polygon and there's no other, there's no other markets that are exciting.
00:43:08.371 - 00:43:40.117, Speaker A: I think they prioritize the fact that this is working for the elections. Now, we have half a billion dollars in this app, or even if they were at a hundred million, we have a hundred million dollars in this election market. Let's just keep this shit working until the election is over. We'll advance the protocol and try new shit once there's, like, once there's not the biggest prediction market in the fucking world on this, on this app. And we can do cooler shit, we can change the onboarding experience, we can change things around and we can try cooler shit. Sports betting, they can't wait.
00:43:40.181 - 00:43:44.069, Speaker B: Streamers, they can't wait until. I feel like they've been working before the election settles.
00:43:44.117 - 00:44:25.081, Speaker A: I feel like they've been working on it because there's no way. There's no way you as a grown man, you as a grown man onboard onto polygon the way that the onboarding experience has been now and say, yeah, this is, this is the future of finance. I think they realized that a long time ago and have been building towards changing that for a very long time. I, I think that, that, that's my thing, granted. I do think. I do think very highly of that Shane guy. I think he's like, could be like a pretty, you know, smart dude, but, yeah, I don't know.
00:44:25.081 - 00:44:29.625, Speaker A: How are people gonna make free money aside from the token.
00:44:29.665 - 00:44:47.465, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, you can still. You can, you can. That has nothing to do with, with the election market. It's quite the opposite, actually. Those are, Those are the markets you want to stay away from. Like, I'll still be using Poly Market. Not that I'm like an active user, but I'll still be looking for.
00:44:47.465 - 00:44:49.649, Speaker B: I'll still be looking for, like, are.
00:44:49.657 - 00:44:55.105, Speaker A: You gonna hide markets to pick off? Are you gonna hide what we were talking about from the audience?
00:44:55.225 - 00:44:56.993, Speaker B: What were we. What were we talking about?
00:44:57.049 - 00:45:02.825, Speaker A: The, the three observations for free money on pot. Free 20 x's on market.
00:45:02.905 - 00:45:31.373, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, Yeah, I tweeted about it. I mean, no, I'm not going to hide it because I think people. Because I think people. The thing is, is, like, I was not going to. I was not going to, like, tweet it out at first because I knew, like, it's pretty clear. It's pretty clear something like that would go viral. And I was not going to tweet it at first, but then I realized, like, no one's going to put in the actual work because you have to actually pay attention to do it.
00:45:31.499 - 00:45:35.885, Speaker A: So what should people. What do people have to do for a free 20x on polymarket?
00:45:36.305 - 00:45:49.729, Speaker B: Well, you have to first of all, you have to be like monitoring the markets regularly. Anytime a new market goes up, you should know about it and you should check it within at least a day or two.
00:45:49.777 - 00:45:52.165, Speaker A: What should you be looking for? What are you looking for?
00:45:54.385 - 00:46:53.607, Speaker B: You would be looking. The difference in like the question that they ask and the actual settlement conditions is pretty important. It's not often that those, that those don't line up, but when they don't line up, that's when you can literally like break the system and stuff that is just like stuff that is uncertain and has like skewed public perception. A lot of it is also around announcements. It helps, it helps a lot to check odds immediately after announcements, especially because polymarket's super inefficient, efficient. So for these markets that have like 20k of volume lifetime on them, it's going to take like 20, 30 minutes for things to swing for people to like, for people to put the connection together between an announcement and a poly market bet, which is like, if you just pay attention, like, that's plenty of time to go on there and be one of the ones to swing it in the first place.
00:46:53.671 - 00:47:01.515, Speaker A: So observe new markets. Look for a market that you think you'd have an edge in. Or is it just any market that has a very skewed opinion?
00:47:02.335 - 00:47:08.999, Speaker B: It helps, it definitely helps to have an edge in it. Like, and that's about the fact that there's so many crypto markets.
00:47:09.127 - 00:47:11.023, Speaker A: Is that what you focus on? The crypto ones?
00:47:11.119 - 00:47:38.805, Speaker B: I'm. I mostly look at the crypto ones. Yeah, I, I'm sure there's such a broad base of topics on here. Like, I'm sure there's other stuff you could find. But like, like the Venezuelan election one was like super random. I have no expertise there whatsoever, but it took like, you know, 10 minutes of Googling to kind of get a rough idea of what was going on and profit off of that. I'm sure there's tons of more examples.
00:47:38.845 - 00:48:15.255, Speaker A: But the thing is, when the market comes brand new, there is like 50, 50, volume is very slow to move in and you don't see the skew. So like when the market immediately comes on, are you looking for something that you could have an edge in? And you're like, all right, I'm going to wait for volume to kind of move the odds into what I think is too skewed to something like a 99 to 1, which happened with the eigenlayer airdrop. You just kind of like favor the market and just observe it over time. Wait for volume to move because they come in at 50, 50 and then you're kind of just like sitting there like, what the fuck? Or do you place bids even when they're at 50, 50?
00:48:16.035 - 00:48:35.615, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't place bids at 50, 50 most of the time. I don't usually get to markets that early. It's usually like I'll check them a couple days after they go live. And by then odds have settled a little bit. Honestly, big announcements around an existing market are probably more actionable than. Probably more actionable than new markets themselves.
00:48:35.615 - 00:49:14.049, Speaker B: Just because people are super slow to react to news. And when they do react, it's not uncommon for it to be like a knee jerk overreaction. Like it was with like it was with Eigenlair. Like it was with like the Trump token stuff. That's another thing is like not just, not just being early to announcements, but like even being late and like catching just a complete overcorrection in one direction. So like the Eigen token. The Eigen token announcement is a really good example because it happened like three times.
00:49:14.049 - 00:49:46.105, Speaker B: It happened again after, like after we had talked about it because apparently they launched early or something like that. So it swung from like, it swung from like 99 to 1, back to 99 again, which is crazy. Or maybe even more. Maybe even once more than that. And the thing is, people were treating this like an all or nothing thing. When settlement takes time. We still had days to expiry.
00:49:46.105 - 00:50:19.945, Speaker B: And these markets, people don't think about the value of time in this. Even if eigenlair announces their token is launching after the settlement date, there are still like two to three days for that to be realized. That should be factored into the odds. Like mentally not. It's not factored in the market. But you have to factor it in yourself precisely because no one else is like this. I'm sure.
00:50:19.945 - 00:50:23.805, Speaker B: I'm sure. When will bear chain launch in 2024? How much volume has that done?
00:50:24.745 - 00:50:25.725, Speaker A: 5K.
00:50:26.395 - 00:50:27.255, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:28.995 - 00:50:39.227, Speaker A: Like if these, if bro, this at 91, there might be a good. There might be, you know, I mean.
00:50:39.251 - 00:51:07.505, Speaker B: Like so a basic thing here is like, like, let's say so for that market specifically. Like as we get closer to the end of the year, I'm sure there's going to be announcements. Oh, that's actually not a bad punt right there. I would not hate taking that one. Maybe if, maybe. I think it has a lot to do with like the market downturn. If not for that, then this would probably be a lot Higher.
00:51:07.505 - 00:51:10.813, Speaker B: But, yeah, let's say, like, we're approaching.
00:51:10.829 - 00:51:19.155, Speaker A: That feels like it. This feels like it hits your criteria. 19K in volume. It's almost, you know, 1% odds.
00:51:21.855 - 00:51:33.035, Speaker B: Here. Like, intuitively, I would probably price it closer to, like, 8 to 10%, which is, like, not enough of a. That's not enough of a discrepancy for me to really be too interested in it.
00:51:34.375 - 00:51:37.435, Speaker A: Like, look at this. $1 in volume for this.
00:51:37.935 - 00:51:42.745, Speaker B: What the. I can't. I can't see. Our faces are on the left side, so I can't see the.
00:51:42.935 - 00:51:44.749, Speaker A: Ah, my bad. Hold on.
00:51:44.877 - 00:51:58.545, Speaker B: You're just gonna have a little haircut. Wow. Well, these just went live, I think. Oh, yeah, These just went live last week. I'm pretty sure I am actually as swell on here. Swell should be on here, right?
00:52:00.525 - 00:52:02.145, Speaker A: Yes, they're here.
00:52:03.525 - 00:52:04.397, Speaker B: I'm.
00:52:04.581 - 00:52:09.505, Speaker A: You can bet your. You can bet your life savings that they'll delay a airdrop.
00:52:13.015 - 00:52:21.471, Speaker B: I. Yeah, I'm. I'm. I should probably set a bit on this because I'm leaning towards, no, I do not like swell. I, I.
00:52:21.543 - 00:52:24.775, Speaker A: Anyone who does. Anyone who does those guys.
00:52:24.855 - 00:52:33.767, Speaker B: Like, like, not only did they continue to delay over and over and over and over again, but then when I bring it up, when I bring it up to them, they send their return after me.
00:52:33.791 - 00:52:35.159, Speaker A: They sent the founder on a burner.
00:52:35.287 - 00:52:55.539, Speaker B: Like, they're like, oh, well, well, Solana subsidizes validator emissions and you get points for holding swell. It's like, brother, points are worth $0. And they have been since we were, like, actively farming this thing, too, back in, like, literally in, like, April, March of 2020.
00:52:55.587 - 00:53:06.115, Speaker A: I recently. I recently saw someone write a thread saying, I'm sick of swell. They've. They've. They've delayed too many times. I'm like, brother, you're just noticing now?
00:53:06.195 - 00:53:22.259, Speaker B: They. They just continued. They continued. They, like. I was upset at them delaying over a year ago at this point, and they continued to delay for a whole other year after that. And the worst part is, is if you go to their Twitter, look at how much they talk about swell.
00:53:22.387 - 00:53:22.723, Speaker A: Look.
00:53:22.779 - 00:53:41.105, Speaker B: Look at how much they mentioned, like, swell. Oh, shit. They launched the checker or the Checker next week. The Swell Checker will launch next week. I don't give a. I'm not. I'm not believing this token is launching until it is sitting in my wallet and I can see it, at which point I'm sending it.
00:53:41.105 - 00:53:44.385, Speaker B: I'm. I'm. Oh, yeah, yeah, look at this.
00:53:46.045 - 00:54:08.405, Speaker A: Still have nothing to show for it you have more pearls than what you started with along with 3% + Heal in December of 2023. Can you imagine, bro, Come back to me when Soul Validators are actually profitable without subsidies from the foundation. Bro, someone put this on the top of the mid curve chart, man. Holy fuck.
00:54:09.345 - 00:54:30.141, Speaker B: I think. I think the initial tweet was about Jito because I was like, yeah, I was like, dude, I like, Jito literally changed lives. Jito changed my life. That would go as far as to say that like shout out to those guys. Shout out to Buffalo and all them. Those guys are fucking chads. Regardless, airdrop aside, they have a genuinely good like industry dominant product.
00:54:30.141 - 00:54:51.385, Speaker B: Whereas Swell like was. Was like what the is unoriginal in their first thing when it was just like trying to compete as an lst. Now they're doing the whole. Now then they've like pivoted to restaking like most failing LSTs did and then now they're doing a L2. Like they're securing a L2 with restaked assets.
00:54:51.925 - 00:54:53.629, Speaker A: Send it like, send it to zero.
00:54:53.757 - 00:55:07.289, Speaker B: Please. Get. Get it together. Honestly, we like, I want to say that we deserve better in this space, but maybe that's a stretch. Maybe we deserve projects like Swell.
00:55:07.337 - 00:55:14.885, Speaker A: Yeah. Hyperliquid token launch.
00:55:16.665 - 00:55:31.061, Speaker B: This is an interesting one. There's probably this. This will actually. This is a really good one to watch today and tomorrow because yesterday was the last point snapshot, which means they are likely going to announce something tomorrow or early next week.
00:55:31.213 - 00:55:34.653, Speaker A: And free alpha. So damn.
00:55:34.669 - 00:55:39.733, Speaker B: No, November is a. Is it wait, is it launch in that month or is it launched before that month?
00:55:39.789 - 00:55:44.149, Speaker A: It's just like basically when. So okay, you can pick a month ago later.
00:55:44.317 - 00:55:49.557, Speaker B: All the other ones are going to settle to zero. Yeah, October is not bad here, honestly.
00:55:49.621 - 00:55:50.225, Speaker A: Really.
00:55:51.525 - 00:55:56.037, Speaker B: Well, okay, not yet.
00:55:56.101 - 00:55:56.749, Speaker A: I think I could get.
00:55:56.797 - 00:55:57.229, Speaker B: I think.
00:55:57.317 - 00:55:58.745, Speaker A: I think it really bad.
00:55:59.765 - 00:56:06.437, Speaker B: I think something you can do literally right now is set. Turn on Twitter notifications for hyperliquid.
00:56:06.501 - 00:56:07.077, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:07.221 - 00:56:36.965, Speaker B: Move their discord to like the top of your thing so it's right there. And just like as soon as you see an announcement come up, you go straight to this market. And if it's. I don't know what it's going to be like. I don't think they have a super long period with no points and no tge. Like I think they have to roll into either more points or give more information about tge. But the idea is like, look at these markets, like mid four figures in volume.
00:56:36.965 - 00:56:54.165, Speaker B: They have an announcement coming probably tomorrow. If not Tomorrow, early next week. With just how few people are on here, it's like practically certain that if you're early enough to the announcement you can, you can find an ARB here. If they say something. If they say something telling.
00:56:58.225 - 00:57:09.125, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean what's the return at these rates? 28 cents. Nothing. It's not bad returns for what it's worth. It's like 200.
00:57:12.505 - 00:57:13.241, Speaker B: Yeah, I wish.
00:57:13.273 - 00:57:18.865, Speaker A: I just wish like 35.
00:57:18.945 - 00:57:19.953, Speaker B: Spread's pretty good.
00:57:20.049 - 00:57:20.329, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:20.377 - 00:57:35.209, Speaker B: It's actually surprisingly liquid. Maybe this won't swing that hard then. I was. Well, never mind. Yeah. Down to 11. It's like a couple hundred dollars.
00:57:35.209 - 00:57:40.585, Speaker B: But yeah, no like this winning on this app.
00:57:41.445 - 00:57:48.725, Speaker A: Sonic's Phantom 2025. If this goes to 99, I feel like this is a dude.
00:57:48.765 - 00:58:10.207, Speaker B: Any, any like 99 token launch event. Token launch event that hasn't been like done yet. You can probably like just punt on because it's a hundred X and people delay shit all the time. So like, like just broadly the entire crypto space, I think there's a greater than 1% chance.
00:58:10.311 - 00:58:10.575, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:10.615 - 00:58:14.115, Speaker B: Everyone in their multi month delay.
00:58:15.735 - 00:58:16.959, Speaker A: This isn't that many orders.
00:58:17.007 - 00:58:35.665, Speaker B: I wonder, I wonder. Like it would be really interesting to look at all of the crypto launch markets and back test like the returns for every time a market hit 1% because I'm fairly certain it would be quite plus EV.
00:58:38.685 - 00:58:41.290, Speaker A: Crack an IPO in 2024.
00:58:41.615 - 00:58:56.465, Speaker B: IPO? Isn't Kraken launching a maybe an L2? Question mark? Was that Kraken or someone else? Okx? Okx already has an L2 I think. No Okx chain.
00:58:56.935 - 00:58:57.715, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:02.215 - 00:59:08.575, Speaker B: They still have that token, right? Was it okt or something? Remember when you hated that okb. That's what it was.
00:59:08.735 - 00:59:11.475, Speaker A: Oh yeah. Fuck okb.
00:59:12.575 - 00:59:25.535, Speaker B: It's worth 9 billion ftv. Oh dude. It's actually. It looks like it's outperformed eth like by quite a lot actually. Oh wait, I'm looking at the wrong time frame. Maybe not.
00:59:30.795 - 00:59:31.131, Speaker A: Tim.
00:59:31.163 - 00:59:31.771, Speaker B: I don't know. This thing.
00:59:31.803 - 00:59:38.575, Speaker A: Was John McAfee alive? How does this settle? This will never settle.
00:59:40.355 - 01:00:02.505, Speaker B: Well, scroll down to the settlement conditions. Hit show more. Hit show more. Is there a timing on it? Oh, okay, yeah. I mean it's gonna settle and he has to. That would be. That would be like wild, wild news.
01:00:03.605 - 01:00:08.305, Speaker A: In 2024 criminal charges.
01:00:08.685 - 01:00:34.631, Speaker B: I like Selkis. I don't care what anyone says. He's probably mentally ill. But I, I respect his mental ill. I respect his conviction even if I don't agree with everything he says. What else? We're going to talk about airdrop farming. There's nothing to airdrop farm.
01:00:34.631 - 01:01:00.401, Speaker B: I was, I, I, I benchmarked my portfolio the other day. I don't know if you saw. I sent a picture in in front running friends and like I was thinking about how I didn't actually like do the math but I was thinking about how. How much of those returns are just from airdrops. It's probably a lot. It's probably like a majority of it. So it's like the do I do now Just keep holding.
01:01:00.401 - 01:01:01.645, Speaker B: Ethan using money.
01:01:02.025 - 01:01:07.485, Speaker A: Can you go into no zones with size? What?
01:01:09.315 - 01:01:10.775, Speaker B: Just check the order book.
01:01:13.115 - 01:01:14.859, Speaker A: Can make a quick 2%. I guess.
01:01:14.907 - 01:01:17.495, Speaker B: You do not place. You do not place.
01:01:18.795 - 01:01:19.371, Speaker A: I wonder.
01:01:19.443 - 01:01:23.575, Speaker B: Don't place market orders on Poly Market. That is a terrible idea.
01:01:29.275 - 01:01:36.785, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. Pie market is fun and I like prediction markets as the.
01:01:38.525 - 01:02:01.665, Speaker B: It's a fun app. I'm not bearish on them by any means. I just think that, I mean I don't think it's an uncommon opinion, but I just think that they have to do something within the next month. Either launch a token or some other product or product improvement. Wouldn't be ideal, but it would be better than nothing. They just have to act. They got to do something.
01:02:05.085 - 01:02:06.625, Speaker A: Farming opportunities.
01:02:07.445 - 01:02:17.065, Speaker B: There's nothing where to go from here, really. You can wrap up here. I didn't like your title.
01:02:18.045 - 01:02:21.197, Speaker A: You're being. Dude. Do we have the clip?
01:02:21.301 - 01:02:22.221, Speaker B: Too heavy.
01:02:22.373 - 01:02:30.401, Speaker A: Do we have the clip? Do we have the clip? Did you name your three criteria? I think so. There's a good clip in there. Maybe.
01:02:30.473 - 01:02:32.085, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, it's in there somewhere.
01:02:32.385 - 01:02:33.081, Speaker A: Somewhere.
01:02:33.193 - 01:02:34.565, Speaker B: I don't want to force it.
01:02:35.385 - 01:02:36.325, Speaker A: What else?
01:02:38.705 - 01:02:45.401, Speaker B: Nothing else. We can, we can wrap up here. It's like just a Poly Market episode. Basically. That's what that was.
