00:00:00.200 - 00:00:57.150, Speaker A: We basically are introducing a new bid type that we're calling ebids. It allows the protocol to constantly update the exact price of your bid based on the current market condition and really reduces the chance that you're mispricing an option. But what's, what's really exciting to us about it is basically it takes this question of like how do I bid option from basically looking at every single option in the market and deciding if you're going to accept the price that's listed at, which is generally pretty challenging to instead just thinking about, okay, what are other people bidding using these bids in terms of the amount of volatility that they think is happening in that individual market and essentially how much volatility do you, I think is going to happen relative to that? And I can just place that bid and automatically buy options, or the protocol will automatically buy options on my behalf as I, as long as they keep that bid open. So we think it's going to be a great way for people who are seeking either that kind of levered long exposure on a collection to acquire more assets.
