00:00:00.320 - 00:00:06.810, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:08.150 - 00:00:28.140, Speaker B: Episode four of the Liquidity podcast. Today's Monday. Had to take a break from Sunday, but we're back on Monday. I like the Monday thing. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty cool with my hands.
00:00:28.680 - 00:00:39.152, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I just like doing it when I'm feeling like it. Like yesterday, like, I got home and I was. There's no way I can have, like, a critically thought out conversation right now.
00:00:39.216 - 00:00:41.568, Speaker B: Oh, these are definitely not critically thought out.
00:00:41.624 - 00:00:42.960, Speaker A: Yeah. But takes effort.
00:00:43.080 - 00:00:44.620, Speaker B: Are you in Bogota still?
00:00:45.120 - 00:00:59.280, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm leaving in three days. Two, four days, three days, something like that. I'm leaving Friday, and I'm actually sick of this place, to be honest. Not sick of it, but there's just nothing to do here. Like, besides, like, party over that for the time being.
00:01:00.100 - 00:01:09.580, Speaker B: Yeah. Wait, I don't know if you want to talk specifically about your bags, but I'm curious how the harvest is doing.
00:01:09.740 - 00:01:27.080, Speaker A: No, we can talk about. I tweeted about it. I'm in deep now. It's. I, like, flip flop every hour or so. It's weird because I've never held any collection that has this high of, like, a cost barrier to entry. And it's like, it did.
00:01:27.080 - 00:01:41.660, Speaker A: It did literally one sale today. Did one sale today, did four yesterday. And I'm worried it was, like, 10.8 eth, 10.9 almost. I'm worried because, first of all, I don't fully know how to evaluate these things. I just.
00:01:41.660 - 00:01:46.440, Speaker A: I had a good catalyst to enter, but I don't know how to manage the position now.
00:01:46.480 - 00:01:48.310, Speaker B: It's a catalyst to entertain.
00:01:49.160 - 00:01:55.856, Speaker A: Okay, number one, they're fucking cool. Yeah, I just think that looks sweet. Yeah. And a lot of people think that too.
00:01:55.928 - 00:01:57.940, Speaker B: The liver. Sick.
00:01:58.320 - 00:02:20.266, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people agree that this is, like, one of the best looking art blocks in a while. Also, like, that fact itself, the fact that I was seeing, like, a lot of, like, influential people tweet about how fucking cool they were and, like, how they were adding something to their vault, allegedly. And if you go, like, the top hold. I told you about this, but the top holders are all, like. Like, big fucking people.
00:02:20.266 - 00:02:31.762, Speaker A: Like, I looked at that other Jenn art collection you sent me, and, like, the top holders were, like, nobodies. Like, people who. People holding the same shit that we were holding, but now it's like, the top wallet.
00:02:31.866 - 00:02:37.482, Speaker B: Wait, like, what are the things they were holding that we were all, like, fucking cappies?
00:02:37.546 - 00:02:56.846, Speaker A: And like, this one of them had hawks. I've been back holding hawks for a while. I don't expect to do anything with hawk, but just like, shit. Basically illiquid shit. Whereas for harvest, there's like some punk holders in. There's a couple of pretty influential people in the Yugalabs ecosystem. The top, like, top holder is a really big jar collector.
00:02:56.846 - 00:03:10.330, Speaker A: From what I can see, this wallet is just a vault. But his vault is insane. He has so much good shit in here. So yeah, like, now, like, I'm happy with my position, but it also fucking sucks going a full 24 hours and only seeing one sale.
00:03:11.540 - 00:03:15.748, Speaker B: Especially not was it a floor scoop or was it.
00:03:15.924 - 00:03:25.980, Speaker A: That's one of the good things, is like, nothing. No one's really buying floor. Like, I think that's a good thing at least. Like, everybody's at least farming.
00:03:26.060 - 00:03:29.300, Speaker B: I expect theirs to do better than the floor rarity.
00:03:29.340 - 00:03:48.226, Speaker A: Or I think they could just be buying shit that they like, honestly. Because, like, I've been watching the one guy who's been, like, setting the floor, basically. He's been, like, playing around. I've been watching this collection way too fucking much. But this guy's just been moving his lift thing up and down every couple hours or so. It's at 9.85 right now.
00:03:48.226 - 00:04:10.318, Speaker A: No one's been batting an eye at it, but people are buying shit for 11, 12, 13. So I think people. And like, each one is so unique too. I don't like the term rarity for this, outside of maybe like, the background and some of the colors involved, but, like, some of them, some of the pieces just look so. Like their own. So it's like. It's hard to say that one is more rare than another.
00:04:10.318 - 00:04:21.690, Speaker A: It's more. So I think that definitely plays a factor. Like, it's not fully, like, nounish to the point where rarity doesn't mean anything, but it doesn't mean as much as it would in normal collection, I think.
00:04:22.630 - 00:04:29.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're from what we talked about, your outlook was like a few months out.
00:04:30.710 - 00:04:35.464, Speaker A: Yeah, but I didn't expect it to pop two x. Oh, yeah, because what was your entry?
00:04:35.512 - 00:04:38.648, Speaker B: Yeah, I know the dollar entry, but not the ETH entry.
00:04:38.704 - 00:04:44.140, Speaker A: I don't know the dollar entry. I know the ETH entry by ETH entry was 5.3084.
00:04:44.920 - 00:04:50.000, Speaker B: Oh, that's awesome. I thought you were in closer at eight or seven. I don't know.
00:04:50.120 - 00:04:52.272, Speaker A: No, I can. Yeah, I.
00:04:52.416 - 00:04:53.216, Speaker B: With a tennis.
00:04:53.288 - 00:05:12.260, Speaker A: I bought pretty close to the. I was the last. I was the third last sale, under six ethical. And then after that, it just fucking took off. That one Saturday just blew up. And I was expecting that same a little bit throughout the weekend and into Monday, but it's, it's been five sales the past like 48 hours, so it hasn't really.
00:05:13.400 - 00:05:15.888, Speaker B: I think people are overall, like, a bit hesitant.
00:05:15.944 - 00:05:32.138, Speaker A: It's just people are priced out now. Like, it's ten eth, dude. Not that many people have ten eth to just drop on a, on some Jen art. And like, the people who do are like, vaulting this shit and just not touching it especially. It's a difficult collection to play.
00:05:32.314 - 00:05:36.310, Speaker B: But what was the few months catalyst that you expected?
00:05:37.370 - 00:05:40.658, Speaker A: Like, at first I was just thinking people like this a lot, clearly.
00:05:40.714 - 00:05:42.026, Speaker B: Just like a solo build up.
00:05:42.098 - 00:06:19.824, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, people are going to be, people are going to be at this price, people are going to be accumulating and just locking it away, not listing it. Like the. There was very few listed and the floor plan, the floor price had been, like, increasing, but the number listed and going down, which told me that people who were buying were just taking it off the market. So I was thinking that would continue, like, that would continue on a general, like, uptrend for a little while. And then by the time it got to the point where people were writing threats, like, the same thing happened with friendship places. By the time it got to the point where people writing threads about it and shit, by then it would pop by like a good two x, three x or something.
00:06:19.824 - 00:06:33.006, Speaker A: And then that's when I would sell, when I started seeing threads. But I don't think that's feasible with a ten e collection. Nobody's tweeting about this and telling people to get in because fucking nobody can get in. It's almost a quarter of a hundred grand.
00:06:33.078 - 00:07:06.996, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, I'm just curious, like, what has to happen to bring projects of that size to that level. Because I feel like I never seen that happen in front of my face. Something like nouns. Nouns came out, like, not that long ago, and they went, like, nuts. Did you watch that? Did you watch that whole climb? I just haven't watched, like, a big, a tier nft, like, really climb. What caused those climbs? Like, what.
00:07:06.996 - 00:07:17.780, Speaker B: What people see for those kinds of things. Because you're right, the entry, the barrier to entry is so high. There has to be something else that happens where people feel like they have to spend that amount of money. You know what I mean?
00:07:17.860 - 00:07:29.044, Speaker A: Yeah. Nouns is a difficult example just because their models, like, completely different. I don't know what they look like. I would have loved to see what their early days look like, actually. What their first, like, five nouns look like.
00:07:29.092 - 00:07:29.468, Speaker B: But.
00:07:29.564 - 00:07:31.240, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know.
00:07:32.620 - 00:07:33.812, Speaker B: I feel like that's a better comparison.
00:07:33.836 - 00:07:49.036, Speaker A: It's hard to say. Cause the only real. The only nfts we've really seen at least watch, like, in front of our faces. Like, rise to prominence would be like, probably, I was gonna say pudgies. Checks are only two eats. Checks are. Checks are.
00:07:49.036 - 00:07:59.790, Speaker A: Nobody's priced out of checks yet. Or at least most people aren't. I would say Azuki's are up there. I mean, they're what, like 15 east now? Yeah, but I feel like they were, like, PFP.
00:07:59.830 - 00:08:04.358, Speaker B: So our hard comparison. Because it's like, it's.
00:08:04.414 - 00:08:04.814, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:04.902 - 00:08:09.654, Speaker B: More of a status thing. It's more of a status thing than, like, jenn art is because you can just rocket it.
00:08:09.702 - 00:08:11.490, Speaker A: Yeah. You know? Yeah.
00:08:12.630 - 00:08:19.610, Speaker B: Put, like, gen art behind their PFP. Do some, like, editing. But no one's. No one that. No one really wants to do that.
00:08:20.170 - 00:08:33.030, Speaker A: I've seen people use squiggles as pfps. But I think also the challenge is that, like, gen art is a lot more scarce. A lot of the good gen art collections are, like, sub 1000. Whereas, like, pfps, like, the standard is ten k. Yeah.
00:08:34.170 - 00:08:38.590, Speaker B: What is 500, 400. Yeah.
00:08:39.570 - 00:08:52.310, Speaker A: And then every. Any other general collection I can think of, like, big jnr collection I can think of is under a thousand or well, under a thousand, except for Squiggles is 9.7k.
00:08:54.770 - 00:08:56.194, Speaker B: Yeah. I just don't know what.
00:08:56.322 - 00:08:57.554, Speaker A: I don't know why you don't like them.
00:08:57.602 - 00:09:03.110, Speaker B: I don't like. I even. I shout out to Matt, but I just don't like that his PFP is the squiggle.
00:09:03.770 - 00:09:04.746, Speaker A: I think it's cool.
00:09:04.818 - 00:09:07.370, Speaker B: I think it's a terrible pfp. Like, I get the whole.
00:09:07.450 - 00:09:09.178, Speaker A: It works. Like, it's like.
00:09:09.234 - 00:09:10.090, Speaker B: But I'm not a fan.
00:09:10.170 - 00:09:29.186, Speaker A: I think it would be a lot. It would be a lot worse if more people use squiggles as profile pictures. Because there I only have maybe two people that I follow, like Matt being one of them who have a squiggle as a PFP. But if 20 people did, I would totally lose track of which fucking squiggles, which. Yeah, when it's just a couple, it's cool.
00:09:29.218 - 00:09:42.048, Speaker B: I think I still can't. I just get, like, Microsoft paint. Like, just screen, like, sniffing tool off Microsoft paint. Like vibes. I don't know.
00:09:42.184 - 00:09:42.552, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:42.616 - 00:09:59.768, Speaker B: I don't think. I'll ever be a fan, but I respect the whole movement, I guess. I honestly, I put harvest way above squiggles, way above in terms of. Terms of, like, personal preference and art and, like, the background behind it. Have you looked into the artist specifically at all?
00:09:59.824 - 00:10:08.100, Speaker A: Not really. I followed him on Twitter. He replied, I didn't really look into his background. Yeah, I don't really look into his background too much wisely.
00:10:08.410 - 00:10:17.538, Speaker B: No, I have no idea. I was wondering. Oh, no, maybe he does something. You know what I mean? That's the catalyst. How much volume has he had, I wonder?
00:10:17.634 - 00:10:19.082, Speaker A: I think it's three k, something like that.
00:10:19.106 - 00:10:21.230, Speaker B: Two and a half k wonder off of that.
00:10:24.530 - 00:10:26.550, Speaker A: The mint itself was, like, four e.
00:10:28.050 - 00:10:30.650, Speaker B: Art blocks is taking seven and a half.
00:10:30.730 - 00:10:56.108, Speaker A: Yeah, our blocks take. I wonder who, like, I wonder how art blocks decides who makes it into the curated, like section. Because if you're an artist and you get to launch a collection under art blocks curated, that's a big. That's got to be a big fucking payday. Even if you're making, like, 10% of what they're seeing, like, for. So this was a 400. A collection of 400.
00:10:56.108 - 00:11:15.094, Speaker A: Mint was, like four eth? I think. So that's like, 1600. Even 10% of that is what 160 eth for doing for, like, in the span. Obviously it's art. Like, it's hard to put a price on it, but in the span of a couple days, and then I don't even know if they get. I'm sure they get some sort of creator earnings, too.
00:11:15.262 - 00:11:15.902, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:16.046 - 00:11:19.690, Speaker A: Like, art blocks kind of has the power to just, like, king somebody like that.
00:11:20.750 - 00:11:26.724, Speaker B: I feel like. I would hope five and they take two and a half of the trading fees. That seems like a fair.
00:11:26.812 - 00:11:34.588, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anything about the art blocks team or what they are.
00:11:34.684 - 00:11:43.108, Speaker B: Like, maybe this. Maybe this gets you the air drops and it pays for itself, especially if this one or not air.
00:11:43.164 - 00:11:44.332, Speaker A: I know how many you get.
00:11:44.356 - 00:11:44.972, Speaker B: Whitelist.
00:11:45.076 - 00:12:03.438, Speaker A: The thing is, I don't know if that's how that works. I think the only, like, for airdrops, I think the only art blocks airdrop that I know was friendship bracelets, which, like, yeah, that was, like, 1.2 eth at its peak. Pretty cool. But whitelists, I don't know. All the. I'm only recently starting to pay more attention.
00:12:03.494 - 00:12:04.710, Speaker B: We should have gotten that on here.
00:12:04.750 - 00:12:08.494, Speaker A: Art blocks, new drops. Yeah, we probably should have the art.
00:12:08.542 - 00:12:11.686, Speaker B: Blocks community give us a rundown on.
00:12:11.798 - 00:12:19.704, Speaker A: I don't know how in. He is with them. I don't know anything. They're like shadows to me. Everybody knows their name. I can't put a face to it. I don't know who is.
00:12:19.704 - 00:12:35.600, Speaker A: Yeah, but, yeah, I don't know. I don't think there's like a. I don't think there's too much, like, whitelist capability with having one of these collections. I think everything's just the public mint. It's just they're usually prohibitively expensive with the. With the curated collections.
00:12:36.380 - 00:12:49.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think it's a good play. I'm gonna be honest, if it was me, I'd take the two x and run, but I know you're not. You're probably not gonna. You got.
00:12:49.490 - 00:13:01.146, Speaker A: I don't know what I would get filled at even. Do I have an offer? Maybe I have an offer standing. I haven't checked it in a while. I don't know. It's whole. It's like people aren't listing much lower. Like, people aren't buying, but people aren't selling either.
00:13:01.146 - 00:13:13.830, Speaker A: So I don't know. It's hard to. Hard to say no. I don't have any offers on this. There's a collection offer of 70, so if I wanted to liquidate immediately, I could still take a 1.78 profit. But I don't know.
00:13:13.830 - 00:13:18.040, Speaker A: I don't know. That's. I'm not gonna do. That's for sure. Not yet.
00:13:19.460 - 00:13:24.540, Speaker B: Yeah. It'll be funny to look back on this and see what happens.
00:13:24.620 - 00:13:35.092, Speaker A: When it goes to. When it goes to. When it goes to half an eight, I'm left. I don't think. I think worst case scenario, I'm not letting it. I'm selling out three. Honestly, if it gets to that three.
00:13:35.092 - 00:13:35.844, Speaker A: But I don't think most.
00:13:35.892 - 00:13:37.160, Speaker B: You're holding through five.
00:13:38.140 - 00:13:38.920, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:39.270 - 00:13:40.606, Speaker B: Really? Maybe.
00:13:40.678 - 00:13:46.370, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to say because, like, I know a lot of people who I entered.
00:13:46.790 - 00:13:58.822, Speaker B: Yeah. A lot of people entered together, I feel. And that door is going to close very fast. And if you don't, if you have a reason to sell, other people don't have. Feel like they have a reason to buy, so there's not going to be too much demand. I feel like.
00:13:58.846 - 00:14:23.648, Speaker A: I don't know about entered together, but in my mind, a lot of. From what I saw on socials, a lot of people who had already made it, essentially. Essentially, a lot of rich people entered and they entered to have as, like, a part of their collection because they thought it was fucking cool. And they just wanted a piece, whereas me. Yes, I think it's cool. Like, it's definitely, like the sweetest nft I've ever owned. But at the same time, like, that's 20 grand, dude.
00:14:23.648 - 00:14:38.604, Speaker A: Like, I have to be liquidating this at some point. So I'm definitely thinking about it differently than the rest of then. Not the rest. A good bit of the holder bases. I've been thinking about it, but.
00:14:38.692 - 00:14:39.276, Speaker B: Because if we.
00:14:39.308 - 00:14:41.360, Speaker A: I've been thinking I should be. But no.
00:14:43.140 - 00:14:45.320, Speaker B: Because if we tank from here, then.
00:14:46.620 - 00:14:51.332, Speaker A: I don't know, I'm always long east, like, what's, what difference whether it goes up or down?
00:14:51.396 - 00:14:52.700, Speaker B: Like, yeah.
00:14:52.820 - 00:15:20.630, Speaker A: In our lives, whether I sell this thing or nothing. Like the money, the least exposure that, like, investment will have will be in liquid eth. If I sell it, I'm not putting any of it into us. I'm not diversifying the bitcoin or bonds or whatever the fuck. Like, it's going to stay in ETH at best. At best, it stays in ETH. At worst, it gets distributed across ten different, like, shitty, like 0.20.02
00:15:20.630 - 00:15:22.702, Speaker A: eth nfts that I'm trying to flip.
00:15:22.766 - 00:15:28.592, Speaker B: Like, did you pull the trigger on that one that you sent today?
00:15:28.776 - 00:15:35.976, Speaker A: No, I was joking about that one, actually. I was. I sent the six. I sent it because the, because of the tagline or, like, the description.
00:15:36.048 - 00:15:36.784, Speaker B: The art is not.
00:15:36.832 - 00:15:37.700, Speaker A: It was like.
00:15:42.440 - 00:15:46.936, Speaker B: That's why I was like, no way. He's serious. Here, run it back. I'm like, please.
00:15:47.008 - 00:15:54.066, Speaker A: No, this is, I mean, think this is a different guy who just liked the phrasing, thought he could move it around and no one would notice.
00:15:54.138 - 00:15:57.842, Speaker B: This guy just made it to Riv. Derivative of the nine zone.
00:15:57.906 - 00:16:03.350, Speaker A: Well. Oh, yeah, that. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's a derivative, definitely. But I was talking about, like, the non thing.
00:16:04.450 - 00:16:10.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually accidentally went on that Twitter again. The abstractions.
00:16:10.962 - 00:16:11.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:11.450 - 00:16:32.976, Speaker B: And like, the. I'm pretty sure the pinned tweet is. Oh, like we're getting audited by, like, a developer. Trust us. Like, I think the last thing that they were supposed to drop just didn't happen because they got hacked to shit. And then they're just sitting and waiting until they get this audit before anybody clicks on anything, which is great.
00:16:33.008 - 00:16:41.620, Speaker A: I think we should buy checks. Oh, you're not another at two eth. I know they're at two e. Oh, no.
00:16:42.870 - 00:16:45.130, Speaker B: Are they, like. They're burning shit, right?
00:16:45.670 - 00:16:58.374, Speaker A: They're burning Jack just keeps. He keep. I don't know if they're burning yet. But he just keeps changing the. He just keeps changing, like, the checks. Like, yesterday there was, like, in the shape of a pepe. Today they're in the shape of 1 billion punk.
00:16:58.422 - 00:17:00.518, Speaker B: Wait, he's changing all of them at one?
00:17:00.574 - 00:17:02.730, Speaker A: Yeah, he's just changing the metadata.
00:17:05.350 - 00:17:12.056, Speaker B: Jeez, Mandev. That sucks. That sucks. That one hurts, man.
00:17:12.208 - 00:17:15.664, Speaker A: That was literally 100 x from man. Wait.
00:17:15.832 - 00:17:18.300, Speaker B: Yeah, we weren't looking at mint, though.
00:17:18.760 - 00:17:32.600, Speaker A: Yeah, but still we're looking at point. First time I saw it, it was like. .05 I just didn't think much of it. And then I saw a different Jack butcher collection that was like the fucking, like, network whatever was. I was like, oh, dude, this is it. This is the one.
00:17:32.720 - 00:17:34.344, Speaker B: You really like that one?
00:17:34.512 - 00:17:42.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I got a two x. Yeah, I sold like two out of three for a two x. And then I think I still have one.
00:17:44.520 - 00:17:46.100, Speaker B: Damn checks, man.
00:17:46.920 - 00:18:03.352, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know. Yes, they were also. They had, like, the brown, like a bunch of skin tones not long ago. I don't understand. Are they burning yet? I don't. I, like, don't want to keep up just because, like, I'm upset about them.
00:18:03.536 - 00:18:04.648, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'm not.
00:18:04.744 - 00:18:07.192, Speaker A: I don't want to pay attention even.
00:18:07.216 - 00:18:20.620, Speaker B: Though it's, like, impossible to avoid all of these, like, text memes and all this shit, like, every project is doing, though, with everything. Oh, yeah. He just changed it to punks.
00:18:21.200 - 00:18:30.260, Speaker A: What. What can we. What do we learn from this? What? People are buying this shit for two eth, dude, I can't, like, consistently.
00:18:31.420 - 00:18:37.920, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. What do we learn from this? I think follower count. Yeah.
00:18:38.300 - 00:18:42.884, Speaker A: Big name leader with an already established brand. I guess you didn't know about, like, visualize value.
00:18:43.012 - 00:19:23.520, Speaker B: I didn't. But I should have realized, like, with a 300K follower count and the whole brand is the idea of brands and branding and marketing. Their whole stick was like, being able to market yourself. We should have known that these guys. I should have known that this guy was gonna be, like a fucking insane marketer. I just thought. I just didn't think he was as in the NFT ecosystem as it's shown that he is, like, the way that he's literally, like, pulling on people's emotions like, every day, basically with all these, like, new things and they put out fucking merch already.
00:19:24.220 - 00:19:30.998, Speaker A: I think it's also just like, how easily, like, like, you can make a derivative out of these for literally anything.
00:19:31.054 - 00:19:31.662, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:19:31.766 - 00:19:39.950, Speaker A: Yeah, literally anything. Like, it's so just like, malleable like, you can do anything with them, really.
00:19:39.990 - 00:19:42.970, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure Gabriel Haynes just made one.
00:19:43.270 - 00:19:45.014, Speaker A: He did, like, a machete.
00:19:45.062 - 00:19:49.294, Speaker B: Open edition. Yeah, the open edition. Metal. I don't. Like.
00:19:49.342 - 00:19:52.170, Speaker A: I'm not a huge fan of that, to be honest. I don't really.
00:19:53.000 - 00:19:54.100, Speaker B: I hate all.
00:19:55.480 - 00:19:58.376, Speaker A: I don't know, like, what's the point, really?
00:19:58.448 - 00:20:01.620, Speaker B: I guess it seems like such a quick money grab.
00:20:04.440 - 00:20:10.152, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, like, real. It's like trying too hard to make fomo, like, to induce fomo.
00:20:10.216 - 00:20:13.140, Speaker B: Dude. In the fact that people, like, played into this.
00:20:16.600 - 00:20:22.868, Speaker A: By the time people did that, it was like. Like this thing had already reached escape velocity by then. Like, it's.
00:20:22.964 - 00:20:33.280, Speaker B: Yeah, but I feel like that probably adds, like, a whole eth of, like, floor price and, like, perspective.
00:20:33.620 - 00:20:35.040, Speaker A: I don't know about that.
00:20:35.500 - 00:21:01.280, Speaker B: I think so. I think he's gonna do something. I don't think he's gonna tweet about something like that without collaborating in some way and knowing what we know about Jack. Now, I feel like he's gonna do. They're gonna do something significant together. Cause at this point, he has the grasp of the entire NFT market and he's held onto it for a good five days, close to a week.
00:21:03.380 - 00:21:05.716, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know.
00:21:05.748 - 00:21:06.092, Speaker B: Sucks.
00:21:06.156 - 00:21:13.378, Speaker A: I'm just upset is all. Well, I feel like we're going to.
00:21:13.394 - 00:21:15.114, Speaker B: Have a lot of those, though. I feel like I've had.
00:21:15.162 - 00:21:37.738, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it happens. I've already had a lot. I don't know. I guess technically I saw punks when they were at like 1.5. I didn't know what the fuck they were, what the hell eth was, but I did see them, but, yeah, but it was like. Because, like, open. Open tier, like some NFT marketplace was like when I was first learning about it, those were like, the first dapps I saw, and it was like $300 at the time for a punk.
00:21:37.738 - 00:21:45.980, Speaker A: And I was like, why the hell would someone spend $300 on this shit? Like, it's. It, like, doesn't even look that good. It's five pixels. What are these people thinking?
00:21:46.320 - 00:21:52.660, Speaker B: And, yeah, what else do we got? So this. Our nft is going to save us.
00:21:54.400 - 00:21:56.260, Speaker A: NFT is going to save us.
00:21:56.720 - 00:22:02.280, Speaker B: We're at. Not to jump in as the macro guy, but we're at, like, a pretty pivotal point.
00:22:02.360 - 00:22:06.176, Speaker A: Let me see how my green line is looking right now. That's the only thing that matters.
00:22:06.208 - 00:22:07.744, Speaker B: Let's share screen. On the green line.
00:22:07.792 - 00:22:17.470, Speaker A: On the green line. Yeah, I got you. Oh, you gotta give me. Access says disabled. Oh, we're well above the green line right now. Anyways. We already broke out of it.
00:22:17.470 - 00:22:20.070, Speaker A: God, I sound like such a fucking virgin.
00:22:21.610 - 00:22:31.630, Speaker B: The green line. I have no idea how to give you access. Allow participants to share screen. You should have it. Oh, no, there you go.
00:22:32.570 - 00:22:56.080, Speaker A: I got it. All right, so anyways, this is the green line. So this is my entire macro strategy is this one line and on the S and P 500. And as you can see, it's performed. I think I drew it like probably drew it like close to December. I think, like we got close. We actually, we opened right at it and then we nuked.
00:22:56.080 - 00:23:11.774, Speaker A: It was like, damn, if I had been paying attention, that would have been a good opportunity. And then right here, we tried to break out of it. Then we did break out of it. So I don't know, maybe we go back down and we like flirt with it a little bit and then we go back up. Yeah, I don't know. It could be a thing. I don't know.
00:23:11.774 - 00:23:23.086, Speaker A: I'm not a fucking doctor. I was looking at it. What was I looking at a second ago? It's cool. So like announce auction, like thing. Like a more better alternative to this thing. Whoops.
00:23:23.238 - 00:23:23.702, Speaker B: What are they?
00:23:23.726 - 00:23:30.390, Speaker A: Just better alternative to this thing. It's an ongoing option. It's. This is what they. This is what the actual site looks like. But this one.
00:23:30.970 - 00:23:32.870, Speaker B: Why is that going for 27?
00:23:34.130 - 00:23:35.930, Speaker A: Cuz it's a fucking noun. What do you mean?
00:23:36.010 - 00:23:41.058, Speaker B: Oh, that's it. Did I saw like the only real thing they do is share treasury.
00:23:41.194 - 00:24:08.854, Speaker A: Yeah, but you know what they do with that treasury, dude, nouns is fucking nouns is like, if I could be a part of any dow, like, financial upside being one thing, but just like for the vibes and obviously financial upside being. Being a thing. Like I would hands down, like, get a noun and join this. There's. So it's essentially like. It's essentially just like crowdfunding, but. And the Dow votes on what to fund and they essentially, they build up their treasury by auctioning nouns.
00:24:08.854 - 00:24:45.928, Speaker A: So, like, you sell noun each day for 30 Eth, you're making 30 Eth a day for your treasury. Your treasury also has some amount of nouns. How many nouns are in here? But there's some nouns in the treasury. I have a 45 mil treasury and they just fun shit. Like, like, for example, is it like nars, something like that? Yeah. So this is like a sub dap where like, basically the premise is that like, with a lot of different fields and like extreme sports, incentives are misaligned for who is, like, for how athletes are paid. Like, why is Red Bull or, like, monster funding.
00:24:45.928 - 00:25:03.722, Speaker A: Funding? Like, athletes, they like, that shit's not good for you. Kids who look up to these athletes are gonna see that stuff. And it's. Obviously, it's not the most egregious example, but it's a thing. So nouns is like, all right, that's cool. Let's make a subdow, and let's fund these athletes ourselves, and we'll use the branding. Have you seen.
00:25:03.722 - 00:25:26.122, Speaker A: I don't know if you've seen that vid. There's, like, an intro video for now that's, like, super high quality that, like, I didn't think they mentioned, like, crypto or web3 or. I think they mentioned decentralized in it, but, like, you can. It's just like a. It's just like a cool video, like, a cool intro. It has nothing, like, you would not know that it has anything to do with crypto. It's really just like a crowdfunding platform, really.
00:25:26.122 - 00:25:32.954, Speaker A: I know they were trying to, like. Yeah, this one was. I think I voted on, like, a multi thing. What do you mean?
00:25:33.082 - 00:25:38.362, Speaker B: Is there treasury and just like a multi sig. Like a. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:25:38.386 - 00:25:45.160, Speaker A: They vote on, like, that. The dow, they were just voting. They were just voting the other day on. What was it on stake.
00:25:45.200 - 00:25:45.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:45.440 - 00:26:06.214, Speaker A: Staking an additional 5000. I vote in these sometimes because the lil nouns now has nine nouns, and each noun is one vote. Like, each noun is one vote, but little nouns, there's, like, 10,000 of those. So, like, we all get to choose how to allocate our nine votes together. It's pretty cool, honestly. Like, you get to feel like you're doing something even though you're not. What was the.
00:26:06.214 - 00:26:10.162, Speaker A: There was one where they're gonna just look at one of them, but how.
00:26:10.186 - 00:26:12.430, Speaker B: Do they get executed, exactly?
00:26:13.490 - 00:26:21.690, Speaker A: What do you mean? Okay, to fund Zach proposed to fund Zack.
00:26:21.810 - 00:26:26.790, Speaker B: So who goes in and types in Zack XBT's eth?
00:26:27.290 - 00:26:48.786, Speaker A: The same as any other doubt. Someone submits a proposal, they say, hey, look right here. Let's send 100 ETH to zachxbt eth, and then they vote on it, and it gets done. This is a very simple, like, a very simple. Probably the most simple example you can find, though. Like, he's got the NS domain. It's literally just transferring ETH.
00:26:48.786 - 00:27:10.076, Speaker A: Some of them are a bit more complicated, just especially because people managing them. Yeah, there's, like, stuff in the real world that's, like, this one bring downs to 2 million people. Like, you have to rely on some. This one's actually really cool. They're bringing nouns to the biggest ski resort in Japan or something like that. Or is that. Jesus Christ.
00:27:10.076 - 00:27:21.580, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's the same in any case, but it's different. What? Can I mint this? No, I guess it's different. One. Fuck. I guess I can mint it. That's cool. Yeah, it's different when there's a real world element involved.
00:27:21.580 - 00:27:29.290, Speaker A: There has to be some sort of trusted party there. Maybe that's, I don't know how it works at that end. Maybe that's where something like nars comes in or some other organization.
00:27:29.420 - 00:27:30.030, Speaker B: That's pretty cool.
00:27:30.070 - 00:27:31.582, Speaker A: Free managers.
00:27:31.686 - 00:27:35.142, Speaker B: I just don't get why. I just don't get why no one was able to replicate this.
00:27:35.206 - 00:27:42.158, Speaker A: It's an entirely new, like, revenue model, or not new, but it's an entirely unique revenue model. Like nouns and nouns.
00:27:42.214 - 00:27:43.270, Speaker B: Yeah, but when was launched?
00:27:43.310 - 00:27:49.686, Speaker A: Let's say 2001, late 2001, maybe.
00:27:49.878 - 00:27:51.210, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:27:51.830 - 00:27:59.454, Speaker A: Nouns. There's 600 of them. Oh, sorry. 2021. Not 2001. Yeah, August 2021.
00:27:59.502 - 00:28:00.030, Speaker B: Oh, that's.
00:28:00.110 - 00:28:30.816, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's like a whole, like, you have all these different revenue models for, like, organizations in web3. And this is, I think I sent you that read a while ago from Mason from variant, where, like, he talked about a couple of different, like, revenue models in web3. And one of the ones he talked about was, like, the nounished model, which is which. It really only works if you have a brand with this kind of power and, like, this kind of effectiveness. But it's like, at least obviously it inflates to zero. I hate when people say that to me about nows. It's like, kind of a trigger for me.
00:28:30.816 - 00:28:38.768, Speaker A: They're like, oh, they admit forever. Like, it's going to go to, yeah, dingus, how long is the 1000, 10,000 days? Tell me, like, how long before we get there?
00:28:38.824 - 00:28:42.536, Speaker B: But it started off with, what, one, two, five?
00:28:42.728 - 00:28:53.580, Speaker A: It started off with one. They minted one. The next day they minted another. The very next day I minted another. And they kept doing that. And now 600 days later, they've got 600 of them.
00:28:55.160 - 00:28:56.040, Speaker B: That's pretty cool.
00:28:56.120 - 00:28:56.952, Speaker A: Nouns are cool.
00:28:57.016 - 00:29:02.320, Speaker B: That's pretty cool. I just don't see. I just don't see why no one's replicated it yet, to be honest.
00:29:02.400 - 00:29:29.138, Speaker A: I think it's because the challenge. The challenge is, like, the challenge is having a strong enough brand behind it. Not only a strong enough brand, but also an actually, like, effective brand that does shit like nouns does, because you have to be. You have to have enough demand in each of these auctions for this to be, like, feasible, like, low mounds. I'm sure they don't. I'm sure they don't. They don't, like, auction off, or they don't, like, have winners of each auction.
00:29:29.138 - 00:29:36.802, Speaker A: Like, they can't. It's not feasible. They won down every 15 minutes forever. What the fuck? No one's gonna be snapping up every single one of those.
00:29:36.906 - 00:29:38.830, Speaker B: Is there a base auction.
00:29:41.170 - 00:29:56.782, Speaker A: For low mounds? For low nouns? For low mounds, it's probably five, but I don't think they, I don't think that the. I don't think the auction starts until the first bit is placed for nouns. I would imagine each one gets stacked up just because the supply is still so low.
00:29:56.926 - 00:30:06.450, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm also convinced that talking about it and he. The way he described, like, the way that nouns.
00:30:07.630 - 00:30:08.890, Speaker A: What is Dao like?
00:30:09.190 - 00:30:22.408, Speaker B: It's that one guy from Holly chain that started his own fund that's transitioning into a dao. They raised a good amount of money. It had a lot of publicity in the beginning. The bull market.
00:30:22.534 - 00:30:34.484, Speaker A: A lot of really smart people like nouns. Yeah, variant. Variant has a whole. I'm convinced variant has actually, I'm just now seeing. They've. They own. They have disclosed owning a number of nouns.
00:30:34.484 - 00:30:45.000, Speaker A: They disclose out two months ago, I remember Dan had always known about nouns, but, like, when I bought mine, he, like, looked into him. A little boring. He was like, dude, these things are fucking sweet. I got to get in on this.
00:30:45.860 - 00:31:14.056, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think, like, the reason I'm saying, like, why has it been. Why hasn't it been replicated is because to me, like, that power in terms of, like, marketing as well, comes from the money in general. It's. It has. It can't be a shit idea with a shit ton of money. But, like, that, it doesn't have to be that good if it has enough money, because anyone be bidding on these?
00:31:14.248 - 00:31:14.896, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:15.008 - 00:31:26.992, Speaker B: Like, really? They disclose how many they have. But, like, for all we know, they could have been behind since. Behind it, since we're, like, 20 and just inflating.
00:31:27.056 - 00:31:29.864, Speaker A: And then if you have, it's a dow.
00:31:29.952 - 00:31:38.624, Speaker B: Yeah. So it could be any ETH address. Any of these ETh addresses from the beginning. Could be, like, Nevc that has, like, a pocketbook.
00:31:38.672 - 00:31:41.640, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. There's nobody.
00:31:41.680 - 00:31:43.536, Speaker B: At least one, but I don't know.
00:31:43.568 - 00:31:56.620, Speaker A: I think it's. I think there's levels to it. Like, obviously, like, you need to have. You need to generate demand for this, like, consistent auction in order to do that, you need to have a good brand and good ideas for how you're going to use the funds in order to do that.
00:31:56.700 - 00:32:00.148, Speaker B: It's proposals. I feel like it's the proposals and the things they do that get.
00:32:00.204 - 00:32:39.152, Speaker A: So then it's like any dow. Yeah, well, any dow where you just need good members. That's all it is. If the Lao or the flamingo were to go and start some model like this to fund part of their investments, like, they would have people lining up, like, a lot of people would be interested in that. Like daos. Daos are really hard to evaluate until they've reached the point where it's already, like, consensus, just because there's no way to know how effective they are without knowing the people in them. And, like, seeing what the discussion is like, until you reach the level of something like nouns, where it's known, and, like, you can see, like, what they're, like, the impact of what they're doing in real time.
00:32:39.216 - 00:33:05.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I think nouns is. I just think it's. I think it's doable to mimic it if you do the right things. I think it, it's a large commitment, but I don't see the, no, I do see the moat that they have, but I just don't get why I haven't seen more of them. Like, why haven't there been so many of these, like, derivatives? You know what I feel like with any successful NFT project, the derivatives are there.
00:33:06.530 - 00:33:06.978, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:07.034 - 00:33:18.282, Speaker B: Why hasn't that, especially, like, when a Dow model works so well, when no Dow model works right now, it's like, why hasn't that been mimic for so many other things?
00:33:18.306 - 00:33:40.924, Speaker A: What it could be is, number one, I think nouns has only recently come, Nasdao has only recently come under the spotlight over the past, like two, maybe three. Even then, I don't think it's as much of a spotlight as they deserve. In addition to that, there was a proposal I saw back in November, October maybe. I wish I could find it. It was essentially like, I'm curious as.
00:33:40.932 - 00:33:47.844, Speaker B: To what's getting you and other people like to click on, and I just, to pay in the governance. I feel like that's the participating governance.
00:33:47.892 - 00:33:53.572, Speaker A: Like it's for shits. Like, honestly, I'm trying to be more than, because it's there.
00:33:53.676 - 00:33:57.036, Speaker B: What's the voting percentage of holders on nouns?
00:33:57.108 - 00:34:10.946, Speaker A: That's a good question. I'm not sure. It depends, actually. Let me look at the Zack proposal. That was probably, like the most active one. Looks like about a third of all nouns voted in this one, which is pretty good. That's really fucking good, actually.
00:34:10.946 - 00:34:40.080, Speaker A: That's really good. Let's see one of the newer ones. These are still penny, but anyway, as I was saying, the proposal I saw a while ago is essentially it was like a framework to allow this model to become easily forked. Like you can, you cannot change the art at all. If you want, you can just have it be a way to set up a Dao. Set up like a crowdfunding platform, an investment platform, whatever, and just fund it by auctioning off now. Like, you can either auction off nows that look similar to this with different traits, or you can make your own art or whatever.
00:34:40.080 - 00:35:01.368, Speaker A: It's just like a hub or like a framework to eat for any. For anyone to easily do this. Essentially. That proposal passed a couple months ago, I think so. Like, it's totally feasible to go and do it, I think. I'm also seeing this proposal for the japanese ski resort. It looks like 282 nouns voted in it, which is almost half.
00:35:01.368 - 00:35:02.424, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:35:02.552 - 00:35:23.240, Speaker B: Did they do things that, like, in the beginning when they weren't raising as much and they didn't have as much in their treasury and they didn't have as many things that they were be that what they would be able to do? Like, what do they do in that? What did they do in that situation that took speaker one?
00:35:23.240 - 00:35:26.720, Speaker A: We can see, we can see. We can go. Are you guys giving me screen sharing accent?
00:35:26.760 - 00:35:34.128, Speaker B: I think this is like more like about the reason I'm so intrigued is like just the data aspect of it.
00:35:34.184 - 00:35:39.872, Speaker A: You can, you can see it's really cool because we're at proposal 230 right now, and you can go back, go all the way back and see the.
00:35:39.896 - 00:35:41.660, Speaker B: Future is not a lot.
00:35:42.240 - 00:35:43.304, Speaker A: No, it's not.
00:35:43.392 - 00:35:46.424, Speaker B: Honestly, they've been $45 million treasury.
00:35:46.552 - 00:36:05.724, Speaker A: They've been pumping the fuck out recently. There's been a lot coming out. And you also have to consider a lot of these don't pass too. It's a good group. It's a good group of people. But anyways, so if you look at these, it's like stake 5000, Ethan Lido, bring nouns to 2 million people at Japan's best ski resorts. Take another 5000 podcasts.
00:36:05.724 - 00:36:07.040, Speaker A: Now it's funding Zak.
00:36:07.620 - 00:36:15.040, Speaker B: Is it a good group of people or is it a fucking rich group of people? Is that. What is the difference maker? I get it.
00:36:15.580 - 00:36:50.964, Speaker A: I think that's where the brand comes in, because I think there's like the kind of people associated with nouns, at least from what I've gathered, the few people I know who have nouns, who are more interested in nouns are, like, full on ogs. People who have been around for a long time. People who like nouns aren't the most well known NFT. Let's be honest. Pudgies are way more well known. Azuki's, punks, obviously apes, all these. Plenty of other NFT checks.
00:36:50.964 - 00:37:00.468, Speaker A: Czechs are bigger than now at this point. So, like, they're not well known enough for someone to just have money and come and dump it in there. You also have to have a level of the treasury kind of understand the vision.
00:37:00.604 - 00:37:26.532, Speaker B: The treasury is the part that, like, I'm focused on. Like, those other projects that are, well, more well known. Like, their motto is the creator. Creator, fee model. Like, what did nouns do so well that built the treasury? It's a 47. What is that, a $47 million treasury?
00:37:26.596 - 00:37:36.948, Speaker A: You have to consider nouns. Nouns, makes. I don't know what the average is, but I would guess somewhere between 30 and 50 eth daily just from the auction that they do.
00:37:37.004 - 00:37:40.684, Speaker B: But when did the treasury get big? Okay, so the first proposal was to donate.
00:37:40.772 - 00:37:49.864, Speaker A: We can see. I think we can take that. We can take the. We can take the address and plug it into a D. Bank it into a wallet track or somewhere or something.
00:37:49.912 - 00:37:55.112, Speaker B: Yeah, because were they doing things that made them money or were they only doing things that.
00:37:55.216 - 00:38:07.184, Speaker A: That's. I think that's what sets them apart is, for the most part at least, the proposals I see now, the proposals I've seen since I started paying attention aren't really. They aren't exactly like money.
00:38:07.232 - 00:38:09.020, Speaker B: They're making money with Lido.
00:38:10.000 - 00:38:20.630, Speaker A: Yeah. They have a lot of fucking staked. There's that. What is. What time frame is this on this. On, like, a day. Can I see, like, a year? History.
00:38:20.630 - 00:38:32.190, Speaker A: I actually have used D bank, like, twice, maybe zapier. I don't want it. Zap. What? Xero. Zapier.
00:38:32.270 - 00:38:36.246, Speaker B: Zapier. Yeah. I don't know why I added an I in there.
00:38:36.278 - 00:38:53.700, Speaker A: Can we see it on ether? Can we see it on ether scan? I swear, we can just see it on ether scan. Check previous ether balance. Oh, dude. Block date. Let's just go on the fucking way back. What was it? August 20, 222 21. Please don't show me a snapshot of the date.
00:38:54.280 - 00:38:55.016, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:55.128 - 00:39:12.686, Speaker A: What is this? What is this? No, this is. That's not what we want. Select the date for the balance. I can't lie. All right, anyways, click on the. They had around, but within the first month, they started around 600. They were up to 3000.
00:39:12.686 - 00:39:16.930, Speaker A: So those auctions were printing early on. They had interest very early on.
00:39:19.150 - 00:39:30.010, Speaker B: Wait, what's the first day? Yeah, there it is. Oh, you can't go past on a. Try that. Yeah, I can't go past what?
00:39:30.630 - 00:39:37.528, Speaker A: I don't know. This is fucking stupid. And what was the question? Like, we're just trying to see like the trend.
00:39:37.624 - 00:39:39.576, Speaker B: What do they start with? Yeah, what do they have?
00:39:39.608 - 00:39:43.140, Speaker A: Three. They had 3008th around the first month. And now they're.
00:39:44.960 - 00:39:47.220, Speaker B: 3000 for one person.
00:39:48.240 - 00:40:04.972, Speaker A: It's the first month, so it could have been. I don't know. I don't know exactly what day they launched, but it could have been up to 30. They could have. They could have sold each one for ten e. Make. I know, 100 e and they make 303,000.
00:40:04.972 - 00:40:10.148, Speaker A: Fuck. My masks all fucked up. But it's. It like, it makes it. Let's just.
00:40:10.204 - 00:40:17.052, Speaker B: You can't get. You can't get people to buy a harvest for ten eth right now. And you tell me, yeah, we're buying a hundred eth.
00:40:17.116 - 00:40:21.108, Speaker A: A hundred er eth was first person. Now people were rich.
00:40:21.164 - 00:40:28.918, Speaker B: Back in a Zoom call for people. You're telling me people paid 100 e to be a part of it?
00:40:29.014 - 00:40:30.870, Speaker A: Maybe. Maybe they didn't pay. Maybe they pay.
00:40:30.910 - 00:40:34.262, Speaker B: I'm telling you. Variant. Pump this from the start, bro.
00:40:34.446 - 00:40:39.286, Speaker A: No, that's my very. Wasn't the powerhouse they used to be back then.
00:40:39.318 - 00:40:40.050, Speaker B: I think.
00:40:41.590 - 00:40:46.486, Speaker A: Look at this. If you assume each now sold for 300 e, then that puts them out.
00:40:46.518 - 00:40:59.080, Speaker B: Think about how hard it is to get, I guess. August 2320. Something different time. But getting 3000 Ethan a month in volume alone is not easy. At least now it's not.
00:40:59.460 - 00:41:12.220, Speaker A: Man. I don't know. I don't. We couldn't, we weren't. We could honestly dig more into this and find out that this is like startup capital or something like that. Maybe it's not all from the nouns, but what was that? The thing that I was initially gonna show was these first proposals. I think it's pretty fucking cool.
00:41:12.220 - 00:41:19.916, Speaker A: Donate five each to six charities. They're talking about staking six. They're talking about staking 5000 eth now. And here. Let's give out 30 eth.
00:41:19.948 - 00:41:21.640, Speaker B: So who were the nouns that voted.
00:41:23.630 - 00:41:39.210, Speaker A: These guys now? Eight. Noun two. Noun one. Noun six. Oh, who is this? Who's noun one fucking what's. What was the name? Zai Zvolt.
00:41:40.590 - 00:41:42.090, Speaker B: It's fucking Vitalik.
00:41:43.470 - 00:42:00.644, Speaker A: I would. Do you think this has been trick? He's got a fox for a head. That's fucking sweet. I has it moved? No. Just kept the shit this whole time. Who is this guy? Oh, he's a punk holder. He's a multiple punk holder.
00:42:00.772 - 00:42:05.556, Speaker B: That's what I'm saying, dude. This is a fund. I don't care what anyone says. This is a fun dude.
00:42:05.588 - 00:42:19.348, Speaker A: He. If you get in. If you get in from unknowns from day one, like, odds are you probably got into punks early too. Now, what the hell is this? Every day is. Oh, my God. This poor guy. He spent 69 eth on this shit.
00:42:19.524 - 00:42:20.132, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:42:20.156 - 00:42:21.080, Speaker A: What is this?
00:42:21.940 - 00:42:24.676, Speaker B: I was just about to say it might be a roller or something like that.
00:42:24.708 - 00:42:27.480, Speaker A: I don't know. What is this thing?
00:42:28.260 - 00:42:39.900, Speaker B: All right, we're off. We're off is what are we thinking for whether or not this NfT run that we're seeing right now does anything for us, sends us to the promised.
00:42:39.940 - 00:42:43.628, Speaker A: Land, like, I don't think it does.
00:42:43.764 - 00:42:44.428, Speaker B: You don't?
00:42:44.524 - 00:42:55.924, Speaker A: I don't know. What's going on right now is totally system. Oh, shit. I thought this was fun. Is this Santiago? Sorry, I got sidetracked. None. What's going on right now is.
00:42:55.924 - 00:43:26.152, Speaker A: That's an awkward first picture to have on my Twitter when I popped that up. No, it's not Santiago, but we can cut all that out. Anyways, I think what's happening right now is, like, totally fine the way it is and will continue to happen without any external pressure on the system. What's happening now has been happening for a while. Obviously. There's been, like, there's a couple of exceptions, like, additional capital flowing into things like checks or, like, pudgies.
00:43:26.296 - 00:43:27.780, Speaker B: Do you think we're still PvP?
00:43:28.960 - 00:43:48.960, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. And I don't think. I think that's what needs to change for anything to take us anywhere. Like, it's not going to be. It's not going to be checks, that's for sure. It's not going to be any of the collections we have right now that play a significant role. And that I think, like, it's gonna be.
00:43:48.960 - 00:43:54.164, Speaker A: It's gonna be something that gets money. I don't know.
00:43:54.252 - 00:44:02.324, Speaker B: Don't you think? Like, Brant, like, I'm pretty sure Jack with checks thinks that he's bringing in new people or that's their.
00:44:02.372 - 00:44:04.940, Speaker A: He might be. There's a good chance he might go in this.
00:44:05.060 - 00:44:06.052, Speaker B: Do you think he has?
00:44:06.156 - 00:44:26.538, Speaker A: I honestly, I haven't been watching it as close as I should have. I think just given the volume he's done and just how prominent these have been, it's totally feasible. But that being said, like, it's also, it's hard to say. Like, we're still pretty in a bottle. No, no new person woke up today. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna go buy my first NFT.
00:44:26.538 - 00:44:27.650, Speaker A: Like, for what?
00:44:27.730 - 00:44:31.150, Speaker B: Unless agree with the fact that we need that. I'm gonna be honest.
00:44:31.610 - 00:44:32.346, Speaker A: Like, how.
00:44:32.378 - 00:44:48.960, Speaker B: Where is the bunch of people. But no, but, like, a bunch of people waking up one day and saying that they want to buy nfts did. I guess I. That did happen. And that's, quote unquote, why we're paying attention to nfts right now. But I think, okay, the trump people came. There was.
00:44:48.960 - 00:44:52.656, Speaker B: Yeah, but that 50% of the trump shit was, like, on credit cards.
00:44:52.808 - 00:44:59.936, Speaker A: But that's not, that's not flowing into the rest of the ecosystem. That's in a bottle. That's like, yeah, number one. That's on Polygon.
00:45:00.088 - 00:45:35.780, Speaker B: Yeah. Because the on ramp is the easiest on ramp possible, which is credit card. So if you make it as easy as possible and people still don't enter the ecosystem at all, like, then what? What's supposed to happen? Because I get it for Defi. Like, I get it for DeFi where it was AP wise, it was like, it was basically AP wise and it was people saying that Luna and USt was a savings account at 20% APY. I get that part. And I get being a regular person and I saw those regular people and I get the meme coins. I get those.
00:45:35.780 - 00:45:44.272, Speaker B: But there's only so many people that are gonna care about like pictures and.
00:45:44.296 - 00:45:52.816, Speaker A: Images and think, how is that not a stronger. How is that not as strong, if not stronger of a case than meme coins?
00:45:53.008 - 00:46:21.844, Speaker B: No, meme coins are like lottery tickets. I don't think nfts are. Yeah, the gains on nfts are better than defi and similar to meme coins, but I don't think people see them as well. I guess maybe because the barrier to entry is harder. You can jump on coinbase or crypto.com and buy a meme coin as soon as it lists. Way easier than buying, like a rocketing NFT project, I guess, anymore.
00:46:21.892 - 00:46:31.060, Speaker A: I don't think you can buy shit very easily on open sea with credit card. You just said that with the trump nfts. Yeah, but getting, I think if anything, it was harder with shit. Coins were limited.
00:46:31.100 - 00:46:38.588, Speaker B: An email. The Trump Nfts was an email. You put your card, you can website and got it on an email. You didn't have to go into Opensea.
00:46:38.764 - 00:46:48.860, Speaker A: But my point is you can still go on open sea and add funds with a credit card, whereas for meme coins, sure, you could do that on Coinbase, but with what? With dogecoin, with Shibae, with what else?
00:46:49.280 - 00:47:14.140, Speaker B: I just don't know what it is that makes people. I have people that, like, from this last run, I have people that want. As soon as they ask me, oh, what is this coin? And what is that coin? That's when I'm selling. I have that list of people ready to go, like, in my IRL, and I've heard those people talk about Luna. I've heard those people talk about meme coins. I have not heard those people talk about NfT teeth.
00:47:15.320 - 00:47:40.098, Speaker A: So maybe we don't want them to know yet. I don't know. Personally, I'm not talking about. I'm not worried about. I don't know. I'm not worried about what's gonna, what's gonna bring more people in or what's gonna take us to the promised land. Because I think the way things are going now, like, for as allegedly, like, devoid of opportunity as we should be, especially over the last couple months, everyone's like, oh, it's so fucking boring.
00:47:40.098 - 00:47:52.366, Speaker A: Everything sucks. There's no opportunity. This and that. There's, it's all there. Like, you just have to, you just have to look like people obviously aren't talking about it because once they start talking about it, it's time to sell. Like, it's. Once you start talking about, it's too late.
00:47:52.366 - 00:48:19.306, Speaker A: So I'm fine with this period being the way it is, and I don't know, the promised land being one thing, that's like a different game once we get there. I'll evaluate that because you can't play that the same way we've been playing the last three to four months, at least. You shouldn't play that the same way. Wouldn't play it nearly as careful as we have been. So it's a, it's. I don't know, it's like a moot point almost in my eyes. Like, I think, I don't know.
00:48:19.306 - 00:48:23.922, Speaker A: The promised land sounds great and all, but there's a lot of work to be done here still.
00:48:24.026 - 00:48:37.946, Speaker B: Like, the idea of an NFT run generating a bull market. I didn't see what that was last time. I didn't see what that looked like last time. I guess I did.
00:48:37.978 - 00:48:38.242, Speaker A: I.
00:48:38.306 - 00:49:20.370, Speaker B: It was apes, it was punks. It was. That's pretty much it. And then, like, a bunch of people launching projects, but I just don't see it for, for today, I don't see what it, I don't see what it would look like. What is everyone, what are we waiting for? I don't know what we're waiting for. And so I feel like it's making it a few times harder to recognize when it arrives if we don't know what we're looking for. Are we rate waiting for a fucking feeling? Or I guess the statistical trigger would be like volume on the, on chain basis.
00:49:20.370 - 00:49:39.818, Speaker B: But yeah, I guess that's pretty much it. But I don't see what causes that. Unless you want to be like a macro guy and be like, oh, when rates get cut again and people start having more money that they can borrow easily or whatever, that seems like you.
00:49:39.834 - 00:50:07.132, Speaker A: Could say it's once we start having actually like, usable products or, I don't know, talking about nfts in specific, like an efficient, like, NFT fi ecosystem could do wonders. Like, we did all this volume, we did all this pumping last bull market with little, essentially no leverage. You still essentially have no leverage. And now we're on the verge of having perps outperforming spot with volume.
00:50:07.276 - 00:50:12.040, Speaker B: Some people were saying that leverage is what's driving what we have now.
00:50:13.220 - 00:50:14.236, Speaker A: NfTs.
00:50:14.388 - 00:50:17.100, Speaker B: Yeah, you can borrow and lever up on nfts.
00:50:17.180 - 00:50:25.454, Speaker A: We had this talk. We had this talk last week. We looked at the volume of NFT buying other lending platforms and saw a fraction of the overall market.
00:50:25.622 - 00:50:37.490, Speaker B: Yeah, but I was on a new lending website, not NFT fi. It's like a black and white one. I think I sent it to you. I forget what it is. I don't think it's arcade. It might be arcade.
00:50:38.510 - 00:50:39.970, Speaker A: I don't think it's arcade.
00:50:41.950 - 00:51:08.798, Speaker B: Forget which one it is. Fuck. But like people, some, there's some levering up. I mean, if you go on the ladies right now, like, the volume is nothing, but the floor is up like three quarters of an ETH since last time and it's just steady climbing. And they're one of the only ones that aren't like real blue chips that are listed on NFT per malays a.
00:51:08.814 - 00:51:11.110, Speaker A: Lot of volume on NFT perp. Oh shit. Yeah.
00:51:11.190 - 00:51:18.050, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's like the first example of what you were saying that we're seeing, which I think is like.
00:51:18.880 - 00:51:43.472, Speaker A: You look at them right now and all those options suck. Like, they're not, they're not like, sure. Like, I think NFT perp has been a great insight into what things could look like how, like with milady specifically, you can see like, what that kind of volume can do to a collection. But it's. That's in a. That's one very specific example. And it's like, the effects of that aren't, like, extractable to the rest of the ecosystem.
00:51:43.472 - 00:51:46.316, Speaker A: Like, I think lending is still shit.
00:51:46.488 - 00:52:26.052, Speaker B: The question is mean. Like, people like me and you are the exact target consumer that someone like NFT perp would have. And the question is, why don't we use NfT perk every single day? And I think my answer to that question is I don't see any of the top whatever. I think they have five, six NFT projects on there. I don't see the top, like, five doing anything in terms of, like, significant movement and other than milady's. So I don't see the real need. And, yeah, that's, like, my solid reason.
00:52:26.052 - 00:52:27.236, Speaker B: Why don't you. Purpose.
00:52:27.268 - 00:52:30.520, Speaker A: What do we trade daily? How many, how many of the collections.
00:52:30.940 - 00:52:32.000, Speaker B: I mean, the question.
00:52:33.260 - 00:52:48.190, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, forget daily. How many of the collections that you've put any money into are listed on NFT perk. Zero. I'll answer that for you. The answer is zero. Then for me it's zero. That's the problem is, like, when something like checks comes over, let's say NFT per.
00:52:49.610 - 00:52:53.178, Speaker B: What if. What would you do if you had harvest on there? The only thing you would do?
00:52:53.194 - 00:52:57.386, Speaker A: I would short it. Yeah, yeah, but I would do it. That's the point is I would use.
00:52:57.418 - 00:53:05.450, Speaker B: It like, yeah, but the point of NFT purpose, to give people that don't have the option to get, don't have the liquidity to buy something that hive a tier.
00:53:05.530 - 00:53:47.690, Speaker A: But that's my. Everything still so nascent that everything's still so nascent that everywhere that opportunity exists is not applicable to most people. Azuki's board, apes, mutant apes, punks, everything here, with the exception of maybe maladies, all these people can already go and properly hedge against these assets through any lending platform. Like, these are all experiments that are starting out with the easiest, most obvious, most liquid collections. And sure, like, that's important. That's, like, the best way to go about it, but it's still so early. And even the solutions for these guys, like, suck to the point where the amount of volume and leverage that it's creating within the system is, like, negligible.
00:53:48.310 - 00:54:07.124, Speaker B: I don't think they suck. I think a lot of it is to blame. Like, a lot of the blame. It has to come with the way that these things are integrated. I feel like they're nothing smoothly integrated at all. Like, you're an open sea and you're out of Opensea, you're in blurred. Like, I could see blur.
00:54:07.124 - 00:54:17.532, Speaker B: Like if, like they're trying to be like a quick trading kind of thing. If they launch perps, people are gonna use the fucking perps within that. Within that app.
00:54:17.596 - 00:54:26.674, Speaker A: Yeah. X two I to x two I, two x. Whatever. The marketplace, they have a lending. They have a lending, like, lending and borrowing feature now, and it's like second or third biggest.
00:54:26.762 - 00:54:34.150, Speaker B: Yeah, but aren't they shut off from Opensea listing and stuff? Blur bypass the seaport thing, like last week?
00:54:34.450 - 00:54:49.154, Speaker A: Yeah, but the point being is that, like, the point being that this is all stuff that's, like, in the process of being worked on, but it's not there. Like, everything we're talking about that needs to happen is, like, being done. It's just not anywhere near there. Like, Dan, for example, do you want.
00:54:49.162 - 00:54:51.618, Speaker B: To name who's doing it? Because I don't.
00:54:51.674 - 00:55:02.682, Speaker A: I guess to what you just mentioned, like, talking about people building, like, entire suites of NFT trading experiences.
00:55:02.786 - 00:55:14.190, Speaker B: Yeah, but there's a. There's like a chinese wall barrier between. Around opensea that. That is causing these other applications not to be able to be used.
00:55:15.010 - 00:55:24.620, Speaker A: Yeah, but do you think that lasts? I think. I think either doesn't last or Odyssey has to pick up these features on their own eventually.
00:55:24.700 - 00:55:28.308, Speaker B: Yeah. As soon as Opensea picks up these features, everyone's dead. No.
00:55:28.404 - 00:55:35.480, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. If they do it the right way, totally. But that's. I don't think it's like, you don't. I think it's a long wall.
00:55:35.900 - 00:56:01.744, Speaker B: You don't see that same wall around, like, defi. If you like. There's more, like, integrations. Like. Like the meme was that everything was looped around everything and everyone was levered up around. Not specifically in Defi, like, levered up to the ship, but, like, everyone uses every protocol that gains an apy, basically uses, like, earn or yearn. So, like, there was no, like, wall in between these protocols, I feel.
00:56:01.744 - 00:56:05.968, Speaker B: And that wall, I feel, is the biggest problem with NFT fi.
00:56:06.024 - 00:56:22.408, Speaker A: The problem. It's a problem that. That hasn't existed, I think, in crypto before. Really, even now. Like, how. What percentage of arbitrum yield would you say comes from GLP? There's no way it's anything. Yeah, there's.
00:56:22.408 - 00:56:25.256, Speaker A: I would say there's no way it's anything less than 60%.
00:56:25.448 - 00:56:26.944, Speaker B: Yeah, I was gonna say 75.
00:56:26.992 - 00:56:32.888, Speaker A: Honestly, like, it's still happening. Like, people find one thing that works in Defi and they're like, all right, let's just.
00:56:33.064 - 00:56:35.184, Speaker B: Because there's no wall, there's no water.
00:56:35.272 - 00:57:01.552, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. It's, everything's composable. That's, and that's, I think that's to the advantage of Defi. But the problem is you don't have, you don't have unified liquidity or composability in the NFT space. You have Opensea, Coinbase, NFT. Once upon a time we had FTX NFts. It wasn't unified the way that it's supposed to be, quote unquote, in crypto.
00:57:01.696 - 00:57:06.940, Speaker B: Did you see, speaking of multi chain, did you see the whole uniswap and the a 16?
00:57:08.120 - 00:57:11.772, Speaker A: I didn't get to read the three. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of something else.
00:57:11.876 - 00:58:08.196, Speaker B: Oh, I need to practice, like speaking to audience. So if you guys didn't know, basically Uniswap had a proposal to go cross chain to binance, and they had to do it, they have to do it pretty quickly because they're some kind of, I want to say, copyright on their code basically evaporates in April, I want to say. And they lose first mover advantage completely. But if they don't move to binance, they're going to lose everything to some competitor that copies their uni v three code. And within that proposal, they have to pick. I didn't really see why they had to pick one multi chain messenger, but I guess they have to pick a main one. And so the competition was between wormhole, which is backed and basically created by jump, and then layer zero, which is completely backed by a 16 z.
00:58:08.196 - 00:58:49.498, Speaker B: And so there was like basically 80 pages worth of comments on the governance tab, which is like the most that's ever happened on uniswap governance. And yeah, people were arguing what exactly was to happen. And so I was curious what you think about that, the whole idea. I think the main takeaway, a lot of people had Washington, the scary thought that the VC's control Uniswap, the VC's control, especially with the whole, like, the whole like non VC canto movement that was happening. What are you doing as a fellow? I mean, people, these are, these are.
00:58:49.594 - 00:58:53.186, Speaker A: Miss VC's or VC's are misunderstood. I think they're.
00:58:53.258 - 00:58:54.230, Speaker B: You think so?
00:58:54.930 - 00:59:11.888, Speaker A: Okay. I don't think that they deserve more credit than they're given. I think that they are the on, obviously there's exceptions. And I don't like to discredit the good people in the space, because great people, there are lots of them. But I think people, like, they've just become a scapegoat. Like, people. It's so common.
00:59:11.888 - 00:59:31.154, Speaker A: It's so common to get mad at these for dumping. So I've checker unlocked calendars. Fucking axie infinity has whatever capital unlocking this month, and they dump every month. It's like, fuck. Like, why can't these guys stop selling? And then you have uniswap. Oh, they're not selling. They're actively participating in governance with their, with their what, their three.
00:59:31.154 - 00:59:38.298, Speaker A: Their 4% share. Yeah, but you gotta realize, what do you want them to do?
00:59:38.434 - 00:59:51.586, Speaker B: No, but the argument is they have a 16 z specifically has 4%, and 4% is the exact amount needed to veto any vote. So essentially they're, they're them in the Uniswap governance.
00:59:51.658 - 00:59:55.274, Speaker A: That's, that's not their fault. No, and that isn't their fault.
00:59:55.362 - 01:00:32.010, Speaker B: That isn't their fault. But the idea of a Dow and the idea of Dow governance is not that. Yeah, I completely understand the VC's and the idea that these organizations that people end up loving need to start somewhere with some kind of funding, and they wouldn't happen without these VC's. And we all love the VC's, but I'm saying, like, the, that show of, it's like a show of force almost, where it's like a 16 z is gonna get their way no matter what.
01:00:32.950 - 01:00:53.016, Speaker A: And I don't, I think that's a problem with the governance process more than anything else. That's like the same, like, being upset at that in my mind is no different. It vary. It's like the same as when people are talking. When people are talking about, oh, like, Luna blew up because it was a coordinated attack. Like, it's the same thing.
01:00:53.048 - 01:00:57.648, Speaker B: I was definitely, that was definitely Blackstone or Blackrock and Citadel. That.
01:00:57.704 - 01:00:58.968, Speaker A: But that's besides the point.
01:00:59.024 - 01:00:59.400, Speaker B: Okay.
01:00:59.440 - 01:01:30.908, Speaker A: If you can't, even if you're being serious, that's besides the point. If it can be done, you need to assume it will be done. Like, you can't just, you can't just, like, you can't just have your governance process be that way and be like, oh, we're just gonna, like, hopefully no one organization has 4% of the 4% of the tokens. Like, it's. If it can happen, you should assume it will happen, like, with anything in crypto, because that's just the way, like, someone's going to come along and do it. If it's exploitable, if there's some sort of gain to be had from that. Someone's going to come and do it.
01:01:31.084 - 01:01:38.844, Speaker B: And they might have. I feel like you're leaning towards the whole Avi, Iris and meme of if it's in the code, then it's going to happen or if it's possible.
01:01:38.932 - 01:01:39.300, Speaker A: Ok.
01:01:39.380 - 01:01:40.644, Speaker B: I mean, he ended up in jail.
01:01:40.732 - 01:01:43.966, Speaker A: That's where things get a little bit dodgy. But.
01:01:44.038 - 01:01:45.254, Speaker B: No, I see what you're saying.
01:01:45.382 - 01:01:48.894, Speaker A: What do you respond to that one? Regulation is a whole other thing.
01:01:49.062 - 01:02:20.976, Speaker B: What do you think? Where was I going with this? What do you think? We could think? The timer is really killing me, but would you rather. Do you want to go into how governance works? Because some people talk about representatives within a dow and. Yeah, but. Or we could also go into how, like, uniswap should handle that to begin with. Do you or not to be. Do you want it but to, like, do you can't step in if you're your uniswap. You have to let the vote go.
01:02:20.976 - 01:02:24.304, Speaker B: How the votes gonna go? But I don't know.
01:02:24.352 - 01:02:28.928, Speaker A: This is like a, there's, like, a lot to unpack here. Do you want to get into this today?
01:02:29.024 - 01:02:29.816, Speaker B: I think we can.
01:02:29.848 - 01:02:31.848, Speaker A: Unfair. Like, I don't think we can either.
01:02:31.904 - 01:03:27.480, Speaker B: And I don't know if it's gonna be relevant next week, but it might not. Let's. With the final three and a half minutes, let's just lead into Kanto. Just because I want to get this point into the air, because I basically saw people talking about Kanto and how, like, the guy from Hasan, I think his name is Haseebly Haseeb from Dragonfly, he was really shitting on Kanto, and I have zero money in Kanto. I wish I did. But he basically was saying, his argument was that these protocols or this chain, picking protocols and picking the winners and, like, socializing it makes it so that no innovation happens. And I feel like I disagree, mainly because they can just copy any good innovation that happens on Ethereum.
01:03:27.480 - 01:03:34.210, Speaker B: And I want to hear what your take is on that. If I'm, like, crazy for thinking that.
01:03:34.590 - 01:03:52.904, Speaker A: No, I don't know. I don't really. I don't really like the word. I guess it's totally accurate to call that copying, but just the fact that we're all. I say this, not being any type of a developer, mind you, I'm still going to use the word we. We're all kindness together and figuring this shit out as we go. Nothing really works.
01:03:52.904 - 01:04:21.740, Speaker A: So, like, why gatekeep? What? Like, why gatekeep? What kind of works in one ecosystem to avoid them? Potentially, I don't know. The whole point is to push the envelope in my mind. Right. And having that mindset, having that approach makes that a lot better for the common good. A lot better. But, like, not a lot of people, I don't think a lot of people favor the common good these days, especially.
01:04:22.560 - 01:04:30.260, Speaker B: What do you mean by the common good in terms of the innovation that happens and what that brings? In terms of common good? Or. Yeah, what do you mean by common good?
01:04:31.160 - 01:04:53.712, Speaker A: Yeah, that's essentially having these applications, having this code in different environments and different ecosystems with various different, like, tweaks on it to see, to see what sticks or just to try it out in different places and have different learnings from it. So I don't know, for example, this.
01:04:53.736 - 01:05:02.300, Speaker B: Is like a good thing to try. Kanto. It's like a, it was a, it's a good experiment. Do you think it has legs? Do you have a prediction in the.
01:05:02.640 - 01:05:27.586, Speaker A: Do I think it has legs? I don't know. I don't think there's. I think every experiment in the space has some good to it. But mind you, I also thought that Luna was like, the entire time Luna was going on, I was like, aware and convinced it was an experiment and it was one of the biggest ones we've seen in the space. But so obviously there's harm that can be done. But obviously, I mean, there's going to. Some good is going to come out of it in the end.
01:05:27.586 - 01:05:33.322, Speaker A: I don't know if it has legs. I don't know if I'd be entering anything like that. I do think it will be important in some way, shape or form. So.
01:05:33.346 - 01:05:35.770, Speaker B: Good. That's it for episode four. Have a good one.
