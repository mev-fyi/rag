00:00:00.320 - 00:00:06.850, Speaker A: Exit liquidity, where you find out how not to be fucking exit liquidity.
00:00:08.990 - 00:00:11.222, Speaker B: All right. Episode four.
00:00:11.286 - 00:00:12.050, Speaker A: We're back.
00:00:12.510 - 00:00:19.150, Speaker B: Exit liquidity. I'm definitely using the intro that you don't like on this. Just letting you know now. I spent.
00:00:19.190 - 00:00:20.370, Speaker A: Go for it. Yeah.
00:00:20.870 - 00:00:27.400, Speaker B: But it'll be a placeholder until we get something else because I actually do like that pixelated idea.
00:00:27.480 - 00:00:36.700, Speaker A: Yeah. Gonna take a bit more work to put together, but, yeah, I mean, as. At least as long as you have something, I think it's fine. Even if I'm not a huge fan.
00:00:37.200 - 00:00:51.644, Speaker B: Yeah. I miss this. I'm not gonna lie. I'm pretty excited. I feel like I came, like, this hiatus we had was nice, even though I really thought I was gonna record, like, in Dubai. What? I was like.
00:00:51.672 - 00:01:00.520, Speaker A: Like, yeah, no, I wouldn't expect you to, but. Not expect you to. It's been, what, like, two weeks now? Three weeks now? I think since our last one.
00:01:00.860 - 00:01:16.996, Speaker B: Two weeks. We missed two weeks. Yeah. I really wanted to hit, like, 52. Like, hit one every single year. I mean, every week. That would have been nice, but I guess we'll have to make up for it somehow, I guess.
00:01:17.188 - 00:01:23.610, Speaker A: I actually haven't even checked the YouTube channel since we got 1523 and 21 views.
00:01:24.070 - 00:01:25.730, Speaker B: Really? 21?
00:01:26.390 - 00:01:34.302, Speaker A: Yeah. 23 on the one. The. Actually, no. Well, they're the same one. I just rather. Two parts.
00:01:34.302 - 00:01:36.478, Speaker A: 23 and 21 on that. On those?
00:01:36.614 - 00:01:36.974, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:37.022 - 00:01:38.810, Speaker A: Probably because we titled it feet pics.
00:01:40.630 - 00:01:42.570, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, maybe.
00:01:42.910 - 00:01:45.718, Speaker A: Yeah. Toward advantage. Yeah.
00:01:45.774 - 00:01:52.430, Speaker B: Yeah. But how many subscribers we have? Like, one. I know one of my two.
00:01:53.450 - 00:01:55.990, Speaker A: I didn't even subscribe to us yet, honestly.
00:01:58.250 - 00:02:00.906, Speaker B: So there's a mystery for the second person.
00:02:01.098 - 00:02:03.546, Speaker A: Yeah, that's. That's cool. I like that.
00:02:03.658 - 00:02:32.580, Speaker B: That's pretty cool. All right, let's get into it. I think we just start with the fact that I spent that whole last week leading up to this bull market calling for a red week. I thought that was just amazing. I've been living with that message that I sent you and just staring at you, like, saying, well, everyone says that every single week. And I just been staring at that, like.
00:02:34.440 - 00:02:37.100, Speaker A: You'Re confident enough to call this a bull market already?
00:02:37.720 - 00:02:50.546, Speaker B: Oh, definitely not. Definitely not. I'm on the sidelines praying for this, praying for the downfall of everybody, honestly, so I can get a better price. But no, I don't have faith in this at all. Do you?
00:02:50.618 - 00:02:54.138, Speaker A: I don't know, man. Who nobody fucking knows.
00:02:54.194 - 00:03:00.190, Speaker B: Like, well, what's. What are you. Are you, like, macro guy scared or you just like.
00:03:01.810 - 00:03:22.148, Speaker A: No, it's just like, I don't know. I mean, I think. I don't. I don't think it's out of the question for us to, like, for us to go back down and retest. But I also, like, wouldn't be surprised if we just chop for a long time from here. Be good for NFts if that's the case. I don't know.
00:03:22.148 - 00:03:34.640, Speaker A: It's just like. It's just something I'm never right about. Like, why. Why bother trying to, like, time that, you know? Yeah, it never works out for me. It always does more harm than good, I think.
00:03:36.410 - 00:03:58.550, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. I mean, I did tell, like, I forget who I told. I think it was my dad. I was like, honestly, if we get an 800, $800 ethereum, like, I would bet the house on that. And I said that, and I had. I had no fucking liquidity to do that, but I do want a $100 ethic. Again, I don't care about anything else.
00:03:59.410 - 00:04:24.806, Speaker A: Would be nice. Would be nice. This guy I used to work for, it was like, he runs some, like, small, like, market research firm, like, not related to crypto. He has no shit about crypto, but him and my dad are still good friends. I worked for him for, like, a year back in, like, 2020, maybe. And he was talking to my dad, and he was, like, asking how I was doing, and my dad was telling him, oh, yeah, like, he works in crypto now. Like, he.
00:04:24.806 - 00:04:43.520, Speaker A: He was telling me to start averaging into ethereum. And just with that. This guy Randy, he ran with that, and he, like, apparently, like, dumped. Dumped some money in just, like, not even d. Saying just like a one time buy. And that was coincidentally at, like, like, 1050 each, I think. And now he's, like, very happy with.
00:04:43.520 - 00:04:53.860, Speaker A: With me for that. I haven't spoken to the guy in, like, a year and a half, maybe two years, but somehow it definitely inject into the fund. Yeah, yeah, maybe.
00:04:55.210 - 00:05:17.070, Speaker B: I was watching something actually about some, like, these Kanto guys, these guys that were showing Kanto on some podcast, and they started off as, like, a friends and family fun. I had never. I've heard of family office, but they called it not a friends and family fund, but a friends and family management firm or something like that.
00:05:17.650 - 00:05:22.340, Speaker A: Whatever. Like, they. You're saying that very vague.
00:05:22.460 - 00:05:27.428, Speaker B: It seemed like they were just, like, taking people's money and trading with it more.
00:05:27.484 - 00:05:31.560, Speaker A: Did they say friends and family round? They raised their friends and family round?
00:05:32.380 - 00:05:37.508, Speaker B: No. No use of the word round. Just friends and family. Okay.
00:05:37.564 - 00:06:02.690, Speaker A: The only thing I can think of is like, generally. Generally, like, at your earliest stage, the only funding you can get is from, like, friends and family. So, like, people will. People will raise that quote, unquote, and call it a friends and family round, and then they'll do, like, pre seed seed shit like that after, if they get to that point. But management fund firm, whatever. I haven't heard of anything like that.
00:06:05.070 - 00:06:13.126, Speaker B: Speaking of management, step into actually the Trump nft trade. Did you, did you get filled?
00:06:13.158 - 00:06:15.470, Speaker A: Dude? No, dude. It's like.
00:06:18.490 - 00:06:24.070, Speaker B: I didn't want to burst your bubble, but I was like, dude, just list that too. But I know you really wanted three.
00:06:25.090 - 00:06:50.660, Speaker A: Well, the thing is, is I just listed today, and not. Not a single one has sold since. Since I listed the prop. The liquidity is just so bad. So, like, if, like I said, like, if I wanted to liquidate right now, could liquidate for, like, .3 which is, like, less than half of what I paid. But, like, if I had listed when this guy came and swept, I would have gotten filled at that three.
00:06:50.660 - 00:07:01.240, Speaker A: Or, like, someone. What the fuck? Someone literally just now, a minute ago, someone bought a golf game with, with Trump at Mar a Lago for guess how much?
00:07:02.700 - 00:07:04.932, Speaker B: I think I saw a Twitter post on, like, it was.
00:07:04.956 - 00:07:09.414, Speaker A: It was literally a minute ago. Oh, and there's only one of those. Yeah, it's the first sale.
00:07:09.502 - 00:07:11.606, Speaker B: 30 they were.
00:07:11.638 - 00:07:20.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they were listed for 30. This one was. This one was sold for 14. Eth is the first sale. Oh, like, and there's only one of them.
00:07:20.830 - 00:07:24.238, Speaker B: Private one on one. It's. And you bring a group of friends.
00:07:24.294 - 00:07:34.190, Speaker A: To this NFT team for two hour golf game with President Trump for winner and two guests at a date and time to be determined by the company. Yeah. Someone has an offer for three and a half years.
00:07:34.230 - 00:07:40.820, Speaker B: Someone on Twitter was like, oh, like, if you're a fucking youtuber and you want, like, a fucking great video.
00:07:42.640 - 00:07:44.220, Speaker A: That's true. Yeah.
00:07:44.520 - 00:07:52.200, Speaker B: Or if you're like, even like, whatever, Mister Beast or whoever, like, 50 bands easily to.
00:07:52.320 - 00:07:52.712, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:52.776 - 00:07:55.580, Speaker B: Do a one on one with trump golfing.
00:07:56.200 - 00:07:56.704, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:07:56.752 - 00:08:01.780, Speaker B: Seems viable. It's just whether or not they want to make a metamask and buy a bunch of ease.
00:08:02.650 - 00:08:07.738, Speaker A: I mean, you can, you can buy with, with credit card on Opensea. I don't even think you need to go that far.
00:08:07.914 - 00:08:12.114, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that's true. You can buy straight on credit card with Opensea.
00:08:12.282 - 00:08:31.210, Speaker A: Yeah. But, yeah, no, I don't know. I. I kind of just have to hope some, some, like, tard comes in and sweeps again because the like, there's not many sales on this thing regularly at all. It was. It was just, like, stupidly illiquid for, like, a week. Nothing was moving.
00:08:31.210 - 00:08:48.690, Speaker A: And then, like, two or three people came in and swept. And there's not. There's only 125 of them. Yeah, that's what I think, too. I mean, if you look at the. If you look at, like, the volume chart for the entire collection volume. This past week has been.
00:08:48.690 - 00:08:56.632, Speaker A: Has been, like five times higher than any other week just because people have started sweeping, like, the higher rarities or the more, I guess.
00:08:56.696 - 00:09:00.488, Speaker B: Imagine if you want, imagine when the announcement comes true.
00:09:00.664 - 00:09:01.136, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:01.208 - 00:09:06.180, Speaker B: He takes, like, whatever the fuck it is. He wins the primary for the republicans.
00:09:06.480 - 00:09:21.952, Speaker A: That's the problem is I only bought one of them. Like, I would totally, totally hold and see and see what happens here because it's like. Like, it's stupid to say, but, like, it's. It's backed. Like. Like, you actually get to go to dinner with Trump. That has, like, some intrinsic value.
00:09:21.952 - 00:09:23.452, Speaker A: It has utility. Yeah.
00:09:23.576 - 00:09:24.640, Speaker B: Has utility.
00:09:25.300 - 00:09:32.588, Speaker A: So, like, I like it. I don't know. This is. This is one of the more. This is one of the more fundamentally sounds nfts I've owned in my life.
00:09:32.644 - 00:09:45.884, Speaker B: Surprisingly, honestly, probably the most fundamentally sound. Honestly, like, think about it. Abstractions were going for. For more than what you paid for that.
00:09:45.932 - 00:09:57.590, Speaker A: Dude. What. What even. Have you. Have you. Have you been keeping up with them still? No, I'm just looking at their twitter right now. They haven't tweeted out.
00:09:57.590 - 00:09:59.390, Speaker A: They've been pretty sparing.
00:10:00.250 - 00:10:04.954, Speaker B: They just been, like. Like, fucking, like, getting hacked constantly on every drop.
00:10:05.082 - 00:10:08.070, Speaker A: Again, I heard about the first one.
00:10:09.850 - 00:10:16.630, Speaker B: Yeah, they just been getting fucked over. Wait, I checked my open sea. Wat did I get filled for this?
00:10:18.140 - 00:10:19.140, Speaker A: Do you still have one?
00:10:19.180 - 00:10:23.380, Speaker B: I'm done. I have the v two. Shit.
00:10:23.540 - 00:10:27.320, Speaker A: Oh. Oh, yeah. I completely exited a while ago.
00:10:27.940 - 00:10:29.360, Speaker B: My wallet's not connected.
00:10:30.020 - 00:10:43.000, Speaker A: Wow. The main, the, like, original, like, abstraction piece is at 1.2. Now it's, like, down 50%. From where? From where we entered and.
00:10:44.730 - 00:10:46.938, Speaker B: Wait, what? Wait, what is it?
00:10:46.954 - 00:10:48.754, Speaker A: I'm sorry. Point one two. Point one two.
00:10:48.802 - 00:10:51.018, Speaker B: Oh, point one two. I thought you said 1.2.
00:10:51.074 - 00:10:56.522, Speaker A: No. Yeah, I did say 1.2. That was my bad. No, no. Yeah, that was at 1.2. I might consider entering again.
00:10:56.586 - 00:11:02.322, Speaker B: Like, what else? Cappy's, dude, cappies are fucked.
00:11:02.346 - 00:11:07.090, Speaker A: I'm sorry. Nothing's happening. No, it's like, what's the point? Like, there's.
00:11:07.170 - 00:11:10.630, Speaker B: There. I mean, they dropped some, like, open edition shit.
00:11:11.410 - 00:11:24.550, Speaker A: I'm stopped paying attention there. That's just another one of my. I've begun, like, amassing a collection of just, like, illiquid bullshit that's just gonna sit in my wallet forever. Or until, like, next December rolls around and I have to do some harvesting.
00:11:24.850 - 00:11:26.630, Speaker B: Yeah, you could sell for laws.
00:11:28.130 - 00:11:30.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I could work.
00:11:30.882 - 00:11:44.476, Speaker B: They're doing something. I'm like, I'm saying it here on this podcast now. Cappy's is going somewhere. I'm not in the discord. I don't know what the fuck is gonna happen, but that one's solely a gut feeling.
00:11:44.628 - 00:11:46.164, Speaker A: I mean, where's your time?
00:11:46.332 - 00:11:57.760, Speaker B: Next time on the podcast, if, like I say, I have a gut feeling, we reevaluate Cappy's, and then that's kind of, like, the mark of, like, whether or not my gut feelings work at all.
00:11:58.180 - 00:12:03.596, Speaker A: Okay, where's your entry? Because they're not. They're not doing too well from when we were first talking about.
00:12:03.628 - 00:12:08.540, Speaker B: My entry is way high. I don't even want to look at it. Entry is way too high.
00:12:08.660 - 00:12:19.868, Speaker A: I have a pretty rare one, actually. This one's a top 5%. That's fun. Yeah, no, I don't. I don't have very high hopes for these. One of them's got the. The noun glasses, which is kind of.
00:12:19.884 - 00:12:21.600, Speaker B: Cool, but volume, though.
00:12:23.700 - 00:12:25.012, Speaker A: I don't really care.
00:12:25.196 - 00:12:31.964, Speaker B: 80 over seven days. Yeah, it's pretty shit. Nah, they'll be back, though.
00:12:32.052 - 00:12:32.500, Speaker A: Not great.
00:12:32.540 - 00:12:33.360, Speaker B: They'll be back.
00:12:34.330 - 00:12:46.722, Speaker A: I guess they haven't been around long. I don't know. I've stopped paying attention. Honestly. I'm hoping to get filled on this. On this Jennart thing I sent you. Bala gun.
00:12:46.722 - 00:13:00.470, Speaker A: Bala gone. I haven't gotten filled yet. Oh, wait. Did I just get filled? Maybe I just got filled. I have the top offer now. I didn't a second ago, but I have not gotten filled yet, it looks like.
00:13:02.550 - 00:13:25.010, Speaker B: I'm not gonna lie to you. I like the owner distribution, but I was looking at it. It seems like it's like a. It was like, air dropped or, like, everyone. People got a lot listed for holding something else, and. Yeah, thing is like a. Some kind of dow or something.
00:13:25.310 - 00:13:43.620, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty. I mean, it's reasonably big. It seems like they have some. Some hot and they don't have a ton of followers, but the followers they do have seem to be high quality and mid price was, .25 so it's not like it's up absurdly from. From what? Like the. The white listers minted at.
00:13:46.080 - 00:13:56.416, Speaker B: Yeah, I just think there's a big ass wall for you to get anywhere, though. Yeah, like, I don't imagine.
00:13:56.528 - 00:14:06.670, Speaker A: I mean, like, with most gen art shit, I don't imagine this is something that pumps in, like, the coming week. Like, to me, this is, like, a slow grind up kind of thing.
00:14:07.090 - 00:14:07.786, Speaker B: Like.
00:14:07.938 - 00:14:09.826, Speaker A: Or nothing. Like art blocks.
00:14:09.858 - 00:14:20.178, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Did art blocks drop something else? Art blocks is always dropping notification. Like, on pro ment shit.
00:14:20.314 - 00:14:42.360, Speaker A: Art blocks is always dropping shit. And every time I see it, I go and I look at what they're auctioning at, and then I just get upset because I'm poor. Like, they're auctioning something. Or they have an auction coming up. Not an auction, but they have a sale coming up for a collection of 50. This gen art piece starting price is ten eth. And it's like.
00:14:42.360 - 00:14:44.040, Speaker A: I don't know, man.
00:14:45.060 - 00:14:46.948, Speaker B: They're doing a great job, though.
00:14:47.124 - 00:14:48.284, Speaker A: They really are. Yeah.
00:14:48.372 - 00:14:53.772, Speaker B: Did you see that one guy got fucking wrecked on Twitter? Got, like, 2 million of his shit liquidated?
00:14:53.836 - 00:14:56.490, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:56.870 - 00:14:59.310, Speaker B: Like, of those squiggles. Yeah.
00:14:59.350 - 00:15:07.850, Speaker A: Fucking, I mean, makes me feel pretty shitty about. I mean, I don't have much, but, like, if that guy gets fucked, like, how. How are any of us safe?
00:15:08.310 - 00:15:18.518, Speaker B: Yeah, I was gonna. When I saw that, I was gonna send you that. But you already sent it in meeting Rainbow, that, like, fire thing. That's sick.
00:15:18.614 - 00:15:28.060, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I haven't used that yet. I just said it. Sent it, but I haven't had a chance to fully look into it yet.
00:15:29.360 - 00:15:31.340, Speaker B: How are you feeling about spice?
00:15:33.280 - 00:15:34.180, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:15:34.880 - 00:15:39.616, Speaker B: Do you want to skip passes, get past one? No, no.
00:15:39.648 - 00:15:47.416, Speaker A: We can talk about it. We can talk about it. Yeah, yeah. I feel good. I have some questions that I still haven't gotten to ask Don about yet.
00:15:47.448 - 00:15:57.348, Speaker B: I've been actually dming them whenever they tweet, and I'm, like, having an instant question, and they respond saying, fast. So if you want to shoot me some. Like, I feel like I've asked everything.
00:15:57.484 - 00:16:06.760, Speaker A: I mean, have you may. Have you asked about the. The, like, possibility of a bank run? Like, what happens in that scenario, how they manage?
00:16:07.340 - 00:16:12.476, Speaker B: I didn't want to. Like, I didn't want to press them that hard. I thought you meant, like, that's a.
00:16:12.508 - 00:16:13.960, Speaker A: Valid question, I think.
00:16:14.700 - 00:16:35.880, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it definitely is a valid question, but, like, you know, I'm just a average priority whitelist. I want to be on the nice side for now. I don't know. I don't want to press them too hard because I think they're like. I do like how connected they are. Did you see? They're very connected with Jones.
00:16:36.740 - 00:16:45.528, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, they have been from the start. They're, they're. They're head of. Head of strategy, head of BD, whatever. They're all. The only member of their team who's nothing.
00:16:45.528 - 00:16:53.720, Speaker A: Founder. He was like formerly head of growth or something like that at Jones Dow, so. And they've been, they've been in talks pretty much since like day one.
00:16:54.220 - 00:16:55.036, Speaker B: I like.
00:16:55.188 - 00:16:56.356, Speaker A: They're definitely close there.
00:16:56.388 - 00:17:13.970, Speaker B: Yeah. They're just doing the same thing. Yeah. And they know that they're allowing people to spin up their own vaults. Like, eventually, like the prologue mint for this NFT is gonna be just the main vault and then they're gonna. Yeah. Like a bunch of different vaults.
00:17:13.970 - 00:17:18.742, Speaker B: That's hectic. If anyone spins them up. Pretty cool.
00:17:18.846 - 00:17:56.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, and I mean, in my mind, like, I. In my mind, I don't think many people would be spinning up their own vaults because, like, I mean, I totally would. I think people like us totally would. But for what the offering is right now, for their, like, for the prologue vault, for their like, flagship strategy, like, it's already reasonably well tested for something that's not live yet. And, you know, you're getting some of the best. You're getting some of the best yield you're going to see anywhere in Defi. So it's kind of, it's kind of a hard value prop to say, hey, go in and like, make your own shit and beat this.
00:17:56.226 - 00:18:00.642, Speaker B: I'm totally going to try, like the degeneracy curve. I feel like.
00:18:00.746 - 00:18:27.630, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. It's just going to be. You can, I'm sure you can, like, select more collections, give higher ltvs, change, change your rates, change your loan periods, whatever, and then go from there. But then, like, they, they still have to work out like, how to handle defaults in that scenario. Because the way they do it now, like, I don't think they hit very many default. Like, one, one person has defaulted on a punk and in all of NFT five lending history.
00:18:27.630 - 00:18:34.212, Speaker A: So, like, it's not that big of a, it's not that big of like a risk factor for them.
00:18:34.276 - 00:18:35.360, Speaker B: Automatic, though.
00:18:36.180 - 00:18:37.604, Speaker A: It depends on the, it depends on.
00:18:37.612 - 00:18:43.920, Speaker B: The platform or you think the best way to handle a default is just automatic.
00:18:45.980 - 00:18:51.332, Speaker A: So what, they custody the asset, they liquidate it and then return that to the deposits?
00:18:51.436 - 00:18:56.360, Speaker B: Or what, like when you say default, someone's.
00:18:57.390 - 00:20:03.176, Speaker A: That means someone, someone didn't pay back their loan in the period that they were supposed to, the borrower, the person who, if I have a punk and you lend me 50 eth for 30 days at x percent AP, and I don't, I don't pay back that 50 plus interest in 30 days, you, the smart contract allows you to then take custody of that, of that punk and it's yours now. So for something automated, what do they do? They just liquidate it right away and then give that back to, back to users? I think that's what they do now because defaults are few and far in between for the collections that they're probably farming for. And, and because it's generally profitable with blue chips like that, like defaults, there's, there's massive opportunity and just catching defaults here and there. But if you're deploying your own strategy, if you're, if I don't know, if you're lending against a bunch more collections, where people default more often, where it's more difficult to price and liquidate with higher rarities, it's not that, like, straightforward. So, yeah, that's a challenge in my mind.
00:20:03.248 - 00:21:02.564, Speaker B: I think JPEG, they have, they have it set up where there's like some kind of voting system on what happens with the defaulted nfTs. So, like they can vote whether to liquidate them or whether to keep them in a vault. And like, maybe they appreciate value for the people that contributed to the pool. I feel like that mechanism makes a decent amount of sense, especially with blue chips. Like, you don't want to automatically liquidate it at floor if you have something with rarity. But, yeah, I think, I think like an on chain voting mechanism because, I mean, they're gonna launch some kind of spice token, I'm assuming, maybe whether or not that's confirmed or denied, I feel like that's most likely gonna happen.
00:21:02.612 - 00:21:14.980, Speaker A: Talk about that. Can talk about that off podcast. Yeah, JPEG, it looks like JPEG, the Dow handles liquidations and usually what happens is the, the borrower has like 72 hours to repay their loan.
00:21:15.100 - 00:21:15.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:15.460 - 00:21:25.076, Speaker A: Plus a liquidation fee. If not, it goes up for auction. And I'm guessing the proceeds from that auction get paid out to. Get paid out to lender.
00:21:25.148 - 00:21:33.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I don't really keep the amount being given to the borrower less than or equal to floor price.
00:21:33.390 - 00:21:34.614, Speaker A: NFts are weird, man.
00:21:34.702 - 00:21:50.302, Speaker B: Why don't they make this? I feel like this may be a dumb question, but like, why doesn't the LTV change with the floor price? Why don't you have to put up more collateral when the floor price changes. Why is that a bad idea?
00:21:50.406 - 00:22:23.402, Speaker A: It's like a terrible user experience, I feel like, isn't it? You have to constantly be adding and subtracting liquidity from your position. I mean, you can renegotiate on some sites, but that's like. Because both parties have to agree to it. So, like, I don't know, it's like, imagine. Imagine I lend you one ETH for some nfT at like 50% LTV and the price two X's. So what do I do? I put in another ETh. What if I don't have another ETH? Like, where is that coming from? What if I.
00:22:23.402 - 00:22:27.670, Speaker A: What if I don't have one and I can't put it in? Who's, like, faulted there for that?
00:22:27.710 - 00:22:41.130, Speaker B: No, I think. I think with. I think with nFTs that you. You kind of have to understand that the. Yeah, I guess it does go both ways. I was thinking of it more as, like, only from the NFT side.
00:22:43.190 - 00:22:43.878, Speaker A: What do you mean?
00:22:43.934 - 00:22:50.678, Speaker B: You're saying, like. Are you saying if the value of the NFT doubles or if the value of Eth doubles?
00:22:50.734 - 00:23:19.344, Speaker A: I was talking about the value of the NFT in relation to Ethan. Like, if that is worth one eth one week, it's worth to the next. You can't guarantee that whichever party has to put in or take away liquidity. You can't guarantee that they're going to do that, that they're going to have the funds to do that in the first place. Because you can only. You can only for a position like that, for a trade like that, you can only. You can only manage what's being held in the smart contract.
00:23:19.344 - 00:23:34.942, Speaker A: And what's in the smart contract. It's just, you just get like an ERc. An ERC 1155 that represents like the. At least in the case of NFT five, that represents the position of. Of the borrow or of the land.
00:23:35.046 - 00:23:46.730, Speaker B: But I feel like would like people that are borrowing against their nfts will accept the fact that they have to do more work because of their asset class. I feel like you could.
00:23:47.230 - 00:23:48.206, Speaker A: That's asking a lot.
00:23:48.238 - 00:24:11.226, Speaker B: I feel like you think so? Especially. Yeah, cuz smaller shit. Like, I'm not talking blue chip, I'm talking like, the riskier things. Like, you think people would be that mad if they had to, like, actively manage and, you know, maybe add a little bit more ease to cover their floor price law?
00:24:11.298 - 00:24:19.140, Speaker A: I mean, I think it would be case by case. And you can only do it in situations where both parties would agree to it.
00:24:19.330 - 00:24:24.400, Speaker B: I think. I think they should test it out. I think they should see how many people agree to that.
00:24:24.560 - 00:25:11.586, Speaker A: I mean, I guess you can do it on NFT fi. You can renegotiate, you can propose a greater deposit, less deposit, you can pay back some earlier, change the rate, whatever, but both parties have to agree to it in every case. And it's just like, I don't know, like, why do people, why do people borrow against their NFTs in the first place? It's usually just to avoid selling them so they can, they can hedge in some way or. I don't know if you have. I've always thought about, like, if I had, like, if I had like a punk or like a rare squiggle or something, I would totally be barred against it and just like, trading with that money. Because squiggles, squiggles are super squiggles. Like fidenzas and autoglyphs.
00:25:11.586 - 00:25:42.966, Speaker A: They get really, really good rates for borrowing. Like, you can, you can borrow against it at like less than 15% and, like, I can probably beat that. Like, flipping and trading. So I would totally be doing that. But in either scenario, like, active position management, like, that doesn't really make too much of a difference for the borrower, I think. And if you're talking about the shittier, like, the more unstable collections, like, I couldn't tell you why the fuck those people are borrowing against them. Like, because you're already borrowing against it at like 80% APR or something like that.
00:25:42.966 - 00:25:52.450, Speaker A: Like, there's, it's really just when they need fast liquidity. I can't think of another scenario when they fast liquidity or when they, they want to, they want to hedge really.
00:25:52.750 - 00:25:56.574, Speaker B: Like a milady or like a goblin. Like those.
00:25:56.662 - 00:25:57.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:00.870 - 00:26:29.478, Speaker B: But I feel like those degenerative people would be fine with seeing a floor price go down and getting an email saying like, oh, well, your LTV has gone down a bunch. It's like, I feel like it's just like kind of like margin trading almost, where you get that email and you're like, fuck, I made the wrong move. I gotta, I gotta add more money or my position is gonna get liquidated. It's like simple as that kind of thing.
00:26:29.534 - 00:26:39.056, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I don't know. And if we're talking about just like peer to peer, which is like, really all I give a shit about, honestly.
00:26:39.128 - 00:26:39.664, Speaker B: Why is that?
00:26:39.712 - 00:27:09.468, Speaker A: Peer to pool is not quite as fun. There's not as much, like, opportunity there for me, at least, so I don't really pay too much attention to it. And I don't know, it doesn't really feel like peer to pool is moving that much. Like, it doesn't feel like there's that much innovating or happening there. All, like, the cool projects are building around peer to peer. But anyways, in like, a margin trading scenario, even like, a basic, like, fungible token lending scenario, when your LTV hits a certain point, you just get liquidated. Like, that's just how it works in this scenario.
00:27:09.468 - 00:27:51.200, Speaker A: In this scenario, let's say. Let's say you drop below LTV, the loan, the position is still going to be there. And that in that situation, it's actually probably preferable to be liquidated because the ETH that you're retaining from what you borrowed is going to be worth more than FT at that point, probably. So unless you're, like, attached to it or something like that, it doesn't really make sense to pay that back. It's a different game, honestly. It's like, that's why it's so, like, shitty in the state that it's in right now, because there's so many different nuances and just, like, problems, which is like, the fundamental. The fundamental nature of the assets that, like, it's not.
00:27:51.200 - 00:28:03.552, Speaker A: It can't be managed the same as a margin position or a position. A position on AAve or something like that. Yeah. I don't know, but there's cool shit going on there. Like, it's gonna. It's gonna get there. I think.
00:28:03.552 - 00:28:44.204, Speaker A: I mean, spice is a big, big step in the right direction. I think the problem is, is problem for me at least, is depending on how much liquidity they get from this first collection, rates are probably gonna be affected on some of these collections. Just because there'll be a lot more liquidity, people will be able to take out loans, which is healthier for the long term of the industry. But for me, it means it's going to be harder to get these 50, 60 plus percent aprs. I have a loan expiring tomorrow against this wrecked guy, which I definitely gave him too much, but I'm still. I'm at, like, 80% LTV right now, which is bad. I mean, even if he doesn't repay, I'll take it.
00:28:44.204 - 00:28:46.800, Speaker A: I'll just take it and sell it immediately. Get a quick.
00:28:47.730 - 00:28:50.710, Speaker B: How's the. Did you sell that Valhalla?
00:28:51.530 - 00:29:20.792, Speaker A: No, no, I'm just gonna hold it for a little bit. What I figured out happened is essentially, this guy just bought. It's pretty rare. This one trait, it had, the background trait, he's had is pretty fucking rare. But I figured out that this guy essentially just bought this thing way at the top, like right at the top. And I lend it against him not long after that. And I mean, I could.
00:29:20.792 - 00:29:30.448, Speaker A: There's. Well, I mean, I'm not. I'm not in a terrible position. I would say. It definitely wasn't. Like, it could be. It could be a lot worse.
00:29:30.448 - 00:29:49.930, Speaker A: But the top trait for this, the top. The top trait floor price is 1.23 for this thing. So I could take a 0.25 loss if I wanted to, if I just want to liquidate right now. But the halos are also like. I feel like they're kind of bottomed at this point or bottoming.
00:29:49.930 - 00:29:55.070, Speaker A: Like, I would expect them to turn around pretty soon. You might be biased, but how much.
00:29:55.110 - 00:29:57.250, Speaker B: Borrow volume do you think happened today?
00:29:58.110 - 00:30:00.090, Speaker A: It's a good question. Dollars?
00:30:00.510 - 00:30:01.198, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:01.334 - 00:30:08.290, Speaker A: Does that mean, like, how many positions were open today or, like. Like, what's already live.
00:30:10.230 - 00:30:12.050, Speaker B: Total borrows volume.
00:30:12.870 - 00:30:21.566, Speaker A: Okay, so it's probably. It's probably cumulative. Cumulatively. What's. What's currently, like an active position. Right.
00:30:21.678 - 00:30:22.650, Speaker B: You think so?
00:30:23.830 - 00:30:24.254, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:30:24.302 - 00:30:30.526, Speaker B: I'm looking at the number and I want to say that it's open today. Just because it's.
00:30:30.678 - 00:30:42.254, Speaker A: If it's open today, then I would say. I want to say like two between two and it's not too high. I have no idea. My initial. My initial.
00:30:42.342 - 00:30:44.566, Speaker B: I don't know what my answer would be, this question, but I'm surprised.
00:30:44.598 - 00:30:46.690, Speaker A: I was gonna say two to 300 ease.
00:30:47.990 - 00:30:49.814, Speaker B: Oh, in dollars? In dollars?
00:30:49.942 - 00:30:53.214, Speaker A: Oh, in dollars. I will convert that to you. Whatever the hell that is. I don't know.
00:30:53.382 - 00:30:58.008, Speaker B: It's one hundred k. One hundred and fifteen k. Okay.
00:30:58.024 - 00:30:58.980, Speaker A: That's pretty low.
00:30:59.360 - 00:30:59.744, Speaker B: So.
00:30:59.792 - 00:31:01.664, Speaker A: Yeah, so daily volume, what is it?
00:31:01.752 - 00:31:03.460, Speaker B: It's like a hundred eth. Really?
00:31:04.360 - 00:31:05.104, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:05.232 - 00:31:09.424, Speaker B: Any terms? It's pretty shit.
00:31:09.472 - 00:31:55.398, Speaker A: That's not. I mean, yeah, it's a fucking nascent industry. I mean, I would not expect that to change for some time. It's gonna be interesting. Like, obviously had like, a little mini, like, NFT run, arguably still going on, but, like, when you look at, like what? Like what nfts were doing in the bull market, just like everything mooning ridiculously too. I wonder how that's going to be when you can, like, when you can essentially, like, lever up against your nfts, when you can borrow against them, you can trade options like perps against them. Like, when you can essentially have that much more liquidity just with insane amounts of leverage.
00:31:55.398 - 00:31:57.570, Speaker A: Any amount of leverage with assets like that.
00:31:58.270 - 00:32:16.010, Speaker B: Do you buy into the. This was the ICO, like all coin thing. Like nfts are just all coins. Do you think we're like actually sitting in that same boat where like, that whole thing is getting flushed out?
00:32:17.960 - 00:32:19.660, Speaker A: Comparing icos to what?
00:32:20.120 - 00:32:48.456, Speaker B: Not ICO specifically, but like all coins, like, from how I cos, went to like, a thing where you can borrow against other. All coins you can lend against them, you can do a bunch of stuff like that was a nascent thing that didn't really have that much liquidity, and then all of a sudden it did. The thesis that people have with NFT sort of where, like you said, it's gonna cause some kind of extra bull run and compare it.
00:32:48.528 - 00:32:48.896, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:48.968 - 00:33:10.094, Speaker B: Into what? Like, icos were last year's just NFT market, just them blowing up and everyone launching an NFT. And like, now the financials behind all of them are gonna get flushed out just like all coin financials got flushed up. You buy? I honestly do in a way, yeah.
00:33:10.222 - 00:33:20.270, Speaker A: But I think with nfts, there's like, there's an assumption that, like, there is additional utility there, or at least there is additional utility coming for nfts.
00:33:20.310 - 00:33:45.610, Speaker B: Like, but I feel like that's the thing that I was telling you about that Tyche was talking about where like, those, those all coins blew up because nobody knew how to value them. It was all like, it was like a speculative bubble. And so that aspect of NFTs just adds on to the speculative bubble that could come with, like, nft five.
00:33:47.310 - 00:34:52.970, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I would agree with that. I would agree with that. But I don't know that it's going to end up the same way that it has with all coins. I think. I think, like, NFTs as an asset class are really going to entertain a enter a time where they kind of have to prove that they're worth all the hype or even a fraction of the hype that we've seen around them within the next couple years. Like, I don't know, once you can going back to like, NFT five, once you can like, reliably finance an NFT in a variety of ways, or it just has more flexibility as an asset once we reach that point, or once as that starts to improve, if other. If other, like, use cases don't follow, if, like, gaming doesn't take off, gaming assets don't take off, if, I don't know, social nfts, whatever other use cases you can come up with for FTC, if they don't start to solidify post that, then, yeah, we might end up just.
00:34:52.970 - 00:35:20.370, Speaker A: We might end up where we are. Exactly. Right now with altcoins, but with NFTs a couple years later, which it's not an ideal scenario, but it's not like endgame to me. I don't know. People always, people always talk about how we're early. Like, if you're seeing this, you're early, or you see some dumps in the news, like, oh, we're still early. It's like, yeah, from an adoption use case tech perspective.
00:35:20.370 - 00:35:26.960, Speaker A: Definitely still early in terms of, like, an upside perspective for some of this stuff. Like, it's.
00:35:27.500 - 00:35:28.400, Speaker B: It's.
00:35:29.260 - 00:35:49.196, Speaker A: It's a more difficult sell, I think, just because there's, like, so much has happened, like, built an empire. It's built there. Not we, but there have been empires built and collapsed in this. In this market for the past. For the past, like decade.
00:35:49.268 - 00:36:33.006, Speaker B: Like, eventually, right? Eventually. So you go back, icos have in, like, 2017. Right? And then we got to 2021. And you had FTX where you could deposit any and every altcoin into your account and borrow against all of them to trade. Do you. So 2021 is. Was the NFT comparable ICO, do you see in, like, I guess that's five years, four years? Do you see depositing a bunch of your, like, piece of shit nfts into some, like, trading account and then borrowing.
00:36:33.006 - 00:36:35.890, Speaker B: It's all of them as a whole at every single floor price?
00:36:36.230 - 00:36:41.680, Speaker A: Well, can you do that with. Can you do that with altcoins now? With most coins now?
00:36:42.740 - 00:37:06.954, Speaker B: Well, you can hypothetically, like, someone's gonna rebuild FTX and what they had it. There's like, a market fit for that, whether it's the GTX guys and three ac or if it's gonna be somebody else. But that's. That's definitely coming. Like, people want to do that. Like, people want that. That to happen.
00:37:06.954 - 00:37:26.802, Speaker B: Like, and I think it's technologically, like, feasible. I don't think it's impossible. So. Do you? Like, I honestly, maybe I'm drinking the Kool aid or whatever, but I almost see it with nfts. I almost see it. I almost see it happening.
00:37:26.866 - 00:37:30.270, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, five years, a long time.
00:37:30.570 - 00:38:05.460, Speaker B: Everyone was saying what you were saying about nfts, about all coins. Like, there were definitely a million people or, like, a shit ton of people that were, like, bitcoin cash supporters. Like, none. Nobody would have thought that. Like, I mean, maybe there were some people that, like, there was. You had to be a little bit crazy to think that you would be able to borrow against bitcoin cash, like through those years. And like, realistically you can now I'm sure you go on, like, go somewhere and borrow against bitcoin cash.
00:38:07.960 - 00:38:11.048, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we do get there.
00:38:11.104 - 00:38:13.780, Speaker B: Use case. There's like, no use case for litecoin.
00:38:14.240 - 00:38:21.704, Speaker A: There's none payments, you could say, depending on who you ask. No payments is a week.
00:38:21.872 - 00:38:53.790, Speaker B: It's just derivatives of like the same fucking thing. And so I feel like that's what we saw with NFT, just derivatives of the same fucking thing. Derivative, 10,000 plus collections. And I feel like we're always gonna have some value just from the community. They have like, bitcoin cash. People were only able to borrow against something like that because there were a bunch of fucking weirdos love bitcoin cash that had a shit ton and, and like, there was a market there.
00:38:55.050 - 00:39:11.378, Speaker A: Well, if you look at why did people own something like bitcoin cash or litecoin or Luna or XRP or whatever? Because they believed in the project and the fundamentals in the tech whatever, right? Yeah, but why do people tech are.
00:39:11.394 - 00:39:15.950, Speaker B: Just the same as the fundamentals in tech are derivatives of bitcoin.
00:39:16.420 - 00:40:17.166, Speaker A: But my question is, why do people own nfts? Like, if. Okay, obviously, like most of them right now is just under the assumption they can sell it to someone later for a higher price. But at its core, to me, if you buy an NFT and if you hold it for longer than six months, it's more than just that, usually. And those assets, those longer term, like NFT assets are going to be the ones that, that are first to have that kind of utility where you can just go and borrow against them and do whatever with them. And for those, a lot of people own those for the community aspect is still there. I think that's similar for bitcoin cash or for crypto punks. Obviously those communities are not comparable in any way, but I think an oversimplification and oversimplification is you can, you can treat them as equal, but people also own nfts just because they like them, because they can own this picture.
00:40:17.166 - 00:40:20.934, Speaker A: It's like, oh, this, this penguin's cute. I want it. It's mine now.
00:40:21.062 - 00:40:27.022, Speaker B: It's just like a layer of speculation. I think it's the same, like, I think it's the same thing boiled down.
00:40:27.206 - 00:40:30.862, Speaker A: I think it's stronger. I think it's, I think it's stronger.
00:40:31.006 - 00:40:35.500, Speaker B: So it's a better version, basically.
00:40:37.440 - 00:40:56.352, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, like something, if you look at like XRP for example, people were and still are, like, not as much now, obviously, but just absolutely insane about that token, that technology. And just like, what it could mean.
00:40:56.416 - 00:41:29.948, Speaker B: It's because of the community, because of what they hear from, like, the people that are, like, higher ups in the community. There's the people that are like, like hex. Like they hear from that fucking Richard heart guy. Like this is this, like, I've been doing this and like, they're not gonna listen to anybody else. And so I feel like it's the same thing with an NFT community. Like the D gods guys are gonna listen to whatever the fuck Frank says. No matter how shit the project is, they're gonna listen to what Frank says.
00:41:29.948 - 00:41:43.640, Speaker B: And like, Frank's gonna be like, we're building and we're doing this and like, we're. We're. Our graph looks like this and like, we're so much better than this in this way. No matter what the floor price is, they're gonna listen to Frank.
00:41:44.100 - 00:41:58.236, Speaker A: But my point is. My point is, is that what these altcoin communities that, like, the same thing applies, you're totally right. But they have to, there's like mental gymnastics they have to do to get to the point of whatever their end goal is.
00:41:58.268 - 00:42:01.840, Speaker B: End goal being adoption or NFT.
00:42:02.340 - 00:42:18.612, Speaker A: Let's for now, just like that's, you could say that's for both in some cases, but for all coins, it's like a necessity. If you look at NFTs, that can be the case sometimes, but other times it's simpler than that. It's just people have a picture that they like.
00:42:18.676 - 00:42:19.212, Speaker B: It's easy.
00:42:19.276 - 00:42:24.010, Speaker A: You have a picture, you like it, you own it, it's yours. Was the last time crypto punk shipped something.
00:42:26.510 - 00:42:31.526, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's, you could say, like, when's the last time bitcoin ship something? Lightning network.
00:42:31.598 - 00:42:46.078, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Bitcoin still has yet to ship. Bitcoin still has. They like their whole promise is his sound money, digital gold, inflation, hedge, blah, blah, blah, all that shit. That's like, that's what I was talking about, the mental gymnastics.
00:42:46.254 - 00:43:05.210, Speaker B: But crypto punks as promise is being like a fucking. Well, you could say that crypto punks fulfilled their promises. I mean, like, what their end goal? Like, if you're an NFT holder right now, you buy an NFT today. Like, best case scenario, it gets sold at Sotheby's or Christie's and you're a real fucking art piece.
00:43:05.550 - 00:43:10.486, Speaker A: Mm hmm. So technically, like, people, people like, people.
00:43:10.558 - 00:43:16.330, Speaker B: Say that bitcoin fulfilled its value as like a. It's like a digital gold.
00:43:17.950 - 00:43:20.758, Speaker A: Right, right. Okay. But bitcoins, extreme example.
00:43:20.814 - 00:43:25.410, Speaker B: People still believe that, but they're like the OG and like every. Yeah, yeah.
00:43:26.590 - 00:43:35.926, Speaker A: Bitcoin is an extreme example because you can look at people who entered in, like, 2012 and they would be very satisfied with where they're at right now. If you look at XRP leaders, those.
00:43:35.958 - 00:44:00.960, Speaker B: Are the leaders in the fucking. In the cult community. And you can say that with any coin that's done anything, like, oh, I've made a shit ton of money. So, like, when this shit comes around again, you're gonna make a shit ton of money. I feel like these can sell that way easier. Not way easier, but they could also sell it just like all coins do.
00:44:02.540 - 00:44:22.950, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I think right now I think they're similar and I. They're similar. Like, you're right about them being similar in the community and, like, hive mind kind of regard. My point is just that there's the simplicity that NFTs offer for what's genuinely fun for people is something that altcoins never had.
00:44:24.370 - 00:44:31.190, Speaker B: True. It's true. But I feel like, boil that down as well. It's also just being a part of a group.
00:44:32.490 - 00:44:49.694, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, yeah. It's a big part of it. But you wouldn't. You wouldn't go. You wouldn't go on twitter and share, I don't know, share your, like, bitcoin balance and be like, oh, look at my. Bitcoins are so fucking cool.
00:44:49.694 - 00:44:57.214, Speaker A: You would go and share your. You have gone and shared your d. God. And been like, wow, this shit so sweet. And everybody goes and you up share.
00:44:57.302 - 00:45:11.468, Speaker B: But you share your. I mean, like, with. With bitcoin, you share, like, you share the use cases of it, I guess. Like, oh, like, like, I'm not talking about just sharing it between.
00:45:11.644 - 00:45:13.920, Speaker A: Give me a. Give me one use case for bitcoin.
00:45:14.380 - 00:45:41.286, Speaker B: I mean, let's say you're. Let's say you think of it as digital gold. It's a better version of gold because you don't. You can put it on a ledger and memorize the code and cross borders and have your money. Whereas, like, if you were a ukrainian and crossing over to Poland with a sack full of gold, you could have got robbed at the fucking border. Okay, like, that's a use case is what I'm saying. But, like, people are gonna say that about a million different things.
00:45:41.286 - 00:45:47.170, Speaker B: Like, to me, crypto punks is bitcoin and apes are a theory.
00:45:48.350 - 00:45:52.354, Speaker A: I hate that comparison. I hate that comparison.
00:45:52.542 - 00:45:58.274, Speaker B: Apes are constantly making, like, some new shit. They came out with a fucking game called dookie dash.
00:45:58.402 - 00:45:59.394, Speaker A: Oh my God.
00:45:59.562 - 00:46:29.080, Speaker B: Paying to play. At the end of the day, people are paying to play. That's kind of the whole thesis of like a theory. And where people are paying to use the network, whether or not normal people value the Ethereum network, there are people on the planet that are deciding that I want to use this and I'm gonna pay to use it. So it's like a value. There's, there's value prop there. And so, like, as it iterates, people are gonna be more inclined to pay to do it or pay to play.
00:46:29.080 - 00:47:09.540, Speaker B: And so I think that's what bored apes does where they just keep on iterating, keep on doing new shit that crypto bunks didn't do. And so, like, it's, it's like a better version almost. Even though I fucking hate apes and I wouldn't compare them to Ethereum, like my, my connection with Ethereum to my connection with fucking apes. But I could see how a porters see their connection to apes as like a connection to something new and innovative. Not like crypto punks that are just boring and gold. Because you can say like, crypto punks are the gold of nfts. They're holding their value.
00:47:09.540 - 00:47:15.230, Speaker B: They're just fucking sitting there. I mean, I don't know how well they've held their value, but it's a good question, actually.
00:47:15.270 - 00:47:26.998, Speaker A: I don't know either. They have no, there's none. There's none listed on Opensea. Holy shit.
00:47:27.174 - 00:47:27.894, Speaker B: I see it.
00:47:27.942 - 00:47:47.780, Speaker A: This is such a wild. It's just crazy how this is a thing, like, just consistently 65 plus, probably like an average of like 70 to 80 sales. It looks like no liquid. It's just no one's listed. Everything's like OTC probably.
00:47:48.120 - 00:48:08.140, Speaker B: Yeah, that's how, that's how bitcoin was OTC. Who knows? Maybe I drank too much of, like, I'm believing in this shit too much. But I see it. I just see like another speculation bubble on the rise.
00:48:09.600 - 00:48:10.464, Speaker A: I hope so.
00:48:10.552 - 00:48:44.850, Speaker B: I mean, I think. I think you more than me are positioning yourself for that speculation to come. Zi, I think, like in that tiki video, you were saying, like, a lot of the speculation is gonna come from the, like, the marketplaces and like, the new apps that are coming out for all of these because no one's gonna know how to value, like, okay for blur, right? How are you valuing, evaluating blur, token?
00:48:45.430 - 00:48:47.810, Speaker A: You're thinking about that.
00:48:48.470 - 00:49:04.208, Speaker B: You're probably putting it above looks rare, but you're not putting it above opensea even. And Opensea doesn't have a token. So, like, the upper side is, like, infinite, and the lower. The lower bound is, like, looks rare.
00:49:04.264 - 00:49:09.048, Speaker A: The problem with that is, like. Like, opensea's probably had a raise.
00:49:09.104 - 00:49:13.880, Speaker B: So, like, there's some kind of valuation, but there's no token that, like, they're valuing.
00:49:13.960 - 00:49:35.576, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, they've definitely raised that, like, a ten, maybe eleven figure valuation. The problem with blur is, like, we don't know anything about the tokenomics yet. And the airdrop, it just seems like everybody's fucking getting the airdrop. Like, I don't. I. Like, I go on here and I. I have, like, 90 of these crates from airdrop two, and then I go to airdrop three.
00:49:35.576 - 00:49:52.446, Speaker A: I go to airdrop through. I have 100% listing loyalty and 33 bit points, which is, like, I bid on blur pretty often. Then I look at the leaderboard. My boost is only one x. And at the top, everybody has 2.5 x. And, like, the top, the top bidder has 36k points.
00:49:52.446 - 00:50:03.270, Speaker A: I have 33. So, like, the thing is, is this is gonna, like, 33k or 33, 33, 33. And this guy has 36k.
00:50:03.350 - 00:50:20.738, Speaker B: It might. It might end up being like a. I feel like a Stargate was where it just gets fucking, like, dumped to shit and then has its, like, own moment. And it may be way farther out than I thought, but I think there's a moment there. I think there's a could be.
00:50:20.794 - 00:50:24.826, Speaker A: I mean, the airdrops coming, what, like, February 13?
00:50:24.898 - 00:50:30.390, Speaker B: I want to say not just. Not just blur, but, like, nft fine. General, like, these are gonna come.
00:50:30.690 - 00:50:34.426, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, nft. I mean, yeah, nft five has yet to have its moment.
00:50:34.498 - 00:50:42.630, Speaker B: Million marketplaces that drop a bunch of different shit. So I'm. I mean, I'm adding that to my narrative. My narrative list.
00:50:43.250 - 00:50:47.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's. It's already. It's already getting pretty fucking big. It's just not like, I don't want.
00:50:48.002 - 00:50:52.430, Speaker B: To make the mistake of thinking that everyone knows this when not everyone does.
00:50:54.090 - 00:51:17.560, Speaker A: It's just communities are small now, or our whole community is small now. So, like, when something does happen, when something does start to take notice, it feels like everyone knows when in reality, like, maybe most people do know, but you have to remember there's only, like, five of us left at this point. So, like, yeah, it's more so about what gets. What gets more people interested. Otherwise, just the same shit floating around.
00:51:20.020 - 00:51:27.116, Speaker B: I think. I think I like the NFT fight narrative. And I'm. Yeah, I mean, actually try and play it.
00:51:27.268 - 00:51:49.810, Speaker A: There's. I mean, yeah, if you got the spice NFT, that's like one of. I think that's one of the. Probably one of the best ways to play that, like, sector right now, because you're essentially, you're earning yield. You're getting exposure to a platform that is supporting any. Every major lending platform. And I mean, you get an NFT, you got like a pretty cool looking NFT.
00:51:50.390 - 00:51:55.022, Speaker B: I do like the. Their nfts because they also seem like brown people.
00:51:55.126 - 00:51:57.670, Speaker A: Like, yeah, one of the representations like.
00:51:57.710 - 00:52:03.712, Speaker B: Me, you know, I mean, like, like I would rock that as a PFP.
00:52:03.896 - 00:52:09.740, Speaker A: Yeah, they're nice. They're nice. They're like, they're like Middle eastern Azuki's or like doing Azuki's.
00:52:11.000 - 00:52:16.100, Speaker B: Yeah. You want to talk about the stuff that we missed?
00:52:17.240 - 00:52:18.760, Speaker A: What do we not hear every day?
00:52:18.800 - 00:52:21.168, Speaker B: Staring at crypto Twitter? We missed aptos.
00:52:21.304 - 00:52:31.114, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. All these fucking trades, those canto. I haven't, I haven't been playing any altcoins. I'm just playing nfts. Dose I do have tracks.
00:52:31.202 - 00:52:36.510, Speaker B: I've been bag holding tracks for like a while. And they're gaining, gaining some steam.
00:52:37.450 - 00:52:39.394, Speaker A: Racks. I don't expect fracks.
00:52:39.482 - 00:52:40.362, Speaker B: Token.
00:52:40.546 - 00:52:52.076, Speaker A: I like frax. Yeah, I don't expect their token to do spectacularly, though. I really like their product. I mean, they're up since the start of the year. They're up over two x. It's pretty cool.
00:52:52.188 - 00:53:28.330, Speaker B: The one, the last interview I heard from Sam was like, he was legit talking about getting a. I don't know what he called it, but, like, there's some kind of pass or certification or something you can get from like a central bank that apparently USDC might get. Like, it's basically like your, your, like, you get a direct account with them. Like, you can. It's the most secure way of showing funds or like, proving. Proving funds. Like, just like a safety thing.
00:53:28.330 - 00:53:37.810, Speaker B: Apparently he's going after it, and like, apparently Frax is saying that they're gonna try and go after it. Who knows?
00:53:39.510 - 00:53:40.406, Speaker A: But interest.
00:53:40.478 - 00:53:41.566, Speaker B: I like franks.
00:53:41.678 - 00:53:46.300, Speaker A: I like, I think they have decentralized fraxes.
00:53:46.840 - 00:54:13.790, Speaker B: Not at all. It's basically a wrap USDC with, like, in terms of, like, decentralization, they're probably like, at best, 25%. Like 25%. Like algo. They're there. The way that their algo works with the fracs share token, like, makes sense, but I think it's gonna take a long time to scale but I mean.
00:54:14.650 - 00:54:26.434, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's for sure. But they also, I don't know, Frax's token as a stable. Yeah, I don't either. I just like. I like. I just like their. Specifically, their staking product.
00:54:26.434 - 00:54:39.766, Speaker A: They're their liquid staking. I think that's pretty fucking sweet. I mean, it's probably the best option out there right now. Yeah. The FBI is also. The FBI is really interesting, but, like, I don't really see anyone using it.
00:54:39.798 - 00:54:55.278, Speaker B: Yeah, no one's gonna use that. But I think the staking, their LSD is, like, their rate is subsidized by what they make from the rest of fracks, like, from Frax London stuff. That's how they're getting that high rate. Right?
00:54:55.334 - 00:54:56.770, Speaker A: I don't know, to be honest.
00:54:57.510 - 00:55:15.250, Speaker B: I think that's what it is. And so I think it, like, they have some podcast called the flywheel pod. It's like two of these, like, Frax guys, and they have, like, a legitimate, legitimate flywheel that's, like, working.
00:55:16.670 - 00:55:34.824, Speaker A: You can also. I haven't done this, but I know you can. You can loop. You can loop your liquid staking on all. You can do it all on fracks. You can borrow, borrow against your. Your liquid stake frack, like sf, prax, eth, whatever, sfr xe, you can restake it.
00:55:34.824 - 00:55:43.380, Speaker A: Borrow against it again. Restake it. I don't know what you can get from that, but you can probably loop that up to, like, I would guess at least like 2020, 5% APR.
00:55:44.160 - 00:55:52.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I. I really like what they're doing. They have everything in one place, realistically. Like, if anyone's gonna be like a.
00:55:52.696 - 00:55:56.752, Speaker A: Oh, dude, they have a bridge now. Have you seen this fracks ferry?
00:55:56.896 - 00:56:01.060, Speaker B: Yeah, the Frax ferry. It's actually such a nice Ui. Like, it's like a little boat and everything.
00:56:01.480 - 00:56:04.940, Speaker A: A slower, simpler, but more secure method of bridging tokens.
00:56:05.320 - 00:56:06.456, Speaker B: Share screen on it.
00:56:06.528 - 00:56:06.896, Speaker A: Wow.
00:56:06.968 - 00:56:07.780, Speaker B: Can you.
00:56:08.120 - 00:56:13.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking at their docs right now. Area that can be used to ship tokens between chains.
00:56:14.320 - 00:56:14.952, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:15.056 - 00:56:19.220, Speaker A: How does this work? This looks like some nerd shit.
00:56:20.590 - 00:56:23.130, Speaker B: Just go to the Ui. Just go to the UX.
00:56:23.910 - 00:56:42.174, Speaker A: Well, I want to understand. I kind of. I kind of want to understand how it works. Yeah, no, there's a dispute function. Okay, so it's just a. It's just a bridge. It's just a bridge where they're, like the counterparty.
00:56:42.174 - 00:56:55.198, Speaker A: Or they're the. They're the middleman. Six day. Oh, shit. Wait, I know this is how. So it's not used very often, I guess. Where are they getting this liquidity from? Or is this from there?
00:56:55.294 - 00:56:55.930, Speaker B: They.
00:56:59.830 - 00:57:09.206, Speaker A: Oh, it's just for. Oh, interesting. Yeah, interesting. These chain supports.
00:57:09.358 - 00:57:12.504, Speaker B: Were you a big like curve guy? Curving convex guy?
00:57:12.552 - 00:57:34.272, Speaker A: No, not really. I mean I, I remember dirt like around when the curve wars were first like gaining like steam just with like them starting or happening. That was when I was first like seriously, seriously getting into crypto like full time. And I just remember really, really struggling to like understand that whole ordeal just because like I don't know, like locked.
00:57:34.296 - 00:57:44.590, Speaker B: Up a hundred grand for four years though. I mean there was a lot of people that did the four year lockup. Imagine if you locked up a significant.
00:57:44.890 - 00:57:47.274, Speaker A: Amount at that point in the market.
00:57:47.322 - 00:58:02.630, Speaker B: Too many people during her wars. Yeah, they locked up four years and they were like hooking on all of the cuz like abracadabra was giving so many rewards so they were making so much money every week from like the incentive.
00:58:03.100 - 00:58:15.800, Speaker A: You could say that for like any, any token with like with the vote escrow mechanics. Like imagine locking up dopex for four years. Yeah, I do have like I recently exited dopex, actually.
00:58:16.260 - 00:58:19.600, Speaker B: I have a singular RDP or RDPX.
00:58:19.900 - 00:58:22.332, Speaker A: I had, I had, I think I.
00:58:22.356 - 00:58:24.920, Speaker B: Bought it for $200 or something. Fucking nuts.
00:58:25.220 - 00:58:56.490, Speaker A: Yeah, my entry prices were terrible for this entire like ecosystem. But I had, I had like twelve RDPX just like sitting around that I was going to do something with, but I just never got around to doing it. And then I had, I was farming plutus DPX for a while, which I actually got some pretty good rewards out of. But I recently exited all of those because I have, I've just every as over the past like three or four months, every like couple weeks or so. I just think about all my positions. I don't have it like written down anywhere, but I just think about it, I'm like, damn. I have, I'm spread way too thin.
00:58:56.490 - 00:59:26.790, Speaker A: Like why am I, why am I in like 20 different ecosystems at once? I do, I go and check it every now and then, but it's like, it's just like from like a trading perspective. Like a lot of it's farming or a lot of it's just like sitting in spot. It just doesn't seem like a, like a good option. Like I would rather have like less than ten open positions at any given time. Not including like the obvious ones. Not including just like holding spot ether, the obvious shit.
00:59:27.210 - 00:59:29.030, Speaker B: I don't think there's any other obvious.
00:59:29.930 - 00:59:36.170, Speaker A: I mean if I had more. If I had more money, there would be some obvious shit. And then he's like, I'll get that.
00:59:36.290 - 00:59:36.738, Speaker B: I have.
00:59:36.794 - 00:59:42.186, Speaker A: I have, like, a. Like, a. In my mind, I have, like, a tier list of, like, progressions of nfTs.
00:59:42.218 - 00:59:46.394, Speaker B: I'm gonna go ahead with that. What are your obvious entities?
00:59:46.522 - 00:59:55.370, Speaker A: All right, so the. I don't know. I don't know exactly what the. Like, the floor price. What the difference in floor price is for these.
00:59:55.450 - 01:00:00.670, Speaker B: I'm. I'm still hung up on you saying that, like, apes are gonna outperform e over five years.
01:00:02.410 - 01:00:17.296, Speaker A: Probably. Yeah. It's like, I think most blue chip NFts would outperform ETH anyways. I like apes. Like, I would like, if you're gonna give me an ape, I'll totally fucking take an ape, but I'm not gonna spend a any eth on that ecosystem whatsoever. I like squiggles. I would totally.
01:00:17.296 - 01:00:30.500, Speaker A: That's probably, like, squiggles and Azuki's are probably, like, the two lowest price ones that I would want. Obviously, punk. Once we really get up there, you can talk like, fidenzas and autoglyph, but that's, like, I don't know if I would ever spend that much eth on an NFT.
01:00:30.920 - 01:00:50.610, Speaker B: Let's go from, like, let's go from, like, bottom to top. Like, bottom to top. Like, incredible. What's the first thing you're grabbing as soon as you hit that mark? You know what I'm saying? Like, you. You make three e tonight. Like, what are you grabbing for three with the three?
01:00:50.650 - 01:01:02.482, Speaker A: Well, everything. Everything. So I have my. My. Like, my NFT portfolio is essentially split into, like, three baskets. The. The latter of which are.
01:01:02.482 - 01:01:20.670, Speaker A: The last one is pract, like, non existent right now because I don't have. The last one is long term holds essentially, like, stuff that I would just sit with for I don't even know how long. Like, years, probably. I don't have any in that. The only ones that may be in that category would be this one small brain. I have maybe a French. This.
01:01:20.670 - 01:01:33.516, Speaker A: I still have one friendship bracelet. No, not yet. Not yet. Renga's in the second one. The first one. The first one's just, like, bullshit that, like, the first one's like, feet picks, like, abstraction, shit like that. The Trump NFT.
01:01:33.516 - 01:01:42.612, Speaker A: The second one is, like, Ranga's Valhalla. Small brains and friendship bracelets are, like, on the line between the two. They're more so in, like, the second tranche.
01:01:42.636 - 01:01:45.080, Speaker B: I think, though, you're putting small brains in the.
01:01:46.660 - 01:01:56.236, Speaker A: They're close out of. Out of everything. My portfolio, they're. They're the only one. One of the only ones that comes close. Actually, no, I do have one in the third category, but I'm never selling it. It's my duck.
01:01:56.236 - 01:02:00.808, Speaker A: It's my little noun. Yeah, I'm just never selling that one ever. Because why would I? It's not worth.
01:02:00.904 - 01:02:04.900, Speaker B: And it's gonna keep. The supply is gonna increase forever.
01:02:05.280 - 01:02:05.680, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:05.720 - 01:02:05.912, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:05.936 - 01:02:22.856, Speaker A: I mean, it's going to zero, and I'm happy with it. Like, send it to fucking zero. But, yeah, small brains is. They're not quite there yet. I still have, like, it still has yet to be seen how, like, the arbitrum nft ecosystem will do. But I like where they're at right now. I really like my entry.
01:02:22.856 - 01:02:27.016, Speaker A: I just. I'm scared to buy it now because it's already, like, more than two x since then.
01:02:27.088 - 01:02:32.740, Speaker B: Are you two x on in e terms or. How much did you. You probably made more than.
01:02:33.600 - 01:02:37.100, Speaker A: I don't even pay attention. Well, I bought. I didn't buy magic. I bought neat.
01:02:37.800 - 01:02:41.296, Speaker B: What if you sold in? Well, I guess it's probably just evened out by now.
01:02:41.368 - 01:02:45.100, Speaker A: I have no idea. I don't pay attention. I don't even pay attention to USD terms.
01:02:45.520 - 01:02:49.500, Speaker B: It was like 900 magic when I was looking at it.
01:02:50.170 - 01:02:53.546, Speaker A: You were looking at. You were looking at it on. On treasure?
01:02:53.698 - 01:02:54.430, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:55.770 - 01:03:02.962, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. I would. I would. I checked them on there a little bit, but I didn't. I didn't want to place a bit there. I couldn't place a bit there.
01:03:02.962 - 01:03:19.422, Speaker A: I don't remember what it was. So I just did it on e, but, yeah, I don't. I don't know. I don't really check. I don't really check the floor. Like, the prices and other shit treasures been doing well. I mean, they had that one day when they got listed on, like, binance or something where they.
01:03:19.422 - 01:03:23.238, Speaker A: Or magic that was. They got listed on, they just exploded.
01:03:23.414 - 01:03:26.926, Speaker B: They're launching some, like, v two shit. Some kind of, like.
01:03:26.998 - 01:03:45.490, Speaker A: I've always liked them. Honestly, gaming, I've always liked them. I just entered at the wrong time. I entered at, like, $4 back in 2021 or whatever. Yeah. I still have a bunch of, like, shitty, like, consumables from bridge world that are just sitting in my wallet from. From.
01:03:45.490 - 01:04:12.258, Speaker A: Damn. Almost, I guess a little over a year now. Not that long, but yeah, the third cat, like, long term shit, like stuff that would just be, like, a part of my collection. I don't really have anything else that's in that bracket yet. I mean, small brains. Small brains, friendship bracelets, rengos, Valhalla. Those are probably, like, the closest to being there, but there's nothing that's, like, solidly in there besides my little noun.
01:04:12.258 - 01:04:32.754, Speaker A: And that's not even something like, that's just because it's my PFP. It's not for any other reason. But if I were to start building that up, which I totally would like to, it's just like, the upside is not as. As clear as just, like, flipping right now, I would. I don't know. I guess the first thing I would. My penguin would.
01:04:32.754 - 01:04:38.164, Speaker A: If I still had that pudgy penguin, that would still. That would definitely be in there. Maybe I was thinking about getting, like.
01:04:38.212 - 01:04:47.572, Speaker B: Bean, do you, like, you lay in bed and, like, put the phone down and stare over the ceiling and think about that penguin?
01:04:47.716 - 01:04:56.740, Speaker A: It wasn't even. I don't know. I mean, I missed out on what, like, three eats from that. Like, yeah, that's. That's a lot of money. But, like, I don't know. I fucked up worse.
01:04:56.740 - 01:05:03.002, Speaker A: Like, Luna happened. I first. I remember first seeing punks at, like, three with, like, $200.
01:05:03.196 - 01:05:06.610, Speaker B: I feel like opportunity misses hurt more than direct losses.
01:05:07.990 - 01:05:08.770, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:09.110 - 01:05:12.130, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, mentally, like, emotionally.
01:05:13.430 - 01:05:22.930, Speaker A: That's definitely true. Yeah. But I don't know. I mean, it's just a part of it. It's just a part of the game. Like, it just happens when you're in crypto. Like, it is what it is.
01:05:22.930 - 01:05:26.790, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm watching this. So this thing.
01:05:26.910 - 01:05:34.180, Speaker B: My question is, like, well, I guess it's easy to answer, like, why we. Why. Why didn't we buy aptos?
01:05:35.680 - 01:05:39.768, Speaker A: I don't like evaluating our own.
01:05:39.904 - 01:05:42.584, Speaker B: Evaluating our own, like, thought process through.
01:05:42.672 - 01:05:48.512, Speaker A: I mean, I'm fine on that trade, honestly, I don't. Yeah, I not.
01:05:48.576 - 01:05:56.340, Speaker B: Dude, we heard so much about it. We, like, we saw the airdrop in the summer. We didn't farm the airdrop when we probably could have.
01:05:57.280 - 01:06:02.864, Speaker A: Yeah, the airdrop. The airdrop was like, what about that?
01:06:02.872 - 01:06:05.460, Speaker B: But that was on the bottom.
01:06:06.480 - 01:06:18.112, Speaker A: I just. I'm just. I'm just bearish on it. Like, I had. I had no reason to believe that it would bounce back the way it did. I, like, I don't know. Aptos.
01:06:18.216 - 01:06:26.430, Speaker B: I felt like it was a little bit of, like, its association with Solana, like, its comparability with Solana. And Solana was, like, dying at the same time.
01:06:27.010 - 01:06:55.628, Speaker A: And so I honestly, I was comfortable picking up that Solana trade Solana, I had less issues with at the bottom than most with Apdos. I just see no, like, long term future there. So even if. Even if I did, like, pick that up, I wouldn't have been comfortable with the position. Like, I still can't tell you why it pumped as much as it did. I still can't tell you why it's as hyped as it is. Besides, from, like, a funding perspective, like, it's just.
01:06:55.628 - 01:07:16.960, Speaker A: I don't know. There's just apdos. Swe is a little bit better, you could say, but Apdos and swe, I don't know, like, shardium. These, like, marginally better. All l one s with ridiculous amounts of funding are, like, are all things that, like, need to die in crypto. I think they're, like, a lot of. What's wrong with the space? I think.
01:07:19.380 - 01:07:32.780, Speaker B: I think their best case scenario is whoever just makes, like, an on chain order book exchange, because I think they have the capacity to do it. Like, technically, I don't know.
01:07:32.820 - 01:07:34.532, Speaker A: I mean, why can't you feel like it?
01:07:34.676 - 01:07:35.300, Speaker B: I feel like it.
01:07:35.340 - 01:07:42.760, Speaker A: How is that any better than on, like, then on an ethel two? As we, like, scale more and as we. Because that's farther along those ecosystems.
01:07:43.420 - 01:07:47.608, Speaker B: You can't do it. Order book exchange on fucking. On an l two now.
01:07:47.784 - 01:07:48.700, Speaker A: Why not?
01:07:49.400 - 01:07:54.976, Speaker B: The cost is still too high. Well, now, yeah, as a throughput. Yeah. I'm saying, like, right now.
01:07:55.008 - 01:07:58.100, Speaker A: But, but we'll, but we'll get there. You can't do that on Apdos either.
01:07:58.760 - 01:07:59.980, Speaker B: You don't know.
01:08:00.280 - 01:08:06.220, Speaker A: May 1 one day. Yeah, I'm sure. But no, you. There's no way in health, they think, does it sooner.
01:08:06.880 - 01:08:08.048, Speaker B: I say I don't, I don't.
01:08:08.104 - 01:08:25.184, Speaker A: I don't know enough about what's going on in the aptos, like, development to say, but I do know that since they've launched. Dude, do you remember when they first launched? That was. That was a shit show. They were doing like twelve. They're doing like twelve tps or something like that.
01:08:25.272 - 01:08:30.340, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I do remember that. Holy fuck. I actually, I forgot. Wait, is it still shit?
01:08:31.680 - 01:08:32.660, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:08:33.160 - 01:08:35.420, Speaker B: People are buying Aptos nfts too.
01:08:36.240 - 01:08:50.540, Speaker A: People are buying Aptos domains. I saw. I don't know. Aptos. I think. I think when you, when you're in BC, you can see what's wrong with app goes a lot more. See a lot of, a lot of.
01:08:50.540 - 01:09:18.520, Speaker A: Maybe we cut this part out, but you see a lot of funds just throwing money at it. Like, it was literally just a domino effect. Like, they closed the big round with some big names, they closed two big rounds with some big names. And from that point on, everyone was just like, okay, we're gonna fund this. Like, all the smaller guys, even the bigger guys, too. From that point on, they're like, all right, we're just gonna fund this shit out of everything that comes out of this ecosystem, and it's gonna fly. Like, it just makes no sense.
01:09:18.520 - 01:09:22.520, Speaker A: It's, it's, there's nothing to it, in my opinion.
01:09:23.580 - 01:09:49.626, Speaker B: I feel like the way I saw avalanche use, like, avalanche rush to become, like, an actual thing. Like, I don't like avalanche because I bought into, like, all the bullshit that happened to there, but the fact that they use avalanche rush to garner so much and, like, an actual community now it feels like anyone can do it. I think that's why.
01:09:49.658 - 01:09:54.378, Speaker A: You don't think those days are behind us, though. You don't think people are smarter than that now?
01:09:54.514 - 01:09:56.842, Speaker B: No, no, no, I really don't.
01:09:57.026 - 01:10:04.470, Speaker A: There was so much more money space when, when avalanche was, was going on. When avalanche was peaking, there was so much more money in the space.
01:10:05.410 - 01:10:32.788, Speaker B: Yeah, but, like, I feel like people are betting that. No, but, like, if you incentivize people, they'll, they will fucking come. They will come. People will come. If people, if there was, if there was Luna level ust level incentivization, people would fucking go. People would fucking go. Really?
01:10:32.844 - 01:10:35.772, Speaker A: You know where you can find us, t level incentivization right now?
01:10:35.956 - 01:10:36.732, Speaker B: Where?
01:10:36.916 - 01:10:41.932, Speaker A: Nft five. And look at how much different. How, how is that different?
01:10:42.076 - 01:11:11.920, Speaker B: That's different because you can't. Because I'm talking like, anchor. Like, if you sell another anchor, there are gonna be people and there's gonna be me and you that sit there just like the old eth guys did that all of the other algo stables and that we didn't listen to. And we were like, they were like, oh, don't get into that shit. It feasally is not possible. We were like 20% ApR or 1020 percent py. Like, we're, we're going in.
01:11:12.380 - 01:11:16.308, Speaker A: But if, if that's, if that's why we entered, if that's why people would.
01:11:16.324 - 01:11:17.828, Speaker B: Enter products more of.
01:11:17.884 - 01:11:30.410, Speaker A: Why haven't people flocked to NFT file yet? Fuck that. Why haven't people flocked to. Why people flocked to y two k? Yeah, you don't need nfts. You can, you can, you can, er, yield against eth, against die, against USDC?
01:11:30.870 - 01:11:51.254, Speaker B: No, but I'm saying, like, you're saying nFT five is where you can get the 20%. But NFT Phi is not marketed and not perceived as like, a crypto bank. Like, Anchor was. Anchor was like a savings account. A savings account. Like that was the mantra. That was the Persona.
01:11:51.302 - 01:12:14.138, Speaker A: And you think, and you think people, and I think, in my mind, that's the thing that people wouldn't fall for again. Like, like that anchor was something for anyone. Anchor was something that anyone who's just getting crypto could use. And there was a lot of people like that at the time. There are people like me and you who are just getting into it. Everyone who's around now has been through a hell and back. They know, they know the dangers of something like that.
01:12:14.138 - 01:12:16.750, Speaker A: Like, it's not that simple. I think.
01:12:17.690 - 01:12:58.670, Speaker B: I think if you start something like that now, if you start like, something like that now, and I'm not saying, like, oh, worth it, like, they're gonna market it as, like, we're the new Luna. We're the new anchor. Like, let's just say Aptos comes out with something that's incentivized by some fucking giant incentivization program that comes from all of the fucking vc funding that they got. And they just make some, like, quote unquote killer app that's not as sound as, like a killer app, like GMX, but just is fundamentally sound enough that people believe it. I swear, everyone will go back. It doesn't have to make sense. It doesn't have to make sense.
01:12:58.670 - 01:13:21.794, Speaker B: Like, nobody's gonna learn. Like people were saying, when are people gonna learn? After every single l one? Like an aptos just fucking shot up and everyone's on Twitter is blaming it on like, korea or like, asian markets. Like they're gonna find a reason as to why this, this shit is working, whether or not it's fundamentally sound, I guess.
01:13:21.882 - 01:13:28.350, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, sure, you put enough incentives behind anything. You can. You can make anything work in the short term, but.
01:13:30.810 - 01:13:59.156, Speaker B: That'S all you need is six months of incentive. Incentive. Come on. Like, if you think about it, how much incentives did avoid? Avalanche have had like six night. They burnt through it all. They burned through it all. People are still showing off phantom daily transactions that are most likely fake graphs or just like fucking bots or whatever the fuck Andre cronier is doing on.
01:13:59.188 - 01:14:27.020, Speaker A: Dude, phantom. Phantom has, has what, like 18 years of Runway or some absurd amount of Runway and they're using how much of it for incentives? Oh, they're like, there's. They have an ecosystem. They have an ecosystem foundation and that's it. Like, like, no one is, no one is doing that anymore. I think, like, if, if you're saying that this stuff's gonna happen, then, like, the natural, the natural next step is to, like, build a position based off, is to trade based off of them.
01:14:27.140 - 01:14:29.560, Speaker B: You saw with optimism right now, though.
01:14:30.220 - 01:14:34.164, Speaker A: And where's optimism at now? They're back down in second place, where they were. They've always been.
01:14:34.212 - 01:14:36.204, Speaker B: Yeah, the transactions are fucking down.
01:14:36.332 - 01:14:39.916, Speaker A: It's not. People know that. That doesn't work long term anymore.
01:14:40.028 - 01:14:45.108, Speaker B: But the token price went, like, what, two, three, x? It's in, like, isn't it in fucking price discovery?
01:14:45.204 - 01:15:20.950, Speaker A: But, but apdos. The people behind apdos. Okay? I don't think optimism, price discovery right now, but people, the people behind Aptos, they don't give a shit about token price. Like investors might. Investors want to dump, sure. But, like, the last thing that, if you're building an ecosystem, an l one, a protocol, whatever, and you're trying to make it successful, the last thing you want to do is pump it with temporary incentives, knowing that this has been done dozens of times before and it hasn't been sustainable on pretty much any occasion.
01:15:22.300 - 01:15:25.132, Speaker B: It's just like, at price discovery, they're.
01:15:25.156 - 01:15:27.908, Speaker A: At all times are really. Oh, shit. You're right. It is.
01:15:28.044 - 01:15:32.932, Speaker B: They are. They were at, they were at all time highs like today.
01:15:32.996 - 01:15:35.276, Speaker A: Why are they in price discovery right now? What the fuck?
01:15:35.348 - 01:15:44.760, Speaker B: Because they got fucking pumped with roll. It's basically, that's what they got fucking pumped with. But the incentive program wasn't even that good.
01:15:45.820 - 01:15:50.398, Speaker A: Like, but the thing is, is the chain activities down. As far as I know, it came.
01:15:50.454 - 01:16:03.570, Speaker B: Back down because the incentives just stopped. Like, they had their, like. And they didn't. I don't think they went all out with the incentives. I think it was just like a little blip of, like, incentives in terms of, like, how much money they probably have to put together.
01:16:04.070 - 01:16:18.560, Speaker A: I'm trying to find. Oh, sweet. All right. They're down in transaction fees. That's good. Way down in transaction fees. They're, the weekly revenue has fallen off a fucking cliff.
01:16:18.560 - 01:16:22.124, Speaker A: It's been dead since May even.
01:16:22.172 - 01:16:59.160, Speaker B: But work, damn, hold up. No, I think, I think incentives will make any fucking elbow work. They need just like, a few decent apps. Like, I think aptos, realistically, aptos hype is probably just getting started. Like, they sit on this level of hype for, like, six, nine months and wait for, like, some kind of bull market to, like, really show up. If, if it does, I'm sure they have more ammo in the tank.
01:17:00.420 - 01:17:07.356, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, in a bull market, days are completely different. It's totally mean.
01:17:07.388 - 01:17:09.020, Speaker B: You will be bridging over.
01:17:10.280 - 01:17:32.500, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm not, just because I'm, just because I, just because I'm bearish on them, like, long term, doesn't mean I'm not going to use them. That's like one of the most fundamental lessons in kryptos to. Is to set aside your, like, bias and preferences and, like, prioritize opportunity. Making money over being right. I I'm. It's a struggle. Like, I'm not fully there yet either.
01:17:32.800 - 01:17:36.030, Speaker B: Buying a token is, like, one thing, especially nowadays.
01:17:37.610 - 01:18:00.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not fully there yet. You know what did it for me was buying that. I don't know if you remember, he drawn that, like, hex derivative thing that, like, forex for me. I was like, damn, I guess I can just be. This thing is way. Yeah, yeah, essentially. You want to wrap up here? I'm trying to get to bed pretty soon.
01:18:03.210 - 01:18:04.070, Speaker B: All right.
01:18:04.890 - 01:18:08.550, Speaker A: Do you do an outro? I don't. I don't think we do an outro. Usually. We kind of just.
01:18:09.050 - 01:18:19.030, Speaker B: No, we don't use an outro, but I think would be a good outro. You want to just, like, spam 15 minutes volume on, on blur as the outro.
01:18:19.770 - 01:18:21.578, Speaker A: Like, just. Just go through it.
01:18:21.714 - 01:18:29.210, Speaker B: Make two, three. Like, make two, three random bets. Not like we could, but it's.
01:18:29.710 - 01:18:43.598, Speaker A: It's. It's just hard to do that on a Sunday. On a Sunday. On a Sunday, Saturday night especially because there's very little volume. Swept doodles. I guess that's kind of cool. Besides that, like, nothing, nothing of nothing of importance is gonna be up.
01:18:43.598 - 01:18:46.370, Speaker A: You're not gonna see very many collections with above one east.
01:18:49.070 - 01:18:57.580, Speaker B: Real quick. My wallet's not connected. I think we can make it a tradition of just spamming the 15 minutes volume one blur, though.
01:18:58.040 - 01:19:10.640, Speaker A: But you're right. But it's just, it's. It's so hard to come up with stuff at a time like that. You even. I mean, usually this has become less like. It's less often that I find signals here, honestly, just because, like.
01:19:10.680 - 01:19:11.856, Speaker B: Oh, my. Wait.
01:19:11.888 - 01:19:12.488, Speaker A: What?
01:19:12.664 - 01:19:15.020, Speaker B: Wait, wait, wait. What is Porsche sitting at?
01:19:16.160 - 01:19:17.820, Speaker A: Porsche. Where's Porsche?
01:19:18.640 - 01:19:21.848, Speaker B: Porsche sitting at two eth, motherfucker.
01:19:21.984 - 01:19:23.540, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I missed that one.
01:19:24.280 - 01:19:29.256, Speaker B: I had, like, fourth preference whitelist on this for point.
01:19:29.328 - 01:19:32.300, Speaker A: Would you. Was it feasible for you to mint or did you.
01:19:33.680 - 01:19:35.980, Speaker B: I was in Dubai. I didn't feel like it.
01:19:37.440 - 01:19:40.976, Speaker A: People were bought what the fuck? Paying 90 for this.
01:19:41.128 - 01:19:42.460, Speaker B: What the fuck?
01:19:45.250 - 01:19:56.630, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. I mean, this doodle was doodles. Stale sweep, whatever. Must have been kind of interesting. Oh, what the fuck? There's one guy just unloaded a bunch.
01:19:57.570 - 01:20:22.882, Speaker B: You want to guess who I was wearing a doodle hat in an interview for? Very famous singer songwriter Williams. Pharrell Williams had a doodle's hat and was like. Like. It was like a TikTok of, like, them, like, showing his outfit. He had a doodle, and he was like, doodles fucking doodle.
01:20:22.906 - 01:20:23.510, Speaker A: Wow.
01:20:24.530 - 01:20:25.630, Speaker B: Which is interest.
01:20:25.930 - 01:20:26.922, Speaker A: That is not.
01:20:27.026 - 01:20:28.990, Speaker B: You saw, right?
01:20:29.930 - 01:20:42.228, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Or no? No. Did they move to flow, or are they launching a separate collection on flow? I thought. I thought they were watching clothing like.
01:20:42.284 - 01:20:52.960, Speaker B: Or attributes thing on flow, but I think in order for it to work, they're gonna have to move the whole thing to flow or have some kind of cross chain mechanism.
01:20:54.180 - 01:21:01.248, Speaker A: I don't know much about doodles. No, there isn't shit out here, honestly. It's too late in the weekend.
01:21:01.444 - 01:21:01.896, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:21:01.968 - 01:21:04.900, Speaker A: Too deep into the weekend. Hard to open. Trades out. Anyways.
01:21:06.360 - 01:21:11.672, Speaker B: All right, that is episode four. That was a good one. I like that.
01:21:11.696 - 01:21:16.180, Speaker A: That was a good one. Yeah. It's been a while, so had a lot to talk about.
01:21:18.640 - 01:21:19.000, Speaker B: All right.
