00:00:00.240 - 00:00:00.852, Speaker A: All right.
00:00:02.630 - 00:00:08.050, Speaker B: You know how forced to listen to that for two minutes for the.
00:00:08.350 - 00:00:37.128, Speaker A: For the whole thing of, like, making the tweet that comes out with the live a lot better. You have to, like, schedule it as a broadcast in Twitter and tweet from that broadcast thing. And it can only go out at a specific time if you want to do the thumbnail with it. So, yeah, that's why. And. But, yeah, so it works. The good news is it works.
00:00:37.128 - 00:00:54.498, Speaker A: So our tweets that go out with the, like, guests won't be, like, just the title. We can, like, make it, like, the whole thing. So that'll be good. All right. The anniversary episode. It's been. It's been a year.
00:00:54.498 - 00:01:03.230, Speaker A: I was looking back at those videos, like, some of them you couldn't even hear, like, you, like, half the time.
00:01:04.850 - 00:01:15.550, Speaker B: And I found that, like, like, a couple weeks ago, right, there was one episode where, like, our voices, like, our audio was just off by, like, a good 30 seconds.
00:01:16.290 - 00:01:19.282, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that would respond before I.
00:01:19.306 - 00:01:20.710, Speaker B: Asked the question or something.
00:01:21.340 - 00:01:49.702, Speaker A: Yeah, there was one where it was, like, I think it was, like, the very first one or the second one. You were literally just like. I don't even know how I held a conversation. Like, you couldn't hear anything you were saying half the time, but, yeah, no, those were interesting episodes. The shit that I was talking about was so bad. Like, it was just like, what? Oh, dude, there was one. I should have put it in the highlight reel.
00:01:49.702 - 00:01:59.550, Speaker A: There was. You went on a whole, like, probably four minute rant on Cronus. This cronus five tweet being included.
00:01:59.630 - 00:02:00.502, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:02:00.646 - 00:02:07.686, Speaker A: Lyn Lynn's thing. Dude, it was so funny to watch back. It was so funny to watch back. But did.
00:02:07.718 - 00:02:29.500, Speaker B: I love. I love when maybe this is, like, bad. Maybe this is, like, unhealthy or, like, toxic, but I love so much being right about a project, being a scam than I am about getting a trade. Right. This token is down 99.8%, and I think they were exploited. Yeah.
00:02:29.500 - 00:02:35.904, Speaker B: Kronos. The whole GMD stuff. Like, I love doing that.
00:02:35.992 - 00:02:40.266, Speaker A: That was a good one. The GM. GMG one was funny.
00:02:40.418 - 00:02:49.710, Speaker B: I think Saul is still. Is still Mia or at least, like, on Twitter. I don't know if he's active on discord or anything like that, but.
00:02:51.490 - 00:02:52.082, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:52.186 - 00:03:00.970, Speaker B: Yeah. Did you watch the. Did you watch the first episode? I was going to watch it, but I didn't get a chance to. I wanted to see what, like, predictions we made.
00:03:01.130 - 00:03:13.290, Speaker A: I kind of just, like, watched, like, the first few minutes of each episode. But quite honestly, the first episode was like almost unwatchable in terms of quality because of.
00:03:13.330 - 00:03:15.710, Speaker B: Because of what? Like quality or audio?
00:03:16.130 - 00:03:42.164, Speaker A: Like audio. And there was like a bit of a cringe on my end, but there's. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was a interesting time. It's because we got, like, we got so wrecked. 2022. So we started 2023 because 2022 was actually very bad and 23, like 2020. Yeah, yeah.
00:03:42.164 - 00:03:56.332, Speaker A: Like, I think you'll forget, like, it. This is like all one time frame, but 22 itself was, was actually very bad. And 2023 like started the year and you could tell we were just like fucking exhausted, dude.
00:03:56.356 - 00:04:03.800, Speaker B: It was, yeah, we were like, we were just battered and beat in that for. That was like a month after FTX collapsed or two months maybe.
00:04:04.420 - 00:04:05.200, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:05.660 - 00:04:20.388, Speaker B: And everything that followed that, obviously. So, like, it was definitely, like, it was. It was a pretty optimistic podcast, all things considered. I feel like, I don't think, like, given how things were, I don't think that we were that like doom and.
00:04:20.404 - 00:04:35.210, Speaker A: Gloom, you know, we shifted towards like, then we just started doing like NFT stuff, which was fun. Like we would watch the blur 15 minutes, like at the end of some episodes.
00:04:35.250 - 00:04:44.762, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I remember that. I remember that. That was fun. You think, uh, what do you think about nft five these days? You know, that's still gonna happen?
00:04:44.946 - 00:05:13.460, Speaker A: I mean, I use arcade. I use arcade pretty, pretty recently. It is like pretty seamless and I feel like once you get over that first hump of fear, like, I could just lose this nft to like some fucking unknown risk, which is like, still can every time you do it. But like once you use it once and it works and everything's fine, I feel like it's a, it's a nice thing to use. I think arcade is like pretty, pretty solid.
00:05:14.400 - 00:05:18.544, Speaker B: I always, I always had fun lending and borrowing against nfts.
00:05:18.632 - 00:05:20.580, Speaker A: It was like, you used to do it a lot.
00:05:21.120 - 00:05:46.790, Speaker B: I did used to do it a lot because I enjoyed it. Like, I. You could get, it was like yield farming, but like, it wasn't. Like it was easier, I think. And it was more fun because there were jpegs involved. But once NfT started to go down, like, you didn't really want to be lent. Like, you would get defaults all the time and you would be left holding like a shitty NFT.
00:05:46.790 - 00:06:21.866, Speaker B: Whereas like, when I first started doing it, if you caught a default, you were like, happy you got something at like a 20, 30% discount. So like, it just became too, like risky and like, I guess it got harder, too, by that. By that measure, it's probably a lot easier now. I mean, it's probably worth looking back into. But at the same time, like, dude, those blur terms are insane. Like, the fact that you can and, like, that doesn't require that. Like, that's not as fun as NFT fire arcade at least using it, but, like, I'm still blown away by that.
00:06:21.866 - 00:06:38.590, Speaker B: The fact that you can, the fact that you can borrow against the malady, like, what is it, like 90% ltv for, like, 3% and just leave it open in perpetuity, that's fucking insane.
00:06:40.810 - 00:06:43.630, Speaker A: I was looking at the Abacus episode as well, too.
00:06:44.690 - 00:06:49.470, Speaker B: Oh, man. Rip applications didn't deserve it. They didn't deserve it, man.
00:06:49.770 - 00:06:55.430, Speaker A: There were, out of all, super smart. I hope he's up to something, like, interesting.
00:06:56.050 - 00:06:58.386, Speaker B: Hope he is, too. What's his name? Geo.
00:06:58.538 - 00:06:59.666, Speaker A: Geo, right.
00:06:59.858 - 00:07:09.710, Speaker B: Yeah. Geo, if you're watching this, I hope you're well, man. I hope you're still around because I know he, like, took some time off, and I don't even. I don't know if he ever even came back because that dude was definitely a genius.
00:07:10.220 - 00:07:19.764, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. He's very smart. Maybe pivoted into, like, AI or something. I hope not. Yeah. All right.
00:07:19.764 - 00:07:56.770, Speaker A: I think we're jumping a little bit of it already, but this was going to be my answer. But, like, we look back at 23, we'll let you, you know, you'll have the Solana kind of moment a bit later, but just from, like, not best performing, but your favorite narrative in crypto during 2023, most fun performed. Well, quantify how you want.
00:07:59.790 - 00:08:00.910, Speaker B: That's a good question.
00:08:01.030 - 00:08:11.250, Speaker A: If you had a bunch, I mean, I'll list them off while you think. I mean, there was, like, I mean, AI had a moment. There was a gamble fi, that had a moment.
00:08:12.510 - 00:08:20.422, Speaker B: Well, what's the cr. Are we just going off of most fun or, like, personal favorite? Like, personal favorite? Personal favorite?
00:08:20.446 - 00:08:23.010, Speaker A: Personal favorite. Opinionated.
00:08:23.830 - 00:08:48.180, Speaker B: I found not the meme coin narrative itself, but all of the tools around meme coining. I found that to be very interesting and, like, fun to explore. Like, you know that bot that I always send you? Like, the jeep bot? Like, that. That's, like, hilarious. And it was also, like, super useful. Like, I used baboon tools for a while. Like, there's obviously all the telegram bots.
00:08:48.180 - 00:09:29.850, Speaker B: I don't know. I found that because, like, it. I've always liked. I've always liked, like, analyzing on chain data and, like, being in those weeds, but I like, I'm not good at it. Like, I can use the tools that I'm given, but I, like, can't do much on my own, whereas, like, those tools allow you, like, allow you to break that barrier. Kind of, like, you can see, like, bubbles and, like, you can easily see, like, how top holders move and how, like, early holders have reacted and, you know, LP burns all that fun stuff. I thought that was really cool because it, like, allowed it kind of, like.
00:09:29.850 - 00:09:49.330, Speaker B: Like, when I found something like baboon tools. Yeah, when I found, like. Like, really powerful ones, like, baboon tools. Or, like, when the. When the snipers first started to come out and I, like, used banana for the first time, it, like. Like, it made you feel powerful if, like, you didn't know how to do that stuff before. So I found that to be really fun.
00:09:49.330 - 00:09:52.536, Speaker B: Personal favorite.
00:09:52.728 - 00:10:11.456, Speaker A: Do you think anything solid. I mean, like, they still exist? They're still around. I've seen unibot, like, moved to Solana. I saw a bunch of people went off, like, banana recently. There's, like, a few others still being worked on. Do you not. I don't want to give, like, the cheesy.
00:10:11.456 - 00:10:26.110, Speaker A: Like, do you think it makes a comeback? But you, like, what kind of pieces of it do you feel like were the most useful? Maybe, like, technologically advance the industry, if anything?
00:10:27.530 - 00:10:49.082, Speaker B: Not. Not in their current state. No, I think, like, long term, these tools go to zero. I think that what will, like, take their place, because, like, I think this is, like, a common. This is, like, a common view. Now, I was kind of late to this thesis, but, like, I totally believe in it now. And maybe.
00:10:49.082 - 00:11:52.500, Speaker B: I don't know if this started with Ansem, but he was definitely someone who popularized it, so I have to give him credit for once. Basically, meme coins are. You can think of meme coins as trading. Trading. Trading memes, but when you connect it to any sort of social media, like TikTok or whatever, and you allow people to bet on the success or failure of different trends and different memes, like, there's, like, there's very little reason to believe that that doesn't happen at some significant scale, and that stuff isn't gonna, like, you know, like, I have a hard time believing that we're gonna be doing that with, like. Like, we, as in crypto Twitter, are gonna be, like, sniping and, like, doing all. Using all these tools and doing all that cool, like, you know, mid curve shit to try and find the right stuff while, like, you know, the tech talkers and the normies are just punting, whatever.
00:11:52.500 - 00:12:37.730, Speaker B: I think that, I would like to think that they're like a level playing field or a more level playing field shows up at some point where like, obviously you can never really take power away from the insiders, but like, the whole sniping part of it and like, being able to front run and stuff like that, I think that a platform where you can trade means that doesn't have that in, that has outside of the initial team or the insiders, has more level ground for everyone involved. And that's just not unibot banana, maestro, all that stuff. It's great for what the meta is right now or what it has been, but I don't think it can continue to be that.
00:12:38.060 - 00:13:24.870, Speaker A: So the just, the meme landscape in general becomes more like, approachable in general because there are a few people at that time equitable. Yeah, that, like, no people that are out of the space that hear about a meme coin. It's like now they have to figure out what liquidity means. They buy, sell, tax. They have to figure out who the fucking insiders and cartel people are that are involved. Like, there's, yeah, there's so many layers, it's impossible for them to get kind of involved. But when you say, like, the playing field evens out, like, any idea how that happens? Like, how these kind of.
00:13:24.870 - 00:13:41.170, Speaker A: Yeah, how that, like, plays out? Like, I see your point where I do see that it kind of just ends up leveling out and becoming, like, easier for people to just pop meme coins without having to worry about, like, MeV slippage, all that kind of shit. Like, but how does that happen?
00:13:41.830 - 00:14:15.478, Speaker B: So get different ERc or, like, it's a good question. I don't really know. I mean, in theory, it shouldn't happen, like, from a tech perspective, right? You can't, you can't really have a chain without Mev. You can't really, I mean, you can't do a blockchain without having someone on the minute level who's able to reorder and front run transactions. Like, you know, beauty. You're not, no one's going to launch meme coins with, like, fair launch methods like lbps or something like that. You know, people like that.
00:14:15.478 - 00:14:49.304, Speaker B: It just fucking rips off. Launch. Yeah. I mean, it could. Now that I'm thinking about it, maybe that, like, future is more likely just because, like, unless you create, like, a permissioned chain of some kind with, like, with like, a whitelisted validator set of, like, some. And, like, that's not the solution anyone wants you know, you have to have too many permissions in place to do away with that stuff. So maybe the tools, maybe the tools in their current state are like more similar.
00:14:49.352 - 00:14:57.476, Speaker A: So that was your favorite, favorite narrative of last year? Meme coin tooling bots, maybe?
00:14:57.548 - 00:15:16.280, Speaker B: Actually, I haven't thought about it until you just ask me now. I mean, I got into this one late as well. But the, like, specifically the, like, asian systems AI stuff is really interesting. I still don't fully understand it, but.
00:15:17.660 - 00:15:19.568, Speaker A: The talents, I think all that kind.
00:15:19.584 - 00:15:54.590, Speaker B: Of stuff, like, well, some. I think some of the subnets on Tao do it. It's more like autonomous where, like, you have. You have, like different. You have like different agents, basically, which can be. Are some, like, set of software, some set of AI that has a goal in mind, a goal that's like set by its owner. And then you have like a controlled system where all of these, all of these agents work together to achieve some purpose or provide some service.
00:15:54.590 - 00:16:06.790, Speaker B: It's like super, it's one of those things that's like super general. You know, it's like the framework for a framework. So it's kind of hard to, like, contextualize.
00:16:07.210 - 00:16:14.000, Speaker A: So, like a way for. If you wanted an AI agent to snipe meme coins for you, basically.
00:16:16.420 - 00:17:09.812, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I guess. I guess you could do that. You could have, like. And the whole idea is that you have a system where there are multiple agents or there are multiple, like, AI's with different interests that are competing, but, like, they're competing with each other, but the whole, like, the whole of the system makes up the service in most cases. So, like, it's a good example. I don't know, maybe if you had, like, let's say you have like, some number, like five different agents who all, who all have, like, a different natural language model that is like, that's like, trained to specifically understand one type of speech versus another, and you use that. To use that to, like, scrape Twitter, scrape different social medias.
00:17:09.812 - 00:17:23.400, Speaker B: Maybe one's trained for TikTok and one's trained for Twitter, and you use them to come up with, like, scores for different meme coins on any given day. That's like, how. I think that's how something like that would work.
00:17:24.540 - 00:18:00.674, Speaker A: Yes. I'd say. I'd say my favorite, like, around 23 was probably like the NFT, just like trading in general, not the NFT five. It's because I hated it so much. I remember I would get angry with how left curve it was, and I was, like, trying to value them from, like, a mid curve perspective, and then there would be just, like, stupid shit that would, like, make me decent money, and I'm like, okay, like, I'm for 2023. Yeah, 15 minutes. Blur.
00:18:00.674 - 00:18:02.030, Speaker A: Like, what was the one?
00:18:03.650 - 00:18:09.950, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, it was. It was, yeah, like that. Yeah, the abstraction and the harvest and, like, the femme.
00:18:10.250 - 00:18:11.370, Speaker A: I remember I made, like.
00:18:11.410 - 00:18:11.990, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:13.570 - 00:18:15.242, Speaker A: For no fucking reason.
00:18:15.426 - 00:18:23.710, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, those things. And there was, like, those little fit. The fucking little, like, fish or, like, frog things that you really liked that did nothing.
00:18:24.130 - 00:18:30.230, Speaker A: Yeah, fabric. That was fabric. Do you remember feet pics?
00:18:30.970 - 00:18:31.802, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember.
00:18:31.906 - 00:18:34.950, Speaker A: Yeah. It was just so left.
00:18:35.770 - 00:18:36.898, Speaker B: It's a good one.
00:18:37.034 - 00:18:52.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I started, like, approaching it more of, like, fuck it. Like, if this shit is running up on the 15 minutes, I'm just gonna buy it. I'm not gonna figure out whether or not feed picks are valuable. Yeah, I think that's, like, helped. Helped me a lot.
00:18:53.260 - 00:18:55.240, Speaker B: Yeah, that was fun.
00:18:56.780 - 00:19:33.060, Speaker A: If you look at it from, like, performance, it's clear that, you know, Solana has won the year, basically 2023. This is where you can kind of give your thesis from last year and maybe could help people. You know, you can have your, like, winners circle moment, but just maybe, like, frame it in a way where you can look back on how you were thinking about it and how it could apply to, like, future. The future may talk about your conviction a little bit.
00:19:34.600 - 00:20:13.822, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess, like, the only thing that's changed about my conviction, and I wouldn't even use the word conviction, really, because it wasn't that strong. But the only thing that's changed over the past, like, six months or since Solana started pumping, is that I've gotten more. Not more bearish on eth, I think, just more realistic about it. And that, you know, naturally, if naturally, that, like, denotes that you will become more bullish on Solana. So I think that's kind of what happened. And I don't, like, I was never really like, but take us back.
00:20:13.886 - 00:20:22.390, Speaker A: Take us back when you. When you press that. By. When you were pressing that buy button. Because I remember you, like, the mad labs was a big purchase. I feel like.
00:20:22.470 - 00:20:23.090, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:23.750 - 00:20:34.890, Speaker A: And then you were DCA ing, I think I remember at the time, and I was dunking, hunking on you for DCA ing into Seoul. How I was.
00:20:36.660 - 00:20:51.800, Speaker B: So I was. I got. I got lucky because I was in. I was interested in Solana well, before, like, all the SVF stuff. Like, I first bought in, like, 2021. I first. I first started using Defi on Solana before I did ethereum so I just had like, a sweet spot for it.
00:20:51.800 - 00:21:20.230, Speaker B: I like, I think it's less about, like, it was less about me betting on a comeback. And it was more just the fact that, like, people were so quick to write it off. Like, it's, it was a new chain. Like Solana has been live for what, like four years. At the time, it was three. A new chain. Like a very vocal community and like, novel applications being built on the chain.
00:21:20.230 - 00:22:13.640, Speaker B: So like, deep end stuff on chain order books. That's like, it really, like, and that's enough because, because remember, like, there's not anything interesting being built anywhere else. You can't name one example of something interesting being built in public, at least on like, most l two s. And like, that's enough to not count it out. I think, like, people just, people are just so impatient and they were like, you know, despite all the good progress that's been made because of this big collapse with Sam, who like, yes, he had a significant hand, like, in the ecosystem at the time. Despite that, like, most of that stuff was flushed out and there was still a lot of genuine activity going on. As you can see now by all the different projects that are getting, that are getting attention.
00:22:13.640 - 00:22:32.250, Speaker B: There was just no reason to write it off that early. And some people might say, well, how does that make it different from Cardano or Phantom or some other scalable, some other, like, scalable l one? And it's a good question.
00:22:32.710 - 00:22:40.478, Speaker A: Is it the SVM? Like, is it that that makes it cool? Because it's like a different Vm?
00:22:40.534 - 00:23:15.836, Speaker B: Like, to me, the easy answer, which most people won't like, is it's the community. But it's true. But I know you don't like that answer, so I'll ignore that. Like, like, dude, if you use Solana, it is orders of magnitude more, more usable and faster than any other alt out one. Except for maybe the move chains. Now, the move chains haven't really been tested, so like, that in and of itself makes it a very, very attractive consumer.
00:23:15.868 - 00:23:20.518, Speaker A: You've never used avalanche, you've never used phantom? Like I used to use.
00:23:20.574 - 00:23:26.770, Speaker B: No avalanche. I've used phantom. I've used phantom fast. I haven't used that. They're not fat. There's not as fast as Solana.
00:23:28.270 - 00:23:29.510, Speaker A: Dude, the mind doesn't care.
00:23:29.550 - 00:23:30.806, Speaker B: Not as fast or as cheap.
00:23:30.878 - 00:23:36.126, Speaker A: What is Solana like? Solana is 0.4 milliseconds or something like that. What?
00:23:36.198 - 00:23:37.662, Speaker B: It's inconsequential.
00:23:37.846 - 00:23:43.118, Speaker A: 7.8. Like, the mind can't foreign decipher want.
00:23:43.134 - 00:24:12.064, Speaker B: To bantam has slowed down on situations before, and the same way that Solana has. Another big difference was that everybody was citing outages, right, all year, even during the pump, people were like, oh, it's going to go down eventually, and then, you know, the price is going to come back down. But, like, it takes literally, dude, the thing is, is I think, like, anyone can spend an hour, or anyone could have spent an hour to look into Solana and maybe, like, maybe you wouldn't come away bullish.
00:24:12.192 - 00:24:12.506, Speaker A: I.
00:24:12.568 - 00:24:26.730, Speaker B: But you, you would come to the conclusion that it shouldn't be written off yet, which is all, like, that's, like, all it takes. You know, that. Or that's all it took, at least for me. Um, what was I saying before that?
00:24:28.390 - 00:24:43.062, Speaker A: I want to ask you this. Let's, uh. I want. I forget. I feel like we have to say this since this is, like, going to be a predictions episode. Like, this is not financial advice. Nothing on this podcast is financial advice ever.
00:24:43.062 - 00:25:05.772, Speaker A: Any episode before or after this statement. I'm going to record something to put at the beginning. But, yeah, I want to talk more about. Fuck the price it pumped. They did a great job. 23 there's cool stuff being built on there. But I wanted to ask you this.
00:25:05.772 - 00:25:24.560, Speaker A: I think one of my things about Solana is I don't know if Anatoly is autistic enough to really be the leader of a chain. Like, I feel like Vitalik, dude, he's so level headed. Like.
00:25:24.900 - 00:25:28.620, Speaker B: Like, it's almost bearish how charitable he is.
00:25:28.780 - 00:25:45.136, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just too. It's just too normal. I feel like. I feel like he needs to be more like, of a, like, not like a wild card, like a do Kwan, but, like, I don't know. I don't know. That's. That's one of my qualms with Solana.
00:25:45.136 - 00:26:27.298, Speaker A: I feel like I'm sitting in the meme spot right now where the price went up, so the tech got better in my head, but I've just kind of, like, been like, okay, the apps are cool. I'm gonna start using the apps now, so haven't really done any, like, accumulating of the token Solana itself. I don't really know what to do. It's like, now I'm thinking of, like, okay, I'm gonna. If. If a community is all you need, a community fast chain and, like, four reply guys on Twitter and one kol to go crazy as an ecosystem. Like, well, that's unfair.
00:26:27.298 - 00:26:53.916, Speaker A: They are building cool projects on there. I will say you're right about that. That is probably the major aspect that I got wrong. I was always under the impression that no one was building anything on Solana because TVL was down and not moving. And I was like, if there was anything cool, then TVL would have went there. I think that's probably the biggest spot where I kind of like, shot myself foot. So I think if I look back.
00:26:53.948 - 00:27:21.186, Speaker B: On it, I think that no one really saw coming was also the fact that, like, Solana now, or at least like the past couple of months, has been rivaling Ethereum. And a lot of different metrics are outright beating it. And there hasn't been a single instance of downtime or outages like that. Like, you couldn't have seen that coming, obviously, but now that it's happened, that's enough reason to be like, like, shit like this is, this is.
00:27:21.258 - 00:27:31.442, Speaker A: I don't see it. I still don't see it. I think it's just different. I think it's just different. I think. I don't think it competes with Etherium, like, pretty much at all.
00:27:31.506 - 00:27:32.602, Speaker B: I don't think it does either.
00:27:32.666 - 00:27:33.898, Speaker A: I don't like two different things.
00:27:33.954 - 00:27:34.530, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:34.690 - 00:27:41.058, Speaker A: Because every game, every major gain that you make on Solana yourself, you bridge over so Ethereum so you can sleep.
00:27:41.114 - 00:27:43.526, Speaker B: No, that's not true. Not for me, at least.
00:27:43.698 - 00:27:44.502, Speaker A: Yes, it is.
00:27:44.566 - 00:28:11.572, Speaker B: No, it's not. No, it's not. Most of my Jito airdrop is still sitting on Solana. I think that I like. The thing is, you can't talk about Solana without comparing it back to Ethereum. No one will indulge that conversation unless you're comparing it back to Ethereum, which, like. And I still, I talk that way because it's easier and because it, like, opens the dialogue and because it's not possible to do so otherwise.
00:28:11.572 - 00:28:44.152, Speaker B: And I don't like that. Like they should. Like, they can coexist, they can. Solana can be the deep in AI like meme coin chain, while Ethereum has the payments, l three, the perp, Dexs, all the liquidity. Like, that's like a near term future that makes sense. Like, who knows how much they're going to diverge in the long term? But the problem is, is like, you know, Solana faces scalability problems a little bit. Like maybe they did like the pith airdrop and they had some problems then.
00:28:44.152 - 00:29:09.660, Speaker B: So you go and say, like, this is clearly not ready for, like, scalable payments infrastructure. And then Mert replies, and he goes, he goes, oh, but it's, but it's orders of magnitude better than Ethereum. It's like, that shouldn't be the benchmark. The benchmark should be, like, actual products, right? Like, why are we comparing back to something that charges $100 when more than five people decide they want to make a swap?
00:29:10.600 - 00:29:33.594, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, 100%. I think that's where I got stuck as well. Kind of like, if it's not going to be beating Ethereum and the things that I want it to be better at Ethereum, like, to beat Ethereum at, then it's just not worth anything. And I think that's where the mistakes were made. We got a lot to get through, and we're halfway through. Favorite.
00:29:33.594 - 00:29:37.190, Speaker A: Favorite meme from. From 2023.
00:29:38.610 - 00:29:41.626, Speaker B: Dude, I really liked. You go first.
00:29:41.818 - 00:29:45.010, Speaker A: Oh, I didn't have anything. I thought you were going to take a minute, so I was going to rip.
00:29:45.090 - 00:29:55.422, Speaker B: Oh, I don't. I don't have that much to. I mean, I don't have that much to get into, but I can tell you my favorite meme, which I actually don't even know how it's doing now. I was. I was really early to this one.
00:29:55.586 - 00:30:03.662, Speaker A: Not. Not meme coin. Oh, just. I mean, it can be a meme coin, but just, like, general meme has.
00:30:03.686 - 00:30:05.130, Speaker B: Been, like, a different answer.
00:30:05.990 - 00:30:07.250, Speaker A: Like, a moment.
00:30:08.150 - 00:30:09.862, Speaker B: Like, mine's probably yesterday.
00:30:09.966 - 00:30:15.238, Speaker A: Like, a meme. Oh, yeah, but that's 24 yesterday. That's 24.
00:30:15.414 - 00:30:52.442, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Oh, man. I thought that I don't have. I don't have one that sticks out to me, but when I like, some that come to mind is, like, when Azuki spent months hyping up a new drop, and it ended up being an exact copy of their original one and everything. Fucking nuked points is like, that's a pretty funny meme.
00:30:52.442 - 00:31:02.230, Speaker B: I think it's better now. It's less funny now because we're actually getting the tokens, but, like, three months ago, we had so many ongoing points programs and no tokens.
00:31:05.450 - 00:31:06.178, Speaker A: Yeah, man.
00:31:06.234 - 00:31:21.672, Speaker B: What has happened this past year? I need to go and watch. I need to go and watch interns like meme, the. Like, the. Didn't he post something that was, like, the years? Yeah, like, the years. Like, best memes, review, crypto year, and review.
00:31:21.856 - 00:31:50.480, Speaker A: I'd say, like, one of the funniest for me was. Well, I think that one of the best moments that are, like, me moments, I guess, was the. The elon, like, mulady post. I thought that was pretty cool. It's, like, very. I feel like you got to be deep in to the ecosystem to find a malady meme. And I thought that was solid for the ecosystem as a whole.
00:31:50.480 - 00:32:01.040, Speaker A: It was funny when Do Kwon got arrested and they found a ledger or something up his ass.
00:32:01.340 - 00:32:03.916, Speaker B: That was, that wasn't true.
00:32:04.068 - 00:32:07.380, Speaker A: There's no, then I'm pretty sure it was true.
00:32:07.460 - 00:32:17.204, Speaker B: How did you look up there? How did you know? There's no way. That's too, that's too comical. I know this is a joke.
00:32:17.252 - 00:32:23.324, Speaker A: What would you do if you were on the run? If you were on the run? I mean, maybe I wouldn't end up situation.
00:32:23.412 - 00:32:33.410, Speaker B: I need to keep a ledger in my butt to begin with. I would simply not start a multi billion dollar ponzi to begin with. That's what I would do.
00:32:33.710 - 00:32:35.038, Speaker A: But whether or not that was true.
00:32:35.054 - 00:32:36.410, Speaker B: No, I don't think that's true.
00:32:37.230 - 00:32:38.690, Speaker A: I think that was funny.
00:32:39.350 - 00:32:40.130, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:41.350 - 00:32:45.630, Speaker A: And just ETH as an asset was just a hilarious meme throughout the year.
00:32:45.750 - 00:33:08.048, Speaker B: I'd say, dude, I'm so, like, I'm so happy with the way that ETH has performed. I can't even lie because like, I've. And, well, maybe it's because I've been on Solana or because I like, had some big wins there, but I've accumulated so much more eth while it's still cheap, you know?
00:33:08.224 - 00:33:08.632, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:08.696 - 00:33:25.980, Speaker B: Versus if he had been catching up and had been at like 3000 by now, 3500 by now. Like, I would, I would probably be like, taking more profits and I would have been more sidelined throughout this whole thing. But because it's still down, I just go and buy eth when I want to take profits instead.
00:33:27.400 - 00:33:45.060, Speaker A: Yeah. Least favorite narrative from the 23 cycle. Kind of the one that your glide is dead or is maybe going to die. RWA, really? What do you include in RWA? Some people include stable coins, cross border payments.
00:33:46.920 - 00:34:44.502, Speaker B: Specifically. Specifically putting like, putting like, real estate and luxury goods on chain. Um, I don't hate the t bill stuff, but I don't think it's like I've, I just, you know, I, I don't hate it. I just think it's dumb. Like, like people not long ago, or, I mean, by now it was a while ago, people are posting, like, posting like, threads and videos about how, like, you can put your rolex on chain and then take out a loan against it trustlessly, as if, like, it's not being held in escrow by some, by someone, you know, like, it's, it doesn't really, it just seems like such an unnecessary component to add, like, a blockchain into that. I actually. This was one thing that I did see from our 2023 or from our episode a year ago.
00:34:44.502 - 00:34:57.716, Speaker B: Our first episode was that you asked about rwas as a narrative for the year. And I said no. I said, like, it's not ready. I don't think it's ready yet. And obviously, you know, like maker, the first episode. Cool stuff.
00:34:57.868 - 00:34:59.644, Speaker A: Yeah, Jesus.
00:34:59.772 - 00:35:20.798, Speaker B: Yeah, that was like, that was when you first. When I first learned, like, what maker was doing, because you mentioned it. Like, they're doing cool stuff. Like, I think Ando backed that stuff is like, you know, gonna be really big and bringing, and bringing institutions on chain. But for me, like, I don't, I don't really care.
00:35:20.934 - 00:35:30.798, Speaker A: Would you kyc for do KYC for RWA l three on arbitrary or on any other chain?
00:35:30.934 - 00:35:33.966, Speaker B: No. What would I get out of kycing? I would get to use it.
00:35:34.038 - 00:35:36.014, Speaker A: That would get points, baby points.
00:35:36.142 - 00:35:39.650, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have.
00:35:40.240 - 00:35:42.500, Speaker A: I would KYc for any point.
00:35:43.360 - 00:35:49.140, Speaker B: I would zk kyc I have. They're gonna call it for the linear quest.
00:35:50.600 - 00:35:51.700, Speaker A: Did you really?
00:35:52.560 - 00:36:14.448, Speaker B: Yeah, that's. I'm. I. Maybe. Maybe it's naive because I don't know how it actually works, but in theory, like, it should not reveal anything about, like, me. It should just show that I meet the requirements, which if that works, I'll do that anywhere pretty much, if it's needed. Yeah.
00:36:14.504 - 00:36:44.170, Speaker A: My least favorite narrative. I really. I still hate this BRC bitcoin ecosystem. One. And the thing is, I mean, as listeners who've been following along throughout the year know, if I hate something, you should probably like, long it or like, get exposure to it, but I really just don't like this shit. Like, I think it's like. Yeah, I mean, I think it's good for bitcoin, but I just.
00:36:44.170 - 00:36:45.910, Speaker A: I just hate it in general.
00:36:46.730 - 00:36:48.506, Speaker B: I don't think we hate the NFTs.
00:36:48.538 - 00:37:10.730, Speaker A: Are denominated in bitcoin. I hate that. Like, there's a million acronyms for every single, like, new form of the same token they create. I guess you can make the same complaints about, like, the ETH ecosystem and part of it is probably I'm just too lazy to, like, figure out what the fuck is going on over there. But, yeah, I'm just not a big fan in general.
00:37:12.390 - 00:37:19.850, Speaker B: And in five years, on what chain do you think the most expensive NFT will exist on?
00:37:21.230 - 00:37:26.706, Speaker A: In five? Yeah, most expensive. Are you like collection or one of.
00:37:26.738 - 00:37:34.750, Speaker B: One collection or like most. Yeah, most expensive slash, like most well known. It's usually the same thing.
00:37:37.330 - 00:37:40.618, Speaker A: Whatever new l one drops in five years.
00:37:40.754 - 00:37:41.074, Speaker B: Really?
00:37:41.122 - 00:37:44.282, Speaker A: Bunch of air drops tied to the major NFT on there.
00:37:44.426 - 00:37:48.630, Speaker B: You don't, you don't think it's going to be. I mean, what makes you think it's not going to be?
00:37:49.170 - 00:37:51.874, Speaker A: No, I think it'll be on Ethan. I think it'll be on.
00:37:51.922 - 00:38:04.550, Speaker B: It'll be on bitcoin. I think NFTs make more sense on bitcoin than NFTs as collectibles make more sense, make way more sense actually, on bitcoin than they do on Ethereum.
00:38:07.690 - 00:38:08.830, Speaker A: No, I disagree.
00:38:10.850 - 00:38:16.510, Speaker B: People trust bitcoin so much. Normal people trust bitcoin. Normal people don't trust Ethereum.
00:38:19.420 - 00:38:20.236, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't.
00:38:20.348 - 00:39:03.940, Speaker B: Like, if you want to, if you want to have, you want to have something that has like personal value to you that you like something like an NFT which like, you know, you take pride in owning, you can feel secure about. About having it. Like, I don't know, I just feel like it's so, it's so obvious that it will be on bitcoin at some point and I should probably be like, acting in favor of that because I've never done anything on bitcoin. Like literally never. I've not even like, use the regular, like, send and receive bitcoin on there. But I don't know, it just seems obvious to me.
00:39:05.040 - 00:39:36.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I see the point, but, yeah, no, I think. I think it's more because NFTs kind of originated on ethereum in a way. I think the. Yeah, I think it stays here. I think it stays on Eth for foreseeable future. Honestly, within five years I could still. I could still see it being punks, to be honest.
00:39:37.890 - 00:39:43.150, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's fair. I think.
00:39:46.050 - 00:40:03.250, Speaker A: The. Any like last comments on, on self. Self reflection for 2023 performance good or badeful?
00:40:04.500 - 00:40:36.982, Speaker B: I don't know. I feel like the let, like, it kind of sucks because when you look at like a year ago, bitcoin was at like, nobody wanted to be on risk in any type of way when in reality, like, that was by far the best time to be. To be taking. To be taking like medium term, longer term bets. There's stuff that was, that has like injective is up like 30 x from that dude. That's like an l one. They have like a sub billion dollar valuation.
00:40:36.982 - 00:41:28.180, Speaker B: Like it's, it's, it sucks now because like we don't have that luxury anymore and like, it's obvious now and that's obviously, why they're more expensive. But I think, like, the general, like, one thing that, like, I've learned and that, like, I need to do better next year is, like, don't. Don't hesitate to, like, look into stuff, because it takes pro, it takes, what, five minutes to figure out what something is. Like, someone sends you a ticker or Twitter page, whatever. It doesn't take that long to get, like, a super basic, like, high level view of what it is. And, like, if you had. Because I don't know, when you get to a certain point in the space, everything comes across your desk at some point, usually when it's still early, it's just there's reasons to not get into it.
00:41:28.180 - 00:41:45.340, Speaker B: But, like, you know, going back over the past year, there were so many things that I saw early that I just didn't look into because, like, I didn't make the time for it. And if I had done that, or, like, I think most people do.
00:41:45.800 - 00:41:53.440, Speaker A: Injective. You think if you saw injective early and actually did, like, the research into it, you would have made the call?
00:41:54.220 - 00:42:15.316, Speaker B: No, not injectable. Not injective. But if I had. If I had looked into mad lads more, I would have gotten a lot more mad lads. If I had looked into. If I'd looked into. Dude, if I looked into tensorians, I would have bought as many of those things as I could have.
00:42:15.316 - 00:42:33.028, Speaker B: Though that was such an obvious move in hindsight. All I knew about Tensor was that it was a platform I really liked and that they're doing an airdrop points program, and I knew they had an NFT collection. I had no idea that they would provide so many benefits and, like, airdrops and partnerships, but it was all right there. Yeah.
00:42:33.044 - 00:42:36.120, Speaker A: I don't know if there would have been anything that would have changed your mind on that.
00:42:37.540 - 00:42:38.640, Speaker B: On tensor.
00:42:39.580 - 00:42:56.342, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, knowing that there's. I mean, you had the thesis on bad lab mad lads being, like, a collection that receives a bunch of airdrops. I don't know, if you did have the mad lads one, you would have had the tensor one, too. Yeah, that's true.
00:42:56.486 - 00:43:25.150, Speaker B: Yeah. The thing is, I didn't, like, I knew. All I knew was that there's an NFT collection called the tensorians. I didn't know that only holders can generate ref links. I didn't know that they get a portion of all the volume generated as points every day. And, like, you know, the airdrop thing wasn't a pretty, like, you didn't have to make a leap of faith to get there. Like, it was kind of, it was kind of a given.
00:43:25.150 - 00:43:57.760, Speaker B: And those NFts were also pretty, pretty widely used. And, like, on CT on Solana back then, too. I just, you know, I just didn't bother, really, once I found that stuff out of it was when they were already at like 120 floor and I was like, fuck, like, this is so, like, why? All I needed to do is click on this page and I would have. I would have known, but, yeah, so I guess just like, just do more. Really, like, take the time.
00:43:59.500 - 00:44:47.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say same thing. I think making, like, a high level evaluation on the majority of things will be beneficial. Like, the more you do it. But I also think, like, I guess I need to have, like, I want to build, like, better conviction in the trades that I decide to make and then, yeah, I mean, not get to. Not get too deep into, like, any cults. I feel like I put off a bunch of other ecosystems by being deep in the east cult. I mean, yeah, that was pretty much major mistakes.
00:44:47.560 - 00:45:19.050, Speaker A: And I'd say just for what has worked in 23 is just stay on the left curve. Just stay on the left curve. Don't even. I mean, like, in a majority of situations, just stay on the left curve. This is my lessons from 23. Like, dabble in the right curve, but avoid the mid curve like the plague. What's crazy, you know, it's.
00:45:20.430 - 00:45:39.420, Speaker B: Our first episode was on January 4. Bitcoin is trading at 16 and a half k. Today it's at, like, our first podcast basically marked the bottom. And our one year anniversary is on the day that the ETF is probably gonna get approved.
00:45:40.840 - 00:45:52.170, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty funny. All right, 2024, we don't have much, much time left. Can you run over and. Or do you have a hard stop?
00:45:53.670 - 00:45:56.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I can run over. I'm just hungry.
00:45:57.310 - 00:46:28.158, Speaker A: So you're gonna have to start the best performing asset of 24. There's probably going to be a meme coin that outdoes everything throughout this year. But those aside. But, like, best, maybe like, entire ecosystem, you can frame this question however you want. Just. But, like, best performing thing in crypto, you can. You can basically break it down to, like, one ticker.
00:46:28.158 - 00:46:46.540, Speaker A: You can do one ecosystem, you could do one narrative, you could do one, whatever, but best performing. And again, the ladies. Nothing is financial advice. Nothing in this show is financial advice. Okay, go. You said milady's.
00:46:46.840 - 00:46:57.900, Speaker B: I said that as a joke, but, like, also not as a joke because, well, I mean, they're bound to come back at some point. Right? Like, it's milady's. You can't.
00:46:58.200 - 00:47:06.960, Speaker A: Maybe we pick one from each narrative itself. So you pick one, like, nft one also one. One perp stacks.
00:47:07.000 - 00:47:07.664, Speaker B: Okay.
00:47:07.832 - 00:47:08.936, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do that.
00:47:09.048 - 00:47:09.504, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:09.592 - 00:47:10.460, Speaker A: Start work.
00:47:12.280 - 00:47:22.616, Speaker B: NFT could be just like one of the top in general, too. Or milady's could be one of the top in general, too, because they're denominator in Ethan Eth is going to go to, you know, a k. So.
00:47:22.808 - 00:47:29.168, Speaker A: No, no, no. That is high. Like it's return on us dollars.
00:47:29.224 - 00:47:29.900, Speaker B: I mean.
00:47:31.400 - 00:47:35.740, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair. I mean, I guess it plays into the narrative. Whatever chain. It's on the.
00:47:36.190 - 00:47:37.654, Speaker B: Yeah, whatever.
00:47:37.742 - 00:47:52.358, Speaker A: Some ladies. NFT. I want to go off a limb. Wait, let me do nft for nft. I'm going to go on a limb that probably shouldn't. I don't have. I don't have one.
00:47:52.358 - 00:48:26.420, Speaker A: But I do want to say the bad kids, really, I think there's going to be an infinite supply of, like, cosmos. Cosmos stuff going on this year. I think they're all going to be mediocre. I think they're all going to slightly be like, very shit. But I don't love the cosmos ecosystem. But I do think there is going to be a lot of cosmos chains that are going to be air dropping this year.
00:48:28.280 - 00:49:03.810, Speaker B: Well, the thing is that bad kids are like, they were around and within, within the Cosmos bubble. They were just as big as they are now. Like, they're just now getting more recognition outside of that. And they, you know, they didn't get. There was like a Cosmos airdrops moment last, last cycle, but it was mostly for stakers and there was, like, not many. There was, like three good ones, maybe. I also, this is, like, tangentially related, but I think the airdrop stuff is starting to reach peak euphoria.
00:49:03.810 - 00:49:29.360, Speaker B: I think people are expecting too much from that. I think that most of, like, if you haven't already started for a lot of the stuff, then, like, it might be too late. I don't know what to tell you or it's just not worth. It's not that it's too late. It's just probably not worth a. Your time, you know? Airdrops are going to start to get diluted more. Cybill filtering is going to be a bitch.
00:49:29.360 - 00:50:01.490, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I just don't think that hype can keep up. Like, people can't just keep giving away all this money. They will, obviously, at first. And, like, the people like me who have been farming for the past year are going to. Are going to win because of it. But, like, you know, don't go and setting up a whole airdrop farming operation right now because you're probably gonna lose money on it or you won't make that much, I think. But, um.
00:50:01.490 - 00:50:15.610, Speaker B: Yeah, that. That's an interesting one. I'm surprised to hear you say bad kids. That definitely. I just listed one of mine, actually. I don't think it's sold yet, but I listed it pretty high. I listed it pretty, like 30% above the floor or something like that.
00:50:16.150 - 00:50:38.210, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think those. I think those will cook. And I think other ecosystems, like, I do think there's a world where if you're. If you're a wormhole, if you're a layered layer zero, like, maybe you. Those are who you airdrop to. There's the people in that airdrop, too.
00:50:39.630 - 00:50:53.540, Speaker B: And there's a celestia airdrops, too. Could. Could easily go. I think I got celestia for having my bad kids. I don't remember. I definitely got dimension. Yeah.
00:50:53.540 - 00:50:55.352, Speaker B: The next one.
00:50:55.376 - 00:51:01.160, Speaker A: Alt l one s. Alt l one s. Or you can just go with l one eth.
00:51:01.200 - 00:51:17.560, Speaker B: Or, I mean, what do we. What is. What is Monad worth right now within this hypothetical scenario? Because, like, that's a pretty, like, Monad ceiling right now, which is not, like, a ridiculous.
00:51:17.720 - 00:51:18.660, Speaker A: Just, uh.
00:51:21.560 - 00:51:25.048, Speaker B: Let'S say we're pretending it's, like, equal to say right now.
00:51:25.224 - 00:51:28.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, then, Monad, what's the evaluation?
00:51:28.960 - 00:51:55.770, Speaker B: Monad, uh, market cap is. Is under a billion fdv. Oh, I know it's one. It's 1.5 billion now. FTV is just under seven. I think Monad is the only alt l one that has a 2021 Solana ceiling, which means 100 mil fdv, or, sorry, 100 bill fdv.
00:51:55.770 - 00:52:21.500, Speaker B: You know, like, rampant activity and some in whatever niche takes off there in Solana, it was NFts and some defi, whatever it ends up being from monadental. I think that's their. That's like, that's their. That's their ceiling. And it's not out of the realm of possibility. I think it's out of the realm of possibility for, like, say, or apdos or sweat, at least in this cycle. I think it is.
00:52:21.500 - 00:52:24.620, Speaker B: Whereas Monad could get there.
00:52:28.120 - 00:52:51.480, Speaker A: That's a good one. I'll go. I'll go barachine. I'll go baritone. I think bear chain is going to perform well. I do kind of want to say, like, I want to give. I want to give these, like, sweet, aptos all those.
00:52:51.480 - 00:53:04.930, Speaker A: I do want to give those, like, a deeper look. I feel I haven't given them a fair chance, but I will say, I will say bear chain. I think, you know what's funny is you do a lot of. Did I really?
00:53:05.390 - 00:53:15.050, Speaker B: And then, yeah, in the first episode, you said that you were like, I remember you were like, you're like, I just have a feeling like it's going to do good. And we're a year later and they hadn't launched yet.
00:53:15.950 - 00:53:20.814, Speaker A: I mean, the bit bear. The bit bear trade was solid. I haven't finished it yet.
00:53:20.862 - 00:53:22.566, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. That's true.
00:53:22.678 - 00:54:09.866, Speaker A: But no, I do think, I mean, I'm going to say this right now. If anyone from that ecosystem is listening, if Bear chain doesn't launch this year, like, I'm going to find Smokey and D mask him in the public. If it doesn't last, if it doesn't launch this year, I'm going to be pretty pissed. There's no way they can just keep doing this beyond that. Like, they've gotten their pie eaten, like, from all angles, basically. Like, they were the basically biggest, or like, most loud community before Monad.
00:54:09.898 - 00:54:14.018, Speaker B: They're definitely the biggest unlaunched chain. Yeah, for a while at least.
00:54:14.194 - 00:54:15.050, Speaker A: They lost that.
00:54:15.090 - 00:54:23.052, Speaker B: They're not even that. And they haven't launched. Yeah, I don't have a super strong opinion on bear chain.
00:54:23.156 - 00:54:26.440, Speaker A: Because you sold your bear.
00:54:27.620 - 00:54:57.974, Speaker B: Well, I'm going to buy back in for lower and for a higher for. I'm going to get a ban bear with baby bear instead, probably. But the two things that you and I can look at is ecosystem and community. Ecosystem. There's not a ton to glean off of for bear chain, but community obviously is super strong. I just think, like, it's, it's, you know, it's wavered since the beginning of the year. It's still there, but, like, it's.
00:54:57.974 - 00:55:29.240, Speaker B: It's not as compelling as it was before, especially now that. Now that Monad is in the picture and now that, you know, Celestia has launched as well, and there's, like, another. There's, like, more modularity coming into the picture. I hope they do well because I know they have, like, a heavy defi emphasis, and I would really like to see some, like, novel defi projects with that tri token model, but, you know, that's yet to be seen.
00:55:32.140 - 00:55:37.694, Speaker A: What would you consider Eigen layer as Eigen layer's infrastructure?
00:55:37.862 - 00:56:04.310, Speaker B: I would say Eigen layer falls into the same category as, like, well, it's in its own category. I think if you want to nitpick, but if you have to put it into some bucket, I would say it goes. It goes into the category of, like, flashbots. And I guess that. I guess the l two s could fall into that category, too. But then, you know, l two s have their own, like, their own bubble.
00:56:05.450 - 00:56:37.260, Speaker A: I just realized that they're going to start giving, like, they're going to change up the way cosmos or, like. Yeah, cosmos layer. Basically, like, tendermint chains, like, create security. Apparently, it's usually been just, like, get to a certain amount of token value and market cap so that you're the people staking your token can have, like, can create some, like, security on it. Oh, I forgot. I have a fucking hard stuff. Shit.
00:56:37.260 - 00:57:01.440, Speaker A: I asked you and didn't even check my own shit. Okay, speed run for the next, like, 60 seconds. What else did we have? L1. Just assets you want to throw out in general, to shoot from the hit. We're gonna have to watch this. Back in a year.
00:57:02.140 - 00:57:19.068, Speaker B: I'm still. I'm still a pendle bull. A year later, still a pendle. I still think that that will be one of the top Defi projects. Perp dexs. One of the perp Dex picks.
00:57:19.244 - 00:57:25.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Best perp Dex. You're the perpetex, like. Like, champion.
00:57:25.780 - 00:57:47.440, Speaker B: Yeah, but there's. I just don't know anything about that space, dude. There's so much I like, you know, how, like, once you learn enough about a topic, you realize, like, how little you know, and then eventually you start to build that back up. I haven't crossed that chasm yet. Like, I've gotten to the point where I know. I know nothing. But I haven't, like, rebuilt after that.
00:57:47.440 - 00:57:55.712, Speaker B: So, like, I'm just in this state of, like, decision paralysis. Like, dy. DX has always been the obvious answer.
00:57:55.816 - 00:58:03.100, Speaker A: Maybe I'm going to say rabbit x.
00:58:03.720 - 00:58:05.300, Speaker B: I know you're going to say that.
00:58:05.720 - 00:58:09.064, Speaker A: Just because I need to believe in.
00:58:09.072 - 00:58:15.116, Speaker B: The bunny, I don't think options happens this. This year. I'm gonna. I'm gonna put that out there.
00:58:15.308 - 00:58:19.960, Speaker A: Dude. I've been in this game for a while, and I still could care less about options.
00:58:21.180 - 00:58:24.884, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. It's a shame. I like options. They're fun.
00:58:25.052 - 00:58:25.964, Speaker A: Perks are more fun.
00:58:26.012 - 00:58:27.120, Speaker B: Enjoy using them.
00:58:27.660 - 00:58:29.172, Speaker A: Options will never be as.
00:58:29.316 - 00:58:36.560, Speaker B: It depends. It depends on who you are. It depends on what kind of mood you're in. Sometimes I'll trade options just because I feel like it.
00:58:42.670 - 00:58:46.930, Speaker A: Anything you want to see die in 2023, anything you want to see left behind.
00:58:50.990 - 00:59:04.750, Speaker B: Immaturity and scamming vaporware. The obvious answer is I feel like anyone who's not honestly trying to build something, like, of value.
00:59:07.010 - 00:59:49.676, Speaker A: I'd say the meta of still creating forks, even when there's three other forks. I think we should like, just create like a social layer of like, caps, like, socially, as a. As a community. Once we see like a third fork with only like minor tweaks, we should just like, kill whoever tries to make a fourth one. I also think Mav Maverick is going to be great. I think if it's easy enough for me to use and understand levels of playing field for LP's, I think they're going to be great. I think, yeah, I think they're going to be a great, great project.
00:59:49.676 - 01:00:01.030, Speaker A: I can see the asset outperforming pretty well. I think people are going to build some like, cool shit on top of it. Um, I don't know if I like their tokenomics yet, so we'll see.
01:00:01.110 - 01:00:03.250, Speaker B: Well, then you think they need to launch them already?
01:00:05.070 - 01:00:06.970, Speaker A: Didn't they already drop ve math?
01:00:08.190 - 01:00:09.502, Speaker B: Well, they, they announced it.
01:00:09.526 - 01:00:11.290, Speaker A: They must have dropped it with it.
01:00:12.030 - 01:00:23.342, Speaker B: Not yet, no. It comes with the second airdrop. It's. It's the. It's announced, but it's not being used, I think, at least in a long time.
01:00:23.446 - 01:00:36.490, Speaker A: So. So now what are we just longing every, um. Eth. Is it eth this year? Is it. Is it the year of Ethereum? Do you think there's gonna be a ETF this year?
01:00:38.470 - 01:00:41.350, Speaker B: Oh, that's, that's a good question that I do not have.
01:00:41.390 - 01:00:59.120, Speaker A: I'm gonna say yes. And price prediction for Ethereum for this year? I'm gonna say like a solid, solid eight k. Six. Oh shit.
01:00:59.980 - 01:01:01.080, Speaker B: In a year.
01:01:01.780 - 01:01:15.000, Speaker A: Yeah, solid eight k. By the end of the year, too many people on Solana are going to be left sideline. They don't have enough ethereum. I feel like a lot of people wake up every day and realize they don't have enough ethereum.
01:01:16.940 - 01:01:18.560, Speaker B: Most days and think that.
01:01:19.320 - 01:01:41.880, Speaker A: And what else? I think that's it. Okay. I really wish I didn't have this hard sub anyways. I think that covers everything. Gonna be a good year. Gonna be a very, very good year. Oh, you want to set some number goals for, for the podcast this year? I was talking to a friend of mine and he asked me that.
01:01:41.880 - 01:01:43.180, Speaker A: I didn't have any idea.
01:01:45.930 - 01:01:52.990, Speaker B: I guess we could. Should we do this live where we are right now? Yeah, 1354.
01:01:53.490 - 01:02:00.310, Speaker A: Well, we made YouTube. I want to say we need 20k YouTube, I think.
01:02:01.010 - 01:02:06.618, Speaker B: 20 can YouTube, I think. Yeah, I think with the clips, that's achievable. With the clips, that's definitely clips.
01:02:06.754 - 01:02:08.458, Speaker A: Shout out to. Shout out to.
01:02:08.594 - 01:02:09.662, Speaker B: Changes everything.
01:02:09.826 - 01:02:12.530, Speaker A: Fucking how many.
01:02:13.070 - 01:02:16.130, Speaker B: You gotta give me the login for that. I want to start tracking analytics.
01:02:17.910 - 01:02:26.046, Speaker A: Wait, a hundred percent? New viewers? Like, new viewers on that clip and that's crazy. And none of them subscribe. That's still.
01:02:26.078 - 01:02:27.182, Speaker B: That's still a good start, though.
01:02:27.206 - 01:02:28.614, Speaker A: It's a very good start.
01:02:28.662 - 01:02:31.606, Speaker B: We'll start showing up on their feed. More Twitter.
01:02:31.678 - 01:02:59.162, Speaker A: I mean, I honestly could care less. I think it's inevitable for us on Twitter. I don't want to set, like, a solid number, but, yeah, I want some more TikTok guys in here. To be honest, though, that's. It sounds really bad to say, but I think getting. Saving some of the tick tock lads from, like, being XRP demons and falling for. For dumb shit is gonna be good.
01:02:59.162 - 01:03:06.858, Speaker A: I want, like, 50k on. On TikTok 5100. Jesus. Then we'll be good.
01:03:07.034 - 01:03:13.230, Speaker B: I don't even know I had a TikTok, actually. That's all I did. I just don't. I just have never checked it once.
01:03:14.250 - 01:03:25.130, Speaker A: All right, I think that that does it. I got a bounce. See ya. Oh, shit. I almost didn't end the stream, which is a lot.
