00:00:02.240 - 00:00:54.880, Speaker A: Yeah, we definitely do want to work more on NFT fi integrations and essentially providing cross chain liquidity as a service to all the different platforms that might want to use it. One good example is a cross chain vault with insert finance. So what we want to do is like cross chain between ETH and arbitram, where essentially, like the JPEG remains on ETH, it never leaves ethan, it earns yield on ETH, et cetera, et cetera. But you can get exposure to that JPEG natively on another chain, right? So I think yeah, this use cases like this are pretty interesting to explore, and we also talked to guys from protect xyz. But yeah, although Omniex doesn't offer any technically NFT Fi products on its own, we are highly compatible with any other existing solution there, and I am looking forward to exploring more of those use cases in the future.
