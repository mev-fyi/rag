00:00:00.440 - 00:00:39.990, Speaker A: One thing that I think has been really interesting to watch is Milady's market because it has been extremely volatile at different points over the last couple months especially. We had one user make, I think it was like 315 or so percent buying some maladies options. We also had several users during down periods earn money writing these options on their millennies and then rewriting options. And then now with a recent run, we have some options settled today that should expire in the money, where users will make a similar two to 300% gain when they might have been making like a 50% to 75% gain if they had just bought Milady's.
