00:00:00.160 - 00:00:15.942, Speaker A: Like, am I going to expect, like, normies to hold, like, curve tokens or, like, ve curve tokens? Like, I don't know. My defi heart has, like, left for a bit. And I'm just so, like, what's your conviction? Where does your conviction come from? There.
00:00:16.046 - 00:00:46.490, Speaker B: I think, to be honest, I do appreciate the kind of sentiment around that, because you're absolutely right. Like, I don't expect normies to be holding curve either. But kind of all the value that kind of curve creates and all the other kind of hundreds and or thousands of applications, it all kind of roots through to Ethereum. And so ultimately, my thesis is really because I think Defi is going to do well. I think Ethereum will do well. And so the majority of my allocation is going to be towards things like Ethereum anyway.
