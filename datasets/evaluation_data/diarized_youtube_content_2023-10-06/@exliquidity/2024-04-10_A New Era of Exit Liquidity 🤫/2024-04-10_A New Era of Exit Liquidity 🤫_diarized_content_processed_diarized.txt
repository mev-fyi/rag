00:01:34.900 - 00:01:57.506, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. The way that I'm driving this race, they about to put me on suicide watch. Can't choose what color I'm feeling today. Thank God it's a two tone watch. Hell, like what I'm doing, he probably will say it. Never do somebody.
00:01:57.506 - 00:02:00.834, Speaker A: My big brother, like Marshawn lynch. He'll run through somebody.
00:02:00.962 - 00:02:01.362, Speaker B: Shita.
00:02:01.386 - 00:02:12.546, Speaker A: Caught me on a bad day. Hulk so perfect, it ruled my headspace. The driver go straight to the staircase. How could I ever be late to the airplane? These japanese garments is handmade. Whole body covered in shit. That I can't say. I take the bed to the fast lane.
00:02:12.546 - 00:02:27.702, Speaker A: I cannot help it to something like Batman, but he can go ahead and crash out soon as he find me. Let's see how it pan out. This challenge is tearing up ass, but I pop on the track, so I'm wrapping my ass off. He don't do number that tough on cameras. I probably could share what I care about. I'm just afraid that you won't understand it.
00:02:27.726 - 00:02:28.730, Speaker C: Me and surprise.
00:03:01.210 - 00:03:02.150, Speaker B: All right.
00:03:05.450 - 00:03:07.230, Speaker C: I'm never gonna get tired of that.
00:03:07.890 - 00:03:19.760, Speaker B: Shout out to Patty. Patty, great work there. Um, I don't know if she watches, but maybe someday, uh, exaliquity episode. Man.
00:03:19.800 - 00:03:27.208, Speaker C: I think we've gotten the episode number. I think we've gotten the episode number wrong for, like, the past five episodes. I have no idea what episode number this is.
00:03:27.264 - 00:03:33.100, Speaker B: We're gonna call it 69 because this is our rebrand episode, so we can be 69 moving forward.
00:03:34.040 - 00:03:38.340, Speaker C: Whoa, you're good. No, you're good.
00:03:38.930 - 00:03:40.310, Speaker B: Episode 69.
00:03:41.450 - 00:03:42.550, Speaker C: We'll go with that.
00:03:43.330 - 00:04:02.746, Speaker B: Yeah. The last time we did, like, a solo episode, we did, like, a re intro thing. I remember, like, we did backgrounds on us again. I don't really want to do that again. But how did we used to do these things? I feel like I used to just talk about my bags, which is, like, fine, I'm happy to do that, but.
00:04:02.778 - 00:04:05.440, Speaker C: Um, yeah, we haven't done these in a while.
00:04:10.020 - 00:04:13.840, Speaker B: I'm upset about the tensor airdrop, I'll be honest.
00:04:14.300 - 00:04:16.084, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, we can talk about that.
00:04:16.252 - 00:04:38.166, Speaker B: I I got. I got. I got paid for it. I did get paid for it, but I thought it was going to be one of my seven plays, you know? Like, you only need seven plays to make it. It's like, so far, it's been Luna Costco. I thought number four is going to be a cosh. I could put a.
00:04:38.166 - 00:04:52.934, Speaker B: Yeah, you could put a cosh there. But if you put a cosh there, then, like, we have to go and put like, pendle there probably. Like, we probably put bitcoin puppets there, too. Or, like. Yeah, you know, I think, like, mindset wise, you know, it was just those three. And I thought.
00:04:53.102 - 00:04:58.650, Speaker C: Were you expecting, like, a. I was expecting six figures. Really?
00:04:59.030 - 00:05:06.090, Speaker B: Or. Okay. Okay. I was expecting, like, mid five. Yeah. Like 60, 70, something like that.
00:05:06.550 - 00:05:08.930, Speaker C: Not for me, but for you, definitely.
00:05:09.870 - 00:05:14.126, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I. Like, the thing is, is I did.
00:05:14.198 - 00:05:16.342, Speaker C: Expecting, like, at least ten, to be honest.
00:05:16.446 - 00:05:35.080, Speaker B: I was spreading my farming across different wallets, and then I bought the tensorian, and then I was like, oh, I should just do all my farming on this wallet now because I get the boost. Like, I can get a really high rank. I'm getting points on this already. And that was, like, literally the worst decision to make in hindsight. Like, they totally did not.
00:05:35.620 - 00:05:45.756, Speaker C: Like, so did the math check out? Like, was it just. If you just made a bunch of wallets and did, like, half a soul and volume or. Or five soul volume wasn't.
00:05:45.828 - 00:06:02.310, Speaker B: I know. I know someone. I know someone who did half a soul and got 424 2010, sir. I don't know. Like, I don't think it was that many trades. Maybe, like, a trade or two. So that's, you know, right now that's, like, $800.
00:06:02.310 - 00:06:13.730, Speaker B: So you do that ten times over, and you do that, what? Like, probably, like, 30 times over, and you would have beaten all the, like, dozens of soul that I burned. So.
00:06:15.630 - 00:06:19.046, Speaker C: Tough one. Take it to the chin onto the next.
00:06:19.158 - 00:06:21.810, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, who knows?
00:06:22.270 - 00:06:47.458, Speaker C: I'll seed a little bit of hopium. Like, I. And I think this is why Ilya talked about it. But there has to be something with these. Like, make a new. Like, basically making liquidity platforms for different kinds of NFTs on top of tensor. Like, I mean, I think the playbook is clear.
00:06:47.458 - 00:07:05.470, Speaker C: Like, people make the tensor to blur comparison. And so if they keep following that trajectory, the inevitable thing is, like, a Solana l two or something. I think hopefully that will save us.
00:07:06.970 - 00:07:08.910, Speaker B: I think there is a little. There is a little.
00:07:11.280 - 00:07:16.780, Speaker C: Isn't. Isn't the. Isn't it, like, now we make an l two, and then everything starts working again.
00:07:17.400 - 00:07:30.020, Speaker B: I mean, grass is making an l two. I don't think it's that, like, fire dancer is supposed to be a huge deal, female localized, as they should be. I don't know when it's coming, but it's supposed to be, like, game changing.
00:07:30.600 - 00:07:51.880, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I don't understand. I thought they had, like, a breakdown for, like, to stop this congestion. So if there's like a huge nft mint. It would be, like, localized into one place. Now it seems like everything is flooded. As the resident Solana guy, what's the problem?
00:07:52.500 - 00:08:23.930, Speaker B: I was under the impression that fear markets were localized to some extent as well. But I don't know how distinct that is. And I don't know how, like, I know it's a part of the roadmap. I don't know how integrated it is already. So, like, tough for me to answer. But in theory, like, in theory, the end goal is, like, one day, if you have an airdrop where, like, 2 billion people have to claim it, those 2 billion people can go and they can clog their own little part of the network. But, like, I can also go still and trade nfts if I want to, with no problem.
00:08:23.930 - 00:08:38.300, Speaker B: Like, I think that's the whole, that's the whole, like, fee market pitch. I mean, it sounds cool. It makes sense. Like, it would be nice rather than having to go to l two s. I hope that doesn't become the solution, but.
00:08:41.680 - 00:09:38.460, Speaker C: Oh, all his connection is shaky. But, yeah, I mean, I do think it's gonna end up being the solution. I think the, the grass team is smart enough and is working close enough with the Solana foundation that the decision for an l two wasn't one that was, like, just easy or, like, not thought through. I think, like, they kind of saw some of this stuff boiling up around that time, some of the problems. And if grass came in and just threw everything on Solana, whatever they're putting on chain, they threw all of that on Solana. Even, like, a few months ago, when this wasn't really a problem, it would have broke. So I think.
00:09:38.460 - 00:09:51.760, Speaker C: I think it was, like, a problem that was recognized and, like, l two was decided upon as a solution. I think it's going to be a trend, honestly, because who else is supposed to launch some, like, AI. Deepen deep in shit on Solana? Is it, like, Ionet?
00:09:52.380 - 00:10:05.212, Speaker B: Plenty. Plenty of people? I mean, yeah, there's already plenty of that stuff on there. But I don't. That can't just be the solution, right? Just l two. And how funny would it be, though? I just, I just don't want that to be the case, you know?
00:10:05.276 - 00:10:30.190, Speaker C: Yeah, but I feel like you don't, like, people don't see that happening because it would almost be, like, anatoly would have to, like, put, like, the very little ego he has. He would have to put that aside and be like, okay, we need l two, and that's what everyone's banking on because he said they just know. Yeah, I know. But, like, I feel like l two s are his, like, line. Like he's been the last.
00:10:30.230 - 00:10:31.286, Speaker B: Like, I don't really.
00:10:31.438 - 00:10:35.850, Speaker C: L two s as a solution. I feel like he wouldn't, I don't cave into that.
00:10:37.230 - 00:10:58.406, Speaker B: I don't see him that often on Twitter anymore. I think just because he's like, not that controversial, because it's like he just says, like, well backed things and. Yeah, that too. Oh, he hasn't really been tweeting about it that much. Not in the past couple days. I don't think the tweet went out, by the way, for the episode. Just a heads up.
00:10:58.406 - 00:11:06.654, Speaker B: I just see the promo. Yeah, I hope not. I certainly hope l two s aren't the solution.
00:11:06.782 - 00:11:09.182, Speaker C: Oh, it just loaded 5 seconds ago.
00:11:09.246 - 00:11:10.014, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:11:10.142 - 00:11:10.926, Speaker C: Sweet.
00:11:11.078 - 00:11:46.310, Speaker B: And I will say that tensor, there was like some alpha in their foundation website that most people didn't notice. There's a section in the docs that says tensor protocols, and it has them listed as tensor marketplace, tensor amm, tensor price lock, tensor escrow, and tensor whitelist. So, like, you remember when we had him on and he was talking about, like, tensor being a base layer and then, like, protocols building on top of that layer? Yeah, clearly, like, stepping towards that now. I feel like that wasn't as clear before now. Right now it's getting clearer.
00:11:47.410 - 00:11:54.282, Speaker C: Yeah. But when he, when he pitched it, it was more like NFT centric protocols, which I don't really see the demand for.
00:11:54.346 - 00:12:02.586, Speaker B: Right, right. Yeah, yeah. I want nfts to make a comeback, dude. I. Yeah, I like nfts.
00:12:02.618 - 00:12:24.280, Speaker C: I have a buddy of mine who's. It's funny, like, I feel like people been saying pfps will die, like, very quickly for like, the longest time. And I still have, like, new people that are shit coining or scalping random shit for the first time in the last few months that are sitting on Twitter and they're like, okay, like, help me find a PFP, which I thought was interesting.
00:12:25.100 - 00:12:28.680, Speaker B: Pfps are kind of dead. Like, price wise. They are kind of dead.
00:12:29.460 - 00:12:33.430, Speaker C: Yeah. I couldn't think of anything other than, like, a malady ecosystem.
00:12:33.890 - 00:12:34.910, Speaker B: Apologies.
00:12:36.610 - 00:12:42.510, Speaker C: Yeah. But, like, for someone that's versus one in a different kind of tax bracket.
00:12:44.890 - 00:12:50.778, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I guess that's. I guess that's the ordinals thesis, right? Like, it's not going to be.
00:12:50.834 - 00:12:57.350, Speaker C: I told him, I told him if he could figure out how to buy an ordinal, I'd give him, like, basically the money for the ordinal.
00:12:57.740 - 00:13:03.124, Speaker B: But even. Or like, people are priced out of ordinals as is. Like, like.
00:13:03.172 - 00:13:24.190, Speaker C: Yeah, like, yeah, there's like a few, uh, few shitter ones. Um, but yeah, Tencher has gone. I mean, I'll still backhaul, to be honest. Um, I think Chris. Chris Berninski is going to save us. Uh, what else?
00:13:24.270 - 00:13:29.530, Speaker B: Still a good team, still strong product. Nothing is going to change that.
00:13:31.430 - 00:13:43.210, Speaker C: Yeah. Is, uh. Wait, I was going to ask this. Do you farm any like blast gold stuff other than like, assuming you're using Nft perp?
00:13:43.830 - 00:14:09.170, Speaker B: I'm actually not. I mean, I did, I did. Like, I played around with it and like, I. I will try stuff out. Like, I'll test stuff out. But I'm not like, farming gold anywhere. Gold, when gold first dropped, it was worth, I think it was worth like $25 a piece on the whales market price.
00:14:09.170 - 00:14:27.270, Speaker B: And they dropped at that valuation, it was like half a billion dollars worth of gold. I don't know how much it is now, but I saw it as low as $2. I think by the time TG happens, gold is going to be like less than $0.25.
00:14:28.410 - 00:14:29.150, Speaker C: Really?
00:14:29.730 - 00:15:16.992, Speaker B: Like, it's fun now, it's exciting now. It's obviously, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong, but the way that, the way that stuff has always worked in the past or been profitable for the protocol or for the chain in the past is you dilute your newer users or your later users or your users that leave early and you reward your longer term users. You offer multipliers, you offer greater rewards if you've been around longer. Um, you just let whales stack. Doesn't even need to be whales necessarily, just people who've been earning for a while. Um, and, like, at that.
00:15:16.992 - 00:15:21.900, Speaker B: At that. Like, if you don't have like a good solid chunk of gold by time.
00:15:24.040 - 00:15:26.088, Speaker C: Uh, good solid chunk of gold by.
00:15:26.104 - 00:15:28.380, Speaker B: The time I do think it'll.
00:15:28.680 - 00:15:29.820, Speaker C: You're cutting out.
00:15:30.280 - 00:15:31.736, Speaker B: Oh, my bad.
00:15:31.808 - 00:15:35.236, Speaker C: It's good solid chunk of gold by the time. Pick up from there.
00:15:35.308 - 00:15:57.524, Speaker B: Good solid chunk of gold by the time the month is over, then, like, you're not, like, it's. It's not something you can just. I feel like you have to go hard at it if you want to do well with it. And the people who do go hard at it are gonna do really well. But I'm not interested in farming anything that hard anymore. Like, I just don't think. I don't think now is really the time to farm.
00:15:57.524 - 00:15:59.520, Speaker B: I'd rather just let my bags work.
00:16:00.430 - 00:16:01.238, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:01.414 - 00:16:03.010, Speaker B: Shit. Coin occasionally.
00:16:04.590 - 00:16:25.444, Speaker C: Yeah. That's something that I don't think you even touched at all. Like, the ecosystem. I was pretty surprised. Like, I think you were talking about incentive mechanism, like that are. That's like built into the chain and how good it is for developers. But yeah, I just never really felt like I cared enough to.
00:16:25.444 - 00:17:06.668, Speaker C: To farm it hard or nearly as hard as other people are. But you know what I think, and this is going to sound like I'm hurt the last time, I think if you map it out, and I haven't mapped this out, but if you map out when Pacman. Pacman is like a very off the radar person most of the time, but every time he. The last time he hopped on a podcast was the launch or around the launch of Blur and their token. And then I thought it was on.
00:17:06.684 - 00:17:08.804, Speaker B: Bankless, like, like a couple weeks ago.
00:17:08.972 - 00:17:46.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I know, but, like, I feel like from there is like, I feel like it's like a bat signal. Like he's like looking for things aren't working like the way. The way they should. Like, if you and I, people that, like, are interested in different things and are actively on chain, like, most of our lives aren't farming blast points. Like, I really wonder what audience is. I don't doubt they exist. Like, I see a lot of them on CT, but they're more tied to like, protocols rather than farming the gold.
00:17:46.514 - 00:17:54.190, Speaker C: The gold is just like a second plus. So I wonder. Wonder how many people are actually going hard at it.
00:17:55.770 - 00:18:05.842, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. Well, no, people definitely are. Like, I think it's definitely happening quite a bit. I mean, where's blast sitting in TBL right now?
00:18:05.866 - 00:18:13.420, Speaker C: Even in front running with friends. Like, people within that ego. Are you going hard at it? Was that like six, seven people?
00:18:14.000 - 00:18:22.920, Speaker B: There are a good number of people farming it, I will say. Like, that I. That I've seen. At least TVL is still up only.
00:18:23.040 - 00:18:25.620, Speaker C: I mean, no way the fire alarm.
00:18:26.280 - 00:18:27.376, Speaker B: You can hear that.
00:18:27.528 - 00:18:28.260, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:30.160 - 00:18:47.498, Speaker B: I don't know what it is in EtH terms. It's probably up only in EtH terms too, because EtH isn't even like up that hard, but. Yeah, 1.6 bill right now. Like, people are still farming it. Like, it's not us necessarily farmer. I've.
00:18:47.498 - 00:19:06.770, Speaker B: I feel like I'm not. I haven't been a farmer in so long. Like, I'll do airdrop farming every now and then, but, like, it's not what I like to, like, think about or talk about that much and, like, but that class of users still exists, I think, like, there's people out there who yield farm, dude. Do you ever think about that?
00:19:08.910 - 00:19:21.130, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, but it's been good for them. Like, they've had some. They've had. They've had some good things going for them recently, I guess.
00:19:21.510 - 00:19:24.814, Speaker B: Pendle, that's. That's a good place, right?
00:19:24.942 - 00:19:26.894, Speaker C: Yeah. LRT stables.
00:19:26.942 - 00:19:30.330, Speaker B: You can probably get good stuff just for stables on Ave these days.
00:19:31.310 - 00:19:31.622, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:31.646 - 00:19:32.470, Speaker B: Marketplace.
00:19:32.590 - 00:19:36.078, Speaker C: Like, 50 or 60% for stables.
00:19:36.214 - 00:19:45.410, Speaker B: Yeah. Dude, borrowings. Insane. I can't. I've. I mean, for good reason, but, like, I've wanted to borrow for so long, and it's just no point.
00:19:48.110 - 00:20:08.460, Speaker C: Yeah. What else? I mean, I don't even want to talk about it, but, like, the meme coin shit has been super fun. I think it's created, like, a gambling addiction within me, but I think that has been fun. Do you pump out fun at all?
00:20:14.920 - 00:20:17.900, Speaker B: I missed your question, but I'm back now, I think.
00:20:19.360 - 00:20:20.780, Speaker C: Do you pump that fun?
00:20:22.290 - 00:20:23.430, Speaker B: No, I don't.
00:20:24.090 - 00:20:25.310, Speaker C: What do you think of it?
00:20:27.610 - 00:20:47.242, Speaker B: I think it's a fun idea. Like, I definitely think it's cool, but I. I don't really have an edge. I actually haven't tried it, to be honest. I haven't even given it a shot because, yeah, like, the stuff that I. The stuff that has worked for me with meme coining, like, you can't do on pump. You can't do on pump.
00:20:47.242 - 00:21:09.700, Speaker B: Dot fun. So, like, I just haven't bothered trying to learn. Yeah, I mean, meme coining, how long do you think that lasts? Like, does. I feel like in past cycles, the rule has always been when meme coins start to pump. Like, it's nearing the end and we've just been in a meme coin cycle for the past.
00:21:09.780 - 00:21:48.600, Speaker C: Like, I wish I was around a bit more when, like, doge and Shiba and, like, the majors of meme coins now, like, reforming to kind of see how, like, the. I guess, altcoins of the meme coins, like, played out, because I feel like what, what's happening now is, like, most of the. You really can't do well hitting on the stuff that's, like, 100K market cap. Like, hoping for it to go to a mill. Like, people are just taking a three x and running. Like, liquidity is just, like, running, like, keycat on base. Oh, I shouldn't say fucking tickers, but it's like, $100 million.
00:21:48.600 - 00:22:45.260, Speaker C: Like, that one just didn't stop running and, like, any kind of. Obviously it had the Ansem push. But like, a lot of people, I feel like a lot of liquidity is, like, jumping into these majors from the smaller ones. So I'm like, the past three weeks or two weeks, you really haven't been able to win on the smaller shitters. Like, you could, like, four weeks ago, especially on pace. And I wonder if that same thing happened in, like, the doge Shiba time, because it feels like it's becoming more than just like a luck of the draw, like, lottery ticket, and it's becoming a lot more like, distributed. And liquidity that's only in meme coins is now a thing.
00:22:45.260 - 00:23:26.294, Speaker C: I feel like there's defi liquidity. There's also NfT centric liquidity. And now I think meme coin centric liquidity is forming where that's all those wallets and those people do, and that's where all of their liquidity goes. And that's like, on the scale of. From, like, doge all the way down to, like, I'm not even going to name any of, like, the smaller under a million dollar market cap shitters. And so I don't know if that happened before, but to me that looks like a maturing market, you know, if that makes sense or like, the niche itself is. Is maturing.
00:23:26.294 - 00:23:45.648, Speaker C: Kind of like a NFT fine. Like, well, not nft five, but like, NFts in general. Like, there was a point where you could hit on the 15 minutes blur chart and, like, hit an easy two, three, x. And then things started consolidating into, like, you know, major nfts. I think the same thing's happening.
00:23:45.704 - 00:23:50.900, Speaker B: Would you call the NFT market now mature or more mature than it was two, three years ago?
00:23:56.400 - 00:24:15.460, Speaker C: Yes, because I could almost see them being, like, aligned. Like, you really don't even know. Like, they're. The meme coin and NFT scene are probably at the same pace right now. The same pace and in maturity.
00:24:16.680 - 00:24:22.580, Speaker B: Well, what do you mean? Like, I don't understand. Like, mature, though. Like, what. What hat? What's the next step?
00:24:25.610 - 00:24:56.120, Speaker C: I don't know. Maybe you'll see, like, a people yield farming, like, meme coins. Like, or more perps built on top of, like, a higher amount of. Are you there? Higher amounts of these shit coins? I think you're there. But I just think, like, oh, I think he's gone. Oh, he's gone. Gonna have to do this one solo.
00:24:56.120 - 00:26:04.700, Speaker C: Do I have the. I don't have the overlay for this, but no. Um, now that I can rant without Ali contradicting my opinion, I just think that the meme coins themselves just feel like a little bit more mature, if that makes sense. It feels like I know people that are trading perp like that are looking for more perpetual markets for meme coins for like 20 x leverage on a meme coin. And I think the demand for that is interesting. I think the fact that that didn't exist, or at least I don't think that existed last cycle is interesting. Like, people were, I guess you had safe moon, you had doge, you had what else, Sheba.
00:26:04.700 - 00:27:06.390, Speaker C: Like, like, those just flew to crazy market caps and then that's it. The purse markets were built out, communities were built out. Like, now these are considered beta place. And you can see similarities with that, like in the, in the, in the NFT sector. I feel like if you saw, like, you saw apes fly, punks, like majors flew all the shit, just got through, through to like, the wayside. And then a new market kind of formed the cycle after, I guess. And so that was like, when Blur started coming out and you'd see things like Milady's pick up pudgies pick up things that, like, had some time in the last cycle but didn't flourish as high as the matrix in the last cycle.
00:27:06.390 - 00:28:07.850, Speaker C: I think when a sector or a niche within crypto starts to have majors and it starts to have liquidity forming into what could be considered new majors, I think maybe there's just going to be a evergreen opportunity for meme coins to, like, continue growing, if that makes sense. I think that. I think that. I think that makes sense. But do I think this, like, meme coin mania lasts for that long? Is pumped pump that fund gonna make, like, $5 million in revenue for forever? No, I don't think so. But I think it's also just a cycle of, like, people want to get rich quick. People are gambling and they're not going to stop gambling.
00:28:07.850 - 00:28:40.700, Speaker C: And pumped out fun is like the grouping of like, four chan and front tech bonding mechanism mechanics that allow for, like, some of the cheapest fun that you can have on chain. So. Oh, ours is in here. Meme coin options zero, zero to eight expiry meme coin options.
00:28:42.280 - 00:28:56.140, Speaker B: Pretty back. I've my computer. My Mac just crashed. Like, Internet problems and then my Mac crashes. I don't. I also switched Internets, so does it feel like it's better now?
00:28:56.520 - 00:29:17.260, Speaker C: Yeah, it does. I did my rants on meme coins, but I overall, I just think maybe the, like, I don't think they're going to go away. I think that know, the cycle of meme coins is. No shot. He's gone. No shot. He's gone again.
00:29:17.260 - 00:29:22.340, Speaker C: No way. Ollie really fucking up this episode.
00:29:23.280 - 00:29:34.480, Speaker B: Yo, that time was my fault. I accidentally clicked x. I'll stop now. Thank you. I see Waj was holding down the fort while I was gone. Thank. Thank you.
00:29:34.480 - 00:29:36.420, Speaker B: Thank you. Watch for stepping in.
00:29:38.040 - 00:29:39.780, Speaker C: I should have just sent him the link.
00:29:41.720 - 00:29:45.560, Speaker B: Yeah, probably would have. I think we're good now, though. I'm optimistic.
00:29:45.640 - 00:30:12.510, Speaker C: Okay. Your connection isn't better, but you're here. But, no, I just think it's matured. Like, I don't think it's like, I don't think. I don't think meme coins go away. It's gonna be like another part of every cycle. I don't really buy into, like, you know, this is culture, and, like, you know, a coin's gonna go up based on what? Like, the celebrity that is commentating about them says.
00:30:12.510 - 00:30:48.040, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, I think somebody. Somebody on a different podcast that I watched talked to talked about this already, but I think that's, like, pretty. I think it's, like, pretty dumb and, like, kind of like opium. Like, people are saying, like, people are making the ties of meme coins, like, culture, and, you know, betting on culture or betting on some niche within. Within the culture. I think, like, they're just trying to, like, overcomplicate their meme coin thesis.
00:30:49.500 - 00:31:30.780, Speaker B: That was kind of what be funny. That was like, yeah, that was what Reagan said from lattice when we were talking about that. I think, like, you can point to the same thing for, like, as long as we're drawing parallels to nfts. Like, for nfts, they're like, serious version or, like, future or whatever you want to call it was like, oh, we're going to put, like, everything on chain eventually. Like real estate, you know, watches, Pokemon cards, I don't know, whatever else paychecks. Like, we're gonna. We're gonna make everything into nfts, right? Because why not? That was kind of like their version of that.
00:31:30.780 - 00:31:51.562, Speaker B: And obviously that hasn't really happened now. I mean, people are still working on it. Like, I'm not super watches. Aren't they? Watches? Yeah, you can watch. Isn't like, I think you can. You can put them on chain and borrow against them. There's some.
00:31:51.562 - 00:32:42.452, Speaker B: I think someone's planes boarding or something. Yeah, so, like, if, like, that same thing as meme coins, like, their, like, appeal to culture or, like, them being a bet on different, like, cultural movements or memes or whatever, it's like, not I feel like it has a stronger case than that because you could never really articulate. Even back then, even in the peak of, like, nft hysteria, you could never really articulate why you would need to put a house on chain or how you could feasibly do that with the system as it is. But the difference is that there is no, like, way to bet on culture right now. You know? Like. And that goes, like, the. The reason why I think it could hold some weight is because it's so broadly applicable.
00:32:42.452 - 00:33:09.290, Speaker B: Like, to see it not take hold in even one area would be pretty surprising. Like, we had, like, there was an earthquake in New York, like, I don't know, a couple days ago, and, like, NYC earthquake or whatever the. Whatever the meme coin was ran up to. I don't know, how much do we have to, like, not say ticker? We're not big enough that that matters yet. Like, at a certain point. Yeah, we can't, like, mention stuff like that. But you get my point, though.
00:33:09.330 - 00:33:09.602, Speaker C: Like.
00:33:09.666 - 00:33:28.030, Speaker B: Like, you know, it's. That it's like, bowdoin. It's like, you know, whiff and how. And, like, it's ties to Ansem. It's like, doge, and it's ties to Elon and Twitter, and, like, you know, there's so much shit being thrown at the wall, I would be surprised if something didn't stick, you know?
00:33:30.090 - 00:33:57.990, Speaker C: Yeah. The only. The only, like, thing that I'll give meme coins is, like, most people can recognize. Like, most normal people obviously know what bitcoin is. If they know what bitcoin is, they're likely to know what. What doge is even over, like, ethereum and likely even over, like, Solana. So I think that is the opportunity.
00:33:57.990 - 00:34:30.230, Speaker C: Whereas, like, just a catchy name. The dog is cute, or, like, the animal is cute, and there's enough people or someone that's very popular kind of supporting or discussing it. Yeah, I could see it. I don't think it's gonna go away. That was the original question. I think, like, obviously, there's gonna be moments where it's, like, at its peak, but I don't think it's gonna go away. People are making too much money, uh, and protocols are making a lot more money now.
00:34:30.230 - 00:34:33.914, Speaker C: Um, like, facilities, I think.
00:34:33.922 - 00:35:02.630, Speaker B: I feel like there's a future where. I feel like there's a future where meme coins, like, aren't even known as crypto or, like, people don't class bitcoin. Like, if you were to explain meme coins to someone who'd never heard of meme coins before. You'd probably start off by explaining what bitcoin is. Right. Or, like, ethereum is. I feel like there's a future where people can just skip that step and they can just be cute ways to bet on things or cute ways to be part of communities.
00:35:02.630 - 00:35:13.150, Speaker B: It doesn't have to be like, it doesn't have to necessarily be blockchain based or cryptographic or whatever. It can just be cute.
00:35:14.770 - 00:35:33.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I see the community angle, but I just don't see the, and I see the cute angle, but I do still think there's, like, a financial angle involved. Like, people aren't buying this shit to be a part of the, like, New York City earthquake community. Like, they're trying to, they're trying to ride the chip from, like, one mil to 100 mil.
00:35:34.810 - 00:35:41.714, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, obviously the gamble. Obviously the gamble thesis is more, is definitely more compelling.
00:35:41.802 - 00:36:31.850, Speaker C: And I do see the, like, we're like, you can kind of see it as, like, like almost like poly market where, like, like, if Joe Biden, like, falls or trips or has, like, a bad, like, you know, press incident, like, does that mean, like, the meme coin making fun of him? Which of bowdoin does that mean? It goes up or down? Like, I think, like, that in itself is funny and, like, attributing people's sentiment and, like, a dollar value. Unlike someone that's like a figure or, like, an idea, I think, is where these, like, culture coins can do well, but, yeah, it's tough. Like, like, where did. What is bonk at right now?
00:36:33.590 - 00:36:52.326, Speaker B: Bonk has been relatively, like, even I want to say. I mean, relative to, relative to, like, other meme coins. I was, I still, like bonk. Still. Still a fan of theirs. Oh, my God. Coingecko is down.
00:36:52.326 - 00:36:58.730, Speaker B: That's crazy. Over capacity. It's not my Internet. It was a different, like, screen.
00:36:59.710 - 00:37:27.210, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's meme coins have been fun. It has been fun. I don't, like, agree with the people that think it shouldn't exist, but it definitely has rotted my brain. Like, I feel like I need to have, like, a reset. I feel like we need, like, the bear market again so I can actually start reading and, like, learning different things.
00:37:29.070 - 00:37:33.890, Speaker B: Do you want to talk about the bull case for Ethereum? Does that still exist?
00:37:37.230 - 00:37:51.170, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you want to, do you want to get really, do you want to get really, like, weird and make predictions on the ETF?
00:37:52.510 - 00:37:54.850, Speaker B: ETF? No, I don't want to do that.
00:37:55.830 - 00:38:11.352, Speaker C: Well, I'm going to sound fun? I'm going to say, for. For the record, I do think it's. I think it's gonna get approved. The. The next meeting, whatever the fuck it is, like, may or June. I think it's gonna get approved, probably.
00:38:11.416 - 00:38:12.900, Speaker B: Yeah, probably.
00:38:14.920 - 00:38:15.928, Speaker C: That's why.
00:38:16.104 - 00:38:17.128, Speaker B: I mean, people have.
00:38:17.184 - 00:38:45.150, Speaker C: That's my full case. But I also think, like, ethereum has, like, succeeded, like, on the mission. I don't think it's, like, done developing, but I think it's there. It's, like, the most, you know, accurate, quote, unquote, decentralized layer for settlement. As whack as that sounds, I think it. I think it's true.
00:38:47.690 - 00:38:58.200, Speaker B: I feel like that is. Feel like that's a very hot. Take a watch. Asked a question a minute ago. Should probably answer him. Yeah. Said, in your opinion, all the people who play meme coins.
00:38:58.200 - 00:39:05.400, Speaker B: Yeah. Who. What percent have made money and what percent of lost money is, like 95?
00:39:07.220 - 00:39:17.200, Speaker C: No, you'd be surprised. There's a bunch of. There's people taking, like, as soon as it goes, like, two x around, like, those people are making money.
00:39:18.230 - 00:39:39.070, Speaker B: I feel like the fundamental rule is just that people lose markets overwhelmingly. Like, there's not been a case where that hasn't been true. Maybe. Maybe if we looked at, like, a week. If we looked at, like, one week or one day, you could say. You could say it's closer to 50 50 or 60 40, whatever. But on the whole, like, we're talking.
00:39:39.190 - 00:39:40.894, Speaker C: 30, but I won't go.
00:39:40.942 - 00:39:44.210, Speaker B: We're talking since the beginning of time or since the beginning of meme coins.
00:39:44.830 - 00:39:48.450, Speaker C: Oh, since the beginning of meme coins. I'm talking about, like, the last four weeks.
00:39:49.230 - 00:40:00.398, Speaker B: Oh, the last four weeks. Okay. Yeah, if we. If we close, I think on the whole, it trends to, like, like, 99 one on a long enough time frame.
00:40:00.534 - 00:40:03.130, Speaker C: I'd say. I'd say 90. Ten, but yeah.
00:40:04.830 - 00:40:38.510, Speaker B: But yeah, it depends on which, like, weeks you're looking at. Like, also, like, a lot of it is just paper gains too. Like, you can't exit meme coins on Solana, dude. I mean, you can, but, like, how much liquidity does a whiff have? Dude, nobody wants to answer that question with dog wolf hat. It's on. Okay. Deck screener showing me with ondezenhe pulse chain before it shows me on.
00:40:38.510 - 00:40:59.946, Speaker B: On Solana. But, yeah, no, I think, like, mostly paper gains. Most don't get out. Well, 23 mil, 23 million. The biggest pair, that is a 3.6 bill coin. Not even.
00:40:59.946 - 00:41:01.590, Speaker B: Not even 10% of that.
00:41:02.220 - 00:41:02.988, Speaker C: Damn.
00:41:03.124 - 00:41:15.760, Speaker B: Wait, that can't be right. There has to be other pairs. That's like absurdly low. That's way lower than I thought it was. Dog move hat. You see 23, 2.1.
00:41:16.100 - 00:41:18.240, Speaker C: Is that the reason there's no spot market?
00:41:20.980 - 00:41:22.360, Speaker B: You mean perp market?
00:41:23.580 - 00:41:31.934, Speaker C: No. And someone's complaining that. What was it slur for book of meme had like, finance bot listings and we've still didn't.
00:41:32.022 - 00:41:35.530, Speaker B: Oh, I thought Wif was on like Coinbase already.
00:41:36.390 - 00:41:38.970, Speaker C: No, really?
00:41:40.110 - 00:42:01.780, Speaker B: It could be. Yeah. I mean, there's, there's like, if you just add up all those lP's, it's probably like 30 million liquidity for a three bill token. That's like 1%. That means 1% of withholders can exit fully. Well, I guess you don't include the LP. So it's like more like two, 3% maybe.
00:42:01.780 - 00:42:20.552, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, I don't think. I think, I think if you go any time span longer than like a week, it's like, it's at least like 80 20. Most people.
00:42:20.616 - 00:42:22.140, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:42:23.050 - 00:42:39.746, Speaker B: You gotta quit while you're in the 20. That's the plan. But most don't. Yeah, most want to run it back. What else is so. Yeah, no, I like the, the bull case for Ethereum thing. Like, I totally.
00:42:39.818 - 00:42:40.630, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:42:41.010 - 00:42:42.706, Speaker B: I totally don't.
00:42:42.818 - 00:42:43.466, Speaker C: Do you have, like.
00:42:43.498 - 00:42:47.932, Speaker B: That's a very hot take to say that ethereum has done it. I. Yeah, I have one, but I.
00:42:48.026 - 00:42:49.968, Speaker C: I think they are the settlement layer.
00:42:50.144 - 00:42:56.100, Speaker B: I mean, like, but they're not, they're not scalable. They're not scalable and they're not decentralized.
00:42:57.240 - 00:43:24.180, Speaker C: If. Okay, if you had to take an two AI, like, or an AI image versus an image that you, you've drawn yourself, or an image that is of yourself, which. Where else are you going to put that? On the Internet where people know what's AI and what's actually from you.
00:43:29.440 - 00:43:33.888, Speaker B: But that's like one very specific case of blockchain that, like, people don't even.
00:43:33.944 - 00:43:41.040, Speaker C: Use really not yet. I think that's going to be like increasingly important. But I think because that's the.
00:43:41.080 - 00:43:43.100, Speaker B: What about, what about the reason why people.
00:43:44.640 - 00:44:08.746, Speaker C: Because I would go with Ethereum for that. I would like, classify it as accomplishing that sorts of truth settlement layer. And also, like, I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be gay. But like Blackrock or whoever put like 100 mil and built and they're building a money market on top of 100.
00:44:08.768 - 00:44:14.350, Speaker B: Mil is a rounding error for Blackrock. 100 mil is they're opening up a.
00:44:14.390 - 00:45:11.722, Speaker C: Money market for, for their, I don't want to say users, but for their, the people in their fund, I don't think it's like, public, but, like, people that are like, in that ecosystem will have access to an on chain money market and they're going to be getting, like, consistent airdrops. Like, the token just gets, like, the rewards just get, like, airdropped to their, to their wallet. Based on how much of the fund that they hold, I don't know. I think that was pretty cool. Like, people are like, grown trad. Five men that are probably like 70 are going to be, like, looking at, like, how much of a random ticker they'll be getting from Blackrock on chain. Why didn't they put that anywhere else? If it's a rounding air, they would have put it on salon and it would put it on avalanche.
00:45:11.722 - 00:45:12.910, Speaker C: They put it everywhere.
00:45:13.370 - 00:45:33.830, Speaker B: They're experimenting is what they're doing. Yeah, I mean, all the reasons why people use crypto today are not done on that same settlement layer, though. Like, we could talk about the future and how we might use crypto. Why do, why does anyone use aetherium today?
00:45:35.050 - 00:45:44.030, Speaker C: That, like, I may consider, I consider the things that people are doing on other chains that get settled on Ethereum pretty much the same thing as them doing it on Ethereum.
00:45:44.890 - 00:45:50.874, Speaker B: That's fine. But then you can't go and say that, like, that, like, ethereum is done that, like, jobs finish, because those.
00:45:50.962 - 00:45:55.712, Speaker C: No, no. Jobs not finished. Jobs not finished. Jobs not finished. Like I'm.
00:45:55.776 - 00:46:00.488, Speaker B: But you're saying, like, they, this the.
00:46:00.624 - 00:46:14.100, Speaker C: Source of truth, like, global settlement layer. I think they've, I think they've, like, I think they've done that. Okay, now what if we make it better?
00:46:14.400 - 00:46:16.460, Speaker B: What if bitcoin, l two s work?
00:46:18.920 - 00:46:20.884, Speaker C: If bitcoin, l two s work.
00:46:21.072 - 00:46:31.600, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, what if we can do, like a, what if we can make, like a ZK ZK roll up on bitcoin? Why, why would you ever do anything on an ethel two?
00:46:36.740 - 00:46:49.496, Speaker C: Because it's cool, it's better. No, I have no answer for that, but I mean, I'm sure, like, the Zk bitcoin, l two is gonna be written in EVM, whatever.
00:46:49.528 - 00:46:53.380, Speaker B: That. How does that, how does, how is that bullish for Ethereum.
00:46:57.480 - 00:46:57.768, Speaker C: Man?
00:46:57.784 - 00:47:19.190, Speaker B: I don't think that's a developer thing. You got my point. My point. There's one reason why people use Ethereum today. Ethereum mainnet today, and that is to farm Eigen Laird, like, at the end of the day. That's the way it is.
00:47:19.810 - 00:47:28.634, Speaker C: People were doing on Ethel one before that. That's a bit unfair. How many months old we were in.
00:47:28.642 - 00:47:32.070, Speaker B: A bear market when we were doing stuff on Ethereum. We could afford to do it.
00:47:34.330 - 00:47:43.880, Speaker C: Yeah, but like, I've always thought, like, the decentralization problem is like a harder one to solve for than the speed and like, cheapness problem.
00:47:45.860 - 00:48:01.124, Speaker B: Well, it's the, it's the whole, like, it's the trilemma thing, right? It's like decentralization, scalability. And what was the third thing? I remember the third thing. It's probably not that important. Secure, maybe security, but.
00:48:01.292 - 00:48:04.630, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it is security, but I.
00:48:04.780 - 00:48:13.190, Speaker B: But the whole point is you can't have one without the other. It's not that one is harder than the other, it's that you can't have. Or it's having the two of them together is hard.
00:48:15.170 - 00:48:20.790, Speaker C: Yeah. So Ethereum doesn't have to have the scalability because the l two s do.
00:48:23.930 - 00:48:24.522, Speaker B: No, they don't.
00:48:24.546 - 00:49:00.160, Speaker C: They, they do they have sufficient scalability now? No, they don't have more scalability in the future. Yeah, I know. Like people say, what is it? Like, uh, what is like the thing that's built into like optimistic roll ups or ck roll up, broad proof has like a funny name. No, no, like they're really the more technical thing. Like, I know they don't scale, but there are people building out versions of l two s that scale more than the current ones do. And now that makes Ethereum better.
00:49:02.780 - 00:49:10.200, Speaker B: Why can't I just say the same thing that you just said, but replace Ethereum with Solana and replace the word scalability with decentralization.
00:49:14.300 - 00:49:19.040, Speaker C: Yeah, they have, they have those two. But I think the decentralization one is a lot more important.
00:49:20.300 - 00:49:22.440, Speaker B: How is Solana not decentralized?
00:49:23.370 - 00:49:27.642, Speaker C: It's sufficiently decentralized, but it's not as centralized.
00:49:27.826 - 00:49:36.554, Speaker B: Explain that to me. Like, what's like, how do you know what makes Ethereum a ten out of ten and Solana like four out of ten or whatever?
00:49:36.722 - 00:49:39.670, Speaker C: Ten out of ten. Ethereum is a ten out of ten.
00:49:40.930 - 00:49:45.590, Speaker B: Ethereum settlement is a ten out of ten. But there l two s.
00:49:48.860 - 00:49:52.772, Speaker C: Or zero. Yeah, yeah, that's fair.
00:49:52.836 - 00:49:56.440, Speaker B: Do you remember when arbitrary forgot to refill their sequencer with gas?
00:49:58.460 - 00:50:19.012, Speaker C: Listen, and there's, there's going to be decentralized sequencing, there's going to be, you know, more stuff. But the decentralization in itself is like pretty much done. Nobody can. Nobody can. That's not true. It's not. It's not done.
00:50:19.012 - 00:50:22.440, Speaker C: There's, like, like, two more things left. I swear.
00:50:22.780 - 00:50:25.640, Speaker B: They're big things, dude. They're big.
00:50:26.140 - 00:50:38.040, Speaker C: Two more things. I know what you're going to say. Yeah, no, I know. I thought you were going to bring up, like, flashbots or, like, the validators.
00:50:40.470 - 00:50:48.158, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, lido. The whole Lido thing. Yeah, forgot about that. I wasn't even thinking about that. But, yeah, that's true.
00:50:48.214 - 00:51:29.422, Speaker C: Yeah, no, not the whole Lido thing. Like, what is it? Like, there's only, like, eight of them. I don't think the word is validators. My brain has been pried. But anyways, yes, I just, I just think, like, ethereum is very far along, and I'm happy with where they are as, like, a true, you know, costless settlement layer. I still. I still buy into that copium, and I know it's copium, but I mean, like, what if we didn't have ethereum? Like, come on.
00:51:29.566 - 00:51:33.680, Speaker B: Like, what if it was just, like, since the beginning? Or if it just.
00:51:34.940 - 00:51:37.360, Speaker C: Yeah, like, imagine if it disappeared today.
00:51:38.500 - 00:51:43.676, Speaker B: Like, I know, like, for, like, some of my bags.
00:51:43.868 - 00:51:58.860, Speaker C: I. Like, I know, like, the whole, like, nation state attack thing is, like, kind of drawn out and, like, you know, people taking down the chain because there's, like, you know, not sufficient decentralization or whatever. Whatever.
00:51:58.940 - 00:51:59.350, Speaker B: I.
00:51:59.460 - 00:52:19.870, Speaker C: But, like, I buy into that. I'm not going to lie. I still buy into that. Like, if it was just Solana, I feel like maybe a country in, like, the bottom two. In the bottom 20, if they really wanted to, could take out Solana.
00:52:21.970 - 00:52:30.090, Speaker B: What? A country in the bottom 20 could really take out Solana if they wanted to. Like, based on what? Just, like, capital?
00:52:31.670 - 00:52:47.450, Speaker C: No, like, if they, if they, if they just started rounding up, like, the. What is it, like, 500 validators, 200 validators? What if, what if. What if that happened, would just be cooked?
00:52:48.430 - 00:52:52.050, Speaker B: Solana has 1750 validators.
00:52:53.560 - 00:52:56.860, Speaker C: The majority of them are probably in, like, what, four countries?
00:53:00.440 - 00:53:12.672, Speaker B: When you say majority, do you mean like most of them, or do you mean enough of them to control a significant portion of the stake? Oh, this is a fun exercise. How many, how many validators?
00:53:12.696 - 00:53:14.408, Speaker C: I don't like this exercise.
00:53:14.544 - 00:53:28.270, Speaker B: How many validators? How many Solana validators do you think it takes to get to 33% of the network? Actually, no, let's do 51. That's a more fun. 151 percent. How many you think it takes?
00:53:33.250 - 00:53:34.270, Speaker C: 900.
00:53:35.530 - 00:53:49.390, Speaker B: All right, well, now, that's. That's, like, way too high of a guess now. I'm not as excited about the real answer. Ethereum's three, first of all. Or four, maybe. It's like Lido, Coinbase, kraken and someone else. Yeah, but that's Solana.
00:53:50.330 - 00:54:04.610, Speaker C: That's not fair. Lido 45 is not like, from what I know, Lido isn't just like all in one room. It's like more than just like one. Whereas like, Coinbase Lido, likely all in one room.
00:54:05.230 - 00:54:47.020, Speaker B: Lido has different node operators who they like. Yes, Lido doesn't own the hardware or operate the hardware, but they own the stake. And the us government can still seize digital assets or subpoena Lido. And like, at best, at best. If Lido were compromised, it would fragment their network of however many node operators they have and they would be left to keep their own operations running, which they. That's like very, very, very unlikely because obviously either Lido or someone is going to be coming their eth.
00:54:48.840 - 00:54:53.100, Speaker C: So I feel like we talk about this every solo episode.
00:54:53.760 - 00:54:55.460, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's been a long time.
00:54:57.680 - 00:55:24.764, Speaker C: I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about. I just think the decentralization vibes are better in ethereum world. And I, and I like, and I like them. That's my point. I think Solana was supposed to be, you know, like the fastest. It was supposed to be able to have the most users because they weren't as decentralized or as focused on it. And now the chain is congested.
00:55:24.764 - 00:55:32.560, Speaker C: I mean, like, I'm not trying to dunk off Solana, but like, I don't know.
00:55:35.060 - 00:55:37.172, Speaker B: My argument. I don't want to do the same as it's always been.
00:55:37.196 - 00:55:38.636, Speaker C: I don't want to do this debate.
00:55:38.828 - 00:55:54.436, Speaker B: Sell your e. My argument is the same as it's always been. It's, it's still everything. Sell your eth. It's still, we all need to do work. Honestly, if not for Eigen Lair, I if not for Eigen lair, I would not hold nearly as much eth as I do. And I think, I think that.
00:55:54.436 - 00:56:43.070, Speaker B: I don't know, it's a hundred percent true. And I think, I think most people feel the same way. Like, why would you hold eth when bitcoin puppets existed? Why would you hold eth when dog with hat exists? Like, I think, I think the maturity, the maturation, whatever that word is that has happened in crypto is not with regards to anything becoming more sophisticated, but with people accepting that we're just like, just accepting the reality of why we're here. Right. And like, it's, it's like it sucks for some reasons. But it's. It's great for other reasons.
00:56:43.070 - 00:57:16.564, Speaker B: And it, like, I don't know how long it's going to sustain for, like, obviously, deep in the bear, we see more. Like, that's when you see stuff like GMX pump and more sustainable revenue stuff and that. Like, that's great. That's the way it should be. But, like, now. No, like, there are very few people who are still kidding themselves these days and who are talking about things like decentralization or, like, use cases or, like, most people just want a dog with a hat, and they're. And they're.
00:57:16.564 - 00:57:18.240, Speaker B: They're fine with that.
00:57:20.020 - 00:57:20.988, Speaker C: Wait, I hope our.
00:57:21.044 - 00:57:23.240, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Eigen Lair mainnet launched.
00:57:24.390 - 00:57:25.130, Speaker C: Really?
00:57:26.150 - 00:57:34.742, Speaker B: Yeah, but there's no token. Dude, get the fuck out of here. Wait, roll ups. Dude, this is a long thread. Oh, my God.
00:57:34.926 - 00:57:40.770, Speaker C: Oh, fuck. I fucked. I fucked us. I fucked us on Twitter.
00:57:41.430 - 00:57:42.490, Speaker B: What happened?
00:57:44.070 - 00:57:56.416, Speaker C: The. I honestly didn't think we would go for the hour, and I kind of have, like, a hard stop, and so it just ended. We didn't really do. My bad. But it's still on YouTube. We're still live on YouTube.
00:57:56.608 - 00:58:01.380, Speaker B: Okay, well, that's fine. That episode was kind of, like, a mess anyways.
00:58:01.760 - 00:58:06.540, Speaker C: Yeah. Um, wait, is there anything else we want to talk about?
00:58:08.000 - 00:58:10.260, Speaker B: I mean, it's. Oh, we're still live.
00:58:11.200 - 00:58:15.514, Speaker C: Yeah, we're still live on YouTube. We're still live to watch.
00:58:15.562 - 00:58:18.738, Speaker B: I thought it was just. I thought it was just over Twitter.
00:58:18.794 - 00:58:43.748, Speaker C: Like, there defaults to. Defaults to 1 hour, and I don't think we would go over, but is there anything else? Dbridge. I'm excited for Dbridge. I think the bridge is so nice. Points will be fun. I think they might go, like, the Athena route and go quick, like. I don't know.
00:58:43.748 - 00:59:02.880, Speaker C: It's just the vibe I get from them doing the retroactive stuff. And. What else is there? Should I go back to margin five farming? I think. Either this month or, like, either. I think next month I'm gonna go back.
00:59:03.980 - 00:59:06.040, Speaker B: I don't like parking funds anymore.
00:59:07.990 - 00:59:20.862, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. But I don't know, if I don't park a little bit, I'll just end up burning through it on shitters or shit that I. Yeah.
00:59:20.886 - 00:59:24.610, Speaker B: So what? Eventually. Eventually you'll hit on something, right?
00:59:25.830 - 00:59:26.970, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess.
00:59:28.070 - 00:59:39.188, Speaker B: There's no. There's no mention of any, at least. I mean, I'm still, like, skimming through it, but I don't see anything about token or anything on this Eigen lair. I guess it was never expected to.
00:59:39.204 - 01:00:03.000, Speaker C: Be tensor being done, man. Do you think layer zero is going to fucking. Well, no. They already announced, like, what, q two or the second half of this year. Well, maybe ZK sync by end of this month. I'm excited for bear chain. Chain could be sick.
01:00:03.000 - 01:00:08.120, Speaker C: Or 20 fucking chain.
01:00:08.940 - 01:00:12.240, Speaker B: It would be huge if that happened. And if.
01:00:12.540 - 01:00:22.236, Speaker C: And wait, guess how many. Guess how many bit bears are listed or were listed last night on blur.
01:00:22.388 - 01:00:24.360, Speaker B: What's the total? What's the total supply?
01:00:26.430 - 01:00:38.462, Speaker C: Couple thousand, I think. I want to say 3000. 2222. 79.
01:00:38.486 - 01:00:43.490, Speaker B: 2200? Like, 60. No, way. Less than that. Like, 20.
01:00:44.670 - 01:00:48.110, Speaker C: What the fuck? There's, like, there was, like, 45.
01:00:48.190 - 01:00:49.330, Speaker B: Nobody lists.
01:00:49.630 - 01:01:14.760, Speaker C: There was 45, but when it had its last run up, there was, like, around this amount, and then it would, like, jump up to 100 listed, and then that was kind of, like the top. So. I'm not gonna lie. I need more ethereum. There's a certain number where I might exit this, to be honest.
01:01:16.460 - 01:01:23.000, Speaker B: But I don't know what it has to do with Ethereum, but. Okay. Like, bear chains. A whole other chain.
01:01:23.440 - 01:01:26.660, Speaker C: No, like, I need more eth, and I'm going to sell it for Eth.
01:01:27.480 - 01:01:28.260, Speaker B: Oh.
01:01:28.840 - 01:01:36.824, Speaker C: Unless I hold all the way until, like, the march. March of the bears. I mean, you don't understand.
01:01:36.912 - 01:01:37.664, Speaker B: I think that's fine.
01:01:37.712 - 01:01:38.568, Speaker C: This big bear.
01:01:38.664 - 01:01:39.992, Speaker B: I like the Fairchild.
01:01:40.096 - 01:01:55.810, Speaker C: My portfolio. Dude. This bit bear is like, my saving grace, I'm not gonna lie. But it's like, how could the bear chain be then the airdropping?
01:01:55.970 - 01:02:16.100, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, we just saw one. We just saw an NFT pump to, like, valhalla slowly dump for a while afterwards. And then a team, like, failed to meet expectations with that floor price with tentorians. Like, it's not like bear chain never asked. Mean, like, I.
01:02:16.100 - 01:02:40.468, Speaker B: Like, I don't doubt that they'll. That they'll compensate their holders, but they never asked for these things to be worth as much as they are. So, like, you have to consider that they don't. Like. Like, they didn't play users. Users might be like, bong bears might be expecting, like, a 200 er drop or whatever, but, like, those things minted for, like, 0.25 or whatever, like, bear chain didn't pump the price.
01:02:40.468 - 01:02:49.098, Speaker B: 1000 x. Yeah. All right, let's. Let's wrap up here. I got a call. I'm over four. Yeah, I agree.
01:02:49.098 - 01:02:57.550, Speaker B: I like burching. I'm gonna be playing them in some way at launch, I'm sure. Cool. Episode 69.
01:02:58.010 - 01:03:01.226, Speaker C: It's the end definitely not episode 69. That's the end.
01:03:01.258 - 01:03:02.070, Speaker B: It is now.
01:03:02.930 - 01:03:05.762, Speaker C: We'll be live in Dubai next week. Fucking nuts.
01:03:05.826 - 01:03:06.442, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
01:03:06.546 - 01:03:11.458, Speaker C: All right, see you, guys. Yeah. If anyone's in fucking Dubai, let us know.
01:03:11.594 - 01:03:12.850, Speaker B: Yeah, we got to tweet something about that.
