00:00:00.160 - 00:00:13.326, Speaker A: Restaking is such a big hype in the Ethereum ecosystem, but it's actually an idea that has been taken from different ecosystems. Right? Whether it's from Polkadot, Cosmos, wherever it comes from, these two ecosystems have always been at the forefront of technology and.
00:00:13.390 - 00:01:07.862, Speaker B: Building liquid staking, a topic that has gotten a lot of attention recently with projects like Eigen Layer launching, which raised more than $100 million from investors. And their application has received more than $12 billion in value from users locking their tokens in Eigen layer. So what is liquid staking? Why is it a major narrative in crypto today, and what are the risks? And how can you benefit from all this? We got two experts on the show today from projects that deal with liquid staking, but they're from different ecosystems. One is persistence one, an app chain in the cosmos ecosystem, and the other is Bifrost, a power chain on Polkadot. Do not miss this episode. Stay tuned and follow us. All right, thank you for tuning into the teach me defi podcast.
00:01:07.862 - 00:01:34.034, Speaker B: My name is Sohail, and today we have two guests on the show, and we will have a chat that kind of crosses ecosystem borders between Polkadot and Cosmos, which I'm excited about. We got Thibault here from Bifrost and Appchain, or power chain on Polkadot, and we got Mikhail from persistence one, which is an app chain in the cosmos ecosystem. Hi, guys.
00:01:34.974 - 00:01:35.714, Speaker C: Hello.
00:01:37.854 - 00:02:10.004, Speaker B: Sweet. Lovely to have you guys on. And, yeah, I mean, maybe to start it off with, your projects are kind of. Well, they may be based in different ecosystems, but they have things in common. Both of them deal with liquid state, among other things. So, yeah, I thought it would be interesting if we do a joint episode and get several perspectives on this topic. Perhaps we can also chat about closely related things, such as restaking with the whole Eigen layer thing that's going on.
00:02:10.004 - 00:02:28.994, Speaker B: So, yeah, just maybe to kick it off, let's say, if you imagine explaining liquid staking, which can be a bit confusing at first, to a ten year old, let's say, how would you describe it? And perhaps, Mikhail, you go first, and Thibault can jump in after.
00:02:29.494 - 00:02:32.514, Speaker A: Thankfully, no ten year old has asked me this question.
00:02:34.814 - 00:02:38.534, Speaker B: Well, they might. They're getting very financially literate in the web. Three, eight.
00:02:38.574 - 00:03:23.362, Speaker A: Yeah, they are indeed. I would say, you know, staking, if you're aware of staking, I'm assuming this ten year old is aware of staking as a concept, certain limitations, it creates certain problems. So when you stake your assets, you end up locking those assets on the blockchain and you know, those assets are then used to participate in network consensus governance, whatever, right? Like, you earn some staking rewards for using your assets to do something with it. So you're staking it and it's doing something in the background to give you some rewards. Those rewards can come from different places. We don't need to go into those things. But to earn those rewards, you essentially end up locking your assets, which is never a great thing, because in crypto, you need liquidity at all times.
00:03:23.362 - 00:03:41.042, Speaker A: You know, when you stake your assets, it gets locked up. When you choose to withdraw, it takes a certain amount of time. This is called, you know, the unbonding period or the cool off period. So if so, hell, you decide to stake hundred atom today, and you not dot. You prefer atom in this example.
00:03:41.178 - 00:03:41.858, Speaker C: I'm just kidding.
00:03:41.906 - 00:04:36.924, Speaker A: But, oh, you're starting already. If you decide to stake 100 atoms today and you see that atom is mooning and it's at $40 in a week, and you're like, okay, I need to sell this. You cannot do it because you'll have to wait for 21 days to get your assets back, and then you sell it. So to tackle this problem of the unbonding period, you can liquid stake your tokens. So instead of staking it natively on the chain, you use a liquid staking application or liquid staking protocol provider to stake your assets. So you deposit your atom into pstake, and pstake will issue you a liquid stake token, which is like a recipe, you know, it's like a valet ticket where you get this, some new token, which is equivalent to your 100 atom deposits and this new token. You can just send it, or you can just give it to somebody else, right? You can hand it off to TBO when TBO wants, you know, let's say.
00:04:36.924 - 00:04:51.884, Speaker A: So TBO is going to give you 40 atoms, $40 worth of atom for one atom, that one liquid staked atom that you give to him or whatever that looks like the exchange rate. So that's liquid staking very short, right?
00:04:52.184 - 00:04:54.604, Speaker B: Thibault, anything to add from your side?
00:04:55.304 - 00:05:52.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I think as Mikhail was saying, hopefully the ten year old is a djen, you know, buying meme coins and messing around on chains. So he likes liquid staking. But no, I would say, I mean, I think Mikhail's done a good job. I would just simply say like, yeah, staking, you know, the core mechanism behind staking or proof of stake is really intended to add more security to the network, right? And there are obviously various ways one can do that. You know, we've seen that with staking as a service, staking pools, you know, solo staking, which is like, you know, the North Star, and then, you know, we've seen liquid staking has become like a very important demand driver, given the limitations of liquid, you know, of staking traditionally. So the motivation around liquid staking is really around to tackle the capital inefficiency of staking and the liquidity constraints that are available. So I think that paves a nice context to the discussion.
00:05:53.494 - 00:06:29.634, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, no, I think that puts it into perspective for sure. So obviously, you guys are active or the projects are active in that area. So can you tell us a bit more about the project specifically? I sort of have an idea about Bifrost because I've been more Polkadot adjacent, so to say. But, yeah, perhaps also about persistence, one like, what is it that you do? Who are your users? What kind of metrics can you share to kind of assess what you guys are doing and how it's going?
00:06:30.014 - 00:07:05.770, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I think so a little bit maybe of background about persistence as well. So we started building out in 2019. We were building a Cosmos app chain at the time, but for a different purpose to what it serves today. At the time, we wanted to bring real world assets on chain. We all know how difficult that is, and it moves at a pace which is definitely nothing like the crypto, how fast the crypto markets move. Very early on into our development cycle, we realized that this is a very challenging endeavor, and it's going to take years for this to play out.
00:07:05.770 - 00:07:47.410, Speaker A: You know, people in this industry do not have yours, you know, so for us, we wanted to build something that was also close to what people like doing in this industry, which was more along, you know, decentralized finance and playing around with applications that people are concerned with. So around the time of DeFi summer 2020, obviously, Ethereum had insane yields, right? There were like three, four digit APIs that people were farming. At the very least, there were five, five digit yields as well. But let's not go there. So for us, when we saw that and you looked at atom. So we were building in the cosmos ecosystem. Most of the early team members come from the cosmos ecosystem.
00:07:47.410 - 00:08:12.640, Speaker A: They were part of game of stakes, which helped take the cosmos of life, incentivized testnet, all those things. So we come from within the cosmos ecosystem, deep cosmos community members. So for us, we wanted to build in Cosmos. We saw that this is happening in Ethereum. And then at the same time, atom stakers are earning like 810, 12% in staking rewards. And that's just not enough, right? Does not spark any lively conversations. Nothing.
00:08:12.640 - 00:08:35.764, Speaker A: So liquid staking wasn't a very hot thing at the time either. 2020, you know, it's still very new. Lido was going live at the time. We were building liquid staking for Atom, but Cosmos did not have any defi, you know, nothing. There was no osmosis at the time, which is the premier dex of Cosmos, and there was no money market zero. You know, there was no IBC. IBC wasn't live at that time.
00:08:35.764 - 00:09:04.356, Speaker A: IBC went live in June, if I'm not wrong, 2021. So for us to build liquid staking was super challenging. We were like, okay, how do we build this? So we decided to build our own bridge, get it audited, because bridges got hacked left, right. At that time. Actually, bridges weren't getting hacked, though. But we issued STK atom, which is the liquid stake token for atom as an ERC 20 token, and build liquidity for it. On Sushiswap, we saw decent traction.
00:09:04.356 - 00:09:43.276, Speaker A: But obviously, like, as an atom holder, you're earning, like, you know what? You're paying, like, $0.01 in transaction fees, even lesser at times, right? And now if you have to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you have to pay $50, $100 in transaction fee. Peak bull, you know, nobody wants to do that. So we knew that this product had limitations, but it was the only way to go live at the time. So this was done through our application, called PSTEC. PSTEC is the one that choose the liquid stake tokens. But we knew at that time that, okay, the vision for persistence is going to be a special purpose layer, one that looks at liquid stake tokens and does everything around liquid stake tokens on the chain.
00:09:43.276 - 00:10:27.896, Speaker A: So we don't want to be a general purpose layer, one that competes with the likes of Solana near Cosmos hub itself. We want to be focused on liquid staking and liquid staking only. So you first part of that puzzle is to issue lsts. We started doing that on the persistence chain in 2023, January, because until, like, mid 2022, although you could do liquid staking in Cosmos, you couldn't build a non custodial solution, because Cosmos did not have interchange accounts, which we can talk about. It's more on the technical side of things. But without interchange accounts, you could not control an account on the Cosmos hub from another account on another chain, which is what you had to do to make liquid staking and Cosmos work. So in January of 2023, we launched Pstake soon after that, we launched Dexter, which is the Dex that focuses on liquid stake tokens.
00:10:27.896 - 00:11:09.906, Speaker A: So it uses meta stable pools. It has metastable pools that allow for very efficient trading between lsts and native tokens. Makes LP a much better experience. And then the next step, once we have sufficient liquidity, is to move on to a money market, have a money market on the chain and a bunch of other things. But among these things, one other product that we are building on the persistent side is the rest, taking infrastructure for liquid staking tokens in cosmos. So used like LSTs, any LST in cosmos, to lock it up on the persistence chain to secure other chain services in Cosmos. So the idea is very simple, whatever you can do to generate additional yield on top of your liquid stake tokens.
00:11:09.906 - 00:11:14.294, Speaker A: So maximizing yield opportunities with liquid stake tokens is what we do at persistence.
00:11:15.554 - 00:11:33.934, Speaker B: I'll be curious to hear about the restaking part a bit later on, but, yeah, thank you for sharing that. Thibault, can you tell us a bit more about Bifrost? I'm quite familiar, but with you guys have been building and launching a lot of things, and. Yeah. Can you tell us a bit about Bifrost?
00:11:34.954 - 00:12:24.810, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I think now, there's obviously some synergies with persistence in terms of the origination of the idea of the story behind Bifrost. But essentially, the team had a lot of expertise in staking. Right, and before Bifrost was actually even a Kusama parachain, and then becoming obviously a Polkadot parachain at the same time, the team had launched one of the very first, I'd say, first three or four liquid staking solutions for Ethereum, when we were still in proof of work. And that was actually a substantial part of the overall protocols TVL represented. Never closed, I would say the Lidos, but we were there since the inception. So the idea of liquid staking, and then obviously, our focus was still very much around building on top of Polkadot.
00:12:24.810 - 00:13:09.522, Speaker C: We are an Asia based team. Polkadot was very, very hot when Gavin stepped out and pitched it in the east, his favorite place to have some fun. And, yeah, there was a lot of traction around, like, okay, the guy left Ethereum, came to Polkadot, and he's trying to build something, which Ethereum obviously has its challenges and obstacles in regards to scalability and the future. So the team essentially received a substrate web3 builders program as well. And sort of the core tenants, I think, of Bifrost are very much underpinned by the vision of Polkadot. So we're substrate based. So the blockchain framework, which we use Bifrost.
00:13:09.522 - 00:14:32.820, Speaker C: And then I'd say initially, the focus, given that there are narratives, the idea of crowd loans and parachain slot auction and stuff, was very hot. So we essentially had a very specific niche product around the crowd loans, because the crowd loans, similarly to staking, there is this idea of putting down your dot or your kusama to help a team win a slot which would last x amount of months to years, and they would have that lockup. So we did come up with this something called the slot auction liquidity protocol salp, which we were working with many teams looking to launch the parachains around unlocking that liquidity during that lockup, the lease. So that became a very key part to the business whilst we were still having ve live on Ethereum. Back then, obviously, as things started to build out and there was more traction and growth and more teams deploying on both Kusama and Polkadot, we then launched our liquid staking protocol palette SLP on both networks. The idea here, essentially, we can go into the details as to why Polkadot and the synergies between what we see on Polkadot and Cosmos, and the synergies between persistence, Bifrost and being a dedicated liquid staking l one rather than an EVM l one, competing, as Mikael was saying, with the likes of Solana and the others. But the idea was around.
00:14:32.820 - 00:15:11.214, Speaker C: Ok, let's take the hit now in terms of not being so hot to what's being seen on l one's and l two s, but tackle the challenges that we'll see in the future. And what are those tackles? I mean, what are those challenges? We see them today, actually, fracs is going to be its own chain. Using the op stack. Synthetix is going to go towards the op stack as well. We're seeing Makerdao, they're potentially going to their own app chain as well. We're seeing all these different growth and transitions now, because these issues have been now realized. We've had that in the back of our minds, essentially, from the start.
00:15:11.214 - 00:15:40.484, Speaker C: We've realized that user experience and fragmentation around that is huge. Liquidity fragmentation is huge. And then essentially, for certain networks, I mean, as you are very familiar with Polkadot, there is governance, right? You know, decentralized governance, OpenGov and everything. And liquid staking and obviously staked assets play a part in governance. So these are all sort of these different factors that we took into account when sort of building out Bifrost and pushing it forward. So, yeah, I'll stop there for now.
00:15:40.904 - 00:16:03.324, Speaker B: Right, right. Yeah. Lots of things to talk about there. Perhaps I'd be curious, actually, to hear about the synergies that you mentioned that could be there and why you made certain decisions. You mentioned synergies between persistence one and bifrost and things like that. Perhaps you could talk more about that.
00:16:04.344 - 00:16:05.592, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I mean, synergies.
00:16:05.648 - 00:16:05.816, Speaker A: I.
00:16:05.840 - 00:16:42.104, Speaker C: Obviously, I'm not a. I don't know the details of the details of persistence, but obviously, as we know, there's always been this discussion around, you know, Cosmos, Polkadot. Polkadot. And then Cosmos was, to some extent, replicating what Polkadot was looking to do, and then Cosmos coming and saying, oh, actually, we don't have shared security. And now they're working on shared security, which is actually something I'd like Mikkel to sort of explain, mesh security and what's happening there as well. I think that's really fascinating. But essentially, what I mean in terms of synergy is this idea of, like, we are a dedicated app chain, or l one, if you want to call it, leveraging off both Polkadot on our ends and then these guys on the Cosmos side.
00:16:42.104 - 00:17:07.268, Speaker C: And we are providing one service, which is liquid staking. And we're looking at how we can make sure that our liquid staking token is sort of the canonical sort of asset that will be used going forward, which is difficult. And I guess we'll talk about our different strategies and how we see things. But that's the idea. So I think that's where we see things. Obviously, we see things on the Polkadot side. They chose cosmos.
00:17:07.268 - 00:17:19.184, Speaker C: It'd be great to hear why as well. But the idea was about the architecture, the design there, rather than building on Ethereum, like lido or. Or on other chains on that front.
00:17:19.524 - 00:17:38.124, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, perhaps. Mikhail, can you tell us about why you chose cosmos, like, what benefits you see there, but also perhaps the challenges. And Thibault mentioned the meshed security bit not meshed. The security is not meshed.
00:17:38.164 - 00:17:39.224, Speaker C: It's meshed.
00:17:40.404 - 00:17:51.630, Speaker B: And it's sort of different from Polkadot, I guess, which has its own consequences, then. And. Yeah, I'd just be curious to hear about that a bit more from you.
00:17:51.782 - 00:18:44.484, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think Tebow mentioned a lot of points that I agree with also, which is why you choose to build something on a specific chain instead of building everything on Ethereum like everyone else did. I think all of us, like anybody who's been building in Polkadot or in Cosmos, made that bet that, okay, the tech stack at some point is going to matter more than initial hype and liquidity. But again, we don't know if that's true because, you see, with what DyDx has been able to execute, they went down the route of building on Stocknet and then doing really well, and then coming on to their app chain and then slowly trying to become big enough because they already have a user base. They're already big enough. So again, we don't know if the hypothesis that, okay, you want to build in the right place before, you know, it's more tech focused than liquidity. Focus is the right approach. I don't know that.
00:18:44.484 - 00:19:11.156, Speaker A: But for us, it was kind of that reasoning as well. Right? Which is like, back in 2018, 2019. Who was talking about, you know, bridges? Nobody cared about bridges, to be honest. Nobody thought bridges were gonna get hacked ever. You know, like 2020. I remember we were, we were raising one around, and, you know, some of our investors asked us, okay, you're using a bridge to issue SDK atom on the ethereum side. Why do that? Simple questions.
00:19:11.156 - 00:19:36.040, Speaker A: And I remember the investors themselves feeling so comfortable. Yeah, bridges don't get hacked. This is like 2020. But then you fast forward a year and a half and everybody starts seeing things blowing up. But with IBC and with the way Polkadot is built out, it's very different. Right? You don't see those problems because they are built to be able to. They're built to be resilient to bridge hacks and stuff like that.
00:19:36.040 - 00:20:25.520, Speaker A: Right? So again, for us, it was the idea of bridging. It was the idea of, you know, being a sovereign chain, because at the time, again, when we made this decision was purely from a real world asset play, which is, okay, we are having. We are building a commodities marketplace on our marketplace application. Now, these traders, these institutions, they don't want all their information on a public ledger either, right? They want a little bit of privacy. So how do we bake in that privacy? You cannot have that on, you know, if you build on the EVM, right? So those were the, like, factors in our decision making. And, I mean, for us, I do think the decisions were right in terms of the technical aspects. Now, whether they've been right from a liquidity, from a market standpoint, nobody knows that today.
00:20:25.520 - 00:20:36.124, Speaker A: And it's still early to say, but for us, we've kind of heads down been building here like the same as, you know, Tivo said for Bifrost. So it's pretty much the same thing here as well.
00:20:37.304 - 00:20:38.024, Speaker B: Right?
00:20:38.184 - 00:21:27.144, Speaker A: I mean, to answer the second part of what you were asking, which is on the security side. Right? Like, Cosmos has different security mechanisms that shared security. I know. You know, this is something that Polkadot was very big on, and Cosmos kind of picked it up from there. The idea was, again, more along the lines of rest taking, which is what now, rest taking is such a big hype in the ethereum ecosystem, but it's actually an idea that has been taken from different ecosystems. And you could say whether it's from Polkadot, Cosmos, wherever it comes from, these two ecosystems have always been at the forefront of technology and building. So, for example, with interchange security, it allows the entire Cosmos hub validator set to be replicated onto another chain.
00:21:27.144 - 00:22:12.308, Speaker A: So this is interchange security V one, which is called replicated security. So if today you want to launch your own chain, you don't have to go through the hassle of reaching out to 150 evaluators and be like, hey, guys, could you please run a validator node on our chain? And you will need to have delegations in the form of the native token of your chain. You know, none of that. You just have to go to the Cosmos hub and be like, guys, we'll share x amount of revenue that our chain generates in return for the economic security of the entire cosmos, of being replicated onto my new chain. So all the validators in the Cosmos hubspin a valid spin up a valid node on my new chain, and the entire, let's say, the cosmos hubs market cap is four bill. The staked value is, let's say, two and a half bill. The two and a half bill security comes in.
00:22:12.308 - 00:22:38.782, Speaker A: Economic security comes in to secure my new chain. So that's ICS V one. Then you have other versions, ics V two, which is partial set security, where you're like, okay, I don't need $2.5 billion worth of security for my chain. Why do I need that much? Right? Maybe just 500 mil is good enough. So you then convince a few validators in the cosmos hub to run a validator node on your chain, and you're getting security, but in a partial manner. Then you have different forms of, you know, security.
00:22:38.782 - 00:23:10.850, Speaker A: Now, this is ICS, which is a core product offering of the cosmos of itself. Then you have mesh security where you can have, let's say, you know, xprt is persistence is native token. You have XPRT, you have Osmo. You have, you know, for example, UiDX. You could have XPRt staked on the osmosis chain. To secure osmosis, you can have Osmo DyDX staked on the persistence chain to secure the persistence chain. So you can have these different formats where, you know, it's a mesh structure where any asset can be used to secure any other chain within the cosmos ecosystem.
00:23:10.850 - 00:23:57.950, Speaker A: So the collective value, economic security value, keeps on increasing as more assets come into play. So that's a little bit on mesh security. Now you have ethos coming in, bringing security from Ethereum, from eigen layer to cosmos. So, yeah, there's different forms. I do think, although I can, there's pros and cons to all of this, I think ics in itself is not the best model. One is because it doesn't lead too much value accrual to the cosmos hub itself, to the atom token, because why did chains have inflation, high inflation to begin with? Because they didn't generate enough revenue. So if a chain is not generating revenue, how are they going to share 20% of their revenue with the cosmos up and make it sustainable? It's not going to happen again.
00:23:57.950 - 00:24:05.354, Speaker A: The security models are good from theory perspective, from practicality perspective, I don't think Cosmos has cracked it either.
00:24:06.014 - 00:24:56.806, Speaker B: Right, right. I noticed there've been some efforts there in terms of Atom 2.0, and I think it was quite controversial and fights on x going on about that. But perhaps just regarding restaking, because I know you guys also do, restaking is also a part of what you do at persistence or intend to do. And how does that fit into that whole thing? What does that look like? Because, for example, in Polkadot, there's a shared security. So I wouldn't intuitively come up with a way where Bifrost, for example, could do some sort of restaking to bootstrap economic security for other chains, because technically, you can launch parachains and they inherit the economic security of Polkadot. Right.
00:24:56.806 - 00:25:01.606, Speaker B: So I don't know what use case there is for some sort of restaking.
00:25:01.710 - 00:25:08.594, Speaker A: It's still a form of restaking because the dot that is staked on the chain is guarding other chains in some way.
00:25:09.214 - 00:25:38.128, Speaker B: Yeah, but then I wouldn't see why there would need to be a different system next to it where you would, for example, take the liquid staking token, the v dots, maybe, I think, right. And use that to bootstrap some sort of chain. Talk about that. Thibault, is restaking at all something that is relevant to Bifrost and Mikhail? Maybe afterwards you can tell us how restaking fits into your platform.
00:25:38.296 - 00:26:04.322, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I mean, I'm not the restaking expert, and I look forward to. I have a few questions for Mikhail, actually, on that front. But what I think is already fascinating is Etherfi, which is a liquid restaking protocol, has a larger market cap than Lido, which is obviously already quite hilarious in terms of. Just to show you that hype around liquid restaking, which is insane, it sort.
00:26:04.338 - 00:26:12.054, Speaker B: Of feels like the derivative is worth more than the original asset kind of thing, which is something in trad five. And there's a lot of speculation.
00:26:14.234 - 00:26:55.798, Speaker C: I just think in terms of, if you look at the TVL right now of liquid staking, it's about 60 billion, right? The TVL of restaking is about 13 billion, right. And out of the 60 billion, which is, you know, essentially, you know, I would call it half lidos. And there's actually exactly a bit more. There's, you know, there's so much revenue going in and stuff, they've got the monopoly. And then you look at, like Etherfi, which, you know, is. I don't even know if they're potentially the largest in the liquid restaking space, but they have a bigger valuation than Lido, which actually have a product and have a bigger market. I mean, whatever.
00:26:55.798 - 00:28:03.720, Speaker C: That's just to give you a bit of an idea of how hot the narrative is. I live in the east, and a lot of the guys, in terms of the liquidity, the LP's behind, whether the ones signing the checks or the ones actually playing around on Eigen layer and playing around with the lrTs, are coming from Asia rather than from the US. At least those are the discussions I've had with a lot of the VC's. A lot of the whole narratives around liquid restaking and Eigen layer has come from Asia rather than the US as well as the BTC sort of defi l two stuff we're seeing as well, and liquid restaking that we're seeing now on bitcoin defi, which. Anyways, so that's just like to give the audience that everybody an understanding of that liquid restaking and restaking is super interesting. But I think that, you know, as Mikael was saying, like, what ethos are doing is very interesting between Eigen layer and Cosmos. But yeah, I guess coming to your question now regarding Bifrost, I think, look, obviously the idea around restaking is something that we've looked at, given that we do have a liquid staking asset on Ethereum.
00:28:03.720 - 00:28:53.514, Speaker C: So there are things that could be done there directly. Unfortunately, the TVL of our liquid staking on Ethereum has dramatically decreased given that we were one of the very first liquid staking protocols to allow withdrawals. Just after Chappella, which to an extent made sense that other people were going for more attractive options. But we are talking to teams around how potentially we could look at this security aggregation between different proof of stake networks. We have looked at the guys at Babylon, the bitcoin side, and how they're potentially looking at securing other pos with bitcoin collateral. They're doing that obviously with a few other chains right now. So we are looking at the utility and use cases around how our assets could be used within that.
00:28:53.514 - 00:29:07.794, Speaker C: But it's not something that we're actively pushing forward and it's part of our product offering. It's more about synergies and whether or not there is value to add on that front and not increasing any sort of risks or whatever.
00:29:08.414 - 00:29:30.384, Speaker B: Right, interesting. So I got you now, I think. So you were saying in terms of Etherfi. Etherfi is a restaking focus project. And the tokens market cap is higher than the market cap of the token of Lido, which is a liquid staking project and has a way higher TVL, right?
00:29:30.464 - 00:29:33.344, Speaker C: Basically. That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.
00:29:33.504 - 00:29:36.924, Speaker B: It's the meta, that's the narrative you gotta be in restaking.
00:29:37.624 - 00:30:14.642, Speaker C: I know man. And I mean, I've got to say, look, I mean like, as I said, I don't know too much, so I give a bit my thought and then obviously Mikhail, you know, please jump in. And I guess I have questions that will come from that. But like, you know, LRT's and LST's, you know, for the audience. So liquid restaking tokens and liquid staking tokens, like they're going after the same market essentially, right? It's just a different product solving a different problem essentially. I think LSts, you know, they're homogeneous and I do, you know, they're doing the same things in different ways, you know, they're securing the network and they don't really compete that much on yield. It's more about like the utility of the asset, how much it can be used and its moneyness across, you know, across defi and on chain finance.
00:30:14.642 - 00:31:01.764, Speaker C: I think on the liquid restaking side, where I'm really keen to hear your perspective, Mikael is around the. The Avss, right? So I mean, I guess maybe, you know, we can maybe give some sort of context to that. Yeah, you know, I think him being the expert, he can, you know, break that down. But I'm keen to understand like how you guys look at that, the AVss. Because as I just said earlier, like you're on the opposite side of the spectrum, right? LRts are not heterogeneous, right. In terms of design, in terms of operations, in terms of their underlying, the collateral can be different. In terms of which lsts you're using, you could accept a bunch of lsts plus the base asset, and there's a different selection method around the AVss and all of that.
00:31:01.764 - 00:31:09.824, Speaker C: So it's very different. So I'm really keen to understand first, like, your views about restaking and liquid restaking, and then like, how you're seeing the market.
00:31:10.444 - 00:32:03.790, Speaker A: Yeah, very good questions. I think maybe, you know, taking it step by step, I would maybe start off with a little bit of clarification also in terms of what we are doing, right? Like, our objective is not to issue the liquid restake token. That's the most important thing. So there's liquid staking, there's rest taking, and there's liquid restake token issuance, right? So for us, the objective is very much like what Eigen layer is doing within Ethereum where they pool security. And then however, that security, whatever the demand for that security is, right, Eigen layer allows people to pull that security from the shared security pool. The question with liquid, again, I do agree with you that the markets are very weird in the sense that although on a long enough time horizon, markets do become efficient. Liquid restake tokens.
00:32:03.790 - 00:32:35.034, Speaker A: Having ether five being valued more than Lido, again, not a financial advisor, but I would say that's just nuts. That's crazy because Lido has been going at it for the longest amount of time. It's probably the most secure product out there, has had tens of audits on every single upgrade they have. And you look at Etherfi, it's the hype around liquidity stake tokens. That's it. There's nothing more to that. Now, I started talking about it when I was previously speaking as well.
00:32:35.034 - 00:33:23.292, Speaker A: The Avss or, you know, the demand for security, where does that come from? That comes from chains that want security. Now, who wants security? The question is like, do chains even want security that much? You know, is economic security that big of a thing as well? I do think it's similar to the bridge part that we talked about where in the past we thought, oh, bridge hacks are not going to happen. It's not like that has never happened. And now people say, oh, you know, economic security hacks are not going to happen either. But at some point it may start happening. So you have to be prepared for that in the sense that, okay, you want to be prepared for a situation where you know, somebody comes in, does a governance attack, has a lot of your tokens, chains, tokens so can pull out. You know, if your chain has 100 million Tvl and 20 mil worth of chain security, you're in a vulnerable spot then.
00:33:23.292 - 00:34:03.948, Speaker A: So there will be demand for security. But how much can, you know, like if, let's say there's a new chain that launches and wants to borrow security from a shared security from a restaking pool, how much are they going to pay for it? That is my bigger concern, which is where I think it's not going to be sustainable. Now, a lot of people, I've heard people say that Eigen layer is going to add another 3% yield to Ethereum staking yields. I don't know where that 3% yield is going to come from, whether it's going to come from inflationary tokens. So if a new chain launches and does 20% in inflation and gives away that 20% inflation to the restaking pool, uh, you know, the quality of the yield.
00:34:04.036 - 00:34:06.276, Speaker B: The quality of the stability of the yield. Yeah.
00:34:06.380 - 00:34:39.190, Speaker A: Correct. So I don't think that's going to be very sustainable for us. The objective, and again, the reason why we are building the rest, taking product as well, is very unique to. It's not why Eigen layer is building, you know, restaking in Ethereum, their idea is, in a way, it's about, oh, there's so many services that are going to launch that will need the security for us. It's about, how do we cater to atom holders, for example, because atom holders are very unique. They don't care about using, you know, atom or atom lsts as collateral on a money market and, you know, borrow against it. They're not legions.
00:34:39.190 - 00:35:07.793, Speaker A: What they are most comfortable with is staking, you know, the risks that they understand best is slashing. That's, that's all like, oh, if there's a downtime downtime slashing of like 0.01%, there's a double stash penalty of 5%. I'm okay with that. 5% slashing risk. Now, if you do restaking, you can allow people to earn additional yield on top of their liquid staking yields. And this is still, the risks are still the same.
00:35:07.793 - 00:35:42.984, Speaker A: You're not creating, obviously, there's another layer of risk, for sure, but it's a type of risk that the atom holder is comfortable with. So that's where we come from. That's the idea. Again, there will be different types of AVss, I believe. I think, you know, in today's context, I do think there'll be just newer chains? Who would want to launch an app chain? And what would want to borrow security? But the demand for security is going to be high. But the supply side is so big today. You have ethos, you have Babylon, you have, you know, the cosmos hub itself offering ics.
00:35:42.984 - 00:36:24.112, Speaker A: So I think in tomorrow's context, it's what we'll see is consumer chains, chains consuming security, consuming security from different avenues, not just one. You're already starting to see that now. By the way, like, Cosmos hub is going to be secured, is going to borrow security from bitcoin that Babylon has, for example. But Cosmos hub is in itself in a business of, you know, supplying security. So cosmos have as its own security, will borrow security from Babylon and then will provide it to ten other consumer chains. Similarly, every consumer chain would want various, you know, security come from various different angles. They would want it to come from liquid restake tokens.
00:36:24.112 - 00:36:48.928, Speaker A: They'd want it to come from, you know, like BTC security, ETH security through ethos. So I do think there'll be demand, but those would be like, chains within Cosmos. That's our target market. But the most important thing for us is to offer like, you know, sustainable, but like, comfortable yields to. To LST holders in cosmos. Because you don't see Cosmos. LST is picking up as much as, you know, you see in ethereum or Solana.
00:36:48.928 - 00:36:58.816, Speaker A: It's such a difficult market. When you look at. And it's not just about. We can argue that, oh, you know, there's. Cosmos doesn't have a defi ecosystem. It does, actually. Today.
00:36:58.816 - 00:37:11.014, Speaker A: It has a decent, decently good defi ecosystem. Why are people still not using it? It's because the holders, they don't care about using those products. You have to build for those users, for those older. So that's kind of what we are doing.
00:37:11.354 - 00:37:11.930, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:12.042 - 00:37:13.274, Speaker C: So if I can jump in.
00:37:13.354 - 00:37:14.134, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:37:14.554 - 00:37:47.160, Speaker C: I thought. I thought something. I mean, look, obviously, I'm a user. I mean, I'm obviously playing around with Cosmos and stuff like that. But I think what's still quite interesting with Cosmos is obviously the guys behind, you know, so many finance osmosis. These guys are somewhat driving, you know, defi and sort of innovation and, you know, some sort of opportunity sets as well for sort of to revive cosmos. And, I mean, I think where you guys were quite lucky, when I say you guys, I mean, cosmos as an ecosystem is that, you know, airdrops, which are super, super, you know, hot for the retail user and I guess, average user as well.
00:37:47.160 - 00:38:30.614, Speaker C: Is a lot of atom sort of stakers were sort of somewhat, you know, rewarded, you know, generous and very well performing airdrops, you know, the likes of Celestia. And then obviously, you know, that's become sort of a great way to bring people in as well. And I do have to say that there is a lot of cool products on cosmos. So, I mean, I think we stand in a sort of similar situation on Polkadot, as you make mentioning, Mikael. I think within Polkadot, and this is something we're trying to break down as much as we can. It is that mentality around just staking and how just staking adds absolutely no value to the ecosystem. Of course, it guarantees more security.
00:38:30.614 - 00:39:04.794, Speaker C: And when you have the optionality of having a liquid staking protocol, you should be as a de facto measure, potentially considering the liquid staking protocol there. Because I think the security guarantees of a liquid staking protocol, especially on our ends, are pretty clear. I think the real problems are potentially consensus attack or slashing. That's the big one. As you mentioned, the teams have been going for three, four years now. There's audits, et cetera, et cetera. So I would argue, like, every ecosystem has obviously its own issues.
00:39:04.794 - 00:39:44.194, Speaker C: But yeah, on the Polkadot side, if I have to bring the conversation back to Polkadot, is really the idea around having to educate the users and also having more people build interesting options and opportunities there. Whereas we've seen, as you said, dydx, they moved to you guys, Celestia, obviously, they're tidy knit to Cosmos babylon as well. The bitcoin whole narrative as well, and Eigen layer have decided to work very clearly with IBC. And ethos is one of the first actively validated services leveraging off that as well. It's all quite interesting.
00:39:46.094 - 00:40:00.452, Speaker A: The most interesting thing, when you say this ethos is one of the first AVss, the craziest thing is the first AV's is actually a service to provide security to other chains, you know, that borrows from it.
00:40:00.548 - 00:40:01.308, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:40:01.436 - 00:40:03.664, Speaker A: There's some irony in there.
00:40:07.524 - 00:40:08.904, Speaker C: All about narratives.
00:40:09.884 - 00:40:51.264, Speaker B: Gotta keep printing the inflation and provide the yield, right. Perhaps it would make sense to talk about the use cases of these liquid staking tokens that you provide. I think that's something that matters as well. Is it only the optionality that you give a holder? Which would be okay. Now, my staked dot, let's say, is liquid, and I could technically sell it in a pool and have quicker access to this liquidity? Or is there more to it? Other use cases? Yeah. Can you talk about that a bit.
00:40:51.564 - 00:40:53.252, Speaker C: Is that for me? Right, okay.
00:40:53.308 - 00:40:53.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:55.484 - 00:41:33.716, Speaker C: Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll start it off then. I mean, I definitely think, look, as we said earlier, right, the idea behind liquid staking is really to tackle the issues around capital, efficiency, or inefficiency of staking and liquidity. So lowest hanging fruit is really that, right? So you're obviously going to see having access to your liquidity. So swapping in and out. Obviously, sometimes there is a queue, which I would say on our end is faster than the 28 day window of Polkadot. We've recently seen that with amounts of, I would say about 700,000 to a million dollars that could be redeemed in a couple of days without a fee.
00:41:33.716 - 00:42:18.496, Speaker C: Not swapping, but just redeeming via our queuing mechanism. I definitely think that liquidity pools are important on Dex is stable imms. And then I think the biggest use case is obviously, at least what we've seen and we've seen on Ethereum, we've seen in Solana, and we've seen it in other ecosystems, is around leverage staking. So obviously looping the collateral borrowing against the base asset and then sort of accumulating your staking rewards and leveraging on that. And then as well, there's just basically just lending and borrowing. There are people out there who actually need to get permissionless, decentralized lending and borrowing of an asset for another, for an actual real life use case. And we've seen that.
00:42:18.496 - 00:43:04.134, Speaker C: So I think if you look at the biggest DeFi categories, we're very much in liquid staking being the first restaking in the top ten. And then there's obviously lending, which is just underneath liquid staking. Those are really the big ones. I think on our end, if we are to speak specific to Polkadot, we are trying to activate these very primitive use cases, which are not even present yet. You are familiar with that. On our end, it's really around the utility of liquid staking assets not only on Bifrost, but leveraging off XCM and seeing how we can use that asset across the ecosystem. Trying to bootstrap defi TDL, not only on Polkadot substrate, or on EVM, on Astar and Moonbeam and the others.
00:43:04.134 - 00:44:04.556, Speaker C: And we've seen some really cool stuff. If I just give you one example, Hydra, which has now become a very important hub on Polkadot, they provided a really cool and seamless way for people who are holding dot or v dot, the liquid stake derivative of dot, and being able to DCA into other long tail acids in the ecosystem. With their dots staking rewards, which I think is quite compelling as we move towards core time and away from the parachain models. VDOT would be potentially a currency for purchasing and trading core time. But also, why not even use the dot staking rewards for teams to be able to buy future block space? I think we are trying to go ahead and allow the ecosystem to interact with these very basic use cases that we're seeing elsewhere. I guess on Polkadot taking a bit more time. I don't think Polkadot is super, super sexy compared to other ecosystems in terms.
00:44:04.580 - 00:44:05.388, Speaker A: Of what can be done.
00:44:05.436 - 00:45:05.862, Speaker C: But that's something we're trying to change as well. With a few teams and then stable coins, we're seeing that Hydro DX will also push for a stable coin in the next quarter, where potentially the collateral asset behind that would be a yield bearing asset like a liquid staking token. So yeah, that's sort of the things we're up to. But I think maybe the last point I wanted to mention before hanging off to Mikael is really around Bifrost. I think where we're slightly different to other liquid staking protocols out there is we've been able to ensure that dot, which is an important asset within the ecosystem, specifically on the governance side, OpenGov, we've been able to make sure that people who have their dot staked and with their receipt token, VDOT, they're still able to use that dot in Opengov. So VDOT is your voucher token around liquidity and still accumulating staking rewards whilst being able to use it in DeFi, but also has the ability to retain its governance rights. And you can use vdot in governance.
00:45:05.862 - 00:45:23.964, Speaker C: So you're accumulating the staking rewards, you're locking it just for the governance, for the referendum, but you can do that as well. And I don't think that's something which any other protocol out there has been able to. To do in regards to the governance side of things, which are also quite important for certain ecosystems, not just for.
00:45:24.084 - 00:45:43.564, Speaker A: I think nobody has done it for any other ecosystem as well. This is a feature we've looked into very deeply in cosmos. Very difficult to build out given the nature of the assets being on so many chains, different pools. So it's definitely very complicated. So I think that's a very interesting feature to have. Yeah.
00:45:44.184 - 00:45:45.072, Speaker B: Cool, cool.
00:45:45.168 - 00:46:36.326, Speaker A: I can maybe go ahead and share from our side, obviously very similar. I think we have a list of protocols where we are integrated, but SDK Atom, for example, is one LST that we issue. We also issue SDK, OsMo, SDKDYDX, and we also want to go after other assets within cosmos, mostly strategic. Like, for example, bad kids are most hyped nfts that come from Cosmos, but they are issued on the stargaze chain. So doing liquid staking for starts, for example, for us, if you're a cosmos based chain and you do not mess around with the staking logic of the chain, we can support that chain, liquid staking for that chain in less than a week. Even the week is more for us to do some testing and make sure we are doing things properly. But it's very quick for from our side to support other chains.
00:46:36.326 - 00:47:29.326, Speaker A: So we want to go after chains that have strategic alignment to us, where we see the cultural alignment, like, which is in the case of stargaze, or where we see, you know, synergies. So SDK Atom, for example, is integrated onto Dexter, which is our own Dex. You know, it's on astroport, which is the Dex on neutron, which is a Cosmos subconsumer chain. We have SDK Atom, liquidity and osmosis. SDK Atom is available on Mars protocol, again, similar to what Tiber talked about, which is looping of your collateral and then leverage. Liquid staking is what we call it, to generate higher staking rewards. And then you have shade protocol, where you can, again, it's the secret network ecosystem, so privacy preserving ecosystem, where you can do privacy reserved stuff with their liquid stake datum.
00:47:29.326 - 00:48:02.642, Speaker A: You have, you know, STK atom can be used to mint stable coins. So stable coins like silk, which is a, you know, stable coin, again, issued by shade protocol in the secret network ecosystem. So, you know, privacy preserving stablecoin. We have other stable coins in cosmos IsT, for example, inter protocol built by agoric. The proposal for enabling SDK atom, you know, as a collateral asset to mint ist, is going to be live very soon. The work, major chunk of the work is done. It's available in the Kujira ecosystem.
00:48:02.642 - 00:48:41.104, Speaker A: So, like, again, SDK atom, for example, is integrated pretty much everywhere in cosmos. You know, the perps integration with levana is waiting one chain upgrade on our side, which is going to happen in the first week of April. So the use cases that you could cover, there's a broad spectrum of use cases for lsts. They're all there. The one big use case that we want to build, not just for lsts that we issue ourselves, but also LST issued by any other protocol within cosmos, whether it's Milky Way for milk, any. You have St. Osmo any of these assets can be restaked on the persistence chain to create additional.
00:48:41.104 - 00:49:15.904, Speaker A: That's one big use case we want to build ourselves. And then if there's a liquid restaking protocol that wants to build on top of persistence, they can do that and issue an LRT. So those are the different use cases we are looking at. And I think even with these current use cases that we have, it doesn't change the user behavior or, you know, at the end of the day, it's who holds atoms and these other tokens. They decide what they want to do with it, whether they want to use these different products or not. I see that there are interesting opportunities within cosmos to use these products. Not enough appetite yet.
00:49:15.904 - 00:50:00.988, Speaker A: So, like, you know, TBA, you said Polkadot is not the most sexy ecosystem right now. I do think Cosmos, again, Cosmos is a sexy ecosystem to build an app chain, and it's a sexy ecosystem if you want to build your own app chain and you want to say, oh, I'm not affiliated with the Cosmos hub, right. You have say doing that, say it does not market it, as, you know, part of the Cosmos family. Neither does injective. But they've all leveraged that whatever they've built, the tech stack is still the tech stack that they've leveraged from the cosmos ecosystem. So to build an app chain, you can do that, and it'll still be sexy if you keep some distance. But assets like Atom, you know, even Osmo, haven't done really well so far.
00:50:00.988 - 00:50:28.352, Speaker A: But I do think that's going to change at some point in the near future. Right. So. Because there are so many things happening now with Atom boss, for example, protocol owned liquidity, if you want that, Cosmos Hub has a big enough community pool. If you want to use the community pool, atom for something, you can request for it by participating in Atom boss. So there are different exciting pieces that are also coming into play very soon. There's very exciting new products like ls that are going to launch very soon.
00:50:28.352 - 00:50:43.384, Speaker A: So there's too many things happening in cosmos. It's just that the consolidated push that you need to really have the ecosystem proper, that's still missing a little bit. But the moment you get that, it's all going to be like, wow, why did this not happen earlier?
00:50:44.084 - 00:51:17.324, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that, actually. And I think similarly, we've seen the same thing as Polkadot like stock with Madara Polkadot SDK. We've looked at avail da using substrate Cardano as well. So the tech is there. It's just whether or not you want to associate yourself to that name tag, because potentially they might say, well, 2019 was cool, it was the hot play in town, but we're in 2024 now, and what the hell is going on there? I mean, I guess we are fine. We're still very much Polkadot aligned. We're leveraging off the security and obviously the resources available.
00:51:17.324 - 00:52:08.044, Speaker C: We still think that there's a lot of intellectual capital there. It's just a question about working together. We've seen now a big of a shift in the treasury governance. There's been more activism and more active uses of treasury funds. I mean, I'll just briefly say, like, we've successfully requested a liquidity loan by the dot treasury, which was about 500,000 dot, where we were requesting, like, look, guys, we need 500,000 dot for sort of liquidity for v dot and dot, so that the exchanging and swapping of the asset is done sort of very seamlessly. It's going to be repaid, the loan will be repaid, plus the staking rewards on that dot back to the treasury. We're seeing Hydro DX asking for a million dot incentives, which they'll be using in terms of v dot, and using the dot staking rewards for their pools.
00:52:08.044 - 00:52:29.924, Speaker C: So I guess the point I'm saying is, to one extent, the tech is there, to another extent, it's for projects as well to kick start more of that engagement. But then, more importantly is you need to be on top of the right narratives. And I think at the end of the day, that's something which we may have not been so good at as a whole collectively in Polkadot.
00:52:30.384 - 00:52:57.604, Speaker B: Right. Thank you for sharing that. As I know you guys have a hard stop soon. I would really like to talk about risks as well, because I think that's important to viewers, too, and perhaps something that can be overlooked a bit just to kick it off. I mean, for example, you can play this derivative game, right, which sort of a liquid staking token is a derivative of the. Of the staked token. You can play this kind of into infinity.
00:52:57.604 - 00:53:51.380, Speaker B: You can create derivative on derivative on derivative. And we kind of have seen that in tradfi, right, in 2008. And sometimes it feels like we are rebuilding the same thing in web3. I mean, you got Eigen layer, then the restaking token and airdrops, and everyone's farming. So people can fall for this illusion. I think that value is created from thin air, and they're sort of unlocking new capital when they aren't, because the underlying asset exists only once, right, for example, Warren Buffett, a quote of his on derivatives was financial weapons of mass destruction. So especially when it comes to leverage, it can be tricky, right? So for example, one thing I'd be interested to hear about from YouTube is also like the leverage staking.
00:53:51.380 - 00:54:44.004, Speaker B: Now you can have a one click way to add kind of leverage into the equation which carries risks. How do you make sure that you manage this and users are aware of it? And then the other thing is, how liquid are your LST markets or pools? So let's say if the token is used for leverage, your staking, you receive the liquid staking token, you use it as collateral for a loan on a lending protocol. Let's say there's some sort of market shock. VDOT has. In this case, the liquid staking token has to be liquidated, but the market is not liquid enough. There's no buyers and there's then a substantial loss that's incurred because of that. So just your thoughts on leverage, liquidity and contagion risks, both of you, perhaps TiVo, you can go first.
00:54:44.584 - 00:55:52.664, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I mean, I'll take a step back because I think there's been a lot of like confusion here. So I mean, LSD's right, as a marketing like play, as in on the term LSD, I think that was really nice and catchy, very sexy. It was cool, a bit silly, but yeah. But I think essentially liquid collective, which is a collective of parties within the staking world, alluvial, a few others came out and said, look, guys, we need to be taken seriously and we need to have some sort of definition which works so that when we go to Washington or whatever, the regulatory bodies can understand that if we go in and say liquid staking derivative, well, that's going to just kill us, right? Because they're going to obviously associate that to derivatives that we see in traffic. So they've gone along the lines of lsts, which we've changed now. So these receipt tokens, I think one thing to firstly understand, I mean, when you look at just the definition of what derivatives are, I mean, they're contracts, right, between two or more parties, okay? And there's an underlying asset, but in most cases it's a group of assets or it can be a benchmark or whatever, but it's between two or more parties.
00:55:52.664 - 00:56:51.154, Speaker C: And I think that the misconception there is when you are looking at liquid staking tokens like, yes, it's the user and you've got the protocol in itself. You could say the protocol is the risk but essentially that's the risk that you take in any sort of investment setting. Then it's a question of the team. Have you done your due diligence? Have they basically done robust audits? How long have they been in the market for? What's that track record? What's the liquidity? What's the overall TVL and all of that stuff? I think that the derivatives to liquid staking tokens is completely wrong. So that sort of should put an end to that sort of, I think longstanding reasoning or whatever, as it's not a contract in that same way now for sure. Like if there is a market shock or something, there is obviously there's going to be a lot of people who are going to walk out the exit at the same time. And that's when you know, the design mechanisms of these different protocols are different.
00:56:51.154 - 00:57:35.742, Speaker C: So yeah, having more liquidity is obviously important. So I think that's the first sort of bit of context in regards to how I think that this thought about derivatives and lsts is sort of misleading in regards to leverage staking. I mean, leverage staking in itself, I guess this strategy is not new. It's been done on the ethereum side for a while where you're just trying to leverage up your staking yield and you need for it to make sense and for it to still be in the money and not be paying more borrowing costs than the staking yield that you're inherently getting. I think where we're different, and I think this is one thing we wanted to do. So the product itself is called loop stake. And the idea is one click.
00:57:35.742 - 00:58:20.446, Speaker C: So what we mean by that is everything in terms of managing your position, your loan to value the flash loans and everything, all the mechanisms behind the, the guidelines and the risk framework is very much done in the backend and it's coded. And we've done it in a way where a retail user obviously has to understand the risks of leverage, but the leverage parameters have not been done in a degen way where you're looking to be blown out. We've been quite risk averse on that front. I think the idea here was basically say, look guys, leverage staking is not new, it's something that's existed. However, how we're coming on about it is very different. In the same way that we want to have a world one click product where the lending and the borrowing mechanism is done in the back end. That's the protocol itself which is dealing.
00:58:20.446 - 00:58:58.024, Speaker C: All you have to basically do is you have to provide the base asset and then you can set your parameters and it's done very transparently in terms of what is the staking yield, what is the simulation of what is currently the borrowing rate and where does it make sense? We have some guidelines in there in regards to assure that users understand the risk and they're not liquidated or they get rugged, whatever. So that was sort of like the key product discussions we had before sort of launching and going forward with this product. So, yeah, I mean, I'll stop that. I don't know if I've covered everything and if Mikael, you want to jump in as well. I think you guys do something similar as well.
00:58:58.364 - 00:59:37.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I do agree with everything you've just said. I generally see that misconception in terms of the derivative and the liquid stake token aspect itself. Again, I think you can keep creating newer, newer liquid stake tokens, liquid restake tokens tomorrow. There's another layer on top of it. I do think at the end of the day that risk sits with, at least the major chunk of risk sits at the base protocol layer, which is the staking at the underlying layer. If the peers chain itself is attacked, that would affect every layer of this thing. But on the flip side, the first layer may not affect the second layer or the third layer, right? If you come from top to bottom.
00:59:37.300 - 01:00:53.556, Speaker A: So again, also depends on like for example, in the case of restaking. Now a liquid restaking protocol may be very risk averse, right? Because if you're, you know, if you're running a strategy where you secure five avss, provides a currency, five avss, these generate accumulative of 10% yield, but you can secure 20 and the yield becomes twelve and a half percent. Now would that make sense for you to go from five to 20 to just get that two and a half percent additional yield? So it all depends on, because then you have, like you're taking slashing risks on 20 different avss, right? So every AV's that gets large, you're getting slashes also, again, like the risks you can still mitigate at every layer of, you know, of the, whatever you call it, you know, every layer of the stack. And yeah, I think there are risks for sure. I do think liquid stake tokens at this point in the market cycle, they have established themselves to be fairly resilient. Unless there's an infinite mint attack that happens, which is the biggest risk with any liquid staking, liquid rest taking protocol restaking, we are yet to see how that's going to play out. Every cycle we see something like, for example, people can argue that that comes with a lot of risks.
01:00:53.556 - 01:01:19.480, Speaker A: Also, it's a very smart product. But there are people who say that, okay, you know what? If Tina's open interest is above a certain percentage of the market, then would you be able to unwind a position, whatnot? So different risks. I do think these products all make sense in the current stage that they are. But again, the more degenerative stuff that you try to do with it, that's where the risks become, like, you know, contagion risks.
01:01:19.672 - 01:01:20.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:20.032 - 01:02:12.044, Speaker C: Just gotta be. Can I just add, I would say also, one thing to just consider is that, I mean, if we still, we talk about liquid staking, liquid restaking, you know, given that it was part of the topic of the call today, I mean, liquid staking, you're looking at two underlying correlated assets to some extent, right? There is, like, clear correlation between the two. And I would say that then it's a question of the user understanding which one you're favoring in terms of its design, in terms of liquid staking protocols. But then also, more importantly, is it's down to risk preference. I wouldn't necessarily go into the LRTs without understanding the AVSs, the designs, you know, what's being used as collateral there in terms of the underlying LRT design. And then potentially, I wouldn't be looking at using LRTs as collateral on whatever. So I think there's vanilla, and then there's obviously more exotic stuff.
01:02:12.044 - 01:02:51.394, Speaker C: But I think liquid staking, in essence, as we spoke since the beginning, I think it's a question of if there's a market event, if there's slashing, and if there's consensus attacks, those are sort of the prominent issues. And then, of course, there might be deep risks on specific liquidity pools and stuff like that. But the rehypothecation of assets is something that is obviously very common. But then again, I think the beauty of obviously, what we're working on in terms of on chain finance is the idea of the ledger, the transparency around that, your counterparties, and being able to track that as well. And the rules were just set within the protocols as well.
01:02:52.014 - 01:03:36.784, Speaker B: Right, lovely. Well, lovely exchange of ideas, guys. I hope there will be more collaboration between Cosmos based and Polkadot based projects in the future. And as we all have sort of like the same vision of a decentralized, interoperable future. So I'm sure there are a lot of synergies to be had, and it doesn't have to be zero sum. On that note, Mikhail, to wrap up, perhaps what can kind of cosmos learn from Polkadot and Thibault? Maybe you can share your thoughts on the other in the other direction and just for the viewers as well, if you want to get involved and start liquid staking, if you're an atom user or dot user or want to become one, we'll put the links to persistence one and Bifrost in the show notes.
01:03:36.824 - 01:04:00.922, Speaker A: For you to get started, I think, first of all, thank you. Sohal. Very nicely hosted. Call. Really enjoyed this. So I would say one thing that cosmos can definitely learn from Polkadot is more along the lines of pushing value to the chain and the token and everything as well. I think Polkadot definitely does a better job than Cosmos at that.
01:04:00.922 - 01:04:29.054, Speaker A: Cosmos is all about, you know, everything else, but teams do not work towards one unified mission. I think Polkadot still has a lot of teams that work towards, you know, doing well for Dot. You know, Cosmos has a lot of teams that want to do well for themselves and not for atom. So a little bit of that would definitely make. Make a big difference, I think. I mean, people would argue that Dot has the same problem, but based on what I've seen, it's slightly better than atom, for sure.
01:04:29.174 - 01:05:20.610, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I would take the opposite side there, and I'd say we do need some teams to lead the ecosystem, unfortunately. I mean, I don't have to put my Bifrost hat here, but I can speak as a user. We've seen teams which were very successful in terms of parachain auctions when they were hot, the likes of parallel finance, Acala, who were leading, I would say, the narrative around Polkadot, and there was a lot of hype, specifically on the investor side. I think they just unfortunately did not handle the hype very well. And they've sort of somewhat provided a bit of a difficult path ahead for us, given that some names were brand names, if you want to call them. So I think it requires some teams to lead the forefront of that. And I think that's what we're trying to do on the liquid staking defi side, Hydro DX as well.
01:05:20.610 - 01:05:57.510, Speaker C: And we're seeing other exciting teams on Polkadot who are trying to leave certain narratives. So I think what we need, essentially, is to learn from Cosmos in terms of some teams leading and as well, bringing some sort of experimentation as well. And I think Cosmos have done very well in terms of that community and the tribalism there in regard to experimentation, and also, I would say, bringing certain narratives to the cosmos sort of forefront. You know, we gave the example of Babylon, you know, Eigen layer as well. I mean, whether it adds, it adds value, fundamentally, I don't really care as long as it brings more people in and more teams to build between these two sort of ecosystems is where the value is.
01:05:57.582 - 01:05:58.470, Speaker B: Guys, thank you so much.
01:05:58.502 - 01:05:59.110, Speaker C: Happy to.
01:05:59.222 - 01:05:59.654, Speaker B: Anytime.
01:05:59.694 - 01:06:02.614, Speaker C: Again, thanks for your time, guys. Have a good one.
