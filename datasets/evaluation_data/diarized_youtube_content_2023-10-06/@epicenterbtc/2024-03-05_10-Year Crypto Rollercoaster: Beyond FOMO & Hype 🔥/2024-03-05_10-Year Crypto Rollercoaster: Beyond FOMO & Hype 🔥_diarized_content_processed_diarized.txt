00:00:00.120 - 00:00:08.294, Speaker B: Do you look back sometimes and think like, oh, we got that horribly wrong, or, like, you know, in terms of, like, how the market turned out or how narratives played out?
00:00:08.334 - 00:00:59.584, Speaker A: I don't know if it's so much about getting wrong, but there are a lot of things that we were, I particularly was excited about that I thought would turn out differently. Right. Looking back to the early days of epicenter, I think I, and I think Brian would also feel the same way, felt that bitcoin adoption would happen much quicker. I think that has turned out to be not so much the case, at least in most western countries. And then I think there's also enterprise adoption, right? Like in around, like, 2016, let's say, to like, 2019, there was this prevailing narrative that companies of all sorts and mostly large enterprise would adopt blockchain for all sorts of use cases like process optimization and data notarization. And I co founded a startup around that, that period that was doing just that. And there were a lot of companies doing that at the time, and I think that also really hasn't played out.
