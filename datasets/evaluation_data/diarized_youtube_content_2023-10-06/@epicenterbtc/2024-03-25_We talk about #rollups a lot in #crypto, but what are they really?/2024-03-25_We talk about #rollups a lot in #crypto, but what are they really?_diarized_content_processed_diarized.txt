00:00:00.200 - 00:00:26.374, Speaker B: Let's just chat about Stacker. I mean I went on your website, it says as a headline sort of micro roll ups to scale web three applications. I think there hasn't been one headline on a crypto project where I was like left somewhat confused. There's always buzzwords in it and I think for a lot of people it can be a bit difficult to unpack. One of the things maybe to kick it off with is what are actually roll ups.
00:00:26.454 - 00:00:37.830, Speaker A: Roll ups are basically like execution environments that are lifted from the main chain. It kind of helps reduce congestion and reduce the load of the parent chain and move the execution part away from it.
00:00:37.902 - 00:00:38.726, Speaker UNK: So you're doing.
00:00:38.750 - 00:00:49.918, Speaker A: Most of the transactions off chain and then it creates an aggregate proof or some sort of combination of things which then goes back to the parent chain and you can share the security.
00:00:50.006 - 00:00:50.830, Speaker UNK: From it and you can.
00:00:50.862 - 00:00:56.854, Speaker A: Actually prove whatever happened on that execution there. So that's like the very high level overview of rollups.
