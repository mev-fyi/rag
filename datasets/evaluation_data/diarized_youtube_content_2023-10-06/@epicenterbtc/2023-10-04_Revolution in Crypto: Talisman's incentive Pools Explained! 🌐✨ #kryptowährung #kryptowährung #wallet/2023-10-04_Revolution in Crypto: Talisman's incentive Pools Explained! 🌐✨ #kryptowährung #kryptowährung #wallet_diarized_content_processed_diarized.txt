00:00:00.240 - 00:00:39.902, Speaker A: Well, speaking of funding, do you want to talk about something called incentive pools? We recently submitted a referenda on Polkadot. It's very different, like a conventional funding proposal that you've seen in the Polkadot treasury recently. Most funding proposals kind of structured in a way where you just say, here are the costs that I have and this is the outcome that I'm going to get, and you just basically ask for the funds to cover your costs. Instead, we thought, how does talisman operate internally? We look for top line results. Number of transactions that have been facilitated via our software is one result. Number of funds that we've successfully managed to migrate into the polklit ecosystem from another ecosystem. That's another really important result.
00:00:39.902 - 00:00:59.054, Speaker A: We think product companies should be judged on those kinds of results, kind of results based funding. We should be rewarded in proportion to the result that you get. And so incentive pools is like the mechanism which we have proposed is a way to do this. And we've also proposed an incentive pool for talisman as like the first implementation of this mechanism.
