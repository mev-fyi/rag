00:00:00.160 - 00:00:19.198, Speaker B: Mikhail, to wrap up, perhaps, what can kind of cosmos learn from Polkadot and Thibault? Maybe you can share your thoughts. So in the other direction, one thing that Cosmos can definitely learn from Polkadot is more along the lines of, like, you know, pushing value to the chain and the token and everything as well. I think Polkadot definitely does a.
00:00:19.326 - 00:00:19.638, Speaker A: Better.
00:00:19.686 - 00:00:27.046, Speaker B: Job than Cosmos at that. Cosmos is all about, you know, everything else, but teams do not work towards one unified mission.
00:00:27.110 - 00:00:46.074, Speaker A: So I think what we need, essentially, is to learn from Cosmos in terms of, you know, some teams leading and as well, bringing some sort of experimentation as well. And I think, you know, Cosmos have done very well in terms of that community and the tribalism there in regard to, you know, experimentation. And also, I would say, bringing, you know, certain narratives to the cosmos sort of forefront.
