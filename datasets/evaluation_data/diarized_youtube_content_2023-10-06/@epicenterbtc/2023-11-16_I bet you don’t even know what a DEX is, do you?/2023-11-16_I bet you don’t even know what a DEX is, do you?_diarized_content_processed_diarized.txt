00:00:00.160 - 00:00:33.878, Speaker A: What are sort of the participants in the Osmos ecosystem? Can you just run us through? The main core of osmosis is to be a liquidity provider for the ecosystem. So you've got to accommodate traders, you've got to accommodate people that are willing to put their funds into liquidity, and you've got to incentivize it in some way. And then you've also got your governance. This is a proof of stake chain. You have staking on our network, which helps secure the chain, and it helps users who are staking to earn an APR which is actually higher than the inflation for end users. You've got the swapping of tokens. Basically.
00:00:33.878 - 00:00:56.454, Speaker A: If there's a really good project that comes along and says, hey, we got something that might interest those ecosystem, they can put a proposal up on our blockchain. This is one of the focuses at the moment for the osmosis team to extend that network. It just keeps growing. And you know, back at the moment with the bear market, everyone's just been building and now we, we see like a lot of attention coming again with this music program.
