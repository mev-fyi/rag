00:00:00.200 - 00:00:00.982, Speaker A: I find.
00:00:01.038 - 00:00:01.966, Speaker UNK: This myself.
00:00:02.110 - 00:00:02.414, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:02.454 - 00:00:12.238, Speaker UNK: If I could do like one click things that happen on all those chains, then can you just dive into these two sites that would be enabled with enlarge there?
00:00:12.286 - 00:00:53.854, Speaker A: There's the first iteration, which is solely in the Polkadot ecosystem. And so for an individual just in the Polkadot ecosystem, it probably won't radically change your user experience. When you look at what we're going to be rolling out in the future, which is using a threshold signature scheme protocol for multi party computation and off chain signing. This is when you'll be able to have a single master account, powered by invert secured by Polkadot, that lets you manage your assets on Ethereum, all of its l two s, Bitcoin, Solana, Cosmos, Avalanche, Dogecoin, the hoopla chain someone just launched five minutes ago, you know it will truly be the only account that you'll ever need.
