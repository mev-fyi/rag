00:00:00.160 - 00:00:28.350, Speaker A: As long as you practice these two things, I think you should be pretty safe. Personally, I've never used any crypto bridge in my entire life. And this is why we're building Hyper Bridge, because I'll finally have a bridge that I can use. I mean, if I wanted to bridge to optimism, there's just no way I'm going to wait seven days to get out. And so then I have to use, you know, some alternative system, and then, you know, wait ten minutes anxiously to see if I get my money out on the other side. I just. Yeah, it's just not for me.
00:00:28.350 - 00:00:30.474, Speaker A: I prefer to have peace of mind.
00:00:34.174 - 00:01:18.958, Speaker B: Thank you for tuning into the Teach me DeFi podcast for another episode today. This episode will be about interoperability between blockchains, why we want blockchains to be able to communicate with each other and share data. The challenge of making this communication secure. Within this framework, we also chat more specifically about bridging, or crypto bridges, which many people might be familiar with. A quick primer on the topic. Transferring assets across different blockchains faces significant challenges, especially with bridge protocols facilitating these transfers. I believe between 2020 and 2022, we had over $2.5
00:01:18.958 - 00:02:27.446, Speaker B: billion that were stolen due to bridge vulnerabilities. A notable example is the Ronin bridge used by Axie Infinity, which lost over 600 million to hackers. And yeah, beyond security issues, bridges often have limitations, like supporting only a few tokens being difficult or slow to use, requiring extra steps for transactions, which makes using them harder as well. So plus, transferring coins is still a rather basic level of all the ways that blockchains could communicate with each other. So for broader adoption of crypto and deFi, enhancing security, user experience and interoperability features appears to be essential. So, yeah, I'm excited that today I have the pleasure of talking to shone, co founder of a blockchain research and development lab called Polytope Labs. They've recently introduced Hyperbridge, a unique cross chain bridge protocol, to address many of the issues associated with bridging today.
00:02:27.446 - 00:02:30.114, Speaker B: Hi, Seon, thank you for coming onto the show.
00:02:30.934 - 00:02:35.634, Speaker A: Hey, it's really great to be here. Actually a big fan of your work as well.
00:02:36.254 - 00:03:07.024, Speaker B: Thank you so much. I'm glad. Yeah, lovely to link up, and I think it's such an interesting topic that can be discussed in much technical detail, but it's also a bit accessible because of all the stories around bridging and all that. But before we get into that, can you tell us a bit about your journey to this day in the crypto industry? What has that been, like, for you?
00:03:07.364 - 00:03:26.156, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So I kind of got crypto pilled back in 2017 by my coworker. At the time, he was telling me to buy bitcoin. And I remember, like, okay, why should I buy bitcoin? Was my question. He's like, well, it goes up. That was really all he said. That was really all he said.
00:03:26.156 - 00:04:40.406, Speaker A: And I was like, that just sounds to me like a Ponzi, and I'm not really interested in Ponzi's, but I remember he had bought a lot of bitcoin and I think bitcoin hit like 1000 or something, I don't remember way back in the day. And he just couldn't shut up about it. And I just decided to look into what bitcoin was. And that's kind of how I fell down the rabbit hole of this idea of decentralization, um, you know, um, Internet native money and like, uh, freeing ourselves from the shackles of like central banks and, uh, basically, you know, separation of money and state. So I was really like, yeah, I really went the crypto anarchist path rather than like, oh, just buying tokens for the ponzi of it. Um, and so once I understood bitcoin enough and I was working as a software engineer at the time, um, the next logical step was Ethereum, right? So Ethereum was also sort of coming up at the time was kind of like 2nd, 2nd most talked about protocol. So I looked into it a bit and I found out, okay, you could actually go further and just not just have money, but have programmable, decentralized applications on the blockchain, which is another like, you know, mind blowing moment for me.
00:04:40.406 - 00:05:21.734, Speaker A: So I just became obsessed with Ethereum and I started reading the protocol, sort of trying to see how I could contribute to the ecosystem. I was doing a lot of open source rust tooling for the Ethereum ecosystem at the time. This was around 2017, 2018. And I remember I was browsing through the subreddit, the Ethereum subreddit, because I'm obsessed at this point. And I see a job post for a parody, the parody team, they say they're hiring, they're looking for people to come and work on an ethereum client in Rust. That was really, really, it was incredible that people were actually putting Rust in production because this was around the same time, 2017. Rust was not even version one yet.
00:05:21.734 - 00:06:00.722, Speaker A: It was like very, very hobbyist, very, very, you know, it wasn't that like polished, but it was a promising language. And I was just excited to write Rust and excited to work on Ethereum. So I applied and I got hired in 2018, sort of September 2018. And I remember I had my last call with Gav, and it was very, very surreal, like meeting the person who actually wrote the Ethereum yellow paper, just trying to get his thoughts on where the industry is headed. So that was exciting. I was at parity for three years. I left in 2021, in August.
00:06:00.722 - 00:07:44.604, Speaker A: And this was after working on the Rust Ethereum client, the substrate blockchain framework, as well as Polkadot itself. After working at the core infrastructure, I just wanted to know, what are the applications for all of this infrastructure that we've built. I had a focus on interoperability, and this is a very philosophical standpoint for me, because if we see networks kind of as states these days, and I think that the network state paradigm and movement is starting to take the industry by storm, is that if we see these different networks as states and they don't have any trade routes, bridges between each other, then we kind of basically created the same problem we started with, which was that we had all these different countries and there was no interoperable money between these countries, except for people who actually come together, like the EU, to actually create their own interoperable money. And so it's very clear that the success of this industry will hinge on the success of the bridges that connect all these different networks together, which is why I really loved working on Polkadot. And so I was looking to build more interoperable infrastructure, so I joined composable, and I think this is what made me very popular in the Polkadot space. We were working on IBC implementation on Polkadot, and this would allow us to bridge directly to Cosmos, rather. And IBC is a really, really, I would say, way ahead of its time, using lite clients and using state proofs to bridge securely across multiple blockchains.
00:07:44.604 - 00:08:15.104, Speaker A: But it had its own limitations. And so after, like, putting this project in production because it's live today, I wanted to see how we could build a much better system without the limitations of IBC and be able to bring secure interoperability to all the blockchains, and not just on a chain to chain basis. So that's kind of been the story so far. Yeah, I don't know if there's anything that's worth covering more.
00:08:15.604 - 00:09:08.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, super interesting. I hear the theme of interoperability, sort of like weaving its way throughout your journey there. I think it would be interesting to hear from you. What does interoperability mean? Because I think it would be interesting to hear this defined by someone working on it, because it can often be like a bit of a superficial buzzword to people and people have their own beliefs attached to it. They think maybe they understand the concept, but maybe it's a bit more of a superficial understanding or false understanding. And perhaps why is it important? You kind of mentioned it already. But for example, is the end goal the bridging of just assets between blockchains, or does it go beyond that, the way blockchains could, could communicate with each other? What excites you there?
00:09:09.534 - 00:09:48.204, Speaker A: Right, so from a high level, interoperability just means being able to share data with, between blockchains. Now it's the case that this data might be instructions for what this blockchain should do, eg, mint some new tokens because I've burnt them on one side. Or maybe it's to an application letting know of something that's happened on this blockchain. Right, so sort of like a. A reaction or a hook. I guess that's what they call it these days. From my perspective, I think that token bridging will first, of course be the most successful application of bridges.
00:09:48.204 - 00:10:46.196, Speaker A: But as time goes on, more and more applications will start to emerge. I think the most important, or the second most important thing would be crushed in governance. To give you more context on this, is that we now start to have daos that have, there are applications deployed across multiple chains. It's the case that these applications actually are governed by the DAO. Their parameters, basically, the parameters and the way they function are governed by the daos. It's clear that if the DAO is going to be effective at governing multiple applications across different chains, then it does need to broadcast governance action to all of its applications securely, by the way, because if a malicious person was able to compromise that flow of governance action, then all of these applications are basically compromised. So it needs to do this securely.
00:10:46.196 - 00:11:33.126, Speaker A: And so I think cross chain governance is going to be one of the biggest applications of cross chain bridging. And there's other ideas like cross chain privacy as well. Privacy has sort of been reduced to basically being in a private, private set, kind of like tornado cash, where you add yourself to the set. It's the case that on a single blockchain the set isn't very large. And it basically makes it easy for anyone who's very savvy to detect who's going in and who's going out and draw links between them, especially if there's not a lot of people or a lot of traffic in the set. But you can imagine if we have a multi chain set. So it's a set that actually spans across multiple chains, this starts to become very, very hard for anyone to detect who's going in and who's coming out.
00:11:33.126 - 00:11:50.914, Speaker A: And especially if it's the case, you can just go into the set on one chain and just come out on the other chain. So this is another application of cross chain bridging and interoperability that I think will also be very successful. And honestly, the list goes on. Right? Like, I could sit here all day and tell you all the potential applications of interoperability.
00:11:51.354 - 00:12:21.724, Speaker B: Yeah, it's super interesting. Cross chain governance and cross chain privacy. If we look at the current most implemented use case, like you said, the token bridging, for anyone asking themselves this, either looking in from the outside or having been personally affected by it, why do we see so many hacks in crypto, and specifically of bridges? Is this industry doomed, or is there more to this?
00:12:22.384 - 00:13:11.252, Speaker A: So as a person who's been working on blockchains for the past six years, thereabouts. Now, it's the case that a lot of people who build these bridges don't have any experience building blockchains themselves. Typically, you find that they're smart contract developers. And so their perspective is, how do I just authorize, at the smart contract level, messages that are flowing between two chains? And, you know, very often they just come to the conclusion, we should have a multisig, right, that sits in the middle and does this authorization. Because you do need authorization. You need something to authorize that. This message came from the counterparty blockchain, but this is, of course, not secure, because if you can compromise this person in the middle, this entity in the middle, then you can basically authorize the withdrawal of all of the funds that are locked on the bridge.
00:13:11.252 - 00:13:49.928, Speaker A: And this is, like you said, what we've seen so far. I think the most recent one was the multi chain attack, where actually the control of the funds was usually with the team. So the team is the people who control the bridged funds. And the chinese government just came in and says, well, give us all the money. And it's the case that they can do this because they control the keys, they control the funds. And so a more superior architecture for bridging would be to use the finality proofs of the chain that you're bridging as the authorization. So these are cryptographic proofs that cannot be created by anybody except for the validators of the counterparty chain.
00:13:49.928 - 00:14:01.968, Speaker A: And I'll give you an example. As a user, you want to use the blockchain, you want to know what's happening on the blockchain as well. In a sense, you want to be bridged to the blockchain, you want to see what's happening securely.
00:14:02.016 - 00:14:02.804, Speaker B: Nice one.
00:14:03.184 - 00:14:44.504, Speaker A: Exactly. You run a full node of the network that you're intending to read and write to. And this full node, what it's doing is that it's downloading all of the blocks from the network. It's checking all these finality proofs, it's checking all of this state transition proofs, basically checking that the blocks themselves are valid. And that's basically it. If we want that same level of security in bridges, then at the very least we should also be checking finality proofs on the blockchain, which means that only the counterparty chain can be used to authorize messages that are coming from it. Now, this is very expensive actually, and this is why no one tries to do this, is because these proofs are very expensive to verify on chain.
00:14:44.504 - 00:15:42.984, Speaker A: And then you start to need very complicated ZK and all these protocol designs to make this possible in the first place. But if you're a person that's been working on blockchains for the longest of times, then you can start to see optimizations that you can take that don't necessarily need all these expensive ZK proofs to make it possible in the first place. And that's kind of how hyper bridge sort of works at a high level as well. But I think that if we want to see more secure bridges, then this sort of consensus based bridging has to proliferate basically, and has to take over all of this multisig and NPC solutions that are currently holding the industry hostage, in my opinion. Because if you look at the Defi Lama dashboard, every single bridge on there uses some sort of multisig or the other. And if you ask anyone, they will tell you that this is basically a time bomb, a ticking time bomb. But who are we to judge?
00:15:43.364 - 00:16:22.284, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I was going to dive into that later, but now that you mentioned the prevalent use of these bridges with multisigs, custody funds and all that, why are we using these bridges? What is it that drives that? Is it ease of use or integration? Is it even influence of backers of these projects or liquidity, or how cheap they are for the end user? Or does the end user also not understand the risk and then the low costs, ease of use and branding outweigh the perceived risk? Like, what is it?
00:16:22.664 - 00:17:21.244, Speaker A: I think it's a healthy combination of everything you just described. First off, these kinds of bridges, they're very, very cheap to run because they're not doing all this expensive verification in the first place. Secondly, the backers, especially if you have very notable backers in the industry, it's very easy to get people to use your bridge because they just trust that, okay, whoever backed you is a high signal enough for us to charge you with our funds. But at the same time, it's not the case that the users themselves are the ones that get compromised whenever these bridges are compromised, it's actually the LP's. So the LP's are the people who supply the liquidity on both sides of the bridges to facilitate people who want the native token on the other end. So these are the people that often get the short end of the stake whenever these bridges get compromised. And so at the same time though, it's like there's also no other alternatives, no, like client based alternative that's on the market right now for both LP's and both for users.
00:17:21.244 - 00:17:51.492, Speaker A: And so this also lack of alternatives to try people to use, whatever. Right. And it's the case that like bridges are very, very critical. So like I said, this entire space, imagine if I wanted to move from one chain to the other, I'd have to send my money to binance and, you know, swap it on binance so that I could return to deal. It's still the same thing. It's still the same thing, yeah. We need a more decentralized alternative if we want this space to actually prosper in terms of liquidity flows and seamless liquidity flows for users.
00:17:51.492 - 00:18:07.224, Speaker A: But we'll see how the industry plays out. Hyperbridge is definitely going to be one of the players in the space who adhere very closely to the security philosophies of don't trust, verify, and enabling more secure bridges in space.
00:18:08.454 - 00:18:16.406, Speaker B: Tell me more about that. What does that decentralized solution look like? What are you guys working on there?
00:18:16.590 - 00:18:59.376, Speaker A: Right, so I take a step back first and describe conventionally how bridges will be built, especially in light client paradigm. So in this light client paradigm, you have this piece of code that runs on one blockchain and it's receiving the headers. The blocks, in a sense of the blockchain is bridged to, it's verifying all this cryptography proofs of the validity of these chains. And then you do the same thing on the other side. Basically you mirror this. Now you've bridged two blockchains, and if you wanted to bridge a third blockchain, these two blockchains now have to have extra code and do extra work to verify this third blockchain and this third blockchain. So it would have to do two more different processes to verify.
00:18:59.376 - 00:19:41.084, Speaker A: And you can start to see that as we add more chains to the mix, it starts to become very cumbersome to do all of this verification on chain. It's super expensive. So this is the point to point model. And you can see this also it does parallels with bridges in the blockchain space with also airline sort of airline route planning, right? So you can have this point to point model where you just fly direct and it's super expensive, especially if you don't have a lot of passengers. And you know, there's maybe there's downtimes in you, you know, people that are flying. So you're just incurring all these unnecessary losses. And you can see the parallel of that with the sort of scaling verification costs in this also point to point version model.
00:19:41.084 - 00:20:27.416, Speaker A: And so there's another idea. What if you have a hub and a spoke model where rather than every chain running all these different light clients for all these different chains, they run a single lite client for the hub. Now the hub itself, all it does is it runs the like clients of all of its connected chains. So it's aggregating all of the verified states of all these different blockchains. And so with a single proof to any blockchain they can receive, what is the verified states of all the chains that the hub is connected to. So you can now start to see how the skills, this is now a one to n bridge, whereas before we had one to one bridge which grows from end to end as well. And so this is a much more superior architecture.
00:20:27.416 - 00:20:51.222, Speaker A: It's much more scalable, it's cheap to run and it's cheap to verify. But the thing is though is that you need high economic security for the hub. Like the hub itself has to have a large amount of value that is staked to back its consensus just so that it doesn't become a security vulnerability for all of its connected chains, like.
00:20:51.238 - 00:20:54.834, Speaker B: A single point of failure or anything like that, essentially.
00:20:55.174 - 00:21:31.232, Speaker A: And so it's the case that Polkadot itself has this high economic security, like right now. It's the case that it's total amount of assets that our state are worth over $5 billion. Now this is sufficient enough for it to be a hub, not just for the parachains but also for external chains as well. So hyper bridge is extending Polkadot's interoperability and it's shared security, not just to parachains alone, but to external chains and allowing them to benefit from the economic security that it provides. Parliamentary Hyperbridge runs off of economic security.
00:21:31.408 - 00:21:45.244, Speaker B: Right. Okay, super interesting. By the way, I saw your post on the airlines, on the airline industry. By the way, I really like your posts on x. I like them, but I rarely understand them.
00:21:46.664 - 00:22:08.576, Speaker A: Yeah, I get that a lot as well. Basically schizophrenia posting a mix of shitposting and schizophrenia. I tried to like take very sarcastic posts about different ideas and as well as just examine very closely ideas that I think will become prevalent in the future as well.
00:22:08.760 - 00:22:46.120, Speaker B: Yeah, and yeah, and one of those posts was that analogy you just used with the point to point in the hub and spoke model. So could you tell us a bit more about how that would look like using Polkadot and Polkadot's economic security then as this hub and spoke model where you connect all these different airports or blockchains just to get an idea, but with the assets flow. For example, if it's token bridging, would it flow through Polkadot then? Or what does it look like?
00:22:46.232 - 00:23:16.870, Speaker A: So in, let's say in a token bridging model, and maybe to touch a bit more on token bridging, is that the reason we have token bridging the way it is today with LP's and people supplying liquidity on both sides of the bridge, is because these bridges themselves, they know, they know that they have very terrible security. In an ideal world, you wouldn't need liquidity on both sides. You would be able to burn the tokens and authorize them to be minted.
00:23:16.902 - 00:23:26.662, Speaker B: On the other side because you're not generating new amount of tokens. It's just like they're gone there they appear here. So to say.
00:23:26.718 - 00:24:05.114, Speaker A: Yeah exactly. This is way more capital efficient. Obviously it prevents unnecessary liquidity to being locked up so that it can be used more in lending and dexs and places that actually do need liquidity, not just not bridges and circle. They realized this because theres just so much USDC locked up across all these different bridges. It doesnt make any sense. Lets unify them all. And they introduced the CCIP or the CCTP where they will mint and burn USDC across these different chains rather than having liquidity be locked up for swapping wrapped assets with the native USDC.
00:24:05.114 - 00:24:51.756, Speaker A: This is just much more capital efficient. It's much more seamless for users and for everyone in general. But it's the case that because you don't have these secure bridges, they have to now do all of this pools and do all of this swapping for getting the native assets. But if you have a very, very secure bridge, then you could basically do this mint and burn IBC, the IBC protocol in the cosmos ecosystem, they do mint and burn. They don't need to do all of this liquidity provisioning and swapping with the native asset because they just burn the asset on one end and they print it on the other end. The same thing happens in parachain world. You burn the token, the dots on the relay chain, you get it minted on whatever patching you're bridging.
00:24:51.756 - 00:25:20.934, Speaker A: So it's instant and secured by the relay chain. And so if we want to bring this capital efficient bridging to other chains, then we need to get rid of all these pools and use the finality proofs of the chain to authorize the minting. And the finance proofs also shows that it's been burnt on the counterparty chain. So as a result, this is, like I said, this is just much more seamless for users, and it's less of a, you know, it takes up less capital in general.
00:25:21.234 - 00:25:21.906, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:22.050 - 00:25:30.204, Speaker A: So that's just one application. That's one of the ways in which this new idea will change bridging. But go ahead.
00:25:30.744 - 00:25:50.528, Speaker B: No, yeah, just expanding on that. So you mentioned Circle and USDC. So they're obviously just doing that with their token. So today, could hyperbridge do this then for all kinds of tokens? Could it even do it, for example, in that case, for USDC, this authorization thing in terms of minting and burning?
00:25:50.696 - 00:26:45.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that it's the case that we will work with daos. And in general, people who have these multiple applications across different chains, or just in general, daos, wants to take their token multi chain without incurring all the liquidity costs to do so with all these conventional bridges. So you can think of us as a more decentralized alternative to Circle's CCTP. I personally, I think that the CCTP is a bad idea because it's still the same problem. You have, the centralized middleman who is able to mint and burn and can also be compromised. People will say, well, it's the same security as circle themselves because they already mint arbitrary tokens in any way. But I would assume that this minting previously was controlled by some sort of cold wallet system.
00:26:45.402 - 00:27:03.034, Speaker A: But now it's the case that you have a hot wallet that's trying to facilitate this bridging, which is really a security risk. So, long term, I think circle should want to switch to a decentralized alternative that uses the necessary proofs to transport tokens.
00:27:03.494 - 00:27:23.656, Speaker B: Right. And in terms of implementing this for a token, like the integration of a token for the Hyperbridge, do you have to, for example, contact the DAO behind the token to get this approval or something in order to be able to do that? Or can you just like permissionlessly do these things?
00:27:23.840 - 00:27:53.454, Speaker A: Right. So, no, we do need the DAO approval. And I think daos are also starting to look out for bridge partners as well, like Uniswap, Lido, all these different daos who have a token, and they want this token to be native across all these different chains. The integration process is pretty simple, very seamless. They basically extend their token contracts with some adapters that our bridge needs, which it can then use to mint and burn this token across all these different chains.
00:27:54.314 - 00:28:21.324, Speaker B: Okay. And this is how is this then more secure in terms of a. That they don't have to trust, that they don't have the vulnerability of a single point of failure. I assume it has to do with these lite clients. Is there a way to explain this in a sort of like, not very techie fashion so I and someone else can understand?
00:28:22.064 - 00:28:50.348, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. For sure. So, you know, we have what are called these validators of the chain. And sure, their job is to produce blocks, but their job is also to vote on which sequence of blocks are finalized. Right. Do everyone's familiar with word finalized? But how does this actually work? Well, the voting is done through these cryptographic signatures. So it's just data that they produce using their keys that says, well, this chain has not been finalized.
00:28:50.348 - 00:29:35.336, Speaker A: And if you have enough signatures from what we call the super majority, so two thirds of the validators, then this is proof that this chain has been finalized. So a like line really is a piece of code that is able to verify the signatures from the validators and is able to track the chain as they produce more proof. So also tracking when the validators themselves change because they vote on what is the next set going to be. So that's at a high level what a like client is. And you can now start to see that a lite client basically inherits the security of the blockchain itself. You know, if it's the case that a like client were to be compromised, then the blockchain itself is compromised. Right.
00:29:35.336 - 00:29:50.004, Speaker A: Because you now have this byzantine set and they're producing proofs for conflicting chains which would cost them a lot in the amount that they've staked. So this is why we come back to the argument that we do need high economic security for, like, clients to use.
00:29:51.304 - 00:30:09.544, Speaker B: So basically, for these applications or the Daos behind these tokens, it would be in their interest to integrate a solution like Hyperbridge because there is less trust assumptions and it's more secure and essentially better for their own ecosystem?
00:30:09.844 - 00:30:10.984, Speaker A: Basically, yes.
00:30:12.484 - 00:30:26.464, Speaker B: Okay. What's your favorite part of what you do, actually? I mean, it can be high stress. You're trying to secure these bridges of money, of people going across it. So what do you love about it?
00:30:26.624 - 00:30:55.314, Speaker A: I mean, I love the math, the cryptography part of it. I think that it's insane that we're able to do what we do because of all of these cryptographic primitives. It's, you know, I'm a nerd, basically. The possibility of these things, they just blow my mind. They actually just blow my mind. And just being able to work with them in my day job, you know, something that I'm excited about is really unmatched.
00:30:55.974 - 00:31:01.674, Speaker B: Yeah. That's worth a lot. Yeah. What do you do to kind of get away from it? Decompress, relax.
00:31:02.094 - 00:31:13.394, Speaker A: So I play tennis, lawn tennis on Sundays. So it's one of the ways I used return to baseline. And that's kind of a pun because, you know, in tennis, you have the baseline.
00:31:14.134 - 00:31:14.914, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:15.614 - 00:31:26.924, Speaker A: And I also play video games as well. I hang out with my friends and. And I read books as well, so that kind of varying activities that I do, I also go to the gym once in a while.
00:31:27.264 - 00:31:36.280, Speaker B: That's funny. I play tennis. Yeah, nice. I play tennis as well. You should play. Yeah, yeah, definitely. You're just a bit too far away right now.
00:31:36.312 - 00:31:39.232, Speaker A: But don't worry, we'll make it happen. We'll make it happen.
00:31:39.408 - 00:31:46.036, Speaker B: Yeah. Nice. Nice. You mentioned, like, long tennis, or did you just mean, like, the normal one? Like, is there another thing or.
00:31:46.160 - 00:31:56.664, Speaker A: Oh, I just, you know, it's a disambiguate from table tennis because usually tennis. Some people think I'm table tennis, but I do play table tennis. But I prefer lawn tennis because it's just more intense, you know, especially on the knees.
00:31:57.444 - 00:32:08.044, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. What's your favorite, what's the english word for it? The ground, like the course. Is it on clay or hardcore?
00:32:08.084 - 00:32:21.568, Speaker A: I prefer the hard quartz. For the hardcourts. I've tried clay. I've played grass as well. It's. Clay is very tricky because you can fall if you're not careful. And the grass courts, they don't bounce very much.
00:32:21.568 - 00:32:24.752, Speaker A: I think hardcourts are just, like, the best sweet spot.
00:32:24.928 - 00:32:35.312, Speaker B: Yeah, me as well. I'm left handed, so you can put a bit of a slice on a hardcourt. And it does do more than on clay, for sure.
00:32:35.448 - 00:32:37.708, Speaker A: The left handed people, you got to watch out for them.
00:32:37.896 - 00:32:42.064, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. No one likes to play against them.
00:32:42.764 - 00:32:44.264, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's dangerous.
00:32:48.404 - 00:33:18.164, Speaker B: If we back to the whole bridging and interoperability space, what do you actually think about the state of the Ethereum L2 landscape at the moment? Is this becoming the go to place for thriving, performant interconnected applications, or is it becoming increasingly messy and fragmented? Could it even hurt the ecosystem entirely? What's your take on it?
00:33:18.464 - 00:33:50.634, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Actually, I was having a conversation with someone else on Twitter about this, and I think that Ethereum itself already has all of these network effects, already has all of this liquidity. It's natural that it will become a roll up hub. It's impossible, though, for it to become a bridge hub. And I've written extensively about this on our blog, but I'll just recap some of the facts. So there are really two kinds of roll ups. You have the optimistic roll up and you have the ZK rollups.
00:33:50.634 - 00:34:29.986, Speaker A: The optimistic roll ups, they have the advantage that they can do more computation because they're not bounded by, by domain l one. They can produce a lot of blocks. The only thing they need to do is to post the data of these blocks on Ethereum. And now there's this new idea that in fact they should just post it somewhere else entirely. And I'll get into all of that later. But they just posted somewhere else entirely, and then they just post the commitments about what is the latest state of the chain. So Ethereum, basically, at that point, they're no longer, in my opinion, a roll up.
00:34:29.986 - 00:35:22.356, Speaker A: They're more like an l one that just doesn't have its own consensus, in a weird way. But the problem with these roll ups, and we'll tackle optimistic roll ups first, is that they have this very high finality period, which makes bridging in between them basically impossible. This is where all of these sort of multi seg bridges thrive, because they can provide faster finality, even though it's just backed by a multisig across these different roll ups. This to me presents systemic risk, because users are not going to use the canonical bridges because it's just too slow. Seven days. Who's going to wait for that? And so it puts the entire ecosystem on these multi seq bridges that have all these risks that I've described earlier. It becomes very, very problematic as we now start to launch more and more roll ups.
00:35:22.356 - 00:36:08.244, Speaker A: And it's not clear how we're going to bridge these roll ups together and provide higher security bridging for our users. People just seem to discount the fact that people are going to want to bridge in and out of your roll up. They just only look at it as a one way. Tokens are now on my roll up, and ideally they would never leave, which is not the case. There are now ideas around, okay, maybe shared sequencing. It's not really clear what benefits this provides. And there's ideas around pre confirmation as well, which is a bit risky because preconfirmation leverages crypto economic security to provide a stake that says, I'm backing this roll up block as valid, even though we've not checked it.
00:36:08.244 - 00:36:50.632, Speaker A: Which means that you're no longer inheriting the security of Ethereum. You're now inheriting whatever the security is of whatever chain is providing you this pre conformation. Yeah, so this is where hyper Bridge actually comes in as maybe the only solution to provide secure bridging across optimistic roll ups is because we are able to, first off, follow the finality of Ethereum. So every roll up block first has to be finalized by Ethereum. And then we can provide this extra service of checking the blocks of the optimistic roll ups. So we do so by re executing them on a parachain or within a parachain block. So this is kind of how moonbeam works today.
00:36:50.632 - 00:37:53.874, Speaker A: The moonbeam is an EVM blockchain and it sends its blocks to Polkadot to be validated to be executed. In the same way we can just package up all these roll up blocks, put them inside of a parachain block and send them up to Polkadot to be executed so that we can get validity guarantees, and then we can bridge back the results of this execution to be used for bridging to other roll ups on Ethereum and this sort of hub and spoke model like we described earlier. So this is kind of how I see really the roll up landscape and bridges play nowadays, that we will need external services that on top of Ethereum security can also provide validity checks. In fact, some people are already trying to see if you can do this with ZK, the RiSC zero team. They came out with this protocol or products called Zeth, and it's basically they took the rest code base, which is in rust, and they were able to put it into their RISC five ZKVM. And you're able to then produce proofs that this block is valid. But the problem with this is that it's super expensive.
00:37:53.874 - 00:38:27.700, Speaker A: You have to run like 64 machines in parallel. A lot of communication complexity there as well. And it takes an hour for all of these machines to produce a single proof. Now you have to understand that these optimistic roll ups are producing a block every 2 seconds. So any kind of ZK solution to bridge them is just not going to work. This is where Polkadot really, really shines, is because Polkadot has this bandwidth for compute, we can start to run a single roll up on multiple parachains. In fact we can split up the blocks across these different parachains and just execute them in parallel.
00:38:27.700 - 00:39:06.630, Speaker A: And parachutes now have six second block times. And in fact I think they're trying to make that even to two second block times. And just by executing these blocks across these different parachains, we can assert the validity of whether these roll up blocks are valid. And this is comparable to if we just did it in a ZK circuit. Until we have solutions like this, roll ups are really going to just stay fragmented, will be held hostage by all of these different multisig protocols for bridging. Now there's also ideas around intent centric bridging, but you can't really bridge arbitrary data. You can't use this to do crushed in governance.
00:39:06.630 - 00:39:34.604, Speaker A: It's only for tokens. You lock up some tokens on one end and someone else will give you the tokens on the other end. That's how these intent bridges work, like across and hop. But like I said, you can't use them to bridge arbitrary data just for tokens alone. So yeah, that's kind of my take on sort of the global l two landscape. And of course we're going to keep getting more and more l two s. I think optimistic roll ups are cheaper than ZK roll ups, cheaper to run.
00:39:34.604 - 00:39:58.856, Speaker A: And yeah, they also have some way more profit as well. We can see these numbers in the l two fees website. So you can see the profit margins for the optimistic roll ups versus the ZK rollups. Sure. You have to understand that the ZK roll ups, on top of on chain verification calls, they're also paying massive prover costs in the background that they don't report. So it's unlikely that they're even profitable in the first place, to be honest. So these are.
00:39:58.856 - 00:40:15.264, Speaker A: Yeah, this is where we're focused mostly on optimistic roll ups. Even at the same time, ZK roll ups themselves, they don't post the proofs immediately. They post them typically after a day. So it's like four to 24 hours after the block is posted to l one. So in a sense they're still mostly optimistic. Right?
00:40:15.304 - 00:40:15.964, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:16.144 - 00:40:27.344, Speaker A: So this is kind of a landscape and this is kind of how I see a solution that bridges all of them working, basically being able to confirm block validity on top of ethereum's finality.
00:40:28.124 - 00:41:07.764, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. This sounds also like there's a solid basis in terms of economic feasibility for your solution just being a cheaper and then a secure solution opposed to the other ones, which is always good in order to establish market position, so to say. And how would it look on Polkadot in terms of you mentioned power chains? Would hyperbridge then have its own parachain or would existing parachains do, could they opt in to do these proofs or how would that go?
00:41:07.944 - 00:41:38.230, Speaker A: Not necessarily. We will definitely have our own power chain, but not just one parachain. In fact, we're looking to have multiple parachain slots on Polkadot and all these parachains, they're all natively interoperable. We can read the results of one parachain on a single parachain. So you can imagine you have all of these worker parachains and then we have a single master parachain. And when these worker cores are done, we just read the result of their execution on one chain and we're able to do what, whatever processing that we need to do to bridge them back out.
00:41:38.382 - 00:41:50.154, Speaker B: Right. And how does establishing Hyperbridge and Polkadot as this hub drive value to the network of Polkadot as well?
00:41:50.774 - 00:42:23.730, Speaker A: So because it's the case that we're purchasing core time, we're going to be leasing slots. All of the computation that we do on the network for bridging is basically going back to the network. Right. It's not going to be us that sort of reap the benefits. It's mostly going to be a network. But of course, at the same time, block space and core time is very cheap right now, I think most of all the parachain blocks are pretty empty. So I think this is also a really, really great time for us to be building this sort of infrastructure and taking advantage of all of this.
00:42:23.730 - 00:42:27.426, Speaker A: Compute the polka dot has is basically unused, right?
00:42:27.570 - 00:42:55.320, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. Everything's coming together, the way I'm hearing. And also the lack or the limitations and the gap that exists on Ethereum's l two landscape could be something that drives network usage substantially on Polkadot or fundamentally, yes, yes.
00:42:55.392 - 00:42:59.782, Speaker A: This is how this would eventually play out, I think.
00:42:59.968 - 00:43:46.114, Speaker B: Right. What about these models like Thor chain, they say there's native cross chain swaps that can be done through them. I know there was a bit of controversy around it recently with, I think, like, illicit activity going through there, and there could have been some measures to limit that. Like, for example, to say, okay, one transaction, you could, you know, it doesn't, you could essentially say one transaction can be larger than x million dollars or something, which probably 98% of users don't need to do in one transaction anyway. But, yeah, anyways, how does that model fit in this whole thing in terms of, like, cross chain bridging?
00:43:46.654 - 00:44:50.944, Speaker A: Right? So torching is just another multi SIG system. And. But they, and, you know, this is, this is kind of, I would say, an alternative to having a multisig, like a blatant multisig, like layer zero, is that you say you have a chain, and this chain has its validators for a multisig, and they're signing on what to do on all these different chains. Thor chain itself has been, has been exploited in the past, I think, twice now. And it's just a problem, like I said, with all these multisig security solutions, is that they are essentially a middleman in between the blockchain that introduces security risk. So Thor chain itself, they just have pools on all these different chains, and they're able to use the chain that's in the middle to sign on what to do on all these different chains. But at the end of the day, whether it's a chain, whether it's a community of people who are signing still a multisig, which is just not as secure as relaying the consensus proofs and using that as authorization rather than a middleman.
00:44:51.644 - 00:45:16.368, Speaker B: Right, right. Okay. There's also some recent events that I wanted to hear your views about. I saw this post about bitcoin by Nikita Zavaronkov. I hope I said that right. The average bitcoin transaction fee is now dollar 50, with 300 300,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed. This is beyond ridiculous and unusable.
00:45:16.368 - 00:46:03.868, Speaker B: Historically, this is the point when people start running away to alternative blockchains en masse. Then there was a post about blockchain, the blockchain avalanche by cited saying, I went from $500 in avex wallet to dollar 50 because of a couple failed transactions, and I never even got my transaction through. Right. And then there was the arbitrum sequencer that went down a few days ago. Arbitrum stopped producing blocks for the people who don't know, like, what's the sequencer like? It's responsible for ordering and processing transactions before they're finalized on Ethereum and arbitrum has won. I believe it's centralized and went down. So the chain was not usable.
00:46:03.868 - 00:46:09.944, Speaker B: So what's going on, shone? What does this say about the current state of crypto? What are your thoughts?
00:46:10.364 - 00:47:06.502, Speaker A: Right, so I think that, first off, there's this new inscriptions craze where people are basically spamming every blockchain with all these useless transactions with data that may not be useful on chain, but maybe it's useful off chain, who knows? And a lot of the chains are now sort of crumbling under the weight of all of these inscriptions because they're driving up the gas prices. Yeah, I mean, it's to be expected. We've seen this already play out before with NFT mints on Ethereum mainnet, and kind of how that sensed gas prices skyrocketing. I think the arbitram cases are very, very peculiar because I would assume that the sequencer went down because of a memory issue. Like, it ran out of memory, because. Yeah. It's the case that if you have a single machine, then all the transactions on the network in the mempool have to be stored in memory.
00:47:06.502 - 00:47:35.344, Speaker A: And if your machine isn't, as, you know, beefy as it needs to be, then basically it crashes the machine. Yeah. Also, as a block producing. As a single block producing machine, it needs to know all the transactions in the mempool. Right. Because it's the single block producer, it needs to be able to order these transactions and put them into a block in a decentralized network. This wouldn't happen because each machine kind of doesn't need to know the entire mempool.
00:47:35.344 - 00:47:53.396, Speaker A: This work is shared across all the different machines. But in the case of arbitrum, because of this centralized single sequencer, that makes a lot of sense that it went down. Maybe when they decentralized, this would. Wouldn't be an issue going forward, but it's the cost of centralization in our.
00:47:53.420 - 00:48:20.944, Speaker B: Paper, as in, okay, the cost of centralization, that something like this could happen. That's what you mean. What is next for Polito labs? Like, what's coming up? What are the future plans? You kind of mentioned the power chains and perhaps even multiple parachains. Would there be a token? Does there to be a token with the token powered, is. And what are you building on right now? What's next?
00:48:21.444 - 00:48:59.330, Speaker A: So, right now, we're working on the final pieces of the puzzle of Hyperbridge. So right now, what we have on Testnet is more of a poc. We need to swap out some of these parts to make them mainet ready, boosting the security, making it super cheap. Maybe an example of this is our vertical tree scheme, which makes our state proofs the cheapest possible, so users can enjoy high security, but with very low fees. And then finally, we're switching out our Ethereum lite client for the full beacon chain lite client. So we have a protocol. It's called ZK Casper.
00:48:59.330 - 00:50:03.724, Speaker A: It's really the only one in the industry, and it allows us to track the full Ethereum validator set. It's over like 880,000 right now. So being able to verify signatures from all of these people means that we're benefiting from the, from the entirety of the staked ETH rather than a subsample of this committee, which most people, most bridges used to do, I think succinct electron labs, even near all of them, use this sync committee, which is like just 512 people subsampled from the entire set. In my opinion, it's not very secure, especially when you pair the fact that there's a whole network, the proposal, or I want to say the build up relay network, which allows you to do mev and allows you to request signatures from, really any member of the validator set. You can see how we can use this to request signatures from the members of the sync committee to perform like, client attacks. And also you take into the fact that the sync committee cannot be slashed. And even if they could be slashed, the amount at stake is so low that it doesn't even make any sense.
00:50:03.724 - 00:50:39.344, Speaker A: So the only way we want, the only way you can have a truly secure bridge theorem is if you're validating the full set. And it's also the case that this is not just possible inside of a snark, it's just too many signatures. But we're able to do this because we do this on a parachain. We dedicate a single parachain to this, and it does all the verification, and then we're able to read the, verificate the results of that verification and then, you know, use it for bridging. So this is also something that's only possible on Polkadot, to be honest with you. And so once we have these two pieces in place, then we're ready for mainnet. We're already looking to do partnerships.
00:50:39.344 - 00:51:39.060, Speaker A: For instance, Rob Padmar is working on a data availability layer on Polkadot. So basically using Polkadot to store roll up data for Ethereum roll ups, they will need to bridge, of course, their data availability proofs to Ethereum using Hyperbridge. So you really looking forward to that. As well as just partnering with Daos for gateway as well, our token bridging solution, allowing them to bridge their tokens to all these different chains that we support pre Baynet securing these critical partnerships. Sure. So in the question of tokens, well yes, we will need a token for governance. And the reason for this is imagine you had a ZK lite client contract on Ethereum or whatever, but this Ck like client contract, it needs to be upgradable so that you can change the consensus, the underlying, if the underlying consensus changes on the counterparty chain, you need to update this consensus like on Ethereum.
00:51:39.060 - 00:52:20.574, Speaker A: But if you now do this with a multisig, then you no longer have a ZK lite client, you have a multisig bridge because the multisig governs the code and it can be used to swap it out for a malicious contract that doesn't do any verification. You know, this compromises the bridge. So in order to avoid this, we do need to have decentralized governance on our chain, which controls our code on our parachains, and basically making this no longer dependent on whatever the Politoblabs team is thinking about, but the broader community and their needs. So this is why we will have a token at some point, but it's not really in the plans on mainnet launch. Unfortunately, we think the token will come much later after launch.
00:52:21.114 - 00:52:38.294, Speaker B: Okay, some token alpha here. You heard it first. Also, it sounds like you're kind of showcasing a lot of unique capabilities with Hyperbridge that Polkadot has. I mean, the decentralized governance thing is another one.
00:52:39.154 - 00:53:02.664, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. It's so important, especially with this new regulatory crackdown on protocols that may be super centralized. By making this decentralized, we're not just, it's not just a meme, but we're kind of absolving ourselves of the responsibility of the network and sort of bringing in the community to also take part in being responsible for the network.
00:53:03.964 - 00:53:30.584, Speaker B: And real quick, because you mentioned data availability, which is also a big topic at the moment with Celestia and all that. And could you just explain what's happening there again, what's data availability? Why are solutions like Celestia being used by l two s and then mention how Polkadot could actually tie into that and be used for that? Because you did mention this.
00:53:31.044 - 00:54:47.314, Speaker A: Right? So if you go back to the roll up paradigm where you need to post the block data to Ethereum, it turns out that Ethereum doesn't have the bandwidth to process all of these block data from all these multiple roll ups, it's super expensive. It drives off the cost of ethereums block price on Mainnet. So people are starting to realize, okay, maybe we can post the data elsewhere on another decentralized blockchain, and this decentralized blockchain will be bridged to Ethereum so that we can show, using state proofs, that our block data is in that blockchain. Right? So this way, we still maintain the fact that the data is available and it's a decentralized network and not that it's a centralized network, and we're just withholding the data. So networks like Celestia, they're taking advantage of this fact that Ethereum itself doesn't scale with data, and they're also providing data availability. It's the case that Polkadot has already built a lot of all of this data availability protocols way back in 2018, 2019. Every parachain block is coded and made available to all of the relay chain validators, and they can reconstruct it on their own data validity sampling, and re execute the blocks if need be.
00:54:47.314 - 00:55:41.728, Speaker A: And so I had started a conversation about this on the fellowship channel, that was last year, December, and I was trying to propose that we could actually open up Polkadot's data availability protocol to people who want to post data for roll ups or for what have you. And this could be another way that Polkadot provides a service to different blockchains. I think recently, Rob, what came out of that. So Rob recently started working on this problem and basically exposing Polkadot's data availability to different chains. And Polkadot is the key. Polka Dot has so much, and I want to say compute, but as well as data throughput, because all of this compute needs data throughput, because you need to be able to process the data for the compute. So it's two sides of the same coin.
00:55:41.728 - 00:56:23.040, Speaker A: So the same way we have all these cores that can process code is the same way they can also process data as well. So you can imagine that because each core is allocated a maximum of five megabytes of data for its compute. So you can imagine if you just keep stacking all these cores together, then you can now have very, very high throughput data that allows people to post their roll up blocks and those data slots, and they can be secured by the Polkadot relay chain. This is, like I said, this is what Rob is working on right now. And I think they will have a major announcement soon. Don't want to spoil anything. They recently made their repo open source.
00:56:23.040 - 00:56:39.674, Speaker A: I tweeted about it as an alpha leak and this kind of went viral. But I think it's super exciting stuff. And I think that Polkadot is going to have the most data throughput of any data availability chain because of this sharded nature of execution and data requirements of this execution.
00:56:40.094 - 00:56:50.234, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Okay. I'm glad I asked that question. That was also super interesting to hear that there is actual things coming up on that front.
00:56:50.614 - 00:57:07.190, Speaker A: Yeah, it's exciting. I think Pogo is slowly transitioning from trying to serve just powertrains and serve l one s, but also serve other protocols through high economic security, high computes and data throughputs.
00:57:07.382 - 00:58:00.566, Speaker B: Yeah. Which makes a lot of sense in terms of the interoperability narrative and the mission that Polkadot is after. Right. Perhaps pivoting to a bit of a different question, you and your co founder, David, you're nigerian, and I was curious about your views on Africa and the crypto space because my insight is limited there. How do you see the role of Nigeria and Africa in the global blockchain ecosystem, perhaps both on the developer and the user side? What trends are you seeing? What are challenges and opportunities there? And perhaps could the blockchain space benefit from embracing Africa as a market and a talent pool more? And if so, how? That was a lot of questions, but yeah, just curious on your opinion on this.
00:58:00.750 - 00:59:00.644, Speaker A: Yeah. So first off, Nigeria has the largest developer community in Africa, and this is from a recent GitHub survey about like, what are the developer trends? And I think Nigeria ranked the largest, actually the largest great developer community in the world, world based on the year over year changes. So it's a huge untapped market in terms of developers for sure. But at the same time, sub Saharan Africa in general, now not just Nigeria, but sub Saharan Africa, is growing as one of the largest users of stablecoins. And I think there were some reports, and I might have to bring this up later on because I don't have it with me, but shows that there has been over $800 billion of stablecoin settlements generated by sub saharan Africa alone in the past year. So not only do we have the largest number of developers, but we also have the largest number of users in the space. And there's lots of reasons for this.
00:59:00.644 - 00:59:53.700, Speaker A: High inflation, lack of financial inclusion. The list goes on. So in my opinion, this is one of the things that drives our work here at Polytope Labs is that if we're already the largest users of crypto in the world, then how come we don't build all of this critical crypto infrastructure we go back to the web two space where basically web two was mostly built by Silicon Valley, mostly built by the west. And the reason for this was because they had more advanced computers, they had more advanced networking. They got all of these things before the rest of the world. But right now, the only thing that you need to build all of this different web3 infrastructure is just a bit knowledge of cryptography, a little bit of math. Yeah.
00:59:53.700 - 01:00:34.264, Speaker A: And that's about it. Crypto is a much more decentralized system. It's different people from different countries that are pushing the industry forward. It's not just one set of people. This presents an opportunity for us to also shape the industry in a way that caters to our own needs as well, because it's very different that people build products for you and these people are outside the country, versus someone who's in the country, who understands the needs, understands the users, understands the ecosystem, and can then take all of these and then build a product that caters to all of these different things. And we're already seeing this happen, actually. We're seeing, for instance, look at tron and how it's been able to be very successful in China.
01:00:34.264 - 01:01:03.684, Speaker A: Same thing with BNB. Look at Polygon and how it's been able to be very successful in India. I think that crypto is going to be local first, not necessarily the same way we've seen before with the web two space where we just have one region that just broadcasts software and its services out into the world. It's more that we will see local first adoption. So this is, like I said, this is what drives us and drives our mission at Polytope Labs. And we're also trying to grow the community as well. We tend to host all these different developers.
01:01:03.684 - 01:01:49.364, Speaker A: We do ZK meetups, we do protocol meetups. We used to also do substrate developer bootcamps back in the day, training people in the substrate framework. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of opportunities in the substrate framework right now, so we're kind of scaling that back. But there's opportunities in CK, and so we're also bringing that up as well. I think that if we're able to grow the community, grow the developer community, they will drive user adoption. There's already like, it's already a fertile ground, in my opinion, because of all the different factors, economic and financial inclusivity, factors that will just eat up all the applications and all of the sort of projects that may spawn from a cohesive community of developers.
01:01:50.024 - 01:02:34.746, Speaker B: Right. Why do you think that is that? Firstly, super interesting to hear that. And yeah, I'm glad you shared all that. Why do you think it is that now it is more easy to have, it's less in terms of you have one hub that's in San Francisco or whatever, but now you can actually build up more locally these communities. Is it because of the decentralized fashion of this technology where you can get involved and let's say put out a protocol or code on these decentralized networks without having to have this like physical infrastructure hardware which is already highly developed? Is this contributing to it?
01:02:34.930 - 01:03:31.546, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's mostly because of how the industry is still in its early research days. Right. I think of this whole blockchain space as a research experiment, but of course it has its applications because of it still in its early days. And it really builds on infrastructure that's already publicly available, like cloud compute, beyond blockchain nodes. This is really widely accessible to anyone. The only part of it that actually kind of needs development is the code, the protocols, and this is also very accessible to anyone. So this I think contributes to the decentralized nature of development because anyone with a laptop, anyone with developer experience, they can just pick it up and start to hack on new ideas and new protocols and they can deploy this onto a decentralized network and instantly everybody in the world has access to it.
01:03:31.546 - 01:03:50.964, Speaker A: I think that's very, very powerful. I think that's not something that the web two space had. And I think that just because of the fact of this is that we will start to see more and more people from very obscure places all over the, the world contributes to the global landscape world. I think that's exciting. More representation in terms of technology and technology development.
01:03:51.384 - 01:04:08.004, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. More and more the barriers are becoming in terms of knowledge and access to education only ish and less in terms of where you are or other barriers that you might have.
01:04:08.564 - 01:04:09.108, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:04:09.156 - 01:04:27.116, Speaker B: I think yeah, but. Oh yeah, and we'll put all those, we'll put links to the things you mentioned in the show notes in terms of if people want to get involved with your meetups or anything like that, and get involved with polytope labs more they can. Yeah, for sure, for sure.
01:04:27.140 - 01:04:28.504, Speaker A: I'll send everything over.
01:04:29.004 - 01:04:52.464, Speaker B: Sweet. Finally to wrap it up, perhaps. Is there any actionable practical advice that we can leave viewers with regarding bridges? Are there any heuristics they can use, a mental model? Any simple steps they can go by in their head to make sure they protect themselves as good as they can?
01:04:53.484 - 01:05:38.230, Speaker A: Safe bridging? Well, you know, it's the case that, like I said, there's not a lot of safe bridges at the moment, but I would say, as a rule of thumb, do not LP into bridges that have a very shady security model. I think even the Polkadot people also got burned by the recent multi chain bridge hack. And so you want to avoid, first off, getting wrapped assets. If the bridge is going to give you wrapped assets, just avoid the bridge. In general, if it gives you a native asset, then it doesn't really matter how it does that because you're insulated from when it fails. It's the LP's who could be burnt when it fails. But at the same time, also don't lp to bridges that have this multisig security model.
01:05:38.230 - 01:06:08.368, Speaker A: But yeah, as long as you practice these two things, I think you should be pretty safe. Personally, I've never used any crypto bridge in my entire life. And this is why we're building hyper bridge. Because I have a bridge that I can use. Yes, for sure. Because, I mean, if I wanted to bridge to optimism, there's just no way I'm going to wait seven days to get out. And so then I have to use some alternative system and then wait ten minutes anxiously to see if I get my money out on the other side.
01:06:08.368 - 01:06:25.744, Speaker A: I just. It's just not for me. I prefer to have peace of mind, whatever it is I'm doing. And the same peace of mind you have when you use ethereum is the same peace of mind you should have when you use a bridge. And I don't think any of the bridges out there provide that. So this is why we're building it.
01:06:26.124 - 01:06:26.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:26.692 - 01:06:26.900, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:26.932 - 01:06:44.668, Speaker B: You're really putting your money where your mouth is, so to say. You know, always good to see a co founder do that for a project. Well, thank you so much, Shion. It was very insightful. One of my faves, for sure. Thank you for coming on the show. All the best to you guys.
01:06:44.668 - 01:06:58.204, Speaker B: We will be on the lookout for any announcements that you were already kind to, kind of give us hints about. And yeah, you're always welcome on the show. And thank you for coming on.
01:06:58.584 - 01:07:01.624, Speaker A: Thank you for having me, sir. It's always great to be here.
