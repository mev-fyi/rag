00:00:00.120 - 00:00:07.286, Speaker B: If you imagine explaining liquid staking, which can be a bit confusing at first to a ten year old, how would you describe it?
00:00:07.350 - 00:00:10.234, Speaker A: Thankfully, no ten year old has asked me this question.
00:00:11.094 - 00:00:15.086, Speaker B: Well, they might. They're getting very financially literate in the web. Three, eight.
00:00:15.190 - 00:00:46.374, Speaker A: Yeah. I think, as Mikael was saying, hopefully the ten year old is a djen, you know, buying meme coins and messing around on chains. So he likes liquid staking, but no staking. You know, the core mechanism behind staking or proof of stake is really intended to add more security to the network. Right. So, you know, the main, the motivation around liquid staking is really around the tackle, the capital inefficiency of staking and the liquidity constraints that are available. So I think that sort of paves a nice sort of context to the discussion.
