00:00:00.120 - 00:00:34.490, Speaker A: For the sake of a demo, I've created a new chrome instance for users who want to check everything out themselves. They can go to osmosis zone and they can find all the links there to launch the app as well as our socials, which will be at the bottom. I want to just give a quick visual representation of the ecosystem and this is one of the visualizations. So this is osmosis and the connected main, connected chains to osmosis via IBC. If I just go back, you can see the extent of the full ecosystem. It's quite, it's quite large. So it's like a mesh, a mesh network like the Internet.
00:00:34.490 - 00:00:54.914, Speaker A: And that's why Cosmos is called the Internet of blockchains. This is a super interesting way to visualize it. This is showing all the IBC connections between the different cosmos chains. That's correct, yes. You can see in the last two weeks it transfers to and from osmosis, totaling about $200 million in the last two weeks.
