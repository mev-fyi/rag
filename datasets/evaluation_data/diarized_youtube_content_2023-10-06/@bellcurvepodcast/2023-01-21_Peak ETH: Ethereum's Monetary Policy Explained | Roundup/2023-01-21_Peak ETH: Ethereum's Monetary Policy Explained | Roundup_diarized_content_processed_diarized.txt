00:00:00.410 - 00:00:10.160, Speaker A: Before we jump into this episode, quick reminder that everything said on Bell Curve is a meme and nothing said on Bell Curve is financial advice. Enjoy the app.
00:00:13.810 - 00:00:27.266, Speaker B: All right, fellas, welcome back. Another jesus. All right, fellas, welcome back. Another bell curve roundup here. Round two, joined by Michael's Bell curve. We got the rel yeah, we got the rel curve. We got the rel curve.
00:00:27.266 - 00:00:32.710, Speaker B: I got to edit that out. Michael's, one and two. Vance and Yano. Fellas, welcome back to the show. How you doing?
00:00:32.780 - 00:00:33.350, Speaker A: We're back.
00:00:33.420 - 00:00:36.886, Speaker C: Good to be here after a week off. We're back.
00:00:36.988 - 00:00:46.898, Speaker B: Week off. That was my bad. That was my bad on the timing. Completely. It's all good on the timing. Sorry, guys, felt really bad about that. I rugged.
00:00:46.898 - 00:00:53.854, Speaker B: Michael and Vance last week. Sorry, guys. What did you do with all your time off? Francis, you're walking your dog?
00:00:54.052 - 00:00:58.782, Speaker C: Yeah, I walked the dog, took him out. He really appreciated it. So it was good.
00:00:58.916 - 00:01:16.994, Speaker B: All right, guys, so it's been a big this is like the first week that we've actually had markets move in a positive direction in a long time. Good move. People are pretty excited about it. It was basically up across the board. So seven day returns for Bitcoin are 20%. ETH is up 15%. Salana is 35, AVAX 29.
00:01:16.994 - 00:01:35.210, Speaker B: Adam is hanging in at just 3%. They never really get the pump, do they? But I'd be curious just what you guys think about this and just help contextualize. Is this like the beginning of a broader rally in your guys mind? Is it sort of a dead cat bounce type thing or what do you think about why prices moved?
00:01:35.710 - 00:02:13.094, Speaker C: So I think if you look at the past week, crypto prices are up 15, 20% in the aggregate. If you want to get some context around that number, look at the tenure, which today is under 34. So it's three three five. It's nice to get 3.35% yield in a year, but when assets are moving 20% in a week, that's when the risk reward trade off starts to get real. Those bonds start to get less attractive. And what I see is people calling it a bear market rally, an echo bubble, a dead cap bounce, like anything except for saying the other B word, the bull market.
00:02:13.094 - 00:02:58.390, Speaker C: And it feels like the intellectual window dressing of calling this an echo bubble is just a polite way for bearish people to admit they were wrong without actually admitting that they were wrong. But the money has to go somewhere. And right now crypto is that somewhere. And at the aggregate, it seems like the market is net short. A lot of ETH and Bitcoin after all of these major players sold, and you have Genesis filing today, you have whatever that Bit Lazo announcement going down. It doesn't look like finance was fine. The $2 billion that everyone was saying was going to happen on Twitter, a lot of the boogeyman have been taken out of the equation and it's not really surprising to see get off to a hot start after such a bad year last year.
00:02:58.390 - 00:03:02.710, Speaker C: But if it's a new bull market, who knows? But you got to start somewhere.
00:03:03.850 - 00:03:04.502, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:04.636 - 00:04:08.380, Speaker D: The only thing that I'd add I completely agree with all of that. Only thing that I'd add generally is when you see over a holiday weekend low liquidity market and something move, expect that there's going to be some announcement that happens basically the day after or two days after. Because these announcements, especially something like Genesis going bankrupt, don't just happen in an echo chamber over the course of a few hours, they happen over the course of a few weeks. And so there's going to be some swath of people who at least understand that this is happening sooner than most people will. And usually if that's the case, the markets will trend in that direction ahead of time, especially when it's bitcoin ETH that are making big moves. Generally, I would say the Bitlazo nothing burger and the Genesis filing, which supposedly we're recording this on Wednesday the 18th, but expect that those are going to be positive signals to the rest of the market and people just got ahead of that five days ago.
00:04:09.470 - 00:04:46.998, Speaker A: So I don't think we're back in a bull market here. This reminds me of some like I'm probably one of those people, Vance, who you're pointing at being like dead cat bounce or bear market rally or something. That's what I would throw this bucket in. And it kind of reminds, like, if you look back at the charts from 2018 and 2019, there were, I don't know, five or six times. I feel like when the prices rallied from I remember there's that one rally in maybe 2018, it went from six or seven k to eleven or twelve k. There were four or five or six different times the prices pumped like 30% to 50% and then fell back down. I'd probably bucket this in that camp.
00:04:46.998 - 00:05:20.740, Speaker A: I think my takeaway, though, from this is that so I do think prices end up going back down. My takeaway from this, though, is I was like, one of these times will be the real time that you don't get it back. And it was just a reminder to me how quickly narratives can shift and how quickly the sentiment can shift. So for this specific 1 January 2023 pump, I think prices end up probably going back down, but one of these won't go back down. And the people kind of sitting on the sidelines, not exposed to crypto right now, will get left behind in that. So it was just a nice reminder to me of that.
00:05:22.150 - 00:05:57.440, Speaker D: What's back down? Like one k e, like 800 e. Where would you say we have a really good friend who will remain nameless for this story, who in 2015, I think, when ETH just launched. We're sitting in a hot tub in Hawaii and it had crossed a dollar 50 and we're sitting in the hot tub and I remember so distinctly this friend basically being like, I'm away till it goes back below a dollar. It never did what's? Back down.
00:06:00.450 - 00:06:04.222, Speaker E: It's not worth it trying to pick the absolute bottom. You're never going to do it.
00:06:04.276 - 00:06:05.794, Speaker C: You'll drive yourself crazy doing it.
00:06:05.832 - 00:06:11.854, Speaker E: And there's a better chance that you just end up in cash for the whole rally and just kind of generally.
00:06:11.902 - 00:06:15.826, Speaker C: Pissed off that it's all happening. It's just a matter of whether you.
00:06:15.848 - 00:06:17.460, Speaker E: Buy and how much you buy.
00:06:17.930 - 00:06:39.082, Speaker A: I agree with that. I'm not a trader. I auto buy Bitcoin and ETH. Actually, I turned off my Bitcoin auto buy, but I auto buy ETH every two weeks and just always have and just will continue doing it. And I have the middle of the Bell curve take. I just don't like thinking about it. And I just buy and then when prices drop 80%, I will buy a lot more.
00:06:39.082 - 00:06:52.510, Speaker A: And that's what I've been doing and I was buying. I am buying because I don't know. Yeah, I'm not trying to time the markets. I just don't think this specific rally is the one where we go back into parabolic bull mode.
00:06:53.250 - 00:07:20.930, Speaker B: I agree with that. This is what we talked about on the predictions episode. I still think there's some pain to work through and it depends on what you define as a bear market. But my kind of working thesis is that we've seen the bottom in terms of prices. I think that is the right question. Go back down to what? I mean, there's only so long things can go down and there are also like a bunch of positive catalysts that are out there right now. The Nasdaq is up in the last week and that was because of a CPI report.
00:07:20.930 - 00:07:41.054, Speaker B: And now CPI and inflation has turned and it's probably going to continue to go down, which sets up a dynamic for more positive surprises for the market to react to. So I don't necessarily think it's going to go parabolic from here, but I think there's more reason to be bullish than bearish. I think, at least from where I'm sitting right now.
00:07:41.092 - 00:08:28.960, Speaker A: I don't know, I think my counter to that might be like, I don't know, I'm probably overemphasizing the 2018 and 2019 bear market, but in December of 2017 we hit twenty k, or like 19 and a half, whatever it was. We had a drastic pullback down to like five, down to like seven k all through 2018 and we're like, all right, the bottom is in. And then there was that really nasty pullback to 4K in 2019, came back up, and then in March of 2020 slammed down to 3000 and then that started the bull. So I'm probably overemphasizing that specific cycle, but I think it's tough to say the bottom is like forever in. But I also don't think you should be trying to time the bottom.
00:08:29.810 - 00:08:50.294, Speaker E: Timing the bottom is usually a bad plan. The other stuff that I'm looking at within the context of crypto is the cloud index in January. And just like general tech has just been getting slammed and usually you see this very tight correlation to all the big tech names and the medium small sized tech names in crypto. Crypto and tech are decorrelated at this point.
00:08:50.332 - 00:08:51.494, Speaker C: I think that's pretty interesting.
00:08:51.612 - 00:09:16.254, Speaker E: And then the other thing that you look at if you want to use the 2018 fractal as your starting point is rates have peaked pretty convincingly. Rates peaked at 4.5, now they're down to 3.3. If you think that this cycle is liquidity and interest rate driven, we are now on the other side of that. And so it would have been pretty.
00:09:16.292 - 00:09:18.058, Speaker C: Hard to call the bottom in June.
00:09:18.074 - 00:09:28.898, Speaker E: Of last year when rates were rocketing up. I feel a little bit more comfortable now that the cycle is progressing on the other side of the rate mountain and it's going down, that's going to.
00:09:28.904 - 00:09:31.186, Speaker C: Be a huge boon to the economy versus last year.
00:09:31.288 - 00:09:35.806, Speaker E: So I'm pretty content for where we are right now and don't think there's.
00:09:35.838 - 00:09:37.700, Speaker C: Going to be a ton much more pain to come.
00:09:38.970 - 00:10:36.760, Speaker B: One thing that also might be worth noting about this rally is that this was the first bitcoin driven rally I feel like that we've seen in some period of time, which regardless of whether or not you think that's the way that it should be is like when I see that, that just reminds me of a healthy that just points a more healthy, organic sort of rally. I'd be curious, there was a tweet from Ryan Watkins who is the ex analyst at Nasari and is now has synchroncy capital and it was basically something to the effect of we can link it in the show notes, but it's like the big driver of cycles moving forward is going to be the ETH innovation cycle. And he kind of listed different platforms. He basically implied it's been this way for a while, but it was like ICOs, then DeFi, then NFTs. I'd be curious what you guys think about catalysts moving forward. Is that like a worthwhile subject, diving into ETH, kind of leading these cycles moving forward? Do you think it's going to continue to be Bitcoin or how do you think that whole dynamic is going to play out?
00:10:39.630 - 00:11:20.230, Speaker D: So I would broadly say I agree with Ryan on the Bitcoin side. Not to say that there's anything that could change my mind, there's tons of things that could change my mind. I just don't know what the catalysts are for Bitcoin right now. The inflation narrative was kind of debunked, the balance sheet asset was kind of debunked. The innovation and applications built on top of Bitcoin. We have yet to see anything really kind of come to fruition there. And so if you think about just like, from first principles, where is the new narrative going to come from? And I agree generally, that innovation on Ethereum has never been higher than it is right now.
00:11:20.230 - 00:12:08.450, Speaker D: I actually think that new category I can't remember if he mentioned this or if this is something that I'm just making up right now, but I think layer twos is actually going to be that next category of innovation, where you're going to start to see real transaction volume. Therefore, revenue flow through layer twos, EIP 4844, is going to reduce the call data expense on layer one by ten to 100 times. That type of new aperture lens opening is something that's fundamental for this entire ecosystem, just because it means that there's new applications that previously were too expensive to run, that you can now build on top of something. With the shared security model of Ethereum, that type of cycle, I think, is real. I would probably say 2023 is going to be based around layer twos and the innovation cycles there.
00:12:08.600 - 00:12:29.900, Speaker A: Can I get your guys'take on this? The battle of the year right now, shaping up to be at least of Q one is arbitram versus optimism. If you've looked at the users and developers and projects, all of those charts, they're basically like every week they go back and forth on who's, quote unquote, winning. Do you have thoughts on Arbitrum versus optimism and who wins that game?
00:12:32.750 - 00:12:54.622, Speaker E: It's a good question. We're investors in optimism, so we're biased. I would say the first thing is that the stakes are very high. If you look at optimism, it's valued at 8 billion. That's valued like an L one. At this point, there's only two L two S. There's going to be a field of new ones launching this year scroll, the Polygon, Zkebm.
00:12:54.622 - 00:13:14.422, Speaker E: There's like a bunch of other ones. There's going to be a lot of these, and the stakes are very high. The quest that optimism has been doing have been just, frankly, like, incredible. They're doing like 50% of ETH L one transactions right now. It's all at a very low gas cost, so there's less of a hurdle to actually transacting. But that's meaningful usage.
00:13:14.486 - 00:13:16.134, Speaker C: On Arbitrum, you have this very healthy.
00:13:16.182 - 00:13:59.218, Speaker E: DeFi ecosystem led by GMX. I don't think GMX is a great model. I think it's going to blow up at some point. But you have this DeFi ecosystem that's taking shape and Arbitram, I would say it looks a little bit more mercenary than optimism does, the missionary ethereum camp, but that's my high level take on them. It feels like optimism has a little bit more of the Ethereum Ethos, which is what we ultimately want to invest in. But I think the open question for each of them is what is the token used for and how does it accrue value and what is the long term roadmap for it? Optimism is very focused on public goods and distribution of the coin to everyone who uses optimism. Arbitrum kind of hasn't revealed those plans yet, but that'll be the next shoe.
00:13:59.234 - 00:13:59.978, Speaker C: To drop and I think you're going.
00:13:59.984 - 00:14:03.260, Speaker E: To see a lot of acceleration on both of those camps as a result.
00:14:04.110 - 00:14:19.840, Speaker D: I mean, obviously it hasn't been talked about yet. It's probably the worst kept secret that there are probably fittings for an Arbitrum token. When do you think that launches and what do you think the differentiation would be between the Op token and.
00:14:24.570 - 00:15:12.982, Speaker E: Mean optimism's? Token is know thinking about it, it should be used in some sort of mechanism to auction off the role of being the sequencer. The sequencer is still centralized, they still need to decentralize it. Adding a token and shifting who sequences what and when based on their token holdings is probably the next thing that they do. Arbitrum doesn't really have that exact same security model and so that's not really as relevant of a token use case. But the things that we see in Arbitram are they take a very anti mev approach. Like they say that things should be sequenced in the order that they're requested. There shouldn't be that much room for people to back run or front run or do things like that and so I think that they'll end up internalizing the MEB as well but just in a different kind of way, I would say.
00:15:12.982 - 00:15:19.498, Speaker E: But they might look somewhat similar from the outside but they'll be totally vastly different economic models if you ask a.
00:15:19.504 - 00:15:55.800, Speaker B: Question just as well. I also love optimism and like Ben Jones, I totally see what you mean with the missionary type vibe but I'd be curious as investors in that project, how much do does the token sort of structuring play into things? Because not meant as like a dig but there's like a decent overhang in terms of fully diluted valuation of optimism versus the circulating supply today. So how much do you guys kind of take into account that whole structure or is it more of like I guess I'm just curious, is it more of like an equity kind of player? How does that work?
00:15:56.810 - 00:16:52.614, Speaker D: So I have yet to see, and I think we can kind of uniformally say the same across the board, but I've yet to see something that accrues a value to both the equity and the token. It really does come down to are you a token based company and are you building for that type of an ecosystem or are you a company and your value is going to accrue to your equity and you can't really do both? Or I've yet to see a model that works for both. When we're talking about making any investment, the only value that we really ascribe to things is what's the fully diluted valuation and that's how we make investment decisions. I would say normally for the most part, what we do is think about getting a sizable amount of ownership at a lower valuation and making a more concentrated portfolio of investments as opposed to other firms. That's just kind of the way that we like to invest. And so that's a difference with us. I would say.
00:16:52.614 - 00:17:18.270, Speaker D: We invested in a later round of optimism, more for the ethos and the narrative of decentralization and supporting that ecosystem. We also have a number of projects that we have more of a concentrated ownership of that are built on top of optimism. And so it just matches with our thesis, but it is a fully diluted valuation that we are looking at and thinking about.
00:17:18.420 - 00:18:05.994, Speaker B: Makes sense. Should we talk a little bit? This news broke like 30 minutes before we recorded this, but there's basically an update on Genesis and DCG as our structuring. So we talked about this in one of our last roundups, basically just talking about what a bankruptcy might look like. So it looks like creditors for this is reported by the block, but Genesis creditors may be negotiating a bankruptcy. So essentially there would be a period of like a forbearance period of between one to two years under a prepackaged bankruptcy plan and that would be in exchange for cash payments and equity in DCG. And basically right now they're negotiating the terms of what the Chapter Eleven filing would look like. So again, this is not something that's been this isn't in stone.
00:18:05.994 - 00:18:28.920, Speaker B: This is still like sort of rumor mill, I would say. But what do you guys think? This is kind of exactly what we said might happen, right? They're time to pay back the debt and some conversion to equity. So I think the reason why this could be interesting is just removes one of the things that's sort of seen as an overhang or something, another shoe that might drop. So I think it kind of seems like good news, but what do you guys think?
00:18:29.610 - 00:18:58.942, Speaker E: It's exactly what we talked. Know Barry Barry payment program where he works it out. They put Genesis under. They don't have the protracted fight over is DCG. Genesis is genesis DCG and he just gradually pays them out. It feels like this is a plan where they get access to a lot of the cash, assets and equity of DCG without actually having to fight them for it. Or when you put DCG into bankruptcy, having lawyers and people like that and liquidators administer it just mean you're going to bleed value.
00:18:58.942 - 00:19:40.320, Speaker E: So I think this is generally a best case outcome for everyone. My question is, what happens to Gemini? They still have 900 million dollar hole in their balance sheet. Like I've said before, they do very little spot volume. If that is even like 100 million or 200 million dollar haircut, I'm pretty sure the equity value of Genesis is negative. So unless they're planning on giving portions of Mars Junction ticket sales to creditors or selling some of their bitcoin I don't know what the twins do, but yeah, it's good to just see everybody formally taking responsibility, putting it under, drawing up a plan to pay back creditors and kind of putting this to bed.
00:19:42.850 - 00:20:53.138, Speaker D: The thing that I would note, and let's just assume that the reporting that exists right now is what will be the actual outcome, probably going to find out in the next day or two. What I think is important to note is this is fundamentally different from basically every other bankruptcy that we've seen so far in the crypto space because you're coming into whatever chapter Eleven, chapter Seven, chapter 15 proceedings with a plan, and you've already come to basic agreement with the creditors. Whereas when you look at Voyager, Celsius, FTX, all the others that are currently going through the process right now, you just frankly are hoping and planning and waiting for some type of resolution and looking at and I think Vance had to jump to a call looking at just like how everything else is working out. If you look at the Twitter feeds of Voyager Unsecured creditor committee, it's just a complete mess. And that mess is going to take a long time to unravel. Not everyone is going to be happy. Like there will be people that are favored or disfavored in the process because it's not an easy, clear cut example.
00:20:53.138 - 00:21:10.250, Speaker D: And so if this proceeding is coming to the actual filing with a plan in place, not only to Vance's point does it save time and therefore a ton of money, but it also just makes it really simple for everything to process and it'll process a lot faster than the others that are currently ongoing.
00:21:10.590 - 00:21:39.300, Speaker A: Is this a save time or buy time type of deal? Because when I was reading, I mean, the deal just dropped. So I've been reading about it, but it seems like the TLDR is that Genesis is in default, but really they're trying to buy time to work out the issues, but as they try to buy time, creditors want to get some value in return for the time. So to get a deal done with the creditors, one of the things that DCG, the parent company, is offering is equity in the parent company. Do I understand this correct or am I way off?
00:21:40.070 - 00:22:27.394, Speaker D: No, no. You're know, I haven't kept up on it as it's happening in real time since we've been on the call, but let's assume it could be both buy time and save time. It could be either or it depends on how it's all structured. So if you're able to basically call off the creditorship and have the creditors not force a Chapter Eleven proceeding where everything goes on the balance sheet, everything kind of goes up in smoke and you just kind of like see where the chips fall eventually. This could be a model that saves that Chapter Eleven official proceeding and the process that everybody is going through that I was referring to and just buys time for the creditors to not force bankruptcy. So it really depends on the details, but I don't know, it could be other way.
00:22:27.512 - 00:23:20.894, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens with Gemini is yeah, that's interesting. Gemini's got a proposal right now. There's a new poll on Maker that actually has to get voted on by today. I think it's tonight or tomorrow morning, but there's a new Maker poll that was launched to determine whether the GUSD PSM debt ceiling should be reduced, and if you lowered it to zero, that would effectively eliminate the GUSD PSM. What is the voting right now? The last time I checked this morning, the option was to leave the GUSD PSM at 500 million. So if that went through, if that won, then Die would continue to be backed by GUSD through Gemini. Yeah, I still haven't voted yet and actually, I would love to get your guys'take.
00:23:20.894 - 00:23:47.600, Speaker A: I'm kind of unsure how to vote here. On one hand, I would like to support Gemini and support them, and I think the Gemini Maker partnership has been really strong for a long time. On the other hand, I'm like, do you want to why expose yourself to that risk if you're a maker? So I'd be curious how you guys would handle this if you were me.
00:23:51.010 - 00:24:40.878, Speaker B: I also really like the Winklevoss twins. Like, they've done an enormous amount for the space and Gemini is a great company. But let me ask you this. Would you rather hold USDC or Gemini dollars? I'm just kind of like, what is backing that? Like, I think it is appropriate to ask the counterparty risk that you're taking on at this. Like, this was a really tough situation that the twins had to face, I think, because I sort of do agree with Vance's take that I don't think there's going to have to be another side of the ledger for that $900 million. Basically, that's what I think. Either they need to make customers whole or they cannot make customers whole, but their reputational capital is going to take a hit.
00:24:40.878 - 00:24:53.714, Speaker B: And this might be the way that it appears because if it was me and I'm looking at Gemini as an issuer and a creditor, I'm kind of like, doesn't look quite as solid as it did twelve months ago.
00:24:53.912 - 00:25:18.290, Speaker D: Reputational capital has taken a hit. It's not is going to take a hit. Already has. And yes, I agree, they've done a lot for the space, been promotional for the space and representing the space, but they took $900 million of customer capital and gave it to one counterparty. That decision in and of itself is troublesome.
00:25:18.450 - 00:25:47.090, Speaker A: Yeah, there's another thing going on with Maker right now that's actually pretty interesting. That hasn't really gotten much news. So they did a deal with Coinbase a couple of months ago, if you guys remember that. So right now the implementation is going through. And there was a new post that got made that kind of did not get much attention. I didn't see it anywhere. But there was a bullet that I was reading last night that says coinbase retains the ability to veto a withdrawal of USDC by Maker Governance.
00:25:47.090 - 00:26:40.500, Speaker A: So someone asked a question, why does this have to happen? Hold on, I'll read it. And Seb on the Strategic Finance Core unit at Maker was like, the veto is needed for Coinbase to follow their custody procedures. And then he goes, It is what it that I've been thinking about their deal with Coinbase and then Makers deal with GUSD and Gemini. And I'm like, originally, I like the Coinbase thing, but I'm like, man, I'm not sure this is the right way to be going to be putting more and more stuff in these centralized exchanges. Even though Coinbase is very reputable, it's like, I don't love that they have this ability to deny any withdrawals. I don't know, maybe I'm overemphasizing that one bullet point here. And I know it's probably the legal team at Coinbase needs this to happen.
00:26:43.190 - 00:27:11.420, Speaker B: It's kind of interesting. Not that this really is that, but this is ultimately where this is going. What ends up trumping something? A governance vote, a company's terms of service or a law, you know what I mean? They're kind of like ships passing in the night right now. And some people weight those very differently. I don't know. At some point, Rubber is going to need to meet the road as, like, Dows. If they continue to interact with companies, there has to be some way that they can talk.
00:27:11.420 - 00:27:39.970, Speaker B: I'm kind of on your page. Well, you know what? I don't really know the financial situation of Maker, but I think this was going to represent, what, like $30 million worth of revenue? So I guess I would kind of weigh the revenue against how much Runway I have as an organization. And then I would try to get some amount of risk. Right? Like, what's the risk that the PSM gets disrupted and I need to pull those funds to stabilize it, and I can't because Coinbase might be in trouble.
00:27:40.050 - 00:27:40.246, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:40.268 - 00:27:51.018, Speaker B: Because the reason why you'd have to defend the peg is because there would be some market trouble and then maybe Coinbase is in trouble at the same time. Actually just talking that out loud. I probably wouldn't do it unless they need the money.
00:27:51.184 - 00:28:18.690, Speaker A: Yeah. My frustration with it is that Coinbase never they weren't upfront that this was the original their original proposal was great. Super thoughtful, really well baked out Maker. I think we asked a lot of good questions. They had really good responses. This was never mentioned. So I think that's where my frustration is coming from with Coinbase is like, this should have been super clearly labeled that this was a requirement.
00:28:20.070 - 00:28:24.130, Speaker D: Yeah. Not saying big fans of Coinbase.
00:28:26.170 - 00:28:26.486, Speaker A: We.
00:28:26.508 - 00:29:23.302, Speaker D: Work with them in a. Number of different ways, and not saying that this is the case, but it does remind me that what we're seeing on the venture side and what we're talking about with a lot of our portfolio companies is we're kind of entering the market phase of like, you show me the valuation, I'll show you the terms. And it's really one of those models of and we've seen this with a number of portfolio companies that are going back to market to raise continuation or bridge financing. It's not the same market that it was twelve months ago when they raised their seed round or their Series A, and they're having to negotiate on the finer details. And it's not the typical YC safe that they're using. It's a ripped down and deal point negotiated conversation every single time. And it just feels like one of those continuation examples of this is just where we are in the market.
00:29:23.302 - 00:30:32.606, Speaker D: And yeah, maybe I'm over indexing on the venture side, but it does feel like that's the case on the venture side as well. This is exactly what I mean by I'll show you the terms kind of perspective, which is if you want to raise at the same valuation. So in a lot of these market cycles, what actually does matter in these fundraising events is what is the valuation? Because not only does that set the structured things or the typical things like stock options for employees or what the strike price is on those stock options, but it's also just like narrative building, where if you have a down round that could be a morale hit, it could hurt you in terms of the executives that you're trying to recruit. There's just a lot of bias that goes into whatever the valuation is. And if the, if the, if the valuation is trending up, or if it's trending down, like, there's a lot that's baked into that. And so for founders, there's really a strong prerogative to maintain or increase the valuation at each round. But what that comes with, with a market like we're seeing right now is that's just not where the market is going to be, especially if someone raised in the last twelve months, or frankly, the last 24 months.
00:30:32.606 - 00:31:26.334, Speaker D: It's unlikely that you're going to be able to see the same valuation unless business metrics are really increasing. And so what a lot of investors will do in times like these, when you're talking about a continuation or extending financing, is they're going to bake in controls. It could be governance, it could be financial, it could be business oriented controls that enable just more security from an investment perspective. So this could be liquidation preferences, this could be superior convertible debt to everything that exists so far. It could be superior pro Rata rights, where they get actually more ownership in the next round, or more opportunity to invest in the next round. If there is a next round, it could mean a number of different things. And you can kind of get really creative if you really want to in terms of what goes in.
00:31:26.334 - 00:31:57.434, Speaker D: But these controls can ultimately hurt the founders and the employees of these companies. If and when there is some liquidity event. If, let's say the Series A investor has three times liquidation preference. That means that they get three times their money out and then they participate in whatever is left from the liquidation of the company. And that could really hurt in terms of what value is left for anyone that's been working there. So it is kind of entering that cycle. We've seen it a couple of times with some of our portfolio companies that are coming back to market.
00:31:57.434 - 00:32:03.850, Speaker D: I think it's probably going to continue for the next year as well. So just as a cautionary tale?
00:32:06.270 - 00:32:23.102, Speaker B: Yeah. And what would you say, Michael, in terms of liquidation preference? That's super helpful. I think it's kind of non intuitive for a lot of founders out there. What's kind of like a standard, right? It's like three X or 1.5 X or is there a standard at all? Or what's?
00:32:23.166 - 00:33:07.182, Speaker D: Crazy versus So the market or what is considered market terms will change with, I would say the broader market. What is typical is one times Liquidation preference. So basically what that means is if there is a liquidation and there is $10 million that are put into the company, investors get their $10 million back is kind of like what is standard? Once again, sometimes these liquidation preferences could be multiples, where it's two, three times and then it's participating preferred shares, where you're getting the liquidation preference, and then you're participating pro Rada with your ownership of what's left. So these can get pretty dicey pretty quick.
00:33:07.316 - 00:33:24.390, Speaker A: Michael, do you guys have a standard? You always do one times liquidation or something like that. Or is it based on the valuation? So if it's a really crazy high valuation that you think is too high, you might go to 1.5. Or, like, if it's a pretty low valuation, you're really happy with it. You would do like no liquidation preference. Or is it more standardized?
00:33:24.970 - 00:33:57.210, Speaker D: It's very standardized for us. As I was describing with the optimism example, it's an atypical investment for us because of the size and it was more of an ecosystem investment. And because of that, most, I would say 95% of the investments that we make are at the earliest stages. So seed or series a and because of that, the valuations aren't out of whack relative to where the business is or the product is, or where the founding team is. And so we just have a very standard one times non participating preferred shares.
00:33:57.290 - 00:34:21.938, Speaker B: Interesting. So, yeah, founders out there just be aware. Right? People need money. But also you can lock yourself into a structure that's tough right on the event. Like a successful exit, the window gets smaller and smaller. The more you add these sorts of things. Michael, I'd be curious to get your and I know Vance has a lot of perspectives on this, but one thing that we haven't really covered very much on the show, let's talk about ETH in two buckets.
00:34:21.938 - 00:35:08.514, Speaker B: Like, maybe we could talk a little bit about deflationary ETH, which is starting to make the rounds on Twitter. And then maybe we can talk about the Shanghai upgrade, which will allow people to take their money out. We've talked their ETH out of the unstake, their ETH basically, we talked a little bit about this, but there's been a lot of confusion about how the queue kind of works and all that sort of stuff. So maybe just like, frame the context of the debate around, maybe we could use this as a jumping off point. First of all, there's been pushback from the Bitcoin community, right? I think it was Alex. Oh, gosh, I'm blanking on his last name, but he tweeted out like, ETH is advertising a 7.5% yield, which I like Alex a lot, like, had him on the show a number of times, but also I don't think that was a super in good faith kind of tweet.
00:35:08.514 - 00:35:24.220, Speaker B: So maybe you could describe a little bit, Michael, about where that 7.5% yield is coming from, and then it'd be good to just get your thoughts on this whole burn and having ETH have a deflationary monetary model and why that's a good thing.
00:35:24.990 - 00:36:16.540, Speaker D: Totally. So I'm not exactly sure where seven and a half percent comes from. What we usually track is just like, what are the general Staking providers actually providing? So Lido is one of them, coinbase with CBE is another one. It seems that those are in the like, and then there's like, rocket pool there's. Statewide, there's a number of these providers, right? And it seems like most of those over the last 30, 60, 90 days since the merge have been on the order of about four and a half to five and a half percent on average. There was that period of time, I think in early to mid October, where you saw the amount of activity on ETH really ramp up pretty drastically. And those Staking rates, I think Lido actually hit above 10%.
00:36:16.540 - 00:37:19.550, Speaker D: And that's just like, because of the amount of revenue that's flowing through the protocol in the form of gas fees that people are using to pay for transactions on the protocol, it really ramps up the amount of percentage return that you can get from Staking. So what's advertised, I'm not sure, but that's basically where it comes from. And what's different about this versus just about any other protocol that's generating, quote unquote, revenue, is that this is real yield as opposed to nominal yield. And the difference is how much ETH is needed to be created. Every single block that this revenue is flowing through to be able to actually get to that yield percentage that I think is a major difference between ethereum or any other protocol. But that's one of the reasons why we believe that the nominal yield is something that you probably shouldn't look at when evaluating any of these protocols. And real yield is really kind of the core metric that needs to be evaluated.
00:37:19.550 - 00:38:08.286, Speaker D: In addition to that, there is this concept of deflation. Within the protocol itself, there's a percentage, I think it's about 85, 90% of the transaction fees that are going through each block that are burned in the form of the EIP 1559 burn mechanism. Just this last weekend, ETH went officially deflationary since the merge. It happened previously, I think, in October or November, and that went inflationary. Again, this is all basically just a byproduct of the amount of gas fees that are being charged every single block for these different transactions. And when they reach above a certain threshold, each of these blocks is net deflationary. And then if you strain a long enough period of them together, you get to net deflationary perspective as well.
00:38:08.286 - 00:39:16.582, Speaker D: And so you can kind of bucket this again and credit to Hal Press from Northrock Digital, who really kind of coined this concept of you're creating the revenue model of the staking returns themselves, which is mostly based around people using the protocol. And so that's the real yield. But within the real yield, there's also the deflationary percentage that you can factor in because your ownership in the protocol itself goes up if it's net deflationary versus inflationary. And so you put these two numbers together and that's where you get to the point of having something that if it's four and a half, five and a half percent of nominal staking yield that you get just from staking the tokens themselves you can bake in whatever the net deflationary percentage is on an annualized basis into what your real yield is. So anyways, long babble there, but I think broadly, that's how you would get to a lot of the metrics around what the staking percentage is. In addition to that, there's this concept of mev boost that I think Lido is really supporting right now. And as more stakers go through the Lido ecosystem, MAV actually flows back to the stakers themselves.
00:39:16.582 - 00:39:21.330, Speaker D: So that's why you would see somewhat different staking percentages on these different providers.
00:39:21.490 - 00:39:59.954, Speaker B: I think it's a super interesting experiment because I forget we talked at one we had some discussion on one of these, just about inflation and what you get for the inflation. And ETH's been around for almost ten years now, like nine years, I guess, later this year. It's hard to think of that many assets that actually have a net deflationary issuance policy. There just aren't very many examples. Even like, huge, very mature companies have some sort of inflation schedule. Like if you just looked at stock based comp and periodic sort of equity raises and stuff like that. So I'm just very curious to see how it all works out.
00:39:59.954 - 00:40:28.186, Speaker B: I think it's like amazing for ETH holders. There's also something really elegant about the design of the system if you think about it in terms of like it's a self balancing, like monetary policy which is what I kind of wish existed in TradFi. Right. You kind of remove a lot of the human decision making and panic which is basically what the Fed's been doing for two years and you just put it right there in the code and honestly it's like a very compelling value proposition. I sort of find it. I don't know. That's my take.
00:40:28.368 - 00:40:28.934, Speaker A: I agree.
00:40:28.992 - 00:41:03.800, Speaker D: I think the fact that it's deflationary and I think as more activity increases over time you're going to see it continue to get deeper and deeper into deflationary status. Just with I think it's like 15 GWe. If it's over 15 GWe blocks are net deflationary, something like that. But it's a massive financial experiment. You've got this multi hundred billion dollar asset class that has a ton of activity flowing through it in a natural way that is now deflationary. That aspect alone is going to be fun to watch.
00:41:06.170 - 00:41:49.298, Speaker C: There's a concept in energy markets called like peak oil when people thought that we had discovered all of the oil that would ever exist and the world was net short oil relative to population and economic growth and that drove this whole narrative of oil going up. It didn't end up being right but it was a very powerful meme and narrative. I do think with ETH, there is a strong chance that the maximum number of ETH that will ever exist at the same time is actually in the like I don't know if we'll ever go inflationary again, but there's a good chance that we've already seen peak ETH and I think that is going to be a meme that drives a lot of kind of the scarcity dynamics of ethereum.
00:41:49.394 - 00:42:23.454, Speaker B: You know what else is fun? Do you guys know Paul Ehrlich? Did you guys see? He came out with something recently. It was back in the news. He's this like academic biologist type guy. He came out with something called the population bomb about I think like 30 years ago or something. It ended up being extremely influential. A lot of people adopted this idea that the biggest problem humanity was going to face was overpopulation and you were going to have famine and starving and we weren't going to have enough food to feed all these people and now it's like the exact opposite. Like the biggest problem every nation is facing.
00:42:23.454 - 00:42:35.560, Speaker B: It's like they have horrendous demographics and they're not going to have enough people and they need to fix it through immigration. But it's just a funny because I know peak oil is like a hilarious thing too. It's just like that was so wrong.
00:42:38.250 - 00:42:47.482, Speaker A: I feel like I know people who didn't have kids because either overpopulation or they don't want to bring kids into this bad world.
00:42:47.536 - 00:42:49.830, Speaker C: I'm like, that's so lame.
00:42:49.910 - 00:43:29.190, Speaker B: Such a lame. Okay, do you guys watch White Lotus the second course? Of course. Okay. You know that conversation that they're having and you're kind of supposed that there's like, the New Yorky San Francisco y kind of couple. There's like, uh, what's her know that couple? And then there's like, the couple that's supposed to be kind of like they're like in an open marriage type scenario, like, kind of douchebags you're not supposed to empathize with that. And she says something to the effect of, I wouldn't want to bring a kid into this messed up world. And the other couple was kind of like, that was a nuts thing to say.
00:43:29.190 - 00:43:40.118, Speaker B: And I was like, I'm on board with you. That's an insane thing to say. People have had kids through wars and way worse than what's going on right now. I just think that's yeah, I don't.
00:43:40.134 - 00:44:12.370, Speaker A: Know if you brought up the population bomb because of did you see the Wall Street Journal article about it, like a week ago? Oh, there was literally a Wall Street Journal article about whatever happened to the population bomb. And there was a quote in there. Let me just there's a quote in this article. It says, I was a college student when I read Mr. Ehrlich's, the Population Bomb. I took it to heart, and now I have no grandchildren, but 50 years later, the population has increased to 8 billion without any dire consequences. I was gullible and stupid.
00:44:15.030 - 00:44:17.062, Speaker C: Don't believe everything you read. First of all.
00:44:17.116 - 00:44:17.622, Speaker B: Like, what?
00:44:17.676 - 00:44:18.966, Speaker C: You read a book in college, you.
00:44:18.988 - 00:44:20.406, Speaker B: Didn'T have kids because of it.
00:44:20.508 - 00:44:22.040, Speaker C: What the hell is wrong with.
00:44:23.930 - 00:44:24.582, Speaker D: Maybe.
00:44:24.716 - 00:44:27.654, Speaker C: Like, go for a second source or just like, you base your whole life.
00:44:27.692 - 00:44:29.260, Speaker B: Off, like, what are you doing?
00:44:30.430 - 00:45:49.940, Speaker D: I highly suggest, if you're interested in this topic, listening to or reading anything Peter Zehan promotes and discusses. I know Vance has read the books, but he's got a number of great books, and I think he just did a Joe Rogan podcast where he had a couple of interesting perspectives. The first is what happens when the population table flips upside down. Basically, what's happening exactly right now in Russia, what will happen over the next 30 to 40 years in China? What has been happening in Japan since the 90s is that they're not going to be able to support the economy or basically the population going forward because you don't have anyone in their twenty s and thirty s that is able bodied and able to help support the growing population of elderly people. In the his perspective, broadly, as it relates to Ukraine, Russia right now is that this is the last decade where Russia would be able to try to retake any further territory because they just don't have the population growth to be able to support an army any decade other than right now. So it is something that affects not just the way that we think about these populations, but the economies in the future of which countries are going to be powerful versus not.
00:45:51.350 - 00:46:35.326, Speaker C: I like Peter Zahan's demographic stuff that feels like the best work that he does when he gets way out there into geopolitics or crypto. He was drawing battle lines on this map. I'm following them early last year, trying to figure out, okay, if Russia goes here and Ukraine's over here, what happens to crypto prices? And I remember near the peak of fear around Russia and Ukraine, I was talking to Michael and being like, hey, we can get Peter Zeihen to come talk to us for an hour for $14,000. Should we do it? And Michael is like, Absolutely not. This is too much emphasis on this one thing. Peter's great, but he gets a lot of stuff wrong. And I don't think he's that he.
00:46:35.348 - 00:46:54.934, Speaker A: Sounds really smart and I know a lot of people. I like him. I like listening to him. I've heard him on I didn't listen to Rogan, but I've heard other things and, like, read snippets of the book and have subscribed his newsletter for years. If you go back. He's also been calling for the downfall of China since 2007. There's like many because I've been subscribed to him for a long time.
00:46:54.934 - 00:47:07.210, Speaker A: Like 2008, he said, China will be done in ten years. 2009, China will be done in ten years. 2010, China will be done in ten years. So that's my pushback.
00:47:08.270 - 00:47:14.270, Speaker D: Tom Lee would tell you, you don't necessarily have to be right all the time. You just have to extend your time horizon.
00:47:15.650 - 00:47:17.162, Speaker C: Just add some duration.
00:47:17.306 - 00:47:54.246, Speaker B: Add some duration. Yeah. The China thing is pretty nuts. It's like his estimate of the working age population of China is that's going to get cut in half in the next, like, 25 years? Which even if he's off a little bit on that, I mean, China's population shrank this year for the first time, and I forget for a really long time. Yeah. So it is pretty interesting in terms of major headwinds, but can we talk a little bit? Can you guys give us I'm not sure if you know the exact mechanism. There was a lot of confusion on Twitter just about how the withdrawal queue is going to work with Shanghai.
00:47:54.246 - 00:48:10.320, Speaker B: So I don't know if either of you could give us some color on how that might work and then how that might translate into because it's been a good couple of weeks for liquid staking derivatives providers like Lido and Rocket pool. So maybe we could talk about how that impacts their businesses too.
00:48:12.210 - 00:48:59.342, Speaker D: So I don't know if anything has changed. We're not probably the number one topic. There would be probably a couple of people on our team that would be a better example to discuss this. But our understanding is that there will be a certain amount of available to be going into the withdraw queue at any given point in time. And based on that queue and the amount as a percentage of what is staked will determine how long it takes for that queue to basically work its way through. And it's a decay curve that as there's a higher and higher percentage of withdrawal requests, it'll take longer and longer for those withdrawal requests to happen. And off top of my head, I think if it's like 10% of the state, so let's say there's 16 million right now, 1.6
00:48:59.342 - 00:49:14.740, Speaker D: million wants to be withdrawn, it's something like 21 days for 10% to get itself worked through. Once again, I'm not sure if that's exactly how it will process or if there's more fixed terms that go into that, but that's our understanding of how it'll work.
00:49:15.350 - 00:49:24.920, Speaker A: We had one of our analysts, Westy, put out a really good thread. We'll link in the show notes about the whole exit queue and how it all works. So we'll put that in the show notes, too.
00:49:27.710 - 00:49:46.542, Speaker D: Yeah, I think broadly speaking, it's probably going to be a shit show when things are enabled, and it'll be like a few days or a week of up, down, sideways, who knows? But I think, as this stuff usually does, once it goes through and cycles through, it'll be fine.
00:49:46.676 - 00:49:47.360, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:49.490 - 00:49:51.470, Speaker A: What do you guys know about Bithloto?
00:49:52.470 - 00:49:55.300, Speaker D: Absolutely nothing. Didn't even know the name.
00:49:55.910 - 00:49:57.006, Speaker B: I thought it's so funny.
00:49:57.038 - 00:50:10.854, Speaker A: It's like DOJ sitting there like, all right, time to go after the big crypto blow. Yeah, definitely. Let's go after the big crypto blow ups. All right, who should we go after? Probably like three arrows. Those guys seem like schmucks. Genesis. All right.
00:50:10.854 - 00:50:18.600, Speaker A: FTX. Celsius. No. Bits. Lotto. Baby. I never even heard of this thing.
00:50:19.050 - 00:51:06.890, Speaker C: I mean, if you had used Bits lotto, I don't think you'd tell anybody about using it. I think that's why you haven't heard of it, because you use it for what I assume is a very specific know if you're in Russia getting money out or something like that. I think they also got the twofer here, which is, you know, someone crypto, you take them down, you also get to bash Russia a little bit. But the dead giveaway on the announcement was when it was the Eastern District of New York that was doing the announcement and prosecution instead of the Southern District of New York. And our guy Damien Williams, who is moving at lightning speed. We generally assume the Southern District of New York gets the highest profile cases, but I guess if you're breaking the rules and they take you off the map, that's not exactly a bad thing. So certainly not like a negative development.
00:51:06.890 - 00:51:41.906, Speaker C: They're just cleaning up the space a little bit. Both the charts? Yeah. I mean, like, those figures, it's always hard to tell how accurate they are. Like, are you counting both the deposit and the withdrawal of one type of currency, like, you double counting the 700 million TBD. But they must have found something that was like the smoking gun, which said that all right, this is facilitating people exiting Russia via new financial rails into the US. Or something of the like.
00:51:42.008 - 00:52:09.638, Speaker A: Oh, this is interesting. I just went to Bits lotto's website. I'm definitely about to get hacked or something. Bun. It's a French notice, and it says something in French that I don't understand. But then below that, it says, this service has been seized by the gender meri national cyberspace Command under the authority of the French Paris prosecutor's office as part of a coordinated international law enforcement. Didn't realize.
00:52:09.638 - 00:52:13.790, Speaker A: I didn't realize that. I didn't realize it was the French teaming up with the US. I don't know.
00:52:13.860 - 00:52:17.440, Speaker D: It probably just means that that's where they were using the hosting service from.
00:52:19.570 - 00:53:04.814, Speaker C: When you go to a website and you see this domain has been seized by the FBI warning, that's like a watershed moment in people using the Internet. They're like, oh, shit, this can get real very quickly. Yeah, you're now on the list. Speaking of well, I guess they kind of did take down the Pirate Bay in one fell swoop, but there really hasn't been any other than Ross, like, secondary culprits of that or, like, chasing the money trail of where that went and where it ended up. I'm always surprised that we never hear more about that, given that that was most of where all the bitcoin was spent and used during the early years.
00:53:04.932 - 00:53:07.358, Speaker D: There has to be Silk Road.
00:53:07.444 - 00:53:07.982, Speaker E: Sorry.
00:53:08.116 - 00:53:10.340, Speaker C: Not pirate base. Silk Road. Yeah, you're right.
00:53:12.630 - 00:53:15.380, Speaker D: I mean, Tim Draper is where it went.
00:53:16.310 - 00:53:18.610, Speaker C: Yeah, Tim cleaned up on that one.
00:53:18.760 - 00:53:19.860, Speaker B: Good for him.
00:53:20.710 - 00:53:22.660, Speaker A: Pirate Base still exists, right?
00:53:23.190 - 00:53:25.554, Speaker D: I think. Pirate base? I don't know.
00:53:25.672 - 00:53:33.334, Speaker A: Or there are alternatives. I think that was basically whack a mole. Like, they took down one pirate Bay, a bunch of alternatives popped up.
00:53:33.532 - 00:53:35.682, Speaker D: You're never going to be able to stomp that one out.
00:53:35.756 - 00:53:41.770, Speaker A: At the end of the day, people want to access BitTorrent, so there's always going to be ways to access BitTorrent.
00:53:43.630 - 00:53:57.710, Speaker D: My favorite part of that story is Tim Draper paid 40% higher than whatever the market price was for bitcoin at the time in 2014, because his perspective was that it was clean bitcoin because it was being sold by the FBI.
00:53:59.330 - 00:54:03.442, Speaker B: That's pretty funny. I kind of follow that logic, to be honest.
00:54:03.576 - 00:54:05.090, Speaker D: These are tween coins.
00:54:06.070 - 00:54:10.402, Speaker C: Tim Draper also had a savage call for 2023. Bitcoin calling.
00:54:10.456 - 00:54:11.410, Speaker A: He's still holding.
00:54:12.390 - 00:54:21.094, Speaker C: He's calling for 250K. Okay, but dig into his reasoning a little bit. His reasoning is that women are going.
00:54:21.132 - 00:54:21.880, Speaker B: To be.
00:54:24.570 - 00:54:39.866, Speaker C: I don't know if it's a 180 or a 90 degree turn, but women are going to become the driving force in bitcoin holding. It's like, man, I would really love for the industry to have more gender diversity, but I hang out in crypto a lot. All I see is, dudes, it doesn't.
00:54:39.898 - 00:54:55.460, Speaker A: Feel like, yeah, I heard that CNBC clip. He's like, women control 80% of retail spending today, only one in seven Bitcoin wallets is held by women. Bridge is going to be closed and boom, 250.
00:54:55.830 - 00:56:18.234, Speaker D: Well, the reasoning here, if you extend it to the furthest understanding, is that Bitcoin will therefore be used as a form of payment for ecommerce, but also that we're certainly going to adopt Bitcoin as a new monetary standard in ten months is really kind of the reasoning for 250K. But I think this is where one thing that I've noticed over the years of being in crypto and seeing sort of the trends and perspectives along the way and the bodies that you've passed along the way is that when you got into crypto and your mental model of how you see the world and how you see crypto fitting into it is the largest determining factor of your investment strategy. Where you work, what companies you think it will do well, what products you think will do well. And the people that are still holding on to this, like Bitcoin as the new monetary standard and going to replace the dollar and therefore going to be used for ecommerce payments writ large is still a standard. That a standard operating procedure that people are still operating under. And it kind of baffles me that people are still viewing that. It's like, have you been paying attention over the last three years within crypto? This industry moves so fast, you have to change your mental model every month, basically every couple of months, I would say, just to your better understanding of where things are moving.
00:56:18.234 - 00:56:24.240, Speaker D: But it really does depend on whatever your mental model is as basic driving force of where you see the industry going.
00:56:25.090 - 00:57:00.186, Speaker B: I agree with you on that, but I also don't understand why those have to be two incompatible mental models. Let's say you think that you sort of believe in the Bitcoin. You don't even have to believe it's going to be like, replace the dollar, but you can still be excited by that aspect of it and hold Bitcoin for that. But can't you also see everything that's going on with smart contract platforms and DApps that are built on top of them and realize that Bitcoin is not going to be it feels like people make it this binary thing that I have to be excited by this or I have to be excited by this. I feel like you could be excited by both of those perspectives now, you know what I mean?
00:57:00.208 - 00:57:37.874, Speaker C: You can be excited by both of those perspectives. I think that mental model only works in a world where Bitcoin is the biggest asset. If Bitcoin is the fifth biggest asset, and people are telling you that it's going to be the new money and all this stuff, what I'm going to say is, all right, you got. To pass those other four assets first that are crypto native, and then you can think about challenging gold and the larger financial system as we all know it. But you can be excited about that in this current paradigm. But what if it shifts? What if bitcoin isn't the biggest asset? Then it feels like that is your core risk. I don't think the risk of bitcoin right now is depreciating in USD.
00:57:37.874 - 00:57:43.320, Speaker C: I think it's the ETH BTC chart. And if that flips, a lot of that is called into question.
00:57:44.170 - 00:58:16.050, Speaker D: And I would say I totally agree with all that. I would say tim draper, vance and myself being wrong about the time is also being wrong. And so you also have to factor in how many years. How many decades is it going to take for that vision of the future to actually play out? And do you want to be spending the next 40 years of your life waiting for it versus the other micro cycles that are going to happen over the course of those 40 years? So that's broadly, I agree, you could be excited about both, but it's just a question of when.
00:58:16.120 - 00:59:06.882, Speaker B: Just speaking of random clips that were kind of funny this week, did anyone catch the tucker carlson clip about bitcoin? This didn't catch on at all, but this is so dude, I don't watch Tucker carlson, but I saw this clip and like, couldn't believe that it was real, so I looked it up. So tucker carlson has this theory, you know, there were all those plane outages, like back in end of December, beginning of this year. So he thinks there were ransomware attacks, basically that happened and that these airlines got held hostage. And he goes, well, what do you pay? Ransomware attacks in bitcoin. So what if the government is buying bitcoin to pay the ransomware attacks for the airplane flights and that's what caused this pump. I was like, that has got to be the weirdest explanation for this pump that I've seen coming out of anywhere. But honestly, I'm here for it.
00:59:06.882 - 00:59:09.758, Speaker B: I'm here for it. Tucker review that floats your boat.
00:59:09.854 - 00:59:12.820, Speaker A: Yeah, tucker is a crypto guy.
00:59:13.270 - 00:59:14.690, Speaker B: He's a crypto guys guy.
00:59:14.760 - 00:59:21.062, Speaker C: He's willing to put out crazy conspiracy theories out there to explain a 5% pump. I love that.
00:59:21.196 - 00:59:33.386, Speaker A: Wait, he thinks that the bitcoin run up was due to hackers holding the FAA hostage, which then forced the US government to buy a bunch of bitcoin to then pay off the ransomware. Yeah, I buy it. I'm into that.
00:59:33.488 - 00:59:35.900, Speaker B: Dude, you know what? I've had someone.
00:59:39.070 - 00:59:59.330, Speaker C: It'S more believable after the twitter files, when you see the FBI agents emailing the twitter customer support people to get specific accounts banned. I can now imagine a world where the FBI has a few hundred million dollars credit on coinbase and is putting in market buys and limit orders and managing east BTC. I can see it.
00:59:59.480 - 01:00:04.150, Speaker D: Do you think they're calling up their Coinbase institutional rep and being like, all right, bye.
01:00:05.850 - 01:00:07.382, Speaker C: Listen, I can see it.
01:00:07.516 - 01:00:08.198, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:08.364 - 01:00:51.038, Speaker B: Someone pointed this out to me once. Like, Tucker Carlson is not if you don't agree with him, he's kind of infuriating. But if you agree with something that Tucker Carlson is saying, it's like the best thing to listen to know, because he kind of gets on and knits his brow like this. And it's like, can you believe they're doing this? And you're like, get it's? Like, when you don't agree with let's let's close on this because we haven't really talked about this, but GTX. So there's a new exchange that's being proposed by Suzu and Kyle. Just a disclaimer, jason and I are both angel investors in this, so we're pretty biased. No, just kidding.
01:00:51.038 - 01:01:22.618, Speaker B: That would be horrendous. All right, so GTX, I actually thought again, I didn't think this was real, but I looked into it. So Suzu and Kyle, who are the founders of three AC, they're hoping to raise $25 million to start a new crypto exchange called GTX. What they're hoping to do is basically bootstrap this demand for claims. Right. So there are a bunch of FTX claims that are going to hit the market, but also there's like, Celsius and Voyager as well. So they're hoping to start this exchange with the founders of CoinFLEX.
01:01:22.618 - 01:01:37.330, Speaker B: So they're using that CoinFLEX technology basically as like a base. And then they're going to start an exchange where you can trade these claims and they're going to issue a token against it, or like USDG. USDG? Yeah, I think would be the name of the token.
01:01:39.510 - 01:01:44.050, Speaker A: Are they going to have their own claims? Will you be able to trade through those claims?
01:01:49.210 - 01:02:04.570, Speaker C: The other context here is that CoinFLEX also has a $49 million Roger Ver shaped hole in it. And so that part isn't pristine either. So it's kind of like a weird yeah.
01:02:04.720 - 01:02:17.840, Speaker D: We had also heard that they're taking auditions for other co founders, and the only prerequisite is having previously committed fraud because all four of the people of GTX or whatever it's called, have.
01:02:21.490 - 01:02:32.626, Speaker B: Yeah. Personally, I wouldn't invest just because the fraud hasn't been truly huge. Like, if they had just skilling or something on there, then I would consider it. But not quite enough fraud experience, honestly, for me.
01:02:32.648 - 01:02:34.690, Speaker D: To their advisor is SBF.
01:02:35.430 - 01:02:50.550, Speaker C: Let me give you okay, so they did something wrong, obviously, potentially very wrong. And unforgivable, CoinFLEX has a hole in it. It was giving out preferential terms to certain customers on no liquidation accounts.
01:02:50.710 - 01:02:52.060, Speaker B: That's also bad.
01:02:53.470 - 01:03:24.818, Speaker C: And I think we should be safeguarding the space in terms of pushing out the bad actors and all of that and so on and so forth. I also think at the same time, it's hard to permanently cancel someone from ever earning an economic revenue stream again. And so I obviously don't think this is a good project for them to be going after nor should really people look at it too seriously. But I don't know how much punishment is enough. After the cases resolve and all of that stuff happens, are we then going.
01:03:24.824 - 01:03:25.766, Speaker A: To be okay with these people in.
01:03:25.788 - 01:03:29.654, Speaker C: The industry or what is the exact line that we're moving here?
01:03:29.852 - 01:03:37.080, Speaker A: No, you don't let them back in the industry. You don't let Bernie Madoff go start another fund because he's been in prison for long.
01:03:40.090 - 01:03:58.974, Speaker D: Like you get barred from the securities industry very easily for committing securities fraud and that's for a reason. You can't be a director of a company, you can't be affiliated with a fund, you can't be a registered investment advisor. There are clear lines and when you cross those lines, you can't come the.
01:03:59.092 - 01:04:57.758, Speaker B: Vance I hear the point that you're trying to make and I hear you on that level, but I also think there was a video actually that Kyle Davies did with who's that guy? He's a little bit out there, he's an ex hedge, the surfer dude who's now trying to do acid capital. I'm blanking on his was like, I didn't watch the whole interview, but there was a clip I saw which he was like, well, you can't make it back in your life right now is like the film know? But you can't trade. And like, there's redemption, I think, for both sue and Kyle. And I also will caveat this by saying, I don't know if outside of Twitter, they're actually working in good faith to solve this stuff, but it doesn't seem like that outside. So like step number one, you have to try to repay your creditors, right? You can't go out and build more equity value for yourself while you still have a huge debit, right. You got to go through the proper bankruptcy filings and try to pay. That's what I think I'm resisting.
01:04:57.758 - 01:05:11.750, Speaker B: And also, it doesn't really read to me. Like, they're like real contrition. Every interview that they give is like, well, a lot of other people lost money too, and, well, we made the right trade, but other people piled in after us, which is a ridiculous explanation.
01:05:12.250 - 01:05:53.990, Speaker D: Or somebody liquidated know, and it wasn't under our control at all. There's no redemption art for sue and Kyle in this industry. I agree the film rights jordan Belfort, Wolf of Wall Street, you can go off and do can, you know, squeal on all the other people and get a lower sentence if you want as well, but there's no way that they're going to have redemption. Arc and just the fact that they put this debt together and that they're going after this opportunity tells you everything you need to know, which is that they are not focused on getting any of their creditors money back. The fact that they are trying to do this again is just par for the course of who they are and what they represent.
01:05:55.610 - 01:05:56.600, Speaker B: That's fair.
01:05:57.130 - 01:06:29.150, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm not endorsing a redemption arc here. I just am very against canceled culture, especially when it's like economic disenfranchisement. But you're right, they do need to pay everyone back. They need to make things right before they can do this. It's just a shit situation. I do think the idea is somewhat interesting if you could tokenize these claims and have people trade against them, everyone who's down Bad and Voyager, Celsius, BlockFi, Genesis, whatever they would do. Like you can get legitimate volume from this type of product.
01:06:29.150 - 01:06:35.060, Speaker C: And paradoxically, this is the exact type of product that FTX would have launched had it still been around.
01:06:35.670 - 01:06:38.466, Speaker D: I mean, isn't this what this is.
01:06:38.488 - 01:06:43.620, Speaker B: What Bitfinex did with Leo? That's okay, right? Similar scheme. Yeah.
01:06:44.810 - 01:07:05.002, Speaker C: Every single crypto bankruptcy that has been administered by lawyers and administrators has gone terribly. Like Mount Gox is still winding up. Like there's other international exchanges we know of that are still winding up bankruptcies. I would argue that Leo is actually the best case scenario for any of these failed exchanges that have a hole in them. Leo was good.
01:07:05.136 - 01:07:05.802, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
01:07:05.856 - 01:07:33.650, Speaker C: And as much as we all hate SBF and all of that stuff and so on and so forth, but he was advocating for the Leo plan. Now he's under the Sullivan and Cromwell plan of like we are going to charge you a lot for this unwind. At the end of the day, I'm just not sure which one is actually better for the people that are owed money, which is the users who have money trapped on that platform. Do you want to get 100 cents in ten years or do you want to get 20? Or with some upside?
01:07:35.270 - 01:07:37.094, Speaker B: Not everything is black and white.
01:07:37.292 - 01:08:01.870, Speaker D: The other big variable here too that has yet to be figured out with a lot of these different situations is is it dollarized or is it in kind? And that I think is going to be as you see this 5%, 10%, whatever pump over the weekend. How shitty must it feel sitting there watching your holdings in kind change but you're not even knowing whether or not you're going to get that back or if it's going to be based around some July deadline.
01:08:02.850 - 01:08:25.826, Speaker C: That's the free option, right? If it goes up, it's dollarized. If it goes down, I'm giving you that in kind. That's why they do these things. That's why they do these things. There are games that these people play and like if you have a token that's on chain that has programmatic rights to cash flows. If I were a debtor or if I were a creditor, I would choose that. Just to be totally frank.
01:08:25.938 - 01:09:17.966, Speaker A: Michael, let me do a hypothetical here. So we all think that vance, I think that was good pushback just for the sake of the conversation, but it sounds like we all think that they should not be able to raise this money and that they should not be able To Continue With GTX, which Is GTX just A Play On FTX? Is that a real thing? Okay, so I think that should tell you everything you need to know. But, Michael, let's say that GTX actually is able to raise 25 million, and they go through with it. And it's a year from now, and they've been able to actually somehow just they raise this money, they launch, the Claims are on there, and you see a really good opportunity to make some money on GTX. But if you do it, you're supporting their exchange. You're supporting them, right? By trading or buying things. Do you use GTX? Or, like, another hypothetical? Could be, like, for my mic blockworks.
01:09:17.998 - 01:09:18.494, Speaker C: Mic?
01:09:18.632 - 01:09:29.900, Speaker A: If they came to us, they're like, we raised this money. We want to do a multimillion dollar sponsorship. Ton of money, big check for blockworks. Do you take it?
01:09:34.350 - 01:10:28.254, Speaker D: The quick answer is no. And I can't even tell you the number of investments that we've looked at, where it's like, we can put in $5 million, and we know that we're going to return $10 million, and it's going to be a quick two to three X and we can get in, get out, and move on with our lives. But the fact that over time, what you erode by doing so, is your brand. And whether it's an investment firm or a news publication platform that you guys have with blockworks, over time, you will have lower lifetime value of your customers because you will have eroded the brand. And maybe that means that you won't be able to get the next deal the next time because you were involved in this pump and dump. Or maybe it means that you're not going to get the hot star reporter because you're sponsoring GTX. There are a lot of downstream effects that I think are tough to see in the moment.
01:10:28.254 - 01:10:42.270, Speaker D: That ultimately there's a line in the sand and you don't cross it. And so we have a very particular investment thesis, and we stick with that. And yeah, we don't do things that are out of our boundaries.
01:10:43.410 - 01:11:12.854, Speaker C: Yeah, we've never taken the easy money, and we're proud of, I think, you know, Blockworks, there's a version of that where you don't do the, like, articles, know, dissolve your brand over time. I would say if you're an individual who has been robbed of money by one of these large exchanges, you're not thinking about am supporting Kyle and sue or the bad people. You look at these telegrams and these reddit threads. There are some pretty horrifying stories in terms of what happened to people who put their life savings in. They just want to get some money out. They want to trade. They want to have some sort of liquidity.
01:11:12.854 - 01:11:48.774, Speaker C: And so, yes, this is a probably bad founding team to product fit, but this is a solution that would get a lot of people liquidity in a short timeline. And unfortunately, you can't do this in the like I think they would call these securities. They would come after, you know, Asia. You probably don't get a lot of uptick there. This is a product that's going to come out of Dubai or like one of these crypto friendly jurisdictions if it comes out at all. And to be rooting against the entire idea I don't think is right. We should be looking at their proposal being like that's probably not what we're going to be choosing as far as the team who does this.
01:11:48.774 - 01:12:06.778, Speaker C: But these lawyers are submitting ten, $20 million bills every month for these bankruptcies and creditors are getting very little value for it. And so we should think about alternative crypto native ways to get people their money back if we're really kind of this self contained ecosystem that we claim we are.
01:12:06.944 - 01:12:13.902, Speaker D: Just to be clear, I completely agree with all of that. But it is the founder product mismatch that I have issue with.
01:12:14.036 - 01:12:34.706, Speaker B: Me too. I agree with that as well. I actually think it is a good idea, frankly. I kind of looked at this and was like, those guys, Kyle and sue are both smart. It doesn't have to be all 100% negative. They made some really bad choices, I think, but they are smart guys and I think this is actually a pretty interesting idea. But yeah, I mean, Jason and I, we're at an off site right now.
01:12:34.706 - 01:12:58.454, Speaker B: We just gave this whole like we kicked off to our team. But a huge part of what you're just trying to do is to your point, Michael, about brand you're trying to make it through multiple cycles and not saw your own leg off. Right. And make it so that your brand loses a lot of its that's. I think it would be a pretty easy answer, Jason, to your point of huge sponsorship, just imagine we just couldn't do yeah, it would be a pretty easy decision.
01:12:58.582 - 01:13:24.920, Speaker C: You have to have a solid foundation if you're going to build anything meaningful. Like an example of a crypto media company that didn't make it across the last cycle. Remember ICO drops, Michael. Yeah, OG. OG stuff, right. Like they just started as an ICO advertisement website and then they tried to branch out into this full throated crypto media empire and just the foundation was rotten and never worked as a result. It's hard to quantify it, but over time it really does add up.
01:13:25.610 - 01:13:27.800, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%.
01:13:30.650 - 01:13:35.590, Speaker C: And paper cuts that you don't even see, just like ways that people perceive you. Those compound.
01:13:36.250 - 01:13:36.674, Speaker D: Right.
01:13:36.732 - 01:13:47.020, Speaker B: I agree with you. Yeah, I agree. All right, fellas, this was a really fun one. Anything that we didn't get to cover or that we want to chat about?
