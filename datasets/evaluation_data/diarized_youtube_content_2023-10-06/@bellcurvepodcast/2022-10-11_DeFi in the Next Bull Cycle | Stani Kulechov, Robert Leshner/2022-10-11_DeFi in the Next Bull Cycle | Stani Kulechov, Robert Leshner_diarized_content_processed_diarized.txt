00:00:00.330 - 00:00:41.800, Speaker A: The second thing that I think is ripe for, like, a D Five reinvention is the introduction of, like, zero knowledge technologies into, like, L ones, into D Five applications into all of these things. And this is to, like, unlock, like, actual, like, institutional onchain usage. When I talk to banks and hedge funds, they're like, why would I want everyone to, like, know my position at all times? Like, that's such a disadvantage. Like, why would I want to use uniswap and get front run or have some mev extract most of my money? DeFi doesn't actually work for real Wall Street. It's like, a lot of the sentiment of Wall Street, but zero knowledge proofs and technology has the potential to change it.
00:00:43.550 - 00:01:17.434, Speaker B: All right, guys, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. This is the last episode interview episode of the season. After this episode, we're going to do mike and I are going to sit down and just kind of recap the episode and talk to you guys about season two. But for this episode, we have two giants of DeFi. We've got Rob Leshner, who started compound, and Stani Kulichov, who started Ave. If you guys don't know who they are, just actually shocking if you're listening to the show and don't know who they are. So I'm assuming everyone knows who they are, but they are two of the CEOs of two of the biggest DeFi protocols.
00:01:17.434 - 00:02:09.906, Speaker B: And we really wanted to bring them on to this episode to just talk about kind of tie the entire season together. Right, so we've talked about under collateralized lending, like fixed rates and this big DeFi unlock that we think is going to happen. And we wanted to tie that entire thing together. But then really what we wanted to talk about too, is just like, we've talked a lot about these kind of hyper specific niche areas within crypto, like fixed rates, interest rate swaps, under collateralized loans. And we really wanted to talk to them about the next DFI bull cycle, like what DFI is going to look like in 2024 and in 2025. And really excited to be joined on this episode, not by Mike. Mike is traveling in actually, I think in Africa right now, but really excited to be joined by Dan Smith, who is one of our research analysts.
00:02:09.906 - 00:02:12.438, Speaker B: So, Dan, excited to have you on this, man.
00:02:12.604 - 00:02:15.670, Speaker C: Appreciate it. Hopefully I can fill the big shoes for Mike.
00:02:16.650 - 00:02:25.002, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see. Mike has not too big of shoes to fill, so I think he'll do just fine. But what did you think of this episode? I thought it was a good one.
00:02:25.136 - 00:02:39.258, Speaker C: Yeah, it definitely was. Obviously, like, you mentioned two pretty critical people to the success of DeFi that we've seen. They've been around the space for quite a while and have a lot of insights, just that they've kind of developed over the years. So definitely two heavy hitters.
00:02:39.434 - 00:03:09.530, Speaker B: Yeah. I think you guys will really enjoy this episode. We talked a lot about just, like, tying things together, getting their take on under collateralized loans. The episode went in an interesting place talking about Dow Treasury Management, which little sneak peek is going to be one of the big themes of season two. So we talked a lot about Dow Treasury Management, talked a lot about under collateralized loans, and then tied everything together by talking about just their predictions for the next bull market in crypto. So hope you guys enjoy this. See you on the other side of the episode.
00:03:09.530 - 00:03:56.802, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to the final episode of Bell Curve. For those who have been following along this entire season, we've been exploring this big thesis that CFI's implosion will move a lot of capital on chain, and the next bull cycle for DeFi will be kicked off by fixed rates. Fixed rate lend and borrow will unlock, will enable companies and DAOs to basically borrow from the capital markets from these debt capital markets. Instead of just using equity and tokens to raise capital, that'll unlock a lot of capital flowing into the debt markets and that could potentially kick off this big debt spurred cycle we've seen. We had Vance and Michael come on talking about CFI is dead. Long live DeFi. We had Tushar from Multicoin talking about the makings of a DeFi credit boom.
00:03:56.802 - 00:04:19.134, Speaker B: We had Simon from Volt and Alan Niemberg talking about the fixed rate lending unlock. Sid and Teddy came on to talk about uncolateralized lending. Tristan and Udov talking about on chain derivatives and options. Ben Foreman episode came out last week talking about who are the borrowers in DeFi today. And today we are joined by Stani from Ave and Rob Leshner from compound. Stani, Rob, welcome to the show, guys.
00:04:19.332 - 00:04:20.318, Speaker A: Great to be here.
00:04:20.404 - 00:04:21.806, Speaker D: Happy to be here as well.
00:04:21.908 - 00:04:45.190, Speaker B: Yeah, great to have you guys. I think I want to start with maybe a basic question and then we can get deeper into the weeds. I think a lot of folks, when kind of CFI was imploding were like, this is really good for DeFi. Everyone's like, look at DeFi. DeFi made it through. DeFi didn't really blow up. And that was kind of like the main talking point, I would say, for folks in DeFi.
00:04:45.190 - 00:05:12.430, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people thought that a lot of capital would flow out of CFI and move into like, now we're, what, three, four months removed from this big CFI implosion. Do you guys think this was a turning point for DeFi or did this really only matter to those who are already in DeFi? I guess maybe. Rob, I'd have you kick it off. What do you think have been the long term impacts of this DeFi implosion on DeFi?
00:05:12.850 - 00:05:36.082, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. I think the changes are going to be more long term focused than they are short term focused in the short term, yes. There's expectations of capital movement, like, oh my goodness, we can't trust CFI things anymore. Pull your money, move it somewhere else. And that's the short term impact. But I think the long term impact is much more important. And this comes down to a common understanding and a narrative.
00:05:36.082 - 00:06:43.086, Speaker A: So I've always watched Bitcoin for the last million years, and people always viewed Bitcoin as something that it was important because it was outside of the control of established monetary policy. And everyone sort of got that over time and a wide audience was able to sort of understand this message and understand this narrative. DeFi over the past couple years has never really had a catalyst moment to help people understand the why. DeFi, in my opinion, until recently. So people have been able to say for years, stani and I and a lot of other founders have been saying, like, oh, DeFi is more transparent, it's more autonomous, it doesn't have the human error that plagues a lot of CFI and CFI businesses. But no one really got that pain point or saw it up close and personal until this summer. And this summer, everybody went from being like, oh, I'll just give all my money to that company, and they'll do a good job, to watching this CFI meltdown and say like, oh, I finally understand why DeFi is so important.
00:06:43.086 - 00:07:14.242, Speaker A: Like what these niche people have been saying for the last couple of years. This is the first event that I think is eye opening for the mass media, the mass public, the mass user, the mass politician. This is the first time I think people are starting to get it and it's not going to immediately translate into additional use. But in the long term, I think it's like a structural tailwind for all of DeFi to have an event that was an explanation of justification and a vindication of DeFi.
00:07:14.386 - 00:07:17.800, Speaker B: Yeah. Stani, how do you feel about that? Do you agree with Rob here?
00:07:18.510 - 00:08:37.010, Speaker D: Yeah, I have definitely the same vibes in the sense that we've been building together, me and Rob, for a few years now. Decentralized finance, and it's basically passion to us and something that we really care about, but also kind of like we all in decentralized finance. We still are a very small community, and there's different reasons and benefits why we're building the ecosystem. And I've been watching from this side quite a lot how the kind of like a centralized finance part works. And I personally believe whether it's like CFI blowing up or let's say banks or DeFi, none of these things are good for economy or for people who are using and trusting these systems. But what's interesting there is that we're in DeFi trying to kind of mitigate some of the risks that we've seen happen in finance where you give custody of your funds and you have lack of transparency. And crypto in general has been a space where you've seen a lot of service providers building up on the top of the open source infrastructure.
00:08:37.010 - 00:09:44.150, Speaker D: And what we've seen is that you don't really have visibility. What is happening on some of these service providers and what DeFi is fascinating. It actually provides an infrastructure where you have that transparency and you mitigate a lot of the risks and usually you care about them. As Rob said, that when things go to the wrong way. So when we actually start seeing that many of these market participants are taking excessive risk and at the same time there's lack of disabilities and you can't withdraw your funds out of these providers, and then we start to care about decentralized finance because those protocols were the only ones where many of the participants paid their loans. So I definitely think it kind of brings up the idea why we're building and why we're doing this. But unfortunately, it always requires this kind of like an event to happen.
00:09:44.300 - 00:10:13.342, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think you guys hit what was the narrative and what still is the narrative really well, which is like, okay, this is DeFi's shining moment. Everything is on chain. It's very transparent, it's auditable. You didn't have these massive margin calls necessarily, that sent CFI companies underwater and eventually caused them to really go under. There's one big difference, though, that maybe folks in DeFi don't talk about as much, which is it didn't blow up because it's over collateralized in DeFi. Right.
00:10:13.342 - 00:10:42.380, Speaker B: Which is different than how traditional capital markets work where you have under collateralized lending. I'm just curious. So in our episode with Tushar, I think it was episode two or three of this season, he pointed out that under collateralized lending without the ability to have legal recourse after a delinquent borrower is troublesome and maybe can't scale. So I'm just curious to hear how both of you guys maybe Rob, if you could kick it off, like how you guys are approaching and thinking about under collateralized lending right now.
00:10:42.910 - 00:11:18.758, Speaker A: Well, we're not so much. I think one of the things that makes DeFi so effective is that it's able to function very efficiently on chain with a very small computer program that doesn't really require much human judgment anywhere. Why? Well, all of the collateral is stored in this very small computer program. And when a user needs to be liquidated, the collateral is already there. And you don't ever have to take anything off chain. It's very efficient and simple. And when you start to bring uncollateralized into it either.
00:11:18.758 - 00:12:18.680, Speaker A: It's more complicated on chain computation and there's a lot of startups trying to do like credit scores and data analysis to be able to do smart contract driven decision. Making, which I think is still a long way away, or the recourse has to be done off chain and liquidation is slow and it's cumbersome and it's inefficient DFI, simply put, works really well with collateral. There's not yet that many examples of it working that well uncollateralized I think over time there's going to be more and more experiments. There's like 7000 startups chasing this problem right now. But DFI works today and it has worked yesterday and the year before and the year before extremely well with almost no issues for collateralized borrowing. And I just think that's because it's easy, it's trivial, uncollateralized is so much harder of a problem and DeFi didn't have any issues because we're using something that we know works. We can also scale this thing that we know works right now today.
00:12:18.680 - 00:12:41.760, Speaker A: It's not a proof of concept, it's like production grade in a lot of places. So I think that's the biggest difference is that uncollateralized hasn't been proven to work yet. C five businesses have struggled with this for so long. 3 hours capital ripped everybody's faces off. Uncollateralized is just a much harder problem set than we have all the collateral in our hands. We can liquidate it.
00:12:43.170 - 00:13:02.962, Speaker B: Think that and then Stan I want to get your take on this. Rob, do you think that you guys just won't go after the under collateralized lending market and someone else will and someone else will figure it out? Or you just think that capital markets in the future will maybe be a more collateralized system than they are today but much more efficient too because things will move faster?
00:13:03.106 - 00:13:30.554, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's a great question. I mean I do think collateral based systems are just radically more efficient. Like the majority of finance is based on collateral, not credit. I think there's going to be a role for the extension of credit based on the character and the identity of something but I just think that collateral based systems can be so much larger and so much more effective.
00:13:30.682 - 00:14:03.050, Speaker B: Yeah Stannie, Rob mentioned that 7000 startups taking on under collateralized loans and FICO and credit scores. To an outsider, I don't know if you guys have officially announced this and I'm totally speculating here but when I look at something like Lens Protocol this is maybe your guys'solution to on chain credit score FICO social reputation for lending to peers. I'm just curious how maybe two part question here how you think about under collateralized lending and what's the role of something like a lens, a decentralized social network in under collateralized lending?
00:14:03.950 - 00:15:32.194, Speaker D: Yeah, the way we have under collateralized lending today is basically I really admire the ambition of some of these kind of like projects going after the idea and also I see that many of the lending activities it's actually lending between peers that are funds that take a lot of risk. So in most of the cases it's not actually lending to finance. Some sort of impactful opportunity. For me since very beginning and before even in whole decentralized finance and finding Ethereum for me, I tried to find a way to kind of use finance in a way to provide access. And I think what we have done in decentralized finance is that we created access to this global liquidity market that works quite effectively because you don't rely on those paper agreements and you have smart contract based execution. But once you go down the line where you need some sort of enforcement, things become trickier, especially cross border loan transactions and agreements. And I think there's definitely lot of opportunity in finding more optimistic ways of actually financing and creating impact.
00:15:32.194 - 00:16:47.690, Speaker D: But the risks are completely different than it's in collateral based lending systems. I do believe that on chain data and especially like on chain social graph where you have mutual connections and you create your own graph and using blockchain a way to verify that graph, it provides a lot of value. For example being able to use that value somewhere where you're doing credit risk assessment when you are let's say moving from one country to another and using kind of like a global verified data on different use cases but solely by itself it's a bit too far away I would say. I would love to use something like a social graph or any on chain verified data, even your Dow voting record in the compound protocol or the Ave protocol and use that as additional data to verify your credit worthiness and being able to passport. But I think we're still very far away but we will see a lot of attempts because it's such an ambitious challenge to solve.
00:16:47.850 - 00:17:31.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a feeling that's going to be one of the big. I mean it's already getting funded. There are so many companies doing like FICO or on chain credit or on chain reputations, but I have a feeling one or two of them really takes off in the next bull run. Maybe doesn't fully get extreme product market fit but I have a feeling one or two of them probably do make it. One thing I want to get your take on is shoot, who was it? It was either Alan or Teddy. Maybe Teddy Woodward from notional was talking about that loans being collateralized by native tokens and whether or not this is like an under collateralized loan or a collateralized loan. Right, because I think it was like you're really just taking a bet on the business's future cash flows either way.
00:17:31.450 - 00:18:01.750, Speaker B: And it was actually Teddy from Notional. He thinks that this is going to be the cause of the next bubble which is you have tokens rally even more because of it. There's more borrowing because the token price goes up and it eventually could cause this really intense reflexive unwind. But I'm just curious like Rob, what do you think of maybe collateral, I don't even know what to call them but like loans that are collateralized by a native token of a dao and the Dow uses that to capitalize their business instead of just issuing more equity.
00:18:02.330 - 00:18:17.306, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean there's efficiencies and inefficiencies to this. We haven't really seen too many dows at the protocol level borrowing yet. It's a great idea, but it's still in its first chapter, right?
00:18:17.488 - 00:18:26.542, Speaker B: Can I just stop you there and just say why is that? And I want to hear the answer to the other question but why haven't we seen more of that? Is it because all the rates are variable? Why is that?
00:18:26.676 - 00:19:21.322, Speaker A: Well, no, I think it has nothing to do with the rates. I think we've seen very few protocols really and there's a lot of talk of treasury management in the protocol space. Even the basics of treasury management are still in chapter one for all of these different protocols and we've seen very little experimentation. We've seen a couple of different protocols go totally hog wild. But for the most part treasury management isn't that big of a concept yet at the protocol level, right? Most protocols aren't trading, they're not borrowing even in the basics of treasury management. And so borrowing for a protocol is in my mind more complicated than selling off governance tokens for a stable coin or something like that. It's just like one level more advanced of a cash management and treasury management strategy.
00:19:21.322 - 00:20:21.486, Speaker A: So I think the reason why we haven't seen too much of it yet is that we're still chapter one of just Treasury Management for protocols. And I think we will see protocols become financially sophisticated in managing their own assets at a protocol level. But it's also possible that something else entirely occurs and it just never takes off. What if instead of every protocol has to figure out treasury management, by the way, none of them really have qualified finance people? What if treasuries of protocols figure out a way to give all the money to an actual off chain hedge fund or something that is actually really good at this and has 4000 people that are unbelievably sophisticated and all they do is manage treasuries. So I don't know how it's going to shake out and what the right market structure is long term. Maybe a decentralized community is really shitty at governing and managing a bucket of money. Most of the cases so far of a decentralized community governing a bucket of money have been total fails.
00:20:21.486 - 00:20:30.042, Speaker A: So maybe that's not what happens. Maybe an outside off chain thing figures out how to manage money on behalf of protocols. Who knows?
00:20:30.126 - 00:20:53.158, Speaker B: I have a thesis on this. I want to get your take on it. I don't think communities and DAOs can manage their own treasuries. Not because they're inept and not because they don't know how to manage money. People inside of DAOs know how to manage money. It's because of the community backlash. So let's say I'm stani and I want to manage ave's treasury and I have a shit ton of ave sitting in my treasury.
00:20:53.158 - 00:21:30.220, Speaker B: If I'm today I'm like, oh, I need to get more in USDC or I need to take less risk on ave and I go sell 50% of my Ave or even 10% of my Ave. Not only could that spook the market, but your community is like, well, why are you selling Ave? You should be long Ave. You're like? No, I am Long ave. It's my company. But I need dollars, I need to sit in dollars, I need to sit in something safe. So I actually think that outsourced model of treasury management is going to be huge. Not because they're better at managing Treasuries, but because it takes away that community pressure on you to manage it.
00:21:31.550 - 00:22:53.694, Speaker D: Yeah, basically it takes the emotion out of the transaction. We've seen a few attempts on the Treasure management and it's so very basic. So I know there's like within the Ave community, there's been like a swap between Aave and balancer communities and some small kind of tweaks here and there, but I just feel like that everything has to be actually a protocol level managed thing. And something that I'm personally very excited to see where the Ave community has been taking is that there's a lot of service provider companies like Gauntlet and Chaos Labs that are providing risk services, and then you have treasure management services provided as well as a service. But effectively, it's still very early and how optimist you really want to be. And what Rob mentioned, which is very interesting, there isn't that many actually professionals in the space doing it. It's just like a lot of ideas coming in and experimentations and some of these protocols are growing substantially big enough that you can't really anymore experiment the same way as you could do with a smaller Dow.
00:22:53.694 - 00:23:18.090, Speaker D: And you need to have a lot of actually modeling and data to back up what you're doing because it's a Dow effectively. So then you have people who like the idea, people who don't like the idea. Everyone has their own stake in various of these initiatives, so it becomes very much of governance.
00:23:18.590 - 00:23:50.470, Speaker B: Yeah, the way that most protocols have raised capital is just by some sort of equity, right? Whether you call that a token or you raise a VC round, whatever you want to call it. Do you see compound and Ave raising from the debt markets in the next couple of years, either on chain debt or just off chain, like normal debt? Like is that something that you guys see happening or is equity still just so cheap in the land of tokens that there's no reason to tap the debt markets?
00:23:53.840 - 00:23:55.630, Speaker A: I'll let Sonny answer that.
00:23:59.680 - 00:24:01.020, Speaker B: For that response.
00:24:01.600 - 00:25:05.860, Speaker D: I mean, the stablecoin liquidity is quite cheap at the moment because of the market conditions, but that introduces the element of credit. But I will see some sort of whatever you borrow, right? You have to pay back, so you have to back it some interesting way. I mean, the Ave protocol is getting revenue as a reserve factor and you can use that revenue. Currently it's used for protocol development funding different developers and risk management and even actually funny as it is a bit of treasury management as well. But somehow you need to repay that whatever you borrowed protocol revenue is good but yields are going down as well. I really want to send a message that is we need more conservative approach on what we're doing because the stakes are going and increasingly going higher and that's a bigger worry.
00:25:09.320 - 00:25:48.364, Speaker B: I'm trying to pull out some things that I think could occur in the next bull market even in just like the next cycle of DeFi. I'm trying to pull some things out of you guys that maybe you guys think could happen. One thing that we've discussed on the show is like lending and really borrowing against a Dow's future cash flows. So let's use, I don't know, uniswap just because that's been one that's been in the narrative recently. Could you see uniswap borrowing on an Aave or a compound or maybe a different platform against their future cash flows or really any protocol that spits off capital? Is that something that you guys see happening in the next cycle?
00:25:48.412 - 00:25:48.576, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:25:48.598 - 00:25:50.290, Speaker B: Rob, can I pick on you for that?
00:25:51.220 - 00:26:36.930, Speaker A: Mean it's hard to think, you know, you might see know but it's one of these things that is going to be up to their community and so far we have not seen that many protocols using other protocols that's like a financial tool. And this goes back to my earlier point about just like treasury management. It's just super simple. If there was like an overwhelming need to I think they would do that. I think they would figure it out, I think they would develop a strategy for it. But I don't think there's any indication yet that there's like an important need to and that they would need to do that before some other strategy like just like selling off tokens or whatever.
00:26:41.060 - 00:27:05.688, Speaker D: I see also the ability if you have a Dow and you have token supply and if you feel like you can actually put more tokens into the market and get more new participants that are excited what you're building, that could be still way to like a serious relatively attractive model basically.
00:27:05.774 - 00:27:53.960, Speaker B: Issuance, I want to pivot a little and talk about fixed rates because Rob one of our big theses on the show and then Dan, I'm going to toss this question over to you for the next question. But Rob, one of our things that we've talked about on the show so far is like fixed rates are going to or like interest rate swaps and this whole market gets developed then we get better fixed rates, like cheaper fixed rates. I know you guys rolled out of the fixed rate thing. Sony, you guys have had something for a little while at Aave and that will unlock more capital. Flowing into that means blockworks as a company or a Dao or protocol could borrow on chain because if we're a company, we don't want to borrow variable rate because that's really risky as a company. Dan, I want to toss it over to you for the next question related to maybe something around fixed rates and yields because I think, Rob, you had pushed back on that thesis.
00:27:54.540 - 00:28:44.810, Speaker C: Yeah, so Aven compound have kind of both been driven primarily around the variable rate debt markets and somewhere around like 90 or so, even higher than that, up to like 95. 96% of the loans on Ave right now are driven by these variable rates, but they also do have this fixed rate product that kind of readjusts as the markets move, but generally stays at a relatively fixed rate. And then of course, compounds launching the they launched the compound treasury last year and now they're enabling accredited institutions to borrow at fixed rates around 6%. So, yeah, Rob, maybe I'll start with you on this one and you just kind of talked about this renewed focus on fixed rates and kind of how you see that coming in line with institutional demand and also curious around the mechanism that can ensure that 6%.
00:28:46.300 - 00:28:51.884, Speaker A: Yeah. So fixed rates, fundamentally, it's a question of fixed for how long?
00:28:52.002 - 00:28:52.284, Speaker D: Right?
00:28:52.322 - 00:29:35.850, Speaker A: Are we talking about duration risk at this point? In traditional finance, fixed rate comes with a very specific duration or maturity. Right, and so even the word fixed means very different things when it comes to DeFi and crypto markets. So, first off, I think the important thing to understand is that everyone has a different expectation of time, right? Crypto moves much more quickly than the traditional world. Like a month can feel like five years. Like so much happens in a short period of time that even when you say fixed rate, I don't think most people are expecting fixed rate like you see in traditional finance, like a ten year instrument. That would just seem like so absurd in crypto. Right.
00:29:35.850 - 00:30:21.272, Speaker A: So I think fundamentally fixed rate in crypto, in people's heads, it's like fixed for a month, like fixed for three months, fixed for what period of time, right? It's definitely not like years like we see in traditional finance as default tenor. Right. So within that, I think talking to market participants, a lot of borrowers do prefer fixed rates over variable rates. I think, and I'm speculating here that you don't see more adoption on Ave because the fixed rate is always higher than the variable rate. So people just say, like, oh, just borrow variable until it does this thing, but the fixed rate is always higher. So people just are also greedy and choose the lower rate, which is why you don't see a lot of it. But borrowers prefer fixed rate.
00:30:21.272 - 00:30:30.068, Speaker A: When you talk to them, you're like, oh, what do you want to do? What are you trying to accomplish? They all sort of like the predictability of unknown cost that can't go up on them.
00:30:30.254 - 00:30:30.556, Speaker D: You.
00:30:30.578 - 00:31:07.930, Speaker A: Don't see the same as much. I think on the supply side where people are like, it's more like idle cash. It's more like things that aren't be deployed elsewhere or there's an understanding that it's temporary. I don't think the suppliers of liquidity care as much about fixed rates. I do think there's a bias, though, on the borrower side that appreciates the predictability, especially because borrowers are like, I'm going to be borrowing for I know how long. No one else knows how long I'm going to buy a house or I'm going to invest in some startup or I'm going to do this thing. They have more of an idea of what they're doing with the borrowed assets and for what period of time.
00:31:07.930 - 00:31:42.240, Speaker A: So I think that's the next bias that is inherent in crypto. That's a little different. I think the opposite is probably true in the rest of the world. Duration and fixed is a risk and it adds risk to both people earning an interest rate and paying an interest rate. It literally just creates unnecessary financial exposure because the rates come generally from the Federal Reserve and central banks. And when they move rates, someone with a fixed rate is losing. Someone with a fixed rate is benefiting.
00:31:42.240 - 00:32:23.790, Speaker A: Who is it? Right? And that's just perceived as a financial risk to both sides of the equation. If you can eliminate that financial risk, great. So we'll see how the market unfolds. One of the things that we've done at Compound is through compound treasury, which is an institutional business built on top of the compound protocol. Focus on fixed rates for the client. So clients that are providing liquidity or borrowing from compound treasury do have a fixed rate. The terms are not in the years they're negotiated with each client, but it's in the expectation of months, not years and not like a week.
00:32:24.720 - 00:32:44.564, Speaker C: Yeah, let's focus on the shorter term. Makes a lot of sense, I think. Like we always say, a month in DeFi feels like a year. So that makes a lot of sense. And I think another great point you brought up was really around if I'm a user and I go on a lending protocol to take out a loan, I see two numbers. I'm always picking the lower one. Right.
00:32:44.564 - 00:33:11.760, Speaker C: To me it's like, okay, I feel like a lot I have this thesis that a lot of the users today that are borrowing are probably just like trying to take levered bets on an ETH position, for example, or wrap bitcoin position. So how do you see the user base today? What does the average borrower on Compound or Aave look like and how do you see that shifting going forward? Does the introduction of more lower fixed rates kind of change that into a more institutional borrower?
00:33:15.860 - 00:34:40.412, Speaker D: Well, I can say that from office perspective. One of the things that the institutions sometimes mention is having more, I would say like a stable or predictable rate is something that they are looking after as well. That helps also to understand the kind of like a business and commercial case on using something like decentralized finance sense. But I think end of the day the fixed rates become valuable when you're going into a bigger scale and a more longer term relationship with a protocol. So I think that's where it becomes very valuable. But I think over time as DeFi scales and it proves itself as a global liquidity market, I think there it's going to be a lot of opportunity. And in terms of the rates at the moment, I think most of the users within the DeFi ecosystem, they're pretty much like complaining about the lower yields which when you look at your traditional financial infrastructure and banking, it's not actually that bad, but it's obviously the best time at the moment.
00:34:40.412 - 00:35:04.070, Speaker D: But I think it's more about the predictability and being able to hedge your risk is what's valuable. But that happens when we go more into scale. 200 billion or 100 billion in DeFi is just such a tiny thing of the whole financial ecosystem. So it's still very early.
00:35:04.760 - 00:35:31.272, Speaker B: What triggers people wanting to borrow for the longer term? Right. What's a main long like a 30 year mortgage or something? Like a 30 year mortgage is not a thing that exists in nature. You have to use interest rate swaps to lock in rates. There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes of a 30 year mortgage. Obviously. What causes people to want to borrow even on a five year rate or something? Or even on a two year rate. Right.
00:35:31.272 - 00:35:40.060, Speaker B: What kicks that off? Is it just the size of the market? Is it protocols coming in and borrowing? Stani, what do you think kicks off that demand for longer term borrow?
00:35:40.640 - 00:36:44.710, Speaker D: Well, one thing I can say is that I talk to a lot of people who are using decentralized finance and in my peer group there are a lot of people who actually have most of their network in digital assets because obviously they've been working in the space for you don't say yeah. So that's an interesting thing. And some of the finance goals are for example, buying a house or paying for tuition or buying cars. So there are a lot of use cases where actually the borrowed capital is going back to the economy and you're financing a goal in real life. So not everything is actually related to borrowing from one protocol and moving the funds to another. There is actually usage and these relationships, especially when it comes to financing fully or partially your home with your unlocked capital from your portfolio, that's a long term relationship.
00:36:47.560 - 00:37:22.588, Speaker B: How important do you guys think that the ETH Staking rate is to DFI? Rob, I think you're the one who just said this like 10 minutes ago. In traditional capital markets you have the Fed and you have Libor and you have these set rates basically, and we've never had that in crypto until you could argue the stake rate, basically, and the capital that this proof of stake system spits off. Rob, do you think that this is the new base rate of crypto and that this whole yield curve gets built on the back of that base rate now?
00:37:22.754 - 00:38:15.836, Speaker A: Well, it's definitely going to be the base rate of ethereum, right? And I think it'll become the base rate, therefore of ether. And I think that's going to trickle down to most DeFi applications in one way or another. It'll change the economics of Lping ether in a uniswap pool or it'll change the economics of using ether as collateral on compound or Ave or makered out, right. It's going to change the economics of pretty much everything because there's now like a 4% opportunity cost. And I think you'll see that over time bleed into pretty much everything else that gets built in the ecosystem. And I think it'll become like the base assumption everything has to do whatever ether returns, otherwise what's the point? I'll just realize that through ether in one way or another. So I think we'll start to see over time more and more want finance applications built around the staking yield.
00:38:15.836 - 00:38:37.050, Speaker A: We're already seeing it, we're already seeing huge demand for liquid staking products, leveraging them up like hedging them, like all of this. We're going to see more and more of that as staking takes off. And two, we're going to see the interest rates from ether osmosis and be absorbed into all these other applications one way or another.
00:38:38.460 - 00:39:08.800, Speaker C: So that's pretty interesting and like you mentioned, that it would potentially change the dynamics of LP in a liquidity pool. So right now on uniswap, the most volume driving pool is the USDC ETH pair by quite a considerable margin. Do you think it would start to make more sense for that pair to become like USDC paired with staked ETH? So at least the LPs are earning a portion of that staking rewards? Or how do you see that dynamic really shaking out in terms of affecting liquidity pool?
00:39:09.140 - 00:39:10.144, Speaker D: No, I mean, I do.
00:39:10.182 - 00:39:50.130, Speaker A: So fundamentally, if a uniswap D three LP position I haven't looked lately, but let's just say like ether USDC is yielding 20%, that 20% is offset by all the impermanent loss. It's very different if you're earning 24% or 16% or whatever 4% in either direction. There's a big difference when the total yield to cover all of the impermanent loss is not that huge to begin with. If it's like, oh, we're earning 80%, who cares, whatever, it's not going to make that big of a difference. But I do think it starts to become really important that staking yield opportunity cost.
00:39:52.020 - 00:40:03.120, Speaker B: That's interesting. Just on that note, five years from now, will any ETH circulate in the system or will it all just be like staked ETH circulating in the system?
00:40:03.270 - 00:40:13.124, Speaker A: Well, I think there's going to be a lot of ether circulating in the system because let's just say a year from now you're going to be able to unstake ether, right? Right now it's pretty much a one way bridge where you're like, I'm staking it.
00:40:13.162 - 00:40:24.792, Speaker B: Well, in a year a lot of ETH will it'll circulate, but maybe next Bull Run, I don't know when the next Bull Run is going to be, but take me forward to three to five years. I feel like it's just going to be steep moving around.
00:40:24.926 - 00:40:30.620, Speaker A: Well, I expect that because you'll be able to unstake, you'll be more likely to stake in the first place.
00:40:30.690 - 00:40:30.972, Speaker B: Right?
00:40:31.026 - 00:41:09.560, Speaker A: So yes, a lot more ether. There's going to be less of a reason to hold ether unstaked. Like the average person who's not transacting a lot will just say like, oh, of course I'll stake all my ether. If I'm not using it in DeFi or NFTs or whatever on a daily basis, you may as well stake it. Which means that all the ether that's left over is going to be the circulating. We're going to use this for fees and costs ether but I think there'll be enough there for all the liquidity needs of all the users because you can always make more of it by unstaking. So I don't think it's going to necessarily lead to some crazy supply shock.
00:41:09.560 - 00:41:16.616, Speaker A: I do think participation rates will go up which will decrease staking yield, but that's good too.
00:41:16.798 - 00:41:48.020, Speaker B: Stannie, would you say staked ETH has had a negative, like a substantially negative impact on your guys'business? Because the only way to get like, let's call it 4% in crypto or 5% was like, I don't know, you lend on a borrow and lend platform or on a protocol and now you can just maybe drop your ETH into Lido and get four or 5%. There are a lot of positive things for Ave, obviously from staking, but what are the negative things? And I guess how negative has it been on Ave?
00:41:49.000 - 00:43:24.212, Speaker D: Well, the interesting part is that if there is staking eat demand, it tries it out of the Ave protocol, obviously, but that basically demand will be replaced with new it because that creates a market opportunity within the Aave protocol. And it's actually quite interesting because lido is tokenized liquid. So within the Ave protocol you can use it as a collateral and unlock some of the capital as well. I mean, some of the users are actually taking into lido, taking the stake ETH and using that as a collateral to borrow more ETH and leveraging their staking positions to some extent. But I think in some ways I would believe that the DeFi rates will follow a bit, the staking yields and I guess broader negative impacts. I guess the more challenging part for the whole staking at this part is that it's one way, right? So it's kind of like a bit inefficient market. So for example, things like stake eat in tokenized fashion will obviously trade in a lower value than the underlying because that's where the opportunity is.
00:43:24.212 - 00:43:49.240, Speaker D: People who don't have the time to wait until the Shanghai upgrade they might want to sell, exit their staked position. Obviously, that's something that adds risk into the equation. So you have to be mindful of all the money to value ratios when you're using something like staked as a collateral in the Web protocol.
00:43:50.000 - 00:44:40.200, Speaker B: I want to get your guys'take on real world assets, actually. Right? And just like, where on chain yield comes from, actually not maybe zooming out from where the yield comes from. I just want to get your guys'take on real world assets, right, because it was a really hotly contested topic, specifically with maker. I feel like it's been a pretty hot topic recently. I think the Maker argument would be, like, you can increase the total addressable market and just the size of the protocol and the supply of the loans if you bring on real world assets. Maybe the downside is if you're trying to create this censorship resistant protocol and now you're onboarding a bunch of capital from a bank or, like real estate or something, now you're intimately tied into the traditional off chain system. So, Rob, what are your thoughts on just real world assets as supply?
00:44:40.360 - 00:45:13.984, Speaker A: Well, first of all, I hate the phrase real world asset because it's broad and it's confusing. Ether is a real world asset, okay? Most things on a blockchain are real world assets. They exist. I think what people really mean is off chain asset. And I think when you start to describe it as off chain assets, the risks and the opportunities become more clear. And so I think there's really two things that people think about in terms of off chain assets. One is away from accessing off chain assets on chain.
00:45:13.984 - 00:46:26.104, Speaker A: Like, I want to figure out how to get treasury yields on US. Treasuries on chain somehow. The other is, how do we bring some asset or exposure to it or a contract or an agreement onto the blockchain and securitize or tokenize something entirely different. One is reaching out and one is pulling in. But in both cases, it's like, how do we interact with something off chain? There's also this third component, which is, like, Oracles and Price information where that's like, the first taste of off chain assets, because it's like, well, how do we get off chain data onto a blockchain? But all of this is just a simple way of saying the opportunity is huge, okay? But the risks are also huge. The minute you start to have things that can't be entirely contained in a smart contract and you're required to have some off chain interactions is when you start to reach outside of predictability and automation and into sort of predictability and sort of automation. And all of the things that are inefficient about traditional finance and traditional assets.
00:46:26.104 - 00:46:44.720, Speaker A: And so the market is massive when you start to bring in off chain assets. But I think you start to lose a lot of the efficiency that comes from fully on chain systems that are completely predictable, completely autonomous, completely transparent, and completely self contained.
00:46:45.620 - 00:47:01.530, Speaker B: Sonny, do you think it's worth the I'd honestly just call it like a headache, like a colossal headache to deal with off chain assets, but it obviously increases pretty drastically the size of the do you in your mind, is it worth it?
00:47:03.500 - 00:48:02.732, Speaker D: Simple things? Yeah, like any tokenizing cash balances like we have done with USDC, that has been very useful across the whole DeFi ecosystem. But when it gets a bit more complex, that's where it gets trickier. I mean, some of these projects, like Centrifuge, they have done very interesting work on tokenizing receivables and making it a bit more simpler. But also there is different kinds of off chain assets, as Robert is saying, which are very complex, like real estate. And it's like you start to have multiple layers of kind of, like, challenges, and obviously there's ways to transfer the risk away, but I kind of believe in simplicity when it comes to these real world assets and kind of like what we've seen so far.
00:48:02.866 - 00:48:37.316, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny, I remember a conversation with the head of Morgan's crypto team, like, two years ago, and she was like, we're tokenizing. I was like, JP. Morgan's crypto team is not really doing anything impactful. And they're like she's like, we're going tokenize us treasuries. I was like, Why would anyone want tokenized treasuries? Like, the yield is like 2% 3%, and here in DFI, we've got like 20%. And now here I am sitting here, October 2020, and I'm like, damn, I wish these tokenized treasuries were real. And so, like, man, maybe JPMorgan beat folks to the punch here.
00:48:37.316 - 00:48:59.790, Speaker B: That'll be interesting to see. Rob, I like the way you laid it out, though. It's like you've got things that produce yield already. It's like tokenizing treasuries, and then you've got things that you're having to basically pull into DeFi that it's not as simple. So I think that's a good way to look at it. Dan, anything else on real world assets? Anything that you're curious about?
00:49:00.880 - 00:49:31.530, Speaker C: I think we kind of hit it. All right. Yeah, I just think the Oracle problem really becomes kind of pushed further into the forefront. I mean, chainlink is our best option right now, but they still have some multi SIG impact there. We don't know all the signers, and there is still some questions around the security there. So I think it's really just about expanding, kind of like how we bring off chain data on chain and really starting from the ground up, I think is very important there.
00:49:31.980 - 00:49:57.712, Speaker B: Yeah. Stannie and Rob, I don't know who wants to take this, but are you worried about kind of the maker concern of censorship? Like building an entirely censorship resistant protocol, like 100% censorship resistant. If you want to do that, you would not onboard real world assets, but you also kind of drastically limit the supply. So, Rob, I'm curious how you think about that.
00:49:57.846 - 00:50:03.052, Speaker A: Well, in order to do that, you'd have to not have any off chain asset like USDC.
00:50:03.116 - 00:50:03.740, Speaker B: USDC?
00:50:03.820 - 00:50:50.690, Speaker A: Yeah, as an off chain asset. WBTC is an off chain asset. Fundamentally, you wouldn't allow any asset that had an off chain component to it, which really starts to limit the scope. I mean, I think almost every DeFi protocol supports USDC and supports WBTC and is already past the point of actual censorship resistance. Fundamentally, there's some protocols that are taking a back to basics approach and only supporting things that are fully on chain, and that's really cool. But I think right now, fundamentally, almost every DeFi application, if you had a coordinated nation level attack, could obviously censor or destroy a DeFi protocol point blank. That's true.
00:50:50.690 - 00:52:08.030, Speaker A: So then the question is, what standards are you looking for? Right? If you know that USDC blacklisting the address will destroy pretty much any protocol, like Makerdow, compound, Aave, uniswap, whatever, that would be an existential issue, and it would harm users tremendously. If that's already a risk and the application already supports, like, where do you draw the line? Is it like, well, I know that we're taking USDC risk, but we're also taking risk of some bank refusing to pay us back? At Makerdal, there's some series of lines you draw in real world assets, and maybe you're completely cool with the USDC alone risk, but you're not cool with any random court can have a finding and someone doesn't have to pay things back to a DeFi protocol. Instead of it being like, one potential actor, it's like, well, now there's like, any court can screw it over, so there's a lot of different places you can draw the line. And it'll be really interesting to see how all of this evolves. I think MakerDAO probably feels the biggest need and the pain point right now, because in a lot of ways, they're the most at risk of a government saying, like, no, we don't like that. You made your own money. No thanks.
00:52:08.030 - 00:52:44.288, Speaker A: Because it's big and they've had a lot of success, and it's a huge, non fully, one to one, reserve backed stablecoin. And right now, governments hate non, fully reserved, one to one back stablecoins all of a sudden after UST imploded. So I think Makerdow might want to draw the line sooner than other DeFi protocols that can take more censorship risk. Like, if there's anyone out there that can't bear as much censorship risk because they're at higher risk of censorship, it's probably something like Makerdow that needs to be more conservative about those risks.
00:52:44.384 - 00:52:59.804, Speaker B: Stani I'm just really curious to see there's all these regulatory things going on, and then you guys decide to launch a stablecoin. Obviously, probably big risks, but also colossal rewards. So what was the business decision behind this? And why did you guys do this?
00:52:59.922 - 00:54:07.200, Speaker D: I mean, if you look kind of like the Avi protocol, effectively it's a market of different stablecoins. There so many of these stablecoins, they have a different kind of narrative or I would say even set up. So we have USDC, that's basically the organized balances from Circle. There's also makerdos dai. So having a stablecoin within the Ave ecosystem really helps in certain cases with the liquidity crunches and diversifies those stablecoin pools as well. But also it gives a bit more kind of like ability for the Ave community to effectively govern their own stablecoin. And I think it's not like the Go stablecoin is replacing the other ones that are in the market.
00:54:07.200 - 00:55:48.690, Speaker D: It's effectively something that is more of a supplement into the whole stablecoin ecosystem. But the vision is quite more, I would say bigger in the sense that we believe that especially with the layer, twos stablecoins can become very valuable tool for not just internet payments, but solving real world problems across the world. During last month, for example, I was in Argentina and something very fascinating, I realized that how much stablecoins are actually used to escape the inflation that the locals have with their own currency, which is roughly 100%. So whatever you're earning today, one year later, you have half of the value in your hands. And most of these stablecoin transactions aren't actually done in decentralized finance, they're actually done in a centralized exchange on a tron blockchain from one binance account to another. So basically it just showcases kind of like how people are relying on the centralized systems in some of the regions. So I think there's sort of impact that you can do on the stablecoin aspect, but also that there's definitely diversity that is beneficial for the Aave community as well, end of the day, but it's something that's kind of like additive than actually replacing anything.
00:55:50.340 - 00:56:54.096, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think that's really interesting. I definitely agree that stablecoins are probably one of the biggest use cases for crypto and we kind of see that coming through. And as a lending protocol, you definitely sit in this unique situation where building in a stablecoin around your protocol or into your protocol makes a lot of sense, right, because in the current state, without a stablecoin, you need lenders to then use their assets to provide to the borrower. But with your own stablecoin, you obviously have the unique ability to say, okay, once we have borrowed demand, we can mint our own stablecoin to act as the asset being lent. And that definitely creates an interesting ability for the protocol to generate more revenue for itself as well, just to continue to grow and scale. And we've seen other protocols do this, right? Like of course MakerDAO has Dai that they use. We've seen FRAX launch FRAX lend to complement their know sam Kay sam Kasman, the founder of FRAX, has kind of called this the trinity, right? Like they leverage their liquidity through the curve protocol.
00:56:54.096 - 00:57:10.700, Speaker C: They now have Fraxlend, their own lending protocol and of course their own stablecoin. And so we kind of see Aave moving in this direction. Do you think that there's value to kind of having these three cornerstones or pillars of DeFi with liquidity lending and a stablecoin?
00:57:11.520 - 00:58:55.500, Speaker D: I think the bigger value is overall in the DeFi ecosystem where you can actually go from one protocol to another, from one community to another, and actually see transparently how these different communities are assessing risk, for example, and then adjusting those risk parameters within the communities. And I think the value of decentralization is that we don't have one single place where people come and actually decide upon something like a policy or interest rate for a stable coin, but you actually have multiple different variations for that. And if you look at the technical, the implementation is and the idea of the go stablecoin is that when you supply your assets into the other protocol, you are earning on your collateral. So it's kind of like a different type of a model that we currently see. But for me mainly it's about having those different decentralized communities and their own risk assessments and then that we don't have kind of like a one. I will not see DeFi being successful. If there's one stable coin rules everything, and there's one place where you actually have to go and give your ideas and vote upon, let's say, interest rates or some other strategies I would see more is that there's multiple different kinds of communities that have their own ways to manage risk and govern their protocol and then they can learn from each other.
00:58:55.500 - 00:59:02.428, Speaker D: And that creates a lot of interesting learnings. I think that will be the path to go.
00:59:02.594 - 00:59:25.780, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. Kind of like fragmenting or sharding the risk of running a stablecoin across many stablecoins rather than kind of compounding that into one. Rob with the launch of Compound Three, it looks like USDC is really the base asset in that ecosystem. So does launching a stablecoin kind of make sense for compound? Or are you going to stay in a different direction and kind of using USDC as that base currency?
00:59:26.360 - 01:00:11.620, Speaker A: Yeah. So compound three is meant to be this really simple borrowing protocol building block that can be deployed on as many EVM chains as folks want. Once it gets deployed on many EVM chains, then you can do some really cool magical things with like bridging assets between chains, bridging positions between chains, all this really cool stuff. But it sort of reduces the need to create a stable coin fundamentally. So I'm actually really excited to see how and where compound three evolves to there's a lot of different things it can become, but I don't necessarily think that a native stablecoin is one of them. It's possible. Community developers say, actually, it's really cool, let's add it, and I'll be surprised.
01:00:11.620 - 01:00:26.600, Speaker A: But as like, the default case, I don't think there's going to be a stable coin. I think it's just, like, slightly unnecessary and fragments the ecosystem a little bit more than it has to USDC. It has its risks, but it's also super efficient.
01:00:27.740 - 01:01:05.600, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. And that's probably a great segue to kind of get into scaling in the cross chain world. I'm kind of curious to hear your take on the experience you had with building compound gateway kind of building in the polkadot experience. I remember when dYdX I think it was when they pivoted over to the cosmos ecosystem. You tweeted out something like, relatively bullish on how cosmos is interesting tech, and I just kind of, like, love to hear your take on your findings from building in polkadot, as well as kind of how you think the growth in the cosmos ecosystem will kind of play a role. And is compound interested in kind of pursuing something over in that ecosystem?
01:01:05.760 - 01:01:45.270, Speaker A: Yeah. So to quickly rewind and summarize, compound gateway was meant to be basically an app chain that would run compound like a compound like market with assets from every single blockchain. And the way it was going to do this was by launching an app chain or L one, and then having bridges to all these other base chains. And this was like a way to say, like, okay, there's one cohesive market where you can share liquidity with assets from every chain. Really cool idea. I mean, honestly, if it works, it's incredible. But as of 2021, the technical challenges of building this were really high.
01:01:45.270 - 01:02:23.996, Speaker A: A great example is we've seen almost every bridge get hacked over the last year and a half. Bridges are extremely dangerous and complicated to build safely. It can be done. There's lots of things being built correctly and safely, but to have as a strategy, okay, we're going to have one chain. And with custom bridges to everywhere else, it was too much of a technical risk to launch in a lot of ways. And I think that over time, that decision has been vindicated. Just seeing how difficult it is to run bridges safely, that strategy doesn't really work for an app chain that doesn't need to connect to other blockchains.
01:02:23.996 - 01:03:14.272, Speaker A: I actually think it works great. I think like a dYdX, where all they have to do is let you get USDCoin in there and then trade galore and they don't have to bridge to every other blockchain. That's a really good approach for an app chain if it can be so self contained. So I think it'll be much more successful than the strategy that we originally were researching. And when it comes to platform, I do think that there's a reason why you're starting to see so many different new chains launch on Cosmos versus other platforms. Most of the new app chains or we're going to launch on L one are doing it in the Cosmos ecosystem. I think the user experience in Cosmos is still really rough in terms of how wallets work and how connecting to different chains works and how Bridging assets works.
01:03:14.272 - 01:03:27.648, Speaker A: And all this stuff is really crude. But for launching and going live with your own chain, I think it's the best technology that I've seen so far versus other platforms.
01:03:27.824 - 01:04:18.100, Speaker D: Yeah, I want to agree with Robert on the Bridging part. It's super difficult to build secure bridges, and we've seen recently, even one of the best builders in the space have tried to do that. So it's got quite difficult. And I believe in app chains to the extent that you could actually then inherit the security, for example, from Ethereum and kind of have this rollout function. So that's something that could be very valuable in creating kind of like micro ecosystems for these communities that are effectively going to that path. So I think that's an interesting path to take, and especially less riskier than kind of like, having the Bridging activity.
01:04:20.600 - 01:05:02.124, Speaker B: Guys, I want to start to wrap this up with just thinking about the next cycle. Rob, I have such good memories of DeFi summer. And just remember, I will give you credit here's my memory of DFI summer COVID march of 2020. Fed kicks into action. Does a bunch of money printing people freak out about inflation? Bitcoin narrative comes into play with like, Bitcoin is now this inflation hedge. Paul Tudor Jones calls Bitcoin the fastest horse in the race, like, May 2020. And then you guys did your liquidity farming, yield farming, liquidity farming.
01:05:02.124 - 01:05:25.608, Speaker B: And that just man. And then WiFi a lot of things named after foods, a lot of yams and the uniswap AirDrop and boom. Like, off to the races. Like, honestly, probably best summer I've ever had. Just a lot of fun and no sleep. And I'm just curious if you think that we will get something that crazy again in DeFi. And if so, what kicks it off?
01:05:25.774 - 01:06:03.296, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. And when I look back on that time and what I thought made it crazy and cool was you had a protocol that was working. You had a governance system already built. And when the token was launched, right, you had this basic process of essentially saying, we're going to give away something that is already live, it already works, there's already governance, everything is ready. At the time the token was released, and that was like a new model. And it was designed to be the exact opposite of the ICO model, where it was like, there's a token and nothing else. It was designed to be the exact opposite.
01:06:03.296 - 01:06:26.472, Speaker A: It's like, there's a token and if it ends here, you literally have a whole thing to run. Have fun. I can quit and go on vacation and everything works still. So enjoy it. And that's what was so new about it. And I think what set off a lot of other things of like, hey, we can go about creating and releasing tokens differently. They don't have to be vaporware.
01:06:26.472 - 01:07:18.344, Speaker A: And maybe one day there's something tokens can actually do things for real. And so that's what I think set off this amazing moment of experimentation that summer. A lot of the tokens that were launched, you could do cool things with, unlike back in the day, what comes next to give us that level of excitement? I mean, there's a lot of things that could do it, right? So, one, I think actual gaming that's fun and can attract a huge audience has the potential to totally shake up how we experience crypto. I think no knock against any project or any team. Most of the games in existence today that are like Web Three plus gaming are really not fun at all. Most of the play to earn stuff is not fun at all. It's like, fun to make money, but the games are all horrible.
01:07:18.344 - 01:08:18.512, Speaker A: I think gaming is like this huge untapped opportunity that can possibly get 100 million people into crypto for real. You add 100 million people and suddenly it's like crazy town again, right? So I think gaming is the first one that is ripe. The second thing that I think is ripe for a D Five reinvention is the introduction of zero knowledge technologies into L Ones, into D Five applications, into all of these things. And this is to unlock actual institutional on chain usage. When I talk to banks and hedge funds, they're like, why would I want everyone to know my position at all times? That's such a disadvantage. Why would I want to use uniswap and get front run or have some mev extract most of my money? DeFi doesn't actually work for real Wall Street. It's like a lot of the sentiment of Wall Street, but zero knowledge proofs and technology has the potential to change this.
01:08:18.512 - 01:09:25.300, Speaker A: So this could be like, yeah, of course I can trade on this on chain dex and there's deep liquidity and it works like uniswap V Three, but no one can front run me and I can't have an mev rip out my value and it just works and like, oh my goodness, this is cool. I think it has the potential to actually bring in the wave of institutions. Everyone says it's coming, but hasn't really come for DeFi yet because you can build new things that are Wall Street grade. That really there's not much Wall Street grade today. So I think ZK technology is the second crazy catalyst for a whole new class of users that makes this crazy again. And lastly, I think the third thing that can set this off is just global macroeconomics, right? If we enter an era where people are like, okay, we can't trust existing assets for whatever reason, whether it's like, central banks or Pandemics or whatever. If people can't trust the existing asset classes, that's when they're excited and willing to explore.
01:09:25.300 - 01:09:43.740, Speaker A: And that's when you have the market conditions for people to experiment and with new assets and new models and new projects and new base level financial primitives. And that'll be a right market condition. So any of those three things, I think, can get us into a wild era.
01:09:45.680 - 01:10:13.936, Speaker B: I love that on number one, gaming, I completely agree. Santiago has been hammering that home to me, and just like, you need to get more excited about gaming. So I agree with you, and I know Santiago would agree, too. On the macro, I think you're spot on on zero knowledge. I have a question there. Will this get built on something like a Starkware or is it like at what like, will this be like ZKS at the who's building this? Joe Carlson. Espresso Systems.
01:10:13.936 - 01:10:19.976, Speaker B: Like ZKS at the layer one, or all built on a ZK layer two? What does this actually look like?
01:10:20.078 - 01:10:22.616, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm Midwit, so I don't have this.
01:10:22.638 - 01:10:25.352, Speaker B: Sort of like, you and me both, my friend. You and me both, my friend.
01:10:25.486 - 01:11:07.364, Speaker A: But I think there are L One chains that are designed to be privacy first, and it's possible they catch on. It's possible that systems on top of Ethereum catch on. It's possible that applications themselves are able to embed zero knowledge into the application layer. Like, you can imagine a compound or a uniswap that just works for you, but no one really knows who's using it, just that it has the correct collateral or it has the right liquidity. There's a lot of ways this could unfold, and I don't know, I think something's going to work and it's going to happen, and surprise, like, it's so hard to predict ahead of time which thing is going to be the thing that's the catalyst, but something's going to work.
01:11:07.482 - 01:11:35.488, Speaker B: Yeah. Rob, you're on the right show, by the way. The show is literally called Bell Curve, so you've come to the right place. Stani, I want to ask someone who is on the right side of the Bell Curve here in terms of just like, what you see. I'm going to ask you the same question I asked Rob, which is like DeFi summer Craziness. Do we see something similar? And if so, what kicks it off? And I don't know if you would agree with Rob's three predictions or agree, but maybe add one or two or take things. Just what do you think about that?
01:11:35.574 - 01:12:40.868, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say Rob's predictions are those that are very kind of ripe at the moment. So there's a sort of value in what you could do actually with gaming and also especially with Cks and what kind of benefits it provides. And for me, I'm kind of thinking I will see a lot of value and traction that DeFi can actually bring still. And there is innovation what you can build. But I think I see Web Three as a broader economy as well and that we built this amazing DeFi infrastructure within the larger economy. And where I'm focusing personally quite a lot is building more of that non financial path into using blockchain. And what I'm thinking is that social media is one of the places where you have a lot of potential, because currently we interact with each other.
01:12:40.868 - 01:13:55.564, Speaker D: We're using very big platforms, but we don't have the ability to, for example, port your audience. Whatever you create in crypto, Twitter into somewhere else. Or if you're a creator and you have an audience in TikTok, you can't really port it into a new application that might come. So I think that being able to own your social presence and at the same time having the ability to connect with your peers directly and publish and broadcast content is very valuable also for the direct monetization perspective. But it also does what DeFi did. So you change the dynamics that you have with, let's say what you have with finance. You could do the same with social because when the users are owning their own self expression and their social media profiles and their connections, it's the applications and algorithms that have to actually fight and serve the users and the users have the flexibility to make the choice without leaving their followers and their whole social capital behind.
01:13:55.564 - 01:14:53.676, Speaker D: And then that on chain verified social capital can be used in different use cases as well. For example in gaming, and I think gaming itself becomes more social and those users then that come to this non financial utility pathway into blockchain, they will start using DeFi, some of them one way or another. So I'm kind of like a bigger believer in this space. And also I think a lot of things have to be done in terms of the user experience that you shouldn't sign transactions, pay gas and you should be able to onboard relatively quickly. And I think we have to just change a lot of concepts. For example, we can't think about wallets in a way that we store all our position in addresses, but we actually have to divide the idea of wallets, that you might have a wallet for low transaction value and you have something, but you're using DeFi. And these two are completely separate categories.
01:14:53.676 - 01:15:02.370, Speaker D: And that way we create more adoption into the space as well. So that's where basically I'm very passionate about at the moment.
01:15:02.980 - 01:15:10.070, Speaker A: I just want to agree with Stani. I think that is an excellent thing that could be a massive catalyst for the entire space.
01:15:11.080 - 01:15:56.052, Speaker C: Yeah would also have to agree. Like just when I think about onboarding my mom or something into crypto, right? Getting her to use logistics of a MetaMask and managing her own money. Where one fat finger and you permanently lost half your net worth from sending it to the wrong address. That's just not where adoption to the masses needs to go. Right? People come to crypto because the ideas of decentralization and monetization people love the concepts there and it's just like, okay, that's fine for this certain subset of people and we all kind of know this is the wild west and we can play by these rules. But with the last bull market and the terror blow up, real people do get hurt when these things happen. So yeah, I just think we need to figure out a way to make crypto just more accessible in general.
01:15:56.052 - 01:16:15.130, Speaker C: So love the concept around that, love that. And just one quick question to follow up on the digital identity social capital concept. Do you think that that's just kind of a bigger unlock for DeFi itself or do you kind of think of that as a whole new market, like a comparable subsector to DeFi as a whole?
01:16:18.480 - 01:17:30.940, Speaker D: I see identity more of a spectrum. That's what Lens is trying to do from the profile perspective is just to kind of tie your social presence into kind of like a one bucket which becomes a bit of identity. But I think everything you do on chain as a spectrum is identity and also off chain and you might have different things that also are data points of identity. It might be your passport, your routines and your habits, the way you communicate and the protocols you use on chain. So I think there's a lot of footprint that we're living out and I've seen some stuff where you are using that footprint in DeFi. And Vegan score is one funny example where you can gate the experience based on your Vegan score. So for example, if you're too new in the space, maybe you shouldn't be able to access some of the more kind of riskier stuff that is in DeFi but also like finding the products that you might be interested in or the governance proposals that you can contribute.
01:17:30.940 - 01:17:39.270, Speaker D: So I think there's definitely value in fighting your appetite. Maybe that's the place to find things.
01:17:39.880 - 01:17:58.968, Speaker B: Guys, last question here and then I promise we'll wrap it up is just in terms of we had Ben Foreman from ParaFi on the last episode and he's just really excited about permission DeFi and in his take, permission DeFi will be orders of magnitude larger than permissionless DeFi. I'm just curious if you guys agree with that thesis or not.
01:17:59.054 - 01:18:55.660, Speaker A: I disagree with the thesis. I think the magic of permissionless is that the entire world can use it, the entire world can build it, the entire world can grow on it. You can have a DeFi protocol with interfaces and businesses built on top of it from around the world. It's so much bigger potentially than having to essentially limit the audience or manually approve things or whitelist things. I just think the scope of how big something it can get is so much bigger when it's permissionless and the interfaces on top of it can be permissioned. I think the market structure that evolves over time is one which there's open permissionless DeFi protocols and the institutions that provide access to customers, whether they're a bank or a brokerage or an application, are the ones that are validating permissions generally. And I think that's like the end state for a lot of this to happen.
01:18:55.660 - 01:19:14.960, Speaker A: I think if Bitcoin were permissioned it would be worth zero point. I think nobody would use it. I think permissioned creates like a claustrophobic system that can't grow like you're stimulating the growth of it. And so I vehemently disagree with Ben on this. I take the opposite.
01:19:17.940 - 01:19:34.180, Speaker B: Like if you take us to that end state, will the front ends of this system, will folks go to Compound and go to Ave in ten years or will they go to the 600 different front ends that just the world has built on top of compound?
01:19:34.340 - 01:19:44.430, Speaker A: Well, the front end in ten years to this stuff, it's like people are going to use Compound and Ave through their JPMorgan account that they don't even know it's like running on DeFi or not.
01:19:46.480 - 01:19:57.600, Speaker B: We were talking about this today. It might not even be financial apps. Like you could go to Zillow and Zillow is plugged in directly to compound inave and you get your mortgage directly on Zillow instead of having to go to the bank.
01:20:01.300 - 01:20:40.712, Speaker A: And you could imagine that when a consumer trades on, like sometimes it comes from their order book and sometimes it comes from uniswap, like whatever gets the better price and the user doesn't even know they're using a DeFi protocol. I think over time more and more stuff is going to run on these systems without people even noticing or caring or having to know the difference. Just like I don't care that I can spit up my own email server. I just know that Gmail is a good way to do email and so I use it because it's easy. Eventually you're going to have easy ways to do finance. And it just so happens that the infrastructure deep down below is DeFi.
01:20:40.856 - 01:20:54.068, Speaker B: Do you guys want to own those front ends as the end of the day, like business builders and entrepreneurs, do you want to own those front ends or you're like, I'm just going to make my protocol as amazing as humanly possible and let the world build on top of them?
01:20:54.234 - 01:21:58.692, Speaker D: Well, I can just say that a lot of the traction comes from different wallets and different integrations. I think the beauty of the decentralization is that you have multiple sources actually using these protocols and that makes the idea of decentralization nothing really stops to run a front end that maybe has a different kinds of experience or value added services. And I think that's how Webtreetech is working. So you have the Ethereum network and you can run with open source software. You can run a get node, but a lot of people use services like Alchemy or Infuria, and also you have businesses built on top of the open permissionless infrastructure. So I think kind of like, there can be value being built, and I don't see why not, as long as the access is decentralized and permissionless awesome.
01:21:58.746 - 01:22:07.900, Speaker B: Guys, I think this is a good place to wrap. Appreciate you guys giving us so much time. I think this was an amazing end to the season. And, yeah, we're all wishing you guys both best of luck.
01:22:08.320 - 01:22:09.436, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody.
01:22:09.618 - 01:22:10.910, Speaker D: Cheers. Thank you, guys.
01:22:12.160 - 01:22:17.150, Speaker B: All right, everyone, other side of the episode. Man, that episode did not disappoint. Dan, what'd you think?
01:22:17.600 - 01:23:06.376, Speaker C: It was killer. I've really liked kind of how we got into some of the deeper, more ideological discussions, especially around is permission DeFi the answer? And I liked Lescher's take on kind of like no. One of the core tenets of DeFi, and I think actually, Vance hit this in the very first episode of the season, was when you're building in DeFi, one of the biggest draws is the global wallet distribution. You're building products for the entire globe that's your customer base, and that's something we haven't really seen before. And Rob kind of went into detail about how that's just a bigger value prop than building for institutions. Like, yes, institutions have the money on a relative basis, but the global wallet distribution could be a pretty big catalyst for kind of just broader market adoption, honestly.
01:23:06.568 - 01:23:35.732, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it just shows the difference between building in web two versus web three. Like, this relentless focus on the protocol and then just letting the market run wild and build whatever they want to build on top. So Rob's kind of like I mean, reading between the lines, he's kind of like, I don't give a crap if it's permissioned or permissionless or, like, what gets built on top. He's like, I'm just hyper focused on building the most performant, best lend and borrow protocol, and anyone can build whatever they want on top of it.
01:23:35.786 - 01:24:08.016, Speaker C: I just thought he also had one more interesting comment around, obviously building in DFI, you're building these autonomous protocols that run just strictly on code with very limited to no human interaction. But sometimes you forget that even as someone who spends all day every day reading about protocols, analyzing these things, you forget that. And he's like, I just want to build this product that I can just step away from and go on vacation. Just really puts that into tone. Like, they are building these multigenerational protocols. They're just self sufficient. Again, sometimes you just kind of, like, forget that.
01:24:08.016 - 01:24:09.120, Speaker C: It's good to hear it.
01:24:09.270 - 01:24:45.896, Speaker B: Yeah, it really is. I mean, just like, the scale if this stuff is successful, the scale of it is pretty mind. I mean, it's interesting, like, talking to investors versus talking to builders, right. The amount of knowledge that Stani and Rob have to know about what else is going on in DFI is really interesting to try to wrap your head around. Right. It's like the amount that they need to know about building in cross chain worlds, scaling other L ones, like their competitors, just honestly, how debt markets work, how lending and borrowing works, like credit versus collateral. It's just impressive.
01:24:45.896 - 01:24:47.688, Speaker B: I think these two guys are really impressive.
01:24:47.864 - 01:25:29.052, Speaker C: Yeah. And it was also great to hear stani's focus on wanting to build ease of access into you know, I gave the example about my mom using crypto, and that seemed to be almost a priority to him. And how do you onboard the new class of users? And I think that's a really difficult question because a lot of the core tenets of crypto in general is, like, immutability and finality. And yes, those are great things to this current subset of users, but it's like, how do you enable that to actually be adopted by the broader masses where people make mistakes that's just like, you have to build a product that is able to withstand those kinds of things. And that's just, like, a super tough question to answer right now.
01:25:29.186 - 01:26:19.332, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard you talking about this on the last episode of Empire about reversible transactions, which I think is an interesting topic, though I'm a little skeptical of it, but I don't know, I actually might push back on the your mom thing on the ease of onboarding. It's like, I don't think people onboard into anything because it's easy to use. And I think people onboard into a new technology because they have to use it because they're literally forced to use it. Right. Like, let's take credit cards, for example. As credit cards were starting to go mainstream, there were a lot of people who fought using credit cards and they wanted to keep using cash. It wasn't until stores literally said, you can't use cash here that credit cards became ubiquitous.
01:26:19.332 - 01:26:46.710, Speaker B: Right. And I guess maybe even before that, when stores were just like, yeah, I'll take your cash, but it's so much easier. Can't you just swipe your credit card? When it just became, like, a normalized thing? And I think that has less to do with ease of use and more to do with just how much is this stuff apparent in your day to day life, which crypto right now is not in? You can live a full life and not interact with crypto. Right?
01:26:47.720 - 01:27:15.244, Speaker C: Yeah. Maybe it's less about onboarding and then more of user retention. Right. If my first time ever using crypto and I type in someone's address manually because I haven't figured out there's a QR code thing or whatever, and I miss one letter, right? Then I just blasted $1,000 into nothingness, then that would be like a scarring moment. Be like, okay, this isn't for me, and never come back. So, I don't know, maybe it's less about onboarding and it's more about UX in general.
01:27:15.442 - 01:28:12.440, Speaker B: Yeah, it was interesting how much the conversation kept getting pulled back to just, like, Treasury Management. And I actually found that part of the conversation so interesting, which I'm super excited about because that is the theme of next season, right. Talking about Dow Treasury Management and scaling Dows, operating Dows, lessons from Dows, managing Dows success stories like how Dows can operate and scale better. And that's actually the theme of Season Two, which Mike and I'll get into soon. But I think I learned a lot just hearing how Stannie and Rob but really Stannie in some of his thoughts on it, like how he thinks about running a treasury. It's super interesting, especially that part about outsourcing Treasury Management. Not because I'm glad they agreed with my thesis, they're like, not because you can't do it internally, but because the community almost won't let you do it successfully internally.
01:28:12.600 - 01:28:25.348, Speaker C: Right. Yeah. You just get people, like, yelling, oh, you're diluting us if you're just trying to diversify Treasury's holdings. And I think Stannie called that like, taking the emotion out of it. It's a great way to phrase it. And, yeah, I really agree with that.
01:28:25.514 - 01:28:28.390, Speaker B: Yeah. Anything else? Any other big takeaways from the App.
01:28:29.320 - 01:29:05.072, Speaker C: Getting into the stablecoin conversation? I thought it was pretty interesting how Rob was. I know that makes sense in some situations, but for us, we're just not focused on that. And I also really liked hearing his takeaway from the attempt to go multi chain and the world just kind of wasn't ready for it. Maybe not the world, like the tech stack. I thought that was really interesting. And you kind of think like, okay, is that because that was kind of like try to run through polkadot and building on substrate and there's a smaller development community there. Does that have anything to do with it? But inherently, yes.
01:29:05.072 - 01:29:30.664, Speaker C: Bridges are risky. Anybody in crypto knows that. The experience is brutal. You bridge away and you just wait for your assets to come. You're like, oh, what's going on here? It's just not a comfortable experience. But, yeah, I don't know. I'm excited to see if that really plays out or if the App chain thesis really does take off and we see the Cosmos space just really start to grow in the next Bull Run.
01:29:30.862 - 01:30:06.408, Speaker B: There are these small decisions in Crypto that you think it's funny to think about. Like, if they went the other way, how different would the space look? Right? Like, if Compound had chose Cosmos instead of polkadot and had a better experience and had built their own app chain, how much more the appchain thesis would have taken off? It's just interesting to think about those little decisions that maybe went this way instead of that way. And I think the last thing that I found really interesting was Rob's description. Really simple framing of, like, real World. I said real world assets. And he said, I wouldn't think of them. I wouldn't call them real world assets.
01:30:06.408 - 01:30:37.164, Speaker B: ETH is a real world asset. I'd call them on chain assets and off chain assets and basically he bucketed them into two different big buckets. One is like assets that kind of already produce yield and you just need to tokenize it like a treasury versus assets that you almost have to pull into crypto capital markets. Tokenize them, pull them into crypto capital markets, use them as supply in a lending platform and then that's how they generate the yield. So I just love that framing. I thought it was a really nice way to think about it.
01:30:37.282 - 01:31:07.136, Speaker C: Totally agree. What do you think that I just try to think, okay, what's going to bring this next wave of borrowers in? And it's like, okay, let's say the local coffee shop down the street wants to start open a second store. They need a million dollars to do it needs to happen for the owner of that store to be like, I'm going to go get this loan from compound. Maybe they have the assets in the bank. They can do it in an over collateralized way, but they want to be more capital efficient and just deposit that as collateral, take up the loan. What's going to bring that borrower into DeFi?
01:31:07.248 - 01:31:24.632, Speaker B: I think there's only one thing that brings anyone into crypto. Well, there's probably two things. One is money and the second thing is just a better product. You first. I don't know if you remember your first time ever trading on Uniswap. It was mind blowing for me. I connected MetaMask and traded.
01:31:24.632 - 01:32:00.788, Speaker B: I was like, wait, that was it. I didn't KYC, I didn't AML, I didn't create an account. I didn't have to wire funds from my bank account. I was like, this is mind blowing. And I think people are going to have that experience once mortgages, like something related to mortgages. Because I don't know if you own a home down there in Atlanta, but I got my first house during COVID and I got my first mortgage and it took three freaking months to get this thing. Because I'm a business owner and if you're getting a mortgage, they hate business owners and they hate entrepreneurs.
01:32:00.788 - 01:32:27.020, Speaker B: I'll just tell you that. And they definitely hate crypto, which most of my assets are in crypto. I'm as risky as you can get. Like, I own a business and most of my net worth is in crypto. So it was so freaking hard to get this mortgage. And I think there are a lot of people who don't fit into the mold of what a bank wants when they get a mortgage and that is going to like, that's just a better product, getting a mortgage on chain and it doesn't exist yet, but it will exist.
01:32:27.600 - 01:32:29.996, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree. I love that answer.
01:32:30.178 - 01:32:39.650, Speaker B: Yeah. So anyways, man, thanks for joining me. See you guys next week for the final episode. Of bell curve with Mike. We're going to recap the season and give you guys the details on season two.
