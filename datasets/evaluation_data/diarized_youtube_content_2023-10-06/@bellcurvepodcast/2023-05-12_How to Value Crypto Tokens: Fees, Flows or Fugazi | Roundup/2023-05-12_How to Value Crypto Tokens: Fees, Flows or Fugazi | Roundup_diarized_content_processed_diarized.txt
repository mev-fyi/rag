Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. Welcome back to another roundup.
00:00:28.594 - 00:00:32.280, Speaker A: You got Michael. Michael and Vance. What's going on, guys?
00:00:33.770 - 00:00:34.950, Speaker B: Glad to be here.
00:00:35.100 - 00:00:36.262, Speaker C: Michael's one and two.
00:00:36.316 - 00:00:41.526, Speaker A: Michael's one and two. Well, I wasn't sure if you're going by Mike these days. I didn't know if you ended up making a decision. I know you've been, like, debating.
00:00:41.558 - 00:00:47.340, Speaker C: Michael's kind of convinced me I'm in a transition phase. Yeah.
00:00:47.870 - 00:00:57.230, Speaker A: Vance and Michael, I feel like we're supposed to give a disclosure now that you guys are now investors in Blockworks. How does it feel to be not just co hosts but co owners of the Bell Curve podcast?
00:01:00.850 - 00:01:18.580, Speaker D: Check the contract. I don't know if we're actually co owners. Good to be investors. And yeah, I mean, you guys are growing super quickly. You've got a good team, so it feels good. We've looked at a lot of different startups and you guys are definitely growing quickly and it's impressive. So hats on.
00:01:19.130 - 00:01:21.000, Speaker B: Really excited to be a part of it.
00:01:22.170 - 00:01:22.626, Speaker C: How's.
00:01:22.658 - 00:01:24.040, Speaker A: So professional of you.
00:01:24.810 - 00:01:27.640, Speaker D: Maybe a little bit more gusto next time.
00:01:28.250 - 00:01:28.518, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:28.524 - 00:01:30.390, Speaker C: I really believed you there, Michael.
00:01:31.550 - 00:01:34.860, Speaker A: Really fired up to be along for the ride. Yes.
00:01:35.390 - 00:01:35.898, Speaker D: No.
00:01:35.984 - 00:01:38.170, Speaker C: Once you made the sale, stop selling.
00:01:40.610 - 00:01:43.120, Speaker D: How does it feel to have us as investors now?
00:01:45.090 - 00:01:46.606, Speaker C: We're really excited to have you.
00:01:46.628 - 00:02:03.570, Speaker A: About that. Wasn't we're psyched? Yeah, we're pumped. I did a lot of that. What are you paying attention to this week outside of our big announcement?
00:02:04.070 - 00:02:06.526, Speaker C: What's interesting, there's a lot of funny.
00:02:06.558 - 00:02:13.030, Speaker D: Stuff that happened this week. The one that I don't think is on our prep doc was Aragon.
00:02:14.330 - 00:02:22.940, Speaker A: We were debating whether or not to get into that, but I saw you ripping some fun tweets about it. So why don't you can you maybe give us a lay of the land on what's happening in Aragon land?
00:02:23.710 - 00:02:24.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:24.112 - 00:02:31.894, Speaker D: So Aragon is a project that has developed various different software products, aragon Court.
00:02:31.942 - 00:02:32.970, Speaker A: Being one of them.
00:02:33.120 - 00:03:16.854, Speaker D: It's funny because it's supposed to be a court for Dow governance, which is obviously sorely needed in the wake of this kind of blowing up. But they built a bunch of different things. They raised a bunch of ETH in an ICO in 2017, I guess it was. And they've kind of been this beleaguered project that just spends money on kind of this, that and the other thing, like crazy off sites, stuff like that. Basically, there's a lot of allegations of, like, you should just return this money to the community. And a few funds decided to try that tact over the past quarter. And so these funds bought a bunch of Aragon or accumulated a bunch of Aragon and they pushed to a vote with the know return the capital immediately.
00:03:16.854 - 00:04:02.666, Speaker D: Let's kind of write the ship and go on our separate ways. And I think they did vote and successfully passed this measure to return all the capital. And then right as it was about to happen, Aragon Foundation rugged the Aragon Dow took all of the money and called the process of voting a majority of votes and passing something a 51% attack on democracy. Just absolutely hilarious that they would call it that. Also there is no 51% attack in something that isn't a base layer. It's just called voting. And I think a bunch of the funds that tried this got worked because Aragon is now worth basically zero if the treasury is also worth zero.
00:04:02.666 - 00:04:40.150, Speaker D: And Aragon Foundation also just looks terrible for rugging all of these people. It's not really their money anyways. It's supposed to be a Dow until they didn't want it to be. And yeah, just like the levels of Cope and Saltiness on the timeline this week were unbelievable. It really felt like people probably maybe bought a little bit too much ant and it just didn't work. And it's just a friendly reminder that this is not radbuy. And also don't try to real fair value raid treasury that can unilaterally move the funds on you.
00:04:40.150 - 00:04:49.610, Speaker D: That feels like something that comes up in the first hour of Diligence when you think about this project but curious to hear what you guys think. Just is an overall shit show in my opinion.
00:04:53.400 - 00:05:42.500, Speaker C: I'm not really sure if I have a super specialized take here. I did see Arca. They proposed the back basically because the FDB of Aragod I guess is trading below the book value of the treasury. I guess I should have looked this up before I just went to but I would guess most of that treasury is made up of the native token probably. I don't know about that as an investment strategy, frankly for projects at this stage. But yeah, I think it's kind of unmasking some of the decentralization theater that happens especially at early stage Dows. And every time there's something like this that happens it's not like, strictly speaking, a massive deal but I think it does sort of chip away at this idea of decentralization that crypto is supposed to be.
00:05:42.500 - 00:05:45.780, Speaker C: So yeah, I just think it's kind of a black mark overall.
00:05:47.080 - 00:06:36.020, Speaker B: Yeah, not necessarily saying that this is the case at all but in this particular situation. But I do think that it does kind of vade the question of what happens when a protocol is done and it's built, it's complete. We're not going to be changing it anymore. What do you do with the treasury that people are sitting on at that point? And I think ultimately what should happen is that it should be value that is delivered back to the community, back to the users of the protocol in some way shape or yeah, I mean, in this case, obviously not happening. Also, I don't even know what Aragon is at this point. They have a massive treasury, but also not a ton of product. And so, yeah, I think this situation is very different.
00:06:36.020 - 00:06:44.520, Speaker B: But being able to have the protocol being finished and then being able to deliver that value back to users I think is an important step in sufficient decentralization.
00:06:45.980 - 00:07:29.830, Speaker A: So let me just make sure I understand this correctly. So before this, the so basically the argument is that Aragon did a bad job of establishing value for the Ant token, which is their governance token. The ant fell below the treasury value. Arca came in, bought a bunch of tokens, then wrapped the tokens in a very quick amount of time, gave them voting rights. They voted for pro rata distribution of the treasury back to token holders so they could make some money. And then rather than doing that, like, following the actual governance vote, aragon said that they were getting 51% attacked and changed it so that Dow no longer the Dow but now governed by a grants program.
00:07:30.760 - 00:08:01.372, Speaker D: That's right. At the time of vote, I think Aragon was like 120,000,000 and they had 200 million of non stable or non native network assets in the treasury. And so there was this ARB if you could get it all returned. But if you've ever done governance or ever spent time in any of these Dows, it's very clear to you that there's kind of two phases of governance. One is snapshot. And Snapshot is not like snapshot is not connected to a smart contract. Snapshot is more of like a polling mechanism.
00:08:01.372 - 00:08:21.124, Speaker D: And then you need someone with a multi SIG or I guess in this case, someone who had unilateral control over all the assets to go do something. The corporate rate to be just got hosed here. But also should you have known that? Probably, yeah.
00:08:21.162 - 00:08:48.208, Speaker A: Well, I think you're trying to apply the activist investing model to crypto. Right? What's the activist model in a nutshell? And you take a company that has great products, a lot of use, like a lot of customers, huge tam, passionate audience and community and user base, usually cash flow positive, all good things, all green checks. The X would be misaligned management or misaligned employees. Well, that's what it seems like you.
00:08:48.214 - 00:09:35.550, Speaker B: Have with everything I'd actually say activist investing. Yes, for sure. This is more of like the classic Warren Buffett investing where his plastic line is like, I'm not trying to find solid companies that are trading at reasonable prices. I'm trying to find cigarette butts that people have already literally thrown to the gutter, but there's still a couple of puffs left in them. Things that are trading below their residual value, things that are trading below their cash value. But the leap here is that you have the assumption that you're going to be able to take that purchase of these assets, the anti token in this case, for 120,000,000 in value, and be able to recover 200 million in value. I think that's Vance's point, which I totally agree with.
00:09:35.550 - 00:09:48.144, Speaker B: Anyone who's experienced in any of these decentralized governance mechanisms, you're not going to be able to just flip a switch and turn over, like, all right, give me the money now. No, that's not how this works.
00:09:48.262 - 00:10:01.476, Speaker D: No, you're on court. You give me money. These things are honey pots for trad five people, I feel like, because it looks exactly like traditional finance, but it's not.
00:10:01.658 - 00:10:06.010, Speaker A: So what's happening with Aragon now? So now they took back control and they're fine.
00:10:07.180 - 00:10:15.988, Speaker D: I wouldn't say they're fine. I would say there's, like, pending lawsuits. But it's a Swiss registered utility. So pack your bags. You're going to Switzerland.
00:10:16.164 - 00:10:55.290, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's why this is going to be bad. You only get, like mike and I have been talking about this a lot, actually, with Bitcoin, which is, like, now that Bitcoin's venturing into DeFi on Bitcoin and things like that. It's actually hurting the brand, I think, because you kind of only get as a company, like one, maybe two words to describe your brand, and you have to rally a community around that word and that Ethos. And if Aragon isn't willing to operate as a real Dao here, their mission and their values are completely killed, which kills that that is their customer. Yeah.
00:10:56.220 - 00:11:12.430, Speaker D: I would say they lost track of who their customers were a long time ago. Aragon core doesn't really work like Aragon. The Dow governance framework is like, okay, not great. How does it all connect to a token? Extremely unclear. Maybe some of these things shouldn't have a token, but.
00:11:17.360 - 00:11:21.936, Speaker A: This is a bummer to me, because if Aragon didn't have a token, aragon could have just been.
00:11:21.958 - 00:11:24.016, Speaker C: A sick, SaaS company where they just.
00:11:24.038 - 00:11:31.250, Speaker A: Built really good products and just charged people twenty k a year. Increased it as the seats went up, and boom, called a day.
00:11:32.500 - 00:11:50.410, Speaker C: Just a note here. I was actually wrong. I just assumed most of their treasury would be in their native token, but they actually did a much better job than most Dows in diversifying. So I would have loved if USDC and ETH were flipped here, but, I mean, this is like a top 5% of back treasury management. Yes.
00:11:51.340 - 00:12:04.670, Speaker D: These are ideas that come to people in bear markets when they're like, OOH, we should go after this person and get their money because they're not spending it wisely. And it kind of never seems to work, I guess. Rook dow kind of worked in this same vein that was, like, the success case.
00:12:06.880 - 00:12:16.688, Speaker A: Vance why is that wrong? The token market cap is 110,000,000 and their treasure is 185,000,000. So if you're like that's a huge mismatch there.
00:12:16.774 - 00:12:37.208, Speaker D: Sure. Your upside is you make one X. Your downside is you lose everything. One X, there's no Asymmetry there and chances are you're going to get rugged. And the amount of people that have pitched like Tezos has, I think it's like two or $3 billion of their treasury. Now. Let's go get them.
00:12:37.208 - 00:12:57.950, Speaker D: It's like, I'll see you when you get back. I'm just going to buy Ethan chill. It doesn't feel like that's the best use of your time. And there's things that feel like work when you invest, like when you're doing things and then there's just things that don't where you're just holding and being patient. It feels like people just wanted to do some work here and it didn't really pan out.
00:12:58.320 - 00:13:32.136, Speaker B: And it stems from the fact that you have all these activist investors in TradFi, you have the Warren Buffett investment standards in Tradfight and people want to replicate that and be those things in web three. And because of that it's sort of like this imposter syndrome of, oh, I want to be able to go off and extract value from 125 to 185 and it just doesn't work the same way. And so yeah, I think we've seen this a number of times. We know a number of investors who have the same mentality and have the same strategy, but frankly, I haven't seen.
00:13:32.158 - 00:13:33.930, Speaker D: A repeatable process that works.
00:13:34.560 - 00:13:41.564, Speaker C: By the way, did you see that Hindenburg's latest target is actually Carl? I don't know.
00:13:41.602 - 00:13:43.390, Speaker D: Oh yeah, crazy story.
00:13:44.080 - 00:13:48.496, Speaker C: It doesn't look good for the I.
00:13:48.518 - 00:13:50.530, Speaker A: Haven'T looked at this. What's going on?
00:13:50.980 - 00:14:21.704, Speaker D: So there's basically allegations of him inflating asset values that are illiquid and there's pretty good evidence to suggest that that's probably happening. Carl owns 85% of the shares and his son owns 85% of the shares of Carl Icon company. I forget what it's called, maybe it's just called Icon Enterprises Enterprises. And he's pledged 65% of the 85% as personal margin loans. Now if I told you this story.
00:14:21.822 - 00:14:23.128, Speaker A: What did I remind you of?
00:14:23.214 - 00:15:28.720, Speaker D: Did I remove marking up liquid assets, paying quarterly dividends that people have advised him to not do, allegedly colluding with Jefferies, which is an investment bank, to sell these shares to retail and then taking out massive personal margin? Know he's obviously like a legend and I'm sure he would say terrible things about crypto if he had the chance. But what are you like, what is the most plausible solution for this or answer for all these questions? And he hasn't put any answers to the questions that Hinderberg asks and he's just continuing to increase his pledges of shares against these margin loans. And the things that he will not disclose are what are the terms of the loans, what's the liquidation price, what's the loan to value, how much debt have you pulled out of this thing? And the other interesting part is, so he pays out this massive 2% dividend per quarter, but he doesn't pay it to himself. He takes his dividend in paid in Kind shares.
00:15:30.100 - 00:15:31.250, Speaker C: I saw that.
00:15:31.860 - 00:15:48.148, Speaker D: Think of this as like, if he were to take the dividend in cash, he would dilute everybody else's dividend. So he doesn't do that. Instead, what he does is he just takes more shares, pledges them as margin loans, and it all works in a circular way.
00:15:48.314 - 00:15:49.828, Speaker B: Watts on, watts off.
00:15:49.914 - 00:15:53.690, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm sure there's no problem, but.
00:15:55.100 - 00:16:37.170, Speaker C: I don't know, it makes me wonder how many times other people have run this same scheme. Because obviously people who listen to this podcast are familiar with the FTT scheme that he was pulling. And you could basically replace FTT with shares of Icon Enterprises, and Jeffries with Genesis, and you'd be right there with the exact same analogy. And I don't just I didn't realize I was like when I kind of put that together with what he was doing, what SBF was doing, I was like, oh, that's actually kind of clever. But maybe he was just running the playbook that millions of billionaires have run before. I don't know.
00:16:38.020 - 00:16:41.650, Speaker B: The answer is a lot a lot of people have run this playbook before.
00:16:43.500 - 00:16:45.850, Speaker A: Got to imagine Bill Ackman's pretty hyped, right?
00:16:47.740 - 00:16:52.856, Speaker D: He was retweeting indenberg and all that stuff. And he's sitting in his apartment like.
00:16:52.878 - 00:17:09.548, Speaker A: What the fuck is I bet that guy's so fired up right now. One of those epic moments of financial media ever was when Ackman went on CNBC, and then Icon joins the Call and they're duking it out on CNBC.
00:17:09.644 - 00:17:12.480, Speaker C: Is that herbalife or something? Yeah, Herbalife.
00:17:13.940 - 00:17:17.292, Speaker D: All right. And then Bill Ackman made a documentary. Still on Netflix.
00:17:17.356 - 00:17:18.208, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that.
00:17:18.214 - 00:17:19.644, Speaker D: Well, all that good, honestly.
00:17:19.772 - 00:17:22.352, Speaker C: Yeah. You know what it just reminds me of?
00:17:22.406 - 00:17:34.360, Speaker A: Then he did a two hour pitch to investors about why it was a Ponzi's era pyramid scheme. And then he asked for questions. A bunch of questions went up, and he called on his dad first, who had placed a question in the audience.
00:17:36.700 - 00:17:38.600, Speaker D: Anybody else want to call their dad?
00:17:42.380 - 00:17:42.888, Speaker A: Wow.
00:17:42.974 - 00:17:58.732, Speaker C: You can't make this stuff up. Know? Don't want to detour too far from here. But Drachen. Miller did a great speech this week. You can look it up. And he had this line. It's resonated with me having been in Crypto now for, whatever, five years.
00:17:58.732 - 00:18:19.620, Speaker C: But yeah, when there are zero interest rates, people just make really dumb decisions. When there are 0% interest rates for eleven years, people make really dumb decisions. And I don't know if it's Carl Icon, but I do think everything that happened in Crypto is probably a preview for the real show, which is going to be TradFi. And we'll figure out some people are definitely swimming naked.
00:18:20.680 - 00:18:45.736, Speaker D: I feel like we're further in the process of crypto kind of getting worked and then cleaning itself up. We're still kind of on cleanup duty for the past two years. We're distributing celsius. Voyager BlockFi. Genesis will get resolved one way or the other. This also feels like the bear market where everybody gets their coins back from Mount Gox and gets their coin back. Meaning the US government is selling it on coinbase.
00:18:45.736 - 00:19:13.096, Speaker D: But I think there's a good deal of mopping up that we still have to do. I feel like the TradFi space, we haven't even had the spillage yet. It's just like everything is so shaky and frenzied that if Icon is taking it in the teeth, he's supposed to be the guy who's responsible. Basically the first one TradFi has yet.
00:19:13.118 - 00:19:28.264, Speaker B: To hit their luna moment. And the other thing that happened this week, last year is luna. It has officially been twelve months since everything started happening and we're still here.
00:19:28.382 - 00:19:36.990, Speaker D: Day that it happened, Michael and I were at a wedding. I gave the best man speech and then literally 2 hours later we were OOH. It's all falling apart, isn't it?
00:19:38.640 - 00:19:40.060, Speaker B: That was terrible.
00:19:40.480 - 00:19:58.420, Speaker C: That was supposed this was around the same time as permissionless last year and Doe was supposed to be they actually sent out a whole bunch of swag. Terra swag. They had someone come by real quick and grab all of that, but not quick enough because I got a T shirt.
00:20:00.840 - 00:20:02.288, Speaker B: Commemorative t shirt.
00:20:02.384 - 00:20:26.824, Speaker C: Commemorative t shirt. Yeah. I would love to get your guys thoughts. Just moving it back to crypto here. There are a couple of big proposals that went live this week on Arbitrum and uniswap, I love to start with the Arbitrum one. So this was proposed yesterday, so May 10, but the proposal is distribution of Dow revenue to ARB token holders. Just to read you kind of the high level TLDR.
00:20:26.824 - 00:21:14.428, Speaker C: The objective is to distribute a portion of the accumulated revenue from the Arbitram Dow to ARB token holders. This will align community incentives and give ARB a purpose beyond a, quote, worthless governance token. Love that they included that there. As stated in recent tweets from Arbitrum, the Dow has accumulated roughly 3352 ethan revenue from L two base and surplus fees. Distribution of revenue will be proportionate to the amount of ARB tokens delegated by each holder. So the benefits basically that they outline are distributing Dow revenue to ARB token holders will align community incentives and create a more engaged and committed user base and it will give ARP this purpose. So I guess the disclosure that we have to caveat here is that Blockworks is a pretty big delegate for Arbitrage, so no opinions given here are indicative of anything.
00:21:14.428 - 00:21:20.450, Speaker C: Yeah, caveat there. But framework, guys, what's your sort of take here?
00:21:24.340 - 00:22:37.848, Speaker D: Feels like the Overton Window is moving for turning on fee switches or sharing fees generally, which I think is really positive. I think if we get into the next bull run and you don't have real economics flowing at least to the Dow, preferably to the token itself, I think we're going to look pretty silly. There has to be an end date in terms of when this happens and I think it underscores just like what the temperature is of entrepreneurs in the US. They're still willing to launch tokens, they're still willing to do things like turning on fee switches and maybe they feel like they're decentralized enough or they feel like the protocol is finished and they can kind of call it just like this neutral third party layer. But I think it's positive in terms of reading the room and understanding that the entrepreneurs that are still here are going to die on this hill, either in this country or a different one and figure out how to make these protocols self sustaining. And you have to squint to see it. But at one point ETH was probably in a similar position, like the transition of proof of work to proof of stake giving back economics to the network, eventually they were just decentralized enough to do it.
00:22:37.848 - 00:22:49.470, Speaker D: And I think people are just saying why are we not as decentralized as they are? And maybe they aren't in practice, but they're starting to make arguments that put them in that, which I think is important.
00:22:50.560 - 00:24:00.820, Speaker B: Yes. The only thing that I would add is that in these submarkets where you have a number of different players that are going after the exact same models, the exact same consumers, users of these protocols, imagine that you're one of those competitors and the other people are able to do this, whereas you are not. It's sort of like imagine you're a centralized provider versus a decentralized opportunity where there's token incentives and there's token models that incentivize usage and incentivize people to come to your platform. It's sort of like this is a level of competition that if you don't have it, you're not going to be able to compete and you're just going to get bulldozed by everybody else who's able to do this. So ultimately I completely agree. I think a lot of what is going to change, the stuff that is going to change is like we're going to have a model probably by the end of this year as to how this stuff can work. And there's a lot of movement on Capitol Hill right now to be able to have a framework to be able to build these things in this way in the US.
00:24:00.820 - 00:24:14.250, Speaker B: And not under the ire of regulatory pressure. And so yeah, I think generally this is going to be the mainstay of what these future decentralized networks become.
00:24:18.460 - 00:25:25.820, Speaker C: I hear what you guys are saying. I think I've got a little pushback, which is the way I sort of think about this is it's a capital allocation question? And for me, usually when you talk about dividends or share buybacks or something like that, the implication is I don't have a better use for this capital. Like I couldn't put this to work in some way which would lead to more value creation in the equity or the token of the project. So any sort of return to token holders, that just doesn't make sense to me at this stage. I guess that's an open question. Vance, to your point is, are these protocols? I just, I have to imagine that's their job, right? If you're on the Arbitrum team, you're supposed to be allocating capital and creating value, that's going to lead to the appreciation of ARB the token, which I feel like is the most that's got to be the most productive use of capital for a project at this stage. The other thing I would like, maybe the other way I kind of think about it is once you start to return capital to token holders, you can't really stop, right? It's the same way that investors become super accustomed to a dividend.
00:25:25.820 - 00:26:06.344, Speaker C: It was GE, right, that was super famous for their dividend. It was like as good as gold. And yeah, it did really good stuff for GE stock. A lot of people bought it for that dividend, but later, once they had problems or there are better uses for that capital, maybe they didn't have the option to take it away because so much of the holder base of that stock was conditioned to expect the dividend. That was the reason why they were holding it. So I think the race in between these l two S is wildly competitive, and if it were me, I would be trying to find uses for that capital instead of giving it away back to tokenomas at this stage, literally.
00:26:06.392 - 00:27:29.540, Speaker B: Vance and I were having this conversation this week as to what does value accrual look like for these tokens and how do you value these things going forward. Part of me agrees that, okay, yes, using all the different TradFi analogies, like dividends, share, buybacks, whatever it is, you can look at them the same way. You can't take away a dividend because it looked negative. You can't put the genie back in the bottle once it happened. The thing that I frankly just don't necessarily think is congruent here is I don't think any of these things I don't think any of these tokens are valued based on fundamentals. So when you're talking about like, okay, is the profit providing to the treasury? And are we valuing this thing on price to sales or price to earnings, or is the share buyback that's driving? I think all of the stuff is valued based on flows, which is who is buying, who is selling? And if you can inject yourself into the flows question, there's actually a huge amount of undetermined value that you can drive for the token itself. Because it's not like if Maker was to go off and double their revenue and therefore double the share, buyback and burn, that they would be valued twice as much on a token value perspective.
00:27:29.540 - 00:28:23.380, Speaker B: Maybe some people would look at it and they'd be able to say, okay, yeah, we can assume this and that, but it really comes down to what are the flows of the token itself, what's supply and demand and who is buying and who is selling. So I generally think if you have a bunch of cash flow that's flowing to the token, having a token economic model that enables additional buying or additional purchasing of the token itself from the treasury but maybe it's redistribution of that token to the shareholders or maybe it's redistribution of the token to the people that are staking it. Whatever those models might be, that becomes super valuable. But we really have yet to see that because right now the only asset that is earning this much revenue is ETH and they burn part of the fees, but nobody else has hit that scale.
00:28:25.560 - 00:28:47.176, Speaker C: I hear you on that. Okay, a PNL might not be appropriate for something like that. And yeah, these things aren't trading based on price to sales or price to earnings or any other metric like that. But my counter to you would be neither is basically any other early stage startup, right? Like an early stage SaaS company. You know, investors aren't necessarily underwriting that based on their P, L or cash flow.
00:28:47.208 - 00:28:47.356, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:47.378 - 00:29:05.860, Speaker C: There are certain metrics that you would look at, right? It would be like CAC and LTV and Churn and growth rate and all that sort of stuff that goes into the valuation. I feel like we might just be at too early of a stage of crypto where those, like, what determines flows? What is the leading indicator for price.
00:29:06.010 - 00:29:31.740, Speaker B: I actually disagree. I mean, as soon as you move past the Series A, people are valuing this thing based off of what is your price to revenue, what is your potential for profit. You assume all these things. You don't ask those questions because they don't have any earnings, they don't have any major EBITDA revenue multiples, whatever it is. That stuff doesn't exist for a Series B company. But it should because that's what people are.
00:29:31.810 - 00:30:06.090, Speaker A: So then, Michael, wouldn't you assume then that crypto has probably just been to it's been in the seed in the series a phase? And there's a decent likelihood that in the next cycle, as more professional investors continue coming into crypto, they will start to look at Arbitrum and not just look at the flows, but they'll look at Arbitrum and say, okay, you're doing about 100 million in annualized revenue. You've got like 30% to 40% margins after the call data cost. After 4844, you're going to probably go up to like 90% margins. Okay, that's a pretty exciting business here. And you start valuing things on that.
00:30:06.780 - 00:30:26.060, Speaker B: You would assume that, but these are like the most inefficient markets that we've ever seen. They're going to get more efficient over time. But I don't think people are going to start valuing these things. Think of all the infrastructure, the financial infrastructure that exists around even startups, but also just like publicly traded stocks.
00:30:26.420 - 00:30:26.748, Speaker A: We're.
00:30:26.764 - 00:30:32.000, Speaker B: Not valuing these things and trading these things based off of those fundamentals.
00:30:33.140 - 00:31:15.992, Speaker D: I have a slightly different perspective. I think we've gone from no valuation framework to there was one that was like TVL divided by market cap that was just like insane and meant nothing. And now you're more in the price to sales land. But what the gross margins are, how much goes to the Dow? Is the fee switch even turned on? People don't seem to be thinking about that. But I think we're trending towards a more efficient marketplace. And I think the real point is once you have flows that confirm these metrics, you're going to have more of a rational valuation framework. Imagine if Uniswap was buying back the Token.
00:31:15.992 - 00:31:52.920, Speaker D: Imagine if any of the maker does it right now and it trades at a pretty tight range of like 20 to 30 priced earnings. I think we're generally going to get there. And I think you also need to potentially come up with a new valuation framework. And we've taken a couple of shots at that. But I think mostly what you need is like, you usually have people who are passive buyers of stocks or commodities or bonds that are trading things based on if it gets this cheap or this expensive, I'm going to do this or that. You don't really have that in crypto. Having the structural flow, I think, is kind of something that you're going to need to have if you're a serious project coming into the next run.
00:31:52.920 - 00:31:54.760, Speaker D: That's at least my thoughts.
00:31:55.580 - 00:32:15.152, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. I think a lot of it has to do with the investor base. And in TradFi markets, they do have these ranges that they look for, for P multiples and that kind of thing. And if it goes below a certain multiple or something, a bunch more people will buy kind of thing. I don't think crypto is still mostly retail. I just don't think people are thinking.
00:32:15.206 - 00:32:44.892, Speaker B: Like that not only just like ranges, they have indexes where if you're a part of this or a part of that, or you hit this threshold literally, the index will have to buy you that type of stuff. That's what I mean by the infrastructure. Just doesn't exist right now. So we don't even know how many retail investors in a given Token have ever been to Tokenterminal.com or like DFI Lava to actually understand what these metrics are.
00:32:45.026 - 00:32:48.296, Speaker A: Probably like 15% or buffer.
00:32:48.328 - 00:32:59.650, Speaker B: Two search enter random site here. But what is that percentage? It's probably less than 50.
00:33:00.420 - 00:33:02.768, Speaker A: Definitely less than it's probably less than like 0.5.
00:33:02.854 - 00:33:04.050, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:33:04.420 - 00:33:06.448, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so too.
00:33:06.614 - 00:33:19.076, Speaker A: Let's talk about Uniswap's fee switch. So this week GFX proposed turning on the fee switch. I don't know if you guys took a look at it. I can give an overview, but yeah. How do you guys feel about that?
00:33:19.098 - 00:34:20.424, Speaker D: 160 million dollars in six month revenue. Probably a little bit more than that in a bull market. This is something that when things really get going is probably generating like mid nine figures of revenue. That's pretty impressive in terms of you're not investing in a startup for what are they making today? It's kind of where things are going to go and it feels like that's kind of really the bar for success for these DApps going forward is like, can you generate nine figures of revenue per year, like mid nine figures? And I think there's like a few that can get there. Uniswap certainly one of them. I guess my question on this is what's going on in the background with the Dow? We've heard different things about different jurisdictions that you can do this in and maybe it's more like, is this the foundation that's leading? Like that's definitely a question. The other thing that stood out is just how reasonable their fees are compared to Coinbase and I guess less so.
00:34:20.424 - 00:34:40.176, Speaker D: Binance oh, yeah, it's like pretty cheap and the maker fees are negative and the taker fees are less than the centralized exchanges. It's not surprising that they're doing more volume in these places. The unisop is doing more volume than Coinbase on a frequent basis. It just appears to have significant product market fit.
00:34:40.358 - 00:34:43.600, Speaker C: Vance could you explain how these maker fees are negative?
00:34:46.020 - 00:35:41.172, Speaker D: So, I mean, they're just incentivizing people to effectively add liquidity to the pool. This may not mean a ton if you are taking a limit order on centralized exchanges. If you make a limit order, you're usually given a little bit less of a fee than you would if you just sold it all at market. And this is kind of like that idea taken to extreme where you're charged negative fees on making limit orders, but if you're just taking random liquidity, it's going to cost you, which is probably the right model. Just looking at Coinbase's fees, they just seem what is it if you scroll up a little bit, 40 basis points for things under $10,000 and 60 basis points if you're the maker. That's pretty crazy. Uniswap has the inverse fee structure of that where the makers are negative and the takers are significantly lower.
00:35:41.306 - 00:36:03.000, Speaker B: But that's sort of a misnomer, right? Because who is a maker on uniswap? That's a liquidity provider. And the one thing about providing liquidity on uniswap is you also are affected by impermanent loss. So while I understand they want to represent these things as negative, I'm not sure that that's like a fair representation.
00:36:03.900 - 00:36:44.760, Speaker D: Yeah, we don't provide liquidity in univ three for a reason. We found that it's very easy to get picked off, it's very hard to provide liquidity profitably. And so I think the real litmus test at the end of the day is like, what do the LPs think? And there's a lot of stale liquidity that are in these things, kind of like uninformed retail just getting hit. So I think over the long, long term. It's not about what are these fees for the people who are swapping? It's like, are your liquidity providers making money after impermanent loss? And we've had multiple portfolio companies try to build options, vaults, derivatives, things like that. A lot of the impediment to them doing it is the Unib Three architecture with regards to you as a local provider.
00:36:45.100 - 00:37:22.900, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think it's a super interesting point and I think it connects with whenever we were talking about blend, this kind of key assumption. Look, they spell this right out here. The LPs making the most money off uniswap are not retail traders, they're professional market makers, just like the ones seen on traditional exchanges. So I kind of do think you're seeing the evolution in just market structure for some of these DEXes. And basically they're very comfortable assuming that the people that are the entities that will be providing liquidity into the future are not retail. It's not retail, it's professional hedge funds and market makers. And I broadly think that's the right assumption.
00:37:22.900 - 00:38:23.620, Speaker C: I'm super interested. I'm kind of borrowing actually from a framework that Miles, who's been on the show at Rivery, has. But if you think about most of these protocols as kind of two sided marketplaces, a pretty interesting indicator to pay attention to is the amount of pricing power that these protocols have over their supply side. In this case, it'll just be super interesting to see basically how the LPs interact and if it migrates somewhere else, like Curve or something like that. Like to use the analogy of something like Airbnb, which is also a two sided marketplace where the band is users and the supply side is homes. If Airbnb jacks their fees up, or how many people stop supplying their home for people to stay in, and if they jack their fees up and nobody stops supplying their homes, then Airbnb's got a pretty good business. But if they move their fee at all and they lose a whole bunch of their supply, then that's something that you'd want to pay attention to.
00:38:23.620 - 00:38:54.944, Speaker C: So Uniswap has been talking about this fee switch for a while and this proposal gets into some of the technical. It's not a technically easy thing to do, actually, especially for V Three. It's kind of tough and they're testing it out on polygon first as well. V Three on polygon, which I think is smart because the stakes are just a little lower. There's lower TVO and volume up there. I just kind of want to see what happens at this point. I just want to see what happens.
00:38:54.944 - 00:39:00.144, Speaker C: Do you think a bunch of liquidity will migrate off of Uniswap at some point?
00:39:00.182 - 00:39:47.440, Speaker D: Yeah. Or like, it won't be the source of retail flow. That would be another option, I think, where Udiswap does really well are like long tail pepe style coins where Uniswap doesn't do as well are like the blue that and frankly, that's where their fees are generally the highest as so I don't know. The landscape is just going to change with regards to liquidity venues over the next few years and I think the first step is getting the money into the Dow. The second step is getting the money to the and like really the thing that Uniswap does not have is like a really strong community that can help them reason through all these issues and it feels like that's going to be just super important at some point but probably not immediately.
00:39:51.160 - 00:39:52.550, Speaker C: I agree with that.
00:39:53.400 - 00:39:53.812, Speaker D: Actually.
00:39:53.866 - 00:40:29.376, Speaker C: Do you want to talk about there was some or does anyone else have any more comments on the Bswitch for Uniswap? No, this is also just because I know there's been a whole bunch of different proposals for this over the years and sometimes it seems like they're picking up steam and then they kind of end up dying. But GFX Labs like Getty Hill, they're like pretty serious people and deeply in the weeds on Uniswap. I feel like this feels like it actually might have some legs. I know we've seen it before, but I'll be very curious to see how this plays out over the coming weeks and months.
00:40:29.558 - 00:40:34.370, Speaker D: What's quorum on a vote like this? What does it take?
00:40:36.660 - 00:40:38.752, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. I'm not actually sure.
00:40:38.806 - 00:40:39.650, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:40:40.260 - 00:40:41.056, Speaker B: No idea.
00:40:41.158 - 00:40:53.050, Speaker D: Usually it's like five in some Dows we're involved in it's like 0.5%. I would imagine something like this is probably like more of like 5%. But you're going to need a lot of tokens to get this through.
00:40:55.580 - 00:41:27.650, Speaker C: There are lots of complications as well. So one of the big hurdles that has made this not get over the finish line is just tax and legal concerns and GFX basically has this disclaimer where look, this is kind of a treasury issue. I'm paraphrasing here. So they don't have a great solution for yeah, I mean I have no idea how that would work from a tax standpoint. If the Dow itself starts accruing revenue, what's the legal entity that ends up paying the tax?
00:41:30.420 - 00:41:54.804, Speaker D: This is the tricky part. If you can do it at all, it's best to not have it go to a Dow. You should just have it go straight to the tokens because people who get the money, you should figure that out or do a buy and burn where there is no revenue accruing. It's just like buy pressure and then deletion of, you know, these are complex questions and nobody has answers for them.
00:41:54.942 - 00:42:48.750, Speaker B: Well, I think it's also exceedingly difficult when you're a US company based in the United States with US persons and that is the Dow that you're going forward with. That being said, I think that and who knows exactly what's going to come out, but they talked about it a couple of weeks ago. It seems like there's going to be some proposal that goes forward in the next couple of months for things like how a security can become a commodity, what actually means decentralized or sufficiently decentralized. There will be a lot of answers to these questions in the United States, it seems, and we'll see whether or not that House proposal goes through and gets ratified by the Senate or voted on by the Senate. But I do think that it's know one hand, if not both hands tied behind your back while you're trying to operate from the US.
00:42:49.840 - 00:43:09.490, Speaker A: What about on the regulatory side with how you guys treat governance tokens? If you owned Uniswap Tokens, I don't know if you do or don't, but if you owned Uniswap Tokens and this went forward, would you feel comfortable voting on this in today's regulatory world, or would you just you wouldn't touch that.
00:43:10.120 - 00:43:25.640, Speaker B: What we do with governance is we have a program where we delegate to a number of different entities and have them vote on our behalf. That's how we operate within governance.
00:43:26.140 - 00:43:29.224, Speaker A: And do you trust them to vote on your behalf, or do you tell.
00:43:29.262 - 00:43:44.910, Speaker B: Them how you want we do not tell them anything. Usually most of these entities are like blockchain clubs at universities, and they can vote on however they see it.
00:43:45.440 - 00:44:16.928, Speaker A: Vance didn't like that question so much that he muted and turned off his camera. I haven't seen that one in a while. This is a good time for me to call out that we are hiring a podcast producer on the Crypto are garrett was like, do not forget. Do not forget. I totally forgot to pull that out. We're hiring a podcast producer. If you have a very deep understanding of crypto, DeFi NFTs, all that kind of fun stuff, come join us.
00:44:16.928 - 00:44:36.092, Speaker A: You are not the one editing the shows on the video and audio side. You are the one kind of like overseeing a show. So you'll help us source and schedule guests. You plan and research episodes. You lay up some good content so that Michael can know what to say. Tough to get this stuff off the noggin. Yeah, you craft the content post production, all that kind of fun stuff.
00:44:36.092 - 00:44:41.968, Speaker A: So, yeah, if that's you slide through the DMs actually, don't do that. Go on our careers page and apply.
00:44:42.054 - 00:45:41.180, Speaker C: Let's talk about everyone's favorite Mev bot, jared from Subway. This is a great thread. I just thought it was a cool I'm not sure if folks actually saw this thread, but Robert Miller kind of shared some light on the actually, just I'll just share my screen here and walk people through it, but I think it's just kind of a cool case study of how these mev bots actually work in practice. So basically, Jared, he's sort of famous or this bot is sort of famous for making a whole bunch of money sandwiching traders on Pepe, the Meme coin, and basically the three bits of alpha that Robert walked us through was the way they do their inventory is very different from other bots. So if you think about a sandwich, depending on there are two assets that are required for a sandwich, and it kind of requires that you start in one asset. So ETH is sort of the front run. Then you move into the meme coin Pepe, and then you back run back into ETH.
00:45:41.180 - 00:46:42.036, Speaker C: But Jared actually takes a very different approach and starts with he's got a whole bunch of supply of Pepe, the token, and then he goes back into ETH and then back into Pepe and there's just much less competition. The reason why more bots don't do that is just because warehousing becomes very difficult. If you think of your balance sheet there, you don't really want to hold a whole bunch of your assets in something that's as volatile as something like Pepe, because any profits that you get from the sandwiching could be offset by declines from the meme coin basically failing. But I guess Jared from Subway is extremely good at sniping, and he actually bought the coin, Pepe just ten minutes after it was deployed. Just a little tinfoil hatty right there. But that's how he gets his warehouse or his inventory, and then he kind of does this interesting strategy of Mega sandwiching. So he basically puts more trades into the sandwich than just a one, one one.
00:46:42.036 - 00:46:49.770, Speaker C: So it's kind of an interesting I don't know if you guys had any takeaways, but I thought it was just a cool sort of inside look at how some of these mev bots work.
00:46:51.500 - 00:47:49.950, Speaker D: I mean, it feels like we saw Jane Street stop doing mev trading, I think, like two or three weeks. And like, these strategies feel very much in the gray area of like, is this profitable trading or is this something else? Kind of like Avi eisenberg style. Yeah, I mean, it's not surprising to see the big guys pull out of this specifically and these Jared from Subway style characters start to emerge. But I think it just kind of is proof positive that at a certain level of economic activity, you see the turn on and then the mev is a substantial portion of fees. I forget how much he spent in the few days where he was really going for it, but it was a substantial part of the mev burn that happened via 1559. But I don't know, these are all good signs like Mev's turning back on. These crazy coins are turning back on.
00:47:49.950 - 00:47:54.860, Speaker D: Pretty easy as an ETH validator to just sit there and collect your winnings.
00:47:55.680 - 00:48:28.650, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I was going to say. It's just that maybe less the MEB side, but just the level of activity and engagement on Pepe itself just makes me feel like we're starting to see the green shoots of what this bear market is and moving past it. And MEB is going to be a benefactor for all of. And to Vance's point, I think it's very difficult to be doing that as an institution and necessarily from the United States. So you're going to start to see more Jared's from Subways, less.
00:48:31.820 - 00:49:31.710, Speaker C: Think it's I think it's a tough. The builder market in general is one that's sort of opaque and rule of know up till this point hasn't necessarily been applied to mev. The regulators are there's some evidence that they're kind of aware of it, but they're not paying a lot of attention. Now there was a great thread from this account, AI something, I'll get the name, but basically questioning whether or not if you were a builder that had access to essentially order flow and you were trading using that information, does that constitute material non public information? MNPI. And then is it insider trading? And you could certainly make a case for it. And my guess for something like Jane Street and if you look at you can check, relay, scan, they have one of the most active and successful builders, but they haven't won anything in the past week. And I would guess some compliance or legal or someone over there has said, hey guys, we could be at risk here, it's probably not worth it.
00:49:31.710 - 00:49:36.860, Speaker C: I doubt they pull out of the builder market in general, but they probably have to retool some of their strategies.
00:49:39.360 - 00:50:09.640, Speaker B: The other thing I would say is this stuff is like water. If you block one of it, like one direction of it's just going to flow somewhere else. And it's not like the people that are searching are just going to like, oh that's it, game up, we're moving on and nobody else is going to pick up where they left off and continue forward. Someone will, the value will be there. It'll just have to be somewhere that is a more friendly jurisdiction.
00:50:12.380 - 00:50:50.084, Speaker C: The e scaling roadmap. Maybe smarter people than me could push back on this idea, but I think sort of implicitly requires the presence of larger, more sophisticated builders. I think Suave is trying to get ahead of this with their ability to decentralize block building to some extent. But even a sequencer right now is the combination of like it's a combined builder and proposer is what we separated on E main chain. But especially as you have a proliferation of different L two S and then eventually you get maybe it's decentralized sequencers, maybe it's shared sequencers. There are still just dumb pipes that do the sequencing. You need a builder that understands state to stand in front of that.
00:50:50.084 - 00:51:08.792, Speaker C: And builders, the more order flow that you see, the more transactions that you have access to, the better you'll be at winning blocks. So it's going to happen in Cosmos, I think it's going to happen in Ethel two S as well. You're going to have big builders. So I doubt James Tree is going to pull out permanently. I think they're just going to reassess.
00:51:08.856 - 00:51:50.136, Speaker D: Well, I saw some really silly liquidity chart which was fake, by the way. I don't know if people I saw a bunch of people retweeting it. I was like mathematically there's no way that this is possible. Where it was like there used to be like 30,000 BTC liquidity within plus or -2% and now it's like one bitcoin okay well, is that true. I don't have to do the math to know that unrealistic, but it just spread like wildfire and then the last day of comments, all I heard on Twitter was like, low liquidity, watch out out there. Could get crazy. All idiots just like think to yourself these people are not pulling out.
00:51:50.136 - 00:52:22.070, Speaker D: And if they do, there's going to be crypto native market makers to step in. Which frankly, I would rather have I would rather have big crypto native market makers develop themselves than anything else. That's kind of thing I'm still looking for is back in the day you had Alameda squaring off with three AC squaring off with all the other crypto native market makers. It doesn't feel like there's those big people that are kind of like just going for it. I think getting the big TradFi market makers out probably paves some room for them to develop.
00:52:23.640 - 00:52:35.640, Speaker B: I was about to say I think there's huge market opportunity right now to be that crypto native market maker that doesn't exist in the same way that Alameda three AC used to exist.
00:52:37.660 - 00:52:39.450, Speaker D: Maybe not Alameda, but.
00:52:41.820 - 00:52:45.800, Speaker B: I'm not talking about committing fraud. I'm just talking about making markets.
00:52:46.300 - 00:52:48.910, Speaker D: I mean, it's literally just winter mute at this point.
00:52:50.000 - 00:53:22.184, Speaker C: Yeah, if you want to nerd out there are some upstart market makers out there. I don't know how public they are, but there are different models for market making. It's like. My understanding is you kind of either market maker like Bitcoin and ETH, and that's a much more traditional model, or you kind of have this token call option model of market making where you're given some percentage of arbitram. Per se. And you want to make a market on that at a certain price, and your allocation kind of ends up being something like that.
00:53:22.222 - 00:53:25.528, Speaker A: Isn't that a model that eventually goes away? Like that's kind of like an early.
00:53:25.614 - 00:53:32.650, Speaker C: Yes, I think so too. Yeah, that's not like a real scalable. No, I agree with that.
00:53:34.140 - 00:53:35.396, Speaker A: Should we wrap?
00:53:35.588 - 00:53:37.990, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we got to wrap. All right, guys.
