00:00:00.170 - 00:00:23.914, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co hosts today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:23.962 - 00:00:32.934, Speaker B: Alright, everyone, this episode brought to you by our friends at Avalanche. They're the layer one blockchain that is fast, stable, and scalable. You're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. For now, let's get into it.
00:00:32.972 - 00:01:08.850, Speaker C: What I see Visa doing is using this very stripped down, very fast, very decentralized blockchain, and slowly kind of building on things like, okay, here's chargeback protection here's, fraud protection here's, reversibility here's. All of these things that would be in a typical payments network, and they're just slowly going to just port all of these concepts onto blockchain rails. But right now, blockchain rails are just like very dumb payments networks. You send something, you can't get it back, you send something to a wrong address, it's gone forever. There is no concept of fraud. That's why credit card processors have such a hard time interacting with crypto. But I think this is going to actually bridge that gap.
00:01:10.870 - 00:01:29.398, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to what I think is the last roundup of the year on Bell Curve. We got Michael, who is gallivanting around Europe, I think possibly right now, and so is not able to make it, but thankfully, we have the better Mike joining us, calling in from negative 40 degree bozeman. I'm allowed to roast him if he's gone.
00:01:29.484 - 00:01:30.586, Speaker C: Yeah, you're allowed to roast him.
00:01:30.608 - 00:01:37.820, Speaker A: Just like I'm allowed to roast Vance's skater hair from 90 skater hair that he's got going on right now.
00:01:38.270 - 00:01:40.054, Speaker B: Drop in some clothes, some sweet lettuce.
00:01:40.102 - 00:01:44.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, Michael's hair is absurd right now, so I'm not the one you're looking for.
00:01:46.850 - 00:01:47.550, Speaker A: Fair enough.
00:01:47.620 - 00:01:50.094, Speaker C: But this isn't the last episode either. We're doing the predictions app.
00:01:50.132 - 00:01:50.842, Speaker B: We're doing predictions.
00:01:50.906 - 00:02:16.274, Speaker A: We have predictions. We have the predictions app. But I think the last roundup of the week, of the year, we do have the predictions up next week. All right, guys, there are a couple of thoughts I had for the roundup this week, and I know Vance, we don't have you for too long here. One was visa's news. The next is Yuga Labs hired? I think it's like the CEO or the COO of Activision. And then the third was some stuff going on with DCG.
00:02:16.274 - 00:02:20.794, Speaker A: So, Vance, in your mind, what was the big news of the mean other.
00:02:20.832 - 00:03:01.240, Speaker C: Than those I spent last night reading and not because I had to, more because I thought it was just like, really interesting, the CFTC, SEC and SDNY complaints against the I mean, it's always interesting to look back and see how it really worked. And what struck me is not only how early the fraud started, but they didn't just blow $10 billion. They probably blew close to 20 billion. Like 10 billion was the whole they probably made a couple of billion market making. They probably made a couple of billion on Seoul, at least. Probably more than that. Probably like ten.
00:03:01.240 - 00:03:12.698, Speaker C: This was not just a massive fraud, but these people are just idiots. They just lost so much money. It's mechanically hard to do. But I thought the complaints were really interesting.
00:03:12.784 - 00:03:18.438, Speaker B: Did you think it was interesting that Gary and Caroline flipped, which is the news that came out yesterday?
00:03:18.534 - 00:03:56.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, reading into the details of it, you see all these massive loans they took. The biggest loan that Gary Wang took was $200,000. And so you kind of wonder, what was the interpersonal dynamics of the whole situation? And Gary, I'm sure he knew what he was doing was wrong, but he didn't seem like he was in it for the power, the money, the prestige, in the same way that SBF was. But in the complaint, you can kind of stitch together how it worked. Gary altered the code and led that know, Caroline was kind of the money woman. She took the money, she received it, she knew where it came from, she spent it. And SBF was kind, know, puppeteering the whole thing.
00:03:56.774 - 00:04:23.300, Speaker C: And you kind of get this interesting tapestry of the interpersonal dynamics of SBF and Caroline, who were maybe dating, and SBF and Gary Wang, and he was probably very domineering over him. And the open questions are, where's Nashad? Where's Tribuco? But I think those are forthcoming. That was the big thing about the SDNY announcement. Damien Williams said we're not done. We're coming after more people.
00:04:24.630 - 00:04:52.406, Speaker B: Where is Tabasco? Where is that guy? He was all over the place. There's a tweet that's held up just so unbelievably poorly, which is when he stepped down. He's like, why do journalists feel the need to ascribe anything other than the need to go over water quickly? Why are you basically reading into me stepping down and one month later, this entire fraud gets uncovered? So not looking so good in retrospect.
00:04:52.438 - 00:05:18.260, Speaker C: There, but it looks like Caroline will not be prosecuted for any of the crimes related to FTX. The tax stuff is different. The SEC civil complaint is different. So is the CFTC. It looks like she's going to have to discourage any profits that were made, and the government gets to calculate that. So that could be a very large number, potentially, that she doesn't have access to. But it doesn't look like she's going to actually do any jail time, which I thought was pretty interesting.
00:05:19.590 - 00:06:07.486, Speaker B: What do you think? And last thing on this entire situation, because we're putting this in our rear view for 2022, but what did you think about this? There were talks about Clawbacks, right? So there was an announcement that John Ray was going to be seeking clawbacks. Basically, from the political donations that SBF made, I think it was basically ring fenced around that particular set of donations. But SBF, we kind of keep getting more and more details about the money that he spread around crypto and the people that he either gave loans to or paid people off with or whatever. And I think the big question is, what are those clawbacks going to happen? Who are the clawbacks going to apply to? What's the time frame that the clawbacks are going to be applied on? So do you have any thoughts I don't know if you saw that article, but do you have any thoughts on the clawbacks?
00:06:07.598 - 00:06:43.360, Speaker C: I mean, it's going to be a battle to get the money back. If SBF gave the money to somebody who spent it on somebody who spent it on something, do you get to go after the third derivative of the person who took SBF's money? I don't think so. And so I think it's going to be a negotiation where know, give us the money or we're going to sue you. And if we sue you, it's going to cost a set amount of legal fees. And so the incentives are skewed to settle, basically. But I don't think all that money is coming back. I think a lot of it is just kind of gone at this point.
00:06:43.360 - 00:06:53.406, Speaker C: But yeah, wrecked. The photos of him going to the airport are also just brutal. The Fox Hill diet. He actually looked pretty good.
00:06:53.588 - 00:06:55.246, Speaker A: I actually thought he looked good, too.
00:06:55.428 - 00:07:01.666, Speaker C: Yeah, he looked better than not being amphetamines and like, eating real food is actually good for you.
00:07:01.768 - 00:07:04.722, Speaker A: Yeah, that's so true. He actually does look healthier than I've seen him in years.
00:07:04.776 - 00:07:06.340, Speaker B: Looks way healthier. Yeah.
00:07:06.790 - 00:07:14.102, Speaker C: The worst that we have ever seen him was at that Bahamas conference when he had the longer hair and he was really kind of like bigger with.
00:07:14.156 - 00:07:16.710, Speaker A: He was trying to convince Bill Clinton to come on board. Yeah.
00:07:16.860 - 00:07:41.002, Speaker B: I'm sorry, that is not the worst time. The worst time was that video that got produced. Do you guys remember this video that he's fake sleeping? Yeah. So I in my head up till that. Do you remember the picture that you had for a long time was him, like, when he just entered into crypto and he was kind of this skinny guy with this big wiry hair, and then suddenly you kind of looked at him in this video. It's like, dude, I thought you were a vegan. I thought you were vegan, brother.
00:07:41.066 - 00:08:11.210, Speaker A: What's going on? I want to talk about Visa, actually. So Visa basically proposed. It was Catherine Goo, I think, who lead is like, either I think she's on the crypto infrastructure team at Visa. She was previously at Morgan and Anchorage and Gauntlet. She's pretty crypto native, I'd call it. And she posted this thing, which is a big Visa announcement. Visa is now proposing to do automatic payments using StarkNet.
00:08:11.210 - 00:09:06.326, Speaker A: And I think their proposal, the way I understand it, is they want to set up these self custodial wallets where you could use an account abstraction method to set up automatic recurring payments on StarkNet. The way that ETH is set up right now does not support this. So if you think about just how the ETH network works today, you have two different types of accounts. You have EOAS, like externally owned accounts that are controlled by private keys, and then you have contract accounts which are essentially smart contracts. This introduces this, I think. I mean, Vance, you could correct me if I'm wrong here, but like a third type of account, which is an account abstraction, which I remember Vitalik writing about like several years ago. And this would basically combine user accounts and smart contracts into a single type of account, which then I think what you can do there is then you can start running automatic payments through the use of smart contracts.
00:09:06.326 - 00:09:34.242, Speaker A: It is similar to what was the proposal. I think it was EIP 1337 that allowed for subscriptions on Ethereum. So it seems maybe similar to that. I don't know. I just thought it was really cool that Visas, they're working with the Argent wallet, they're pushing this self custody narrative and use case. They're working with StarkNet and L2 S. I don't know, I just thought it was really cool to see Visa pushing into this.
00:09:34.376 - 00:10:17.754, Speaker C: It's a well defined market. It already has product market fit. This is a really good use of a blockchain and it's pushing on one of the key things that Ethereum doesn't have yet, which is account abstraction. And Vitalik has actually put out a piece of research which effectively on Ethel One, would allow for account abstraction by the creation of an alternate mem pool just for account abstraction transactions. And so this is one of the main things that, especially with things like payments and gaming, that is a feature that people absolutely need. And if you think about Starkware in a very concrete use case for this, you can do gasless transactions on Starkware. So if you're a game developer, you don't actually need to go and pay gas for every single transaction.
00:10:17.754 - 00:10:37.880, Speaker C: You can just abstract that away on the back end. Once that comes to ETH l One and the other L2 S, that is going to be a really big piece of adoption that pushes companies into this. So it's positive. I want to see the follow through, all of these corporate announcements. That's kind of always what I wonder is what's going to be the actual product that gets pushed out?
00:10:38.410 - 00:11:14.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's always what it comes down to. Also, this stuff just takes a really long time, right? Like JPMorgan started working on Quorum back in 2015 and they're now finally just I think they just did their first trade, a couple of months ago on polygon, right? That trade that we talked about? Yeah. I don't know. I'm torn on this like on one hand I can see this world where, okay, you open your Visa app, it feels like this normal app with no seed phrase, just like your biometric. It's got an account abstraction wallet on the back end. You can make USDC payments to merchants or to apps. Instant settlement to merchants, no bank fees, non custodial mass adoption is here.
00:11:14.754 - 00:11:45.194, Speaker A: Boom. Super exciting. On the other hand, you've got like it's Visa, right? Visa is not our friend. They have a business model that is kind of rent seeking on behalf of banks who in exchange defend Visa from competition. It's like kind of I don't know, just like they just force businesses to collect fee. They just collect fees from everyone and have this business model that forces businesses to do this, right. It's like a sales tax that ends up getting paid to bankers by moving a few numbers over the Internet.
00:11:45.194 - 00:11:52.766, Speaker A: So that is their business model today. So on one hand, I'm like, I don't know, I'm torn between that and I'm curious to get your take.
00:11:52.948 - 00:12:40.174, Speaker B: Well, we made the comparison to these things taken. I feel differently about this news from Visa than I did for Quorum with Morgan because this makes a lot of sense to me, this Visa announcement, because the core business of Visa is basically batching and processing large groups of payments. And I think they've taken a look at Starkware and said, hey, this is a step function improvement in technology that helps my core business. I basically just think they've identified a use case that makes a lot more sense. Whereas I always kind of looked at Morgan and thought, this is a little bit of innovation theater. No offense, maybe I'm totally missing something, but there's kind of JPM Coin and there's all this sort of nebulous enterprise blockchain stuff that at least my personal opinion. I'm happy to be proven wrong here, but I've never really looked at it as making a lot of intuitive sense.
00:12:40.174 - 00:13:19.690, Speaker B: This Visa seems like a bit of a different announcement to also, I don't know, I would push back a little bit on it's the bankers and they're doing evil stuff. I don't know. At a certain point these are companies that perform services. And I think one thing that like jason, you and I have talked a little bit recently about public goods. There are a lot of people that are basically saying there are these blockchains and they're going to be public goods and they're not going to need to extract fees or value from the services that they're providing. And I would kind of gently push back on that and say, we're in the very early stage of a lot of these companies and networks and they can get by. For now, the expectation is not necessarily that they extract rent or value but ultimately blockchains are going to have to figure out a way to do that.
00:13:19.690 - 00:13:23.726, Speaker B: So I would kind of generally push back on that particular point of view.
00:13:23.908 - 00:13:42.994, Speaker A: I guess my pushback there was like, what this is in my mind is centralized crypto with your name stamped on each transaction, which kind of, I don't know, does defeat the purpose, a little bit of Visa sitting in between these transactions. I don't know. I might be honestly misunderstanding what they're building too.
00:13:43.032 - 00:14:25.718, Speaker C: But one way to kind of think about this is if you think about a payments network and you think about blockchains in parallel, blockchains are like a very stripped down version of a proper payments network that these people run. And so what is a payments network? Obviously, it's the ability to send money. It's things like fraud protection. It's things like being able to reverse transactions. It's things like compliance. And what I see Visa doing is using this very stripped down, very fast, very decentralized blockchain and slowly kind of building on things like, okay, here's chargeback protection here's, fraud protection here's, reversibility here's. All of these things that would be in a typical payments network, and they're just slowly going to just port all of these concepts onto blockchain rails.
00:14:25.718 - 00:14:49.446, Speaker C: But right now, blockchain rails are just like very dumb payments networks. You send something, you can't get it back. You send something to a wrong address, it's gone forever. There is no concept of fraud. That's why credit card processors have such a hard time interacting with crypto. But I think this is going to actually bridge that gap if it gets off the ground. The problem with these things is you always move at the pace of the slowest executive involved with the project.
00:14:49.446 - 00:14:57.786, Speaker C: And so you just got to get those people excited and keep those people at the company for long enough where it actually plays out.
00:14:57.968 - 00:15:42.442, Speaker B: I think the other challenge, in addition to just like, getting the last executive on the train, is that there might this is the classic Clay Christensen disruption and why it doesn't necessarily happen from incumbents. Because to your point about blockchains being dumb payment rails, they're also very cheap payment rails when they start to operate at scale. And Visa kind of looks at its core business and they charge whatever they charge two and a half, 3%, or whatever it is on transactions to merchants. Someone, some finance guy, probably a CFO or finance, is saying, hey, that two and a half percent makes up an enormous part of our core business. This is cannibalizing. And I'm sure there's another part of Visa which is saying, hey, this is the way the world is moving. And then there's someone that's trying to defend the core business.
00:15:42.442 - 00:15:45.866, Speaker B: And that's ultimately the tension that incumbents struggle with.
00:15:45.968 - 00:16:19.342, Speaker C: I think last thing I'll say is, if people are interested, go look at the financials of Mastercard and Visa. They're very interesting. They're not high growth businesses at this point, but they're 65% margin businesses. So really healthy free cash flow, they're each valued around like 300, 400 billion. And they're not anywhere near as profitable as something like Ethereum, but they do pay dividends. And it's a very interesting comp in terms of where these big L1 blockchains could go. Ethereum right now is about a third of the price of either of those stocks.
00:16:19.406 - 00:16:52.986, Speaker B: On the theme of being sort of positive and optimistic going into year is and Jason, maybe you and I feel this a little bit more even than others, just because we're involved in media and have a newsroom. But if you were to look at the announcements that were kind of coming out during the bull run and be like, oh, the price is going up because of XYZ announcement, NYDIG has another big partnership with a bank or know, another El Salvador just bought Bitcoin or whatever. Some of the news that's coming out during the bear market that gets absolutely no play is very significant. Like, this is a huge announcement, in my opinion.
00:16:53.098 - 00:16:56.980, Speaker A: I also think ETH would have sent ETH up 30% in the last bull market.
00:16:58.710 - 00:17:24.170, Speaker B: I know I got some shade on this podcast for saying this, but Fidelity doing what they're doing, making at least like Bitcoin and ETH and custody accessible to a more institutional audience. I think it's a massive I think it's a massive deal. So there are these small, incremental, but very meaningful bits of adoption that are happening right now that people aren't paying attention to because, frankly, the price isn't going up, but progress is still being think. It's very, very optimistic.
00:17:25.070 - 00:17:57.718, Speaker A: Vince, do you think that this made me think about NFT payment models? Excuse me? NFT business models. Like, right now the NFT business model is bad. There's a bad business model around NFTs, which is why the conversation about royalties is such a big topic in the NFT community. It's because the original NFT model of like, one time drop and then royalties people saw it as bad model. Do you think this moves NFTs to subscriptions? Do you think the new model of NFTs in the next cycle will end.
00:17:57.724 - 00:18:03.190, Speaker C: Up being more subscription based versus percentage of royalties based?
00:18:03.340 - 00:18:43.202, Speaker A: Right now, let's say I own an NFT, but I don't ever sell it. That doesn't drive any value for the network and that doesn't drive any value for anyone. Okay, so permies, if you own a permi right now, you get access to blockworks research. We charge $2,500 a year for blockworks research. But if you own a permi, you get access to blockworks research for free. It would be nice to be able to have an NFT or like, permes if they wanted access to blockworks research, maybe there's like a $50 charge a year or something like that. I'm not saying this for permi specifically, but there's a missing link in the current model.
00:18:43.202 - 00:18:45.460, Speaker A: I feel like and maybe subscriptions are it.
00:18:46.950 - 00:19:07.980, Speaker C: I think it's going to be all of the above. There's going to be some that are subscriptions this winter. I've been looking at a lot of art blocks. I'm not like a super fancy art collector, but I really do like those. And I like the idea that the artists get paid and that feels like it has product market fit with me. Things like D Gods feel like they have product market fit with the Salana people. Punks obviously have that.
00:19:07.980 - 00:19:30.546, Speaker C: I kind of see it being a lot of different things, but I think the most impactful exponential growth will be the ones that have 2% goes back to the treasury, is spent on something to develop the project. That's the only real huge upside model with NFTs. Not that they can't replace subscriptions. I just don't think it's like ten times better than what exists right now.
00:19:30.568 - 00:19:56.790, Speaker B: All right, everyone, quick break from this episode to talk about our show sponsors, Avalanche. Many of you know Avalanche as the fast, reliable and scalable layer one. The folks at Avalanche have a really great message for those of you who are in the crypto industry right now, which is bear markets are for building. So while a bunch of our friends over in CFI are kind of going through these struggles and travails, the folks at Avalanche have basically put their heads down and are shipping products that builders want. The latest solution. Elastic subnets.
00:19:56.870 - 00:20:09.134, Speaker A: Right. And just to expand on that, avalanche is consistently upgrading all of their platforms. Right? So on the platform side, you've got Elastic Subnets, you've got new VMs. On the infrastructure side of things you've got Core, which Mike, I know you used that the other day.
00:20:09.172 - 00:20:10.026, Speaker B: I was a bridger.
00:20:10.138 - 00:20:11.178, Speaker C: I was a bridgeor.
00:20:11.274 - 00:20:25.142, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So they're upgrading the infrastructure side with Core and enclave. The chain has had like no downtime super customizable for devs. Yeah, if you're a builder. AVAX network. AVAX network, great place to be.
00:20:25.236 - 00:20:29.394, Speaker B: But do Yano and I as well. So definitely go check them out. But click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:20:29.442 - 00:20:30.280, Speaker A: Click the link.
00:20:31.370 - 00:20:33.174, Speaker B: Come on. Click the link at the bottom.
00:20:33.292 - 00:20:41.270, Speaker A: Give us the credit. Exactly. So yeah, big thanks to mean you just had a great experience with them the other day on the user side of things.
00:20:41.420 - 00:20:42.258, Speaker B: Go check them out.
00:20:42.284 - 00:20:42.522, Speaker A: Guys.
00:20:42.576 - 00:20:44.362, Speaker B: Thank us later. Let's get back to the show.
00:20:44.416 - 00:21:14.434, Speaker A: Let's move past Visa stuff. Exciting announcement. We'll keep eyes on that. The next one is I don't know if there's anything you guys want to go over, but I thought Barry tweeting out the article. I don't know if you guys saw this, but so basically backstory Grayscale, subsidiary of DCG, they've been obviously pursuing this conversation of their closed end, turning their closed end fund GBTC into a bitcoin spot ETF over the past like two years. Keeps getting denied by the SEC. Barry's been pretty quiet about this.
00:21:14.434 - 00:22:02.338, Speaker A: Recently, he tweeted out a Wall Street Journal article along with the caption, if Grayscale's bitcoin ETF dreams fail, firm may try a tender offer. So I don't know if you guys have seen that, but you should pull it up. The option here, I think, includes a tender offer for up to 20% of the outstanding shares. And the trust is like, I think, roughly $10 billion right now. This would be like a direct appeal to shareholders to sell their shares at a specific price during a specific time frame. And I think this led to a lot of confusion among folks, at least what I saw on Twitter, because DCG would need a pretty significant amount of cash to repurchase shares that are currently trading at like a 40 or 50% discount to NAV. So I'm just curious what you think of this.
00:22:02.424 - 00:22:42.506, Speaker C: The high level of the whole situation is rumors that the whole is like 2 billion or something, or DCG owes Genesis about that amount. And so this would be a 20% tender offer on a $10.7 billion trust, or call it 10 billion today. And so that's a $2 billion offer. And then they would buy that at some sort of discount to spot GBTC spot. They would then need to go get approval from the SEC to do this. And I think they would need that approval because they would then take that GBTC, get a special approval from the SEC, convert it into bitcoin, sell the bitcoin and kind of net the profits.
00:22:42.506 - 00:23:12.810, Speaker C: And if you cover the hole for Genesis, this is what I was thinking at least. It's like 50% discount, 2 billion tender offer, you make 2 billion in profit. That roughly is like the same puzzle piece as the hole that's missing. So maybe that's what's going on. But it's good to hear that there's a plan. The other stuff that I saw this week is like Gemini Earn and know, talking with Hula hand Loki to get them some sort of plan. It feels like it's getting better, at least more transparent.
00:23:12.810 - 00:23:17.034, Speaker C: And this feels like at least part of the strategy to bolster everything feel.
00:23:17.072 - 00:24:04.698, Speaker B: Like just at a high level, GBTC is basically the crown jewel, the enormous amount of basically bitcoin that they have locked up in there and the fees that's going to generate on a revenue basis. And there was a hedge fund fur tree that sued Grayscale and talked about it pretty publicly. They said they're very unhappy about the enormous discount that GBTC is trading at. And I think the tender offer is kind of it fixes like a bunch of things. It's a way to get liquidity back to some of the shareholders that aren't super happy about having their bitcoin essentially trapped in GBTC, the structure. And you're also raising some money from, like Vance said, for DCG to basically fill the gap on Genesis. And if you also go and look, there's there were rumors about this, right? This was reported on a couple weeks ago that Barry might be trying to sell CoinDesk as well.
00:24:04.698 - 00:24:24.366, Speaker B: And I think basically what he's trying to do is just prioritize within his Fiefdom what are the revenue streams and businesses that he cares about and he's got to get enough liquidity to basically make Genesis whole and then I assume he's got to shut that down. I can't imagine ever wanting to be in that business ever again. It's got to be been pretty traumatic for him, to be honest.
00:24:24.468 - 00:24:58.346, Speaker C: In a weird way. There's a perverse incentive for him to just drag this out because if everyone sells their GBTC and it's trading at like ten cents or ten percent on the NAV of the bitcoin, you just buy that up and then wind the trust up and you profit ten x the difference. This is just such a dumpster fire, this product. I really hope an ETF gets approved, not because I want the industry to benefit from that, obviously, but this is just such a bad look and then such a rolling disaster, like it's not going to get better in the next two years, probably at least.
00:24:58.528 - 00:25:08.522, Speaker B: No. Do you think? Just out of curiosity, Vance, is this mechanically, if there's this tender offer and that ends up getting executed, does this mean there's going to be some sell pressure on bitcoin?
00:25:08.586 - 00:25:35.960, Speaker C: I mean, that's the other thing that's probably worth talking about. You got Mount Gox, which is an insolvent bitcoin exchange from the early 2010 oughts, and they're distributing all the bitcoin that they got and that's I believe around three or 4 billion that'll happen in January. You're going to have maybe this happening in January, February. You've got Core Scientific that just filed for bankruptcy yesterday. I don't want to rag on bitcoin too much, but it's just like a lot of things that are going wrong. Right?
00:25:39.050 - 00:26:41.406, Speaker B: The look, this whole DCG thing is still being solved and there's some probably like short to midterm sell pressure, but there are basically, I think, three threats, sort of damocles type things that are hanging over the market that could really impact price, which is sort of this DCG Genesis situation. There's Tether potentially, and Binance and frankly, I don't know, those are, in my opinion, the three threats that could probably send the market lower from here. And I don't know, I kind of think every day one of those things doesn't happen, it's looking mildly better. I do know that now there was a deadline that was passed for Gemini Earn creditors, essentially, where they can file for suit. They're now I think the Genesis loan know ultimately your counterparty is Genesis for the Gemini Earn customers so you can file suit against them. So I think some important date was passed, but basically every day I think that something drastic doesn't happen is probably good, probably a relatively good sign. I don't know.
00:26:41.428 - 00:26:41.658, Speaker A: There's.
00:26:41.674 - 00:26:43.200, Speaker B: Always someone else who can sell.
00:26:44.210 - 00:27:19.526, Speaker C: June to November july august september October, November 5 months. These things have like, a lag. Someone fails, everyone pretends they're okay, someone else fails. And so it's kind of like one interpretation is every day that doesn't happen, it gets better. And the other one is like, every day that the earthquake doesn't happen, just like, more pressure builds up when it eventually does unleash. So I don't think any of these other ones are going to go insolvent, but I think it's more of a time thing. By the end of Q One, we'll have all of this stuff behind us.
00:27:19.526 - 00:27:23.340, Speaker C: I think we're going to be dealing with it for the foreseeable future at least.
00:27:24.910 - 00:27:52.370, Speaker B: I do think the point taken. There definitely is a lag. But also, these big blow ups tend to happen at the very bottom of markets, not like at the beginning. The bottom is almost always marked by some enormous explosion, and then it makes everyone extremely nervous. And just maybe it was because we were going to do our predictions episode today. Now we're doing it next week. I was looking at some of the predictions that I made last year at the very top of the bull market.
00:27:52.370 - 00:27:57.540, Speaker B: It was painful for me to read what I thought was going to happen. Some of these predictions, it was like.
00:27:57.910 - 00:27:59.646, Speaker C: I don't even metaverse stuff.
00:27:59.768 - 00:28:18.566, Speaker B: I don't want to talk about it. I'll probably have to just yeah, actually, the one prediction that I got, I was like one for ten. The one prediction that got right was consolidation in exchange land. Didn't know why. That was like, the one thing that ended up being correct for consolidation. Yeah, it was all this stuff. I mean, it was like, go back rewind to like, November.
00:28:18.758 - 00:28:20.890, Speaker A: Dow buying a sports team did not come true.
00:28:20.960 - 00:28:41.214, Speaker B: Dow buying a sports team. Yeah, it didn't come true. Yeah, we're taking risks. All right, on these predictions. I'm not here to make safe predictions, but yeah, point taken. Not great, but I think the reason is because I was extrapolating what was happening. And when we talk about predictions next week, I think the temptation is to continue to extend these bear market negative sort of predictions.
00:28:41.214 - 00:28:57.478, Speaker B: But probably I don't know. My working thesis right now is the worst of it is behind us, and there's probably some period of apathy that we have to work through here before some sort of return to positivity. But I have predictions on the theme of Positivity, I would say there was.
00:28:57.484 - 00:29:00.662, Speaker A: A coinbase survey they sent out. I don't know. I tweeted about this.
00:29:00.716 - 00:29:01.286, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:29:01.388 - 00:29:05.290, Speaker A: Only 8% of investors believe that crypto is going to go higher next year.
00:29:05.440 - 00:29:07.786, Speaker C: That was pre FTX when that survey happened.
00:29:07.888 - 00:29:10.780, Speaker A: Yeah. From October of 2022. Yeah.
00:29:11.230 - 00:29:14.170, Speaker C: Well, take a look at things are worse.
00:29:18.130 - 00:30:00.380, Speaker B: Take a look at go back to it took basically the peak in 2017 was it was like november or December of 2017, then look at where you were one year after that and look at what happened price, action wise. Basically, people forget that during a bear market, the price of bitcoin at least tripled. And just to give you a sense of how bad sentiment was back then, the price of bitcoin and crypto market cap overhaul tripled and nobody talked. There was no talk about a bull market returning. It was just like, yeah, it's going to go back down again. So I almost feel like we're reaching that level of sentiment where even sustained price increases wouldn't convince people that things are going to be better. But that's what I've kind of been waiting for, to be honest.
00:30:00.380 - 00:30:02.854, Speaker B: What do you think about that, Vance.
00:30:02.902 - 00:30:32.822, Speaker C: As our perpetual optimist mean, I've been in much worse situations than this, so I'm not really too nervous. It's just like a waiting thing. And my motto is always, like, give it a year. If things are bad, just give it a year. Like, things will be better next year. I do think there's a lot of data on stock markets over the past 200 years of if you have a really bad year, the chances you have a double digit year the next year after that are generally like 75, 80%, pretty good. So that's kind of what I bias on.
00:30:32.822 - 00:30:43.898, Speaker C: And I'm just aware that it's going to take a while, but I don't have anything else better to do, honestly, than do this. So this is kind of what I'm, you know, I love this, so I'm going to be here.
00:30:44.064 - 00:31:11.220, Speaker A: This is a story that I bet you didn't even see or didn't even follow, but Yuga Labs named the former Activision Blizzard president as their new CEO. So I don't know. I know you don't follow the NFT stuff as closely, but Activision Blizzard, right? They're the gaming powerhouse, right? They own Call of Duty. They own World of Warcraft. They own Candy Crush. They own one of the greatest games of all time, tony Hawk Pro Skater. One and two.
00:31:11.220 - 00:31:16.740, Speaker A: So this feels like such a good game. Phenomenal. One of the best.
00:31:19.030 - 00:31:21.746, Speaker B: It's been all downhill since Tony Hawk pro skater.
00:31:21.938 - 00:31:22.562, Speaker A: Honestly.
00:31:22.626 - 00:31:23.238, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:31:23.324 - 00:31:24.230, Speaker A: Bring me back.
00:31:24.380 - 00:31:25.606, Speaker B: I remember playing that.
00:31:25.708 - 00:31:27.334, Speaker A: What was the really good snowboarding game?
00:31:27.372 - 00:31:33.450, Speaker B: Oh my God. Han it was 1080. It was 1080. That was phenomenal.
00:31:33.950 - 00:32:09.670, Speaker A: So good. SSX tricky. Also good. Anyways, I love this move because I think one of the mistakes that crypto companies make is they don't bring in leadership for folks who know how to actually scale. Because I think there's this idea in crypto that, oh, we're going up against we're trying to build something really different, which is true. We're trying to build something really different. And we're not going to really bring in any adults into the room because the adults are who we're going up against here.
00:32:09.670 - 00:32:39.006, Speaker A: And if you actually look at some of the lending companies. I heard one of the biggest mistakes that they made that the board of some of these lend and borrow platforms that ended up blowing up. And just like CFI companies in general is the board would really push them to bring in the kind of gray haired folks into the room and they didn't do it right, and they kind of refused to do it, and look what happened there. So I really like this move of Yuga folks stepping aside and bringing in this guy Daniel Allegri to lead the company.
00:32:39.108 - 00:32:47.474, Speaker B: Yeah, so I agree with parts of that, which is, I think crypto under indexes on gray hair, basically, and I.
00:32:47.512 - 00:32:52.050, Speaker A: Think they're really bear market take. By the way, you only say these in a bear market.
00:32:52.200 - 00:33:52.098, Speaker B: Yeah, but no, I mean, come on. But how right did that turn out to be crypto oscillates between these two extremes of, hey, we really need some adults in the room and some gray hair and people with experience versus at the peak of bull markets, hey, none of these old boomers get it. And ultimately this is a new paradigm and anyone who isn't a native is going to be left behind. I think the truth is probably somewhere obviously in between those two things, but I think crypto overall under indexes on experience, and that's going to produce a couple amazing outcomes, but it's going to end in tears for a lot of other companies. So I think I like this move from that standpoint. Here's the thing that I'm struggling with mentally on NFTs, and even just okay, so this is the previous CEO of Activision. What are the lessons that you would have learned as the CEO of Activision? When I look at that company, they're basically in a relatively similar business to Disney in that the enterprise value that gets generated for that is in IP.
00:33:52.098 - 00:34:27.394, Speaker B: How do you generate really good IP? IP. Mark Dusk, always investing is a one man sport. He has a better way of saying it, but it's basically a one person thing with a vision. Same with directors, right? There's a reason why there's a director for a movie where it's one singular person's vision, and then you need to work with a whole bunch. You get other people's input, but you need one vision. And I would guess that it's very similar with games as well. And there's this sort of narrative, right? Especially you heard this around Yuga Labs and Board Ape and all this sort of stuff that you were going to crowdsource and somehow you were going to create more powerful content because you had the input of all these different people.
00:34:27.394 - 00:35:05.440, Speaker B: And that's frankly just not how I think content, really great content, and IP ends up getting created. I think you do need input from a lot of people, but you need one person with a vision. I think the business model for Board Apes, I think the playbook is sort of being written in real time, but it's not this like, how do I create the next Call of Duty that leverages crypto? I don't think that's skumorphic. I just don't think it's the right way of thinking about it. So my worry, right, the Bear case for bringing in the CEO of Activision is like they're going to bring in some incorrect mental models and frameworks for how to develop good IP in crypto land.
00:35:06.690 - 00:35:32.918, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good take. I do think that NFTs are getting away, though, from how do we crowdsource IP and build value bottoms up. To build this IP. I think folks are bringing in executives. Doodles did this too. They're bringing in real executives to run this and have that vision. I completely agree with you that it's a very SKU, morphic idea.
00:35:32.918 - 00:35:47.498, Speaker A: I mean, they clearly brought them in for Other Side, like the land platform of board Apes to basically figure out how to build Other Side into what I think would be their vision of this really expansive world. Not just a game, but like a whole world.
00:35:47.584 - 00:35:49.466, Speaker B: Yeah, because sandbox games are really difficult.
00:35:49.568 - 00:35:49.878, Speaker A: Who's?
00:35:49.894 - 00:36:11.918, Speaker B: The company that makes grand theft auto. GTA. I forget. But there's this unbelievable company that does that and the amount of time that it takes to do that world building. That's why there's an enormous amount of time that gets that happens in between each release. It's like Sandbox games. A Sandbox model as opposed to Call of Duty.
00:36:11.918 - 00:36:27.974, Speaker B: You go figure out a campaign and then a Sandbox model, you're sort of like Skyrim, and there's technically a campaign that you can do. But I used to play Oblivion a lot. I logged a lot of hours on Oblivion. I never played the campaign once through all these side quests and everything that you can do that made it so fun, I could sort of see other.
00:36:28.012 - 00:36:29.500, Speaker A: Side I did the same thing with.
00:36:31.470 - 00:36:57.620, Speaker B: So I don't know. I want to be supportive of. I feel like I come across as Bearish a lot of times on NFTs. I'm actually super bullish, especially where gaming intersects with NFTs. That has always made a colossal amount of sense to me. But I think it's on the onus of Labs to grow into a pretty large valuation at this point. So they've got a whole bunch of different parts of their business.
00:36:57.620 - 00:37:25.194, Speaker B: They raised money through a lot of different types of sales. There was kind of like board apes and mutant apes, and then there was other side, the land sale. Yeah. It's kind of unclear as to what, if you're an owner of any of those assets, what that really means. And then you have a huge valuation that got put on you there. And you need to find a way now to grow into the valuation that Yuga has. And I would love it if they do.
00:37:25.194 - 00:37:28.106, Speaker B: It's a daunting task, though. They've got their work laid out for them.
00:37:28.128 - 00:38:17.980, Speaker A: Well, one thing here, so one last thing and then we can move past this, is that I think their vision is that a singular game or a singular world will dominate all the other virtual worlds in terms of popularity and fun and utility. And that I think they also believe the future of gaming is through an integration with NFTs and things like that. And I think they also believe that you have to raise a boatload of money to go do this. So they check all those boxes, right? One of my qualms about that is with every other game in the world, you can kind of just go join the game and you can just jump in. But they as part of their fundraising technique, they launched land in the other side, right? And there's like a fixed supply of this land. So let's say I'm going to jump into a game with you or something like that. I don't need to own land to go do that.
00:38:17.980 - 00:38:22.682, Speaker A: But I think the way it works in other sides, you have to go own land to jump in.
00:38:22.736 - 00:39:10.966, Speaker B: Well, here's something I think just to leave the audience with something to think know, chris Dixon talks a lot about skumorphic ideas and you sort of have when you go from one medium to another. For example, before you had television, you had all these different things about how you were supposed to produce radio and you immediately tried to copy that over to TV and then you were like, wait a second, we have the use of film and cameras and we should be taking advantage of all this stuff. But it was skumorphic in that transition initially. The metaverse land is pretty interesting because I think you can make a really compelling argument where people are trying to create artificial scarcity on land. Like the reason land has value in the real world is buy real estate. They're not making any more of it, right? There's a very programmed in scarcity there and it actually produces real stuff. And you could say on metaverse land, well, that's a stupid artificial skumorphic constraint.
00:39:10.966 - 00:39:47.702, Speaker B: We should just create infinite, infinite land. But on the other hand, the way you price value is this marriage of supply and demand. If you have infinite supply, then nothing really has any value. And if we're approaching it from a gamer standpoint, if any people played games on this one cheat code in a game is actually kind of fun. If you play any game on infinite cheat codes, it automatically becomes unfun. You need some sense of purpose and achievement and adversity or whatever, even in gaming lands, right? It kind of mirrors that aspect of real life. So that's the one thing I've just never really been able to wrap my head around when it comes to metaverse land.
00:39:47.702 - 00:39:49.298, Speaker B: I don't have a strong enough opinion on it.
00:39:49.324 - 00:40:20.034, Speaker A: Here's what I'll say. There's three potential metaverse builders of the future. There's like the Facebook and Microsoft builders, there's the Fortnite and Minecraft builders, and then there's the crypto Rails builders and it's like Sandbox and folks like this. And I think right now it's on other side and on Ugalabs. It's theirs to win right now and it'll be interesting to see if they pull it off. What else happened this week?
00:40:20.072 - 00:40:50.890, Speaker B: Honestly, I think it was a relatively slow week. I think that's about mean we already talked a little bit. I mean the big story this week, right, was that we found out that Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison had flipped on SBF and that they were cooperating. This is just a personal preference at this point. I'm just so done talking about SBF going into I just really want to leave this behind in 2022 and what more is there to analyze? It was a colossal fraud. He's going to prison. I think that can be the end of this chapter.
00:40:51.470 - 00:41:35.290, Speaker A: I will say the last thing just on the NFT note, I got a demo of so Adam Brotman came on the Empire podcast to talk about like NFTs and Starbucks. And Adam Brockman, I think CEO or president of J. Crew. He also created the Starbucks Loyalty Rewards program, which is the most successful one in the world. And I got a demo of the Starbucks platform that they're rolling out and it completely red pilled me on NFTs as not as like completely changing the game, but just as a better loyalty program. Just a much more interesting extension of loyalty programs. And I think, I mean, this will end up being maybe one of my predictions for the next year.
00:41:35.290 - 00:41:56.740, Speaker A: Year after that is like every brand is going to end up launching NFTs. Every media brand. New York Times, Starbucks. Everyone's going to launch NFTs. It's not going to be anything crazy, but it is going to be an interesting extension of loyalty programs. So that was my takeaway from seeing behind the scenes of this platform.
00:41:58.950 - 00:42:31.322, Speaker B: I actually agree with you. Maybe you're sort of starting to red pill me on this as well. But this is something you can go this is where it's like there are no new ideas. In 2017, Marco Santori did a podcast on Unchained where he literally discussed exactly this and he was like, blockchains basically allow you to enable coupons, right? This is something that companies already do. Airlines already do it with miles. And weirdly, airline miles are like semifungible, they're kind of fungible. But the good thing about coupons in a Web Three sort of realm is that you can actually track them.
00:42:31.322 - 00:43:00.950, Speaker B: You can see real time who owns what. You can also see how long people have owned different things as well. So you can do these weird benefits where it's like, hey, if you hold on to coupon or NFT XY for some period of time, if you're Nike, you could get a special invite to this lounge with Michael Jordan. Or you could see how you would start to game those sorts of things. I think in terms of prediction, maybe I'd refine it to instead of everyone launches it, one or two brands launch it successfully. I would say it's going to be a bear market. I think predictions episode.
00:43:01.530 - 00:43:04.150, Speaker A: You got to wait for the actual predictions. Come on, now.
00:43:04.300 - 00:43:07.880, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. I don't know.
00:43:09.050 - 00:43:34.282, Speaker A: Here's what they'll call it. Here's a better branding here's a better branding on it than brand based. NFTs is experiential loyalty. That's what I would call this thing, is experiential loyalty. Yeah. Like current loyalty programs, if you think about them, they're not exciting, right? They're very transactional and entirely focused on spend. But I think the loyalty programs of the future, they incorporate digital ownership, like gamification storytelling.
00:43:34.282 - 00:43:38.798, Speaker A: And I'd bucket that as just experiential loyalty programs.
00:43:38.974 - 00:44:21.546, Speaker B: I've got another weird one that I actually thought about this week that I think would be sort of interesting. I have a friend I mean, he's your friend too, but I don't want to announce he worked at sort of an ecommerce type company. He was telling me this thing when they tried to give out coupons, right? They're basically like discounts. And if you think about as a company what you're doing when you issue a discount, like, hey, take $250 off, that's a liability that you're basically issuing to your customers. You're saying, hey, here's $250 that you're not going to have to spend on stuff that I spent money on. And it was this whole shit show because marketing didn't interface with finance. They didn't talk about who they were issuing these discounts to and how many of the discounts they offered.
00:44:21.546 - 00:45:04.510, Speaker B: So suddenly all these people, like way, way more people than they thought were started to redeem these coupons, and finance was like, guys, are you kidding me? This is crushing our numbers and our margin. We had no idea. It would actually be kind of interesting if there was some sort of chain where you could issue discounts that would apply blanket to different products, like at Blockworks, say, but then you could have a real time understanding of how much you issued and who owns those different discounts, and you could even have them expire at different times. So it could all just sort of be perfectly tracked. I don't know. As a person who thinks about that kind of stuff, I think it would be it's a small thing, but it's actually kind of a big thing. It's pretty cool.
00:45:04.510 - 00:45:23.982, Speaker B: I think that would be yeah. So I hope some ultimately is that what we're all really here for? No, but is it cool and is it a thing that people and companies might use? Yeah, I do think that it is. So I hope we make some of those improvements over the course of the next year. All right, budy. I guess it's been a week.
00:45:24.036 - 00:45:32.182, Speaker A: Thanks for listening folks. We will next week. Tune in next week. We're going to have a big predictions episode with Michael Vance, Mike and me. So it should be a fun one.
