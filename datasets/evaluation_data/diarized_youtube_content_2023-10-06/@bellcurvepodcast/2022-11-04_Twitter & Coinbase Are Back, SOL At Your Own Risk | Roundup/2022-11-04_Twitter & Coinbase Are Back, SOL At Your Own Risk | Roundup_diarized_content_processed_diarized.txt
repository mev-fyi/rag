00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.270, Speaker A: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:08.340 - 00:00:19.120, Speaker B: The biggest benefactor of this as Elon grows is Apple. Because every single subscription that he sells, apple is going to save 30%. Just as we were talking about last week.
00:00:21.250 - 00:00:36.258, Speaker C: Alright, guys, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one to Yano and Vance fellas. We got the quartet back together. It's nice. Been missing each other for a couple of weeks. The old gang back together. Yano.
00:00:36.258 - 00:00:37.750, Speaker C: How was Morocco, buddy?
00:00:38.090 - 00:00:43.926, Speaker A: I was going to say, I think you guys were all together. I was just kind of farting around in October.
00:00:44.038 - 00:00:45.386, Speaker C: That's not the same without you.
00:00:45.488 - 00:00:58.174, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I know. I missed you guys. I missed you guys. I would have dialed in from Morocco, but it doesn't seem like there's usable Wi Fi in Morocco as Mike witnessed about a month ago.
00:00:58.292 - 00:01:00.938, Speaker D: Need some helium hotspots out there, man. Seriously.
00:01:01.034 - 00:01:04.190, Speaker C: Really do need some people's network. Even the people's network.
00:01:04.270 - 00:01:08.738, Speaker A: Yeah, the people's network was not working in Morocco, that's for sure.
00:01:08.904 - 00:01:11.010, Speaker B: A lot of supply, not much demand.
00:01:11.510 - 00:01:12.260, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:12.950 - 00:01:35.862, Speaker C: All right. We actually got a bunch of stories this week, but I'd love to get all your takes on the topic. DuJour. On Twitter, the chief twit, Elon Musk himself is going to be charging $8 for the blue check. Been a lot of trolling on it. People are very divided. Right there's the Elon for free speech and this is taking away a status symbol and going to eliminate the spam.
00:01:35.862 - 00:01:43.998, Speaker C: And then this is just a billionaire coastal elite enriching himself. So where do you guys fall on the whole $8 for a blue check?
00:01:44.164 - 00:02:13.494, Speaker D: I love it. People are trying to charge us like 1020 grand for checks, so it's good to see the price come down pretty significantly. I like what Elon's doing. I don't think ad based business models are that sustainable or really comport with the idea of freedom of speech being kind of the most important thing to a platform like this. He's going to roll out vine. I loved vine when it was still alive. I think maybe not having all of our children, like, being brainwashed by CCP propaganda on TikTok is a good idea.
00:02:13.494 - 00:02:45.780, Speaker D: Maybe we should go away from that. I think fine is a great kind of counterbalance to that. I think kind of the most unique perspective I have on the whole Twitter thing is historically all of the alternative social networks have been these conservative social networks. So like Truther from Trump, you have parlor that was one and it's kind of like you guys won't let us rabble rouse on the Twitter platform, so we're going to go create our own. Now it's the opposite. All the lefties are like, we're going to go move to Canada. We're going to get off this platform.
00:02:45.780 - 00:03:13.898, Speaker D: An alternative social network that's left leaning just seems to me like it would be the lamest social platform that could really be existent. The Republicans want to go talk about guns and crazy shit and property rights and all that stuff. What would the left alternative version of parlor or Truth or look like? Probably pretty lame. So I don't really see these people anywhere going anywhere. I see them paying $8. I think it's going to be really funny when they do. So, yeah, really bullish on everything Elon is doing.
00:03:14.064 - 00:03:57.586, Speaker B: So here's some interesting numbers. There's about 350,000 blue check marks today. I think there's a fair proportion of that that gets cannibalized. So let's say like 300 actually shell up and pay. And then the other interesting stat is there are 37 million daily monetizable monthly active users. So basically people who are using Twitter every day just in the United States. So 37 million people who are in the United States using Twitter every day who have monetization potential, which you can kind of assume is a proxy for not a bot, right? How many of those people just in the United States do you think will pay for this? Maybe over the next six to twelve.
00:03:57.628 - 00:04:01.450, Speaker C: Months, I basically ran very similar numbers.
00:04:01.600 - 00:04:08.570, Speaker B: My guess is in the single digit millions, but over three and probably less than eight.
00:04:08.640 - 00:04:35.250, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking, is like about 5 million people or something like that. I was looking at the overall Twitter because I do think the one thing is like what Jason and I were both just in Morocco, and one stat that I took away from that was people there make like $250, $400 a year American. So I was like, oh yeah, well, no more in Morocco is going to be a blue check. That actually is not great. But in America, it's like the biggest no brainer right, for the American audience.
00:04:36.550 - 00:05:33.186, Speaker B: And he did say that it would be priced in local currency with proportional payment parity or payment purchase parity per country. There's going to be a lot of stuff that has to get figured out with that, I think, but you could assume whatever $8 is in Morocco, that would be the equivalent. The really interesting point here, and this is my kind of like hottest take on this, I actually think Twitter is not the biggest benefactor of this. Ultimately, let's say eventually you get to like two to $3 billion worth of basically just subscription revenue that Twitter is now generating. Maybe it's even more than that eventually. I actually think vine and all these new features, all these new capabilities, what Elon's going to do is kind of the same playbook as what Evan at Snap is running, or at least testing, which is instead of having an advertising based business model. Let's also try to just cram all of our best features products all into a bundle and sell it for a subscription fee and have the snapchat.
00:05:33.186 - 00:06:20.310, Speaker B: I can't remember what it's called at Snap, but it's like 299 a month. It's pretty cheap, but that's going to be the Amazon Prime equivalent of what basically these founders ultimately end up running. Because I agree with Vance. I think the philosophical approach of having a social network or some media property, whatever it may be, without advertising, is the direction that I think the world is moving, and for a number of reasons. But the best way to do that is to have a subscription service that you start bundling all these things into. And so when you release a new feature, when you release a new capability, when you have better targeting, tracking, better experiences, better content consumption, that goes to the Twitter Blue check marks first. But the biggest benefactor of this, as Elon grows, is Apple, because every single subscription that he sells, apple is going to take 30%.
00:06:20.310 - 00:06:44.400, Speaker B: Just as we were talking about last week. Wow, that was another update in the guidelines that Apple put out last week, which is that any sort of boost or post or promotional element, like you can pay to promote your tweet, you can pay to promote your post in TikTok, all of those now have to fall through Apple IAP as well. So it is going to be something that's super beneficial to Twitter, but Apple is going to take their 30%.
00:06:45.090 - 00:07:09.186, Speaker C: Dude, first of all, I love that take. God, Apple just they've been crushing it, haven't they? Remember there was a period of time where it's like, oh, it's Facebook or Meta, right? They didn't want to flex too much because it was the rising app, and they were like, who really has the power in this relationship that has been fully decided in Apple's favor? They were very advantageous about when they chose to strike, so to speak. So kind of like that take on Twitter, too.
00:07:09.368 - 00:07:39.470, Speaker A: You know, it's funny, if you think about Andreessen Horowitz's original thesis on crypto, if you think about what Chris Dixon would espouse in 2017, is that blockchains are just new computers. And what's different about blockchains versus old computers is that with old computers, hardware was more powerful than software, right? You kind of unplug the computer and the software goes away. But with blockchains, there are computers where software is now more powerful than hardware, where, well, you're seeing in 2022, hardware still reigns supreme.
00:07:40.770 - 00:08:51.218, Speaker B: I don't like to promote other podcasts on our podcast, but there's a great episode of Oddbots that just came out, talking all about the Apple moves, basically against Facebook or Meta. And Google google and Apple are in an antitrust lawsuit right now, essentially, which is a question as to whether or not Apple can continue to have and they pay twelve to $14 billion a year for this. But the default search be Chrome and default search be Google, is that something that Apple will still be able to have? Well, Facebook is calling out very vocally that there are other antitrust questions to your point, Anno, as to whether or not Apple can continue to exert its power by owning the hardware. The reason why Apple is able to say that this is potentially not true is because Google exists, because Android has whatever, 40 plus percent of market share, and Apple can say, hey, we're not a monopoly. We happen to have the best product. Oh, by the way, every single one of those daily monetizable users, or any sort of monetization of users in general from mobile devices comes from an iOS device versus Android. It's like a ten x difference in terms of monetization.
00:08:51.218 - 00:09:11.110, Speaker B: But Google exists, and they're free in the marketplace to continue to grow their share, and we're competitive with them in that respect. So it's an interesting they're kind of like fighting each other at different angels, but they're also collaborating at different angels, and it's just this weird different departments going to battle versus other departments who are in cahoots.
00:09:11.270 - 00:09:38.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. Rough numbers for Twitter just in terms of how big this Blue check system could be, depending on the level of assumption that you want to make and how conservative you want to be. Twitter did 5 billion in revenue last year. They lost their net income on that was like negative 220,000,000, depending on which is wild. Yeah, I mean, they're a money losers since they IPOed.
00:09:38.494 - 00:09:47.958, Speaker B: There's another rumor that was reported by Bloomberg that on Friday, tomorrow, half of the staff will be let go. So assume that about half of that cost structure goes away.
00:09:48.124 - 00:10:04.286, Speaker C: Yep. Well, all right. That's pretty what's you know what's so funny? We talked about this on the last show, right? Him walking in with a kitchen sink. He's like, throw it all out with a kitchen sink or whatever. That is just a different attitude and way to live, man. I don't even know how to interpret that action, but he is certainly built different.
00:10:04.468 - 00:10:10.858, Speaker D: I love it. Everyone needs some of that in their lives. Just like the burn it down, start over work from first principle.
00:10:10.954 - 00:10:11.646, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:11.828 - 00:10:31.638, Speaker A: So I have two thoughts on this. One is I fully agree with Michael that I think social media will end up moving towards subscription based, or at least Twitter will end up moving more towards a subscription based. You start throwing really good stuff at it, it's like, yeah, what percentage of that I forget the numbers you guys were throwing out, but what percentage of the users will pay for a Blue check? I don't know, 2% or something? 3%.
00:10:31.724 - 00:10:31.974, Speaker B: Great.
00:10:32.012 - 00:10:49.242, Speaker A: Now what percentage of people will pay for a much better DMing? Like DMs? And Twitter an absolute nightmare. Anytime I'm on DMs, I'm like. Let's move it to telegram. If it was much better DMs, maybe that gets another 3%. Boom. If you get, like, a vine like service, that's another 3%. No ads, that's another 3%.
00:10:49.242 - 00:10:57.422, Speaker A: And now you've got 15% of the total Twitter base paying for $5 a month or $8 a month. Then that's a really good business right there.
00:10:57.476 - 00:10:58.654, Speaker C: You get some stuff.
00:10:58.852 - 00:11:13.220, Speaker B: Think about what Amazon has done. At first it was free shipping. Then it was free shipping plus movies. Now it's free shipping plus movies, plus NFL Thursday night, which admittedly have been terrible games, but you get my point.
00:11:14.950 - 00:11:44.170, Speaker C: You know who originally did this business model and they don't get a lot of credit for it is actually costco. And they basically strive to break even on their entire business and they just have that $50 a year membership. And I kind of love their business model even more than Amazon because it's basically just like they have a huge warehouse. They just plonk a bunch of shit down on boxes and they're like, here you go, come pick it up. It's so simple and easy. Here's a fancy business for you. Lot of shit on the floor.
00:11:44.170 - 00:12:04.158, Speaker C: Come get it. And it's just like a phenomenal business if you start to back in. And let's say of those just US. Users, right, you want to take something relatively conservative and say you get like 5%. I know you said 2%. I would do this in a heartbeat. I've heard all these people be like, oh, it's prohibitively expensive.
00:12:04.158 - 00:12:09.698, Speaker C: This is nothing. For a blue check on Twitter, it's $8 a month. It's one coffee in New York.
00:12:09.784 - 00:12:22.722, Speaker A: Well, here's what we'll end up. Yeah, it's nothing. I think a large amount of people will do it. I would do it in a heartbeat. I think most of the people that I know would do it in a heartbeat. But I don't think maybe that we're the majority here. I think a lot of people might be skeptical.
00:12:22.722 - 00:12:50.062, Speaker A: What ends up happening that converts a lot of people is when they start changing the algorithm to promote the blue checks only, right? So like, if you have a blue check, you're going to show up in replies. If you don't have a blue check, you don't show up in replies. If you don't have a blue check, you have to pay to get your tweet promoted to get seen by more than 1% of your followers. If you have a blue check, maybe 10% of your followers to your tweet. So you'll end up having two factions of Twitter. You have like a blue check faction where their stuff gets seen. And it's almost like the anons and non ans.
00:12:50.126 - 00:13:04.166, Speaker C: Doesn't that already sort of exist to some degree, though? Like, you're the one with the blue check here, but when people reply to you, there's a blue check and a non blue check. And people usually the blue checks really only check the blue check part of it. So it's very rare to get response, right?
00:13:04.188 - 00:13:23.130, Speaker A: Didn't you say that people see my tweets because they are just better than yours usually? No, but there is like a little on my notifications, actually. I have like normal notifications and then I have notifications for only verified people. It's like the verified notifications center, which is pretty elitist.
00:13:23.290 - 00:13:24.990, Speaker C: It's elitist and it's classic.
00:13:27.490 - 00:13:44.558, Speaker A: Here's the last thing on Twitter, and then we can move into crypto stuff. I have a lot of friends. I know you guys. I think Vance, you worked at Netflix, maybe, and Michael, you worked at Dropbox and Snap. Like, I have friends at Facebook and Instagram and things like that. Their lives are cushy. Their lives are very cushy.
00:13:44.558 - 00:14:14.010, Speaker A: This is the end of that period in time of the last decade where you could kind of be like late 20s, early 30s, mid 30s, kind of getting a lot of money. You're working at a big tech company in San Francisco and making bank. You're making way more than your friends in investment banking who are grinding their asses off. And I think this is the stripe just laid off 14% big layoffs across the board everywhere. Twitter is obviously going to do big layoffs. And yeah, this is the end of that phase.
00:14:14.090 - 00:14:37.682, Speaker D: That's the open secret of Silicon Valley. These technology companies can be run with 30, 40% of the staff they have today and just be absolute cash cows. You kind of look at a lot of them right now, and they look like they're at the end of their own kind of technological history. Meta. And the metaverse we'll see if that's a growth avenue, potentially. Probably not. Snap doesn't have anything around the corner that's going to blow people away.
00:14:37.682 - 00:15:14.546, Speaker D: It's probably more of the same. More of the same is the prognosis for a lot of these tech companies. And I don't think that lends to an environment where you can run these huge costs and expect nobody to not throw up on it. So when risk appetites come back? I think the last point on this is all the hedge fund managers, all the guys that we talk to, a lot of them trading growth stocks. And what do you do when the economy going to be ripping or rates are going to be coming down, or you think the prognosis for a recession is strong and then you're going to get easing. What do you do? You just buy a bunch of growth stocks and you make a bunch of money and then you can go home. If that lever is no longer available, it's going to have to be something else.
00:15:14.546 - 00:15:32.374, Speaker D: They're probably going to go off and look more seriously at crypto. If that wave is noticeably crested and it's even today, like Nasdaq's down a bunch, s P is down a bunch, crypto is up. It's like you're starting to see these things that are know indicative as to where the next run goes.
00:15:32.492 - 00:16:04.254, Speaker C: Anecdotally I feel like crypto, I mean, we're just at the edge of risk assets. I feel like our downturn kind of just happened faster than the broader market. Like some friends of mine Blockware, we kind of went through this. We realized that demand was slowing back in May, and now a bunch of my friends and companies on consulting or banking or whatever, they're like, yeah, things are starting to slow down. Like, management is starting to talk, and I think it just is trickling through. And now everyone's feeling it, big tech included. We talked about it last week, but Meta got slammed.
00:16:04.254 - 00:16:08.340, Speaker C: Amazon got slammed. Yeah. I mean, everyone's feeling it, I think.
00:16:09.110 - 00:16:19.640, Speaker A: Except for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's coming out looking real good right now. Looking great. Per usual, guys. Look at he's flat on the year. Looking great.
00:16:20.090 - 00:16:26.360, Speaker D: I think he's literally still underperformed the S and P 500 over the past 30 years. Even with the performance this year.
00:16:28.650 - 00:16:37.258, Speaker A: I was looking at a chart of it was like, Meta, Navidea, Netflix, and Tesla. Everything's down, like, 45% to 75%. And Berkshire is, like, flat. Like Warren Buffett's looking pretty good.
00:16:37.344 - 00:17:34.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Last thing I'll say on this, I'm sure you guys have seen the TikTok videos of what is the day in the life of a product manager at Facebook or whatever. I'm not even sure that that is accurate. That is an actual person who works at that actual company. But I can absolutely attest that that is 100% accurate for what the lifestyles are like for many of the people that work at these businesses, lighting a fire under those companies. I mean, I really had a friend who works in private equity, and they focus on not large cap tech, but they have done some large cap stuff. And every year they kind of go through this process within their investment committee of like, what if we went off and did what Elon did and bought Twitter and cut half the staff and got the average revenue per employee back to equal par? What would that look like? The problem is going back to this from last week, governance.
00:17:34.250 - 00:18:12.422, Speaker B: And so one of the really interesting things is the companies that are going to outperform in this, I think, are going to be the ones that have a really fair check and balance on the governance model of those businesses, of those corporations. Because if you have 21 or ten to one or zero to one or one to zero voting, how are you going to be able to go in and make structured changes if that's not in line with what the CEO founder wants to do? And so it's going to be really interesting to look back in a year from now as we're seeing some of these positive changes at Twitter. Talking about what we talked about last week with governance, I do think that we're going to see a marked difference between how Twitter performs and how something like Meta performs.
00:18:12.486 - 00:18:50.230, Speaker C: I'd love to check in, actually, on just what's going on in the private market. So public market super visible, right? Obviously, public market indices taking a dive. Crypto tokens have taken a dive over the last six to nine months. I think we talked on the show a little bit about just how overheated Venture was in general. So maybe we could actually start just because we're talking about kind of big tech right now. If you want to talk about Venture generally, like what parts are still live and doing well and then what parts are struggling and then maybe we could move more specifically into private markets for crypto, but would love to just get your take on what's going on in the venture scene, like where valuations are at.
00:18:50.380 - 00:19:38.898, Speaker D: So what's happened the past few weeks is that the class of 2021 who raised in January, February, March of last year, when the Bull Run was really in its heavy part, have come back to market and are trying to raise its similar valuations. And people are just not there in terms of the demand. And they're starting to re rate everything downwards. And so we saw a project two days ago, can't mention who it was, but they were trying to raise like a 400 million dollar, fully diluted valuation, pre product, pre launch, pre everything. And those are just the things that are just no longer happening. And the higher side of that size of range kind of sets the tone for everything before it. And so we're probably in the midst of a 60, 70, 80% correction in the private markets, and that is setting the tone for everything.
00:19:38.898 - 00:20:10.750, Speaker D: Because when people ask you why you're not willing to pay, you can just point to a lot of the public comps and be like, listen, this is the outcome if you execute on everything. So it's certainly changing a lot, changing for the better. The different subsectors are kind of performing differently. There's still a lot of heat on things like Aptos FTX Alameda is kind of like setting the floor for projects there, but outside of that it's kind of a feast or famine market depending on if you have traction and metrics and revenue or if you don't.
00:20:11.650 - 00:21:01.790, Speaker B: The way I'd break it down is you kind of have like a two by two. You've got like crypto or Web Three, and then you've got crypto and Web two, and then you've got early stage, late stage. And we're obviously not ones who transact very frequently in things that are non crypto, but we have a lot of friends who do and we kind of keep our ear to the ground in terms of what's happening. The late stage Web Two side of the world is dead. No deals are getting done. And what I mean here is like series B plus and so usually at a multi hundred million dollar valuation and you're raising $50 to $200 million, a lot of those deals stopped being done basically a year ago. So to Vance's other point on the classes of different startups, you're going to have to see some of those businesses come back to market pretty soon.
00:21:01.790 - 00:22:02.210, Speaker B: And it's going to be really interesting because usually the way that this stuff plays out is you don't start off coming back to market and you say, okay, I'm going to just do a down round. It usually starts off as we need to raise more capital, but what I'm going to add to it is like structure to this new round. And what structure usually means, it's usually like liquidation, preferences, downside, protection, covenants in the actual agreement itself, that protect the investor or give the investor some guaranteed return, so that if the company doesn't make it to that valuation again or sells for something less, they get the money back. In some cases, they get the money back twice before anybody else gets anything. So these can be pretty restrictive. So you'll see structured rounds, but you won't actually tell that they're structured round because it'll just say, hey, we raise another X amount at our same valuation, the next laid to fall will be actual down rounds. And that's where it's like, we need capital and we're willing to take a 40, 50, 60% haircut on our valuation.
00:22:02.210 - 00:22:58.918, Speaker B: And we haven't really seen a lot of that yet. I would imagine that probably happens in the early half of the first half of next year as people really need capital and to survive, and they're willing to take the dilution. And so all of this is to say this is what's happening kind of across the board, but what happens on that later stage side is it eventually trickles down to what Vance is saying as well, is you can point to these things and be like, hey, look, they did a structured round, or like, hey, look, they actually did a down round. So when you're a Series A company and you raise your seat at 50 and you're like, well, I at least need a two X for my Series A, it's like, sorry, you're going to have to have a bridge Series A because this is actually worth 40, but we'll do it at 50. It's same valuation as last time, or there's a structured component to it. I think there's still a lot of pain on the horizon, I think. And frankly, a lot of this stuff hasn't trickled all the way down yet.
00:22:58.918 - 00:23:32.954, Speaker B: It has started to trickle in the later stages, but it hasn't gotten to the early stages yet. But there are still pretty reasonable deals getting done at the early stages. So at least there is flow of business and transactions. I mean, we're as busy as we've ever been, frankly, from the venture side, but we are only like seed in Series A. And from that respect, it's not really like an underwriting process as you would look at if you're writing a $50 million check. It's more like who's the team, what's the product, what's the market? So it's a very different evaluation process. But later stage venture right now is getting crushed.
00:23:33.082 - 00:23:37.040, Speaker D: Pain startups with six months of runway left.
00:23:37.410 - 00:24:18.160, Speaker A: How do you think about what's a better strategy? So if you're a late stage company like, let's say you're Series C, Series D, you raised it a $5 billion valuation a year ago. You now have the option to either cut I'm going to go drastic. You have the opportunity or the ability to cut, like, 80% of your team, pull back drastically, you cut 80% of your costs, and you just kind of drag this out so that you don't have to raise a down. Round or you're like, all right, I'm maybe only going to lay off, like, 10% of people and just keep growing market share. Keep kind of going to market, building product, hiring devs, but raise a big down Round at maybe 70% haircut. What's the better strategy there?
00:24:18.530 - 00:25:02.870, Speaker B: It's so dependent on what that business is. If you have a capital light business and you can cut 50% and not kill your growth 50%, then that's obviously the thing to do. There are a lot of these businesses, as we're talking about, the doodles of the world, who have the same affliction that are private $5 billion companies who just have a ton of people there. Why do they have a ton of people there? It doesn't really make a ton of sense. I think that leaning out in those cases makes the most sense, obviously. Here's another interesting tidbit. I think what's going to happen, though, no matter whether you raise at a lower valuation or not, is that the investors and the boards of these companies are going to push for lower valuations internally.
00:25:02.870 - 00:26:00.538, Speaker B: What I mean by this is you've done a 409 A valuation that's like your basic bare bones accounting valuation based on revenue and growth and public multiples. So that's one thing. That's how you value the strike price of options when you're giving options to employees. What I think will also happen is you're going to start to see investors in these later rounds that sit on these boards push for internal lower valuations across the entire company. So if you sold preferred shares at 5 billion, they'll push for a re rating of what that internal valuation is to two or three, just based on market comps alone. And one piece of information I saw on Twitter which unsubstantiated anecdotal Is, and there's a secondary marketplace for LP interest in these venture funds. What's happening right now is the marketplace for these venture funds is clearing at, on average, a 40% discount to where the book value is relative to where these investments are marked.
00:26:00.538 - 00:26:37.130, Speaker B: And so what that suggests to me is that the LPs in these venture funds already know that these things are going to take probably a 40% haircut at some point and that they're willing to buy them at that price because either they think that's attractive or they. Want to be able to get access to those funds. Usually there's some sort of inflation there, so maybe it's actually a 50% discount, but they're willing to buy them at 40 to get access to that fund. But, yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of carnage. Internal external valuations, a lot of that's going to change. The tough part is it takes quarters and years because you either have to go through an internal valuation change or you have to go through a new fundraise.
00:26:38.270 - 00:27:18.582, Speaker D: Some of these venture funds are just done like the growth stage ones. You look at the hot deals that close over the past two years. I was looking on Michael Dempsey, who manages another fund, sent me a sheet that's like a name, like anderal like, American Dynamism. Very contemporary in terms of shipping Ukraine weapons, 80% discount. How do you square that with your LPs when you made this huge bet on them six or twelve months ago? Web Two VC is really bloated. There's like 100 times as many firms as there are in crypto. You're going to see the whole middle section of that market get cut.
00:27:18.582 - 00:27:32.350, Speaker D: And I think, really, the dynamic moving forward is like the best Web Two funds, the good Web Three funds, because there's just not that many of them. And that's the whole package. But everyone else is going to be shit out of luck, in my opinion.
00:27:32.930 - 00:28:21.020, Speaker C: What about I'd be curious. Within the specific stages of cryptos, there's like seed series A, series B, whatever in crypto. One thing I've just found kind of tricky, or just I'm trying to figure out is, like, we all saw Andreessa to raise like $4 billion right at the top. And I assume most of that is or a good portion of that is undeployed. I'm just trying to do math on how long you have to deploy that amount of money and you have to do pretty rapid deal making. And I'm wondering if there are a couple of big funds like that with dry powder on the sidelines. Basically, is the dry powder on the sideline thing, is that actually going to be enough to sustain valuations somewhat or do you guys just see is it just going to be this slow, unwind of valuations in the next six to eight months?
00:28:21.870 - 00:29:00.966, Speaker B: Keep in mind, with those funds that are crypto, like Andreeson, I don't have any information on them, but I can imagine that this is the case. They're also not just putting that into private deals, they're probably buying liquid assets. And how much of that goes into liquid? How much doesn't? I mean, if liquid gets more attractive and valuations are still the same, you would naturally think that it kind of shifts from a portfolio allocation perspective. So I don't think four and a half is really like, dry powder, right. Sustaining private valuations. The other thing, too, is if there aren't attractive deals, it's also hard to justify there's two ways to get in trouble as a venture firm. Number one, missing something.
00:29:00.966 - 00:29:39.990, Speaker B: So why weren't you in that deal? That thing turned into a hundred billion dollar Facebook. The second one is, why did you put that much money into that one? And really being able to justify that when you looked over the Tear Sheet Nets fundraise and it's like, okay, you are the board partner on that. You put 50 million into that. Let's go back over why and revisit your investment thesis. So I think there is potential career risk in some of these situations for putting large amounts of capital as a multibillion dollar fund does or has to into. Some things that we're talking about now could potentially be overvalued.
00:29:41.130 - 00:30:16.186, Speaker D: To be clear, not all the startups are dead. You kind of see two types of charts. One is like our revenue was mostly a bull market phenomenon. We're leveraged, super leveraged, the cycle of users, adoptions, people trading shitcoins and NFTs, things like that. That's kind of like one chart that you see. I would say that's probably 80% of the charts that we see in terms of people pitching us stuff, the other 20% are like, we're about to break our bull run. All time, high monthly revenue, we have a clear path to ten X this and we're just going to keep executing.
00:30:16.186 - 00:30:53.902, Speaker D: Those are the startups, we're just telling them, here's more money, try to buy your competitors out of the marketplace in terms of just growing your market share, hiring more people. The problem with those deals, like the deals that are up into the right in terms of revenue, those are like Series A, Series B companies. That's not something quite yet that you can put 100 million into at a billion dollar valuation and buy 10%. That's going to take a few years. And so I think what you do is you have to do different things. If you have a very large fund, you have to do liquid, you have to wait the market out to let these companies mature. But it's not going to be the same playbook as the bull run.
00:30:53.902 - 00:31:16.930, Speaker D: I think we've kind of said goodbye to that for at least a couple of years. Giving Openc $400 million at a 13 and a half billion dollar valuation. Ditto Alchemy giving Moonbird 60 million. Those are the things which are going to be your LPs are just going to ask questions around how this works and how does it generate revenue at scale.
00:31:17.990 - 00:31:35.334, Speaker C: We got a couple more stories before we're going to do so. Coinbase is going to be releasing earnings in ten minutes from now, so we can take a look at those once they go live. But we've got JPMorgan and their Ave fork and trade, and we've also got NFT leaning further into or sorry, Jesus Instagram leaning.
00:31:35.382 - 00:32:19.954, Speaker A: Let's talk about FTX, let's talk about Alameda. I want to talk about Alameda because I want to give Vance's take. All right, that here, because I feel like Vance might have something spicy, but the high level and I haven't looked into this too much is so CoinDesk had some good reporting earlier today, or yesterday, I think it was Ian Allison over there. Per CoinDesk, Alameda Research has 14 and a half billion dollars of assets against 8 billion of liabilities. What's interesting is when you dig into the assets, three and a half billion is FTT that's unlocked. I think over two of that is FTT that's locked, or that's like collateral in other D Five protocols, which like some weird protocols actually too, some weird pools. Then there's like another three and a half billion of crypto.
00:32:19.954 - 00:33:09.734, Speaker A: Most of that is salana, or like over a billion of that is salana, and a lot of that salana is locked. Salana. Basically, they've got this huge balance. Like 14 and a half billion is this huge number. But when you actually dig into the assets, a, a large amount of that is these assets that are deeply connected to FTX, with FTT and with Solana too. And furthermore, where they've put that, a lot of the collateral that they have is against these FTT tokens, which Alameda, which is like kind of the quasi trading arm of FTX or linked to it, obviously very directly holds sometimes 99% of it. So, I don't know, like Vance, when you start digging into this kind of a balance sheet, what kind of flags go? Obviously, there are probably some red flags.
00:33:09.734 - 00:33:11.020, Speaker A: What do you start thinking?
00:33:11.950 - 00:34:01.740, Speaker D: Yeah, so on an asset basis, the first thing that stands out is that Alameda owns over 10% of salana, which is like a token distribution that I've never seen in my entire life. And so it just gives you a sense of how much of the network they own and what their priority stack ranking is. And I think they have a lot of soul. But the bigger one is the FTT, right. That is clearly the strategically most important asset on their balance sheet. It's the one where they're collateralizing the most with it on DeFi and CFI borrowing stables or whatever against it. But the problem with these two assets and really holding large assets that are semi liquid at scale right now, is that if you had to sell a billion of Solana, the market just would not be able to digest that.
00:34:01.740 - 00:34:35.282, Speaker D: Especially when the potential largest buyer of it is you. Usually when we trade coins, we know who we're trading against. It's either Jump or Alameda or maybe Winter Mute if they're trading that day. But the participant said is not infinite. And so I think the overall takeaway here is that Alameda is probably in not as creative position as we would have thought otherwise. I don't think they're financially insolvent or anything like that. I just think this is kind of like what happens in a bear market when you have to manage your liquidity, but it's certainly not a great look.
00:34:35.282 - 00:35:10.960, Speaker D: And having $8 billion of liabilities against a bunch of illiquid stuff, if things really turn down, that's also a huge problem and it kind of leads into this illiquidity problem, which I was talking about. So what do they do? I think Alameda makes a lot of money. They're probably making a couple of hundred to $500 million a year would be my guess, off of this balance sheet in this current yield environment. So they certainly have cash flow. But yeah, I think just things are less stable than I would have expected, frankly. And the balance sheet is much larger and much more liquid than I would have thought.
00:35:11.810 - 00:35:17.250, Speaker B: One question, how much did you say they have of unlocked FTT?
00:35:18.710 - 00:35:20.978, Speaker A: 3.6 billion, I think.
00:35:21.144 - 00:35:50.860, Speaker B: I mean the entire market cap of FTDT, which suggests the liquid amount of FTT is 3.3 billion right now. So let's assume that these numbers are slightly off or that FTT has gone down. I don't know where it was trading on June 30, but they own all of the FTT or at least all of the liquid trading FTT. And I don't know exactly how the buyback and burn or the buyback works, but do they actually burn the FTT or do you just get to buy it?
00:35:51.630 - 00:36:44.190, Speaker D: So the way the buyback works and the rough numbers, they're burning about four or $5 million a week. And this kind of really makes you think if you're SBF or you're Alameda, what are you thinking? What I'm thinking is I really need to defend the price of FTT. And so it makes a lot of sense that they're putting this much money on a weekly basis into doing that. That's a lot of money they could just be putting into Alameda or FTX or whatever. So that makes sense. The second thing I'm trying to do is get out of the soul or at least slowly manage my liquidity to a better position or frankly, build up salana DeFi so that I can actually put in a couple billion dollars of soul and draw a few hundred million of stablecoins against it. So there are a lot of kind of strategic options which come out of just looking at this balance sheet, but I think most of them have to do with selling, not buying or borrowing more, getting more leverage.
00:36:44.930 - 00:36:48.320, Speaker B: Here's a counterpoint sorry, go ahead.
00:36:48.770 - 00:36:54.598, Speaker A: I'm just going to say you guys should pull up the coin Gecko charts for FTT and Salon.
00:36:54.634 - 00:36:55.940, Speaker C: I was going to say this too.
00:36:59.430 - 00:37:26.026, Speaker A: There's interesting price action, which is they both fell to $30. They're kind of just going down. They fell to $30. There's basically an infinite bid. There's been an infinite bid at $30 since kind of the exact same day, which is like the first week of June. So I don't know what's going on there, but I don't know there's just this infinite bid at $30 for both those assets since the first week of June, and they just don't budge from 30.
00:37:26.208 - 00:38:24.922, Speaker D: Yeah. So when I look at the salana every day, how I can tell if it's like a bad day or a good day generally, or if it's over above $30 or under or below $30. That kind of broke last week and FTT is now at 24. Like figuring out what the re rating of these could be in the context of their balance sheet and what that forces them to do, especially when you look at something like Magic Internet money, which is a protocol which produces a stablecoin and almost 40% $70 million of their backing collateral is FTT. You have the potential for a toxic asset spiral in the same way that you had Luna and UST. The move, if you really want to play this is probably putting in FTT as to collateral, to a place that you think is semi dangerous, borrowing assets against that and leaving people with bad debt that's unfortunately like.
00:38:24.976 - 00:38:57.926, Speaker A: But isn't that what they've isn't that what this kind of just showed that they've been doing, which is putting and then let me extend that further. Does it see, they came out in this bear market. They're on the offensive, like the COVID of magazines saying SBF is the white knight. Does it make you think, though, that a lot of the capital that they're using for these acquisitions of maybe a Voyager, a blockfire, whoever it may be, is them just putting an FTT into these pretty dangerous pools, like a MIM getting stables out and then using that.
00:38:57.948 - 00:39:30.834, Speaker B: To capitalize acquisitions, it would make you think that. So you kind of touched on it. But what I was going to say is this could be the completely rational strategy. And what happens if FTT goes away, goes to zero, gets however many billions of dollars of locked FTT is liquidated on market. What actually happens in that instance? I don't know. There really isn't anything that really happens because of that. Because FTTx is just going to continue on in the same way that it is.
00:39:30.834 - 00:39:57.020, Speaker B: It just won't have the burn or the burn will be burning a ton of so like that's that's the thing that's holding it up. Alameda loses a balance sheet item or a balance sheet liability, but they gain the asset that they have borrowed as collateral, which is a massive multi billion dollar position. I could see a world where everything just kind of blows up and it's still okay, right? Or am I missing something?
00:39:59.310 - 00:40:51.978, Speaker D: Honestly, I had forgotten about FTT until it came up in this context. I didn't know that it was $8 billion fully diluted, that it had this type of profile or was this important to them strategically, I think other people realizing this is going to make the outcome where they really try to test the liquidity of FTT more likely. Just like when people knew that Doe was potentially in a position of weakness. We saw a lot of people that we know try to basically short it and take shots at like that's kind of what happens when people realize it. I don't think it's like an all good, you can just walk away style scenario. I think you have the collapse of at least five or ten DeFi protocols, and then you have the cycle down of the Salana asset because people will know that's the only other assets on their balance sheet if FTT spirals. So there's this combinatorial effect, which I don't think is just like, it's all good.
00:40:51.978 - 00:41:01.118, Speaker D: I think this is potentially very risky, but it feels like SBF is rich enough where he could just backstop it from FTX as well. So I don't know how it works.
00:41:01.284 - 00:41:04.980, Speaker A: And this is why they're raising more money right now.
00:41:05.430 - 00:41:42.502, Speaker C: I feel like if Alameda saw themselves in the market, they would poach them. You know what I mean? When Alameda saw celsius offside on the Steep trade, they made them crumble. I feel like if Alameda saw themselves, they would take them out here because yeah, they're very levered to the price of soul. Maybe we should talk. I don't know. I've heard rumors that, like, Alameda, FTX, SBF, whatever, however, whatever entity he's working through is basically supporting the price of solar bucks. But these are unfounded rumors I've heard around the water cooler.
00:41:42.646 - 00:42:18.600, Speaker D: We don't know. The only thing I'll say about these scenarios is I'm in this group chat with a bunch of fund managers. I think sue and Kyle used to be in the chat, and they've since been kind know, kicked. But like, it went from good guys. It went from everybody being like buddy buddy, to people being like, where's Three Arrow strike price people trying to basically hunt them while they were still in the Telegram group. It's vicious out there. And so you kind of need to carry like a big stick and threaten people with it every once in a while.
00:42:18.600 - 00:42:28.726, Speaker D: But in the Doe quant scenario, that didn't really help that much. So you need a lot of capital to defend an $8 billion coin or a $12 billion coin.
00:42:28.758 - 00:42:39.120, Speaker C: Like, what do you guys think of these interviews that he's doing? Have you seen any of these at like, the Unchained interview or the coinage one or whatever? Have you watched any of them?
00:42:40.450 - 00:42:47.538, Speaker D: The kind of I'm waiting for the interviews. Those are the ones which I'm the most interested in.
00:42:47.624 - 00:42:48.580, Speaker A: For the what?
00:42:49.270 - 00:42:50.942, Speaker D: The sue and Kyle interviews.
00:42:51.006 - 00:42:54.100, Speaker C: They gave one in Bloomberg. Did you see this?
00:42:54.790 - 00:42:55.538, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:55.704 - 00:43:16.006, Speaker D: I need to see the know them talking. I want to see just like the whole vibe. But the do Kwan interviews are strange. It doesn't seem possible that he's still out there just living his life. And also on Twitter. I don't know if I get much from it other than it didn't work. And a lot of people got hurt.
00:43:16.198 - 00:43:20.460, Speaker C: It's probably the only real take that matters, honestly. Yeah.
00:43:22.510 - 00:43:31.534, Speaker A: Doesn't seem like the end of the FTX story. We can move past FTX, but I think this FTX thing is going to be in the I think this is the start.
00:43:31.572 - 00:43:32.462, Speaker B: This is not the end.
00:43:32.516 - 00:43:33.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:33.412 - 00:43:39.374, Speaker D: For the record, I am on the team of like, I think they're solvent. I hope they're solvent.
00:43:39.422 - 00:43:41.282, Speaker A: I do too. I'm ready for them.
00:43:41.336 - 00:43:41.794, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:41.912 - 00:44:00.450, Speaker A: I just think usually where there's smoke, there's fire. People are going to be looking at this. It's a bear market. These are the things that happen in bear markets. They also just allocated a bunch of capital. If I'm blocked by them, fingers crossed their deal still goes through. These are just the things that happen in bear markets.
00:44:00.610 - 00:44:15.422, Speaker D: Keep in mind, you guys are in this business. Everyone is reading these articles for a reason. Somebody decided to leak this to the press for a reason. Somebody didn't just stumble upon this. And so I wonder what that is, is kind of my other question.
00:44:15.556 - 00:44:16.270, Speaker C: 100%.
00:44:16.340 - 00:44:16.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:19.010 - 00:44:28.130, Speaker C: Maybe this is like even too simple of a take, but if you had made me guess what does Alameda's balance sheet look like, this is just not what I would have thought it resembled.
00:44:29.670 - 00:44:31.182, Speaker D: I thought it would be like Bitcoin.
00:44:31.326 - 00:44:32.754, Speaker C: That's what I would have said, too.
00:44:32.872 - 00:44:39.238, Speaker A: You don't think it would resemble a retail trader? No.
00:44:39.404 - 00:45:11.406, Speaker D: Yeah, we got some sushi, we got some rocket pool. But think of it this way, too. If I told you that a VC that had a tendency to sell owned 10% of a coin that you thought was going to go up, that doesn't seem to fit logically. You're going to have a serious headwind when Salana comes back, in my opinion, just because this liquidity situation looks like it needs to be managed. And it feels like Alamate is going to be pretty on the ball when it comes to getting more cash on their balance sheet, if this is really what it looks like.
00:45:11.508 - 00:45:39.960, Speaker C: Yeah. I wonder if they're just trying to wait it out. I mean, that was my kind of very simple take, is I kind of just think they're looking at this being like, yeah, eventually, maybe it's one year, two years, or whatever. Bull market will return, liquidity will come back to FTT and salana and all that stuff. And they can exit at a pretty good position, I would say. But I was just surprised that it wasn't I thought it would have been like 50% cash is their portfolio. I was just surprised that this is how it looked, to be honest.
00:45:40.810 - 00:46:03.598, Speaker D: It kind of just means those assets are going to be range bound. Like they can't let them drop below a certain threshold or else their liabilities, something probably happens. Maybe they get margin calls, maybe they get reached out to you have to repay your loans early. But on the other side if it runs too high, that's a liquidity situation which you now need to manage. And so you kind of have this bounded outcome for at least the near term of those coins just because of the liquidity position they're in.
00:46:03.764 - 00:46:07.630, Speaker C: So you're saying there's an SBF put on Solana?
00:46:08.790 - 00:46:28.380, Speaker D: I tweeted this. I tweeted this. When he was originally talking about buying Bitcoin, I very much do think there is an SBF put around. He said it was around 17 or 16K bitcoin. I don't know what that would be for salona, probably like 22, $25. But yeah, when the richest person in crypto tells you there's a put, you kind of got to believe them.
00:46:28.910 - 00:46:49.840, Speaker C: Yeah, fair enough. Maybe we could talk about Instagram moving deeper into NFTs in general. I'm not sure if you guys heard about this, but basically Instagram announced. Do you actually want to talk about this story? I feel like you had some thoughts on.
00:46:51.570 - 00:47:13.894, Speaker A: Mean, let's, um, let's do Ave for a second. Ave and Morgan because I think that will segue cause that was also on Polygon. That'll segue into Instagram in a second. And I've just been spending more time with the Morgan. I've been talking to Tyrone Ty from Morgan all morning about the deal, so I know just a little bit more about it. Basically, Singapore is very into crypto. Singapore has been very pro crypto for a long time.
00:47:13.894 - 00:47:52.910, Speaker A: They have something called the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS. They have Project Guardian to basically get more into crypto. They went to Morgan to basically do a crypto experiment. And so what they actually did here is Morgan built this essentially permissioned, it's really a permissioned DeFi thing. Built on it was a fork of Ave Arc. And what they did is they worked with Singapore's largest bank, which is DBS, and then Tokyo Bank, which is SBI. And they basically tokenized JPY, the end, and they tokenized SGD, which is the Singapore dollar.
00:47:52.910 - 00:48:28.640, Speaker A: And they basically created a pool essentially in this forked version of Aave Arc on Polygon. And they swapped assets on it. So it was like super about as permissioned DeFi as you can get. But it was a live cross currency transaction on a fork of Ave Arc, which is pretty cool. That's the overview. There are first, which I can talk about, but yeah. What do you guys think about this?
00:48:29.410 - 00:49:02.326, Speaker D: I hope this is the start of a longer term commitment to doing these things and bringing clients on chain. It feels like a lot of these bank pilots end in like, okay, we're going to go build our own permission blockchain. Thanks for trying it out live in the public or they just don't have the follow through, but these are things that we need to be doing. I'm glad that Polygon's BD team is strong enough and also shows that they're pretty dynamic. They can do the gaming stuff, they can do the big institutional stuff. TBD how much value this actually brings to crypto. It's usually not a huge problem getting them to come to crypto.
00:49:02.326 - 00:49:07.594, Speaker D: It's a problem getting them to stay. So yeah, I mean, bullish, but we'll see.
00:49:07.792 - 00:49:31.218, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, JP Morgan's been working on blockchain stuff for a long time, right? You remember? Like Amber Balde. I don't know how long you guys have known the blockchain team over there. Amber? Yeah. Clover now, like, Christine Moy. Yeah, Christine Moy worked really hard on building the blockchain team over there, and they've been building they had Quorum, if you guys remember that back in 2015, 2016, the fork of ethereum. Then I think consensus took that over.
00:49:31.218 - 00:50:01.414, Speaker A: Like, York roads at Microsoft was managing it for a little bit, I think. So JPMorgan has been working on this for, like, a decade. I don't think it does much for DFI, honestly. But what I think it does is if you read Ty so that guy Ty Lobon, I think is his last name, if you read his thread about this, that is a crypto savvy person. Like, he's talking about zero knowledge proofs. He's talking about forking aveark. He posted, actually, the transaction hashes on polygon scan.
00:50:01.414 - 00:50:25.934, Speaker A: That is a crypto savvy team over there. And I think what it does is it makes other banks realize it makes other institutions realize, oh, crap, people are taking this seriously. Okay. People are doing this thing. Oh, wow. Okay. And it also pushes regulators to say, these ave pools, these lend and borrow platforms, real people are using these like crap.
00:50:25.934 - 00:50:31.190, Speaker A: Okay, I need to figure out what's going on here. I think it's net positive.
00:50:31.850 - 00:50:41.290, Speaker D: We need the narrative when it's a bit strange that it's on a like, you know, ostensibly you'd build this on ETH, but it's positive.
00:50:42.270 - 00:50:46.902, Speaker A: Sorry, this is a really dumb question. What's a POA chain proof of authority?
00:50:46.966 - 00:50:51.630, Speaker D: Basically like a permit validator set for polygon. That's how their current chain works.
00:50:51.780 - 00:51:34.970, Speaker A: Got it. I want to actually ask you guys a question about polygon a SEC after we talk about the Instagram story. But the other interesting thing here was I think they built this in house on chain verification thing. And he said he's like, look, the design of this wasn't perfect, but he's like, there's no possible way we could have gotten into DeFi without KYC going through compliance. And KYC and he's like, in the future, we at Morgan hope to actually use zero knowledge proofs for this. So I think it's cool to see them pushing the edge of innovation on the DeFi side of things.
00:51:35.120 - 00:51:45.920, Speaker B: I mean, this just furthers the thesis that public permission DeFi is how institutions will interact. If they want to interact, you have to be permissioned. It's just no, there's no question.
00:51:46.290 - 00:52:23.254, Speaker A: Yeah. They also built their own in house wallet, which is cool. Like, they built this institutional wallet where traders couldn't access any company funds, only approved D Five protocols. Could be used, and then VCs were like, there's some sort of process thing where, I don't know, they built their own institutional wallet, which was really cool. I think it's a cool development. I'm curious what you think of this, Mike, like Ave Arc and permission DeFi. And we explored this in season one of Bell Curve and talked to Ben Foreman about it on the podcast.
00:52:23.254 - 00:52:25.260, Speaker A: I'm just curious to get your take on this.
00:52:26.510 - 00:53:25.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a pretty hard time getting I think it's like a great I basically agree with what we've a it's a positive development. It's hard for me to feel like, super excited about things because kind of like, maybe this a POC, maybe it goes somewhere, but maybe it's just I don't know, it hasn't got anywhere in the past in any of these POCs that I've kind of watched. I guess I'm having trouble envisioning what the future for DeFi might look like. Because on the one hand, Michael, I know we talked about on our panel back at Das London, right? It seems very bullish for actually permission DeFi, right, where all the assets are institutions, they simply cannot interact with a financial system that doesn't do KYC, all that kind of stuff. But I think then you lose a lot of the core advantages of it. And then there's this other I could also see a future where the overtone window shifts and for whatever reason, geopolitically people say, oh, actually privacy is like a very good thing, and maybe it's a government that gets out of control. There's a lot of abuses of, I don't know, the weaponization of the financial system.
00:53:25.694 - 00:54:03.178, Speaker C: And people decide, like, I actually want privacy in a financial system, in which case permissionless kind of DeFi ends up working. I think the future ends up probably ending between being somewhere in between those two things, and there's probably a permissioned DeFi and a permissionless DeFi. But I guess for me, in my own personal interest, I think that probably the permissionless one will be more interesting. For me. Not saying it will be larger or more impactful, but for me, that's kind of where I want to spend my career. So I think there will be big permission DeFi, but I just don't see it being as personally interesting to me. That's kind of my thought, unless the.
00:54:03.184 - 00:54:35.938, Speaker B: Products that you could access are differentiated. So one thing that we were talking about is where can you buy a ten year treasury bond on chain? Right now, you literally have to go to a prime brokerage or a brokerage account and buy it. If you signed up for a brokerage account and that gave you access to buy it on chain, I would totally do that. So if the product differentiation is there relative to the permissionless public, permission DeFi versus permissionless, I think that would drive more interest from a retail perspective. But I agree with you.
00:54:36.024 - 00:54:36.706, Speaker C: What up?
00:54:36.808 - 00:55:17.618, Speaker D: Yeah, the yields in. DeFi are so cyclical that they're super levered to the cycle. Having a countercyclical business like TradFi and all of the yields and all of the bonds and stocks that they have brought on like that helps make crypto more defensible, which is really good I think at the end of the day, permissionless finance and crypto, twitter and crypto culture and ethereum, that's part of a movement. Like the hippies in the was a movement. I think roughly the same thing is happening right now. Permissioned Finance that can never really be a movement. It can't be the core of it, it can be something you staple onto the margins of it, but it's never going to be the thing that pushes it forward.
00:55:17.784 - 00:55:37.286, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd completely agree with that part of me too. I do see some of the innovation is good. There's not enormous amount of innovation in finance. There are a lot of poor incentives I think that work that way. But also sometimes you see also sometimes you see people doing these things in crypto that at least I don't agree with.
00:55:37.308 - 00:55:37.446, Speaker A: Like.
00:55:37.468 - 00:56:08.900, Speaker C: Let's take FTT. There has been this idea that you can create a token out of nowhere which is basically very risky, very volatile early stage equity and that's like good collateral to dump in a pool and get USDC out of. Maybe this is my own risk tolerance, I'm more on the conservative side of things but I kind of feel like that's a recipe for disaster. There's a lot of that that goes on basically. And I think there is at least some benefit, right, to having maybe some guidelines to things. Absolutely not.
00:56:10.710 - 00:56:11.780, Speaker A: Rip it.
00:56:13.670 - 00:56:14.354, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:56:14.392 - 00:56:48.030, Speaker B: I mean one of the biggest things that I think about a lot as investors is and one of the most important components of the SEC in terms of companies is whether or not insiders are selling. Don't you want to know whether or not someone who started a protocol who owns 5% of it still has their 5% or every single time that they sell, they have to register that sale. That's really important information that people should know before they invest in it. That type of stuff I think is the rule set that we're talking about here and I think that we could actually do with a lot of that type of stuff.
00:56:48.180 - 00:56:48.880, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:51.810 - 00:56:52.686, Speaker A: I can tell you guys one.
00:56:52.708 - 00:57:32.454, Speaker C: More prediction actually on this about the whole I think circle is going to start to print unreal revenue and I think there are going to be a bunch of businesses that start to challenge them. They have a sweet business and their business is literally buy super short dated, super liquid Treasuries and earn billions of dollars. That's straight up their business right now. And I think a bunch of companies are going to look at that and be like, oh, I'd actually like to compete. Like Coinbase is starting to compete for some of those yields with Circle. They're trying to get in a way because they have the center consortium together and they have a revenue split based on where the USDC is custodied. So that's, I think, the best way to understand the PSM thing and maker.
00:57:32.454 - 00:57:52.370, Speaker C: And they'll probably go and hunt for USDC deposits so they can boost up that. There's a really important line item for them on their income statement, which is they're talking about their subscription like other revenue. Right. We're not a transaction based businesses. And an enormous part of that right now is interest, actually, that they generate.
00:57:58.950 - 00:57:59.694, Speaker B: Great transition.
00:57:59.742 - 00:58:05.494, Speaker C: If you want to talk about it, I messed up. It's 530. They're coming out. So, yeah, we're going to miss it by like, an hour.
00:58:05.532 - 00:58:09.210, Speaker B: No, earnings are out. Earnings are out. The call is at 530.
00:58:09.280 - 00:58:10.380, Speaker C: Nice. Let's go.
00:58:13.390 - 00:58:59.658, Speaker B: I actually think Coinbase is also one of the hugest benefactors of this as well, because who would you trust more to custody your assets, circle or Coinbase? And if you're custodying your USDC with Coinbase, they get that cut. It is, I think, what happens when we're going to go into a world and this is one of the things we were talking about with Treasuries on chain, where real risk free rate yield is going to be four plus percent, at least, probably for a little while. Whether or not that persists into like, 2024 remains to be seen, but at least for a while, you're going to have some pretty reliable sources of yield. And I think the places like Coinbase are going to benefit from it. Once again, one of the things that you see in this Q Three breakdown, which I've been looking at in the.
00:58:59.664 - 00:59:04.650, Speaker A: Background for the last five minutes, big miss, though. Big miss on coinbase earnings.
00:59:05.230 - 00:59:07.110, Speaker B: Big miss. But look at the stock.
00:59:07.270 - 00:59:07.980, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:08.430 - 00:59:10.940, Speaker A: Because they missed less than people thought they would miss.
00:59:11.470 - 00:59:12.220, Speaker B: No.
00:59:12.990 - 00:59:14.238, Speaker C: What are the results? Can you read them?
00:59:14.244 - 00:59:51.058, Speaker B: Like, my guess here? Yeah. So they had net revenue, 576,000,366 of which was transaction revenue, 211 of which was subscription and services revenue. So the shift from transaction to services is happening faster than people expected, it seems. They had Q two. So these are the numbers. Q Two to Q Three trading. It doesn't have trading revenue, but volume of Q Two was 217,000,000,000.
00:59:51.058 - 01:00:07.694, Speaker B: Volume for Q Three was 159,000,000,000, whereas subscription and services revenue went from 147 to 211 q Two to Q Three, respectively. So it is increasing at a faster rate than people expected. And that's why I think you see this stock trading flat right now.
01:00:07.812 - 01:00:08.334, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:08.452 - 01:00:10.634, Speaker B: Did you see, even though they missed.
01:00:10.762 - 01:00:47.820, Speaker C: Estimates by 50, what's their EBITDA? Does it say what you're looking at? The reason I'm asking is Coinbase has basically guided investors towards negative 500 million in EBITDA on the year. So basically they can lose, like as long as they're only losing an EBITDA, like 220,000,000 or something like that. This quarter 210 to 230, something like that. If they basically keep that loss relatively steady, volumes don't completely collapse and they grow their subscription. The stock was always going to go up because the street has basically priced in declining transaction revenue and they're totally fine with that.
01:00:48.750 - 01:00:49.258, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:00:49.344 - 01:00:53.870, Speaker B: It was 116,000,000 net adjusted EBITDA loss for the quarter.
01:00:54.530 - 01:00:57.440, Speaker C: That's way above expect. They were projected to live much better.
01:00:59.090 - 01:01:26.600, Speaker B: So that's the other thing. What they guided what the outlook was for Q three was approximately a billion in R and D spend, with 400 million in stock based comp. For sales and marketing, they were 25% lower than their expectations, and for R and D, they were about 10% lower than their expectations. So costs were actually lower than expectations. And transaction revenue up or sorry, subscription revenue up.
01:01:28.650 - 01:01:58.226, Speaker D: They fired the CPO or he left this week. You read that article at that period of time for a specific reason, and they knew what the financials were. And so they couched that with something really important. Generally with news. And everything that comes up is like every picture that you see in every story, every headline, it's all there for a reason. It's all very pro forma, prescripted, whatever you want to call it. This is like the turn.
01:01:58.226 - 01:02:10.110, Speaker D: We fired the CPO who bageled a bunch of know the transaction you know, is coming down. Services are going like, I would not be surprised if this is the start of a more sustainable run for Coinbase.
01:02:10.190 - 01:02:12.390, Speaker A: This is the Rip the Band Aid period.
01:02:12.730 - 01:02:19.030, Speaker D: This is the Rip the Bandaid period, right? The guy who everyone made fun of that you paid way too much. We'd let go. We're going to find a new CPO.
01:02:19.110 - 01:02:19.740, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:02:20.590 - 01:02:22.650, Speaker A: Still burning 500 million a quarter.
01:02:24.430 - 01:02:27.814, Speaker B: No, that was net income. That was net income.
01:02:27.862 - 01:02:28.570, Speaker A: That wasn't cash.
01:02:28.640 - 01:02:44.394, Speaker C: They also have like 6 billion in cash to burn. They've got such a big cushion. Honestly. Honestly, I'm kind of a bull, right? I mean, they've done everything right. The criticism of Coinbase was they're trying to do way too many things. They've grown headcount way too much. They're super levered to transactions.
01:02:44.394 - 01:03:07.490, Speaker C: They had to reduce their headcount, right? They had to get their expenses in line. They had to grow their subscription line item, which basically seemed impossible, and they're kind of doing it. And they actually might be a monster in I mean, I wonder how that 200 million or whatever breaks out, but I wonder how much of that is staking. I think they might have like, a monster staking business on their hands, frankly.
01:03:07.650 - 01:03:08.600, Speaker B: They do.
01:03:09.450 - 01:03:21.680, Speaker D: They have a million CBE. They probably got, I think, like four or five or 6 million staked centralized ETH. They are by far the biggest ETH staker that we know of, and that is.
01:03:24.850 - 01:03:54.120, Speaker B: Mike. Here we go. Blockchain rewards staking basically in line from last quarter. Custodial fee revenue slightly down from last quarter. Other subscription services and services revenue, which is I would imagine like Coinbase cloud that's up exactly. The biggest one last quarter it was 32 and a half million from interest income. This quarter was 102,000,000.
01:03:54.890 - 01:03:55.718, Speaker C: Look at that.
01:03:55.804 - 01:03:56.886, Speaker B: So it's up three x.
01:03:56.908 - 01:04:24.480, Speaker C: That's wild. And they just got their whole PSM thing, that's 1.6 billion going in and they basically assume 50% of sorry, let's assume they have to pay 1.5% of that to maker and then they probably get another like but they're making at least 4%. Yeah, at least. That's what, three month treasury bills. That's like the most liquid thing you can short term, short duration thing you can buy.
01:04:24.480 - 01:04:43.878, Speaker C: And they got to pay some of that to circle. But that's going to be like tens of millions in additional income there. They'll probably run that back with multiple DeFi protocols. I bet you're going to see that Coinbase institutional team sliding into the DMs or onto the forums of a whole bunch of different big DeFi protocols because this was pretty successful for them.
01:04:44.044 - 01:05:19.060, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not just the protocols, though. If you look at the earnings from twelve months ago, 10% of like so they have this top 100 hedge fund list, coinbase in twelve months ago, earnings said 10% of those hundred are custodying and trading crypto with Coinbase, today's earnings announcement said 25%. So it's like the end of the day. If you're a big hedge fund and you want to get into trading crypto, you go to Coinbase and to have 25% of the world's 100 largest hedge funds custody with you is they're going to be fine.
01:05:19.510 - 01:05:59.120, Speaker B: The tough part though is institutional. Year over year, obviously, transaction revenue versus retail is down about three X and it's just been bleeding out. Basically. Just the institutional side has been bleeding out. In addition to retail over the last four quarters, custodian revenue, which you would assume is going up, if that what you're saying, Yano, is true, is going down, which I think also represents a compression of custodian fees. It's sort of like where do you want to store your assets? Well, we're just going to store it at whatever the cheapest place is. It takes six minutes for us to transact one custodian to the other.
01:05:59.120 - 01:06:08.146, Speaker B: So I think custodian revenue is really going to take a hit, but it is going to be interest income from USDC as well as staking rewards. Those are going to be the two.
01:06:08.168 - 01:06:09.860, Speaker C: Things that persist 100%.
01:06:10.630 - 01:06:33.802, Speaker D: I actually agree with that. I don't think the treasury whatever business is going to persist at all. I think you're kind of at an abnormally high rate for all interest rates. This is kind of like when last year everyone thought the DeFi yields were going to continue forever. I think the same thing is happening here. I don't think this is going to be a sustainable business for them. I think it's going to be something they did that when we look back on it, in a couple of years.
01:06:33.802 - 01:06:35.980, Speaker D: Looks like just a moment in time thing.
01:06:36.430 - 01:06:39.420, Speaker C: Unless you really I'm not sure I agree.
01:06:39.790 - 01:06:47.598, Speaker B: No, you don't have to believe that interest rates stay up. What you have to believe is that more assets come on the platform than interest rates go down.
01:06:47.684 - 01:06:58.740, Speaker C: Yeah, also we've just reverted to historically normal interest rates. These are not crazy rates. We were in an aberration before where they were that low, I think.
01:06:59.190 - 01:07:07.798, Speaker B: But if you assume rates stick around at like, let's say 2%, I would imagine they are able to increase the amount of assets on platform well over.
01:07:07.884 - 01:07:11.222, Speaker D: Two to three x two 3%.
01:07:11.276 - 01:07:11.494, Speaker A: Sure.
01:07:11.532 - 01:07:14.114, Speaker D: But like here or higher, I fundamentally don't.
01:07:14.162 - 01:08:03.778, Speaker C: I will say one thing that's a funky situation is that we've got an inverted yield curve. So usually the short term rates are lower than the long term rates and it's weird that's not the case. So probably there is room to fall for short term rates. But last thing, because I know we're going to wrap up soon, is that the derivatives market, this will probably come up on the so they acquired Ferex, Coinbase and you've heard like lightly talk about this. I think it's a big regulatory battle but the market for US derivatives in crypto is still very much anyone's game. I'd say CME, obviously very storied institution, kind of a head start. They will struggle based on their they probably won't move as fast as some of the crypto natives like FTX and Coinbase and I think they will run into challenges.
01:08:03.778 - 01:08:12.918, Speaker C: I would fight to guess I'd say Coinbase or FTX split that market and that's a huge opportunity. It's like a $50 billion market or something like that's large.
01:08:13.004 - 01:08:57.026, Speaker A: I have one last thing because I know we need to wrap this up, but I do want to so Instagram. I want to get back to Mike's thing about Instagram and polygon for a second because that'll tie into my last question I want to ask here, which is Instagram has just rolled out the ability to basically mint using mint NFTs inside of Instagram using polygon. You can also view or sell or something like that with some other things like flow and solana. Big news. Obviously, polygon's team is totally crushing it. They did that with Reddit as well. I'm curious, do you guys think that Polygon ends up declaring independence from Ethereum one day and becoming their own L1 to try to drive more value back to Maddox holders because they're working on their own data availability layer.
01:08:57.026 - 01:09:38.706, Speaker A: And I'm just like here the premise of that question. It feels like Polygon has basically like their marketing right now is really smart because the ETH crowd likes them because they're not in the camp of Avalanche or Salana where the ETH crowd is like oh, I don't like the alt L1s. So they're like, oh no, everything that we do on Polygon is good for ETH but really, if you look at what they're building, they're building their whole data availability layer. They're kind of building the full stack of an L1 blockchain. Do they end up just moving away from E so that Maddox ends up getting more valuable?
01:09:38.898 - 01:10:25.010, Speaker B: So data availability doesn't yeah, data availability doesn't mean that they move away from ETH. It just means that what they put onto ETH is smaller. Arbitrum is also building its own data availability data sampling component, which I can't remember what they're called, but they're like, any trust or something like anyways, the L3s basically SuperNet equivalent for Arbitrum is with a known set. Of validators who are going to be performing data availability, data sampling, and then one or two of those validators will put that call data on Chain. I think that that will be kind of the playbook that polygon runs as well, because you're still going to need some trusted settlement layer. It's just a question of what you're putting on chain. That is kind of the core question here.
01:10:25.010 - 01:10:26.390, Speaker B: I still think that's.
01:10:28.490 - 01:11:01.680, Speaker D: And you know, ETH is going to be the payment token for their ZK solution for their POA chain as well. They're doing the work to align themselves with ETH, I think in good and yeah, like, I think if they were to break from ETH right now or in the next three or four years, they wouldn't be strong enough to basically fend off competition from people who run the polygon playbook. But like, three years back in time. Just kidding. We're the real L two S, and we have the best. It's like hotball of money, hotball of users. It all is kind of the same thing.
01:11:02.850 - 01:11:20.280, Speaker C: Let me just ask this question to close it like Instagram rolling out NFT. I don't feel like I've got a good smart take or thought on the interaction between Instagram rolling out NFTs. Do people buy NFTs or use them through Instagram or how do those two things collide? I just don't understand it. I'll be honest. I don't have a good thought.
01:11:21.050 - 01:11:26.914, Speaker D: This is the classic mistake of, like, if I just get 1% of this huge market, I'm going to be gigantic.
01:11:26.962 - 01:11:27.560, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:11:28.250 - 01:11:49.662, Speaker D: The better idea is I want to get 100% of the weird crypto Djen activity that's happening on ETH and the weird people who use it, and maybe that'll be a big market someday. But we're doing the thing because it's small. We like it feels like a movement. I hope it plays out. Like the reddit NFT stuff. It's hard to get people to use stuff that they're not familiar with. And I think that's the core problem.
01:11:49.716 - 01:12:26.042, Speaker B: That they're going to have the counterpoint to that. And once again, to go back to what we talked about last week with NFTs and IAP, I think Instagram just sees this as an opportunity now that Apple has blessed this, to be able to actually sell NFTs in app and not have it be that much of an infrastructure overhead lift for them to enable this. If people really want to think about it. We just talked about how many people work at Instagram who work at Meta. There's probably, like, five PMS. Sitting around one day and, like, a team of 25 engineers who are, like, twiddling their thumbs waiting for some work to do, and they see Apple come out with new guidelines. And now it's like, okay, great, let's go off and build that and see if it works.
01:12:26.042 - 01:12:36.720, Speaker B: Like, no stand off our backs. And that's exactly the process, I think. I don't think this is, like, a structured, strategic move. I think this is more just, like, cool guidelines. Say this, let's go do that.
01:12:38.210 - 01:13:01.480, Speaker C: Just hearing you say that, actually, wouldn't that be kind of interesting? I mean, that's, like, one of the bigger monopoly. I know they've got better PR and everything, but Apple, their App Store business is the definition of a monopoly, in my opinion. Right. And their take rate is enormous. Right. 30% or 15% or whatever it is. It would be interesting if that was one of the developments that actually pushed people towards Web Three because they don't want to pay that Arduous take rate.
01:13:03.210 - 01:13:07.634, Speaker B: But once again, as Yano said, what phone are you going to use? That's not an iOS device.
01:13:07.682 - 01:13:08.454, Speaker A: You have to pay the text.
01:13:08.492 - 01:13:11.238, Speaker C: I don't want a green text because I do not want a green text.
01:13:11.324 - 01:13:14.934, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want you bringing green text.
01:13:15.052 - 01:13:16.290, Speaker A: I do, too. It feels dirty.
01:13:16.370 - 01:13:16.838, Speaker C: I hate it.
01:13:16.844 - 01:13:26.960, Speaker A: You want to hear a true story? You want to hear a true story? I have a brother and a sister, and my brother's not in my group chat with my family because he has a group text.
01:13:29.570 - 01:13:32.940, Speaker C: Fun one, guys, this week. We'll see you all next time.
