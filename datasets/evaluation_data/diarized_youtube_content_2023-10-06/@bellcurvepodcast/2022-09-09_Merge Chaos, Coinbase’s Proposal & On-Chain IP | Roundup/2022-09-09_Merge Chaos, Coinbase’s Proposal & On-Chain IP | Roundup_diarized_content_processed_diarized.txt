00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.920, Speaker A: Do you have Tom Brady, like, jump through a hoop on fire on like.
00:00:04.530 - 00:00:13.166, Speaker B: 20 seconds full makeout, baby, kiss me.
00:00:13.188 - 00:00:14.000, Speaker A: Like a man.
00:00:22.130 - 00:00:30.520, Speaker C: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that none, nothing on Bell Curve as financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:31.050 - 00:00:37.798, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curves. You've got Mike's one and two, yano and Vance. Folks, welcome.
00:00:37.964 - 00:00:38.454, Speaker D: Hey, guys.
00:00:38.492 - 00:00:38.706, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:00:38.748 - 00:00:49.014, Speaker B: Guys, I've got some exciting news on the blockworks front. Jason actually just accepted a position at Kim Kardashian's new private equity fund. Yeah. Congrats, buddy.
00:00:49.062 - 00:00:57.422, Speaker C: I would I would in a heartbeat, like, make maker, delegate, or like I mean, there's an obvious choice there.
00:00:57.556 - 00:00:58.746, Speaker B: That'd be quite a resume.
00:00:58.778 - 00:01:03.694, Speaker A: I think she's going to money from this. I think she's going to be so successful. People who are fading her just like.
00:01:03.732 - 00:01:05.060, Speaker D: How can I don't get it.
00:01:06.390 - 00:01:08.178, Speaker C: Such a no brainer. Good idea.
00:01:08.344 - 00:01:19.998, Speaker A: Yeah, I think she's going to make some the amount of consumer packaged goods companies that are down bad that she can just buy, turn around, put her sheen on, and resell. I think she's going to just kill it.
00:01:20.024 - 00:01:32.378, Speaker C: Every single new B to C brand that launches now is like a person's thing. It's like Ryan Scheckler's pancake mix. It's like this person's nail gloss. It's like every new brand. And she's going to be the queen of that.
00:01:32.464 - 00:01:58.450, Speaker D: It's like back in the 90s with Cisco and Oracle, when you had the networking technology or the database technology and you had the relationships with all the businesses, literally all their entire growth strategy was just buy up businesses, take the products from those businesses, and cram them down the throats of your existing customers. It worked. I mean, both of them became 150 plus billion dollar companies. And this is the same thing. It's just like the new age influencers are the new conduits.
00:01:59.910 - 00:02:18.130, Speaker B: How do you think she translates it from leveraging her brand and distribution to being on top at a private equity fund? Because she can't really take every single investment that they do. Do you think it's like, expertise that she has in flipping it because she can't put the Kim K personal stamp on everything they invest in? How does that work from a fund?
00:02:18.300 - 00:02:49.090, Speaker A: I think if you're a CPG firm and the options are like, sell for cash to one buyer or sell for like, 90% cash plus 10% upside in whatever Kim Kardashian is going to do to your brand, you probably take the upside. So she has an advantage in sourcing and then I think once it works, she has an advantage in fundraising too. The other guy who she works with is probably very legit, but people want to invest in Kim Kardashian. That's the draw.
00:02:49.240 - 00:03:04.338, Speaker B: I agree. Well, you know, it's a slow news week when we open the show with Kim K private equity fund. I love Kim K. Seriously proud of her, though. Honestly started, basically flipped a sex tape into a multibillion dollar private equity empire.
00:03:04.434 - 00:03:05.750, Speaker C: Got to respect that.
00:03:05.900 - 00:03:07.590, Speaker B: I respect the hell out of it.
00:03:07.740 - 00:03:16.460, Speaker C: No, the same people who are fading her the same people who are pissed at these TikTok people that they make $100 million a year. It's like, that's just the world we live in.
00:03:16.830 - 00:03:18.038, Speaker D: Middle curve.
00:03:18.214 - 00:03:19.734, Speaker C: Middle curve. Real middle curve.
00:03:19.782 - 00:03:20.186, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:03:20.288 - 00:03:39.202, Speaker B: Seriously. Dead middle. All right, we are like one week out from the ETH merge date, right. So it's going to be anywhere. I don't know if you guys have heard at a definitive time, but basically 13th through the 16th. So we're quoting this on the Eigth. I guess there are kind of two angles that we could talk about on this one.
00:03:39.202 - 00:04:17.754, Speaker B: Maybe it's like a little bit longer term, like just structural changes post merge. Maybe we can talk a little bit about our friend Hal Press's real yield thesis. And I'd love to know how you guys kind of bind to that, but maybe we could talk. There's a lot of I think people are kind of preparing for a little bit of chaos post merge. Right. So we saw a governance proposal pass on Aave where they're basically temporarily pausing borrowing ETH because people are basically trying to get as much ETH as they can before the snapshot is taken. Actually, before I get into it, me and Michael advanced when you want to get into what's going on, why the Aave thing happened, and then some of the arbitrage mischief that might be happening around the merge.
00:04:17.882 - 00:04:50.966, Speaker A: Yep. On Twitter. I called it slippery business. I feel like there's a bunch of positioning that's happening right now both in liquidity pools, but also people like the big players kind of like getting ready for what is a pre planned but chaotic event, which is kind of where they thrive the most. And so there's a couple of things going on. If you look at the borrow utilization of these pools, where the ETH is in them, those are skyrocketing. And so I think the utilization of the Ave pool, the last I checked, was like 70% almost.
00:04:50.966 - 00:05:30.498, Speaker A: And that skyrockets the borrowing rates. So if you're still in there, you're paying 24% at this point. That was the last time I checked. And so that's like a very painful trade. And that's happening at the same time. You look at the spot liquidity pools, things like Steeth and ETH, really any place where ETH is in a smart contract, people are pulling that out so that it's eligible for this AirDrop. Which is funny because they could have probably figured out a way to do this with all of these assets in the pools, but instead they've chosen to kind of intentionally have everyone pull their assets out and then put Humpty Dumpty back together again after the merge.
00:05:30.498 - 00:06:01.038, Speaker A: So there's going to be all these weird price disparity kind of differences between the pools and yeah, you look at the price of Steeth, it's like down to zero point 95. You look at the price of coinbase staked ETH, it's like down to zero point 91. There's just a lot going on and it'll be interesting to see kind of it pull apart, but also it come back together. And at the end of the day, we've said this before, I don't think the proof of work chain is going to be very interesting at all. I don't think it's going to be a hugely profitable opportunity.
00:06:01.124 - 00:06:39.766, Speaker D: I haven't checked, but I think the price is still like in the $30 range at least the futures price of where it's trading right now on some of these platforms, you can use the benchmark of ETH Classic versus ETH 2% historically is where ETH Classic has traded. But I think one of the bigger points to note is kind of what Vance touched on last is just the fact that there's a lot of work that has to go in to make this chain live. There has to be a client that's live. There has to be miners that are ready to go. There has to be people who are going to continue to use it. There's already been tons of signaling from all the different platforms and providers already saying that they're not going to support it. And I haven't seen any updates.
00:06:39.766 - 00:07:06.926, Speaker D: In fact, there was something on Twitter that I saw that suggested that there was basically zero client work that has gone in. And maybe you've got the miners, but then you just got miners who are mining something and nobody can actually use it. So I probably paid the chances of this greater than 50% not working and not being live for much longer than it starts out as I don't know. I don't know if you guys have a different perspective, but I'm not very long ETH POW.
00:07:07.038 - 00:07:17.910, Speaker C: It's tough to find someone who is, honestly. Let me ask you guys this. Are you guys doing any of this, what do you call advanced, like cute business or whatever? Are you guys positioning it? I don't know. Slippery business.
00:07:17.980 - 00:07:20.440, Speaker B: I like yours though. Cute businesses, cute business.
00:07:21.130 - 00:07:39.758, Speaker C: There are a couple of things you can do, right? Like you can pull ETH out of liquidity pools. You can sell your Steeth for ETH. You can unwrap your wrapped ETH. You can move your ETH off of an exchange and into a ledger or something because you don't know if the exchange is actually going to give you the proof of work token if obviously it happens. So are you guys doing any of that?
00:07:39.924 - 00:08:48.734, Speaker A: We can't really talk about the stuff that we have in flight. What we can say is that we're not optimizing for getting more proof of work ETH, of the things that we could optimize for, doesn't feel like the best thing we could do. We're certainly getting ready for it in terms of if you have any trades on in a liquidity pool that looks like it has this concentration risk. The safest way to play this is just to be out of those. And so we're being mindful of that just from a safety perspective. But yeah, the other side of it is if you get these proof of work tokens, what do you do with like, are you sending them to where like, BitMEX, the futures exchange? Are you sending it to colonial like a dex on the proof of work exchange? The mechanics of getting out of this are going to be very difficult and I think kind of the sleight of hand that makes these airdrops work for a lot of people are a couple. Number one, the exchanges are not going to allow you to claim your proof of work ETH right out of the gate.
00:08:48.734 - 00:09:17.582, Speaker A: Coinbase has said that a number of other staking providers have said that in exchanges. So there's going to be kind of this artificial supply limitation for people who are just holding ETH on exchange, which is the vast majority of ETH at least that moves. But the people who have it off of a main exchange, they're going to have to make decisions on what to do with it and I think those people will be advantaged in a moment where there's not a lot of supply. So that's kind of like generally how we think it's going to break down, but we're certainly not optimizing for proof of work.
00:09:17.636 - 00:09:34.674, Speaker C: I think these airdrops are going to cause way more harm than they do good and like money, because there will be inevitably more than probably. You remember with bitcoin in 17 2018, there were all these forks, right? It wasn't just like bitcoin cash, it was like bitcoin plus and bitcoin like.
00:09:34.792 - 00:09:36.590, Speaker B: One and bitcoin satoshi's vision.
00:09:36.670 - 00:10:00.834, Speaker C: Satoshi's vision and the SegWit. There's like 20 forks. So yeah, you get the airdrops and obviously you want to sell them immediately. There's going to be a bunch of scam airdrops too, though, so probably inevitable you end up like, let's say I get some POW, I want to sell it. Well, I'm going to have like seven other airdrops in there and a lot of people are going to end up clicking those and just like giving right access to their wallets.
00:10:00.982 - 00:10:56.394, Speaker A: Yeah, be safe, don't mess around with stuff that you don't know what it is. And yeah, we were talking about this before we started recording, but the idea that the amount of open interest on derbit and hedging volume on FTX would suggest that a lot of people are expecting this to be a very meaningful event from just like a raw value perspective. And probably hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars are expected to be kind of claimed and sold from this. That just seems so far out of the realm of reality that I don't think that's possible. And the other thing is this has been a multi year process of kind of not kicking the miners out of the ecosystem but just diminishing their influence. And I think this is kind of like the cresting of that wave where they're going to kind of put up a fight for proof of work ETH, but that's really all they're going to get. And then it's going to be kind of know they get to do bitcoin, but they don't have a lot of sway or influence over the rest of the ecosystem, which is really good, in my opinion.
00:10:56.442 - 00:11:21.374, Speaker C: I will say this is the most positive I've ever seen. Kind of like the mainstream media cover crypto is around the merge, so I think that'll be pretty interesting. Like you're seeing a lot of articles maybe from New York Times or CNN or something from these non crypto pubs be like, this is a step in the right direction for ethereum. They're moving towards a more environmentally friendly thing. So it's actually been interesting to see the mainstream coverage of the think.
00:11:21.432 - 00:12:13.334, Speaker D: I think the big angle here too, just that mainstream loves to latch onto. Even today, I think maybe it was treasury or there was some announcement saying that proof of work, consensus mining algorithms are probably something that might have to get regulated. There was some note of that that I saw on Twitter this morning and I think the ESG narrative is going to be an important one. Frankly, if there's nothing else that anybody who's not aware and kind of paying attention to this industry is going to be able to latch onto, it's going to be ESG because every single time I've heard these arguments it's like, oh well, NFTs they're destroying the planet. It's like, that's absolutely not true, but okay, fine, we've got a solution for that and I think the fact that you can be able to now point to a solution is going to be a huge opportunity and latching onto that I think, is what we need to do as a base layer ethereum community.
00:12:13.532 - 00:12:49.700, Speaker B: I agree with that but with the one caveat of so that note they didn't point to specifically like proof of work, it was just like energy intensive ways of it was there but obviously that refers to proof of work. I would say though, that it's always just been like from just first principles. Thinking about it standpoint, it's a frustrating thing because it's not about the energy consumed, right. It's about the output and what you get for that energy. So I agree. I think it's going to be a big powerful narrative but I also don't love some of the other, especially like layer one blockchains I feel like have been marketed as eco friendly, which I don't love. I just don't like that.
00:12:51.750 - 00:12:56.606, Speaker D: Agreed. But for people who don't get it, it's going to be an easy narrative to latch onto.
00:12:56.798 - 00:13:18.982, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about another narrative, maybe post merge, which is again, credit to hell press who really, I think, was the first one who brought this concept into crypto real yield. So that's a concept that's very familiar to traditional finance when you're talking about the returns that you get from fixed income and bonds. Right? So there's like the nominative yield of something which is what you actually get paid, and then you subtract out inflation.
00:13:19.046 - 00:13:19.226, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:19.248 - 00:13:39.170, Speaker B: It's a more real representation of whether or not you maintain essentially purchasing power. I think Hal was kind of the one who outlined that and applied that concept to ethereum. I know you guys are kind of supporters or kind of buy into this idea. Can you just explain what does real yield mean in the concept of ETH and how is that going to change post merge?
00:13:39.750 - 00:14:24.650, Speaker D: Yeah. So really what's happening right now is there's an inflation rate that is being applied to ethereum, every single block. And I don't know the exact block number off the top of my head, but there's a number of ethereum tokens that are created every single block, every 13 to 15 seconds. What that leads to is an inflation rate of somewhere in the three to percent four right now. And you can think of that as being the necessary component of the value ecosystem. That goes to compensate the miners who are running these proof of work change. As we just discussed, energy intensive have to be able to subsidize the cost of running massive server farms essentially that suck up a lot of electricity, cost money, et cetera, et cetera.
00:14:24.650 - 00:15:19.134, Speaker D: Additionally, the hardware cost of actually running. That what changes with proof of work, obviously, is you move from a proof of proof of stake is that you move away from the proof of work, the amount of cost that goes into it drops. So therefore the amount that you need to pay the security budget drops as well. Generally, the concept that Hal is talking about is this change when you move from a high inflationary rewarding mechanism to something that is actually potentially deflationary is really the mechanism that he's talking about. So as a staker, there's the possibility based on throughput that you actually ultimately end up having less ethereum at the end of the year than you started. So that's one component of it. The other component of it is after EIP 1559, you have 80 90% of the transaction fees being burned to increase the amount of deflation that's going on in the ethereum network.
00:15:19.134 - 00:15:59.418, Speaker D: Well, all of this leads to this component of what's the actual yield that you're getting. And his theory, which I think is accurate, is that the yield that you can get by staking a token is the inflationary is the total yield minus the inflation. And the total yield could be whatever it is post merge. But when you have a reduction in inflation, you increase the amount of total yield. And we've seen a ton of other staking opportunities. We've all seen them throughout the industry where you've got massive staking yield. But that staking yield is being subsidized by inflationary rewards and it's just the separation of the concept of what's real versus what's nominal.
00:15:59.418 - 00:16:02.958, Speaker D: I think that's really kind of the key point to hit on here.
00:16:03.124 - 00:16:36.694, Speaker A: The things that are important to think about when you think about ETH and real yield are kind of their counterparts in both the equity and bond world. So in the equity world, obviously you're getting paid for some stocks at least. For instance, Meta doesn't pay a dividend. They have a stock buyback. And that's going to be probably, I think, like $40 billion this year. But they're also issuing 2020 $5 billion of new stock per year. And so some of it's kind of like your ownership increasing, some of it's decreasing, but Meta doesn't have a yield.
00:16:36.694 - 00:17:25.386, Speaker A: So there really is it's apples to oranges there. And if you think about Treasuries like the ten year or the two year or whatever auctions they have going, it's the real yield of those Treasuries, but they're selling more of those at auctions every single week. And so there is this concept in most other asset classes, but Ethereum is the one that's the most unique because it's on a block by block basis. It's super transparent, but you also have the potential of this thing getting much larger in the future. And so for a lot of people, I think the real yield of whatever it is, six 7% is exciting. But I think the opportunity for that to be like a quasi venture bet as well is unique. When you look at every other asset class and the dynamics of both supply and potential deflation, I guess just to.
00:17:25.408 - 00:18:05.960, Speaker B: Put it in super simple Bell Curvy type languages, basically, if you think about it from the DAP kind of layer, the inflation, right, is basically that's just customer acquisition costs, right? You're basically giving away ownership tokens of your platform and you're generating something that looks like a yield from that. But if the inflation rate is higher than the yield that you generate, then your owners or stakers of that platform are basically losing value on a year over year basis. And I guess the good parts about bear markets in general is like, okay, there's less hype and excitement and just like FOMOing into stuff. So now it's the time to actually think about generating real sustainable value. And that's Kane's whole kind of push with real fees as well.
00:18:06.330 - 00:19:03.450, Speaker D: Exactly. But maybe to go back real quick, I think one component that's important here as well is there's obviously the concept of real and nominal yield and the financial theoretic version of what your asset is worth versus the discounted cash flows versus the ownership percentage that you have and what have you. I think the other component that's really important to note here is that when you have inflationary yield and you're adding more assets to the tradable amount of assets that are in the ecosystem. To also take HAL's point is that the flows and the supply and demand of these assets fundamentally change as well. When there are more inflationary rewards tokens, sure you're earning those and maybe they're locked, maybe they're not locked, depending on the protocol, but if you're earning those tokens, eventually that just means that there's going to be more supply to sell. And so even if it's just theoretical on one end, I think there is a structural component to it, which is the flows.
00:19:03.790 - 00:19:20.302, Speaker B: Can you actually break that down a little bit? Exactly. Which part? Because price is just a function of supply and demand in general. Right. And flows kind of describe more like the demand side of that. So I'm actually not exactly sure I follow. How does the flows kind of relate to what we're talking about here?
00:19:20.436 - 00:20:13.134, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think your point is a good one in that the inflationary reward to be thought of as customer acquisition costs and you need to have sort of a top sticker price to incentivize people to join an ecosystem. Jonah protocol, state trade, whatever the incentive model is. And I think that that's important at the beginning. In the same way that Uber subsidized the car rides in San Francisco here for a couple of years at least when they started with Uber X, I remember it was like 250 to go across the city. And you can kind of think of it in the same way. Eventually you have to get to a point where they're charging enough and their take rate is high enough to where Uber, the company can make enough money. And in terms of the flows, if you have consistently unit economic negative transactions going on, you're going to ultimately end up losing money.
00:20:13.134 - 00:20:33.800, Speaker D: And the way that that comes through is you're going to have more people, additionally you're going to have more people who have these assets who are going to be able to sell them on the market. And so it may look nice and get users involved initially, but eventually it's going to be something that you have to move away from. Otherwise you're not going to build a sustainable model.
00:20:34.330 - 00:20:36.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I get you on that.
00:20:36.412 - 00:21:19.918, Speaker A: Kind of going from not like a deeply unprofitable tech company, but like a slightly unprofitable tech company to a very profitable tech company. And that's kind of the structure that drives the flow. Because if Ethereum was a tech company and it was deeply unprofitable and had no assets, they're just basically selling more ETH into the market to keep itself going and now they're just stopping. And so there's just less sellers and there's less sellers by 18,000 ETH per day, which is meaningful. We've talked about this before, but we think probably there's like a one to 25 ratio of fundamental flow to quant flow. So that matters when you think about that in that context.
00:21:20.094 - 00:21:52.560, Speaker B: What's just funny to me about this whole discussion is ETH's been around for seven or whatever years now, so it'd be very logical to be like, okay, this is the time in the lifecycle of the company where you want to transition from being deeply unprofitable to, like, we want to think from just growth at all costs to unit economics. Right. That's like a super traditional framework or way to think about it. I feel like if you pulled the rest of the world, like, how risky ETH is and where it should be in its lifecycle, they would have a very different thought. So actually, in a way, this is almost like getting ahead of the curve, right?
00:21:52.930 - 00:22:27.130, Speaker D: Yes. Yes. But it's not the same. It's not like they're going through this process to become profitable. That would be how you look at something like an Uber who's looking to go public per se, who needs to have positive unit economics so you can get the valuation for your next fundraiser, your IPO, whatever it is. The thing about Ethereum, which is unique, is that the technology is changing. This is a move in the positive direction for the protocol so that you can enable further developments, like all the things that are on the stealing roadmap, like Sharding, a proof of stake network is a requirement to move in that direction.
00:22:27.130 - 00:22:42.058, Speaker D: It's both and in a really unique way, where you have this implicit change in the unit economics, but you also have the positive direction of the technology. And that and the second point is actually leading the first, which is unique.
00:22:42.234 - 00:22:59.140, Speaker B: Interesting. Do you see the concept of real yield? Does that apply to non L1s like ETH? Would you use a very similar framework to look at adapt or, like, adapt chain, basically? Can you kind of borrow that concept and apply it to non L1s?
00:22:59.830 - 00:23:24.974, Speaker C: Couldn't you apply it to any app or protocol? Right? Any real yield? Can you apply it to non crypto things too, or is this why? I mean, Meltham tweeted that thing, and then how was like, this is really dumb, but I think she was basically just saying, you have the inflation rate. You have Treasuries at 3%, inflation at 8%. So the real yield is negative five. Howe was like, this is an incredibly dumb tweet. I don't know why. I'm too middle of the bell curve to know why it was a dumb tweet. But can't you apply this concept to anything?
00:23:25.172 - 00:24:04.614, Speaker A: I didn't see the tweet. But the thing that's unique about L1s is that they have to pay for security, and if they don't have that, they're cooked. When you think about DApps, they don't have this fundamental blockchain security need. At least they don't need to pay for it in their own native currency. And so they kind of are, by default, more profitable than your average L1 just because they don't have as many costs I think your average all L1 probably has more users than your average DAP at this point. But I think that's going to change. And yeah, I think there's always been the question of like, okay, you cool, you have this DAP.
00:24:04.614 - 00:24:22.938, Speaker A: What do you do with the inflation and those decisions around? What do you do with it feel more like how do you spend your growth, marketing budget at a tech company that's small to medium sized than how do you rearchitect this new asset class, this new kind of technology paradigm?
00:24:23.034 - 00:24:54.438, Speaker D: It's like in games, in digital game ecosystems. What it ultimately comes down to in mobile in particular, but somewhat web based as well, is that it comes down to LTV minus CAC and that lifetime value, minus customer acquisition cost. And that is more of the equation, I think, when we're talking about DApps in particular to Vance's point. But ultimately we're getting to the same conclusion here, which is you just have different variables flowing into LTV and different variables flowing into cache, whether it's adapt.
00:24:54.454 - 00:25:18.814, Speaker A: Or it's base layer. Yeah, it follows that you're going to have a lot few like in ten years, you're going to have a lot fewer L1s that are profitable than you will DAPs. The DAPs just have much less cost. It's much harder to get to the critical mass of users that's required to sustain an L1. From a security perspective. And even look at Bitcoin, it's huge. It has a ton of users.
00:25:18.814 - 00:25:54.480, Speaker A: The market cap is gigantic right now. It doesn't have enough fees to secure its future long term. And so I think we're really going to see the consolidation around kind of like Cain's Point, I think is particularly relevant to the DAP sector. But I think you're going to see the consolidation in the L One sector as well, because 20 years from now, let's just pick on Harmony. Who's going to want to subsidize the cost of running those validators. It's like non trivial, especially if you're underwater on them. It's probably going to be like the foundation, the investors, that's probably it.
00:25:54.480 - 00:26:00.494, Speaker A: And a lot of them will shut down or just use ETH as security layer as a result. That's my guess at least.
00:26:00.532 - 00:26:03.760, Speaker B: You guys see Suey raised $300 million.
00:26:04.470 - 00:26:05.780, Speaker A: Congrats, everybody.
00:26:11.190 - 00:26:22.294, Speaker B: All right, I think that concludes this section here. Let's talk about the Coinbase institutional maker partnership. Yana, I know we were talking about this before. You want to lead us through what this is? What's going on?
00:26:22.332 - 00:26:24.280, Speaker D: Yeah, give us a good description of it.
00:26:24.810 - 00:26:46.186, Speaker C: Not a bad one. Don't fuck this up. It's pretty simple. So Maker has this thing called the PSM. There's like $5.2 billion of USDC in the PSM, coinbase prime, which is their institutional team. They bought Togomi and created this institutional team, and that's Coinbase Prime.
00:26:46.186 - 00:27:08.550, Speaker C: Now, Coinbase made a proposal for Maker to transfer 33% of the USDC out of Maker's PSM. So that's $1.6. Billion out of the PSM into coinbase. Prime's custody. The reason they would do this, the reason this is good for Maker is this would give them one and a half percent yield on that USDC. So one and a half percent yield on $1.6 billion is $24 million.
00:27:08.550 - 00:27:16.002, Speaker C: So that's 24 mil in additional revenue that Maker could be earning. And that's the proposal.
00:27:16.066 - 00:27:25.578, Speaker D: So one point of clarification, I think is like, what is the PSM and basically what is the USDC doing right now?
00:27:25.744 - 00:27:42.480, Speaker C: The USDC sits there and serve acts as collateral for basically the die. And the thought is that it earns no yield. So, yeah, one of my pushbacks on the forum, I was like, 1.5% feels low. And they're like, well, until we have a better strategy, 1.5% is better than zero.
00:27:43.090 - 00:27:54.162, Speaker B: It's fair. Aren't there two buckets as well, Jason, for that USDC? There's the USD. It's like Protocol owned USDC. Right. And then there are customer deposits. And this is only for the USDC that Maker owns, right?
00:27:54.216 - 00:28:24.358, Speaker C: Correct. Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, if you look at the balance sheet of Maker right now, it's like liability. Like Dai is the liabilities and then the assets are the PSM and the user vault. So the PSM is like the maker owned assets and Maker can invest those assets and that's like Dai is collateralized by those assets. And then there's the user vaults and users own those assets and the Maker protocol can't touch them. So basically Liabilities is Dai assets is the PSM and the user vaults.
00:28:24.358 - 00:28:48.498, Speaker C: What this would say is that on the asset side you have two buckets. It's the PSM and the user vaults. This would kind of create like a third bucket. So you'd have Dai as the liabilities. And then the third bucket would be you have user vaults, the PSM and then you have what Maker folks think of as safe instruments. So this would be like things that generate yields, very small amount of yield, highly liquid, like liquid within a couple of minutes. And that would be like short term.
00:28:48.514 - 00:28:50.680, Speaker B: Data treasuries, for example, like three month.
00:28:52.010 - 00:29:18.122, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the biggest concern with this deal is like, where is Coinbase generating the yield? Because if they're doing something that feels safe, like kind of similar to T bill investing, like, that's probably fine, that's a good thing, whatever. If it's something like unsecured lending to crypto market makers, that's probably not a good thing. And I probably wouldn't vote for that. So I think that's the unanswered thing is where does Coinbase generate this yield?
00:29:18.186 - 00:29:33.300, Speaker D: I mean, maybe even like a more umbrella question is like, what's the benefit here to Coinbase? Which is kind of the same thing, right? How would they use this USDC? How would they generate in addition to the 24 that they have in costs, how would they make a spread on that?
00:29:33.830 - 00:29:43.350, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like any bank. It's like they give out one and a half percent and they're going to make more than 1%. One and a half percent? That's what I was going to say. It's a bank.
00:29:45.130 - 00:29:50.106, Speaker B: Well, it's a net interest market. Business is what they're making spread on that.
00:29:50.208 - 00:29:52.602, Speaker C: Vance I feel like the last time.
00:29:52.656 - 00:30:43.738, Speaker A: We played this game, we broke basically everything in crypto. So I think there's always a question of what they're doing with this money. And I hope they're just putting it into T bills or like the ten year, which is like yielding 3.4%. I hope they're not just like turning around and lending this on or no collateral basis to funds. Probably it's a mix, like at the end of the day. But the reason I like this proposal for Maker specifically is because it helps its regulatory resilience. Like, if Coinbase is holding all the USDC and then the Treasury Department sanctions the PSM, the Maker contract apparatus, you now have to kind of deal with Coinbase as well.
00:30:43.738 - 00:31:11.730, Speaker A: That USDC came from Maker. It ropes Coinbase into their corner and makes them kind of play defense on their behalf. So I really do like that. It's also kind of like a lightweight version of the Rune proposal that he put forward two weeks ago. He's talking about getting a bunch of ETH and going yield farming with it. This is like, all right, let's just send the USDC to Coinbase and generate 1.5%. So it feels like a decent middle ground.
00:31:11.730 - 00:31:33.606, Speaker A: But again, Maker has this I can't tell if it's really good or really bad governance, where it seems like a million things are happening at the same time and it's kind of like going off in all these different directions. What part of the Phoenix Max decentralization playbook is like sending all your USDC to Coinbase? Yeah, some of it feels a little bit conflicting.
00:31:33.638 - 00:32:23.258, Speaker D: I was going to say this feels like total at ODS to Rune's proposal based on that last point in general, I mean, this is like literally the opposite direction, which is let's go more in the put the stuff into centralized custodians. And just one comment on Coinbase in general, we use Coinbase at Framework and they are really upstanding in terms of their relationships with their lenders and providers and customers partners. I would not be nearly as concerned with this type of lending as I would be something historically at least like the celsius stuff that has been unraveling. So I'm not nearly as concerned about us playing the same game again. But I think the big point here is that this and we're going to see how people view it, but this is in the total opposite direction to Rune's post in my mind.
00:32:23.344 - 00:33:03.730, Speaker C: But isn't Rune's post. He's like, for the next three years, there's one North Star now accumulate as much ETH as humanly possible and we can do things that aren't as decentralized, like bring on real world assets. Basically. My reading of Rune's thing his updated one last week or two weeks ago was like do anything humanly possible to get as much crypto native collateral as possible, as much ETH as possible. Then in three years we can pull things back. Now I don't think things will actually get pulled back in three years, but I think that's like the North Star in his mind. And by the way, USDC, they're already using real world USDC is just a wrapper on T bills.
00:33:03.730 - 00:33:08.018, Speaker C: So you already have these T bills.
00:33:08.194 - 00:33:41.646, Speaker A: It'd be cool to have T bills on chain or like ten year notes on chain. Not synthetically because that's basically illegal, but a real representation of them. The problem that they're trying to solve here is maker can't talk to the outside world. They need someone to do it on their behalf. And I think that's a pretty profitable position for Coinbase to be in. Same with all of these other centralized exchanges, just the amount of capital creation that's going to happen in crypto is going to be quite large and then interfacing with the traditional world is going to be a big opportunity. I think this is like a move that fits with Rune's Proposal.
00:33:41.646 - 00:34:03.594, Speaker A: It's a very light version, but it gives them room to expand it where what if they send Coinbase like a billion die in a year? Coinbase now has to go out and defend die and in the same case as Tornado cash like go bankroll lawsuits. And you generally want the most finance player to be fighting the biggest battles and that's certainly not Maker and it certainly is Coinbase. And so I really like, I agree.
00:34:03.712 - 00:34:38.974, Speaker D: You know, to go back to this, that it is a timing thing and it's not necessarily ultimately at ODS with the Rune post, but to one of the things that Vance kind of touched on. But to bring it back is like who signs the legal agreement on behalf of Maker? It's not like you're going to have a lending agreement with Coinbase without some sort of legal agreement or some sort of agreement in general. Is every single maker holder expected to vote and sign their name on the dotted line? There's all the details of how you bridge digital on chain with something that's centralized off chain that are yet to be discovered.
00:34:39.102 - 00:35:07.918, Speaker C: Yeah, I think within these Dows, I will say any Dow you dig deep enough, there's usually one or two people behind this. So you dig into this proposal and it's the Growth team. So there are teams at Makers and they're like full time employees who work on those teams. And so this was the Growth Team. And specifically within the Growth team, I think it was this woman, Jen, who on the Growth team who did this deal. Not very different than a blockwork salesperson going out and selling Coinbase on a sponsorship deal or something.
00:35:07.924 - 00:35:16.494, Speaker D: You have a seller, but it is very different in that this is like legal structure question one of the biggest.
00:35:16.542 - 00:35:39.858, Speaker C: DAOs out there, like one of the biggest DeFi protocols. We were going to sign a contract with them for something and they were like, we can't sign the contract because we have to turn into like a C Corp and we're going through that process now. I was like, interesting, wow, not a Dow. They're like, no, we're still going to keep our name like the X Dow.
00:35:40.034 - 00:35:42.620, Speaker B: We have this new idea for you.
00:35:43.630 - 00:36:29.562, Speaker C: They're like, it became too big of an issue to sign contracts and it was really preventing our growth. But I think that's right there and this maker thing and all this, this is the most important question in crypto right now. This is the biggest dichotomy is like the people who are basically saying everything needs to stay super decentralized, create censorship resistant platforms at the sacrifice and detriment of maybe expanding your market and gaining market share and things like that. And then the other folks are maybe saying like, okay I'm a Dow but man, my market share is 10%. I could be like 50% by the end of this bear if I just centralized a little more, created permissioned pools and created a C Corp and those are very at ODS with each other and you're seeing that pop up every single week all over the space.
00:36:29.696 - 00:36:59.730, Speaker A: This also may be like more of a bear market phenomenon where the tenure is yielding more than basically in the bear market. You see higher yields outside, you see capital outflows but not really. There have been a lot of stablecoin redemptions but there's still a ton of them in the bear market. You just see the opposite in the bull market you see the opposite. You see the capital flow. Like in the bull market. Maker was not sending USDC to Coinbase that's for sure.
00:36:59.730 - 00:37:06.514, Speaker A: So some of these things can pass as know you stay in crypto long see you know, the seasons change.
00:37:06.552 - 00:37:29.482, Speaker B: I thought that was a funny like because a year ago everyone was talking about yield being the Trojan horse that was going to draw capital into crypto and now the business model has essentially flipped into importing TradFi yields into crypto which is just like a funny complete flipping of that narrative. But maybe that's just a temporary bear market thing because it makes sense. Like crypto is higher growth. It should have higher yields I would think.
00:37:29.616 - 00:37:36.160, Speaker D: Well I mean this goes back to real versus nominal yield. How much of those yields in the bull market were real?
00:37:37.810 - 00:37:39.626, Speaker B: But even in tradfights like deeply negative.
00:37:39.658 - 00:37:58.546, Speaker C: Real yields by the way, they're putting this money into three month T bills I think it is. The three month T bill is at like 2.9%. So Coinbase is basically that's a 1.4% spread that they're making 14 million.
00:37:58.648 - 00:37:59.010, Speaker A: Whatever.
00:37:59.080 - 00:37:59.894, Speaker C: Call it a day.
00:38:00.012 - 00:38:01.206, Speaker A: Yeah, call it a day.
00:38:01.228 - 00:38:01.766, Speaker B: Not bad.
00:38:01.868 - 00:38:02.278, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:02.364 - 00:38:48.982, Speaker B: Do you guys think there was an article of Financial Times did an article a little while ago. It was like the title of the article was Stablecoin Issuers Hold $80 Billion Worth of Short dated US. Government Debt. And they had this little chart of like the biggest holder of T bills. It was pretty funny to see like Circle was above Berkshire Hathaway on that chart, which is pretty wild, actually. But do you guys think that's a positive or a negative thing? Because on the one hand, what I've kind of heard from analysts, like guys like Jim Bianco has made this point that regulators start to be very worried when entities hold that many T bills because what they're worried about is a proverbial run on the bank, so to speak. Right.
00:38:48.982 - 00:39:17.614, Speaker B: What they're really worried about is like, hey, what if basically USDC faces a flood of redemptions and then you have to sell an enormous amount of Treasuries basically. And that's fine. Today even like 80 billion is like a lot. But look at how fast USDC expanded. That could be 500 billion. Or there are money market funds, like a trillion. On the one hand, it could be invite more regulation, but on the other hand, maybe it's like the US.
00:39:17.614 - 00:39:30.434, Speaker B: Government just wakes up and is like, hey, we are planning on running a trillion dollar deficit for the next forever and we need people to buy these bills. So this is actually kind of a convenient thing. You know what mean? Like I kind of see it going either way.
00:39:30.552 - 00:39:33.426, Speaker A: You can buy them, but if you need to sell them, just let us.
00:39:33.448 - 00:39:34.740, Speaker D: Know because give us.
00:39:36.710 - 00:40:14.958, Speaker A: Oh, you're concerned about just high yielding asset and everyone buying it in the underlying liquidity. Sounds kind of familiar. Yeah, I don't think this is like a problem in the next ten years, but I don't know, seeing this year where bonds had their worst year since literally the Civil War in the US. You're like, okay, cool. If this pillar goes, what else are we investing in? Just like, stocks and crypto. How does this work? It's kind of remarkable how little of this has been kind of thought out and planned, especially within the context of massive trade deficits, interest rates rising, and just like QT nuking the liquidity in treasury markets. I don't know, seems like you probably want more people to buy them.
00:40:14.958 - 00:40:32.134, Speaker A: And if they need to sell them, you should probably figure out a way to interface with them instead of just holding them at arm's length and not allowing them to touch the traditional financial system. Because selling 80 billion of spot T bills, I don't know how that goes down. Probably not that smoothly if you need to do it.
00:40:32.252 - 00:41:01.546, Speaker D: I think that last point is the best one in that they're now forced to take you seriously. You have to be someone that they want and need to do business with. And so because of that, they can't stamp you out there's existential threats to them if they were to do something draconian and onerous. And so I think there's that. But then you get taken seriously and everybody's always talking about like, oh, no, regulation. It's going to be terrible. We're going to kill the industry.
00:41:01.546 - 00:41:11.074, Speaker D: Bad regulation will kill the industry. Good regulation could make the industry. And I think that's where we really need to actually be sensible in terms.
00:41:11.112 - 00:41:11.700, Speaker A: Of.
00:41:13.430 - 00:41:28.934, Speaker D: It'S not a black and white situation. And for this industry to grow, as we've seen over the last few months, certain things should have been regulated, probably. And I think we should be at least willing to welcome that if we want to see this thing grow to the size of it. I think we all do.
00:41:29.052 - 00:41:54.510, Speaker B: Side note on regulation, I was listening to this podcast called Acquired. I don't know if you guys ever listen. It's a great podcast. They did this episode on Standard Oil, which everyone should go back and listen to. It's a phenomenal story. But one thing that blew my mind was when John Rockefeller was doing this back in late 1870s, 1880s, it was actually illegal to do business in multiple states. You know that.
00:41:54.510 - 00:42:31.366, Speaker B: How wild is that? So they got around it by doing this thing. They had like a trust and they were like, oh yeah, there's going to be a trust and there are trustees. And the trustees leveraged something called a joint stock company, which no one had leveraged in the 200 years since it got created. And they did all these things that were very not technically in the spirit of the law, but they found this weird and they had to act. And they took pains to make it seem like they were not directors, right of this big thing. Just reminded me very much of how Dows are bending over backwards to appear like they're operating in a different way than they might actually be today. And eventually they broke up Standard Oil.
00:42:31.366 - 00:42:40.240, Speaker B: But then he basically wrote the playbook for what the modern day corporation looks like. So he was kind of right at the end of the day, but there was some friction in between getting from point A to point B.
00:42:41.170 - 00:43:35.422, Speaker A: There's so many funny cases of this over time. Cryptography used to be regarded as a weapon, and we have people on our team who instead of sending their cryptography over to the Internet back in the day, they would print it out and fax it because that was how you could communicate your work with other people. It was illegal to do commerce on the Internet until the late 90s. There were all these bills and all these pieces of regulation that made the Internet and cryptography possible. And this is probably a good segue to the kind of like tornado cash sanctions. This is always how it was going to happen, or the tornado cash lawsuit. This is always how it was going to happen, something was going to be bad, or the administration would regard it as bad, we would fight it with a lawsuit, and win or lose, we're going to have more clarity, and I think I would put more ODS on the winning side.
00:43:35.422 - 00:43:46.898, Speaker A: But that's how we kind of move the industry forward. It's unfortunate that it has to be at the cost of people in jail and stuff like that, but these are the battles that are kind of necessary to fight in order to push the space forward.
00:43:46.984 - 00:44:28.722, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the one thing that people almost treat as a constant or never consider the fact that actually crypto could get so big that we just change a lot of the existing regulation and the way that we think. And that's like I know that sounds a little extreme, but that's like kind of my base case. There's a lot of stuff that I think if people really sat down and thought about, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense the way we do. KYC, there are all these studies about how inefficient it really is. Right. I think actually, after this sell off in the beginning of this year, you look at where a lot of tech giant, huge success stories like Twitter and Snapchat and Pinterest, where they IPOed versus where they're at today. It's like level or down.
00:44:28.722 - 00:44:40.302, Speaker B: It's nuts. So it's like all of that value got created in the private markets, and I just don't think that's fair to be excluding people from. Frankly, I think that changes philosophically.
00:44:40.366 - 00:45:17.230, Speaker D: Agree with you. I think even Brian Armstrong from Coinbase said, and he's been over the course of at least the last four or five years, he's always said, we have the book, we should just operate in the confines of the rulebook. In the last couple of years, or in the last year in particular, I think he's totally changed his tone. We probably need new rules. I don't know if it means we need a new regulator, but you can't put square page into round holes consistently when we're dealing with regulations and laws that existed decades or potentially even centuries ago. We're talking about a new asset class that existed less than ten years ago in earnest.
00:45:17.390 - 00:45:50.666, Speaker A: Yeah. The financial security apparatus is basically transition of the spectrum of safety or opportunity. And there is some truth to the meme of you'll eat the bugs and you'll watch the Netflix, but at least you'll be safe. And your life may not go anywhere, but you're going to be super safe. On the other side of that spectrum is it's kind of open. There's more opportunity, there's more danger you might not be as safe. And we've gone so far over to the side of safety and eating the bugs that I'm hopeful that there's a pendulum swing in the process.
00:45:50.666 - 00:45:55.642, Speaker A: But a lot of this is post 911 Patriot Act, and that's not going anywhere.
00:45:55.786 - 00:46:49.166, Speaker D: That's definitely not going nowhere. But one last thought here is if you just look at DFI and you say, okay, composability, transparency and global access are probably the three biggest components. Tenets of what makes DeFi powerful or the promise of DeFi. You can maintain basically all of that in the same structure as financial services exists today, and have the advantages that make it such that I truly believe that DeFi will ultimately be on the right side of regulatory history here, because it provides a better system for what financial services should enable. Right? If you have transparency, the role of financial oversight is to monitor and guard and protect against opaque financial institutions. Well, if you get rid of the opacity and you add transparency, that's a huge advantage. And I think there's very few people outside of this industry that get that right.
00:46:49.188 - 00:47:17.486, Speaker B: Now I've got one closing question just to bring it back to Maker and then we can move on to because I want to talk about binance and their BUSD, their stable. But what is the you know, from a first principle standpoint, why would someone own and hold Dai? I suppose if it really is something that's just backed by USDC, then isn't it just kind of USDC with extra steps? Like, what's the first principles reason for why Dai should exist? If we go in this route, it's.
00:47:17.538 - 00:47:48.546, Speaker A: Cheaper in terms of if you're like, dai is mostly a stable coin that has a utility for lending. And, like, you get Dai, it's cheaper than Aave, it's cheaper than the centralized desks. So check, there's no receipt. So, like in the US. There's this weird thing where if you get a receipt token, potentially that's like a taxable event. With Maker, there is no receipt token. And so that isn't you're just getting the stablecoin against it.
00:47:48.546 - 00:48:22.314, Speaker A: And so that gives people marginally more confidence. Other than that, they're kind of apples to apples. We kind of most interact with USDC, and I think there's also additional risk of know the roadmap for USDC is pretty clear. The roadmap for Maker is like a million different things on any given day, especially if it stops being not pegged to the dollar. At least we would think differently about putting assets there.
00:48:22.352 - 00:48:45.810, Speaker B: I'd like to give a shout out to Jeremy Alair. Jeremy Alair. Do you remember in 2018, it was like they were the darling. Remember Goldman invested in them. They had Poloniax, they had all these different businesses, and then it was like they're on the down. There was the sheath that got passed around. Their private stock was trading at like 85% discount or something, and they just went all in on this one thing and absolutely crushed it.
00:48:45.810 - 00:48:47.414, Speaker B: So shout out to them.
00:48:47.452 - 00:48:50.914, Speaker A: Legends and CMS came out of prop.
00:48:50.962 - 00:49:03.094, Speaker C: Yeah, they had one of the biggest OTC desks. They had a competitive app to coinbase, like a great retail wallet too. Bought Poloniax. Bought Poloniax. Sold Poloniax.
00:49:03.142 - 00:49:06.666, Speaker B: Yeah, they rented it.
00:49:06.768 - 00:49:09.180, Speaker C: They rented it, flipped it.
00:49:10.750 - 00:49:19.790, Speaker A: The other interesting thing that I've seen from Circle past couple hours, jeremy Alair kind of like teasing that maybe USDC gets into the bridge game.
00:49:19.860 - 00:49:20.394, Speaker C: So smart.
00:49:20.442 - 00:49:28.740, Speaker A: Where it's so smart, right? You just have on either side of the bridge, you can just mint USDC and burn it on the other one.
00:49:29.190 - 00:49:37.730, Speaker C: That's such a no brainer and such an improvement on what it's it's inevitable that Coinbase or Circle or someone gets into the bridging.
00:49:38.070 - 00:50:07.920, Speaker A: I like it. I think Circle is going to know a really awesome company. I do worry about the amount of control that they're getting over the space. If they're dictating our fork choice and also our bridge choice, at some point they're going to be kind of like the financial security apparatus. The line they're walking is so thin. It's like half TradFi half the time, like the other half like your DeFi. Only Jeremy Alair could really do.
00:50:08.930 - 00:50:47.642, Speaker B: Uh, just from a higher level perspective, I don't think that crypto ever gets enormous and successful without at least like the tacit if begrudging approval of the United States. I think you should be building censorship resistant architecture and everything, but we live in a world I don't know. I'm not ready to live 100% in the bits. I don't know. When I leave this podcast, I'm going to be in New York. I don't know. I hear these arguments and I agree with them on a first principles level, but it's also like, I'm a citizen of the US.
00:50:47.642 - 00:51:11.810, Speaker B: Too, and I don't believe they're evil. And I think if we build I really like the framework of being big enough and owning enough treasuries and hey, we're a force to be reckoned with. Take us seriously. And by the way, we're going to kind of do things how we want. Is that cool? I'm not 100% sure we ever get to the full cipher punk vision of entirely. I just don't see really a roadmap for doing that.
00:51:11.880 - 00:51:16.100, Speaker D: Yeah, but Mike, this year, right now in the Bahamas is super nice.
00:51:17.290 - 00:51:19.286, Speaker B: That's true, dude. That's true.
00:51:19.388 - 00:51:22.434, Speaker A: Yeah. What if that vision only works in the Bahamas?
00:51:22.562 - 00:51:26.120, Speaker B: You know, that's not the end of the world either. I guess. That's not.
00:51:26.810 - 00:52:01.810, Speaker A: I'm a believer in the crypto cyberpunk vision of the future. I think it needs to be both. But I think if ETH had gone to ten K at the time of last bull market with the amount of value locked in DFI, and even if it does in the future, that's more than a trillion dollars of value locked in DFI. At some point you just got to call a win a win. We don't need to be like 100 trillion dollar asset class to be considered successful. We can do it because the assets themselves have value and they're experiencing this exponential move in their prices every few years. And people use it as know, we kind of do need them.
00:52:01.810 - 00:52:10.966, Speaker A: We kind of don't need them. I think we can pick our battles, but over the long term, I think the biggest outcome is I mean, I.
00:52:10.988 - 00:53:14.700, Speaker D: Would say probably the best entrepreneurs that we see that are building at least starting in the US. Are basically ready at a moment's notice to pack up and move. And it's just kind of that mentality that you have to have right now because I don't think you could possibly I mean, I'm sure you could come up with one, but it's hard to imagine a more aggressive and detracting regulatory environment in the US right now for crypto or anything related to crypto. And in a lot of ways, rightfully so, especially what's happened over the last couple of months with centralized crypto lending in particular. But that's one bad apple, one bad case and it doesn't represent the entire industry. So right now you kind of have to and that's where this crypto punk version of the future has to exist because that's right now kind of the only logical and viable one. But eventually if we want an order of magnitude higher than what we're talking about or multiple orders of magnitude larger, it's going to have to be something that threads the needle between the two.
00:53:15.710 - 00:53:56.390, Speaker B: I want to get your guys view on finance and then just kind of like the stablecoin space, like writ large. I don't think we've talked on the show about D Five protocols launching their own stables, but just to give you an overview of what happened this week. So starting September 29, binance is automatically converting USDC, USDP and TUSD stablecoin balances into new finance BUSD deposits at a ratio of one to one. They said this is to enhance liquidity and capital efficiency for users. Basically, if you're a user of Binance, you'll still be able to withdraw from your chosen centralized stablecoin, but the amount is just going to be deducted from your BUSD balance.
00:53:57.470 - 00:54:08.678, Speaker A: Notably, can you throw the volume of these pairs up or just like know binance see their biggest mean on the surface?
00:54:08.854 - 00:54:47.640, Speaker D: I know that this kind of got negative feedback and I actually had a couple of people text me and be like, hey, are you worried about like it seems like it's being delisted from Binance. I don't actually read that as being the case. Like I actually think this is a really positive thing because it basically unifies all the trading pairs within Binance against a single asset, which is BUSD. So you don't have the fragmentation, which I think I'm sure we're going to see here in a minute and you're still able to use, deposit and withdraw. All the different stablecoins are just on the platform represented as a different asset. Seems like a positive move.
00:54:48.350 - 00:55:26.558, Speaker A: Yep. I mean, two thoughts. First one is Tether is just like getting taken to the like Tether was always kind of like the Asia stablecoin and what you would trade on binance. When you traded on Binance, BUSD was kind of always this thing where you'd be like, I can use that, maybe I'll get a reduction fees, but generally didn't really care about it. Tether is probably in danger from this in a significant way. And my second thought is this doesn't really matter for USD. My third thought is the ecosystems are fragmenting, right? Western phi is like USDC, Asia.
00:55:26.558 - 00:55:37.106, Speaker A: Czfi is like BUSD and Tether is kind of like in no man's land. But yeah, the ecosystem is fragmenting and this is kind of like one thing that just solidifies that here's.
00:55:37.138 - 00:56:00.800, Speaker C: A weird aspect of this is that BUSD is just white labeled USDP or PUSD basically Paxos's stablecoin. So Binance's stablecoin is just white labeled Paxos stablecoin, which is actually the most regulated stablecoin. So it's the only stablecoin that's regulated by the NYDFS or something. It's got all the regulations because Paxo is deep in with the.
00:56:03.090 - 00:56:03.406, Speaker B: Know.
00:56:03.428 - 00:56:15.106, Speaker C: I feel like Binance is usually kind of a little maybe plays it fast and loose with the regulators, but their stablecoin is actually just this way labeled like highly regulated stablecoin. It's pretty interesting.
00:56:15.208 - 00:56:24.738, Speaker A: It's regulated by NYDFS was like one of the first stablecoins to get their approval. When that happened, I was like, what the hell is going on? But it makes sense now. I didn't know about the Paxos.
00:56:24.834 - 00:56:37.846, Speaker B: I met someone from Paxos at a unrelated dinner party thing the other day. And whenever I meet someone from Crypto, and I was like, oh, Paxos. I was like, hey man, what's going on? Good to hear. Meet someone else who works in Crypto. He's like crypto. No blockchain.
00:56:37.958 - 00:56:41.850, Speaker C: It's like yikes yikes flashback.
00:56:44.130 - 00:56:50.798, Speaker B: Is everything good at Paxos? Raging indictment right there.
00:56:50.964 - 00:57:02.718, Speaker D: This might be like a 3D chess move to move on shore for CZ with Finance. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some interesting tricks up some sleeves.
00:57:02.814 - 00:57:28.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess. I just listened to this podcast on John Rockefeller seeing the whole world through the lens of Standard Oil. Binance is just like this whale that is still just gigantic. Like if you just look at volumes across, like dude, everyone's like, oh, Sam Banquet freed up. No, dude, no one's even close to what finance is doing. And you don't see him on the COVID of magazines and all that shit.
00:57:28.934 - 00:57:38.974, Speaker D: The last twelve months have been the Sam Show. I don't think there's a reason why we haven't heard too much from CZ, but I think we undoubtedly will hear a lot from him.
00:57:39.172 - 00:58:18.330, Speaker A: There's like you'll be in a random city and you'll turn around, it's just like Sam's face right in front of you on like a gigantic billboard or painted on a wall. He's like everywhere. But I think long term those feel like the two that are going to be very competitive with each other. And I think it's going to be awesome to watch them kind of try to maneuver each other I think both have kind of like strategic mistakes recently. Like where's FTX's staked ETH product? Where's Binance's? Or I guess Binance probably has something but isn't quite scaled yet. Where's FTX's stablecoin. Is it coming? There's a lot of stuff that FTX needs to do to even make a dent in finance.
00:58:18.330 - 00:58:22.266, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a bit more of like an optical illusion at this point.
00:58:22.448 - 00:59:02.154, Speaker B: I've got an open question for. Maybe you guys know the answer to this, actually. But when Coinbase had their earnings because the narrative that Brian is trying to push, right, is that we're transitioning away from this transaction based business where the spread that we take is going to fall over a period of time to something that's more like they rolled out. Something like a subscription. But really they had this $150,000,000 line item on their quarterly top line, which was like I forget what they called it, like services or something like that. And basically they didn't actually detail what this was. But I think that's the income that they're generating from their E Staking that you can do on the platform.
00:59:02.154 - 00:59:25.706, Speaker B: But I have a lot of trouble backing into that number, actually, because you can see how much ETH they have and it doesn't really make sense. And I remember that they bought Bison Trails a little while ago and Bison Trails does they're like the back end for Kraken's Staked ETH product. Right? The ETH that you stake on Bison.
00:59:25.738 - 00:59:27.726, Speaker C: Trails is the back end for Kraken staked ETH.
00:59:27.758 - 00:59:31.282, Speaker D: Are you sure that's I'm not sure that that's no, no.
00:59:31.336 - 00:59:35.086, Speaker C: Staked. Staked is the back end for exactly. Because Kraken acquired staked.
00:59:35.118 - 00:59:54.058, Speaker B: Yeah, but that was post. But remember that was post. They already had a staked product at that time. They bought Staked and they integrated it into something. And I'm pretty sure that Bison Trails is interesting. It doesn't matter. The point being, maybe someone can help explain what that line item is.
00:59:54.058 - 01:00:26.100, Speaker B: Because there was also this expense cost that was associated with that revenue, which basically outweighed sam bank. Mcfried in a Psyop, basically pointed this out to everyone and no one really cottoned onto it, but he was basically like, hey, that 150,000,000 of that revenue that they generated here's. $150,000,000 expense that's not associated that's not associated with anything. Yeah. So if anyone could explain, anyone who has any knowledge, I'd be very curious for because I had a lot of trouble backing into that line.
01:00:28.870 - 01:01:11.074, Speaker D: I don't have the answer off the top of my head, nor do I have any information about it. But I think it is interesting to think about the transition that Coinbase is about to go through and thinking through where their long term strategic value is going to be derived from. I'm hard pressed to see it anywhere other than Staking and kind of the services that you could get from Staking and having assets on chain or having assets on the platform. And I know that they've started to roll out CBE. There's discussion around them having sort of an institutional product as well. I think Staking is going to become really the dominant factor here. And they bought bison trails, coinbase cloud.
01:01:11.074 - 01:01:18.870, Speaker D: You know, there's a lot of opportunity here for them to move in the services and sustainable revenue direction in lieu of transaction fees, I think.
01:01:18.940 - 01:01:20.546, Speaker B: Have you guys heard of Alluvial?
01:01:20.658 - 01:01:21.480, Speaker D: We have.
01:01:21.930 - 01:01:33.050, Speaker B: Yeah. So they have that whole partnership, right, that they were supposed to be, and they just kind of rolled out their own alternative to Alluvial, which is like CBE.
01:01:34.030 - 01:01:56.450, Speaker D: Well, I think there is sort of a distinction here. I believe CBE is taking 25% of the rewards and that is sort of the cut that you can expect if you're using CBE. Probably something that is fine for retail to get that CB moniker on your ETH. Probably not something that's going to fly for institutions. I wouldn't be surprised if they're two separate products.
01:01:56.520 - 01:01:57.090, Speaker C: Interesting.
01:01:57.240 - 01:01:58.066, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
01:01:58.168 - 01:02:17.106, Speaker C: Before we move on from FTX or Finance, let me show you guys the traffic differences for the two companies. Just to show you, this is their web traffic. So this is last month. Finance had 90 million visits. FTX had 11 million, which is actually really impressive for FTX.
01:02:17.298 - 01:02:18.338, Speaker A: Yeah, that's impressive.
01:02:18.434 - 01:02:47.380, Speaker C: It's actually higher than I thought it'd be. 17 million unique visitors, which is just nuts. FTX had two, right? Like if you look at the geography, I bet actually if you add Coinbase, I bet Coinbase would be in the lead in the US. And then let's see here's. Coinbase's business, just the US, right? And then actually FTX is bigger than Coinbase and Russia, Turkey, Argentina, Ukraine, everywhere else. But Finance has a 90% market share.
01:02:48.710 - 01:03:16.074, Speaker A: It just goes to show you, you can't just advertise your way to having a global brand. You can get Tom Brady, you can get Matt Damon, you can get whoever you want. But the time in the market and just like your first mover advantage and compounding that, and every single time coinbase is mentioned on CNBC, like ten other people hear about it, I think these are how the rankings are going to stay.
01:03:16.112 - 01:03:16.410, Speaker B: Probably.
01:03:16.480 - 01:03:18.074, Speaker C: My God, look at this number.
01:03:18.112 - 01:03:20.202, Speaker A: Doesn't feel coin market cap.
01:03:20.256 - 01:03:25.840, Speaker C: 140,000,000 last month. So keep in mind, right, remember, Finance owns them, right?
01:03:28.930 - 01:03:52.582, Speaker A: Thinking about Coin market cap versus Finance coin market cap. You go, you check on the website, you see the prices these days, you just usually immediately exit Finance. It's like you're going there, you're logging into your account, you're placing a trade. Like the fact that they have 75% of the volume of coin market cap is wild. It's such like a more engaged project that I would have expected that to be much lower than Coin market.
01:03:52.636 - 01:04:02.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I will say that you can buy your way to success. And FTX, I actually say that too. All measures like pretty freaking successful for how new they've come onto the scene.
01:04:03.950 - 01:04:16.830, Speaker A: Totally. But I think FTX is going to be super successful. It's a question of like, what do you do now that you've done all the things? Do you have Tom Brady jump through a hoop on fire on like 20 seconds.
01:04:21.490 - 01:04:21.854, Speaker B: Full?
01:04:21.892 - 01:04:25.220, Speaker A: Makeout baby, kiss me like a man?
01:04:27.990 - 01:04:29.890, Speaker D: We're definitely keeping all of this.
01:04:30.040 - 01:05:11.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I hear you though. I agree. You know what actually I think is also interesting to draw a distinction between the type of marketing that you can do as a CFI company in crypto versus what would work for a protocol. I think one of the criticisms like yield farming as a customer acquisition strategy is that it's really expensive. But I would argue you couldn't have translated that into just dollars to spend and advertised and got companies to where they were, right? Like the uniswap AirDrop. People love to be like, oh, it's like $150,000,000 or whatever. If they had spent $150,000,000 on advertising, what would that have done? Nothing.
01:05:11.760 - 01:05:13.566, Speaker B: I just don't think it's even possible.
01:05:13.668 - 01:05:19.460, Speaker D: You just hit the nail on the head of the network effects that are derived from tokens. That's the power right there.
01:05:20.310 - 01:05:35.270, Speaker A: It makes sense though. Equity is much more expensive than dollars. So it's kind of like you probably spent like a billion on these airdrops versus the 150,000,000 cash equivalent.
01:05:35.770 - 01:06:41.550, Speaker D: Yeah, I think one thing just to kind of tie some of the previous points together, one thing that will differentiate between the know coinbase FTX binance going forward is product differentiation. If you have the ability to have certain assets, certain products that others don't in certain geographies, that will be a distinct advantage. And now they're all three large enough to have enough captive audience to be able to have something that scales. Let's say you can start trading options on securities on us. I don't know if that's in the roadmap, but let's just say you can do that, right? That changes the dynamic of FTX because all the people who potentially want Robinhood access now just go to FTX because you can get a better service, better product there. That I think is the differentiating part going forward. But if you really break it down, who's going to be best positioned to be able to go after these opportunities? Is it the one that's based in the regulatory unfriendly us and trying to work with regulators or the one that's based offshore that has the ability to operate freely or not freely, but a little bit more like there's a distinct advantage?
01:06:41.890 - 01:07:33.260, Speaker B: You know, what else was a telling? I thought it was very interesting the way that BlockFi versus Celsius got treated by regulators. This is supposed to be the strategy, right? If you do everything by the book, then the regulators should if you're sitting down, like making a strategy for this, then the regulator should call you be like, hey, seems like you guys are putting in best effort. We don't really get this space. What should the rules be? And you would ideally be able to help influence what those rules are. And it seems like Blockfly was basically trying to take that tack and strategy and do everything by the book. And Celsius was just kind of like YOLOing into yield plot, like, no pretense of being regulated or doing anything by the books whatsoever. And how did it work out for those two strategies? Blockfly got $100 million slap on the wrist, which was actually a huge deal for them at a time when they really probably needed that money.
01:07:33.260 - 01:07:42.750, Speaker B: I guess Celsius blew up because it was Celsius, but you know what I mean? They kind of got punished for doing the right thing, so to speak. So what's the incentive?
01:07:43.570 - 01:07:45.940, Speaker A: Blockfly wishes they had that $100 million.
01:07:48.710 - 01:07:53.278, Speaker D: This doesn't always apply, but sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
01:07:53.454 - 01:07:59.126, Speaker C: I know we've been doing this for a while. I want to get your guys to take on the So Rare thing. Can we talk about that?
01:07:59.228 - 01:08:38.322, Speaker D: Yes. Oh, man. Let's bring it back to the pre framework days. So context for those that maybe don't know. Vance and I, prior to starting Framework, started an NFT platform called Hashleets that I think was the first major IP rights holder for a Blockchain based digital collectible. We signed a contract with the NFL PA and had digital collectibles NFTs representing NFL players in 2018 and 2019. I'd say there's a lot of lessons from that experience which we don't need to get into here.
01:08:38.322 - 01:09:34.178, Speaker D: One of them is the IP rights process. And what happened this week, which is hilarious that everybody seems so surprised by, it so Rare, who's been historically an EPL English Premier League focused platform for their NFT platform, started to get into the MBA and taking some share and some of the IP probably IP value, let's say, from other existing NBA partners. And this is exactly how the IP rights usually play out. And we saw this firsthand with the way that our deal was struck. There were multiple players, multiple deals that were made. We were the only one that ended up signing it. And historically, the way that it works is you have multiple rights holders for the same category, usually in the, like, three to five range, but not more than that.
01:09:34.178 - 01:09:52.330, Speaker D: And then over time, they whittle it down and eventually have an exclusive contract. This is, I think, just at least from our experience, what we would have expected to happen exactly is the way that it did, but unfortunate for those that had assets on other platforms that they thought they had exclusivity.
01:09:52.670 - 01:10:39.158, Speaker A: Yeah, if you're a user and you think about the physical cards, like the Tops cards, the baseball cards, versus the Panini baseball cards, there's a chance that in ten years, maybe Panini doesn't and they're one of the cards companies. Or maybe Tops doesn't review their license. Great news, you still got the physical card sitting in your shoebox. It probably gets more valuable because it's been discontinued. You have the NFT, they don't have the rights to those pictures anymore. Those colors, those players, all of the on field photography, those just have to go to zero and you have to make the cards. So, you know, it feels like the legacy IP holders and the decentralized collectible movement are just like fundamentally at ODS because one party just doesn't really get it.
01:10:39.158 - 01:11:03.360, Speaker A: And I think there's good reason, right? You don't want to just license your IP in perpetuity to somebody. And so I think that's the reason that all of the IP that we think is the most valuable has to be created by people that are in crypto, a startup, like a larger company. But that's where all the interesting long term stuff is going to come from. Like the crypto punks. Nobody's ever going to tell you that you don't own your crypto punk again. That's the difference.
01:11:04.130 - 01:11:26.182, Speaker B: Just because I guess this is coming to the forefront in a whole bunch of way, just talking about IP. If you guys had to divide out value creation in between the IP itself and then all of the work that goes into propagating the IP, right? So like building an infrastructure to invest in and buy more IP, distribute that IP, whatever, how would you break out the value there?
01:11:26.316 - 01:11:28.486, Speaker D: I guess what do you mean by that example?
01:11:28.668 - 01:12:21.834, Speaker B: The point I'm trying to get at is a lot of the I guess what I'm thinking about is I guess what I was thinking a lot about recently is like pseudoswap. So pseudo did their token. We don't need to talk about it's not important. But it is this whole narrative right now of are NFTs, JPEGs or Altcoins with pictures? Or is this like a new way for artists to monetize their IP? And I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding. Like IP is really important, like the stuff that you create, but then there's an enormous amount of work and value that gets created by investing in building new IP and then distributing that IP. And I think a lot of the argument that's taking place right now is just based off of a lack of understanding of the work that goes into curating, investing and building new IP, basically. So that's why I was kind of trying to get your sense of like, let's say you're trying to value Disney as a business.
01:12:21.834 - 01:12:31.942, Speaker B: Like how much is their IP portfolio versus the infrastructure that goes around that IP? That you make a park right out of the idea of Mickey Mouse. Basically.
01:12:32.096 - 01:13:10.120, Speaker A: If you think about the physical baseball card market, for instance, the value is divided into two pieces. There's the value creation, all the stuff that happens on the field with the players, their popularity, the sports popularity. And then there's the distribution, which is basically panini. And Tops have relationships with all the card expos and all the card trading shops and the NFL and the NBA and the MLB are not set up to do that. They don't want to do that. And so the value is kind of mostly created on the field, but there's a substantial chunk of it that sits with the distributors. In crypto, the distributors basically have no value.
01:13:10.120 - 01:13:56.390, Speaker A: You have a bilateral connection with your user. I can send them tokens, I can send them NFTs, I can message them. There is nobody that can shut off my access to that person if I'm a brand. And so that's why NFTs in my mind are able to charge and give back to the artist. Such a large percentage is because the distributors have just been cut out. And do I think pseudoswap is an anthem to the NFT movement? Kind of the whole idea is enough value should be created and captured by the creator to give them some sort of share. So I wouldn't be surprised to see other markets that are more vertical kind of like take a hard stance on this in terms of opinion and just try to curate folks that really respect and want that both from the artist and customer side.
01:13:56.460 - 01:14:45.810, Speaker D: I'll kind of take maybe a slightly separate perspective or different perspective in that you have gotten rid of the distributors or frankly, like the base layer blockchains are now the distributors and the users pay for them directly. So get that out of the value chain. But what has changed is you've basically shifted all of that towards what's the utility of these assets. In the case of So Rare, they built this game and they're building more games and supposedly you're going to be able to use these NBA NFTs in the games that they're building. That was also the case for us with Hashley. We built like a fantasy football game that you could collect and buy, sell and trade these NFTs so that you could play them and win more in the game. I think you kind of have to shift from just having these be static collectibles that either increase or decrease in value over time to being something that has to have its value derived basically from pure utility.
01:14:45.810 - 01:15:12.240, Speaker D: And utility comes from the software that the NFT has itself, the creators ability to integrate it into applications that they build, or basically the potential to have integrations outside of the ecosystem. And so the portability or the overlapping of other applications I think is an important one. But it does shift. It's not necessarily the supplier, it's more of the functionality that is imbued within the NFT that drives the value.
01:15:13.010 - 01:15:15.918, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have much to add to this. Does anyone have Plays of the Week.
01:15:16.004 - 01:15:16.898, Speaker A: Tweets of the Week?
01:15:16.984 - 01:15:18.034, Speaker C: Memes of the week.
01:15:18.152 - 01:15:18.962, Speaker B: Memes of the week.
01:15:19.016 - 01:15:27.126, Speaker C: I have a meme. I created it while we I went silent for like ten minutes, made it because I was creating a meme. Yeah. Hold on. How'd we do?
01:15:27.228 - 01:15:27.986, Speaker A: Kim the goat.
01:15:28.018 - 01:15:29.110, Speaker C: Kim the goat.
01:15:30.810 - 01:15:32.182, Speaker A: A lot of text on this one.
01:15:32.236 - 01:15:35.000, Speaker C: A lot of text. Too much text for the meme. Yeah.
01:15:35.770 - 01:15:37.240, Speaker D: So accurate, though.
01:15:37.770 - 01:15:40.198, Speaker A: I like it. I like it. I'm trying to think of other I.
01:15:40.204 - 01:15:54.734, Speaker C: Was trying to fit some, like, middle of the bell curve meme in there. There was also did you guys see this hilarious video? This guy saw Hill Bloom tweeted this video of the first astronauts, the outtakes of the astronauts. Do you see this?
01:15:54.772 - 01:15:55.360, Speaker B: No.
01:15:55.890 - 01:16:00.906, Speaker C: This is amazing. This is outtakes of NASA astronauts trying to walk on the moon.
01:16:01.018 - 01:16:02.800, Speaker D: Oh, I've seen this before. Yeah.
01:16:05.270 - 01:16:07.394, Speaker C: It'S so good. It's so good.
01:16:07.512 - 01:16:11.966, Speaker B: I thought the moon landing was faked. I thought this was a Stanley Kubrick production.
01:16:12.078 - 01:16:15.410, Speaker D: I have it on good authority from the Internet.
01:16:17.590 - 01:16:20.734, Speaker C: I mean, the moon does look pretty flat here, Mike.
01:16:20.782 - 01:16:49.066, Speaker B: You got, like, play? I don't have a meme of the week. My play of the week is, um I think it's respect to Kim for starting the private equity fund. I also think it's respect to the Carlisle guy who went out on a limb and did this. Because if it doesn't work, everyone's going to be like, yeah, dude, you started a fund with have respect. I just have respect for the entire endeavor. I think I love it. I wish them both success, honestly.
01:16:49.066 - 01:16:50.366, Speaker B: That's why it's cool.
01:16:50.388 - 01:16:54.158, Speaker A: She's doing in the bear market, too. That's super base.
01:16:54.244 - 01:16:56.286, Speaker D: That's how you know she's savvy agree.
01:16:56.468 - 01:17:02.254, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, fellas, I think we can call it there fun. See you same time next week.
01:17:02.452 - 01:17:05.220, Speaker C: Take it easy, SA.
