00:00:26.730 - 00:00:32.854, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. You got Michael's, one and two, vance and Yano fellas, welcome.
00:00:33.052 - 00:00:35.138, Speaker C: What's up, Mike?
00:00:35.154 - 00:00:42.010, Speaker A: You've got your podcast voice. All right, everyone, welcome back. It goes like one deeper.
00:00:42.670 - 00:00:47.260, Speaker D: We should record 1 minute earlier, one week just so that we can see the change.
00:00:48.510 - 00:00:55.118, Speaker B: Yeah, I've got a little bit of Elizabeth Holmes syndrome going on. Honestly, the best podcast would be I.
00:00:55.124 - 00:01:04.510, Speaker A: Have the Elizabeth Holmes today. I'm really trying to bring out Elizabeth Holmes in me. Exactly.
00:01:04.660 - 00:01:13.620, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a little bit of a little bit of job scene vibes there. All right, Michael, let's answer this on camera here. Why do you think the content at Netflix is not good?
00:01:14.550 - 00:01:17.954, Speaker D: Well, I was going to say we have someone who used to work in Netflix. He's probably got perspectives.
00:01:18.002 - 00:01:19.560, Speaker B: Oh yeah, Vance, what do you.
00:01:21.450 - 00:01:44.480, Speaker C: Mean? They do have really good content. I think the stuff that I watch a lot of are the K dramas. Like things like the glory, even. Like things like beef. They have a lot of the ones that cut deep, but it feels like their entire movie slate is just I don't know, it's kind of like low budget, honestly. But they'll figure it out. They've had a big quarter too.
00:01:44.480 - 00:01:49.470, Speaker C: They made like 2 billion of profit this quarter. So maybe you see some of that get reinvested.
00:01:50.450 - 00:02:09.718, Speaker A: They also lost Friends, they lost The Office, they lost all the Universal films and TV shows. They lost MGM. I feel like they had some complex algorithm that told them what was good and it ended up leading to a bunch of the same kind of crappy content that was able to just get pumped out.
00:02:09.884 - 00:02:10.998, Speaker B: That's what I think too.
00:02:11.084 - 00:02:20.806, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they tried to create content based on an algorithm and for a little while it worked really well and then they overinvested in that some.
00:02:20.828 - 00:02:37.934, Speaker C: Things data science or turn over to the crowd. Content creation is one. Running a dow is generally like another. It's kind of like the Steve Jobs rumors have no idea what they want. You just need to put something new in front of them. If you go the other direction, you kind of just get the copy pasta stuff. Not that the one.
00:02:37.972 - 00:03:07.350, Speaker D: I am excited. I don't know if you guys ever read this book, but all the light, we cannot see that movie. It's a really good book, but that movie is coming out I think in October or November this year. That one star studded cast looks really high production value. I think it's right. Netflix, for a long time, their entire capitalization model was, we're going to finance all this content with debt because we can raise infinite amounts of debt. We have this cash flow business.
00:03:07.350 - 00:03:21.180, Speaker D: We can just pump anything we want out now. I think it's okay. We're not going to go the debt route. We're going to get to profitability. We're going to actually kind of hone in what we're building, and then we're going to be able to actually produce good content. But yeah, that's kind of where I think they're at.
00:03:23.890 - 00:03:29.694, Speaker B: They were the first stock I ever bought, actually. Or one of the first ones. I was holding it for a while.
00:03:29.812 - 00:03:34.560, Speaker A: I remember that so well. It was that.
00:03:36.630 - 00:03:37.426, Speaker C: What years were.
00:03:37.448 - 00:03:40.930, Speaker B: This this had to be 2016.
00:03:42.950 - 00:03:46.802, Speaker A: This is when Mike and I were not only roommates, but living in the same room.
00:03:46.856 - 00:03:48.770, Speaker B: Because we were in the same room.
00:03:48.920 - 00:03:49.810, Speaker A: Same room.
00:03:49.960 - 00:03:52.006, Speaker B: We don't need to get into yeah.
00:03:52.028 - 00:03:53.158, Speaker A: We don't need to get into it.
00:03:53.244 - 00:04:01.802, Speaker B: To get into the details of yeah, but yeah. And I FOMOed into IBM because Warren Buffett bought some do you remember that?
00:04:01.856 - 00:04:05.674, Speaker A: These are like we were like, wait a minute, this is so easy.
00:04:05.872 - 00:04:07.654, Speaker B: Buffett tells you what he buys.
00:04:07.702 - 00:04:13.370, Speaker A: Why don't you just buy what Buffett buys? These people are idiots. We can just copy buffett.
00:04:13.790 - 00:04:40.094, Speaker B: Honestly, everyone's messing around with stablecoin designs. IBM is the real stablecoin. You look at the chart of IBM over the last five years, you can't even see COVID on there. It's just like a band like this just does not move. But Netflix netflix was great for a while. It was all about subscriber count. And when they diversified into international, every quarter, they would beat by a huge margin.
00:04:40.094 - 00:04:53.594, Speaker B: On subscriber count, the stock would jump like 10%. And then every once in a while, they would jack up their price by 10%, which with the equivalent of a dollar, and the stock would jump 10%. It was a great own.
00:04:53.712 - 00:05:19.586, Speaker C: You're starting to see some of these tech companies are clearly going to make it, especially the ones that bottomed in June last year, cut their costs, and are now kind of like turning things around. Like you had the Meta beat. You have the Netflix chart, which just looks phenomenal. Pretty good quarter, not as much subscriber growth. But I think that's kind of the future for a lot of these things, right? Like, your top line slows. You get a lot more profitable, and you sprinkle some AI on it and you make it. Netflix will make it.
00:05:19.586 - 00:05:31.110, Speaker C: I think. Michael, unfortunately, the one that doesn't look like it might make it is snap. That chart looks like looks bad. Underworld just terrible.
00:05:31.530 - 00:05:49.580, Speaker D: It's an unfortunate fact. I still have one share of stock. I'm still a shareholder. But we're right at the precipice of the cost of the commission of trading it on charles Schwab might be higher or lower than actually the share of stock itself.
00:05:50.830 - 00:06:01.920, Speaker A: It's not great what happens to these companies. So my wife used to work at Lyft, so she's got some Lyft equity. This stock is also things down 90%.
00:06:04.050 - 00:06:05.870, Speaker C: 6% of the workforce.
00:06:06.230 - 00:06:14.900, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's funny, people still use Lyft every single day. It's still an amazing product. So what happens to these kind of companies?
00:06:18.070 - 00:07:20.540, Speaker D: Frankly, it depends on their cash flow. Are they able to sustain themselves with their own business? Or is it something that they literally need outside capital to be able to get in, to be able to get this point to survival mode? I haven't looked at the income statement or cash flow statement for a lot of these businesses for at least the last month or two. But I would imagine a lot of them, Lyft included, is probably not cash flow positive, or at least not to the point where they would be able to subsidize the business and grow. But yeah, a lot of these things, depending on the governance model, start to look like takeover opportunities where they could be especially software businesses. Lyft is going to be a little bit different because that's a harder problem. Lower gross margin, but anything that's got a high gross margin business and the ability for someone to come in and slash whatever new businesses headcount whatever it is, and turn these into profitable businesses. I think a lot of the private equity firms, the big private equity firms, are starting to get really interested in this type of stuff.
00:07:22.830 - 00:07:57.438, Speaker C: You look at the top software companies, Valley, they all look extremely similar. So like Datadog, Cloudflare, Snowflake Atlassian, there's basically 20 of these similar. They look very similar in terms of their financial profile. And when you dig into it, it's kind of like, okay, you made two to $3 billion a year. Two is probably the more likely case for people like Datadog or folks like that. You didn't make any money, you probably lost a few hundred million. But the pitch is, look at all this revenue.
00:07:57.438 - 00:08:28.510, Speaker C: If we just get our costs under control, we can keep growing it, and it'll all become gross margin over time. And the fact is, very few of these have that potential, but they've all kind of ended up in the same place. And if you look at Lyft, it's very similar. It's a bigger example with more losses. But congratulations, you had 4 billion of revenue, and over that same time period, you've lost almost one and a half billion. What does the future look like for a lot of these? Frankly, some of them are just not viable.
00:08:29.810 - 00:09:03.174, Speaker B: Some aren't, but it'll be interesting to see which ones are, because the flip side of that is that investors haven't demanded or wanted these companies to be profitable for an extremely long time now. Investors are definitely wanting to see profitability. So some of them just have to change things up. I remember looking at, I haven't looked at it super recently, but breakdown of revenue and cost for salesforce. If you just look at how much they're spending on marketing is bananas. You know that old expression, it's like, we know half of our marketing dollars are wasteful, we just don't know which half. I'm sure they're just going to start experimenting.
00:09:03.174 - 00:09:06.522, Speaker B: They could be profitable if they just cut down on some of their marketing spend.
00:09:06.576 - 00:09:10.140, Speaker A: So I don't have a great billion dollars on marketing last year.
00:09:13.730 - 00:09:18.206, Speaker D: And apparently 10 million on Matthew McConaughey worth it.
00:09:18.308 - 00:09:22.026, Speaker B: That was money well spent, though. I was teaming those Lincoln ads.
00:09:22.138 - 00:09:24.530, Speaker A: That number can't be right. 13 billion.
00:09:26.390 - 00:09:28.020, Speaker D: I would imagine it is.
00:09:29.110 - 00:09:48.300, Speaker C: Okay, say you really turn it around and you cut half a billion of costs on a yearly basis on 2 billion of revenue and you're already losing half a billion. Congratulations, you're now making zero money. What else are you stripping out? We can't just chat GPT everything to death. It's just not going to work.
00:09:50.190 - 00:09:54.940, Speaker D: Eventually you have human cost, right? Eventually you can't just replace the people.
00:09:56.830 - 00:10:28.440, Speaker C: Many of the companies that just went public that are tech companies are just like, frankly not that good. I think that's okay. There's a lot that are, but none of these companies are valued on priced earnings because they have no earnings. So they get valued on next twelve months revenue. And the market is basically telling you that a company that's growing 30% per year with mostly losses instead of gains or sorry, instead of profits is worth like eight x. A lot of these companies are just not viable at eight X to go private. That's like probably like a four or five X.
00:10:30.250 - 00:11:13.102, Speaker D: To go private. It's like a twelve to 14 EBITDA multiple, which is effectively profit, right? So even the go privates are not going to be attractive unless there's a real path to profitability in short order. And they're going to try and lever it up. They're going to use financial engineering to buy it and they're going to take that whatever x multiple on the EBITDA and bring it back to twelve to 14. And that's what they're going to buy it. They're going to sell it for 15 in the open market or 20 in the open market. Just to play devil's advocate, though, I will say there was this entire pitch of every single tech company which has nonlinear growth with linear cost, nonlinear revenue growth with linear cost growth.
00:11:13.102 - 00:11:59.300, Speaker D: And if you kind of hit the inflection point at the right time, you're going to be able to have this massive profitability. The surplus that is generated from that. Just look at Google, just look at Facebook. There's tons of those examples. The problem is what everybody missed was contribution margin profitable, basically gross margin profitable. How profitable? When you sell something for $100, how much money are you getting back? That goes to the cost that's fixed that's growing linearly because if you don't have gross margin, high gross margin, gross margin increase over time, you're going to have increase in cost just as much as your revenue increases. So it's basic finance but I think we got the head over our skis quite a bit over the last 510 years.
00:12:00.150 - 00:12:41.200, Speaker B: This is something I just frankly don't know much about, but just a question to you guys on how different subscription revenue streams are valued. Does our investors pretty discerning about different types of subscription? For instance, something that's very core to the business and kind of an enterprise price point versus more sort of retail subscription. The obvious one being like a salesforce or something like that, which is definitely an enterprise model and very core. It's not super easy to just rip out, it's very sticky versus something that's a little bit more like to use an extreme like a newsletter or something like that, right? Which is pretty discretionary in your view. Do investors do a pretty good job of discerning between those two different buckets or not so much?
00:12:42.770 - 00:13:23.318, Speaker C: Enterprise is stickier just because if you have someone who's willing to pay $10 million a year for your software, they're not likely to turn. Their existence implies the existence of many others like them and so maybe the market is a lot bigger as a result. The problem with B to C startups and just generally consumer tech is it's so finicky, it's so feast or famine. Your app can go from number one in the App store to number 100 within two weeks. And that's happened for apps that places like Facebook or Discord have bought. So I don't we we talked about this internally. Outside of gaming, if you hit like a consumer win in venture that's like a once a decade phenomenon.
00:13:23.318 - 00:13:38.100, Speaker C: If like I would say TikTok is the most recent one but before that was probably Snapchat. Consumer stuff is like stuff like an albino unicorn. Like you're just not going to find it.
00:13:38.470 - 00:13:56.920, Speaker D: I mean, look what happened with Clubhouse today. Clubhouse announced that they're cutting over 50% of their staff and it doesn't have to do with runway. It just is like they are cutting back so they can get back to a small team so that they can figure out what product they're going to build. These consumer products are fickle and if you don't have it, lightning in a bottle can be taught but it's very few and far between.
00:13:57.770 - 00:14:11.322, Speaker C: Games are smaller outcomes generally, but they're more reliable in terms of like you can actually find ones that persist over time. There have been more successes in gaming than there have in consumer for almost like ten years at this point.
00:14:11.456 - 00:14:49.330, Speaker B: Hey everyone, exciting announcement here from the Blockworks Podcast network. We are hiring two podcast hosts to build a show with us called Lightspeed. TLDR of Lightspeed is that it is a show for builders tinkerers and lovers of technology. It's a callback to the heyday of Silicon Valley, where great tech was built in garages, not in corporate fortresses, and was truly the Wild West. Lightspeed is an exploration of crypto from the perspective of a builder and an engineer who's designing for scale and is interested in onboarding the next billion users into crypto. If this show sounds exciting to you, you have a background in podcast hosting or content creation, go to the Careers page of Blockworks. That's blockworks Co careers.
00:14:49.330 - 00:15:01.834, Speaker B: I've also linked it in the show notes here. You can just click there. It'll take you right to the page. You can also follow me on Twitter. I'm Mike Ipolito underscore. You can just slide right into my DMs and we'll set up some time to talk. Would love to hear from you.
00:15:01.834 - 00:15:27.966, Speaker B: We are super, super excited about this show. Just before we transition into crypto, we were talking a little bit about real estate. So commercial real estate. I think there's a building that made the COVID of the Wall Street Journal is definitely a big profile article. The title is fire Sale $300 million San Francisco office tower. Mostly empty, open up to offers. And there was speculation that it might sell for 80% less than the $300 million price tag.
00:15:27.966 - 00:15:37.766, Speaker B: So we were just talking about this beforehand. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on that being San Francisco locals for any thoughts on commercial real estate in general, let me read a.
00:15:37.788 - 00:15:59.710, Speaker C: Quote from this article real quick. So Matthew Anderson, this is at the end of the article, managing director at TREP said that selling the office building at a deeply discounted price would be a sad moment for the office market sector. I want to cry, he said. I'm getting emotional just thinking about that. So that's like the rough temperature in the room. This building getting cold, people are crying.
00:16:00.210 - 00:16:09.490, Speaker A: Wait, so it was 300 million and now it's down 80% to 60 in four years? Is that the TLDR?
00:16:10.150 - 00:16:13.586, Speaker B: I don't think it's sold yet, but that's sold yet.
00:16:13.688 - 00:17:03.150, Speaker C: It was worth around 300. So basically the entire commercial office market in San Francisco, this is a commercial real estate show now is basically like, waiting for this one building to clear just so everyone else can reprice their comps and figure out exactly what they are looking at in terms of what their building is worth. But just like, looking at the data that they provided in the asking rent per square foot for office space in San Francisco, they have it at like 75 just from what Michael and I have rented our office for. That's just like, not even within 50% of where these things are going to be. You're kind of seeing it. San Francisco downtown is patient zero for the COVID city that didn't rebound. And yeah, I think this is part of the city bottoming, but I don't think anybody's ever going back to these offices.
00:17:03.150 - 00:17:06.210, Speaker C: You just kind of need to bulldoze them is my opinion.
00:17:08.070 - 00:17:44.738, Speaker D: That is actually the biggest question is what do you do with all of this real estate? And there actually was an interesting proposal, which is what if you build out UCSF and make it into more of a graduate program, university, you get funding from the state, you get funding from a lot of like you can cut a lot of red tape in terms of real estate. But yeah, that's like, the best idea that's out there right now. There's another really interesting data point in San Francisco of just, like, cell phone pings in the area. And how much is it? From pre pandemic to current, San Francisco is the smallest at 31% cell phone pings in the downtown area.
00:17:44.904 - 00:17:48.530, Speaker B: Wow. You mean compared to pre pandemic?
00:17:48.950 - 00:17:50.226, Speaker D: Yep, exactly.
00:17:50.408 - 00:17:51.140, Speaker B: Wow.
00:17:52.630 - 00:17:53.582, Speaker D: Pretty rough.
00:17:53.726 - 00:18:11.020, Speaker C: Doom and gloom. SF has a good vibe right now. It's like, know, there's less know there's less crime generally. The city is starting to come around like AI and crypto being basically the future and all these other startups dying. It's kind of like this reformative moment, but definitely some pain to go before we get there.
00:18:11.870 - 00:18:39.186, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, you want to transition? Let's talk about some crypto stuff here. So maybe we could start with our favorite Bald CEO, Brian. So Brian has launched a he continues to fight the good site. So on Monday, Coinbase filed a narrow action in the US. Circuit Court to compel the SEC to respond yes or no to rulemaking petition that they filed with the SEC last July. Basically, by law, the SEC is required to respond to petitions within a reasonable amount of time.
00:18:39.186 - 00:19:06.118, Speaker B: They haven't responded yet to the petition since last July, and that's why they filed suit. So they basically said that they haven't received any formal communications outside of the Wells Notice, which was served in March. And that indicates that the agency intends to pursue enforcement action. So I don't know, what do you guys think about I want to get your opinions on base as well, which there are some interesting signs of life there, but be curious what you guys think about this action from Coinbase.
00:19:06.214 - 00:19:36.660, Speaker A: Well, there's actually something else. Like five minutes ago, brian and their CLO just tweeted out that they think that the SEC is using the threat of litigation against Coinbase to push them to their goal is to get Coinbase to admit that most of the crypto listed on Coinbase are securities. And what they wrote like five minutes ago is that none of these that this just isn't supported by the law. And not only is it not supported by the law, but it's not even within the bounds of the SEC's authority to do this.
00:19:37.430 - 00:20:12.586, Speaker C: I mean, incredible move from Coinbase, in my opinion. Like, getting regulatory clarity on all of this is not going to come just from waiting for it. You actually have to push for it. And there was a long time where Coinbase was extremely careful. They didn't have ETH on Coinbase until very late in the game. It was just like bitcoin and Litecoin just out of fear that any potential regulatory action could be pending. But now you've seen that go 180 degrees the opposite way, they're probably going to spend like 250,000,000 on legal fees on this stuff and fully fight this battle for the industry.
00:20:12.586 - 00:20:35.110, Speaker C: These things are going to take years. It's not going to come about tomorrow. But everything that has been done, everything that's been put in the press, it's all very well crafted and orchestrated. Know we're thinking about moving our headquarters. Is that very likely? I don't think so. But you're starting to set up a straw man for when you go and talk to Congress about what your company is doing suing the SEC. Okay.
00:20:35.110 - 00:21:13.410, Speaker C: It has been a while since they filed that petition. At some point they're going to have to come out and say whether things like ETH are a security or not. And with that one, it's tough when you've got videos of the SEC chair saying one thing and then saying another. But also if ETH is a security, what happens to all the investors? They definitely get hurt if that designation is made. If it's not, does that mean all the other securities on Coinbase are also commodities or non securities? There's a lot of nuance here, but these are like rifle shots. They're not just like they put this out because they felt like it. Each one has a specific intention of building this straw man to be even stronger.
00:21:13.410 - 00:21:41.286, Speaker C: I'm pretty bullish on Coinbase, and there was a time where I was pretty bearish. This is emotionally, spiritually, whatever, but you have them now going overseas and launching a derivatives exchange, one of the historical profit centers of crypto. They're sticking their guns on Staking, another future profit center of crypto. They're building out a lot of interesting stuff. I can kind of see the tactical case for what they're doing being very positive over the medium term starting to emerge.
00:21:41.398 - 00:22:36.480, Speaker A: I think there's something else that's happening that is like a very just qualitative thing, which is it's created a common enemy at Coinbase. And if you talk to employees of Coinbase right now, they're more fired up than they've been in five, six, seven years right now at Coinbase. And I think maybe if you talk to Coinbase employees in 2020 or 2021 or 2022, they're feeling a little like maybe didn't see the vision, didn't really know what they were building towards. I think every Coinbase employee that I've talked to recently is just fired up right now. And then if you look on crypto, like, people are fired up about Brian and fired up about Coinbase and supportive of Jesse and what they're doing at base and very clapping their hands over for Paul, this chief legal officer I think the industry's got behind Coinbase. Coinbase employees are rallied behind Brian. And that's the unintended consequence of, I think, what's happened of what the SEC has done.
00:22:37.010 - 00:22:46.850, Speaker B: He's got single handedly made bald. Being bald. Cool. That's an impressive feat for him. Sorry, what was your actual observation?
00:22:47.990 - 00:23:23.130, Speaker C: Other than his hair? No, he's got a good team. People forget that there was a revolving door of senior leadership at Coinbase for a long time. You had that was it a fifth guy? I forget who that was. He was like the head of product. Well, you had the Afif guy, who was you had the Chief Product Officer, who I think is gone now, but just, frankly, did a terrible job for a long time. And it feels like those people have left. I forgot they had Brian Brooks.
00:23:23.130 - 00:23:47.726, Speaker C: What an incredible starting five. Bellaji A, Brian Brooks, Brian Armstrong and then Emily. And now it seems to be kind of like Brian and and like, we don't talk to these people. We have no fucking clue. But this is what it seems like from the outside. It's like Brian and Emily, and then Paul is like the fire breathing dragon. And that feels like a pretty good threesome to just go off and charge up this hill.
00:23:47.726 - 00:24:13.450, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, it's just like, who's in the company? Who's still left? And you've got a pretty hardened core of folks that have been there since the beginning, mixed with some new people, mixed with a lot of, frankly, stock based compensation that came out in Q One, which was like, I think, 90% of revenues for last year at least. So everyone's definitely fired up about the SEC, but everyone's definitely been refreshed on their grants as well. So it's moving the right direction.
00:24:13.790 - 00:24:38.146, Speaker B: They did a good job of doing what Wall Street wants. They trimmed a bunch of headcount that, despite what Wall Street wanting, it was probably the right thing to do. They probably had too many heads based on what they needed, it seemed like. At the same time, the product Velocity has picked up. It feels like they're shipping more than ever before. And it seems like everything that they ship feels like a good idea these days. And they kind of have these great products that I'm really excited to see what they do.
00:24:38.146 - 00:24:53.034, Speaker B: So they've got the Core Exchange business, they've got Coinbase Wallet, which I find very interesting. They've got the Staking business, and they've got Base, which is kind of this really interesting wild card that I'm super interested to see what happens about. But each one of those things, I feel like, is super interesting.
00:24:53.232 - 00:25:25.774, Speaker D: So it's not very popular because it's not widely talked about because there aren't just, frankly, as many institutions talking about the services that Coinbase provides. But the other huge one is prime. And prime, you could put custody in there. You could put prime. Advanced trading. I've actually been really impressed. And we have a bunch of friends, obviously, who we work with at Coinbase who are on the institutional team, on the prime team, and they're just coming out with new products all the time, and they're looking forward to your point on people being excited.
00:25:25.774 - 00:25:45.674, Speaker D: They're like, oh, next year we're going to have this type of thing. The year after that we're going to have this other type of financial products that you'd only be able to trade if you were at a desk at a bank in normal financial markets. But we're going to build that. Like, there's a lot of stuff coming down the pike for Coinbase. Just also on the institutional side, it.
00:25:45.712 - 00:26:16.980, Speaker C: Used to be terrible. We used to try to swap, I think it was like USDT for USDC or some innocuous stablecoin transaction. And they'd be like, okay, cool, that's going to be like 15 bips on that. We can just do this in D five without you. And eventually they changed it. But it feels like all the products that are being designed and shipped right now are being done by crypto people, which is like what you need at the end of the day if you have some guy from Google shipping coinbase debit card and this NFT exchange nobody's excited about.
00:26:17.910 - 00:26:43.500, Speaker A: Mean, the other thing that's ripping right now is the girly testnet. If you look at the daily contract deployments on base versus on Ethereum right now, the deployments on base are also cruising. I think if you look at daily contract deployments on ETH, it's like ten k a day roughly. And if you look at base, it's like 50 day right now. So there's a lot of action happening on base right now.
00:26:44.670 - 00:27:05.010, Speaker C: That's what they wanted me back to a year ago, or a year and a half ago when people were trying to deploy contracts and they need to crowdsource like $75,000 from the community to put it on ETH main net. That stuff is getting a lot cheaper, which is just frankly what you need, more contract.
00:27:05.590 - 00:27:38.254, Speaker B: The base contract deployment is very interesting. I think one of the concerns that at least I had that I think we talked about on an episode a couple of months ago when they first launched this was, are developers going to build on this? Because the perception could be that this is some sort of corporate chain or something like that. And I think based on what I've heard, just sort of chatter in the community. I don't think that's the case. And I think developers are actually really excited to build on base because the assumption is that they have users. And that's frankly the thing. That's what developers really want to do.
00:27:38.254 - 00:27:43.200, Speaker B: They want to build stuff that people will use. And I think that's the value proposition that base has.
00:27:44.130 - 00:28:28.314, Speaker D: I also think it's much so, yes, that's a huge component of it, but there's also a huge other. Component of it, which is in the direction of where so many of these D Five protocols. And we have a number of portfolio companies who are building on top of Base and transitioning to Base as their L Two option. And the way that they view it is not only is it going to be this great L Two, which is going to give us throughput, it's going to look and feel like optimism. It's going to be EPM compliant. We're going to be able to have the same user base and same effective user experience, but we're also going to be able to onboard real world assets, potentially that we wouldn't have access to otherwise. We're talking about all the institutional products that Coinbase could be working on building out, providing to their clients.
00:28:28.314 - 00:28:55.480, Speaker D: But what about having an on ramp for tokenization of assets that are real, that get real activity from real world institutions, not just permissionless DeFi in the way that it has been so far. So I think the other viewpoint too is that building on top of Base could be bridging the gap between sort of this previous generation of DeFi, but also real world assets and being able to intermingle the two.
00:28:56.170 - 00:29:55.580, Speaker A: Let me ask you guys, so on Empire, we just did an interesting episode with Espresso and Astria talking about decentralizing sequencers. Where do you think? And I think the conversation right now in the decentralized sequencer land is like, okay, there's a bunch of these roll ups and L Two S that have very centralized sequencers. Then there's this end game of decentralizing the sequencer and you could use something like Espresso or Astria. If you're Coinbase and you're looking to decentralize base, what is the next step there? Because I don't think they just go from the centralized sequencer to having a very decentralized sequencer. I think it's like what they probably do is just add one, almost do it one by like my guess on how Coinbase will go about this is just like adding they probably add some institutional validator to the sequencer, let that sit for like six months, they add one more, they almost do it very methodically, very slowly. What do you guys think about this?
00:29:57.710 - 00:30:53.242, Speaker C: There's kind of two ways to decentralize a sequencer. One is you use one of these shared sequencing layers, like Suave or Espresso, and you say, we're not really in the business of running this sequencer anyways, and we're just going to turn it over to these other systems. Of which we will capture some prorata share of both our activity and also all the other shared sequencing activity that's living on these layers. And I think that seems smart if you're one of these L Two S. And let's just see what Arbitram is doing. Arbitram is doing, let's see, so optimism is doing like $100,000 a day in security cost fees that are being paid to the sequencer. What real motivation do you have to shut your cash cow down and give it to somebody else, I think pretty small.
00:30:53.242 - 00:31:36.698, Speaker C: And so I think you're going to have some people who use the shared sequencing layer that just frankly aren't that big of L. Two S that want to outsource the sequencing decentralization, whatever. But for the biggest ones, like the optimism and the Arbitrams, they're going to try to figure out their own decentralized sequencing play for both them and all the other chains that are building on Op stack for optimism. And then same thing for all the L three S that are building on Arbitrum and that will be the new shared sequencing standard. So I don't know, it's kind of hard for me to see those getting a lot of adoption in the near term. And I think all the biggest L two S are going to just decentralize their sequencers in house. And Centralization is just like it's a spectrum, obviously, but I think that's kind.
00:31:36.704 - 00:32:28.700, Speaker D: Of what's going to play out yesterday. And we're recording this on Thursday, I think it was yesterday there was a total outage of optimism for like 30 or 40 minutes, I think. And that stuff happens still when you don't have basic decentralization. There's all these different arguments, right, all these different arguments on is it going to be a shared sequencing layer, are we going to single sequencer and keep the economics ourselves? I think the biggest point is you need some point of sufficient decentralization, even if it is within the L two itself, so that you have fault tolerance if something were to go down. And I think the root cause of it was infuria and the RPC connection that they had. But if you have that single point of failure, it doesn't matter whether or not it's like is it an economics question, it's more of is it an uptime question.
00:32:29.470 - 00:33:20.106, Speaker B: Well, so I have some thoughts on this. The shared sequencing model, it definitely is a way to mint fees for the time being, but I don't think that's a solution long term. I don't think from a regulatory standpoint like base certainly can't just run a single sequencer forever and not KYC their users. I don't think that's an option for them. I do think for optimism and Arbitrum they have a little bit more time, but eventually I think the community would demand some sort of path to decentralization and then you have two different routes. You could do this sort of shared sequencing model by Espresso or Astria and there are benefits to that, right, that would lead to you have more cross chain atomicity, right? So some degree of composability in between different layer twos. There's a lot of complexity associated with that problem and I think a lot of it is still relatively theoretical but from what I understand, they have pretty compelling, it's a pretty compelling value proposition if they could pull it off.
00:33:20.106 - 00:34:15.102, Speaker B: But to your point, you have to give away a lot of your economics, so that's not super desirable. Then, on the other hand, you could decide, all right, I don't want to give up my economics. What I want to do is bootstrap my own network of sequencers on my own, right, that would be specific to my chain. But then if I'm optimism, I'm thinking, okay, I need to bootstrap my own network of sequencers, which is probably no more difficult than bootstrapping a network of validators. I have to basically implement something that looks like consensus, basically like a leader rotation and civil resistance, all that kind of stuff. At that point, I'm starting to look a lot like a layer one, right, but I'm still having to pay rent down to Ethereum. So I think at that point you start to get to this weird sort of game theory of if I'm optimism, I'm saying at least, even if I'm not saying that optimism is going to go launch as a layer one, I just don't think that's very feasible and I don't think they would do that.
00:34:15.102 - 00:34:32.100, Speaker B: But they could definitely push back on Ethereum a little bit on the rent collection and say, hey, all of the transactions are happening at my layer here. I don't want to pay the same amount of rent to you that I'm paying now. So it's that's more of a statement, really, than a question, but I think it's something to consider for sure.
00:34:33.830 - 00:35:08.800, Speaker C: Yeah, there's places you can get validators consensus is kind of another question of whether you actually want to build that in house. But I think paradox, that Suave and Espresso are kind of maybe more like Espresso and like Astria the paradox they're going to find themselves in is the best way to build the shared sequencing layer is probably to have your own L Two. That's like big, go build another optimism Arbitrum, force it on down that way. The converse approach where you build the interop standard and then you try to get everyone to adopt. Like, I feel like we have a lot of examples of that not working.
00:35:09.250 - 00:35:56.686, Speaker B: Yeah, the other thing to mention is that PBS, which we've been working on, on layer one, Ethereum, doesn't exist yet on roll ups, but people like Hassle are starting to say, hey, we really need to do this. So these sequencers, the way to think of them is they don't have a knowledge of the state, really. They're kind of dumb pipes that do sequencing, but you need some builder that's standing in front of those shared sequencers to actually execute these transactions. So eventually we need to right now, sequencers are basically doing what we have moved past on layer one, where you have proposers and builders being the same entity, those are logically separate. So it's a pretty safe assumption that builders are going to migrate up to the roll up layer because that's where all the activity is and that's their business. But it's also something to consider. I have an open question actually to you guys.
00:35:56.686 - 00:36:44.078, Speaker B: I don't know how much you've dug into, but it seems like if Suave becomes a reality and if you layer on account abstraction to that, it is kind of changing my conception of what I think of as the mem pool. I kind of had this idea of like a pretty simple kind of gossiping protocol between different validators and that's where all the information is and there's kind of different geographic locations. But now with account abstraction, it seems like there's an entire alternative mempool and different set of actors up there. And Suave is kind of its own chain that acts as an alternative mempool that theoretically standardizes preferences across all of these different chains. And it's kind of sort of now I'm starting to divide mempools into public and private mempools. And I don't know if you guys have thought too much about this as well. It's frankly something I'm still trying to consider.
00:36:44.078 - 00:36:53.470, Speaker B: But I do think fragmentation of the mempool is going to be a pretty big theme in the coming years. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts or that's just a little too wonky.
00:36:54.370 - 00:37:32.678, Speaker C: I think it's certainly going to happen. You'll have public, you'll have private, you'll have frankly, like by different use case, by NFT, by long tail, by blue chip. There's just so many different ways that you can slice it. And frankly, different economic models work better for different types of trades, different types of transactions, et cetera, like we've talked about. But I don't know, we've heard that ETH is going to be the main or I think it's post on Twitter that ETH will be like kind of the validation token for Suave. A lot of this just kind of all roads eventually lead back to Ethereum. Whether it's like alternative mempools or different L two S or decentralizing the sequencer, paying for call data and posting.
00:37:32.678 - 00:37:36.926, Speaker C: That is kind of where all of this really makes an impact in my mind at least.
00:37:37.108 - 00:37:58.966, Speaker A: Mike, can you just explain that to me? Are you saying what's going to happen is that wallets become kind of like mev aware and then end up routing order flow where users get paid to transact, which is kind of like how Dex aggregators source the best liquidity today and that's basically going to encourage fragmentation of the mempools. Do I understand that right?
00:37:59.068 - 00:38:43.202, Speaker B: Yeah. Account abstraction introduces a new alternative mempool. It introduces these two different actors. So basically what it allows is at a protocol level, the ability for one account to basically pay for it allows an entity to pay for the transactions of another account. So it makes instead of an end owned account, which is the model in Ethereum today, you have smart contract wallets. So I could kind of see this going two ways. So one is that the wallets end up eating and they do super well because the wallets will essentially act as paymasters and they will, on behalf of users, kind of pay for their transactions as they move down the supply chain and then they'll eventually get rebates as the proceeds from their mev gets go back to them.
00:38:43.202 - 00:39:20.720, Speaker B: But then Michael, this is what we were sort of getting into at the end of our talk last time. What also might happen is that DApps all build their own wallets. So wallet as a service becomes pervasive, really. The DApps DApps can also act as paymasters and pay on behalf of their users, so they can subsidize gas on behalf of their users. They can also route mev back from order flow auctions to users. And ultimately the DApps end up kind of winning from this and doing super well. But ultimately, yeah, it's like Centralization is going to migrate its way up the Mev value chain for sure.
00:39:21.090 - 00:40:52.510, Speaker D: So I was literally going to say, I think the thing that has changed, or has been changing from my perspective over the last couple of weeks is who's going to win the wallet wars? So to say, and we talked about this maybe on our 2022 roundup or 2023 forecast, there's going to be a wallet war going off and there's going to be like the dominant wallet that wins out eventually. I actually think that wallets are just going to become an infrastructure layer on every single application and it's going to be whoever has the best application implicitly has the best wallet because that has the most users. And every single wallet, I think is and it does depend on the application category itself, where, like, DeFi is going to be very different from games, it's going to be very different from NFTs, but the ability to have an order flow auction or basically this private mem pool that you're talking about. Mike I think that's going to be the dominant model where most of this stuff gets transacted because it's going to be up to the paymaster. It's going to be up to the wallet itself to be able to choose where that and like, think about any application where you use today. Are you digging into the internals of the application to actually make the whole thing run? No, you just want to get to the app and use it and have whatever outcome you're trying to have within the app itself, not do it yourself. And so I think that DIY perspective is going to go away as soon as we start to have good applications that have wallet infrastructure and the ability to route that accordingly.
00:40:52.510 - 00:40:57.374, Speaker D: That's kind of the takeaway that I've had over the last couple of weeks thinking about this.
00:40:57.572 - 00:41:12.414, Speaker C: The top three in wallets are MetaMask, I guess. Top four MetaMask, coinbase wallet phantom and then Ronin. Ronin is the layer two wallet for Axie. They have more users than all of the wallets that you can name off.
00:41:12.452 - 00:41:13.678, Speaker D: The top of your head.
00:41:13.844 - 00:41:16.790, Speaker A: It's like have you guys invested in any wallets?
00:41:19.930 - 00:41:37.338, Speaker D: We have, but what they're realizing is a lot of this, it's not like the wallet itself that we're investing in. It's more like, oh yeah, we're going to have this application and it'll have a wallet plugged into it. We may have started as building a wallet, but we're going to build this app and yeah, wallet infrastructure exists within it.
00:41:37.424 - 00:42:10.120, Speaker C: That's why we're so focused on games. If you invest in a winning game, not only do you have the potential of, like an axe style outcome, which at the peak of last bull market running an axe were $45 billion together at Market Cap, obviously that is no longer the case, and obviously that's not the model we're aiming for, but it's a big outcome. Number one. Number two, you just have the most users. If you think mev is going to play out in a real way, you can invest in the science project, decentralized shared sequencers, whatever. It's probably just better to invest in a lot of apps and have one.
00:42:12.170 - 00:42:54.526, Speaker B: That's that's what Osmosis has done in sort of a very early POC with Kepler, the founding team at Osmosis, they built Kepler as well as a wallet to go on top. And it's interesting, even like take out account abstraction. Basically, we're going to start abstracting away a bunch of complexities for users. So wallets will start making decisions on behalf of their users and that creates a bunch of leverage for wallets. So just to give you an example, one of our analysts, Ren shout out, ren pointed this out. You know how right now, if you want to protect against mev, I guess we lost Jason here, but if you want to protect against mev, you could do like Flashbots protect or something like that. You can just switch your RPC endpoint on your MetaMask.
00:42:54.526 - 00:43:15.690, Speaker B: So on the Uniswap mobile wallet, you do not have the option to switch your RPC endpoint, which implies that Uniswap wallet is going to do that for you, which implies that as you have all these different services that basically compete for that market, then Uniswap is going to negotiate on behalf of its users. And it's just interesting, it's just an example of them extracting.
00:43:17.550 - 00:43:25.086, Speaker D: Mike, which port do you think Facebook runs on? Which internet port. It doesn't matter. That's my point.
00:43:25.188 - 00:43:31.280, Speaker B: I think you're right. Yeah, I'm totally with you. I'm with you. But that's an important question to have a perspective on.
00:43:33.250 - 00:44:02.780, Speaker D: Yes, I do think we're in the infrastructure days of the Internet where all this stuff was getting defined and people were making decisions and it was the build out, right? And these decisions will be made and there will be infrastructure providers that come in and offer new services and it'll be competitive. But I think a lot of this stuff will get set and then people will have applications that just handle all this for their users because no user in their right mind is going to want to do it themselves.
00:44:04.190 - 00:44:05.420, Speaker B: Agree with that.
00:44:06.670 - 00:44:14.106, Speaker C: Let's dig in a little bit to the little bit orthogonal, but the current withdrawal queue for ETH.
00:44:14.218 - 00:44:40.760, Speaker B: Yeah, can we just get kind of a post mortem on that? Because there were a ton of different opinions. There was kind of a consensus going in that there was going to be a short increase in withdrawals in unstaked ETH, but then that was quickly going to recover. That was kind of the consensus going in. You obviously had some doomsayers at the extreme saying this was going to be a massive sell event and you should derisk. So what ended up happening?
00:44:41.770 - 00:45:42.810, Speaker C: As per usual, all the doomsdays were wrong and they may have had no idea what they were talking about from the start. But to the more rational perspective, you do have now net inflows on a couple of week basis since Shanghai got through, I've been impressed with the relative strength of ethereum. Yes, there's definitely more inflows than outflows at this point, but right now in the withdrawal queue and there's a great dashboard on Nanson that's public for ETH. Two withdrawals, there's 635,000 ETH that are waiting to be withdrawn. So, like, if I told you that potentially $1.2 billion is going to hit the market over the next 20 days with 30K ETH unlocking every single day, you'd probably be pretty bearish on ethereum, but it's really held up in the face of everything. The unexpected stuff that I would say is I expected there to be a ramping of centralized exchange deposits.
00:45:42.810 - 00:46:18.414, Speaker C: And certainly there has been. I think there have been. Let me just check there's six hundred K E staked in the last week. A lot of that is from the centralized players, basically like latent ethereum that was waiting on Coinbase for people to deposit into the queue once they could actually withdraw. The bigger surprise for me is the LSTs have seen a lot of the share of folks like Kraken and Finance and Coinbase and even CBE on Coinbase flowing into Lido. And that's just like I don't know, I think the staking market has two facets right now. It's like number one or three facets.
00:46:18.414 - 00:46:52.618, Speaker C: Number one, what's the activity on like it seems pretty healthy even in the bear market. Even a few of these frankly shitcoins have pushed fees up to pretty high levels. Number two, how much ETH is going to get staked? My hypothesis changed from probably 25, 30% pre Shanghai. Now it's like 40%, potentially even higher. You're just seeing a lot of ETH staked. And number three, is it centralized staked ethereum or is it liquid staked ethereum? And I think the balance of power is shifting to the liquid staked ethereum just because everyone's realizing it's more capital efficient. All the lending pools and things like Maker, all the lending volumes are ramping.
00:46:52.618 - 00:47:11.960, Speaker C: It's getting lindy in a way that it wasn't before. And this is even without Lido or any liquid stake token withdrawals being viable yet, that upgrade will happen in May for most of these liquid staking protocols. But if you were to have to force liquidate a huge position of Steeth right now, you couldn't withdraw and get your vanilla back to do.
00:47:14.010 - 00:47:59.734, Speaker D: That. And we know that that's coming with, like we know that's going to happen eventually, right? So I completely agree with everything Van said. The things I would add are I find it kind of Odly expected, but also funny that it wasn't expected, that frankly, we wouldn't be just surviving the next, like 48 hours after Shanghai, where like $10 billion of ETH was going to get dumped, and it was in reality going to take a lot longer. Of course it was. Lido doesn't even have their upgrade in a lot of these LSTs don't have their upgrade in the centralized exchanges. Didn't even have their upgrade ready where you weren't able to withdraw if you use CBE until recently. Actually, I'm not even sure about CBE, but Kucoin was just recently as well.
00:47:59.734 - 00:48:49.158, Speaker D: So you're going to continue to see this with Rock. You probably persist, we think, probably for the next month or so, and you're going to see it pretty heavy. There's going to be a lot of ETH that's being withdrawn, but what is very surprising is how much ETH is now being put in. And the difference I would say, though, is that for whatever purpose of withdrawing versus depositing, there are two very different purposes. I think a lot of the people who are depositing into these queues right now to stake are institutions that have been sitting on ETH that weren't able to stake it due to, frankly, just tax reasons. And they were waiting to be able to have the withdrawal queue to be derisked. They didn't want to put it into an LST because of the tax reasons in whatever jurisdiction may be in.
00:48:49.158 - 00:48:57.974, Speaker D: And that ETH is probably not going to go anywhere for a long time. So I think we're going to continue to see that as well, because I think there's just a lot of ETH that's waiting on the sidelines for that purpose as well.
00:48:58.172 - 00:49:42.630, Speaker B: I think there's another reason as well, and it actually makes me a little bit more bullish. Without revealing, I have always been a little bit nervous to fully like to deposit in something like Lido, because I know it's popular to be like, hey, there could be something wrong with the tech and you could lose your money, but there could be something wrong with the tech and you could lose your money. I remember used to having these debates about BlockFi, actually, and the debate was always like, hey, if you think in the very early days it was only Bitcoin. So hey, if you think Bitcoin is going to be much higher ten years from now, why would you risk that for an extra 5% a year when the alternative is you could lose all your money. And at the time, this is how it went at the time. Blockfly is like coinbase, it's not going to go down. If Blockfly goes down, then the whole space is going to be in a whole lot of trouble.
00:49:42.630 - 00:50:39.238, Speaker B: I actually remember watching this interview with Justin Drake who was on the season of Bell Curve, the MEB part and I think it might have been Banquets, I can't remember. But he got asked something to the effect of do you have all of your ETH staked? This was right around when the merge happened and he was like, no, I remember that and said something to the effect of like I've seen how the sausage is made and I watched that and I was like woof, yeah, I'm just going to wait a little bit. But I think this is bullish because now you are just derisking variables and I saw Djen Spartan say something like this and it actually hit home with me quite a bit. The meme of bitcoin and Hodl is much less powerful than stake and get yield. And I just think it's a much more acceptable meme for TradFi. Like TradFi will get this. All those things about the US dollar, like you've eroded 98% of your purchasing power over X many years.
00:50:39.238 - 00:51:06.420, Speaker B: Not if you put it in bonds. You didn't lose any purchasing power, you actually did fine. And that's actually become my mental model for ETH versus staked ETH. And if you look at some of these protocol changes like I don't know if you guys have dug into MVV burn as well, that is a simple transfer from validators to stakers. And that seems to be the way that things are leaning. And why wouldn't you want to stake your ETH in that stage? That's awesome.
00:51:07.590 - 00:51:14.740, Speaker C: Bad things can happen. But blockfly the tech wasn't that wasn't the issue.
00:51:17.270 - 00:51:18.260, Speaker B: I know.
00:51:23.290 - 00:52:00.020, Speaker C: LSTs are fucking lindy. Basically that's the point. If you go to DFI Llama today, they added last week a Lido dominance thing under the main kind of like TVL charts. Steep looping is greater than 24% of DFI right now. It probably will be like and looping is when you put Steeth in a borrowing protocol. You take Dyer USDC, you buy Steeth again, you keep doing it, you can lever up your yield in your position, but that is a lot of DeFi at this point. If you're not comfortable with that, I don't really know how you know, going forward.
00:52:00.550 - 00:53:22.058, Speaker D: I was going to say the same thing, which is Mike, on the flip side of your point, if you read the fine print of these staking agreements, all the custodial staking agreements basically say if you lose your value, it's not our fault. And the benefit of an LST is you may be staking and earning yield, but I also have this token in my wallet and there's another opportunity for me to sell it and get out if I needed to. I can totally see the argument of TradFi, but I would also say there is the flip side to that as well, which takes a more crypto native Trad perspective, maybe like kind of a little bit right of the bell trove, if we were to say. But I think the other thing that we're seeing myself, the other thing that we're seeing is, frankly, just like a lot of activity on the small LSTs and they're getting like thousands or tens of thousands of deposits into them, and we're starting to see the ecosystem around LSTs also get to be really interesting. I can't remember the name of it. There was this one kind of like Dgen LST farm that got to, I think, like 500 million in TVL in a week just with LSTs. And it's like the ability to have these things and bucket them together.
00:53:22.058 - 00:53:40.020, Speaker D: And it feels kind of like what was starting with DFI Summer where you start to put these pieces together of like, okay, you got this token, got that thing. And I do think that there is a shot, maybe an outside shot, that DFI Summer turns into LST Summer for 2023.
00:53:41.350 - 00:53:50.040, Speaker C: It's been a while since I saw people aping unaudited smart contracts. Step right up, try your luck. See what you win.
00:53:53.770 - 00:53:55.190, Speaker A: I've got a question for you guys.
00:53:55.260 - 00:54:07.206, Speaker B: This is a random one, actually, but why do you think so these meme coins, like Pepe or whatever, I haven't really followed this that closely. Why do you think those are happening on main chain instead of something like Polygon?
00:54:07.398 - 00:54:09.660, Speaker A: Oh, you want to put the tinfoil hat back on?
00:54:09.970 - 00:54:11.962, Speaker B: I'm getting to the tinfoil hat.
00:54:12.106 - 00:54:28.146, Speaker C: That's where all the whales are. That's where all the liquidity is now. That's where all the LFTs are, all the mev is. Step right up, try your luck. But if you're doing it on Polygon, it's going to be like one 100th of the size.
00:54:28.328 - 00:54:28.962, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:29.096 - 00:55:10.190, Speaker C: One of the things we're very sensitive about with our capital is we basically avoid Bridging at all costs. We'll try to go through centralized exchanges to get onto native chains if we have to, but Bridging is still the thing that is not figured out or to the extent that institutions would like it to be. If you lose your money in a bridge and you tell your LPs, they're going to be like, you fucking idiot, of course. Because all of these bridges get hacked. And I don't think there is one other than maybe like Bungie and Socket that hasn't. But knock on wood, the bridges are just dangerous. And I think that's why these things don't happen on these other chains.
00:55:11.170 - 00:55:25.622, Speaker D: Yeah, I do think that that's going to be a while before that changes, too. I don't think that this is going to be like, oh, we now have this thing. It's like, okay, the days since last incident. We keep going back to zero too often.
00:55:25.756 - 00:55:32.600, Speaker A: You don't think Circle's CCTP will help that? Do you guys see this? The cross chain transfer.
00:55:35.130 - 00:56:07.620, Speaker D: Like chainlink is working on CCIP and there's all these cross chain communications protocols. Yes, those will help it, but I think that that once again just kind of puts it back to zero and then the Lindy effect is going to be the only thing that we can really think about. The thing that would help it the most, I think personally would be centralized custodial bridging where you go immediate flip. Okay, I've got OETH to ETH, to polygon ETH and that would be the best way. And it's instant. You could charge a fee for it.
00:56:08.070 - 00:56:40.780, Speaker A: Isn't Circle thing a nice middle ground there between the fully decentralized bridges and then the fully custodial bridges? In this case with CCTP Circles, after the user initiates a USDC transfer through the portal on kind of the source chain, the user specifies the wallet address they want to send it to on the destination chain. Then the portal or wallet or bridge or like the app burns the USDC on the source chain. And then in this case, Circle is attesting to the burn event on the source chain. So Circle is like putting their stamp of approval on it, basically.
00:56:41.390 - 00:57:04.834, Speaker D: I guess there's typically speaking from the institutional perspective, I think that that would be difficult to be able to explain away and that's the only real but I think that there's a lot of people who are institutional have a bunch of capital who wouldn't be able to do that. The custodial experience would be better for the whales. Sure. Like CCTP or CCIP or whatever. Communications protocol. Yes.
00:57:04.952 - 00:57:40.078, Speaker A: Also, I just think the user experience gets much better. I don't know, let's say a DAP uses CCTP. I got red pilled on it by our research folks. But if a DAP integrates with like let's say you're buying an NFT or something like that, you could swap from like you could basically do a native. Let's say you have a bunch of ETH in MetaMask or something, but you want to purchase an NFT on don't, you don't have to go do the Bridging yourself. You can just instantly buy the NFT on solana. It's just a much better user experience.
00:57:40.078 - 00:57:40.800, Speaker A: Right?
00:57:43.090 - 00:58:35.710, Speaker C: I think it is, but to the point of how do you get Pepe to happen on polygon? The pepe pool was ETH pepe. It was being bid by crypto native whales with crypto native assets. It's not like, let me put this kind of like fed coin into this uniswap pool and get after it. It's just not the temperature of how people are operating right now. And if you're counting on stablecoins to really bootstrap your L Two, just like if you look at the aggregate USDC chart you're kind of fighting uphill in that regard. I think the best path for if your L Two wants to build DFI A, you need to make your asset super Lindy, and you need to get people to use it in DFI. Because if that's not happening if you don't have a big optimism or Arbitrum backed stablecoin, or you don't have a lot of dex activity that's quoted in Op or ARB.
00:58:35.710 - 00:58:52.230, Speaker C: People are just going to default to ETH. And if they default to ETH, then you might as well just be on the base chain. The fees aren't that high and that's where all the liquidity, the institutions and all the infrastructure basically is all the leverage too, to the extent that it still exists is in like the Ave V two, ave V three on Ethel one and then Maker.
00:58:52.890 - 00:59:45.270, Speaker B: Yeah, it hasn't really migrated up that much. Yeah, the liquidity and the TVL is all still on ETH main chain even though mostly like the Ave's of the world, they've deployed on a bunch of the layer two so the roll ups but it's not much activity there. The leading decks on optimism is not uniswap, it's Velodrome. It's Velodrome, which is a very cool design by the way. It's inspired actually by that failed Exchange solidly from Andre Cronhey but it basically borrowed the design from failed that failed for reasons know they had bugs in the software and they were trying to do it on Phantom but they had some pretty cool innovations actually for Sold Lady Exchange.
00:59:45.610 - 00:59:55.500, Speaker D: You're laughing Michael Andre, it feels like the story of his entire arc, like some pretty cool ideas but it ultimately didn't work out.
00:59:56.270 - 01:00:51.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, what he was trying to do my interpretation, which know, I'm sure there's a way more sophisticated interpretation, but they were trying to tie emissions to fees instead of liquidity because there are these games that you could play, for instance, on aur balancer, where they all have ve like vote escrow mechanisms. And what you can do is you can direct emissions and you're supposed to do it to incentivize liquidity to a pool. But you could also be the only LP in an entire pool. You could just direct all the emissions to basically yourself. So they've got all these incentive mechanisms to tie emissions to fees that a pool is producing which is theoretically better trading experience and it's better for the health of the also if you have like Ve curve you can't transfer that or anything. So this is actually in NFT form so in theory you actually get capital efficiency. You could deposit that as collateral.
01:00:51.470 - 01:01:33.398, Speaker B: Just it's just interesting incentive a there's also one on I think it's Binance smart chain but it's a low cap gem so I don't really want to mention it. You can read Blockworks Research plug for Blockworks Research, find out what that is. I do want to shout out or get your guys kind of opinion on Solana as well. They did their Mad Lads Mint which I think ended up going live on friday and it went pretty well. And I saw a bunch of people get the Mad Lads. I'm not an NFT guy. I've only lost money on NFTs.
01:01:33.398 - 01:01:40.830, Speaker B: Usually chasing ones that Yano has recommended. I'll show you guys my NFT. It's like a horrendous collection.
01:01:42.450 - 01:01:45.294, Speaker A: The market just hasn't realized how good the collection is yet.
01:01:45.412 - 01:01:49.360, Speaker B: That's exactly right. The market is wrong.
01:01:51.490 - 01:01:54.670, Speaker A: What was the dumb one that marked the top for? Guess.
01:01:54.740 - 01:02:01.038, Speaker B: This is Frank Franks. Yeah. Just look up Frank Franks and you'll see the last NFT that I bought. I know Frank stupidest.
01:02:01.134 - 01:02:02.766, Speaker A: I was your liquidity, Michael.
01:02:02.798 - 01:02:04.210, Speaker B: I was your exit. You're welcome.
01:02:04.360 - 01:02:10.518, Speaker D: Someone out there, I think I've got like five or six hash masks sitting around somewhere if you remember those.
01:02:10.684 - 01:02:19.740, Speaker C: Way more than that. Those hash masks. We joke people are going to get hash masks for a bonus. One year.
01:02:24.350 - 01:02:27.930, Speaker A: I bought like a derivative of doodles called noodles.
01:02:29.790 - 01:02:31.280, Speaker C: You want that one back?
01:02:32.050 - 01:02:34.560, Speaker A: Definitely want that ETH back.
01:02:36.450 - 01:02:42.720, Speaker C: The NFT community is like tearing itself apart, collapsing all at once.
01:02:44.130 - 01:02:47.778, Speaker A: Mad Lads is like the best mint in two years. madlads is pumping right now.
01:02:47.864 - 01:02:58.470, Speaker B: They've been going, if those noodles had gone up, you would have been like, yeah, I mean, it's because the noodles are skinnier than the doodles and because of this and they're so rare.
01:02:59.450 - 01:03:00.520, Speaker A: Let's see.
01:03:02.010 - 01:03:36.850, Speaker D: So here's my update take on NFTs right now. I think they're all about to do their own fungible tokens as well and realize that that's how they can incentivize community. Basically, in reaction to what seems to be the final resolution of no royalties, they're like, okay, we need a new monetization model. And I think Moonbirds has launched one. I think they're going to have most of the big collections are going to realize this. And I think the other option for what this summer will be about is NFT token liquidity.
01:03:39.110 - 01:03:51.122, Speaker C: I mean, they didn't really like the first dose of liquidity that they got them being the NFT community, but they seem to have preferred illiquid, higher prices versus lower prices that are more yeah.
01:03:51.176 - 01:04:01.654, Speaker B: These NFT communities, what are they spending their money on? I'm sure this is an ignorant question, but didn't they raise hundreds of millions of dollars by selling JPEGs? What have they done with this doodle?
01:04:01.702 - 01:04:05.930, Speaker C: Like, oh, no, 54 million merch bro, token, gated hoodies.
01:04:11.310 - 01:04:12.298, Speaker D: What else?
01:04:12.464 - 01:05:00.300, Speaker B: You know what, I think they have to I don't know. I would not fade NFTs frankly, everyone's calling NFTs dead, which probably makes it the right time to buy NFTs. But I do think they I don't know one thing, this may just be such a boomer take that ages so poorly, but the idea of decentralized IP creation I struggle a lot with at least know people were comparing board apes to Disney at one. I just I don't think you get great IP creation from a whole bunch of different, like a cacophony of different voices. Right? It's usually like one person with a and maybe there's just different types of IP that you can create or sort of community led experiences, but I don't think you're getting the next avatar from a decentralized community of people. I just don't think that's how it works.
01:05:04.450 - 01:05:40.198, Speaker C: I think interesting IP creation is like form a dow, go off and buy a script. Okay, cool, that can work. But we're all going to pass the talking stick and come up with this Disney story that's just never going to happen. There's so many cool use cases for NFTs that just happens to not be one of them. Yeah, which is okay, but Mad Lads, that's a use case. Putting IP on chain as just somewhere that it lives instead of an AWS server, that's a use case. I honestly think some of the NFT art, the generative Art, that's a use case.
01:05:40.198 - 01:05:50.140, Speaker C: There's financial use cases for NFTs, just like we don't need to take it to the Nth degree and be like, we're going to decentralize everything, even the creation of the NFT, that doesn't need to happen.
01:05:50.770 - 01:06:15.618, Speaker B: I'm with you. I think the NFT backpacks feel very interesting to me. Even. I don't know, I get more excited about sort of crypto native versions of NFT use cases as opposed to, we're going to do concert tickets as it's I don't know what's the one that people always talk about, like medical records or whatever. That's just hard for me to get super fired up about.
01:06:15.704 - 01:06:20.760, Speaker D: It might work, but yeah, HIPAA is never going to allow you to do that.
01:06:21.610 - 01:06:27.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want them to do that. As someone who I don't have that many crazy medical arguments, I don't want them to do that.
01:06:29.070 - 01:06:55.760, Speaker D: I don't either. I think that there are digital native ways of having digital real estate represented in NFT form. One of the best ways of doing that might be like a domain or a website or the things that are encapsulated within a digital ecosystem. But the second that you have to have something that bridges the digital to analog divide, it breaks down completely. I've never seen a good example of how you'd be able to do that.
01:06:57.190 - 01:07:21.286, Speaker C: I still want just like a basic app that I can basically use as a scrapbook, take screenshots of exciting moments in my digital life, put it in this thing. I'll remember it forever. When we had the Wall Street Journal story a couple of times, like some certain people who follow me on Twitter, I want to remember that stuff. I don't want to put it in AWS, I want to put it on, but nobody has built like it feels like the simple stuff is the stuff that's actually going to work.
01:07:21.468 - 01:08:18.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you. I have one final sort of observation to make that I'd love to maybe get your guys thoughts on, or if I'm just totally off base here, but the thing about the mad Lads Mint that I thought was interesting was the performance of Solana, which actually has been, I mean, this struggle really famously with Salana going down. But they handled that Mint pretty flawlessly. And it's because they kind of quietly shipped parallel fee markets, which is a super interesting concept, which is I think it's been proposed on Ethereum as well. But basically one of the problems with general block space, like it works on an L one, is if there was an NFT Mint or something like Blur going live, you could disrupt the functioning of a completely separate sector. So if there's a really popular NFT Mint, it could disrupt DeFi. And I kind of think it's interesting to watch these different blockchain ecosystems start at very different points, but they're sort of converging on different types of architecture or solving different problems.
01:08:18.780 - 01:09:14.814, Speaker B: The obvious one kind of is Cosmos and Ethereum, right? App chains have now come to roll ups and it's the Op stacked and people are going to build layer twos instead of basically build layer two that are app chains, which is super interesting. But I think Salana has been working for a very long time on solving. They have a very low blockchain of block time of like 400 milliseconds, basically, very performant blockchain, very low latency. And the pull for roll ups is very similar to Salana, actually. The user preference, the strongly stated user preference on roll ups is low latency, very fast confirmation times. And you can kind of get around that with a big builder to do pre commits or something like that. But I think in like a year or something, all these roll ups are going to start talking about solving the same problems that Solana has been trying to solve for a long time.
01:09:14.814 - 01:09:35.060, Speaker B: So I don't know if you guys agree with that or I just think it's interesting that you have these three sort of blockchain ecosystems that looked like very different a while ago, but they're all kind of converging on solving a similar set of problems or coming to a consensus a little bit about design decisions. I'd be curious what you guys think about that.
01:09:35.830 - 01:10:04.078, Speaker C: I think the pros of Salana are like, it's this clean, self encapsulated system. It's not going to leak value to L two S, it's not going to have this web of app chains. It is what it is and it's very cheap right now. You can do different things from a consumer perspective, but all of the economics are going to flow back to salona the asset. And I think that is a very different value prop from Ethereum, which is like this web of chains. And I think it's compelling from an investing perspective. Not that we're Solana owners, but it is interesting.
01:10:04.078 - 01:10:38.146, Speaker C: So that's like the first one. I think the second one is I would give probably Salana just because it's like a different base layer, a higher shot at developing something that looks like DFI than probably your run of the mill L Two that launches on ethereum in a year. Just because people are going to take salana, they're going to stake it, they're going to use it in deep. Taking your salana and putting it as stake salana is like the first step of the journey towards DFI, because then it's not just sitting there, you're earning yield, and then once it's earning yield and you have it liquid, then you're like, Maybe I can borrow against this. You lever it up. There's ETH looping trade. But on salana, you can bootstrap DFI.
01:10:38.146 - 01:11:24.326, Speaker C: And to our earlier conversation, really the only thing that matters is how Lindy is your native asset and are people using it on chain. So I give Salona a higher chance at doing that than many L Two S in their own native tokens. Beyond that, there's a lot of negatives, I think, like, the chain going down all the time. Not that positive, but they'll figure that out eventually. Also, I think it's kind of ironic for salana supporters to be like, l two S are bad because of the single sequence of roll up. Well, it's like that chain is going down pretty frequently, but I think they're going to solve these problems before the L two S probably solve the same ones, and that's pretty bullish for them. So, I don't know, it feels like the salon ecosystem is starting to coalesce and really kind of take shape around, specifically, like, the backpack and Mad Lads guys.
01:11:24.326 - 01:11:44.586, Speaker C: And you kind of need that. The backpack story is pretty inspiring to a certain degree. They raised 20 million. They were in the FTX, salana, primordial soup, whatever you want to call it. They lost $15 million in the hack they're still building. They had the biggest NFT mint. They're now recapitalized.
01:11:44.586 - 01:11:52.320, Speaker C: You're starting to see people string the narrative together. And Tristan and Armani are awesome as well. So not surprising that it's them.
01:11:52.690 - 01:12:12.790, Speaker B: Yeah. This is a stupid hypothetical that you couldn't do a counterfactual for, but stake rate on Salana I think is high. It's like 70% or something like that. On ETH, it's something like 25%. What do you think the stake rate difference would be if ETH had started as a proof of stake chain.
01:12:15.370 - 01:12:25.418, Speaker C: Across? I guess not. Cosmos. But yeah. Cosmos. Atom. Salana. Phantom It's all like 70, 80%.
01:12:25.584 - 01:12:26.300, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:29.150 - 01:12:34.720, Speaker D: Mike, I think exactly that's your answer. If you started as a proof of stake chain, it's going to be closer to that.
01:12:35.250 - 01:13:06.166, Speaker C: Proof of stake chains also develop very differently than the ones that were proof of work because you have this military industrial complex of all the centralized validators that get all of the inflation. And so they're actually well capitalized. And okay, now you have ten centralized companies around Phantom or Salana or Atom that are highly incentivized to make it work. And so you do have a little bit more of that versus proof of work. Miners taking the coins, selling it into the floor and hoping retail picks it back up. There's different epistemology as well as to.
01:13:06.188 - 01:13:51.430, Speaker D: How it all works out. What I was going to say, though, is what you would fundamentally have as well is a different distribution model, but it's much less decentralized than a decentralized proof of work model, because the time at which you're acquiring the assets, let's say that you're an investor at an early stage of proof of work startup. Sorry, proof of stake startup. You're going to get an allocation at whatever seed, series A, Series B, whatever round it is, and you're buying those assets and you're holding onto them, you're probably going to stake them. But if you're someone who's buying into a proof of work chain, you're buying into that chain by buying those tokens off of an exchange. It's a very different economic equation from how did you obtain these assets? Perspective.
01:13:52.170 - 01:13:56.710, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. I think that's about all the time we have, folks.

01:14:04.970 - 01:14:08.600, Speaker D: Wait. Let's just see how my staff share is doing.
