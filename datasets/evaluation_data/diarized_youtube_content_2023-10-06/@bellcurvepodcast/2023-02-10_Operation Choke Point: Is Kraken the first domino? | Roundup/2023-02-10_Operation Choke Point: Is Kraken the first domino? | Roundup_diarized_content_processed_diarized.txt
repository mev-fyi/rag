00:00:22.404 - 00:00:35.170, Speaker B: Now let's jump into the episode. Let's give an AI money and see if it can grow it into like a trillion dollars. That's how you create something like Skynet, and that's what's most exciting to me personally.
00:00:35.250 - 00:00:42.458, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome to another Bell Curve roundup. You got Michael's, one and two and Vance. And we've shed the dead weight with Yano being gone this week. Fellas, how you doing?
00:00:42.544 - 00:00:46.922, Speaker C: There we go. There we go. Is he in Morocco again?
00:00:46.976 - 00:00:49.434, Speaker A: He's in Mexico. He likes the end.
00:00:49.552 - 00:00:49.882, Speaker B: Wow.
00:00:49.936 - 00:00:50.474, Speaker A: Likes the end.
00:00:50.512 - 00:00:51.434, Speaker B: Tough life for you guys.
00:00:51.472 - 00:00:52.220, Speaker A: I know.
00:00:52.770 - 00:00:54.014, Speaker B: A lot of time off.
00:00:54.052 - 00:01:05.220, Speaker A: All him, man, all him. I'm here every week, week in and week out, taking up. Where are you guys? That's a new background for you, michael, where are you?
00:01:05.910 - 00:01:10.020, Speaker C: I'm 90 degrees to the right in the same room that I normally record in.
00:01:11.270 - 00:01:12.226, Speaker B: Whole new feel.
00:01:12.328 - 00:01:16.486, Speaker A: I like it. Totally new feel. Yeah, I like the feng shui. It's nice.
00:01:16.588 - 00:01:16.998, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:01:17.084 - 00:01:18.374, Speaker B: It's our office. Yeah.
00:01:18.412 - 00:01:49.310, Speaker A: Oh, cool. Like the brick. The brick is good. All right, let's get into it because we're recording like 30 minutes after the announcement just came out about Kraken having to discontinue their staking service. So it's been a tough week for the exchanges overall. So a little while ago, Nick Carter tweeted about a new Operation choke Point type thing and we can get into exactly what that means. But basically earlier this week, Finance tweeted that they were going to suspend US dollar transfers.
00:01:49.310 - 00:02:20.186, Speaker A: Brian Armstrong also tweeted that they were, quote, hearing rumors that the SEC was likely to get rid of crypto staking in the US for retail customers. And as of about 30 minutes ago so it's kind of a developing story. We knew that there was a probe, an SEC probe into Kraken and they confirmed that they are basically bringing to an end their staking service for E staking on their platform. I'll turn over to you guys. I don't know what your thoughts are on all this high level, so one.
00:02:20.208 - 00:03:36.994, Speaker C: Point of clarification, I believe, and once again moving in real time, at least. Brian Armstrong's tweet yesterday suggested that it was ETH staking for retail customers only, that institutional would still be allowed to stake. I think this is going to be the devil will be in the details right when we finally see what's the point that the SEC is particularly making around what and why they cannot continue forward with this retail staking operation. I believe Kraken has their own liquid staking derivative, LSD Token, that represents the ETH being staked on the platform. I'm almost sure about that, but I know that Coinbase does in the form of CBE. My guess, and this is me without a legal degree, nor ever being a lawyer, is that their view is that the creation of that token, while staking, which generates a yield either in the form of rebasing or increasing the amount of ETH that you'll be able to withdraw when you reclaim that ETH, is the creation of the unregistered security. And offering that to retail is probably something similar to what Blockfly got hit with, which was earn accounts for retail, where you're putting up crypto, you're putting up digital assets in return.
00:03:36.994 - 00:04:31.650, Speaker C: Those retail accounts are earning a yield by just having those assets in that account. Obviously it's very different because it's not rehypothecated and lent out to some nefarious characters, as we saw in the case of BlockFi. But this is something that looks and feels, on the surface at least, probably pretty similar to in the eyes of the SEC, probably pretty similar to what those earn accounts were doing. And also keep in mind the SEC already said no to Coinbase being able to do the earn accounts themselves, whereas other platforms like Gemini continued forward and offered that to retail. So there's just going to be a lot of stuff to unravel here. We're interested in waiting to see what the actual complaint is, what happens with Coinbase, and as of like 1215 Pacific, nothing has happened with Coinbase other than Brian's Tweet. But I feel like there's going to be other shoes to fall here.
00:04:31.650 - 00:04:33.998, Speaker C: So something that we're watching very closely.
00:04:34.094 - 00:05:24.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, not a whole lot unique. To add to that, it's kind of unclear what exactly is being targeted right now. They have APY percentages advertised on their website, they have a lending program as well that's advertised on their website. It feels like there's probably a few things, and I think the difference know Kraken, which is today, and Coinbase which might be next week, and the Brian Tweet seemed to kind of summarize that there wasn't any outreach that had already happened. Kraken's small and a fine could potentially kill them. And if the Staking business isn't that large and I'm trying to find the data right now, but I can't seem to pull it up. My best recollection is that Kraken had hundreds of thousands of ETH staked versus Coinbase, with probably millions.
00:05:24.050 - 00:05:52.814, Speaker B: That is a business that they're probably willing to seed if the fine would be existential kill them. Whereas if Coinbase is, they have 1.2 million CBE now, they have probably millions more centralized staked ETH as well. That is a core part of the future story of Coinbase. I would expect there at least to be some pushback from them in the process of getting this settled, but it's very unclear what exactly is being targeted at the moment.
00:05:52.932 - 00:06:24.402, Speaker C: And just to add one quick point, I believe in the filings for the last quarter Coinbase's revenue, 11% of it was staking revenue. They didn't break it down between retail and institutional, but you can imagine based off of how much institutional, you can assume based on Custodial Staking and then CBE, which is retail, which we know is about 1.1 million ETH right now, you can assume that it's probably a pretty significant portion of that. 11% is going to be retail. So this is a direct shot at that revenue stream.
00:06:24.546 - 00:06:34.780, Speaker B: And Tier Ten K DB just reported that it's a $30 million fine. So it looks like it's kind of an open and shut case at the moment.
00:06:35.870 - 00:07:02.066, Speaker A: And it's just to clarify too, why that revenue is important to Coinbase, it's important for Wall Street or how investors are valuing that business because they're very transaction based right now. Their trading fee revenue, most investors assume that it's going to go lower and know kind of a race to zero over time. So what Brian wants to do is grow that subscription part of their business, or the services and subscription part of their business, which is largely being driven by staking, right? Is that fair?
00:07:02.248 - 00:07:32.026, Speaker C: Wall street loves sustained revenue growth, and the best way to do that is with effectively subscription revenue. And the best way to have subscription revenue in crypto is to have staking returns just because over time, obviously the dollar value goes up as the value of the tokens go up, and likewise they go down as they go down. But over time you can assume that the Lindy effect will take over, people will build trust, there'll be more use cases for the staking operations themselves, and that will become sort of like a SaaS, almost like revenue business.
00:07:32.128 - 00:08:01.910, Speaker A: So the market doesn't like this. So this was announced about 30 or 45 minutes ago, markets trading down about 4%. Obviously, I think people were already a little bit jittery just in general about how the regulatory apparatus in the US was going to react to everything. FTX, I think if we're reading the markets correctly, pretty easy to read this would suggest that it could be headed in a bad direction. Do you guys think this is kind of like a canary in the coal mine type situation and there's more pain to come, more shoes to fall?
00:08:01.980 - 00:08:54.722, Speaker B: The Operation Choke Point stuff, I'm less worried about where it's kind of like this shadow cut off of the US banking system from crypto. I'm less worried about that because crypto has been through that before and there's very few amount of counterparties that need to directly interact with a bank and crypto at the same time. And we have stablecoins now, and so we kind of know how to patch that while things generally improve. But there's other stuff as well. I was trying to buy, and I don't know if this is related to Operation Choke Point or things like that, I was trying to buy ETH for one of my friends. So you could participate in an NFT sale through Rainbow, and I bought a bunch of ETH through Rainbow a bunch of times, but at this point, my credit cards don't work, my debit card doesn't work. The Auth rates seem to be falling in terms of just being able to buy an on ramp onto Crypto in Visa and Mastercard, in the places that matter to retail.
00:08:54.722 - 00:09:18.110, Speaker B: And so those are the things which probably slow the space meaningfully in the long term if that continues, but we don't really expect that to be the long term prognosis for the banking system and the credit card processors. I think this is kind of like a temporary backlash against all the stuff that happened not even three months ago, so not that surprise as well.
00:09:18.180 - 00:10:24.782, Speaker C: Yeah, one of the things that whenever we're failing doom and gloom, vance and I'll be like, all right, what are the worst case scenarios? What are some of the Black Swan event type stuff? And you can go down rabbit holes, let's say, with all that, and every once in a while we'll do that. One of the things that we were talking about earlier is way stronger than this, frankly. And if this is really kind of like the biggest shot that they have, and you can assume, right, staking has been real. Proof of stake has been live since September of last year. It's taken six months to get to this point. CBE, I believe, also launched probably around the exact same time as the merge happened and Proof of Stake went live. It's taken a while to be able to get to this point, and I would imagine that they've gone through a bunch of different scenarios, different paths, to be able to get to a point of what seems to be the ultimate goal, which is shutting down things that are misleading or nefarious for retail.
00:10:24.782 - 00:11:09.874, Speaker C: And I'm not too concerned, really, if this is the biggest shot that they've got. Granted, we once again recording at the time when we are. If there are bigger things to happen, who knows? But it does feel like if this path is true, and maybe Brian doesn't know, I would assume that to send out that Tweet thread, there's probably been some contact at some point, and they're probably discussing. So, like, I'm sure that this is a conversation that's happened between the agency and all the different operators of these different platforms so far, and I'm not really that negative if this is the worst thing, mostly because I'm ready for just about anything to happen, but this doesn't feel nearly that bad.
00:11:09.992 - 00:11:45.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to put it in perspective as well. Great point by Michael last cycle, we didn't have stablecoins. I remember when it was Bitcoin ETH and Ethereum Classic trading on like yeah, we have a lot to lose at this point because we've built a lot and the ecosystem is very robust. But we were like cavemen with sticks and stones. Even five years ago, three years ago, you build up 100 X, you give back 50 X, you build up another 100 X. That's kind of how this industry has worked for as long as we can remember it.
00:11:45.614 - 00:11:56.238, Speaker B: So I agree with Michael. Assume the worst case possible can happen. It still really doesn't disrupt the trend of crypto taking over the world if it really is as powerful as we think it is.
00:11:56.324 - 00:12:24.986, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. Just by the way, we keep using this phrase, operation Choke Point. Just some background on that. That was an operation that was launched by the DOJ back in 2013 or something like that, where they sort of had this informal blacklist right that was enforced against agencies that sort of the Obama administration just didn't love. A lot of them were pretty unsavory. It was kind of like payday lenders, which no one's really going to raise their hand and say, hey, like payday lenders. But then there were ones that were more in the middle.
00:12:24.986 - 00:12:55.058, Speaker A: There were like firearms and fireworks and stuff like that. And then there were some ones that I frankly, I don't think would stand the test of time that well. There's actually dating sites were on there. I don't know if you saw that, but that's a little bit of a moral judgment. Pornography, which is, again, kind of coming into the fore. So it just shows you that even in ten years or whatever, the overton window can shift on what's acceptable and what's not. I think it was actually ended up being a highly criticized operation because they went there's.
00:12:55.058 - 00:13:10.890, Speaker A: There's a way that you can do that right within the law, right, that has to go through Congress and you have to say, hey, this industry isn't conforming to laws or standards that we like, but they kind of circumnavigated that then choked them off financially. So I think it ended up actually having a pretty poor legacy, although maybe the government people like it.
00:13:10.960 - 00:13:43.940, Speaker B: So the SEC letter just came out, and the key quote I think I've read this for two minutes at this point, whether it's through Staking as a service, lending or other means, crypto intermediaries when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors, tokens need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws. That's gary gensler. So it does look like they did target the Staking program that was offered to retail and that was the source of the friction with the SEC.
00:13:47.210 - 00:13:56.870, Speaker A: Yeah, can you guys just describe by the way, but can you just describe why Gensler thinks that Staking product is like an investment contract?
00:13:58.350 - 00:13:59.530, Speaker C: Not a lawyer.
00:13:59.950 - 00:14:00.886, Speaker B: We're not lawyers.
00:14:00.998 - 00:15:06.480, Speaker C: We can't discuss that. Just like my very basic understanding, I would say, whenever you're presenting something to retail consumers or retail investors I mean, look at what happened with Gemini Earn. How many people actually realized that Gemini earn all the value that was going into that to get to four or 5% yield was actually going to one counterparty who is making loans out to institutions like Three Arrows Capital. How are you able to ensure reliability and safeguards for people who lost a ton of their money? Look at the winklevoss letter that was sent out, the teachers that lost life savings. There are actual risks in this industry. And if you're giving access to retail, I think that you have to put in the right safeguards, put in the right disclosures. Do people read those? Probably not just in the same way that do you really understand how wealthfront is giving you or how Robinhood is giving you three 4% on your latent cash in those accounts? I mean, they're probably going off and buying T bills, but I don't know if most people actually know that.
00:15:06.480 - 00:15:57.422, Speaker C: I think there's that element to it. I also think at the same time, lending is a very different product and a very different operation than Staking. And I wish there was a little bit more nuance in being able to compare the two because, yes, there is the opportunity to lose your stake if one of the validators that you're staked on gets slashed or does a double spend or whatever may happen to lose that value. It doesn't feel, frankly, and maybe this is just like hindsight being so terrible right now, it doesn't feel like there's that much of a risk as there was when you're doing opaque lending to other crypto institutions that may or may not be solvent. It just feels very different. And so to bucketize them all into the same thing, I think is tough. But it seems like that's the tact that they're taking.
00:15:57.556 - 00:16:49.642, Speaker A: So the last thing that I'll kind of say on the more negative front before, because I think there actually is a positive spin to this, I'm going to sort of determinately look for the silver linings here, but it's just if you zoom out and look at it holistically from a high level. I understand that there needs to be safeguards for retail when you're offering stuff like this, but put yourself in the shoes of an entrepreneur in this space who's trying to act in good faith and engage with the SEC and build new products in crypto, I mean, it's never looked bleaker to do that than in the US. Right now. So the business model of the US is like, we are supposed to foster innovation here and then make sure we take a cut. And we're industry leaders. That's our business model as a country. And I don't and I'm sort of just reacting to this live, but this just seems pretty counterintuitive.
00:16:49.706 - 00:17:14.520, Speaker B: It's always give and take, it's always back and forth. It's always who's in office, who's at the SEC, what's their tact and their positioning, and those things change. But this really is not the worst thing that could have like the worst case scenarios that Michael and I come up with are pretty insane. And so when you think of those, this isn't that bad. I don't think I want to scare anybody.
00:17:15.050 - 00:17:16.418, Speaker C: No fuds, no FUD pods.
00:17:16.434 - 00:17:33.600, Speaker B: No FUD, no FUD pods. But I do think there is a dynamic to this which I've alluded to, of what is the maximum fine that Kraken could have taken if they fought this, versus what are they willing to settle for and just put this away and keep going on about their normal business?
00:17:34.530 - 00:18:36.834, Speaker C: But to Mike, to your point, so one of the things we have definitely been active in, talking with regulators, talking with policymakers over the last couple of years, we've been a member of the blockchain association. We try to keep our finger on the pulse of what's happening. Obviously, it's been pretty negative over the last six months and nine months. But what really enables what you're talking about, but also defends against the and provides the safeguards, know what we're talking about here. What the SEC is talking about here is clear rules. If we had clear understandings of what was okay, what was not okay, how do you build this? How can you not build this? What are the confines of your sandbox that you can develop in before it gets to be something that you release? What are the disclosure requirements for different types of apps? None of that exists right now. And we're going back to depression era laws in many cases, or case law from the last four or five decades ago to actually develop concepts of what we can apply to 2020 technology.
00:18:36.834 - 00:18:54.242, Speaker C: And it just doesn't map. So I agree. I think it's not a failing of the agency because they have only the tools in their toolkit to protect and do that, but it is a failing of us not having clear understanding or clear laws to be able to move forward and foster entrepreneurship.
00:18:54.306 - 00:19:01.754, Speaker B: I want to put out one more take that I saw on like, I feel like I'm breaking news, just having the Twitter feed up next to this.
00:19:01.792 - 00:19:04.170, Speaker C: But that's what happens when you get two monitors.
00:19:05.150 - 00:19:38.406, Speaker B: We live in Big now. So this is Mike Selig, who was at the CFTC. So he knows what he's talking about. SEC views Kraken's custodial staking product as the security. Kraken allegedly pooled customers'crypto assets to provide superior and more consistent yield to customers relative to non custodial staking. This is a key difference that's absent in the case of direct and liquid staking. So the devil is really in the details of a lot of this stuff and in the implementation of not only what assets you're staking, but actually how you're staking them.
00:19:38.406 - 00:19:58.554, Speaker B: Are you pooling them? Are you going direct? So if CBE, I remember they're basically minting in batches because everyone is pooling their assets to stake. If you want that liquid stake token, a lot of this is going to be case dependent on basically each exchange and each staking provider. So it'll be interesting to watch maybe.
00:19:58.592 - 00:20:24.270, Speaker A: That we can transition like silver linings here in general which know outside of just staking services that are offered by exchanges. I would have to imagine that this is actually sort of positive for some of the liquid staking providers like Lido or rocketpool or some of those know without commenting specifically on any of mean how do you feel about kind of the ecosystem for liquid staking that's outside of the exchange hemisphere?
00:20:24.430 - 00:21:19.938, Speaker B: I think the stake has to go somewhere first of all, and so it is a tailwind for those types of competitors and we do hold Lido. So just like full disclosure there, I think it also is just underlining the importance of decentralization of these protocols. Just like Kraken staking is a lot different than Coinbase staking. Some of these providers are much more decentralized than others. And the goal of getting to a finished product like Ethereum where it isn't the core devs having to govern and change and modify things constantly to a product that's basically just autonomous allocate stake among validators has a reputation bootstrapping system that's really where this market is going to go. And I think that's one of the silver linings here is decentralization is no longer just a meme. Back in the bull market people centralized because they wanted to go faster and there wasn't really any benefit to decentralization because regulators weren't knocking on their doors.
00:21:19.938 - 00:21:34.250, Speaker B: Now people know that that is actually not the case, like you need to decentralize or else you're going to die. And really in the bear market things aren't moving that fast anyway so there's no benefit to being centralized other than additional risk to you. So I think that's a silver lining.
00:21:34.590 - 00:22:39.914, Speaker C: One thought experiment just in playing back the point that Vance made in the SEC letter, but also talking about decentralization versus centralization is maybe we just move to a model where you've got basically low veneer, low thickness applications. That manage the customer relationship like a coinbase or a Kraken. And they plug into these decentralized protocols, which are the actual protocols that are doing the staking, doing the aggregating, doing the creation of the LSD, the token receipt token. Maybe that's the business model that they have. And for that ownership, for that customer service relationship, for that SLA capability, they get some cut of the revenue that's generated by that operation. But it does change. Obviously the business model coinbase isn't going to be able to charge 25% on top of Lido's 10% but it is going to be something where maybe that's the new model for them going forward and they have to plug into these decentralized protocols and the concept of a full stack financial application probably gets disintermediated with pro decentralization protocols filling in some of these gaps in the infrastructure layers.
00:22:39.914 - 00:22:45.170, Speaker C: But that could be one model where everybody is appeased in this scenario.
00:22:45.750 - 00:23:18.586, Speaker B: Yeah. Money transmitter licenses are the reason why everyone doesn't offer custodial wallets. It's easier, it's much faster to onboard consumers. It's a better consumer experience generally. But the fact that those money transmitter license rules exist pushed everyone to develop noncustodial wallets, and really that became the future of the space, inadvertently. And so the regulations don't always work as they're designed, but sometimes there are positive externalities to how they work, and I think that is a positive case as well.
00:23:18.768 - 00:23:53.826, Speaker C: I still have so many friends who are deep in the investing space, pretty deep in the crypto space, very knowledgeable. They still will not touch MetaMask. They still won't do it just because they don't trust it. Signing a transaction. How do I store it? What if my assets get taken? You read about all these phishing scams. There is an element of maintaining and owning the customer relationship and providing security and customer support is going to be a business model for a company in the future. And that business model is only going to be routing those customer transactions to the relevant decentralized protocols that are underpinning these operations.
00:23:53.826 - 00:23:56.950, Speaker C: But there is a business to be made on both ends.
00:23:58.670 - 00:24:07.786, Speaker A: Who do you think has the leverage in that scenario? Like, let's say Coinbase becomes kind of a front end to Lido's backend or.
00:24:07.808 - 00:24:47.158, Speaker B: Coinbase wallet, the non custodial players that are big. It's kind of like MetaMask and Coinbase, and then there's like a huge drop off to third place. But if it trends in the direction that Michael's talking about, where it's a very thin application layer and everything else is offered by decentralized services, you look for who the middlemen could be. MetaMask has lido and rocket pool staking in App now. I think Coinbase probably gets to a point where they can't offer it by themselves and they see that market to somebody else and just kind of act as a middleman. So I think it's still those two players that have most of the leverage, really.
00:24:47.324 - 00:24:53.334, Speaker A: I'm just thinking about this now. How does Kraken unwind this product? Because they can't even I mean, you can't even withdraw.
00:24:53.382 - 00:24:56.106, Speaker C: You can't even withdraw your ETH until Shanghai withdraw it.
00:24:56.128 - 00:25:17.890, Speaker B: That's what, bankruptcy? No, it's a very small hole for them to cover, but I think you're going to have to wait the money is gone until Shanghai goes through. And that looks like mid March. So fortunately, it doesn't look like a multi month thing, but it's going to be at least 30 days until people get their money back.
00:25:17.960 - 00:25:22.574, Speaker A: Does this put more immediate sell pressure or withdraw pressure for East Staking?
00:25:22.702 - 00:25:57.118, Speaker B: I just don't believe that meme, honestly. If you look at the price points at which ETH was staked, basically everyone who staked ETH is underwater. And so it's not like people are waiting for this windfall that finally is coming to them. They may have a little bit more liquidity. They may sell the rewards, but selling their whole stake, that doesn't seem likely. I do think the retail with CBE know, think about that persona you took, your ETH, you staked it not in the normal way, you staked it through a liquid staking token and now you're going to receive the underlying back. That doesn't feel like an immediate I need to sell this case as well.
00:25:57.118 - 00:26:01.310, Speaker B: So I don't know. We're not really believers in that thesis, I would say.
00:26:01.380 - 00:26:53.630, Speaker A: You want to talk about another fund bankruptcy that is actually unwound in a somewhat positive way that we've been talking about for a little while, which is the DCG Genesis Gemini tie up that we've been sort of covering for a little while. So this is actually a positive bit of news from this week, which is now obviously pretty overshadowed, but it looks like they've sort of settled on that, actually. And basically the deal is so DCG and creditors, representing $2 billion worth of claims against its bankrupt Genesis lending division, including Gemini, reached agreement on a plan that includes DCG restructuring some $1.7 billion of debt and other obligations owed to Genesis. DCG would also contribute equity interest in another unit, genesis Global Trading, to the bankrupt lending arm. So actually, when I was reading about this, I kind of forgot that there are two different Genesis. There's the sales and trading and derivatives part, and then there's the hold co.
00:26:53.630 - 00:27:04.494, Speaker A: And the hold co is the one that went bankrupt. So some of this debt to equity conversion actually gives these creditors equity in the trading and derivatives business. So just something to note.
00:27:04.542 - 00:27:20.266, Speaker B: I think it's positive, but it's not like they're returning cash up front. It's like you get a hat, a shoe, like $15 and please don't talk to us again. What is the equity in Genesis worth?
00:27:20.448 - 00:27:21.590, Speaker C: Genesis Trading.
00:27:21.670 - 00:27:59.986, Speaker B: Genesis trading worth, not Genesis Global. They're going to have to sell that in bankruptcy or put it through some sort of restructuring so it can emerge. You're going to need to get all the clients back on platform and start trading again. You're going to need to rebuild trust with everyone. If you're somebody who's traded on there previously, who had their money stuck in it, are you now going to redeposit or not withdraw your fund from Genesis Trading? It just doesn't seem likely. So assume that Gemini and Genesis were pushing as hard against each other as possible to come to a deal that was mutually agreeable but also compensated creditors. I've heard the it's like people get $0.80
00:27:59.986 - 00:28:08.134, Speaker B: back on the dollar number. That does not feel close to reality, honestly. But I'm glad it's over. I feel sad for the creditors.
00:28:08.262 - 00:28:12.890, Speaker C: It kind of feels like you're paying back FTX creditors with Alameda Equity.
00:28:19.390 - 00:28:42.002, Speaker A: That's a little tough. I agree with you, though. I mean, what someone could do I don't know how much is proprietary in a business like the trading business. Of Genesis. I don't know if there's a tech component to it, but I guess you could I don't know, someone could theoretically rebrand that and auction off the equity. I don't think so either. Yeah, I know I'm trying to do a silver linings, but I agree.
00:28:42.136 - 00:28:44.658, Speaker B: I think the silver linings is in.
00:28:44.664 - 00:28:46.386, Speaker C: The rear view, it's done.
00:28:46.488 - 00:28:53.558, Speaker B: People have at least closure. They're not going to get all their money back, but they don't have to be left kind of wondering what's going to happen.
00:28:53.724 - 00:29:00.620, Speaker C: Yeah, it removes one of the things that could fall and an uncertainty in the market, which is nice.
00:29:01.390 - 00:29:36.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. So it turned out the winklefire. They ended up kicking in $100 million to that and DCG had to refinance the loan, basically. So they're basically taking on new debt to pay for the old debt that Genesis loaned them, which Barry's not going to like. And then there was a conversion of preferred stock in DCG. Or there was like a little fine print thing or another agreed upon subsidiary, which I don't know what that could mean. I mean, it's got to be grayscale, right?
00:29:36.172 - 00:30:00.342, Speaker B: I would guess to do some quick napkin math. So they had a bunch of GBTC as collateral that they sold, I think, basically at the lows. So that's $270,000,000. That was the figure that I saw last quoted. No, it's not more than that because they sold it to cash. That's 270,000,000 in cash. So they have 100 million from Gemini.
00:30:00.342 - 00:30:23.714, Speaker B: So you're at 370. The whole is 900. And so that's 33% right there. And then everything else is kind of like restructured debt equity in a holdco or bankrupt entity. That's yet to be determined. 80% is not the right number. It's probably like 40, 50%.
00:30:23.714 - 00:30:35.078, Speaker B: That would be my guess. And that seems to be where the claims are trading too, right now. Up to 80%.
00:30:35.164 - 00:30:42.134, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think it was ever like we expect to be able to get 80% back. I think it's getting something back.
00:30:42.252 - 00:30:56.666, Speaker B: Genesis claims are trading at 39% and none of these claims ever really trade hands. So this is more of an indicative number than anything else. But it feels like that's more of the real number than up to 80%, which is just a funny qualifier in general.
00:30:56.848 - 00:31:20.114, Speaker A: All right, there's a pretty good quote. I don't know if you guys know who Aaron Brown is, but he writes for Bloomberg sometimes. He's got a pretty good quote here. This deal simplifies the situation and makes it likely that more value will be salvaged. But the real problem is the value of the assets. It's much smaller than the value of the liabilities, and this doesn't change that. Merely simplifies the process of recognizing losses, distributes the remaining value and gets surviving parties on with their lives.
00:31:20.114 - 00:31:34.620, Speaker A: There will still be plenty of lawsuits. So I think it's kind of like it's removing a big risk from the market, but yeah, I think that is still the point. It did look like their liabilities was bigger than their assets, so I agree that's a good like a couple of gumballs and $15.
00:31:37.150 - 00:31:38.460, Speaker B: Your neighbor's cat.
00:31:39.630 - 00:31:53.822, Speaker A: Yeah, your neighbor's cat. Like an old stuff. Awesome. It's been hanging over fireplace. Sorry. Genesis creditors. Look, at least people can move on with their lives.
00:31:53.876 - 00:31:55.118, Speaker B: 40% is not nothing.
00:31:55.204 - 00:31:59.806, Speaker A: You want to talk a little bit about A 16 Z and their Uniswap governance debacle?
00:31:59.918 - 00:32:04.450, Speaker B: I don't think this is a debacle, really. I think this is just people being mad on the Internet.
00:32:06.630 - 00:32:47.898, Speaker A: For sure it is people being mad on the Internet. But just to give background, people are upset on Twitter. Basically, in December, there was a proposal made for Uniswap to deploy onto BNB, and the reason that they did this, they have a business license on their Uniswap V Three, and it's expiring in April, so they're trying to get ahead of that. Basically, after that business license expired, you could just copy the code and there's a bunch of volume on BMB. I think it's the third largest chain by TVL. So Uniswap has had success in the past when they've expanded onto other chains and they wanted to mimic that. So there was a temperature check, which basically passed with flying colors about where and how to deploy.
00:32:47.898 - 00:33:14.410, Speaker A: So there were two different choices for which bridge they were going to use. One was layer zero, and that's backed by A 16 Z and Sequoia. And then the other was Wormhole. So basically the temperature check pass for Wormhole. A 16 Z comes in. They said they didn't participate in the temperature check because there was an issue with their custody solution. But after that, they basically voted it down and they changed their vote.
00:33:14.410 - 00:33:33.678, Speaker A: The kind of interesting thing here is that A 16 Z has delegated a bunch of their Uni to a whole bunch of different groups, but including the student groups like Michigan and UPenn, I think, and they actually voted for Wormhole. So kind of interesting. Overall. I'd be curious, what do you guys think about that?
00:33:33.684 - 00:33:43.410, Speaker C: One point of clarification, which maybe I missed. Was it just the fact that they were choosing the bridge, or was it the fact that they were going to be launching on BNB with a specific bridge?
00:33:45.030 - 00:33:46.850, Speaker A: It was the choice of the bridge.
00:33:47.370 - 00:33:53.080, Speaker B: So they were mad that they didn't vote, and then they were mad that they voted too much?
00:33:55.850 - 00:33:59.382, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of had the same take.
00:33:59.516 - 00:34:25.950, Speaker B: This is how governance tokens work. So if you want more votes, you just have to buy more tokens. And I think that was how these systems were designed, and it seems to be working as intended. I also don't fault them for voting against Wormhole. I think that was like another part of the saga where it's like, oh, they're like playing favoritism. Wormhole got hacked for $300 million. Wouldn't be my first choice for a bridge to go somewhere.
00:34:25.950 - 00:34:55.450, Speaker B: And so yeah, I think this is kind of working how it's intended. There's always this trope against VCs and how bad they are and they're not voting at all or they're voting too much. We tried the Frog Nation experiment where Daniel Estes and those guys were going to kick us out of town and build schools in rural Africa and how dare Know participate in the capital markets of crypto. All of those people turned out to be frauds and blew. So like, we're the good guys everyone else can kind of just deal with like I don't really understand what the problem is.
00:34:55.520 - 00:34:57.894, Speaker C: It's capitalism in motion on chain.
00:34:57.942 - 00:35:07.166, Speaker A: This always happens. Whenever there's a vote that people don't like the outcome, they find a way to justify the when Trump won, I mean, people were literally like, we got.
00:35:07.188 - 00:35:10.190, Speaker B: To disband the electoral college, we're moving to Canada.
00:35:11.570 - 00:35:12.650, Speaker A: Moving to Canada.
00:35:12.730 - 00:35:14.080, Speaker B: We don't want you either.
00:35:17.890 - 00:35:46.618, Speaker A: Not to get political here, but I'm in agreement with you. Eventually someone has to make decisions. I think the thing with Dows that's a little bit frustrating sometimes is people are like, well, give it to the community. But who says the community, who are they as a stakeholder? Who says they're qualified to make decisions? Me personally, I want decision making in the hands of the most qualified people. And I get sometimes there are ulterior motives and interests, but you want dedicated, qualified people making.
00:35:46.704 - 00:36:31.346, Speaker C: The biggest thing that I take away from this is that when you have direct token voting on specific issues, you run into problems like this where whales can actually sway the decision of these votes. Are they the most equipped, are they the most educated to be able to make these decisions? I mean, I do know that Andreessen has a pretty robust governance program, as you were talking about. They delegate a significant stake of their ownership to different other voters. They also have people who are in house that just focus on governance. So I would assume that they were pretty well educated on this decision. But there are other governance models that are being utilized right now. There's a few different institutions, a few different protocols that have a representative democracy where the tokens actually vote people into the decision making capabilities and then those people decide and make decisions.
00:36:31.346 - 00:37:11.090, Speaker C: The other one that we've seen, and it hasn't really played out in a robust way quite yet, but optimism has a two chamber voting mechanism where there are community members and then there are also token voters. And you can make decisions based on both, just like the US congress. The other thing, too. And I know we're talking about ripping out this direct token voting, but it does feel a little bit antiquated for a protocol like uniswap to be still continuing to have this direct token voting mechanism, because you do have the whale games that can play out as we just saw, but it requires them to change it. And I think there's good experiments going on right now that have different governance models that are working probably a little bit better than here.
00:37:11.160 - 00:37:22.390, Speaker B: By the way. The goal should be that you finish the protocol at some point and you don't have to govern it. Like, if it's a protocol, it should generally end up in that. Like there is an end date for the ethereum roadmap.
00:37:23.450 - 00:37:58.882, Speaker C: Well, yeah, but also thinking about, okay, there's a new blockchain that comes up and it's not new, but let's just say there's a new blockchain, it's called BNB. You've got three different bridges that you could choose from to be the canonical bridge to bridge between your existing chain and this new blockchain. There are always going to be business decisions that have to go on for these protocols. Yeah, sure. The core of uniswap, especially uniswap V three, V two, those are done. You don't need to go and make minute changes to the code base, but you do have to make business decisions as to where you want to expand, to how you want to expand there. And so I think there are always going to be some governance questions.
00:37:58.882 - 00:38:10.520, Speaker C: Maybe they get fewer and further between. But I think it goes back to the governance model. If you want to change the governance model, that could be a good step in preventing this type of stuff from happening.
00:38:11.370 - 00:39:02.954, Speaker A: That is the challenge. If I had to steal man, maybe why we were kind of talking about this before air, but I'd love to get your guys response here. There was a kind of back and forth on Twitter. People take these kind of crazy stances, which is, look, a 16 Z made an investment, right? They gave money and they got tokens in exchange. That's a super understood relationship, even in equity world. And usually when VCs give money, they'll also have some high level say, usually in the form of like a board seat, right? Not always, but a lot of time they'll have a board seat and then they'll have some say not necessarily in the day to day operations of a business, but it's like comp for executives if you spend over a certain amount, like really big kind of decisions get okayed by the board. I guess if you had to steelman a response like the choice of vendor here between wormhole versus blank on the other.
00:39:02.954 - 00:39:06.250, Speaker A: But that doesn't seem like that's totally not true.
00:39:06.320 - 00:40:11.774, Speaker C: Kicked up to if you're making a decision, for instance, if you're a startup and you're making a decision of switching or making a major purchase from a GCP or an AWS, those are decisions that the board absolutely opines on and especially if you're changing or if you're know what would be a major decision. But I think the bigger question here is like, okay, who else if not the token holders, would be making these decisions so in the example of a startup you've got the board to make board level decisions but then you've got the management team to basically make decisions on the day to day operations of the company. If you're like choosing between who's going to be the caterer for lunches, that's something that the management team can make decisions on. You don't have to go to the board. But who is the management team in this situation? And who would be the ones that are making these decisions is my next question. So if it's not token holders, who decides who's? The one that actually writes the code to put in one bridge versus the other? It's not a direct comparable. I understand what you're saying, but there is an element of who's on first and who's controlling this thing.
00:40:11.774 - 00:40:22.226, Speaker C: And if the default is okay, go to the token holders to vote for everything. Some of these decisions probably don't have to go that high, but who else is going to be there in lieu of those people?
00:40:22.408 - 00:41:08.174, Speaker B: Choosing a bridge is such a big deal because it's literally the most dangerous part of anybody's stack in crypto. That is something that let's say that they did choose wormhole and they got hacked for everything, they lost like $300 million. Again, that would then be a decision that if Uniswap Labs made it, people would be going to their office pissed off levels. But if it's community and everyone has a chance to vote, and Andreessen only has, I think, four and a half percent of the supply, they vote 15,000,004.1. They vote 15 million and they delegate, I think, like the rest, the other 26 million, I believe there's like 30% of Uniswap float out there. That should be a fair fight. If there is opposition, they should be able to organize.
00:41:08.174 - 00:41:18.274, Speaker B: And if they don't, I don't really have any sympathy for them. Yes the big bad VCs voted there's enough tokens where you can go against them and win. You just have to organize.
00:41:18.402 - 00:41:56.158, Speaker C: Which in the case of a startup where VCs actually do have governance controls and legal representation rights in terms of their shares versus other shares, the entire math on that equation is completely flipped. Which is that the Investors and the Founders usually own about 80% of the company when all is said and done and employees are somewhere in the like ten to 20% and maybe this is fungible by plus or -10% but still, that's the rough math in this situation. It's absolutely the reverse. Which is? The venture firm owns 4% out of the 30 and the rest of the community and the rest of the owners and the rest of the team own the rest.
00:41:56.244 - 00:42:47.680, Speaker A: Totally fair and one thing that complicates this is it's not clear in some of these Dows I honestly don't know what's up with the Uniswap Foundation versus labs but it's unclear sometimes who that management team is. Every Dow has sort of a different answer to that. One thing that I thought was kind of funny here actually, is to your point, a 16 Z, they've got a good delegate program. They delegate to a lot of college groups. I'm not sure how aware people are of the sway that these college groups actually have in voting on some of these things, but I was talking to a budy of mine who's kind of in the dow tooling and infrastructure space. And there's sort of a battle going on at Aave between these two service providers, and he's like, pole protocol is controlled by these college of. I think that's kind of awesome, actually.
00:42:47.680 - 00:42:55.620, Speaker A: We talked to a college group at a UGA. I was like super impressed by what they were doing because those guys are amazing.
00:42:56.390 - 00:43:18.220, Speaker B: UPenn Michigan blockchain at Berkeley, Stanford. There's a lot of really awesome college groups that are doing a lot of good work on the governance side and think about other reputable institutions or places that would be willing to vote and be delegated these tokens. There's actually not that many, and the kids love Web Three, and so it's a good fit.
00:43:19.310 - 00:44:10.538, Speaker C: Yeah, it really does come down to I think, and this is why I'm a pretty strong believer in having a representative democracy at a lot of these token governance discussions, is because it takes someone who's incentivized with time to be able to actually dig deep and understand this stuff. Andreessen, they're lucky enough they have a governance program and governance team to be able to dig deep. But if they everyone does. Everyone who's actually the one who's collecting the ledger to make those decisions really fully educated on all the different trade offs? I don't know, maybe. But I'm sure at other funds it's not the case, but when you have a blockchain group, especially like a university student group, they're going to be spending time debating this. This is going to be like a problem that they work on at their last meeting. Which way should we vote? This becomes so much bigger for them and they're going to be so much deeper and involved in it because of that.
00:44:10.538 - 00:44:21.130, Speaker C: I think it's awesome to have that program. But to Vance's point, we need to find other institutions, not just blockchain groups at universities that could provide that level of service to these protocols.
00:44:21.290 - 00:44:42.134, Speaker B: I would love to see a lot of large companies in the US. Participate in governance run validators for ETH. There's kind of like low touch ways that you can get involved with crypto that don't involve you pivoting the whole organization to see what's going. And so I'm hopeful that that plays out. We've certainly heard whispers of it, but nothing official has happened quite yet.
00:44:42.252 - 00:45:21.550, Speaker A: Just the last thing to kind of kind of touch on here. One thing that sort of always rubs me the wrong way in these discussions about the community. I feel like what's loosely being advocated for with that. People who would care a lot about the community and the community's perspective is almost like a majority rules, which devolves really quickly into like a mob rules type thing. There are examples of protocols being beholden to their community in pretty negative ways also. So it's a very positive thing about the space that people want to get involved with this stuff. But it's kind of unclear to me what the responsibilities of the community are as like a stakeholder.
00:45:21.550 - 00:45:25.074, Speaker A: I just don't get what their responsibilities are, to be honest with you.
00:45:25.192 - 00:46:00.766, Speaker B: Also, governing things is very hard. Even governing like a small company is hard. And when you throw in all these different variables, nobody said it was going to be easy. And a lot of these governance processes are designed to prevent not just fast and easy facilitation of day to day operations, but the worst case outcomes happening. And so you should kind of view governance's function first and foremost as preventing the worst from happening. And it going off the rails, which I think Wormhole is somewhat representative of, that it's give and take, nothing's perfect.
00:46:00.948 - 00:46:31.110, Speaker A: So I'd love to get your thought. This is another kind of interesting debacle going on. And not that that was necessarily a debacle going on in governance, but Stargate, there's something kind of interesting happening there. So they're basically reissuing their token supply because of an investment that Alameda made. So basically Stargate kind of came out a little while ago. There was a lot of hype around their launch and Alameda purchased about 10% of the total STG supply from the community sale. Sam and Co.
00:46:31.110 - 00:47:15.190, Speaker A: Promised that they wouldn't sell the tokens for at least three years, but they're not in control of those wallets anymore. So for kind of a low cap and low liquidity coin like Stargate, having 10% of your supply in a rogue wallet is kind of risky. And people started talking governance about what to do about that. And there was a proposal to basically just reissue the tokens so that the 10% supply that was allocated to Alameda would just sit in a multi SIG until the community decides what to do with it. On the one hand, I see where they're coming from, but on the other hand, guys, come on. That does not fly, I don't think. I mean, what's your thought on this?
00:47:15.260 - 00:47:19.010, Speaker B: You know who's going to really care about this? John J. Ray II.
00:47:19.090 - 00:47:19.986, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
00:47:20.028 - 00:47:35.130, Speaker B: John J. Ray wants those. Like it's not like Robin Hood is saying, should we just delete the tokens that are in know brokerage account? Like, no, you can't do that. Those are now subject to a bankruptcy.
00:47:36.590 - 00:48:34.506, Speaker C: Not only, not only that, just like there are few things that you can change about the monetary or about the supply or token model that a protocol goes out with one of them and it has to be done very carefully and not very often is changing the monetary policy. And if you're going to go through and change supply or you're going to change distribution, the second that you start making really big changes like deleting 10% of the token supply, guess what? Everybody's now just going to believe that you can do that willy nilly or print 100% more tokens or print 400% more tokens. That is more of like the sacrilege sacred cow that you cannot touch. Or if you're going to do it, it has to be done in a very careful way, slowly and methodically. This feels reactionary, and I think it actually would do more harm if it goes through than the benefit of having 10% owned by John J. Ray.
00:48:34.618 - 00:48:38.534, Speaker B: Did you guys ever read those are John's tokens. Those are not your tokens.
00:48:38.602 - 00:48:59.430, Speaker A: You know what this reminded me of? Did you guys ever read that Bill Browder book? Red notice in red Notice. Notice. This reminded me of what they do in Russia. You can buy stock in Russia and then it's like, oop, the board issued 90% new shares to this other company, so you're completely diluted. Or they'll just go into the record offices and change your stuff so you don't own the certificates.
00:49:00.410 - 00:49:29.646, Speaker C: Listen, we don't have rules around this yet. And I know they're made out to be the bad guys in our industry. But this is the reason why the SEC exists. Because we have efficient and secure capital markets more so than any other place in the entire world. Which is why we have the financial center of the entire world. And the security of those financial markets is based around a lot of very carefully thought out rules and regulations. One of the things that was floated towards the end of last year that I don't know where it stands.
00:49:29.646 - 00:50:14.560, Speaker C: It's probably on hold for now. But one of the things that I thought would have been one of the most positive advances for our entire industry is whenever you're releasing a token, there are rules and there are safeguards around how many tokens are going to be minted into perpetuity, what the lockup schedule is. There has to be disclosures around insiders when they're selling. In the exact same way that if you know that one of the CEOs of a publicly traded company is dumping their stock and they're not even allowed to because they have a ten b 51 plan, there are rules in place for a particular reason. I think if we can get there with tokens, that would be amazing. It would help build security in our capital. Yeah, I mean, this would be a great example that I'm sure the SEC would love to make an example of.
00:50:14.930 - 00:50:20.046, Speaker B: Did you say that Sam had the tokens and he promised not to sell them for three years or they were an investment?
00:50:20.078 - 00:50:22.674, Speaker A: I'm not actually sure if it was a contract or not because I've heard.
00:50:22.712 - 00:50:25.886, Speaker B: The former that there was actually no smart contract.
00:50:26.078 - 00:50:28.850, Speaker C: Actually, it's controlled by a pinky swear.
00:50:29.590 - 00:50:36.978, Speaker B: Those are legit secret handshake password tokens.
00:50:37.154 - 00:50:54.154, Speaker A: Can I ask you guys, why did Alameda win deals with these know, now I know the sheen has been lifted and we see Caroline Ellis, but they don't even seem like they would be as an entrepreneur, like meeting with that team. Why did people want to take money.
00:50:54.192 - 00:51:20.114, Speaker B: From they were they were the hottest. Not the hottest, but they were kingmakers. They could create ecosystems. They were going to go off and do Aptos and Mistan the same way they did Solana. And everyone was kind of like lined up to get their share of the winnings from that. It's pretty gross, but people really thought that they were the messiahs of crypto. People were giving them billions of dollars of credit.
00:51:20.114 - 00:51:28.040, Speaker B: Blockfly gave them 2 billion. DCG gave them up to, I think, four or five or 6 billion. There were no questions asked.
00:51:29.050 - 00:52:07.774, Speaker C: Listen, they were constantly referred to as the smartest guys in the room, coincidentally the name of the book about Enron. But I do think the storyline kind of went like this. It was they're going to offer us probably a two X valuation than we'd be able to get from discerning VCs who actually understand these markets. So we're going to take the money. What they've also told us is that they're going to put ten times the amount that they invest in our protocol into the liquidity pool. They're going to bootstrap our ecosystem. Whatever the investment was in, they would be participatory with capital after the investment.
00:52:07.774 - 00:52:27.290, Speaker C: And then it was also sort of like a wink wink, nudge nudge. Hey, we've got connections to FTX. You want to get listed? Great, we can do that. So it depended on the investment and depended on what they were building. But there are definitely multiple ways that they would be able to at least promote themselves when trying to get into deals.
00:52:27.630 - 00:52:28.570, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:52:28.720 - 00:52:49.982, Speaker B: They would also set the floor on ecosystems. So, like, if you were launching a Dex on Aptos or like an RPC info provider on Aptos, they would like at least 20 million. And so they were kind of like this permissionless liquidity pool for venture investments as well in this strange way. As long as you gave them tokens, which was obviously part and parcel of the fraud.
00:52:50.046 - 00:53:22.198, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so, yeah, maybe stargate time to rethink that a little bit. I want to talk about Spark a little bit, which is a new chain that Maker is releasing. So it's a fork of V three, but it's a new lending protocol that's set to launch in April of this year. One of the advantages there is that they have a line of credit from Maker called Die Direct Deposit Module to D three M. They do not need to pay liquidity providers. So basically you can borrow at the Die savings rate, which because of market conditions is currently super cheap.
00:53:22.198 - 00:53:51.426, Speaker A: It's about 1%. The other cool thing is they're integrating. They've got some sort of partnership with Element Finance, right, which is the protocol that strips out variable versus fixed lending rates. So you could borrow to fixed rate if you want and they're kind of building out a yield curve. Kind of seems like a pretty ambitious, exciting plan. It's kind of that DeFi trinity. I mean, you're starting to see some of these big protocols converge.
00:53:51.426 - 00:54:09.900, Speaker A: Right now you've got Curve that's offering a stablecoin go. The Ave stablecoin kind of launched this year as well. And so you see the business models of all three of some of these big DeFi protocols converging on one another. I'm not sure I have a super differentiated take, but it does seem pretty interesting. Curious what you guys.
00:54:13.230 - 00:54:44.534, Speaker B: Of. I agree with the DeFi super app stuff, and I think the carrot here is T Bill yield. You start a stablecoin, you print said stablecoin, you have Coin shares. Coinbase and two other people get in a bidding war over who gets to put it where, and you collect half of the yield by giving it to them. So especially in a bear market where people need runway and revenue, not surprising to see these things converge. But it's kind of like the lending and the stablecoin super apps are now all head to head. The rest of the market really hasn't taken on the super app stuff.
00:54:44.534 - 00:55:03.520, Speaker B: I think in time we're going to see like a perps and options super app as well. Just like those two categories kind of rely on each other for hedging and other stuff. But there isn't that same draw of know, create a stablecoin, give it to Coinbase. That option doesn't exist for them. But it's interesting.
00:55:04.530 - 00:55:39.490, Speaker A: I think part of the reason they did this as well is that the strategy for Maker was to get Dai integrated and the leading have I think they felt a little bit threatened by that or that that strategy wasn't necessarily working out. Like if Aave suddenly has its own stablecoin and if Curve, they're the ones who kind of set liquidity for different stables if they have their own. It's kind of a clear conflict of interest there. I think they saw their kind of strategy and direction being walled off by entities that they thought were going to be distribution but ended up being direct competitors.
00:55:39.650 - 00:56:45.306, Speaker C: The other thing that I'd add is and this isn't a comment on Spark in particular, or, frankly, like any of these concepts in particular, but one of the consistent conversations that at least I'm having, we're having right now. With Founders is there's a lot of people who are still playing for this November 2021 landscape of opportunity set that I just don't feel like is going to be there going into the future, at least in the short to medium term. Maybe in the long term. It comes back. But are you ready to brave the desert for the next two to three years? And I do think that there has to be some change of direction, change of pace, like looking at Maker, for instance, working on the coin shares concept, or at least entertaining that proposal, looking at the USDC coinbase deal, they are changing their direction actively. And I kind of wish that some of these major other protocols were at least thinking outside the box. And we've had conversations with a number of our portfolio companies who are just like, throwing up some crazy ideas, which is like, thank you.
00:56:45.306 - 00:57:06.994, Speaker C: Okay, this is good. Yeah, it's a little bit nuts, but I understand where you're coming from. The energy at the same time, maybe it'll work. I love the energy. You got to start playing for a different market. And you can't continue to assume that just because everything's been blown up that it's going to come back. And I don't think it's going to come back in the same way.
00:57:06.994 - 00:57:44.910, Speaker C: I think it'll come back, it'll come back in a different way. But you have to be able to understand that new direction that things are going to happen. And so generally when I hear about the next yield aggregator, the next like, here's a concept where we're taking this protocol and that protocol and doing this in the same way that we were. We were working on it for nine months and we're so excited to launch it. I feel like it's a little too late. And yeah, it's more of a broad comment, but I just wish we had more of the crazy ideas that got us into the DeFi into the first place and now we're going to be able to pull it into whatever the future of DeFi holds.
00:57:47.350 - 00:57:54.226, Speaker A: What you're talking about that sort of switch in perspective for founders. It's a tough thing. I get it.
00:57:54.328 - 00:57:56.290, Speaker C: Totally. It's the hardest problem.
00:57:56.360 - 00:58:23.100, Speaker A: Set has shifted from I have more money than I know what to do with everyone's throwing money at me, to the hardest problem being hiring, because there's so much growth that you're trying to go out there and capture it. And now you have to do a complete 180 and be like, there's not much growth to be had. And I'm probably going to have to do scrappier things that I thought I was going to have to do. It's a tough mental hurdle to kind of get and then you have to signal that to your team as well.
00:58:24.030 - 00:58:47.646, Speaker B: I also think we have more startups today in crypto than we've probably ever had just by virtue of the last funding cycle. And so you have large amounts of people trying to figure this out at the same time. But it is kind of the point. Entrepreneurship is hard. It's very unlikely that you will succeed. And it's just like only crazy people that really try it. Doing a startup is an act of desperation.
00:58:47.646 - 00:59:07.306, Speaker B: It's not like, OOH, this is my next gig. OOH, I just raised $25 million. OOH, I'm going to just hang out for ten years and slowly build this thing. You kind of have to be crazy to start one of these things to start with, and it's a low survival rate as a result. And so people just need to be more nimble, more scrappy. And just like, waiting is not really.
00:59:07.328 - 00:59:29.038, Speaker C: A strategy or playing to a past that isn't coming back is not going to work. The best entrepreneurs are the ones that can navigate that. We're starting to see some of them who can start to put pieces together even ahead of us, having a conversation with them. But it's almost time for us to start having conversations with people who are still playing for that 2021 Vision.
00:59:29.134 - 00:59:53.900, Speaker A: So we've made some hires recently from without naming any specific companies, but like, some of the big companies of this last cycle, and it's something that we've observed here. I'm wondering if you guys also see this in some of your port codes, but I think one challenge that a lot of entrepreneurs in this space is faced with is building for the market that exists today versus the one that you think might exist in five years.
00:59:56.990 - 01:00:52.854, Speaker C: There's actually a third, which is what I'm talking about, which is hoping for the previous market, which you know how to build for, to come back and waiting for that to come back. But absolutely. And this is kind of the hardest part, I think, which is to put something forward that's not either present or past and is forward looking. You have to make an opinion. You have to have an opinion and make decisions, which means that you have to have basically a perspective that cuts you off from certain things that could be happening right now. And you're putting your entire reputation, your company, on the table to say, this is the direction that things are going, and we're making a bet that things are going to go in that direction. I was at an off site for a portfolio company two days ago, and one of the questions was, how do you evaluate risk? When you're evaluating companies, there's basically three different types of risk.
01:00:52.854 - 01:01:55.920, Speaker C: There's market risk, which is like, are you building the right thing for the market? Are customers actually receptive to it? And that's more just like operational stuff. Then there's execution, which is like purely operational stuff. Like, do you have the right team in place? Do you have the resourcing to be able to get there? But the biggest one is timing risk, which is are you going to be at the right place at the right time when whatever it is that you're building, which is future state, is ready to be received by whatever market state is actually ready to receive it. And the only variable that you can really control and you do have some control over which market you're going after, but the only variable you can really control is how long you're in the market to be able to have these lines intersect. And that's the hardest part, I think. That's where really good founders have a stance, they have an opinion and they go after it and then they play for that. Great good founders who maybe aren't world class are like, here's where I think we are right now, and I think we can build this and I think we're moving in this direction and maybe they're nimble enough to be able to move with the market.
01:01:55.920 - 01:02:01.422, Speaker C: But it is an exceedingly hard proposition for most founders to be able to do really tough.
01:02:01.566 - 01:02:43.482, Speaker B: To be clear, we do think that Dex volumes will hit their all time high and far surpass it. We think that TVL will reach a trillion at some point. We think that on chain volumes will overtake centralized exchange volumes. I think what isn't coming back and those will produce very large winners for the categories, the categories that the people who are winning those categories will be very large. What's not coming back is everyone thinking that the 50th largest player is going to be a really big outcome. And so DFI is coming back, crypto is coming back, all of that stuff, we believe. But what's not coming back is the long tail froth of people thinking that the tams are unbounded and that everyone can participate.
01:02:43.482 - 01:02:48.900, Speaker B: And if I get this small cap token, it's going to be as large as uniswap one day. That's just not happening.
01:02:49.270 - 01:02:50.580, Speaker A: One last yeah.
01:02:51.350 - 01:03:01.000, Speaker C: You used to be able to get a top five opportunity, and if you were one of the top five in that market, you were still a big enough outcome to have Venture Steel returns. Now it's one, maybe two.
01:03:01.850 - 01:03:26.326, Speaker B: There's a good corollary here. Think of centralized exchanges. Right now, it's coinbase and binance. There was Bittrex, there was Liqui, there was the dozens of centralized exchanges that Michael and I used to use in our personal accounts before we started framework, full transparency, but those are all dead. Those turned out to not be venture scale opportunities where Coinbase and Binance really are. We're seeing the same thing today in basically every other category.
01:03:26.438 - 01:03:39.486, Speaker A: Funny, that's exactly the framework that I have for Media as well. I think there are three, I think there's room for three big brands and then maybe like a long tail of smaller substacks. Yeah, I know, exactly.
01:03:39.588 - 01:03:50.818, Speaker C: I mean, also think about Tech. Media back in the 2010 through 2020, you had TechCrunch, you had Endgadget, you had Business Insider was a big player.
01:03:50.994 - 01:03:53.398, Speaker B: Tech, Memes, and they were all going.
01:03:53.404 - 01:04:10.490, Speaker C: To be but like you had all of these massive huge that started basically as blogs that became Media properties. And I think TechCrunch is still kicking. Like they're doing well. But who else really from that era of those tech, media publications.
01:04:11.230 - 01:04:41.590, Speaker A: It's tough for founders. The other thing too is like, founders, honestly, the people who are the single solo founders have always blown my mind. I don't know how. It's a really difficult thing to do. I think usually people, when it works, there's like a balance there and hopefully you get one person that knows when to turn it on and one person will pull the reins back a little bit, let's just live to fight another day type thing. Usually that's not the same. It's very rare that that is the same person.
01:04:41.590 - 01:04:43.400, Speaker A: It's just a tough thing to do.
01:04:44.250 - 01:05:07.086, Speaker C: Yes, when we see pitches, it's definitely not a red flag, but it's definitely a question as to why. And frankly, how are you going to solve it. Because no one has every single set of skills. And that's why co founding crews are really important because they need to provide balance. And so it's like, okay, you're the solo founder, you created this. That's great. First job, day one.
01:05:07.086 - 01:05:09.098, Speaker C: Who are you bringing on as co founder?
01:05:09.274 - 01:05:51.870, Speaker B: Right. Last thing I'll say about the founders is the recent cohort, a lot of them are newer to crypto, and so they don't have that fundamental conviction of like, crypto is going to take over the world. And here's how a lot of people are like, you know, it's web three and we're trying to build this thing and we don't know if it's going to work and blah, blah, blah. There's no shortage of capital, there's no shortage of resources or people to build these startups. There is a shortage of conviction. And to Michael's point, being able to say, here's how the future is going to play out, here's how we're going to build it, here's how we're going to stay alive for long enough for that to work, and here's how all of our competitors failed. And what we're going to do differently than like, that is probably the most impressive thing that you can bring to the table as a founder when you pitch us.
01:05:51.870 - 01:05:56.670, Speaker B: But the general, we're going to do this and that is just not working anymore well.
01:05:56.740 - 01:06:21.854, Speaker C: And the only point of clarification that I'd have, which is Vance's last point, is here's how all of our competition dies. What is baked into that is, here's why we will be the number one in our category. Because that's the only outcome that you can be playing for now. It's not number I mean, maybe number two in a huge market, but it's not going to be number four. It's not going to be number five. Those are not going to be returnable investments. So no one who is a legit investor is going to take those shots.
01:06:21.902 - 01:06:23.240, Speaker A: Yeah, well said.
01:06:24.250 - 01:06:47.310, Speaker B: That's why things like WorldCoin are also appealing. It's like, okay, identity is like this kind of nebulous, unsolved problem. They're like, we have this super audacious vision to put these literal orbs everywhere on the planet. Scan your eyeballs, get your ID. There is a real path for us to be the number one competitor in this category. You kind of need to squint to see the future, but at least it's an audacious vision with a lot of conviction.
01:06:50.290 - 01:07:26.570, Speaker A: I don't know, a lot of the time it is the same amount of difficulty building something relatively small versus something large and super audacious. Totally just a book on this subject of Maker. This is a thing that I've always like. This fits into Rune's endgame somehow. So this is going to be a subdow or has the potential to be a subdow. That's what Spark is going to be. And then basically it's wholly owned by Maker, but there's going to be yield farming for the tokens.
01:07:26.570 - 01:07:34.960, Speaker A: I'm not going to lie, I really struggle with the end game for Maker. Maybe it's interesting, but we'll see.
01:07:36.610 - 01:07:50.926, Speaker C: I didn't mean to bring up this subject in the context of Maker because I actually do think that they're a great example of thinking outside the box and real world assets and putting things on chain that you would have never thought about and doing deals with coinbase.
01:07:51.038 - 01:07:52.574, Speaker B: Being number one in the category.
01:07:52.702 - 01:08:18.442, Speaker C: Being number one in the category. That that actually is a counterexample to my points. But it did pique my thought around something that I've been thinking about. Yeah, I mean, Rune has a know to your point, Mike. Who knows what the plan is or how it's going to play out and whether or not it's going to continue to work. But at least there's a plan and at least there's an opinion that's been made right?
01:08:18.496 - 01:08:34.938, Speaker B: And at least there's a resourcing to live long enough where it will matter. That's kind of the whole Maker end game to me. It's like we need to get revenue, we need to get ETH, we need to stake it, we need to get yield. And whatever happens with crypto, assume the worst case scenario, we're still going to be alive. That's powerful.
01:08:35.114 - 01:08:43.810, Speaker A: I do want to talk about infinity pools because I've spent like a couple of hours this week trying to wrap my head around them. I talked to the founder actually. Did you guys dig into this at all?
01:08:43.960 - 01:08:58.120, Speaker C: I saw your tweet and right before we hopped on, I started perusing the website. I'm so curious because we've gone down so many different idea mazes on infinite liquidity and I'm very curious to learn.
01:09:00.330 - 01:09:39.942, Speaker B: The core premise of infinity pools is you're leveraging the univ three LP tokens to generate liquidity for this leverage. We actually know a couple of startups who've built this before and have had real problems bootstrapping people actually lending out their V Three positions. It's very hard to such an extent that they actually pivoted away from this model. So I'm curious to see whether this is something new or whether this is something that's kind of older and rehashed the thing that wasn't coincidental was like the 50 people on Twitter tweeting at the same time that infinity pools are the next big thing. It's like, oh, okay, yes, propaganda, propaganda. Like, here comes I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.
01:09:39.996 - 01:09:58.330, Speaker A: Well, one of our analysts on their Zero X research podcast, they interviewed the founder today, so I'll hear from him about the mechanism, but they're more tactical than I am. Last funny thing, actually, just a little preview into web two. Did you guys see this bard failure from Alphabet?
01:09:59.230 - 01:10:00.634, Speaker B: I didn't see that.
01:10:00.832 - 01:10:03.658, Speaker C: Oh my God, what was it? 100 billion dollar mistake.
01:10:03.754 - 01:10:26.802, Speaker A: 100 billion dollar mistake. You can't make this stuff up. Google or Alphabet debuted their response to Chat GBT, which is an AI called Bard. In the commercial that they released, the AI came up with an incorrect answer. It actually took the market three days to figure this out, but when it did, it tanked like 11%. It was like 8% one day. And then it just keeps going.
01:10:26.936 - 01:10:32.200, Speaker C: Literally went from like a $1.3 trillion company to a $1.2 trillion company.
01:10:34.170 - 01:10:35.110, Speaker A: Oops.
01:10:35.610 - 01:10:54.400, Speaker B: I mean, you kind of have this view of big technology companies is fading gradually, but that's really not the case. They get carried out all of a sudden and it's just a complete disaster. I'm not sure if that's what's going to happen here. I'm not sure how hard it is to copy something like Chat GBT, but this is not a good initial sign.
01:10:55.250 - 01:12:16.518, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, independent of Bard, independent of all this stuff, not to reinvigorate a nice deep rabbit hole here one of the debates that I've been having with some of my traditional venture friends and investing in traditional stuff, which means, lo and behold, they invest in AI, is basically like, where does the value accrue? And I find this to be kind of like a fascinating thought experiment. If you've just created Chat GPT, does the value accrue to the API call that you're making where the application is paying Microsoft or OpenAI to be able to use Chat GPT or whatever GPT four concept they come out with Next and then the UI. And the skin on top of that is the sales productivity tool, the software development suite that is automated. There is an element here of the big ones are just going to keep getting bigger and Baidu is going to have some chat DPT competitor. Obviously, Microsoft now has OpenAI. Google has probably been working on Bard for years, and oops, they stumbled, but I'm sure they'll be able to figure it like all of the majors are going to be able to have this massive engine and I think it's going to reinvigorate growth for a lot of those companies. But does that accrue to startups in the same way that every other technology paradigm has? I'm hard pressed to see that.
01:12:16.518 - 01:12:42.960, Speaker C: Maybe you're able to. Like we were talking about with the Thin app on top of the D five protocol. Maybe you're able to sell like a SaaS business that has really sweet UI UX for the developer tool of the future where 99% of your software is written by an AI, but that just means that you're a UI on top of an API that's making calls to one of these engines. So I'm curious to see how it plays out, but that's my default stance right now.
01:12:44.130 - 01:13:28.654, Speaker B: I went to a talk about AI in San Francisco, and what struck me the most was kind of how nebulous the applications of AI outside of these large companies were. To point. Like, there was a panel of three or four people and they really couldn't describe a single startup that could build a real business out of this. Other than things like data labeling and offering their data to the large conglomerates who actually have the lower level modules. I do think we could potentially be in a crypto style Hype cycle for AI where not much happens other than just gradual improvements to these products that already exist. Am I excited to use Bing now. Yeah, I guess you could say that.
01:13:28.654 - 01:14:04.214, Speaker B: Like, chat GPT plus Bing is kind of interesting and I guess getting suggestions rather than just web pages helps me. But what are the long term ramifications of that? The ad market changes. We've already tortured the ad market to death to get blood out of a like there really isn't much else there, so I don't know if I'm an AI bear. I would say that AI is going to make everyone more productive. It's going to make companies run more efficiently, more leaner, more surpluses. And then where does that go? I think into kind of creating the next types of social networks and money and games that are on chain. I do think that eventually happens.
01:14:04.214 - 01:14:21.322, Speaker B: My wild card is that eventually one of these DAOs turns over their governance to an AI and just has it. Like goal seek for profit. Like to our earlier discussion, do we want all these the peanut gallery voting on things or do we want this super smart AI that's goal seeking to get more ETH, deploying makers capital? I would probably choose the latter.
01:14:21.386 - 01:14:24.800, Speaker A: Then we just got to invest in that baby and sit on our hands.
01:14:26.530 - 01:14:27.950, Speaker C: Step four profit.
01:14:29.890 - 01:14:48.390, Speaker B: Here's the thing. Who cares about some AI that does? Like chat responses that's broke. That AI has no money versus let's give an AI money and see if it can grow it into a trillion dollars. That's how you create something like Skynet. And that's what's most exciting to me personally.
01:14:49.850 - 01:14:55.620, Speaker A: That's a good place to end it. Fellas, this has been a fun one. Let's raise a glass to Skynet. See you guys next week.
