00:00:24.890 - 00:00:53.110, Speaker B: You everyone, we've got a great episode here, but before we do, I just wanted to give a quick shout out to permissionless. This is the biggest and best conference in all of DFI. It's the one that we do with Bankless, who's a great partner for us. Last year we had almost 7000 people there in West Palm Beach. We are moving this year to Austin, Texas from September 11 through the 13th. And if you are a listener of Bell Curve, any of these last five seasons, this conference is basically custom made for you. We're going to be talking about Liquid Staking, the theme of this season.
00:00:53.110 - 00:01:19.974, Speaker B: We've got a bunch of great panels on mev. If you listen to the app chain thesis, we've got a bunch of Cosmos folks out there in full force. We're talking about the converging architecture of Salana, the roll up space in ETH and Cosmos. So I would love to see all of you there and to reward you for being such great listeners to Bell Curve, you get a special 30% off code. It's Bell Curve 30 that'll get you 30% off tickets. Click the link in the show notes and then head over to the permissionless site and make sure that you get your ticket today. Again.
00:01:19.974 - 00:01:31.474, Speaker B: That is Bell curve 30. Click the link in the show notes. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got Michael One. Vance gentlemen, it's been a minute.
00:01:31.602 - 00:01:33.354, Speaker A: I thought we were going to have the whole crew today.
00:01:33.472 - 00:01:34.460, Speaker B: I did, too.
00:01:35.390 - 00:01:40.842, Speaker A: I was very excited for Michael's One and two. They're taking a lot of vacation days these days.
00:01:40.896 - 00:01:44.860, Speaker C: Vance, man, time to get to work.
00:01:47.170 - 00:02:10.342, Speaker B: Yeah, massachusetts. It's a fine state, though. We can excuse him if he's in Massachusetts. We'll let that yeah. All right. You guys want to just get right into Friend Tech? I feel like that's the I've never seen my feed taken over by something more than friend tech has been probably the last year. It's kind of died down.
00:02:10.396 - 00:02:33.226, Speaker A: It's dying down. It's dying down. And I can actually share this dune dashboard. Like, if you actually look at the transactions, the transactions have completely died down as well. Here, let me share this. It's back to where it was pre hype. So if you look at the transactions, for anyone who's listening, not watching on YouTube, pre August 18 transactions were about 1000 transactions a day when it started taking over.
00:02:33.226 - 00:03:03.058, Speaker A: Twitter about a week ago, started climbing. 30 00 40 00 50 00 transactions a day. And then on August 21 earlier this week, it peaked out at 40,000 transactions in the day. Now just a couple of days later, the transactions are all the way back down at about 1500 transactions. And if you look at the protocol inflows, I mean, this chart looks very similar. You can still see that net flows are positive, but only barely. We're looking at like one hundred k of inflows.
00:03:03.058 - 00:03:06.310, Speaker A: So this thing could quickly turn negative.
00:03:07.130 - 00:03:07.926, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:03:08.108 - 00:03:08.646, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:08.748 - 00:03:11.640, Speaker C: So they made three and a half million so far.
00:03:12.010 - 00:03:34.950, Speaker A: They've made three and a half million so far. And base, I mean, the impact on base has been that base is now I think, was processing at 1.16 transactions a second past arbitram and optimism. It's had an interesting impact on base as well. But Vance, I did notice that you are not on Friendtech. Man, I went to go buy you but couldn't get those keys. Why aren't you on friendtech?
00:03:35.130 - 00:04:17.360, Speaker C: I mean, first of all, I want to wait and build up the anticipation and the desire for something like that. Second of all, I'm just not sure that it's fully blessed from a regulatory legal perspective. I'm not going to pull a Nate Chastain and have one ETH be the thing that really fucks me over from something like this. And I think that's probably what a lot of the influencers that are even outside of crypto think about this. It's like, it's very cool. But the current crop of Friend tech people, it's like this weird amalgamation of crypto people. E girls, like OnlyFans girls as well.
00:04:17.360 - 00:04:26.226, Speaker C: It's not necessarily the biggest, I guess, on there from Phase Clan, but that's kind of like the biggest one probably.
00:04:26.408 - 00:04:36.030, Speaker A: So you can see people's holdings. And I saw one of the blockworks research analysts was just loading up on some e girl only fans.
00:04:36.110 - 00:04:40.470, Speaker B: I was like, oh Budy, for an investment.
00:04:41.210 - 00:04:42.280, Speaker C: Doing research.
00:04:42.650 - 00:04:43.720, Speaker A: Doing research.
00:04:44.810 - 00:04:53.334, Speaker C: It's always weird when you see something like that on the internet. Like one of your colleagues doing something strange on fence, like, oh budy, buddy, he's up.
00:04:53.452 - 00:04:54.646, Speaker A: I will tell you my thoughts.
00:04:54.678 - 00:05:04.542, Speaker B: Actually, wait, hold on. Before we get into the takes here, could you just briefly I'm sure most people listening will be familiar with it, but could you just give us a rundown of what is Friend tech? What is the app?
00:05:04.676 - 00:05:14.258, Speaker A: Yeah, friendtech is a platform that basically lets you so it lets you buy and sell shares in people. And I know that sounds kind of crazy.
00:05:14.344 - 00:05:17.598, Speaker B: Keys, brother shares.
00:05:17.774 - 00:05:55.614, Speaker A: Keys, keys, keys. The way that it works is I would actually recommend people download it not to go use the platform, but the user onboarding, the user experience and setting it up is unlike anything I've ever seen before in crypto. So you go to the website friend tech on your phone, you have to be on safari. You then add it to your home screen. I don't know if you've ever added a website to a home screen, but you do that. You then connect your Twitter and then you deposit ETH, and you deposit ETH just from the ETH. L one, you connect your MetaMask, and it does everything for you.
00:05:55.614 - 00:06:19.378, Speaker A: So you only sign one transaction the whole time. You sign one transaction at the beginning, and then you don't have to sign any more transactions as you're using the application. The next thing that does that's pretty cool. Is it? Auto bridges over to base for you. So when the app came out, you actually had to send base ETH over. But now it actually does the bridging for you. It's a really cool user onboarding and user experience.
00:06:19.378 - 00:06:48.480, Speaker A: So you buy your own share for like, $0 at the beginning, and then it recommends you upload. Or you add like, 0.1 ETH, and then you kind of get underway and you start buying and selling. And the mania was like, last weekend, last Saturday and Sunday, prices were going crazy. I think it was like Jeremy Alair joined and he went to half an ETH, and Ansem was at two ETH, and Kobe was like, untouchable at three ETH or something. And now prices have come back down a lot.
00:06:48.930 - 00:06:51.790, Speaker C: How does utility or value flow sorry.
00:06:51.860 - 00:07:16.694, Speaker A: I'm missing one other thing, which is there are group chats. So the group chats are like one of the more interesting things about it. People probably are like, the way I described it sounds very much like bitcloud. There are, like, three main differences between this and bitcloud, I would say. One is that bitcloud had this kind of schemey scammy growth strategy at the beginning where they auto added everybody to the platform. You weren't able to opt in. It auto opted you in.
00:07:16.694 - 00:07:39.870, Speaker A: So anyone from Bellagy to I was on the platform one day, I woke up and I'm on bitcloud. Even though I never opted into bitcloud friendtech, you have to opt in. So if you don't want to be on the platform like Vance, you don't have to be on the platform. The next thing is that you're actually able to withdraw. You're able to withdraw from frontek, whereas you weren't able to withdraw on bitcloud. But the third thing are these group chats. So the group chats are really interesting.
00:07:39.870 - 00:08:08.520, Speaker A: So I own a disclosure key because I like disclosure, and disclosure has been like posting behind the scenes of making some of his favorite songs. The video he posted today has never been seen before. Blau posted a song that he's cooking up that no one's heard before. Rob Leshner is just kind of like talking about cool DeFi stuff. Yeah. So there's these little group chats that are interesting.
00:08:09.610 - 00:09:05.274, Speaker B: One thing just on this volume, by the way, I would be long that the volume ends up returning. You know what this chart actually reminds me of that you showed in the beginning, yano was you ever looked at. Actually, can I share a screen here? The chart of Ordinals actually, it kind of reminded me of a little bit where there was a super intense peak in Ordinals to begin with, it looked like the entire thing retraced and then it just went all the way back. So if you look at the inscriptions over time, there was this super intense peak. It dipped back down, but then there's been sort of steady growth. And the thing that's still coming up for Friend Tech is there's going to be an AirDrop, right? So I think they announced that they're doing the point system similar to margin phi over on Salana, where I think they're dropping 100 million points. It's unclear what the monetary or token value associated with those points will be, but there'll be some sort of gamification thing there.
00:09:05.274 - 00:09:52.870, Speaker B: So they haven't even started to pour on the incentives yet. Really what they've been relying on is this sort of viral hook. And I am more in the camp of asking whether or not this is necessarily like a good thing to be trading your friends and whatnot outside of just whether or not it's legal. But I do think one of the things that I think is cool is there's a guy named Nikita Beer who I think is pretty good in terms of thinking about product. And he's always talked about designing product with a hook or distribution in mind. And I think this is one of the best examples we've seen so far in crypto of designing something that meets the market where it's at today with distribution directly built in. It's pretty cool, I think.
00:09:52.870 - 00:09:59.050, Speaker B: But the question of whether or not this is a good thing longer term, I don't know if you guys want to get into that, but I think that's probably a question worth asking.
00:09:59.120 - 00:10:13.230, Speaker A: I think, too, there's a funny example. He is famous for building his strategy, building social apps that have more hype than anything in the world and then selling them super quickly before the hype dies.
00:10:13.970 - 00:10:15.902, Speaker B: Sell the sizzle, baby, not the steak.
00:10:16.046 - 00:10:41.754, Speaker A: Sell the sizzle. Exactly. Did that playbook with Facebook and then he just ran the exact same playbook with Gas and sold it to Discord. The really interesting thing at the beginning was like buying and selling people. And almost the drama that came from that, it was like if you guys were on MySpace, like the MySpace top eight, it was like, yeah, exactly. I'm buying Ryan Sean Adams and he's dumping a Neil from Delphi. And it was this whole, like everyone was like, watching because you can see what your friends are doing.
00:10:41.754 - 00:10:58.560, Speaker A: That actually excitement has very much died down already. But what has stuck for me is I was checking it every three minutes. I was like, oh, what are people doing? Like, oh, Celsius is dumping everyone was dumping my shares for some reason. I don't know why they were doing that.
00:10:59.010 - 00:11:00.218, Speaker B: Must be confused.
00:11:00.314 - 00:11:36.010, Speaker A: I was getting yeah, but what has stuck are the group chats. And that makes me think that there's something there. Because the UX of the group chats is so remarkably bad, it's only one to many. So when, let's say, Vance, you owned one of my keys, you can message me, but other people in the group can't see your message. And I think this is actually not because they want it to be like this. But the engineering, there's a really tough engineering problem to solve there. So everyone can see when I basically send a message and then when people respond to it, I have to be like, Vance responded, quote this.
00:11:36.010 - 00:12:06.278, Speaker A: Here's what my response is to Vance. But even with that horrible UX, I find myself going back into the groups and I think it's a cool, like you're starting to see what the future I think of artists or musicians or I don't know, there's some EDM people who are starting to join. That's the model. I think the fan connection model of the future is what is happening. I don't know if it's going to be on Frenttech, probably not realistically, but I think that's the model that's going to play out in the future.
00:12:06.444 - 00:12:09.606, Speaker C: What do you think is next in terms of feature set that's coming?
00:12:09.788 - 00:12:18.626, Speaker A: Images and audio. Images and audio and more of a Telegram style group thing. Instead of a one to many, here's.
00:12:18.658 - 00:12:49.986, Speaker B: Another one that's not necessarily a feature set, but I saw this announcement from Aerodrome. So Aerodrome is the I think it's the dominant Dex that's on base. This is built by the team over at Velodrome, which is the I think it's the go to Dex on optimism. It's actually a fork of Andre Cronhey's solidly. But they announced that this is the Tweet. The friend tech revolution is coming to Aerodrome. That means Friend Tech keys can be wrapped as, ERC, twenty S and can be incentivized traded and Lp'd on Aerodrome, day one.
00:12:49.986 - 00:13:15.094, Speaker B: And to get things started, we'll boost any epoch zero voting incentives with arrow. So, I don't know, I think it's like even the ability to wrap and then trade fractionalized shares. I don't really buy that. The value of this thing is the group chats. This is the ability to speculate on people. I think it's more critical that people get exposure. Yeah, but let's call a spade a spade.
00:13:15.094 - 00:13:27.130, Speaker B: If you can wrap these things and you're incentivizing them and financializing people like that, I think people will do it. But is it as a desirable outcome?
00:13:27.470 - 00:13:56.166, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure it is. About the speculation and stuff, something about it feels less ponzi than some of the early like, you remember DeFi Summer? Everyone was like, I know this isn't going to last. I know this is like Ponzi, but it's like hidden Ponzi under three layers. This is like very speculative out in the open. I don't know, there's something about it being more like surface level speculation that I think and that's why it spooks people. That's why I think people don't like it.
00:13:56.188 - 00:14:00.460, Speaker C: But do you think this gets more or less fun if the prices go up ten X?
00:14:01.710 - 00:14:03.900, Speaker A: That's such a good oh, man.
00:14:04.270 - 00:14:07.994, Speaker B: Such a good question. Less fun. Less fun.
00:14:08.032 - 00:14:08.234, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:08.272 - 00:14:08.762, Speaker C: What do you think?
00:14:08.816 - 00:14:10.060, Speaker A: Way more fun.
00:14:12.270 - 00:14:14.940, Speaker C: I think it gets way more fun and then way less fun.
00:14:17.730 - 00:14:29.614, Speaker A: It gets really fucking crazy, and everyone's like, Aping into the market, and then the user base dies down because people can't afford to buy people's shares. I think you can, because there's always going to be new people joining.
00:14:29.662 - 00:15:22.146, Speaker B: I think there's a psychological element to this. I listened to the Santi episode that you did, Jason, and I sort of found myself nodding along with what Santi was saying, which is, on the one hand, there's a concept in psychology called cognitive dissonance. There's a really famous study that people did where you gave these two groups of people a mindless task to do. It was like, spooling a thread around this complicated bit. And in one group, you paid them one dollars to do it, and in another group, you paid them $50 or $20 or something like that. And then at the end of the study, they asked them which group had more fun, like, which one overall scored that they enjoyed the task more, and the group that got paid less reported that they enjoyed it more. And the rationale is that because I didn't get paid, I still have to come up with a rationale for why I did this thing, and it must be because I enjoyed it.
00:15:22.146 - 00:15:52.234, Speaker B: So, on the one hand, the optimist in me wants to say, man, look at what social media companies have done just by playing with people's dopamine receptors over time. Like, imagine if you added dollars onto that. That would just be supercharging it. But human psychology is weird, and it could have the opposite effect, too, where now that you're getting paid for something, you subjectively enjoy it less, and it could decrease engagement. That's one of those things where you just won't know until you test it out. But there's the opposite of that.
00:15:52.272 - 00:16:12.082, Speaker A: So I agree with that. That's a good cognitive dissonance. I've always thought that about media companies that offer tokens or payments when you read a newsletter. I think Decrypt did this. They were like, we'll give you $0.01 every time you open our newsletter. And I'm like, that is a horrible model, because now you've just attached the reader's time at, like, one cent.
00:16:12.082 - 00:16:30.006, Speaker A: It would make me want to read that thing less. So you get points on Friend Tech based on things that you've done and that's supposedly leading up to this AirDrop. And I hadn't actually thought about it, those points at all. I really hadn't. And then it's Friday, and they give out the points every Friday, and I didn't get any points. And then it actually made me be.
00:16:30.028 - 00:16:32.246, Speaker C: Like, Why didn't you get any points?
00:16:32.428 - 00:16:35.334, Speaker A: I don't know. I've been buying and holding people. I'm out of here.
00:16:35.372 - 00:16:36.530, Speaker C: DM razor.
00:16:36.690 - 00:16:46.522, Speaker A: I know. I was talking to the paradigm team about it. They're going to come on the Pod, but they're doing a media kind of quiet on the media front right now. But smart. Smart. Very smart.
00:16:46.586 - 00:17:16.440, Speaker C: Very smart. Very smart. I think they need to have a plan for the prices of this going up ten x and then what happens next? Because there's going to be resentment towards early people that have keys. There's going to be this disenfranchisement of the lower cast that couldn't get the keys that want to interact with their creator. And that is kind of like what ultimately is the big risk to a price downfall, which once these things go through the washing machine of price discovery, it's harder to get people excited about.
00:17:19.050 - 00:17:53.410, Speaker B: What maybe to take the opposite side of everything that I've been saying so far. I feel like post ECC, which was an amazing conference, I was definitely on the train of it was really infra heavy. It'd be nice if people were taking some risks on some apps. And it is refreshing to see a team take a shot at something. It's a shot on goal, and I actually think it's a good shot on goal. And the fact that it's inspired this much debate and engagement and some people love it and some people hate it probably means it's bullish, I would guess. I think if everyone loved it would weirdly be less bullish, the app.
00:17:53.410 - 00:18:01.158, Speaker B: So I don't know. I respect it's a four person team, too, that's doing this, so respect to this team.
00:18:01.244 - 00:18:03.160, Speaker C: Can we just do what Racer looks like?
00:18:06.010 - 00:18:08.658, Speaker B: His profile is still on private, I'm pretty sure on Twitter.
00:18:08.754 - 00:18:11.886, Speaker C: I know. I was in early on Racer on Twitter.
00:18:11.938 - 00:18:12.490, Speaker B: Nice.
00:18:12.640 - 00:18:19.894, Speaker A: Did you look at this deal, Vance? What's the backstory of this fundraise? Did they raise from a bunch of people? Was it just like a new paradigm?
00:18:20.022 - 00:18:42.020, Speaker C: No, I think they backed Racer just doing multiple things, like they did Steel Cam and then they did this. So I think if Steel Cam took off, they would have probably put resources into that, but it just ended up being this. And it kind of explains why the app is so not shitty, but just like primitive and rushed. That's kind of like my understanding, at least.
00:18:44.310 - 00:19:27.870, Speaker A: There's an interesting thing that might happen here, which is, so Friendtech is what's called a progressive web app, which it's just like a mobile app, but it's not through the App Store. And I could see Friend tech dying, all this dying, but Friendtech kicking off this huge wave of progressive web apps because the experience has been so nice. It skirts the Apple 30% fee. It feels like an app, like it's an app. And now that the full safari engine is just inside of an iPhone. You can write these amazing apps and AJAC apps that behave exactly like an app does, but it's not through the App Store. So this could start to be the downfall of the App Store monopoly.
00:19:28.690 - 00:19:48.918, Speaker C: I mean, it's so awesome that you get access to Apple Pay as well. And I don't know what the fail rate is of crypto transactions, but it seems like it's a lot better than I think a lot of this is what crypto games are going to look like. It's like our version of side loading, except you're just pinning a web app to your yeah, yeah.
00:19:49.004 - 00:19:49.734, Speaker A: You know who.
00:19:49.852 - 00:20:41.366, Speaker B: Jason, getting back to one of the other original things that you said, I have been thinking about the impact this has had on base as well and sort of the business model of what an L Two wants to do. And I don't know, I've been thinking more recently that Ethereum tries to be this very decentralized. I think that what they're producing is a commodity like thing, right? Which is what Ether is, and they're selling block space that's associated with that. But I think l two s their business model. Really what they're trying to do right now is they're trying to get that one runaway app that is going to onboard a bunch of developers and people. And in that sense, it's more like being a publisher or a VC where you're looking for that one investment that's going to pay back for your it's like a Power Law type thing. And I think that's probably how a lot of these L Two teams are thinking about it.
00:20:41.366 - 00:21:05.130, Speaker B: They're thinking, how can I attract the app that people are going to want to use? And yeah, it'd be interesting to see how much staying Power Friend Tech has, but I'll be really interested to see what happens to Base and the revenue that this brings into them. And by the way, the mev stuff, we could do a whole episode on the mev stuff that's playing out on base and fronttech right now as well. I think the bots are printing.
00:21:05.290 - 00:21:18.840, Speaker A: They're eating. I mean, you can't like the second someone signs up, their price just shoots up. That was like, the fun of it. I'd be like, oh, shit, I just saw that he signed up. I know that before anyone, but that's gone.
00:21:20.410 - 00:21:54.994, Speaker C: It just continues to also reinforce the point that the Cosmos narrative is now playing out on ETH. And just talking to Cosmos teams, they're like, man, we thought we were going to have USDC a year ago. We thought that all these things were going to happen. Getting validators up is super expensive. 14% inflation probably yearly. For your token, people are just going to launch L Two S on ETH, mostly on Op Stack, and then go to their own version whenever they feel the need to. But I posted that basic summation on twitter and John Charboneau replied to me, he works at a different fund.
00:21:54.994 - 00:22:03.570, Speaker C: He's really smart. He said that the 4844 spec will support 100 TPS combined across all roll ups.
00:22:05.350 - 00:22:06.822, Speaker A: Say that again. Say that number again.
00:22:06.876 - 00:22:40.254, Speaker C: That's 100 TPS combined across all roll ups. So roll up takes a bunch of data blob posts. It that's one. So what happens when there's 1000 roll ups? Because every pitch that I'm sure you see this too, everyone's like, it's a game, but also it's our own roll up. I wonder if ETH really accounted for that when they were thinking about their scaling roadmap, where it was like, what if everyone wants to have their own side chains and layer threes and stuff like that.
00:22:40.292 - 00:23:06.310, Speaker B: But dude, I feel like I've broken record on this. But Cosmos ran into this exact same issue, right? There are scalability challenges. I saw Alex Glukowski tweeted about this as well, but he had a slightly different TPS number. But he's like 4844 is not going to fix costs on ETH, especially if you still need to post. If you're still using ETH for data availability, that's the majority of the expense for roll ups.
00:23:07.290 - 00:23:07.906, Speaker C: Pretty bullish.
00:23:07.938 - 00:23:08.950, Speaker B: It's going to be tough.
00:23:09.690 - 00:23:39.860, Speaker C: You're going to need east of that for sure. The Cosmos story is playing out in a good way. But also to your point, a lot of the resource constraints are now we're not hitting them yet, but in a year I think people are going to be like, why do we have 400 roll ups? Because some of them are just I don't know if you've ever tried conduit. It's like an SDK for deploying both a roll up, but also like you can one click deploy uniswap and you need to bootstrap liquidity. But the point is you can just deploy these things.
00:23:43.670 - 00:24:17.754, Speaker B: There that whole thing. I think Michael and I talked about this. The last one we did just solo. But that is also because I think the analogy for conduit and optimism is like Red Hat and Linux, where I think what they're discovering is that the optimism created a lot of value with this open source stack that anyone can use. Conduit might capture a lot of that value. And that's why I think you're seeing Law of Chains and like, hey, anyone can be part of the Op stack. But if you want to be like super chain, you have to have these sorts of parameters.
00:24:17.882 - 00:24:26.878, Speaker C: Nobody wants to be a super chain. Nobody wants to be an L three because you want to create your own version of Op stack because you are now the standard.
00:24:27.044 - 00:24:33.410, Speaker B: I got to be honest, I'm starting to get confused. But what is the difference between an L two and an L three in these stack architectures?
00:24:33.910 - 00:24:48.200, Speaker C: It changed the definition so much. If you use Eigen layer UNL two, if you're using Vidiums, are you and L two? I think the point is you're going to need ETH for all of that. And probably scaling is not entirely fixed yet.
00:24:48.810 - 00:25:44.006, Speaker B: Yeah. At this point, I'm scared to even overturn one rock in the roll up ecosystem because I'm going to not uncover this can of worms. I have no idea what people are talking about. I actually think there was an interesting discussion about this on Twitter the other day about what creates value for ETH. I think the most bullish thing ETH would be, and I think there's good evidence to suggest that it's going to play out like this, that ETH is the gas token for these roll ups instead of their native token. Yeah, I think that would be if I had unilateral control of ETH, I would make it so. My sole purpose was to because I think if you want ETH to be a currency or a commodity, there's like two ways that you can make the price go up to reduce the supply or increase the demand, and 1559 takes care of half that equation.
00:25:44.006 - 00:26:10.942, Speaker B: You burn ETH, so you reduce the supply, but you want a structural bid for demand, too. So the dollar did this, right? Like, the dollar was like, hey, we're trustworthy, right? We've all these great resources, and that's why you should want to use the dollar. But we also went out to Saudi Arabia and was like, hey, it would be great if you only let people buy oil in dollars. That'd be tight. And by the way, you can only pay taxes in the US. Based on dollars. So if you live here or if you want to do business here, you have to use this currency.
00:26:10.942 - 00:26:41.070, Speaker B: So it creates a structural bid for the currency that kicks off a virtuous cycle. And I don't know, I think roll ups that's like the easiest throughpath that I see for ETH. Otherwise, if you don't need to use it, like on ZK Sync, you can use they leaned into account abstraction. You can use whatever token you want for gas. You still have to pay data availability in ETH, but eventually you could just use Celestia for that and you could bypass a lot of the cost.
00:26:41.140 - 00:26:48.000, Speaker A: So you're just going to have maybe more than dozens, hundreds of roll ups paying these stakers ETH every day.
00:26:48.930 - 00:27:33.598, Speaker C: Yeah, phenomenal. 1000 roll ups paying ETH stakers, one or two ETH per day, plus all the ETH. L one demand, ETH could be a trillion with that economic model, if the price is all relative to the price, because it's like, is ETH worth ten grand or is it worth one grand? But assume these things are reflexive and the amount of ETH spent per day holds roughly steady, that makes a lot of sense as an economic model. The other thing on your point, Mike, my calculation of burned ETH is all of the burned ETH from EIP 1559, but also all the ETH that's been bridged to Arbitram optimism. Any lt in my mind. All price discovery happens on centralized exchanges. Whether we like it or not.
00:27:33.598 - 00:27:42.430, Speaker C: That ETH is not like coming back, like two hops to centralized exchanges to fill a bid that, in my mind, is basically locked ETH supply.
00:27:44.470 - 00:27:47.074, Speaker A: I have never thought about it like that. I like that.
00:27:47.112 - 00:28:00.546, Speaker C: Yeah. I think of these as like locking ETH in DFI. Your ETH is now locked in an L two removed from the supply.
00:28:00.738 - 00:28:02.870, Speaker B: Yeah, look at all you know what else?
00:28:02.940 - 00:28:17.690, Speaker C: Fintech shares too price in ETH. As long as we're doing everything denominated in ETH, that is the main thing that I care about in terms of what is the digital commodity that everything interesting is priced in. It increasingly continues to be ethereum.
00:28:19.470 - 00:28:58.802, Speaker B: One thing that might be bullish for ETH on the demand side as well is more weirdly, like more corporates launching L two S that people actually use because Base doesn't have a token. I'm assuming they might have a token eventually, but probably not until regulatory stuff gets cleared up in the US. And so they're using ETH as gas. So I feel like maybe that could be another catalyst. I don't know. But it'll be interesting to see how all this plays out. Did you guys see I know it's kind of a nerdy subject, but I found interesting that StarkNet is considering rolling out tendermint for their chain.
00:28:58.802 - 00:29:46.594, Speaker B: So Tendermint is the I guess now it's Comet BFT, but it's the consensus protocol that's part of the Cosmos SDK. So that's how consensus works. It's like an out of the box solution that Cosmos chains utilize. So one of the big open questions is how something like consensus or transaction ordering is going to happen on roll ups. Right now, everyone's got a centralized sequencer. Some people, I think, think that's okay, and that'll be how roll ups think about monetizing. Others are like, there are going to be a decentralized sequencer set or a shared sequencer set, but as soon as you start doing a decentralized sequencer set, you need to get some way to do civil resistance and you need some sort of ordering protocol to switch in between different sequencers.
00:29:46.594 - 00:30:15.246, Speaker B: So that's where they are proposing using tendermint consensus, which is pretty cool. I don't know how that's going to work. And I think the big question is what the sequencer landscape eventually ends up playing out as. But I thought it was pretty cool validation of the Cosmos tech, but not it's not no, it's not. No. Basically nothing's bullish. Adam unfortunately, that's the big problem.
00:30:15.348 - 00:30:27.058, Speaker C: Blocks interns are in shambles as a result. I mean, it's just tough flooding, honestly, for them, just given everything happening on ETH, that's just hard.
00:30:27.224 - 00:30:30.722, Speaker A: I like that you think all the analysts are bowled up on Cosmos.
00:30:30.866 - 00:30:38.280, Speaker C: One of them, yeah, they were talking all sorts of garbage to me. I was just like, no, this does not make any sense.
00:30:40.090 - 00:31:25.846, Speaker B: But wait, let me just do one more pushback on the Cosmos thing and then we can move on from this. But I think there is a sequencing element to this. I think we've talked about this before, but right now, okay, the app chain thesis is playing out on Ethereum. But to your point, Vance, even with 4844, that's not going to solve the scalability issues to support all of these different roll ups. And there aren't really any roll ups with Product Market Fit yet. So right now it makes sense from a cost perspective to launch a roll up on Ethereum, especially using something like Conduit. But in the future, if there was an app, like with Product Market Fit that had five or 10 million users per day, then maybe the economic shift for a roll up.
00:31:25.846 - 00:31:40.940, Speaker B: And it's like, maybe actually we want perfect control over our block space and actually we don't really want to be paying rent to Ethereum and we're going to go launch our own chain because getting 100 validators would be a trivial exercise. What do you think about that?
00:31:41.630 - 00:32:22.710, Speaker C: Whether these things have Product Market Fit or not, I think firstly, they're probably going to have some sort of token farming or they'll need to post some sort of data on chain. So 100 TPS in my mind is probably like 100 roll ups no matter how much or how little they're being used. And they may fight for priority fees to be included in the call data, but kind of is what it is on that front. Just like building your own chain is such a pain in the ass. I can't enough we have teams that have been at it for like a year and they're now saying, like, you know what, it's just too tough. We're going to go on Ethel too. That's where the assets are anyways.
00:32:22.710 - 00:32:49.890, Speaker C: We're planning on just like interoperating with them if we're going to be a tendermint chain. So I think it's difficult. It's expensive from an inflation perspective. I just really wonder if dYdX is going to be big enough to really bring it back. That would be the one way I could see this working in reverse, but we'll see it's going to be interesting, I think. dYdX launches in November, so not too far off.
00:32:49.960 - 00:33:45.822, Speaker B: Part of the reason dYdX is an interesting one, because the reason that they moved off of they were originally on StarkNet, I think, but they moved to Cosmos was because there are limitations. There are limitations. There are things you cannot do as an ETH roll up that you can do as your own chain. So for dYdX, what they thought was really important was to decentralize the order book. And the only way that that can work is in Cosmos if you make each of the validators run their own order book because they run the consensus and then they also run the application code. And even on an ETH l two, like if dYdX was still there, and you decentralize the sequencers, you could get them each of the sequencers to maintain the dYdX code, assuming they had their own app specific roll up with multiple sequencers. But it still has to settle down to ETH l one, and those validators could just change it up and extract their own mev.
00:33:45.822 - 00:33:49.206, Speaker B: They don't have finality yeah, I understand the dYdX problem.
00:33:49.308 - 00:34:02.140, Speaker C: It's also, like, more off chain than most systems that we're comfortable with. So that would be a constraint kind of almost everywhere, but I hope they do well. I respect what they're trying to do.
00:34:03.550 - 00:34:13.600, Speaker B: I respect people that are out here trying to take risks, which is why I also respect friendech. At least it's a swing. It's going back to at least taking swings here.
00:34:14.290 - 00:34:18.906, Speaker A: Let's talk tornado. Yeah, speaking of risks.
00:34:19.018 - 00:34:23.806, Speaker B: Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, it's very sad.
00:34:23.918 - 00:34:25.790, Speaker A: Brutal. Vance, you want to give the overview?
00:34:25.950 - 00:34:46.354, Speaker C: Yeah. Tornado cash is a non custodial mixer and relayer for mostly ETH assets and ETH itself. I think ETH is actually the biggest pairing. And there's all this stuff that happened with Know it's it's code. They uploaded it to a blockchain. There is a relay error system. There is also governance.
00:34:46.354 - 00:35:00.838, Speaker C: So there's like a few different factors to this, but the founders were arrested or charged. One was arrested and they were charged with money laundering for North Korea, which just sounds terrible.
00:35:00.934 - 00:35:02.714, Speaker B: Like a billion dollars, right?
00:35:02.832 - 00:36:13.134, Speaker C: It's like a billion dollars of money laundering. And I think there's good arguments as to whether it is or isn't money laundering, or if it is or isn't centralized. But that will be what the courts decide ultimately, and I think there's good arguments on both sides. What's shitty is that Roman Storm at least, is now in jail, and he's a guy that, in my mind is like, stands up for the right things in crypto, stands up for developers, for privacy, censorship resistant technology, and now he's just literally in a jail cell. I've known Roman for a long time at this point, so personally, a little bit sad about yeah, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of road on this to go where he goes to trial, he goes to court, fights, whatever, but it's just shitty. There's like, so many people in this industry that you could go after, and this is certainly a product that we would not invest in or use, but it's just shitty that it's him and it's the team and it's a continued enforcement spree on crypto founders.
00:36:13.262 - 00:36:49.290, Speaker B: Privacy is one of those things where I feel like more people should care about that one, but clearly, demonstrably, many people don't. And this is a fight back in the 90s when the Internet was coming into being about whether or not encryption should be allowed on the Internet. And it actually won, not because of any ideological battle, but because many businesses would not be valid on the Internet. And that's the type of logic that sits with US. Policymakers, if you can monetize it or not or make more money. I think actually crypto should probably adopt that same line of reasoning, but yeah, it's a bummer.
00:36:49.370 - 00:37:20.774, Speaker A: It's a huge I mean, the question there is like the same question today, which is there are some people who believe that technology is either good or bad, whereas technology oftentimes is just this neutral thing and it can be good used for good or bad depending on the intentions and the actions of the people who create it and who use it. Right. I think the responsibility here lies with those who choose to use technology unethically, not the people who are actually developing the technology oftentimes. And if you go, you ever seen.
00:37:20.812 - 00:37:22.070, Speaker B: Thank you for Smoking?
00:37:22.810 - 00:37:23.990, Speaker A: No, I haven't.
00:37:26.890 - 00:37:47.380, Speaker B: Everyone should give that a watch. But there's this the premise is that he's a lobbyist for Big Tobacco and he's friends with someone who's a lobbyist for the NRA. Yeah. And he's like, I was the NRA guy. I think that made this argument at a dinner. But it's know, if an airplane crashed, would you blame the airplane? Would you blame the.
00:37:51.750 - 00:38:32.846, Speaker A: I see why that's ridiculous, but I also see nuclear like Oppenheimer just came out. The scientists who created nuclear energy are not evil, even though nuclear weapons are capable of immense destruction. Because I don't know, you can also create nuclear like use nuclear to, I don't know, energize a city or whatever. Or like algorithms. Like algorithms are not evil, but if a company uses them to hack your Dopamine, that's probably not thing. Not a great thing. And I think I don't know, in the case of tornado cash, I don't know if you guys actually read the DOJ thing, but I think they said only 7% of their transactions were used by bad actors, like North Korea or whoever it may be.
00:38:32.846 - 00:38:37.458, Speaker A: That means 93% of people who are using it are good actors. They're people who need the product.
00:38:37.624 - 00:38:55.430, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, it's another instance of, like, if you are not really excited about crypto, this is going to be something that deters you from getting into the industry at the developer level, which is good and bad. It filters for the best entrepreneurs, but it cuts out a lot of the top of funnel, ultimately.
00:38:57.450 - 00:39:12.650, Speaker A: Vance you're saying that because if you're a developer, it kind of makes you and you're kind of agnostic to the use cases that you're building. It kind of makes you think twice about whether you could potentially be like a scapegoat down the line or totally if a bad actor ended up using your technology for evil.
00:39:12.730 - 00:40:00.780, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, ultimately the calculation on this stuff is political in most senses. It's like, what is a uniswap LP doing in a pool that has no KYC? Do you know exactly who you're trading against? Probably not. You can extend the logic as far as you want. I think it's just another scary point for developers where the people who are left in this industry right now are the true believer diehards where the stakes are high, they are the incumbents, they're going to keep winning. And this is just something that will deter competition. Because one of the factors that we just ask entrepreneurs is if you're building a game NFT whatever infrastructure, are you ready to live in somewhat of a gray regulatory zone. Most people, the answer is maybe to no.
00:40:04.910 - 00:40:05.322, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:05.376 - 00:40:21.266, Speaker C: Feel fair and don't blame for it. But life is risk. And the tornado cash risk is obviously different than the uniswap risk. But it definitely is one thing that keeps entrepreneurs up at night as it.
00:40:21.288 - 00:40:32.360, Speaker B: Would yeah, I don't know. This is one of those things where it's very like Oppenheimer is an interesting would. Do you think the world is better or worse off with nuclear technology?
00:40:33.290 - 00:40:37.000, Speaker A: I think it'd be better off if we actually use nuclear technology for energy.
00:40:37.450 - 00:40:48.486, Speaker B: Me too. But weighing the pros of nuclear energy versus the cons of being able to end the entire world, that's where I think it's a tough nuanced argument.
00:40:48.518 - 00:40:48.666, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:48.688 - 00:40:50.298, Speaker B: It's hard to be totally fine.
00:40:50.464 - 00:41:25.080, Speaker A: Then you have to zoom even farther out. And then it's like, I am pro technology. I think technology ends up making the world a better place and it makes like I don't know, it's just good. Technology is good for many, many reasons. And so if you're like shutting down nuclear as it's getting created, that means you need politicians and regulators who are smart enough to recognize that it's just nuclear we're going to shut down, and all the other innovations we're going to let go. But really how it works in practice is they're just like they turn into, you know that's why I think it's dangerous to shut things down.
00:41:25.770 - 00:41:39.180, Speaker B: The craziest thing about Oppenheimer that I found out in that movie was when they detonated the first atomic bomb as a test, they thought that there was a chance that it could light the entire atmosphere on fire.
00:41:40.110 - 00:41:47.920, Speaker C: And those humans still, I'm glad they took that risk. Yeah, I don't know. I haven't seen Oppenheimer or Barbie. I saw Sound of Freedom, though.
00:41:50.930 - 00:41:52.960, Speaker B: Wait, could you remind me? What is that?
00:41:53.330 - 00:42:37.610, Speaker C: It's a film. Well, it's based on a true story about child sex trafficking and a guy who he's like this FBI agent that is only responsible for finding kind of the pedos in the US. But he then kind of has this come to Jesus moment where he goes off and starts finding the actual you know, he's like in a riverboat in know, going into the jungles like no weapons, unarmed, and just like with vague plans like get these kids back. It's awesome. It's a true story and it has sold more tickets than Indiana Jones. And this is entirely not on topic for this podcast, but 2 million kids a year are in this type of slavery in the US. It's wild.
00:42:37.770 - 00:42:38.430, Speaker A: 2 million.
00:42:38.500 - 00:42:41.280, Speaker C: Yeah. Sex trafficking destination for kids.
00:42:43.350 - 00:42:48.180, Speaker A: Who is hiring? Who's the money behind this?
00:42:48.630 - 00:42:58.260, Speaker C: There's a whole supply chain of these things. The movie is pretty long, it's like almost 3 hours. So you get into it if you really want to know. Some of it's honestly hard to watch.
00:42:58.970 - 00:43:07.766, Speaker A: And I have a fucked up question which is who's at the end of the supply chain? Is it like just all creepy old dudes who want to have it's?
00:43:07.798 - 00:43:34.820, Speaker C: People manipulating parents into giving them their kids for talent shows or auditions or stuff like that. A lot of these people are not fully educated. So crazy movie. Recommend it. Jim Cavazille, the guy who plays the main guy was Jesus in fashion of the you know, he's going from strength to strength with his career. Nice talk about the debate, right?
00:43:35.270 - 00:43:38.734, Speaker A: I didn't watch the debate. What were the highlights?
00:43:38.862 - 00:43:39.540, Speaker B: No.
00:43:39.990 - 00:44:01.500, Speaker C: Everyone came for Vivek. Basically everyone kind of identified him as like the shadow candidate. That actually could be real. DeSantis is great. I just think he just kind of has lacked a personality and he just showed more of that and everyone else was kind of just a sideshow. Chris Christie looks ridiculous up there.
00:44:02.110 - 00:44:17.806, Speaker A: Ridiculous. I did. Like when he called Viveka Chat GBT candidate. So Vivek is now plus 1500 to win behind Biden and Trump. It's Vivek is now number is the leading candidate behind Biden and Trump.
00:44:17.908 - 00:44:22.110, Speaker B: Who was Vivek? I do not follow this stuff at all. Who is Vivek?
00:44:23.010 - 00:44:33.874, Speaker C: He was a biotechnology entrepreneur and there's been allegations that what he did in biotech was kind of like the equivalent of flipping an ICO. I don't know if that's true or not. That's kind of the brush that people.
00:44:33.912 - 00:44:36.034, Speaker A: Paint most biotech investments though, right?
00:44:36.072 - 00:44:55.580, Speaker C: Most biotechs are so volatile anyways. They're based on the earnings or the trials of the drugs and what they mean for future earnings versus any current business today. So I think there's good arguments probably for both sides of his background but I don't know, some of the shit he says is just completely out of left field.
00:44:56.190 - 00:44:57.660, Speaker B: Like a billion dollars.
00:44:59.390 - 00:45:31.574, Speaker A: He was at a hedge fund, he's very pro Martin Screlly. He started getting into so he made a shit ton of money, Mike. And then in 2019 I think his political aspirations started. He published a book called Woke that basically was like one of the first big critiques on Woke culture in corporate America. And his argument was that companies have embraced social justices to make profits not because they want to make meaningful change. And I think you're starting to see some of that probably come to life now. And maybe he was more right than wrong.
00:45:31.574 - 00:45:42.790, Speaker A: He's also been pretty critical of ESG investing standards and he's advocated for more like what he calls stakeholder capitalism instead of just like from the top down ESG standards.
00:45:42.870 - 00:45:44.698, Speaker C: He's 38, too. He's a young guy.
00:45:44.784 - 00:45:50.554, Speaker A: Young? Yeah, he was like 16 when he got into Harvard. Got his JD from Yale. Smart guy.
00:45:50.672 - 00:46:12.526, Speaker C: I don't like a lot of what he says. Him calling climate change a hoax is not helpful, in my opinion. But he is one of the guys in the Republican Party. That you're, man. Like, I look at Pence like, what do I have in common with Pence? Not nothing that gets like, okay, there's some common ground. He knows what I'm talking about. He's rapping.
00:46:12.526 - 00:46:20.406, Speaker C: Lose yourself at the Iowa Fairgrounds primary early. He's he's got something there for younger people, which is nice.
00:46:20.588 - 00:46:50.506, Speaker B: I actually forgot I was going to wear that off to wear this tomorrow, but I actually got served a shirt, which is like one of those presidential shirts. It was just anyone under 80, like, instead of, like, biden 24. Dude, end the gerontocracy. That is one thing I am 100% behind. It's just so depressing to see these ancients on stage, like, talking about this stuff and is that these ODS?
00:46:50.538 - 00:46:54.942, Speaker A: Yeah, it's Biden at 200, Trump at 270, Vivek at 1500.
00:46:55.076 - 00:47:03.150, Speaker B: Dude, we need a JFK candidate. We need someone who's young and seems like they have their mental.
00:47:05.210 - 00:47:12.402, Speaker A: Plus 1000. Here, I'll give you one better. Mike still a t's around them. Replace the J with an RFK.
00:47:12.546 - 00:47:14.166, Speaker C: Yeah, this guy's got a vaccine he.
00:47:14.188 - 00:47:42.160, Speaker B: Wants to sell you. I'd like someone who's young, who also I'm all for thinking outside of the orthodoxy, but you get too far outside there, too. I just like a nice, normal person who felt reasonable on stage. Is that too much to ask for? I just want someone who believes exactly what I believe. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before. Why can't we get some of that?
00:47:42.790 - 00:47:44.434, Speaker A: That's what I would vote for.
00:47:44.632 - 00:47:48.660, Speaker C: Pence's hair reminds me of my grandmother's haircut. It's like the short white.
00:47:51.350 - 00:47:51.746, Speaker A: If you.
00:47:51.768 - 00:47:57.460, Speaker C: Got Grammys, you know that's the short white haircut. He's Helen Barber he's working with.
00:47:58.150 - 00:48:08.898, Speaker A: Yeah. How old was JFK? JFK. Was like, 43. I think he was one of the youngest. Teddy Roosevelt was 42, but he came in after McKinley got assassinated.
00:48:08.994 - 00:48:10.694, Speaker C: Damn. You know your presidential history.
00:48:10.812 - 00:48:13.960, Speaker B: McKinley's a history major. Yano is a history major.
00:48:14.810 - 00:48:16.546, Speaker A: I got history facts on deck.
00:48:16.658 - 00:48:18.200, Speaker C: It all makes sense now.
00:48:19.610 - 00:48:34.560, Speaker A: I have history stat for you. Then we'll move on a presidential history stat for you. There have been 45 presidents, most people in the world or in the US. Their eye color is brown. We can agree on that. It's like, I don't know, some crazy stat or percentage. It's like 80 or 90% of people have brown eyes.
00:48:34.560 - 00:48:38.594, Speaker A: You want to know how many presidents have had brown eyes out of 45?
00:48:38.712 - 00:48:39.570, Speaker B: None.
00:48:39.990 - 00:48:45.986, Speaker A: Only four or five of them. Four or five. They've all had, like, blue or green eyes.
00:48:46.168 - 00:48:49.800, Speaker C: I got blue eyes, but I'm from Canada, so I can't run one day.
00:48:50.810 - 00:48:51.718, Speaker B: One day soon.
00:48:51.804 - 00:48:54.520, Speaker A: I'm Jewish and I got brown eyes. No shot. I got it.
00:48:58.330 - 00:49:02.970, Speaker B: Actually, before we go all the way back to crypto, do you guys see nvidia earnings came out yesterday?
00:49:03.390 - 00:49:07.690, Speaker C: Yeah, it's not bullish that they blew out earnings and that they're now tanking.
00:49:09.070 - 00:49:11.406, Speaker B: I missed that. I didn't even look at the stock today.
00:49:11.508 - 00:49:14.030, Speaker A: But they had it's pumping.
00:49:15.730 - 00:49:23.866, Speaker C: Last night. Yeah, after hour print. But I think people would be expecting.
00:49:23.898 - 00:49:31.826, Speaker A: A lot higher if they're up from 120 less than a year ago.
00:49:32.008 - 00:49:38.440, Speaker C: Totally. But look at the last, like, three months, it's been basically the same price.
00:49:39.930 - 00:49:44.520, Speaker B: So Nvidia, I just same.
00:49:46.970 - 00:49:49.222, Speaker A: Month the last three months, you're saying? I see. Okay.
00:49:49.276 - 00:50:46.966, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been doing extremely well. So Nvidia's, they've largely what they're cashing in on is the AI boom, and they've got these chips that are extremely valuable, very limited. There were stories we're probably talking on this pod probably a month or a month and a half ago, where I think, Vance, you were saying, right, that there are companies that were raising off of the ability to get their hands on these chips. And this was around the time that all the thought pieces came out from the VCs on Chachi BT and how AI was going to drive this whole big mean. I was, you know, a couple months later. I do think those LLMs are real and I think they'll be significant, but I do think they were extremely overhyped in terms of the short term impact. The question that I have for you guys is what would you guess the sales cycle looks like for chips? Like, how far in advance do companies need to purchase these things? I would guess far in advance.
00:50:46.966 - 00:51:03.600, Speaker B: So the question is, are these sales that Nvidia are talking about on this last earnings call? Is that a reflection of anything relatively recent in their business or were these sales locked in many moons ago? Because that's what I would sort of guess.
00:51:03.970 - 00:51:09.570, Speaker A: I have a dumb accounting question. Do their sales get recognized when they deliver the chips?
00:51:10.870 - 00:51:13.934, Speaker B: I mean, I haven't looked at it, but yeah, it has to be delivered.
00:51:13.982 - 00:51:15.198, Speaker A: It should be delivered. Okay.
00:51:15.304 - 00:52:09.654, Speaker C: So in my mind, it's the exact same thing in terms of hype cycle versus sales cycle as bitcoin mining chips like GPUs and custom mining chips that Nvidia used to sell bitcoin miners, which would be you have the hype of bitcoin going up and everyone rushes to order and there's no chips available. And so they know we don't have you this quarter, but next quarter or the quarter after that, we'll get you in. And so you have this natural lag effect once the bitcoin price pops, nvidia sales of bitcoin miners are still really strong for the subsequent three or four quarters, but eventually they come down, and so there's a lag effect. And I think what you're seeing is business that's already been locked in but if these LLMs don't start producing real use cases, at some point, all charts ultimately meet the same fate. Big up. Big down.
00:52:09.772 - 00:52:43.898, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm looking back at 2017 Navidea. So 2017 Navidea's sales to bitcoin miners accounted for over 10% of their revenue. And 2017 bitcoin obviously pumped Nvidia. Their stock rose 225% in 2018 when obviously bitcoin crypto crashed nvidia missed earnings targets because excessive GPU inventory built up due to overlooked crypto mining demand. Their stock fell 54% then that year. So it's actually pretty correlated.
00:52:43.898 - 00:52:54.482, Speaker A: It was pretty correlated to this boom bust in crypto. And I wonder if you'll see it like, pretty strong correlation with what is an inevitable some point collapse in AI. Not long term collapse, but the difference.
00:52:54.536 - 00:53:20.970, Speaker C: Is you can see the bitcoin price going up, you can't see the amount of money these VCs are Aping into know LLM companies that are trying to buy GPUs. Reed Hoffman raised a billion to go buy GPUs on a 3 billion valuation. And that Chat bot, I think, has like 3000 followers on Twitter. Not that bullish when you think about it.
00:53:21.040 - 00:53:37.460, Speaker A: And do you guys know Anthropic? Right, anthropic. So I actually think their product, Claude, is like the best of all the LLMs that I use. Like, you can upload PDFs and spreadsheets and all that kind of stuff. They have a minimum wage at their company. Minimum wage, it's $300,000.
00:53:39.350 - 00:54:15.102, Speaker C: There's a million dollar AI job at Netflix too. This is an inside bubble. This is like the venture capital bubble that bubbled up with WeWork, except there happens to be this massive public company selling them the inputs that they need. So, I don't know, I think the temperature on AI has gone down considerably in the Valley. Just like the use cases aren't as immediate as people thought, but probably last for the full year. And then I think 2024 is like delivery time. If we haven't figured out a new app other than Chat GBT, it's hard.
00:54:15.156 - 00:54:46.598, Speaker B: To see the business model. Remember there were these takes a couple of months ago. This was a VC who shall remain nameless. But again, comparing crypto, everyone that I know wants to work on crypto, but there's no use cases. Everyone that works in AI, everyone's like trying to sign up or something like that is the paraphrasing of this tweet. But, yeah, there were a bunch of people that were very interested in trying a free LLM, a sustainable business model that leverages. This is a little bit harder to squint and see, actually.
00:54:46.598 - 00:55:00.460, Speaker B: And I sort of just feel like AI is just going to be a great cost center reduction for gigantic orgs like Google or Microsoft is what I sort of feel like. But how investable is that? I don't know.
00:55:01.330 - 00:55:34.600, Speaker C: It'll give companies air cover to fire people in a way that doesn't seem ruthless and cold hearted. Like, oh, we let go of 50% of people because AI could do it better. That makes more sense. So I think that'll happen. But my experience of using chat GBT is typing something in, getting an answer, cross referencing it on Google. It's like half wrong. I edit it, I put it back into the email, I copy paste, and the last time I did that was like three or four months ago.
00:55:34.600 - 00:55:39.830, Speaker C: We'll see. I don't see a lot of jobs being automated.
00:55:40.250 - 00:56:24.018, Speaker B: Let's end on crypto quickly. I'm not sure how much on this podcast we've talked about Eigen Layer, but there was a bit of an announcement. So slowly, Eigen Layer is moving ahead and they talked about increasing the cap on their portion of LSTs that they accept. So here's a little dashboard. This happened on August 22, so a couple of days ago, and they capped the inflows to 100,000 e. So you could see just exactly how long that took before they capped it again. This is the balance for anyone who's interested in Steeth re, which is rock pool ETH.
00:56:24.018 - 00:56:49.838, Speaker B: I guess they expanded it as well to CBE. I didn't realize that CBE was going to be included, but mostly Steeth. But a healthy mix of CBE and Re seems to be about split. There's some cool. This is just a nice dashboard, actually. You can see withdrawals as well. But yeah, Eigen layer is it does have the potential to be a little bit of a catalyst that I think people are sleeping on.
00:56:49.838 - 00:57:17.910, Speaker B: The other thing I think people are sleeping on. I was thinking about this the other day. Celestia is going to launch their main net soon, so I would imagine we're going to get a Celestia token out of here soon as well. Yeah, I think people might be sleeping on that as a catalyst, to be honest with you. A big token like that, that's a project that everyone believes in. It's pretty l one e? I don't know.
00:57:18.060 - 00:57:21.206, Speaker C: I'm with you. I have no idea.
00:57:21.388 - 00:57:30.426, Speaker B: I have no idea either. I have no financial stake in it at all. But I just thinking the other day, like, man, it's going to launch and people are going to want to buy that.
00:57:30.528 - 00:57:58.760, Speaker C: I think we need the Dgens to be recapitalized. Basically. There's not enough for the funds to really eat here, but the Dgens can spin up some trading capital. The question is, is it from somebody else in crypto? Or is it outside of crypto? Or is it the sacrifice of another asset? So I don't know. We'll see. I don't see Celestia being mass market enough to bring in the normies, but maybe I can.
00:57:59.210 - 00:58:06.742, Speaker A: Yeah, well, bull markets don't get kicked off with normies. It's not like DeFi summer was a normie was a normie thing.
00:58:06.876 - 00:58:17.930, Speaker C: No, it was like the Dgens getting capitalized for the run. Yeah, maybe that's enough here. There's not as many Dgens as there used to be, so we have less mouths to feed.
00:58:19.390 - 00:58:23.520, Speaker A: I don't know, man. There weren't many Dgens at, like, the end of the 2019 bear market.
00:58:25.650 - 00:58:26.954, Speaker C: I was Djenning.
00:58:27.082 - 00:58:28.270, Speaker B: I know you weren't.
00:58:30.210 - 00:58:32.234, Speaker A: I feel like it's like the same crowd.
00:58:32.362 - 00:58:36.674, Speaker C: Yeah, it's good. I like the people who are left.
00:58:36.792 - 00:58:50.806, Speaker B: It was actually a big week for Circle. Would love to give a shout out to one of our favorite balds, Jeremy Alair, who? I just wonder what these guys think he is.
00:58:50.828 - 00:58:51.186, Speaker A: The goat?
00:58:51.218 - 00:58:52.070, Speaker B: Yeah, he's great.
00:58:52.220 - 00:59:17.406, Speaker A: Circle and Coinbase have been murdering the bear market. You know what I just heard from our head of finance yesterday? That Circle's Customer success team and customer relationship team responds instantly. Coinbase. Sorry, Coinbase's team. I've never heard Coinbase having good customer support in my life. I feel like just Coinbase and Circle been murdering the bear market.
00:59:17.508 - 00:59:55.274, Speaker C: I'm really interested to see how Coinbase evolves when the ETFs are a thing and it's 1% fees to trade the ETF versus, like, 100 on Coinbase. I think retail will still do Coinbase, but I think it'll bring a lot of liquidity that isn't on platform or maybe is on platform downstream, but something will happen there. But, yeah, their respective corp dev teams are just murdering it. A lot of good acquisitions, a lot of good new partnerships, and USDC is just printing. I do think USDC is vulnerable the longer that rates stay this high, but I don't know. Jeremy Larry, he got some tricks because.
00:59:55.312 - 00:59:59.194, Speaker B: People bring treasuries on chain and things like that.
00:59:59.392 - 01:00:11.950, Speaker C: No, just swap to die, stake it in the DSR, earn 5%. And every time you do that, in some ways, you're deleting USDC supply.
01:00:12.370 - 01:00:23.460, Speaker A: Yeah, but swap to die and get 5%. You know, it's easier than that. Park your USDC in Coinbase and get 4.5%. Yes, for 99% of people.
01:00:26.550 - 01:01:04.430, Speaker B: The actual details from Circle this week was there was some sort of increased partnership where Coinbase took an equity stake in Circle Centers, the consortium that they have. That's a separate governance body, JV, of Circle and Coinbase that ended up being dissolved. So Circle is taking control of USDC issuance and governance. And it looks like Coinbase and Circle equally share revenue in the interest generated income from broader usage of USDC, which is expected to be pretty sizable. I don't know what equally means. I would be sort of surprised if it was a complete 50 50 split. But it's interesting.
01:01:04.430 - 01:01:14.100, Speaker B: I mean, it feels like Circle and Coinbase are the allied forces or something. They're like the good guys joining hands.
01:01:15.590 - 01:01:32.646, Speaker A: Don't undersell that statement, though. Like, the revenue let me read. The revenue will continue to be shared based on the amount of USDC held on each of our platforms. Additionally, we will now equally share an interest income generated from the broader distribution and usage of like, that is pretty damn bullish for Coinbase.
01:01:32.758 - 01:01:33.580, Speaker B: I agree.
01:01:34.830 - 01:01:37.180, Speaker C: They're building a nice little business for themselves.
01:01:37.790 - 01:01:38.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:38.448 - 01:01:43.534, Speaker C: At some point, it's going to be profitable, and it's going to be really interesting as a public company, maybe that's like a year or two away.
01:01:43.572 - 01:01:52.350, Speaker A: But I mean, this thing combined with Base having like, a monster week and the stock not moving at all, I'm like, man, Wall Street is sleeping.
01:01:53.330 - 01:02:12.774, Speaker C: I think people are just starting to listen to macro podcasts again and get themselves freaked right out. That feels kind of like where we are. A lot of the progress there's real work that's going into crypto right now on a lot of different narratives, a lot of different levels. At some point that will be realized in the fundamentals and the price.
01:02:12.972 - 01:02:49.282, Speaker B: Yeah, last thing about so they also announced that they're expanding to six different chains. They didn't mention which chains, but there's a partnership with Shopify and Circle. They're using Salana Pay, where now merchants that are using Salana Pay can offer cross border USDC payments, token gated offers, and NFT based loyalty programs. So the average cost per transaction using salana is like zero point $0.25 as opposed to between one and a half and three and a half percent per transaction. Shopify is not nothing. They account for 10% of total US.
01:02:49.282 - 01:03:16.346, Speaker B: Ecommerce and $444,000,000,000 worth of global economic activity with 4.3 million online merchants. So, yeah, that's 17.2 times the amount of seven day moving average addresses on salana today. So bullish salana and cost aside, cross border payments is miserable. Like, truly horrendous be.
01:03:16.368 - 01:03:17.914, Speaker A: Kind of be.
01:03:17.952 - 01:03:22.538, Speaker B: I feel like usually I'm bearish on these sorts of things, but I actually think this sounds like a pretty cool.
01:03:22.624 - 01:03:56.210, Speaker A: You remember when Coinbase actually launched this? Coinbase launched the ability to do this. It might have even been with Shopify. The big difference back then was nobody wants to pay in ETH and nobody wants to pay in Bitcoin. And now that stable coins are tens of billions of dollars, there could be something here. I do think this is the return of this. And we saw a couple of new wallets like Beam had, like I think the payments narrative is starting to come back, which is exciting, right? Because Mike was saying this. It's like moving money from country to country is a nightmare.
01:03:56.210 - 01:04:36.306, Speaker A: Wallets, like cash app, Venmo, it's crazy. Those aren't connected. The existing networks like Swift and ACH, they're built in the freaking 1970s, right? They're closed to outsiders. I think payments are just very broken. And it's cool to see this coming back. I do have a counter take for the Circle thing, though, which is if you look at, I think, the argument and even I tweeted this, like, oh, USDC will bring fees down, I would bet. I need to talk to someone who understands fees better, because I don't understand it really? I would guess so what we're all arguing is that there's this fee, like 2% fee on Shopify and paying with USDC will bring that down.
01:04:36.306 - 01:05:00.870, Speaker A: What we're arguing there is that the fees go to cover infrastructure. Those are infrastructure fees. And the crypto infrastructure is cheaper. I bet, though, what a lot of the fees go to are risk fees. And that's like covering costs related to fraud prevention, verification, reversals, chargebacks, things like that. And that's not necessarily something crypto solves.
01:05:00.950 - 01:05:04.126, Speaker C: It isn't. And speaking of solana, I guess it.
01:05:04.148 - 01:05:06.206, Speaker A: Is, because there's finality, but you're still.
01:05:06.228 - 01:05:53.326, Speaker C: Going to have just a lot of the conversations we have with traditional asset managers are that especially at the fund level, this isn't cross border. Payments. But there are so many different collection points, fee collection points, places where expenses get stuck that just doing things on chain allows them to save so much money. There's no wonder that Circle has, like, 30 or 300 people and does, I think, probably like half a billion, a billion in revenue per year. It's just because it's built on blockchain rails. But the last thing I was going to end with is apparently they found 3 billion of assets to sell in crypto for the FTX estate, and unfortunately, Salana is 1.3 billion of that.
01:05:53.508 - 01:05:55.006, Speaker A: Oh, I didn't see this.
01:05:55.108 - 01:06:11.386, Speaker C: And it invests over the next, like, three or four or five years. But it starts in September. The sellers found more coins, basically, and the borrow rates on Salana have been spiking over the past week. So someone's kind of trying to get ahead of this, at least it seems. Probably Galaxy.
01:06:11.578 - 01:06:14.910, Speaker A: Yeah. Roman Storm is out of jail.
01:06:15.370 - 01:06:16.630, Speaker C: Shout out, Roman.
01:06:17.130 - 01:06:17.734, Speaker B: Nice.
01:06:17.852 - 01:06:18.614, Speaker A: That's good.
01:06:18.732 - 01:06:19.720, Speaker C: All right, guys.
01:06:20.090 - 01:06:20.930, Speaker A: Yeah. Peace.
