00:00:02.490 - 00:00:23.710, Speaker A: All right, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Empire and Bell Curve. If you are, we have a special little crossover f today crossover roundup. If you're listening on Empire, we are joined by our friend at framework ventures, Michael, and if you are listening on Bell curve, vance and Mipo are both in Paris, so we got Santi. Join us for this one. Welcome to the crossover, gents.
00:00:24.530 - 00:00:25.446, Speaker B: Great to be here.
00:00:25.468 - 00:00:26.440, Speaker C: Great to be here.
00:00:27.130 - 00:00:28.790, Speaker A: We got the black hoodie gang.
00:00:29.610 - 00:00:34.246, Speaker C: Mine's technically blue, but sure, I feel.
00:00:34.268 - 00:00:36.760, Speaker A: Like you don't like when I ever call your hoodies black.
00:00:37.290 - 00:01:04.746, Speaker C: I just don't wear black, dude. I'm not like the Steve Jobs kind of bullshit thing. No, but listen, speaking about hoodies, there's been a lot of hoodie activity in the punk realm. Punk ODC bought like, five hoodies and then resold them, and some of them have been selling for one of them sold for the lowest, I think, in a while. But there's been a lot of hoodie trades recently going back to that episode we recorded on punks, Santi.
00:01:04.778 - 00:01:22.920, Speaker A: Do you know that? So we recorded we've been talking about punks a lot on empire, and after those big trades happened, I got like, five different messages being like, this you, this you. I was like, I'm so glad that you guys, the listeners think that I have half a million dollars to go spend on a punk. I really do appreciate that.
00:01:23.610 - 00:01:32.810, Speaker C: Even sounds exactly the kind of thing that someone who did buy would say. So this might just be pure psyops. I'm not buying that.
00:01:32.960 - 00:01:36.650, Speaker B: But sure it's not you, right?
00:01:36.800 - 00:01:43.120, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Punks are ripping, though. You guys have any ECC? FOMO? Seems like a pretty good event.
00:01:45.010 - 00:02:38.160, Speaker B: Been hearing reports that it has been a lot of fun. I was on vacation the last two weeks, so Vance decided to go to represent framework. And, yeah, it's only been good things so far from what I've heard from them about the conference itself. I think the other thing that is definitely the case is it seems like this is the year or this is the time of the year when everybody just comes out with their big announcements. All the blue chips are coming out with major changes, updates, new products. It kind of reminds me of what happens with WWDC with apple, where it's like, oh, you wait till early June, and that's when you see what they're working on, and then it comes out later in the year, and it feels like that type of cadence is three years going at this point, maybe even four. ECC kind of becomes that announcement platform for everybody who has been working on really cool stuff for the last 612 months.
00:02:38.770 - 00:03:27.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the way that the industry is going to progress. By the way, I'm reading this book called I think it's just called build by Tony Fidel, the guy who built nest and the iPhone, and he talks about basically product cadences in new industries and in new companies. You just kind of shift things. You just kind of push things out the door, but that eventually becomes too exhausting for your company and actually eventually too exhausting for your customers. So where I think the industry is going is like what we're starting to see develop is these basically ebbs and flows of product releases and everyone kind of getting on the same page about when things will get released. So I have a feeling you will see, like, maybe and I think they'll be probably centered around big conferences. I think probably two or three times a year you'll see like big product announcements around ECC permissionless.
00:03:27.370 - 00:04:06.662, Speaker A: And then I would assume individual companies, as they get bigger, start hosting their own events. Salesforce has theirs, Apple has theirs, HubSpot has theirs, those kind of things. It's a good call out. I feel like there's been a couple of big trends that have come out of ECC account abstraction. Right. Vitalik had a big talk on account of I don't know if you guys watched it or saw any highlights or talked to Vance at all, but he kind of very clearly sees a future where all crypto users migrate from these externally owned account wallets to these smart contract based wallets and talked about two things. He said bad wallet and interoperability.
00:04:06.662 - 00:04:29.300, Speaker A: UX are the two major factors holding crypto from gaining more adoption. And that crypto wallet verticalization is long overdue and is very welcomed. And that, I think his closing line or something near the end of the speech was that wallet evolution can be called a success when managing a wallet becomes as easy as using an email account. I thought that was a good kind of like North Star for us to be working.
00:04:29.990 - 00:05:19.794, Speaker B: Yeah, the UX is only going to improve with account abstraction, and I think that's when we've talked about this ad nauseam on Bell Curve and I'm sure on Empire, but that's been one of the biggest elements of this industry that we've been holding ourselves back with. I think it's actually served us well for a lot of reasons. But as we move to scale, as we move to get to be table stakes future parity with CIFI, that's going to be something that has to change. We can talk about it as well, but it does actually dovetail nicely into what the Synthetics Team and Kane announced with Infinex, which is literally a off chain sign up email password. We created an account on the back end. You fund it, you don't ever have to really interact with it. But I think we're moving in that direction, not just on the protocol level, but also on the application level too.
00:05:19.912 - 00:06:12.690, Speaker C: Yeah, that's funny because Kane called me and said, hey, listen, I'm really tired of there's very few users DeFi in and of itself. I know it's been like two years of plus of bear market, and rightfully so. I mean, the criticism is like there's very few users, there's just a number of power users. But I think Kane has always been at the forefront. He's always ahead six months to a year and whenever he calls and he's been sort of in a hiatus and came back and said, hey, listen, I think now is the time to focus on UX. To your point, Michael, I think if you were to focus, if a Count abstraction came like, I don't know, two years ago, I don't think it would have been as impactful difficult to say. But I just feel like there's a time to invest in infrastructure and I think now we sort of are, if you think about probably infrastructure can support so many more users and activity.
00:06:12.690 - 00:06:33.050, Speaker C: And so I think now is really the time to focus on front facing kind of consumer applications which will come. We've talked a lot on Empire, I'm sure Bell Curve, like gaming and NFTs and just stable coins are the killer product of crypto.
00:06:34.110 - 00:07:09.170, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool to see Kane and Synthetix kind of leading the way for this next potential DeFi bull market. It's cool to see it. Yeah, infinex is cool. So my understanding of Infinex, maybe, Michael, you can fill us in a little more, is that there are a couple of big protocol announcements that I want to talk about. So there's Synthetics announced Infinex, uniswap announced Uniswap X chainlink announced CCIP, so maybe we can run through all of those real quick. So on Friday, Synthetix announced Infinex, which is basically my understanding is it's a derivatives front end to Synthetix. So Synthetix has this kind of on chain trading infrastructure.
00:07:09.170 - 00:07:45.762, Speaker A: It's a protocol for on chain trading. They are putting a new exchange that aims to take on centralized exchanges on the front end. It's a very easy to use, like optimize for the UX and the UI and the user sign up with an email and a password and that's just the front end. But it leverages synthetics. The trading protocol on the back end, I think it's governed by SNX, which is the native token of Synthetix. Platform's revenues are used to accumulate back to the token. That's kind of my understanding, but would love to hear your thoughts on big deal.
00:07:45.762 - 00:07:48.050, Speaker A: Not a big deal. Thoughts on infinex.
00:07:49.750 - 00:08:58.106, Speaker B: Yeah, one caveat I would say is the way the current system for Synthetics works is what I would call like in what they called the V two X state, which is you have all of the things that were existing in the last year, year and a half, two years. But I'd say what Infinex and frankly, what is required for launching Infinex is the move towards V three, which is more about creating new markets and new forms of liquidity and new ecosystems to trade. And so it's going to start off as semi permissioned, eventually move to permissionless, but if you have a new idea for a financial product. If you have a new idea for a trading apparatus or a mechanism like that, that's really what the new protocol upgrades within V three, which some of which are already on main net. I think the rest of it is supposed to come out by the end of the year. And then Infinex, to your point, is really just a consumer friendly way of accessing those markets. That doesn't require you to really be a DFI native and trust having all of your assets either in a hardware wallet on MetaMask and going through the rigmarole that we've all become accustomed to over the last few years.
00:08:58.106 - 00:09:49.158, Speaker B: It is really an effort to bring in new users to DeFi. So I think to your point, Kane is always ahead and really smart and calculated about when the right time is to do that. I think recognizing that the infrastructure is frankly ready, we have a lot of the tools in place to be able to accomplish the growth and scalability that we think we all should be having in DeFi right now. The UX has been holding things back. The other thing I think that Infinex recognizes is that it's not just going to be happening on optimism, where all trading activity is currently happening with synthetics. The protocol, it can happen across chain. And that's a huge element as well, where you don't have to just be relying on the liquidity that exists in a certain ecosystem right now.
00:09:49.158 - 00:09:57.882, Speaker B: You could be trading on avalanche or Arbitrum or optimism eventually. And I think Infinex would also be an abstraction layer on top of that too.
00:09:58.016 - 00:10:21.950, Speaker A: That's great. That's really cool. My favorite part of this is that I feel like 18 months into the bear market, everyone right now is so focused on infrastructure. And I think that was one of the main themes at ECC, like building kind of flat infrastructure. Nobody's focused on consumer products, nobody's focused on the front end. And Kane just comes out and is like, look, the infrastructure is here. Let's stop focusing so much on the infrastructure.
00:10:21.950 - 00:11:13.490, Speaker A: It's time to build better front ends. So I love the contrarian take here kind of dovetails into Uniswap. I don't know if you guys were following uniswap revealed uniswap x. Did you guys see my I think the high level take was so Uniswap Revealed Uniswap X, which is this permissionless open source auction based protocol for trading across AMMS and other liquidity sources. My understanding is it's an aggregator that outsources routing to this kind of open network of competing fillers that fill the swaps at the best prices through Dutch auctions. Getting into the details a little is like the swaps are gas free from a user's perspective, because the swappers are actually signing off chain orders, not on chain. The fillers then submit them on chain and to finalize the transactions, the fillers cover the gas fees.
00:11:13.490 - 00:11:44.000, Speaker A: I think right now it's opt in beta and then later this year, this cross chain update will be launched which combines swapping and Bridging into one A. It feels like this is Uniswap going kind of the opposite route of Kane. Kane is saying like, we need to have synthetics start focusing on the front end, start focusing on the user experience. Uniswap is here saying, look, everyone knows Uniswap for the front end experience. We need to start becoming like this kind of base layer infrastructure for building AMMS on top of. I'm curious what you think of that.
00:11:49.090 - 00:12:48.818, Speaker B: My quick take is I think it's actually very similar and it goes back to what we were talking about with account abstraction, where account abstraction really enables so that the end user is not the one who has to think about, okay, what's the price of ETH? Am I going to wait for gas prices to go down? Have to play that game? And really they can just put an order out on chain. They can specify how long they want the Ducks auction to run. I think it's like something from ten blocks to ten days. So you really have a long period of time where these orders are live and can get filled by a filler. I think it also just invites a new opportunity for a new player in this ecosystem, which is a filler. And historically in traditional financial markets, that is how most of the volume for retail flow actually gets filled. I think if you can aggregate liquidity on that side and get some real serious players involved, this could be the new place that spot markets are transacting in a very serious way.
00:12:48.818 - 00:13:35.602, Speaker B: But I think it goes back to the same principles of we need to optimize for growth. This is going to make it a lot easier for people who aren't necessarily uniswap customers already to be able to interact with Uniswap or any of the different uniswap pools. It will eventually become cross chain in the same recognition that we can't just rely on one single ecosystem for all of our liquidity and maybe people want to be transacting in different places. So I think from a principles basis it's very similar. It definitely is promoting and entrenching a lot of the Uniswap specific protocols. But in the same way that Uniswap has a lot of the spot liquidity, I think Infinex is going to be going after a lot of the so they kind of are a lot of the same in my mind at least that was my read.
00:13:35.736 - 00:14:01.258, Speaker A: Interesting. That's a really good point. Yeah, I guess what you're getting here is you're seeing two DeFi protocols try to really compete with centralized exchanges in this next market. I guess what you're building with Uniswap X here is you have access tokens from a bunch of different chains. You have no gas fees, much simpler UX than a lot of like remember signing up for just centralized exchanges. You have to take a picture of yourself, send in the license. It's like a 15 step process.
00:14:01.258 - 00:14:30.260, Speaker A: So you've got much simpler UX than these kind of old school crypto exchanges. And then I think my understanding too is for non fiat transactions, you don't need to do KYC AML, so it's much quicker onboarding, right? So if you combine those things, like access to tokens from a bunch of different chains, no gas fees, simpler UX, quicker onboarding, then you've got what Synthetix is building and Kane's building. You got two pretty damn good, decentralized exchanges that are going to, I think, go head to head with decentralized exchanges in the next market.
00:14:31.990 - 00:14:55.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that was also the explicit goal, too. I know Kane said that. I'm pretty sure I heard Hayden say that as well. But once again, we've seen everything that has happened in the last twelve months from a centralized entity perspective in crypto. And I think this is a recognition that it's time and we now have the tools to be able to have DFI take up the reins and run with it.
00:14:55.710 - 00:15:44.106, Speaker C: We discussed this. So yesterday I recorded a podcast with Rebecca and Jake, a regulatory pod, and of course the key word here now is programmatic. On the Ripple case specifically. Of course it talks nothing about DeFi. And my question to them was, hey, what about like, is that a programmatic sale? Because in my actually more, I would think that it would fit that criteria. But of course they were like, well, we don't know, right? And so I think, of course, there's still pending regulation to clarify that stuff, but imagine a world where it is you could see a lot of like I still remember in the early days of DeFi, there were so many people that were skeptical of this AMM model. Because if you come from traditional finance, right, everyone was like, this is not going to work.
00:15:44.106 - 00:16:57.410, Speaker C: I mean, order books are just better, right? And I think DeFi, the smartest people in Know, Kane, Hayden, even Vitalik and a bunch of folks, it requires a new level of thinking of what these new tools allow for. Not just copying exactly what is traditional finance, but innovating and creating kind of think about flash loans, think about AMMS and the consumer preference that everyone could be a market maker. What I'm trying to say with all this is it was pretty shocking. I think a lot of the skeptics really got behind the idea of DeFi when they saw how efficient and cost effective it was to trade stablecoins in a protocol like curve, because it was cheaper, and it still is, than going through a traditional centralized exchange. So I just like to remind listeners that DeFi is highly efficient, which is a lot of times there's a critical point of crypto, which is anytime you try to decentralize stuff, you lose efficiency, and centralized parties are just better. The reality is no and you minimize counterparty risk. So I think DeFi is of course there's been now chatter over the last kind of month or so that has been percolating around the resurgence of DeFi and people talking about real world assets and maker.
00:16:57.410 - 00:17:19.942, Speaker C: But I think DeFi is kind of forgotten and I think it will really catch people off guard when they see how a nice UX plug in into all the kind of the pipes that are already there and super battle test it and how quickly it will gain traction. So I'm pretty excited about Kane building in this direction.
00:17:20.086 - 00:17:22.154, Speaker B: Yeah, 100% agree.
00:17:22.272 - 00:17:29.660, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. Michael, you want to give us the overview on chain link CCIP before I say this?
00:17:31.330 - 00:18:05.990, Speaker C: When I first learned about framework, someone described these guys are like deep in chainlink, and of course chainlink was like doing all these announcements to Google and it was like ripping the link marines were like, that was my first interaction with the framework. And then I learned that they were super deep into synthetics as well. So anyways, just for people that might not appreciate Michael's perspective on chain link, none of this is legal financial advice, but this is someone that has been deep in chain link for a while.
00:18:06.140 - 00:18:10.380, Speaker A: Michael, do you have a link marines? Like anon account? Are you like one of the big?
00:18:12.430 - 00:18:16.860, Speaker B: I've been accused of that many times, but no, I'm not.
00:18:17.550 - 00:18:20.780, Speaker C: Again, something that if you were a true link.
00:18:25.250 - 00:18:37.650, Speaker B: Yeah, Vance and I got to know the link team actually like six years ago. It was like summer of 2017, and.
00:18:37.800 - 00:18:38.500, Speaker A: We.
00:18:40.390 - 00:20:02.300, Speaker B: Participated in the ecosystem basically before, two years before we started framework even. And so, yeah, chain link is something that we've been following for the better part of a decade at this point. I would say the insanely incredible thing that Sergeier has been able to do is he's been able to stick to the same exact thesis of where the industry is moving for that entire period of time and even before. So, I mean, he was part of a smart contract platform and company prior to chainlink and it's morphed has changed. Like, there's been new products, but the thesis has remained the exact same, which is really kind of what I would say CCIP embodies, which is the internet of smart contracts and the enablement of creating these communications protocols or a unifying communications protocol that connects everything, I think is the representation of where this industry is going. We've talked about it from an infinex perspective, we talked about it from a uniswap X perspective, but cross chain is something that I think is just inevitable at this point. In the last couple of years, there were a lot of efforts, and I think Kane would even admit this, to basically have everybody build on optimism or everybody build on Arbitrum, or everybody build on whatever it may be.
00:20:02.300 - 00:21:07.342, Speaker B: And I think that what we're starting to see is the need to be able to have the complete trust and verifiability to be able to move assets across platform because there's just inherently going to be that in the same way that we saw with the Internet, too. It's not like one operating system or one ecosystem was the dominant and end all winner. You have to be able to have the interactability between different applications across platforms. So CCIP has been worked on for I don't even know how many years at this point, maybe two or three. It's been a long time coming, but it really does, I think, reinvigorate a lot of the stuff that we're talking about, which is improvements in UX, the cross chain portability of liquidity cross chain functionality. And there already are a number of cross chain communications protocols and ones that are working and scaling right now. And I think it's going to be an interesting question as to see what are the differentiating factors, what are the technical specifications, which one's better in those respects, because I think ultimately that wins.
00:21:07.342 - 00:21:42.070, Speaker B: But also who gets the most distribution and who's going to be able to plug in to be that cross chain transport layer. But Chainlink is starting off with a huge list of existing partners and so being able to have this on mainnet I think is a huge thing. It definitely does breathe a lot more air into the sales of Chainlink, which I'd say over the last year has been sort of a question as to when. It's always been a question of when is this coming? Two weeks, TM. But it is really fun to see it live. And yeah, hats off to the team for a huge accomplishment.
00:21:42.230 - 00:21:42.794, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:42.912 - 00:21:59.300, Speaker C: Michael, for someone who may not really appreciate the nuance here, what does this kind of enable or empower? Right? Because you have all the we talk a lot about there's multiple L1s, there's multiple L, two S. And so what is this kind of chain link fabric connectivity fabric enable that is not possible today.
00:22:00.470 - 00:23:07.382, Speaker B: Yeah, well, one of the things that it hopefully gets rid of in a lot of ways is bridging and bridges, as anybody in the industry knows, have been one of the biggest honeypots for hacks or losses of assets and funds. So hopefully this is a mitigant towards moving in just a better technical direction where instead of having a bridge facilitate assets, where you send it to the bridge, you verify that the assets are there and then you mint basically a placeholder asset on another platform where the original asset actually stays on the previous platform. That model actually changes where you can have native minting and burning on both chains. That is just a much better technical model. And what is required is you have to have this abstraction layer above both of those platforms or below, depending on how you think of the stack, which facilitates the native actions on both of those chains. And has the trusted verifiability and mandate to do it. So all of that I'd say, is probably the biggest thing.
00:23:07.382 - 00:23:57.720, Speaker B: But from a UX perspective, what this could mean is, as we're talking about in the case of like, uniswap X, for instance, where I don't know if they're going to use CCIP, but you can imagine the concept where somebody's making a swap on one end. They put assets up in know format, where the order exists on let's Know optimism, but the actual person who's filling it lives on Arbitrum. And instead of actually having someone have to send assets across to be able to fill the order, you would have the verifiability of the assets on one chain, which then would release the assets on the other chain. And only when the order is filled on the previous chain would you release them on the other chain. And so all of the messaging that is required to be able to facilitate that multistep transaction would be facilitated by something like this. So I think that's probably the best example.
00:23:59.210 - 00:24:21.760, Speaker C: Of course, we talk about trust assumptions that you're making when you're using a bridge or even an L two. In this case, there is a trust being placed in Chainlink and their ecosystem of partners that has been pretty battle tested at this point. But maybe if you could just touch on the trust assumptions that you're making while using this.
00:24:22.370 - 00:25:21.730, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's implicit trust in just what you said. Sante with Chainlink, has been the dominant Oracle provider and backstopping. I don't know how many billions of TVL at this point, but the Oracle solution to be able to enable that, I'd say there's also a direct trust assumption in that anyone who's facilitating these transactions and I don't know exactly I don't think they've gone totally into the Token model yet. But there is an implicit stake that you have to put up to be someone who's facilitating these transactions and therefore earning the fees for facilitating the transactions to have the transactions. It's not like these are just free messages that are being passed. You have to pay a fee either in the form of link or another asset to the operator who is facilitating the transactions. But then that operator also has to have some stake to be able to know that if they were found out to be malicious or made a mistake, for instance, there is a potential slashing.
00:25:21.730 - 00:25:28.598, Speaker B: And so in the same way that Ethereum has the slashing elements for validator nodes, this is the same thing.
00:25:28.764 - 00:25:59.774, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting we go always back to Synthetics because synthetics was one of the first to really adopt chainlink and I think at one point was the number one fee payer or was subsidized, but it was pretty much like really in the early days of DeFi Kane. I still remember we were having dinner and he said, listen, you need a Switzerland because they had like a pretty adversarial. There was an incident where the Korean peg just went out of whack and.
00:25:59.892 - 00:26:03.920, Speaker B: They'Re like, we just $4 trillion was minted, or something like that.
00:26:05.010 - 00:26:50.858, Speaker C: And it was interesting to me that was the first because of course, Chain Link had done all these announcements with Google and a bunch of created a really nice ecosystem. But you're in the midst of a bear market and you're tired of announcements. You're like, whatever. But that was for me the first time that I realized, okay, there is definitely a need to have an independent third party that is the Oracle here. And Synthetics really was kind of the first protocol and the experience that they had to go through of realizing that the hard way to me was pretty insightful. So anyways, all this to say is synthetics has just been one of those protocols that's been through the fire and just back and tested a lot of these solutions. It was pretty impressive to see how they really engineered token economics.
00:26:50.858 - 00:27:30.570, Speaker C: I mean, this is not a shield of synthetics any way, shape or form, but I was just super close to them as well. And so a lot of people credit DeFi summer to compound and certainly it triggered yield farming, but a lot of those elements were borrowed from Synthetics, like token economics and Staking. And then you had obviously Chainlink and then just Synthetics optimism as it relates to public goods. They were just instrumental in L2s because it was so expensive to interact and claim SNX on a weekly basis. So it's pretty fascinating to see how different protocols contribute back to the ecosystem.
00:27:31.230 - 00:27:44.094, Speaker B: Yes, and funny enough, I actually met Kane for the first time at a Chain Link and Friends dinner at the Web Three summit in Berlin. There, you know, it's all part of the same yeah.
00:27:44.212 - 00:28:12.010, Speaker A: Santa, you're an investor in layer zero as well. Is it fair to say that there's this kind of CCIP versus layer zero? Is that the kind of big layer zero or cross chain battle that we're going to see play out over the next couple of in the same way that maybe Arbitrum and optimism are battling or 2021? It was avalanche for salana. Is that kind of like the new thing that we're going to see develop is maybe layer zero versus Chain Link CC, IP?
00:28:12.990 - 00:28:47.058, Speaker C: It certainly feels that way. Like how directly competitive or complementary? I'm still processing, trying to learn about what chainlink, but yeah, when I first learned about chainlink, it's like, yeah, this is what layer zero is attempting to do. Is there a place for having multiple messaging services? You could argue maybe not. I mean, there's one standard, really, and if you look at the Web Two stack, there's really kind of one standard as HTPs. So I don't know. I mean, it's an interesting question. Like Michael or Yano.
00:28:47.058 - 00:29:18.814, Speaker C: I don't know if you guys have a strong view on. But if you have multiple messaging providers, does that create confusion or is there some sort of standard that the industry needs to align with? And how do these two say in a world where you have layer zero and chainlink? At the end of the day, whoever the user is is not going to care. I think you just kind of use the one that is the safest, the most efficient, the most reliable. So? Yeah. I don't know. It's a good question. Too early to tell in my mind.
00:29:18.814 - 00:29:21.600, Speaker C: But I'd be curious, Michael, if you have a strong view on it.
00:29:22.210 - 00:30:21.940, Speaker B: Definitely too early to tell as well. There already are a number of others even in addition to layer zero and chain link. So it does seem like those are the two biggest at this point. I think layer zero has come out and said that you will have to use ZRO or whatever the token is as a form of payment, which architecturally is the same as CCIP. So it feels like to Santi's point, maybe there's a world where everybody has to maintain some CRO and some linked tokens to be able to facilitate payments on behalf of these transactions. Maybe there's some easy way of making that happen, I think. Then there's also the question of how easy is it to integrate into these messaging protocols and is it possible to maintain those integrations for multiple if you need to? So all of these are big open ended questions and definitely agree it's way too early to tell.
00:30:22.310 - 00:30:51.994, Speaker C: Regardless, these two attempts are a step in the right direction because the current architecture of bridges is just a bit broken. I think we've seen that just in practice, there have been different flavors of bridges. Both you guys and I'm an investor in a number of bridges. It's worth trying these things. But ultimately I think the more elegant solution is something like CCIP or what layer zero is trying to do. So I think we're moving the right direction and competition is just the nature of the game here.
00:30:52.192 - 00:31:25.078, Speaker A: Exactly, yeah. I mean, all we're seeing here is just these we're just abstracting the networks away from the user level. So whether you're using layer zero or CCIP, at the end of the day, it's better for the user. Santi, you recorded a policy episode, policy and regulation episode this week with Jake and Rebecca that you mentioned earlier. I wasn't able to join you, but I saw that we put that live on Thursday. Any highlights takeaways from that that we missed last week when we were talking about things like the Ripple case and other stuff? Any unique takeaways there?
00:31:25.244 - 00:31:51.214, Speaker C: I'll spend like 30 seconds to a minute. I think the biggest one was Jake was very much in the camp of this case. Ripple is not a security and I think historically he said tokens are not like his point is very strong around tokens are not securities. The manner in which you sell them can have implications. But the Token itself is not a security and that has very strong implications around something like the Coinbase case.
00:31:51.252 - 00:31:51.454, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:51.492 - 00:32:55.630, Speaker C: Because they've been strong around this idea that we're not listing securities. And I think he agreed and both Rebecca and Jake agreed. The biggest winner here are exchanges, someone like Coinbase, because clearly the court was ruling very positively in the nature of those. Yeah, both of them said, look, this might be the most important piece of just ruling that we've had since they both joined the industry, which is really encouraging to hear candidly. And so both of them seem to think that there might be some penalty, that ripple at some point is paced because I told them, look, the biggest questions in my mind that I wanted to get their perspective on is so what does this mean for the rest of the industry? Because there is a nature by which I explain, as both of you guys know, but I'll just explain it quickly. There's usually an equity round that has some warrant attached to if there's ever a Token event. And that sequence and model has been pretty much a standard coming out of the 2018 ICO boom.
00:32:55.630 - 00:33:31.390, Speaker C: We all kind of moved in the direction of having safe plus warrants. And then at some point there's a token generation event, some of the investors and the company gets Tokens and there's airdrops and the community gets some stuff. And so the biggest point here is both of them said, look, it's just the programmatic nature of it certainly feels like for companies that are going to for token issuers today and down the road going through exchanges, you're going to see more of that and there will be just of course there's like nuance around for the investor piece.
00:33:31.460 - 00:33:31.646, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:31.668 - 00:34:13.578, Speaker C: If you're an investor in the company, you get Tokens. The key here is on a case by case basis, of course, do you have lockups? Do you have what is normally, traditionally, if you're like an investor in the company IPO is like you have a year lockup of sorts. And so these things are important. Anyways, those were like the biggest points that we touched on. I would encourage people to go listen to that. But yeah, in summary, both of them felt really bullish, of course, in this type of ruling. And then we touched on what is it, the McHendry Thompson bill and the Stablecoin bill, both of which are there's going to be markups on both coming up.
00:34:13.578 - 00:34:26.414, Speaker C: So that will be interesting to yeah, a lot going on. I feel like this is like the golden age for lawyers in crypto. I mean, it's always been pretty lucrative to be a lawyer.
00:34:26.462 - 00:34:27.540, Speaker B: I was about to say.
00:34:29.670 - 00:34:30.178, Speaker A: From a.
00:34:30.184 - 00:34:50.842, Speaker C: Visibility perspective, they're like the most popular falhood accounts now because they're impressively. So like a 16 z paradigm, you guys, there's been a lot of hires and a big coordinated effort of going on the offense here. And I think it's really encouraging to see that.
00:34:50.896 - 00:35:47.100, Speaker B: Candidly 100% agree. Only thing I'd also add to that is hats off to the blockchain association and all the work that they've been doing, coin center as well. It's a lot of the same sentiment and principles that we as the industry have thought about and been pushing for years. And I would say really nice to see the recognition. I would also add, and I haven't listened to the episode yet, but I would say this is definitely like at least our take is this is definitely really positive for the industry, like I said. But what I think the most positive outcome could be is that this just forces a more reasonable conversation from a regulatory perspective, from a policy perspective, and in lieu of just going down the regulatory path. And it taking another couple of decades for us to settle all of these lawsuits and situations through the court system.
00:35:47.100 - 00:35:55.070, Speaker B: So we're really hopeful that this lights a fire under policymakers to find something that works for the industry.
00:35:56.770 - 00:36:23.170, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, we've got a great episode here, but before we do, I just wanted to give a quick shout out to permissionless. This is the biggest and best conference in all of DFI. It's the one that we do with Bankless, who's a great partner for us. Last year we had almost 7000 people there in West Palm Beach. We are moving this year to Austin, Texas from September 11 through the 13th. And if you are a listener of Bell Curve, any of these last five seasons, this conference is basically custom made for you. We're going to be talking about liquid staking, the theme of this season.
00:36:23.170 - 00:36:49.726, Speaker D: We've got a bunch of great panels on mev. If you listen to the appchain thesis, we've got a bunch of Cosmos folks out there in full force. We're talking about the converging architecture of Solana, the rollup space in ETH and Cosmos. So I would love to see all of you there and to reward you for being such great listeners to Bell Curve. You get a special 30% off code. It's Bell Curve 30 that'll get you 30% off tickets. Click the link in the show notes and then head over to the permissionless site and make sure that you get your ticket today.
00:36:49.828 - 00:36:50.094, Speaker C: Again.
00:36:50.132 - 00:36:52.990, Speaker D: That is Bell curve 30. Click the link in the show notes.
00:36:55.990 - 00:37:23.494, Speaker A: Yeah, we got some breaking news coming in. CoinDesk just got bought for 125,000,000 by Matt Rozak and Peter Vesnas. I don't know if you guys know Matt Rozak, but he's been putting this deal together for actually quite a while now. He's been kind of the leading. So Backstory is DCG. For those who don't know. So DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.
00:37:23.494 - 00:38:05.350, Speaker A: DCG owns a lot of kind of tier one assets in crypto or what used to be tier one assets. CoinDesk grayscale genesis trade Block, another crypto company I'm forgetting the name of. Obviously, once everything blew up, specifically, Genesis needed some cash and they put CoinDesk on the market. A couple of months ago, there were a couple of kind of bigger bidders that came in, but I don't think Barry wanted to sell to some of those bigger bidders for reputation reasons. And Matt Rozak emerged as the leading bidder about a month or two ago. Rozak is the founder of a crypto company called Block. He's very like crypto OG.
00:38:05.350 - 00:38:42.734, Speaker A: If you Google Matt Rozak, you'll see he gave Clinton, Bill Clinton his first bitcoin, Richard Branson, their first bitcoins, back in 2013 or 2014. And then he also partnered with Peter Vesnus, who, if you guys remember, the Dow hack from 2016, peter Vesnus was kind of the first one to identify that. He was very early Bitcoin miner then. He was, I think, the first one to identify that. There was this huge security vulnerability in the Dow. He founded Coin Lab, which was the first venture backed Bitcoin company in 2012. They're both just kind of like Bitcoin and crypto OGS.
00:38:42.734 - 00:38:47.986, Speaker A: And so yeah, from one billionaire's hands to another, barry to Peter, and Peter.
00:38:48.018 - 00:38:51.942, Speaker B: And Matt blocked with a Q. Yeah, I know that company.
00:38:52.076 - 00:38:53.638, Speaker C: It was Atlanta based or something.
00:38:53.724 - 00:38:55.474, Speaker A: They're kind of an incubator of sorts.
00:38:55.522 - 00:38:58.600, Speaker C: For different yeah, never got much traction, I think, but.
00:39:00.570 - 00:39:01.880, Speaker A: Looks like about 100.
00:39:04.510 - 00:39:09.420, Speaker B: Now. It's time to turn the pod over. Questioning over to you. What do you think?
00:39:10.750 - 00:39:36.630, Speaker A: I think it's great. I'm very happy that this deal got done. I think that competition in media is a good thing and that crypto as an industry has not had great journalism in the past. And that's one of the reasons that we launched our news arm in January of 2021. And I think that having competition in journalism and in media is a really good thing. And so I'm happy that this deal went through and I'm happy that CoinDesk didn't get killed.
00:39:39.610 - 00:40:02.058, Speaker C: Nice. We've talked about this before, but at some point, obviously look, it's no surprise both Framework and myself invested in the latest round along with ten t, because we're super excited about I mean, we sit here every week and so it just made sense. So now we got to interview both you and Mike to just talk about the story of Blockworks and stuff.
00:40:02.144 - 00:40:03.340, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:40:03.810 - 00:40:05.534, Speaker A: Flip the mics. Maybe we'll do that soon.
00:40:05.652 - 00:40:15.746, Speaker C: Speaking of another breaking news transitioning a bit, there was a big shakeup at Sequoia. I think they fired everyone. That the entire crypto team. We had michelle, I think at some.
00:40:15.768 - 00:40:18.274, Speaker A: Point we interviewed Michelle out. Michelle's gone?
00:40:18.312 - 00:40:18.466, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:18.488 - 00:40:35.350, Speaker C: Michelle's out. Yes, Michelle. And then I think your more senior guy there, who is no surprising you left mike Moritz is out. Yeah, well, he's technically out of the venture team, but he's transitioning to their heritage, which is like their family office.
00:40:35.420 - 00:40:36.360, Speaker B: Family office?
00:40:36.890 - 00:40:43.660, Speaker C: He's not fired? No, but the other relevant for this discussion the crypto team is just out.
00:40:46.830 - 00:40:48.730, Speaker A: Yeah. Holy shit, I missed.
00:40:49.950 - 00:40:53.440, Speaker C: I mean they let FTX and so I think that was a big egg in the phase for them.
00:40:54.370 - 00:41:03.598, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say the bigger thing too is just the sentiment shift. It seems they are actively not going to be investing in crypto going forward it seems.
00:41:03.764 - 00:41:35.834, Speaker C: Yeah, that's generally true. I mean Sequoia has been funny enough at the time I was working at a venture fund called Sageview and I went to Sequoia and I got pretty far because I want to join their team and their hiring process is really funky. They're just, like, come in and pitch us some ideas. And literally, my memo was just buy crypto. It was bitcoin. At some point, I'll probably publish it. And this was like, the last round, or it's one of the last rounds before meeting, I guess, doug and a few of the other more senior guys.
00:41:35.834 - 00:42:37.294, Speaker C: And this was the SaaS team. And they're like I was like, Guys, you invest in dropbox, you should invest in store. J. This was like before Filecoin, this is like store J like block era like made safe and stuff, just buy bitcoin and stuff and they're like you know what man? No we're not really interested in this. And then it was funny enough because I saw them years later they were one of the early backers of paradigm, right? I mean Matt came from Sequoia right? And they contributed I think in kind a bunch of bitcoin at the low to paradigm and then they did a few investments but yeah, I would say that the Sequoia shift is also happening in other major funds. I mean of course like Tiger you have triple point. I mean just a bunch of traditional funds that came in late maybe didn't dedicate enough resources have moved away from crypto in a very drastic way.
00:42:37.412 - 00:42:37.694, Speaker B: Right?
00:42:37.732 - 00:42:41.790, Speaker C: I mean I think it's really just the crypto native firms that remain.
00:42:43.810 - 00:43:41.470, Speaker B: Both Vance and I a couple of months ago went to one of our large LPs annual meeting and they run a multi strategy approach to all of their LP relationships. And you've got private equity, growth equity. You've got traditional venture and then also crypto. And they have a dedicated blockchain venture fund as well. And it was walking out of that conference, I mean, there was an entire day dedicated to blockchain GPS of which we both presented on different panels. But it is very clear that there is such a stark difference between traditional venture and blockchain venture. And even they were saying it, it's just you could ask one of the traditional Venture guys, hey, what do you think about blockchain technology? Where are we in the cycle? And it's just fumbling over themselves to try and put some cogent argument together and meanwhile you've got an entire day dedicated to blockchain.
00:43:41.470 - 00:44:20.830, Speaker B: I think what we're going to see is a really huge separation, even further than what we've had so far. Where you look at it almost from the traditional guy's perspective, it's like, okay, we don't see any value in this. We don't understand it. Now we have an excuse. Like, before the last two years, you didn't have an excuse from your LPs as to why you weren't doing it. Now you have every excuse as to why you can't do it. And I think that know, as we continue down this path and we're starting to see the green sheets of what this next leg up and next kind of narrative will be, with everything we're talking about with DeFi and all the narratives that everybody's excited about.
00:44:20.830 - 00:44:39.286, Speaker B: But I think that they're just going to be even further left in the back. I think that's also kind of what happened with Sequoia over the last two years. They tried to play catch up real fast, and that happened at very tippy tops of the market cycle, and they got burned. So now they're out.
00:44:39.468 - 00:44:46.198, Speaker C: Yeah, surprisingly, to give credit, a 16 C is still here.
00:44:46.364 - 00:44:47.334, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely.
00:44:47.532 - 00:45:14.930, Speaker C: They've opening a London office. They've hired another person from the CFDC, I think, or a regulator. So kudos to them because, look, there's always going to be a media story that says, oh, look, they're marking down their portfolio drastically, and people don't really appreciate one, how you mark up these positions, which is incredibly difficult in Venture now, even to the Nth degree, because Venture plus cryptos is the weird animal.
00:45:15.830 - 00:45:16.754, Speaker B: But they're still here.
00:45:16.792 - 00:46:14.766, Speaker C: Right. And I think I really respect that because sometimes when you have a behemoth of an empire and crypto is one very small piece of it, that can have a lot of reputational damage. Like, Sequoia probably did the math and was like, we run so many other funds, super big funds, and why would we even consider pissing off some of our LPs and jeopardizing our position as a premier preeminent venture fund? Now, granted, they've done a lot of restructuring. They left China and then they left India, and then they've left Brazil. So they've done a lot of restructuring over the years, I think, which I think, and I don't want to read too much into this, but Michael, this is a point that you perhaps were saying. If you look at the returns of Venture as an asset class and even hedge funds, but just Venture itself, like tier one, it's going through a pretty bad moment. I mean, just historically, returns have compressed pretty dramatically for a number of reasons.
00:46:14.766 - 00:46:35.098, Speaker C: Just it's more competitive. There's way more capital flowing into the space. A lot of these guys pushed up valuations to the extreme, paying like 20 times, 30 times forward arr and just that combined with companies not IPOing in ten plus years, it makes it really difficult.
00:46:35.184 - 00:46:35.434, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:35.472 - 00:47:26.700, Speaker C: And so I think, Michael, I'd be curious, you guys raised the fund, obviously, what was, I think, really good timing and I think you have a lot of cash to deploy. But when you think about competition in crypto, polychain just raised another 200 million dollar venture fund. So there's folks out there like Katie Hahn Ventures, I'm sure she hasn't called all the capital, but there's decent amount of dry powder, but it feels like it's just back to crypto native funds. And so from a competition and return perspective, if the traditional venture guys are not showing up, how are you thinking about just competition and investing in crypto? When you go in and look at these rounds, early stage, how competitive is it now versus what it was like a year, two, three years, where it just felt like things were just being bid up.
00:47:28.750 - 00:48:35.854, Speaker B: Yeah, well, first thing I'll say is I think if you look at the long arc of venture performance has even at the top quartile, top decile performance has definitely come down, but also, I think, is highly correlated with fund size going up. And fund size really does dictate your business strategy. And when you have a billion dollars or multibillion dollar funds, you have to return multiples of that, which means that your 510, 15, 20% ownership needs to be at levels that are tens of billions of dollars to be able to get a fund returning investment. We definitely, I think, timed our last fundraise pretty well. I think it was about three weeks before Luna blew up is when we announced it and it is a 400 million dollar vehicle. We feel like we can be a very strong player at the seed in Series A and a lot of those in the fund size will help return many multiples of the fund. And that's kind of the strategy that you have to be playing for if you're in the venture business and you want to be in the venture business long term.
00:48:35.854 - 00:49:27.940, Speaker B: If you're in the asset management business, like maybe the Tigers of the world where they're looking for an IRR return, it's just a different ballgame. And so seeing a lot of those players come out decreases the amount of valuation drift as well as the level of competition in a lot of really positive ways. I think in some ways you can get the intermediate marks of you did the seed round with the Series A and then Tiger comes in and throws a $50 million check at your portfolio company and you're like, oh wow, I'm a genius. But in reality, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to return anything, it just means that somebody else has bought it for a higher value. And so I think that you have to be sober in the ways that you think about what is real value and tangible value, which ultimately is returning multiples of the fund in regards to what's competition like these days.
00:49:30.070 - 00:49:30.594, Speaker C: Well, two.
00:49:30.632 - 00:50:03.260, Speaker B: Things are going on. One, there's absolutely less competition. It's crypto natives basically only there are a couple of upstart funds that are doing on their first or second fund that are competing at the seed series A ish level. I think frankly it's going to be really hard for any fund that doesn't have distributions in the next fundraising cycle to be able to go and continue on polychain. Look at them, 200 million dollar fund. I think their last fund was 700. So this is definitely a step down from that.
00:50:03.260 - 00:50:54.154, Speaker B: I think they were also raising this at probably one of the most difficult times in the last decade to raise a venture fund. And this is probably a first close and not a final close. But yeah, the landscape is changing quickly. And I think the other thing that's going on, the second variable that's going on is there's just not as many people coming into the industry as you saw in 2021. So there's just not as many opportunities but the quality of the opportunities that you are seeing is much higher. So that's probably more form fit for the industry that we have now of investors where it's crypto natives who understand this stuff, who can really dig in and help out from a crypto native perspective and you're just not having to go chase things because the deal flow is five x what you're seeing now. So I think it's really positive for the industry.
00:50:54.282 - 00:51:45.134, Speaker C: Yeah. Now of course some of the non crypto native funds historically have just stuck to deals like an FTX where they end up raising 5100 million. That's something they can easily do. Right. They love these equity deals. What they haven't done historically even at the peak of last cycle, which is doing on chain stuff and really kind of yield farming and doing other strategies and just staking and just holding ETH and staking it which to me is where the real alpha can be generated. And so even not some of the crypto native funds that are just purely kind of venture don't do this stuff, which is, I don't know, pretty.
00:51:45.134 - 00:52:15.618, Speaker C: But what I'm trying to say is very few funds are active as you guys are on chain and you can do a number of things. And how easy is it for a fund like you to convince your LPs that you're able to do all these things right? Because they all want to either think you're either I remember a paraphrase, people always want to know are you a hedge fund or are you a venture fund and what is this bucket? I just need to know which bucket I'm allocating from. How do you kind of have that conversation with LPs?
00:52:15.794 - 00:52:16.086, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:16.108 - 00:53:19.942, Speaker B: The distinction that we think about is, are you an open ended fund or are you a closed ended fund? And what that really means is, do you have the ability to withdraw and manage everything in a liquid basis, as you would with an open ended fund? Or are you the kind of typical venture, closed ended, ten year vehicle? We manage closed ended funds so we consider ourselves to be venture thesis in the ways that we invest, where we're maniacally focused on ownership. We want to be the lead partner for whatever deal we're in. It's something where we want to have a long term relationship with anyone that we back. And that mentality and that investment philosophy, I think, is the same philosophy as what you would see from a traditional venture partner or traditional venture fund, where we're different to your point is? You get access to according to the Ripple case. This new form of asset class called the digital asset. Earlier than you would with any other venture investment where it's private equity. And being able to participate with that, use that asset, participate in governance.
00:53:19.942 - 00:53:58.230, Speaker B: Stake it. Help out the ecosystem. Maybe run validator nodes, whatever is necessary. I think that's not necessarily that hard of a sell from an LP perspective because that's what these protocols need and it's part of the package that you get when you get an investment from Framework is we're going to be participatory in any way we possibly can. I think that's becoming very common or commonly understood from the LP world is like if you're not doing that, you're not really crypto native. And you may be buying equity, but you also really think that the token is going to be worthwhile. Well, that's really kind of where the value will accrue.
00:53:58.230 - 00:54:04.730, Speaker B: So I think that's probably the distinction that I would make between traditional and crypto native.
00:54:05.950 - 00:54:25.390, Speaker A: Michael, what are the main questions that if you think about all of your port codes, maybe founders of your port codes, what are the main questions that they're coming to you with and what do they need advice on? Is it kind of tactical like sales, marketing, or is it more esoteric like hiring and people management? Or is it very crypto native like launching tokens, token economics?
00:54:25.810 - 00:55:16.818, Speaker B: It's literally all of the above. I think it really just depends on when you make an investment into a seed stage company and they've got seven people working there and they're like, how do we hire someone who can help us with X, Y or Z? Or how do we find our head of research? It's like, okay, well, here's our recruiting partners and let's dig in. Or it might be like we're about to launch. How do we get in front of Blockworks or CoinDesk or, you know, how do we get our messaging out? Or how do we craft our messaging? Like, okay, talk to Adam on our team. He's our comms partner and he's going to help you do that. And I think once you launch the things become more technical in nature to what we're talking about, where you're staking, you're providing governance assistance, you're running nodes. So earlier stages look and feel a lot like a typical startup where you're just helping with the blocking and tackling of whatever you need to do.
00:55:16.818 - 00:56:20.680, Speaker B: I'd say. The other thing too is there's just a ton of co founder discussions where the other aspect here is if you're successful in a traditional startup, you're going to try and absorb the world in terms of power and influence and resources, whereas if you're a founder of a protocol, you're turning over the keys to the kingdom in a few years. And that is a very fundamental shift from a founder philosophy perspective, where you're still going to be pushing things, but it's going to be governed by people who you may not even know, and you're still going to be like, you still have the North Star. Or maybe somebody else takes up the reins and has the North Star in lieu of you. And that's kind of the goal. That transition, that different mentality I think is another just huge difference, I think, about like Mark Zuckerberg versus like a Hayden or a like they are fundamentally different in their philosophy on it just it has to be for you to run a protocol versus a company.
00:56:21.210 - 00:57:13.126, Speaker C: I'll tell you two things that most recently have been top of mind. Like if I systematically look at, I get pinged by all my portfolio companies. It's like the two most frequent things that I'm getting pinged on is one, what does macro in the fundraising environment look like for a follow in? Because I am running out of capital within three to nine months or twelve months. And what's your appetite to put more money and who else is out there giving like, leading rounds? It's a very tough fundraising environment. Which brings us like people should go and listen to the discussions we recorded with Avico and Haseeb, which the question is, would you rather invest in something new or do follow on? Some funds just don't do follow. So I sometimes do do follow ons because if you can get out of the same valuation, reasonable valuation is much more derisk, why wouldn't you?
00:57:13.148 - 00:57:13.720, Speaker A: Right?
00:57:14.330 - 00:58:13.260, Speaker C: So that's probably the most important one. I think people are fairly nervous of what the fundraising environment is going to look like over the next year or two and your ability to survive. And the second one is, help me get in front of these L two S that have big grant programs. A lot of times they want to understand where should we deploy? Which gets us back to the chain link thing, is how important it is because it may not be today, it's super important. Oh, should I deploy an optimism or Arbitrum or Solana or Avalanche, what have you, or Polygon? And I think over time that will be less of a relevant I mean, it's still going to be an important decision, like where should you plant your flag first? But I think that will become less and less important over the next couple of years. As it just doesn't really matter where you deploy. Maybe it's just where whoever gives you the most amount of incentives, right?
00:58:13.790 - 00:58:40.606, Speaker A: Or where the user I think that's a great point. Santi one thing that's very clear right now, too, is whatever l one you choose to build on, you're kind of like that type of project, you're kind of that type of team and that type of app. If you are building on Solana, that tells me a lot about your character and who you are. If you build on Polygon, you are a very different type of person than someone who goes and builds on Solana. I wonder if that mean people talk about culture.
00:58:40.638 - 00:58:59.206, Speaker C: A like, in my mind, culture is something that's way overused and not properly understood. It's like going back to like I think it was Mike Moritz's book. No, it's Ben Horitz. It's like, culture is what you do, not what you say. And like, yeah, okay, if you deploy. Like, I don't read too much into that. Candidly I actually respect the Solana community a lot.
00:58:59.206 - 00:59:56.810, Speaker C: It's going through something that the ETH community went and not that we need to talk about it in this episode, but I just talked to Ben, this mean as a result of Neon launching, and this is Neon's like an EVM kind of thing. So basically allows you to run an EVM and connect with Salana very easily. So, again, more connectivity among chains is a key narrative and theme. But yeah, Salana community, I've seen some projects leave Salana and then have more success because they deployed in an L two and Ethereum and an EVM chain. But I don't think if you were to think about how the pendulum has swung salana was all the rage when they had their conference in Lisbon and two years in a row. And of course, the FTX kind know, Gravitas certainly helped. Um, and now it's like it just swung in the totally opposite direction because this is a dead protocol and it's not going anywhere.
00:59:56.810 - 01:00:34.630, Speaker C: But look, the Saga phone is really interesting. I think the DeFi ecosystem there shows signs of resurgence. And so the problem with crypto is people once you're scarred by something or say you held sold from whatever it was at all time high, now it's like down to nine and sold it. You don't want to ever look at it. You get annoyed if you look at the chart. And I think sometimes people just really shut themselves out to stop learning about what's happening there. And I've done it.
01:00:34.630 - 01:01:37.530, Speaker C: I've fallen in this trap before because it sucks to constantly it's like salting your wounds. But yeah, all this to say, I think we should have another episode talking about the Solana ecosystem and how these two worlds can converge, because I know a lot of people just have a very strong view on not. Touching solana and culturally and all this stuff, but I'm more pragmatic and I think there's very interesting innovation there and the team hasn't given up. And I think that kind of stuff, I look to that as the most important thing. I mean, they've actually taken a lot. And Anatoly, we've had him on the pod and he said, listen, I actually welcome a lot of the criticism from the Ethereum community because that has allowed us to innovate, for instance, on the gas fee model and making it know. I think it would be very different if you had someone like like not even entertain criticism and just turn a blind eye or even sue people that are like, anonymous on Twitter, which other protocols are doing, but Solana is open.
01:01:37.530 - 01:01:53.134, Speaker C: I think that sort of ethos is also very much the Ethereum camp, which is, it's so early, we're going to have to innovate over time. And if at some point we become rigid in our thinking, then someone else is going to out innovate us and out execute us. And so I respect that one question.
01:01:53.172 - 01:02:26.410, Speaker B: Satya on that point. Something that we talk about internally is for both of you guys, is just like, what do you think the overarching characteristic is that forces one decision to a chain versus another? Is it the technical? Is it the cultural, is it the financial? Personally, I think it depends on who the developer is and what they're looking for. But it is interesting that all three of those can become the dominant factor, depending.
01:02:26.750 - 01:02:54.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say it depends on the type of protocol, like gaming versus just DeFi. Historically, it's probably like, well, in the days of FTX and whatnot, a lot of DeFi protocols were deploying on Solana because it was like, what is the language that they use? Rust.
01:02:54.974 - 01:02:55.700, Speaker B: Right.
01:02:57.050 - 01:03:28.766, Speaker C: You saw new developers that were not like solidity coders, just join the industry because they're really excited. You heard the narrative and the salon is back at FTX chain street. All that stuff kind of like, mattered. Today is different, I think. Candidly most people just deploy on Ethereum because that's where most of the activity is. Most of the users are there's just a lot of excitement in L two S base, which we haven't really seen the full extent of that, but was it this week? They just came out with, like I.
01:03:28.788 - 01:03:37.258, Speaker B: Was about to say that's the other announcement out of ECC, or same timing at least, is Base, I think is available for DevNet.
01:03:37.434 - 01:03:37.966, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:38.068 - 01:03:57.094, Speaker C: So I think when you see that, when you have base, when you have Arbitrage, when we have optimism and all, there's just so much innovation happening there that candidly, nine out of ten just look at that in developers and say, we want to be here because this is where it's buzzing. Right. There's just so much innovation today.
01:03:57.292 - 01:03:58.950, Speaker B: Right. The cultural side.
01:03:59.100 - 01:04:05.260, Speaker C: Yeah. And the users too. I mean, that's where most of the activity is, right? It's just a combination of things.
01:04:06.110 - 01:04:41.986, Speaker A: There have been two things that in conversations with developers, two main things that I feel like people want. One is longevity. So you want to be able to build something. If you build on a protocol, you want that protocol to be around in 510 years from now. So that's one thing. One of the big questions, I think, when people are debating building on Arbitrum versus Salana, is Arbitrum going to be here in five years? Is Salana going to be here in five years? Are these ecosystems that are supported and have longevity and have lindy? And then the next thing is customizability, right? I think that was the first pre. Some of these l two s that was one of the frustrating things with maybe building on ETH.
01:04:41.986 - 01:05:30.390, Speaker A: L1 is like if you were a developer, it feels like some of these key decisions about how you should build your protocol or your exchange or your wallet, it feels like some of them had already been made for you. Whereas if you built in something like Solana, there was more of like an open playground to play in. I think that'll probably change as you get more customizability with some of the Op stack and things like that. But I think that was something else. And then I think the third bucket is simplicity, right? Like if you build on, again, pre Op stack and Arbitrum and things like that, it was very complex to build on ETH, right, it was very complex. Whereas building on something like Solana was I mean, even though Rust is very difficult programming language, it was just easier to get started and to hit the ground running. I think that changes the base and Op stack.
01:05:30.730 - 01:06:01.310, Speaker C: I mean michael, turn around. Two questions, maybe one. Have you ever looked at an investment and learned that the founder is very much gun ho in deploying in a protocol that you didn't have as much of an interest, not just Solana, it could be avalanche, whatever. Did that tick you off to not make the investment because you read too much in the quality and the caliber of the founder and two of your entire portfolio. What percentage is ethereum centric?
01:06:03.410 - 01:07:11.590, Speaker B: Well, the first question, 100%. Not to say that that is the only factor, but I think to your point, it does give you some understanding of the psychology of the founding team. And so if it's already sort of a question of are they crypto native, are they really understanding the trade offs here and then you go and choose out there not very widely used protocol or blockchain, then absolutely. It just furthers the point. But I wouldn't say that we've had anything where I'd say the one thing that we also do is have seen is a number of like we're building this on that blockchain, which frankly, I think that just never really works and historically hasn't been a real valuable asset. The second question. Yeah, I think probably if I'm really thinking about it, probably like two thirds Ethereum, one third maybe like 75% Ethereum, 25% salana.
01:07:11.590 - 01:08:08.242, Speaker B: And yeah, I'd say historically that's been like almost 100% Ethereum and it's definitely changing over time. I would say there's also in respect to games, those don't necessarily have as much of a blockchain interaction as you would necessarily need because ideally the usage is just have. That's where I think an example of the technology is the overriding factor and not necessarily the cultural side because games have this intention of being net new users, or at least I think the really good games have an intention of like we're not going after the Web three natives as our core customer base. We're going to hopefully attract some of them. But blockchain is really what enables our ownership economy in this game ecosystem. It's not something where we need the liquidity, the assets, everything that you would see with a DeFi protocol, for instance. So games are a little bit different and definitely have seen more games on Solana.
01:08:08.242 - 01:08:12.410, Speaker B: So that's where that one third, one quarter comes from.
01:08:12.560 - 01:09:00.774, Speaker C: Yeah, that's such a good point because some of my investments like super early stages are agnostic. We just don't know. We'll make that decision down the road when we are ready to pick a partner. But for now we're just going to go deep and build the gameplay and the lore and all this stuff. But yeah, some of them are even considering launching their own L One, which is going to be we've talked about this narrative emerging over time, but you're going to see more and more of that. I think just protocols, particularly games wanting to own the entire stack, especially if you have the connectivity fiber with the CCIP or layer zero, just bring it back to that. Then the fact that we're discussing this, we're probably going to look at this and laugh.
01:09:00.774 - 01:10:08.830, Speaker C: It's like, how relevant was this discussion? Certainly from security it does make sense, which is why I've decided for something like DeFi, I think it matters a lot. And you read into why Visa, for instance, chose Ethereum. We go back to this, I'm not going to read so much into that, but I think security begets liquidity which improves security. And that virtuous cycle is what has made Ethereum DeFi just the most battle tested. And when you need the lindy of Ethereum to just feel comfortable transacting in a DeFi environment right, if you're a game, then I understand you're a consumer application where you can loosen some of these constraints. But with DeFi, I think for me it's hard to make investments solana yeah, but even then I think just Ethereum is just so far in a way just proven and battle tested that it just makes the case for the interaction that you have, the composability that you get. I mean, all those things just do matter a lot.
01:10:08.830 - 01:10:09.520, Speaker C: Right.
01:10:09.970 - 01:11:16.120, Speaker B: One additional fact actually, now that I think about it, there's definitely applications that we've invested in that haven't launched yet. I would say that the way that that percentage will change is that avalanche will be kind of the third. And in a lot of ways, the way that those applications in particular will interact is that they're by default going to be multi chain just for different aspects of the application where like a matching engine or something that's more computationally intensive is going to live on the avalanche platform, but the actual assets themselves will live on Ethereum. And frankly, a lot of those are also reliant upon the eventual launch of CCIP and have been for the last two years. So that's another case in point for why CCIP becomes powerful is because you don't necessarily have to just be wedded. A single application doesn't have to be wedded to a single blockchain. If the vision of layer zero or CCIP is realized, where you can have the user experience on one chain and you can leverage other abilities, technical abilities or cultural abilities of a blockchain to do other aspects of it.
01:11:17.690 - 01:11:23.238, Speaker C: Yeah. What else is on the block yano to talk about? I mean, there's just a couple of.
01:11:23.244 - 01:11:34.698, Speaker A: Announcements there but the last thing I found interesting, I mean, very related to this conversation was cello. So Sello is an L One and they announced that they were proposal to.
01:11:34.704 - 01:11:36.458, Speaker C: Convert into an Ethereum L2.
01:11:36.624 - 01:12:08.726, Speaker A: Yeah. Proposal to convert into an ethereum l two. Which is I think, a pretty interesting strategy that I think you'll probably see more of. Right. I think whether there's a bunch of different reasons to do it. But I think at the end of the day you talk to some of these L1s and they come to realize that securing a network of nodes is really freaking hard and capital intensive and time consuming and just not worth the mental bandwidth to focus on. So instead they're turning to Ethereum, right, which is like Santi mentioned, the most lindy and the most robust option.
01:12:08.726 - 01:12:19.690, Speaker A: And it offers ethereum is basically becoming like security as a service for them to post call data and to settle value to. And I think it makes a lot of sense for Sello.
01:12:20.830 - 01:13:13.206, Speaker C: Look, I still remember having a lot of these discussions and when you saw the L One kind of crop up like popcorn and it was just one of those things where it felt like the incentives were there. And I understand to go and launch your L One, competing L One, it just is there. We talk about incentives a lot in crypto, but if you're a developer there's a lot of big incentives to just launch your L One. Just the nature of the game. And Ethereum for a while it really sucked to see that because you're like all this brain power and it's distracting, but you sort of take it look, it's open competition it's open source. You got to let it run its course. And eventually, I think you're coming back to this realization where projects realize, yeah, it's really tough.
01:13:13.206 - 01:13:39.794, Speaker C: Like, there's crickets and all these L1s. And so any chance of getting remote activity is to come back to Ethereum. So it's just sort of for a while, it just felt like everyone and their mother was launching an L One because it was just more financially lucrative to do that than work at the Ethereum Foundation. It is what it is.
01:13:39.832 - 01:13:40.178, Speaker A: Right.
01:13:40.264 - 01:13:47.300, Speaker C: I'm just going to call it as I see it. It just made sense not to pick on any particular competing L One, but yeah.
01:13:47.990 - 01:13:52.918, Speaker B: Do you think that that'll continue with an equivalent popcorn of L2 S?
01:13:53.004 - 01:14:23.150, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Big time. Literally every week I get pitched another L2, which is not a bad thing. I mean, look, I'm a big believer in free markets and open competition, and I think it sucks from the perspective of entrepreneur because a lot of times it's just fork and do your stuff. But look, the Op stack, I think they're pretty open from a philosophical standpoint. I mean, it's like, okay, I respect that, and I think you just sort of welcome ruthless competition.
01:14:23.150 - 01:14:34.980, Speaker C: Now, maybe question to you, Michael does that bother you that there's a world where there's hundreds of L2 S? Does it even matter if you have good connectivity between them?
01:14:35.430 - 01:15:34.146, Speaker B: Well, I think what you're assuming is that you're competing on the same plane with every other L2, which would be an execution environment, whereas I think that there's an element of if you have a differentiated product or service, an L2 strategy is really just becoming your new business strategy. I think if we're talking about execution environments, it's going to be really hard to displace the existing incumbents unless you have an existing user base or differentiated edge. What I do think is the case is you've got a truly differentiated product or service. And instead of building this as a smart contract platform on top of an execution environment, it may make sense to have your own L2. Maybe not your own L One, and that middle of the stack is probably a better fit. I'd say L2 as a business strategy for things that are differentiated is probably where we would gravitate towards. But if it's just going to be the same plane of competition, it's going to be tough.
01:15:34.338 - 01:16:24.390, Speaker C: But let me ask you a question, because I'm not as technically well versed to think about this, but I'll ask the question, and then I'll think about it. But what are the design choices that allow, like, if you're launching your L2, say that you're a game, right? Or whatever dy DX before it went to Cosmos. If you want to launch your L2, what's a trade off from a founder's perspective of saying, I'm going to deploy an Arbitrum versus no, I want to launch my own fork of optimism. What's the benefit of launching your own L2 versus deploying on Arbitrum or optimism or base? Well, you have to recruit a validator set.
01:16:24.460 - 01:16:25.078, Speaker A: Right?
01:16:25.244 - 01:16:43.630, Speaker C: Think about decentralizing the sequencer. But there's Espresso and a bunch of other folks that you can partner with, but it's more of a technical. Like, you then have to, from an internal team resource perspective, you have to expend energy in thinking about all of that versus just focusing on your core product and competency.
01:16:44.930 - 01:17:34.160, Speaker B: Totally. I think what you enable are a couple of things. Yes, it's much more heavy lifting. You have to be able to build the technology and the infrastructure to where you're supporting not only just an application set, but a validator set to secure and manage that entire ecosystem. What you get to control is a lot of the economy of that digital asset, which I think has a lot of really strong elements, especially when it comes to infrastructure services. So computational services, I think, is a prime example of this. If you're building sort of an application, I don't think it necessarily makes sense for you to be in your own l two now, for instance, if you're a game and you've got three or four different games and you've got a bunch of technology that's underpinning that game, that's native to the game ecosystem, maybe it does make sense.
01:17:34.160 - 01:17:55.810, Speaker B: I would say being able to control the economy, being able to control the technology, it comes with pros and cons. But I would say that's probably the biggest architectural difference. You just have to have a justifiable reason why you need to control those aspects. Otherwise, it just feels like you're launching an L2 to have a token.
01:17:56.710 - 01:17:59.460, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point.
01:18:01.430 - 01:18:03.030, Speaker A: Jen. Good chat.
01:18:03.530 - 01:18:13.340, Speaker C: Yeah, that's pretty michael, question. Any of you guys have managed or going to see Oppenheimer or Barbie and in what order?
01:18:14.430 - 01:18:35.394, Speaker B: I've got back to back same day. My girlfriend has a knack for falling asleep in movies. So we're going to go see Oppenheimer at, like, 1030 in the morning and then Barbie after that.
01:18:35.512 - 01:18:39.540, Speaker C: Is that a bear market thing? Because I heard tickets before noon are cheaper. Man.
01:18:43.110 - 01:18:46.180, Speaker B: Got to say where you can I love it, man.
01:18:46.870 - 01:18:51.538, Speaker C: I love this philosophy. Okay, so Oppenheimer in the morning and then Barb in the afternoon.
01:18:51.634 - 01:18:53.846, Speaker B: I mean, listen, I think rotten tomatoes came out.
01:18:53.868 - 01:18:57.362, Speaker A: You'll be attending solo. You'll be going to another movie alone, I'm assuming.
01:18:57.506 - 01:19:02.380, Speaker C: Dude, it's like, impossible, but sure. You think.
01:19:06.510 - 01:19:11.980, Speaker B: It'S going to be good? I think Oppenheimer got 96 on Rotten Tomatoes, and Barbie has 93%.
01:19:13.470 - 01:19:22.480, Speaker C: Hollywood is back. I got to say, there was, like, two years during COVID where you needed it the most. There was, like, no good movies. Now, mission Impossible is pretty good.
01:19:22.850 - 01:19:33.758, Speaker B: I liked it. I hate to break it to you, Santi, but it always has, like, a one to two year time lag, but we're about to hit another dead spot with this strike.
01:19:33.854 - 01:19:38.178, Speaker C: Well, hopefully by then, crypto will deliver its value.
01:19:38.264 - 01:19:43.990, Speaker A: So we'll be okay? We got all of our dopamine from the markets in 2014 and 2015. We'll be good.
01:19:44.140 - 01:19:47.286, Speaker C: Yeah, by then, the FTX movie will come out.
01:19:47.468 - 01:19:58.922, Speaker B: Oh, man. Well, that's the other thing. Did you know that Michael Lewis is set to launch his book two days before the FTX SBF trial is supposed to begin?
01:19:59.056 - 01:19:59.562, Speaker C: Oh, really?
01:19:59.616 - 01:20:01.158, Speaker A: Yeah. Genius.
01:20:01.254 - 01:20:04.990, Speaker C: Wow. Bradley Dale launched his book.
01:20:05.140 - 01:20:05.758, Speaker B: I got it.
01:20:05.764 - 01:20:08.750, Speaker C: I haven't gone to it, but yeah, that's going to be exciting.

01:20:37.618 - 01:20:42.310, Speaker C: Yeah. Guys, great discussion. Yano, is this good enough for Roundup?
