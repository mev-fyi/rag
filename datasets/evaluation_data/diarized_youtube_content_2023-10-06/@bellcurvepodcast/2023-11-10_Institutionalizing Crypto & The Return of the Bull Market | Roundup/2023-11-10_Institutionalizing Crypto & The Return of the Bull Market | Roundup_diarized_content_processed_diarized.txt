00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:24.890 - 00:00:50.102, Speaker B: It all of this is with the backdrop of institutionalization for the two core assets that are coming probably in the next like seven to eight months, if not sooner than that. How much they will actually move, how much the inflows will actually be, remains to be seen. Everybody has their guess, but I think just with that backdrop, you've got so many positive catalysts.
00:00:50.166 - 00:01:20.406, Speaker A: All right everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of Crypto. Goldman, JPMorgan, Zero, 72, all in one room. So you can know what the big money is doing. So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage and use Bell 20 for 20% off and I will see you in sunny London town in March. All right, everyone, we are back.
00:01:20.406 - 00:01:30.230, Speaker A: I don't know if that's another episode of Bell Curve. The industry as a whole such a joke. It's both got Michael's one and two here. What's up, buddy?
00:01:30.970 - 00:01:39.242, Speaker B: Doing well, doing well. Once again we've shed the dead weight. We have the streamlined podcast ready to go.
00:01:39.376 - 00:02:01.214, Speaker A: Lean and mean, baby, lean and mean. Holding up the know for the pod. Doing what we mean. It's been a good week, been a good my. I think I actually asked this to Vance the last time we recorded together, but can't ignore what's going on price wise here. I guess my question for you is, are we back? What's the vibes on the ground?
00:02:01.342 - 00:03:06.262, Speaker B: Well, first off, I think you can and probably should ignore what's happening with prices. The big news this week was frankly just like not price action. I think it's just all the positive momentum from announcements to launches. Now there's rumors of more spot ETFs in particular, BlackRock apparently filed their application with the State of Delaware to have their trust. They haven't officially filed their spot ETH ETF application yet, but it's expected that's impending. I don't know the sentiment here is there's just a lot of positive momentum also happening coincidentally on the one year anniversary of the FTX blow up. And I don't know if there's a specific day that you can point to, but this week, last year, just thinking back twelve months, how far things have changed, there is a non zero possibility that the industry was done at the end of last year.
00:03:06.262 - 00:03:20.490, Speaker B: Nobody knew where the bottom would drop, what was left to drop, who was left to drop. Feels great to put a lot of that in rear view and I think it kind of culminated in a lot of ways with the rulings against SBF.
00:03:20.910 - 00:04:20.222, Speaker A: Yeah, I tend to agree with people now. There's a little bit of hindsight bias and everything looking back and lots of people coming out and saying, yeah, we never really liked SBF, but the brand that SBF had and mean it was right up there and even going, we have to be rewinding the clock back three arrows. When that first news first started to break, everyone was like, this doesn't seem right, this just feels wrong. But then even after that suspicion, you start to look around and wonder who else is whole here? I mean, I don't think anyone believed really when the rumors started to surface about FTX, they just built such a solid brand. And I actually do want to just as opposed to sort of as an interesting hypothetical, I don't want to start with this, but there's talk right now there are a couple of bidders out there bidding for FTX. So I talked to actually Mark Yusco today, he's figure is one of their port codes and they're bidding. Bullish is bidding as well.
00:04:20.222 - 00:05:06.430, Speaker A: So just be curious to kind of game out what a restart would look like and what the brand would sort of be. But I guess I would like to hear, Michael from your perspective, maybe the two constituents that you talk to the most, both on the entrepreneurial side of things and then also on the sort of LP interest side of things. So maybe starting on the entrepreneurial side. So, Miles, one of my good buddies, who's our 6th man here on this show, I was talking to him from his seat at Reverie, and he was saying some of the deals the deal flow just in the last couple of weeks has really picked up and he's starting to see very cool stuff sort of come onto his plate where before he really had to dig around, it's sort of noticeably picked up. I'm curious what things look like in the private markets from your perspective.
00:05:06.770 - 00:06:11.202, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it's kind of the tale of two different cities in the private markets right now. You have a lot of people, a lot of companies who raise money, maybe seed capital, early stage capital in 2021 with a projected 18 month runway and second half of this year was a lot of those people having to come back to market and frankly just not really seeing success, not enough traction had been made. Industries, if you're an infrastructure provider, you're waiting for the users to come, you're waiting for the apps to develop and so the metrics aren't always going to be positive there. But on the flip side of that I think you have a lot of new ideas and new directions. And so if you're starting from ground zero, I know Naraj, formerly of Polychain, announced his fundraise yesterday. There's still sort of initial capital fundraises that are exciting getting done. And my basic understanding is that they will be met with more bullish perspective going forward.
00:06:11.202 - 00:06:55.166, Speaker B: And the timing of that could be really positive. I think the last 18 months has been pretty negative, hard to survive through that period of time, especially if you need to raise. And so deal flow has definitely picked up. It's just a lot of sort of the haves and the have nots at this point. So there's a lot that are disqualified by default, but there's still a lot that's really interesting. I'd say the other stuff too is there's things that are happening and working on chain which make investment cases even from a venture perspective. Venture perspectives are things that could go 20 to 100 x type return profiles and those are things that exist on chain.
00:06:55.166 - 00:07:44.800, Speaker B: And maybe instead of investing in the equity, you're actually working with the treasury to buy tokens or buying tokens on the secondary market. So the universe of opportunity from a venture investment perspective is vast. On your point around the FTX potential rebuild, we went through a lot of this last year as well. There were a ton of companies that were going through bankruptcy proceedings. I believe that it's closed and it's all done. But I think Mike Arrington put together a coalition to rebuy Celsius and respin that. So I think we're going to start to see some of these things come out of bankruptcy proceedings and receivership, settle all of the creditor claims and kind of put a new foot forward.
00:07:44.800 - 00:08:23.530, Speaker B: What I will find to be really interesting and FDX, to your point on brand building, definitely had the biggest brand, also had the biggest brand blow up. What do you do? Do you take the tech? Do you take any remaining members of the team? Do you take the brand and run with it? What are the residual values? Because creditors are going to get made back whole on any assets, as much as they can up to 100%. And that'll take a long time. So my big question with all of these respinnings are just like, what do you move forward with and kind of what do you keep and what do you shed? So I'm fascinated with the bankruptcy proceedings.
00:08:24.270 - 00:08:45.478, Speaker A: I am as well. Okay. The other thing that I would have to imagine is that some of these bankruptcy proceedings are actually getting made easier by the run up in prices, right? A lot of the collateral that folks had on the Celsius of the world or the FTX or whatever, the assets were crypto assets for the most part. So liquidity going up, token price going up. That's got to be good.
00:08:45.564 - 00:09:37.158, Speaker B: I would imagine it's maybe it's probably good for the bankruptcy. I guess the owners of the bankruptcy or the debtors in the bankruptcy, but probably terrible for the creditors. And most of the people that are creditors are people who deposited, to your point, crypto into these ecosystems, lost their crypto. The thing that they want back is returns in crypto form. And like I said, we kicked the tires pretty hard on some of these options. Started talking to unsecured creditor groups, started trying to piece together what these models could look like, every single one of them. And I was just listening to a podcast with a couple of DCG creditors as well, or, sorry, Genesis creditors, all they want if you deposited ten bitcoin, they just want their ten bitcoin back or as close to that as possible.
00:09:37.158 - 00:10:07.838, Speaker B: They don't want $21,000 per bitcoin in the form of cash paid out over the next four years. And that's what you're looking at if you ultimately get something back. And so the cash denomination, the USD denomination for bankruptcies, I think it actually hurts way more than it helps. Sure, it helps get that percentage dollar back, but most of these situations are on the day of bankruptcy. You take a snapshot, and that's the dollar basis that you're working back towards.
00:10:08.004 - 00:10:12.750, Speaker A: Oh, dude, I did not know that. That's terrible, man. I did not realize that.
00:10:12.900 - 00:10:17.140, Speaker B: I think it's actually pretty painful for the people who are watching this price run up.
00:10:17.510 - 00:10:24.354, Speaker A: All right, well, never mind then. I just assumed that they'd be getting paid back in kind, but that sucks. Okay, never mind.
00:10:24.392 - 00:10:30.230, Speaker B: If you put bitcoins in and the bitcoins aren't there, it makes it even harder to buy those bitcoins back and give them back.
00:10:30.380 - 00:11:13.154, Speaker A: Yeah, all right, good point. All right, let's talk about what an FTX restart actually could look like, even just from a strategic sort of standpoint. Because when I think about the FTX, the asset that exists today, you could kind of subdivide that into there's the brand, right? And honestly, I think that's kind of an interesting question, whether or not that's been wholly destroyed. Then there's the existing customer base. So I would actually probably imagine that there is some percentage where if you restarted that bad boy and you are sort of made whole, maybe a little incentive. Some customers will obviously take whatever funds they have and immediately move, but some will probably stay. And then the other one is the tech stack, and that's one that I just have no proprietary information on.
00:11:13.154 - 00:11:58.706, Speaker A: I know, FTX, the whole last bull market, we were like, oh, they're such a good risk engine, and yada yada. But it was just Alameda on the back end, just eating losses and performing liquidations themselves. So maybe that's not the case. But the rest of those, the other two components actually could be sort of compelling for someone that was thinking about starting an exchange or that's part of their strategic you know, the first question that I have for you would be around the brand. Because even when I think about something, like even for everything that FTX has done, I still as a crypto native, feel differently about FTX than I do about Celsius, even though ostensibly they kind of did the same thing. Those two things are different in my mind because FTX at one point just had such a stellar brand. I think they really did.
00:11:58.706 - 00:12:21.980, Speaker A: I think they had like a really blue chip, very premium brand. And I'm sort of wondering now to myself, I didn't have any money on FTX. I actually never used it. But I do wonder to myself, like, if I was a user, would I go back if I lost some money? But then I kind of got made whole again and I was really sure that there was new management, would I stay there? I don't know. What do you think?
00:12:23.790 - 00:13:19.706, Speaker B: It's such a good question. I think one of the hardest things to do in crypto is to break out in terms of just notoriety or awareness. And to your point, FTX is going to have the highest level of notoriety and awareness. The question though is, is that positive or is that negative? And in a lot of ways, I think people talk about brand building as just having the best positive reaction with their customers and maintaining that customer relationship through positive interaction after positive interaction. I think there's an element of it that just because you are notable, you're at least going to have an in to be able to get in front of potential customers. And how many of the I don't know how many, let's say 100,000 people or sorry, 10 million people used FTX. How many of those people would come back? No idea.
00:13:19.706 - 00:14:14.138, Speaker B: So hard to tell. I think a lot of that, frankly, depends on how well the process goes through bankruptcy, asset proceedings. If you get 85, $0.90 on the dollar back and maybe it's denominated in USD, but you get some crypto and some asset, I can imagine you go back and you say, maybe this is worth a shot again, because you've got where else can I do some of the things that you were allowed to do on FTX? It's not really possible for you to get a new binance account because they've shut down, opening up new accounts for people. And KYC restrictions are at the highest. And maybe there's some fire where there's that smoke right now and maybe that brand is declining in a certain way. Maybe you want to be able to trade perps on assets that you don't have access to in the like there could be a reason why people come back.
00:14:14.138 - 00:14:24.240, Speaker B: I'm just so hard pressed to actually think that would be a sustainable business over time. You could probably start with the Fth brand to break through, but I think you'd have to change it pretty soon.
00:14:28.850 - 00:15:02.586, Speaker A: With I agree with you in my rational thought process. But I weirdly still when I just listen to my emotional side. I sort of still think of FTX as a cool. I know this sounds so weird. It's like not a bad me. Let me give you an So, Jason, and know we do a lot of work with advertisers. And one of the things that we'll do is sit down with a founder and be like, what is a success story of a really great brand in crypto that you love? That you just think like, man, if I could just do what this company did, this brand, that would be an amazing success story.
00:15:02.586 - 00:15:29.666, Speaker A: And standpoint. And we sat down with one today. It's very new, up and coming, very cool, people would know their name. And I asked that question, I was like, what's a great brand success story. And actually the first one they said was Eigen Layer, but then the other one was like they thought about they were like honestly before they blew up FTX really crushed it. And what they did super well was that they were a big company, but they did a really good job of the memes. They didn't take themselves too seriously.
00:15:29.666 - 00:15:45.930, Speaker A: They had a good brand. And even after all this shit, celsius wouldn't use it in a million years. If someone like John J. Ray, that was like a beast TradFi guy that was kind of like took over FTX, I don't know, I'd be more inclined be more inclined.
00:15:47.950 - 00:16:16.200, Speaker B: Know. Okay, so going back to it, the three assets, you got the tech stack question. Does the tech stack still include the back door or not? TBD better not. Okay, so this is my point. You've got the brand and then you got the customer list. The brand obviously was huge. It turns out if you spend hundreds of millions of dollars in anything, you could build a pretty decent sized brand if money is no object.
00:16:16.200 - 00:17:18.118, Speaker B: But I think the customer trust is just eroded because so much of this is based around if you think about what makes a successful crypto exchange, it is liquidity and it's security. And that's basically it functionality. I think you can kind of differentiate on functionality, but the bedrock of what makes a successful crypto exchange is liquidity and security. They've completely eroded their trust and security. And so there would have to be something and liquidity is something that begets liquidity. You're going to have to get market bakers backed on the investment dollars just to be able to get that liquidity back is potentially insurmountable. So I'm just of the mindset that someone may start a crypto exchange with a customer list of FTX, but I don't think it's going to have the tech stack, or at least the majority of it, and I don't think it's going to have the brand FTX just because it's so tarnished at this point.
00:17:18.284 - 00:17:39.040, Speaker A: Yeah, you're probably right. The counterpoint to what I was just saying is that if you consider these exchanges bank like, I mean no bank has ever paused withdrawals and then ever survived. Once you break that trust, it's a red line and yeah, no one ever recovers from that. So probably right. But people are still bidding on it. So it'll be interesting to see what people end up doing.
00:17:40.130 - 00:18:30.590, Speaker B: There's definitely some residual value in some of those assets and I'm sure people are taking a pretty hard look at it. There's also a lot of interesting assets on their balance sheet in the receivership of the bankruptcy too. So what they kind of package together and how they kind of want to parcel this out. It'll be really interesting to see how it comes out. But to your point, bullish, the exchange that seems to have never was, that is a case in point example of how hard it is to break through without any sort of brand or notoriety or awareness or hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing spend. I don't know. Do you know anyone who's ever played around with bullish?
00:18:31.650 - 00:19:04.438, Speaker A: I'm not 100% sure. I think they have a pretty sterling investor list like Alan Howard and Mike Novogratz and all that was involved. I'm not really a trader myself, so I'm not 100%. To be honest, I kind of had this blind spot about who actually uses what exchange because I just don't trade that much. But I do think to your point about yes, everyone can build a brand if they have infinite money. But I will say there are a lot of companies in crypto that basically have had infinite monies that have not built a brand. I think you could look at a lot of the centralized exchanges that have spent definitely hundreds of millions of dollars and don't have the same brand.
00:19:04.438 - 00:19:34.900, Speaker A: So they did something right. So I guess we'll just have to see where it all shakes out. It's kind of a fun strategy question. I think I'm actually going back on what I argued before and agreeing with you that maybe there's some residual amount of customers. You'd probably have to change the name and yeah, maybe it's worth something to someone. Probably have a really steep discount. You'd have to basically rebuild big parts of the tech stack and it would probably have to be in the strategic roadmap of some company like figure who obviously has a that's part of their strategic vision for whatever they're building.
00:19:34.900 - 00:20:40.586, Speaker A: Okay, I've got another question for you here, which is obviously it's unwise to assume anything in terms of price that this is going to continue or something like that. Actually last time on the last episode we did with advance, we were kind of going through almost like a bull market checklist of things that you would be looking for. I think the thing that's starting to resonate with me or sort of give me flashbacks to 2018, 2019 is this kind of like grinding price action that bitcoin is doing right now, which just reminds me of we're recording this on Thursday the 9th. Bitcoin had this really steep run up, which is almost definitely I mean, it just looks a lot like the kind of gamma squeezes that used to happen in the 2020 sort of time period where option sellers got cut off sides and they got squeezed for it. So it's like these sort of little things are kind of reminding me of that time period. Obviously no guarantee that it's going to play out the same. What are some of the things that you sort of look for or would give you confidence to be like, oh, okay, that's another check that box.
00:20:40.586 - 00:20:46.860, Speaker A: This is something else I'd be looking for to give me confidence that we're in a different regime than we've been in for the last couple of years.
00:20:48.030 - 00:21:39.158, Speaker B: Yes. So I actually don't think that we're at the point of the gamma squeeze like shorts having to cover their shorts or option sellers having to cover their call options that they sold. I think broadly, we're starting to see a recognition of what is set to probably happen, which is institutional capital moving into Spot ETFs. Take it back to where we started. Van Eck and 21 Share, or Arc announced their Spot ETH ETFs, I think like a month ago, September 6, may 2024 is when those final deadlines are due. So in a lot of ways that you see, okay, bitcoin is the first mover. Bitcoin is going to be the biggest.
00:21:39.158 - 00:22:20.522, Speaker B: It's going to attract the most attention in dollars. Then it's like, okay, well, what's next? And I think that, okay, what's next is sort of what is playing out right now. And I think it's institutional, probably sideline capital that's been sitting around for a while, that's making moves in. And the reason why I say this is the BlackRock ETF was announced, or expected to be announced soon. They filed for the formation documents. But one of the more interesting things that's been going on is what's been going on in the grayscale chainlink trust. And I don't know if you've seen this, but the grayscale chain link trust, so you know it's a trust.
00:22:20.522 - 00:23:05.206, Speaker B: So there's a market value for the actual trust itself. There's an underlying value for how much link is actually in that trust. This thing has completely dislodged. The trust is up like 500, 600%, and completely surpassed basically, the NAV of that trust. It's a fascinating chart, but you think about, okay, who actually has access to that grayscale chain link trust? It's institutional and it's traditional finance people. And so I think you're starting to see some of the okay, bitcoin is going to happen. Well, what's next? Questions being asked, and I think it's driving a lot of market momentum, but that's not in my mind.
00:23:05.206 - 00:23:07.080, Speaker B: Like, yeah, here we go.
00:23:08.110 - 00:23:13.114, Speaker A: That's just so funny. Come on. That's so funny. Yeah.
00:23:13.232 - 00:23:41.860, Speaker B: Oh, my god. And that's an institutionalized product. And what we're looking at here is I think Chainlink, at least on this chart, is probably about $14. But the Chain Link Grayscale trust price is something like $45. And that is the difference between the market price of the trust itself and the underlying holdings per share, which is supposed to be the representative, like fair market value of the trust.
00:23:42.390 - 00:23:51.254, Speaker A: Yeah, there have been some pretty big premiums to NAV on some closed end grayscale products, but that is about as big as one I've ever seen.
00:23:51.452 - 00:24:24.346, Speaker B: Hilarious. Also, a person on our team, Adam, formerly of Chainlink, sent me a hilarious screen grab of thousands of link marines in a Twitter spaces. And the Twitter space title was $14. Waiting room. And you've got thousands of people in this Twitter spaces just singing to each other and doing these chants. It was so funny. Wait, I forgot.
00:24:24.378 - 00:24:26.486, Speaker A: We've got chain link god coming on the pod.
00:24:26.618 - 00:24:30.020, Speaker B: I was going to say, yeah, I connected with him.
00:24:30.870 - 00:24:42.630, Speaker A: I honestly think it's one of these areas that I've just slept on and I was like, I should talk to someone about just about this. And he's a really smart guy. I was like, we should do something on channeling. So that's actually pretty fortuitous timing.
00:24:43.450 - 00:25:19.780, Speaker B: We'll have tons of fun conversations next week as well. All of this is to say, I don't think that this is the blow off the top like Dmsquez, where you see it rocket up and then get sold off at the top. It's going to EB and flow. Of course. This is the animal spirits are starting to come back into the market. You're starting to see these green shoots of cult like experiences and memetic movements. And I think all of this is with the backdrop of institutionalization for the two core assets that are coming probably in the next like seven to eight months, if not sooner than that.
00:25:19.780 - 00:26:20.360, Speaker B: How much they will actually move, how much the inflows will actually be, remains to be seen. Everybody has their guess. But I think just with that backdrop, you've got so many positive catalysts. So one of the questions you asked was what are entrepreneurs saying? This is also the time of year where we have all of our end of year, hey, let's check in LP calls with our biggest LPs and Vance is actually at an LP event right now. And kind of the broad sentiment across the board there is everybody is getting ready and they know that things kind of come back on in the next two to three months or six months. I think the institutions are the smart money, they're the fastest horse, they're the ones that are moving quickest and they're going to start to fill bags ahead of all these positive catalysts that are six months away.
00:26:20.730 - 00:26:48.830, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, I've got some sort of follow up questions there. So in terms of some of the idiosyncratic green shoots bubbles. There's like, Chain Link. It's actually funny. So one of our analysts went to this Goldman Sachs conference, this funny little anecdote just talking about Chainlink. And Sergey Nazarov, the chainlink founder, was speaking there. He said of everyone at this whole Sachs conference, people were swarming this guy.
00:26:48.830 - 00:27:17.378, Speaker A: Everyone wanted to talk to this guy, which is just funny. And look, I mean, Chainlink has been has been rallying like crazy. There's the Solana thing that's taken off quite a bit. And then I guess there's I'm trying to think about mean, I guess those are really the big two. And then there's Bitcoin and Bitcoin's, the sort of institutionalization narrative. And we just got the ETH news sort of just dropped today, but it looks like that April is sort of the rough timeline that people are now thinking about. So there's kind of a dual institutional narrative.
00:27:17.378 - 00:27:20.362, Speaker A: And then more green shoots, maybe crypto natives moving.
00:27:20.416 - 00:28:04.482, Speaker B: I mean, the other one, and it was reported on last week, I think Blockworks covered it. But there's been sort of a resurgence of AXS, Ronan, SLP, which are Web 3D gaming assets. These subcategories are starting to make a comeback after the 99% sell offs that they've all gone through. And a 300%, 400, 500% move upwards just means that you're only 95% down, but it's a 300% return off of the low. So these aren't the crazy times. This is really just like the beginning of the start. And that's kind of how I would describe where we are in the cycle.
00:28:04.482 - 00:28:21.622, Speaker B: And frankly, it feels like 2019 again. Like the end of 2019, you had these little bull trends, and then it would drop for a couple of weeks, and then you go up and the stuff starts to take effect over a couple of these cycles because more and more people will start to notice it. And that's when the momentum starts to shift.
00:28:21.766 - 00:28:53.190, Speaker A: Got it. Let me ask you this. So I feel like what we saw in the last market cycle, the rotation went something like this. Bitcoin was the firm leader, right? Like Spot, bitcoin price sort of led everything. ETH trailed a little bit, but there was a period of time where it was almost like one for one catch ups. Like Bitcoin would run first, then the market would rebalance ETH up, and then ETH started to run ahead of Bitcoin, and then that really rotated into Alts. And that's when you had the Crazy Axi run solana, some of these honestly, like Cardano and BNB ran super hard then too.
00:28:53.190 - 00:29:26.740, Speaker A: And then the sort of NFT Craze, all that kind of stuff. I feel like back then, people it wasn't as widespread, the knowledge of that playbook. But now I feel like that's more within recent memory of everyone watching that cycle happen. So to your point about institutions asking what happens next, do you think that plays out the same way that it did last time or. Very similarly, or is it different because people know it now and they're like, oh, I know how this works, and instead of waiting for alts to run, I'm just going to skip and go right to alts or something like that. Do you know what I'm, you know what I mean?
00:29:29.110 - 00:30:44.246, Speaker B: If we didn't have the thought to be impending bitcoin ETF, followed by the ETH ETF, I would have said a smarter person who's lived through a couple of cycles says, oh, bitcoin is pumping great, I'm going to go buy some index bet on DFI or web3 gaming or whatever it may be. Just skip to the final conclusion because dollars moving into those assets have a multiplication effect much higher than bitcoin or ETH or salana or anything else. The difference though is, I think if we have what is expected with these ETFs and then what is expected with the inflows, there is going to be a different element this cycle, which is basically just duration hold of those ETF based assets. And what I mean by this is let's say people who want to buy bitcoin or ETH are generally able to do it on the platforms that we're talking about, the centralized exchanges, maybe even like the grayscale trust. I don't think there's too much activity there though. But if most people want to buy bitcoin and ETH, they can. So the ETF products are targeted at a different audience.
00:30:44.246 - 00:32:01.310, Speaker B: And that different audience is largely made up of money managers. And the way that either a money manager works in terms of asset allocation and providing their services or managing retirement accounts or automated retirement accounts, is that they allocate based off of a percentage basis. And that means that people who are contributing to their 401K, their IRA, or they're adding more money with their investment manager every single time that they do that, every two weeks they get a paycheck. That means that there's sort of this consistent buy in terms of that 1%, that 3% going to bitcoin, going to ETH, et cetera, which builds a base of duration of hold that I think we haven't seen yet in previous cycles. If bitcoin went from five k to 25K, there's bound to be a lot of the people who bought it at five k who are like, great, I'm going to take the five x and pair back and see what I want to do next. But that doesn't exist as much in the professionally money managed industries. Maybe there are people who will trade the ETF based off of vol or based off of swing trading.
00:32:01.310 - 00:32:05.460, Speaker B: That's going to happen. But the majority of people I think, are going to be buy and hold.
00:32:05.770 - 00:33:22.682, Speaker A: Yeah, you know what, just anecdotally on that point about institutions, we put out different strands of content across different channels. Like some of our stuff is really crypto native, some of it's really institutionally focused. And honestly, for a while, the more crypto native stuff has been trouncing the institutional recently within the last two months ish there's been a change in sort of what people are interested in and listening to and that also has been mirrored. So we've got this coming conference, Das London, which you advance will be at it's going to be huge, going to be great and you get a bell BC oh shoot, I forgot the actual discount code. But you get a discount code, click the link in the bottom for your tickets. But the reception to this conference has been we've been getting on the phone with like hey, just kicking the tires of the Goldman's, the JPMorgans point 72s, these big funds like hey, would you be interested in speaking? They're like yes. Not like, oh yeah, the interest is and I feel like it's more anecdotal evidence to the point that you were making about just people being sort of ready and moving off the sidelines and wanting to get back into the mix and realizing that these big catalysts are close.
00:33:22.682 - 00:33:38.066, Speaker A: And we haven't even talked about the having, but the having is also I think in the zeitgeist more than it has been in previous cycles. Last having we weren't getting notes uh, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley being like the having isn't priced in got, you.
00:33:38.088 - 00:33:43.490, Speaker B: Got Joe and Aaron Ross sorkin talking about it live on MSNBC on CNBC.
00:33:45.770 - 00:33:47.800, Speaker A: Yeah it's crazy. It's crazy.
00:33:50.490 - 00:34:51.640, Speaker B: To be clear, historically it's been 18 months post havening for that massive run up and the realization of it mostly because you've got a bunch of miners and really the habiting removing, I don't know, probably like six or $7 billion at this point worth of supply overhang from the market. Anecdotally I think one of the not miscalculations but misunderstandings of 2023 was just how much latent ETH supply was left within miners. And I think that they've been selling out over the course of the year. And I think we've talked about this on previous episodes but you had that large call seller a couple of weeks ago which kind of initiated the run up. There are all these strikes at the end of October at like 1700, 1750 which had to be covered. I think Bitcoin goes through similar cycles in that proof of work to proof of stake represented just a total shut off. Right.
00:34:51.640 - 00:35:20.606, Speaker B: And everybody expected well as soon as it shuts off you're not going to have any miners selling because they've already been selling. I think that that was wrong and I think that that's why you see an 18 month lag historically on the Bitcoin happening is because a lot of these miners hold on to their Bitcoin to find opportune moments to sell. And so I think the happening will be a big moment but it's really the effect months and quarters after the happening where we're going to see more positive price trajectory.
00:35:20.638 - 00:35:48.486, Speaker A: I would yeah yeah I think you might be right about that. All right everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of Crypto. We are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers. So think TradFi, macro funds, crypto, native funds, big allocators and financial institutions. So banks, payment processors, et cetera, all in one spot.
00:35:48.486 - 00:36:14.094, Speaker A: It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan Zero, 72, whatever, all in one room. So you can know what the big money is doing. We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of Macro and crypto where we are in the cycle of real world assets. So everything from stablecoins to onchain treasuries to tokenized assets, it's going to be a blast. But the other reason you really want to go is London baby, center of the world. At one point you got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer, it's going to be a blast.
00:36:14.094 - 00:37:07.974, Speaker A: So because you're such great listeners to Bell Curve, there's a code, Bell 20 that's going to get you 20% off. So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage, you'll see all of our speakers and use Bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code. I will see you in sunny London town in actually I spoke to Adam Back last week. There's a really interesting chart of bitcoin hash rate which has bucked this trend that it used to have of usually what happens with hash rate and price. The relationship there is that price leads hash rate so the price goes up just like in any sort of commodity producer relationship, the commodity producer in this case the miners try to chase that price, it brings more hash rate online and then it ends up there's that kind of lead lag relationship.
00:37:07.974 - 00:38:09.314, Speaker A: But if you look at this is the chart of what that looks like this last cycle, which has been a massive deviation, which is up on my screen here, the price has been tanking, but hash rate is just like a one way stream up, which is really bizarre. And I asked Adam Back about this and his explanation was one of the things that changed in the mining industry previous, and this might explain some of the ETH overhang as well, is the availability of credit around this time. So basically as this was going on, there was a bunch of mining equipment that got purchased by having access to credit. And then what happens is there's like a lag in between when that gets purchased and when you actually get the asics delivered. So if you can imagine like a bunch of asics getting delivered, like right around here. Okay, now it's kind of a sunk cost. The market has turned.
00:38:09.314 - 00:38:27.006, Speaker A: You probably can't even sell those asics if you wanted to. And so it's kind of like, well, I might as well just turn these things on, and mine hence. Why it's just been such a brutal road for bitcoin miners recently, actually, and you see this weird divergence in the relationship between price and hash rate.
00:38:27.188 - 00:39:11.626, Speaker B: That's interesting. I intuitively understand that. I think the other thing so hash rate aside, the other thing I think about in terms of the last 18 months, and there's going to be natural sort of like and so many people put out these analysis of like Metcalf's law analysis. So what's the network value of bitcoin? Or what's the network value of any of these ecosystems? And you're valuing them based like they're a network. And the intuition there is that networks grow proportionally to the number of people who are in the network. And as these networks or network value grows. And so you can kind of assume basic understanding of where value should aggregate.
00:39:11.626 - 00:40:14.782, Speaker B: But the one thing that we don't ever really think about or apply to that is the structural process of removing major players from the ecosystem. And the structured selling that was required to do so was just such a massive exogenous effect to the progression of that process that we're probably undervalued to where those network valuations would forecast right now. And it's because we're still picking up, barely still picking up the pieces from all of these things. So I think of it in two ways. There's the hash rate, that's something that's really fascinating and credit to go buy bitcoin miners. I mean, maybe it's a good time to be buying bitcoin miners if there's excess supply. But then there's also the question of like, if you remove the massive blow ups and three arrows just doesn't just fades away.
00:40:14.782 - 00:40:25.460, Speaker B: FTS just fades away. They don't absolutely get where are we where we are right now if those two things didn't happen? Hard to know, but I would definitely say no.
00:40:26.070 - 00:41:06.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I would tend to agree with you there. Is it a good time to buy bitcoin miners? I don't know. But Blockstream does have this product, actually, where they notice there's honestly, you know what? It's similar to the relationship of we've talked about this before, about how public market proxies for crypto like Coinbase or MicroStrategy end up running up more and then getting hurt more on the way down because there's this sort of hidden premium similarly similar to mine equipment. So it's like on the run up, the value of the asics actually runs up more than bitcoin. And then on the way down, you get it on the way down as well, which kind of makes sense to me, because when the price of bitcoin goes up, everyone's like, oh my God, I need these things. Bitcoin's going up. A million dollars and stuff like that.
00:41:06.210 - 00:41:12.178, Speaker A: So we haven't seen any of those either. We haven't seen any million dollar bitcoin pricing predictions either.
00:41:12.344 - 00:41:13.874, Speaker B: What are you talking about?
00:41:14.072 - 00:41:15.906, Speaker A: Oh, really? I haven't seen that.
00:41:15.928 - 00:41:19.960, Speaker B: Michael Saylor said 5 million. Kathy woods said 1.5 million.
00:41:24.410 - 00:41:50.142, Speaker A: I will say I saw Kathy Wood give this ins. We had started that podcast with Pomp off the chain before it was the Pomp podcast. And Kathy Wood was one of the early guests. So this must have been 2019. And she gave this price prediction for Tesla. She was like, our base case is $700 and our bull case is 4000. And I was like, I think my draw was actually open.
00:41:50.142 - 00:42:06.526, Speaker A: I was like, I called Yana after, I was like, Dude, I just heard the craziest. She said this. And this was pre stock split and everything. So now it's not even a hit. But yeah, I wouldn't fade Kathy. I know people like to hate on her because she makes these big, bold predictions, but I'm a Kathy Wood fan.
00:42:06.558 - 00:42:11.702, Speaker B: I like her. Anyone who is a growth investor over the last 18 months had a tough time.
00:42:11.836 - 00:42:12.902, Speaker A: But I agree.
00:42:13.036 - 00:42:16.934, Speaker B: I think if you zoom out a little bit, she will be proven right.
00:42:17.132 - 00:43:00.338, Speaker A: I agree with that. So one other thing. I'd be curious to get your sort of take on just as someone in the industry, maybe as opposed to something like the actual actually what happened. But there was a very interesting post from Evgeny Gavoy, who is the CEO at Winter Mute, about near and Aurora this week. So basically, Evany accused the Near Foundation and Aurora Labs of failing to redeem 11.2 million in USN stablecoins for USDT as promised under a deal. So basically, USN is like a very an algorithmic stablecoin, very similar to Terra Luna.
00:43:00.338 - 00:43:25.678, Speaker A: They switched from being an Algo stablecoin, basically, to one which is backed by USDT. After the collapse of Terra, I guess Evgeny from the Alameda State purchased $11.2 million worth of USN. And then they basically said, no, we actually are not going to refund you. So Evany made this whole Twitter post. And first of all, I thought it was interesting. I have no idea who's right in this situation.
00:43:25.678 - 00:43:56.120, Speaker A: It looks like there was some backstopping from the Near Foundation of this claim. I thought about this a lot after when FTX blew up and everyone's like, we have to call out bad actors in the future. I was curious what you think about that, because then people have to air public grievances and no one really likes doing that. So I don't know if you had any thoughts on the Evgeny post or this idea of calling people out on Twitter, because I see the merits to it for sure, but I could see where it could go wrong too. Just curious to get your take on the whole thing.
00:43:57.210 - 00:45:07.722, Speaker B: Any sort of perspective that I have here is going to be dislodged from any particular events because every single one of these types of situations is so specific you can't just blanket say one way or another. Listen, there have been historically a number of times where people in the space have done nefarious things to say the least, and I would guess 95% of them probably go unnoticed or uncared because it's the way that they operate. Anything from like, it's not working, so we're going to shut it down and return the treasury. Maybe you should have kept working harder on it. Or maybe there's another way to do this. Or you're just kind of like, okay, as an entrepreneur, I'm going to move on, which is totally fine, but people may be pissed off about that. To rugging something, being able to be anonymous on Twitter and form a protocol and this is more DeFi summer days, but all of those types of situations are just not copacetic to straight up fraud.
00:45:07.722 - 00:46:09.906, Speaker B: And obviously we've seen that as well. But there are a lot of times where people in the space think that they can get away with things. And I think it's important when you feel like you have a strong case to fight for that case. And from our perspective, if we were ever put in a situation like that, we have a fiduciary duty to our LPs and we have to make sure that we do as best we can to represent them when we're the ones that are in charge of assets in question. If it's business tactics for Winter Mute and near to go after the situation, that's totally fine too, if they feel the need to. But pulling on the thread of public dismay I think doesn't really ever get that far. You may get a couple people on Twitter to be like, that's it, I'm never know x or Y or Z, but most people are just going to the press cycle will move on and people will forget about it.
00:46:09.906 - 00:46:26.806, Speaker B: And so I think there are other means of enacting getting right by a situation where you feel wronged, but doing it in public I think is just sort of like a last resort or maybe it's not something that we would want to do.
00:46:26.988 - 00:46:52.782, Speaker A: Yeah, because I think it's tempting as well. By the way, I love Afghani and Winter Mutant. I have no knowledge of this at just it was the first time there was a lot of chatter about that post FTX implosion. It's like if you see something, say something. And this was the first instance of that that I publicly saw by someone that I respect a lot and follow and it's like, oh, that's kind of an interesting that's interesting. So I guess we'll have to see if we see more of that. All right, last question for you.
00:46:52.782 - 00:47:40.462, Speaker A: And maybe it could be more of a broad almost like hypothetical, but I saw this week that near and Polygon released something so basically Polygon and near bringing this Zkwasm idea to life where they're basically simplifying the way that ZK proofs work. ZK proofing works on near and they're sort of aligning with Polygon, which brings them closer to Ethereum. Frankly, it's a little bit over my head, technically, so I'm just not even going to touch that. But here's my question to you, because this is what got me thinking. So there are a bunch of protocols, I'm starting to think about some of these protocols I haven't thought about in a while. Like near avalanche. I actually do think about this one, but Celestia is a really good example of a new L one.
00:47:40.462 - 00:48:24.510, Speaker A: And some of these alt L ones or like alternative layer ones have chosen to sort of counter position against Ethereum and they've been like, you know what, we're really different. Salana is a really good example of someone that's counter positioned against Ethereum and others are like, you know what? We're kind of aligned. Like, Celestia is one where it's like I see a lot of the sort of research events that I go to. It's like Celestia people and Ethereum people and Cosmos is sort of somewhere in the middle, I guess. If you unilaterally had control of a layer one, how would you think about that? Would you go the Ethereum alignment route and there are some pros and cons with that strategy, or would you go the counter position route where you're like, I'm just totally different in ways X, Y and Z. And this is why I'm different and unique.
00:48:26.290 - 00:49:00.486, Speaker B: On the ZK WASM stuff and Near, I literally am looking at a tab or two right now where it's like, okay, I need to read this later. So I also don't have full context on that one situation, but next week I will. I don't know. The kind of rudimentary way that I think about it is there's two main functions for a blockchain. There's settlement and then there's execution. And execution is largely how you're going to interface with either the applications or the customers. And I think we'll see if this trend continues.
00:49:00.486 - 00:49:49.640, Speaker B: But we're starting to see maybe even a third layer, which is the UX. And UX, by and large, is either going to be like a self custody or it's going to be sort of like a pseudo centralized hosted experience, depending on what it may be. So that's the basic layers of the stack. In my mind, you've got Ethereum, who is both settlement and execution, and then you've got L two S that focus more on execution and transaction throughput at the execution layer than they do the settlement. Salana monolith. So full stack, execution, settlement. It's also possible now that you can have SVM execution environments that are built on top of the DA or settlement layer of.
00:49:49.640 - 00:50:35.350, Speaker B: So, like, you're starting to see all the commingling of these different layers based off of different parts of the tech stack for these ecosystems. And so it's impossible to say, like, I think you should counter position or I think you should align. But what I do think you need to do, and the only way for these blockchains to ultimately get adopted is to define an application category where you have a true advantage, ethereum. And this is based off of the 2020 2021 run up and DFI summer and all of those things, they have DFI, they have internet moneyness. It's where the TVL exists. Even look at the TVL chart of Salana. It's not anything comparable.
00:50:35.350 - 00:51:20.374, Speaker B: It's where also the best NFTs exist because of the so like they have kind of taken that realm of the world. And even today we have a wallet. We're trying to bridge assets and trying to send Ethereum from L one to optimism. It's still such a clunky experience. Why can't I one click swap 0.1 E just to be able to put gas into an unfunded wallet? The user experiences across these different layers is also garbage. And so I think Solana is very obviously going after speed and throughput and there will be applications and therefore cost, and there will be applications that gravitate towards that.
00:51:20.374 - 00:52:08.194, Speaker B: My question is, what will be the first that hits that breakout scale and when will it happen? But that's the counter positioning that they have. Celestia says, hey, you want to have optimism or Arbitrum execution instead of settling back down to ETH mainnet, like settle on our DA layer, that's totally acceptable. Or you can even have, you know, settle down to Celestia. So I don't know, maybe this is like a very rudimentary way of looking at it, but that's kind of how I think about it. And it will be defined by the application categories. If we look at where all of the games are being built, it's not Solana, even though transaction throughput is highest there. So it seems like Polygon is making great strides.
00:52:08.194 - 00:52:22.042, Speaker B: Ronan, obviously that we're talking about making great strides and I think we're going to continue to see that kind of application category differentiation. So, yeah, that's my quick and dirty on it.
00:52:22.176 - 00:53:11.494, Speaker A: Okay, let me follow up question for you here, because there's the actual application, like what these things do and how they all sort of mechanically go together and where they belong in the user flow. But then there's this other component of crypto which is like almost like the distribution mechanism and the importance of community, especially for layer ones. One of the things that I think Ethereum got super right, it was in a sense a counterposition to Bitcoin. I feel like that maybe takes away from Ethereum. But what I mean by that is the Bitcoin community is like this really hard, almost like religiously, it's almost like a return to Roman sort of values know, they've got this whole thing going on. You know what I'm talking about? Ethereum is the opposite of that. It was very optimistic very hopeful, very research based.
00:53:11.494 - 00:53:57.160, Speaker A: And one of the things that was, I think, attractive about Ethereum is you could very clearly say this is what makes a bitcoin person and this is what makes an Ethereum person. I think Solana had that as like they were just like we are. I the way that I would distinguish it is like they're like engineers. They're more pragmatic, more engineering focused, just a different vibe. And so I feel like that's kind of an important squishy subjective, but still really important indicator of success for one of these communities. So that's what I'm kind of trying to get at, where it's like you can sort of strike out on your own, but there are a lot of these L ones where I look at it and it's like, what makes a I don't want that seem like I'm picking on anyone, but I can't really easily define what this person looks like. Like a polygon person.
00:53:57.160 - 00:54:10.554, Speaker A: So I wonder about that. I don't know. That might be maybe one of the disadvantages of sort of aligning with Ethereum, so to speak, because you fail to develop your own person, if that makes sense.
00:54:10.752 - 00:54:41.254, Speaker B: So let me play back to you and change a little bit and tell you more of my perspective. Also, just to be clear, we're very bullish on Salana. We invest in the ecosystem across the board. It's just more of like, there are differences and that's kind of what I want to hit on. I remember very distinctly in the 2016 17, 1819 era, of all the bitcoin people came out with pitchforks when Ethereum launched. And it was like, you're never going to scale. It's never going to work.
00:54:41.254 - 00:55:23.166, Speaker B: DeFi doesn't mean anything. We're going to build DeFi on, like, we're going to have NFTs on bitcoin. It's like, okay, sure. And I could absolutely see I don't think Ethereum will fall subject to the same issue, which is, okay, like other blockchain over there, good luck. You're never going to be able to do it. I think one of the benefits of being optimistic around your approach to open source development and building blockchains is that there could be many ways that everybody wins. And it sounds a little bit cliche to say that, but Solana is going to have its own application categories that are just probably not even feasible on Ethereum.
00:55:23.166 - 00:56:11.890, Speaker B: Maybe it's more financial oriented because of the high throughput, maybe it's more consumer oriented because of the low cost. Just remains to be seen is kind of the sentiment that I'm expressing. But it will be different. And I think Ethereum also isn't going to come out with pitchforks when those application categories do emerge. I think they're going to be like, great, we've got our own stuff going on over here too. So I agree with you. If I were to guess, I think probably consumer application categories are kind of the next thing to hit just because it seems like DeFi and TVL, at least for now, is staying on Ethereum and a lot of the games are trying to tap into that liquidity.
00:56:11.890 - 00:56:56.098, Speaker B: But the other reason why you would have a blockchain, win or lose, is because you're able to attract new users. And I really do wonder. We've lost a lot of people, for sure, in the last cycle. We're going to gain a ton of net new people in this cycle. Like, if you were totally fresh, no dogma, no history coming into this ecosystem, where would you go? And that's kind of the other angle here too, is like, where are all those net new people coming? Because it could be a totally new platform, it could be Solana, it could be Ethereum. That's kind of, I think, the really important question to answer. And we'll see.
00:56:56.264 - 00:57:34.618, Speaker A: Yeah, could be a totally new platform as well. And that's what I like. Even outside of Solana bitcoin Ethereum, I've been thinking about these kind of like near avalanche ecosystems as well because there's so much that's what I was really asking. I was like for some of those, which are very big, even some of the layer twos, I wonder if this ends up being a factor as well. Is there an arbitram person versus an optimism person? I kind of think there is a little bit. I find the branding element of it pretty interesting. And I've been wondering what some of these layer ones.
00:57:34.618 - 00:57:55.140, Speaker A: I sort of feel like if they're going to make it this cycle and there are a couple that are in limbo that could make it or could not. And it's like you probably have to do some work defining your person and community. And I'll be really and you know what, there are probably going to be a bunch of new ones that launch, like Monad is launching soon. Like, that one seems pretty cool. I don't know. I've got no idea. But not financial advice, obviously.
00:57:55.140 - 00:58:03.366, Speaker A: I'm just interested. I'm just curious to see how it all sort of plays do.
00:58:03.388 - 00:58:42.014, Speaker B: I will say, though, going back to it, the community development is something to not strawfad. It's something to really dig into and pay attention to because everyone loves a comeback story, everybody loves an underdog story. And you may be fresh and new and you're trying to get new people to come over with you, but if you already can build the network effects of having some people there, having some value there, it's going to take off. I think maybe it's not necessarily like what has the best tech or what has the best applications. It just is like, what is the best option when that onslaught of new users comes in and they're like, where do we go? And then that just sort of like the snowball starts rolling downhill.
00:58:42.142 - 00:58:48.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're probably right. All right, partner, I think we can call it. This was a fun one.
00:58:49.050 - 00:58:53.990, Speaker B: This is great. See you next week with CLG.
00:58:54.410 - 00:58:59.480, Speaker A: Chain. Link. God, baby, I'm really pumped for that episode, actually. The Link marines are a fun community.
00:59:00.970 - 00:59:01.780, Speaker B: Tell me about it.
