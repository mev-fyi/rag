00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.398, Speaker A: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:08.484 - 00:00:28.454, Speaker B: Alright, everyone, this episode is brought to you by our friends at avalanche. They are the layer one blockchain that is fast, stable and scalable. You're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. For now, let's get into it. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You're here with Mike. Michael took us however many episodes, finally solved that.
00:00:28.454 - 00:00:30.920, Speaker B: Vanceignano, fellas, welcome to the show.
00:00:31.690 - 00:00:32.918, Speaker C: What's up, guys?
00:00:33.084 - 00:00:33.510, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:33.580 - 00:00:36.790, Speaker A: So, Michael, you just really hate the name Mike, huh?
00:00:37.210 - 00:00:38.650, Speaker D: No, I don't really hate it.
00:00:38.720 - 00:00:40.810, Speaker B: It's not a great name. It's not a great name.
00:00:40.880 - 00:00:42.730, Speaker A: I think it's a worse name than Michael.
00:00:44.270 - 00:00:46.650, Speaker D: That's factually accurate.
00:00:47.550 - 00:00:55.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Michael has some prestige to it. I'm also not a fan of Iverson, actually. I don't want to I don't want to do it.
00:00:55.588 - 00:01:01.200, Speaker A: You say michael everywhere. Like your email is Michael at but you just get bodied and just let yourself be.
00:01:02.370 - 00:01:08.946, Speaker B: What do you what are you trying to do here? You would try to pit the Michaels against each other. What is it? What is it? Where are you?
00:01:08.968 - 00:01:11.700, Speaker A: Yeah, Vance and I are just sitting on the sidelines. Yeah.
00:01:12.070 - 00:01:15.266, Speaker B: Why does it look like you're coming live from a sauna or something like that?
00:01:15.288 - 00:01:21.170, Speaker C: Or like a 70s where are you undisclosed like sauna.
00:01:21.530 - 00:01:23.080, Speaker A: That's how relaxed I am.
00:01:24.090 - 00:01:34.890, Speaker D: Well, my location is currently at the framework office in the Bahamas. We're shutting it down so had to come here live and close it up.
00:01:35.040 - 00:01:41.498, Speaker B: Yeah. Are you guys also audited by Arminino? It's like you FTX and Binance as the auditor.
00:01:41.674 - 00:01:47.840, Speaker C: I think if we gave those statements to our LPs, they'd be like, these aren't real. What are you guys doing?
00:01:48.290 - 00:01:49.710, Speaker B: Is anyone literally?
00:01:51.650 - 00:01:57.186, Speaker D: Literally one of the first questions that you get when you're fundraising is who is your administrator and who is your.
00:01:57.208 - 00:01:59.666, Speaker C: Auditor and where do you custody and.
00:01:59.688 - 00:02:06.594, Speaker D: Where do you custody? And if they don't know the names of any of the three of those places and they don't trust them, red.
00:02:06.632 - 00:02:08.566, Speaker C: Flag not going to give you money.
00:02:08.748 - 00:02:42.750, Speaker B: Yeah, if it's not a big four. I was laughing at the I don't know if you saw the Enron, I forget his name, but the Enron guy who's been brought in to be the CEO of FTX now, john Ray JJ or something. Yeah, he's actually got a couple of zingers in some of the material that he's released and he basically said the auditor who's best known for being domiciled in the metaverse, I don't know if you caught that, but guy's got a bit of a sense of humor. Yeah, it's pretty funny.
00:02:43.510 - 00:03:03.334, Speaker D: He's like an old salty bankruptcy guy. And imagine him coming in and being like, this is real, you idiots gave this group of people that much mean. It's comical, it must just be like tying together loose ends of spaghetti and trying to make a puzzle piece out of it.
00:03:03.532 - 00:03:35.406, Speaker C: It feels like him and it feels like the guy Terry from the CME and like the whole Chicago CME CBOE crew is having their little victory lap right now. Terry, one thing I just I just want to make very clear. Terry is not here to save us, full stop. He is the reason why a lot of these systems are so siloed and are so backwards and inaccessible to know. Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and then declare Terry the new king of our space. I don't really think that that's appropriate. I also doubt that conversation happened.
00:03:35.406 - 00:03:37.890, Speaker C: That conversation sounds like a made up conversation.
00:03:38.630 - 00:03:41.422, Speaker B: And then I told him he was a scammer.
00:03:41.566 - 00:03:50.840, Speaker C: Four to one. I have more money in my pocket than you have net worth. That's not how you talk to people at all, at any level. And if you do, you're not at that level.
00:03:51.290 - 00:03:57.490, Speaker A: No, but I do believe that Terry's been watching this go down just like pouring himself a little bottle of McAllen.
00:03:57.570 - 00:03:59.400, Speaker C: Twelve. Yes.
00:04:01.950 - 00:04:09.286, Speaker B: You know what energy he was projecting in that interview was? Have you ever seen Alec Baldwin's character in Glenn Gary? Glenn Ross?
00:04:09.398 - 00:04:09.722, Speaker C: Yes.
00:04:09.776 - 00:04:17.950, Speaker B: You know, he kind of comes in, he says, first prize is a Cadillac, second prize set of knives. Third price, you're fired.
00:04:19.890 - 00:04:21.310, Speaker C: That's how he rolled.
00:04:25.490 - 00:04:41.766, Speaker D: No, I was going to say just to clarify, this is Terry, who is the head of the CME, who apparently had a conversation with SBF, called him a fraud and a scammer to his face. Said some other crazy stuff. Unbelievable stuff. True.
00:04:41.868 - 00:04:45.880, Speaker C: How big was the know? This big? Was it a.
00:04:47.770 - 00:04:48.818, Speaker D: Yeah, it doesn't seem.
00:04:48.834 - 00:04:50.540, Speaker A: Like a real I'm not buying it.
00:04:52.190 - 00:05:29.334, Speaker B: All right, guys, let's get into the stories of the week. I want to talk a little bit about some of the updates on DCG's attempted fundraising for Genesis. We know that they were seeking basically, emergency relief of a billion dollars. That amount has been lowered to 500 million. Before we get into the specifics about Genesis, I'd love to get your guys thoughts on just DCG in general. It's been kind of surprising to me to understand that there's credible risk that DCG actually might be in trouble. Up to about a week ago, it looked like this was just contained to Genesis, and maybe we can take this back to this idea.
00:05:29.334 - 00:06:08.180, Speaker B: Barry Silbert background, 2016, kind of 2018 type of time frame, talked a lot about DCG as building the Berkshire Hathaway of crypto. And I think you can gain a lot of how he viewed the space and what he was building with sort of this portfolio of five different companies that were all very infrastructure based, all very picks and shovels, sort of oriented, and all aimed at producing cash flow which was going to go into funding the investment side of business. I think there are a couple of reasons why the analogy or why it hasn't worked out exactly as he might have hoped. But I'd be curious to know how you guys think of DCG as a business and what sort of the trouble that they find themselves in now.
00:06:10.230 - 00:07:17.394, Speaker D: So DCG, at least is the Stalwart, they're the OG, they're the ones that created the first digital asset trust, which now is Grayscale. Genesis is the largest lender in the industry, period, or at least was. And I think they're one of the first, if not the first, registered derivatives exchange, genesis in the US as so they've kind of gotten this moniker being the first, the biggest in a lot of different ways. They also own CoinDesk, which one of the I think it was Tarun who officially pointed this out. CoinDesk was the publication that pointed out the balance sheet, which kicked the dominoes rolling. That ultimately brought down FTX, now Lamita, which then ultimately brought down, ostensibly Genesis as they're seeking emergency funding. Kind of funny that one subsidiary ends up taking out the other, but ultimately I think so Barry put out a letter, I think it was yesterday.
00:07:17.394 - 00:07:57.618, Speaker D: All the days are starting to run together where DCG is seeking emergency funding to be able to stave off this illiquidity crisis at Genesis. And I think that's really all that it, you know, thinking back to who is Genesis, who is DCG, who is Mean? They've been historically some of the most capitalized people in the space. It's the largest digital asset trust both in GBTC as well as EC, and they are one of the biggest operators in kind of the lending space for crypto, period. So to say that they're massive is kind of like the best way to describe it.
00:07:57.784 - 00:08:29.374, Speaker C: They also own Foundry, which is now the largest bitcoin miner in the world. Depends on how valuable you think that is. But that's a big business in a bull run. Grayscale is the largest cryptocurrency asset manager on the planet at this point. They have about 10 billion, 12 billion of AUM, something like that. And Barry says that these companies are going to spit off about $800 billion of cash flow. And at the beginning of the year there was a round that was done into DCG that valued it at $10 billion.
00:08:29.374 - 00:08:54.770, Speaker C: I'm not sure if they actually issued more shares or if they just bought back secondary, but no, it's just secondary. Right. It was marked super high. Nine months ago, this was one of the most successful companies in the space. Now everyone's talking about bankruptcy. I'm not as convinced that this is as big of a problem as people say. A lot of the news cycle entrants I see on Twitter really are pushing this narrative of all the OGS are dying.
00:08:54.770 - 00:09:32.514, Speaker C: This is going to go, oh, yeah, they're going to redeem the trust. Like all the GBDC I bought is going to go up two X because they're going to redeem it. That just makes no sense at all. And why does that make no sense? If you look at the sum of their business, grayscale is the most valuable part and it's spitting off even this year, 200, $300 million of fees this year, and that's quite substantial. If anything, they're going to protect that asset and try to fill the hole with any other assets that they have. They also have 200 funds and investments in their portfolio, some of which are very strong. So this company seems to be much more capitalized or better capitalized than people think.
00:09:32.514 - 00:10:30.774, Speaker C: I'm just not that worried about them. It is kind of interesting to wind back the tape to this summer with Genesis and their role in a very interesting swap between the Luna Foundation Guard, three arrows and themselves. And what happened in that swap was Doe took a billion dollars of UST, swapped it by three arrows in Genesis for a billion dollars of Bitcoin, and then Genesis was left with this UST. What would I do if I were Genesis and I had a billion of UST? I would probably short it to neutralize my exposure. And what happens when you short a billion dollars of UST? The price could go down quite significantly. And this swap happened a week, two weeks before everything blew up. So if you look at everything that's happened and Genesis's role in it, potentially that was one of the crucible moments of this market.
00:10:30.774 - 00:10:45.900, Speaker C: And they're right in the middle of so, like, it's better capitalized than I think people understand. But I think the role that that desk has played in the ups and downs of the crypto market is not fully understood and I think it's much larger than people understand as well.
00:10:47.070 - 00:11:38.874, Speaker B: Yeah. I think there was something else that happened with Genesis last year that I haven't confirmed this, so I want to say this is just something I've heard from someone I trust, but there was a change in compensation structure at Genesis, and this was probably a story that many of you who've been operating crypto for the last two years will know. It was extremely difficult to maintain talent at any one given period of time. And there was a discussion internally about how can we incentivize our traders and our salespeople basically to give them more upside, lower base, higher variable upside. They wanted to keep them. So a larger percentage of the especially sales desk at Genesis became commission. And when it's like, hey, we want to go out and get commission, some of the standards about what they would accept as collateral went down.
00:11:38.874 - 00:12:01.460, Speaker B: And then the risk and compliance team was basically told, hey guys, go play in your corner, basically. And that might have seemed like the right decision to make at the time, but you can probably trace an enormous amount of the strain when you're kind of looking at why were they willing to accept FTT of all things, as collateral. Kind of explains that story.
00:12:02.070 - 00:12:05.810, Speaker D: Not just FTT locked, FTT Unvested.
00:12:08.810 - 00:12:27.546, Speaker C: And GBTC that you literally cannot sell. Yeah, many such cases of this as well. It's not just like, I'm sure you guys felt this as well. Last peak of the bull market, it's pretty hard to maintain talent. People wanted a lot more. You were forced to negotiate with them. This year it's way different.
00:12:27.546 - 00:12:32.800, Speaker C: Everyone's suddenly very happy to have their job. But that's kind of how these things go.
00:12:34.050 - 00:13:28.330, Speaker D: I think the other thing that we've been thinking about, just like pulling back the timeline of everything that happened. There's so many examples of just like, bull market thinking versus what is rational and what makes sense in a sustainable ecosystem. And this is just another example, I think, of to your point, Mike, on variable compensation versus fixed compensation leading to less desirable collateral being posted. I think that's just like what happens when incentives run awry and when bull markets start to take over. And this model of we need to do everything, we need to move at the fastest speed possible, we need to keep charging ahead, and you just kind of get over your skis. And ultimately the ones that got further over their skis than others are the first to fall. We're still picking up the pieces of everyone who ultimately ended up getting too far over their skis.
00:13:28.330 - 00:13:42.402, Speaker D: Anybody who's left standing, I think, ultimately will have all the scar tissue to tell for it, and we're going to pick things back up and build back better. But it is just like classic bull market thinking, build back.
00:13:42.456 - 00:14:10.410, Speaker A: I think that always happens. Yeah, I think that happens in all bull markets. But this bull market specifically, it felt like there was a mentality that this was the last time to capture market share. That this was the time if you're a media company, this was the last time that it was only crypto media companies. All the other media companies are coming in. If you're an exchange or if you're like a VC, okay, it's no longer just crypto VCs. Now all the other web, two VCs are playing at the table.
00:14:10.410 - 00:14:22.270, Speaker A: What happened is it caused people to get way out ahead of their skis in terms of leverage, specifically. And you saw like, DCG took out that $575,000,000 loan. One was to buy back shares.
00:14:24.950 - 00:14:25.218, Speaker B: The.
00:14:25.224 - 00:14:43.510, Speaker A: Other was to make investments. Right? That is a gross misallocation of maturities, or misalignment of maturities. You're taking out short term debts to invest in long equity that doesn't pay back for like 510 years oftentimes.
00:14:44.090 - 00:15:12.814, Speaker D: I'm actually going to push back on that one. I think that Barry had the cash flows over the duration of that 575, let's call it 575 over. Probably got done 18 months from the maturity, if the maturity is in May of 2023. So what we're talking about is 18 months of cash flows flowing to DCG at this point this year. They're on pace to do 800 million of cash flows this year.
00:15:13.012 - 00:15:16.338, Speaker B: I saw revenue there probably relatively similar.
00:15:16.424 - 00:15:42.842, Speaker D: Okay, fine. Relatively similar. Like, how much does the whole pro have as cost? Right, but I think he was referring to DCG as on pace to do 800 million this year. Let's call that a 500,000,018 months. You can pay back 575, no problem. I actually think it was the 1.1 in liabilities that they took over from Genesis due to the Alameda or the Three Arrows situation in May of this year.
00:15:42.842 - 00:15:56.400, Speaker D: June of this year that really put them over. And I think the 575 was actually totally fine. They would have been able to pay that back with cash flows over the duration of that loan. It's just the 1.1. That was too much.
00:15:59.170 - 00:16:58.530, Speaker C: One thing that's interesting about and Yano, you made a really good point of like, this was the last cycle. This was like everyone needed to get to the table immediately or else you were going to be left out. One of the things about borrowing that's really interesting is that this was the first real cycle with large amounts of borrowing outside of just perps and exchange traded instruments. Genesis is I'm just looking at in Q One sorry, Q Four 2019, they issued $65 million of loans. In Q Four 2021, that was like 51 billion. And so cash lending against collateral did not exist prior to this cycle. And one lesson that I think we learned collectively is like, which collateral is good collateral? Where do you set margin calls? How do you sell liquid assets into a volatile market if things really start to go down? Because usually when you're getting margin called, things are not great around the industry.
00:16:58.530 - 00:17:12.870, Speaker C: And it was like this new concept and then suddenly got normalized and everyone was doing it and they were doing it against bad collateral and now it's kind of over. Voyager's out. Blockfly is out. Celsius is out.
00:17:12.940 - 00:17:16.290, Speaker A: Genesis is out the bitcoin. Miners are about to get hammered.
00:17:16.370 - 00:17:36.846, Speaker C: Yeah, miners about to get done. Crypto.com is out of lending. Blockchain.com is out of like, does this come back? How does it come back? One of the only places that you can get credit now is from Maple. They are still actively lending, but that's what it's going to look like. All of these centralized lenders, they had their one cycle and they kind of blew themselves out.
00:17:36.846 - 00:17:41.838, Speaker C: Now we kind of need to pick up the pieces and play some sort of new game to get credit back to the system.
00:17:42.004 - 00:17:47.454, Speaker D: That was actually going to be one of the questions that I asked. What do you think happens to Genesis now? And DCG.
00:17:47.502 - 00:17:48.420, Speaker C: For that matter.
00:17:50.470 - 00:18:38.898, Speaker B: I have heard again, there's a lot of rumors flying, right? So I just want to say a lot of this stuff is just stuff I've heard from folks who've entered these sorts of agreements, but it seems like there were two types of customers to Genesis. There were sort of the eight big whales, and I heard Tarun say this on the chopping block, which was many of them had non liquidation clauses. That's very problematic in and of itself. It seemed like if you weren't one of those eight to ten firms, they're pretty good about collateralization ratios. And my sense is that Genesis ends up getting bailed out in some way, shape or form. And once you cleave away the dead skin or whatever, there's probably some decently healthy book of loans. I think ultimately I think it ends up being just I don't know how much.
00:18:38.898 - 00:18:45.940, Speaker B: Maybe Barry doesn't own it. I'm frankly not sure why you'd want to be in that business. The prime brokerage business kind of sucks in general.
00:18:47.910 - 00:18:58.754, Speaker C: It's basically the same business as Falcon X. And Falcon X is like an $8 billion company. You can actually print cash if you're a good prime. There's not that many places don't mistake.
00:18:58.882 - 00:19:00.662, Speaker A: Their valuation with revenue, though.
00:19:00.796 - 00:19:02.002, Speaker C: Oh, totally, totally.
00:19:02.066 - 00:19:04.278, Speaker B: Wait, the observation I was actually going.
00:19:04.284 - 00:19:05.720, Speaker D: To check this kind of money.
00:19:06.250 - 00:19:24.706, Speaker B: I was going to say that you print cash for period of time and then there's almost always a gigantic loss that offsets that. You guys want to guess? There's a list that was getting passed around today. The largest trading losses. Do you want to guess what the largest trading loss of all time was? You guys will know.
00:19:24.728 - 00:19:32.066, Speaker C: What this masayoshi son in the think.
00:19:32.088 - 00:19:33.490, Speaker B: That was the largest wealth.
00:19:36.330 - 00:19:38.070, Speaker D: I'm just saying. Night Capital.
00:19:39.370 - 00:19:58.138, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good guess. It was actually, at least according to his Wikipedia page, bill Wang. And the nominal amount that was lost was $10 billion. Have you guys seen that? TikTok meme? And you can clearly see it the.
00:19:58.144 - 00:20:13.982, Speaker C: More you fuck around. Yeah, of course. Bill Wang ran that playbook. Yes, he did. And he was doing the same thing where he was posting. Because in TradFi, you don't actually have to roll up with tokens or shares. You can just tell people that you own them.
00:20:13.982 - 00:20:28.760, Speaker C: He was pledging them to multiple different primes, borrowing against them, borrowing cash against them, buying more shares, doing total return swaps. Tradfly still hasn't blown out this model. I think we're lucky to be moving past it, but.
00:20:32.250 - 00:20:44.330, Speaker D: Has run this playbook. By the way, this is subprime mortgages. It's just the subprime sludge that we're talking about here is FTT and SRM and GBTC for that matter.
00:20:44.480 - 00:20:45.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:46.990 - 00:21:17.494, Speaker C: Just to get back to what do we think happens with Genesis and DCG? And I think disclosures here are that DCG is an investor in framework. We haven't engaged with them in terms of trying to find out what exactly is going know. Like, my guess is that if I'm a know, just play it out. If this gets put into bankruptcy, that's not good for me. I don't see my assets for another year. Maybe the crypto market goes down. Maybe they have to sell.
00:21:17.494 - 00:21:45.194, Speaker C: Maybe I'm getting like fifty cents, sixty cents on the dollar versus maybe what's marked to market right now. It's like 80 or $0.90. If I'm a creditor. I'm basically trying to tell Barry like, hey, let's work something out. I know you don't have the cash right now. Sounds like it's just a timing issue. I'm not going to sue you, try to put you in a bankruptcy, but in like I just want to be paid back from the cash flows of grayscale from DCG, from things that are not just Genesis.
00:21:45.194 - 00:22:13.990, Speaker C: Because I think the dangerous part is if you're a creditor and this gets put into bankruptcy, you only potentially have access to the Genesis assets, which are likely not enough to make you entirely whole and you're not going to have that cash for a year. If this works its way through the courts, maybe you end up with a new owner who you have to negotiate with, who's like not a nice guy. I don't know. I think all the incentives are not to go into credit.
00:22:14.060 - 00:22:30.300, Speaker A: Let me ask you, if you were a creditor and someone put this deal on the table where you basically convert into senior preferred DCG debt or something like that, would you take that deal?
00:22:32.610 - 00:22:44.782, Speaker C: I think the deal is more so like give us six. Like we have the like we're not going to restructure the company, make you a shareholder, blah, blah blah. It's an IOU. Maybe it is like some sort of.
00:22:44.836 - 00:23:44.980, Speaker D: Senior structured so ryan Selkis I think is the one that put this out on Twitter, I think, yesterday, I think, and it's exactly how I was thinking about it, which is it's basically the Buffett Goldman situation in 2000, which is they had an ill liquidity issue. It wasn't an ill solvency issue. And what they needed to do was raise debt immediately. And raising debt immediately basically says there is no time to wait six months for creditors because Genesis goes into Chapter Eleven in like days to weeks if there isn't any resolution on all of this. So you have to raise the capital to be able to actually have withdrawals turn back on. Otherwise you're going to get sued into oblivion and creditors are going to be up your ass. But the way to do that I think, ultimately comes down to what do you give people for putting together this senior secured note? And it'll probably convertible and it'll probably include some warrant coverage of DCG itself.
00:23:44.980 - 00:24:16.606, Speaker D: Barry just bought back however much of that $575,000,000. There's plenty of cap table space to go around if you need to issue more shares. I think the other thing too is that it's actually pretty disastrous. We haven't seen the full ramifications of this. I think we started to see the tea leaves. It's actually pretty disastrous for DCG if Genesis goes under, just from a brand reputation perspective that I think has second order effects that are obviously hard to see from where we're standing right now. But I don't think you really kind of come back from that.
00:24:16.606 - 00:24:27.102, Speaker D: And so I think there's more incentive on the very side to get a deal done, which is probably why you haven't seen a deal done yet, which is he's moving slowly. But I think other people understand this dynamic.
00:24:27.246 - 00:24:52.794, Speaker C: The other thing to remember is that Genesis is for Accredited. I mean, it's not even for Accredited. It's for qualified purchasers only. My guess of how many clients they have hundreds, few hundred. It's not a million creditor situation where you're trying to like, okay, they're suing me. This class action, blah, blah, blah. It's more so like, all right, my people, I'm sorry, let me pay you back.
00:24:52.794 - 00:24:59.290, Speaker C: It's going to take some time. It's more manageable, I would say, than the FTX blowout.
00:24:59.950 - 00:25:16.522, Speaker A: Michael going back to the Buffett Goldman thing. Okay, so you convert it. You get this basically like senior secured. No, you got some warrants in the deal or something like the if you're making the analogy to the Buffett Goldman thing, who's the buffett here? Who ends up being the Buffett?
00:25:16.586 - 00:25:21.966, Speaker D: I don't think it's a single I mean, you saw CZ say, not interested due to conflict.
00:25:22.078 - 00:25:23.700, Speaker A: Finance is not going to do it.
00:25:24.950 - 00:25:37.014, Speaker C: I disagree with this take. It's not going to be a buffet. It's just going to be Barry. And like, they don't need to be rescued. That was the entire tone of that letter. He was like, thank you. We're not raising money.
00:25:37.014 - 00:25:39.560, Speaker C: I'll let you know when we these.
00:25:43.790 - 00:25:47.146, Speaker A: Say if I need to raise money right now, I'm not going, I need to raise money.
00:25:47.168 - 00:25:48.982, Speaker C: I'm saying the point of Barry's letter.
00:25:49.046 - 00:25:54.140, Speaker A: Fine, we'll open up a small round for some people. That's how you raise the money.
00:25:55.010 - 00:25:56.640, Speaker C: Friends and family only.
00:25:58.290 - 00:26:01.246, Speaker A: Exclusive deal. Yeah, come on.
00:26:01.348 - 00:26:13.490, Speaker C: Letter. Which is like the most important thing. I think that we should be reading into his position is, I have the money. Not right now, but give me a few months, I'll have the money, I can pay you back.
00:26:13.560 - 00:26:14.530, Speaker B: Trust me, bro.
00:26:14.680 - 00:26:20.098, Speaker C: There's this loan that's due. I'm going to pay that back. Maybe that fills the hole. That's his perspective.
00:26:20.274 - 00:26:33.254, Speaker D: Totally. But you can't just sit there and have non withdrawals on a lending platform and not expect for either there to be lawsuits or a desire or necessity to move into Chapter Eleven restructuring.
00:26:33.382 - 00:26:40.442, Speaker C: If you work with creditors, I don't think you actually need to. That's my plan. If I'm him. That's what I'm saying.
00:26:40.576 - 00:26:47.550, Speaker A: What does that mean? To work with creditors, though? Like, to be like, all right, guys, sorry this didn't work out. You're going to get $0.70 on the dollar.
00:26:47.890 - 00:26:50.526, Speaker C: Option A is I put Genesis into.
00:26:50.548 - 00:26:53.358, Speaker A: Bankruptcy and you can fight it out.
00:26:53.444 - 00:27:21.470, Speaker C: In the court and you don't get access to DCG assets. So you want to go do that, go have fun. That's not going to be that much fun for you. Option B is work with me, give me some time. There's a cash flow producing business. I can slowly fill this hole and pay you back and I can pay you back probably sooner than when it would come out of the courts. But what that requires is us to have some sort of understanding where you're not forcing me to do anything, where I put the company into bankruptcy.
00:27:21.470 - 00:27:29.580, Speaker C: Can he actually do that? Is more of like a legal question. But that would be how I would present the situation.
00:27:30.430 - 00:28:39.314, Speaker D: But there's also Option C, which I think is what's been floated around at least on Twitter more so, which is go and raise at the parent company, senior secured convertible notes, have that money flow back into Genesis and basically everything turns back on and illiquidity is no longer an issue. And the reason why I skew towards that, I think, is and maybe there's other factors, obviously, that we don't know and we don't have any information on this, but generally, I think if you have even $0.70 on the dollar or even $0.80 on the dollar, how many of those hundreds of customers are coming back? Or they're going to be trusting in Genesis or they're going to be trusting in DCG going forward? The reputational hazard here I think is actually a really kind of major issue for DCG writ large because what do they have going forward if it's not Genesis and maybe Genesis and the loan book and the lending genesis Capital versus their derivatives business and their prime business. But nobody is using Genesis going forward if they even give $0.99 back on the dollar. So I think there is irreparable damage that can be done with option A.
00:28:39.352 - 00:28:47.234, Speaker C: Or B. Genesis is a zero. I don't think it's coming a little.
00:28:47.352 - 00:29:07.302, Speaker B: I would question that. Michael as what? Why do you say that? Because it's kind of easy for me to close my eyes and envision a world where, hey, Genesis didn't really work out. But I think the brands of Grayscale and CoinDesk and Founder relatively separate. I don't understand why those businesses couldn't just exist and keep flowing cash into DCG.
00:29:07.446 - 00:29:30.238, Speaker D: So Genesis has three different businesses. Obviously the lending portion of it is the largest portion and I think it's called Genesis Capital. There's Genesis Derivatives and then there's prime. Prime Brokerage, as we just discussed. There is a potential for prime and derivatives. They are registered in the US with the CFTC. They have a bit like they have all the banking relationships.
00:29:30.238 - 00:29:58.298, Speaker D: There is actual value to that business. It's just that the loan origination business has been their prime business for the last X number of think. I agree. I think Genesis, the lending side is done and not coming back. But if the entire business goes out. Then you lose a massive opportunity to once again build the Berkshire Hathaway of crypto. And it's not coming back if you don't give customers back 100%.
00:29:58.298 - 00:30:10.970, Speaker D: And so I'm saying, if you want to have the prime and you want to have the derivatives business, at least have a fighting chance at having any opportunity of becoming a scalable business. Yeah, you have to rethink the entire structure.
00:30:11.130 - 00:30:55.002, Speaker C: I know people who are still trading through Genesis derivatives. I think the trades are clearing in a different manner, but that business is very much intact. You have to remember, Genesis has the Bit license, like the whole New York squad, the Tradfibros, who unfortunately bought the absolute top of that's, that's where they transact, that's where most of our New York friends and know, that's where they do business. And those are not the type of people that take gated withdrawals lightly. But I also think that the two businesses are very separate. And if you're just trading through the prime, you're probably not that impacted, but you're a little spooked in terms of getting your coins back as soon as things settle.
00:30:55.146 - 00:31:02.718, Speaker D: And this is my point, there is a survivable business with Genesis going forward, even if the lending side of the business goes away.
00:31:02.884 - 00:31:18.470, Speaker B: Yes. Undetermined, we'll have to see how it all plays out. Fun fact about GBTC, by the way, is that 2% fee is based on the NAV, not where it's currently trading. So if you bought GBTC, you're basically paying them 5%. What a sham management fee?
00:31:18.970 - 00:31:43.450, Speaker C: Let me tell you, the most down bad people on the planet. I would love to hear the people who bought $64,000 Bitcoin at a 40% premium. That's a $90,000 bitcoin. And now it's a $15,000 mark to market Bitcoin with a 50% discount. So that's seven and a half $1,000 Yano.
00:31:48.050 - 00:31:50.894, Speaker D: And they're paying 5% a year just to hold on to that.
00:31:51.012 - 00:31:57.794, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. That is like a 95% loss right there.
00:31:57.992 - 00:32:03.540, Speaker B: Yeah, well, my heart goes out to you if that's your situation.
00:32:04.950 - 00:32:10.630, Speaker C: And we don't even need to talk about the ETH people, those people. Shadowlands.
00:32:11.210 - 00:32:12.790, Speaker D: Absolute shadowlands.
00:32:13.450 - 00:32:16.710, Speaker A: I think my uncle pulled that trade. Poor uncle.
00:32:17.710 - 00:32:19.354, Speaker B: Your uncle's doing fine.
00:32:19.552 - 00:32:27.210, Speaker C: Give me a good Thanksgiving for you. I'm sorry about that.
00:32:27.360 - 00:33:15.020, Speaker B: We've got a big six and a half pound turkey this year. We're going to have to split it across. All family. Going to have to make it all last. One other thing that I think might be interesting to point out about Genesis and a lot of the CFI lenders in general, is let's back up. I think one of the differences in between this cycle and 2017 2018, and why this particular sell off has felt so much more violent is, in 2017, you basically saw the collapse of ICOs, and that sucked, but it was relatively contained and a lot of people you knew there was some good stuff in there, but probably if you had your Pragmatic hat on? This is my pragmatic hat. You knew that stuff was going down.
00:33:15.020 - 00:34:20.510, Speaker B: But I think the difference in between this cycle and that cycle is there was a lot of stuff that turned out to be vaporware or highly overvalued, and there was a more sophisticated market structure that allowed you to take leverage out on that. So now we're looking at more cascading leverage on this downdraft. But I also think you found a group of people, SBF being one of them, and mainstream media has not tackled this side of what he was trying to do super effectively was this game of low know, these very low float tokens. And Matt Levine wrote something a little while ago when he was breaking down the Mango hack, and he was describing this idea that it's impossible. Pump and dump should be technically impossible because if you have something that's low float and you pump the price when you go to take profits and sell it because it's low float, the price should go back down just as easily as it went up. So instead, what you really should be hoping to do is you should make an asset low float, you should pump the price way up, and then you should take out a loan when it's at the top. And that largely is the game that SBF was playing.
00:34:20.510 - 00:34:43.190, Speaker B: And I think there are some other players in the ecosystem that figured that out, too. And these lending desks. Jason, I love that analogy you made, man. I think you hit the nail on the head. Everyone felt like this is the end and there's never going to be another time to get market share. I think that's their sort of falling prey to these low float, taking out loan games that people are playing in the ecosystem.
00:34:44.170 - 00:35:16.740, Speaker C: If you understand how a project like Serum was run, you would never, ever take that as collateral. And what's kind of interesting is michael and I are not finance people. We studied business and econometrics in school, but we don't have 20 years of institutional finance. All the Genesis people did and all the other lending desks did, but these people made very basic mistakes of not doing the correct amount of work when you're underwriting financing. It's kind of on them. I feel badly, but Jesus Christ.
00:35:17.990 - 00:35:27.410, Speaker D: No, it's not on them. I mean, they didn't make mistakes. I think they were complicit and they knew exactly what they were doing the entire time. I think that this was premeditated.
00:35:29.270 - 00:35:32.902, Speaker C: No. From the death. Maybe they were incentivized, but it's not like pre.
00:35:32.956 - 00:35:34.786, Speaker A: What do you mean is premeditated self murder?
00:35:34.978 - 00:35:38.782, Speaker D: Oh, no, I don't mean the deaths. I mean the people who created these ecosystems.
00:35:38.866 - 00:35:57.982, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, those people, definitely. But the people who were underwriting that. Come on, you really didn't know that you couldn't go to Coin Market Cap and see that the float was 1% of the total market cap that made sense to you to take as collateral? It was locked and it's still vesting. Come on.
00:35:58.036 - 00:36:02.730, Speaker B: The locked FTT is I got to be honest, that one blows my mind. I don't understand how that ever got.
00:36:02.820 - 00:36:04.382, Speaker A: They did a similar thing on UST.
00:36:04.446 - 00:36:08.580, Speaker C: Don't worry. We're hedging it. We're hedging it? Yeah. How?
00:36:09.190 - 00:36:09.842, Speaker B: With what?
00:36:09.896 - 00:36:10.354, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:10.472 - 00:36:11.570, Speaker B: What instrument?
00:36:13.990 - 00:36:19.140, Speaker A: Someone tweeted like, this was the beginning of the end, and they showed Genesis doing like a billion dollar deal.
00:36:19.510 - 00:36:20.930, Speaker C: That was the swap.
00:36:23.050 - 00:36:27.080, Speaker A: And then Doe was like, correct. This was the beginning of the end, or something.
00:36:28.430 - 00:36:45.260, Speaker C: To be clear, I told Dan CMS Holdings about that right before he tweeted it. So I want my alpha attributed to me. But yeah, I mean, it's like the scorpion and the like it was just bound to.
00:36:49.230 - 00:37:38.922, Speaker B: Yeah, it seems a little also, I think it really just does come back to incentives because in my heart of hearts, you had the people that were making those decisions and what to accept as collateral. I wonder how many of them were thinking about the long term health of the business or if they were just looking at this crazy commission check that they were going to print and not necessarily carrying overly much. All right, everyone, quick break from this episode to talk about our show sponsors, Avalanche. Many of you know Avalanche as the fast, reliable, and scalable layer one. The folks at Avalanche have a really great message for those of you who are in the crypto industry right now, which is bear markets are for building. So while a bunch of our friends over in CFI are kind of going through these struggles and travails, the folks at Avalanche have basically put their heads down and are shipping products that builders want. The latest solution.
00:37:38.922 - 00:37:40.202, Speaker B: Elastic subnets.
00:37:40.266 - 00:37:51.746, Speaker A: Right. And just to expand on that, avalanche is consistently upgrading all of their platforms. Right. So on the platform side, you've got Elastic Subnets, you've got New VMs. On the infrastructure side of things, you've got Core, which Mike, I know you.
00:37:51.768 - 00:37:53.858, Speaker B: Used that the other day. I was a bridge or I was.
00:37:53.864 - 00:38:03.442, Speaker A: A bridge or yeah, exactly. So they're upgrading the infrastructure side with Core and Enclave, the chain has had, like, no downtime super customizable for devs.
00:38:03.586 - 00:38:04.738, Speaker B: Yeah, if you're a builder.
00:38:04.834 - 00:38:08.550, Speaker A: AVAX Network. AVAX Network, great place to be.
00:38:08.620 - 00:38:12.786, Speaker B: But do Yano and I as well. So you definitely go check him out. But click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:38:12.818 - 00:38:13.382, Speaker A: Click the link.
00:38:13.436 - 00:38:17.430, Speaker B: Otherwise you're not going to get any credit. Come on, click the link at the bottom. Give us the credit.
00:38:17.500 - 00:38:24.638, Speaker A: Exactly. So, yeah, big thanks to Avalanche. Yeah, you just had a great experience with them the other day on the user side of things.
00:38:24.804 - 00:39:01.906, Speaker B: Go check them out. Guys, thank us later. Let's get back to the show. I heard Hasu say something in an episode a little while ago. There's an episode of I Pledge allegiance, which I always plug, but it's great podcast. And there was this Larry Sockernick, one of the founders at Reverie, posed this question, and it's only in web two as well, which is, are you at the mercy of your stupidest competitor? In many ways, I think Blockfly was kind of at the mercy of their stupidest competitor in the form of celsius, and I think it's very tempting to think that way. And Hasu's response was, no, I understand why you think that way, but one of the actual benefits of crypto is you get these washouts in these cycles.
00:39:01.906 - 00:39:29.810, Speaker B: And when I first I first listened to this about twelve months ago, and I thought, no, I'm totally on Larry's side here. You are at the whim of your stupidest competitor. But now with everything that's happened, I'm kind of on Hasu side here. I think you could look at it as a huge benefit that you have these culling waves of everyone who's making bad decisions. You might have to sit through two years of agony and watch them get all this market share and all this stuff, but I mean, look at these invincible companies that have been brought to their knees.
00:39:30.950 - 00:39:45.878, Speaker C: I'm pretty pissed that our stupidest competitors nuked the space like 90%. I wouldn't say that we got off scot free. The wash was definitely like the feature, but the bug was these people blowing the industry up. We're getting pretty close.
00:39:46.044 - 00:40:11.038, Speaker B: But I have a question to both you guys. As founders of a VC fund and as Jason and I as founders, do you view it as sort of an advantage, though, that maybe there were these funds that were winning deals s that are now no longer around? Are you guys are going to be able to say, hey, we were here during the bear market, we've lasted multiple cycles. Do you view this as good for your relative market share? I don't know if I was taking money from someone.
00:40:11.124 - 00:40:56.990, Speaker D: What I was literally about to say is, well, there's two things. One, I'll get to your question in a second, but it's now non consensus to be bullish. Just like a year ago, literally this week, it was absolutely non consensus to be bearish. And I think ultimately the non consensus view over whatever period of time it takes for this whole thing to wash out, ultimately that is the right perspective to have in crypto. And I think ten out of ten, you would be right over certain durations, let's call them like six to nine months. So right now, I think this is one of the most bullish things to have this wash out. It's just like getting rid of all of those ICO treasuries with ETH and BTC, getting locked up and docked and every single cycle before it, before this one.
00:40:56.990 - 00:41:49.040, Speaker D: So I think this is one of the healthiest. And obviously we have friends and we have peers that lost a ton of money lost a ton of capital in this process and Framework lost value in investments that we've made, but doesn't really faze us, doesn't really change any perspective. To your second question. We literally had a conversation yesterday with a portfolio or with a potential portfolio company who we've been talking about investing in and leading the round. The number one other firm that they were talking to was FDX, and obviously that conversation isn't going anywhere anymore. But removing chips from the table leaves the last couple of people standing and it just makes the whole place healthier. And I'm like exceedingly bullish right now, but it's going to be probably a couple of months of downward, sideways, whatever.
00:41:49.040 - 00:42:25.100, Speaker D: But ultimately I think we're going to find a new thing to latch onto. And the other thing too is I think regulatory wise, we're actually going to have some push in a positive direction. I don't know if you guys saw Tom Emmer going on Fox Business yesterday, pushing the narrative of this was not decentralization, this was not the crypto industry, this was one person in an unregulated centralized finance operation. This is why we need positive regulation. I think that narrative is starting to pick up as well. The pieces are starting to get put back together. So I'm actually really excited right now.
00:42:26.590 - 00:42:38.480, Speaker C: Framework is incredibly hard to kill as well. We just managed to not go for the poison fruit every cycle and I think that's one of the things about us which keeps us around.
00:42:39.570 - 00:43:19.658, Speaker B: I would have to agree. I don't know I'll speak from but Jason, I think if we were sitting around having discussions about taking money, I think that would be a big part of it know? How did you act during this last bull cycle? How long have you been around? I feel like just the longer michael, you've got a guest. Want to get him on the mic? What's up? Michael Senior? Yeah, I just think the longer you've been around, the more advantageous it is. I want to switch a little bit and talk about bitcoin miners. This is something that we've discussed in the past a bit, but it seems like the stress has continued there. And I agree a lot with you, Michael. Actually, we've got our newsletter writer out this week.
00:43:19.658 - 00:43:52.694, Speaker B: So I wrote a whole newsletter yesterday about how the time to be bearish was basically a year ago and it's non consensus, but right now is kind of the time you should be thinking about feeling bullish. And it is just interesting to see. We've seen mining capitulation really pick up in the last just three weeks or so and that has historically been the bottom. Right around the bottom is when the miners ultimately capitulate. And I'd just be curious, I don't know if there's anything really new that you guys have that you want to talk about there or anything that we haven't covered in the past. I don't know I'm just making observations here.
00:43:52.812 - 00:44:40.994, Speaker C: Main thing is, like the overlay of 2018 and present day, it's like one to one, we had that big nuke in January 2018, hang in around there around six k for like six or nine months. And then in November or December, just the bottom fell out. And this was a time when bitcoin was literally everything, and it nuked to three k. And that was driven by a minor capitulation. And it looks like the same thing is happening right now. ETH has still not made a new low, but bitcoin is making fresh lows, I think this week and last week as mean. Bitcoin mining is an interesting business because it kind of appeals to the same types of people who flip airbnbs and do kind of like these dumb real estate schemes.
00:44:40.994 - 00:45:13.280, Speaker C: Bitcoin mining feels like real estate. You have this thing, you build it, it's physical, you can look at it, you can see it, you can build better technology marginally, but it's mostly the same asset. It produces cash flows, but at a certain level, you go underwater. And I think of the bitcoin mining teams that we've seen relative to the other technology teams in the space, just the level of talent is far, far lower. And so you're seeing a lot of capitulation, you're seeing a lot of consolidation as well now. Foundry, the DCG miner, is the biggest bitcoin miner in the world. That did not used to be the case.
00:45:13.280 - 00:45:57.470, Speaker C: I think it's going to be a really weird time for bitcoin over the next few years. Like, I've made this public on twitter, but when you have the market leading asset, the market beta asset, the one that everyone build algos around and correlates around, but it's also the heaviest asset in terms of it's 1.7% inflation per year. At these prices, that's about five or 6 billion. The market's just going to trade heavy, and I don't think that's sustainable at all. And assets with better structural demand and supply dynamics are going to take their place. And so, I don't know, maybe we've seen the final cycle where bitcoin actually leads and kind of the happenings are important because it just feels like bitcoin is narrativeless at the moment.
00:45:57.470 - 00:46:10.290, Speaker C: You have Michael saylor, who's like the only super cycler that's still around, shilling stuff, but other than that, I don't know what they can do. It seems like the best thing that they could have is like another psychopath to start buying, but unclear.
00:46:11.430 - 00:46:52.058, Speaker B: I would take the other side on that, actually. Okay, yeah, I would take the other sort of I think one of the driving forces of bitcoin overall, bitcoin has changed its narrative over the years. We all sort of know that, right? It started out as this digital peer to peer cash, right? And then payments were a big thing, and then it was an inflation hedge, and now it's a store of value, kind of a digital gold. And a lot of people point to that as a weakness of bitcoin. I sort of just view it as this thing that's very hard to change. It's like a real source of it's pristine collateral, whatever it is, it's something that you'd want to ideally own. I still do think the macro macro mike here, but I think the macro forces, they do support bitcoin.
00:46:52.058 - 00:47:49.774, Speaker B: I do think if you zoom out of our little industry, we're talking about all this carnage that's going on in crypto, the same level of carnage is going on in TradFi in the real world as well. And as much as it's felt like a crescendo here over the last four weeks, I think we're about to see it play out on the bigger stage in the American economy and global economy all over. And the biggest problem there is just how much debt we have and how much money we've printed. And I think there's a lot of value to the whole thing that everyone criticizes bitcoin for, which is these people are frustrating, right? They get in your face, they just say the same thing, they just repeat the same lines. But there's this very just hardcore group and community, and if I had to make a prediction about what the next narrative is going to be in bitcoin, it's censorship, resistance and I don't know, I think it has a good. It's got this political, very simple, easy to understand marketing, but I think is going to continue to be relevant for a long period of time. I don't have an opinion really necessarily on how that plays out compared to ETH.
00:47:49.774 - 00:47:54.820, Speaker B: I think ETH will win on other dimensions, but I don't know. I would take the other side of it.
00:47:57.130 - 00:48:25.146, Speaker A: I would take the side. The one sentence thesis for bitcoin in my mind is bitcoin's success is inversely correlated with central bank's credibility. And it seems like the credibility of central banks is going down. And when you want to make that trade, or when you want to take the other side of the central bank trade, central banker trade, it's like bitcoin is the obvious investment in my mind. Maybe not the obvious investment is the simplest counter trade.
00:48:25.338 - 00:48:33.390, Speaker D: When would you say the highest over the past five years. When would you say is the highest level of distrust in central bankers?
00:48:34.370 - 00:48:36.434, Speaker A: Well, I think when is the highest level?
00:48:36.552 - 00:48:36.930, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:37.000 - 00:48:40.062, Speaker D: Over the last five years. When was the highest peak?
00:48:40.126 - 00:48:40.738, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:40.904 - 00:48:42.626, Speaker B: Probably when inflation is at a right.
00:48:42.648 - 00:48:49.640, Speaker A: Now, like a month ago. Yeah, I see where you're going with this. And then bitcoin is low right now.
00:48:50.570 - 00:49:37.874, Speaker C: I kind of see it's all kind of like one big trade in a way. Bitcoin's properties are not going to make it like the fastest horse when rates turn around or peak. It's going to be just kind of like everything that's super interest rate sensitive is going to move violently and obviously I'm not a macro person in terms of my day job, but one of the things that I've been looking for this cycle is when is the tenure going to peak? When did it peak? In 2018. The tenure peaked in October, mid October, maybe, might have been November. And that was right around when the bitcoin minor capitulation happened. So you had rates reaching their highest. You had interest rate sensitive assets going down the most.
00:49:37.874 - 00:50:23.278, Speaker C: You had the bitcoin capitulation that happened, and then the Fed pivoted in, I think January, February, and that was actually when marked the lows of the stock market. And so the things that you really need to watch for are when are rates peaking? Ten years specifically, and then when is the Fed pausing or reconsidering? And in 2018, we didn't have as much visibility in terms of where rates were going to go as we do right now in present day. So the peak in the tenure happened, it looks like it peaked at about 4.25. It's down to about 3.76. I'm not like predicting the return of free money or anything like that. I'm predicting the return of cheap money, two to three and a half percent tenure. And that's like one of the things where you look back and you say, okay, cool, rates peaked.
00:50:23.278 - 00:50:52.630, Speaker C: That gives people more confidence in terms of interest rate sensitive assets, that you're not just going to get wrecked by rates going up, maybe you'll get wrecked by other things, but you can kind of take that variable off the table. And so you do have this constructive backdrop that's starting to form. And a lot of people are saying that deflation is now coming. We got the good October print. Maybe it happens in December again. Maybe December is the last hike, maybe January is the last hike, we don't know. But you're starting to build this framework around, things are going to get better, and I think that's the most important thing right now.
00:50:52.800 - 00:51:37.094, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say the narrative of bitcoin over the last eleven years of its time. Our friend Tom Lee at Funstrat is the one who's purported this is it's just a risk asset. It is viewed upon as being a risk asset, potentially an index on this entire industry. For some people, maybe for some people it was an inflation hedge for a period of time. But I think the direct correlation over the last 15 months of bitcoin price with interest rate and an inverse relationship to that point, to Vance's point, is probably the driving narrative over this next cycle. Let's call it over the next three, maybe four years, and as rates start to peak, asset values start to go up. Bitcoin becomes one of those risk assets that takes advantage of that trajectory.
00:51:37.094 - 00:52:27.740, Speaker D: But I think going back to it, Mike, all the things that you said about bitcoin could also be applied to ETH, could also be applied to other assets in the ecosystem could also be applied to, just like generally the crypto market writ large if you have sufficient decentralization. And these assets are viewed as the anti central bank or the inflation hedge or just frankly, the index on this industry. So I think it's not just bitcoin, but it's actually everything in the space. The question is the relative weighting of the monetary premium that you get relative to the other assets in the space. And that's where I think we're going to start to see a lot of change. My base case is that the next cycle is probably going to see something and I don't know which asset, but I have my best placed. There will probably be an asset that displaces number one.
00:52:28.510 - 00:52:30.182, Speaker A: I wonder which one you're talking about.
00:52:30.256 - 00:52:30.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:32.370 - 00:52:34.746, Speaker C: Last little macro, you were FUDding serum.
00:52:34.778 - 00:52:36.990, Speaker B: So you could accumulate your bags, right?
00:52:37.140 - 00:53:07.746, Speaker C: We passed on serum and FTT. So one thing I didn't know when I was like 2017, punting coins from Michael's basement is just like how macro works and how all the different asset classes work. And you don't need to know it in depth, you just need to know the basics. Bonds get bid first. Institutional allocators are just not going to let yields rise to like 20, 30%. You're seeing coinbase bonds trade at like $0.50 for the dollar, which is like 15% yield.
00:53:07.746 - 00:53:26.266, Speaker C: That's kind of as high as that's going to go. Those get bid first, then equities get bid. You can see that the S and P is up relative to where crypto is. Crypto is basically near the bottom. There's just like more value there in terms of free cash flow. People feel more comfortable about it. You have institutional allocators that have to buy at certain levels.
00:53:26.266 - 00:53:46.366, Speaker C: Then that gets bid and then crypto gets bid. It's the furthest out on the risk curve. It's the most speculative, it's the most reliant on retail, which is the most leverage of the cycle. And so you're starting to see it. Bonds got bid. The S and P is over four K today. I don't know.
00:53:46.488 - 00:53:47.334, Speaker B: I hear you.
00:53:47.452 - 00:53:48.360, Speaker C: It's interesting.
00:53:50.570 - 00:54:22.638, Speaker B: It could be start stop. Right. Usually when there's inflation, it's very unlikely. The two big periods of time that people look at in the United States where there was inflation, the 1940s and the 1960s and 70s, there was this stop start inflation, where it was a little bit what you were describing, Vince, which is kind of, hey, look, it looks like we've broken the back of inflation. It's really turned around in many, many cases, at least in the 70s, it went all the way back down to 3% headline or something like that before it rocketed back up. And you do need to squash this impulse of inflation. This is the tricky part that's totally hard to model.
00:54:22.638 - 00:55:04.320, Speaker B: There's expectations around inflation. And in my heart of hearts, I guess the way that I ask myself this and this is kind of the way I think about are we at the bottom in crypto? Is I ask myself, what would people say if the market went up 50% tomorrow? Not tomorrow, over the course of the next month? Would people say it's bull market, it's back? And if so, we probably haven't reached the bottom yet because in 2020 we went from 4000 bitcoin when it puked in March of 2020 all the way up to like 16 before people started to say, hey, maybe the bull market might be back on. And I think that just speaks to the that's how much hope you need to extract from the market before you sort of know that you've really deeply reached the bottom.
00:55:05.090 - 00:55:35.222, Speaker C: Yes, but no. So to your last point, there's this moral responsibility for things not to go up. Allegedly. Same thing happened with COVID How is crypto going up? There's a global pandemic. This is so wrong. How could you guys be doing this? Number go up because risk assets are getting bid, because interest rates are turning around in a different direction. Also the was 15 years of structural inflation that was like a different thing.
00:55:35.222 - 00:56:03.594, Speaker C: You had gas prices that went up ten X, not two X. Maybe we just had an inflation burp over the past year. Maybe Team Transitory was right but got the timing wrong. And if you really think that if your framework for we're not at the bottom yet is that inflation is bad and that we're going to have to jack rates to like 6%, you're just betting against all of the deflation that you see in the market today. And I know Jim Bianco gets out there kind of on a limb and is like, the inflation is not over, blah, blah, blah.
00:56:03.642 - 00:56:05.386, Speaker B: I love Jim and I love Jim.
00:56:05.418 - 00:56:06.074, Speaker C: And he's super smart.
00:56:06.122 - 00:56:07.534, Speaker D: I love that he supports crypto, man.
00:56:07.572 - 00:56:41.850, Speaker C: But you dig into his rationale and it all just seems know, it just seems like he's pissed at all these people for making money in assets that he doesn't agree with. And so one of the things that we do is you can watch people on Twitter, you can see when they're really hot. Jim Bianco was so hot for the first six months of this year, and I absolutely hated it because I disagreed with him. But then you can kind of see when their tactical arguments start to fall apart and you can kind of fade them. I think that's what's going on with a lot of the people who became very famous macro newsletter people, bearish people. I don't know if their time in the sun is going to last that much longer.
00:56:41.920 - 00:57:15.154, Speaker D: And on the reciprocal end of that, I would say you had a lot of people, unfortunately, like Tom Lee, who looked terrible for the first six months of this year, who are now starting to fade back in, and a lot of the data points that. They've been tracking are now starting to come real. One of the really interesting points, just as like an example here. So month over month, core CPI is the metric to track. Right? That's what everybody's looking for in terms of when the Fed has hit the numbers that they want. And 2% is supposed to be the rate at which everything is fine and dandy.
00:57:15.202 - 00:57:15.654, Speaker C: Right?
00:57:15.772 - 00:57:45.198, Speaker D: Well, this last print, and yes, it's one data point one's a data .2 is a trend, three is a pattern. But what you have is zero point 27%. And it's really interesting. But what happens when you have the month over month is that they only take the decimals place, the tenths one decimal place, and round up. And then that multiplied by twelve is the annualized rate of what this one print represents. Well, 00:27 rounds to 3.3,
00:57:45.198 - 00:57:57.906, Speaker D: and then you multiply that by twelve and you're at 3.6%. What happens if it was three basis points lower at 00:24 and then you round down to zero two and you're at 2.4%? We've hit our target.
00:57:58.018 - 00:57:59.080, Speaker C: We did it.
00:58:00.490 - 00:58:16.918, Speaker B: Mission accomplished. Right? Mission accomplished. Speech. It's hard to know. I mean, it's really difficult to forecast this stuff in general. I want to return really briefly to what one of the points Michael actually, Michael advanced. I can't remember which one we're making this point about just the monetary premium.
00:58:16.918 - 00:58:41.966, Speaker B: First of all, I hope I've been consistent in talking about this on different podcasts. It would be very easy. I respect what's going on in Bitcoin. I will say it's probably the more it moves into this very hardcore sort of libertarian bent, that's not how I am as a person. So it's very much easier for me to kind of look at the ETH community and that Ethos. And that just more aligns with who I am as a person. So if you made me pick build on Bitcoin or ETH, I wouldn't even have to think about it for a second.
00:58:41.966 - 00:59:09.962, Speaker B: But I do respect what's going on in Bitcoin. I've always personally liked in the same way I never liked the DeFi on Bitcoin argument. Why can't you just let it be this beautiful thing? Why can't you just let it be this store of value? Why does all this stuff have to be built on top? It doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense to me. That's how I sort of feel about this monetary aspect to ETH. I view ETH as this great I don't know. There's no perfect analog, right? Oil, data, whatever it is, it's block space that you're selling. I don't understand.
00:59:09.962 - 00:59:32.686, Speaker B: I think the monetary premium thing for me, complicates it, whereas it should be optimized for selling block space to other protocols and just making the best of that. Basically, if it were up to me, maybe this my smooth brain take here, but I like things to just be simple. And bitcoin is the money. E sells the block space and I think they can both be super successful.
00:59:32.878 - 01:00:07.386, Speaker C: So to your first question, why can't Bitcoin just be left alone? Because it doesn't generate any fees. If it doesn't generate any fees, the security model is invalid. If the security model is invalid, not only can it not be money, it can't really be anything, it's just going to get hacked. So that's the first thing. And I think there is some sort of path where it's used only as money by enough people and it generates enough fees where it can generate the security and the fees, but it just is not playing out yet. And it's one of the most owned assets in America at this point. 70 million people in the US own crypto.
01:00:07.386 - 01:00:43.594, Speaker C: If it's not getting there at this point, I don't think the path is that bullish. Ethereum and my framework for anything that becomes money is it has to be sustainable. Money needs to be sustainable, it needs to have cash flows, it needs to be net deflationary probably. It needs to be yield bearing. And Ethereum is an asset that is used to secure the network, it's used to pay gas fees. That's the primary use case. The fact that it's used in DeFi as collateral, that all NFTs are priced in ETH, that people are actually staking it in some sort of internet bond to earn yield, that means that it has a better chance of being money.
01:00:43.594 - 01:01:22.018, Speaker C: And how I think about the monetary premium in the space is there is a set amount of monetary premium, I don't know what it is, maybe it's 500 billion and it's divided up amongst the assets that exist in the space from number one, bitcoin to the 100th page of coin market cap the really bad coins. But the monetary premium is distributed on a powerwall basis. So bitcoin probably gets 99% of that or 80 or 90% of it. ETH probably gets 20% of it. The next asset probably gets 5% of it. This is excluding stablecoins, by the way. But in our view, the monetary premium is binary.
01:01:22.018 - 01:02:07.926, Speaker C: If the monetary premium is distributed on this power law, if the second largest asset flips the biggest asset, it immediately takes all of that monetary premium for itself. And so why do we like Ethereum? Well, number one, it has the most applications, it has the most usage, it has the most users, it's used the most as money. But its use case as money expands its total addressable market from probably 500 billion to ten to 20 trillion. That's the thing that Ethereum needs to do better as an asset. And its holders, all the Bitcoin people are aiming for 13 trillion. They want to be the size of gold because they think they just have some right to it, whatever. But Ethereum actually has a more credible path to going there.
01:02:07.926 - 01:02:22.826, Speaker C: And if you think Ethereum has the chance to unseat gold as the canonical digital store, of value for this generation. It's an attractive, interesting asset. Do you think it has a better.
01:02:22.848 - 01:02:28.780, Speaker A: Chance of going there because you're worried about bitcoin security model and you think the bitcoin security model breaks down?
01:02:30.510 - 01:02:59.170, Speaker C: So the reason I think it gets there is a couple of things. Number one, the flows for Ethereum. If you look at all the OTC desk color we get, ethereum is crossing the desk more than bitcoin at this point. It's as liquid as bitcoin. When you try to put in size or take out size, the positioning would suggest that Ethereum actually is actually favored at this point by institutional allocators. So that's the first thing. The second thing is Ethereum is very light as an asset.
01:02:59.170 - 01:03:31.200, Speaker C: Bitcoin is extraordinarily heavy. It has miner selling. It has all of these assets that receives ralzicon's bitcoin. The Atlanta guys bitcoin, all the bitcoin from Celsius, Voyager BlockFi, whatever that's going to be a headwind. And so when I think about the space and Ethereum's potential trajectory, it's kind of conditional. If it flips bitcoin at a low price point, that upsets the entire path that the space could take entirely. If it flips bitcoin at a low price point, the next bull cycle looks much different.
01:03:31.200 - 01:03:35.738, Speaker C: And I think eventually multiple assets will flip bitcoin.
01:03:35.914 - 01:04:57.574, Speaker D: So one of the other variables here, which I think is really important to call out, and it ties back to our first point of conversation is what is the utility of the asset itself and its ability to be used as a collateral asset? And one of the things that just as we're discussing blew up, is Genesis. Genesis was probably, if not the largest, but also one of the biggest and probably the only places in size to be able to get any sort of borrow against your collateral of bitcoin. And if that goes away, where else can you use your BTC as a collateral asset to be used productively? Whereas at the same time, DeFi, which has performed perfectly fine over this entire Tumultuous period ETH is the number one collateral asset to be used in DeFi. So I actually think that there's another variable here, which is like, the utility of the assets themselves. And we can talk about it in the last couple of minutes here, but the ability to stake it, the ability to use that staking, to be able to be put into other rehypothecated networks like Eigen Layer and restaking as a new narrative that's building up. It's just you're compounding the utility of these assets themselves to be used productively. And removing the largest kind of utility function for bitcoin in the point of Genesis, I think, is actually another reason why the potential for this monetary premium.
01:04:57.622 - 01:05:12.990, Speaker C: To shift and uses make things cultural. Like, think of the culture of bitcoin I'm holding, I'm hodling, it's in my wallet, it's in cold storage, whatever. Think of the cultural nuances of Ethereum. I'm staking. I'm swapping. I'm yield. Farming.
01:05:12.990 - 01:05:27.794, Speaker C: I'm restaking. When you tell your friends about the assets that you own, if you're actually doing things with them, it's just self marketing at a certain point, if you have enough utility into it, yeah, you might be right.
01:05:27.832 - 01:06:19.298, Speaker B: I feel like I'm sort of getting outclassed on this debate, so I'm just going to shut it down and I'm just going to say I'm in support of both these things. I want to get to know you talked about sustainability here and I want to bring up there was a really good thread that I don't know how you pronounce this Twitter handle. Polina put yeah, yeah. Polina basically put out on sustainable investing. I'm not sure if you guys had a chance to see this or take a look, but you kind of ask this question of what does sustainability look like in terms of investing in crypto? And I really like the definition. So in a crypto context, what does economic sustainability look like? Demand drivers, users paying to use the protocol, users buying the asset as economic collateral, medium of exchanged or just as a cult, or users buying the asset to earn dividends, including fee burns, yields, et cetera. Then on the supply side, it's the cost of operating the network.
01:06:19.298 - 01:06:45.246, Speaker B: And issuance, yes, it's supply. Deal with it. So economic sustainability is A, demand equals supply and B, issuance is greater than the cost of operation. So I'd love to get a sense of I think what Polino is trying to do is put a definition around the very simple definition of business. You got to make more money than you spend. And then there's a great Logan Roy quote, you make more money. I got a fancy new business idea for you.
01:06:45.246 - 01:07:12.440, Speaker B: You make more money than you spend, and everybody calls you King Kun. That's the for a while, I think in crypto it looks a little bit different. I do think you could define especially something like ethereum as an economic system necessarily as opposed to just a business. So I'd be curious, what do you guys think about that definition that Polenya laid out? How do you guys view sustainability within the context of these.
01:07:14.730 - 01:08:17.050, Speaker C: Mean? First of all, I think this is great. It feels like there's like a renaissance of crypto investing coming back where people last year would just try to bamboozle you with, like it's a parachain, it's an app chain. It's a modular stack with a data availability layer. It's like, how does this make money? How is this sustainable? What is the path for this to generate $100 million of Arr per year? And that's kind of what the core of what Palina is getting at here is with these blockchains, you have this sustainability question that is it's apparent in businesses, but a little bit less so because you're literally printing your native token to cover the security of the network. And if you print enough, the asset goes to zero, no one will want to hold it. And so refocusing around the core concepts of how much does this cost to run, how much money does this make, how many users does it have? What are they using it for? This is such a positive new take on crypto investing and I hope it spreads a little bit further but in terms of how things can be sustainable, I think ethereum you can say yes, check, this is sustainable. It's deflationary at this point.
01:08:17.050 - 01:09:16.640, Speaker C: Very interesting. Okay, check. Can middleware be sustainable? Hasn't really been proved yet. They've just had to print so many tokens to cover the cost of running their networks like it's still TBD. What level of fees flow through them? The apps feel like they can be sustainable but it's less of a protocol question. Maybe you have an app chain or things like that, but are you generating enough fees through your consumer set to maintain a smaller and more sustainable self contained system that feels possible? And so where we kind of net out on it is it's like the reverse hamburger thesis where you only want to own the buns like you want to own the canonical internet money layer at the very top because that's sustainable. Maybe you want to own the apps at the very bottom because those are sustainable as well and we've seen that things, albeit short lived axio, Infinity Step in blah blah blah I wouldn't call those sustainable but you had enough consumers where you could make the case everything in the middle still needs to be proven out.
01:09:18.770 - 01:10:19.300, Speaker D: The only thing I'd add to that is that not to say that we don't think it's possible for it to be proven out it's just that there hasn't been the use case for it yet. And I actually think one of the best use cases for how you make the middleware useful and therefore sustainable I think is if cross chain really becomes the advantage of having blockchains and differentiated blockchains. So imagine you've got sustainable games on each different individual Cosmos app chain. For them to be able to communicate back and forth, there has to be a cross chain communications protocol that could be a place where you basically inject something that's really easy to use. But it's like taking a small amount of fee to process that network transaction in the same way that it takes a small amount of gas every time you want to process an ethereum transaction. So I think that as we move more into the cross chain or as we move into not completely cross chain but maybe like some app chains, some main chains, some layer like that's where you can start to see this middleware play out. But to Vance's point, I think we haven't seen it yet but not to say that we don't think it's coming.
01:10:20.230 - 01:10:45.260, Speaker C: There's also the question of scale. Sustainable at scale is a lot different than sustainable at a smaller scale, like sustainable at a trillion dollars of market cap. That's like the 8th wonder of the world if you could do that. But apps are much smaller. Maybe your app chain only has a market cap of a few hundred million and you're making enough fees to cover it. It's just about right sizing it at least a lot of it is.
01:10:45.790 - 01:11:41.770, Speaker D: The other thing I'd add to this, which I actually so the revenue and the usage, I think demand drivers make total sense. It's just sort of like going back to the basics of what is the business and how do you value it. The supply side is actually the really interesting one because it also ties back into what we were talking about with serum FTT and this sort of like lack of liquidity as being the core driver of value. This happens also, by the way, in every single tech company, especially in the Fang companies, where every single year you've got 2% of new capital stock being printed, which goes as payment for keeping everybody employed and keeping everybody incentivized. And that I think is an interesting comp and an interesting model where some inflation to the token to keep everybody aligned, everybody incentivized, could make sense. But it's how you do it, it's how your capital structure is formed, it's how your cap table is situated. Because if you got an overhang of somebody who owns twelve and a half percent of your tokens and they could sell at any moment, that's going to be a potentially dangerous situation.
01:11:41.770 - 01:12:02.114, Speaker D: So the supply side of this I think is actually probably more interesting as we pick up the pieces of the industry and think about how we restructure things going forward. The demand side I think is that classic meme of always has been. It's like revenue, profit usage always has been. The supply side I think is where we have a lot of room for.
01:12:02.152 - 01:12:29.770, Speaker C: New ideas, a TradFi comp to throw out there. So Coinbase has done 1.2 billion in stock based comp this year and they're probably going to add another 400, 500 million onto that in Q. Four market cap of that company is nine and a half billion today. And some of the stock was issued at a higher price point, some of it at this price point. But you're looking at like 10% inflation. If you're looking at this as a protocol of what you own in Coin.
01:12:29.770 - 01:12:50.354, Speaker C: And you do have the fact that it's not immediately market dumped by the people who get it. It's vesting, it vests over time, but they granted that this year. In previous years they've granted a lot more and that's hitting the market. And so there is this question of inflation and sustainability with even the largest public companies. To Michael's point, I have a thought.
01:12:50.392 - 01:13:19.686, Speaker B: On that and I think not that you were doing this, Vance, but there's a temptation to be like, wow, 10%, that's really high I think the important question to ask there is, what are you getting for that 10% inflation? Because if the labor that you acquire for that 10% inflation is going to double your market cap, this is where it's difficult to measure actually what your ROI is on whatever labor you're acquiring there, but it depends on the return for what you get or what you're spending.
01:13:19.718 - 01:13:22.634, Speaker C: Totally. But they paid their CPO, who by.
01:13:22.672 - 01:13:24.640, Speaker B: All depending coinbase here, by the way.
01:13:28.370 - 01:13:33.390, Speaker C: How much did that add to the market cap? If you follow the chart, negative. Negative.
01:13:33.970 - 01:13:46.980, Speaker B: Brian Armstrong has been coin based recently. I did see, though, that he's so based. He is 100% has been dumping stock here at $45. And I actually was going to buy the other day and I was like, but damn, Brian's selling here.
01:13:47.850 - 01:13:50.598, Speaker A: Hold on. Yes.
01:13:50.684 - 01:13:52.630, Speaker C: Wait. Let Yana go. Let Yana go.
01:13:52.780 - 01:14:25.962, Speaker A: I was just going to say, he went on Lex Friedman's podcast, like two months ago or something, and he's like, I am telling the market this. I have an auto sell on. I'm going to sell the same amount of stock every single month for the next couple of years. And I'm doing it to fund it's, like 2% of the allocation of my total stock. And I'm doing it to fund, I think, his life Sciences business or whatever he's doing exactly on the biotech side or something. So he did signal to the market and he said he's like, I'm going to sell the same amount every single month, and when the price is low, people are going to freak out. When the price is high, people are going to freak out.
01:14:26.036 - 01:15:11.294, Speaker D: But that's what I'm telling you. Exactly that. One thing to note is that any insider or, frankly, anyone who has privy information at a publicly traded company because I was a product manager and had access to the revenue figures at Snap, I had to be put. On what's called a plan ten B 51, which is basically you literally build a plan and issue it, or you send it into the SEC and you say, at this price point or at this date, I want to sell this amount of stock either in terms of number of shares or amount of value. And so this plan has literally probably been filed with the SEC for the past twelve months. Anyone who is selling stock, who's an insider, who has to like you can track on SEC, Edgar. All those people are predetermined, so it's not up to them.
01:15:11.294 - 01:15:26.390, Speaker D: It's something that's literally been sitting there, and it has a three month cooling period, and every twelve months you can change it, but everybody jumps over like, oh, insiders are selling, insiders are dumping. Man, wouldn't it be nice that we had ten B, five ones in crypto?
01:15:28.010 - 01:15:37.590, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds like Brian's getting into some light, effective altruism, hopefully not too deep.
01:15:38.170 - 01:15:39.266, Speaker B: I've got limited.
01:15:39.378 - 01:15:40.360, Speaker A: You never want.
01:15:42.190 - 01:16:01.280, Speaker B: To go full. Yeah, do we have five minutes for Meme of the week? I know we're running low, but there's only one candidate for Meme of the Week this week, which is hold on a second. I'm going to share my screen there. Can you guys see?
01:16:05.350 - 01:16:06.578, Speaker C: Yeah. This video.
01:16:06.664 - 01:16:08.340, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, this is so good.
01:16:13.190 - 01:16:13.954, Speaker C: You can't hear it.
01:16:13.992 - 01:16:16.178, Speaker B: Wait till they talk. You can't hear it.
01:16:16.264 - 01:16:19.266, Speaker A: All right, we're going to put a link in the show notes.
01:16:19.298 - 01:16:39.100, Speaker B: This is the best video. Put a link in the show notes. Yeah. I think there's a non zero chance, like a 10% chance that Elon Musk and AOC see this. They're like, yeah, we should be hooking up 100%. I put it above 10%. That ends up happening.
01:16:41.790 - 01:16:48.240, Speaker A: That would be such a narrative violation. That'd be such a narrative violation. People would not know what to do with that. I would love that.
01:16:48.930 - 01:16:50.960, Speaker C: You and I, we are not so different.
01:16:53.650 - 01:16:59.090, Speaker B: We are not so different. We'll link that in the show notes. I thought we could play the sound.
01:16:59.160 - 01:17:05.330, Speaker A: Yeah. Vance, you can use the next episode to school us on the Egen layer.
01:17:05.910 - 01:17:08.770, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, it's Eigen layer, bro. It's German.
01:17:09.990 - 01:17:11.010, Speaker B: Eigenve.
01:17:11.510 - 01:17:12.638, Speaker A: Eigenve.
01:17:12.814 - 01:17:20.294, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll skip the German accent attempts here, fellas. This was a really fun one, guys. Happy Thanksgiving for everyone.
01:17:20.332 - 01:17:21.390, Speaker D: Who's Thanksgiving.
01:17:21.490 - 01:17:49.300, Speaker B: Drown your SARS and some gravy. Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on how to talk? This is going to be if this is your first. I'm writing this newsletter today. Our guys out sick Byron and last year I went back, I wrote this thing like how to be the crypto expert your Thanksgiving if you've never been that crypto person at a Thanksgiving table during a bear market. Just get ready, my man. No one's asking you how to set up your coinbase this year.
01:17:49.300 - 01:17:52.340, Speaker B: It's a sea of smug faces and.
01:17:53.190 - 01:17:54.050, Speaker C: How'S.
01:17:57.430 - 01:18:12.026, Speaker A: My I got to my in laws yesterday and they basically just looked at me and they're like, do you want to talk about crypto or no? If you don't, it's totally fine. So that's how you know it's really bad. Are you okay? Yeah.
01:18:12.208 - 01:18:15.210, Speaker C: Just show them the blockworks. Monthly active users.
01:18:16.430 - 01:18:19.722, Speaker A: At least you guys got a new website.
01:18:19.776 - 01:18:21.562, Speaker C: Pretty clean. I saw that. Looks good.
01:18:21.696 - 01:18:51.794, Speaker D: Relaunched shout out to you guys. Last night I had a couple of my parents friends came over for dinner and literally went the entire night until the last seven minutes as everybody was literally packing up and literally one of my parents friends goes, so do you think she knew? I was like, wait a second, how deep are you into this? And she had read every single article. She was like following the tweet know not into crypto whatsoever. I think this story has captivated audiences but Deanna's point, everybody's a little cautious.
01:18:51.842 - 01:18:53.160, Speaker C: To talk to us about it.
01:18:55.450 - 01:19:14.158, Speaker B: It has captivated know on the margin. Don't talk about a lot of crypto. Talk about a lot of macro stuff and everyone, all the macro people, I mean, there's some element of grave dancing, I think, that's going on there. But everyone wants to talk about Sam Bakeman. It's the biggest story in finance, I think, for the last year, I would say.
01:19:14.244 - 01:19:37.582, Speaker C: Mike, let me ask you this. All the on the margin guests that are super bearish doing victory lapse, let's play the clock forward six months, things are looking rallying. Are these people going to have as loud as a megaphone? Are you still going to want to have them on your pod? How does it all work? The thought leader economy on the margin.
01:19:37.646 - 01:20:06.570, Speaker B: Initially was I had this theory going in that if you just talk to these people kind of in their language, on their level about bitcoin and crypto, that you could kind of break down some barriers and there would be interesting conversation. And like, two years later, I don't think that's the case anymore. I think they have a lot to contribute and I'm interested in their perspective on the world and investing in general. But no, I think most of them are just going to stay bearish forever.
01:20:06.650 - 01:20:09.470, Speaker C: Keep in mind they're all incentivized to stay bearish.
01:20:09.810 - 01:20:26.934, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, let me ask you guys, what do you think? So we talked about Tom Lee. I used to look at this and wonder why this was. There are perma bulls and there are perma bears. There are always perma bulls, perma bears, and they don't seem to shift. They're just always bullish. And then they have their kind of day in the sun and then it turns around and then it kind of comes back.
01:20:26.934 - 01:20:29.640, Speaker B: And why do you think that is?
01:20:30.570 - 01:20:47.180, Speaker C: Optimism versus pessimism. Also, it's very important. We know a lot of perma bears. They're like the paranoid ones, the ones who are like tinfoil hatting, for lack of a better word, and they have not had their day in the sun for almost 20 years.
01:20:47.630 - 01:20:48.186, Speaker D: Exactly.
01:20:48.288 - 01:21:29.740, Speaker C: And finally, the guys who are predicting oil going to 300, I don't know if you follow H cuppy or those guys, oil is going to 300. All these Saudi memes and congratulations, you had your five minutes in the sun. Oil didn't go to 300, it's back below 85. But everyone really enjoyed meeting you and we'll see you in ten years. I think that's kind of the prognosis for them and it's unfortunate, but technology doesn't stop, it just keeps innovating, things get better. If you look at any measure of standard of living over the past 100 years, it's up. Only the optimists are usually right, so.
01:21:30.110 - 01:21:31.770, Speaker B: I agree with that.
01:21:31.840 - 01:22:16.390, Speaker D: I would say from an investment standpoint, or anyone who's in the investment business, you basically have two ways of thinking, which is what possibly could go right versus what are all the ways that this could go wrong? And those are like two very fundamentally different views. Obviously, a venture and growth perspective is what are the different ways that this could go right. And thinking about it from a macro perspective, being more of a trader mindset or frankly, just like private equity or how are all the different ways that this go wrong and let's go off and defend all of those. And so I think from a business perspective, you can't be straddling both at the same time. You really have to come at it from one angle versus the other. And that just like, tends in a more pessimistic versus optimistic perspective.
01:22:18.670 - 01:22:22.780, Speaker B: Between the two of us. Where do we shake out there? What do you think?
01:22:26.590 - 01:22:27.580, Speaker A: Looking at the.
01:22:30.270 - 01:22:32.390, Speaker C: Guy, let's be clear.
01:22:32.480 - 01:22:36.762, Speaker D: Anybody in this industry has to be an optimist first and foremost.
01:22:36.906 - 01:22:48.178, Speaker A: I was going to say, Mike, put yourself in any other place and you are very an optimistic person. Put yourself compared to me and you're like an eternal pessimist. But it's all relative here.
01:22:48.264 - 01:23:01.430, Speaker B: Yeah. I will say I will credit you and say you were the person that convinced me that optimism is the better strategy. I will say, just watching how Jason Yanowitz lives his life, I was like, this is the better strategy. For sure.
01:23:01.580 - 01:23:02.946, Speaker C: You're also a lot happier.
01:23:03.058 - 01:23:03.974, Speaker B: Yeah, you are.
01:23:04.092 - 01:23:07.554, Speaker C: I find last thing I'll say is so two people who are incentivized.
01:23:07.602 - 01:23:10.410, Speaker A: Been a tough year, for obvious, but it's better life strategy.
01:23:11.630 - 01:23:25.920, Speaker C: Two people who love to be bearish. Number one, the perma bears. Number two, people who have recently lost a lot of money. If I've lost a lot of money, I'm telling you that you're going to lose a lot of money too, because that makes me feel better about losing money.
01:23:27.330 - 01:23:29.280, Speaker D: Number three, people in cash.
01:23:29.650 - 01:23:31.040, Speaker C: Yeah. People in cash.
01:23:31.410 - 01:23:31.918, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:23:32.004 - 01:23:33.086, Speaker C: God bless them.
01:23:33.188 - 01:23:34.666, Speaker B: That was kind of the best number four.
01:23:34.788 - 01:23:39.380, Speaker C: Bitcoin maxis or bitcoin maxis. Yeah. They just hate everything.
01:23:40.630 - 01:24:12.570, Speaker B: Yeah. I think optimism is the better strategy. I will say there is a little element of me that I do empathize with the maybe that's why I like those talks so much. Because I will say there is some element. Vance I empathize a lot with what you said where you kind of ask yourself why they say they don't do this. But you listen to the gold bugs, the bitcoin max, and they're like, you just wait until hyperinflation. And there's this desire, right? I think they've correctly been labeled as wanting to watch the world burn.
01:24:12.570 - 01:24:41.266, Speaker B: And I think the underlying urge of that is the desire for actions to have consequences. That's how I personally have ascribed that. Because I do think you could make the case where you look at the system that TradFi is based off, which is basically just endless waves of money printing. And all these problems that we're facing in crypto have never really fully been solved in TradFi. They've just been consolidated. There have been various waves of bad debt and assets have collapsed, and they've just consolidated them onto bigger balance. Sheets.
01:24:41.266 - 01:25:01.494, Speaker B: And now we're at the end of that cycle because that's all moving up to the government. They've never even actually solved it. They've just kicked the can down the road for a long period of time. And I think there are people that have looked at that and said, this isn't necessarily sustainable. And they want there to be the actions to have consequences. That's what I ascribe to. Underlying emotional dynamic, to that particular mindset.
01:25:01.494 - 01:25:07.726, Speaker B: And a part of me, I see where they're coming from. I don't want that to happen personally, but I see where they're coming from.
01:25:07.908 - 01:25:16.402, Speaker D: I actually don't disagree with those perspectives. I think it's just a matter of timescale they could be right. It's just a question of when will they be right?
01:25:16.536 - 01:25:17.220, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:25:17.990 - 01:25:37.958, Speaker A: Here's what it comes down to. Optimism versus pessimist. If the cynic and the pessimist is right, what do they get? They get to say, I told you so. If the optimist is right, they get to then go build the thing. And it sounds a lot more fun to build the thing. I hope people are watching on YouTube for my air traffic control.
01:25:38.044 - 01:25:47.000, Speaker B: Here's the deal. I'm with you. Yeah, I'm with you guys.
01:25:47.610 - 01:25:49.014, Speaker C: Can't live your life scared of things.
01:25:49.052 - 01:25:50.590, Speaker A: Does not compound no.
01:25:50.660 - 01:25:53.182, Speaker B: And happy Turkey day, everybody. Happy Turkey day.
01:25:53.316 - 01:25:54.506, Speaker C: Happy Turkey.
01:25:54.698 - 01:25:56.380, Speaker B: We'll see everyone on the other side.
