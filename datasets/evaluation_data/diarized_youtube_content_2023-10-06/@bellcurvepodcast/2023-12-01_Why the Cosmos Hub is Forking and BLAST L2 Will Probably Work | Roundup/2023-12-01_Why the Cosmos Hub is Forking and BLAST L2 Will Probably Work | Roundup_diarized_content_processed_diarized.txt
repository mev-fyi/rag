00:01:04.710 - 00:01:08.500, Speaker C: Good to be here post turkey day.
00:01:09.590 - 00:01:15.330, Speaker A: Yeah. What do people do with big family time? Did anyone cook or attempt to cook.
00:01:18.550 - 00:01:21.160, Speaker D: Hard? No, absolutely not.
00:01:21.850 - 00:01:27.982, Speaker C: I was in charge of a side, let's just put it that way, that gives you all the confidence that my family has of me for cooking.
00:01:28.146 - 00:01:30.810, Speaker A: What did they put you in charge of? Mashed potatoes?
00:01:31.150 - 00:01:36.778, Speaker C: No, I did a Buffalo cauliflower dip. It's actually pretty good.
00:01:36.944 - 00:01:44.010, Speaker A: Okay, that's pretty good. That's like a six and a half, seven difficulty. I would say that's showing some faith in you.
00:01:44.080 - 00:01:45.022, Speaker B: It's pretty good.
00:01:45.156 - 00:01:56.930, Speaker D: Yeah, I was at my girlfriend's family's place and it's like huge family, 60 person Thanksgiving. It was really intense.
00:02:00.710 - 00:02:03.940, Speaker C: First time meeting everybody or second time?
00:02:05.130 - 00:02:10.214, Speaker D: Definitely some new faces I've met. Always a lot. Yeah.
00:02:10.332 - 00:02:34.494, Speaker A: No pressure, no pressure. Yeah. Nice. Well, all right, let's get into it. The first thing I wanted to ask you guys about, or maybe just bring up. Obviously this is a little bit old news, but CZ is stepping down as the CEO of finance in a pretty landmark deal made with the Department of Justice. So there was a large $4.3
00:02:34.494 - 00:03:00.514, Speaker A: billion fine. CZ is going to retain ownership, but he can't operate being involved in any sort of operating capacity for the next three years or so. So obviously this is all relatively old news. I would love to get your guys, I guess, just high level take on it. There have been kind of divided. I think some people view this as like, okay, this is sort of the next step, right? This is one of the big hurdles or sort of overhangs that still exist. From a regulatory capacity.
00:03:00.514 - 00:03:47.846, Speaker A: We know that us regulators haven't been super friendly towards binance. I think a lot of folks on crypto Twitter have had the idea that, look, CZ did a lot for this industry. We finally found out how many accounts finance had. They had 150,000,000 accounts. They've arguably onboarded more people into crypto than any other entity in existence. So I think there's kind of that angle to it. But I also wanted to get your guys thoughts on where you see binance market share, which is just a question that I've been asking myself three years out, say, is it less than it is today? Does binance sort of slowly bleed out from here? Or I think you could actually make the argument that because the DOJ is going to be surveilling them, they're kind of one of the most trusted exchanges in crypto today, and they have the head start of a ton of liquidity and partnerships and all that stuff that they've been building out.
00:03:47.846 - 00:03:52.920, Speaker A: So I guess, what's your guys high level take on the whole binance and CZ stepping down?
00:03:53.850 - 00:03:58.460, Speaker D: Do you mean sax market share or exchange market share?
00:03:59.310 - 00:04:00.646, Speaker A: Say again, Sam.
00:04:00.838 - 00:04:05.030, Speaker D: Sax market share or exchange market share generally?
00:04:05.190 - 00:04:06.506, Speaker A: That's a good question.
00:04:06.688 - 00:04:08.714, Speaker C: That's the question, yeah.
00:04:08.832 - 00:04:12.640, Speaker A: Okay, let's say both. I'd like those.
00:04:15.250 - 00:05:10.778, Speaker C: So, just broadly speaking, you hit the nail on the head mike with this is one of the overhangs of uncertainty that everybody had been thinking about, talking about, knew it was coming, nobody knew when it was going to happen. It's one of those things where when you're watching a scary movie and you finally see the monster that's been chasing people around, you're like, oh, well, okay, it's not that bad. I think this is actually a pretty fundamentally bullish thing for the global crypto ecosystem. Just removing the uncertainty is huge. The other angle, too, I think, is, and I saw a couple of people positioning this way, is they were never going to let something like an ETF go through without the clearing of this type of a situation. So I think that's actually pretty bullish as well for the ETF that's potentially happening in January ish. So ultimately, I think this is a positive.
00:05:10.778 - 00:05:56.830, Speaker C: It's the 7th largest fine in us history and maybe the largest in Department of Justice history. Cz also is not able to travel back to the UAE. In the meantime, he has a sentencing hearing in like, there's still a lot of stuff to figure out. What's going to happen with this situation. Yes, they're going to be surveilled by the US now. They also are going to have to totally cut ties with all us customers. So I think that is probably one of the bigger questions in terms of are there still remaining us customers as a vestige of the 2018 era? They're now not going to be able to trade on that platform.
00:05:56.830 - 00:06:23.000, Speaker C: How they cut them off remains to be seen, but it seems like they're going to move in that direction. I also saw that they're shutting down BusD, which they're going to have to start cutting off these products and services. So to Sam's point, I think broadly, our view is that Dex activity will overtake sex activity in a period of time, like in the next year or two. And I think this is one of the catalysts that helps make that happen.
00:06:24.650 - 00:07:17.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd agree with that. A lot of parts of finance that people don't have a full view on, nobody has a full view on. And there's a lot of parts of the regulatory action that people don't have a lot of visibility into. We're seeing delistings happening, but it's pretty clear they're going to be more constrained in some way. So that's a big question mark for me as to how effective they can be as a centralized exchange. We also don't know a whole lot about the internal leadership and morale and a lot of things that intangibles that are pretty important for having that kind of leading market position. Yeah.
00:07:17.820 - 00:07:18.754, Speaker A: Vance, what do you think?
00:07:18.812 - 00:07:45.410, Speaker B: The only other take I have on this, like, the CME, is now the largest open interest exchange in crypto. So it's not even like binance. Market share is slowly dwindling. It's just like these other exchanges are really gaining on them. And it's obviously not the same set of people. It's differentiated its institutions. And imagine what an ETF looks like compared to spot centralized exchange as we know them volumes.
00:07:45.410 - 00:08:25.290, Speaker B: It could be like centralized exchanges in crypto are pretty insignificant. Obviously, a lot of the flow will hit binance and a rising tide will lift all boats. But I could see that happening. The other mean just in reading kind of the regulatory news this week is William Adebo, who is a treasury executive at the US government. He's now asking for more power to go after international stablecoin issuers. Obviously, that's a code word for tether, but to the extent he's able to succeed, it's like, we've already kind of beaten that horse. They already had all those lawsuits.
00:08:25.290 - 00:09:12.350, Speaker B: We'll see. But it just kind of goes to show you that no one is beyond the reach of us law enforcement, right? This guy seems like a nice guy, whatever, but no one is beyond the reach of these people. Even CZ, who was in a non extradition country, had 30, $40 billion, whatever. However rich he is, it makes me nervous about Justin's son and his status, because he's the last of the Mohicans in some ways, and we'll see if that persists. But people are like, oh, yeah, he just runs these crazy scams on TROn and St. USDT isn't even USDT, and nobody knows what's backing it. All good things must come to an end at some point.
00:09:12.350 - 00:09:43.160, Speaker B: And so we'll see. And for a lot of these guys, if the choice is you get to be a. A person with ten or $20 billion, like maybe Cz or Justin sun, but you have to stay within Dubai, Russia, Turkey, Iran or Korea, like, those are your vacation spots, or you make a deal and you're like a global citizen again. What's the point of having all that money if you can't travel? It doesn't make any sense.
00:09:43.610 - 00:10:31.110, Speaker C: One of the variables that I think people kind of found out was in the plea deal with CZ, he will not appeal anything. He does not have the ability to appeal anything up to 18 months of jail time. But he does have the ability to appeal something if there is more than 18 months. How they got to that 18 months, no idea. But I think there is an element of there's not a 0% chance that CZ will face jail time when sentencing is up. Obviously, we know others, like Arthur Hayes, had house arrest, and there have been previous infractions in a similar vein, maybe not at the same scale, and obviously not with the backdrop that we have now, but there is an element of the story is not done yet for CZ.
00:10:32.170 - 00:11:03.998, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's tough to ever really fully predict that out. I agree with all of you guys. I just see centralized exchange, market share dwindling. And I actually do. When we talk about blast, I think a really good, interesting area that this is already playing out, frankly, is nfts. Like, if you look at what Blur has done on Ethereum, and if you look at what tensor has done on Solana, it's been pretty remarkable to see just how fast that market share has shifted from a super dominant position from incumbents.
00:11:04.094 - 00:11:28.220, Speaker D: The Department of Justice has played a new card here. We know a little bit more information about their position. Just because it's a regulatory action of this magnitude. There are things that they could have done that they didn't do that might indicate to others how they may proceed in the future.
00:11:29.230 - 00:11:48.080, Speaker C: And namely the person who, or the people who were not represented at the press conference was the SEC. Yeah, I thought that was, you know, CFTC, DOJ, treasury, but no sec. That does also leave open the potential for something else to happen.
00:11:49.890 - 00:12:02.814, Speaker A: Is anyone else interested in the price of. The price of BNB has held up very well. I don't know what. I didn't have an expectation for how it would respond to something like this, but it's been interesting to me that hasn't.
00:12:02.862 - 00:12:07.590, Speaker D: I'm super curious what happens to their chain.
00:12:08.330 - 00:12:09.320, Speaker A: Me too.
00:12:11.290 - 00:12:12.390, Speaker D: Who knows?
00:12:14.970 - 00:13:10.620, Speaker C: Definitely a lot of unanswered questions and who knows? But I also think we're talking about such a global ecosystem that 150,000,000 people, even if it was 150,000,000 people completely outside the United States, is so small in comparison to the global population that's interested in this. And I think, yes, there is a point of you are under the reach of the US regulators, if you have any sort of us customer base. But I do think that binance is something that will persist at the scale that it has. And the recognition with the BNB price or any of the ecosystem, like the trading volume, hasn't fallen off precipitously. They're going to have to cut back stuff eventually. But we're talking about a global ecosystem, and there are regulatory regimes that are much more favorable for this. And frankly, where finance has focused over the last few years, the bulk of these infractions happened before or during 2021, and things have changed since then.
00:13:10.620 - 00:13:23.470, Speaker C: So I don't know. It's possible that we just start to see binance as a rest of world operator that doesn't touch any us persons or customers, and they're going to be able to know massive, therefore.
00:13:25.810 - 00:14:02.166, Speaker A: Yeah, you might be right. Also, just I don't really know much about Richard Tang. It seems like he's got a great background. He could be sort of the Dara kosher sahi to Travis Kalamick at Uber, and maybe he. I don't know, I could see it happening. I do think also, Vance, you made a really interesting point about CME, I feel like it's gotten a little bit of attention, but not an enormous amount, maybe to just transition a little bit here. So CME open interest has absolutely exploded, and it feels like that's actually what's been leading some of at least the price action in bitcoin and ethereum.
00:14:02.166 - 00:14:20.510, Speaker A: It's also interesting. I mean, people have been following this pretty closely, but Coinbase has been doing very well and microstrategy has been outperforming as well. Some of these public market proxies for crypto, actually, Michael Saylor announced another 500 some million dollar bitcoin.
00:14:22.290 - 00:14:26.014, Speaker C: He found 500 mil under the couch cushions and decided to buy some BTC.
00:14:26.142 - 00:15:02.940, Speaker A: Yeah. And he's issuing another $750,000,000 worth of equity to presumably buy more bitcoin. But both of those things taken in conjunction, it's kind of like when microstrategy and Coinbase starts to do well, that sort of smells like an institutional or more traditional interest in crypto. And same thing with CME. So it's just interesting to see all of that pick up ahead of a potential spot ETF approval and kind of gives some amount of data to support the idea that this could be an institutional led rally, actually. So I don't know if you guys agree with that, have thoughts or.
00:15:03.630 - 00:15:29.954, Speaker B: Yes, I think that's what we're playing for. This is what takes it to a million BTC. One hundred k e. It can only happen with institutional inflows. I think you can get to like five to ten k e, whatever, one hundred k for bitcoin with just retail and leverage enabled by perps and things like that. But it's never going to be sustainable. And so this is the secret ingredient.
00:15:29.954 - 00:15:42.460, Speaker B: I do think it's interesting that maybe kind of like a counter perspective is like bitcoin is. Sailor bought it at like 37 or something, I think was his average price.
00:15:44.110 - 00:15:48.250, Speaker C: Well, yeah, his total average is like.
00:15:48.320 - 00:15:49.974, Speaker B: But the last tranche was like 37.
00:15:50.032 - 00:15:50.880, Speaker C: 37.
00:15:52.290 - 00:16:16.680, Speaker B: It just goes to show you how much money is needed to move bitcoin. 700 million is like a lot. And I think if you put that into just about any other crypto asset, it would, like quadruple. But it's just like, rock is heavy, hard to move, grug smash tough out there.
00:16:17.290 - 00:16:18.280, Speaker D: That's true.
00:16:18.730 - 00:16:27.000, Speaker B: If we get $10 billion of inflows in the first year, that's 15 Michael sailors. Just think about that.
00:16:28.010 - 00:16:31.270, Speaker C: Well, Michael sailors this week, right.
00:16:31.340 - 00:16:48.640, Speaker B: I guess they start stacking at some point, but you need a lot of capital to move this thing and it can feed on itself. But I would say we're just painting the base coat right now, absorbing some supply ahead of the ETF. We're just getting our ducks in order. I think it's going to be interesting next year.
00:16:50.370 - 00:17:25.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I tend to agree. I also do think though, that bitcoin being larger and having it be more liquid and all that kind of stuff, it means this was always going to be what happened, right? It's not going to have these crazy. Maybe it won't have as many of these crazy moves, but that is what opens it up to real institutional money, like sovereign wealth funds and pensions, who always found. I just heard this from a lot of the people on the allocator side that I talked to. Bitcoin is just too small. Even so, you do, at a certain point when you get larger, you actually unlock a new supply of investors that you didn't have before. That's true.
00:17:26.830 - 00:17:36.030, Speaker D: What do we think that magnitude is? What's a benchmark for small versus large asset for these allocators?
00:17:37.250 - 00:18:12.700, Speaker C: I think it has to do less with the size of the asset, more with the volume on a trusted intermediary. And that's where the CME actually becomes really important, because that's how these players are going to be able to get in. Historically, if you're a pension fund or someone who manages hundreds of billions of dollars or tens of billions of dollars, your options are basically like Coinbase or like an OTC desk. Who's spreading that around to a bunch of different coinbase like entities? It's not very simple to buy bitcoin spot in size.
00:18:14.430 - 00:18:25.806, Speaker A: Just out of curiosity, I guess you'd have to spread this across like the ETF. But how much gold? What's a daily volume on something like gold that trades hands?
00:18:25.908 - 00:18:27.054, Speaker C: Anyone know?
00:18:27.252 - 00:18:51.400, Speaker B: Let's see. I was looking at Snapchat earlier that has like $500 million of volume a day. So it's interesting. In traditional finance, it seems like the alts are more liquid than your average crypto alt, which kind of makes sense. But gold, I think it's probably trading like, let's see. I would guess around what bitcoin does in a day.
00:18:52.490 - 00:19:02.870, Speaker C: But what is that? Is that GLD volume? The tough part is there's like gold bot, but you're not really trading that. It's all going to be a proxy.
00:19:03.030 - 00:19:34.850, Speaker B: All right, I got an answer here. This seems wildly. It says here it's 130,000,000,000 a day for gold. S and p 500 stocks are trading about 240,000,000,000 a day. It is worth noting that gold is the planet's largest asset, so that kind of does make sense intuitively. But we're working with maybe, like, 3% of daily gold volume in crypto.
00:19:37.110 - 00:19:46.920, Speaker A: Okay. Honestly, I could see myself being totally wrong on this, but that actually doesn't sound. That sounds directionally correct. Sounds right. Sam, what do you think?
00:19:48.750 - 00:20:11.200, Speaker D: I feel like there's even gold trading that's not, like, super visible, that's used for kind of internal accounting. So even the number that we're looking at there is not necessarily representative of the entire volume. So it's very hard to project. Right.
00:20:11.570 - 00:20:21.620, Speaker B: Also, congrats to gold bugs. It's above 2050, and they've been waiting for that since 2018, so big shout out to them.
00:20:22.230 - 00:20:25.060, Speaker A: Yeah, we're happy for you guys. Let's go.
00:20:26.310 - 00:20:32.870, Speaker B: By the way, actually, they're the second most insane people on the planet. You know who the first most insane group is?
00:20:32.940 - 00:20:33.270, Speaker A: No.
00:20:33.340 - 00:20:34.550, Speaker B: Silver bugs.
00:20:35.210 - 00:20:36.054, Speaker A: Really?
00:20:36.252 - 00:20:48.106, Speaker B: Those people are working with some raw materials in their head. I don't know what is going on, but someone convinced them a long time ago that silver was the key to generational citadel wealth. Crazy.
00:20:48.288 - 00:20:49.890, Speaker C: Just like litecoin.
00:20:50.070 - 00:20:54.442, Speaker A: Yeah, literally, first bag. First bag.
00:20:54.586 - 00:21:26.470, Speaker D: Wow. One of the Thanksgiving stories was basically someone's mother who was really into was a gold bug, and then kind of got into bitcoin through an antivaxx channel. So, yeah, it all checks out. The crazy aggregates. Classic.
00:21:26.970 - 00:21:28.778, Speaker B: It adds up. It adds up.
00:21:28.944 - 00:22:01.010, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Actually, one, by the way, just on that note about tether, I feel like this. So Hart Lambert was on this podcast last week, and he dropped this little tidbit that I feel like should have gotten slightly more attention. So he was in Istanbul for Devconnect or whatever, and he mentioned that you can go these markets. I think there's one particularly famous market out there. And he said, you can literally go and show up with, like, $10 million worth of cash and convert that into tether.
00:22:01.010 - 00:22:06.738, Speaker A: I feel like that's kind of a.
00:22:06.744 - 00:22:10.630, Speaker B: Big, even crazier stories that we've heard. I'll tell you one.
00:22:10.780 - 00:22:11.480, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:13.290 - 00:22:34.654, Speaker B: I'm not going to name the country, and we haven't done this, but we work with a company that does seizures and custody for law enforcement and big government agencies. And one of the examples that they gave us was, you get in this telegram group or WhatsApp or whatever, and there's a guy, obviously, and it's like.
00:22:34.772 - 00:22:36.554, Speaker A: Hey, I've got a bunch of tether.
00:22:36.682 - 00:23:15.130, Speaker B: That I want to redeem into cash or gold. And what they will do is you'll send the tether to an escrow, and they will drop a bag, and they'll bury it in the woods, and they'll put an apple air tag on it. And you use find my to find the air tag. And you dig for the bag, and you dig up the bag, and it's full of gold or cash or whatever. Anyways, we're the good guys on this one. We're helping stop this. But the OTC market for tether and into cash or physical assets, it's very real and it happens globally.
00:23:16.350 - 00:23:20.620, Speaker C: To be clear, the company that we're partnered with is the ones trying to prevent this from happening.
00:23:21.630 - 00:23:24.154, Speaker B: This is not like it's a great business opportunity.
00:23:24.272 - 00:23:24.940, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:27.310 - 00:23:33.280, Speaker B: It is. If you're helping the law enforcement and government side, it is.
00:23:33.650 - 00:23:53.506, Speaker C: So I thought the crazy know. I think it was maybe Hart who said it, or somebody that I heard who was at Devconnect. Taking it back to Justin sun was the dominant network that everybody trades USDT on is Tron. It's the vast majority of where USDT exists, which I had kind of known.
00:23:53.538 - 00:23:54.790, Speaker A: But I forgot about for a while.
00:23:54.860 - 00:24:18.990, Speaker C: And it is the dominant platform in these countries, and it's not even USDC. And the reason why I think he was talking about, or someone was talking about was just because of that one Saturday in March when everything blew apart, went down to rocketed it back up. That distrust is enough to be able to push people into USDT.
00:24:19.810 - 00:24:41.640, Speaker A: Wait, I can't remember now I'mixing up. I can't remember if you and I talked about this or if someone. I don't remember who told me this, but someone said something very similar to what you just said. And actually, the perception of people in other countries is that the tether team is more legit and better, more business oriented than the circle team, which just blew my mind.
00:24:42.330 - 00:24:43.080, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:24:44.330 - 00:24:58.620, Speaker B: Meanwhile, that IPO is the circle IPO that's been rumored or planned. I think there was something on the Internet in 2024. It'd be a weird look if your business just got halved and you're going public. I'm not sure how that works.
00:24:59.230 - 00:26:04.366, Speaker D: I think there is, like, a real lesson to be learned here, though, for the crypto industry, which is like, the tether go to market looked very different from the circle go to market. Like, the whole infrastructure wallet integration deployment strategy, very different. The organization is kind of tentacular in a way that is just kind of structurally not what circle looks like, and these are some of the things that you need to get deployment into countries that want access to these dollarized coins. So I'm fascinated by what that infrastructure actually looks like, what the kind of work structure looks like there, and it's hard to dig up information on it. I would love to talk to somebody who's really boots on the ground.
00:26:04.558 - 00:26:06.420, Speaker B: I don't think they want to talk to you.
00:26:07.910 - 00:26:09.460, Speaker D: I don't think so either.
00:26:13.270 - 00:26:53.600, Speaker B: The bull case for Tron is very clear. The bear case also very clear. Part of me thinks that at some point, the centralized sequencers, the networks that are facilitating basically like centralized transactions and transmissions of money, those are very clear. Like BSA violations. And at some point that will come to a head and it's either going to come to a head just by know. Some senator today asked Circle if they were aiding and abetting. Like, we're not far from, like you wake up and it's know the same thing with CZ is happening to.
00:26:55.650 - 00:27:24.886, Speaker A: See, I don't know if you guys, five years ago, if we know, talking about main characters, who was going to make it through this, I would not have been betting on his Excellency, but it's been pretty bulletproof, to his credit. And I actually did have. Yeah, so far. Right. I was talking to someone who works at a. Well, I don't want to actually out. They work in kind of like infrastructure and sort of a capital markets type role.
00:27:24.886 - 00:27:54.338, Speaker A: And they were saying they'd been hearing that the SEC commissioners were getting briefed on more mev related stuff. And I think I'm starting to hear it come through that. This mev stuff that was like a dark forest thing that crypto Internet nerds talked about is making its way towards regulators, and they're starting to understand it more, which was always going to happen, but it's tough to get the timeline anyway.
00:27:54.424 - 00:27:54.914, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:55.032 - 00:27:57.480, Speaker B: You ever heard of the object permanence problem?
00:27:58.730 - 00:27:59.814, Speaker A: Not really.
00:28:00.012 - 00:28:25.854, Speaker B: It's something that little children have where if I'm in a room and I go behind a wall, they think I've disappeared from the planet. Same thing goes with these regulatory infractions. It's like if you don't get caught, the second you commit the crime, you're free, you're not guilty. It's not how that works. The chargers are still in the room with you. They just haven't presented yet. So we'll see all of this stuff.
00:28:26.052 - 00:28:26.510, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:26.580 - 00:28:30.798, Speaker B: I advise everyone to think about the long game. Just not worth it.
00:28:30.884 - 00:28:36.830, Speaker C: We're still working our way through like 2020 stuff, and it's about to be 2024.
00:28:36.980 - 00:29:03.286, Speaker A: Yes, I agree. All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, Blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of crypto. We are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers. So think tradfi, macro funds, crypto native funds, big allocators and financial institutions. So banks, payment processors, et cetera, all in one spot.
00:29:03.286 - 00:29:25.422, Speaker A: It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan, Zero, 72, whatever, all in one room. So you can know what the big money is doing. We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of macro and crypto, where we are in the cycle, real world assets. So everything from stablecoins to onchain treasuries to tokenized assets, it's going to be a blast. But the other reason you really want to go is London, baby. Center of the world at one point.
00:29:25.422 - 00:29:45.110, Speaker A: You got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer, it's going to be a blast. So because you're such great listeners to Bell curve, there's a code, Bell 20, that's going to get you 20% off. So click the link at the bottom of this episode. It'll take you right over to the homepage. You'll see all of our speakers and use Bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code.
00:29:45.110 - 00:30:15.090, Speaker A: I will see you in sunny London town in March. Okay, so speaking of, I don't want to use that sequitur. Let's talk about blast. Blast is the new layer two, which is launched by Pac man. So Pac man is the founder of Blur, the marketplace, which honestly has been relatively controversial. I think there have been some. My personal opinion is sort of bad takes that they killed the NFT market, which I don't necessarily agree with.
00:30:15.090 - 00:30:31.798, Speaker A: They have eaten an enormous amount of market share, actually, from Openc here. I actually will share my screen. I've got some. There's a pretty good doom dashboard by Hildarby that covers this. But Pacman is clearly a good founder. He's got very good insights. He is 24 years old.
00:30:31.798 - 00:30:59.834, Speaker A: He's doing quite a bit. He's running two companies here. So he led paradigm and standard cold. $20 million round to launch blast. They had a very different go to market strategy. Same to your point about tether, where they basically launched as a multi sig, and it's kind of a one way multi sig where you can deposit funds that you can't get out for three months. And the whole point of blast as a layer two is that there's native yield.
00:30:59.834 - 00:31:19.880, Speaker A: So what blast does under the hood is it reallocates user deposits into one of two places, I believe, which is just steeth today or into maker. So you're getting treasury yield or sort of the eth stake rate they attracted about. I think it's just under 600 million in Tbl now.
00:31:20.570 - 00:31:22.760, Speaker C: I think it's higher than that now, but, yeah.
00:31:28.830 - 00:31:32.330, Speaker A: What's your guys take on this at a high level? Be curious.
00:31:33.230 - 00:31:36.010, Speaker C: Got to put a lot of trust into that multi sig.
00:31:40.270 - 00:31:47.040, Speaker B: We've done a couple of things like that in the past, but I don't see me putting full trust anytime soon.
00:31:48.930 - 00:32:01.090, Speaker A: I've been surprised that this much went in. It's like, how much are you really expecting to get in terms of rewards? It actually just feels like there's even better rewards that you could get elsewhere. There's better use of your capital.
00:32:01.430 - 00:32:21.340, Speaker C: So I think the global comment is independent of blast or whatever, is like, if you can put up a multi sag and have this new l two backed by whomever launching whenever, obtain $600 million of TvL over the course of the last four weeks. Crypto is back. Animal spirits are back.
00:32:21.870 - 00:32:23.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I tend to agree.
00:32:24.190 - 00:33:04.162, Speaker D: I have two thoughts on this. One. Blast marketing and kind of sketchiness of the multi sig. I think pretty clear it's off. Smells wrong. I haven't talked to anybody who wasn't a little bit concerned about it. The other big part of the narrative is basically whether staked tokens should be used on l two s and how that kind of changes the assumptions about how the l two operates.
00:33:04.162 - 00:33:28.960, Speaker D: The security model, the kind of validator set composition, and kind of control structure of the eth token. And it's definitely like forcing the hands of other l two s. It's putting some pressure on them to think about yield opportunities of the bridge contract between the l one and the l two.
00:33:31.330 - 00:34:31.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I think steeth supplies ripped higher. I think there's been, like 400 or 500,000 steeth, or maybe a little bit less than that 300, 350 dye supply from this is also ripping higher. And so this is what really good infrastructure looks like. If there's something happening on, know you downstream of it, become the beneficiary. And to Michael's point, we're back and there's going to be so many of these token farms, and I know a lot of them are going to use this same blast strategy, because why wouldn't you? It's obviously working and it's pretty easy to put together, at least a multi sig is. So I think the changes in this, from this, in my mind, are like, I'm neither bullish nor bearish blast, neither endorse nor back their tactics. But I think steep supply in general, staked ETH supply is going to be higher than most people project.
00:34:31.250 - 00:35:05.294, Speaker B: I would say it's probably going to be like 60 or 70% closer to Cosmos or salana. It'll take time, but this is like a week of farming, and there's like 300,000 steeth that have been staked because of it. Play that out over a super bullish year with restaking with all that stuff. I think that's the first one. And then the second one is probably dye supply. More bullish on dye supply. And a lot of it's going into the DSR, which is not directly benefiting maker because maker buys the treasuries, then they pass through the yield on the 5% flat pass through.
00:35:05.294 - 00:35:40.700, Speaker B: But once endgame farming starts and the tokens aren't going to the DSR, they're going to farm these subdow tokens at like 10% or 15% APY. You could see maker being a huge beneficiary of this trend. And why wouldn't USDC fill this role? A there's no yield pass back, and b the KYC obligations around converting that much money into that many USDC stablecoins, that's probably something that circle is going to be like. What's going on?
00:35:44.270 - 00:36:30.162, Speaker A: Think so. I have a lot of thoughts on think the. To your point about. I guess I have a sort of uneasy feeling about it, but I also think it's probably going to work and probably become something that looks more like the norm. If you think about this from the standpoint of, and actually I had a long conversation with miles about this, this is sort of his observation, I think it's true, which is that if you think about the challenge from a regular l two, okay, you're launching into a sea of layer twos. How exactly do you differentiate, really what you need is to attract users and developers to build on your platform, as opposed to arbitram or optimism or scroll or whoever. Now, if you don't have any latent user funds or something, that's a very different conversation.
00:36:30.162 - 00:36:39.510, Speaker A: But now, blast can say, hey, come build here. We have $570,000,000 or $600 million worth of tvL. There's clearly a lot of latent demand.
00:36:39.590 - 00:36:39.834, Speaker D: Right?
00:36:39.872 - 00:36:53.022, Speaker A: So it makes those conversations, I would guess, quite a bit easier. So I think from that standpoint, it's actually a pretty good strategy. I think my sort of concern about this is that they tweeted this out.
00:36:53.076 - 00:36:53.680, Speaker D: But.
00:36:55.810 - 00:37:29.466, Speaker A: My concern would just be, what are the risks and controls here? Because basically what you have here is kind of like an on chain blockfi structure, right? Where you've got people that deposit things, and then you're turning around and putting that into something that generates yield. Now you're passing all of that on to the user. There's a totally different revenue model. But if you look at the balance sheet of a blast versus something like blockfi, it looks sort of similar. My just concern would be like, have we thought through what is the infrastructure that's managing this right behind the scenes? And actually there was an example where.
00:37:29.568 - 00:37:35.226, Speaker B: It'S a multi sig, multi sig, multi sig pieces of technology as well.
00:37:35.408 - 00:37:57.714, Speaker A: I'll get this screenshot. We can drop it in when this actually goes live. But someone caught that if you deposit like tether, what they were turning around and doing was converting that into Dai through curve. But the default tolerance or slippage tolerance was set to 10%. They lost like $100,000, and then they just had to front the user that money. They give them an extra 10% bonus. But it's like, come on guys.
00:37:57.714 - 00:38:19.862, Speaker A: This doesn't make me feel particularly great about the protocols that are supporting something like this. And there could be weird edge cases, like, what if there's an enormous amount of people that want to withdraw? I would guess you have a market maker on the other side of that that maybe bridges the gap for a little bit. But these all feel like unanswered questions and I feel like they're pretty important. So I guess I have a general.
00:38:19.936 - 00:38:56.070, Speaker D: Feeling of nervousness about the whole thing. The other sharp edge is like the whole ecosystem is a rebasing ecosystem, so none of the contracts can be directly migrated over. You have to reimagine the entire structure of these defi protocols so that they work with rebase as a kind of native function. So I could see some blow ups happening from that. Just put guns there. That's going to be a very complex challenge to navigate.
00:38:56.490 - 00:39:11.900, Speaker C: Rebasing is one of the most difficult constructs to be dealing with. Maybe not as a user, but as any sort of intermediary or custodian or developer. So I was literally about to say, I think the construct is going to be problematic going forward.
00:39:12.510 - 00:39:26.820, Speaker A: Why would they do a rebasing instead of an exchange rate mechanism? It makes sense for something like steeth. I understand the psychological importance of Steve equaling eth, and that makes sense to me. But I'm a little confused about the decision to do rebase here.
00:39:29.990 - 00:39:48.840, Speaker B: Non rebasing is hard too. There's other challenges is what we use for a lot of our on chain stuff. And you're like, what's the price of wrap steeth? How much eth is that? Where's our liquidation? It's like hard to manage rebasing. At least it's like one Eth is one steeth, and you get more each day.
00:39:49.850 - 00:40:25.510, Speaker C: What that tells me is two things. Number one, what they will be attracting is retail. Because I think retail will care about more of the atomicity of what one token actually equals. And rebasing just means more tokens. It also tells me that they're not going to have as much custodial support, infrastructure, intermediary support, just because of that. Because rebasing is not like no one who's an intermediary can support a rebasing token, which is why wrapstate eth exists. The second is the bulk of the people that they're probably going to go after are non us.
00:40:25.510 - 00:40:48.890, Speaker C: Because in the US, what you get with a wrapped token Versus a rebasing token is a capital gain versus something that's declared income. And it's a minor point, but every single time you're earning more tokens, that's income versus something that you can wrap into an eventual capital gain or loss, but at least is cap gains or losses as opposed to income.
00:40:51.950 - 00:41:34.330, Speaker A: Okay, question for you guys, like, maybe last one on this. Do you think, because I think I forget Sam or Michael, one of the two, you made this point, that it might kick off the pressure for other layer twos to respond more immediately. But also, I feel like there's a temptation to look around and if blast is really successful and say, hey, there's a bunch of just piles of eth sitting around here being not very capital efficient, maybe we should try to find a home for them in something like Lido, for instance. And I do wonder if this sort of kicks off a capital efficiency meme almost, wherein everyone starts questioning why there are these pools of eth just sitting around not earning yield.
00:41:35.550 - 00:42:05.410, Speaker B: Ditto. Stablecoins, ditto. But one way to think about this is there's probably 70 million eth that are unstaked. There's like 100 billion of stablecoins that are not earning any yield. It's pretty simple to spin up a multi sig. It implies a very high valuation if you already have 800 million of value in this blast multi sig. And so the l two itself is probably worth billions.
00:42:05.410 - 00:42:41.840, Speaker B: And generally, one way to think about crypto is like the lowest amount of effort that can generate the highest dollar amount of profits is going to be ddos by people. They're going to spin up 50,000 uniswap clones. They're going to spin up 50,000 NFT collections. The technogrift is real. They will go after it. And who are the winners? I think the winners are the obvious, like the l two s blast, it's probably like high enterprise value. The winners are the users who frankly get more yield and airdrops and all that stuff.
00:42:41.840 - 00:43:04.070, Speaker B: But mostly the winners are like the large infrastructure plays that sit below these things, like steeth and whatever. Even if it's not die, even if it's, know, I can't even think of another yield bearing one. But there are like, those are the winners. Who are the losers? USDC and USDT.
00:43:06.010 - 00:43:10.200, Speaker D: Anyone who thinks the ETH stake rate is going to stay low.
00:43:10.990 - 00:43:29.790, Speaker B: Yeah, anyone who's betting on the ETH stake rate being low. But I think the bullcase for Lido is like they have like 30 million ETH staked and they're like 32 or 33% or whatever the number is. That's like the new way that we think about it, just from this stuff, because there's going to be so many of these farms.
00:43:30.130 - 00:44:10.720, Speaker D: Okay, just to play devil's advocate a little bit, let's say you're an optimism and you're at the stage where you have a decentralized sequencer and you're considering converting your entire bridge contract into staked ETh. You already have to curate an operator set for your decentralized sequencer. Why not just have them run ethereum nodes and become a liquid stake protocol? Like the operational overhead is zero, basically.
00:44:12.050 - 00:44:14.640, Speaker B: When do you think that decentralized sequencer comes?
00:44:17.090 - 00:44:18.480, Speaker D: You're these guys.
00:44:19.090 - 00:44:23.360, Speaker B: I don't know, like the next Winter Olympics is my guess.
00:44:24.290 - 00:44:25.040, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:44:27.030 - 00:45:19.620, Speaker B: Like Italy 2026. Here's the reality is this is all going to happen in the next two years, and then you're going to kind of ossify into the dominant infrastructure and the also rands. There's also probably a bunch of stuff that optimism has to do, even like regulatory. Clear this. And if you're a foundation, at least a US formally domiciled one, you are very careful in what you are doing, and you are making sure that it's as limited of scope as, like. I guess part of the reason that I'm so uncomfortable with blast is like, this doesn't seem like, it's like Michael and me being like, all right, send the money to our fireblocks address. We're going to do something with it, and we'll give it back to you in five months.
00:45:19.620 - 00:45:27.780, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just, like, problematic. Maybe it's possible in a decentralized context, but the optics don't get that much better.
00:45:28.170 - 00:45:44.806, Speaker A: I'll tell you what was not helping them out either, was those little graphics they drew of their marketing strategy, which I do feel, by the way, I will. Just because we're being a little hard on blast, they're not running a Ponzi scheme that has dominated the narrative. And that's a really silly accusation.
00:45:44.838 - 00:45:47.654, Speaker B: It's not a Ponzi. Something else. But it's not a Ponzi.
00:45:47.702 - 00:45:55.774, Speaker A: It's something else that's not a Ponzi. Yeah. And I've just listened to a bunch of debates about whether or not blast is a ponzi, and it's kind of a stupid conversation, actually.
00:45:55.972 - 00:46:17.218, Speaker B: I also think Tishan is, like, a good entrepreneur. Blur is like a good product, and if he ends up winning, nobody's going to remember that it started as a multi sig. Right. So it's kind of like too soon to tell, but also gets back to the CZ and Justin sun point where it's like nothing has happened yet.
00:46:17.304 - 00:46:23.880, Speaker D: But also, to be fair, optimism is multi. We haven't surpassed multi sigs here. It's just.
00:46:24.250 - 00:46:48.320, Speaker B: Yeah, no, but even though we haven't surpassed them, it feels like people are starting to get wise. I saw some hack happen on base, and my first reaction was like, ooh, how does Coinbase deal with you? Can. You can brick the withdrawal from the chain if you really want to.
00:46:50.850 - 00:47:00.066, Speaker A: Coinbase has a lot of interesting. There are a lot of interesting questions to be asked around how Coinbase will deal with stuff, frankly. Yeah.
00:47:00.248 - 00:47:05.380, Speaker B: In lawsuit is a quote of him saying it's better to ask for forgiveness than for.
00:47:09.750 - 00:47:20.326, Speaker A: I mean, maybe. Well, look at this. I mean, here's a very plausible scenario not to return to CZ. That could play out for him. Finance pays that massive fine. He pays his $50 million fine.
00:47:20.348 - 00:47:20.498, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:20.524 - 00:47:43.978, Speaker A: Which I think he had to settle with the CFTC, let's say we split the difference and say he gets, like, nine months of a house arrest type jail and he still retains control of finance. Was he right? Because he'll wake up in three years, he'll be able to operate finance again. It was a really high risk strategy that he ran.
00:47:44.074 - 00:47:57.406, Speaker C: It's like the Joe low billion dollar whale perspective of, like, if you get to be so big that you make $10 billion, you have to pay a billion dollar fine, but then you keep the nine true jho.
00:47:57.438 - 00:47:59.240, Speaker A: Low is kind of a different story.
00:48:01.130 - 00:48:03.238, Speaker C: Totally, but the concept of.
00:48:03.324 - 00:48:04.422, Speaker A: I mean, it's the same thing with.
00:48:04.476 - 00:48:29.738, Speaker C: Tether, too, to a certain extent. It's like they've gotten to be so big that any sort of ramifications are mincing storylines here. But I think finance has something like 6.5 billion of liquid assets on their balance sheet that people have been able to track down. So, yeah, it's two thirds of their balance sheet. Maybe they have more off chain, but it's definitely not as bad as it could have been and they get to continue to operate.
00:48:29.914 - 00:48:53.080, Speaker A: Cool. Maybe just because I'd love to get your guys opinions. I do want to. It's sort of related to blast, but I'd love to get your opinions on blur and kind of like NFT on chain market structure. I think it's a pretty. I'm going to share my screen here. And then, Sam, we're going to call on you to talk to us a little bit about what's been going on in the cosmos, because even for the typical cosmos governance drama, it's been a big week.
00:48:53.080 - 00:49:38.034, Speaker A: So I hadn't really been paying that much attention to nfts until pretty recently. But I was pretty surprised. I knew that blur had been doing well, but I didn't know that the market share has shifted so drastically. So in this past week, blur by volume had 78% of trading volume went through blur, compared to 17% at OpenC. And that, I can't really remember at one point what Openc used to have in terms of market share, but I think it was ninety s. Right. And you can actually see the same thing being replicated over in the salana ecosystem with tensor.
00:49:38.034 - 00:50:10.206, Speaker A: So tensor, it's an on chain marketplace. It's pretty small team, a couple of founders, and they've eaten all the market share away from Magic Eden as well. I'd be curious what you guys think about this because. Especially because. And how much this comes down to incentives and airdrop farming and the promise of token rewards. Because there's a huge decision that Opensea was being faced with when Blur launched. They were like, are we going to launch a token in response? They ultimately opted not to do that.
00:50:10.206 - 00:50:16.050, Speaker A: And to be honest, it looks like that was probably not the right decision. That was probably the wrong decision.
00:50:16.870 - 00:50:20.834, Speaker C: Openc revenue down 99% in the last 18 months.
00:50:20.952 - 00:50:22.210, Speaker A: Yeah, that's tough.
00:50:24.950 - 00:50:35.346, Speaker C: 50% of the team they let go of recently, they did a leadership off site recently. I mean, they're going to have to chart a new path forward. It's not like really a competition anymore.
00:50:35.378 - 00:51:15.860, Speaker A: I would say, damn, I will say this for Pacman. At some point in one of these Twitter threads that he's done recently, he sort of stated these two observation that he had that nfts, basically his whole thing is that you should treat nfts kind of like altcoins and there deserves to be an institutional grade perp market and it should be cheaper. And he really leaned into the sort of, to maybe be a little bit pejorative, like the all coins with pictures view of nfts. And I think at least for the current customer that exists and what people are using nfts for today, it looks like that was the right call.
00:51:16.390 - 00:51:52.960, Speaker C: I mean, the analogy that I think of is it's kind of like the, the marketplace for the long tail of assets versus Amazon, the place where you go and buy mean you can look at the relative market caps and I think know largely that trajectory is going to continue to play out. But Opensea has been a marketplace for individual assets. The financialization or the trading financialization of nfts has become blur. And sure, incentives hypercharge that transition, but I think that the strategy of that has definitely been the right strategy too.
00:51:54.210 - 00:52:30.880, Speaker B: I'm just looking at the actual nfts that have traded hands over the past month. There's like two kind of bigger moments. One was like the Yuga labs, like crypto punks announcement and all those floors getting swept. And then there's obviously mad lads on Solana, which is kind of popping off even today. And then there's basically some wash trading or smaller collections. I'm hesitant to make any definitive statements about the NFT market because there's really only three assets that you can buy. It's like crypto punks, board apes, fidenzas maybe.
00:52:30.880 - 00:53:07.078, Speaker B: We really think the NFT market is going to go in basically like the polar opposite direction of where it is today, like super low cost, more vertically oriented gaming nfts. And you don't need a perp to trade like a $2 sword in a game. You just need a spot market for that. And really, the perps only make sense with the high value asset class markets. And so it's like, how much do you believe in pfps being worth? $500,000. Persistently over ten collections, not just three. My confidence is low.
00:53:07.244 - 00:54:15.950, Speaker D: During the cycle when OpeNC was really top dog, there was this thing where Opensea was kind of your primary gallery as like an NFT holder. It's where you went to view and understand and kind of appreciate your collection. And that was actually like a key element of its success, in my opinion. And the combination of the market cratering and wallets and kind of specific gallery applications, like really maturing during that time period, I think actually shifts the kind of use case a bit. So Opensea isn't able to kind of rest on that user stickiness where they're like, oh, I want to look at my jpegs. You do that elsewhere. Now you do it in Rainbow Wallet, or you do it in one of these other venues that's a little bit more specifically designed for that purpose.
00:54:19.730 - 00:54:54.730, Speaker B: I can see a founder building like a super low cost, super low fee oriented at super low cost, again, items. And this becomes like the prosumer blur, becomes like the prosumer trading venue for people who want to speculate on Fidenzas being the next Picasso's. But that ladder market, while it's filled with prosumers, and that's generally what the market of crypto is filled with today, it doesn't expand infinitely the way that other asset classes do for nfts.
00:54:55.790 - 00:55:55.680, Speaker A: Yeah, you make a really good point. I will say, I think one of the things, maybe I'm a little bit hopeful about this, but I would hope that people in this cycle, because I am excited about nfts, I feel like they're going to come back at some point, but I hope people experiment a little bit on the model. I've chilled this to you guys a bunch, but what Luca nets is doing at pudgy penguins feels like he's sort of rewriting the NFT business model and playbook in a way that makes just an enormous amount of intuitive sense to me. So I think that's like one way that you could go kind of the e commerce, traditional ip build kind of way, and fit that around what nfts are, which I think I'm actually surprised more people aren't just copying what he's doing, but I think that's like one way you could go. But I do think there will be some amount, like, especially as you see other, there's a little mini NFT bubble going on in Solana right now. It's not just the lads, there's like queks and tensorians and stuff. And I think there is some amount of.
00:55:55.680 - 00:56:39.850, Speaker A: I don't know, as long as you have these different ecosystems with different characters and different communities, there will always be some amount of demand to be pride or emotional connection or community. And I think that's a big part of crypto, at least for the time being. One of the macro trends we're riding here is people feeling lonely and wanting to plug into communities online. And for that reason, I don't know, I can kind of see it. This is how I feel about the taproot wizards on bitcoin, too. I'm like, I feel like that's actually going to be a really successful NFT collection, and I'm rooting for them because I would love to see some changes get made in the bitcoin culture, honestly. And if they can plug those little tiny blocks with transactions, then that's great.
00:56:39.850 - 00:56:41.500, Speaker A: I view it as a win win.
00:56:42.590 - 00:56:51.454, Speaker B: There's only like one of those per chain. It's like crypto punks for eth, I guess. It's like taproot wizards for bitcoin. Maybe it's mad lads, but it's not.
00:56:51.492 - 00:56:53.386, Speaker A: Like, I hear you on this.
00:56:53.428 - 00:56:53.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:53.672 - 00:56:54.366, Speaker A: It's not infinite.
00:56:54.398 - 00:57:15.910, Speaker B: The problem with the altcoin with pictures analogy, it's like pithy and smart, but a, they're nowhere near the market cap of traditional altcoins, and B, there's nowhere near enough of them that are meaningfully sized. It's not really that. It's like a good marketing statement, but it's not the ground truth.
00:57:17.370 - 00:57:24.166, Speaker C: Fully agree with that. Also, when number go up, anything goes. Totally.
00:57:24.198 - 00:57:25.706, Speaker A: I think that's true too. Yeah.
00:57:25.888 - 00:57:32.800, Speaker B: Being a part of a community in the bull run is like bag of holding in the bear know, it's like all the same stuff.
00:57:33.410 - 00:57:56.450, Speaker D: Yeah. In the last NFT cycle, there was also, I mean, NFTs brought in a huge influx of new users, and they had certain cultural affiliations with these JPegs that they were kind of encountering for the first time. So there is potential to actually create new communities there, new JPEG holders.
00:57:57.690 - 00:58:33.374, Speaker A: You know what, just as someone who's like a media operator, I can kind of squint at NFTs and see something valuable, which is I'm not a lover of the overall model of media, which is like, eventually you get large enough as a media company where you have to kind of go like very broad. And then you start selling ads on a CPM basis and it's just super commoditized and it's a horrible business. There's like any number of examples. NFTs are like the opposite of that. It is 10,000 people or 5000 people that are like rabid, super engaged people. And it's not the same business model. You have to think about it a different way.
00:58:33.374 - 00:59:04.794, Speaker A: But just as someone who spent a lot of time trying to get people to engage with things, having that community of people that will just, I don't know, jump on a plane and go somewhere to an event or buy something just because they're part of a community, that's a valuable thing. And I think people will experiment with that idea and find new business models that make sense around it. But. Yeah, I hear you, Vance. It doesn't make sense for there to be infinite collections that just go up a million percent then. I'm with you on that.
00:59:04.832 - 00:59:06.742, Speaker B: Remember when we were fractionalizing nfts?
00:59:06.806 - 00:59:07.420, Speaker D: Because.
00:59:10.670 - 00:59:14.830, Speaker B: Follow the logic tree, it doesn't work. It doesn't make any sense.
00:59:14.980 - 00:59:17.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm with you on that. Okay.
00:59:17.588 - 00:59:20.350, Speaker B: Nfts, though, just not the current crop.
00:59:21.330 - 01:00:06.320, Speaker A: I think that's a fair take. Okay, Sam, I'm going to turn it over to you here because it's been a big week for Cosmos. There was a big prop that ended up getting passed through governance and maybe the most contentious on governance proposal that ever made it through cosmos, where the inflation rate was decreased by 10%. And this actually led to Jay, who's one of the original founders at Tendermint, to suggest a fork of the Cosmos hub. So for those of us who don't spend all their time in the cosmos, can you just give us the sort of the history of this proposition, why we're talking about decreasing the emissions rate, what that's supposed to do, and then talk us through this fork and how meaningful that may or may not be.
01:00:07.250 - 01:00:10.400, Speaker D: Yeah, happy to. I mean, how much time do you have?
01:00:12.130 - 01:00:13.220, Speaker B: 10 minutes.
01:00:14.230 - 01:00:17.970, Speaker C: We're an hour into the pod and we're getting into the core subject of it.
01:00:18.040 - 01:00:19.060, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
01:00:20.790 - 01:01:35.370, Speaker D: So one point of clarification before we start the prop was to decrease the target inflation rate, not the actual inflation rate. So I guess just like a little note about how the cosmos staking system works, or at least the cosmos hub and many of the cosmos chains follow this model. There is a target stake rate which is today 66%. And basically based on the number of stake tokens or the ratio of stake tokens, the inflation will modulate in order to kind of hit that target. And it does so kind of in this PId controller type fashion. So there's like a feedback model where it evaluates, am I close to the target? Am I above the target? If so, then I can decrease the amount of emissions incrementally. And if I'm below the target, I need to increase the amount of emissions in order to hit this 66% target.
01:01:35.370 - 01:03:00.950, Speaker D: So the vote was to change the kind of bounds on this targeting system so that the maximum amount of emissions that the system could reach was halved. And it does have an impact on validator revenues. The real revenues that validators are pulling in did change, but that number was not half due. So it's slightly different. This is kind of a long time coming and something that we have been talking about for basically ever since liquid staking was an idea, like multiple years. Basically, the whole premise of liquid staking is that you are going to issue this voucher for a staked position, and so you're removing the opportunity cost between staking and yield opportunities in the ecosystem. So theoretically, the stake ratio should increase.
01:03:00.950 - 01:03:18.330, Speaker D: You don't need to do the same kind of targeting because you should. Kind of. Naturally, people would be more inclined to have a liquid staked asset and put it in a yield farm somewhere.
01:03:19.230 - 01:03:51.410, Speaker A: So it's kind of like. Just to make sure I understand that, Sam. It's like the emissions were basically there to incentivize people to stake and not take the opportunity cost of potentially going and doing other things. Now that you have liquid staking, and there's the LSM, which is very successfully integrated that within the cosmos hub, then that opportunity cost doesn't exist. So to compensate for that, you can actually bring the target emissions down, because people aren't sacrificing that opportunity cost anymore.
01:03:51.570 - 01:05:10.400, Speaker D: Yeah, the targeting system just no longer really makes a lot of sense, in my opinion. This is kind of the difference of opinion that many in the causal ecosystem have with Jay. Jay is like pretty anti liquid staking from a principles based basis. Jay is also a very colorful, complex character and the kind of origin of a lot of the cosmos drama was Jay having some serious mental health issues that caused the entire engineering team to migrate to a new entity. There was this kind of great fragmentation that happened in order to kind of continue to build the core infrastructure. And so over the course of several years, a lot of the kind of key resources that were in and around all in bits, that this originating entity that Jay controlled have been kind of migrated elsewhere. I spent a bunch of time moving the trademark and DNS and things like this to a separate entity and going through all the kind of legal aspects of that.
01:05:10.400 - 01:05:58.490, Speaker D: It created a kind of environment of distrust between Jay and some of the other, really all of the other people in the ecosystem, which is really. So there's a lot to say there, but it is a complex kind of situation between Jay and a lot of the other core teams. I kind of spearheaded the Atom 2.0 initiative. He really came out strong against a number of the aspects that were. That were kind of described in that paper. It really assumed this, like, liquid staking world was going to exist.
01:05:58.490 - 01:06:52.898, Speaker D: And he fundamentally doesn't think that that's the direction that we should move. He has a kind of design in mind where there is no liquid staking. And actually, the atom token is kind of this internal asset that is primarily held by infrastructure providers and delegators. And a secondary token called the photon is issued off of the. Off the chain. So it's kind of like a meme coin that lives on top of the hub. And most people that I'm surrounded with felt like this was kind of a non viable option.
01:06:52.898 - 01:07:49.060, Speaker D: People don't really want this secondary token, they want some kind of representation of the kind of internal token of the network. So, yeah, it's really kind of like a philosophical difference about the core security system and the core kind of monetary, the connection between the monetary and security systems. And, yeah, this vote basically kind of drove Jay to want to experiment with fork. I don't personally think it has a lot of support from any other core team in the ecosystem or any very few validators or the consumer chains of the cosmos hub. I could be proven wrong there, but that's my read of the situation.
01:07:50.470 - 01:09:18.160, Speaker C: So it sounds like we're going to hit some sort of fort here at some point. And historically, if we think about the major forts that have happened historically, there's like, ethereum, ethereum classic, whenever that was, 2016, 2017, obviously, all the bitcoin stuff, but I'll leave that aside because we're not building apps on bitcoin. And then there was the proof of work, proof of stake with the merge. Obviously, proof of work chain got decimated immediately. The reasoning, I would say that Ethereum classic still exists in conjunction with Ethereum, the canonical chain, whereas Ethereum proof of work does not exist versus Ethereum proof of state, the canonical chain is because the variables that decide which chains will live on has fundamentally shifted back in 2016 2017 with classic it was really where the miners were going to be. How much hash power were you going to devote to the classic chain versus the canonical chain? Now you have an element of where are the applications going to decide to deploy their application and support that application going forward? The power has shifted away from validators, miners into where are the canonical examples of, like USDC? And I know cosmos is different. I'm just using Ethereum and the forks as example.
01:09:18.160 - 01:09:35.300, Speaker C: How would you say, what are the variables that you think will be in play for deciding which one of these becomes sort of like the canonical, or do you think it's an element of both will probably coexist? How would you think about that going forward?
01:09:36.090 - 01:10:41.370, Speaker D: Yeah, so one thing is tendermint. Now, comic BFT is a forklift protocol. So there will be a continuation of the chain that can be validated by anyone. And it's kind of the chain that we know today. Jay is going to have to spin up a new version of the chain and kind of get buy in for that chain. Basically, he's gonna have of the monetary asset is really like the most important thing here. And if Jay wants to make this atom one chain, the kind of canonical one, he would have to have all bridges change their pointer to hits chain and say that this is the correct representation.
01:10:41.370 - 01:11:29.990, Speaker D: That is a big ask. That's a lot of social buy in. To get that said, the cosmos architecture was designed for this. It is actually a system that encourages forking. That's part of the security model, actually. This is how you ensure that there is kind of minority representation in the system, and it provides a kind of check and balance. So the kind of credible threat to fork is very important in kind of ensuring some degree of internal regulation so that minority voices can actually express themselves within the application, within the chain.
01:11:29.990 - 01:12:19.880, Speaker D: So there is the ability to migrate these bridge pointers, I client id, and there's governance on all of these IBC connected chains. There's a parameter and you can change it like we built that. So I'm very know how that plays out. I'm glad that the capability exists, and it could actually, I don't know, heal some things. If Jay kind of pours his attention into this and feels like he's able to kind of execute on his.
01:12:22.250 - 01:13:17.818, Speaker A: Sorry, I was going to ask you guys, I've been actually going back and listening to old episodes of Episode center because I found an episode and I was like, oh, these are actually really good. They went on, like, a great run from late 2016 to 2018, 2019. And I listened to a lot of interviews that they did during the bitcoin block size war. So as the bitcoin block size war was, like, heating up, and when it got to its zenith, when it was really contentious and I actually had a lot of takeaways from it, but the one thing that everyone was extremely nervous about was the possibility of a hard fork. And the reason why people were worried about that was because it destroys the immutable value proposition or store of wealth value proposition of something like bitcoin, which is a little bit bitcoin specific, but also it would break the network effect of bitcoin. This was a big argument, right? So now if you have two chains, you don't really know how it's going to shake out in terms of miners and hash power. But also some developers might go on chain one versus chain two.
01:13:17.818 - 01:14:14.634, Speaker A: People won't know which is the main one, and you'll just divide the network effect that you've accrued and built up, I do kind of wonder. This is obviously the counterfactual, and there's no real way to prove this. You could argue that that's really scary and you don't kind of want to have to deal with that, but maybe there would be some sort of healthy elements to that. And actually one takeaway that I had going back and listening to the bitcoin block size wars. And maybe this is a heretical thing to say, because now the perception of it is like there were these heroic little blockers that fought off these corrupt sort of big block companies, but at the time, the way that it was, and I wasn't paying an enormous amount of attention to it at the time, but it does feel like actually going back. There were at least two separate perspectives. Like, you could construct the argument, right? I don't think it was like these evil, rapacious people who came in and tried to mess up this good network.
01:14:14.634 - 01:14:51.014, Speaker A: I think there were actual legitimate arguments on the other side. And maybe if it had been. I mean, I guess there were multiple fork attempts after this, but I don't know. I think there maybe is another future out there where that big block bitcoin sort of forked and became something sort of more interesting. And actually, a lot of those proponents became influential in other projects, like Eamon from Avalanche was kind of more in that community. So I don't really know what my point is here. First of all, I would recommend people go back and listen to that as a unique moment in history.
01:14:51.014 - 01:15:12.254, Speaker A: But also, I'd just be curious how you guys think about forks and whether or not they're threats to the chain, or maybe it's a way of actually just the community grows big enough at some point that your tent is too big. Not everyone is marching in the same direction. And it's kind of like a natural way to say, hey, you guys, go do your thing. Pursue your vision. We're going to go do our thing. Pursue our vision. The best vision is going to win.
01:15:12.254 - 01:15:20.180, Speaker A: Or maybe we could just be coexist. Even so, I don't know. That's where my head went when I was thinking about these forks. Because I think.
01:15:24.790 - 01:15:52.542, Speaker D: Credible threat of a fork is still part of the bitcoin security model. You can't get away from a fork. It has to be in the conversation. It has to be out there somewhere. It has to be entertained. Same thing with ethereum, kind of discussing the possibility of forking if there was sufficient censorship. The threat of the fork is super important and the capability is super important.
01:15:52.542 - 01:15:55.630, Speaker D: It's kind of like a mutually sure destruction scenario.
01:15:58.050 - 01:16:03.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. Vance, Michael, I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on any of this.
01:16:04.550 - 01:16:21.510, Speaker B: I haven't paid enough attention to cosmos. My last experience with a fork was the ETH proof of work fork, which was. There wasn't a separate community. Turns out it was just Chandler glow and 16 different he was wearing.
01:16:23.930 - 01:16:42.458, Speaker A: Do you remember people were saying some funny stuff before that fork? They were like, oh, if there's a fork, then there are going to be punks on the proof of work chain, which is technically the canonical chain, and they're going to grief like the punks on the proof of stake chain. And there were lots of conversations about this, and then none of that stuff ended up happening or being meaningful at all. No. A little bit.
01:16:42.544 - 01:16:44.714, Speaker B: Just a scam. That's all it was.
01:16:44.912 - 01:16:49.630, Speaker D: There is the MEv between the different exchange rates and different exchanges.
01:16:50.290 - 01:17:01.940, Speaker B: Yeah, it felt like that was like the last techno grift of the last cycle. Everyone was just trying to squeeze that last dollar out of it and go on vacation. But we'll see.
01:17:02.390 - 01:17:11.910, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. Just in closing, do you guys see that clip to take us totally out of crypto of Elon Musk telling advertisers to go.
01:17:12.060 - 01:17:14.470, Speaker B: Love it. I was like, your Disney subscription.
01:17:15.450 - 01:17:21.434, Speaker C: I told Vance, I woke up this morning and checked to see if I still even had a Disney plus subscription and deleted it.
01:17:21.632 - 01:17:22.380, Speaker A: Really?
01:17:22.750 - 01:17:25.930, Speaker B: Elon is so based. I'm so glad he owns Twitter.
01:17:26.350 - 01:17:45.386, Speaker A: Okay, I was actually going to say that is actually not the most unhinged thing did you guys see the Kyberswap exploit? And the letter that the Kyberswap exploiter sent? That is like an entirely new level of sociopathy unlocked by that Kyber executives.
01:17:45.578 - 01:17:47.842, Speaker C: Thank you for your time. You've done great work.
01:17:47.976 - 01:17:59.160, Speaker A: Don't let the exit stop you from leaving. You know what the little thing that got me was like, yeah. You know what could have happened? Anyone. Wasn't your fault. You were good at your jobs. But nevertheless, I'm going to surrounding error, up or down.
01:18:00.010 - 01:18:03.906, Speaker D: Crypto is nothing if not entertaining. I mean, that is gold.
01:18:04.098 - 01:18:05.126, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
01:18:05.228 - 01:18:06.806, Speaker B: Yeah, leave it at.
01:18:06.988 - 01:18:12.390, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. All right, fellas. Good one. Thanks, Sam, for joining us. This was fun, guys.
01:18:12.540 - 01:18:13.220, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you.
