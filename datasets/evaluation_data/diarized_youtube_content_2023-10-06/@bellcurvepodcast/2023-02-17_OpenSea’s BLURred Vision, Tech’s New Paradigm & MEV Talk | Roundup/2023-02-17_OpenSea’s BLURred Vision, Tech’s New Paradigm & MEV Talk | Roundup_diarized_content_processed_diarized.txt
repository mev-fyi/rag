00:00:33.596 - 00:00:34.294, Speaker C: Happy to be here.
00:00:34.332 - 00:00:35.366, Speaker A: Pleasure to be here.
00:00:35.468 - 00:00:37.926, Speaker B: Got Yano in all his HD glory over there.
00:00:38.028 - 00:00:39.286, Speaker D: Five k. Thank you.
00:00:39.308 - 00:00:40.950, Speaker A: Michael, number two. Michael, number two.
00:00:41.100 - 00:00:44.200, Speaker D: Five k. Yeah. Every four.
00:00:45.310 - 00:00:47.290, Speaker A: You're getting all of me right now.
00:00:47.440 - 00:00:50.250, Speaker B: I'm afraid to sit in that seat. I don't think I'm good looking.
00:00:50.320 - 00:00:53.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually don't like I'm going back to like, the old school zoom camera.
00:00:53.798 - 00:00:58.686, Speaker C: Yeah, you don't need to turn on the background blur. It's just blur in general.
00:00:58.788 - 00:01:06.126, Speaker B: Yeah, we're building out that. There's a nice little plant in the background there. The studio is coming together pretty nicely. Yeah, a couple of plants.
00:01:06.318 - 00:01:07.522, Speaker D: Little plants for sure.
00:01:07.576 - 00:01:09.010, Speaker B: That's a fun size plant.
00:01:11.590 - 00:01:12.286, Speaker A: Budget, baby.
00:01:12.318 - 00:01:17.090, Speaker B: If you hold that just right, it actually looks big enough that yeah, no.
00:01:17.160 - 00:01:18.370, Speaker C: You watering that every day.
00:01:18.440 - 00:01:26.706, Speaker A: Actually, when we moved into the office, we got like six real plants and we've killed them all. So now mandatory no real plants allowed at blockworks.
00:01:26.738 - 00:01:41.226, Speaker C: One of our portfolio companies sent us two potted bulbs for the holidays. I proceeded to water it. Hasn't sprouted anything yet. Vance also hasn't opened that box.
00:01:41.328 - 00:01:42.874, Speaker A: You don't got that magic touch.
00:01:42.992 - 00:01:43.370, Speaker C: Yes.
00:01:43.440 - 00:01:46.110, Speaker B: No, you don't have the green thumb.
00:01:47.090 - 00:01:50.330, Speaker C: It's been raining a lot in San Francisco. There's not much sunlight.
00:01:50.490 - 00:01:52.222, Speaker D: Yeah, those are dead for sure.
00:01:52.276 - 00:02:18.840, Speaker B: All right, let's start with markets this week. It's been a big week for markets, especially in crypto. So just looking at kind of the majors, like, in the last seven days, bitcoin is up 7.5%, ETH is up 3%, seoul is up 1.7%. But on the month, it's much better. Bitcoin is up 16%, ETH is up 8%, and Seoul is actually just about even. So it's basically been the first positive price action in a little while.
00:02:18.840 - 00:02:35.022, Speaker B: I know a lot of people are ascribing this to the news about finance and their settlement, their civil settlement, or the Wall Street Journal basically came out and said there's just going to be civil penalties. I don't think this is necessarily confirmed yet, but what is your guys thoughts on why markets have been so positive this week?
00:02:35.076 - 00:03:19.046, Speaker D: So the CPI came in hot, right? And then labor jobs was pretty hot. And then I think we got something today, the PPI, which was way hotter than people think or thought it would be. So it's like not the best setup, but at the same time, you just have all of this mean reversion. You have what seems to be a little bit more liquidity in the general market. And so you look at things like the tenure, which is one of our main things that we look at. It still has not repeat despite the terminal rates and generally what the Fed saying they're going to do, being much more aggressive than last year. So it's interesting, there's a bunch of different signals, but crypto was just so beaten down last year that it's not exactly surprising to see it catch a little bit of a bid.
00:03:19.046 - 00:03:21.978, Speaker D: Just generally seems like we're grinding up in this range.
00:03:22.154 - 00:04:06.140, Speaker C: I would say totally agree with all that. The other thing that I would say is that our perspective is that markets move about six months before economic data becomes reality. People are going to always try to front run the change. They're going to try and see when's the bottom forming. And the specific data to crypto is a lot of derisking of what had been rumored for a long time, which is all the changes that we saw this week in terms of regulatory action. There was sort of this consternation that Kraken was taken down. Okay, they have to pay a $30 million fee, shelve their staking business for retail customers in the US.
00:04:06.140 - 00:04:56.060, Speaker C: But it's not a death blow. The custody rule and the proposed change from the SEC came out yesterday. Yeah, it's definitely not great, but it's also something that we'll have to deal with and it's basically a realization of all the things that could have happened happening and realizing that all the bad stuff is what it is and it's out there in the public now. And so I think that derisking is a big thing. And to your point, Mike, the chief Strategy officer of Binance, an interview I think yesterday or maybe the day before, said that they are planning to pay all civil penalties and that's going to be the end of it. In terms of the finance issues with the DOJ potentially SEC, and that derisking I think is a huge catalyst as well. But up until about 24 hours ago, crypto was down.
00:04:56.060 - 00:05:10.190, Speaker C: January was a great month, crypto was up. Over the last few days, crypto was down, but in the last 24 hours, crypto is up. So just moves wildly with the whims of all the different news and stuff that's coming out.
00:05:10.260 - 00:05:43.082, Speaker B: It's just funny because the markets basically had to digest a lot of contradictory information. So at the same time that you got the sort of finance risk being taken off the market, which it's not official yet, but it looks like it's just going to be a fine that they plan to pay. You had, you know, some pretty hostile announcements coming out of the SEC. How big is the QC sort of change? And actually, could you guys just explain what that is? Who is that relevant for maybe specifically as it pertains to Raas. And also even if you could just do a refresh on what it means to be a qualified custodian and that sort of thing.
00:05:43.136 - 00:06:21.042, Speaker C: Yeah. So we are a registered investment advisor with the SEC, anyone who and there's a couple of different exemptions. If you're a true venture capital firm and you only invest in corporate equity, you can have an exemption to be an RIA with the SEC. Most funds even like traditional web two funds because they want to dabble in liquid equities or hold securities of companies that have gone public. They have become raas as well. Crypto firms have to become Raas as soon as you pass the $150,000,000 AUM threshold. So most firms that you know today are Raas.
00:06:21.042 - 00:07:07.682, Speaker C: What that comes with is we are regulated by the SEC and that comes with a lot of oversight, controls, regulations, compliance that we have to abide by. Part of that includes the necessity that we have to keep all of our digital assets at qualified custodians. And to be a QC, there are a couple different ways that you can get there. First is you can be a bank. Most banks don't custody crypto assets or if they do, it's just bitcoin. You can be a trust company and I don't know all the details, but effectively you can be a national trust or a state trust as well as you can be a state bank and you can have a banking charter. But all of these different types of designations make you a qualified custodian.
00:07:07.682 - 00:07:51.122, Speaker C: So what we use is Anchorage as well as Coinbase Prime. And Coinbase Prime is a separate subsidiary of Coinbase Incorporated where they are a trust company. And they believe that even with these new changes, they will continue to be a qualified custodian and we pay them to custody all the digital assets that are tradable and frankly, that they support Anchorage the same thing. And what this new rule proposes is that there's just going to be higher levels of requirements for qualified custodians that previously weren't in place. And it's 470 pages. We haven't really dug into it. It just came out about 24 hours ago.
00:07:51.122 - 00:08:37.342, Speaker C: But basically it's just going to put higher levels of requirements for qualified custodians, which means it doesn't really change our day to day business whatsoever. As long as there's a qualified custodian that can custody our assets, we're going to use them. It may limit the scope, limit the field in terms of who is QC that we can actually work with. Anchorage supports most assets, coinbase prime supports a lot of other assets. And if they continue to be in the qualified custodian status, then we're just going to continue to use them. It makes it difficult for other firms to be able to actually become qualified custodians. But yeah, I think really it was a lot of requirements, a lot of stuff that goes into what is a QC and how you become a QC but really doesn't change our day to day that much.
00:08:37.476 - 00:09:15.520, Speaker B: Yeah, and just to be clear as well, this is just a proposal at this stage. There was a vote from the SEC, it was four to one. Hester Purse was the only one that dissented. But right now, basically it's open for comment in two weeks. And just because this has been proposed doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to become it's just, it seems like it's a tactic right, to make it just that much harder for US firms to invest in crypto. Because even if Coinbase and Fireblocks and some of the other custodians out there get this become qualified custodians, they can't support every asset right, that Ras might want to invest in. So then it just puts firms that hold these liquid assets on their balance sheet in a kind of a weird position.
00:09:16.530 - 00:10:10.800, Speaker C: One point of clarification is that Fireblocks is not a qualified custodian. That's an MPC Custody solution. There's also a number of assets that we have that are tradable that are not supported by qualified custodians just because they might have different token models or mechanics that aren't supported by Anchorage or Coinbase Prime quite yet. So we actually do use Fireblocks in the case that we have digital assets that we're not able to custody places. But frankly, what this means is that you're just going to have to have a higher level, higher bar to become a QC. And yeah, I think the reading of the tea leaves is that there's just a lot of consternation with regulators right now and trying to figure out ways of cutting off investment and cutting off access and cutting off basically capital for crypto. And choke point is the phrase that's been batted around and this is one of those.
00:10:13.570 - 00:10:29.010, Speaker A: What's the registration that you guys have to file? Are you an RIA or register? Yeah. Okay. If an RIA has to custody assets at a QC, but a QC can't custody the long tail of tokens, does this then reduce the capital that flows into the long tail of tokens?
00:10:29.090 - 00:11:05.470, Speaker D: Not everyone is going to want to take that same amount of risk and not everyone is set up to there's ways to comply with this rule that are kind of strange. Like you can find a foreign financial institution that's equivalent of a QC, but what if that means putting your assets in a custodian in Brazil or London? That's not going to fly for the largest firms on the planet, but for the crypto firms who are willing to go to links to get there, they will do that. And so it's going to make it just harder for the institutional money to really come in and dabble with things at a deep level.
00:11:05.540 - 00:11:53.962, Speaker C: One of the things that I think is actually pretty interesting, we have a couple of friends who are traditional web, two investors. There's always this question of where do you custody your assets? Nobody really thinks about that when it comes to web two shares. And what most firms actually do is that they have a safe in the middle of their office and that's where they keep literally the share certificates of all the investments that they've made. That's how they custody their assets. It's self custody. There's no bank that's going to take private company at Series A XYZ and you have to maintain those records, you have to maintain those books and she has to keep them somewhere. And I'd say because we are registered and most venture firms in the web two status are just not Raas.
00:11:53.962 - 00:12:14.790, Speaker C: So they do have an exempt status. But it is interesting to think about where do you custody your assets? Where do firms actually custody their assets? If you're an RAA, you have a higher bar and that means the SEC is going to be checking on it. But it's a lot better than what I think most firms do, which is like if there's a fire, if there's water damage, do you lose equity ownership?
00:12:15.210 - 00:12:15.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:18.010 - 00:12:56.846, Speaker B: The macro stuff that you were talking about there before Vance as well because the other data point that people are paying attention to is retail sales which came in that was like a super hot number that was like 3% or something like that. Month over, month over the 1.9% expected. So basically if you don't pay a lot of attention to this data, it's kind of like good economic news is bad news because the more good economic news that comes in the more it theoretically means to the Fed and Powell that they have leeway to kind of hike rates. They've been very clear that they don't want necessarily a hot economy right now. So it is kind of weird. There definitely are some kind of overhangs.
00:12:56.846 - 00:13:24.080, Speaker B: It almost seems like the economic data is starting to pick up a little bit faster than the Fed might want and there definitely are these weird regulatory overhangs as well. But the market is kind of like starting to shrug that off or power through it, which a small part of my brain is like maybe that's actually kind of bullish, right? Like markets love to climb like walls of worry but at the same time maybe this is just, I don't know, sort of a small bounce and mean reversion from a horrendous year.
00:13:25.570 - 00:14:00.634, Speaker D: Here's how I think about it. I know that inflation is going down. A lot of our friends are trying to negotiate decreases in their rent. I know people who are buying a used car who got it very cheap, like all the layoffs that are around us. Like the labor market doesn't seem that strong. The lived experience that I have is telling me that yeah, sure, like CPI is high right now, but the largest component was shelter. And maybe this is just a Bay Area thing, but the real estate market here is really weak right now, and it feels the same way in places like Chicago and New York and Miami, especially.
00:14:00.634 - 00:14:34.594, Speaker D: So it seems like the prices are going down. I just don't buy this wage price spiral. Inflation is going back up to 10%. And so I think that's kind of what people are subconsciously thinking through. And then the fact that the tenure is not repeating when the terminal rate is so much higher. The rest of the market seems to agree with that stance, and everything is front run rate cuts, recessions risk, assets falling apart. The first ones in are generally the first ones out, and I think you're also seeing that.
00:14:34.594 - 00:14:41.766, Speaker D: So I don't know. It's kind of not surprising to me in general, even though the data is a little bit mixed at the moment.
00:14:41.948 - 00:15:29.030, Speaker B: Speaking of broader trends, I think, Michael, you can start to do a little bit of an initial victory lap on your call of tech transitioning from growth into value. I think you kind of dropped this in our chat, but Brad Gerstner tweeted something out. So Brad Gersner is one of the founders at Alternative. He was the run that kind of wrote that shareholder letter to Meta that got a little bit of traction, but he had a tweet about Twilio. She said, Twilio Q four efficiency migrating from a growth company to a profitable growth company, cutting perks, including sabbaticals new structure, 17% riff, and accelerated path to profits plus a $1 billion buyback. CEO personally buying $10 million. Also, one of the interesting ones to look at is Elliot Management, which took a board seat kind of quietly back for salesforce a month back.
00:15:29.030 - 00:15:39.174, Speaker B: And Jason, I have a friend who works at Salesforce, and it has been like a complete sea change night and day difference. So you're very directionally correct on that one.
00:15:39.212 - 00:16:10.814, Speaker C: So far, so good on that 2023 prediction. I think you can kind of assess the macro, which is the Twilio's and the salesforces. A lot of the in Meta, too. So Brad was the one that coined that sea change at Meta. Seems like they're actually following through with just about every single thing that he said. They're doing a $9 billion buyback, I believe, and it's sort of a question as to where they get that capital. The way they get that capital is by reducing know, RIF and Anecdotally.
00:16:10.814 - 00:16:48.506, Speaker C: We have friends at Meta. We have friends at salesforce. Both companies are gearing up for two, potentially three more rafs this year. It's just going to be the purge of, I think, a lot of the bloat that we saw over the last three years. And a lot of what this kind of stems from is, okay, are tech companies able to hit earnings? Are they going to be the canaries in the coal mine of this hard landing potential that we're seeing? In reality, I think that they're doing fine. They haven't really missed earnings to a large extent. They've definitely kind of pulled back a little bit of their guidance.
00:16:48.506 - 00:17:33.322, Speaker C: But I think this is an opportunity for them to right size the ship and figure out where they're going and have high profitability be the benchmark that they're evaluated against in 2023, which is completely opposite from the high growth that they were evaluated over the last three years. So I find it to be patently interesting. It's also going to change the dynamics of the tech industry. It's going to change the dynamics of anybody who's living anywhere near the tech industry, like the Bay Area. You just start to see these mass reductions in force. It's tough to find a job in tech right now, and it's going to continue to be that way for a while. But I think that this is going to be the opportunity that tech has to be able to actually build world class businesses and return value to shareholders.
00:17:33.322 - 00:17:34.910, Speaker C: It's going to be really interesting to watch.
00:17:34.980 - 00:17:51.282, Speaker B: What's the deal, you think, with these staggered riffs? Because I thought the thing you're supposed to do is do cut once, cut deep, so that people aren't afraid for their jobs anymore. It seems like there are these staggered, like, 7% reductions which don't make a lot of sense to me.
00:17:51.416 - 00:18:11.734, Speaker C: Well, actually, I think it should be exactly as you described in the latter example there, which is, let's find out who's actually working, let's find out who's performing. Let's find out who actually needs to be in their jobs. And if you rock the boat a little bit and then you say, hey, another one's coming, another 12%, another 10%, another 5% is coming.
00:18:11.932 - 00:18:12.870, Speaker B: Who wants it?
00:18:12.940 - 00:18:26.670, Speaker C: Who wants to be part of the continued force? Who wants to go to business school? Who wants to get out of the company? Who wants to go off and find a startup? I think it's actually the right call to do these in staggered form just because you find out who the high performers are.
00:18:26.740 - 00:18:46.338, Speaker D: Tesla is logging keystrokes of workers now at HQ. I don't know about you, Michael, but if my keystrokes were logged when we were at Netflix, it would show me doing good work probably 60%, 70% of the time. But listen, there's a lot of just like downtime at these technology companies.
00:18:46.504 - 00:19:11.050, Speaker C: Totally. I mean, listen, my boss at Snap, first meeting I had with him, step into his office and figure out what I'm doing, his perspective was like, listen, get your job done. Hit your KPIs, hit your goals. Every quarter, if we're ever in the same meeting, something has gone wrong. Think of me as the chairman, you're the CEO, whatever you own, and that's it. I don't care if you come to work. I don't care if you do this, but just hit your goals.
00:19:11.050 - 00:19:30.850, Speaker C: I think if you have that mentality of ownership but not management, it can work for certain people. But yeah, there are definitely days where I was off doing other things. And you don't need to if you hit those goals. I mean, crypto was pumping in 2017.
00:19:34.810 - 00:19:37.110, Speaker B: Somebody had to load those bags up with Litecoin.
00:19:40.410 - 00:19:41.794, Speaker C: XRP Army.
00:19:41.922 - 00:19:54.166, Speaker B: XRP army, baby. Yeah. That's going to go down as a hallmark of 2021, I feel like, is the day in the life of the TikTok product manager or whatever so painful?
00:19:54.278 - 00:20:17.566, Speaker D: Painful. Those are not aging gracefully. It feels like technology has largely taken the medicine of a lot of rate increases and just people getting a little bit softer on the asset class in general. It seems pretty great. Imagine if all of these businesses are super efficient and keep scaling. That was kind of the bargain that we at least sold people from the start. And it's nice to see it getting there's.
00:20:17.598 - 00:20:27.362, Speaker B: It's funny. There's like a a just because Charlie Munger is out in force this week, but I actually love Charlie Munger by the like, he's got a great almanac, and I like Buffett among her.
00:20:27.416 - 00:20:28.786, Speaker D: I've never read that.
00:20:28.968 - 00:20:33.942, Speaker B: Yeah, he's got some sayings that you're like, yeah, it's like kind of folksy wisdom sort of saying.
00:20:33.996 - 00:20:49.420, Speaker C: I mean, listen, he is the person that coined you. Show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome. Give him credit where credit is due. But at the same time, he's 94 and has no idea what he's talking matter. As soon as you hit over 90.
00:20:50.350 - 00:20:53.854, Speaker A: It'S a big nothing burger having a 99 year old comment on technology.
00:20:54.052 - 00:20:55.982, Speaker C: Exactly. Come on, guys.
00:20:56.036 - 00:20:57.440, Speaker A: I don't care who you are.
00:20:58.530 - 00:21:03.280, Speaker D: Why is he doing this? Which part of his team is like, you know what?
00:21:05.170 - 00:21:10.660, Speaker A: If I saw this, I'd be like, new tech that the kids are playing with? Let me just stay out of it.
00:21:11.350 - 00:21:13.700, Speaker C: I've been out of the game for 30 years.
00:21:14.950 - 00:21:17.860, Speaker D: Is he still investing? No. Is.
00:21:19.770 - 00:21:21.842, Speaker C: He'S still number two at Berkshire?
00:21:21.906 - 00:21:36.262, Speaker B: I would love to be a fly on the wall during those discussions they have. Imagine how long a conversation between the two of those guys you literally can conversation must take. You're saying, actually, it's the 99 year old and the 95 year old.
00:21:36.396 - 00:21:52.702, Speaker A: My grandma was like, 95. I went to see my grandma before she passed a couple of years ago. And she's like, I think she was 94, 95. And she didn't know, obviously, what Uber or Snapchat or any of that stuff was. And I was like, all right, Grandma, I'm going to call an Uber. And she's like, well, what's Uber? And I showed it to her on my phone. She's like, oh, that's so cool.
00:21:52.702 - 00:21:56.590, Speaker A: Show me all these apps. I was using Snap like five years ago or four years.
00:21:56.740 - 00:21:58.766, Speaker C: So it was like Snap back when Snap was cool.
00:21:58.868 - 00:22:15.094, Speaker A: Back when Snap was cool. Yeah, don't throw me under the bus for still using Snap and like, Uber and all these things. She just looks at me. She goes, but doesn't that mean, someone's always tracking you. Yes, grandma like, wow, we have given up the whole trackability. But that was the first thing.
00:22:15.132 - 00:22:16.600, Speaker D: That's actually the business model.
00:22:19.370 - 00:22:20.680, Speaker B: You are the product.
00:22:21.690 - 00:22:24.466, Speaker A: All privacy for efficiency, Grandma.
00:22:24.498 - 00:22:32.422, Speaker C: That's right. Yeah. Hats off to them for making an investment in Apple, but that's the closest that they've gotten to tech in five decades.
00:22:32.486 - 00:22:37.040, Speaker B: So what are you going to do? I mean, it doesn't really I agree, it's kind of a nothing burger in general.
00:22:37.730 - 00:22:59.678, Speaker C: Also, it wasn't even Warren or Charlie that made the investment in Apple. You know that. It was like their lieutenant who basically pounded the table and was like, we have to do this. And that's been their number one investment in history. Berkshire Hathaway peddling corn syrup and caffeine to kids. Most money made on iPhones.
00:22:59.774 - 00:23:07.266, Speaker B: And the reason he did it too is because that's when Apple launched their huge buyback program. It wasn't even like a bet on the tech. It was just the buybacks.
00:23:07.378 - 00:23:08.040, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:23:08.410 - 00:23:08.918, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:09.004 - 00:23:09.890, Speaker C: We talked blur.
00:23:09.970 - 00:23:33.390, Speaker B: Okay, so the overview is that Blur, it's an NFT marketplace and aggregator, and it launched its own token on Wednesday or did an AirDrop. So it dropped to over 33,000 unique wallets. There's a lot of volatility that followed. Bids came in around $5. They dipped as low as fifty cents and then they settled just under a dollar. I think that puts Blur at about a 300 million dollar market cap.
00:23:33.540 - 00:23:37.090, Speaker D: And you've had 2.7 fully diluted.
00:23:37.510 - 00:23:44.318, Speaker C: So this is exactly the topic that I was going to bring up, which is how do you guys stand on market cap versus fully diluted?
00:23:44.494 - 00:23:46.338, Speaker D: Oh my God. There's only one right answer.
00:23:46.424 - 00:23:47.154, Speaker C: Please.
00:23:47.352 - 00:23:48.238, Speaker B: Fully diluted.
00:23:48.254 - 00:23:50.942, Speaker A: Is that fully you got to say it's FTV seven.
00:23:51.096 - 00:23:53.238, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, exactly.
00:23:53.404 - 00:23:58.678, Speaker B: There's circulating supply and then there's market cap. But yeah, FTV and market cap are the same thing 100%.
00:23:58.764 - 00:24:06.294, Speaker D: It's also usually a sign when people start saying like, fully diluted is a meme. Don't worry about that. It's like, oh yeah, you're about to keep them unaudited.
00:24:06.342 - 00:24:07.900, Speaker A: You would like that, wouldn't you?
00:24:11.150 - 00:24:13.310, Speaker C: I'll dump on your fully diluted.
00:24:15.010 - 00:24:28.702, Speaker D: Listen, people are launching tokens. They're trading NFTs like it's 2021. There's dog coins, there's AI coins. It's kind of pandemonium right now. The burn on ETH is gigantic. There's 4500 ETH that been burnt today, I think. Openc, the main story is openc.
00:24:28.702 - 00:24:30.270, Speaker D: Just like fumbling the bag.
00:24:30.430 - 00:24:34.258, Speaker A: They got to figure it out. If they don't figure something out soon, they're just going to get run over.
00:24:34.344 - 00:24:41.094, Speaker D: I mean, most of the people that I know that trade NFTs are trading the monblur. It feels like that's become the yeah.
00:24:41.132 - 00:24:43.382, Speaker A: I don't know many people who use OpenSea anymore. No.
00:24:43.436 - 00:25:15.498, Speaker D: It's become the primary market for price discovery. And once you lose price discovery as an exchange, it's extremely hard to get it back. Like, Bittrex used to be the main venue for all altcoin price discovery. And then there was like a three month period where finance launched and it just never came back. That can very easily happen to a lot of exchanges, especially that don't have the huge pro traders. Openc is now, I would say, like long tail retail for the most part. And in 2021, I remember one of our LPs was reaching out to us to get Openc secondary.
00:25:15.498 - 00:25:34.582, Speaker D: We were like, we didn't invest. He was like, yeah, I know, but can you get any? It's like no. What? Even at 13 and a half billion, the last valuation. So it just goes to show you how kind of far they've fallen. Blur seems expensive, but I don't know. I would say it's probably the number one NFT marketplace. Right now.
00:25:34.636 - 00:26:18.246, Speaker C: It is the number one NFT marketplace, but at the same time, NFTs, you don't have the same aggregation of liquidity problem as you do with fungible assets. Where I see the future of NFTs actually being traded in more of a bespoke way, where you're going to have individual marketplaces for individual verticalized systems. verticalized marketplaces. Right now, all we're talking about is like PFPs, and that's really all that Blur has. But I think the future, especially with ecosystem tokens or utility tokens with NFTs, that's going to get traded in a different venue than Blur or Openc. So I see the fragmentation actually happening a lot quicker in NFTs. Blur definitely has the eye in the sun right now, but I don't know.
00:26:18.246 - 00:26:21.346, Speaker C: I mean, at 2.7 billion fully diluted.
00:26:21.378 - 00:26:24.466, Speaker D: There'S also a lot of incentives driving a lot of this volume.
00:26:24.498 - 00:26:24.934, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:26:25.052 - 00:26:41.050, Speaker D: There's like another season of Airdrops. This strategy works until it doesn't. And we've seen things like X two, Y two and looks rare, all kind of begin the start of this playbook in a very positive way, and now they're a couple of hundred fully diluted.
00:26:42.670 - 00:26:49.200, Speaker C: Okay, here's a question. Where do you think Blur versus Openc volume will be in six months from now once the Airdrops are done?
00:26:50.050 - 00:26:52.786, Speaker B: What is it? I don't know what they are both right now, it's two to one.
00:26:52.808 - 00:26:53.074, Speaker C: Right now.
00:26:53.112 - 00:27:12.230, Speaker D: Blur to openc, I would say probably 50%. Blur and then Openc has double their volume. But volume isn't really the best proxy here because Blur doesn't have these massive fees.
00:27:13.450 - 00:27:16.758, Speaker C: Blur has 0.5%, Openc has 2.5.
00:27:16.844 - 00:27:40.046, Speaker D: Right? I mean, you can finance five X, the amount of wash trading on Blur versus Openc for the same dollar value fees. So you're always going to have that. I think you're always going to have people who are incentivized to wash trade. Like, look at dYdX. There's still so much wash trading there, even though the incentives are pretty stale at this point and probably going to end soon. So it's kind of hard to tell.
00:27:40.148 - 00:27:46.290, Speaker A: What'S going on with the royalties debate right now. Do Blur and OpenSea come at it from different positions?
00:27:47.110 - 00:27:48.962, Speaker D: Actually don't know where they settled on this.
00:27:49.016 - 00:27:56.150, Speaker A: I think Blur was like, no royalties OpenSea. Was up. I know they approached it differently.
00:27:56.890 - 00:28:02.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Blur has the ability to have royalties, but it's not something.
00:28:02.652 - 00:28:43.966, Speaker B: That'S forced I don't know what you guys think about royalties. I'm personally on the boat that if you create such a value enough collection, then you can demand that. But I don't think a big one of the things that I don't think is well understood in the NFT community is there's a huge power law when it comes to content creation. As like we were talking about in the context of VC, it exists in sales and engineering or whatever, but like content, there's an extreme power law. So I think I know this isn't the answer that people want to hear, but it's like the top 1% or probably less, probably like 0.1% of creators will be able to command that and the rest I don't think there's going to be a royalty.
00:28:44.158 - 00:28:53.638, Speaker C: Listen, royalties are just a new business model. If you have the ability to command a royalty, you should take it. If you don't, and that's not your business model, you shouldn't have one.
00:28:53.724 - 00:29:18.510, Speaker D: Yeah, you're also going to see a bunch of roll ups that are only royalties you can't trade NFTs without. And like, you're seeing even some of that stuff play out in Kanto. Right? If you if you can demand them, you should. But you should also set up your project so that you mechanically can collect them. Most people are just complaining that their NFTs are trading on Blur. And guess what? Nobody cares.
00:29:19.650 - 00:29:38.200, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been interesting to watch what that's done for ETH Issuance as well, which is yeah, it's been down only, I mean, I can share my screen. I mean, anyone can kind of look at this. It's the ultrasound money.
00:29:38.970 - 00:29:39.720, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:41.850 - 00:29:52.200, Speaker B: It'S pretty significantly negative. Yeah. Even with Blur, and I know that caused a lot of activity, this is still fractions of what it would be during a bull market.
00:29:53.210 - 00:30:00.794, Speaker C: Basically was at like 700 for a couple of hours when Blur AirDrop was happening. It's unheard of.
00:30:00.832 - 00:30:18.900, Speaker A: Can we debate this though, for a second? This feels like, I know ETH people going crazy because boom burning a lot, number go up, but this feels really not good for a network that needs to be used. Like, if the network can't be really used, but every time there's like a big event like this, why is that a good thing?
00:30:19.350 - 00:31:08.450, Speaker C: It depends on where you're using the network. Are you using it on Optimism Arbitrum or main net? And if you're using main net like the Blur AirDrop was happening, then yes, gas fees, base fees are going to be higher if you're using it on any other layer two, layer, three app chain, whatever it is, I think, and you're leveraging the ETH base layer, it's still on Ethereum, but you're not going to experience those fees. Last time I went to Go, we obviously state synthetics. Last time I went to go claim fees, it was $0.27. Historically, that's been like $1213. So I generally think most of the activity is going to aggregate around layer twos and those are going to feed into main net. And that's just going to be the model that most people end up using the other model too.
00:31:08.450 - 00:31:39.242, Speaker C: And we're starting to see this with games running your own SuperNet subnet and having most of the activity be based on something that doesn't actually directly go down into the main net. Most of the activity is going to aggregate on these subnet supernets, where it's run by validators that are the game ecosystem itself. And those validators are going to be something that goes down eventually and confirms with main net, but it's not going to be something that you actually have to pay a fee to use.
00:31:39.376 - 00:32:05.326, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. So then I guess if you almost think about the customers or the clients of ETH, it'll be like kind of probably the bigger apps. I guess eventually even something like Uniswap would migrate to an L2 or something like that. But I guess it really becomes like the L two S are the big clients because ETH is unusable. Right. If ultimately given a blur AirDrop like this basically makes it super expensive to operate.
00:32:05.358 - 00:32:15.218, Speaker C: I mean, on ultrasound money, you can look at what the biggest burns are and it's most of the main apps, but up there is arbitram.
00:32:15.394 - 00:32:16.214, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:16.412 - 00:33:01.698, Speaker D: And optimism. The other interesting approach that Hayden was talking about on Twitter, hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, is basically like having different application specific EIP 1559 curves. And this is how Salana does it, where if you're an NFT marketplace, your transactions are being processed alongside all the other NFT marketplaces. And so clogging that specific slot doesn't clog the slot for DeFi. That's kind of just like another interesting way of doing it. People are going to start to figure this stuff out. But I think ETH Is kind of trying to do this step by step dance of having enough fees on the base layer to secure all the other L two S, and meanwhile, kind of like slowly dripping more users.
00:33:01.698 - 00:33:27.566, Speaker D: And more flow and more defined NFTs towards these l two S as use cases and then having them take over, basically paying for security at some point in this transition. And so it's never going to be like fully clean. But I'm super impressed at how high the burn is and how much usage there is. And I think that was one of the main things that people told us was not going to happen in the bear market. It was going to be like 100 ETH burn per day. And that just hasn't played out at all.
00:33:27.748 - 00:34:05.850, Speaker B: 100%. And it does seem like I know. Vance, one of your predictions at the beginning of the year was that it's going to take a little while longer for the ZKS than people think. But it does seem like there's a lot of progress happening on Arbitrum and optimism with everything that they're doing with Bedrock, there's a whole layer, like in kind of roll app narrative that's taking hold. And shout out to David Hoffman, who did a bunch of great interviews from whatever the I forget the name. It was like Starkware sessions, but there know, seven or eight specific interviews that he did from the conference they just had in Tel Aviv that I thought was really good. Seems like that ecosystem is alive and thriving.
00:34:06.190 - 00:34:10.570, Speaker D: Listen, there's like five different people who've launched the first ZK EVM today.
00:34:10.640 - 00:34:12.170, Speaker A: Zke EVM? Yeah.
00:34:12.320 - 00:34:13.186, Speaker B: Matterlabs?
00:34:13.238 - 00:34:14.766, Speaker C: Yeah, everyone's got the first.
00:34:14.868 - 00:34:20.990, Speaker D: Congrats everybody. It's polygon matterlabs. And is ZK sync the same thing as matter labs?
00:34:23.190 - 00:34:24.190, Speaker B: I forget.
00:34:24.350 - 00:34:25.970, Speaker A: Yes. Didn't they rebrand?
00:34:27.510 - 00:34:36.914, Speaker D: Congrats to them. Anyways, there is no more scaling problem. We have more block space than we know what to do with at this point.
00:34:37.032 - 00:34:56.762, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. How would you guys feel like with that said Vance, are you guys interested in or seeing any interesting applications? I know you guys are interested in the gaming space in general, but apps that are is the next frontier kind of apps that are being built on that leverage this L two block space.
00:34:56.896 - 00:35:27.470, Speaker D: Oh yeah. Like Pixels is a game that's scaling and doing really well and alluvium has got a lot of people in beta and just needs to hook it up to the chain. So those are the two that we're kind of looking at in terms of the standard bears of what games could be successful. You also have things like Shrapnel that are still in development but getting closer to launch. Games are taking longer than we expect. But I don't know, it feels like it has to be games. Like last cycle we were looking for a use case and we accidentally found DeFi.
00:35:27.470 - 00:35:48.650, Speaker D: We're not going to find something out of left field this time. What would it be? It doesn't even really make sense to think about it that way. It's more so, like how do we apply the existing technology to these consumer verticals? And it just has to be games. Like music. NFTs not enough people content doesn't make sense yet. Commerce really not there yet. On the merchant side, it has to be games.
00:35:49.550 - 00:35:51.402, Speaker C: Yeah. Social Crypto.
00:35:51.466 - 00:36:00.190, Speaker D: Social Crypto. Awesome to see Forecaster and Lens doing what they're doing, but I think they have like ten or 20 or 30,000 users.
00:36:01.490 - 00:36:46.318, Speaker C: It might be like I don't even know what the expression would be after beating a dead horse. But whatever it is, is what I'm going to say. Which is we still have a MetaMask problem. We still have the issue of like, oh, you want to use this app? Like here, download this thing called MetaMask, put it into Chrome, put some value into it, actually access it, sign a message. That stuff is still an impediment to growth and as soon as somebody solves the MetaMask problem, it will be hockey stick growth. But until then, I would not expect there to be any sort of application discovery. Frankly, like, one of the reasons why we love games is because most of the games and most of the game developers understand this exact issue, which is that they also have a MetaMask problem.
00:36:46.318 - 00:37:30.178, Speaker C: How do they get people to sign up username password, email password, whatever it is, like sign up login, build a custodial wallet, like actually create a wallet on the back end that has all the assets that the user has. Don't even tell them that there's a wallet on the back end until they ask for it and then say, oh, by the way, we've been logging all these strokes, we've been keeping all your assets. Everything is in this asset vault, but now you can actually use it. That's the model that most people understand. And frankly, one of the reasons why games are exciting to us is just because game developers understand this really well. They're like, I can put zero blocks in between a user getting to me and using my game. They've been doing it for decades.
00:37:30.178 - 00:37:32.320, Speaker C: So I'm most excited about that.
00:37:34.370 - 00:38:13.994, Speaker B: Let's talk for a little bit about the new product that Flashbots just launched. So Flashbots, I think this was announced yesterday, but they just announced a new protocol called Mev Share. It's a permissionless and private matchmaking protocol between users and searchers, which by their own this is kind of a summary of the blog post that they released. But it has the following benefits. So for users or wallets or applications, it receives the mev that their transaction creates. So it's kind of a way to redistribute some of that mev that their transactions create back to users. For searchers, it's kind of like private order flow that they're getting.
00:38:13.994 - 00:38:31.310, Speaker B: So they're extracting MEB from transactions that they otherwise wouldn't have access to. And builders, again, just kind of more additional order flow that they wouldn't necessarily have access to. I'll pause, I can go into kind of more technical detail, but I'm curious if you guys have any takes on the Mev share.
00:38:31.380 - 00:38:34.000, Speaker D: Is this live yet or when is this going live?
00:38:35.570 - 00:38:41.618, Speaker B: I don't think it's live yet. They just announced it this week. As solution, I mean, to kind of.
00:38:41.624 - 00:39:11.862, Speaker D: Like at a high level, I think there's two approaches here for wallet monetization. There's the mev approach which is we're going to route everything through stuff like uniswap, which creates this externality of mev. And then you can go monetize that. And that's what's called a user has the last look type of transaction where the user clicks and they can actually get it executed autonomously. So that's the first one. The second one is called payment for order flow, which is a market maker last look where the market maker prices it. There's no slippage.
00:39:11.862 - 00:39:43.762, Speaker D: It doesn't go through an AMM. There's no mev externality and that order flow is monetized. And so those are the two approaches which are coming to the market basically right now. And Flashbots was kind of V one and Suave is going to be V two for mev monetization and wallet monetization and things like that. I think both are interesting. I think you're going to get better monetization as a wallet through something like payment for order flow because you're monetizing more of the transaction in a more efficient way. And frankly, it's going to be a little bit more competitive just pricing wise versus things like Flashbots or Suave.
00:39:43.762 - 00:40:11.200, Speaker D: So that's kind of how we're placing our bets. But it's cool to see a lot of this stuff move in this direction. I am somewhat bearish on mev in general, just because the apps used to be so poorly designed and people would take advantage of them. And it feels like we're moving away from that both in the sense of payment forward to flow and also just optimizing existing smart contracts for less mev. So we'll see. But this is one of the stories that's playing out this and probably more so next year as well.
00:40:12.610 - 00:40:50.982, Speaker B: It's kind of a different place in the value chain as well, like the mev value chain to extract that value. So if you think about where that transaction originates, it's literally with the wallet, right? The user has some kind of intent to do some sort of transaction like a swap or something like that, and they place that through their wallet. So that wallet maker kind of has a natural advantage because they have the information first and then all the way at the other end of the chain you have the validator. So I'm a little biased because I just did like a long episode on this earlier. That was the Bell Curve episode this week. But there is a possibility, I think you can have block space mev sort of auctions and then order flow. Mev auctions.
00:40:50.982 - 00:41:08.674, Speaker B: I think they can actually coexist in the same way that you have a market for buying apartments versus renting apartments. But the question is where is more value going to get extracted? And this is also a private order flow solution as well, which is maybe.
00:41:08.712 - 00:41:15.330, Speaker C: This is definitional, but what is the difference between what you're describing and payment for order flow? For all intents and purposes.
00:41:18.890 - 00:41:54.202, Speaker B: This is where I'm really reaching out. It's the ability to settle. So it's possible that you can buy some order flow and that gives you some information. It's helpful for me to think about this in terms of, let's say I'm Citadel securities and I just bought a bunch of order flow from Robinhood. They have a different position in the market structure, right, where they can actually internalize some of that order flow. These market makers won't have the ability to do that. So the way they could profit off that order flow, they might need to actually buy space, the block space as well, so that they can actually order the transactions.
00:41:54.202 - 00:41:57.510, Speaker B: So that's why there could be two separate markets.
00:41:57.690 - 00:42:00.082, Speaker D: Just a question of which market is bigger in my mind.
00:42:00.136 - 00:42:00.738, Speaker C: Right?
00:42:00.904 - 00:42:31.200, Speaker D: Is payment forward flow going to be 90% of the market and you're only monetizing mev 10% of the time? Yeah, because they are competitive. Right. If you enforce one standard for most of the market, mev is just going to be a lot smaller. And pan forwarder flow has the advantage of better pricing and better monetization for wallets, mev doesn't really mev kind of seems like V One technology, so we'll see.
00:42:33.090 - 00:42:58.726, Speaker B: This was pointed out, nitesh, I think you guys led the round for deflow with multicoin. Really sharp guy, but he pointed out too that there are really specific laws around the SEC has about offering best execution for retail traders. And in crypto, we're just like, oh yeah, well we'll give them shitty execution, but we'll kick back like 80% of the rewards to the users. And SEC is not going to like.
00:42:58.748 - 00:43:32.430, Speaker D: That, not strictly speaking. Totally know you're not like front running or back running, but someone is doing that and then you're monetizing on their behalf versus something that is auction of known market makers where you're quoted an exact price and you'll get that price that fits with basically all of the existing SEC regulations around how these things are supposed to be served. Like if you're a wallet and you're like, don't worry, what's your business model? Oh yeah, we're monetizing like, you're going to have to speak to somebody at some point about that.
00:43:32.500 - 00:44:14.458, Speaker C: I mean, not to say that this is exactly the same thing. And also going back to the QC commentary, it's not hard for us to do this, but every single quarter we have to put together a best execution report that eventually will be discoverable by the SEC as a registered investment advisor, we have to make sure that we are going through the process. We're not giving any kickbacks, we're not paying any fees in addition to what we necessarily need to, and we're getting best execution with any of the trades that we're making. And that's something that we have to put together. Our chief compliance officer does as a registered investment advisor. Imagine Wallets being under the same guidance, being under the same imagine how do.
00:44:14.464 - 00:44:20.720, Speaker A: You show Michael, like, if you're doing an OTC trade or something, you're like, I head up this guy. Trust me, he gives really good prices on.
00:44:22.450 - 00:44:47.238, Speaker C: I mean, it matters what your counterparty is. It matters the communication. Are we talking to Coinbase OTC? Are we talking to Falcon X? Whoever the counterparty is, is something that we have to log. But then we also have to do a report on what was the average trading price for that day or that hour. Did we actually trade at whatever it is $5. And the average trading price was $5.10? Yes.
00:44:47.238 - 00:44:57.434, Speaker C: Okay, looks like you got close to did you trade it? If it was average trading price of 510, was it like $2 and $3? Kickback. So we have to report all of that?
00:44:57.472 - 00:45:29.126, Speaker D: Yeah. Imagine your user fat finger or something and you're like, yes, I just monetized all of that mev. What? No. The CFTC and the SEC are eventually going to look at the wallets because there are a lot of where most of the flow originates and they're going to ask, how are you treating your users? Acceptable answers include payment for order flow where everyone has a fair shot at an auction. Non acceptable answers include we're monetizing mev. And when people fat figure things through not best execution menus, it goes back.
00:45:29.148 - 00:45:32.838, Speaker C: To Yano and his grandmother. If you're not paying for it, you're probably the product.
00:45:33.004 - 00:45:34.466, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, bigly.
00:45:34.578 - 00:45:37.030, Speaker B: Your grandma would have seen right through meviano.
00:45:40.510 - 00:45:44.038, Speaker C: Wait, so they're monetizing you so they're.
00:45:44.054 - 00:45:45.530, Speaker B: Not giving you best execution.
00:45:48.910 - 00:45:49.386, Speaker A: But then.
00:45:49.408 - 00:46:20.120, Speaker B: What do you think? Because my super five year old brain version of Mevs value has to get extracted from the transactions that are getting created. A lot of what we're doing is just routing and settling transactions. That's what financial markets are mechanically and they're fees that get extracted along the way. That's kind of where I bucket mev in my brain. So I'm curious, how do you guys see Mev kind of evolving? What are some of the interesting products or strategies that you've sort of seen?
00:46:21.210 - 00:46:48.330, Speaker D: I mean, the elimination of Mev is probably the most interesting one where you just move to a fundamentally different model. There's also different verticals in mev. There's like the DeFi mev that's associated with that. There's also the gas auctions with all the goombas that are trying to get after the NFTs. That's a different type of mev and that's monetized differently. There hasn't been that much exploration on that side. So interested in seeing how that generally manifests.
00:46:48.330 - 00:47:30.918, Speaker D: But I think we're getting to a point where mev a probably isn't the best execution for users and B puts people who monetize it in a strange position. There's a reason why you haven't heard of the biggest searchers in Mev. They're trying to keep that under wraps and they're trying to basically not be known at all, even though it's one of the most profitable corners of crypto. There was like a congressional report which happened to include mev. People know about this and it's generally one of those things where days in the life of a turkey mev seems like a great business model until it gets you in a lot of trouble. And I think just eliminating it is probably the safest path for most of these wallets.
00:47:31.014 - 00:48:00.210, Speaker C: Yeah. Only thing I'd add is the best way to get rid of it is to define a marketplace for it and let it compete itself away. I would actually lump the definition. And I know we talked about this before, but traditional mev is one thing, but maximum extractable value, that concept also includes payment for order flow, which I think can get you best execution. There is still a business model around payment for order flow, as Citadel securities.
00:48:00.290 - 00:48:07.734, Speaker D: Can attest to, and the objects matter as well. Like, you can't have people sandwich attacking your users. That just doesn't look that good.
00:48:07.852 - 00:48:08.850, Speaker B: No, it doesn't.
00:48:09.010 - 00:48:19.478, Speaker C: If you're putting up that order flow and that block space up for auction, that's a totally different outcome than sandwiched attacks on uniswap, just a different ecosystem.
00:48:19.574 - 00:49:01.558, Speaker B: Well, there are also tricky ways, right? The meme about Citadel front running you is like, right and wrong at the same time, because this is again, a super simplified version of it. But Citadel is not like buying access to trades that come from Robinhood and then trading against those people. But it does understand that order flow is very correlated. So if there are a bunch of buy orders coming for GME, then you know that there's about to be a bunch of buy orders for AMC. And then you can so the people who say, hey, no, Citadel isn't front and running. Like, you're technically right, but they're also wrong in principle because you're just front running a different group of people with your alpha.
00:49:01.734 - 00:49:29.886, Speaker C: The other reason why Citadel is buying that order flow and this, like, obviously they have a business model where they can monetize it, but it's also getting you immediate execution on. Like, there is a consumer advantage to actually having someone buying and bidding on that order flow. It makes it better consumer experience. Do I care if my Apple buy goes in at like $109.10 versus $0.11? Not really. I'm playing for a different ballgame.
00:49:29.886 - 00:49:33.330, Speaker C: But they do, and if they can make that execution happen, then that's great.
00:49:33.480 - 00:50:01.054, Speaker B: Yeah. Mev has kind of been happening in Trad Five. I think this is why all the HFT firms, it was like, one day none of these guys were involved, and then the next day they were all super deep in all these ecosystems. I think it was just easy pattern matching. They were like, oh, yeah, we do this every day, and this is all legal. So I think that was part of the reason why these guys all got deeply involved in some of the alt ones.
00:50:01.252 - 00:50:03.566, Speaker C: How much money did Citadel make last year?
00:50:03.668 - 00:50:04.830, Speaker D: 16 billion.
00:50:06.690 - 00:50:10.954, Speaker C: $16 billion of profit and that's net of fees.
00:50:11.082 - 00:50:11.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:11.732 - 00:50:13.490, Speaker D: Winning. Ken Griffin.
00:50:14.710 - 00:50:15.778, Speaker B: Ken Griffin does it.
00:50:15.784 - 00:50:18.130, Speaker D: Dude, thanks for buying silvergate, Ken.
00:50:20.310 - 00:50:21.854, Speaker C: Honestly, he can have the constitution.
00:50:21.902 - 00:50:26.962, Speaker D: I don't care. Yeah, as long as he takes silvergate and make sure it doesn't explode.
00:50:27.106 - 00:50:29.350, Speaker B: Is that confirmed? Did he take a big position?
00:50:29.420 - 00:50:31.638, Speaker C: Silvergate 5.5%?
00:50:31.724 - 00:50:31.974, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:32.012 - 00:50:35.346, Speaker D: Citadel BlackRock. There's like, a few other big firms.
00:50:35.378 - 00:50:50.054, Speaker C: I think SIG also bought it with Citadel. I mean, silvergate not dead. $8 billion of bank run still survived.
00:50:50.182 - 00:50:50.822, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:50.976 - 00:50:52.458, Speaker D: Legends, dude.
00:50:52.554 - 00:51:21.890, Speaker B: They're great. I love silvergate. I will say I host other roundup with Mark Yusco, who I have a lot of respect for. He's got some out there ideas sometimes some theories that we don't necessarily agree on. But I will say the predictive power of this particular theory of his was like, they're going to find a way to blow it up, and then when it's all down, they're all going to take big stakes. And it is like Citadel and BlackRock. They all took stakes in the crypto banks.
00:51:21.890 - 00:51:38.134, Speaker B: And there is a very possible future where the on ramping to crypto, this would be like a bad sacrifice to make, but the on ramping to crypto is owned by TradFi. I think they end up winning that on ramping.
00:51:38.182 - 00:51:41.020, Speaker D: Probably should be that way. That's fine.
00:51:41.470 - 00:51:47.246, Speaker C: Just let us bring USDC, bring them into the fight. Yeah, that's actually a good thing.
00:51:47.348 - 00:51:52.238, Speaker D: Portion them out. Coins. Okay, cool. Now you have skin in the game. All right, let's go.
00:51:52.404 - 00:51:53.770, Speaker C: Silver DA. Token.
00:51:53.930 - 00:51:54.640, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:51:55.830 - 00:51:56.578, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:51:56.744 - 00:52:06.098, Speaker D: None of those guys wanted to buy crypto at the all time high. It's going to be kind of the only opportunity we had to get them in. I'm glad they're here.
00:52:06.264 - 00:52:15.734, Speaker B: Yeah, they are. Hi, fellas. I think that was basically all the stories this week. Anything else you guys wanted to chat about?
00:52:15.852 - 00:52:20.700, Speaker C: I mean, as we're talking about, feel like a lot happened this week, but at the same time, not that much happened.
00:52:21.070 - 00:52:22.380, Speaker D: Just another week.
00:52:23.550 - 00:52:25.206, Speaker A: Another day in the bear.
00:52:25.398 - 00:52:27.094, Speaker B: Yeah, another day in the bear.
00:52:27.222 - 00:52:30.378, Speaker C: I do think over two K. I.
00:52:30.384 - 00:52:35.840, Speaker D: Think people are going to be like, are we about to do this?
00:52:36.290 - 00:52:52.334, Speaker C: I was literally about to say the most common thread that I've seen so far on Twitter, and there's been a couple of people talking about it in the last 24 hours. It's like, Max Payne is not like losing all your crypto. It's Max Payne is losing all your crypto, but also watching it pump.
00:52:52.462 - 00:52:53.380, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:52:55.510 - 00:52:58.978, Speaker C: I think there's going to be a bit of a FOMO bid here.
00:52:59.144 - 00:53:10.620, Speaker D: Yeah. People are starting to lose their minds. This isn't supposed to be happening. Same thing happened with COVID remember? Everyone was so pissed that we were rallying because it was a health pandemic and we shouldn't be doing that.
00:53:11.230 - 00:53:16.300, Speaker B: Guess what? All the epidemiologists on Twitter, we did it.
00:53:17.390 - 00:53:18.982, Speaker C: Guess what? Vance is bullish.
00:53:19.046 - 00:53:21.514, Speaker D: I don't think there's been a second where I have been bullish.
00:53:21.642 - 00:53:29.950, Speaker C: Well, tonight with one of our portfolio companies, we're hosting a poker night. There's 110 people Rsvpds.
00:53:31.170 - 00:53:33.950, Speaker B: It's going to be a pretty big organizer.
00:53:34.770 - 00:53:36.240, Speaker A: So will everyone play?
00:53:36.690 - 00:53:44.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm picturing, like, a casino night in the office kind of vibe. Like people going to get dressed up. Is this going to be like a whole.
00:53:45.910 - 00:53:51.960, Speaker C: One of one of the people at the company who's co hosting it with us said, I'm walking in like Larry Bird, who's coming in second.
00:53:55.370 - 00:53:58.120, Speaker B: Guy'S going all in on the third hand, losing all of his.
00:54:02.970 - 00:54:07.900, Speaker C: Take. I'm going to take his Jordans. I'm going to make him bet his Jordans, and I'm going to take them.
00:54:08.830 - 00:54:17.978, Speaker B: You're an inspiring leader, Michael. Not only am I going to crush you, I'm taking your sneakers, walking home and socks.
00:54:17.994 - 00:54:22.506, Speaker A: Do you guys have, like, a COO at Framework or like no, we got.
00:54:22.548 - 00:54:28.130, Speaker D: Like, a number three guy who's kind of utility player.
00:54:29.110 - 00:54:47.478, Speaker C: Yeah. We also have a general counsel, a chief financial officer, or a chief compliance officer. We definitely got people, but I don't know, an investment firm is not really structured like a typical company, obviously.
00:54:47.644 - 00:54:51.702, Speaker B: Yeah, it's different. All right, guys.
00:54:51.756 - 00:54:51.974, Speaker A: Cool.
00:54:52.012 - 00:54:54.050, Speaker B: All right. This is a fun one. Cheers, fellas.
