00:00:23.962 - 00:00:33.062, Speaker B: Alright, everyone. This episode brought to you by our friends at Avalanche. They are the layer one blockchain that is fast, stable, and scalable. You're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. For now, let's get into it.
00:00:33.116 - 00:00:39.820, Speaker C: I don't think there's going to be a single L1 with more TVL on it than an L two by the end of 2023.
00:00:43.310 - 00:00:50.410, Speaker B: Welcome back. Last bell curve roundup of the year. You got Michael's one and two. Vance and piano fellas.
00:00:50.750 - 00:00:51.258, Speaker D: Welcome.
00:00:51.344 - 00:00:58.190, Speaker B: Last roundup of the year. Little Birdie told us that you guys were going to be in Mexico. Vance and Michael tomorrow.
00:00:59.330 - 00:01:04.770, Speaker C: Can you confirm? Is this true? We will be celebrating in Mexico.
00:01:05.110 - 00:01:07.170, Speaker A: Nice. What are we celebrating?
00:01:08.070 - 00:01:16.238, Speaker C: 2023. The Ms, lady Jesus. Not a ton to celebrate other than the year being over.
00:01:16.344 - 00:01:21.160, Speaker A: I was going to say if you found something to celebrate, you tell me.
00:01:22.010 - 00:01:25.800, Speaker C: Yeah, they're silver lining. It's just not a lot to party on.
00:01:26.810 - 00:01:30.826, Speaker D: Listen, just happy that survival was made this year.
00:01:30.928 - 00:01:31.482, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:31.616 - 00:01:47.710, Speaker D: And we've talked about this, but feel very fortunate that framework was able to evade most of the explosions. Actually all of the explosions. Some of our portfolio companies got hit, but it's tough to see a lot of others get hit a lot harder.
00:01:48.770 - 00:01:54.638, Speaker C: There's always someone down worse than you. That's always true.
00:01:54.724 - 00:01:56.642, Speaker A: Well, cheers to that. Cheers to that.
00:01:56.696 - 00:02:01.650, Speaker B: Cheers to that. Might be bad for you, but somewhere out there someone's getting it way worse.
00:02:02.630 - 00:02:04.580, Speaker C: At least you're not Avi or.
00:02:06.390 - 00:02:07.138, Speaker D: True.
00:02:07.304 - 00:02:13.570, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Avi got arrested this week. I guess Poor went out for market manipulators.
00:02:13.650 - 00:02:18.200, Speaker C: Yeah. Crime doesn't pay. Yeah. Okay, we'll go with that.
00:02:18.650 - 00:02:33.760, Speaker B: Doesn't pay. Kids. All right, guys, so we said we were going to do a predictions episode and not look at 2022 because feel like we're happy to leave that in the rear view mirror. Who wants to start first? Anyone have any predictions going into 2023?
00:02:35.570 - 00:02:40.750, Speaker D: So I kind of bucketized mine into there's like bucketized?
00:02:41.090 - 00:02:45.380, Speaker A: Is that the 20 word of 23? Yeah.
00:02:46.070 - 00:03:07.026, Speaker D: You know what I mean? I put mine into three different buckets. The first is macro. So like financial macro. The second is crypto. Then the third is just like random musings and thoughts. So I don't know if we want to break it up like that, but I feel like having some structure to how we want to talk through this would be helpful.
00:03:07.138 - 00:03:12.490, Speaker A: Let's do it. I like that. Why don't we start with some of the macro stuff and then we can get deeper into crypto.
00:03:12.990 - 00:03:14.140, Speaker D: Let's do it.
00:03:14.590 - 00:03:17.238, Speaker A: Hit us with your first macro prediction, Michael.
00:03:17.414 - 00:03:22.000, Speaker D: Well, it's a very simple one, but I think the Fed is going to do exactly what the Fed says it's going to do.
00:03:23.410 - 00:03:24.400, Speaker C: Oh, no.
00:03:27.250 - 00:04:03.414, Speaker D: I think everybody is talking and thinking that there's going to be some pivot, there's going to be some change. But I think basically everyone this is like a total mid curve perspective, but I think it's just going to be exactly what they say it is. And they're going to raise rates until you hit like five and a half percent. And we're going to see more pain along the way. And then at some point probably mid year, next year, we're going to start to see a pause or a stop and that will be the moment of positive stretchery from just like an asset perspective. But I don't think it's going to happen in January. I don't think it's going to happen probably even in March.
00:04:03.414 - 00:04:05.210, Speaker D: I think it's going to be closer to June.
00:04:06.910 - 00:04:15.470, Speaker A: How does that impact your take, Michael, on where you think equities go and just like thoughts around a recession?
00:04:18.530 - 00:05:06.240, Speaker D: Well, equities obviously has an inverse relationship. Equity values generally have an inverse relationship with interest rates. So as interest rates go up, you start to see asset prices go down. I think what will happen though is as we start to see more dovish language come out of each one of these different announcements, you're going to start to see markets actually front run this process. So what we saw with 50 bips in December, we're probably going to see 50 bips in January, maybe 25 bips in January, but we're still going to see continual raises. And so I think markets actually won't have too much of an impact on this unless there is some major deviation in interest or in inflation numbers coming in a lot harder versus the soft that we've seen so far.
00:05:08.610 - 00:05:12.170, Speaker A: Macro. Mike, how does this line up with some of your macro thoughts?
00:05:12.330 - 00:05:51.946, Speaker B: I am basically a contraindicator on the macro. It sounds good to me, but that TBD if that's a good thing or not. I'd like build off that prediction. I have a prediction that sounds a little bit like opium, but I've backed it up with some semblance of research which is I think that honestly the theme of my predictions is positivity. Jason and I did predictions in November, like right around the top, like the end of 2021 and it was painful to go back and look at what I predicted, like agonizingly painful to read what I had written and put out there.
00:05:52.048 - 00:05:55.514, Speaker A: One of them was a Dow will buy a sports team, a professional.
00:05:55.562 - 00:06:34.470, Speaker B: Yeah, we don't need to rehash it. We don't need to rehash it go back. But the reason I got that so wrong, other than the fact that I sit in the middle of the bell curve is I was extrapolating what had happened over the past year and I think it would be a mistake to do that with this. So ultimately I think we've seen a bottom in terms of price in crypto but I don't think that the worst is in for equities. And here's my logic. I still think everything is basically trading off liquidity and interest rates. So when you're looking at what's going on with the Fed, there's the quantity of money, there's the price of money, crypto tends to front run expectations around liquidity.
00:06:34.470 - 00:07:23.722, Speaker B: I actually had a chart about this before so I'll see if I can retroactively put it in. But you can literally match up what's going on with Global liquidity and S and P 500 Flash, the Nasdaq bitcoin and bitcoin and crypto tend to front run that by about one to two months. So that was a super tight relationship that's held for largely most of this year, but that broke in June and crypto decoupled lower. And the reason why it decoupled was because we had fundamentals going on in the market which trumped liquidity expectations. The fundamentals were horrible. It was like terra luna collapsing and then all these basically a credit collapse in crypto. But we decoupled from this broader relationship and then something important happened then which was basically all of these larger, more macro focused investors left the space.
00:07:23.722 - 00:08:13.500, Speaker B: So that was the thing that made that correlation work. So I think basically crypto has front run a lot of the expectation of pain around liquidity but I just don't think we've gotten there so far in stocks because basically all you've seen is a correction in terms of valuation but it hasn't even started to digest earnings which I think are going lower. So this sounds a little bit like but and I don't mean this to mean I still think we've got a solid bear market ahead of us, but I think in terms of price barring like DCG going bust or tether being a fraud or binance collapsing. I think we've basically put in the lows and we'll probably stay around here and there'll be a bear market. But I think the worst is largely behind us in terms of downfall. But I still think there's more to come for equities. So that's my macro prediction for you.
00:08:14.430 - 00:08:45.650, Speaker C: I'm probably somewhere in the middle of you and Michael framework. Michael, I think that the January CPI is going to be pretty soft and you're going to see sentiment turn on that. I think we're going to get to March. There's probably one more hike. It's probably, I guess, February 25 basis points in something in that range. And then after that we've kind of digested the ramping part where we are thinking about how high it goes and then it's just about how long it takes to wring out inflation. And I don't really think that's going to take that long.
00:08:45.650 - 00:09:16.474, Speaker C: And that combined with there's 200 years of mean reversion data on stocks that say if you have a double digit down year, there's an 80% chance that you have a winning year the next year in stocks. That's a pretty powerful force. And so I'm somewhere in the middle. I think a lot of the different industries within the stock market and even in crypto have a lot to play out. Like Robinhood's not going back to its all time high. A lot of these SaaS companies aren't going back to their all time high. They're going to have to basically rethink how they do business and what their business is in some cases.
00:09:16.474 - 00:09:28.820, Speaker C: And I think that's probably a larger point that isn't quite macro. But tech is going to have kind of like a midlife crisis next year, I think. And that is going to be the underpinnings of a lot of the stock market just because it's so big.
00:09:29.910 - 00:09:47.218, Speaker B: I've got a question on this just to back it up. If I ask you to guess, what is the fractal or what does the price action look like for bitcoin? I'll just use bitcoin as a proxy for crypto between end of 2018 beginning of 2020. What would you expect that chart looks like?
00:09:47.404 - 00:10:30.258, Speaker D: So right now it's trading at like 800 billion, something like that. What do I think happens to crypto? Once again? Fans bouncing in and out. I would say that we're probably flat for the first half of next year. And you've got a couple of really kind of large things that are still looming on the horizon. Some positive, some negative, and I think it kind of depends on how you look at them. If these things become nothing burgers, then they could be positive catalysts, but they're still going to be things that live on the horizon. In particular, you've got the Mount Gox, the distribution of the remaining bitcoin from that estate, unwinding of that.
00:10:30.258 - 00:11:15.060, Speaker D: How big that's going to be, nobody really knows. There's a lot of liquidity on those claims, so maybe a lot of that's already been sold, we'll find out. But that's something that's looming and I think it's supposed to start to happen in the first half of next year. The second is Shanghai, which enables withdrawals from ethereum staking. And the amount of ETH that's going to become unstaked and want to be sold once again remains to be seen. So once we get past those two events, or we start to see the magnitude of those events, I think that's kind of just something that holds everything in place for a while. But once we get past those, I think that's where we really start to see what price action will be for the broader market.
00:11:16.650 - 00:12:07.380, Speaker B: Just as a reminder, sorry, this is what I've got pulled up here. This is price action for just Bitcoin as a proxy again from end of 2018 to beginning of 2020. So it's just kind of interesting to look at because if you lived through that period of time in crypto, you remember it as basically this at least this is my memory of it. It's basically this just bleak expanse of nothingness, right, where no one wanted to believe any good news is down, only it was just apathy. It's like a wasteland. But actually, over that period of time, crypto, its market cap almost doubled over a period of time, bitcoin's price action almost tripled. And it's an interesting mark of that bottom because that was able to happen without anyone even raising their hopes of the return of a bull market.
00:12:07.380 - 00:12:25.178, Speaker B: So I think the thing that I'd still be looking for a little bit, I think we're almost there, but I don't think we're there yet is a full sentiment bottom where you could see a double, basically a full double in the price, and no one even gets excited about it. So maybe we never get frankly to that level of when do you think?
00:12:25.184 - 00:12:28.810, Speaker C: December? I think that's the thing that June or November.
00:12:33.810 - 00:12:34.954, Speaker D: Definitely November.
00:12:35.082 - 00:12:36.910, Speaker A: Yeah, November.
00:12:38.850 - 00:12:40.240, Speaker B: I think it took time.
00:12:41.490 - 00:13:35.140, Speaker D: It took time. Well, what I'm in particular referring to is the blow up of FTX. It's sort of like if you hold these sacred beliefs that these institutions are actually telling the truth, they're doing the right stuff, you've got all this public facing activity, and then that's a complete facade that I think is where you kind of, like, call into question all the other beliefs that you have, all the other perspectives that you have, and everybody starts to go on a witch hunt. And that's where we started to see some of the murmurs of all this other stuff happening, which I think mostly are for not just going to go out and say that. I don't think that there's a ton of issues where people are calling smoke right now. But I do think that it's November because it is calling into question poor beliefs, whereas the other stuff that happened that was surprising, but it wasn't really that outlandish to think that Luna and Three Arrows were complete charades as well.
00:13:36.470 - 00:14:11.630, Speaker B: I still don't think the sentiment bottom is in. I think the sentiment bottom is like, six months from now, because I think what, like, at least I'm purely basing this off my memory. This is what I think logically will happen again. It's like, okay, that FTX explode was, like, exciting in a weird way. You couldn't take your eyes off, like, emotions were high. But the thing that I'm sort of waiting for is like deep apathy after that, which is like, okay, FTX is done, and there are teams that are like, okay, now we can get back to doing what we're doing, but users aren't entering the space. Nothing is necessarily working.
00:14:11.630 - 00:14:21.182, Speaker B: So there's this try to grind higher and that doesn't necessarily work, and then some teams give up and that's when people really leave, I think.
00:14:21.236 - 00:15:02.554, Speaker D: So the reason why I would say that I don't completely disagree. I think that there are some ways that sentiment has still yet to bottom. But the one major difference, and I was trying to think of the way that you said it, Mike, of what's your perspective broadly on what these predictions are? And you said optimism. I actually was thinking originally and like, wrote out a bunch of different perspectives predictions, and then I was like, okay, well, why am I thinking these things? And it's because I was using the frame of mind of like, okay, we just went through 2018. What is 2023 going to look like? It looks like 2019. And the major difference there is there wasn't anything that was working in 2019. There was no stablecoin, there was no activity, there was no developer interest.
00:15:02.554 - 00:15:53.006, Speaker D: Some people were starting to work on things and some of the teams were starting to put stuff together. But I remember, and I think I've said this before, but I have so many investments, that probably three different investments where we tried to bring in friends who were in the space, investing in the space, and they were looking at some really awesome what ended up being awesome investment opportunities. And in three instances people passed because they're like, I'd rather just hold Bitcoin at this point and not invest in applications, not invest in middleware, not invest in infrastructure that ultimately ended up way outperforming Bitcoin. But that's kind of what the narrative was back then because it really wasn't like there was any developer activity or tech activity. It was all just sort of money crypto. So I think that it's really different this time around. The developer activity in the tech side of the crypto industry is working.
00:15:53.006 - 00:16:29.414, Speaker D: And there are games that are growing hundreds of thousands of new users every single week. There's still a lot of activity in the DeFi applications that are working. And one of my other kind of broad predictions is that next year we see the flippening, but not in the way that everybody talks about it. I think next year we see the flippening in terms of the amount of actions or activities. So, like volume trades, traders that are interacting with DeFi over CFI. And I think that will be one of the indications that this industry is still humming along and growing. But I think that's going to happen in 2023 too.
00:16:29.612 - 00:17:06.738, Speaker A: I'm going to use that to pivot into my first prediction, which is that I think the kings of trading and the kings of NFTs, so kings of trading and buying would be I'd categorize that as Coinbase. Obviously it's finance, but like US based, and then with NFTs it's openc. I think that they both lose pretty drastic amounts of market share. On the coinbase side. I think that Uniswap ends up passing Coinbase in volume, not just in spurts, not just on one off date, like one day of the month. But I think a pretty substantial amount of days. In 2023, Uniswap will pass Coinbase and volume.
00:17:06.738 - 00:17:41.950, Speaker A: And I'm hopeful that CFI's failure is actually going to push users into self custody. Wallets and so if you actually look at the metrics in DFI summer or like fall of 2020, the Dex to centralized exchange ratio hit an all time high of 16%. So Dex volume to sex volume 16%. Now it's at like eight or 9%. I think it is, I think cut in half, it's sub 10%. I think that'll hit like 20% to 25% in 2023. And I think that'll just be like Uniswap.
00:17:41.950 - 00:18:17.530, Speaker A: When Uniswap did pass Coinbase and volumes, it was like front page Wall Street Journal or New York Times, I forget who wrote about it. I think that'll be this big moment in the industry in 2023 as Uniswap passes them continuously, I also think leading to Uniswap, by the way. I think Uniswap is going to have a big year in 2023. I also think it's going to be led by Openc falling in market share. So in the Bull Run, Openc had like 75% to 85% of the market share for NFTs, this colossal stronghold on the NFT market. Today, they're sitting at like 40% to 50%. I still think that's way too high.
00:18:17.530 - 00:18:43.838, Speaker A: So I think a uniswap just rolled out. NFTs I think they're going to do very well. There's these professional trader experiences like Blur that will do well. There's like these new kind of mechanisms for flipping and trading NFTs, like who was it? Pseudoswap. Right? Like the AMM style, like floor trading. I think we'll see vertical specific exchanges. So like music exchanges, gaming exchanges, fashion exchanges.
00:18:43.838 - 00:19:14.174, Speaker A: I think brands will do what Nike did and end up launching their own white labeled marketplaces. So I think all of those things plus the royalties battle, right? OpenSea faces this big trade off between attracting trading volume and then protecting artists and creators. So all those things I think, will lead to OpenSea having a tough year. So both OpenSea and Coinbase I think will end up losing a substantial amount of market share. Yeah. Curious what you guys think of that one.
00:19:14.212 - 00:20:19.374, Speaker C: I think generally I believe that DeFi will increasingly penetrate the market and become just as dominant as Coinbase on an average day. I think the question is if it's Uniswap or somebody else, if it's a wallet, if it's a payment for order flow protocol of the legacy incumbents, you have Aave, you have compound, you have Curve, you have synthetics. Not all of these have the same amount of market share or just like raw revenue, but Uniswap seems the most vulnerable and not Uniswap the front end or Uniswap, whatever they're coming out with. And they just did the big raise for but specifically Uniswap V Three. In my opinion, that's been just a very big missed opportunity in terms of there were supposed to be people building margin trading and swaps and interest rate derivatives on top of Univ three. But it just has not either by the fact that it's just such a nuanced and difficult system to work with or the fact that there really hasn't been a community groundswell. Uniswap's main advantage in my mind is not like their on chain contracts.
00:20:19.374 - 00:21:08.820, Speaker C: It's their brand reputation and the amount of eyeballs that they get on their site. And if they can leverage that, I think they're going to be very successful, I think on the back end. If Uniswap is very successful on the front end, on the back end, I think there's going to be a question of if LPs are getting run over in all sorts of ways and your long term stakeholder is these LPs, is this really the best liquidity model to serve what would be a very successful front end business? And I think things like payment forwarder flow will generally come back or come to the fore and be dominant. I also think you're going to see a Uniswap V two revival of people who are just like v three is too complicated, doesn't have the things that we want, doesn't have easy yield farming, doesn't have easy distribution tokens. And that'll be another source of potential strength for them. But yeah, I generally agree, just not on the Uswap. Part.
00:21:11.910 - 00:21:52.382, Speaker D: I think one of the points that I really agree with on the OpenSea side of that and this is just anecdotal evidence, but something that we see quite frequently is a lot of the games that are building ecosystems. So you can imagine like a studio that has five titles that they all want to kind of interrelate in this new world. They want to own their own white label marketplace. And it's not something where they just want to be able to go put this on OpenSea and put this out into the open and have people bid on these assets. It's like, no, they want to control the end to end and have a user experience that's built into the game, which is their marketplace. And they're not going to run the infrastructure. They're not going to do the regulatory jump through regulatory hurdles to get that marketplace up and running.
00:21:52.382 - 00:22:37.034, Speaker D: They'll pay somebody to white label it. And so one of the things, and this is sort of kind of a philosophical perspective of like, do you think it's PFP NFTs that take over the trading volume in 2023? Or do you think it's sort of like utility driven or application specific NFTs that are the things that drive NFT volume in 2023? I lean more in the latter camp where I think game assets or assets that kind of provision access to things and have fundamental utility versus what we've seen historically of PFPs is going to be the driving force of NFT volume going forward. And a lot of that, to your point, aggregates and kind of gravitates towards application specific, vertical specific marketplaces. So I totally agree with OpenSea kind of getting disintermediated.
00:22:37.162 - 00:23:15.850, Speaker C: I got one that's pretty specific within crypto. And the take is basically that ZKE EVMs have a softer year than people are expecting. I think a lot of people are expecting. I think there's like probably 20 or 30 ZK EVMs at this point. They're going to launch and they're going to somehow save crypto and they're going to be ready immediately. And this just reminds me of 2019 in DevCon Osaka when optimism released Unipig demo with Uniswap, and it was right around the corner and we were all going to use it and it was going to be the best scaling technology ever. And what happened was it took two and a half more years.
00:23:15.850 - 00:23:45.742, Speaker C: The transition process was slow and for a lot of the time, even conceptually, which is a similar scenario, we had low transaction fees in ETH through the bear market of last bear market. And so l two S were nice. But yeah, if we were to get that successful, that'll really matter. Just a lot of excess capacity, potentially. I think we're in the same scenario where there's a ton of cheap block space. ZKE EVMs are differentiated in some ways, but mostly not. And I think it's also going to be a long transition.
00:23:45.742 - 00:23:52.198, Speaker C: So I think the ZKE EVM hype will really die down and you're going to see that come to the market in a very real way.
00:23:52.364 - 00:23:55.206, Speaker D: Yeah, software always takes twice as long.
00:23:55.228 - 00:24:01.660, Speaker C: As everything in 2024. I do think they will be powerful over time. I just don't think in 2023 they're going to do a whole lot.
00:24:02.030 - 00:25:10.350, Speaker D: So one kind of orthogonal point to that I was listening to, I think it was bankless on my myriad of flights over the last 36 hours. But Justin Drake was talking about how what ZK roll ups can actually bring to the table, which is new State Management Composability, where in the previous model of where we thought Ethereum was going, where you had whether it was 64 or 1000 and however many shards it was going to break. Composability where you had basically these different EVM chains that were going to run executions individually. Well, with a ZK EVM, you're actually able to take each one of those and have them be composable with each other to where you can have composability across the different shards with both proto and dank sharding or dank, whatever it is. Both of the new sharding. I forget which one's first always, but the proto dank or Dank. But the idea is that with both of them, you'll actually be able to have roll ups that have composability.
00:25:10.350 - 00:25:23.662, Speaker D: So not to say that this changes the timeline of execution, but once we get that, I think it's going to be extremely powerful and kind of brings us back to the old Ethereum composability narrative, which I think has been lost.
00:25:23.806 - 00:25:42.540, Speaker C: We're going back to tradition, back to the original chains, back to I think likely. I'm just looking at all the D Five chains right now. I don't think there's going to be a single L1 with more TVL on it than an L two by the end of 2023.
00:25:43.310 - 00:25:52.698, Speaker A: I think this feels like a good time to throw a mic in here as I know he's got a counter prediction for you because I want to.
00:25:52.704 - 00:26:04.640, Speaker B: Get the conversation going here. I think L1s survive and thrive in 2023, and I'm going to try to steal man this. I know you guys don't agree with me, so I'm going to break it down in a number of different ways.
00:26:06.130 - 00:26:06.762, Speaker C: All right.
00:26:06.836 - 00:26:45.898, Speaker B: I think if you think about it from a desired end state of smart contracts, I do not think it's a good thing. I do not think it's a desirable end state to have everything settle back to one smart contract layer. I just don't think it is. And I think there are two reasons for that. One, if there's some sort of weird day one bug in the EVM or some code vulnerability that we just don't know about, we pretend that doesn't exist in crypto, it really does. There's just an enormous amount that's a huge vector. If an enormous part of our economic value ends up getting generated and settling back to smart contract layers, I just don't think it's a good thing to have it all settled back to one layer.
00:26:45.898 - 00:27:25.290, Speaker B: The other thing is if you have everything that settles back to one layer, I know ETH doesn't do this right now. I just trust people's incentives over a period of time, ETH will eventually they'll have a monopoly over settlement and it'll become rent extractive, and ultimately you probably want other settlement layers that can compete and drive down price. You guys are laughing at me. I see the face. But let me get through the rest of this. I think there's a structural reason why this is always going to work, because the problem with L1s they have to face is they've got to balance capacity and demand, and they haven't been able to do it so far. I don't think they'll probably be able to do it in the near future because demand is only going to get higher.
00:27:25.290 - 00:28:17.734, Speaker B: So that leads this overflow problem. Right? You saw this when gas fees spiked on ETH and it led through no merit other than it's just way too expensive to transact on ETH, to wanting to transact on other networks. For that reason alone, I think alternative layer ones are always going to be successful or there's going to be some demand for layer ones. Here's the other one that I haven't even heard any debate on this, but I think about this sometimes to myself, which is right now everyone is going off of the assumption that L2s and roll apps like layer threes will essentially be extensions of ETH and the Ethereum community. But I don't. Think they will be. Because if you have L2s that have their own token and then layer threes or roll apps that have their own token, you have three different sets of economic incentives.
00:28:17.734 - 00:29:33.678, Speaker B: And if the idea is that most of the users are going to be on the L2 or the layer three, then the incentives between Ethereum holders and the holders of the tokens of L2 or layer three ecosystems are not necessarily in alignment. And if you think about the entire business model of selling block space in a layer one where you have data availability, computation, execution, that's all being coordinated by one instrument on Ethereum's Roadmap, you have multiple different sets, right? It's all distributed across different layers with different economic instruments, and I don't think they're probably in alignment. And that becomes evident next cycle when most of the activity in users migrate to L2s and layer threes, and then they start to try to exert their leverage and power to pay less fees to ethereum the blockchain. So I think I am a huge fan of ETH, but I sense this overwhelming consensus narrative about it and frankly, it makes me nervous. I've listened to the episodes of Up Only and been like Bitcoin's going to the fucking moon and that's never been the right thing to buy. So that's my counternarative. What do you guys think the multi.
00:29:33.694 - 00:30:21.982, Speaker C: Chain future is going to be kept alive, if it is still alive, by Cosmos finally figuring out what it's doing? And I think a lot of it is the proposals that didn't pass a couple of months ago that was supposed to reinvigorate the ecosystem. There will be some reattempt at that. But generally we haven't seen any of these Cosmos chains take off beyond the level of Osmosis. But if they're going to separate from the pack, the bear market is going to be the time that they do it. So I think that is one way that the multi chain vision survives. My bone to pick is basically about these monolithic chains that are kind of off on an island. I wouldn't say Avalanche is this because avalanche has the concept of subnets, but things like solana and Phantom and harmony and kind of all of the who's who of the last cycle.
00:30:21.982 - 00:31:05.322, Speaker C: I just don't see the economic value proposition, especially when you have to inflate away your token supply to keep the network up and running. At least you didn't say Lightning Network or anything around that. I think Lightning Network is in for another year where people just realize that the story around Bitcoin is shifting and it's not really built for that purpose. I also think your point about the L two S and L three S is correct. You're going to see some economic incentive conflict when all of these things have tokens and they're fighting each other for fees. I generally think an L three having a token just is not a good idea like an L two having a token. You still kind of need to squint to see what exactly it's for and how it can be decentralized.
00:31:05.322 - 00:31:30.300, Speaker C: But I think you're going to see optimism, arbitram and polygon take the first steps towards figuring out, like, all right, how do we split up the pie? And I think a lot of things are not going to make sense as they are today. I also think we'll probably see an L two blow up at some point. Somehow, something will happen either on the DFI side or the consensus side, and that'll be something that we kind of look at and are like, okay, that's new.
00:31:32.430 - 00:32:30.166, Speaker D: I think that those are good predictions because they definitely run counter to a lot of the perspectives that we probably hold. But I'd say it's good to when you get that tingling sensation of some top tick or some consensus perspective, it's good to revert back and go the opposite direction just to test it out. And I agree with a lot of those. I think I could see a lot of those things happening. I also really agree with Vance's point on roll apps probably not needing nor can support their own tokens. And the way that I've always thought of them is more of just like execution layers that are probably paying their fees in terms of whatever the cost basis is in the L2 or the L1 that they're built on top of. But one of the perspectives specific to apps or L two S or anything built on L1s that have tokens.
00:32:30.166 - 00:33:26.238, Speaker D: I think one of the things that I've always thought is that there's just so many new entrants into the market over the last cycle that were literally priced out of ETH. And it sounds so basic to think about this, but buying an ETH for a couple of even just wanting to put a couple of $100 in and not even having the ability to have one of the units is a prohibitive stance for a lot of people who don't have tons and tons of money who want to interact in these ecosystems. And so I kind of see the ability to have optimism tokens and maybe eventually Arbitrum tokens. It kind of enables a new possible avenue for people to get into this space just because of the price point being so much lower. And once again, I know that this is like total behavioral economics and psychology overriding this and not rational thought, but it is something that I think has driven a lot of people away from ETH in lieu of other alt layer ones over the last year and a half.
00:33:26.324 - 00:33:50.680, Speaker B: What do you think about the idea that it's not a great desirable end state to have everything settling back to one smart contract layer? Do you think at all about day one coding risks or anything like that? The example would be if you have something that's mission critical to a company. Right? Like, if you're building jets or something, you don't want only one supplier for your fuel or whatever.
00:33:52.170 - 00:34:05.610, Speaker D: It's not the same analogy because the analogy would be, do you want to have multiple operating systems manning the control modules for that jet, or do you want to have one? Yeah.
00:34:05.680 - 00:34:06.010, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:06.080 - 00:34:06.266, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:06.288 - 00:34:18.666, Speaker A: I don't love the supply. I think it's like OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure, and if there was like a day one bug with Azure, they would just move the code to AWS. They would just build it on AWS.
00:34:18.858 - 00:34:27.540, Speaker D: There's a definite Lindy effect when it comes to software systems like we're talking about. And so whatever's the most Lindy will have the ability to have the strongest security.
00:34:32.420 - 00:35:13.960, Speaker C: The L2 S, I think, were the most crowded venture trade over the past year and a half. And it was like a sneaky crowded trade. But I call it like the Diet l One approach where maybe you don't want to throw 50 million at Aptos or Swee at like 3 billion, but like, OOH, there's an L2 that's raising at like 502 is close to one, and therefore this might go up. And optimism is at 5 billion. But what people don't realize is that's a very historically supply constrained market. It's only been optimism that's really kind of been the standard bearer for setting valuations there. But you're going to see scroll, you're going to see all these I can't even remember all the different L2 S that we've seen, but they're very little differentiation, and they're going to launch with this high, fully diluted valuation.
00:35:13.960 - 00:35:19.490, Speaker C: And I think you're going to see a lot of price discovery on what has been a very crowded venture trade in 2023.
00:35:20.740 - 00:35:26.576, Speaker D: Also, just to throw another one out. That's sort of orthogonal to something that you were talking about or that you.
00:35:26.598 - 00:35:27.670, Speaker A: Guys were talking about.
00:35:28.920 - 00:35:39.588, Speaker D: I actually think that next year is the first year that you see kind of the broad Bitcoin cohort come together and realize we need to change course.
00:35:39.754 - 00:35:41.540, Speaker C: No way.
00:35:41.610 - 00:35:45.512, Speaker D: Something change something so far down the river. I never said that.
00:35:45.646 - 00:35:46.600, Speaker A: Who's leaving?
00:35:48.700 - 00:35:58.030, Speaker D: I never said that it's going to happen. I'm just saying that the narrative is going to become more pronounced. That okay. We need to actually change something for the longevity of this asset class.
00:35:59.440 - 00:36:21.492, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't want to go off on a Bitcoin thing, but too much. But my problem with that is, in my mind, the best thing Bitcoin can do is to do nothing. And what they're trying to do is go build the Lightning network or go build there was a fund that raised $150,000,000 to go build DFI on Bitcoin. That doesn't feel like the right move in my mind.
00:36:21.546 - 00:36:33.320, Speaker C: Well, I mean, maybe something like Strike, just to be charitable. But their mission is that we're not doing anything. I have a hard time getting with that mission.
00:36:39.580 - 00:36:45.064, Speaker B: I think they're going to have to break the 21 million hard cap, but I actually don't think they'll do.
00:36:45.262 - 00:36:46.108, Speaker A: I don't think they're going to be.
00:36:46.114 - 00:36:46.988, Speaker C: Able to get the support.
00:36:47.074 - 00:37:06.992, Speaker B: Talk about like I think they will. Here's why I think they will. I think they're actually smart people. I think they'll realize that transaction fees alone won't pay for the security budget for the network. I think they'll figure out they need to do something. Jason, you talk about building cults, right? Bitcoin. I like bitcoin, but it is a cult for sure.
00:37:06.992 - 00:37:41.740, Speaker B: And there's this funny study about cults. You know how there are all these like doomsday cults that predict the end of the world? Like the world's going to end on March 1975, and then the date comes, you would think logically that disbands the cult because they're like, yo, this didn't happen. But actually what happens is it strengthens the belief in the cult because they were like, we made a miscalculation here. Like Zora the lizard king actually said 85 instead of 70, and it doubles people down. They're like, yeah, we're on board with this new message. And I don't mean to be insulting, but I kind of think that's what's going to happen with Bick. I think they're going to break the 21 million cap.
00:37:41.740 - 00:37:53.216, Speaker B: There's going to be revisionist history. Oh, go back to the white paper. Satoshi never said anything about a 21 million cap. Can't you see these tweets? Like, that was never part of the satoshi white paper. And I think I don't think the.
00:37:53.238 - 00:38:20.824, Speaker A: $21 million cap gets broken for several years until 2030. But what your version of the date? Like, that March 1975. The world doesn't actually die is going to be the having. So I think starting next year, the bitcoin crew is going to be like, all right, guys, only one year out until the having. Like the having is coming. Next year starts the having, the pre pump, where it's like, the having is coming, echo's bringing back the having.
00:38:20.942 - 00:38:21.850, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:38:22.940 - 00:38:39.664, Speaker A: And it's all just so many, like so much having porn on Twitter. And then the having is going to come and bitcoin is not going to be at like two hundred and fifty k, and then everyone's going to be like, well, stock to flow model. But that's going to be the version of the March 1975. It's going to be like, yeah, I came up with a new model.
00:38:39.702 - 00:38:42.252, Speaker C: Have me 22 million bitcoins?
00:38:42.396 - 00:38:43.090, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:43.700 - 00:38:45.570, Speaker D: Are you sure? It was 21 before.
00:38:46.200 - 00:38:58.180, Speaker A: All right, next prediction, next prediction. Michael, what do you got on the crypto side of things? No crypto predictions, lettuce michael.
00:39:00.280 - 00:39:03.220, Speaker D: I've been calling out a couple crypto predictions.
00:39:04.760 - 00:39:07.144, Speaker A: I got more if you don't have fans, kind of like what we talked.
00:39:07.182 - 00:39:08.170, Speaker D: About last year.
00:39:11.100 - 00:39:43.684, Speaker C: I think Visa and mastercard are going to use the bear market to really start building out feature rich payment rails. So, like adding chargeback fraud, adding all the little categories that they have. When you buy a digital stamp versus you buying groceries, like, the credit card actually clears it as two different items, or buckets of items at least they're going to build that. They're going to build a lot of different features. And I think this is going to be the year where you actually see them start to double down in a very meaningful way. So I think the stuff that they're doing on starkware is super cool. I was reading it after the last pod, and I think that's just going to continue this year.
00:39:43.684 - 00:40:00.080, Speaker C: There's a real use case for them and it's immediate. But when you say like, payments, people are like, what? I can already send USDC. It's like, no, people with distribution and real financial acumen are going to start operating these things.
00:40:01.810 - 00:40:42.166, Speaker D: Sorry I said that comment. As a payments nerd myself, understanding the interwebs of payments. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that has to go through for payments to actually work from a consumer payments perspective, and we are not anywhere close to enabling that yet. Vance touched on a number of them, but they're actually really hard to figure out. You got to do identity verification. So knowing that a person is actually a person. The reason why everybody talks about credit card payments and charging three, four, 5%, it's because when you're actually the issuing bank, you're taking on the price risk.
00:40:42.166 - 00:41:30.438, Speaker D: And so that's why the issuing bank, whoever issues you the credit card is the one who takes the bulk of the fees because they handle chargeback support. So if you call your bank and you're like, hey, I never made this charge, like, somebody stole my credit card, or I don't know, they stole my credit card details and made this charge, all of that is baked into the risk model, and that's why they charge the rates that they do. That is something that just hasn't been contemplated yet in crypto. Like, imagine if you send USDC and it's for the purchase of something, and you, as the receiver of that value, are charged 4% every single time you accept payment in USDC, there has to be a lot of infrastructure. Both like technical, but also kind of business infrastructure that has to be built out for payments, as we know, and use them every single day to actually crypto.
00:41:30.454 - 00:41:51.890, Speaker C: Rails are more expensive to use than traditional financial payment rails if you include the credit card fee. People are always saying like, oh, I sent $100 million bitcoin for $0.05. That just doesn't reflect the economic reality or use case of a traditional customer. And that's the stuff that once you can get that credit card charge fee down, blockchains are the de facto payment network for the rest of the world.
00:41:51.960 - 00:42:18.182, Speaker B: All right, everyone, quick break from this episode to talk about our show sponsors, avalanche. Many of you know avalanche as the fast, reliable and scalable layer one, the folks at Avalanche have a really great message for those of you who are in the crypto industry right now, which is bear markets are for building. So while a bunch of our friends over in CFI are kind of going through these struggles and travails, the folks at Avalanche basically put their heads down and are shipping products that builders want. The latest solution. Elastic subnets.
00:42:18.246 - 00:42:30.574, Speaker A: Right. And just to expand on that, avalanche is consistently upgrading all of their platforms. Right. So on the platform side, you've got Elastic Subnets, you've got New VMs. On the infrastructure side of things, you've got Core, which Mike, I know you used that the other day.
00:42:30.612 - 00:42:31.530, Speaker B: I was a bridgeor.
00:42:31.610 - 00:42:46.530, Speaker A: I was a bridge or yeah, exactly. So they're upgrading the infrastructure side with Core and Enclave. The chain has had like no downtime super customizable for devs. Yeah, if you're a builder. AVAX Network. AVAX Network, great place to be.
00:42:46.600 - 00:42:50.814, Speaker B: But do Yano and I as well. So definitely go check them out. But click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:42:50.862 - 00:42:51.410, Speaker A: Click the link.
00:42:51.480 - 00:42:53.426, Speaker B: Oh, you're not going to get any credit. Come on.
00:42:53.528 - 00:43:03.882, Speaker A: Click the link at the bottom. Give us the credit. Exactly. So yeah big thanks to avalanche mean. You just had a great experience with them the other day on the user side of things. Go check them out, guys.
00:43:03.936 - 00:43:05.980, Speaker B: Thank us later. Let's get back to the.
00:43:08.910 - 00:43:49.282, Speaker A: So the first prediction that I had about Coinbase and OpenSea lose market share was predicated on the fact that folks will move out of CFI and into self custody. My next prediction is also around that. So I think the rise of more and more people moving into self custody is going to create a fat wallet war. Or basically just the wallet wars. So if you look back every couple of years, we have these huge wars. I mean, we call them wars, but there were the what were some past wars? Like 2017, we had the Exchange wars. Like finance came onto the scene, really challenged Coinbase, okx, like Huobi, like these really intense exchange wars.
00:43:49.282 - 00:44:19.122, Speaker A: And then in 2021 or 2020 2021, we had like the L1 wars. So you had these ecosystems like battling like Avalanche and Salana yum, phantom like Terra, when they're still alive. I think in 2023 and really into 2024, we're going to get the wallet wars. So right now the only wallet really is like MetaMask. But MetaMask has so many problems with it. The reason they haven't improved is because they have no competition. And I think this year is really the year that that changes.
00:44:19.122 - 00:44:47.914, Speaker A: So you're going to see Phantom, which was primarily a solana wallet, get into ETH and compete with them there. You're going to see I think the Brave browser has like a super clean wallet. I think Brave is actually doing a bunch of cool stuff with their wallet. Argent is doing a bunch of cool stuff with their wallet. You're going to see like big players who already have a lot of cap capital launched their own wallet. So Coinbase launched their own wallet to go head to head with MetaMask. Ledger did the same uniswap, I heard is maybe working on something there.
00:44:47.914 - 00:45:20.658, Speaker A: And then there's like new ones. Like, I think there's one called Backpack. I don't know, there's like new wallets. So I decided to throw that in the third bucket. And I think in the future there's going to be a lot of value that flows to these wallets. And I think right now, if you look at how SaaS evolved, SaaS evolved by basically getting in with the customer. And once they were big enough, the best SaaS companies like a Slack or a Salesforce ended up turning not just they went from just SaaS companies into platforms.
00:45:20.658 - 00:45:50.462, Speaker A: So now there are companies that are entirely built just on the back of the dev kit from Slack, for example, like Troops AI is like a sales tool that was built on the back of Slack. And I think you're going to end up seeing the same thing where someone like a MetaMask launches a dev kit. People build inside of MetaMask. I think account abstraction comes. I think smart contract wallets will end up becoming like this big buzzword next year. So yeah, I think 2023 is the year of the fat wallet. I like that.
00:45:50.516 - 00:46:33.434, Speaker C: What I would say is it's going to happen. And it's going to happen because we finally get clarity on how the App Store treats mobile apps. That's going to be their Trojan horse to take over a lot of the market and to have the breakout success is just account abstraction plus availability on the iOS App Store. That's going to really kick start it. And I think that's going to be a large competitor for a lot of the traditional exchanges. I would say the other one that I think of in terms of just a potentially like a different angle that they take out the same incumbent players. I think Block Explorers are going to get pretty interesting going forward just as you're able to have more context and more information and people spend more time just looking at stuff, kind of like a traditional software network on chain, it won't be as much about the exchange.
00:46:33.434 - 00:46:35.790, Speaker C: It'll more just be about the general context.
00:46:36.370 - 00:47:48.340, Speaker D: So to go back to your point on wallets, one of my predictions and it's sort of kind of splitting the difference between what you and Van said, maybe one of the questions that I have is where do you consider custodial versus noncustodial? Like is a smart contract wallet with account abstraction that effectively has the ability to move assets around per some guidelines or parameters that are set? I would consider that to be a custodial wallet, essentially where you're not signing transaction with a ledger device. You don't have access to the private key, et cetera, that's custodial in my mind. I was going to say that with that definition, custodial overtakes noncustodial in terms of assets on wallet in 2023 and assets could be NFTs or crypto or stable coins, whatever. But I think custodial experiences just based on what Vance said, which is custodial wallets are going to be the only wallets that are supported by iOS going forward. Like period, end of story. And that will be a requirement for mass adoption. And so you're going to have to have some custodial experience that has the ability to interact with DeFi but is still a custodial wallet on the back.
00:47:52.630 - 00:48:26.900, Speaker A: Have you can have a self custody wallet, like an Argent for example, but you can introduce account abstract, like account abstraction can help bring a bunch of things like multicall for one tap, crypt. So you know how sometimes you have to approve three transactions or like four transactions, but like Lping into uniswap. There's like three or four transactions in there, but really you want to do that in one click. AA brings that to the table, like session keys to approve things. So there's not like a million pop ups when you want to do an action. It kind of solves that. There's like social recovery for security gets better.
00:48:26.900 - 00:48:45.094, Speaker A: You can add plugins for flexibility, I guess. Help me understand. So you don't think something like MetaMask wins or not MetaMask specifically, but like a self custody wallet, like a MetaMask or a phantom, you don't think they end up winning this?
00:48:45.132 - 00:48:59.500, Speaker D: You think it's I mean, they would have to change to be a custodial experience. And the logic here is if you want to have a wallet on your phone, that wallet has to be a custodial experience. And I know that there are some.
00:48:59.950 - 00:49:02.726, Speaker A: I have MetaMask on my phone, right?
00:49:02.768 - 00:49:34.230, Speaker D: But I'm not sure that with the new guidelines going forward that they will continue. Like, look what happened when Coinbase tried to upgrade to a new version and basically Apple said no. I think Apple is going to start to clamp down on non custodial wallets in the App Store. And you're not going to be able to have either continued upgrades to what exists currently or the ability to add new wallets into the iOS App Store because they're clamping down on them and they want custodial experiences. You can't maintain your keys in an iOS device.
00:49:34.890 - 00:49:44.540, Speaker A: I just tried to log into my MetaMask on my phone. MetaMask encountered an error due to reaching a storage limit. The local data has been corrupted. So your private key.
00:49:47.310 - 00:49:50.330, Speaker C: Lovely, lovely, lovely.
00:49:51.630 - 00:49:52.570, Speaker B: Lovely.
00:49:54.510 - 00:49:56.220, Speaker A: Self custody is out.
00:49:57.230 - 00:49:59.420, Speaker C: Wallet is going to take care of everything for us.
00:50:09.030 - 00:50:28.650, Speaker D: It's going to be a custodial wallet that has some sort of account abstraction and controls around multi party communication to enable certain types of transactions, but also certain other ones would be blocked. And you're going to be able to set those parameters. It's kind of like where I see the wallet wars going, but I do completely agree that wallet wars are going to take off in 2023.
00:50:28.720 - 00:50:36.700, Speaker A: Do you think the value in the wallets ends up coming from something like payment for order flow? Right now.
00:50:39.310 - 00:51:25.260, Speaker C: If you try to apply and put an application on the iOS App Store, one of the questions that they have is what liquidity are you sourcing? How are you getting this exchange functionality? Are you trading with North Koreans or are you trading with people that we don't want you to be trading with? And a couple of years ago, year ago, you probably could just say we don't have an answer for that. This is just so new. I think they're really going to get strict, especially through the App Store of who is providing liquidity for this thing. And I think that both from an economic standpoint, payment forward of flow is going to be out of the box monetization for a lot of wallets. But from a compliance standpoint, it's going to be okay, this person or these set of people, or it's not just like whoever's in the uni B three pool. I don't think that's an answer that's going to fly with Apple in 2023.
00:51:28.830 - 00:52:05.350, Speaker B: I have a prediction actually around this, and it kind of dovetails with the payment for order flow. I could call mev question. I think mev basically emerges as the dominant business model for DeFi protocols and has implications for wallets and I think exchanges as well. If you go back and look at the Internet, the comparison between crypto to the Internet is kind of pretty done. But in the early stages of the Internet, there were all these different ideas and things that could work. Everything basically most things did work, but there are three dominant business models that kind of emerged. There were ads, so that's like what you have with Google and Facebook.
00:52:05.350 - 00:52:35.374, Speaker B: There was SaaS, right, which is kind of like the Microsoft or Salesforce of the world. And then there were platform models like Uber and Airbnb. And I think you'll see something like that in crypto. I think a lot of stuff is going to work in crypto, but there are going to be a couple models that make the most sense. And mev, I think there's a really strong stated preference in TradFi for hidden or variable fees. Like people don't like paying upfront fees to transact. Like Robinhood put the final nail in the coffin, so we don't pay $5 for a brokerage fee.
00:52:35.374 - 00:53:09.990, Speaker B: But value still gets extracted from financial markets through payment for order flow. And mev is like largely that I think like the way you can order transactions, and I think you'll enshrine proposer builder separation. I know that's happening on ETH. It's happening in Cosmos as well, but you can do things like back running and less harmful forms of mev. So I think value will be extracted through mev. And Jason to your point, I think that's going to happen on the wallet level. Like they're at the very front of the mev value chain basically.
00:53:09.990 - 00:53:57.290, Speaker B: But I think where there's a pretty interesting intersection of people that have insight into they have a large customer base and a wallet is actually Coinbase or exchanges in general. But I think Coinbase is actually pretty interesting to pay attention to here because Coinbase gets beat up for they're like the fee that you're charging consumers is going to go away eventually. They know that, right? I think what they'll eventually realize is like hey, actually one other way that we could monetize is we are responsible for a bunch of transactions that are happening on the blockchain. They could either decide to get into mev that way or I think everyone is sleeping on Coinbase wallet. It's super fucking convenient. I don't really use it but I'm also like why don't I use this? I still keep a good amount of my assets on Coinbase.
00:53:59.710 - 00:54:10.830, Speaker D: Again, you're not allowed to upgrade the new version of the Coinbase wallet until they go custodial. So no one's going to be able to have access to it until they change their entire there are some for sure.
00:54:10.980 - 00:54:12.800, Speaker A: You can have access to it just not on.
00:54:13.110 - 00:54:15.330, Speaker C: But mobile is going to be a big growth.
00:54:20.790 - 00:54:34.630, Speaker B: I don't know, I think that was like a little bit of a jumbled prediction there. But if you look at mev as the dominant way that DeFi protocols are going to monetize then kind of look at where transactions are happening and who has leverage over the consumers that are making those transactions.
00:54:35.690 - 00:54:43.930, Speaker D: Question on your definition, do you consider payment for order flow or the concept of payment for order flow to be mev? I know it doesn't really exist right now in crypto, but let's say that.
00:54:44.000 - 00:54:45.194, Speaker C: Mev they're not the same thing.
00:54:45.232 - 00:54:47.740, Speaker D: They're exactly is something that.
00:54:50.370 - 00:55:45.790, Speaker C: Mev is an externality of D five protocols that are I would just say like suboptimally designed. So you try to swap 100,000 ETH for USDC and there's slippage and the blocks aren't adding to the end of the chain fast enough and so you have someone sandwich attack you or you have someone sandwich attack you and reorg it to get a little bit of slippage with payment for order flow. What you're trading against is basically a market maker or a series of market makers that are competing for best execution and it's kind of like trading against an oracle print and that's how you're supposed to get the best execution. But it eliminates all of the mev externalities because you don't have this thing where okay, you're actually jamming a transaction through uniswap. You're creating the Arbitrage opportunity and then you're having this sort of mempool that you can bypass by private Arbitragers. Like not going to name them but that's the other side of the Coin. There's two totally distinct concepts.
00:55:47.410 - 00:55:56.394, Speaker A: But the idea is the same. Right. It's information that's given to privileged parties before transactions occur with the goal of arbitraging off of crypto retail.
00:55:56.522 - 00:56:27.162, Speaker D: Right, right. What I mean is more of the concept of mev, not like how mev is considered today with uniswap in particular. Yes, I agree. An AMM is like an inefficient way of transacting, and therefore the mev that we've seen is based on slippage sandwich attacks. But what I mean is the concept of mev where there's some bait in value. It's like, for instance, when you get charged taxes on a lot of different digital platforms, what they do is they don't actually add the tax. What they do is they just say it's 999 and they take the tax out after the fact.
00:56:27.162 - 00:56:57.858, Speaker D: And so the merchant ends up paying the tax. It's just like baked into the price. I consider that to be kind of the same concept, which is when you're doing payment for order flow, you're still transacting and they quote you a price, but there is some value that's extracted from the market maker at a later date. It's more like the concept of mev, not like the actual mev that we've seen. So I agree, mike, to your other point, like, mev, inclusive of payment for order flow, I think become the dominant business models.
00:56:58.034 - 00:57:32.814, Speaker B: I think you're going to see the rise of something that looks like kind of like guilds in crypto, basically associations of laborers. And the reason I think this is because one of the dominant growth engines for crypto in the last bull run was yield farming. And basically you were encouraging capital to come onto your platform, and that was pretty successful for the ones that did it in the beginning. Now that model is kind of being rethought because there's like mercenary liquidity, there's constant sell pressure. And a lot of the protocol founders that we talk to are like, yeah, we don't really love this. And really what they need actually is labor. Right.
00:57:32.814 - 00:57:47.374, Speaker B: They want people to contribute and build things on the protocol. The problem with that is that capital is totally fungible. Labor is not fungible at all. Right. Like, not all labor is the same. It's super differentiated. So what you need is someone to set a clearing price for that labor.
00:57:47.374 - 00:58:26.514, Speaker B: You need them to underwrite that labor. And that's actually why you had guilds back in the medieval era. They set the clearing price for how much does it take to bang this metal into this other shape of metal? Right. And they underwrote and they basically said, okay, you're good enough to be like a blacksmith as part of the blacksmith guild. And they also negotiated they sort of acted as like, unions of the day, and they actually wielded an enormous amount of influence. So I'm kind of watching this dynamic of protocol saying, we don't really want capital at the current rate. What we need is, like, labor someone's going to need to group that labor together and they're going to need to underwrite it and price it.
00:58:26.514 - 00:59:13.040, Speaker B: And I think you actually might see the emergence of these guild like organizations. So that's a pretty far out one, but I think there'll be one for delegates. People already call for this all the time in governance, right? Like we need a professional class of delegates like Jason's a delegate at Maker. And it's so hard. I mean, the idea that people are just going to do this as free time just to contribute is like nuts, right? It's way too specialized knowledge and it's not enough compensation. So what you want, right, is like a specialized group of people to say, hey, these are what unions do. So like delegation.
00:59:13.040 - 00:59:33.320, Speaker B: But there might even be something as basic as just design and branding work, like design and branding guild for Web Three. So many of these Dows need help with that. And we've looked for design firms, the ones that get it. There's so few of them. So who knows?
00:59:35.100 - 00:59:54.544, Speaker D: The other one I was going to say is community management. It's very portable across community managers and a great community manager versus a fine one makes the world of difference from what we've seen. And yeah, once you have that skill set, it's really easy to port it over into a new one. And that is a very important job.
00:59:54.742 - 01:00:34.750, Speaker C: I was going to say I have a little bit different of a vein maybe to take us to the tech world and those types of predictions, but I think there's going to be a lot happening in traditional technology next year. It's probably going to be the biggest year of Tumult that it's experienced since probably the going to have I think on the legislative side, I think TikTok is going to get banned and that's going to open up the field for either Instagram to consolidate more of a lead or potentially Michael, the revival of Snapchat. We'll see if they can pull it off. I'm hoping for them.
01:00:37.200 - 01:00:41.740, Speaker A: The real question is, if that happens, will Michael leave framework and go back to Snapchat? No shot.
01:00:43.540 - 01:00:48.320, Speaker C: TikTok gets banned, opens up a lot of greenfield for a lot of other players.
01:00:50.340 - 01:00:52.204, Speaker B: It already has been for government employees.
01:00:52.252 - 01:00:53.248, Speaker A: By the way, for what if you.
01:00:53.254 - 01:00:58.820, Speaker D: Saw that's that's the start, that's the government yeah.
01:00:58.890 - 01:00:59.220, Speaker C: Really?
01:00:59.290 - 01:01:00.150, Speaker A: I didn't know.
01:01:02.120 - 01:01:09.092, Speaker D: Not just I guess it is technically employees, but anyone who has a government issued phone is not allowed to download TikTok.
01:01:09.236 - 01:01:09.930, Speaker A: Wow.
01:01:10.300 - 01:01:57.620, Speaker C: So TikTok banned. Other players get in there, mix it up, something happens. I'm not hopeful for a new type of social network that's built off of a blockchain, but I think there's going to be some churn. I think Twitter is going to work and it's going to work with like a fourth of the employees. And eventually this is going to be, I think, elon's cash cow that he uses to fund a lot of other endeavors and it's going to be pretty impressive. But I think born out of that and born out of people like Tomo Bravo, which is a large software private equity firm, and Vista Equity Partners, which is another large software private equity firm, they're going to see this. A lot of these companies are going to be down horrendous these technology companies, especially the small and medium sized ones, not the fangs, and they're going to buy them and they're going to turn them around.
01:01:57.620 - 01:02:40.852, Speaker C: And so that's going to be the other thing is that we strip a lot of the costs out of tech, and that sets the standard for you're going to have kind of two types of technology companies, and even when you look at Vista Equity's portfolio versus your traditional growth stock, they look a lot different. Like, Vista Equity is buying headcount organization planning software, stripping out 80% of the employees, giving them a literal handbook and telling them to follow this to appropriately reduce costs. And then you have all of these people that are kind of like doing cartwheels through the field and who knows what they're actually doing. But Robinhood is a good example. Coinbase is only at seven and a half billion. I don't think Coinbase is doing anything wrong. I think they're actually on a really good track.
01:02:40.852 - 01:03:07.692, Speaker C: But you're going to see a lot of people start to take shots of these companies, and I think eventually it's going to boil down to how down bad is the company in a lot of cases is just pretty bad. Second one is just governance. Can you actually force the change that you need to? Nobody's going to take Snapchat private, nor necessarily would they. I don't think they've ever turned an actual profit in a quarter. Is that right? Yeah. Zeros. So I think it's going to be a year where tech changes a lot.
01:03:07.692 - 01:03:17.550, Speaker C: And for me, my first impression of technology when I got out of college was the Google Movie with I forget it was like Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. It was like their first day at.
01:03:19.600 - 01:03:20.628, Speaker A: Wearing the hat.
01:03:20.744 - 01:03:32.180, Speaker C: And I was like, man, if I can go work in one of those companies, that would be the best thing ever. My life would be complete. And now I think you're going to get a lot different of a vibe where it's like, we're stripping out the cost. Everyone's working 14 hours a day. Like, good luck.
01:03:34.520 - 01:04:35.832, Speaker A: I think that drives a massive amount of talent into crypto, by the way, every 15 years or so, the hottest industry kind of changes or maybe every 20 years. So if you look at the, like, trading, like Wall Street trading, if you're like you're graduating, you want to yeah, well, private P got built up after yeah. Okay. So you have that era, right? Like private equity and trading on basically just like the Wall Street game. Then it moves into, I would actually say probably investment into when trading got stricter, moved into it was still Wall Street, but like, investment. Like, I remember when Mike and I were in Know, all of our friends wanted to go into either investment banking or consulting, like go to a BCG or McKinsey or IB at Evercore, mike and I were our only friends who studied liberal arts and did not go into IB. So we're a little salty about then.
01:04:35.832 - 01:04:54.396, Speaker A: And then everyone realized that IB sucked. So they went like, the new hot job was like PM at a tech company, which you guys obviously know, and they were going to Netflix and Snap and stuff like that. And now I think that becomes the new IB and crypto becomes the being.
01:04:54.418 - 01:05:06.640, Speaker C: A PM is so lame now. And the reason that I can tell that it's lame is because those stupid videos that people make on TikTok about like, dan my life as a product manager at LinkedIn. Here's me taking the bus, here's me eating.
01:05:09.940 - 01:05:11.952, Speaker A: Whenever I watch those, I just picture Michael.
01:05:12.016 - 01:05:17.540, Speaker C: Literally, I've banned. Yogurt, all food been banned. Nobody's allowed to take breaks.
01:05:19.400 - 01:05:23.530, Speaker A: We have one food. We have one food that's allowed. It's flaming hot cheetos. So you better.
01:05:25.820 - 01:05:26.570, Speaker D: Nice.
01:05:27.260 - 01:06:01.856, Speaker A: Yeah, I like both those. It actually ties nicely into Michael's prediction at the beginning, which is like, tech shifts from growth into value. And Vance, I think that ties it together. And I also like this idea of kind of these smaller acquisitions or taking companies private, this focus on extreme profitability, which I think the Elon experiment will go well. I think we're all maybe a little biased there, but I think it will go well. And people will see that you can run these companies with like 90% less people and you can actually become profitable.
01:06:02.048 - 01:07:06.456, Speaker D: So this is maybe more in the weeds, but this is sort of an orthogonal point, a prediction that I had, which is just, I think, Dovetails and also kind of runs afoul of Vance's prediction. But most of these companies that we know, like all the tech companies, like the Dropboxes, the Snapchats, those are not going to be the ones that fall into Vance's prediction, mostly because they literally can't. The founders have ten to 120 to one voting shares. And unless it's Drew or Evan who are supportive of this acquisition, it's never going to happen. And so I think you're going to see this absolute dichotomy in the tech industry over companies that have pro governance rights, basically, like the ability for shareholders to actually participate in governance as the way every other company works right now, versus this adjunct thing that happened over the last ten years. Basically after the Facebook IPO, where all the founders were like, I need all the rights and I'm going to have control forever. And it works when it's working, but when it's not working and you've got a cash cow like dropbox that trades at eight and a half billion dollars and prints a billion dollars of cash every year.
01:07:06.456 - 01:07:43.220, Speaker D: And it would be the perfect takeover target. It's been the exact same valuation ever since it went public. Oh, yeah, but it's highly profitable now. It's just the valuation models and the multiples have just shifted downwards for them. But you have this ability to see which companies are pro leaning into governance, and maybe some of these founders will take a stance. But I think 2023 is once the IPO market comes back, and I think it starts to come back in 2023, it's basically been dead all of 2022. But once it comes back, you're going to see like zero of these founder class shares going forward anymore.
01:07:43.960 - 01:08:27.776, Speaker B: I agree with that. There's interesting history to that. I think that originally was proposed by Morgan Stanley and one really famous IPO. I think it was like the Google IPO maybe, or the Facebook IPO or one of them, but Google yeah, which is fascinating. I'm curious, do you guys think because the next logical step after that governance conversation is like stock based compensation. There's a guy, Joseph Wang, who used a pretty interesting analogy of like if you think about these tech companies as like, printing their own currency that they used to pay employees with, suddenly if that currency isn't as valuable, you can do one of two things right. You can either cut that compensation or you have to print more, right, to keep the nominal value the same.
01:08:27.776 - 01:08:34.870, Speaker B: You have to issue more shares to get to where you were. And investors suddenly care about stock based comp, and they're not going to allow that. How do you see that?
01:08:35.560 - 01:09:23.588, Speaker D: This isn't my metric, but I really liked it. I think Brad Gersner for Alternator Capital was the one that really kind of coined it, but he said EBITDA minus stock based compensation is the new net profitability. So basically what you're saying is whatever the actual cash that the company is generating, EBITDA minus however much stock based compensation that is creating every year to generate that cash, is the new net profit. I mean, it is technically part of the calculation for profitability, but investors, when they're looking at things, investors, when they're looking at things, try to reduce things down. That's why you have EBITDA in the first place. Or like the 40% rule where it's like growth plus profitability should equal 40%. So those types of rules of guidance, I think are good.
01:09:23.588 - 01:09:34.710, Speaker D: And this just basic equation, I think is a good way of thinking about what's, like, the real profitability for these businesses or the profit that actually matters. Right?
01:09:39.400 - 01:09:40.350, Speaker C: You it.
01:10:05.080 - 01:10:34.104, Speaker D: It well, they just did that with Koopa. And Koopa is like at 5.7% revenue multiple or 5.7 X revenue multiple, things are not trading at they're not buying them at these massive valuations anymore, which is another point. So sort of an orthogonal tech point. But also sort of crypto or prediction. I think in 2023 you start to see at least two to three, like what you would consider to be traditional crypto funds.
01:10:34.104 - 01:11:11.992, Speaker D: Stop making investments. And the reason why is because they've run out of cash. They just haven't said it yet. And even more so, they aren't able to raise because nobody's going to be able to raise at least in the first half of 2023. And so you're just going to see these crypto funds that you would normally see on a monthly basis announcing new investments, stop making announcements and you'll look back and say, oh wow, the last time they made an investment, or at least an announcement, was in June of 2022. So I think you're going to start to see that. And then the follow up to that would be when they do actually raise, which would probably be in six months to twelve months from then.
01:11:11.992 - 01:11:21.900, Speaker D: So maybe 2024, it's going to be a smaller fund than they previously raised. It'll be the first time I think you see successive funds go smaller.
01:11:22.960 - 01:11:53.380, Speaker C: This is just the nature of the business. A lot of startup deaths now, plus six months, minus six months are kind of when people have started to shut things down, like turn of the year, people want to get on to whatever their next thing is. I think that's real. Also, the burn rate and the amount of cash that they raised in early 2021 for many of these folks just doesn't match up. So I think we're going to see a lot of startup deaths and frankly, there's probably too many startups in crypto right now just for the level of product market fit that we've achieved.
01:11:54.440 - 01:12:19.540, Speaker A: I remembered my prediction took me twelve minutes. I think we moved past the JPEG era of NFTs. I think 2023 is the year of digital, not just in crypto, but in I like that. I like that look. Michael, that means you got a question here. So I think digital is like basically every company right now. I don't know.
01:12:19.540 - 01:12:44.144, Speaker A: I talked to the team at Adidas and they're like the most important customer is this under 18. And the under 18 person is on Fortnite right now. They spend $92 a month on digital goods. Kids age twelve to 17 spend $92 a month on digital goods. And the only way to reach that person is by launching these. Like, yeah, isn't that crazy stat. They have skins, so they have skins.
01:12:44.144 - 01:13:33.444, Speaker A: But imagine you're a company that doesn't have skins. How do you reach them? So the way that they are all thinking about reaching them right now is like the word. I don't know. I heard this on this call for the first time, fidgetal, which is like, imagine you're a 15 year old and you buy a pair of Nikes. Well, you're not just going to get the Nikes that you bought for $100 shipped to your door but you're going to get Nikes Airdropped into your wallet and then you can wear those Nikes in your metaverse of choice or something like that. And so I think the rise of digital, I think basically in the way that ten or 15 years ago every single company had like a social media strategy. I think this year it's like every single company, every exec is going to be asking their team like, what's our web3 digital goods strategy? And that's going to be on the back of things.
01:13:33.444 - 01:14:03.276, Speaker A: Like Nike is going to absolutely crush it. They're already crushing it with their swoosh launch. Like big shout out to their team there. And then also Starbucks, right? I got a demo. Mike knows this. I'm completely red pilled on what Starbucks is doing, but I was very bearish, very anti, big corporates doing crypto stuff because I'm scarred from like 2017 blockchain, not bitcoin Walmart putting their supply chain on the blockchain. And then I got a demo of what Starbucks is doing and it's really freaking cool.
01:14:03.276 - 01:14:55.580, Speaker A: And I think it's basically just like loyalty programs on a massive amount of steroids. And if you think about loyalty programs as something that haven't been innovated on in like ten years, look, is it anything insane? No, but it's just an improvement on loyalty programs and every single company wants to improve their loyalty program. So I think huge year for brands getting into NFTs. NFTs move beyond just like JPEG era. That being said, I think there are going to be generational buying opportunities for the blue chip JPEG NFTs. I think blue chip JPEGs are going to be a multibillion dollar asset class and we'll see generational buying opportunities for things like crypto punks. I don't own crypto punks, by the way, but the tier one of the JPEGs and the rest of them will all die.
01:14:57.040 - 01:15:02.892, Speaker D: Since Vance and I were doing Hashley's, we've been saying that utility has to be the driving force of value for NFTs.
01:15:02.956 - 01:15:05.040, Speaker C: It's only five years.
01:15:05.190 - 01:15:08.068, Speaker D: Yeah, next. We're still not there yet.
01:15:08.154 - 01:15:20.548, Speaker A: Well, I think we'll get it. I think we'll get NFTs with utility and more nuanced, more personalized, also much more commercial NFT drops. But that's just the way the NFT space is going to go.
01:15:20.714 - 01:15:23.348, Speaker D: Damn. $92 a month. That's a lot of paper, dude.
01:15:23.364 - 01:15:33.850, Speaker B: I was trying to back in this. I was 7th grade at that point. I did not have close to $92 a month to spend on that kind of stuff. Absolutely not. Let me ask you.
01:15:36.320 - 01:15:40.510, Speaker A: I got that from a blockworks thing, so I hope that fact is right.
01:15:42.400 - 01:16:07.408, Speaker B: Good plug either way. Does this impact like, you know, the Gabe Layton sort of thesis about how NFTs are going to get people in? Does that intersect at all with your wallet? Think if people are all getting into opening up a wallet, right, because they're corporate NFT or whatever, does that impact? Do you think we see like, NFT based wallets or how does that intersect.
01:16:07.424 - 01:16:43.552, Speaker A: With your wallet thesis? You probably will get wallets that just have a much better friendliness for non crypto people. I think wallets right now are all about the crypto asset. They treat crypto like an investment, which it is, but that's what all wallets are based around. I think you'll start to see wallets that are based around your home for your digital life. Like, everything you do in your digital life will be inside your wallet. And I don't think wallets have that mentality now, but I'm sure some will.
01:16:43.686 - 01:16:53.232, Speaker D: So just to beat a dead horse here, that's where the custodial wallet experience that exists on an iOS device has to happen. Imagine RFID tagging.
01:16:53.376 - 01:16:59.188, Speaker A: Did you guys just make an investment in, like, a custodial wallet that is doing no, no.
01:16:59.274 - 01:17:11.610, Speaker D: Just think about it, though. Like RFID tagging. Instead of paying for something with Apple Pay, you tag off to be able to get access to the loyalty program, and that drops an NFT into your wallet on your.
01:17:14.960 - 01:17:18.392, Speaker A: So anyway, it's a big year for brands. Brands.
01:17:18.536 - 01:17:19.404, Speaker C: Boys, I got to run.
01:17:19.442 - 01:17:22.828, Speaker A: NFTs. Yeah.
01:17:22.994 - 01:17:24.140, Speaker D: All right, fellas.
01:17:24.560 - 01:17:25.712, Speaker C: Thank you for a good year.
01:17:25.766 - 01:17:26.880, Speaker A: Last part of the year.
01:17:27.030 - 01:17:31.170, Speaker C: Yeah. When we started this, I didn't know what to expect. It's been a lot of fun.
01:17:32.500 - 01:17:34.290, Speaker A: Did you like my holiday present?
01:17:35.380 - 01:17:37.590, Speaker C: It's kind of sad that you didn't pay people.
01:17:41.480 - 01:17:42.928, Speaker A: I was like, this guy's probably sitting.
01:17:42.944 - 01:17:48.790, Speaker C: On his couch, get some random ping from Yano, get up and go to that same thing that you've done a thousand times.
01:17:51.240 - 01:17:57.400, Speaker A: It was really just a way to get a new podcast listener. He said he's going to listen to the pod, so we're good.
01:17:57.550 - 01:17:58.056, Speaker C: I love it.
01:17:58.078 - 01:18:00.810, Speaker D: I showed my entire family that, and they were just like.
01:18:03.600 - 01:18:09.848, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyways, good note to end it on. It's been an awesome year, guys. And to everyone who's listening, appreciate you guys listening.
01:18:09.864 - 01:18:10.430, Speaker C: Later.
01:18:10.800 - 01:18:11.290, Speaker D: Thanks, everyone.
