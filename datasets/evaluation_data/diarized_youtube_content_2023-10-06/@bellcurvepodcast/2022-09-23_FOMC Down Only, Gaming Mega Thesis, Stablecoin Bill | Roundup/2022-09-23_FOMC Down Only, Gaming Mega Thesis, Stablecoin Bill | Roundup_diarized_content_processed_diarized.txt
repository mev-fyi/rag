00:00:00.170 - 00:00:23.760, Speaker A: You know, it's like people showing up with horses to World War I. You know, like when there's tanks on the field, it's like, oh, shit. Like, did we misjudge this? I think, you know, that's kind of like where this might be going. It's like, congratulations, you have this algo stablecoin. It's integrated into approximately zero games because, you know, that's not just not what consumers want and we just need to build for a broader consumer constituency. I think that's where we're going.
00:00:24.290 - 00:00:45.446, Speaker B: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy. All right, guys, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You're joined by Michael's One and Two and Vance no Yano today. Getting married. Choosing marriage over a podcast.
00:00:45.446 - 00:00:52.074, Speaker B: I don't know what's up with that guy. Yeah, cut. I know. We'd have to have a serious talk when he gets back. It's pretty messed up that he's doing this.
00:00:52.192 - 00:00:54.026, Speaker A: Are you more dedicated to this pod.
00:00:54.058 - 00:01:31.370, Speaker B: Or your wife exactly? Well, I hear he's getting a massive dowry for the wedding, so it all kind of levels out if you do it of self interest. Yeah. All right, guys, it's been a little bit of a light week for stories, but we have this thing we were going to talk about markets. I keep getting called Macro Mike, so I hate bringing up charts on this podcast anymore, but any takeaways from basically FOMC happened this week. Basically it's just down, only it's all doom and gloom. Dollars ripping up yields, ripping up everything going down. Is there any takeaways other than that? Like any nuance that I'm missing?
00:01:31.950 - 00:02:02.878, Speaker A: The charts aren't looking good, boys. I don't know. I'm like high level. I'm still a firm believer in you probably should be bearish when interest rates are at zero and people are buying mortgages by the hundreds of billions per month. And you should probably lean the other way when the world is about to end. The dollar is taking out its 25 year high to ten years above 4%. It feels like you kind of need to lean against the crowd in a lot in a lot of scenarios.
00:02:02.878 - 00:02:05.566, Speaker A: And this is certainly kind of one of them, at least in our opinion.
00:02:05.758 - 00:02:56.030, Speaker C: So one thing that I thought was really interesting is actually as soon as the announcement happened and 75 basis points was the official announcement, markets actually went higher. And then what happened was Chair Powell comes in and says we actually might be going through a correction in the housing market. And that's when markets so I think it's more nuanced than just what is the number, what's the top line figure? But man, if we're going to about to go through a recession in the housing market, things are going to get a lot tougher. Especially given the fact that mortgage rates so not only mortgage rates have gone up, they go up with interest rates. The amount of mortgage payment per month has, in some charts I've seen, has two or three X. So imagine your variable rate mortgage has just 300% increase. Like, that sucks.
00:02:56.110 - 00:03:22.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a chart out there that it's like the percentage of disposable income that goes to your mortgage. And when housing prices were rising, that percentage was actually going down because of what interest rates were doing. But now it's this historic rise and it's more than doubled. It's like six and a half percent or something like that. And it was below three nine months ago. So it's like that percentage of disposable income is just way, way up.
00:03:22.660 - 00:03:23.454, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:03:23.652 - 00:03:43.474, Speaker B: Yeah. Have you guys looked for housing recently? I feel like I whine about this all the time, but I live in Williamsburg. Man, it was insanity trying to find an apartment. They don't even exist still. Yeah, like a month ago I probably saw 20. It was like to give you ballpark figures. I feel like you probably could have gotten an apartment, like rented a place.
00:03:43.474 - 00:04:06.566, Speaker B: It was like decent for like $2,700 a month, like one bedroom. Now it's like there's nothing. Don't even bother looking if it's below four, like a month. And there are people, they're like bidding wars. Like, you go to these apartments and it's like there's a line out the door and you got to put down I got a place. I had to put down a deposit site unseen for an apartment. And I just saw the listing 30 minutes before that's.
00:04:06.566 - 00:04:10.442, Speaker B: How ridiculous it still is. Yeah, pretty nice.
00:04:10.576 - 00:04:40.498, Speaker A: Everyone's trying to sell their house. It feels like they're cutting rent prices. Like, if you show up at the open house, I think you win. It's kind of like the opposite in many effects, but wow, not entirely surprising. In San Francisco specifically, it feels like kind of like all the Enterprise Sales Team Bros. Have moved out and that has constituted a large part of the population of where Michael and I live, which is we're not going to give exact locations, but like the north side of the city. I don't know, it kind of like depends on where you live, honestly.
00:04:40.498 - 00:04:42.326, Speaker A: San Francisco prices have gone down over.
00:04:42.348 - 00:04:54.650, Speaker C: The past two years and there's a really interesting article. There's actually been a few articles that have come out about it. By the end of 2022, 40%, 40% of San Francisco commercial real estate will be vacant.
00:04:56.190 - 00:04:57.638, Speaker B: Think about that. Wild.
00:04:57.814 - 00:05:11.166, Speaker C: There's 75 million sqft commercial in San Francisco and something like 32 of the 75 is going to be vacant. There's going to be a lot of really interesting changes that come through in this market.
00:05:11.348 - 00:05:26.930, Speaker A: Insane is either going to nuke itself or it's going to have some sort of rebrand into, like I don't even know what. But it feels like the city leaders are starting to kind of realize it and tack a little bit further into the we love technology wind that they use to embrace.
00:05:27.270 - 00:05:47.834, Speaker B: Yeah. What is your guys opinion? I don't want to go too far down the just san Francisco route, but I've been to san Francisco like two or three times in my life. Always seemed pretty good to me. The way people describe it in the last like two years is like it's falling into the ocean. It is. Sodom and gomorrah over there like fire and brimstone is all but raining down. What's going on?
00:05:47.872 - 00:05:48.460, Speaker A: Over.
00:05:51.010 - 00:06:35.674, Speaker C: Interesting. Yeah. What is going on? Well, so I think you have a really interesting mix of some of the most progressive people in positions of power. You also have one of the largest, if not the largest, I think, metropolitan budget per year, but you also have one of the largest homeless. So you put that all together and you get into a situation that I think is going to have to change. San francisco leadership has done basically everything to root out all the economic centers in the city. And I think a lot of the people that live know, myself included, I think vansfield is the same way.
00:06:35.674 - 00:06:52.160, Speaker C: Frankly, I love san francisco because of the proximity to all the places around San Francisco. The city itself is know the reason why you live there. In my mind, it's the proximity to lake tahoe, it's the proximity to marin, and right now the city itself has to reinvent itself.
00:06:53.330 - 00:07:17.798, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I moved here after the gold rush. I moved here right before the pandemic and so I never even really got to see San Francisco at its time. And so what I've experienced in San Francisco is super intense work. Everyone's shitting on it, telling me I need to move. But the people who move to miami and new York, I haven't found a lot of super long term happiness stories there. And like, Michael and I's lives are pretty small.
00:07:17.798 - 00:07:38.800, Speaker A: We go to work, we kind of work out, wake up, walk the dog, whatever. It's like pretty self contained. It's a beautiful city, so I like it. And the more people shit on it, the more I kind of find a reason that it can kind of reinvent itself because all of the things that people shit on it for are either irrelevant or those people have already moved out. So it's kind of like you can mold it to whatever you want, which is cool.
00:07:39.250 - 00:08:01.382, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you guys think about, I mean, markets? It's really weird. If you look at just like what the nasdaq did basically after the FOMC was like this weird spike when it got the 75 basis point hike and then to your point, Michael. Yeah. It's basically been dumping since maybe on fears of some sort of housing recession. It doesn't actually seem like crypto has reacted that negatively. It hasn't been great.
00:08:01.382 - 00:08:43.940, Speaker B: I'm not going to look at these charts and be like, hell yeah, but it could be a lot worse. I sort of think so. I don't know if you guys have any opinion on that. And the other thing I'd love to get your thoughts on advanced. We were kind of talking about how at the tail end of a bull market, when everyone's kind of accepted the bears, there's like this last people are kind of holding on to their bags in general, but very often anything out of with very few exceptions, right, like ETH kind of being one of them from the last cycle. Most of these coins will basically never hit their all time highs again. So I'd be curious to get your take on just overall state of the crypto market and then maybe specifically why that tends to be the case, why some of the high flyers from past cycles, they never kind of break through.
00:08:44.870 - 00:09:18.830, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, this is something that we've noticed with people we talk to junior people on our team that are kind of like when the market comes back and this dgen d fire, super crazy NFT PFP projects come back. And at. Sometimes you don't have the heart to tell them that, hey, it's going to not be the same, and it's going to be way different. And that's almost like the point. In the summer of 2018, all of these people were basically saying that the ICO market would come back and then it would be interesting and that would be kind of the thing that would push the market forward. Just basically like a return of old behavior that was not sustainable.
00:09:18.830 - 00:10:13.034, Speaker A: And for us, that just doesn't feel likely where the market is going or towards things like games or to projects with utility or things like regulated DeFi or at least more institutionally oriented DeFi. Things like we've talked about like Xmargin and maple and things like that. Those are the things that we think are going to be powerful. But as a result, you have all these people holding onto these old concepts very strongly and they don't want to let them go. And I think that's kind of like the next phase of the bear market that we're going into where people are just kind of like, all right, uncle, whatever, what we're doing isn't working. So we kind of need to throw all the cards in the air and see what lands face up and then go after that. And I think what I look for what are the really compelling alternative visions for the future that people can push forward crypto towards and I think gaming and specifically free to own and things that have a low barrier to entry.
00:10:13.034 - 00:10:38.934, Speaker A: Those are the things which get us excited on the consumer side. And one of these podcasts that we listen to with Gabe Laden, the whole thing is he's calling out like Axi the PFP mania, like all the games on the Ethel One as we know them, it's 60,000 daily active addresses. If we grow that ten X, it shouldn't be that hard. We can build something disproportionately valuable. We don't need to hold on to all these things that we kind of remember from the last bull market because frankly, most of them won't come back.
00:10:39.132 - 00:11:34.262, Speaker C: I mean, ten X, what about like 100 or 1000 X? 60,000 is nothing, right? Yeah, I think one of the other things too is that so totally agree with everything Van said. What's going on in the markets right now is you can't sell when you've already sold everything. And I think at this point we're kind of reaching that rock bottom place where there aren't any more for sellers, there aren't any more liquidations that are happening that require people to get rid of their assets. You're starting to find in a lot of these assets, I think, what you could consider to be deep value. And you're now looking at it in terms of what's this thing actually worth. And to go back to the other point that Van said, all these things are really going to have to change their narrative. There's going to have to be a new narrative that drives this stuff forward in every single cycle in crypto.
00:11:34.262 - 00:12:30.586, Speaker C: It's a new thing that pulls everything out. And right now I would agree. I think gaming is the only viable chance, but it's also probably the best viable chance that we have to get 100 million monthly active people with wallet addresses. Maybe they don't necessarily know it it's a custodial wallet that they're interacting with, but they're going to have a wallet on the back end of whatever they're transacting with. And I don't think it's going to be something where you buy an in game asset for $10 because you expect to be able to sell it for 1000 in a week. I think it's going to be more like you buy an in game asset, you use it, you play with it, it has fundamental utility and maybe you sell it for $12 or 15 or maybe even like five. But the speculative nature of what all these assets have been so far is, I think actually at ODS with the adoption curve that we'll see with games, the second you have the ability to have something go 100 X or ten X, even, the game is over.
00:12:30.768 - 00:13:32.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to get into games. I just want to get one your take on one more just about DApps, like the ability to underwrite DApps, let's say more in DeFi. I think one of the reasons too, why old coins basically never see all time highs is probably they're just like paradigm changes, right? And it's very tough to keep up with new things in crypto cycles. But I also think one of the pretty consistent things that drives adoption in crypto thus far has been rewarding early users. And I think one of the reasons why it's difficult for DApps to succeed across multiple different cycles is in one cycle you kind of give away all the rewards that sort of make sense to give away. And then you're competing with other DApps that may or may not have a better, more improved product, but they haven't blown their proverbial load, so to speak, on all the rewards right out of the gate. So do you see that as being like a major impediment for why some of these DApps don't tend to persist over multiple cycles or ever reach their high again or what do you think?
00:13:32.292 - 00:14:34.254, Speaker C: There's a really interesting chart that I think Chris Dixon put out which is basically like the network effects with tokens applied to them. And a lot of his point was we can break down the cold start problem by incentivizing people with tokens. You can jump into a network, you can be incentivized for being early, you can get access to the network and appreciate in the value in the network as it grows. The problem with that though, is that what happens when you have the long term effects of when people aren't receiving the same amount of tokens, where you have the early class of users who are rich with tokens, but the 10 million in first person that joins the network isn't able to get the same amount of value. And that, I think, is kind of where a lot of that model breaks down. And we have yet to see a good kind of use of tokens to be able to solve that problem. We haven't hit anything that has 10 million or even really a million daily active users.
00:14:34.254 - 00:15:13.310, Speaker C: But you can imagine a situation where if you don't have the ability to incentivize people at that late stage think about the comparison of the value that you get from joining Twitter as the 10,000,000th user. Well, the fact that you're joining Twitter means that there's this whole network, there's this whole communication and content that's in there and it's actually more valuable at the later stages than at the early stages. With tokens, it's the reverse. I think we really need to think long and hard about how you make it. The 10,000,000th user is just as valuable using a token model as opposed to what you would get if you're joining a social network.
00:15:13.730 - 00:15:49.546, Speaker A: Yes, most token emission curves look like this. They go down, then they flatten. And if you look at helium, they've spent the meat of their token emissions on getting these hotspots distributed. And it's not clear that they're in the right hands of the right people. It's not clear it's like the right network functionality or bandwidth or the right part of the spectrum. I think you're going to see a lot of these token projects that really tried to hit escape velocity with this first shot of tokens and now don't have as many to kind of go around for the next whatever they're trying to do. And that's another way you can lose is just like you shoot your shot too early.
00:15:49.728 - 00:16:16.898, Speaker B: Yeah. There's another funny thing about how tokens work as opposed to equity. Equity. And maybe this is a holdover from the way Bitcoin worked with its kind of hard cap fixed supply, 21 million. But a lot of these tokens, when they come out, they're like, hey, this is how many tokens I have. And then they kind of break it down into these different use cases, some of it's for the community or the developers or for incentives or whatever. And there's this idea that you can't go over that supply, but that's not how equity works.
00:16:16.898 - 00:16:47.166, Speaker B: Right? You sit down and you have a cap table, but then you issue new shares either at every new funding round or whenever the board basically says you can. Right. There are these kind of predetermined milestones. It's just a funny thing in terms of maybe that's something that exists right now that shouldn't really necessarily exist, because why would you put a hard cap on the amount that you could issue? It's a question of if you can get more in return for what you pay out in equity. Right. It's a capital compounding problem, not a hard cap problem.
00:16:47.268 - 00:17:40.382, Speaker C: I think look at what Adobe did last week with Figma, or supposedly we'll do with Figma when that deal closes. $20 billion acquisition. Ten of it was in cash, but ten of it was just in stock that was issued. It's the ability to take this cap table, this existing liquid asset that trades every single day on the Nasdaq and create more of it to go off and buy a company. I would love to see the data, and I think I've seen it from a couple of years ago, but it's somewhere around like 3% is the average inflation of stock per year per, I think, New York Stock Exchange or maybe Nasdaq, but on average, three to percent. Four of stock is issued just in compensation to people that work there for acquisitions. And that's the net of buybacks as well.
00:17:40.382 - 00:17:48.260, Speaker C: So even with buybacks being one of the core value drivers of these different equities, you're still seeing a positive inflation rate.
00:17:48.950 - 00:18:15.180, Speaker B: It's really interesting. I'd love to get your guys thoughts on just gaming in general. There's a really great podcast, actually, from Gabe Layton. It was a good suggestion. Vance, maybe before we get into the specifics of that pod, I know you guys are pretty opinionated on this and are looking into it pretty aggressively. Could you just lay out what's your thesis for gaming in web three? I know you guys are very positive on it, but if you could just kind of lay out what your overall framework for what it is and what the opportunity is.
00:18:15.630 - 00:18:37.086, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think it's like, for us, less of are Michael and I gaming people? No, I mean, we're like consumer technology people. Michael work at Snapchat. I work at Netflix. We both have lots of friends that work in the gaming community, but we're not super overzealous like StarCraft Nerds. We used to play all those games, but that isn't kind of like core.
00:18:37.118 - 00:18:37.586, Speaker C: To who we are.
00:18:37.608 - 00:19:12.006, Speaker A: I think what the things that interest us more are just like the market dynamics within gaming and as it transitions over to crypto. So on the demand side, you have 3 billion people a year who play games. There's a billion five people who make less than $7 a day who have an internet connection. And so these are going to be the first natural users of these games because it's probably not going to be play to earn. It might be like play and earn as like a byproduct. And so that's powerful. And so you have the latent demand and these people look and feel and act like crypto native users.
00:19:12.006 - 00:19:53.430, Speaker A: They do things in digitally endogenous ecosystems and they transact in virtual currencies. It's like we're close cousins, somewhere along the line we got separated. And so that's the demand side. The supply side is all of the game developers in the world who for the past ten years have relied on mobile free to play advertising to power their business model. And right now there's a thing called IDFA, which is the unique identifier that developers use to track users across different devices. And they use that to retarget them with ads. And the retargeting is basically the most powerful aspect of the e commerce advertising ecosystem that stands today, where it's like, you have more data, you retarget, you get more specific, like you get better CAC, you get better LTV.
00:19:53.430 - 00:20:20.562, Speaker A: And that's kind of like, really the thing that powers the flywheel. Apple removed that and you can see that in Facebook's earnings. They went down a lot. They went down Snapchat's earnings. I think that was like Q four of last year when they got announced and Snapchat blamed them. And so all of these developers, the supply side, are basically saying we can't make any money. Our current business model, we need some sort of new type of game that we can build that has some sort of new monetization and we need to have it done fast.
00:20:20.562 - 00:20:51.070, Speaker A: And so 70% of all pitches that we see are games. And it's kind of like this refugee movement of we're coming to this new land and they have all these shiny new objects and we create new games and it's better monetization. People are already getting rich. And so you have the demand, you have the supply. And I think in between that, you have the blockchain. And the blockchain is just something that you're seeing new emergent behavior, whether it be things like Dark Forest or whether it be things like Stepan, or whether it be things like Axie. Call them speculative, call them whatever you want.
00:20:51.070 - 00:21:29.670, Speaker A: There's something there on some dimension that's working. And so, yeah, I think that is the reason for our bullishness. I also think it's kind of like these are the times in the bear market where you need people to come up with compelling alternative visions and shared goals for the whole ecosystem to go towards and by process of elimination, DeFi, I don't think is going to be the thing that pulls us out of it. I think it's going to be a very large industry that benefits from the upswing, but it's not going to be the thing that actually catalyzes that movement. Music is too small. Content ecommerce is just like not quite there yet. And gaming is the world's biggest market.
00:21:29.670 - 00:21:42.062, Speaker A: We're seeing all the pitches. Like process of elimination, this is where we're going. And I think the thing that we have that a lot of people don't is like we see 3000 pitches a year. We see everything. We have the bird's eye view.
00:21:42.196 - 00:21:44.990, Speaker B: 3000 pitches. That is so many.
00:21:45.140 - 00:22:19.020, Speaker A: I mean, on any dividend day we have probably five people taking probably like five to ten pitches each and over 365 days that adds up. And so yeah, we see a lot of stuff and all of it's launching in Q one. So we're going to find out pretty quickly if we're right or wrong. And it'll take some time, but it's not something that we have to wait ten years for is the point. This is a rival vision of the future for 2023, 2024, which I think what people are looking for right now.
00:22:20.030 - 00:23:10.890, Speaker C: And fully agree with all of that. The only things that I would add just to hammer these points home 3 billion monthly active users around the world. 200 million yearly revenue which is larger than music, movies and art combined. The entire industry of music, movies and art, that's kind of the scale that we're talking about. Free to Play represents about 100 of the 200. And the way that free to Play monetizes is you have on average somewhere between like one and four, one and 3% of your users who are actually buying things in game. And this is a lot of what the podcast talks about, but Free to Play was this movement that basically everybody in the game world said no way, never going to happen, not going to be a viable business and completely changed the game industry forever.
00:23:10.890 - 00:23:56.374, Speaker C: I think if you think about 1% to 3% monetization, but you're spending all that money and the second that you as a player of this game spend that money in game, you're buying virtual currency, you're buying virtual assets, you're spending it. The second that you stop playing the game, the money's gone. It has literally left your wallet and gone to the developer and that's it. If on the other hand, you were ascribing value to something that had a secondary marketplace for it, you had the ability to recoup some of that value. Maybe if the game gets successful and you have something that's a more rare item. You can actually realize a profit on top of the money that you spend in game. Well, what do you think that monetization rate goes to? I mean, our guess is probably it goes up ten x.
00:23:56.374 - 00:24:32.782, Speaker C: You're talking about like 10% to 30% of people actually monetizing in game if they have a pretty solid understanding that they can recoup a lot of the value. And so are these games going to be differentiated? Yeah, totally, eventually. But right now they look and feel exactly like the games that we've been playing for the last ten years. The major difference is the business model behind them. And I think that's where we're seeing a lot of this aggregation of games ultimately get to in the next call. It twelve to 18 months. It's really just kind of the same games and people know how to build games, people know how to build successful, fun to play games.
00:24:32.782 - 00:24:56.140, Speaker C: But now you're talking about a ten to 30% monetization rate and a new business model behind it. So I think that's really what's going to be the first powerful narrative. Eventually you're going to have these games that are interesting because they have a marketplace, but it's just going to take a while for people and frankly, all of the interactions that people are used to, it's going to take a while for them to get used to a marketplace as well.
00:24:56.910 - 00:25:33.494, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to make sure I'm understanding kind of the and then we can kind of get into free to own, right, the Gabe Laden sort of thing. But basically it's the idea that of this gaming market that exists today, it's roughly 50%. So about $100 million worth of that is what's free to play is the terminology for it. Yeah. And that's basically you get monetized through ingaming their ads. Or does that include buying things like you're buying like a hammer or something or some sort of upgrade or whatever for and gamers hate that because you don't want to basically be able to pay your way right, to being better in the game.
00:25:33.494 - 00:25:39.240, Speaker B: It's kind of like it's seen as not great, obviously, right. You kind of want to actually earn it.
00:25:40.590 - 00:26:07.700, Speaker C: Pay to win is actually a pretty dominant narrative in different geographies. And one of the things that I think is really interesting here is that every kind of population has a different dominant game or game type. Pay to win is actually really popular in China and parts of Asia. It's not as popular in the US and EU, but you can have models where paying to win is the dominant game model.
00:26:08.150 - 00:26:39.822, Speaker B: So in China they're like, all right, enough of this bullshit. I just want to win this game. I will pay, I will win this game. So what's the one thing that I don't know? If you guys ever played a lot of games, I wouldn't have called myself a gamer, but I. Definitely played a good amount of Xbox, and I definitely remember doing things like I played a lot of Halo Three was kind of my game. And I do remember going on these quests, right? And the friction for going on these quests was enormous because I couldn't drive at that point. I had to ask my mom, take me to Toys R US, get the guidebook for the game.
00:26:39.822 - 00:27:13.862, Speaker B: Then I had to compete. I had to re beat the quest that I already beat on on Legendary Value. Then I got collect these skulls and I got this hayabusa armor. And the whole reason I did that is because I had three nerd friends that would come over and I'd be like, you see this armor? Let's go. You see this? Yeah, very tight. So just imagine the amount of friction that I had to go through for a relatively small reward is basically the idea for how NFTs and how NFTs and games kind of end up. You increase the size of that market.
00:27:13.862 - 00:27:24.460, Speaker B: Is there's interoperability between, okay, I can take this NFT out of this game and move it into that game? Is that kind of the idea? Or how do we increase the amount of people that are spending money in game?
00:27:24.990 - 00:28:04.134, Speaker A: It's not about the interoperability. I think that's actually one of the things that doesn't make sense with gaming pitches. It's like, we're going to take this sword and this perfectly balanced crypto economy and we're going to put it into this other crypto economy that doesn't have a concept of a sword and it's going to be awesome, but really it's just going to mess up everything. We just don't really believe that. Maybe if they're like close cousins and it's like the crypto Halo Two versus Halo Three, you can bring it over like TBD. But I think the more compelling thing is the price points to get into these games are very meaningful. And the economics of the revenue that's generated is extraordinarily powerwall distribution where it's like 3% to Michael's point.
00:28:04.134 - 00:28:57.974, Speaker A: If you don't have things that you need to pay for and you can instead incentivize this game where you mint the NFT that NFT has future rights to more NFTs, you incentivize this velocity based economy instead of this aggregate dollar based economy. You don't have to charge people a ton of money. You can just have them have these NFTs and have actual upside ownership in the game. And that's enough to get just the rate of monetization up. And so you look at the 60,000 daily addresses on Ethereum today, they are spending a lot of money, but they're also creating a lot of value for themselves and others who are holding these collections of PFPs. And that is the core concept where instead of having this very kind of predatory monetization CAC and LTB based game, you're actually creating something that has communal value. And so sure, maybe people are spending more money on that.
00:28:57.974 - 00:29:34.546, Speaker A: But the Digidiq NFT PFP collection that's already traded $70 million of volume, like $70 million of value has been created. And so, sure, if you rake 10% of that, you're going to add to your game's economics. And that's what's fundamentally powerful. And if we can have people get their first so there's like two other concepts which are really interesting in the Gabe Laden podcast. One is this concept of the billion dollar NFT. And right now, if you look at Apple, the most expensive thing that you can buy on Apple is $100. Blows that up, that model changes completely.
00:29:34.546 - 00:30:12.078, Speaker A: It's hard to understate how important that is. And so that's kind of like one big thing where you just have these new SKUs that you can create. You can have a billion dollar NFT that's communally owned, managed, all these different things are possible. But the second part is just like there's only 60,000 daily addresses on ETH, something special about what's happening on Ethereum. And the concept of ETH is money. Where we've always thought about how do you onboard someone into web three, I'm just going to send you ETH. It's like, what do I do with that ETH? Just look at it's there.
00:30:12.078 - 00:30:14.770, Speaker A: It's like, no, it's like, here's an NFT. It's in a game.
00:30:14.920 - 00:30:18.260, Speaker B: If it's going up, actually, it's pretty good. That actually works.
00:30:21.350 - 00:30:41.180, Speaker A: If you have someone that's playing a game that has an NFT, that's like legging their way towards a whole ETH, onboarding people into ETH, the currency via games is like something else. That's crazy. That's how ETH gets back to 15,000 ETH spent per day at five K per ETH. That's what drives that. In my mind. It's basically the only thing that can.
00:30:41.710 - 00:31:09.326, Speaker B: Yeah, to piggyback on that concept. It was actually a little bit of a light bulb for me, listening to him describe maybe what almost the customer journey of how people might get into crypto and end up holding more ETH, because I had always been thinking of it from the perspective of games and ETH. Kind of makes sense because if you're a kid, again, going back to my days playing Halo, if you did want to buy something online, I'd like, borrow my mom's credit card. It would be much easier, right, if you had a way to obfuscate that.
00:31:09.348 - 00:31:09.486, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:09.508 - 00:31:25.874, Speaker B: I think kids would want to spend money on games, but it's like, how do you do that? Because they would have to buy E, so how would they do that? But honestly, getting an NFT and then having them acquire ETH that way actually seems like the much more intuitive now that I see it, that's probably a more intuitive way to get people into the ecosystem.
00:31:26.002 - 00:32:13.430, Speaker C: I mean, he's the one that coined it, but Free to Own is the replacement for Free to Play. And being able to have ownership in an NFT that relates to a game in maybe even a fungible token that relates to the governance of the, like, these aspects of ownership. I think there's a lot of value that you can ascribe to that. And one of the examples that he gave is I think it was the reddit NFTs that were giving away for free. Imagine just like having an NFT and just the ability to say that it's in my wallet, I can prove that it's there. And maybe it's worth 510, 15, $100, who knows? But I got this thing for free. I think free to own is actually going to be the mechanism and it all relates to ownership.
00:32:14.010 - 00:32:51.406, Speaker A: The other thing I think is missing is like, so assume that my twelve year old cousin gets into this stuff and I give him his first NFT, it's free to own. And he's playing into the game and he's trying to leg that into ETH. I think the NFT markets will change where it's all like NFTs for ETH basis. I think we're going to see kind of like swap markets come into being very popular, where it's like, I have these two halo skulls. I'll trade you for the Hayabusa armor. Because if you're twelve years old, that's conceptually what makes the most sense to you because you're like, I have this thing, I'm trading for that thing. I'm eventually going to leg my way into ETH.
00:32:51.406 - 00:32:58.900, Speaker A: But it's not just going to be like, I have this one Ft straight shot to ETH. There's more imaginations that you need to go through for that to really work.
00:32:59.670 - 00:33:42.130, Speaker B: Do you think Axi tried to build and I think still has I don't know if anyone uses it but Ronan, right? So there was a period of time where I think they also saw this in game economy that they were building. And there was a point where it was like, well, are we going to basically leverage existing DEXes or are we going to try to build our own Dex that I think ended up still leveraging uniswap. But I guess my question to you guys is because to your point, I think there is an enormous advantage for building in game financial infrastructure so that you can have better utility on these NFTs that you're playing with or doing whatever. Do you think that these game ecosystems are going to be the ones that build them, or are they going to leverage primitives that are getting built in DeFi?
00:33:44.630 - 00:33:54.098, Speaker A: I think there's going to be a new model for DEXes. Okay. Launch on avalanche. C chain.
00:33:54.274 - 00:33:55.030, Speaker C: All right, great.
00:33:55.100 - 00:34:29.426, Speaker A: Is there a Dex? Is there lending? Is there Bridging? Okay, there's none of those things. All right, should we got to go build them? All right. I don't have blockchain devs. Where do I get them? Do I ask the Avalanche Foundation? Those are the conversations that we have with a lot of people where it's like the last mile of infrastructure is things they don't think about, what we think are going to kind of dominate. These C chains and other stuff like that are kind of like these payment for order flow models where it's like these super modular DEXes that can deploy in the drop of a hat. You don't need to vote through uniswap V Three governance and see how everyone's feeling. It's just like, okay, cool, there's some payment forward flow model.
00:34:29.426 - 00:34:53.270, Speaker A: It's based on a Cosmos chain that can interoperate with anything. And the model we're describing is Dflow. It's just a port code. Obviously we're biased, but it's just like this idea that you don't need to go through all these hoops and things. You can just deploy these DEXes that are instantly liquid to whatever degree you want on any chain. And I think that's going to be the model that wins, especially when these games are going across more chains. They have their own chains.
00:34:53.270 - 00:34:56.650, Speaker A: Things are going to start fragmenting and I think that's going to be a big trend.
00:34:57.150 - 00:36:01.098, Speaker C: So totally agree. The model right now, which I still think that we're stuck in maybe what we call like web two gaming mental models, every single game and every single game publisher wants to own their own marketplace. You know, they don't want to have like they don't want to integrate with Openc. They want to have StarCraft Marketplace or Starcraft.com slash Marketplace and have that be the place where you can transact StarCraft assets. And because they are in this mental model of owning the IP, managing their own assets, and maintaining basically this ecosystem that is the dominant game model for how places like Epic became Epic because they just owned everything within. And ultimately what that means is it just furthers the point on if you're going to have fragmentation around the user experience of where these assets are transacting and trading hands, you're going to need something like payment for order flow, the ability to have these disjointed marketplaces instead of unified liquidity.
00:36:01.098 - 00:36:09.490, Speaker C: So I think it does ultimately go back to a protocol that's unified, but it's going to look and feel like everything is its own marketplace and its own ecosystem.
00:36:10.710 - 00:36:52.190, Speaker B: Difficult to predict too, for sure. I want to move through a couple other stories here. So there's a stablecoin bill that's I guess in draft right now that's definitely getting a lot of attention. I guess no one should really be that surprised about this after Terra blew up and Liz Warren basically said that this was going to happen, but the news just kind of came out this week. So give me 2 seconds. My notes are loading, but all right, so basically this is the background, which is all right, so US. Lawmakers are reportedly drafting a house stablecoin bill and that would place a two year ban on endogenously collateralized.
00:36:52.190 - 00:37:40.480, Speaker B: You know, just read algo stablecoins. It also mandates a study on Terra like tokens from the treasury. And they're working in consultation with the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC, and the also, the draft is supposed to contain guidance on how even fiat backed or fiat pegged stables should be regulated. It would allow both banks and non banks to issue the stables, but there's an increased layer of regulation. So for banks you would need approval from federal regulators like the OCC. If you're a non bank issuer, which I guess that'd be like a circle, then you would have to work the legislation directs the Federal Reserve is responsible for establishing a process for making application decisions and basically how that would curious, you know, I'll just kind of stop there, but I'm curious what's your guys take on this.
00:37:41.490 - 00:38:57.240, Speaker A: There's a lot of bills that get proposed, not all of them, not like 99% of them don't go anywhere, especially at a time where there's like a pretty evenly split divide between the two parties in both the Senate and Congress. So I think that's the first thing I've seen people saying that this is going into effect at the end of the year. We're going to even see this get to vote by the end of the year. I do think having some regulation on stablecoins probably makes sense. One aspect of crypto that I think we should work to actively reduce is kind of like denialistic, super speculative side of it and it feels like some of the worst actors in the space for whatever reason, are building these algo stablecoins. I think there is a legitimate search for a decentralized stablecoin, but we probably should have some sort of guardrails around it and that probably isn't like a super popular take, but whatever. Because I think that's ultimately the road to mass adoption, like getting a stable coin where JPMorgan and Goldman and whoever else can interact with like that just is going to onboard so much capital and bring so much value and we're going to have to sacrifice some ends of the spectrum of centralization, but I think it's ultimately worth it.
00:38:57.240 - 00:39:26.594, Speaker A: Do I think this bill is like a good bill? No. Do I think this bill is going to stay in its current form? No. Do I think this bill is going to pass? Probably not. And so you have to keep that all in context, but this is where this is going. It's not going to be this bill, but it's probably going to be a bill after that with some slight language tweaks the industry has some feedback on it. We get to kind of coalesce on one thing. Maybe it's not a ban, maybe it's like a moratorium on some aspects of it.
00:39:26.594 - 00:39:56.730, Speaker A: But I don't know. I see the problems that it creates. Like things like MakerDAO and the CDPs that could potentially be illegal are obviously not great, but a lot of the stable coins went to zero and I think we kind of need to collectively just be okay with a little bit of regulation to kind of push the industry meaningfully forward. The nihilism stuff is just not going to be enough to push it forward, frankly. We just need a different look as an industry.
00:39:57.550 - 00:40:03.166, Speaker B: That's just aggressively reasonable of you. Vance goddamn spicy takes, man.
00:40:03.188 - 00:40:43.610, Speaker A: It's so I mean, I feel like it's spicy take to people who I generally talk to who are, know, non developers in some random Eastern European country that are trying to do interesting things and push the limits. But ultimately, I don't think those people are a very important part of the kind of, like, rebel alliance that we have going on. We're the good guys, I would say, but I don't think that's our core constituent set, right? We only have 60,000 daily active addresses on NFC. We should be broadening the tent, not trying to make it more strange and more exclusive.
00:40:43.950 - 00:40:48.380, Speaker B: I feel like what we should be doing is just yelling at each other on Twitter. That feels like the productive thing.
00:40:48.750 - 00:40:50.060, Speaker C: We already do that.
00:40:53.150 - 00:41:44.846, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you. I guess my initial take on this was I agree that some amount of regulation is just going to happen whether we like it or not, so we might as well make ourselves part of the conversation. I view it as a little bit as well of kind of an own goal on the US. If the bill passes in the way that it's currently looks like it's going to pass, like, come on. At a point where the dollar is at least being challenged, right? It's kind of a non consensus view, but it looks like it's at the end of its unquestioned supremacy. You basically get this enormous gift just dumped right in your lap, which is an entirely new technology, financial infrastructure, and probably the new big next new big tech sector wants to adopt your thing for no additional cost. All you got to do is not take it out behind the barn and shoot it in the face.
00:41:44.846 - 00:41:51.070, Speaker B: And they're like, back of the barn is nice. This type of year. Might have to go back behind the barn.
00:41:54.230 - 00:42:24.758, Speaker C: I don't know if I necessarily agree with that. I agree with what you're saying generally about the dollarization and the fact that we have the ability to basically export the dollar at Internet speed. What I do think is happening, though, is what the most used stablecoin right now? USDC. Yeah, we already have this. And if there is a bill in this form or some other, who do you think is going to be one of the biggest benefactors of said bill? Circle.
00:42:24.854 - 00:42:25.610, Speaker B: Circle.
00:42:27.470 - 00:42:52.500, Speaker C: Exactly. They're going to be able to do whatever they need to do to make sure that USDC stays safe. I think it's the algorithmic stable coins. It's the 19 year old developers in their parents basement who are working on something interesting. They're going to be the ones that get hit. But I think is this good or is this bad? It's good for the US. Because we're still going to be able to dollarize things.
00:42:52.500 - 00:43:19.690, Speaker C: It's probably good for consumers because they're not going to be able to put money into something that's called literally a stable coin and should maintain stable value and see it go to zero the next week. So I think ultimately some regulation will be good. But yeah, to Vance's point, this thing isn't going to go anywhere. We're two months out from an election and we'll see what happens then. But you're going to have to have both the Senate in the House to be able to get anything passed.
00:43:21.230 - 00:43:42.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree with that. We should also give a special shout out and appreciation to the two organizations that advocate for Know on Capitol Hill, which is Coincenter and Blockchain Association. I feel like every single time there's a bill, I see a thread from Jake Trevinsky and he's like, guys, nobody freak out. We're working on this. And everyone just loses at him in the comments.
00:43:42.286 - 00:43:42.514, Speaker A: Like.
00:43:42.552 - 00:44:20.426, Speaker B: Thank you, Jake. We appreciate the work that you do. Man yes, thank you. Here's a question. Maybe on one hand you've got very fiat backed, heavily collateralized regulated stablecoins like USDC, and then you've got completely uncollateralized algo stablecoins. But there's this emerging kind of gray space in the middle, like maker kind of sits firmly in between those two camps. But then there are also where does this leave something like Go ave stablecoin? Let me start and say, I don't know if you have any special knowledge that I might not about crypto collateralized stablecoins and how that's going to be treated, but maybe even from non regulatory standpoint.
00:44:20.426 - 00:44:31.970, Speaker B: What do you guys think about these, like, curve issuing a stablecoin? Aave issuing a stablecoin? What's your view on those sorts of projects?
00:44:32.630 - 00:45:23.854, Speaker A: Lowers the cost of capital if you're a bar line market. Ups your regulatory risk, ups your visibility on regulators radars. And so there's trade offs. I think generally the trade off that we think is like they're making a short term lower cost of capital, better chance of getting traction trade off for a longer term regulatory risk trade off because it's not clear what the prognosis for stable coins is going to be. And so I think it's kind of also a symptom of the bear market where guess what? Your bar lend platform isn't doing a lot of volume in the bear market. So strap on a stablecoin, strap on the swap mechanism. These are the things that you kind of see people just start throwing spaghetti at the wall during these markets just trying to increase their tam.
00:45:23.854 - 00:46:08.930, Speaker A: So not surprised that they're doing it either. But we're kind of like fragmenting into regulated phi or Finsen fi I saw today. I thought that was kind of funny and also kind of like everything else. And it's not necessarily unregulated DeFi. It's just like DeFi that's international that utilizes the self custodial and no middleman model to have distribution and that playbook is going to work for a number of projects. It just probably won't be the largest outcome. If you want to create a trillion dollars of value, you need to be welcomed into the regulatory apparatus, and it can be on your own terms, but that's how east, in our opinion, is going to be one of the larger assets.
00:46:08.930 - 00:46:29.130, Speaker A: It's grandfathered in a number of ways into the current regulatory environment, and it's made the inroads, and it's made the explanations, and it's had the conversations with people about like, okay, there's not going to be an ETH stablecoin. It's like, this is the network. This is how it exists. Here it is. And so, yeah, it's just going to be a bunch of different approaches.
00:46:30.270 - 00:47:19.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I might have told the story on here, I can't remember, but our analysts are pretty excited about some of these projects, like Go and the Curve stable. And there was a very smart guy, but maybe he's a little bit of a critic of crypto listening in on the chat, and he DM'd me on the Twitter spaces, and he was like, do you realize your analysts are just describing private banknotes? And of course, I was like, oh, yeah. And then I went and looked up what he was talking about. And actually, if you go back to the wildcat era of banking in the US. That's basically what this is, right? Each bank had their own currency that was collateralized by the assets in that bank. You could argue everything was regulated on very state by state basis at that period of time. So maybe that's why it didn't work.
00:47:19.574 - 00:47:41.600, Speaker B: But it didn't really work. So I get a little nervous when we talk about every project issuing their own stablecoin, and maybe there's some element of empire building here too, which is like the core business isn't really working. I've got all these assets in the treasury, which, by the way, I didn't convert to USDC before that bear market. Whoops. And now I got to do something with it. So maybe there's some element of that as well.
00:47:42.610 - 00:48:11.900, Speaker C: You get to team make if you have your own currency, right? And that's what it comes down to. If everybody's transacting with something that you created, that is a massive advantage, and that's literally the advantage of the United States over every other country in the world right now. But if you think about it, if you're trying to create your know, and it's Curb or it's Aave or it's any of these know, that becomes a huge advantage for your core business, but also just your brand, your recognition, everything.
00:48:12.670 - 00:48:51.398, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just not sure if this matters if great. You issued a stablecoin, your own stablecoin. Now everyone's gaming it's like, does this matter? Or are you kind of like there's this saying that sometimes you accidentally fight the last war instead of the war that you're supposed to be fighting. It's like people showing up with horses to World War I. When there's tanks on the field it's like oh shit, we misjudge this. I think that's kind of like where this might be going. It's like, congratulations, you have this Algo stable fund.
00:48:51.398 - 00:49:01.340, Speaker A: It's integrated into approximately zero games because that's just not what consumers want and we just need to build for a broader consumer constituency. I think that's where we're going.
00:49:02.430 - 00:49:07.770, Speaker B: It's not funny at all, but can you imagine being the side that shows up in horses and the other side of the tank?
00:49:08.590 - 00:49:09.514, Speaker A: Not good at all.
00:49:09.552 - 00:49:13.680, Speaker B: I have made a grave miscalculation. This is a very bad idea.
00:49:14.770 - 00:49:22.320, Speaker A: In the last war, the cavalry was the best regiment. And this one, it's like oh, God.
00:49:22.850 - 00:50:28.694, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, these things aren't funny, but it's like that is what the Bloodiest Wars are when there's like this big advancing in technology and one side gets it and the other one yeah, I've got a bit of a random topic, but I actually love Vince. I saw you tweeting about this, let's call it exploit on AVAX, but basically it's just a very smart kind of move that one trader made extracting a whole bunch of value by trading on GMX actually. But it was Avalanche that was traded. So the model that GMX employs is an Oracle based model with zero slippage, right? So doesn't matter how big the trade that you take out is, it's not going to impact the price. So they took out this enormous position at zero slippage, then they went around to other exchanges and actually moved the price and essentially extracted an Arbitrage, right? And you can actually look at the price of AVAX over this really short period of time, 2 hours or something like that. It looks like these alligator jaws and Josh Lim wrote a great thread on this and maybe they extracted somewhere around 750K or something like that.
00:50:28.694 - 00:50:53.950, Speaker B: Maybe minus whatever they're paying to market makers on centralized exchanges. But I was kind of looking at that being like it's a really smart move that this trader did. But then if the Oracle based model is just pulling from other price feeds that rely on centralized exchanges, then is that bad for GMX moving forward or what's your thoughts on Oracle based pricing?
00:50:54.770 - 00:51:26.822, Speaker A: Yes, bad. Also probably illegal to do this. So I don't think this is like good trade. It's like the mechanics of the trade are pretty simple. So basically on one side you have this thing that's know here's the price on a centralized exchange, but we're only going to update that price for every significant movement or every 5 minutes. And Oracle latency is a key part of this. And Oracles just don't update very quickly.
00:51:26.822 - 00:52:14.662, Speaker A: So you get a stale price, you get an old price, whatever. On the other side you have markets and increasingly illiquid markets in the bear market where you basically take out a bunch of size on, I'll guarantee you this price leg. And then you manipulate the Oracle. On the other leg. And there's a spread that you can capture where, like, okay, I moved the price up 10% on the centralized exchange, and I got all of my fill on the one price that was quoted. And this isn't just something that happens with Oracles, by the way. This is something that also happens with market makers, where if they don't know that you have a shit ton of tokens, or if you're trying to buy a shit ton of tokens, they'll quote you a price that it looks like as if you were going to buy only a little bit.
00:52:14.662 - 00:53:05.160, Speaker A: But if you run them over, that's when the market makers lose money. And so the concept kind of applies not only in DeFi, it happens in centralized crypto as well. I think Michael and I have both personally lived through this with Synthetix back in the day with the create one exploit, with the maker exploit, which is basically identical to this AVAX exploit. And the things that Synthetix has done to prevent this is reduce the Oracle latency and quote wider spreads in times of higher volatility. And they've basically solved this issue and they don't have a ton of toxic flow anymore. The larger risk of this is everything is basically more liquid by a factor of like three to five at the moment than it was like six months ago. And so you can do this on like, AVAX is like a top, what, 30, 40 coin? Can you do this with a top 20 coin? How real these prices in general? That's kind of where my thinking goes.
00:53:05.160 - 00:53:12.780, Speaker A: And so, yeah, it's a dangerous time to run like a GMX style project because your LPs are just going to get hit.
00:53:15.870 - 00:53:20.726, Speaker B: Just elaborate exactly how do LPs, how are they the losers in this transaction?
00:53:20.838 - 00:53:59.320, Speaker A: So, I mean, LPs are the counterparties to these trades, right? And so in the synthetics model, you're actually staking the native synthetics token. And if somebody loses money, you make money as a staker and vice versa. The GMX model I'm not as familiar with, but it has basically all the similarities to the synthetics model. I'm not sure if it's collateralized by GMX or stables or by the underlying asset itself. Actually, it would have to be probably GMX or stables just because AVAX doesn't exist on ETH. And so their LPs are getting hit one way or the other. Whether it's collateralized the token or stables or whatever, it just is the Oracle model that's the core problem.
00:53:59.320 - 00:54:14.078, Speaker A: And this doesn't just go away. I remember Michael and I dealing with the synthetics and shit back in the day and just being like, we just wish they would stop. Maybe if we blacklist that address, they'll stop and we'll start a new address, they'll start a new pair. It's just like just this Whack a.
00:54:14.084 - 00:54:42.886, Speaker C: Mole game that you so I think it's. The oracle model. But really what the Oracle model means is it's infinite slippage for zero cost. That's the issue. You have to have a slippage based model where if you're trading transacting in size, you have some additional price impact. And when you have an Oracle based model, you have to add that in after the fact. Because inherently, if you have an Oracle model, you're just able to transact at whatever the price is.
00:54:42.886 - 00:54:51.510, Speaker C: You can buy sell at $3, and it's going to be $3 even if you're buying $10 worth or a million dollars worth. But you have to have some slippage based pricing.
00:54:52.090 - 00:55:03.750, Speaker B: Yeah, well, tough day for I don't know if you've heard anything from the GMX team. Do you think they're kind of looking at this being like, oh shit, or I mean, I haven't I haven't really heard much communication.
00:55:03.830 - 00:55:24.610, Speaker A: This is when it gets like, I don't know what's going to happen to GMX, but I remember when this was happening to synthetics, it was like the most concerning thing ever. Because you can't stop the protocol. You can't blacklist it's like, oh, it's happening again. Oh, no. All right, shut that asset market down. Oh, no, they're doing it somewhere else. Okay, shut that one down.
00:55:24.610 - 00:55:43.370, Speaker A: And then towards the end of it, I think remember the front running saga with synthetics, Michael? I think Kane eventually reimbursed people with SNX tokens or something. It got to be very crazy. And it only stopped when we switched to a new model. So this is not something that just goes away concerning.
00:55:43.950 - 00:56:02.638, Speaker B: Speaking of things that are concerning, that segue is better than the one tried last week. Never going to do that again. Got scarred by that. There was a hack at Winter mute. So Winter Mute got hacked for $160,000,000. It was a brute force vulnerability in their vanity. It's a custom address.
00:56:02.638 - 00:56:19.338, Speaker B: It is actually a vanity address. But evgeny tweeted out. He's like, the reason they were doing this, using these addresses was not for vanity. It wasn't to do something cool. There's less zeros basically on the address, which means that they were saving in terms of a gas cost. But basically wintermute. And props to Evuine.
00:56:19.338 - 00:56:51.102, Speaker B: Props to that entire team. They're one of the largest, most sophisticated market makers in, I think, all of Crypto, certainly all of DFI. So really great team. Sucks to see that they had this exploit happen to them. But basically they lost $160,000,000 due to this. They were using something called Profanity, which is it generates vanity addresses. And one inch actually flagged that there was a potential exploit there where you could basically brute force and get your way into that in the span of 50 days.
00:56:51.102 - 00:57:17.698, Speaker B: And it seems like there was just a human error right on their side where they actually were aware of this vulnerability, but they thought that they had blocked it. But they didn't. And they ended up losing $160,000,000. Some of which has found its way into a curve pool. I think Winter Mute and the team, or Evgeny and the team at Winter Mute, they said that we are open to this being a white hack offering. Right. You can keep 10% as a bounty.
00:57:17.698 - 00:57:47.550, Speaker B: So basically return everything except for 16 million USDC, which I think would be an optimal outcome. I'm not sure if there's really a takeaway here other than just it's kind of a mark of how immature things are. If you have teams as sophisticated as Winter Mute still suffering these hacks just to not they are completely solvent and it seems like there is absolutely no worries on that front. Maple has come out in a support. They still are well capitalized. So it's not like these are any contagion concerns. It's more of just a sucks.
00:57:48.130 - 00:58:29.022, Speaker A: Feel badly for them. Yeah, that's when people, you know, just get hacked for a lot of money and you wake up and you're like should I just send them like a telegram message? Being like, sorry, it just sucks. Yeah, they're so sophisticated. But I think when it's it always happens on the margins, right. You're the most sophisticated firm and you have all the best security practices but you're using this one tool to do this one specific thing that opens you up to this one specific vector and maybe there's a 0.1% chance that someone finds it. But in crypto that's actually like a 50% chance and so yeah, it just sucks and hope they find the money back and it finds their way to them.
00:58:29.022 - 00:58:55.880, Speaker A: But yeah, it's also like the most seasoned solidity hackers that are doing this and so part of me wonders how many really seasoned solidity hackers do we not know of? Some of it feels like very close to the industry. Like an inside job almost. Not like from Winter Mute, but who knows how to write that level of sophistication of solidity code? Probably not that many people.
00:58:57.770 - 00:59:27.522, Speaker C: Yeah, no differentiated tapes on my end either. But yeah, it just really sucks and I think that the one takeaway is just the need that we have for better security. And I don't know if this means more custodial experiences, more fireblocks type experiences where it's sort of a hybrid, but you just can't have this much money sitting around in these ecosystems without the level of security that you would expect to be able to protect it.
00:59:27.656 - 00:59:31.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Have you guys ever heard of a firm called Night Capital?
00:59:31.670 - 00:59:32.420, Speaker A: Yes.
00:59:35.350 - 01:00:12.000, Speaker B: Night Capital is one of the craziest and my just heart goes out to every I don't know if these are like good people, but they were a large, very well established, super well capitalized, very sophisticated, basically high frequency trading firm back in 2012 and they essentially vanished in the span of one day. They had this algorithm that was running, something was wrong with it and they vaporized over $400 million worth of capital basically in the span of hours, it was like $10 million per minute. And they figured it out, but it was too late, and the firm went bankrupt. Can you imagine that? Just one day?
01:00:12.370 - 01:00:13.050, Speaker C: Brutal.
01:00:13.130 - 01:00:19.266, Speaker B: Brutal. Yeah. Not that that's going to happen, but even 160,000,000 is like, dude, that's not.
01:00:19.288 - 01:00:20.354, Speaker A: A small amount of money.
01:00:20.472 - 01:00:21.140, Speaker B: No.
01:00:21.750 - 01:00:28.360, Speaker A: And to have your algo misfire and you lose 400, $500 million, that's, like, obviously not good either.
01:00:30.090 - 01:00:31.080, Speaker B: Down bad.
01:00:34.570 - 01:01:30.520, Speaker C: One of the things that we used to do at Dropbox when I was there was you go code golfing, which is what? Small change could wreck the most possible havoc in the entire ecosystem. And you would go off and you'd literally find these bugs and you'd mark them and all this other stuff. But literally, one of the bugs, the ultimate winner of whoever won golfing, found out that there was a plus sign or there was a greater than. And if you changed it to a less than, it would say basically delete all data within Dropbox prior to this date as opposed to after this date. These types of things exist in very, very sophisticated organizations. And literally one character change from a greater than to a less than would be the end of, at this point, a multi billion dollar company.
01:01:31.690 - 01:01:51.806, Speaker B: There's another story like that. There's a book that was written about Jim Simons, the founder at Shoot. I'm blanking on the the. It's like the most successful yeah. Rentech. And they started off basically it was really long, really interesting. I mean, first of all, this guy is basically a mathematical genius, like, very well regarded in the math community.
01:01:51.806 - 01:02:14.600, Speaker B: And he took a very long, slow start to basically the approach that they would end up doing. And they basically had their algos perfected for commodities. That's what they started with. And they were trying to crack equities, and that was a really difficult problem for them. And they brought over this guy from IBM who's the crazy kind of right wing guy who's like the biggest donor. Yeah, you know him.
01:02:15.370 - 01:02:16.902, Speaker A: I know who you're talking about.
01:02:17.036 - 01:02:32.186, Speaker B: I'm going to blank on his name. But apparently this guy is wickedly smart. And they're developing this model, and for years they couldn't crack it. Couldn't crack it. Everyone's like, Jim, buddy, it's just not possible with equities. You got to give up on this. And this guy's going through the lines of code.
01:02:32.186 - 01:02:55.346, Speaker B: Apparently, it was just one letter in the line of code. That was the mistake. It was just a typo for why the whole model wasn't working. And then they basically fixed it and turned on the greatest money making algorithm of all time. So just these crazy, like, sliding glass door moments in history. It could have gone so differently. Who knows? I've got one more.
01:02:55.346 - 01:03:36.958, Speaker B: This isn't really a bit of news, but I wanted to get your guys take on this. I dropped it in the chat. I'm not sure if you guys had a chance to read it, but Vitalik published something basically on how DAOs should be governed in principles for Dao governance, which I thought was interesting. And it kind of ties actually back into what we were talking about with Stablecoins. But basically he was writing, to paraphrase what he was writing, he was writing this blog post in response to another blog post that was written that Dows should basically borrow lessons from corporate governance in terms of running DAOs. That was what he was kind of writing this in response to. And he made the distinction that Dao governance is better in three different types of situations.
01:03:36.958 - 01:04:13.882, Speaker B: So convex versus concave decision making, the decentralization for censorship resistance, and decentralization as credible fairness. So to summarize, convex decision is basically a situation where it's kind of binary. Like you'd rather go in and flip a coin and whichever coin flip ends up being the better thing. So military strategy, right? You can either do a guerrilla pincer attack or you can kind of go full force. And that's better committing to one of those two things than trying to split the difference and do both because then you'll lose. A concave decision is something where you almost do want to split the difference. So a judicial decision.
01:04:13.882 - 01:05:00.346, Speaker B: So say you, Michael, are accused of a crime that this Michael committed, but you go to a court, right? And it's like life in prison. Would you want to split the difference and say, hey, 50 50, I'll just take a 50% shot of that? Or would you split the difference and do something more fair? So that's Convex versus concave decision. He makes the argument concave decision is better for Dows. And then there's this. The other two are like basically credible neutrality or credible fairness and then also censorship resistance. So a company doesn't have to be censorship resistant in the same way that a base layer institution kind of like money does. And then also same thing for a sovereign organization versus a corporate organization where in a corporate organization, efficiency is really what you want.
01:05:00.346 - 01:05:21.138, Speaker B: We're trying to generate a return on capital. Sovereigns have kind of a different thing. They have to run the country in a way that seems fair to everyone. Otherwise people won't buy into the system. I don't know. I guess it really does depend on what your definition of a Dow ultimately is. I've never just asked you guys that.
01:05:21.138 - 01:05:30.920, Speaker B: How do you guys think about Dows in general? How are they different from companies? How should they behave similarly to companies? What's the value proposition of what these things are in your mind?
01:05:31.690 - 01:06:08.802, Speaker A: Dows, to me at least, are more of like a Board of directors concept than like a management concept. I just don't think we've seen many people do the Dows as management team school of thought really well. And maybe there's tools that need to be developed and maybe we'll get there. I certainly hold out hope for that. But right now it seems to function better as how I conceptualize. Dows are. Like, you have this big pot of capital and you have people who vote on it, people who manage it, but the Dow's job is to basically act as a board of directors and allocate capital to things.
01:06:08.802 - 01:06:52.094, Speaker A: And I kind of like the subdow model as a result, where it's like, here's a big pool of capital marketing. Okay, we're sending $10 million to that. Like, if you're the Uniswap Grants Foundation, okay, we're going to send $20 million to the Policy Initiative, the DFI Education Fund, and then the people in those subdows or corporations that are receiving it, it doesn't need to be a subdow, can also be a corporation. It's just like receiving grants go off and execute whatever your functional slayer is. And I think that's how I kind of conceptualize it. And it's also worth noting that Ethereum doesn't have a Dow. Ethereum is governed in a pretty informal way, and it probably has done the best job of achieving long term results so far.
01:06:52.094 - 01:07:33.040, Speaker A: And I think that's pretty indicative as to kind of how these things actually work. There's also kind of like this concept with Dows where at the beginning, most token projects are extremely closely held. And so there isn't really a difference between centralized and decentralized making decision making authority in a de facto sense. And so there is a little bit of a gray area on that side. The last part I think, is just like, okay, you have a Dow, you have a token. Does your Dow actually need a token? Does your project actually need a token? We're definitely kind of like going to the bear Market Arc where bear market arc where it's like, maybe you don't need a token, whatever. But I think that's like a valid question.
01:07:33.040 - 01:07:51.314, Speaker A: Does your game need a decentralized governance token? Maybe not. Does your chain need that if you have your own chain? Probably. And so there's different kind of permutations of having tokens, of having app chains, of having Dows that we just haven't explored yet that I think we're going.
01:07:51.352 - 01:08:39.874, Speaker C: To yeah, obviously I think we share a lot of the same perspective on Dows. I think it's definitely a board of directors in terms of resource allocation, but I think it's more of like a co op in terms of actual work product and how people are organizing themselves. And that is just inherently less efficient than a corporation. And it will always be just like it'll always be less efficient to have a decentralized distributed network versus a centrally maintained network. You're never going to have resource allocation that's better in both instances. And so I think generally you have to think of what's the core advantage? The core advantage is flexibility. You have the ability to work for five different Dows if you want to.
01:08:39.874 - 01:09:23.680, Speaker C: If you're an artist and you're like, I kind of want to create some interesting artwork and I want to put that together into a bunch of different games. Well, you can work on five different game worlds all at the same time by working for five different you know, that's not something that necessarily really easily exists or is dominantly existing in the work world, at least in the United States today. You work for a company and you're gainfully employed by that company, and that company is your company, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the flexibility of work actually is an interesting concept, but as we dip further into the bear market, to Vance's point, it just becomes less and less activated as the thing that people want to do.
01:09:24.930 - 01:10:07.086, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm with you. Think. I do think you could probably make a pretty credible argument that Ethereum and Bitcoin are kind of two of the cleanest definition of Dows, right? It's really decentralized governance and architecture there. And the reason I'm flagging this is because it's just something I've been thinking a lot about and I think to your point about maybe some folks that you talk to that aren't as pro regulation for stable coins. Everyone should listen to an interview that Rune gave on this podcast called I Pledge Allegiance. And if you kind of hear he's a really smart guy and built something incredible with Maker. But if you listen to his worldview and his conception of what Maker is, some stuff starts to click and fall into place for me.
01:10:07.086 - 01:10:37.366, Speaker B: And I think it aligns with Vitalik's view here, frankly, because I kind of am on the stage of young in my career. I want to contribute to Dows, but I want these things work. I want to create products here, but I think there's a very different perception out there, which is, to paraphrase Rune, climate change is coming, western democracies will fall. We need to create something that will last beyond that. I'm kind of like I don't know. I don't know if we're going to do that. We should probably try to worry about it then.
01:10:37.366 - 01:10:47.062, Speaker B: But I don't know. I think those are like the two. But these are powerful positions, right? These are opinions that people have in very senior places in crypto.
01:10:47.206 - 01:11:00.240, Speaker A: You'd probably feel similarly if you lived in, you know, it's kind of like a matter of your context and maybe Europe is a foreshadowing of what's to come for the US. But hopefully not.
01:11:00.770 - 01:11:07.250, Speaker B: Yeah, we got 5 minutes left. You guys want to do Meme of the week? I've got a meme.
01:11:09.190 - 01:11:11.380, Speaker A: Let's see. I had a good one.
01:11:11.830 - 01:11:13.326, Speaker C: I've got a meme.
01:11:13.518 - 01:11:21.400, Speaker B: All right, Michael, it's yours. I think I know what it is. Do you? I think I do.
01:11:25.050 - 01:11:26.840, Speaker C: I don't know if I can pull it up.
01:11:27.850 - 01:11:32.586, Speaker B: Do you see the ability to share your screen? There's like a little thing at the bottom with a well, I think if.
01:11:32.608 - 01:11:42.638, Speaker C: I describe it everyone the foreshadowing that Vitalik told everybody with the meme from.
01:11:42.644 - 01:11:52.990, Speaker B: A few weeks ago, his down only point, his body language was telling us something that we weren't ready to hear.
01:11:53.140 - 01:11:54.818, Speaker C: It was so obvious at the time.
01:11:54.904 - 01:12:00.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I retweeted this one too, but this is how I felt yesterday.
01:12:01.270 - 01:12:01.694, Speaker C: Fuck.
01:12:01.742 - 01:12:09.298, Speaker A: Why am I watching Bloomberg? Why am I up to watch the Fed speed where we don't have this?
01:12:09.384 - 01:12:10.854, Speaker C: And I don't even think we do.
01:12:10.892 - 01:12:21.660, Speaker A: Have to do this. It's just more of like it's become so cultural that you can't even really avoid it at this point. Like, even the Uber drivers and the random guys at the gym are like, do you see the Fed hiked 75 today?
01:12:26.990 - 01:12:45.806, Speaker B: That's super funny. What about Adam Levine sex? Like, he's a 17 year old. Have you seen that? Adam Levine. Meme. Oh, God. I'm not going to come down bad man, Adam. I'm not going to make a value judgment here.
01:12:45.806 - 01:13:07.750, Speaker B: All I'm saying is that if anyone's, like, intimate text got blown up on the national stage, woof. That is just a tough position to be in. But all right, guys, I think we can end it there. This has been a fun one. I think maybe the strongest one we've ever done. It's almost like we lost some dead weight in the roundup here. Addiction.
01:13:07.750 - 01:13:16.070, Speaker B: We're really happy for you, budy. Enjoy your last few hours of freedom, guys. We hope you hear us same time next week. Cheers.
01:13:16.490 - 01:13:16.930, Speaker C: See ya.
