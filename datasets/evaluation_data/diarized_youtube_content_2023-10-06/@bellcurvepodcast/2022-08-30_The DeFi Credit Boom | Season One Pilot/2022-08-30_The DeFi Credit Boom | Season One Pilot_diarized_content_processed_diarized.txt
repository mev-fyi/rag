00:00:05.210 - 00:00:27.782, Speaker A: All right, new season, new show, episode zero, baby. What's up, everyone? We are here. It is bell curve, the show where Mike and I explore the most important themes in crypto for folks that just like Mike and me, are confined to the middle of the bell curve. This is a two part show. It's broken down into seasons. Each season we are going to explore a different thesis. So here's what's going to happen.
00:00:27.782 - 00:01:04.910, Speaker A: We're going to lay out the thesis for you at the beginning of the season, explore that thesis over the next seven episodes and then regroup at the end of the season to say what went right and then what went wrong. So that's one episode per week. The other episode per week is a roundup with the folks over at framework ventures, vance and Michael. They are some of a, the smartest people in the space, but b, some of our favorite people in the space. This is like the ultimate roundup for the dgens out there. We're going to cover market conditions, break down governance proposals, obviously cover the biggest stories of the week. A few more fun things you'll have to tune in for.
00:01:04.910 - 00:01:10.702, Speaker A: Mike, maybe I can kick it over to you. Can you just tell us about what is the thesis of season one?
00:01:10.836 - 00:01:15.522, Speaker B: Well, first let me just say thank you for turning it over to me. I didn't know if I was going to get a word in edge wise.
00:01:15.666 - 00:01:22.178, Speaker A: I was considering just taking it the whole way through. I mean, you wrote up these nice notes for me. You put it on a silver platter.
00:01:22.354 - 00:01:26.946, Speaker B: You like the sound of your own voice. I mean, who among us doesn't? I thought this was an excuse. I thought this was an excuse.
00:01:27.058 - 00:01:29.750, Speaker A: Twelve more minutes. Watch him go, guys. Watch him go.
00:01:29.820 - 00:01:43.130, Speaker B: I know. So it could be bad. Now I'm just going to not shut up for the rest of this episode, but I'll do my best. Now, elevator pitch like lay out the thesis of the season. So we're talking about the DeFi credit boom. That's the thesis of season one. And that thesis comes in three parts.
00:01:43.130 - 00:02:14.390, Speaker B: So part number one, we just watched the implosion of CFI. That's going to push marginal activity out of CFI and into DeFi. Part two, what we're looking for in DeFi, that marginal opportunity is going to attract a bunch of investor interest, renewed products. And what we're going to see is an unlock in the form of variable to fixed lending. That fixed lending is going to unlock a whole bunch of new structured products that weren't possible before, and it's going to usher in a part of a boom that's going to help catalyze the next bull cycle. So that's our thesis.
00:02:15.610 - 00:02:17.974, Speaker A: Damn. I think you did talk less than me there.
00:02:18.012 - 00:02:19.080, Speaker B: I think I did.
00:02:19.850 - 00:02:21.190, Speaker A: 60 seconds.
00:02:21.610 - 00:02:26.986, Speaker B: I would have gone for at least five minutes, but I had to show you up so good way of getting me to slow down.
00:02:27.088 - 00:02:56.046, Speaker A: That's fair. This is really an exercise in curiosity for Mike and me. What happens basically over the last four years since launching Blockworks is like, Michael called me at 10:00 P.m. On a Tuesday night saying, I think this big thing is going to happen in like six months, right? So back in 2018, it was Prime Brokerage. I remember getting a call, being like, PV is going to be a big thing in the next six to twelve months. And sure enough, in 2019, prime brokerage takes the space by storm. And then 2019 calls, a bunch of calls like DFI.
00:02:56.046 - 00:03:12.946, Speaker A: I think this DFI thing might actually be real. Sure enough, six months later, DFI summer happens, right? And I think we've seen this play out a lot. Just our conversations end up actually happening, and sometimes they really don't happen. Sometimes we're wildly wrong. But this show is just an exercise in curiosity.
00:03:13.058 - 00:03:46.814, Speaker B: Yeah, let me break it down a little bit more, just so we can because the point of this episode is, right, I think you and I are both kind of sick of as well, like, listening to people, they just kind of spout these predictions on Twitter. They might or might not get revisited, and there's not really much accountability. I think it's more fun to learn in public. So we're kind of going out on a little bit of a limb on this one here. But I think we've got conviction in it and if know, we'll figure out what we got wrong. But basically, I think you and I think that there's going to be a big unlock when it comes to fixed lending in crypto. Right? So the first part of this thesis, we just watched an epic implosion when it comes to CFI.
00:03:46.814 - 00:04:20.910, Speaker B: So some of that was just irresponsibility or not really good risk management on the part of CFI lenders. Some of it was much worse stuff, right? Something that looks like it was bordering on fraud. In the case of Celsius or honestly, Babel Finance, this didn't get a whole lot of play. But $280,000,000 worth of customer deposits that got vaporized because they were prop trading customer funds, you do not get activity like that and don't get an enormous amount of regulation after that. Right? So we saw it Forbes August 4 reported every single US based exchanges under investigation by the SEC. So that's about to get regulated. CFI is about to start looking like banks.
00:04:20.910 - 00:04:52.998, Speaker B: That'll be good for some. You might actually see more institutions come in if they get regulated more heavily, but it's going to push some marginal activity out into DeFi. There's going to be renewed interest, more funding. And the one thing that we haven't really seen in DeFi thus far is a robust market for different credit products. And I think one of the reasons for that is basically the only thing that exists in crypto is the ability to borrow at a variable rate of interest. That sucks for you and me, right? If we're blockworks, we're trying to raise money tap these debt markets. We can't borrow at 2% today and have it spike to 20% tomorrow.
00:04:52.998 - 00:05:21.220, Speaker B: So there are folks, and you'll hear from them this season that are already working on how to solve this, right? Transforming that variable interest rate into something that looks fixed on top of the fixed rate. You build these structured products, right? Like a 30 year mortgage, which is the most popular financial product in the United States that's built on the ability to borrow at a fixed rate. So you're going to see all of that kind of happen during this next cycle and that's what's going to boom, kick everything off. That's what we think at least. Thank you.
00:05:23.110 - 00:05:58.186, Speaker A: Let me recap. The idea of season one is that the birth of fixed rate borrow and lend in crypto is eventually maybe relatively soon going to kick off a credit boom. And this credit boom is going to catalyze the next bull cycle. The thesis is kind of broken down into three parts, right? So the first part is that the recent implosion of CFI, Celsius and Babel and BlockFi will push more financial activity into DeFi. That's part number one. Part number two, the next wave of DeFi products will be unlocked by fixed rate lending, right. Everything in crypto right now in DeFi is variable.
00:05:58.186 - 00:06:13.826, Speaker A: We think that where the space goes is fixed rate lending. And then the third is that you need structured products that utilize fixed rate lending and that those structured products based on fixed lending will be a key part of the next boom. Do you want to break that third part down a little more?
00:06:14.008 - 00:06:30.200, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically, if you take a look at something like a 30 year mortgage, that is a beast that you don't quote, like find in the wild, right? Really what that is, is there are variable rates of interest and there's a deep and liquid options market that's used to lock in fixed rates that then get sold to customers.
00:06:31.690 - 00:06:34.226, Speaker A: Slow down over there, budy. Slow down. Getting a little excited.
00:06:34.258 - 00:07:03.850, Speaker B: Christ Almighty. All right, we're editing this part out. I'm just so excited by the creation of these markets. So what you really need that's based on this, like it's what we talk about in DeFi all the time, right? There are building blocks, right? So ability number one, the ability to borrow and lend at a fixed rate. And then you need a specific product that leverages that ability. So I think one of the big things that we need to explore, and frankly, it's going to be tough to get answers on, is we don't really know what those product looked like in DFI. We don't know what our equivalent is going to be of a 30 year fixed mortgage.
00:07:03.850 - 00:07:56.098, Speaker B: But what we do know is that we're going to need businesses maybe in the form of Dows, we're going to need consumers, something like that to be on the demand side, the demand side for those financial services. And then we're also going to need on the back end we're going to need a deep liquid market for options perps whatever it is that's kind of like you can think of that almost as the clay, right? The molding clay for these new products. Because when you have a 30 year fixed mortgage you need someone, a market full of people that want to basically take leveraged bets on interest rates to support the creation of those new products to just lay it out. That's our thesis and I'm sure like you said in the beginning, the point of this outlining this is one to just say hey this is what we thought at the beginning of all these interviews. And two, I'm hopeful. I would bet that by the end of season, one we're going to think very differently about some stuff that we just hadn't thought about before. So we want to put our ideas out there, be wrong in public and who knows, maybe we'll even be right about some stuff.
00:07:56.184 - 00:08:27.946, Speaker A: Yeah potentially it's rare that we're right but we'll see. Yeah I think it'll be interesting right. If you look at all of the basically bubbles and cycles in crypto they've been led by equity financing, right? You had like ICOs, you had IEOs, then you had DeFi summer and yield farming. Then you had NFTs. These are all like variations in iterations of equity financing. But if you look at most bubbles throughout financial history from like CDOs in 2008 to milk and junk bond sales in the late 80s, those were all caused by debt. Those were debt bubbles.
00:08:27.946 - 00:08:43.754, Speaker A: So I think our thesis is that when we finally see a form of debt financing that's unlocked by fixed lending we could see this boom in credit products that catalyzes the next cycle. So I mean, we'll see. We'll see. If you and me are right. I think the goal here like you said is just to lay out thesis. It's not to be right or wrong. It's to lay out thesis.
00:08:43.754 - 00:08:50.870, Speaker A: It's to learn in public. I'd be really surprised if we nailed 100% of it but hopefully we get one or two things right here.
00:08:51.020 - 00:08:57.250, Speaker B: Yeah well I feel like the parts that I think will probably be right and then what you think will probably end up being wrong. But history can decide.
00:08:57.330 - 00:08:59.078, Speaker A: I'd flip that and you're probably right.
00:08:59.244 - 00:09:03.366, Speaker B: Yeah I'd flip your flip and it's the inverse of what you just said. So I think we're both in agreement here.
00:09:03.388 - 00:09:33.902, Speaker A: I'd take a derivative on that flip of the flip and then we'll call it a day. So if you guys want to listen too many here bitcoin show and ETH show a solana, show an avalanche, whatever ideology you like this is not the show for you. This is a show for exploring theses and big ideas. We'll revisit them every single season. We are releasing the first couple of episodes over the next couple of weeks. The first episode, this is episode zero. Episode one is also live today with Vance and Michael.
00:09:33.902 - 00:09:46.034, Speaker A: It is. CFI is dead. Long live DeFi. Next couple episodes that come out every week. The makings of a DeFi credit boom. The fixed rate lending unlock on chain derivatives and options. Uncollateralized lending.
00:09:46.034 - 00:09:59.854, Speaker A: Who are the borrowers? Who borrow off this fixed rate loans and then DeFi in the next bull cycle. Really, really interesting. Seven episodes lined up for y'all. If you're excited, hit that subscribe button. Mike, anything else to add here?
00:10:00.012 - 00:10:04.080, Speaker B: No, I think that's about it. I think I definitely talked less than you so let's just cap it here.
00:10:06.930 - 00:10:08.970, Speaker A: See you on the other side folks. Peace.
