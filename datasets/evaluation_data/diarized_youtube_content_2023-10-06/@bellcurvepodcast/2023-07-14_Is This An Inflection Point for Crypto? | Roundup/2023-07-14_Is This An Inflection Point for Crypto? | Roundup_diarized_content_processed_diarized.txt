Welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve.
00:00:28.786 - 00:00:35.560, Speaker A: You got the roundup, you got myself, Vance and Michael. Number one. No mike number two today. How you guys doing? What up?
00:00:36.090 - 00:00:37.160, Speaker B: How we doing?
00:00:37.690 - 00:00:39.400, Speaker A: Amazing. How you guys?
00:00:39.950 - 00:00:42.902, Speaker C: A quiet day in the crypto ecosystem.
00:00:43.046 - 00:00:44.170, Speaker B: Pretty good day.
00:00:44.320 - 00:00:48.090, Speaker A: We are ripping. Narratives are funny.
00:00:49.230 - 00:00:52.154, Speaker B: Everything sounds better when the prices are higher. Strange.
00:00:52.202 - 00:00:57.486, Speaker A: Yeah, it's good. I was like man loaded product innovations this week. Yeah.
00:00:57.588 - 00:00:59.498, Speaker B: Technology improving rapidly.
00:00:59.594 - 00:01:06.046, Speaker A: Technology improving. Yeah. Yeah. We love, love, we'd love Ripple. Yeah.
00:01:06.068 - 00:01:07.760, Speaker B: I forgot about this case.
00:01:08.230 - 00:01:21.766, Speaker A: I mean, I think this is a good example of these cases take years to play out. It's been going on for years. I don't know how much Ripple spent. It's got to be at least in the tens of millions. I wouldn't be surprised if it was hundreds of millions that they spent on this case. Yeah.
00:01:21.868 - 00:01:34.586, Speaker C: Oh my God, it's coming up on it's two and a half years already. And you know, they've had every single lawyer that they could possibly find working on this. And I think they actually also hired a bunch of people specifically for this.
00:01:34.768 - 00:01:35.402, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:35.536 - 00:01:40.230, Speaker C: For internal counsel. I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the nine figures.
00:01:40.310 - 00:02:23.754, Speaker A: Yeah. So for anyone living under a rock who missed this, basically for the last two and a half, three years, the SEC has had a lawsuit against Ripple claiming that they issued unregistered securities which was XRP, their token. And today a judge, I think it was a federal judge, basically came down and said they issued their statement against this and said that there's kind of two buckets here. They decided that the institutional sales and fundraising side of what Ripple's done with XRP, some of that was securities. However, the big news is that the programmatic sale of XRP on exchanges was not a security. That was my takeaway. There's a lot more details, but you guys read that the same way.
00:02:23.952 - 00:02:36.222, Speaker B: I think that's roughly my conclusions as well. And just to give everyone context, this started what with Jay Clayton leaving, this was like the last thing that he filed. So this is something that's been going on to Michael's point for a long time.
00:02:36.356 - 00:02:37.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:37.490 - 00:02:56.866, Speaker C: The only other variable I'd say is they also defined that granted summary judgment to the defendants. I think that's exactly how it goes for the executives who are selling as well. So Chris Larson, Brad Garlinghouse seem to be fine with their transactions as yeah.
00:02:56.968 - 00:03:23.274, Speaker A: Yeah. So to get in detail a little more so SEC versus Ripple. In brief, Ripple putting XRP on exchanges for trading and funding their operation with those sales is not an investment contract, therefore it's not a security. Ripple paying people an XRP is not an investment contract, therefore not a security. XRP is not a security in and of itself, even when offered through a securities transaction. That was the good news. The other side of this that wasn't making the big headlines was Ripple.
00:03:23.274 - 00:03:40.866, Speaker A: Selling XRP directly pursuant to contracts was an investment contract and therefore a security. And that's like, I think, OTC deals direct from treasury type deals, basically institutional sales deals. So yeah, what do you guys make of this?
00:03:40.968 - 00:04:07.530, Speaker C: Positive. I mean, overall there are a number of different ways that this decision could have happened. It could have been all in favor of ribbon, it could have been all in favor of VSCC. It seems like they've decided to split some of the decisions. And frankly, I think a lot of this does make sense. Just in some of the initial Twitter perspectives. This isn't necessarily a one and done, sealed it's all over perspective.
00:04:07.530 - 00:04:55.226, Speaker C: We would expect that there will be some appeal. This doesn't actually clarify a lot of the different elements of what potential new regulation would clarify. So I think this is definitely a huge victory for the crypto industry in general, but I think there's still a lot of work to be done. So I would say the other thing just as like a point of delineation. When you're raising capital and you're selling assets, whether those are securities, commodities, property, whatever to do so that contract is considered to be a securities transaction. And when US investors invest in companies, those companies have to file what's called form DS, with the SEC saying that they raised private capital to sell equity in their business or sell whatever in their business. So I think that's probably the logical thread that the judge is taking here.
00:04:55.226 - 00:05:31.350, Speaker C: When you're doing direct sales, whether it be OTC or institutional or capital formation, that's where you need to actually go through a securities contract. And that contract itself is an investment contract. Whereas if you're selling these on an exchange, what they call the programmatic selling, where the seller doesn't know who the buyer is and the buyer doesn't know necessarily that they're buying from Ripple Labs itself and the market determines the price through an order book based transaction. That's where it seems that they've taken the stance that those are not securities transactions. So just a little bit more color on the difference.
00:05:31.500 - 00:05:38.918, Speaker A: Yeah. Vance, what do you think? You had a nice little bullish tweet earlier this week.
00:05:39.084 - 00:06:04.260, Speaker B: Little bullish tweet? Yeah, like we were talking about, it's just crazy how one of these things, it can kind of come out of nowhere and just totally change the narrative and to some extent the trajectory of the space as well. My take on all this is there still might be appeals, there still might be all this stuff that's going to happen, but we just need laws for this stuff. Even this decision doesn't really make a ton of sense.
00:06:05.430 - 00:06:09.282, Speaker A: It's a monumental development, but it doesn't reach out as law.
00:06:09.336 - 00:06:27.062, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great we definitely won. Everyone has that sense. All the crypto lawyers are having a field day just nerd sniping each other on Twitter. But I think, yeah, we just need laws for this stuff. This doesn't feel like a consistent framework that we can apply across an industry that's going to change a lot and grow.
00:06:27.196 - 00:06:30.694, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think? Go ahead on that point.
00:06:30.732 - 00:07:04.738, Speaker C: Great timing. I mean, we have the stablecoin bill, the market structure draft. There's a lot of stuff that's been moving. And at least as of a couple of weeks ago, there were supposed to be some initial votes internally and discussions internally within the House. And then also the Louis Dillebrand redraft just came out a couple of days. You know, this stuff is also happening in parallel to the discussions and negotiations and drafting of laws. So I think if anything, that's probably the biggest takeaway is that this is just perfect timing for us to go into discussions with the lawmakers themselves.
00:07:04.904 - 00:07:17.826, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, let's talk about why this actually matters. I've seen a lot of tweets today that this means that all tokens are not securities. I think that probably is too far and I think that's probably too bullish.
00:07:17.858 - 00:07:20.486, Speaker B: Of a tweet, but that wouldn't be on point entirely.
00:07:20.598 - 00:07:50.338, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, it does feel like though, there's kind of two types of tokens that are kind of coming into view here. There's like, app tokens and there's infrastructure tokens. At least this is how I'm kind of seeing the world infrastructure tokens are. It's becoming more and more clear that they are commodities. Where the commodity here is basically what an L one is doing, is selling block space and we have no idea how to value this block space. It's a totally new business model.
00:07:50.338 - 00:08:05.670, Speaker A: But the token here basically represents the commodity that is the block space. And I think a lot of these, like, L One, maybe L2 tokens will be seen by regulators and policymakers in the years to come as a clear commodity. I think the jury is still out on some of these app tokens.
00:08:06.330 - 00:08:06.790, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:06.860 - 00:08:27.194, Speaker B: I mean, that's why you see everyone launch l Two S, right? Or like, things that look like infrastructure. It kind of creates these weird perverse incentives to ship things where the market is kind of like already naturally saturated. And so if you have a DFI token, if you have some different type of app token to your point, it's still pretty unclear where things lie.
00:08:27.322 - 00:08:28.000, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:29.010 - 00:08:54.082, Speaker C: I would say, though, that even from this decision, there's nothing that changes or that reinforces that perspective. This is very specific to XRP itself. It's just the facts and circumstances of XRP and the transactions that the Ripple Labs team had. Once again, it's great that this happened and this is definitely a feather in the cap of the crypto industry to move forward with more momentum, but I don't think it has anything to do with any other Token.
00:08:54.226 - 00:09:11.434, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair. It does, I think, help the Coinbase lawsuit. Right? Because if listing XRP on exchanges doesn't make it a security, the SEC's case against Coinbase is kind of toast, right? I feel like XRP was probably the easiest coin that the SEC could have used in the Coinbase case.
00:09:11.472 - 00:09:33.874, Speaker B: But maybe on trial drugs, we have no idea. We're not lawyers, obviously. I mean, like, reading through the Ripple case, it was about as egregious as you probably could have gotten. I think my internal expectation was that it was like probably 50 50. Yeah, definitely was not a foregone conclusion, at least for me.
00:09:33.912 - 00:09:50.522, Speaker A: Vance, you had this tweet earlier in the week, so maybe let's just zoom out a little bit from this Ripple news. You have this tweet just kind of like zooming out, talking about just bigger narratives, like where you're seeing the industry. Can you just tell us about that tweet and kind of what sparked that?
00:09:50.576 - 00:11:04.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it was off for like, ten days or something and was working during it, but just was looking at the things that were happening on chain. Real world assets DFI starting to really kind of pick up and be impressive stuff that we're seeing on the private side, prior analogies to past cycles. The timing of where the happening is is a really big factor in each one of these things. And in 2021 being three years away versus being less than a year away today, that's a lot different. And so I think there's definitely a narrative that crypto is failing and that the outlook is not as optimistic, but I've tried to kind of try that perspective on for size. It doesn't really make as much sense if you really consider all of the evidence and facts and things that are being brought on chain. We've talked about this a lot, but if you have $600 million of real world assets that's growing 30% per month, and there's like 15 different companies that are trying to bring this stuff on chain, somebody's going to do this and it's going to work, right? So, yeah, I see that historically, tokenization has been a big thesis as well.
00:11:04.814 - 00:11:34.010, Speaker B: And the hard part about Tokenization historically is that really nothing has been worth bringing on chain. And that was a function of rates being low. So we were bringing on crappy Aspen condos with no one to buy the other side, nothing that would really make a difference. But now, since rates are high, we have this window of the most attractive, most accessible, lowest risk financial instrument being brought on. You know, Asia was a big place.
00:11:34.080 - 00:11:34.700, Speaker A: For.
00:11:37.390 - 00:11:58.900, Speaker B: Like, I wonder if we could see something similar know at some point someone will figure out this regulatory structure and I think that'll be really positive. So I think there's a lot to be optimistic for. And the people who I talk to are generally sidelined in one way or the other. And I think that's kind of part of the other side of the story.
00:11:59.510 - 00:12:01.826, Speaker A: What is that folks are sidelined going.
00:12:01.848 - 00:12:22.250, Speaker B: Into this bull even even in nutritional markets. The people that we talked to especially kind of like East Coast folks, this was supposed to be the year of the Stanley Drucken. Miller recession. Everyone was all bowled up on or I get beared up on that idea and it just hasn't come to pass yet. Not saying that it won't eventually.
00:12:22.590 - 00:12:24.220, Speaker A: You're saying Sax was wrong?
00:12:25.470 - 00:12:49.394, Speaker B: I mean, everyone was on that train and everyone in the Nasdaq just had 40% up first half the best I think ever. Yeah. So that's painful. There is really nothing like just watching something just rip in your face that you want a piece of but also hate. It's like a religious experience. And so I think a lot of people are going through that right now.
00:12:49.512 - 00:12:55.586, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you guys see the Patek Philippe NFT loan talking about bringing things on? Do you guys see this this week?
00:12:55.688 - 00:13:01.560, Speaker B: I mean, not until you mentioned that, but until you send me the telegram. But this is super cool.
00:13:03.450 - 00:13:27.326, Speaker A: Here. I'll describe it for folks. I'll describe it if people didn't see it. So basically this week a lender gave a stranger this $35,000 loan at a 12% Apr and they used a Patek Philippe as collateral here. And the kicker was that this was done completely on chain, basically or with an NFT that got kind of moved into DFI land. So the details of this is that all right, so you have a borrower. Borrower sent the watch to an escrow company.
00:13:27.326 - 00:14:01.738, Speaker A: Escrow company then sends them back an NFT, which represents ownership of the watch. The borrower then listed the NFT on arcade, accepted the best loan offer, and then the NFT was then transferred to an escrow wallet until the term is up or the borrower repays in full. And the only way to get the watch back is by burning the NFT. So if the borrower defaults, the lender can claim the watch. Really cool, right? It's obviously early days and the lender it's cool for two reasons. One is the lender doesn't even have to know the borrower's name. They don't have to know credit history, any of that kind of stuff.
00:14:01.738 - 00:14:50.318, Speaker A: They just have to know that they are the rightful owner of the watch, which is kind of what the escrow company and the NFT does here. And obviously kind of for the naysayers who might say, yeah, you can do this in traditional capital markets for anyone who's tried to get a loan on a weird like kind of an asset like a watch or a piece of art. You can take a watch to a local pawn shop, but yeah, you go to a pawn shop. Yeah, you go to a pawn shop to do it, where you're getting hosed on the rates. But I mean, 12% is still pretty high. But anytime if you look at any market in the world, anytime you tap into global liquidity versus local liquidity, eventually you end up converging on the best rate possible. And so the rates are going to be high in the early days, but eventually you end up bringing these kind of like long tail of assets on chain.
00:14:50.318 - 00:14:58.730, Speaker A: I actually think seeing this, the long chain of assets coming on chain is probably what drives this market. Instead of bringing something like T bills on chain.
00:14:59.310 - 00:15:13.150, Speaker B: T bills are the biggest category, so those are just going to be the biggest. But NFTs are going to be like if you can actually create like a digital pawn shop, that's super interesting because at a pawn shop you can sell something, but you can also just post it and borrow against it.
00:15:13.300 - 00:15:47.722, Speaker A: I guess. Here's why I think that the long tail will bring these folks on chain and then it comes from Treasuries is if you look at how all these web two platforms develop, like YouTube and Airbnb and Uber and Spotify, they basically gain traction. They don't start by bringing the existing supply of whatever they're selling on the marketplace on chain or onto the platform. First. They get traction by enabling this kind of long tail of supply that wasn't ever possible and accessible with prior. Here, let me give an example. So Spotify first starts with all these indie musicians that no one can listen to.
00:15:47.722 - 00:16:12.594, Speaker A: Once they gain traction, then they bring the big labels onto Spotify, Airbnb. There was no way to access that kind of long tail of people posting their houses. Once that happens, now the hotels are posting hotel rooms on Airbnb. Like Uber. Same thing. Etsy, right? Etsy started with this long tail of weird, just little merchants and craft people. Now big brands are posting on their stuff on Etsy as well.
00:16:12.594 - 00:16:47.210, Speaker A: So I think YouTube as well, like Vloggers home video content. Only after that was successful did YouTube get these sports games are streamed on YouTube and traditional TV shows. Now you can watch on YouTube. And so I think when you try to tie this back into DeFi, it seems like Rob Leshner came on the Empire podcast. Love what he's doing with Superstate. I do see that treasury is coming on chain is a big thing, but the typically platforms get traction and drive adoption. When they allow people to access supply that is not possible to access anywhere else gets traction.
00:16:47.210 - 00:16:51.040, Speaker A: Then the big supply comes on board. I could see that happening.
00:16:51.890 - 00:17:37.214, Speaker C: I could potentially see that happening. I would say the likelihood is probably the reverse for playing out in that the access point that you don't have access to currently is, frankly, Treasuries for stablecoin based Treasuries, as in, like, the pools of capital that all these protocols have raised. And I think that that's going to be the catalyst to drive adoption, to tokenize, other things. And that's the enablement. That's the new technology, because right now you have to send them tax Philippe to a custodian who mints the NFT. You're not able to wear that Patek Philippe or you're not able to look at that piece of artwork while you are also borrowing against it. That ability to have utility as well as the financial services applied to that asset, I think is where you take this next.
00:17:37.214 - 00:18:17.210, Speaker C: And that's when it becomes really interesting. Frankly, you have to have a digital asset to be able to do that. So, for instance, you have to be able to have like a financial contract, security, whatever it is, that is represented on chain that's in a digital ecosystem versus a physical item. I haven't come up with a good enough solution to cross that analog digital divide, but we talk about this a lot, whether it's real world assets. Rob Leshner calls them traditional assets. I think the short period of time in the next couple of years, while we see interest rates at 4%, that's going to drive adoption and tokenization of assets in general. And that will drive the enablement of more financial assets that give you the higher yield, that make them more interesting.
00:18:17.210 - 00:18:36.454, Speaker C: They're more bespoke. What we talk about is we think treasury yields will be the driving force here and get the Treasuries with cash sitting idle to invest in it, but then it'll be the tokenization of the long tail that drives consumer adoption. But you have to have more enabling technologies to have that long tail.
00:18:36.522 - 00:18:42.770, Speaker A: How are you guys investing right now? Does this bullishness change the investment thesis at all or just business as usual?
00:18:44.070 - 00:19:22.366, Speaker B: Business as usual. Honestly, I feel like we've just thought through what are the credible thesis areas for crypto to manifest? And I think there's probably like three or four right now. And a lot of this is just already assumed that stuff like this would happen or not. Maybe stuff like the Ripple case, but more so, just courts pushing back or legislation or regulatory clarity in some way. So, yeah, we're always investing for these outcomes. Does it really change anything other than the price to see?
00:19:22.468 - 00:19:23.710, Speaker A: It is nice to see.
00:19:23.860 - 00:19:45.510, Speaker C: I went back and looked at this recently, but apparently I don't know if you've seen this, Vance, but our pacing has been consistent every single month this year in terms of new deals that we've done. So I think that's probably the biggest sign that things haven't really changed or slowed or sped up. The one major difference to Vance's point is the price and the valuation.
00:19:46.570 - 00:19:47.846, Speaker A: How would you do?
00:19:48.028 - 00:20:22.178, Speaker B: Which is interesting, at least for the base layers because the technology is improving. Meme is actually true because if you have ETH, which goes up it's the main asset of collateral and DeFi which then gets more credit taken out on it, which boosts NFT prices, which boosts confidence. It is this kind of health reinforcing system and so yeah, it does change some things for some people. You're probably going to see people throw out even higher targets. Now, that will be some good one.
00:20:22.184 - 00:20:23.650, Speaker A: Hundred K e prices.
00:20:24.150 - 00:20:31.266, Speaker B: And you know as well as anybody when people get riled up it's like the dog chasing its own tail.
00:20:31.378 - 00:21:05.502, Speaker A: It's crazy how quickly you can see the impact of narratives changing on actual things that drive revenue for companies inside of crypto. For us, one of the ways we make money is permissionless and we're having one of the biggest ticket sale days that we've ever had from permissionless. And I think in the last seven days is the biggest permissionless sales ticket week that we've had since we launched permissionless. So it has very quick which then gives us more money, which then we can hire more people, which then brings more people into the industry and it is this nice cycle I found people's.
00:21:05.566 - 00:21:15.220, Speaker B: Maximum narrative cognition level is about a month, like a month ago. People probably can't remember what exactly the narrative was.
00:21:15.910 - 00:21:43.118, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually have been doing this thing since COVID where at the end of every day, it actually started during COVID to just get thoughts out of my head when my mind was just racing. Just like end of every day, just like brain dump thoughts onto a piece of paper, into just like a notion doc and then just let it sit. And I'm like, okay, now I'm done with the day I can go to sleep or whatever and it's really interesting looking back at these things. So I've been doing it every day for three years now.
00:21:43.204 - 00:21:43.818, Speaker B: Damn.
00:21:43.914 - 00:21:58.018, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's like usually one sentence like, today sucked. This happened. Or like today was great. You recorded a good podcast, like hired this new person. I don't know. They're like Ripple Case bullish Fun Day or something.
00:21:58.018 - 00:22:05.330, Speaker A: But it's really interesting. Yeah, even like a month ago, it's like damn things are a grind. Just kind of like bearish sentiment.
00:22:05.910 - 00:22:35.498, Speaker B: I mean, people can't remember how max bearish it was near the bottom. They can't remember what the sentiment was a month ago. They don't remember the last cycle. What happened? There is this in it's one of Edward Chancellor's books. The guy who wrote Devil Take the Hindmost. But he's know history is usually like a guiding post for every know discipline except for finance is you have like a year of memory. Interesting.
00:22:35.498 - 00:22:36.202, Speaker B: Which is interesting.
00:22:36.256 - 00:22:37.100, Speaker A: Well, it is.
00:22:38.210 - 00:22:44.926, Speaker C: Speaking of a year, do you know what happened exactly a year ago? Celsius put out bankruptcy wow I was.
00:22:44.948 - 00:22:51.410, Speaker A: Going to say this is around the terra blowing up too probably a month after no, May of 2022.
00:22:51.560 - 00:23:35.540, Speaker C: That was May Eigth or 9th of 2022. And then you had like June 13 ish as when everybody was just like market selling all the different assets and that month up until July 13 and today is July 13. That was the extent of the max bearish, max pain, everything's going to get sold off or didn't get liquidated tracking everything on. Then, you know, when Celsius declared bankruptcy, that's kind of when everything was over to a large extent. Obviously you had the FTF stuff which happened later in the fall, but there was like a month period. And this is sort of like the marking of the end of that crazy period. So I was thinking about that before we started recording today.
00:23:35.990 - 00:23:46.710, Speaker B: If you look at it, most of crypto, well, I guess Bitcoin did make a fresh bottom, but ETH bottomed in June, I believe, or maybe it was July.
00:23:47.930 - 00:23:50.440, Speaker C: It was June 13, right?
00:23:54.330 - 00:24:17.226, Speaker B: Of course it was like a meme number because we just roll like that. But then you look at all the other technology stocks and they bottomed in the fall and it is this kind of know, first in, first out or crypto definitely leads a lot of these moves and it's been lagging recently, but compared to stocks.
00:24:17.418 - 00:24:18.160, Speaker A: But.
00:24:20.210 - 00:24:25.230, Speaker B: It'Ll be interesting to see for the rest of the year. Tom Lee. I don't know Tom Lee.
00:24:25.570 - 00:24:25.897, Speaker A: Do you?
00:24:25.897 - 00:24:26.318, Speaker B: Who know Tom Lee?
00:24:26.334 - 00:24:27.810, Speaker A: Is Yano the buttstrack guy?
00:24:27.880 - 00:24:28.114, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:28.152 - 00:24:29.330, Speaker A: Funstrack. Oh yeah.
00:24:29.480 - 00:24:49.874, Speaker B: Michael and I have subscribed to him for probably at least like four or five years at this. You know, a lot of his calls, really optimistic, really bullish, but mostly contrarian. And whenever he goes on CNBC, they just take him to the woodshed, especially when he's wrong, just rip him apart. But he's generally always bullish.
00:24:50.002 - 00:24:52.182, Speaker A: He's just an eternal optimist. He is.
00:24:52.236 - 00:24:54.042, Speaker B: And he seems like a really nice guy too.
00:24:54.176 - 00:24:58.506, Speaker A: I met him back in 2018 at Pop's office. And he's just a good guy.
00:24:58.688 - 00:25:14.354, Speaker B: He doesn't really kind of play around the crypto hoop until the bottom of the bear market and then he's like the only guy who's still bullish. But he really did call this market over the past year, just to the extent that no one else has. Being optimistic pays off.
00:25:14.472 - 00:25:38.754, Speaker A: It does. Coinbase is up like 150%, I think, on the year. It is 80% this month, or 50% this. I haven't looked at this stock in the last day or two, but I think it's been ripping. Anyways, coinbase announced two big things this week. One was Base is open for biz. So I think Base main net just opened to users today or yesterday.
00:25:38.754 - 00:26:23.074, Speaker A: And then they also announced wallet to Wallet messaging this week, which is whether or not it's a big use case, I have no idea. But I just think it's cool to see people pushing the innovation on the wallet side. So if people missed this. Basically, Coinbase Wallet launched built in messaging, which is powered by the Xmtp Protocol. It is end to end encrypted, private, portable. You can see them kind of trying to compete with someone, like a signal maybe in how they message this thing, but it allows you to connect directly through your wallet, engage with both B to C and kind of consumer to consumer. I can message you Vance and Michael and then we were pretty excited about this at Blockworks because we can message our community essentially on chain.
00:26:23.074 - 00:26:45.838, Speaker A: So for and here's a real use case is we sold these Permies, right? And Permies get you access, have a bunch of utility. They get you like if you're a Permi holder, you get access to Blockworks research for free. You get a lifetime pass to permissionless. There's like a private channel, all this cool stuff. And Permi community is super strong. There's no way for us to message them. Let's say you went and bought a permi today.
00:26:45.838 - 00:27:16.214, Speaker A: There's no way for me to go message you, Michael, and tell you what we need to tell you. Like, hey, by the way, you get a free pass to permissionless. It's in September. We have to basically rely on you following us on Twitter and then you seeing the tweet and then jumping in the discord. Right? So now for the first time ever, we can message all permi holders and be like, hey, by the way, if you haven't got your permissionless ticket, and then they can respond to us. It's very cool. So it's a good way for these protocols and companies to engage with their mean.
00:27:16.332 - 00:27:51.794, Speaker C: At the same time, you have Google Play announcing a reversal of their previous opinion of not allowing NFTs in app to be bought, sold, used as basically for the exact same purpose that you're talking about. So Google Play Store, Android phones will allow apps with NFTs going mean. I think that there's going to be a large scale recognition that NFTs are going to eventually become not just an asset with financial value and interest in that respect, but it's also going to be something that has consumer appeal for use cases outside of the financial ones.
00:27:51.912 - 00:28:06.520, Speaker A: Yeah. Look at the Google Product Manager. His quote was from reimagining traditional games with user owned content to boosting user loyalty through unique NFT rewards. We're excited to see creative in app experiences flourish and help developers expand their.
00:28:10.170 - 00:28:25.802, Speaker B: Like even messaging. And the interplay between games is super interesting. If you can really get the social network going on chain and then you get an ad network, you can build it up pretty quickly into a very real, probably not quite as degenerate ecosystem.
00:28:25.946 - 00:28:30.074, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they launch an ad network. I have a feeling Coinbase will launch an ad network.
00:28:30.202 - 00:28:40.578, Speaker B: There's a few people trying to build ad networks that's another Antonio. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting efforts on that space.
00:28:40.744 - 00:28:46.606, Speaker A: Yeah. What. Else are you guys looking at? What else happened this week? Oh, Richie.
00:28:46.798 - 00:28:48.162, Speaker B: Or Richie Torres.
00:28:48.306 - 00:29:10.454, Speaker A: Yeah. Shout out Richie Torres. So this Richie Torres is congressman for NY 15 in the Bronx. He tweeted out about an hour or two ago. He said, Gary Gensler is acting like an overzealous traffic cop, arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret. Great analogy, actually. He prefers to communicate by enforcement rather than by rules or guidance.
00:29:10.454 - 00:29:13.770, Speaker A: But that's no way to regulate crypto. I'm calling for an investigation.
00:29:15.630 - 00:29:17.570, Speaker B: Man, what a shift.
00:29:17.750 - 00:29:27.460, Speaker A: Which is big, because if you look at the people who have called out Gensler in the past, it's primarily Republicans. Right. And this is kind of the Dems starting to turn on Gensler as.
00:29:29.670 - 00:29:35.220, Speaker B: Mean. It's kind of hard to imagine that FTX was, what, like nine months ago?
00:29:36.010 - 00:29:36.758, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:36.924 - 00:29:59.066, Speaker B: I would have thought this arc would have taken a lot longer because we've gone through it happening, everybody being in trouble, enforcement actions, lawsuits, cases. And now it's kind of like the pushback is a little bit there on the SEC, and people are more seeing it our way. It's just quick. Honestly, in my opinion, I thought it would have taken longer.
00:29:59.168 - 00:29:59.578, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:59.664 - 00:30:08.586, Speaker C: I have no idea what an investigation into the SEC actually means or what the process is, but just the narrative, I think, is really positive.
00:30:08.778 - 00:30:20.082, Speaker B: A lot of these things are, like, also political statements. Exactly like when Warren Davidson said he was going to know. It's just not going to happen.
00:30:20.216 - 00:30:27.240, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. What else is going on? How are things at Framework? Things are good.
00:30:28.090 - 00:30:36.918, Speaker B: Just kind of getting back from break for the most part. Michael's on his week off, we tend to switch off just in case goes wrong.
00:30:37.084 - 00:30:40.060, Speaker A: You each take every other week? Yeah.
00:30:41.230 - 00:30:42.250, Speaker C: Consistently.
00:30:42.990 - 00:31:08.386, Speaker B: Summers? Yeah. What else? Honestly, just investing, but the bar is high. I think that's kind of the theme with everyone that we talk to. And there's a few different verticals that you can pick. It's not like one thing anymore, which is nice. It feels like more dispersed than when everyone was just trying to do D.
00:31:08.408 - 00:31:46.026, Speaker C: Five with any venture investment. And this kind of goes back to what we were talking about with the delineation between that the judge made in the Ripple case. It depends on your jurisdiction and it depends on the legal perspectives of that jurisdiction. But just about in any venture deal, you're selling equity and tokens. And so it doesn't really matter which side you are on when it comes to the investment itself. But, yeah, if you're doing a private deal, it's going to have both features included. Just because over the long arc of things, I think a lot of companies that don't expect to have a token will probably have a token.
00:31:46.026 - 00:32:03.010, Speaker C: And many of these companies start off as labs organizations, but ultimately launch an infrastructure based L2 or something like that, where a token is necessary. So I think a lot of the convergence will happen over time, especially with venture deals. What about Arkham?
00:32:03.830 - 00:32:05.250, Speaker A: Oh, God, that's.
00:32:07.590 - 00:32:11.254, Speaker B: What are they doing? Actually kind of like DOX people on.
00:32:11.292 - 00:32:16.760, Speaker A: Chain, did they do the token sale because they failed a fundraise or what happened here?
00:32:17.290 - 00:32:20.354, Speaker B: There was a lot going on. I don't know what happened with the fundraise.
00:32:20.402 - 00:32:38.186, Speaker A: It's funny, people love Arkham's product. I feel like it was like starting to compete with Nansen and then they just blew it. I mean, Mike and I were talking about this, the number of companies that just self sabotage themselves. Like, do you what are you doing? Yeah. And the self sabotage in crypto is remarkable.
00:32:38.378 - 00:32:41.280, Speaker B: The bear market tends to bring that out in people.
00:32:41.970 - 00:32:47.966, Speaker A: I think there's just a yeah, I mean, some bad operators or the bull.
00:32:47.998 - 00:32:55.038, Speaker B: Market decisions kind of come home to roost. That's the other flavor. The bull market decisions come home to roost.
00:32:55.134 - 00:32:55.602, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:32:55.656 - 00:32:59.310, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. We did this thing two years ago. It's like, oh, no, I mean, I.
00:32:59.320 - 00:33:05.906, Speaker C: Tweeted this a while ago, but I think just about every startup that dies is not killed by homicide, but actually suicide quietly.
00:33:05.938 - 00:33:18.314, Speaker A: I feel like a lot of small seed companies, like Sub, ten person companies, have just kind of been closing their doors. Some are returning capital. Have we seen the end of that or does that keep going basically for the rest of this year? I would assume it keeps going.
00:33:18.352 - 00:33:19.082, Speaker B: Keeps going.
00:33:19.216 - 00:34:08.602, Speaker C: Definitely keeps going. I would imagine that this fall it gets even more dire just because you have a lot of the people that raised for 1824 months during 2021. They're out of capital by the end of 2023, and they probably have done things to sustain or prolong what ultimately will be the inevitable, which is a massive write down in terms of what their valuation is based on. Last round, needing to raise capital to survive or frankly, just to wind down. We've seen a couple of companies who were raising and then they came back to the table and said, actually, we're just not going to raise and shut things down. Which is the first time that I've really seen that. I think it comes from a recognition of, like, the market has completely changed, the outcomes have potentially completely changed as well.
00:34:08.602 - 00:34:20.000, Speaker C: And people just get burned by the bear market and their heart's not in it. And frankly, entrepreneurship is not something where if you're not 110% in, you can't do it. So I think a lot of people are realizing that.
00:34:21.170 - 00:34:44.422, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of the more, I would say consumer crypto startups are having some trouble, probably the NFT ones. That market has changed a lot. But if people want to continue on, they can generally raise money at a down fire sale, whatever valuation, it just gets back to Michael's point, like, how bad do you want it? Is that worth it? To you versus going off and doing something else with the next couple of years.
00:34:44.556 - 00:34:47.542, Speaker C: Weeks like this made me think we're going to have a fun time in the next few years.
00:34:47.596 - 00:34:52.460, Speaker A: But, yeah, the pivot to AI is dead, so I'm stoked about that.
00:34:53.310 - 00:35:01.238, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw a tweet today that was like, is Chat GPT the MySpace of AI? Maybe not, but it kind of does get you thinking.
00:35:01.424 - 00:35:09.002, Speaker C: Chat GPT month over month is down like 10%. The chart on interest for Google Trends of chat GPT is not looking positive.
00:35:09.066 - 00:35:10.750, Speaker A: Do you guys use chat GBT.
00:35:12.610 - 00:35:14.126, Speaker B: Probably once a week?
00:35:14.308 - 00:35:15.098, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:15.284 - 00:35:31.640, Speaker B: If I want to find out some random kind of permutation of a Wikipedia fact, it's pretty good for that. But I don't know. Yeah, I don't fully get it.
00:35:33.850 - 00:35:34.966, Speaker A: I use it a lot.
00:35:35.068 - 00:35:36.198, Speaker B: What do you use it for?
00:35:36.284 - 00:36:07.566, Speaker A: Basically, like, getting off zero with a Google Doc. So here's an example. We just brought on a VP of sales, and we create 30 60, 90 day plans for everyone who joins Blockworks, especially, like, Execs or leadership team. And I don't know, we've never had a VP of sales, right? And so I was, like, sitting at this Google Doc being like, all right, let's discuss 30, 60 90. And I just went to GBT and was like, all right, here's some context. We're like a 50 plus person media company in crypto. Here's our revenue, here's how big the sales team is.
00:36:07.566 - 00:36:27.560, Speaker A: We got this VP of sales, here's where he's coming from. Create a 30 60 90 day plan. Got me like, 70% of the way. It spit out, like, a summary, and I was like, make this into two pages worth of stuff. Gave me super detailed analysis. I was like, Break it down week by week. And then I copied that into a Google Doc and chopped it around and then added my own flavor, obviously.
00:36:28.490 - 00:36:33.866, Speaker B: Cannabis word context for me, for at least what we do, I don't think.
00:36:33.888 - 00:36:58.482, Speaker A: What you guys do is as useful. I mean, we've played around with you can actually connect not GBT, but there's some open source LLMs now. We've debated basically connecting a couple of the open source LLMs to our governance platform. Maybe I shouldn't share this. Whatever I'll share, it might leak some product alpha. That's okay, though. I don't think other teams know how to build it.
00:36:58.482 - 00:37:09.202, Speaker A: And basically making it so that you can update the governance proposals in real time as they come in. You can summarize them using, like, an open source LLM.
00:37:09.346 - 00:37:21.794, Speaker B: Give to me. That's like, not me using AI. That's like you using AI for me. I'm down for that, though. That sounds great. We're subs. We sub to Blockworks research fans.
00:37:21.842 - 00:37:25.830, Speaker A: You tried, like, seven times to subscribe to it. I kept getting failed notification.
00:37:29.050 - 00:37:32.126, Speaker B: I'm the nightmare user that reads all your stuff?
00:37:32.228 - 00:37:40.570, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Should we wrap it's.
