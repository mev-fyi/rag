00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.054, Speaker A: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy. Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. You got Mike's one and two and Vance. Fellas, welcome back to the show.
00:00:17.092 - 00:00:17.790, Speaker B: Glad to be back.
00:00:17.860 - 00:00:29.538, Speaker A: I apologize for the rugging of the Internet last week. It's also criminal. I can't believe I haven't done a show with Yano since Sweating. Got lots of stories and I got no reactions.
00:00:29.714 - 00:00:33.480, Speaker B: And you and I met in person for the first time a week and a half ago.
00:00:34.730 - 00:00:44.266, Speaker A: I know, man. We had a very nice dinner. I thought we had a nice panel, but my favorite part was the dinner. I'm going to be real. Wow. It was lovely. Yeah, we got some good bonding time.
00:00:44.266 - 00:00:47.322, Speaker A: Yeah. Talked about some sci-fi books. It was good.
00:00:47.376 - 00:00:50.780, Speaker B: Wait, speaking of, what was the show that we were talking?
00:00:53.250 - 00:01:04.186, Speaker A: Counterpart. Yeah, counterpart. Dude, it is worth a watch. JK. Simmons is it might be better than his whiplash.
00:01:04.218 - 00:01:05.462, Speaker B: That's a bold claim.
00:01:05.626 - 00:01:06.980, Speaker A: It's extremely good.
00:01:07.670 - 00:01:10.354, Speaker C: I don't know. That's like top five.
00:01:10.472 - 00:01:21.080, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a spicy watch. Just just watch the first episode. Watch the first episode and you'll see what it's a it's a tour de force for J. K. Simmons, I think.
00:01:21.850 - 00:01:22.502, Speaker C: Wow.
00:01:22.636 - 00:01:38.362, Speaker A: You know who's not having tour de force week is Kanye West. Kanye west. So the first 45 minutes of show is going to be Kanye West and how he's on his way to no longer being allowed in America, basically. But tough week. Tough week for the Yay. Yeah.
00:01:38.416 - 00:01:46.650, Speaker B: I mean, the only thing to say about that is it's pretty clear that something's going on and that probably should just step off the airwaves.
00:01:46.810 - 00:02:03.922, Speaker A: I think so too. Yeah, that's the very humane response. Yeah, it is tough. He has such an enormous megaphone. And I don't want to diagnose from I don't know what. I don't know. But yeah, definitely someone should probably yank away the Instagram, the Twitter for a little while.
00:02:03.976 - 00:02:06.886, Speaker B: I think a digital retreat would be.
00:02:07.068 - 00:02:10.470, Speaker C: Probably put the toys what's ordered. Yeah.
00:02:10.620 - 00:02:12.498, Speaker A: Well advised. Yeah, well advised.
00:02:12.594 - 00:02:13.880, Speaker C: Try yourself out.
00:02:14.250 - 00:02:31.098, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, guys, we're back. I got some charts. We're actually going to start with some non crypto stuff here, but I actually just wanted to get your take overall on. So I've got up here. Let me know when you guys can see. Got a couple of different assets here.
00:02:31.098 - 00:02:55.134, Speaker A: I've got Meta and Snap because those were some of the big web. Two companies that just had earnings. And I've got ETH and bitcoin over it. So I saw this chart from Mika Honkasalo. I'm going to butcher his last name, but it was like year to date performance for Meta and Snap versus ETH and Bitcoin. And this is actually from one year ago. So this is from like the pico top, basically of both those assets.
00:02:55.134 - 00:03:18.460, Speaker A: And they're still outperforming much larger, well established web, two companies. We're going to talk about Meta earnings in a little bit, but what's your guys take on? This is the last five days there's been a nice healthy bounce here for ETH and Bitcoin, to a lesser extent, obviously pretty and Snaps done. Okay, Meta, absolutely brutal. What do you guys think about just the bounce in crypto this last week?
00:03:19.630 - 00:04:23.870, Speaker B: I have more commentary around Snap and Meta than I do commentary around the bounce in crypto. I mean, I think frankly, the bounce in crypto is just an overdue adjustment of the understanding of the valuation of these assets. Frankly, the Meta stuff and the Snap stuff, just going back to that over the last year, and we'll talk about this probably later when we talk about NFTs and Apple, what has happened. And I think this is not a fundamentally nuanced take, but having spent a couple of years at Snap attracting transparency is driving the business model of direct response advertising into the ground. Basically, Apple has gotten rid of the identifier for advertisers. The IDFA replaced it with this thing called the SCAD Network, which is essentially an audience network advertising element. But that doesn't have the ability to basically say, I want to target these people and let me know when these people have purchased something.
00:04:23.870 - 00:04:49.434, Speaker B: And that was the basis of basically all of the app install ads for both Snap and Facebook or Meta. And that fundamentally has gone away. And this happened probably about a year ago. So not surprising that we've seen the business models adjust. But I think that this isn't something that's going to change. This is going to be here for a while, and Apple's not going to relent. They're not going to go back on what they've done already.
00:04:49.434 - 00:04:56.300, Speaker B: So you have to reinvent your business model. Meta is trying to do that, but doing that at an exceedingly exorbitant cost.
00:04:57.710 - 00:05:23.538, Speaker A: Yeah, just to double click on why that's so important, like Attribution, if anyone out there is listening, is involved in an ad sales type business model. Attribution is like a key, key driver for how you're going to succeed in a sale. Because the first thing that if you ask someone to spend a million dollars in advertising with you, they're going to say, okay, how can I determine what my ROI is? Facebook arguably had the most advanced Attribution mechanism known to man, basically, and what they would do.
00:05:23.624 - 00:05:47.530, Speaker B: Let's be clear, too, there is brand advertising, which is basically putting up billboards all over the Internet. YouTube is classic in doing this. They also have direct response, which is a call to action based advertising unit. And if you're not actioning, if there's no way to verify whether or not that action is happening, you can't verify to your point whether or not the advertisement actually works and the targeting actually works, which is the basis of those businesses.
00:05:48.910 - 00:06:29.318, Speaker A: Exactly. And there is there's brand advertising, then there's direct response. The thing is, the Google and Facebook oligopoly, why those platforms are so seductive is there's this really easy kind of login sign in and they make it very clear to say you spend X amount of dollars and you get X amount out. They make it very clear and easy to understand what the ROI is. So, just to be clear, in theory, there's been no difference for how effective Facebook's advertisements are, but they can't as clearly say with as much certainty in their attribution models. Okay, you spent $1 and you're getting $2 out, but the ads are still getting served to the same amount of people. They just can't prove it as effectively, and it makes it less monetizable.
00:06:29.414 - 00:07:13.862, Speaker B: Actually, that's an interesting question. The ads are still running, the ads are still flying, but what is changing is the audience or the lookalike customization where you say, okay, I'm adjusting my ad. It's not like someone just puts on a unique custom audience and they say, okay, just run it for the next twelve months. It's constantly being refined, constantly being adjusted, and now you don't have the ability to have that refinement. The repurchases of these ad units are just not happening. And sure you can brain advertise everywhere and you can basically say, I want to target males in the US age 18 to 24, but you're not going to be able to refine that further after the fact. And that's really where they make the money, or at least you two, right?
00:07:13.996 - 00:08:02.982, Speaker A: Well, the other thing that happens there too is because they can't trace as many purchases to the ad dollars that are spent, it looks like your CPA is going up basically. So what you do is you go to an advertising agency, they are the ones who typically like, hey, this is what we should do, we're going to spend on basically just Google and Facebook, and then there's Attribution. That's done on those platforms. And if Facebook can't do Attribution as well because they're blocking the pixel on Facebook, when you go to Safari on your phone, then Facebook, instead of being able to say, oh look, you spent $1 and got two, it's going to be like, oh, you spent $1 and got a dollar. And so suddenly you as, the advertiser is going to be like, whoa, why is my CPA going up so much? I'm going to spend less money. That's like the big headwind. That's happened a while ago, but then it was a really tough earnings call for them.
00:08:02.982 - 00:08:30.442, Speaker A: So their stock is down something like 22% on the day. We're recording this on Thursday the 27th. There's a whole bunch of stuff basically that's been happening. So basically their revenue is down 4% in the last quarter. It was a revenue miss and an earnings miss. The other two reasons why they're getting dinged here is because their costs are continuing to grow, right? So ad budgets are kind of one of the first things. They're super discretionary.
00:08:30.442 - 00:09:07.246, Speaker A: So companies kind of tend to reel those in when there are macroeconomic headwinds, which there definitely are. And I think what analysts expected were for Facebook to reel those costs in. They've kept headcount flat, so that's at least relatively good. But their costs are continuing to expand to between 96 and $101,000,000,000. In particular, Reality Labs, which is their Metaverse sort of unit, had a 49% drop in revenue to 285,000,000. That's an operating loss of 3.7 billion on the quarter, and they expect a $10 billion dent to operating profit in 2023.
00:09:07.246 - 00:09:22.750, Speaker A: And Zuckerberg himself has said, yeah, that's probably going to go higher. So basically, investors are like, dude, you have got to fix this. Am I missing something from that take? It doesn't look great. I suppose.
00:09:24.770 - 00:09:41.880, Speaker C: What you're missing is that these platforms are growing. Like, Instagram today has a billion two users. They're supposed to get to 1.45 by the end of 2025. Like adding a few hundred million users. That's a lot of economics. The growth rate isn't that good, but DAUs Maus are generally up.
00:09:41.880 - 00:10:01.190, Speaker C: Engagement with the app is generally up. I think the thing that really matters is they're just getting squeezed by Apple. That's kind of really what's going down here. If things were status quo as of last year, probably a lot different conversation. But now that this has changed, the underlying economics of the business and all of the assumptions that it was built on are kind of valid.
00:10:01.350 - 00:10:46.122, Speaker B: Snap is a single platform app. It's only existing on mobile devices. Facebook at least has the ability to have web. So Apple isn't as relevant to Facebook, which is why you're seeing the delayed effect and sort of the slow unwinding of the Facebook business model from an att direct response advertising perspective. Whereas this time last year, I remember Vance and I were sitting in a conference room and that was the day that Snap dropped 33% after earnings lost a third of its valuation in a day. The other thing that I'd add just to the Meta conversation, in particular, Meta yesterday reported earnings. The stock actually traded up for a short period of time until Zuck got on the call and started asking answering questions about what was going to happen.
00:10:46.122 - 00:11:30.090, Speaker B: And what also happened this week is Brad Gersner from Alterbiter Capital wrote an open letter saying, you need to rein in costs, you need to rein in expenses. This whole Meta thing, Metaverse, that is a red herring. You need to run away from it. And basically what happened on the call is he basically said, I'm not going to do that. I'm not listening to you, and I'm not listening to anybody either because I have supermajority shareholding and I can vote however I want to. So I really think this is more a reaction to just the indiscretion for shareholders that Zuck is showcasing. But it know, obviously all the other stuff as headwinds to this already big growing problem of Meta.
00:11:31.230 - 00:11:34.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that was the only.
00:11:34.800 - 00:12:11.238, Speaker C: Thing I would add is that if you look at the chart of Meta, so it peaked at like a trillion, 1.1 trillion, basically, and it's gone down 70% since. Ethan and Meta's market cap are becoming pretty similar. Ethan is a pretty decent shot at flipping in the near future. I think that's when things start to get really interesting is when you're forced to mentally put one company, Ethereum and another company in a sandwich. When you think about their valuation, it's like, well, it has more cash flow than this one. It's more deflationary than that one.
00:12:11.238 - 00:12:31.766, Speaker C: You can start to make a real argument for these things as the next generation of tech stock assets. And I think forcing that valuation framework will be very useful to people, even if it's just on a market cap basis. Like, ETH is already trading basically as much volume as Bitcoin at this point. The market is really changing a lot, which feels pretty good and different than the summer.
00:12:31.798 - 00:12:59.190, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I think you already started to see that narrative. You kind of started to hear this a little bit last year during the bull market. But if Bitcoin was digital gold, then ETH was kind of like the fang like Bet. And I don't necessarily agree with that, but I do think that's a powerful because Fang, you know, as a sector or little subunit of the Nasdaq, has basically been the best performing the last decade by a mile. So it's a powerful narrative. I agree.
00:12:59.340 - 00:13:00.470, Speaker B: It's growth.
00:13:01.290 - 00:13:36.354, Speaker C: Yeah. And the thing that it has is no overhead, basically no costs other than those borne by stakers and the cost to actually stake your asset. It's kind of like the opposite of everything that you see with Meta, where it's like, how do we get these costs down? How much money do we actually need to spend? Is centralization actually like a bad thing? Or should you compete on a more resource level like Ethereum? I think those are going to be really interesting questions, but at some level, if it gets back to all time highs in terms of fees, ETH is going to look, from an economic standpoint, very similar to these large tech companies.
00:13:36.472 - 00:14:04.170, Speaker B: Reasons why decentralization is important. You've got literally one of the largest, most prevalent products on the face of the earth, run by someone who has 21 shareholding power and maintains control. And it seems like the direction is whatever he says the direction is, whereas you're talking about an open source protocol that doesn't have anyone who controls it. This is fundamentally the power of decentralization.
00:14:05.870 - 00:14:45.846, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that is kind of the nail on the head of just like shareholder rights, basically. And nobody cares about founder control, right when everything's going well. But as soon as it turns around, everyone's like, whoa, I'm not so sure about this. There's almost like an interesting glass doors moment where Steve Jobs obviously was the visionary, specifically the product visionary behind then, you know, Rip, Steve Jobs passed away and passed it on to Tim Cook. Tim Cook probably not a product visionary, but that guy, he was an operator, right? And he was definitely more friendly to shareholders. He instituted buybacks that's, like, company lifecycle type stuff. So maybe you will see.
00:14:45.846 - 00:14:47.526, Speaker A: And honestly, Snap has the same problem here, right?
00:14:47.548 - 00:14:54.140, Speaker B: Evan even worse. You know how many votes a Class A shareholder has in Snap? Zero.
00:14:54.670 - 00:14:55.530, Speaker A: I do not.
00:14:55.600 - 00:15:06.490, Speaker B: It's the first stock to ever trade on the New York Stock Exchange without any shareholder voting. How can that is beyond.
00:15:11.150 - 00:15:18.194, Speaker A: Like, at a high level. What is an equity if you have no claim on cash flow or voting rights? I mean, why does it have any value at all?
00:15:18.232 - 00:15:19.780, Speaker B: It snaps down 90%.
00:15:22.710 - 00:16:06.394, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess the theory of software investing is that you should have a product that's able to be digitally replicated. It's low cost to distribute. You can give it to people for free, and at a certain scale, you can just stop your costs. But if it grows linearly, then you have a really big problem. And if you can't downsize quick enough, then you have a big hole in your balance sheet. And so I think that's going to be the really interesting thing to see, is do these tech companies issue more stock? Do they issue more debt? That was a core part of at least the Netflix playbook in the 2016 1718 time, where zero interest rates were prevalent. So it's going to be interesting to see kind of what they do, but I'd expect to see a lot of the small mid cap ones get pretty seriously hurt.
00:16:06.442 - 00:16:34.714, Speaker A: I think this is just a theory of mine. I don't know what you guys I haven't heard anyone talk about this, but I wonder if antitrust has anything to do with this. Because typically the way that Facebook dealt with innovation in the past was they would just buy it, right? That's what they did with Instagram. That's what they did with WhatsApp and they had to pay a higher and higher price, but who cares, right? I mean, they were growing like mad. Now they can't do that because Department of justice signaled like, hey, we don't like this anymore. So there has to be something else. There has to be another story.
00:16:34.714 - 00:16:35.962, Speaker A: There has to be another I mean.
00:16:36.016 - 00:16:50.110, Speaker B: That playbook has been run through, and it's gone, at least for the foreseeable future, maybe a new direction, a new perspective, a new administration. That narrative changes, but at least as it stands right now, there is no ability to acquire growth.
00:16:51.330 - 00:16:59.650, Speaker A: Yeah. 100%. I got one last take for you that I heard from this guy, Mitch Lasky. I don't know if you know him from the gaming world.
00:16:59.720 - 00:17:01.170, Speaker B: A board member at Snap.
00:17:02.630 - 00:18:06.200, Speaker A: There you go. All right. He had a take on I was listening to an interview he did where he got asked about reality labs at Meta, and he was like, basically, there have been three pushes for VR in the past, and they've all coincided with big Sci-Fi novels, which was Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and Ready Player One. And he was basically like, none of those really worked. And I've noticed maybe there will be someday like a VR kind of world where we're all interacting with our avatars and whatnot. I've always personally thought the way Metaverse is talked about in crypto has more to do with, like, base layer property rights where you can build something in a digital realm and that ownership is verified outside of one monolithic institution. But it has been, like, such a powerful meme that has just captured people's imaginations around I guess my question, you guys, are we eventually when Zuck talks about his vision for the Metaverse, do we head towards that or mean because it is seductive and I kind of get it, but I kind of agree with Mitch's Take.
00:18:07.930 - 00:18:50.518, Speaker C: Maybe I don't think VR and AR has as much to do with like, the metaverse is technologically ambivalent. I think it's more native to the Internet as a concept. But I think what the metaverse is about is like, how do you log on your computer and make money? You can't do that on Twitter. You can't do that on Instagram, can't do that on any of these platforms. What if I play a game? What if I LP in some DEXes? What if I stake my ETH? Can I make enough of a financial life for myself? Native to the Internet? And that, to me at least, feels like the metaverse. When you send an ethereum transaction, when you sign something, when you interact with the contract, that feels like magic. It feels like you're touching something different.
00:18:50.518 - 00:18:58.266, Speaker C: And I think that's more at least native to my own understanding of the metaverse than strapping on an Oculus. I think we're already not as much.
00:18:58.288 - 00:19:43.894, Speaker B: For me, there is a way to do that now, which is influencers and content creators. And that's native to the Internet. Precisely. That's exactly my point, which is that's the only viable option right now. Whereas instead of trying to amass a million Instagram followers to be able to sell your Instagram posts, there now are new ways of interacting on the Internet and doing jobs and getting paid. That's a fundamentally different and I do think, frankly, one of the things that I'm waiting for personally is what will Apple do here? And I know it sounds cliche, but they have invented these product categories multiple times over. And you would expect they're supposedly working on something, they have been for the last four years.
00:19:43.894 - 00:20:10.734, Speaker B: It's supposed to come out in the next one to two years. We'll see what that ultimately ends up becoming an AR kit I think that they've released over the last two or three years is a move in the direction to build the software base to be able to coincide with some piece of hardware. But it's not going to be an Oculus. I actually don't think it's going to be virtual reality. I think it's be augmented or mixed reality to Mitch's point. But we haven't seen the hardware platform created yet. That just blows this whole thing away.
00:20:10.734 - 00:20:13.950, Speaker B: Right now, what we have with the Oculus is the equivalent to the Palm Pilot.
00:20:16.450 - 00:20:29.746, Speaker A: I agree with you on that. I think it's just too ambitious. Basically, I'm not smart enough tech wise to be like, is it actually ever going to work or is it not? But I don't know, maybe just I.
00:20:29.768 - 00:21:01.840, Speaker C: Don'T think you can intentionally create a metaverse. I don't think that's something that you can do if you set out and say, I'm going to go build this place for everyone to hang out online. Generally, those don't really work as concepts, but if you build an association around an asset like ETH, or being like a patron of the arts in NFTs, or actually using your collateral with DeFi, that's how you create. What I think is metaverse games are just like an onboarding funnel. I don't think VR has anything to do with it.
00:21:05.810 - 00:21:33.130, Speaker A: No, man, I agree. But I guess we'll have to see it. I will say, if I could just offer one thing. I mean, that guy, there are these stories about him, right? When Yahoo tried to acquire Facebook when they were worth $4 billion, his entire board is begging him to go forward with the acquisitions. Like, no. And then there was the Pivot to mobile, right, in whatever it was, like, 2007 or nine. And it was like, don't bring me anything unless it's mobile.
00:21:33.130 - 00:21:36.554, Speaker A: But I guess you can only do that so many times.
00:21:36.592 - 00:21:44.800, Speaker B: You live long enough as the hero to end up becoming the villain. The other take here is like, what did Cheryl know?
00:21:48.450 - 00:21:49.600, Speaker A: You know what?
00:21:51.570 - 00:21:59.410, Speaker C: Didn't matter. How long was she there? 14 years. Some absurd.
00:22:00.470 - 00:22:07.042, Speaker A: A long time. Yeah. Probably get this pretty easily.
00:22:07.186 - 00:22:10.550, Speaker B: I mean, she was probably there, like, what, 2007, 2008?
00:22:10.700 - 00:22:13.238, Speaker C: Yeah. 14 years.
00:22:13.324 - 00:22:23.354, Speaker A: 14 years in late 2007. Yeah. Good run, Cheryl. Honestly, way to get out at the top. Same with Jeff Bezos. No one's really giving him this credit.
00:22:23.472 - 00:22:32.960, Speaker B: Well, he was out and stepped back. He's left. He came back as CEO until Jassy took over.
00:22:34.850 - 00:23:31.834, Speaker A: Yeah, it's true. All right, I want to get your guys take on so there was an announcement, not a great one from Core Mining, but it's kind of signaled some, let's say, tightness or stress in the mining sector in general. But maybe we can talk about Core a little bit because they're the largest I'm pretty sure public miner core Scientific is one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world. Warned that it may run out of cash by the end of the year and it could seek relief through bankruptcy protection. So basically they cited operational performance and liquidity has been severely impacted by the prolonged drop in the price of bitcoin and a rise in electricity costs and competition and litigation with bankruptcy Celsius Network. So they basically submitted this with the Security and Exchange Commission shares of course Scientific have plunged as much as 77%, which is the largest decline since going public with the merger. Basically they've tried a whole bunch of different ways to raise capital.
00:23:31.834 - 00:24:06.250, Speaker A: They've done a couple of debt offerings but they also have tried to raise capital through equity. So they entered into 100 million dollar common stock purchase agreement with B Riley Principal Capital Partners in July. And then I guess the last thing that I'll say is they warned that they won't be able to make payments that are coming due in late October and early November with respect to several equipment and other financings. So at the time of recording this, it is October 27. So we are definitively in late October. So basically they're defaulting on their debts.
00:24:07.070 - 00:24:09.260, Speaker B: Listen, what do you guys.
00:24:12.190 - 00:24:30.834, Speaker C: First of all open the thing I just sent you thebitcointeries net. I don't know if you ever seen this, it's pretty cool. Has basically all the public mining companies and how much bitcoin they have on their balance sheet. So you obviously have if you throw it up there, you have MicroStrategy as the number one company.
00:24:30.952 - 00:24:41.320, Speaker A: Core Scientific only has 1424 as of now. They had 1000 as of a month ago. They now have 24 bitcoin on their balance sheet as of today.
00:24:42.490 - 00:25:47.434, Speaker C: So I think the order of operations, if you're a mining company and I've never run one, so this is more of a guess but you sell your bitcoin because that's your fungible asset if you get into trouble and then you have loans against your mining rigs. And I think if you think about the hierarchy of risky stuff to do with crypto lending, there's like unsecured, there's full collateralization, but there's also like I'm going to have the ability to repo your rigs if you default on this. And so I think that's kind of like where things stand with them. I know that a lot of other companies also have similar issues like Zach Vol who is a good follow on Twitter for just like bitcoin mining Insight. He said repeatedly how dire things are for basically everyone except for the absolute best managed and best run companies. This is also kind of similar to what happened in 2018 with the miners. We had the crash in January or February that year.
00:25:47.434 - 00:26:07.846, Speaker C: Things stabilized around six k, hung in there for like six months and then broke downwards to three k, right when the miners kind of like gave up the ghost in a similar style scenario but less liquidity. They had probably more bitcoin. But this is like standard operating procedure for a bear market. You kind of always have these minor white bets.
00:26:07.978 - 00:26:52.858, Speaker B: The way I think about it is it's kind of like you're starting a startup and you choose the hard path by doing something like hardware versus software. And time and time again, hardware startups get funded in bull markets. Not many of them survive multiple market cycles. Proof of work is tough. It's work. This, I think, emphasizes just the fact of proof of stake being at a core advantage to proof of work consensus, where to make it across lifecycles. To make it across market cycles, you really have to have a gross margin profile that enables you to have the flexibility and fungibility to do things that are dangerous and scalable, whereas electricity in a time of high energy costs is going to be costly.
00:26:52.954 - 00:26:56.562, Speaker C: Michael, how many new proof of work pitches have you heard in the past year?
00:26:56.616 - 00:26:59.700, Speaker B: I don't think I've heard one in the past two to three years.
00:27:01.830 - 00:27:21.850, Speaker C: It's been a long time. It's just know, I wouldn't say bitcoin mining is a thriving say. I think it kind of looked really similar to real estate to a lot of people, where it's like this income generating property. But real estate doesn't take into account that when the price drops and your costs stay the same, you might be forced to liquidate.
00:27:24.110 - 00:27:58.158, Speaker A: Just to clarify why this is a particularly stressful situation for miners. So we're looking at here is bitcoin price and hash rate. And typically those two things are pretty correlated. So we're looking like personally, I know a lot of people debate about this. I feel like price leads and then hash rate follows, right? Because hash rate is kind of a combined measure of the mining power that's being dedicated towards securing the network. So when the price goes up, people chase, just like every other commodity driven industry. But if you look at what's basically been happening since May, there's been an inversion, and as the price has fallen, the hash rate has gone up.
00:27:58.158 - 00:28:44.994, Speaker A: And that's particularly difficult because typically what happens is when the price goes down, the hash rate goes down, and then there's a difficulty adjustment which makes it more profitable for existing miners. But one of the big changes in this particular cycle is that there was an enormous amount of credit that was being given to miners. So many miners are staying online that otherwise, if they didn't have access to these credit facilities, they would have gone offline and the mining rigs would have passed into stronger hands. So the result is that it's never been less profitable to mine bitcoin than it is today. And at the same time, the other component that they're indexed to as a business, which is the price of electricity, has been skyrocketing. So that's basically what's happened right now. I think if you want to go one layer past mining, it's like you've already started.
00:28:44.994 - 00:29:08.700, Speaker A: To see stress at the firms that were extending credit here to those, I don't want to name any names, but there are a couple of big lenders, right, that have pre publicly been in trouble and laid off a whole bunch of their staff. And now they're in a tricky situation because they loaned against the Asics and most of these Asics are outdated. So that's just a painful thing that's going to have to get worked through. I don't really know what's going to happen.
00:29:09.710 - 00:29:12.506, Speaker B: One of the lessons from 2022 no leverage.
00:29:12.618 - 00:29:13.386, Speaker A: No leverage.
00:29:13.498 - 00:29:37.570, Speaker C: No leverage. No leverage. Don't do it. So I think you can ask the question very validly of was the whole not just interest rate complex but also cheap energy complex. Something that structurally encouraged proof of work businesses. And now that those economics are way different, the structure of that market will be way different as well. You'll have more concentration because you'll have economies of scale.
00:29:37.570 - 00:29:47.046, Speaker C: I think that's also a meaningful headwind on. The decentralization of bitcoin is just the price of energy. The lower it is, the more far and wide that you can spread it.
00:29:47.228 - 00:30:28.514, Speaker A: I mean, if anyone's interested my understanding of that there are multiple different business models in these miners. It's not like they all do exactly the same thing. There are some that are completely 100% vertically integrated. So they own the kind of the space, right? They own the actual rigs themselves and they make profit by mining and then eventually selling the bitcoins for a profit. And then there's kind of like cloud mining as a business model, which is you own the facility and you basically facilitate the purchase and storage of mining units that are mining rigs that are owned by different individuals. And the reason why that's coming under fire as a business model is because when it becomes unprofitable to mine, those individual people turn their miners off. But guess what? You still own the facility.
00:30:28.514 - 00:30:52.780, Speaker A: So you have these huge fixed costs that you're locked into. It's a duration mismatch, right? So you have long term fixed liabilities and your assets suck. So that usually what happens when this imbalance plays out, is that those companies go out of business. And that's what I meant by the mining rigs passing from weak to strong hands. And that's not happening because of these credit facilities this time. So I think it is going to be ugly when it gets worked out.
00:30:53.390 - 00:31:41.598, Speaker B: The one model that I have seen that seems to be at least at this point, directionally correct, potentially. If you think about what you have, at the end of the day, assuming that your profitability goes down but you're still profitable and that your assets are probably not redeemable or you're not able to actually recoup any of the value, if you've got mining rigs that go out of style or out of capability in like one to two years, the one model that I have heard of. That makes sense. Know you're buying up large swaths of property. So like the physical space to be able to do know you're talking like warehouses in Texas and you're putting your capital into the assets, the mining rigs themselves, and then you're borrowing and levering up on the real estate so that you're paying back the real estate. And then that is something that's a recoupable asset. Whereas the mining RIT is good as zero.
00:31:41.684 - 00:31:45.360, Speaker A: Have you guys ever watched the Founder? The McDonald's Ray Croc story?
00:31:46.530 - 00:31:49.566, Speaker B: It's a real estate company.
00:31:49.748 - 00:31:52.726, Speaker A: That was an awesome scene. So maiden.
00:31:52.778 - 00:32:00.210, Speaker C: Yeah. Also, while we've been talking, amazon just announced earnings and is now down 21% in the past four minutes.
00:32:00.280 - 00:32:03.300, Speaker B: Dude, so much for paying.
00:32:03.750 - 00:32:04.770, Speaker A: Brutal.
00:32:05.270 - 00:32:22.220, Speaker C: I mean, the type of market this is, is like, you announce earnings kind of one by one and the good ones are kind of left alone. But the bad ones are just like absolutely shot. These are like taking a 21% L for I think this is still a trillion dollar company.
00:32:22.990 - 00:32:30.940, Speaker A: I think so 1.13 no longer. You know what? If I could actually.
00:32:33.410 - 00:32:35.280, Speaker C: Wait, no, this is no longer.
00:32:37.970 - 00:32:48.800, Speaker A: Meta now trades at sub ten price to earnings, something like that. It's like eight and change or something like that. You want to guess what Amazon's is.
00:32:51.810 - 00:32:53.102, Speaker B: Like a zero.
00:32:53.236 - 00:32:55.280, Speaker A: 99.890.
00:33:07.610 - 00:33:19.786, Speaker C: It's like pretty bimodal, right? The good ones are like huge PE ratios. The bad ones are like basically zeros. I kind of wonder what happens to the snaps of the world. Like the Robin Hoods of the world.
00:33:19.888 - 00:33:24.574, Speaker A: This is Robin Hood stock. Since it's IPO. Actually, I've got a slightly worse one.
00:33:24.612 - 00:33:25.114, Speaker C: Blue Apron.
00:33:25.162 - 00:33:26.538, Speaker B: Oh, that actually is the worst.
00:33:26.634 - 00:33:33.886, Speaker A: No, maybe it's a little better because at least made well, they had the Echo bubble.
00:33:33.918 - 00:33:35.620, Speaker C: At least Robin Hood was.
00:33:38.470 - 00:34:04.010, Speaker B: A full one. One of the takes here that I think is actually pretty interesting is we're talking about Amazon, who obviously is a commerce business. Sleeping underneath that is AWS as well, but also a massive advertising business. And we're talking about the obliteration of the advertising based business model. You know who's the winner in all of this? It's Apple.
00:34:05.630 - 00:34:07.002, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%.
00:34:07.136 - 00:34:21.898, Speaker B: They have created their own advertising product. It hasn't scaled yet. It hasn't shown up in the earnings yet. But they've created their own ad product. It's going to be live discovery for apps. They're going to own app, install ads, essentially. And they have the keys to the kingdom.
00:34:21.898 - 00:34:34.180, Speaker B: And part of one of the things that we want to talk about today is they also came out and said, IAP is forever and we're going to maintain our 30%. And if you want to sell NFTs, you're going through us.
00:34:35.830 - 00:35:16.160, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Actually, let's just move on to Apple. But I want to get your thoughts when we end on the ETH BTC ratio and just flows between those two things. But let's talk about apple announced that they were going to be enabling NFTs. Basically NFTs in apps that were on their App Store, right? But it's subject to the same restrictions and rules that basically in app purchases are like every other inapp purchases, which is it's a 30% take rate. And the caveat to that, that they're very quick to point out is that it's only 15% if the developer is making under a million dollars or so per year.
00:35:16.160 - 00:35:37.410, Speaker A: There's a lot of discussion about royalties on NFT marketplaces, and we should probably talk about that as well. There were some changes made to Magic Eden over on Salana, but I mean, the royalties that they're talking about are far, far lower than 15, let alone 30%. So, on the one hand oh, and by the way, I should say this isn't just Apple. I'm pretty sure this applies to Android as well.
00:35:37.580 - 00:35:42.730, Speaker B: Google Play Store, not Android. You can still sideload apps via Android.
00:35:44.110 - 00:36:02.270, Speaker A: Cool. My question to you guys is, in some senses, this looks like a Web Two giant. I mean, it's the largest company in the world acknowledging NFTs. On the other hand, I guess my question to you is, how do you see this benefiting or not benefiting the ecosystem?
00:36:03.250 - 00:36:52.062, Speaker B: My take and fans may have a different perspective. My take is this is and I don't know why this is lost amongst the audience right now. This is probably one of the most bullish things to happen to crypto, like, in the last five years, because there's $100 billion of revenue. That's not just like activity or engagement. People spend $100 billion a year just in games via IAP. Imagine if you were to say, okay, let's take this massive market that we think of, which is NFTs right now, all the different drops, all the secondary marketplace transactions, and we'll get into the differentiation here, because I think there's a nuanced take. But if you were to say, okay, we're going to have $100 billion of available business that you are now, instead of selling virtual consumable goods in your game, that go away the second that you stop playing that game.
00:36:52.062 - 00:37:32.186, Speaker B: Now, you actually ascribe that to something that is recoupable as an NFT that's mintable on chain outside of the app, and you can do things with it outside of the app. That is a fundamentally massive step change in this industry. The tough parts are IFP is probably one of the most janky products ever. You have restrictive pricing on the different SKUs. If you want to change pricing, you have to literally do an update to your app, which takes weeks to review. It takes days for everybody to download, but you have to sell ninety nine cents, one ninety nine, nine ninety nine, et cetera, et cetera. You can't change that pricing.
00:37:32.186 - 00:38:05.426, Speaker B: The other thing that's going to be really interesting is you also can't change quantity. So there's no scarce aspect to the mints that you'd be performing. And I don't know how we reconcile that. That'll just be something that we have to figure out. Maybe the industry gets big enough or there's some middleware that can step in to do that, fix that. But frankly, this is one of the most bullish scenes ever, the 15 30%, whatever. The fact that Apple is enabling this, developers who want to integrate NFTs are going to make far more than they would have without IP.
00:38:05.538 - 00:38:46.174, Speaker A: So I just want to point out there are a couple more restrictions. And Michael Advance, maybe you guys think this is a big deal, or maybe it's not, but apps cannot have external links or buttons that take customers away from the App Store to facilitate purchases. So, for instance, like OpenSea auctions, right? This would decidedly not be good for their business. All related transactions have to be denominated in USD, not digital assets, which I actually feel like is not insignificant, at least for the core crypto users now, who probably denominate a lot of their NFTs in ETH, which is certainly less painful in a bear market. That's a better way to do mean, I'd be curious if you think either of those two things, if that changes your mind, Michael.
00:38:46.302 - 00:39:24.400, Speaker B: Those are things that are just going to have to get litigated, basically. So the point about non linking, apple already lost a court case with Epic Games saying that it cannot not I don't know how Apple is putting this in writing right now, because that runs completely in the face of the court ruling that happened. So I would kind of like negate that point because I don't think they'll actually be able to enforce that the point of not having the ability to. So here's how I think it's going to work. You're going to have an application where, let's say 90% of the people don't even know that they're interacting with NFTs. They're just playing a game. They're playing the app, they're using the app, whatever.
00:39:24.400 - 00:40:27.374, Speaker B: 10% of the people will actually care about the NFT, and primary sales only will happen in the App Store, in the app itself. If you want to pull that NFT off platform and bring into Openc, bring it into some other ecosystem, sell it, borrow against it, whatever you want to do with that NFT, that's going to happen in the mobile web or the desktop web, that's not going to happen in App. So like the secondary marketplace not going to be possible. What could get really interesting so what Apple says is you can only make purchases with IAP if you're paying fiat, if you're paying dollars. What they also say is that if you are a permitted exchange, you can transact in virtual currencies, in cryptocurrencies. What might be interesting here is if you have a custodial wallet experience, let's say, like Coinbase, if you were to then go and say, I loaded it up with ETH, which I can purchase in App right now, and then I use ETH to make all these purchases in the secondary marketplace that actually may get around IAP. But all of this is like, TBD.
00:40:27.374 - 00:40:34.566, Speaker B: There are zero apps that actually integrate NFTs right now in the way that we're talking about using IAP. So we're just going to have to see what happens.
00:40:34.668 - 00:40:58.462, Speaker C: Yep. Also, I would say just taking the worst case scenario of them basically banning us off the like that's so positive because before there's formal guidelines and the guidelines work on, they make them and then they iterate like if they come out super negative, there's basically no room to maneuver. But now that there's a relatively positive framework, it feels like an olive branch and the industry can actually work with them.
00:40:58.516 - 00:41:37.850, Speaker A: Well, Apple wasn't the only one. There was also, like Reddit news this past week. So Reddit this also kind of got slept on as news. But basically back in July, Reddit announced that an 86,000 NFT avatar collection is not NFTs, it's digital collectibles. And they announced that they were going to have their own NFT trading marketplace. So basically you could mint these things on I think their back end was on polygon, which is how it worked. And last week Reddit revealed that they onboarded over 3 million wallets and they minted over 86,000 NFTs since July.
00:41:37.850 - 00:42:03.214, Speaker A: Now, I think what's been pointed out is a lot of these people probably don't fully understand what they're calling it, a digital collectible. It's not on like OpenSea or anything like that. So the experience feels much less crypto native. But I kind of am like, who cares? But who cares about that? I don't even understand why that's important, actually. So that's a lot. That's a big 3 million. It's non trivial.
00:42:03.214 - 00:42:04.898, Speaker A: I don't know what you guys think about that.
00:42:05.064 - 00:43:03.190, Speaker C: This is going to be a feeling that happens a lot over the next two years. Crypto Twitter is not going to be the first circle that's in the know of something that's happening with Normies, and it's going to kind of get semi derided as the Reddit NFTs kind of were. But I think that is such a good sign that the thesis that we have, which is like games and NFTs and whatever else, it's not happening, but it's starting to play out. And so yeah, I mean, anything that onboards people, it's super positive. Reddit messing around on polygon is great. I think the question is how do you convert the people that have come in the normies that now have NFTs into people that are using DeFi and doing other stuff on chain and downloading MetaMask onboarding and then kind of bringing them into the inner sanctum of crypto Twitter and crypto culture and everything writ large? That's kind of like the secret sauce that we now need to figure out.
00:43:03.260 - 00:43:57.560, Speaker B: And I mean, frankly, it could be fake, but it does feel like it's the narrative or it's the sentiment right now is it was a post of someone's DM that they got sent, which was in the Twitter byline of this person who sent the DM was basically like, I don't believe in NFTs, they're all a scam. And then the message was, hey, I just downloaded the reddit NFT. How do I check to see how much it's worth? The point is, I think ultimately it's going to be the same thing that frankly got most of DeFi in, I think, which is like speculation, broods, excitement and attention. And I think you're ultimately going to see that be the tip of the iceberg. And then it's going to be like a snowball rolling downhill where you're just like, okay, now I got DeFi, now I got MetaMask, now I get, well, what else can I do? That's the journey that I think a lot of us went down and I think it's just going to happen the same way.
00:43:59.130 - 00:44:35.694, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny, just because we're in media, we get asked a lot and my perspective has kind of changed about this over the years. Like, how do you onboard people? And if you ask people, what they'll say is, it all sounds so technical, it's just so foreign and I don't want to understand it. So I used to think that was the barrier and it was like, oh, if we could just talk. And I just don't believe that's true. And I think the best way for people to become enthusiastic and get involved is like someone gives you some bitcoin or ETH and it goes up and you're like, suddenly this feels a lot less scammy. Doesn't feel so scamming anymore.
00:44:35.742 - 00:44:39.110, Speaker B: It's really tough to use. Okay, here's $100. Now is it tough?
00:44:40.890 - 00:44:47.350, Speaker A: Oh, now it's $500. Maybe there's something here. Actually. I didn't look at it before. It's just funny.
00:44:48.970 - 00:45:25.906, Speaker C: How do we get them in games? NFTs loyalty points, blocking, attacking BD for the most part, I would call that how do we get them to stay here? I think it's kind of like the technology moments that I remember from my life are like getting on Facebook, using Instagram, at least like the early years in college. But basically after that, after college, the only transformative technology experience that I've had is using Ethereum, sending a transaction, having it hit instantly, being able to do different stuff, like the feel of the hardware wallet. I really do think it's about abstraction, but it's also about got to put.
00:45:25.928 - 00:45:46.860, Speaker B: Them on chain condition. Part of what I was saying, I think speculation is literally the tip of the iceberg. That's just enough of an activation energy to get people to do something. But I think the second that you actually start to understand what decentralized technology in the face of Meta, in the face of Snap writ large can provide, I think that's where you actually get people to stay.
00:45:48.430 - 00:46:27.206, Speaker A: There's a talk that a guy named Josh Rosenthal gives that I find extremely compelling as a very high level way of thinking about this. He gave it a permissionless. He's done it on Empire and Bankless and a couple of other podcasts. But the analogy that he uses is if you were like a feudal serf, right, and you're living on land that's owned by someone else, you do work that is the fruits of your labor goes towards someone else. And someone from this time tried to go back and say, hey, man, how do you deal with this? Like, you're not free. He'd be like, what do you mean I'm not free? You have such little understanding. And now we also everything that you produce in an online setting is not owned by you.
00:46:27.206 - 00:46:53.406, Speaker A: Right? Just as an example, if anyone wants to I tried to recently pull some old photos and whatnot off Facebook, because I was just like, should probably do that and just try to see how hard it is to do that. Just watch how hard it is to just limit the views of your own old Facebook. Uploads from middle school, I was just like, these can't be on the internet, man. But yeah, you just own so little and you see so little of the.
00:46:53.428 - 00:46:54.542, Speaker B: Compared what photos you got.
00:46:54.596 - 00:47:05.670, Speaker A: I think no photos. Don't need to check, brother. Don't worry. Yeah. Nothing that's going to get me canceled. But I definitely don't need everyone digging around my Facebook.
00:47:07.050 - 00:47:09.094, Speaker C: Yeah, we'd hate to deplatform you.
00:47:09.132 - 00:47:14.600, Speaker A: I know one platform that'll still got some I got some pull on one platform still.
00:47:16.650 - 00:47:24.890, Speaker B: Everyone josh is and I love that speech that he gives. It's so true. It's a great analogy.
00:47:26.030 - 00:48:24.586, Speaker A: Yeah, I've got a just on the theme of speculation, I'm trying to think about this because Aptos and Sui are launching and I have no particular opinion. I've actually heard from some pretty smart people that I respect a lot that there's something there from a tech perspective. I can't diligence that. I will make the observation that extremely high valuation l ones launch at the end of bull markets basically never work. And I would posit that the reason why that is is because the distribution mechanism in Crypto is you start at a low valuation, a bunch of retail people buy in, they become very wealthy, and then they scream about your product for everyone to hear. And it's a very viral kind of distribution mechanism. And that's why I think you've seen less I don't mean this against VCs in general, but less super VC heavy chains as opposed to more retail, organic driven funded chains from the beginning.
00:48:24.586 - 00:48:29.678, Speaker A: Maybe outperform a little bit better. I'd be curious what you guys think about that.
00:48:29.844 - 00:49:17.194, Speaker C: They also have this the first bear market after your parabolic blow off top as a base layer in terms of the asset, that's when you have all the VCs unlocking. So there's no magic property which says this one is better than the other. A lot of it is just like flows and those are set on the margin of who is the biggest structural seller or buyer. And you're just going through probably four years of supply unlock. And most of this concentrated at, I would guess, of all the chains and all the supply schedules that I've seen at the kind of front end of the bear market. But you just have this especially because it's at a higher dollar value, because it's all marked and trading higher. But you just kind of have this relentless pressure on a lot of these assets.
00:49:17.194 - 00:49:30.100, Speaker C: But I think what is the good news for the tokens that have a lot of cash flow, that also have a lot of token emissions or supply unlocking from VCs? It's going to be this weakest point.
00:49:32.790 - 00:50:21.986, Speaker B: I'm invested in a venture fund that has invested in both Mist in Labs and Aptos, and they invested at an earlier evaluation and they bought equity. And the way that they marked their books and this is sort of like one of the traditional, traditional perspective, let's quote unquote, Silicon Valley venture capitalist. The way that they view this investment and the way that they're marketing on their books is that they own equity in the company, which has gone up since there was a subsequent raise. It's gone up 1.8 X from the original raise that they've had. They also own millions of Aptos tokens which they literally do not even count in their portfolio valuation. The value of the equity has gone up 1.8
00:50:21.986 - 00:50:54.800, Speaker B: X and is legitimately 5% the size of the value of the tokens that they hold at current market cap valuation with Aptos tokens. But that perspective, I think, pervades how traditional venture capitalists think about these assets. And so what do you think is going to happen the second that they have this asset that is liquid, that they can actually recoup value on in their illiquid venture portfolio, they're going to sell it. And I think this is where the traditional Silicon Valley VC perspective is almost like a red stain on any cap table. In my mind.
00:50:58.210 - 00:51:03.700, Speaker A: I tend to agree with that. So they almost treat it like an option. It's basically a free option, call option.
00:51:04.230 - 00:51:13.490, Speaker B: The entire Aptos token has returned the value of it right now, has returned the entire fund, yet they don't even account it in their TVPI.
00:51:16.330 - 00:51:51.230, Speaker A: That's pretty wonky. That's pretty wild. I agree with you. There are obviously good and bad actors in every set of people. I'm sure there are. I definitely can think of some good, more traditional VCs off the top of my head, but definitely there are a lot of ones that aren't as, I don't know, aligned. And I don't know, as a founder, if I was faced with the prospect of taking capital, it would be I've always been like, Why? Who cares about a blue chip at the end of the day? That's such a vanity metric.
00:51:51.230 - 00:51:57.522, Speaker A: I think the much more important thing is, do you have people that you agree with? Are you aligned with them? You trust these people?
00:51:57.656 - 00:52:24.794, Speaker B: I don't know. There is a bit more nuance to this, which is there is a structural difference where technically venture capital funds cannot hold tokens. And so there is a reason why this has been the case. You saw Andreessen be the first one to do this register as an investment advisor with the SEC framework is an RAA with the SEC. All the funds in crypto are because it does take a structural difference. So there is an element of that to it as well.
00:52:24.992 - 00:52:58.950, Speaker C: To your point, Mike, Venture is a relationship business. We've talked about this a little bit, but I don't think it scales to billions of dollars every year or two, especially when you're in a small subsector like crypto. And it's all about just being aligned with the people that are investing in you, having them be someone who's not just capital, and there's very little to do with the reputation of the firm. It's just like, who are you working with? Who is the like, do you get Michael and Vance or do you get somebody else? And I think that's the real difference maker.
00:53:02.410 - 00:53:50.594, Speaker A: I remember having a conversation with Jason. Do you guys remember a little while ago when sue, before he was crypto's number one villain, he was going back and forth Kane online, and he kind of dunked on Kane. And I actually remember I can't even really remember what it was anymore, but I remember having a little bit of sympathy for his argument. But I remember talking to Jason Be like, I would never take money from that guy, never in a million years, because that told me he viewed himself more as a trader than as a VC, because I don't know, maybe other founders who are listening to this have had different experiences. Most of the hard times about Blockworks have been like emotional times, but this person wants to leave or they want more money, and I don't know what to do. And you just want someone that you can call man. Sometimes you just need to vent.
00:53:50.722 - 00:53:53.400, Speaker C: 90% of everything else is just that.
00:53:54.730 - 00:54:04.650, Speaker A: Yeah. I bet you guys feel like kind of therapist some of the time. Like it is. You just got to listen and provide a helper. But that's valuable.
00:54:07.630 - 00:54:48.520, Speaker B: I like to say Vance and I did a startup prior to this, and one of the lines that we didn't come up with but kind of resonates is like, our friendship was formed in the crucible of a dysfunctional startup. And that is kind of true in a lot of ways without having that experience. And I'm sure you and Yano feel the same way. Without having that, you can't really advise. You can't be like, oh, I remember when or, I've seen this before, and it's just not authentic. And I think to the point about sue every single market cycle we've been through, and this is the third one so far. Every single time, there is a grifter class of people masquerading as venture firms that should not be doing so.
00:54:48.520 - 00:55:17.810, Speaker B: Way back in the ICO days, it was 2017, 2018. It was the liquid funds who were literally getting tokens and selling on market. The second that they were liquid. This time, maybe it's Kyle and sue who are originally FX traders that started venture funds on the side for fun. Who will it be again the next time? We don't know. But once again, you have to find partners that you can trust and work with. And that, I think, is a resounding truth across market cycles.
00:55:19.510 - 00:55:21.346, Speaker A: 100%, all the.
00:55:21.368 - 00:55:36.440, Speaker C: Best firms, at least on the investing side, have two people, obviously, Michael and myself. But like Fred and Matt, Chris and Joel, Kyle and Tushar. I'm trying to think of the other examples. Ben and Mark.
00:55:37.530 - 00:55:40.982, Speaker A: Chris and Joel. Ben and mark the placeholder.
00:55:41.126 - 00:55:44.890, Speaker C: Yeah. It's valuable to have a partner.
00:55:45.310 - 00:56:06.660, Speaker A: 100%. I actually sometimes look at the sole single founders, and I'm always like, how do you do it, man? How do you do it? Because there have been so many days where it's like, I feel like everything is going wrong and nothing is right. And Jason and I will just call each other, be like, Dude, it was a week. And he'll be like, It was a week. Yeah.
00:56:10.470 - 00:56:12.274, Speaker C: The single founder energy is different.
00:56:12.312 - 00:56:13.220, Speaker A: 100%.
00:56:14.230 - 00:56:18.260, Speaker C: It's just like, one guy. Does he have it?
00:56:18.950 - 00:56:33.900, Speaker B: I would wait, we have back single founders, but the first post investment conversation is like, okay, who are you hiring as your number two? Who's going to be that person? Why aren't you talking with recruiters right now? When is this person coming in? When can I interview them? That's step one.
00:56:34.910 - 00:56:57.182, Speaker A: Yeah. 100%. And I think you have to be very cognizant of what your strengths and weaknesses are. Actually, there's a woman, our COO, Julie Miroff, who's, like, I would say she was a super critical hire. It's one of the best ones we've ever made. She's just like Jason and I. You can probably tell, I think we're not exactly like this.
00:56:57.182 - 00:57:18.554, Speaker A: Julie's like a hard charging bulldog operator who's like, you just want to have on your team. So I gotta give Jules a shout out here. She's a legend. Yeah, she's a legend. All right, guys, I want to get your take here. I know we're running low on time. We're talking about so this is a story from last week, but we didn't get to cover it because we didn't do the show.
00:57:18.554 - 00:58:05.142, Speaker A: So SBF basically posted his overview of what he would like to see from a regulatory standpoint. And there were a whole bunch of different angles that he sort of covered a lot of. It was basically how the most important part that I want to get your guys take on is how DeFi would. Sort of be regulated. So I think there was a clause that he got a lot of pushback on, which was he kind of maintained the idea that the DeFi protocols, the back end would be uncensored, right, and basically largely unregulated, but that the front ends would be regulated as broker dealers. Right. So the distinction there being between uniswap the back end and then versus the front end.
00:58:05.142 - 00:58:44.930, Speaker A: So I think the pushback that he got was it creates an enormous amount of regulatory burden on anyone that would just want to connect to one of these things. And it's also this is software, right. There are very different, I think in a lot of senses it doesn't make sense to regulate these things as broker dealers. And the criticism was it's kind of self dealing, right. Basically it lessens his competition as DeFi and probably makes it so that we're all trading on centralized exchanges in three to five years time. How did you guys I'll present the steelman for the other side of that, but how do you guys interpret SBF's outline?
00:58:46.790 - 00:59:55.418, Speaker C: So I think one of the main things about the bill that's a little bit lost in the noise is that if you look at something like DeFi yes, it's about the front ends, it's about the backends. But it's also about preserving the economic opportunity for consumers and making sure that they are able to transact on these digital goods and services in a way that's very efficient. So buried in the Dccpa was this language that we originally found I don't think really, but anybody else was paying attention to this, that says if you want to go yield, farm, or liquidity provide, you're dealing in a digital commodity. We've expanded the definition of a commodity pool operator to include digital commodities. And so therefore, you might need to go register with the CFTC, even if you're some hobbyist at home that wants to stake or swap or liquidity provide or do any of the things that really kind of represent the actual functionality of crypto and protecting the developers and then keeping the economic opportunity open for the consumers is basically the platform that we have. And with legislation, you're not going to get like 1000 shots. We're not going to get a year or two to basically come up with our best ideas, have a POW wow, make everybody feel good, and then put them all in there.
00:59:55.418 - 01:00:19.266, Speaker C: This is kind of how the process runs, where it might get put into an omnibus bill. It's kind of like the Congress and Senate might change over at the end of the year. There's going to be kind of this rush towards these deadlines and that's kind of the scenario that we're going to find ourselves in, regardless of which legislation eventually passes. Are we definitely pro regulation? Absolutely. We want regulation that makes sense. Dccpa needs changes. It's possible it gets there.
01:00:19.266 - 01:00:49.930, Speaker C: It's also possible it just doesn't. So you know, I'm looking for what the language is in the bill. I'm not really paying attention too much about the Kabuki theater of like oh, we didn't know this language might do that. At this level there basically just are no mistakes and so I don't really believe that. And yeah, so if it comes back and it's positive we're going to be in favor but if it comes back and it's negative, we're just not. And I think there is a lot of room in a grassroots movement that legislation like this should make sense eventually.
01:00:50.590 - 01:01:53.966, Speaker B: But yeah, the way I liken this is kind of like we were talking about with know it's not going to be perfect and Apple's going to want their cut and what they put out maybe isn't what Apple put out in the guidelines this week isn't perfect. It doesn't align directionally with what a lot of people wanted. But it at least gives us a playbook that we'd start operating under now and we could define products and categories that will be able to abide by that. The other thing I'll say is with any of this regulation and yes, everybody loves to hate on the SEC, maybe CFTC is now under the guise of being hated on by crypto Twitter. The intention of this and the intention of all of these rules is to create fair and equitable even markets. And we've seen fraud, we've seen things get out of hand. The whole Three Arrows Capital situation is something that literally the SEC and other regulatory bodies are there to protect against.
01:01:53.966 - 01:02:24.486, Speaker B: And defining fair and even rules I think is actually one of the most bullish things that could happen for this industry. But to Vance's point, if it's not going to be that and it's draconian in nature and it's basically just like screw DeFi, it's not going to be something that's workable. And how do you get a protocol to register? How do you get a protocol to become a broker dealer or have a KYC into the protocol itself? It just can't happen. So there needs to be a meeting in the middle somewhere.
01:02:24.518 - 01:03:04.566, Speaker A: I think I would agree with know at the end of the day I don't think the US wants to because the opponents of DeFi and crypto writ large have always kind of said something to the effect of well this isn't truly anonymous because the government can send people to your house and throw you in jail. And it's like that's true. But I also don't really believe that the government wants to do that. They don't want to be taking draconian action against something that is popular. So I think that is the and I credit to Melton Demurus who's been talking about this for as long as I've been in crypto. Crypto has to win hearts and minds I think. And that's still a challenge that I think we're working on.
01:03:04.566 - 01:03:07.782, Speaker A: But I think those we're working on it.
01:03:07.836 - 01:03:09.980, Speaker B: We did ourselves a disservice this year.
01:03:11.150 - 01:03:12.618, Speaker A: I agree with you.
01:03:12.784 - 01:03:49.702, Speaker C: Yeah. Next year needs to be better. The only reason why we tweet about this stuff and why we actually get louder about our perspectives on Dccpa is because the wrong regulation, to Michael's point can be catastrophic. And it's going to kind of be run in this hurry up offense style, where you need to mobilize and talk about the issues and hash out how everyone feels in almost real time. And we're very lucky that Twitter allows us to do that. But the message needs to be very clear that basically everything is DeFi. Every use case is financialized to some extent or another.
01:03:49.702 - 01:04:08.218, Speaker C: And so if you want to ban that, you're kind of banning everything, and people might say, why not have it be the token? Be a security or a commodity? It's like, you want to go hold your tokens in your Charles Schwab account and use them in Fidelity's wallet. That doesn't sound like the future that.
01:04:08.224 - 01:04:18.862, Speaker B: We want to that point. I completely agree. The other thing I'll say, too, is there are a lot of entrepreneurs that we work with who still have the perspective of, like, I want to get the US.
01:04:18.916 - 01:04:19.566, Speaker A: Market.
01:04:19.748 - 01:04:47.030, Speaker B: But getting the market in the US. Which is arguably one of the biggest that you could go after, is going to require some capitulation on regulatory fronts. Mostly it comes down to KYC and probably open standards of how you're managing assets. But if we can find a way for a decentralized protocol or even a UI to do KYC that's decentralized in nature, I'm all ears, because that would be a huge boon for the industry.
01:04:48.570 - 01:05:19.838, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm with you on that. I'm obviously on the side of crypto. I suppose if I was sitting at one of these agencies, what we're trying to say right, is exactly what you were saying, Vance. Like, the economic opportunity and freedom is, like, enormous boon to consumers. And I get some people are super cynical about regulators in the government. I'm not as cynical as other people. I generally think they're good people trying to do their job, but I can see how they would hear, like, hey, we just wanted to be able to transact with anyone in total privacy with no accountability.
01:05:19.838 - 01:05:47.814, Speaker A: And I'm unwilling to hear anything. And it's kind of like, okay, a middle ground needs to be found. We have to come to the table with at least something, right? Like, okay, if you don't like this proposal, tell me how it should be. Know, if I was working at the Blockchain Association or Coin Center, I'd be saying, yeah, we do do that. So this is know, bi weekly appreciation post for those guys because they're literally advocating for our entire industry. So props to those guys and gals.
01:05:47.942 - 01:05:52.960, Speaker C: They're great. We're donors. We love them.
01:05:54.130 - 01:06:01.120, Speaker A: Guys, any memes of the week, I guess, to close us off? I mean, there's one obvious one.
01:06:04.070 - 01:06:06.734, Speaker C: Elon. Which one Elon?
01:06:06.782 - 01:06:09.650, Speaker A: Dude, he goes into Twitter with a sink.
01:06:10.310 - 01:06:17.590, Speaker B: Someone had the best response, which was, just imagine the assistant that had to go off and buy a sink for Elon.
01:06:21.130 - 01:06:26.258, Speaker C: His laugh in that video is like, oh, man, he's in for some trouble.
01:06:26.354 - 01:06:30.486, Speaker A: Yeah. And he looks like he's wrecked shit.
01:06:30.518 - 01:06:34.886, Speaker C: Like, I thought he was going to drop that sink off the roof or something. I didn't fully get why he throws.
01:06:34.918 - 01:06:36.010, Speaker B: Him out with the kitchen.
01:06:38.510 - 01:06:48.186, Speaker A: Yeah, because he's going to fire 75%. So this is a man who's about to chop 75% of the headcount and just giggling like a I fully expected.
01:06:48.218 - 01:06:51.310, Speaker B: Him to just show up with a paintball gun re gold style.
01:06:53.590 - 01:07:06.294, Speaker A: I think we just watched the real World version of that, by the way. I think we just watched I'm so happy he's yeah. Do you think he solves the bot problem?
01:07:06.412 - 01:07:08.120, Speaker B: I think that's his first week.
01:07:09.530 - 01:07:11.638, Speaker C: Yeah. Really?
01:07:11.724 - 01:07:13.480, Speaker A: Two very different responses there.
01:07:14.490 - 01:07:14.950, Speaker C: Okay.
01:07:15.020 - 01:07:48.314, Speaker B: Think about the narrative win that that would be. And he's getting so much negative press around this. Even his investors are trying to back out because he's at the $44 billion mark. If he can solve that problem, that's the highest leverage thing with probably not the most difficult implementation of but think about it. The reason why they haven't been able to do this, it's not because of a technical issue. It's because they've been publicly traded. And so the second that your active user base goes down 40% or 50%, whatever the percentage is, the second that happens, quarter over quarter, you're screwed.
01:07:48.314 - 01:07:53.890, Speaker B: You have 20%. Looks like child's play at that point. But now that it's private, who gives a shit?
01:07:59.450 - 01:08:30.250, Speaker A: You guys ever watch Succession? Yes. Do you know when Kendall inherits the company in the first season, they take him up to the roof and they're like, so there's a debt problem. The whole company's like levered to the tits. Do you think that when the new Twitter CEO got in, they were like, so, buddy, about those user numbers? Or do you think it's like everyone knows that? Because I was kind of just assuming it's at least 50% bots or something. But do you think everyone assumes that or will we all be shocked?
01:08:30.330 - 01:08:54.886, Speaker C: There's definitely some skeleton there's like user mismanagement skeletons in all of these big tech companies closets. I don't think it's just a Twitter problem. I think it's probably like a OG, actually. For sure. Instagram as well. Problem. But I would not be surprised to see Elon announce something about his official number of bots that he's found and his plan to eradicate them.
01:08:54.886 - 01:09:19.150, Speaker C: I think that has to be one of the first things that he at least tries to do, taking control of the company. I'm actually pretty bullish on him being able to turn this around if his whole vision comes true. Tesla, SpaceX Starlink X.com, the app. This is going to be pretty powerful, so I definitely would not fade him. He's also the world's richest man and just doesn't give basically a fuck about what anybody thinks.
01:09:19.730 - 01:09:25.620, Speaker B: That's a very billion dollar nominate. Because he said he wanted to on Twitter and couldn't back out.
01:09:28.230 - 01:09:31.170, Speaker C: He literally just slipped out. And then he owed $44 billion.
01:09:31.240 - 01:09:32.050, Speaker A: Oops.
01:09:33.190 - 01:09:43.794, Speaker C: Yeah. I would assume he settled so that nobody else gets to read whatever else was in his phone or stuff like that. It felt like he just made a mistake.
01:09:43.842 - 01:10:05.182, Speaker A: He's like, I don't do it. You know what the funny part about so that's like, when you go out to a dinner and it's like three times as much as you thought, you're like, oh, that sucks. That's basically what he did. But with 44 billion and he could absorb it, he's like, oh, that hurts. But it's not the end of the world. Just 44 at 250. Yeah, he's a bold guy.
01:10:05.182 - 01:10:09.630, Speaker A: I agree with you. I mean, he's a good operator, obviously, so it'll be interesting to see.
01:10:09.700 - 01:10:29.430, Speaker B: What do you so I'm sure you guys know this, but maybe not everybody does. He bought Tesla. He didn't start it. And so he has done this before. Obviously hasn't done this at the scale, but this is not like a new thing for him. I think he'll be able to do well. I do think this will be a new type of challenge.
01:10:29.430 - 01:10:40.534, Speaker B: Know massively publicly traded company with a bunch of skeletons, as we're describing, but he's going to get a couple of early narrative wins and basically just have the buy in at that point to kind of do what he wants.
01:10:40.732 - 01:11:03.040, Speaker A: I think the know, people love to indict Elon Musk, but the Know check in the pro category for him is when he made all that money from X.com or whatever it was, what did he choose to do? He could easily roll that into another Internet startup, right? Everyone would have backed him. He could have easily made a bunch of money doing what did he do? He started an electric car company and a space.
01:11:06.550 - 01:11:46.800, Speaker B: So he made something like $130,000,000 let's call it number is probably around there, but put $100 million into Create SpaceX, which started off by buying a $20 million ICBM rocket from Russia, which ultimately didn't work or do anything, and then he put something like 28 or 29 million into to buy Tesla. He started off by investing, and then he ultimately bought the founders out and then put $1 million into something else and then literally had to borrow money for rent. Like you go from $130 million, like sleeping on couches. That's the type of person, in his mindset, that he operates under.
01:11:49.260 - 01:11:57.848, Speaker A: It's pretty extraordinary. It's pretty extraordinary. All right, fellas, I think that's all the time we have. So I'll wrap it, but see you same time next week.
01:11:57.934 - 01:11:58.310, Speaker B: See you then.
