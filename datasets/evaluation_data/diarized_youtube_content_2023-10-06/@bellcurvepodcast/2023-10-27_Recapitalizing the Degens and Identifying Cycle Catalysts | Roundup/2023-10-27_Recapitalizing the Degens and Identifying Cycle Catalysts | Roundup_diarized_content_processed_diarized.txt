00:00:24.890 - 00:00:50.826, Speaker A: It all right, everyone. We will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of crypto. Goldman, JPMorgan, Zero, 72, all in one room. So you can know what the big money is doing. So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage and use Bell 20 for 20% off.
00:00:50.826 - 00:01:03.274, Speaker A: And I will see you in sunny London town in March. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got Vance and Michael just separating the wheat from the chaff here. What's going on, budy?
00:01:03.322 - 00:01:11.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I got a little bit of like a crazy lighting thing here, so if I change colors midway through the broadcast, just know that I'm not fake tanning or anything.
00:01:12.024 - 00:01:16.098, Speaker A: Adding some definition to the lettuce that you're working with up there.
00:01:16.264 - 00:01:29.730, Speaker B: Bull markets. I usually grow it out, so I think we're on the start of that. And usually my front hair, I can pull it down to my chin right now. It's like, to my forehead. So we're getting there slowly but surely.
00:01:29.890 - 00:01:49.962, Speaker A: We did a little our first bull post about Das London. Got these speakers locked in all this stuff, trying to get the people riled up, and I think most of the comments were about your, like, come on, having baby ETF. We got all the institutions in the room and it's like, Vance's, hair grow out your hair.
00:01:50.026 - 00:01:52.480, Speaker B: No shampoo. Next question.
00:01:53.570 - 00:02:02.514, Speaker A: The shampoo industry. A, it's a scam. That was a life changing thing to not use as much. I shampooed every single day for most of my life.
00:02:02.632 - 00:02:02.962, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:03.016 - 00:02:03.826, Speaker A: Which is nuts. Yeah.
00:02:03.848 - 00:02:07.730, Speaker B: Bleaching your hair every day is not a great solution for hair longevity.
00:02:07.890 - 00:02:09.126, Speaker A: No, it is not.
00:02:09.308 - 00:02:26.634, Speaker B: Don't do it. I did know a guy that would do a tablespoon of honey in his hair that was like the most unhinged. That's where I got off. What the sole bra camp at this point? But each his own.
00:02:26.832 - 00:02:37.710, Speaker A: You know what, actually I've heard too, is beer. Like a can of beer in the hair. There's something wheat. I don't know, it feels a little natural suds up there in the shower.
00:02:38.850 - 00:02:43.650, Speaker B: Yeah. The last time I dumped a beer on my head was probably in college, so I think we'll leave it there.
00:02:43.800 - 00:03:15.894, Speaker A: Yeah, this is why the people tune into the Bell Curve for the hair care advice and products. Hair tips. Yeah. Let's start with this question, Vance. Are we back, baby? Is it so over? Are we so back? Joking aside, last week, obviously very good price action for bitcoin. We got a little bit of a teaser with the bitcoin ETF. The Ishares ticker IBTC appeared on the DTCC registry, then it was off and then suddenly it's been there since August.
00:03:15.894 - 00:03:21.174, Speaker A: But there was felt like a little bit of FOMO or potentially front running the bitcoin ETF.
00:03:21.222 - 00:04:09.420, Speaker B: So what do you mean? I think beyond are we back, are we not back, whatever. There's just been a lot of real work that's been done in crypto over the past 18 months since the Luna collapse, and I guess FTX is a year ago, but you have T bills coming on chain. I think synthetics might hit a billion of volume today. You have dYdX, that change has shipped as well. Makers reversed the decline in stablecoins and now it's going back up. Lido has gained a lot of market share, games are launching at the end of the year, and then you have kind of like the institutions have finally adopted this with Larry Fink on, you know, Shilling bitcoin. So a lot of work has been done and I think it's laying the groundwork for us coming back.
00:04:09.420 - 00:05:04.286, Speaker B: Things have randomly doubled. It felt like at least in the, you know, a lot of that stuff just doesn't feel too out of left field if these things are really generating revenue and generating traction. So I think in the next couple of years you're probably looking at bull market when it starts and when it stops, who knows? That's anybody's guess. But we're at the back end of a rate hiking cycle and crypto is decorrelating exactly the time that you would hope it would. Amidst all this geopolitical uncertainty, amidst all this high debt load, the high deficits, the narratives couldn't be much better for crypto. And it's not about whether you're at zero rates or 5%, it's about what's the direction of travel and what's the rate of change. And we just have a lot to work with.
00:05:04.286 - 00:05:26.850, Speaker B: So I think it's time to be pretty optimistic and you're going to get we did a retrospective on 2021, there were eight pullbacks of 30% and each of those was a pretty incredible opportunity. And so that's at least where our head is at, is just continuing to accumulate high quality assets.
00:05:27.270 - 00:06:16.766, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's always tough to call when that exact moment is. The way I was thinking about it this week is you've had a lot of headwinds shift to tailwinds. So I think one of the most difficult things when the market starts to turn like it did at the end of 2021 is all right, crypto is still exciting, obviously have a very long term perspective and mindset on it, but, man, does it feel like a lot of stuff is going against us for a really long time. So you had the regulatory stuff, you have the four year cycle in the back of your head, so you're like, damn, I got two years ahead of me. The next obvious catalyst would be the having and rear rates are just moving against me. But I feel like a lot of that has changed with a now the having is within basically spitting distance. You've got an ishares like a BlackRock ETF filing.
00:06:16.766 - 00:06:47.790, Speaker A: You've got Larry Fink going on CNBC like we've talked about quite a bit, and actually I think real rates are moving in the right direction. So you've had a lot of people on the macro side of things talking about you can get two and a half percent real rates in tips, which is a really good deal. Now the thinking goes, okay, it's probably not going to get much better than this. It's probably going to move in the opposite direction, which is good for bitcoin, good for crypto. So we like, a lot of those tailwinds that we had have just headwinds have shifted to tailwinds.
00:06:48.210 - 00:07:29.466, Speaker B: So I had two funny anecdotes to your points walking around New York the past couple of weeks. The first was I was in the West Village and this guy was you like, he's on this phone, he's on a phone call. He's like, all right, so you download and do you have money in there? Okay, what do you think? He's trying to onboard someone? And it was the day that bitcoin popped, and so there's this frantic scramble for get the app downloaded and get on coinbase. I thought that was pretty funny. I just haven't heard that in, I guess it's been almost two years. Wow, can't believe it's been that long. I know.
00:07:29.466 - 00:08:11.378, Speaker B: The other one was I was at this dinner with this Wall Street I think you were at this dinner? And he was like, you should put the whole fund into long bonds. I was like, okay, well, how much would I make if I did that? And he's like, if rates go from 5% to 3% to 2%, you're going to make 30%. I was like, that is just not interesting at all. Well, you can lever it up. I was like, oh, now we're talking. But you could be liquidated. So it doesn't really make a lot of sense in my mind for those trades.
00:08:11.378 - 00:08:25.934, Speaker B: You make 30% on the upside and you lose your shirt on the downside, and sure, you might be able to make 5% in T bills, but we put that move in in a day for bitcoin. So it's starting to become the point where you're getting attention from everyone, and I think that's pretty cool.
00:08:26.132 - 00:08:59.180, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think? Obviously this is just speculative and it's hard to know the exact reason, but what do you think is responsible for the recent price change because there have been actually some pretty obvious catalysts. There's obviously all of the ETF stuff, which seems to be the most proximate one. There's the rates story that's sort of happening in the background. But the price action last week was really pretty violent. There was one candle for bitcoin where printed like 2000, 3000 in the span of in a very short period of time. That's the first time I've seen something like that happen in to your point years.
00:08:59.180 - 00:09:07.900, Speaker A: It does, yeah.
00:09:08.990 - 00:10:06.554, Speaker B: Let me just shout out to me for posting about a lot of the causes or what could have happened about this. We can throw the Tweets up or not, but for several weeks I was like, hey, there's this guy and he's on Derabit and there's all these rumors of who he is and who he's working with. But there's this guy who, when ETH went above two K, he was selling all these calls. He was selling them at over 2000 and suppressing the vault of ETH and suppressing the ability for it to break out. And then ETH crashed and he sold, I think, like almost 300, 400,000 calls. And most of them were at the 16 51, 700 strike. And the Tweets that I put out were like, I'm not really worried about finance, but if there is a really big face ripping rally, then this dude is going to be in trouble and he's either going to need to throw the keys back because he's selling the right to buy ETH at this price.
00:10:06.554 - 00:10:53.102, Speaker B: So he either has the ETH or he needs to go buy the ETH to give it to the person who's bought these options. And sure enough, as we approached those strikes, it just started to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze. And one morning, Derebit changed the margin rules on the exchange for this one guy and they're basically trying to rein it. All right, pretty cool. But this is kind of something that happens late in the bear cycle where selling options is considered something that's just risk free passive income, and it works until it doesn't, and it works until people buy the calls. That the price squeezes to where you could be in trouble. And sure enough, it did.
00:10:53.102 - 00:11:40.602, Speaker B: And so I think what we have now is a bit different where this guy is probably out of ammunition on the ETH side. He's bought back some of the calls. I'm sure he has to give up the collateral for a lot of the other ones, but you're no longer going to have that force suppressing efall specifically, but also bitcoin fall and price action in the space as a whole. So the market structure has changed dramatically over the past week is, I think, what I would say is kind of the output of this move. The inputs are know dgens being Djens, this guy writing too many calls. Dare bit kind of being a little bit I don't know if shady is the right word, but kind of just like a little bit close to the chest on who this guy was and if he actually had the collateral. But it appears to have resolved, which is good.
00:11:40.602 - 00:11:46.446, Speaker B: Yeah. And how to exchange bankruptcy, which cross our fingers, but hopefully that's not coming.
00:11:46.548 - 00:12:12.120, Speaker A: Yeah, no more of what this reminds me of a little bit is I actually remember in the days before Three Arrow was sort of Three Arrows listening to sue talk about this on the very early days of Uncommon Core, about buying volatility at the beginning of the last bull market. And there were a lot of option sellers which were caught off sides back then too.
00:12:12.810 - 00:12:32.246, Speaker B: Yeah, he was the guy that was buying those options. And I know the firms, they bought them often and they got just steamrolled. And so shout out to sue who is currently incarcerated, but hopefully he's here for the rest of the yeah, that's.
00:12:32.358 - 00:13:12.922, Speaker A: It was just funny because he was the guy who's like don't get blown out so you can't be a part of the super cycle. So there's a little bit of irony there. But yeah, not to say that it's all going to play out exactly like that. We started to get into this a little bit last episode, but I was thinking I was just remembering it's like 2019, much worse time period, but if you looked at what the price action was doing, it was sort of like drifting up. It actually ended the year much higher and I think it kissed twelve K around, or Bitcoin did around February of 2020. But then it got this huge hole blown in it with COVID and then it really spiked back up after that. So obviously you can't do the counterfactual of what would have happened if COVID hadn't been the case.
00:13:12.922 - 00:14:01.546, Speaker A: But maybe that's like what's going to happen now, which is not this sort of violent drop and then something that feels much more like a steep ascent, but this kind of slow, gradual kind of build. And there's a really good article by this guy, Eddie Lazarin, who works at a 16 Z. It's like the price cycle of innovation or something like that, where he's reversed the sort of causal order that you might think this is how it works, which is fundamentals drive price. And he says, this rings true to me at least price moves first. So maybe it's like people are off sides, liquidity is really low, people have to FOMO. But something moves with the price, then the price gets people to make the calls that you were describing in the West Village, right? Like, hey, get me on coinbase. Like this Bitcoin thing is moving, I got to get in.
00:14:01.546 - 00:14:24.926, Speaker A: Right? And then that price move begets more buying. Then the media starts covering it for the first time in a positive light. Then that begets actual fundamentals, which is devs coming in. People building products and then the VC funding cycle typically restarts and then you're sort of off to the races. So it's hard to predict how and when that kicks in, but I feel like that's the thing that has to kick in now.
00:14:25.108 - 00:15:19.566, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think we are off to the races. Just like a little bit of inside baseball on the inner workings of crypto markets. Additional to this is there is a cottage industry for OTC options for the major tokens, definitely, but also the smaller tokens as well. I'm not going to name any names, but when you get deep into a bear market, a lot of these projects are like, man, we need money, we don't want to sell our tokens, but we do want income. And so they'll structure these weird bilateral options agreements with OTC desks where they're like, can you write calls for us? And how they hedge those calls on the long tail of tokens is they go into larger markets and so I'm not going to name any tokens. They'll hedge XYZ token calls with ETH positions or Bitcoin positions.
00:15:19.566 - 00:16:11.502, Speaker B: And so you have this kind of chain reaction where it's not just the big tokens that have these weird option structure on them, you'll have the alts do this as well. And so if someone starts getting blown out on alt options that they've been overriding calls on, that's where you see the kind of violent squeezes that were kind of the beginning of the 2020 cycle. And I don't think we've seen those yet, which is kind of like why I'm still thinking that this might not be fully over. But yeah, I tweeted out that the buy walls of the future are built and paid for the bears. It's true, it's just like they don't actually want to do that, but they're kind of just putting themselves in a position where eventually being short volun crypto is always a bad idea. Yeah, don't fight the market. No man is that powerful.
00:16:11.646 - 00:16:22.520, Speaker A: So that's really good inside baseball. I had no idea that was the case. Do you have like a checklist of things that you're looking at right now to be like, okay, there are some things that look positive, but XYZ thing hasn't happened yet.
00:16:25.770 - 00:16:52.234, Speaker B: I think the main one is just the credit rebuild. And we've talked about that, but credit seems to be rebuilding on chain versus off chain. It's still impossible and we're a borrower, it's still impossible for us to borrow collateral off chain. We have to post on chain collateral. It's over collateralized by three X. But I think that's a healthy, more steady build of credit. And Genesis had 50 billion of loan originations.
00:16:52.234 - 00:17:42.734, Speaker B: We talked about this on Last Pod in Q four of 2021 that is being built up on chain in a more safe and more regulated way. And that's kind of the last thing that I'm looking for. One of the funnier ones that I thought was on my checklist that appeared this week was like, when are ETH fees going to kind of start ripping again? And people are making all these mental gymnastics arguments about, is it DA, is it settlement? The L2 is taking fees, is it the trading that's going to really hurt ETH fees? In reality, it's like one day of price action and a shitty telegram bot that pumped guai to 50 to 100 GWA for an entire day. Imagine what that looks like in a bull market. So all the pieces are kind of starting to collate and yeah, I'm like in a good mood. This is the start of something, it.
00:17:42.772 - 00:18:14.118, Speaker A: Feels like, yeah, I tend to agree. Something else that may or may not be on the horizon, but there's a launch of some sort of major like dYdX made their migration today. They are now live on Cosmos. So congratulations to the team at dYdX. We've talked about it before, but Celestia, they've done their AirDrop. They are most likely they're launching main net soon. So that also is like that's kind of another big L1 potential to recapitalize the Dgens.
00:18:14.118 - 00:18:48.920, Speaker A: And it's just like a very high quality project that I would say there's also probably a good amount of tokens that I would guess are going to launch in the somewhat near future in the Salana ecosystem. There's been like a sort of quiet ground build of high quality projects that have launched and are live, but they don't necessarily have tokens yet. I have no inside information, but I would assume that there will be tokens there soon. So I think there's going to be stuff that will get people excited again. I guess bitcoin has to do its run first before there's a rotation into some of that other stuff.
00:18:49.850 - 00:19:15.914, Speaker B: Yes, a couple of things on that. I think that's exactly right. So you think about it in terms of Bitcoin runs first, it draws a bunch of TradFi in. TradFi is kind of like overpowered relative to the on chain native degens. You kind of need both of those factions to be like roughly equal power. There's no hard math to this. This is just like my intuition.
00:19:15.914 - 00:19:52.166, Speaker B: And last time, what got the Dgens up to full strength? It was DFI summer, it was all those airdrops, it was the uni AirDrop, it was the NFT stuff that was happening this cycle. It feels like it's going to be probably like Maker Endgame in Q One. Q Two, that really recapitalizes people. That'll be like a large scale industrial farm that you're probably talking about mid nine figures, maybe even a billion of incentives in the first year. Celestia dYdX, they calculated what the cost of that AirDrop was. It was over a billion. That's kind of the stuff that you're looking for to get the degen slowly recapitalized.
00:19:52.278 - 00:20:26.674, Speaker A: I was very curious about that. Where do you shake out here? Let me actually pull the Tweet up I think someone from one confirmation but hasu retweeted it. It's basically looking at the dollar value of Airdrops for major products or major projects out there. So here, I've got it. So there's dYdX on there, there's uniswap, there's Arbitrum, optimism. It actually was interesting because I had never really done the math to back into how much each of these projects spent and they were pretty different. Okay, dYdX, the cost of the AirDrop was 1.4
00:20:26.674 - 00:20:36.626, Speaker A: billion. Uniswap, 657,000,000. Arbitrum, 1.4 billion, or just under 1.4. Blur, 342,000,000. ENS, 1.16 billion.
00:20:36.626 - 00:20:49.050, Speaker A: Optimism, 234,000,000. That's a big differential, frankly, between arbitram and optimism. I didn't have that off the top of my head, but what do you think about this whole concept?
00:20:50.270 - 00:21:21.798, Speaker B: I mean, it's funny, people have always given half the tokens roughly to the community because people have always given roughly half the tokens to the community. There is no underlying logic to it. There is no X, Y or Z inputs. And we're trying to get an efficiency of roughly some arbitrary number. I think everyone needs to do a better job of counting the impact and making these more efficient. But add those all up, what is that? That's 24, that's three. That's 3.7.
00:21:21.798 - 00:21:49.486, Speaker B: That's like $3.3 billion of money that was given to Dgens. And so think about that as the recapitalization event of Dgens in the last cycle. How can we add that up and get to a number roughly like that? Maybe Celestia launches at a billion and gives half of it away to people. That's 500 million. Say the maker end game incentives are a billion, say the infinex incentives are a couple of hundred million. You can kind of get close to that.
00:21:49.486 - 00:22:19.878, Speaker B: So my point is, regardless if this is efficient or not, it's free money that's given to our faithful countrymen and hopefully not a bunch of mev bots that just sell it. But we're going to approach levels of this recapitalization fairly quickly and I think it's going to be really interesting to see kind of what people do with the money this time around because I think people have learned some lessons in the past few years.
00:22:20.044 - 00:22:57.214, Speaker A: I agree. Correct me if I'm wrong here. I think you would know this probably better than me, but it feels like there's been a shift in thinking around airdrops. Whereas I think some of the really early teams, like the compounds of the world, might have thought about this in terms of, like, let's just get our token out there, right? This is supposed to be a governance token. I just wanted to get it into as many hands as we possibly can. Whereas now I think the thinking for Airdrops and incentives is cost of customer acquisition. And so it's very easy to sort of look at this and then it's like, well, what do I want my community to do? How am I going to incentivize them? And I think these get roundly criticized.
00:22:57.214 - 00:23:47.202, Speaker A: It's very easy to look at these numbers and say, hey, this is an enormous amount of money to spend. Did you actually see ROI? Was this particularly worth it? But I think what's maybe less apparent is that that wasn't for some of these necessarily the explicit intention. And then two, I would also qualify that these are non cash expenses. So it's not like there is a big difference between printing something, a token out of thin air that ends up being worth a lot of money and giving it away versus actually spending a billion dollars cash. I just think those are two very different things. And the question maybe I pose to you, or for people who are kind of like dunking on these numbers, is it's not an accident that some of the most successful protocols in crypto have also spent quite a bit on this? And I do wonder if some of these names would be up here if they hadn't done this right?
00:23:47.256 - 00:24:37.166, Speaker B: And so in that lens, it's worth it. How much of your company, if you knew your company was going to be worth call it uniswap, is worth like 4 billion, would you give away 600 million of the supply? Yeah, of course you would. Now there's a lot of people who tried to shoot that gap and hit the lip and didn't clear it, where it's like you gave away 50% of the supply and everyone just sold it. So there's not much you can do. But the success case is so compelling that even if you waste a good portion of it, it is worth it. And so I've seen all these people saying, q two, 2024, I'm going to watch Margin Call a bunch because that's when I think the cycle top is going to be. The cycle top can't come until the Djens are recapitalized and then they spend that money because that's what makes those like, avalanche.
00:24:37.166 - 00:25:05.100, Speaker B: I checked in 2021 went from like, I forget what price point, but it went 14 X in two months. That's not institutional capital, that's Djens and retail. Like getting in some sort of unholy alliance to just medically go crazy. And that's what you're looking for. You're looking for people to be recapitalized, then you're looking for TradFi to come in really strong and really hot and that is when the PvP market starts and that's when it gets really crazy.
00:25:05.950 - 00:25:06.934, Speaker A: Get the hated rally.
00:25:06.982 - 00:25:49.260, Speaker B: Rhyme and reason, right? That's when you get the hated rally, that's when you get NFTs pumping and people are like, what is this stuff? And only when other folks start believing that is when you should start watching Margin Call. So I think TJ and Spartan poses, if you expect this to last nine more months, there's just like a kind of a wrong mental frame. You're probably looking at the entire bull market of last cycle. For me, it started in 2019, in the summer of 2019. That's when Chain Link really went wild and Synthetics went kind of wild and it lasted until the end of 2021. I mean, you could even say it lasted until like March of 2022.
00:25:50.910 - 00:26:21.238, Speaker A: That's super interesting to hear you say that, because I have a different timeline on that because I obviously am invested in crypto and own a bunch. But I view it the bull market for me, I view it more from the perspective of my seat at Blockworks as when does activity really pick up? When are people hitting conferences, when are people consuming information and stuff like that. So there's a lag, at least for us, definitely. 2019 did not feel like a bull market to me. That felt like painful, basically.
00:26:21.324 - 00:27:00.100, Speaker B: Yeah. I would define the start of the bull market as when things stop getting worse and they start getting better. And then I would kind of define the end of the bull market as kind of when things stop getting better and they start getting worse and there's obviously a very concentrated period. 2021 was like the meat of it, but there's events leading up to it, there's events that end it. There's characters, people come and go. These things last for years. Summer of 2019 to March 2022, that's like almost three years.
00:27:00.100 - 00:27:05.300, Speaker B: It takes a long time.
00:27:05.850 - 00:27:39.242, Speaker A: So cycle bitcoin bitcoin up first. I saw Mark over at Ave Post. It's called Beds bitcoin, ethereum DeFi shitcoins there is actually pretty funny and probably accurate. Probably accurate. There is usually the hated rally is sort of a funny one, which is I feel like that tends to be an asset that has some amount of mind share. So it's kind of been around, but it's really low. Volume.
00:27:39.242 - 00:28:12.042, Speaker A: And it's also something that the inside crypto community just completely writes off and it ends up just ripping really hard in everyone's face. So the one that I would say maybe there could have been two of these last cycle, which was Cardano, I would say is A, hated rally and maybe BMB. So I feel like something like that ends up happening this time as well. I actually do have a contender for who that I don't really want to say who it is on air, but there are a couple of solid contenders for who it can be this time around. Shit, I'm blanking on his last name.
00:28:12.096 - 00:28:13.834, Speaker B: Hal Press. Hal Press? Yeah.
00:28:13.872 - 00:29:01.254, Speaker A: Hal Press came on at the very end of when the bull market turned and gave some really good alpha, actually, around the turning, like inflection points in markets. So if you guys want to go back, find this old Empire episode yet, some pretty good, pretty good F on that. All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally. Focused conference in all of crypto we are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers so think TradFi, macro funds, crypto, native funds, big allocators and financial institutions so banks, payment processors, et cetera all in one spot. It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan zero, 72, whatever all in one room so you can know what the big money is doing.
00:29:01.254 - 00:29:36.450, Speaker A: We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of macro and crypto where we are in the cycle real world assets so everything from stablecoins to on chain treasuries to tokenized assets it's gonna be a blast but the other reason you really want to go is London baby, center of the world. At one point you got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer, it's going to be a blast. So because you're such great listeners to Bell Curve there's a code, Bell 20 that's going to get you 20% off. So click the link at the bottom of this episode it'll take you right over to the homepage, you'll see all of our speakers and use Bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code.
00:29:36.450 - 00:30:48.170, Speaker A: I will see you in sunny London town in March. I'd love to get your take on there was a little bit of a kerfuffle this week, maybe we could call it that about layer zero. So basically there is layer zero sort of in this sort of I guess partnership there was a proposal that went live on Lido which was a layer zero proposal which was supported by the Avalanche Foundation BNB Chain and scroll which facilitated the bridging of wrap Steeth across ethereum. So basically the idea, the selling point from the perspective of layer zero is that it prevents fragmentation. Obviously if you have many different bridges it both fragments liquidity but it's also a really poor user experience standpoint because you're like well, which one is the canonical wrap's teeth basically and I would say there was some pushback. I like the team at layer zero. I feel like their heart's in the right place but also I think some of it was pretty valid.
00:30:48.170 - 00:31:39.610, Speaker A: Hart Lambert posted basically about some of the security concerns on the multi SIG that supports the layer zero tech and if there was some sort of exploit hasu had pretty strong pushback which is basically just the idea of it. To paraphrase is felt sort of strong armed into trying to say that Lido approved this while this was still in proposal. They were sort of trying to push this idea that this was the one canonical bridge whereas this has to be evaluated by the Dow on the Dow's timeline across other service providers and vendors. There needs to be a process and then if we think this is the best solution, we can vote on this. But it felt maybe from an optics or tactic standpoint, this wasn't received super well. How do you view this whole debacle?
00:31:40.190 - 00:32:30.102, Speaker B: I mean, just so people understand, it's kind of like the difference of remember when there were all those shoddy versions of USDC on Salana? There was like ten USDCs. Which one is the real USDC? Does the full faith and credit of USDC stand behind each individual bridge that it was bridged on? And the answer is obviously no. If something happens to whatever XYZ USDC on solana and you ask for USDC to blacklist it or help you out of a hack, it's just not their problem. It's not their security vector. They don't own that. And so Lido conversation is kind of the same thing. Bridging has long been a contentious topic for Lido and it's out of the looking out for the best interest of users in terms of they want to have super secure bridges and they want to be able to have kind of like canonical versions of wraps teeth.
00:32:30.102 - 00:33:15.690, Speaker B: So when you stake your ETH, transfer it or buy it on layer zero or wherever other blockchain it may live on, you get the real wrap Steeth. And there's all sorts of other arguments other than security tied up in this. Another one is who owns the trademark for wrap Steeth? Is that like a universal thing? You can also kind of extend this to like, who owns a trademark for or or like all the shit that Justin Sun is doing on like I'm sure those two things are kind of like a similar argument, but I don't know, I think this is kind of spilt milk under the bridge. This will be sorted out. Like you said, I like the layer zero guys. I obviously like the lido guys, but people are just trying to get an edge on each other. Layer zero is in a very competitive game.
00:33:15.690 - 00:33:34.980, Speaker B: And Hart Lambert, I think his heart is in the right place, no pun intended, but he also runs a know there's there's obviously kind of like he wants people to do it one way. Layer zero wants to move fast and break things. But at the end of the day, lido is kind of the adjudicator of what the real rap Steeth is. So probably should just defer to them.
00:33:35.510 - 00:34:27.522, Speaker A: Yeah, big fan of the Lido team as well. Obviously, from the perspective of just like, underscore the sort of business rationale or the imperative here. We did a great interview with Sam Kazamian over at Fracs, who did a great job of describing sort of the similarity even between the business model of a stablecoin versus a liquid staking token versus a bridge. It's actually all kind of like you're managing withdrawable deposits and then an asset which you want to be used and viewed as money and there's a huge liquidity advantage there and kind of like this really big network effect that sort of kicks in. So the race to be like the canonical thing where you don't even have to consider, okay, there aren't ten different bridged versions of this. Essentially, there's one bridged version of this, and it's as good as gold. It should be.
00:34:27.522 - 00:34:40.310, Speaker A: The consumer views it as the same thing. There's a huge advantage there, and I would guess, like, a pretty massive power law, which is maybe why you'll start to see more BD wars around like this as things kind of heat up.
00:34:40.380 - 00:34:47.046, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the same thing as the Circle Bridge too, right? They want to own the canonical version. Not surprising. Yeah.
00:34:47.148 - 00:35:54.770, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree. All right, maybe we can talk a little bit about there has been a lot of blowback about The Wall Street Journal this week. Nick Carter, the National Treasurer investigative reporter that he I'm always like, Dude, he does so much. I mean, he's a full time running Castle Island with Matt and still finds the time to thoroughly read into the data sources here and sort of found that there was basically a claim that the Wall Street Journal published, which they sourced from Elliptic, which originally reported that Hamas raised $41 million in crypto, which sort of got expanded. And Nick dug into the data and found that they were actually counting Exchange wallets and just assuming that all of that was I mean, come on. And then Elliptic actually came out and said they refuted the claims that The Wall Street Journal put together. It feels pretty one sided.
00:35:54.770 - 00:36:19.646, Speaker A: I didn't watch it, but I saw it was getting tweeted around today that there was a Senate Banking Committee where actual senators were saying, hey, this doesn't feel like this was accurately sourced or is valid data, but the Wall Street Journal hasn't published a retraction, and, like, Elizabeth Warren and the classic sort of crew just all cottoned onto this. And yeah, it feels, like, not particularly great from a journalistic perspective.
00:36:19.678 - 00:37:06.542, Speaker B: Yeah. And the other thing is, like, the guy, you know, who hasn't been on Twitter in, like, a year or something. How that's possible for a journalist? I mean, you tell me. But he gets on, and instead of saying anything of any substance, he just starts tweeting motivational quotes, cryptic bullshit, and things that have no relevancy to the current retraction or correction case that he's involved in. And how is that is that, like, the official Wall Street Journal editorial board response? You go freelance on Twitter. If you get called out and your source is refuted on an article that 120 congresspeople signed a letter for, it's just insane. And it's really sad because I love the Wall Street Journal.
00:37:06.542 - 00:37:50.462, Speaker B: That's one of the last I know mainstream outlets that I read, and I'm looking at my phone, fuck, like, do I have to cancel this? Like, do I still want to talk to their reporters? Do I still want know, support kind of what they're doing? Because they do have some great crypto. Um, at least, you know, they were early to kind of Gary Gensler and his quest know, eradicate the industry and they pushed back on that. But they've done more harm with this article than any good that they've done over the past few mean retractions are not just ethical, they're necessary. Reporting like this can stimulate industry's growth. It can push policy in the wrong direction. And this is how you get things like the Patriot Act. This is how you get things like legislation that can just invade your privacy and change things unilaterally.
00:37:50.462 - 00:38:21.150, Speaker B: So I hope that Nick Carter continues his holy war against the Wall Street Journal and this guy in know, I've looked at these people's reporting. They always have kind of posted negative slanted pieces on crypto. They clearly are not independent. And just that his response, ian Tally's response is just frankly disgusting. Like, how are you an adult male that works in one of the most respected news organizations in the world and your response is just to go on Twitter and shit? Post, like, not helpful.
00:38:21.810 - 00:38:26.720, Speaker A: Didn't feel like it was particularly good. Spirited engagement, is what I would say.
00:38:27.410 - 00:38:31.838, Speaker B: No, I mean, he felt defensive more than anything else.
00:38:32.004 - 00:39:20.602, Speaker A: Yeah, usually. I really do believe I do believe in media. I think there's an abundance of bad takes around media. The way I would describe it is for maybe the invisible part is you know how when you go to an airport and then the people who work at the airport are really rude to you, you're like, why is this person being so rude to me? And then you see the person ahead of you like, berating this airport worker because their flight was delayed and something that's not their fault at all. That is what it feels like to work in media. You do just get berated by people constantly and it makes you very callous to when people actually have a point. But in this specific instance, I feel that the data is so manifest, it's so clearly a mistake.
00:39:20.602 - 00:39:36.820, Speaker A: I don't understand how they haven't published a retraction here. This just feels like really bad, really bad practice and is really damaging too, because it gets cited in these Senate hearings and has the potential to influence regulation. It's so.
00:39:38.550 - 00:40:13.394, Speaker B: Mean. No matter what industry you're in, if you fuck up, you should take your medicine, you should admit that you are wrong and you should try to rectify it. And if we make a shitty investment that embarrasses the firm, you think our LPs are going to yell at us 100%. But look, I think of myself as like an 18 year old in a 32 year old's body, but I'm able to kind of get right with myself and say I fucked up. That's okay. The fact that this guy isn't is just so bearish on what's going on in that newsroom. It makes me question not only their crypto reporting, but kind of everything else.
00:40:13.394 - 00:40:22.770, Speaker B: How much of what else we're reading is kind of this vein of misinformation or misunderstood. It's really sad.
00:40:23.110 - 00:40:24.690, Speaker A: Gel man amnesia.
00:40:25.350 - 00:40:27.890, Speaker B: Dude, get him out of here.
00:40:28.040 - 00:40:47.260, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like when you know something and you read about it in the media and you're like, oh my God, this is so wrong. How could they possibly have printed this? But then you turn the page to something that you don't know about and you continue to treat it as if it's fact. It's just such a true thing. Yeah, it's discouraging for sure.
00:40:47.790 - 00:41:06.980, Speaker B: A lot of stuff happening in the world today, having slanted media or uninformed media can only make things worse. So we've talked about this before, but I'm so bullish on things like community notes. I think that might be a part of the future of journalism and I hope just more third party verification is a part of what goes on in the future.
00:41:07.350 - 00:41:42.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. One thing, I'd love to get your take on this. I actually feel like Michael and I talked about this a little bit when we were doing a couple of our solo episodes a couple of weeks ago. Celestia is integrating with Arbitrum Orbit for data availability. So as a reminder to folks, Arbitrum, the construction is actually there was a really great we'll link it in the show notes. There was a great thread with Stephen Goldfeder over at Arbitrum explaining the difference in business model between optimism and Arbitrum. And he likened it to two theme park models.
00:41:42.022 - 00:42:29.370, Speaker A: One is a theme park model like Disney where you have to pay a lot upfront, but once you go in, every single ride is free, which is the arbitrary business model. And if you want to license the L2 to fork it, you can do that, but you have to pay a licensing fee. And then there's the other business model of Coney Island where it's free to go in but you have to pay to use everything. And that's sort of like the optimism business model. And that's why you're starting to see optimism have law of chains because they need to extract value or capture value in some way, whereas Arbitrum does it via licensing. But what you can do at Arbitrum is there's a layer three which settles down to Arbitrum and that's aligned with the economic incentives of the chain. So that's called Arbitrum Orbit which is the platform that allows you to easily spin up a layer three and that integrates with Celestia's data availability.
00:42:29.370 - 00:43:19.770, Speaker A: How do you view because there's going to be a bunch of data availability solutions online relatively soon. So we're going to have Celestia, which roll ups on Ethereum can choose to integrate with there's going to be eigenda, polygon avail, all these different things. And basically that's going to make costs much cheaper for roll ups. So the largest cost for roll up from my understanding is, and it's a variable cost as well, is data availability. Posting to ethereum. So basically, roll ups are going to get a big depending on if they want to pass through that cost their users, it's going to become much cheaper to interact on roll ups, or roll ups are going to get more profitable. But how do you view I guess I'm just thinking about it a lot because Celestia is launching soon, but how do you view data availability and what that enables like cheaper DA enables for the ecosystem?
00:43:20.990 - 00:44:02.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So if I think about the construction of fees on Know, it's a Misteployed Telegram bot, it's all the random shitcoins, it's all the assets that are in DFI, it's all the high quality NFTs. I've said this before and it's interesting. The roll ups, they're a very small share of ETH fees. There may be 5%. And so how does that 5% get to 10% or go to zero? A lot more roll ups is one idea, and I'm sure that that's coming and integrating with Celestial or not, still some aspect of fees will flow to Ethereum. And so I think there's going to be a lot more roll ups.
00:44:02.270 - 00:44:49.350, Speaker B: Sure, some of them might use DA from Celestial Eigen layer or avail, but that's really not going to be material to the fees of ETH. What would be material is if the NFTs moved, if the DeFi moved, if the assets moved, and I think the flow of those assets is dependent on a few things. But what we've seen for the L three S, and honestly, the L two S as well, is that they have kind of failed in attracting the assets to stay on them. And you can even look at Salana, there's 300 million of DFI TBL there. There really has never been this move to these other chains. And sure, one day it may happen, but Bridging, which we just talked about, remains like a huge issue. And frankly, the institutions are not willing to go across these bridges.
00:44:49.350 - 00:45:43.498, Speaker B: And so rather, thinking about it from the perspective of like, oh my, or Celestia DA is going to take a shitload of fees away from ETH, I don't think that's right. I think ETH fees are just going to continue to grow and then the bar for Mooning 50 to 100 GWe on a random day is very low. So that's going to come back. I think the burden of proof is kind of on like Celestia DA, Eigen DA, whatever else. It's like, how are these systems sustainable when you have very little fees flowing through them? Can you always live on incentives? Is there a path where you can get combinatorial safety or staking security from ETH? That's like, I would give kind of a point to Eigenda on that front and Know minus points from Celestia DA on the other. But these things, I feel like they've launched and people have been like, it's know, the ETH DA game has been fun. We're going to have to pack it up.
00:45:43.498 - 00:46:14.814, Speaker B: It's just not the case because that's not where ETH does not derive a significant portion of its fees from these roll ups. And so I expect that to continue to be the case. And the burden of proof is on these L3s S to prove that there's any product market fit on them. In general, I really like polygon. I really like a lot of the other kind of like L3s style efforts that people are putting out. But those have frankly failed. Just like launching in an isolated vacuum is not worth the cost savings that you get when you're not on Ethel One.
00:46:14.814 - 00:46:35.494, Speaker B: So that's my perspective. I do think on the margins something like Eigenda is bullish. ETH. Like the idea that you have these alternative validator systems where you can just pick up 10% extra yield for your ETH, that's really cool. It's for super ETH aligned. It's only going to reinforce the network effects. I'm more specious on something like Celestia.
00:46:35.494 - 00:47:02.900, Speaker B: I don't know what that appeals to in terms of just like a crowd last point on this. So let's say Celestia, something happens and it launches at 100 million FTB. Is that a secure DA layer? The market cap is some function of the security there because it's secured by the native token. Do you want to secure your roll up on something that has a smaller market cap than your roll up? I don't know.
00:47:03.670 - 00:47:24.314, Speaker A: Yeah, the Celestia thing, I think it's unclear to me where I think if I guessed anything, I'd just be guessing. I don't know if I have a particularly sophisticated take on it. It's just where the actual stuff happens. The execution layer, there's the DA layer and then there's settlement. I agree. Most of the stuff hasn't moved off of ETH for now. I agree.
00:47:24.314 - 00:47:59.974, Speaker A: I think most of the stuff is actually there's probably going to be a bunch of projects that still launch on ETH main chain. Like Pepe was a really good indication of like that's where the community is. That's where the people with money are. Probably will be a bunch of fees that still get generated from projects on main chain. I think the Celestia thing, if they can really I really like what they have with their light nodes, I think that blockchains are going to start to gravitate towards that. Like Ethereum has data availability, sampling on their timeline, solana it is possible to do. They don't view it as something that they need to do today, but I think it probably is the right way.
00:47:59.974 - 00:48:48.498, Speaker A: I don't know. I've been thinking, I know this is a heretical thing to say, but my problem with Solo Staking has always relying on that as a core tenant for the network is like it's great. It is 100% a really great thing to do. It's a huge accomplishment of both the bitcoin and the ETH blockchains. But I do wonder how many regular average people there are out there that will run the hardware setup of an ETH full node. And I do wonder if maybe a way that we could get the benefit of users being able to actually verify all the transactions that are happening on chain is something like the Celestia light node kind of like a light client that you could easily run on an iPad, something like that. You can still verify the transactions even if you're not involved with constructing the blocks per se.
00:48:48.498 - 00:49:24.602, Speaker A: I think that would be a really good I've started to sort of think about that as a compromise because what I think of as blockchains it's a shared database that you have both read and write. Like the average user can both read and write if you want to. But maybe there's a lot of people that don't really care about writing and that's not the point. But you still want to be able to verify that all of the rules that everyone has agreed to are being done in a good way. So I went on a little bit of a monologue just there. But that's why I've always liked the Celestia part of that equation, which is their light nodes and their data availability. Sampling I think has legs.
00:49:24.746 - 00:50:28.790, Speaker B: I don't know, I think you're probably right. It probably gets adopted by a bunch of different blockchains and becomes less novel like when ETH adopted proof of stake from Cosmos. But the supply side and how transactions get validated is like the end part of the supply chain, the demand, the culture, the native asset being used as money, the NFTs that have provenance on a blockchain that's the product that you're selling. And it's great that people have figured out a new way to kind of square the circle but ultimately that's not what matter. I think you probably yeah you're here know remember when know Iota and that was the only way that supply chain finance was going to WASM and there's all these things that kind of come and go and it's not to say that Celestia won't be impactful or that they're wrong. I think they're probably right. It never is purely a technology thing and sometimes that gets a little lost.
00:50:28.790 - 00:50:55.998, Speaker B: But we'll see some of these things have staying power, some of these things change the game. But a lot of these things are so path dependent. You're only ethereum because you launched in 2014 and you went through the ups and downs. You have vitalik, you have this community. Celestia is just starting on that journey and it's so much easier. And I've heard this a lot about technology that has not launched. It's like, this is going to change the game and it's X, Y and Z.
00:50:55.998 - 00:51:09.070, Speaker B: And when it comes out, usually there's kind of like, yes, we're soft launching this and it's going to take a little time and this is like the testnet version and things are rarely as seamless as they seem as when they're kind of unlaunched.
00:51:09.230 - 00:51:33.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a lot of merit to that last story. I want to honestly get your take on. We were talking about a little bit. It's a bit of a self shill, but we launched something this week which we've been putting together for a long time, which is the Arbitrum Coalition. So we've been looking at Dows for a long time just in terms of how they source labor. People have called this something different over the years. It was a little while ago, people used to call it governance mining.
00:51:33.446 - 00:52:34.602, Speaker A: But the idea is especially these roll ups on ETH start to take their training wheels off and rely less on the foundation. You need very high quality service providers that can actually are deeply entrenched in the ecosystem, know what's going on and can help sort of guide and form the so we blockworks research, teamed up with Gauntlet and Trail of bits to basically be like, okay, let's solve some of your problems about just, like, creating a strategic roadmap, because this is something that happens in the Dow all the time. A proposal will go live, people will be like, okay, I like the idea of this, but I don't understand how it fits into the broader strategy. I don't know how to source the service providers, blah, blah, blah. And then you just lose momentum. So it's kind of this combination of fixing that problem so things can actually happen in the Dao and then the two big things that Arbitrum are really going to need moving forward are audits going into the future and the stuff that Gauntlet can do. So when you want to roll out a new feature like making sure there's not some catastrophic bug or way that people are going to interact with it, that's going to take down the system and the self show part of this being over.
00:52:34.602 - 00:52:58.242, Speaker A: I do think that you're going to see the this was a prediction of this year actually, if you remember the predictions we did going into this year, there's going to be the rise of these guilds and professional service providers. And my hope would be that if this is successful, that a lot of others do this across other protocols because DAOs need good professional service providers. So that's what I love this.
00:52:58.296 - 00:53:53.590, Speaker B: I mean, there's product market fit for having adults in the room for these Dows and we need more of that, not less of like there was a vote for Lido to give incentives to Arbitrum to stake ETH and it was literally like a no lose proposition and they voted against it just because of bureaucratic mismanagement. And so government for the people, by the people sometimes need a little bit of a helping hand along the way. And not just a helping hand, but being data driven, being organized, hearing stakeholders out, interviewing people to understand how they're feeling and what they want. That's all part of this job. And I'm so bullish on you guys for doing this. There's at least ten to 20 to 30 more protocols that need this. And the hardest part is whenever others try to do this, I find there's this level of mistrust and frankly, like nepotism that results in people being awarded things that are kind of self dealing.
00:53:53.590 - 00:54:05.980, Speaker B: Being able to guarantee that there's someone who's watching is so helpful because you guys have GovHub, but things are moving quickly and there's so many of these things that it can get out of hand fast.
00:54:06.430 - 00:54:54.326, Speaker A: You know what else? I appreciate the kind words and I would say this is not just a blockworks research story. My hope would be that lots of if this is successful, that there are lots of these Dows. Because one of the things that I feel like is missing from Dows is you guys invest in companies, right? How would you feel if there was just no strategic roadmap for a company? It's like, hey, we need to know where we're going here. Because if you don't know where we're going, then we don't know how to prioritize anything. And I think a good example of the pitfalls of not having a cohesive strategic vision is what happened in Cosmosland with the fumbling of the bag with Stride. Like the Hub had the opportunity to acquire Stride and it was just such a layup. I feel like for additional source of revenue we solve a lot of the problems that we're seeing in Ethland.
00:54:54.326 - 00:55:20.370, Speaker A: So the Stride part of the back end actually becomes very decentralized. There's token voting that governs it. You have the LSM, which serves as regulation, additional source and a value add for the Hub which is still seeking that. But everyone is just like, well, how much does it cost? How much atom do I need to mint? And it's like, guys, but if you had a strategic vision to be like, here's where I'm going to get here's how much it's going to cost, but it's going to pay me back ten times because it's going to help me to get there and to make decisions faster.
00:55:21.910 - 00:56:05.300, Speaker B: I went through the same thing on Maker where people were like, we're wasting it's like $2 million. I was like, yeah, I know, but this could result in tens of billions of dollars of potential value. They're like, I know, but we're wasting the money. It's like, just stop. I think retail and crypto is smarter and can sniff out bullshit faster than any other investor class that I've ever encountered. I think when it comes to governing things, sometimes they can trip over their own shoelaces and they just need help. And having someone like you guys just being able to at least set the guardrails for the discussion needs to happen.
00:56:05.750 - 00:56:19.218, Speaker A: I appreciate it, man. That's the goal. Just setting guardrails, basically. All right, this was a fun one. Anything else on good. One. Anything else coming up from the Framework side of things? What's going on with Framework?
00:56:19.314 - 00:56:49.310, Speaker B: We think what's going on with Framework? I mean, we're having a good time outside of the hair care man. We're deploying. We're having a good time. I'm spending more time on the East Coast. We're good. I feel like we came into this market in a really strong position or just kind of like exploiting that opportunity and we're just riding the wave now. The other thing that I'm doing personally is like, making the rounds with Wall Street folks.
00:56:49.310 - 00:56:58.500, Speaker B: I noticed that. Spreading the gospel. Someone needs to do it. Maybe a guy with hair like this. Why not?
00:56:59.510 - 00:57:04.500, Speaker A: Just out of curiosity, what has the response been from Wall Streeters right now?
00:57:04.970 - 00:57:53.890, Speaker B: Positive. Very positive. As I said, the narratives of high deficits, high debt, low growth, higher inflation, it all kind of is bullish gold and people think gold, and then it's a short hop to Bitcoin. And once you're in that, there's kind of a fantasy of interesting technology, things to invest in. But the other stuff that we see is like, the PMS on trading desks of large hedge funds, which you all know and have heard of, are trying to figure out how to get access to this. And they're pushing their risk team, they're pushing their back office team. But the thing that really kind of enables them to trade this asset class is an know how can you tell that there's an interest in Wall Street that's upticking? The CME is now the exchange with the highest open interest in all of crypto.
00:57:54.550 - 00:57:55.394, Speaker A: Really?
00:57:55.592 - 00:58:12.194, Speaker B: You sold your coin to the bankers like it happened. And so it's huge to have that happen. And the last time that that happened was late 2020. So it's just another positive indication that the herd is coming. To quote Michael.
00:58:12.322 - 00:59:01.578, Speaker A: Nograts, indeed. Yeah, we had a bunch of webinars at that point with much more traditional traders, and it was like, why do you trade on the CME? And it's super simple answer. It's just because it plugs into their existing infrastructure, right? They're all set up to trade on CME. They don't have to learn something else. So it's like, it's enough to take risk on something like Bitcoin or ETH, but you don't want to have to take risk on a totally new asset class and then set up an entirely new background infrastructure. That said, I do think that's one of the reasons why I'm so bullish on crypto Native funds is because, like, you guys have taken the time to actually set up that infrastructure, and your world of opportunities is just so much broader than someone who's like, yeah, I'll just trade on CME, and I don't really want to take the time to set that up.
00:59:01.664 - 00:59:03.718, Speaker B: It's literally closed on the weekends.
00:59:03.894 - 00:59:05.660, Speaker A: I know. Yeah.
00:59:09.150 - 00:59:28.206, Speaker B: That's the other thing I've been thinking about. So in the bull market of 2021, the weekend moves were hugely important. You'd kind of tell what type of week it was going to be by the weekend. Moves that's kind of back too. And where do the crypto natives have a leg up on the institutions on the weekends?
00:59:28.398 - 00:59:33.090, Speaker A: Weekends, baby. Yeah, they dominately. Internet addicted.
00:59:34.950 - 00:59:51.830, Speaker B: Let me say something about that too. People have been complaining about, like, I'm spending too much time on the Internet. This has really taken it out of me. Cryptos 24/7. Then stop. Your ancestors were digging ditches. You're complaining about being the Internet.
00:59:51.830 - 00:59:53.960, Speaker B: I don't understand that.
00:59:55.310 - 01:00:42.174, Speaker A: I reached out to him after he posted this, so he's going to be on another Blockworks podcast. But Ben Carlson, who posts under a wealth of Common sense, put out this great piece, which is people have more money now than they've ever had and they're more miserable than they ever were. And there is something funny about that. I don't really fully understand it, but if you were to just look at very objective measures, like if I were to say, advance, what do you need in order to be happy? You'd be like, well, I want more money in my pocket. I want access to better this, that, or the other thing. On many observable metrics, life is improving for everyone and not just people at the top, which is the popular narrative. Like people in the lower income brackets who actually did better for the most part during inflationary periods.
01:00:42.174 - 01:00:57.614, Speaker A: I know people always get super pissed about that, but you can just look at the data. But people are still super upset. So it's an interesting paradox of modern life that actually we've solved a lot of problems for people. But people seem to be pretty upset about everything all the time.
01:00:57.812 - 01:01:01.066, Speaker B: Find something that you love to do. And I honestly love Crypto.
01:01:01.258 - 01:01:02.110, Speaker A: Me too, man.
01:01:02.180 - 01:01:21.190, Speaker B: I've talked to friends and they're like, why don't you just hang it up? I'm like, what would I do? I would just sit at home and trade crypto probably, and shit. Post under an alt. I'm already doing what I love and I'm doing it with one of my best friends. And yeah, absolutely love it. So if you don't, maybe it's not for you. But I really don't see any reason to complain about it.
01:01:21.340 - 01:01:34.210, Speaker A: I am totally with you. Completely agree. All right, partner. This was a really fun one. I will see you next weekend.
