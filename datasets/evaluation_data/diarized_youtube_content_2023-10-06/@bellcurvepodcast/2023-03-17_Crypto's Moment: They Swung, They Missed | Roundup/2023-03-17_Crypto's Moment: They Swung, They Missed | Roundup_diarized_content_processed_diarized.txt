00:00:00.090 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.570 - 00:00:43.298, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup podcast. You got Michael's one and two, vance and Yano. Fellas, welcome. Are we all agree that this is now officially a macro pod and we can stop talking about all this magic internet money nonsense and talk about we.
00:00:43.324 - 00:00:47.354, Speaker C: Can get back to talking about crypto as soon as crypto has some news to talk about.
00:00:47.472 - 00:00:57.440, Speaker A: See, I didn't want to pivot this into a macro pod. I wanted to pivot this into a bitcoin pod. I think it's t minus two months until Vance is a bitcoiner no.
00:01:01.410 - 00:01:18.534, Speaker D: I mean, like, I think this is one of the craziest macro weeks of all time. So it's all right that we talk about macro a little bit. Just like we have show notes for this and I was looking at them and there's stuff about European banks in there. I just have no idea how to handicap any of that.
00:01:18.572 - 00:01:23.814, Speaker B: You're our European Banking expert. We're dependent on you for the analysis here.
00:01:24.012 - 00:02:04.420, Speaker D: I think the more interesting thing is starting with, like, we had a full weekend where our friends were without potentially their money friends, portfolio founders, portfolio companies, whatever. And that was pretty interesting. It feels like even though the situation has resolved, that was one of the goalposts for, okay, now we're in a recession, everyone is like, okay, it's on. Once bank starts failings, that's when it kind of gets indisputable. And so that was one experience over the weekend that I thought was interesting. The other one was the USDC DPEG. And we should talk about this a little bit more, but I think the DPEG is like the feature of the system.
00:02:04.420 - 00:02:44.714, Speaker D: Compare someone at Silicon Valley bank not knowing if they're going to get zero or 100, having no liquidity over the weekend, having to meet payroll, versus someone that had a bunch of USDC. Sure, it did get a little dicey for 12 hours, but the fact that you're able to TPEG realize that there's reserves in there and then it repegs, that to me is a validation of the like the fact that one of the underlying banks failed doesn't make me think any differently of USDC. It makes me think that they need more banks. And to the announcement that they put out yesterday, they now have BNY Mellonist or primary cash custodian. And so I think the net of a lot of this stuff is some banks failed. Yes. USDC Dpegged.
00:02:44.714 - 00:03:05.974, Speaker D: Yes, the USDC DPEG was a feature, in my opinion. But I think also Operation Choke Point is kind of like backfiring, like sure you killed all of the regional banks. Now it puts the onus on the largest banks to be the arbiters of does this industry survive or die? And it looks know so far they've given us a little bit warmer of a reception than we would have expected otherwise. So that's kind of what I think about it.
00:03:06.092 - 00:03:12.380, Speaker A: Can you guys walk us through what I mean you were like all of our friends lost their money. What did the weekend look like to you.
00:03:14.190 - 00:04:28.034, Speaker C: Mean? This has been talked about ad nauseam, so not going to spend too much time on it, but Silicon Valley Bank was the dominant bank for tech companies, biotech companies, venture firms, basically the entire entrepreneurial landscape that is quote unquote Silicon Valley. Also just as a side note, I think calling it Silicon Valley Bank was probably one of the worst things that could have happened given this situation. And just the narrative about bailing out or fixing or backstopping Silicon Valley Bank is never going to play nicely. Even if in reality most of the bank deposits were from companies that are less than 100 people. That narrative flew underneath the radar, which I think probably should have been more pronounced. The net net of it is this bank was the 16th largest bank based on bank deposits, had over $200 billion of bank deposits on its balance sheet. At time of FDIC receivership, 90 plus percent of that was uninsured bank deposits, which means that every account that you have has a $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance.
00:04:28.034 - 00:05:38.950, Speaker C: Because most of these were companies that were using these accounts as literally places to keep the money that they just raised until they have to make payroll. That was most of what this use case for this bank was or it was lines of credit, but it was banking services built for early stage companies, which means that you don't have the flexibility of being a publicly. Traded company or something the size of Google, where you've got ten different banking partners and you've got 100 different bank accounts that you're using for different use cases depending on the business lines or the use cases that you need to be storing or sending money. And so you had a lot of the concentration risk of Silicon Valley Bank in a lot of these tech companies and making payroll is one of the largest, sorry, it's one of the highest things on the preference stack. If you fail to make payroll, it's potentially even higher than most of the debt that you would raise. That would be a liability that you have on the balance sheet greater than basically the available value or assets within the company itself. So when you can't make payroll, you effectively have to shut down operations.
00:05:38.950 - 00:06:46.746, Speaker C: And not making payroll was something that we were looking at for a lot of companies or a lot of our friends companies if they weren't going to be able to receive payment within an order of like a week or two. So it got to be pretty dire, especially when nobody really knew what was going on. The narrative at the time was, is the Silicon Valley, and we're not going to bail out the Silicon Valley fat cats. And in reality, I think it flipped. One of the interesting points that I think is worth calling out, and this was talked about, I think, by Tarun earlier, but Elizabeth Warren seemed to change her tone very rapidly over the weekend. And I think part of that had to do with the fact that Silicon Valley Bank bought Boston Private, which is one of the larger providers of credit to the biotech ecosystem in Massachusetts, which is obviously a constituency of Elizabeth Warren. And so the second that it turned from, oh, I'm not going to step up, kill the bank that is servicing Silicon Valley into, oh, my constituency is going to be directly impacted.
00:06:46.746 - 00:07:04.510, Speaker C: And this isn't just tech. This is biotech, and this is entrepreneurship. And growth tone really changed pretty quickly. So I think the outcome is a lot more positive. But basically from Friday until Sunday afternoon, nobody knew what was going to happen on Monday.
00:07:04.590 - 00:07:18.862, Speaker B: I actually have a legal question about that. Just about so if a company can't make payroll, just obviously people like getting paid. So it's very distressing for a company when that can't happen. But is there a legal event that triggers and is essentially like a default on the bonds?
00:07:19.026 - 00:07:41.994, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. Payroll is a protected asset for employees, and if you're not able to I mean, there are things that people have done historically where it's like, hey, listen, just wait this out with us. We'll pay you in a month. We'll pay you 1.5 times what we're going to pay you in a month, but you have to go employee by employee and make those deals.
00:07:42.042 - 00:08:11.338, Speaker A: Specifically, I went to dinner on Saturday night with a Budy whose company had 100% of their assets, including even their credit cards in SVB. And it depends on which state you're kind of HQ'd in, but most boards have to get board insurance because if you don't get payroll as an employee, you can sue the living hell out of your board of directors. So that's what he was I mean, he was obviously worried about making payroll, but they were worried about lawsuits actually coming from employees, too, especially in a.
00:08:11.344 - 00:08:17.260, Speaker D: State like, yep, thank God Jason Calcanus stepped in.
00:08:17.790 - 00:08:22.938, Speaker A: Our Savior. Our Lord and Savior. Did you guys see the clip of him on YouTube?
00:08:23.034 - 00:09:00.722, Speaker D: Dude, the histrionics just incredible. That's kind of the funniest. Yeah. Silicon Valley Bank. In my mind, I think of it as a bailout just because when you're a bank and somebody comes to withdraw and you either don't have the money or you have to get shut down, generally someone has to give you the money for you to restart operations, someone has to bail you out. But that kind of doesn't fully understand the context of where their balance sheet was, which was in a bad place. But you're not looking at zeros, you're probably looking at 60% to 90% recovery in time with people getting a 50% dividend the next week.
00:09:00.722 - 00:09:31.460, Speaker D: That was one of the first things that was known. But just the histrionics continued and I think that is part of what a drove a lot of the response unironically in some ways and b forced a lot of other banks to have these same deposit run problems. But yeah, it's very interesting to see people either think of this as a bailout or something that the Federal Reserve is way overstepping their jurisdiction on. I think it's frankly a little bit of both.
00:09:31.910 - 00:10:27.042, Speaker C: I think it's tough so just to play devil's advocate there, I think it's tough to call this a bailout in the sense of historically a bailout. In my mind, and this is definitionally, we can talk about semantics, but bailout implies that you're having the taxpayers flip the bill for this. And in reality, what this is, is all the other banks who put into the FDIC every year, they have an insurance fund and I think it's a total of like $100 billion in the insurance fund and that is what they're using as the short term liquidity to be able to safeguard these assets for a year. So basically the payers of this loss are all the other banks. So all of the systemically important banks you have to pay prorata into this thing. So JP. Morgan is probably the largest payer, I think, of covering the bill here.
00:10:27.042 - 00:10:38.322, Speaker C: But it is kind of different in that it's not going to be something that's borne by the taxpayer. So I don't know, maybe semantics is semantics, but it does feel like it's very different from what we've seen historically from bailouts.
00:10:38.466 - 00:11:25.014, Speaker B: I think the other thing that's important to note as well, the bailouts happened in 2008 that protected equity shareholders as well, right? So everyone kept their I mean, you took a massive hit, but people kept their equity value, the management kept their jobs. There were gigantic bonuses that were paid to these people. I think basically SVB is a wipeout on equity and a lot of people lost. I'm not actually sure what's going to happen to everyone there, but I assume a lot of people are going to lose their jobs, like the stock sales of the CEO. I think that's going to be clawed back and I think it's sufficiently punitive to not create an environment for moral hazard, which is the worry when it comes to bailout. So I'm kind of in that camp as well, that I think it's sufficiently punitive that I don't think people are going to look at this and say, yeah, we can be as risk free as we want.
00:11:25.132 - 00:11:59.422, Speaker D: I think what's interesting now is in my mind, just the hole wasn't that big in Silicon Valley Bank, like, say in an alternate universe. We were just forced to work it out amongst ourselves. I still think the recovery percentage would have been extremely, extremely high. Juxtapose that to crypto where Celsius and FTX claims are trading like ten to $0.20. It's just like a different ballgame in terms of how severe the situation was versus what the histrionics were and what the general cultural response has been. And now you look on CNBC and just interested to hear your guys perspectives. But Tom Lee this morning threw in the towel on being bullish.
00:11:59.422 - 00:12:12.086, Speaker D: He is one of the most permeable guys that you can possibly find. There's literally nobody bullish anymore. People are thinking this is a large scale banking crisis, and I would probably put ODS on that not being the case.
00:12:12.188 - 00:12:26.074, Speaker A: See that's now I'm feeling more bullish now than I have been in the last several months. I feel like what this event did is it maybe turned the Fed's desire to keep hiking rates up, turned it around.
00:12:26.192 - 00:12:31.798, Speaker C: So let's clarify. Bullish on what? Bullish on the US economy or bullish on asset prices?
00:12:31.894 - 00:12:32.694, Speaker B: Asset prices.
00:12:32.742 - 00:12:33.830, Speaker A: Asset prices, right.
00:12:33.920 - 00:12:34.558, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:12:34.724 - 00:12:42.310, Speaker B: But that's been that case for a while. It's like bad news is good news. Bad news for the economy is good news for asset prices and vice versa.
00:12:42.490 - 00:13:12.454, Speaker D: Yes, but it's so dispersed now. So let's talk about three different parts of or three different types of investors. Wall street guys, Super Bearish, they're in the camp of this is the beginning of 2008. This is going to get really bad. There's going to be a credit freeze, and there's like some data that would suggest that is the case where yesterday Scent and Dare tried to sell a billion dollars worth of subprime auto loans. And they make these loans and then they cut them up and syndicate them. There were no buyers on the other side.
00:13:12.454 - 00:13:31.546, Speaker D: It was supposed to be led by Citigroups. They just shut down the bond sale. Maybe it does turn into this large credit crisis. Frankly, we're not the people to probably make that call. So you have those people then think about tech people, like traditional Web 2.0 people. I think there's some excitement there that things are going to be moving in a more positive direction.
00:13:31.546 - 00:14:10.250, Speaker D: The Fed might be more of a tailwind and certain things. And Michael and I were talking about this yesterday, where it's like ten X next twelve months revenue. Things don't really work at that multiple, but if it's like twelve X or 13 X, a lot of these growth companies start to be like public company candidates, so they're marginally more bullish. But people have been deploying $100 billion in adventure backed companies for a decade. There's a lot of stuff that you need to sort out in that industry before you can really have a wholesale. This is going to be a good thing type vibe. And then in crypto, crypto just seems to be the sponge for all the excess liquidity where people say that they're going to print 2 trillion and crypto prices as if that's going to go at least partially to them.
00:14:10.250 - 00:14:27.454, Speaker D: You just don't have that same dynamic kind of anywhere else. I would say we're now the most bullish probably relative to anybody than we have been in the past two years. Like, think about last year. Everyone else was relatively like, the real economy is okay, but crypto is going to really take a dive. And that was true. Now it's the opposite.
00:14:27.502 - 00:15:12.366, Speaker C: There's another variable here too, which Tom Lee obviously notable because he's a crypto fan and integrates the crypto economy into his analysis of where he's a bullish perspective or a bearish perspective. But the one thing that he focuses more on is the global equities markets. And I think as you look at this in terms of what's going to happen for equities, let's assume that we start to head into more of a banking crisis. This is just the start, it's not the end. And we start to see actual cuts. And I saw somewhere, I think by end of 2023, some of the forecasts are that there's actually going to be three to four cuts, let alone increases. Like there are net three to four cuts by the end of this year.
00:15:12.366 - 00:16:07.582, Speaker C: And that is pricing in a pretty serious recession, a pretty serious change of pace for the economy. And the way that economy and assets can relate is when you start to see earnings actually deflate relative to the price to earnings expectations. Maybe the price to earnings ratio or the price to revenue, as Vance was saying, ten to twelve X revenue, maybe that goes up, those metrics go up. But when revenue and earnings decrease more so than the multiples going up, you're going to start to see a deflation in asset values as well. So I generally think you can't say general bullish or bearish perspective. You have to talk about which subset of the markets or which subset of the equation you're really referring to. I think bullish crypto is definitely the sentiment coming out of this neutral equities, depending on how earnings and revenue growth can persist.
00:16:07.582 - 00:16:49.598, Speaker C: A lot of these companies have been taking the preemptive cuts. You talk about salesforce, meta, Google, everybody's making the cuts as if this recession was coming from a year ago. Probably bullish bonds as well. Just given that you're going to be able to know prices come back with decreasing yield or decreasing interest rates, wouldn't it be funny if Silicon Valley bank's bond portfolio, the one that's underwater right now, actually becomes closer to par if yields go back down? And so I think generally there are different subsets that we have to talk about. But it does look like the market is pricing in that this is just the start, not the end.
00:16:49.684 - 00:17:28.166, Speaker B: So this graphic here, by the way, it's a little bit out of date. It's from earlier this week, March 13, so even a couple of days ago. But this is basically showing what Fed Funds futures was pricing in based on three different time periods. The 27 January, the eigth of March, and then the 13 March. And you can see how much it's just a very uncertain market. So basically, back at the tail end of January, there was a certain path for rates, which you can see in that black bar. Then just about a month later, you see the gray bars here and the market was pricing in a much more hawkish trajectory for rates.
00:17:28.166 - 00:18:12.870, Speaker B: This was after Powell kind of gave his speech. And now you can see from this week the market has drastically readjusted and basically the thinking know, this is kind of what Jason was saying. And I think this is what the market is trying to figure out. The is the stress in the banking system enough for the Federal Reserve to take its foot off the gas and just know you brought Liz Warren. I mean, she tweeted something out basically intimating that Powell had pushed things too far. And for whatever you think about Liz Warren, I think she's actually a pretty good zeitgeist of where the political opinion is sort of at. And I think this is going to be the challenge for markets is like, inflation is still relatively hot, although PPI came in weak this week, which is a forward looking indicator.
00:18:12.870 - 00:18:27.370, Speaker B: CPI was like dead at expectations. So then it's like, does stress in the banking sector outweigh still a six handle on CPI? And that's the question that I think markets are trying to look through and no one really knows.
00:18:27.450 - 00:19:04.342, Speaker C: I completely agree. I think the evaluation here is what's going on versus what's going on in the banking crisis, what's going on with inflation? And it's not the perfect benchmark in any way, shape or form, but we track the internally at framework. We look at the Fed now or the now casting from the Cleveland Fed. They've been overshooting expectations for the last three months. And right now, as of today, March 16, now cast for CPI is, I think, 0.3 month over month. And that's really what matters.
00:19:04.342 - 00:19:07.094, Speaker C: So it does look like March is going to be softer.
00:19:07.142 - 00:19:54.974, Speaker A: Guys, can we pivot to talk about USDC? Because I want to get your guys'take on that. One thing that's been interesting is like, you saw a lot of the large funds start dumping USDC. So then Mike and I were having a conversation about, okay, for a lot of these institutions that maybe have tighter regulatory risks and larger compliance teams, legally they can hold it. But is USDC worth the risk of holding now? And will they maybe for a firm that used to hold 20% USDC, do they just say it's not worth it. We'll go from 20% to 2% USDC and just hold the rest in a BNY account in cash. What's your guys'second order impact takeaways from this USDC deepgging?
00:19:55.042 - 00:20:23.694, Speaker D: I think most of the large holders of USDC are hyper profitable market makers within crypto. And so I would be surprised if they just know we can do this with less units of USDC. I honestly don't think the long term impacts will be that big. They resolved it quickly. They resolved it in a weekend. They had a new transactional bank and then had a new cash custodian by Monday. That's like pretty impressive just from a risk and operational standpoint.
00:20:23.694 - 00:21:01.870, Speaker D: And Jeremy Alair is on CNBC and he's pleading his case and it seems increasingly clear that the banking system is turning towards crypto, not against like I think they tried to basically kill crypto with all these banks. I've said this before, I think it's going to backfire. So I'm like pretty we hold a lot of USDC. We hold USDC personally. We're definitely not selling our exposure. I think you could see that capital come back on chain in the form of maybe things like ondo T bills or different real world assets. There's also the point where yields are not where they used to be.
00:21:01.870 - 00:21:15.618, Speaker D: That's not going to be as big of a selling point going forward. And so that's not a USDC point. But things like makers printing die and giving it to different custodians to buy T bills, that's probably not going to be that interesting a strategy in the.
00:21:15.624 - 00:21:19.686, Speaker B: Next year, after the next personally or.
00:21:19.708 - 00:21:24.760, Speaker A: Why does framework hold USDC when you could just put it in cash? What is the reason?
00:21:25.530 - 00:22:02.098, Speaker D: I mean, what type of cash? Bank account, cash, coinbase, USD. If you put it in the bank account, you have to transfer it. Like banking as you know, right now is a little bit touch and go, like not super excited to put more money into regional banks. I think there's a lot of reasons why you would want to hold USDC right now. I think this weekend has kind of made USDC the de facto bank of crypto right now. Because if you're an average startup or a company and your money's in Signature or Silicon Valley Bank or Silvergate, it's probably safer to just have it in USDC relative to those options at this point.
00:22:02.264 - 00:22:43.326, Speaker C: Just one quick point of like we are, as we've talked about, a qualified custodian with the SEC, which means that or sorry, we are a registered investment advisor with the SEC. We have to keep our assets at a qualified custodian. We are definitely not a qualified custodian, but the difference there is keeping money in a bank account is fine. That's definitely a qualified custodian. Keeping USDC within Coinbase Prime or Anchorage also satisfies the qualified custodian role, at least as of now. If we were to not be holding assets in the prime account or in the qualified custodian account. That's totally different.
00:22:43.326 - 00:23:08.858, Speaker C: And so now it's a question of like, okay, what's the safest place? If we have issues with banks over the level of 250K, where's the best place to keep it? That I think, is a tough question to answer, especially when you've got a regulatory obligation to the SEC. So there is a lot of interesting kind of game theory that we've been thinking through as well.
00:23:09.024 - 00:23:19.500, Speaker B: Safest place to keep it is in Tether. Didn't you see? It was rock solid all weekend, didn't even move. Kind of crazy how that happened.
00:23:21.170 - 00:23:25.658, Speaker D: I think USDC has gotten a lot stronger as a result this weekend. Not weaker.
00:23:25.834 - 00:23:49.394, Speaker C: Yeah, and just to like I know we're talking about USDC. I completely agree. I think the Dpegging was an anomaly, but was also a feature, not a bug as we talked about. The other thing that I think is worth talking about that kind of got swept up in this whole process is the closure of Signature.
00:23:49.522 - 00:23:52.440, Speaker B: I agree with you. Yeah, I agree with you on.
00:23:54.890 - 00:25:21.026, Speaker C: Necessarily I have not, at least to date, worn a tinfoil hat on this podcast yet. But my tinfoil hat perspective is, and it came out today, reuters said that they had two sources suggesting that whoever buys Signature Bank is going to have to agree to not continue the crypto practice once they buy the bank. And the whole rumor over the weekend was on Sunday was, why are you targeting the number two largest crypto specific bank which had Sidnet, which is the equivalent of the Silvergate Exchange network where you had real time payments in and out? So that was number one. And then Tom Emmer today actually had a very interesting perspective which he shared, which was the same time that Signature Bank was closed. The Fed was talking about how the fact that they are going to be releasing the Fed Now payment network later this summer. And is this a case where you have the government competing against the private sector for the service that they're going to be providing for instant payments? So Fed Now is going to be instant payment settlement with US dollars supposedly. And USDC was in the payments that are happening in real time within the crypto ecosystem were facilitated by Signature as well as Silvergate before that happened.
00:25:21.026 - 00:25:48.982, Speaker C: But kind of an interesting perspective just to think, well, is this something where it was a targeted attack on Signature bank? Blockchain Association, I believe, has already filed a FOIA request, so we'll ultimately get to the bottom of this. And I just thought that it was really interesting to see confirmation of the rumor that the crypto bank or the crypto business at the bank seems to be the exact component that was in the crosshairs here.
00:25:49.036 - 00:26:11.058, Speaker D: This seems like a class, classic move from our government where they're like, yeah, we're going to release Fed now. You're never going to have to talk to a banker again. None of your wires are going to get flagged again. It's going to be just like USDC. It's like no, it's not the same thing at all. Being able to have permissionless payments versus having slightly faster ones. If that is the case, that is such a folly just to pivot to a little bit of crypto stuff as well.
00:26:11.058 - 00:26:13.330, Speaker D: It looks like we have a date for Shanghai.
00:26:13.750 - 00:26:14.750, Speaker C: April twelveTH.
00:26:14.830 - 00:26:20.390, Speaker D: April twelveTH. Nice blockwork scoop. Let's go, baby.
00:26:20.730 - 00:27:01.314, Speaker B: That's phenomenal. The last point that I want just on the Signature bank thing, one of the members of the board was a guy named Barney Frank. And Barney Frank is one of the guys who is right in the name Dodd Frank, which was the sort of sweeping regulatory overhaul that came to the banking system after the great financial crisis. He was on the board of Signature and he intimated that he didn't understand why Signature got closed. And just as a differentiator for how Signature got treated versus other banks that had their stock trading in a distressed way, which Credit Suisse is still doing. But First Republic wasn't made to close down. Right.
00:27:01.314 - 00:27:27.014, Speaker B: What's happening there is that first of all deposits were guaranteed at SVB and then it looks like First Republic there are reports today, we're quoting this on Thursday, but it looks like they're going to be acquired by a larger and that's it feels like that's what should have happened with Signature. So it's kind of unclear why this was just closed right out of the blue with no explanation.
00:27:27.142 - 00:27:33.834, Speaker D: What is that? Is that five now? Six? What's the count? Signature.
00:27:33.882 - 00:27:34.394, Speaker C: Silver.
00:27:34.522 - 00:27:37.982, Speaker D: Silicon Valley. First Republic. I guess Credit Suisse would be five.
00:27:38.036 - 00:27:40.480, Speaker C: I mean, Mike, it's really not clear.
00:27:41.730 - 00:27:44.100, Speaker B: I don't have my tinfoil hat, so I can't say.
00:27:46.150 - 00:28:29.834, Speaker C: Listen, I think it feels like all of the tea leaves are pointing in one direction. And I also think that they tried to take a shot. We found other banks and banking partners and this business is going to go somewhere. It's not like, oh, you cut off the bank and the business dies. We can't find another one. It's like we've got backups and we've got a lot of others that are waiting to take over the deposits. I mean, what was the number that there was $15 billion of additional deposits into bank of America when all this went down? Someone's going to want to take down that know going to take a shot that's not missed.
00:28:29.882 - 00:28:32.670, Speaker A: Do you guys read the New York Mag article with Barney Frank?
00:28:33.010 - 00:28:33.518, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:33.604 - 00:28:57.400, Speaker A: Did you read that article? I haven't read it. I've read part of mean it's worth mean. They never admitted that Signature was insolvent. They claimed that Signature didn't give them sufficient data, which was the reason they wanted to nationalize the bank. It was just a bizarre it's like you don't shut down the bank because they didn't provide sufficient data.
00:28:58.730 - 00:29:00.630, Speaker C: Signature was a. Publicly traded company.
00:29:00.700 - 00:29:08.460, Speaker A: No, he admitted he said that signature was ready and able to open on Monday and that it probably would have been fine. I was like, what are you saying?
00:29:09.310 - 00:29:15.306, Speaker C: So if you're a shareholder in that company, what do you do? Do you band together and form a class action?
00:29:15.338 - 00:29:20.880, Speaker B: And I would assume class action lawsuit. Yeah, for sure, I guess. Yeah.
00:29:21.890 - 00:29:54.214, Speaker D: I mean, it is kind of funny that I did read that part about the bad data or the sloppy data or whatever. It's kind of just like, are you guys really keeping all this shit in Google spreadsheets or something? This is kind of I know, like, yeah, a Google spreadsheet of my balance sheet. I do have sympathy for Barney Frank, but he also was very anti crypto, and then his pro crypto bank got confiscated by regulators. I'm sorry that that didn't work out for you, but you kind of had some bad karma.
00:29:54.262 - 00:29:56.810, Speaker B: You guys want to talk about the announcement of the announcement.
00:29:59.970 - 00:30:02.654, Speaker C: The biggest crypto news to happen in the last seven days?
00:30:02.772 - 00:30:33.250, Speaker B: Yeah, well, talking here, obviously, about the Arbitrum AirDrop. So there was a video that the guy released that confirmed what a lot of people already suspected, that there's going to be an AirDrop for Arbitrum. And I think that's scheduled to go live. The target dropped, it would be March 23. So next week the total supply for Arbitrum is going to be 10 billion. And the AirDrop, the allocation is 1.15 billion for the AirDrop.
00:30:33.250 - 00:31:08.210, Speaker B: So 11.5%. And then I think there's some amount that's also allocated to there's 1.1% that's going to be allocated to Dows, like Dows protocols that built on top of Arbitrum and then there's a good portion that's allocated to kind of investors, the team and the community or the treasury? The treasury? Rather. It's hard to know because we don't know valuation yet. Any just thoughts on, I guess how the allocation was structured and the announcement announcements or whatever?
00:31:08.360 - 00:32:00.100, Speaker C: I think it's always kind of funny when you go back to think about where did just common business best practice, best practices stem from, and you think about a four year vesting schedule for most employees at companies. Where does that come from? It happens to come from some weird employment rule, but that just became commonplace. Anyways, what I'm trying to get at is somehow for some reason, uniswap decided to do an AirDrop for 12%. And it seems like the new norm is that give or take 12% to the community or to users in a retroactive, AirDrop is the norm of what people target. Now, that was my first reading of this without even looking at it. It was like, oh, let me guess, 12% AirDrop. And of course that's what it is.
00:32:00.100 - 00:32:31.086, Speaker C: So I think that was kind of one of the interesting points. But yeah, I mean, it's going to be really interesting to see how they distribute it. I think Op just as, like, a direct competitor comparison to Arbitrum, had a pretty novel way of not only just the Token distribution, but also the Token governance model. So I'll be very curious to see kind of how this all plays out in relation to that. But yeah, is it all to be.
00:32:31.108 - 00:32:36.110, Speaker D: Great or is it all, like, immediately tradable?
00:32:37.810 - 00:32:43.120, Speaker B: No, I don't think so. Not the profits allocated to the team.
00:32:44.050 - 00:32:46.160, Speaker D: Oh, I'm just talking about the AirDrop itself.
00:32:47.430 - 00:33:06.194, Speaker C: The AirDrop itself, I believe, is I don't know if the Dows are or how that would work. Kind of the same thing for Op, where you had to submit a request for Op distribution to the Dow Treasury. That was building on top of optimism. But I think the AirDrop to users will be tradable immediately.
00:33:06.242 - 00:33:35.550, Speaker D: I mean, number one, huge wealth creation event. If it's 10% of the supply, and it's probably going to trade between who knows if it's optimism, I guess it'd be like one to one and a half dollars. That's $1.5 billion of wealth creation right there. And let's see if it stays there, that'll go into reinforcing the crypto economy. It also just paints a huge target on these L2 S back. Like, everyone is going to launch an L two if the prize is ten to $20 billion, it kind of makes sense.
00:33:35.620 - 00:34:52.334, Speaker B: I have a question for you guys that I'm quite sure I'm going to end up looking stupid on, but I'm going to ask it anyway. I'm trying to think through one of the big differences, it seems like to me, with the funding model of a protocol versus the funding model of, let's say an early stage startup, is the sequential series of equity raises versus on the launch of a token, you just have one some number that's into infinity. So we were talking the other day about circulating supply or market cap versus fully diluted valuation. And I'm trying to reason this out in my head because one of the differences here, right, is what they're essentially trying to do with the fully diluted valuation is because you're only doing a capital raise one time. You're basically trying to parse out, like, this is the amount of capital that I'm going to need to raise over the total course of the life of this protocol, as opposed to with a company. You'd be like, all right, I'm going to raise $10 million in my Series A, maybe at 100 million dollar valuation, and then I'm going to raise 20 million. My Series B, 200 million dollar valuation isn't ultimately like, pick some period in time, but the fully diluted valuation would be like, whatever the valuation is at your Series D and then the total amount of capital that you raise.
00:34:52.334 - 00:35:02.942, Speaker B: Do you see what I'm saying? I'm trying to reason this out, but how do you guys kind of think about that? It's just a weird I've tried to think about a lot, but it's difficult to wrap your head around.
00:35:03.076 - 00:36:09.202, Speaker D: We've only seen one protocol live through the whole lifecycle of raising capital in a fixed supply token and getting to a point where the network is profitable. And either the protocol is complete, like, you don't need continual rounds of funding, so you're not continually depleting, in this case, the Ethereum Foundation's Treasury, or you have the asset be so profitable that you can stake it and earn yield. And it doesn't just dilute everyone out in perpetuity. And so we've only seen this happen once, and this is kind of why, at least I think, that if you're going to be a protocol, you need to have, like, an end date where either the maintenance costs go down significantly or you don't need to iterate on the protocol anymore. But I think the crux of your point is, how did they just print $20 billion? It's only 10% circulating. What happens to this money? We've seen very few successful cases of people being able to, over time, grow into these valuations on fundamental metrics. It's not impossible, and I think we're going to see more people do it as we find out what the right playbooks are.
00:36:09.202 - 00:36:22.194, Speaker D: To Michael's point about where do best practices come from, but especially for these L2 S, and we're an investor in optimism who's a competitor, but the value capture angle not the same as Ethereum.
00:36:22.242 - 00:36:52.160, Speaker A: It feels like a remnant of bitcoin, honestly. Right. That's why we all do these hard caps, one time launch or fixed supply launches, and it feels like a remnant of just Bitcoin's 21 million cap. But I think it's something that folks should probably actually reconsider, is like, does it make more sense to raise, like, a traditional series A, series B, series C, instead of just doing one big drop at as high of a valuation as possible?
00:36:52.950 - 00:37:04.626, Speaker C: But fundamentally or tactically, how would that happen? Because you basically have a tradable value for this, because once you release the.
00:37:04.648 - 00:37:09.606, Speaker A: Token one time, then it's liquid, then it gets priced, and then you can't yeah, I see what you're saying.
00:37:09.788 - 00:37:51.074, Speaker D: What people do is they bail themselves out with inflation. If it's like, if you need additional tokens, okay, they go back to the treasury, okay. The treasury gets approached by somebody, okay, we're going to sell more. So you do have a lot of the corporate model that exists in web two? In web3, but we've really never run an experiment where an early stage company prints a $20 billion full of duty valuation, gives 2 billion to the community, and then tries to build the activation to bring them onto the L two, because that's really the reward you get for doing this. Is your DEXes get TVL. Your games are incentivized to come there. You can spin up a studio an incubator, but it's a finite advantage because your fully diluted and circulating are going to converge one to one.
00:37:51.074 - 00:38:14.140, Speaker D: Eventually and you better have utility profitability or something to keep people interested in the project. But that is like probably a two to four year down the line thing that they'll have to go through because once the investors unlock and once the team know everyone is on equal can and it has changed a lot of the dynamics of these networks over time.
00:38:15.870 - 00:38:50.630, Speaker C: That, to your point, Mike, is one of the things that we evaluate a lot, which is if you're looking at the value of a sorry. If you're looking at the market cap versus the total fully diluted value, those are two very important metrics to look at. Just because when you have 80% of the supply that still has, or in this case, 87% of the supply that still has to be unlocked, that's a major variable that you have to deal with, you have to account for. And that's something that you're going to have as a changing of the market dynamics of that token over the lifetime.
00:38:52.490 - 00:39:39.250, Speaker D: ETH was the first one to get to default profitability and basically the need to, if there was some maintenance, do it, but it wasn't sucking all the resources out of the protocol via dumping tokens. The next ones that are doing it are all the DeFi protocols. I can't express how good it is to see all the DFI OGS maker synthetics curve uniswap lido synthetics. What do you think going to be profitable this year? Michael they made, I think, 2 million in fees last week and there was a lot of liquidations and fees and volume. Lido is probably going to get 50 to 100 million uniswap. We'll see if they turn on the fee switch maker I'm a little bit more suspect on because they're just like taking printed internet money and giving it to people to buy T bills with. But you're starting to see the second generation of companies figure this out after Ethereum.
00:39:39.250 - 00:40:01.774, Speaker D: And I think that is wildly positive because that's like when you saw Ethereum kind of like re rate to bitcoin back in, I think, like 2020 because it was like 0.3 for a long time, it was because the network had fundamentals. So I'm hopeful that that continues. And it's awesome to see the first generation of people that are like, really diehard d five people actually making real businesses out of it good to see.
00:40:01.812 - 00:40:04.938, Speaker A: Synthetics specifically nice all week for synthetics.
00:40:05.034 - 00:40:19.986, Speaker D: It'S been a comeback and bumpy and crazy and we were one of the first protocols to get remember the Korean wand hack? Michael someone printed a trillion dollars of Korean wand on synthetics and tried to hold the protocol hostage. This was like four years ago.
00:40:20.088 - 00:40:21.474, Speaker B: You got to get a screenshot of.
00:40:21.512 - 00:40:45.386, Speaker D: And like, this was the first time. Michael it was like the world was ending, but there's been so many twists and turns and do you remember when people were front running the Oracle? But now it's like the system's fast, it's cheap, it has a lot of different pairs, it has perps, it's powering options. The real diehard people that win the niches are going to absolutely do phenomenal awesome to see.
00:40:45.568 - 00:41:23.186, Speaker C: And just to hammer this point home, here's a prediction I think where DFI 1.0 was all about TVL, what we're going to start to see is that DFI 2.0, which has yet to really kind of hit the fever pitch, is all going to be about cash flows. And re rating two cash flows is going to be a really important market efficiency that you can compare it against ethereum. Ethereum will be the benchmark essentially. But you're going to look at Lido, you're going to look at maker, you're going to look at synthetics uniswap and compare cash flows on cash flows. And I think a lot of the DFI llamas and token terminals are already moving in this direction as the best point of comparison.
00:41:23.186 - 00:41:26.854, Speaker C: But I think that that becomes the new metric of DFI 2.0.
00:41:26.892 - 00:41:46.666, Speaker B: Now this might vary protocol to protocol, but the metric that I've sort of heard used there as one to pay attention to is the dollar produced per dollar of TVL that you have for it. So for every dollar of TVL that you have, how much revenue are you able to produce off of it? Then you subtract the operating cost and that's your cash flow. Just depends.
00:41:46.698 - 00:42:00.862, Speaker D: If TVL is really like a metric that you're looking for, it should just be cash flows, right? And if they're super inefficient cash flows, like a bank, like something that looks like a bank probably just get valued at like a book value or like a lower multiple.
00:42:01.006 - 00:42:29.446, Speaker C: Well, I think Mike, you're right and you can compare those, but you can only compare those across different business models. You can't compare derivatives exchange to a lending protocol because those are going to have wildly different TVLs. But the cash flows may be the same just like a Lido Staking protocol versus a GMX. Those are just going to be two very different ecosystems with different metrics. But the one that you can measure is what's the cost, what's the fully diluted market cap and what's the cash flows?
00:42:29.558 - 00:42:43.970, Speaker B: Yeah, well, just one clarifying question actually. When you say cash flows, what exactly is that net profitability? Cash flow to me means like dollars.
00:42:44.040 - 00:43:19.754, Speaker D: In and out, net profitability, net of incentives. So you look at things like synthetics, there really are not that many incentives driving the growth and I'm not going to pick on any other individual derivatives exchanges, but if you look at some of the other ones it's like incentives on many days are higher than what the fees they're generating are. Yeah, so that's the other thing you really care about, especially as to our earlier conversation, a lot of these incentives wind down as the circulating and fully polluted market caps converge. Those are just very expensive dollars to now allocate to growth programs and things like that.
00:43:19.792 - 00:44:03.260, Speaker B: So I've got a question for you, because the reason I maybe have heard this particular metric like the amount of TVL that it takes to produce $1, is because I'd be looking at kind of scalability of the business. Because let's just take a business where let's just say TVL is directionally the driver of how much revenue a protocol can generate. If there is a protocol that has a billion in TVL and you're able to generate, let's say, $50 million in revenue, that looks very different to me than the same business that generates 50 million in revenue, but you need 25 billion of TVL in order to do that. Because to me, as an investor, I'm like, jeez, there's just a limited amount that that revenue stream can really scale then.
00:44:03.630 - 00:44:49.194, Speaker C: Totally. But that's kind of like saying, okay, let's compare Apple's top line revenue with Google's and Apple. You've got to factor in the actual gross margin of the physical products that they're selling, whereas Google gross margin is going to be 80%. Or let's compare that with the GMV of Airbnb and say, okay, you've got a marketplace dynamic. Net revenue is going to be whatever blended, like 18, 19% of that GMV, whatever their fees are. But you have to take each individual business model and say, okay, let's break it down and compare apples to apples and yeah, sure, Google is probably one of the best business models ever invented in Humankind because of the fact that you have an 80% gross margin that's going to be a component of this evaluation process as well.
00:44:49.232 - 00:45:38.070, Speaker B: Do you guys want to talk about the billion dollar CZ investment? Little note that he dropped. Oh, wait, sorry. Actually, one thing to mention as well is in addition to the AirDrop, Arbitrum actually announced first of all that there's going to be a Dow. And then they also announced something called Arbitrum Orbit. So Arbitrum Orbit is basically their solution that will allow developers to build layer threes on top of Arbitrum, which I think is pretty we've talked about the app chain thesis and idea. We've been covering it in this last season of Bell Curve as well. But this seems like something that looks kind of similar actually to the Op optimism sort of solution of these app chain type environments.
00:45:38.810 - 00:46:15.906, Speaker D: We've had so many projects look at Coinbase and Arbitrum and be like, that's what I want to do. Make an L three on Coinbase, or use the Op Bedrock stack to or sorry, use an L three on Arbitrum, or use Bedrock Op stack to build on Coinbase. It feels like that is now the path of least resistance if you want your own app chain, just like the tooling is, that good. Not that anything else is happening, but for Cosmos and Tendermint, those are still nine month, twelve month development cycles from what we can tell. So these products are just going to go to where it's easiest for them to build and it looks increasingly like it's going to be yeah.
00:46:15.928 - 00:46:26.550, Speaker A: Mike, you just did whole season on App chain thesis. How are you thinking with Arbitrum op stack? Coinbase. Coinbase's base. Like, how do you think about where apps want to build?
00:46:26.620 - 00:47:18.134, Speaker B: I think it just depends on what's important to you. I do still think the thing that you get in the Cosmos Arena that you can't get building on a layer three or something like that is you get full sovereignty, right? So when you own everything from the nodes, the validators, all the way up to the applicant, you control every part of that. So you own a lot of flexibility. I think that the challenge there is you don't have a natural or obvious source of distribution. That's kind of the challenge. And then you make the entire stack of your products subject to governance, which in some cases can be really good, but it's also a lot of surface area of governance. And one thing that, to be honest, I am still kind of thinking through is maybe this was kind of Jason, what you and I explored in season two.
00:47:18.134 - 00:47:52.478, Speaker B: But it's like maybe governance is really optimized to only be very good for one very thin layer of decision making. And then there are going to be companies that build products like wallets. You know what I mean? Because a company is much more centralized and it makes sense that a company might build a wallet, but maybe you want the underlying financial architecture underneath that to be decentralized and less prone to have perceived neutrality or not be able to be impacted by governments that might not like how the software functions.
00:47:52.574 - 00:48:26.960, Speaker C: Real Time News Update seems like $30 billion coming from eleven different banks are going to be deposited into First Republic Bank. So probably not going to be a sale, but going to be a backstopping maybe or just a partnership where $30 billion is going to flow into First Republic as new bank deposits from other banks. Basically it seems like everybody's getting together and just like locking arms and being like, we got this.
00:48:28.130 - 00:48:48.020, Speaker A: These are weird times though because bailing out. I saw Silicon Valley Bank tweeted out today or yesterday. They're like, there is no single safer place to keep or transfer your deposits than SVB. Now we're fully insured with no limits and no caps. So actually technically they're kind of right because they have unlimited FDIC insurance right now.
00:48:49.130 - 00:48:50.726, Speaker C: They are 100% correct.
00:48:50.828 - 00:49:06.650, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just a weird I was all for bailing them out or backstopping, whatever you want to call it. But now the unintended consequences, I don't know. I saw Brex did that like 200 million dollar thing with them. Something about that just feel I'm like there's no consequences.
00:49:09.550 - 00:49:51.580, Speaker C: What are you talking about? Keep in mind, so management team is out. They're all fired. They're going to get their bonuses and their stock sales probably clawed back. You got Roe on Meet the Press or wherever he was this morning talking about doing that. You've got an entire wipeout of all the bondholders, all the stockholders, they're completely fleeced down to zero. What you're effectively saving here is you're trying to have some residual value for the employees at the company who were not the ones making the decisions to maybe have a continuation of this business. Everybody else who had deep incentives to be aligned with the future progress of Silicon Valley Bank itself, they're gone.
00:49:51.580 - 00:50:14.094, Speaker C: I actually think that it's a contemplation that we had, which is like we're looking for other banks and we have probably three or four banks for each one of our different funds. Silicon Valley Bank was one of them. But if we had to put assets somewhere, it's kind of a weird perverse situation. To your exact point, it now has 100% FDIC insurance.
00:50:14.212 - 00:50:19.154, Speaker A: Just seems like weird market incentives that SVB is now the safest bank in the United States. Right?
00:50:19.352 - 00:50:30.438, Speaker B: Another honestly, this situation makes me ask a question, but it's a different one, which is if the Fed and the FDIC are just going to backstop everything, why do we need a commercial banking system?
00:50:30.524 - 00:51:15.122, Speaker D: Why do we need a Fed just going to follow the two year treasury? We can just use that. If we're doing layoffs in tech, I think we should streamline a lot of the financial infrastructure as I honestly, the libertarian side of me would have preferred no bailout. The part of me that has startups and had money in Silicon Valley Bank obviously preferred that. But they've created this knock on consequence where we had to bail out the banking system in 2008. What happens if we need to bail out the Federal Reserve when all of these banks start failing? It really is like this moral hazard type of scenario where Ken Griffin was saying know, we shouldn't have bailed them out, it wasn't that bad. They could have sorted amongst themselves. Maybe that is true.
00:51:15.122 - 00:51:22.600, Speaker D: It wouldn't have led to this feeling of like cool, we have the permanent bank backstop now, but what happens if that ever goes the other way?
00:51:24.570 - 00:51:31.482, Speaker C: Also keep in mind this implicit backstop only lasts for twelve months. It's not like this is a perpetual forever thing.
00:51:31.616 - 00:51:32.490, Speaker D: Temporary government.
00:51:32.560 - 00:51:37.290, Speaker B: Just like the reverse repo facility that was a temporary government program ten years ago.
00:51:37.440 - 00:51:41.482, Speaker D: Just for the one package of COVID stimulus that we needed. That led to four more.
00:51:41.616 - 00:51:55.540, Speaker B: For sure, they're going to be reducing the size of the Fed's balance sheet any day now. Any day for sure. They can't walk. I think that is the point though. They can never walk any of this stuff back.
00:51:57.670 - 00:52:15.222, Speaker C: This is a private company that's going to have to find a private solution. And if they don't, there won't be any incentive to continue on and batch stop this business not to mention who in the right mind if there isn't a future outcome here and isn't searching for other employment opportunities that currently works there.
00:52:15.276 - 00:52:41.870, Speaker D: Yeah, but these problems are going to continue to happen. I was reading this report that said the Social Security and pension and many of the pension plans are expected to be insolvent in nine years assuming no recession that is going to happen in four years. Like you can't just keep kicking the can down the road. You need to solve the problems before they happen or else you're just going to get this thing where everyone perpetually gets bailed out. And that is like the scenario where eventually you do need to backstop the fed. But with what?
00:52:42.020 - 00:52:44.958, Speaker B: By diluting the American shareholder holders of.
00:52:44.964 - 00:53:33.994, Speaker D: The currency, I think that know cutting federal programs backstop or not, you're not going to do that. So I don't know, maybe that's just like a little to do but I think the supply of money is going to increase if this is going to be the tax that you take with every single crisis and that's crypto. That's why I feel good. These are the things that as a fund manager you wait for we raise a fund, things really kind of fall apart you really get a shot at something that's low and then the Fed starts to ease. There are so many qualifications and caveats that you can put around it where if the economy really falls apart that's bad. But this is kind of the setup that you wait for, even though it's full of moral hazard and a lot of these institutions going the wrong way, in my opinion.
00:53:34.042 - 00:54:17.406, Speaker B: At a can you guys give us your opinion on because obviously when things were falling apart over the weekend with Silicon Valley Bank, crypto was ripping. And this is the charger sort of led by bitcoin, and bitcoin pump is basically just pumped since ank I don't have that chart in front of me, but since Saturday it's been on a tear and it's right around 25,000 now. I say bitcoin has been leading because bitcoin has been yeah, I think it's been the most print. It seems to move first. And the ETH BTC ratio is going the other way for the first time in a little while. Could you maybe just talk about why you think crypto reacted the way that it did? Is this a macro story or something.
00:54:17.428 - 00:54:57.610, Speaker D: Else original narrative the industry was built on and you have a resurgence of that. You have all the applications, adoption brand distribution, all that progress you've made in a decade plus and it's know we've already been through our version know hell last like that's when we really took it on the chin like Luna and FTX and Celsius and Voyager and now it's like we were kind of first people in. Makes sense that you're going to be first people out and on the ETH BTC ratio I just think frankly at Shanghai I don't know how much supply comes online, but the threat of that coming is enough to spook the market. And Susie is buying and I think he likes bitcoin more than he frankly.
00:54:58.110 - 00:56:07.262, Speaker C: Not to maybe speak to specifically this, but I think just like forecasting out one of the questions we got from one of our LPs who happened to be in the office yesterday was like, what's the catalyst that sends this back into a bull market? What are the things that we're looking for? And one of the things that we talked about was just, frankly, ETH being over like two k. The second that you get that what it does is it creates this reflexive flywheel of, like, okay, the value effect or the wealth effects of like, okay, now it's the primary capital asset. Things like lido are priced in terms of ETH. So you're going to have more revenue that's flowing to those types of ecosystems. People are paying for things in ETH. And historically, we've seen the quantity of ETH as ETH goes up, spent in the ethereum ecosystem increase as ETH goes up. And so I think there's also this element of, like, once you derisk and move past some of these big overhangs like Shanghai or Mount Gox or any of the things that we have on the horizon for 2023, there will be a real big kind of realization that we've moved past all the risks.
00:56:07.262 - 00:56:43.466, Speaker C: The banks are blowing themselves up, interest rates are probably coming down. Unclear about future prospects of the global or just US. Specific equities. Where is a good place to put some cash right now? Okay, to Vance's point, maybe it's the place that got literally hit the hardest in 2022 and is showing the greatest signs of life right now in terms of activity and revenue and cash flows that we've been talking about. So I would actually say I was kind of surprised that it didn't move more over the weekend. But I think the reason why could be just the fact that we're waiting for some of these deriskings.
00:56:43.658 - 00:57:26.380, Speaker D: It's a good time to be in crypto. Good time to be alive and in crypto, because you forget, but all of the people got taken out last year. One of the funny parts of the Rip was like, Suzu was back to bull. Like, some of it I feel like I'm just not smart enough to get, but some of it just seems like indecipherable, just like gibberish. But he's back, and I think that tells you something. We've had enough time now where he's failed, started a new company and come back. I think enough time has been spent in the penalty box, not for him specifically, but for the industry writ large.
00:57:27.230 - 00:57:28.940, Speaker C: Yeah, he's got some more time.
00:57:29.470 - 00:57:40.126, Speaker B: He's blocked me. Yeah, he blocked me. I don't know what yeah, but I've been blocked. I wasn't being enough in his time of.
00:57:40.148 - 00:57:52.210, Speaker C: Need listen, not going to lie. The other element that I think will be a huge, just derisking equivalent moment is the second that we finally get resolution to this whole FTX SBF lawsuit.
00:57:53.510 - 00:57:54.260, Speaker D: Which.
00:57:58.470 - 00:58:02.150, Speaker B: Tell them, preach.
00:58:03.850 - 00:58:08.970, Speaker D: That is going to be a shit show of a trial, too. Where is Sam Tribuco?
00:58:09.390 - 00:58:10.570, Speaker B: Where is he?
00:58:10.720 - 00:58:14.410, Speaker D: You have to imagine in his yacht.
00:58:17.470 - 00:58:18.250, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:58:18.320 - 00:58:35.406, Speaker D: All of that needs to resolve. We need to get to the point where that is fully put to bed. And then I think also picture SBF over the weekend. Everyone thinks I'm so bad, look at these fucking banks. They're blowing up now. Not going to save them. But I'm sure he felt you see.
00:58:35.428 - 00:58:46.180, Speaker A: He came out yesterday and he's like, FTX should cover all of my expenses related to my trial. So I feel like he kind of tried to seize this opportunity to come back in and say a little.
00:58:51.030 - 00:58:54.390, Speaker B: Bit, can I expense this? Can I expense?
00:58:54.970 - 00:58:55.720, Speaker C: No.
00:59:01.530 - 00:59:01.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:02.060 - 00:59:29.250, Speaker B: Michael, that point that you were making when ETH is above two K or whatever, I do think a lot of what drives the kind of mania in crypto during the bull cycles is kind of like good old fashioned money illusion, actually. Like, if you kind of denominate a good part of your investment portfolio in ETH and suddenly that does a ten X, you're sort of playing with, like, casino chip. It's the same effect that you get when you go into a casino, right, and you win a bunch of money, and that's why they convert it into chips, because it doesn't seem real.
00:59:29.320 - 00:59:29.554, Speaker A: Right?
00:59:29.592 - 00:59:43.670, Speaker B: This is every anecdote that you hear about. People are okay buying their NFTs when it's denominated in ETH, but as soon as you see the dollar price, it's like, awful. It's like, Turn off my screen. I think that's what drives an enormous amount of the reflexivity.
00:59:44.010 - 00:59:47.640, Speaker D: Did you really just compare head to Vegas this weekend, by the way?
00:59:48.830 - 00:59:53.340, Speaker C: I was going to say, I'll let you know how those chips fare for us.
00:59:53.950 - 01:00:00.198, Speaker B: Were you saying no, same principle. The abstraction principles, I'm not trying to compare.
01:00:00.294 - 01:00:04.818, Speaker C: Right. Thanks for comparing my ETH tokens.
01:00:04.934 - 01:00:08.590, Speaker B: No, that's not what I psychological effects. That's what I meant.
01:00:10.690 - 01:00:16.638, Speaker D: Would you be sus? What did you say we were staying at Caesar's Palace. Would you be sus?
01:00:16.734 - 01:00:18.830, Speaker A: There's only one person. It's the wind, baby.
01:00:18.910 - 01:00:19.700, Speaker D: It is.
01:00:20.550 - 01:00:44.330, Speaker C: And that's where we're staying. I think the other element here is just like, there's the psychological effect, but then there's also just like, the capital effect. We're actually starting to see some of these narratives and promises of DFI 1.0 shifting into DFI 2.0 that we've literally been waiting for for three years now, actually come to fruition.
01:00:44.830 - 01:00:45.530, Speaker B: We're like.
01:00:45.600 - 01:00:47.322, Speaker C: You want to trade? X, Y or Z?
01:00:47.376 - 01:00:47.594, Speaker D: Great.
01:00:47.632 - 01:01:11.278, Speaker C: There's that you know, there's like, legit betting markets for sports on chain now that have serious liquidity. There are financial services that exist left right and center. And it's not just maker. It's not just uniswap. It's not just spot trading anymore. There is a full fledged financial ecosystem that you can access now if you have ETH or if you have assets in that environment.
01:01:11.374 - 01:01:45.966, Speaker D: Djen Spartan once called for a three year bear market. Not once, many times. And he would even have a progress bar where he would update, like, you're in month four of the 36 month bear market. When you're in month four. That's a tough thing to hear from Djen Spartan, and it's pretty crazy. But it honestly was about three years from the first hype cycle of 2020 and comp and synthetics and ave to present day in 2023. We've kind of lived through the ups and the downs, but now it just feels like they're figuring it out.
01:01:46.148 - 01:02:19.302, Speaker B: So one of the challenges with that particular time frame is I think it's pretty easy. I'd be curious how you guys talk about things internally at Framework. I think it's pretty easy to you can go to someone and say, hey, I know it sucks right now, but just like, eyes on the prize. Like one year from now or nine months, things are going to get a lot better. Three years is just a long period of time. I'd just be curious about how you guys talk about that or message things internally or how you've motivated people through bear markets, basically.
01:02:19.436 - 01:02:22.298, Speaker D: Well, not everyone's going to make it.
01:02:22.304 - 01:02:23.530, Speaker B: We take them to Vegas.
01:02:25.230 - 01:02:37.680, Speaker D: Not everyone's going to make it. It's the first one in the venture business. You're lucky if 10% in traditional VC workout in crypto, it's more like I would say 30, 40%. Just there were a lot less startups to back.
01:02:38.050 - 01:02:41.610, Speaker A: Are you talking about portfolio companies, Mike, or are you talking about employees at Framework?
01:02:41.690 - 01:02:43.774, Speaker B: Kind of both. Kind of both.
01:02:43.812 - 01:03:25.774, Speaker D: I mean, we tell people if you're the number one in your niche, you can still be a billion dollar company even at the depths of the bear market, even if it gets 50% worse. But the laws of gravity still apply to everyone. You need to have a product that has product market fit. You need to be able to both create and extract value from it for yourself. And a lot of it is just like, frankly, like the grind of coming in every single day, trying to make it work, banging your head against the wall, iterating hiring people, firing people, feeling good, feeling bad. But at the end of the day, if you don't have that founder energy of like, I'm going to crush this thing come hell or high water, it's just probably never going to work out. And so that's one of the things that we look for and try to filter for is people that can work with us in that way.
01:03:25.774 - 01:03:50.840, Speaker D: And you may not start with the same business that you finish with. You may not start with the same team that you finish with, but there is usually a path if you're willing to grind. And that's mainly the sentiment. And I think the motto generally around timing is like, give it a year. If it looks bad, it's probably not as bad as it's going to be, but if you give it a year, things are a good chance that they're going to look a little bit better and that's enough to hopefully get people going.
01:03:51.290 - 01:04:47.878, Speaker C: The other thing I'd add, totally agree with everything man said. The other thing I'd add is like, okay, let's take Djen Spartan's three year projection. He made that I think in 2021. And he made it kind of at the height of I think it was summer 2021 is when he started talking about this. And so what we're really talking about here is summer 2024, where he's identifying, okay, that's the end of the three year bear market. Well, he was right for the first year and the first year was just about sure he missed a lot of the pump at the end of 2021, but he was right about there being a dump in 2022. And is this the tweet? Basically the point I'm trying to make is there is also this effect in markets where markets will front run you by a year.
01:04:47.878 - 01:05:10.400, Speaker C: So the outcome of whatever it is that's going to happen is actually going to get pulled forward because markets are going to react faster. So if it's a 36 month process, what you're really talking about is like 24 months. And if we really take the math and figure out where we think things are going to be probably this summer, we're going to move past a lot of these derisks and I think we're looking good.
01:05:10.850 - 01:05:47.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm with you. It depending on your sector in crypto, honestly, it's kind of been a bear market in D Five for even longer than 2021. Beginning of 2021, you can go all the way back to so not everything needs to perform in a totally correlated way. And to vance your point? I have the same framework in my head, like crypto. Crypto is like the early warning bell that was like, hey, ding ding ding. Liquidity is going to be drawn out of the system and I think it does a pretty good job of sniffing out when it's going to come back as well. I'm not saying crypto always has to trade like that, but I think that's how it trades today.
01:05:47.530 - 01:06:20.582, Speaker B: So that's what I think you saw over the weekend too. I think everyone kind of woke up and had the same thought like, oh, Fed is basically done. Maybe they can do a 25 basis point hike next week, but he's not volckering 50 basis point hikes into the market anymore. That is over even higher for longer if you think about that is pretty bullish because there's no more hikes. At least like the market can look through higher for longer, I think pretty easily. So I'm feeling good.
01:06:20.636 - 01:06:47.482, Speaker D: If they cause a recession and inflation is zero and rates are 5%, people are going to be screaming bloody murder, freaking out, like, higher for longer. I don't know. Forgive me for not trusting these people, but I just don't trust them. And for the record, this is exact same thing that happened in 2019. Crypto bottomed in December. There was trouble in the repo market in January. February fed pivoted stocks bottomed.
01:06:47.482 - 01:06:50.366, Speaker D: Basically when the Fed pivoted and then.
01:06:50.388 - 01:06:54.290, Speaker C: They mean 2018, then 2019.
01:06:56.070 - 01:07:13.974, Speaker D: Yeah, 2018, then 2019. This happened the last time. People are like, what do we do now? Same exact scenario. Hopefully there's not a pandemic around the corner, but it seems like we're following a preset playbook at this point.
01:07:14.172 - 01:07:25.654, Speaker C: The variable to track, I'll say it again, the variable to track the Cleveland Fed now forecast of inflation. If inflation continues to head in the direction that it seems to be heading, I think everything is going to work.
01:07:25.692 - 01:07:38.538, Speaker D: Itself out in the next year. We're going to see sub 2% inflation. Like, dude, everyone is so spooked right now. It doesn't matter if you work in construction or technology or retail. Inflation is basically over, in my opinion.
01:07:38.634 - 01:07:40.940, Speaker B: All right, team, this is a fun one. We'll see you next week.
