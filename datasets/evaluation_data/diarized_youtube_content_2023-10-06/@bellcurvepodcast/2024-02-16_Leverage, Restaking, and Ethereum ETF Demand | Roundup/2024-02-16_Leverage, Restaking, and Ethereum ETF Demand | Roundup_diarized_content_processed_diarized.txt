00:00:00.170 - 00:00:36.386, Speaker A: You know, it's pretty cut and dry for tradfi. You know, this is the next ETF crack they're going to get. There's not going to be one for a while after this, you know, probably like a couple of years, you know, maybe three years, something like that. But, you know, price is going to drive narrative. And when you see that bitcoin is doing so well on the back of these ETF flows, people are just going to get up to the plate and swing. It's going to be pretty cut and dry. And I think the things that matter with ETH are it's a name brand, it's going to be one of the two that has an ETF and it's going to be basically the beneficiary of these flows alongside bitcoin.
00:00:36.418 - 00:01:07.182, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, Ethereum, layer twos and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts which you can get and mint for free.
00:01:07.182 - 00:01:26.902, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right guys, on with the show. Hi everyone. This episode is brought to you by swell, a team leading the restaking future with their liquid restaking token Rsweep. Now, I've talked about liquid restaking on this program before. I think it is going to be a massive tectonic shift for Ethereum and I am super, super excited about it. And I like the swell team a lot.
00:01:26.902 - 00:01:47.178, Speaker B: Goes without saying, do your own research. This is not financial advice. You guys all know the drill. Again, I like this team. And if you stick around, I'm going to describe how you can restake your Eth in swell, earn pearls, Eigen layer points, and a whole bunch of future rewards. So thank you very much for swell making this episode possible. Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator.
00:01:47.178 - 00:02:11.542, Speaker B: Now, if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that Mev is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with Flood on this season. Flood is the only gasless and Mev free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap. Now, this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you, Flood, and.
00:02:11.596 - 00:02:36.830, Speaker C: Back to the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

00:02:36.830 - 00:02:46.180, Speaker C: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two, Vance and Miles. Fellas, welcome.
00:02:46.790 - 00:02:47.726, Speaker A: Jim.
00:02:47.918 - 00:02:48.980, Speaker C: Here we are.
00:02:50.150 - 00:02:51.806, Speaker A: Jam, jam, Jam.
00:02:51.838 - 00:02:52.510, Speaker C: Jam.
00:02:52.670 - 00:02:54.514, Speaker A: Elon had a couple of GMS this.
00:02:54.632 - 00:03:07.766, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, yeah. Do you guys see on Farcaster you can actually do instead of liking something, you can just toss an old GM? I don't know how that actually works, but have you guys been messing around on Farcaster? Now that we're like two weeks into.
00:03:07.788 - 00:03:12.826, Speaker A: This hype, I need to get on Farcaster. I've been slacking on that. I think Michael's maybe a bit further along.
00:03:13.008 - 00:03:39.790, Speaker D: Yep. Well, I had, I think, a similar situation to Eno where I signed up a long time ago. Like the whole Dan DM got in. Then my Apple ID got hacked in December. And literally with everything that does your Apple ID, so does all of your apps associated with your Apple ID, which means I had to restart. I'm back. But it is tough.
00:03:39.790 - 00:04:15.740, Speaker D: Frames is actually pretty cool. I like some of the narrative around headless marketplaces and kind of headless advertising, headless transactions, but it's like just came out and people are going to start experimenting with it. I'm actually talking with a guy who did the Girl Scout cookie frame. I think he's working on something new. Apparently he had to fulfill like 1000 girl shadow cookie orders. You know, crypto, crypto. Twitter's hungry for some thin man.
00:04:15.740 - 00:04:19.360, Speaker D: But I mean, there's people who spare red tape. It's cool stuff.
00:04:20.610 - 00:04:37.222, Speaker C: I think it's cool. I've talked about it. Me and Vance covered it when frames sort of came out. But it solves actually a lot of problems pretty unironically for blockworks, like some of our big problems. So I'm just rooting for it. I really hope it ends up working and a good portion of crypto Twitter migrates over there, I think it'd be.
00:04:37.276 - 00:04:43.030, Speaker D: Yeah, commerce plus consumer is a powerful concept that nobody's really tapped yet.
00:04:43.180 - 00:05:20.740, Speaker C: Yeah, totally agree. So, in terms of stories of the week, I actually wanted to start with the talk about the etfs. I don't really want to spend too much time on the bitcoin etfs. Suffice to say, there have been a lot of. The tide has turned on the flows, both in narrative and in actual repeated inflows. We've been having 500, and I think yesterday, on Thursday, we had over 750,000,000 in net inflows for bitcoin. By the way, you guys might have seen this because it was floating around on Twitter, but if you had to guess on what year to date flows look like for gold etfs, what would you say? That looks like?
00:05:22.950 - 00:05:46.730, Speaker A: I cheated on this one because I read that tweet. But let me, if I can pull up the chart from zero hedge, but gold inflows have been getting crushed, and bitcoin has been just absolutely like, if you're holding gold right now, you must be a little bit nervous if you don't have a bitcoin or crypto hedge.
00:05:48.510 - 00:05:54.222, Speaker D: Has someone checked on Peter Schiff lately? Like a wellness check, maybe?
00:05:54.276 - 00:05:54.990, Speaker C: Wellness check?
00:05:55.060 - 00:06:10.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is kind of like the switch, right, where the boomers just kind of get rugged by something that they didn't quite see coming. But it's just like, so empirically clear, based on flows, that if this train.
00:06:10.792 - 00:06:25.362, Speaker C: Keeps moving, it's not the numbers. By the way, Michael, before you go, the year to date flows for the bitcoin ETF complex, which only again launched, like mid January, is 4.1 billion. So that's net. Including the grayscale outflow.
00:06:25.426 - 00:06:25.702, Speaker D: Net.
00:06:25.756 - 00:06:26.214, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:06:26.332 - 00:06:36.490, Speaker C: Net. That's net. And for gold, there have been 2.4 billion in outflows since the beginning of the year, which is. That's pretty wild.
00:06:37.390 - 00:06:46.922, Speaker D: So assume a couple of things. Number one, what is the total outflows from GBTC? Like five and a half something along those lines.
00:06:46.986 - 00:06:49.710, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. I think it's actually closer to six at this point.
00:06:49.780 - 00:07:49.780, Speaker D: Maybe six at this point. So assume that that was a lot of pent up, basically sell demand where people wanted to get out of the GBTC, based off of a number of reasons, the closing of the spread trade, the fact that it's three x higher than the highest other cost structure. But assume that that is going to slow down. So maybe in future months, you kind of remove a lot of that pent up sell demand and net net. We're still talking about something that's over 10 billion of net inflows into these new products. The Bloomberg guys, Eric and James, said that when they were, and I don't know who they talked to, but one of the things that they referenced early on is that a lot of the people who are in GBTC are not people who are looking to necessarily rotate into new products. They're looking to close their spread trade, or they're looking to kind of move on and kind of cash out.
00:07:49.780 - 00:08:41.986, Speaker D: And so the flows I don't think are out of GBTC into the other nine products or the other eight, however many it is. I think it's really net new into these new products with some people leaving the GBTC pool. If we extrapolate this out even further, what we're really talking about here is something that's on the order of like $10 billion of net inflows over the first month. Obviously that breaks all the records. Like GLD, it took them like three or four years, I was reading, to get to those level of daily inflows, to get to this level of size. But the other thing to keep in mind here is, number one, there's a lot of platforms that these independent advisors and financial institutions have basically as their systems that they have to deal with. And a lot of those platforms have not even integrated these products yet.
00:08:41.986 - 00:09:11.306, Speaker D: And so there's still the capability for a lot of the, and if you talk to a lot of the asset managers, a lot of them are sitting there saying we're going to wait for three months to see where these products net settle. So we know which ones to go in on and we know which ones to trade. There's a lot of people still waiting in the wing that I think is really interesting and probably will keep the inflows coming. But if we're talking $10 billion a month, that's $120,000,000,000 a year. That's way higher than anyone's high. Assessment by a factor.
00:09:11.498 - 00:09:24.142, Speaker A: Mike, share what I've got on my screen at the moment. I mean, this gives just a visual representation to what some of Michael is talking about. If you're holding gold, does that chart make you nervous?
00:09:24.206 - 00:09:25.860, Speaker C: Wow, 100%.
00:09:27.910 - 00:10:14.980, Speaker A: And it's just like I was watching the Gary Gensler CNBC interview yesterday, where he's like, it's just an accounting ledger. Talk about coping. And you can kind of see how people who would be holding gold would be kind of saying the same things. But if this trickle turns into a flood. It's going to be really interesting to see the market caps of bitcoin and gold convergen on the flow side. The last thing I'll say is there was an interview on CNBC with a couple of large raas, and they're pegging the first two years of demand for these crypto etfs as 150,000,000,000, which would kind of foot with the first 10 billion of inflows this month. But if bitcoin breaks all time highs and the marketing machine gets going, I could see it going far higher than that.
00:10:14.980 - 00:10:35.160, Speaker A: And so I think the story is just unprecedented demand, and effectively everyone misunderstood. How do you miss this large of investor demand for a product? It kind of does not look favorably upon the ETF industry as a.
00:10:35.610 - 00:10:38.546, Speaker D: Well, you mean the SEC, not the ETF industry.
00:10:38.658 - 00:10:43.946, Speaker A: Right. But I mean everyone and their mother in the ETF industry, outside of like James Safford Baltunas, was like, these things.
00:10:43.968 - 00:10:44.346, Speaker D: Are going to have.
00:10:44.368 - 00:11:09.250, Speaker C: No, yeah, I actually, to Vance's point, if you remember, so State street has sort of famously, they were doing things in crypto and then they pulled out. And if you rewind the tape back a couple of years, when people at these big institutions were interviewed, it was like, there's no client demand for this. That's why we're not investing in the space, because there's no client demand. And I think that's been proven incorrect.
00:11:09.750 - 00:11:13.220, Speaker D: Do you remember that vanguard literally has blocked these.
00:11:13.590 - 00:11:17.714, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I guess that's a brand thing from their standpoint.
00:11:17.762 - 00:11:20.546, Speaker D: But Fidelity got, I don't know, tens.
00:11:20.578 - 00:12:07.154, Speaker E: Of thousands of new accounts within the first couple of days, which makes me very happy as a fidelity alum. But I think I'll also be super curious to see, just like even on the fidelity platform, I guess, what the aum of bitcoin held directly, because you can do that now, you can buy bitcoin and ETH directly versus the ETF side. I'm sure it's very different for retail versus anything institutional on the advisor side or even on the asset management side. But yeah, it does feel like the cost structures are very different. Right. There's like zero fees on the direct versus at least something on the ETF. It will be super interesting to see just how that might shift over time.
00:12:07.154 - 00:12:08.598, Speaker E: Or maybe it never does.
00:12:08.764 - 00:12:09.730, Speaker D: Did you have twice.
00:12:09.810 - 00:12:44.080, Speaker A: Well, it's interesting. So Robin Hood reported their results, and they have all eleven etfs listed, and they're still saying that 90% of their volume is coming through. Like people actually buying bitcoin and not the etfs. So there's going to be some sort of age divide between these brokerage houses where the boomers just want a security and the zoomers kind of want the real thing. And I think that balance is nice. I kind of view all of this bitcoin going into these etfs as like, coins that are being siphoned out of our industry, which is kind of like cool and kind of sad. But we should try to hold on to the physical as much as possible.
00:12:45.570 - 00:12:57.540, Speaker E: Especially if we ever get an east ETF, I think that becomes even more, I don't know, it's closer to home, right. Because we actually use this stuff and feel like there's more that can be done with it.
00:12:58.310 - 00:13:10.860, Speaker D: So that's exactly what I was going to say, which is, I wonder if there's some advantage to holding securities in a fidelity account. Like, you can borrow against it, you can use it as margin versus the core bitcoin itself, which you may not be able to use.
00:13:11.310 - 00:13:17.798, Speaker E: So you touched on it earlier with these compatibility with back end systems.
00:13:17.894 - 00:13:18.250, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:18.320 - 00:13:51.650, Speaker E: And so I think that is a big part of it. And a big part of what we were trying to figure out at the time is, okay, great. We want, basically, people want everything on one screen, right? And they want no sort of friction in terms of their workflows and processes. And how do you basically map over all of that to holding the asset direct? It's a lot more challenging than an ETF. Right. But it's possible, and we've already kind of figured that out. But that definitely plays into it, at least for the institutional, whether it's a fiduciary.
00:13:51.650 - 00:13:53.800, Speaker E: Right. Holding on behalf of somebody else.
00:13:54.250 - 00:14:50.280, Speaker C: One other thing, Vance, you just mentioned sort of the mental framework of the underlying that goes into these etfs just being sort of moved into this black hole. But another way that you could look at it as well is like, if you looked at this is kind of going to be kind of a silly analogy, but, like, tradfi is an l one, right. And what ETH is sort of doing is ETH exports wrapped versions of itself up to op, like optimism and arbitrum. And there are certain properties there, like you get the more direct security assurances of ETH, but you can actually use the ETh to do things. And then in this other wrap version that we're exporting now into tradfi, then it has these other properties, and it's like custody, know, fidelity or BNY Mellon or whoever ends up custodying it. And the kind of shitty part of that property is you have to pay management fee on it, but it's also pretty safe and you get some of the legal assurances of being in the US. So that's like another mental framework that you could maybe have for the.
00:14:52.670 - 00:15:42.902, Speaker A: I think the reason I kind of refer to it as a black hole is because there's no in kind redemptions. It's going to actually be pretty hard to get coins out of the etfs back onto the exchanges. And maybe some additional kind of inside baseball commentary on just how impactful these flows have been and could continue to be. Is that the coin allocation process of getting coins from exchanges to basically the ETF custodians is like one thing, but we have market makers reaching out to us saying like, hey, can we borrow bitcoin for 12 hours and give it to us now? And we'll sell it to the etfs tomorrow morning and we'll give you some yield on it in the next 18 hours. And it's like the inventory levels of these market makers is becoming extremely constrained.
00:15:43.046 - 00:15:44.470, Speaker E: It's like sec lending.
00:15:44.550 - 00:16:20.558, Speaker C: Yeah, wait, can I tell you another. So I was on a call this week with a large market maker, and one of the things that they were extremely focused on was this idea of yield in the underlying that they're holding. So their goal is like, I don't want to basically be holding anything in inventory that I'm not earning yield on. But most of the liquidity is in the bitcoin and ETh trading pairs. And so what they're basically trying to do is create a system and to lower the amount of time that they can go from. Instead of holding ETH, they're going to hold steeth. And what they're going to do is they want to move the amount of time.
00:16:20.558 - 00:16:43.758, Speaker C: If they want to conduct a trade or something, they'll go from steeth into ETH back into something that bears yield. And they're trying to minimize the amount of time where they're holding the underlying. And I just think you guys have been sort of banging this drum, and I feel like people are underestimating the degree to which tradfi just freaking loves yield. And I feel like that's going to be a massive part of the narrative moving forward.
00:16:43.924 - 00:16:45.710, Speaker E: Crypto loves yield, too.
00:16:45.860 - 00:16:46.606, Speaker D: Yeah, we love.
00:16:46.708 - 00:16:49.006, Speaker C: Actually, crypto loves yield, not as much.
00:16:49.028 - 00:16:50.110, Speaker E: As airdrops.
00:16:52.610 - 00:17:40.720, Speaker A: But we're starting to build this kind of like repo market within crypto. And the first use case of this repo market is filling this ETF demand that is basically overwhelming the balance sheet of the crypto native market makers. You have to remember you have the authorized contract participants on the ETF side and then you have basically the crypto native people who are like taking coins from binance and putting them in, you know, from OKX to Coinbase. And those are the people who are balance sheet constrained just because the biggest market makers in the industry are wintermute GSR jump not so much anymore, like Cumberland. And Cumberland is like a know multi asset desk, but there's just not enough capital right now to fulfill these BTC buys. It's interesting.
00:17:41.490 - 00:18:09.160, Speaker C: So guys, maybe we could transition from the bitcoin part of this into the ETh Surrey here. And I would love to get your guys take on, I think, a debate that I've started to see form a little bit on at least Twitter, which is is there going to be similar amount of institutional demand for a spot ETH ETF the same as there was for a spot bitcoin ETF? And I have my own thoughts on this, but I kind of wanted to tee it up and get your guys thoughts on this.
00:18:10.590 - 00:18:56.422, Speaker D: So I don't think there's going to be the same brand appeal. I mean, look at what we're talking about in relation to gold. I think bitcoin is pretty representative of digital gold. At least that's the zeitgeist that most maybe like boomer investors think about it in. But I think what is baked into whatever the ETH ETF seems to have, at least at this point, based on a lot of the applications that we've seen, is the ability to stake which creates this whole different type of product, which I think is going to be pretty unique to the entire industry where the ability to say, hey, I want to have exposure to this ecosystem. I know ethereum is something that I've heard of. I don't really know that much about it, but it's spitting off 4% yield, and that can be a base case.
00:18:56.422 - 00:19:40.790, Speaker D: A downside protection, a margin of safety. Wow, that's pretty interesting. It's like upside, huge downside protected in a lot of ways. So I think the devil will be in the details in terms of what they can get past with the SEC. Anecdotally, though, I've heard that it most likely will not be in May and it'll probably be something, it's like 50 50 it'll be in May, but it's like 80% chance it'll be by the end of the year. And so I think for us to be able to get the product that we want, it's actually going to be what we need, but it's not going to be something that happens in the timeline that people are expecting. And even all the pundits that I see on Twitter are kind of coming to this perspective.
00:19:41.930 - 00:19:56.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I disagree with that. I think it will be a may date just based on the different types of applications that are being put forward and just how aggressive they are with including staking and whether it's in May or whether it's.
00:19:57.790 - 00:20:00.060, Speaker D: I'd say it's for staking in particular.
00:20:01.150 - 00:20:41.946, Speaker A: For staking in particular. That will probably be like a 2025 thing. I think you see the base level spot approval this year, and then you kind of like haggle with the regulators to get more kind of full featured staking products put in there. But the interviews that I've been watching recently have been with Hester purse and she's been pretty unequivocal that, look, we're not going to do this court thing again. And even if we do, it's going to be a truncated process. The DC circuit court starts in August, but it would be a truncated court case ruling based on all of the grayscale priors. So you're not going to have that same year.
00:20:41.946 - 00:21:17.026, Speaker A: Maybe if it goes to court, it's like three or four months in our opinion. And I bias with a lot of what the Bloomberg panel on this week was, where I think one person was at 50, 51 person was at 75, 25. And I think that's kind of like representative of where the ods are. I will say that it's pretty cut and dry for tradfi. This is the next ETF crack they're going to get. There's not going to be one for a while after this. Probably like a couple of years, maybe three years, something like that.
00:21:17.026 - 00:22:18.402, Speaker A: But price is going to drive narrative. And when you see that bitcoin is doing so well on the back of these ETF flows, people are just going to get up to the plate and swing. It's going to be pretty cut and dry. And I think the things that matter with ETH are it's a name brand, it's going to be one of the two that has an ETF, and it's going to be basically the beneficiary of these flows alongside bitcoin. And I see it less as bitcoin versus eth. Going forward, I think you're going to have kind of like this second wind of Michael talked about this, but products getting into natural prime brokerage accounts that's going to be led by bitcoin in the next three months. They're going to put all the legwork in, they're going to get access to all these different ras and distribution channels, and then it's going to be like, do you want to buy the 50 50 bitcoin and ETH combination ETF that we have? Do you only want to go buy eth? Maybe we do this thing where bitcoin runs so high that there's now this massive catch up trade, but all the priors are going to be very favorable.
00:22:18.402 - 00:22:33.260, Speaker A: And so I think we're kind of like rerunning this thing where it was like, oh yeah, there's going to be no demand for bitcoin. Well, guess what? There's a shit ton of demand for these things. And if you don't have anything else coming down the pike after that, it feels like the game is going to be pretty easy.
00:22:33.630 - 00:22:42.880, Speaker D: Keep in mind, you're going to have to have a futures product before you have a spot product for any other asset. And we're not even really close to anything else being there.
00:22:43.570 - 00:23:11.210, Speaker A: The other thing I'll say is that if you look at the liquidity of ETH versus bitcoin, it's probably about 60%. There's a lot less of the ETh on exchanges. The last time I checked there was about twelve and a half million, down from almost 27 million at the middle of last year. You have restaking, you have the NFT comeback, which we can talk about. There's just a lot of supply sinks for this ETH and you don't really have that with bitcoin.
00:23:11.870 - 00:23:40.500, Speaker E: Do you think that will play into the demand for the ETF? Just because, I guess, for starters, ETH and bitcoin are very different products, right? So maybe they have different places within a broader allocation. And then two, I think you would hope over time that people realize there's a lot you can do with your ETH. And I'd say the difference between holding a bitcoin ETF versus direct versus holding ETH versus direct is way bigger, right?
00:23:40.870 - 00:24:16.286, Speaker D: Well, yeah, so I think that is the question of when. Okay, so I think one of the things that we're seeing in some of these applications right now is the ability to stake. I think that that is a total scarecrow argument. And they're putting it in there basically as a negotiation tactic to be like, okay, fine, we'll take out the staking, but we're going to move forward with the rest. And so you're going to have basically these ETF spot etfs. Eth spot etfs move first, and then it's a question of, okay, well, what can you do afterwards? And so the products will add features, they'll add capabilities. And I think that that's where it sort of is.
00:24:16.286 - 00:24:57.786, Speaker D: Just like the catnip that draws you in, and it's like, oh, this is interesting. But in the same way you have the happening, you have the same supply saints or even more supply saints on the ETH side. And I think any increase in demand is going to drive this reflexive cycle that I think draws attention to it, just as you're seeing with bitcoin right now. And so you're going to get the same price action, kind of narrative driving effects of what the spot ETF launch will look like. But then it's sort of like, okay, I've been educated on what this asset is. I've been educated on the fact that it's an institutional class, institutional grade. It has all the distribution that we've been able to enable with all the bitcoin spot ETF products.
00:24:57.786 - 00:25:20.900, Speaker D: Now, what can I do with it? And I think there's going to be some financial products that do that on behalf of people, basically tied within a security wrapper. But I think just anything where you can educate more people on what Ethereum is and how it works and what you can do with it is a positive catalyst, because then you can start to build on chain products that maybe people want to go discover as well.
00:25:21.510 - 00:25:57.630, Speaker A: And the psychology of investors as well is like, if you want to be long tech, you're going to buy the mag seven. It's not like you're going to have this super principled, like, ooh, I want 40% apple, and I'm going to underweight Netflix, and then I'm going to go overweight Microsoft. When a new asset class pops up, it's just like, I need allocation. And so I don't think investors are going to basically distinguish between ETH and bitcoin. They're just going to be the name asset crypto brands. For instance, imagine a conversation with an advisor. You got bitcoin, you got ETH, you've got a 50 50 bitcoin and ETH ETF.
00:25:57.630 - 00:26:36.620, Speaker A: What's that conversation like? Maybe it's like you have a bunch of gold, so you want to be overweight bitcoin, maybe. But I think it's more so, like, look, interest rates are going down. Bitcoin and ETH are the standard bears for this industry. You're probably better just like 50 50 allocating. Last thing I'll say on bitcoin right now is the flows have been absolutely shocking and so positively encouraging for the industry. But ethbtc bottom basically on the day that these ETFs came out. And so what that tells me is that in the face of billions of dollars of inflows, this catch up trade is already starting.
00:26:36.620 - 00:27:27.094, Speaker A: But also what you're probably seeing manifest right now is just a supply scarcity of actual ETH. And I think one of the things that Michael and I got wrong in 2023 was like there was this huge overhang from proof of work, Ethereum miners dumping all of their ETH. We didn't really consider how pissed off these people were at basically this gravy train being shut down, but that whole year was basically them selling this ETH and them selling calls on this ETH and kind of dampening the volatility. But right now what you see is, is this like the supply shrinkage playing out and you're starting to see it in the options market. Like ETH calls are cheaper than bitcoin relative to upside. And so I think a lot of the options activity is going to be super important here. And options on the ibit and BTC ETF products launch in June.
00:27:27.094 - 00:27:47.140, Speaker A: And I think that's when you're going to see this next kind of kick higher where people start to get really interested in the options market. And people are eventually just going to be like, look, bitcoin options are great. We obviously want those, but these are more expensive than ETH options relative to the roadmap, relative to the ETF flows that are to come, all of that stuff.
00:27:48.790 - 00:28:21.930, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with so much of that, Vance. And just to underscore the point that I think just to drive it home, I agree. I feel like a lot of the sort of bickering about know, is it ultrasound money or is it not ultrasound money? And how does it stack up against, those are for crypto natives to argue about. Those are not conversations that are going to be had in the brokerage wherever. Yeah, that's not what tradfi is thinking about. They're just going to look at it like, yep, I want broad exposure to this. Oh, and by the way, ETH is kind of smaller and newer and I want to catch the next bitcoin.
00:28:21.930 - 00:28:54.962, Speaker C: The other thing that I would say as well is like we've talked about on the show, I'm sure there was a minor selling dynamic last year, but also Eth, bitcoin is playing out exactly like it did last cycle. I mean, bitcoin ran last cycle. Bitcoin dominance always spikes around this time. This is like super typical market behavior as far as crypto cycle is confirmed and kind of the next thing to happen is like, okay, bitcoin has its run and then it's ethan, then alts, right? That's if it just replayed again, same as it did last time. That's what you kind of expect, right? So I feel like we're seeing pretty typical behavior.
00:28:55.106 - 00:29:09.020, Speaker D: The economics are also undeniable in that ETH is more reflexive than bitcoin. And so smaller moves in ETH will have more price action in ETH, which has more price action in ETH, which has more price action in ETH. It feeds off of itself.
00:29:10.510 - 00:29:50.534, Speaker A: Two truisms that are always at the top of my mind is, number one, there's always a market to being early or earlier to something. Like, if bitcoin hits one hundred and fifty k and ETH is like, at six or seven k, there's going to be this massive, like, okay, cool, I want to be new to this thing. And the second one is that we can debate ultrasound money and Mev and all the intricacies of blockchains. But a lot of the stuff, when it really gets going is that price drives narrative, which drives price. And so I think, especially in the bear market, people are in crypto hyper discerning this thing's a scam. This thing's not a scam. This is good.
00:29:50.534 - 00:30:09.598, Speaker A: This is bad. You kind of have more of like a peanut butter spread when it's a bull market, when it's just like, look, these two things are going to work. Whatever issues you have with the protocol or ultrasound money or the branding or whoever, it's like it kind of goes out the window. The bar gets lower, is another way.
00:30:09.604 - 00:30:21.620, Speaker C: Of saying that, yeah, I would call this ETH, ETF disbelief. It's like the last remnants of bear market PTSD that'll get blown out. So we'll see.
00:30:22.710 - 00:30:23.620, Speaker A: All right.
00:30:26.310 - 00:31:12.338, Speaker C: I kind of wanted to move into this debate about something again that I've been seeing pop up on Twitter advance. I saw you commenting on this. And, miles, frankly, I know you're pretty deep in the weeds on this stuff, but I wanted to have this debate about whether or not restaking equals leverage. Right. There's been sort of increasing calls. I know Chris Berninski, whose opinion I respect an enormous amount, kind of tweeted out that a lot of the leverage that sneakily entered the system during the last cycle that we didn't necessarily notice at the time was through CFI lending desks, but also the GBTC or the grayscale trades, ETH and GBTZ trades. And he implied that maybe this time it's going to be through restaking and to sort of set the debate up.
00:31:12.338 - 00:31:56.900, Speaker C: And then maybe, Miles, I'll turn it over to you and get your take here. But the way that this could be seen as leverage is you kind of have the same pot of ETH, right? The ETH isn't necessarily expanding, but through staking and then opting into additional slashing conditions, you are sort of increasing the claims on that Eth or the amount of stuff that, that ETH supports. So in that sense, it sort of looks like leverage, but in a lot of cases, and eigen layer has actually specifically outlined this on their docs. This is very different from how rehypothecation would work in a prime brokerage type setting. Right. Because you have much more transparency in the PB or kind of brokerage case. They will take your assets and they don't have to tell you what they're doing with it.
00:31:56.900 - 00:32:05.380, Speaker C: They have much more discretion there. So in some senses it's very different. But Miles, can you kind of, what's your take on all this?
00:32:07.350 - 00:32:51.380, Speaker E: The whole debate is very just kind of around semantics, and I think it's kind of important, but also kind of asking the wrong questions, and I can kind of touch on that later. First of all, reapothecation versus leverage, kind of different financial leverage versus, say, whatever we're calling this security leverage is very different. Right. So the price of an asset goes down, you're not going to get slashed. So that's very different than, say, taking a margin position. Now, if you are looping your LRT position or looping your deposits into more of an actual leverage position, then yeah, I think you could get liquidated. Right.
00:32:51.380 - 00:33:20.926, Speaker E: But to me, this looks more like bonds. Honestly, it's more like, okay, I have some range of risk that I can take on here. I'm not lending out capital. Right. I'm lending out security to some extent and maybe the ability to draw on capital, but it's not really the ability to draw on capital because I think it's all going to get burned. Right. If there's a slashing event.
00:33:20.926 - 00:34:08.730, Speaker E: And so I would just look at it like anything from just, I would say incremental risk that you add as you go across the risk spectrum from like a treasury to aaa to a junk bond. Right. And so you have 20 avs, and all of them have very different slashing conditions. They're all very heterogeneous. Probably it's kind of like different loans within different fixed income products. And so I would think of it more like default risk rather than maybe liquidation risk. Because I would say if you're in the camp of like this is rehypothecation, this is leverage.
00:34:08.730 - 00:35:50.960, Speaker E: You could argue that they kind of act like binary options as well, because the slashing at the moment at least, is like all 32 of your eth, or you're all good. There's no partial slashing sort of component here. And so the more sort of avs as you add, the higher a risk you're taking on with this binary option. But yeah, I think the better questions to ask are really around what are you signing up for? Depending on the avs, what happens in the case of a slashing event? Is all this pooled collateral just like burned? Or can the AVss have this sort of option to redistribute, to say like the validator that flagged the slashing event, or maybe the users that got screwed, right. I think that actually makes a huge difference as well, because then I think the overall cost of capital goes up if people have incentive now for these slashing events to happen, right? So yeah, I would say that it's more like the spectrum of risk across different bonds. And I think it really does matter on an abs to ABS basis what you're signing up for and how they design the slashing rules. And also if eigen layer steps in and sets almost global standards of how slashing should work, similar to how defaults on loans have processes or bankruptcies as processes around who gets this collateral first.
00:35:50.960 - 00:36:04.340, Speaker E: So yeah, I'll pause there, but definitely curious to hear your thoughts. You can't argue. It's not like, looks like leverage, talks like leverage. So it's probably leverage, but it's not leverage, though.
00:36:06.150 - 00:36:44.170, Speaker A: There is no inherent leverage in restaking. Please repeat after me if you're listening to this conversation. So we restake, and how we think of it is we've taken our ETH, we've put it into the Eigen layer deposit queue, and right now there is no abs, there is no slashing, there is no risk. And of course, if you take your liquid staking tokens, you put them in there and you get a liquid restaking token back, and then you then put it on a lending marketplace, and then you borrow money against it, and then you put it back in, you are creating leverage.
00:36:44.330 - 00:36:45.482, Speaker E: That's the looping leverage.
00:36:45.546 - 00:37:22.258, Speaker A: Yes, right. But we're not there. Borrowing against your assets is a totally different thing than restate assets. So I think the creation of leverage doesn't even exist today. I think where the point gets more fine is I assume that we're all farming the Eigen layer token right now. I think there will be a time where that moves to we're all farming maybe like a combination of ABS tokens and the Eigen layer token. And your point, whatever the slashing conditions that the ABS is impose on your ETH, again, it's not leverage.
00:37:22.258 - 00:37:43.870, Speaker A: But if you get slashed, you might lose 5% of your eth if you're on some shitty abs. And so AbS selection is important as you think about what is the downside here. But again, there's no leverage unless you put leverage on. That's the thing about leverage, is like, you need to go borrow money and buy more and restake to add leverage.
00:37:44.210 - 00:38:12.086, Speaker D: That's the leverage component. I mean, Miles, that description, I think is a pretty apt one into how we think about the future potential of what this would look like. But here's the thing that I think people will look back on. And what you just described is a very complicated process for an individual person to go through. You've got to evaluate multiple abs. You got to see their unique, heterogeneous staking conditions. You got to understand their slashing conditions.
00:38:12.086 - 00:39:17.706, Speaker D: You got to be able to allocate the capital. We don't even know exactly how that's going to work. And to use the same analogy, it's like, do you want to be your own CDO manager? Obviously not. I think that this is actually where all of the LRT solutions could step in, where just in the same way that you have with some of the LST solutions like Lido, where they're making choices on which validators to actually bring into the queue. Obviously, Lido, for instance, is moving into a more decentralized way of selecting the node operators. But you can imagine a place where there is sort of like control held at a central layer that then eventually gets decentralized to select and choose. I think that actually, I'm sure there will be someone who blows themselves up just because of the fact that they didn't understand putting money on this abs and restaking that one and not doing something or another led to them losing their capital.
00:39:17.706 - 00:39:39.522, Speaker D: And it's like, oh no, I blew up because of leverage. It's like, well, no, that's not true. It's just that selection. But the selection is going to be tough. And I think that that's kind of crypto. Twitter loves to pick points of leverage now that we've had multiple blow ups, sort of like selecting five out of the last two recessions. If you have that mentality, you're just going to be looking for it the whole time.
00:39:39.522 - 00:39:42.658, Speaker D: It's not going to be leverage that blows people up, it's just going to be bad selection.
00:39:42.754 - 00:40:02.726, Speaker E: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And that's why the value prop of lrts is so clear right now. Even more clear than, I'd say the friction that it kind of abstracts away from a restaker is even more significant than maybe the friction that Lido abstracts away from a normal staker.
00:40:02.758 - 00:40:03.146, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:03.248 - 00:40:45.100, Speaker E: Because it's so heterogeneous in how you could actually interact with this network. But I also think that's why those are two different products, and that's why I think, precisely, we have a huge spectrum of different lrts. And I actually don't think anyone in particular is going to be able to actually loop that much because there's going to be so many of them, even under one entity. Could have a family of different funds. Right. I think that the whole looping thing is a bit overblown. I mean, there will be dumb sort of new lending protocols that come out and allow for it, but I think it'll be like, small enough that it's not catastrophic blow up.
00:40:45.100 - 00:41:16.130, Speaker E: And then I think the other point of complexity is actually on the avs side. It's like, how the hell do I know what's actually securing my protocol in terms of both the underlying collateral and where else? It's hanging out on the weekends and could be slashed at any given time. That is pushing a lot of potential value capture up the stack by creating these opportunities to remove that friction. I think it's good, but we need a lot more tooling.
00:41:16.470 - 00:42:00.434, Speaker D: 100%. So here's my thesis as to how LST versus LRT is going to play out. LST has historically been a game of who can amass the most amount of ease, because, to your point, it's a much more homogeneous selection criteria for which node operators to go after. And the process is pretty homogeneous in and of itself. Whereas I think it's the one protocol or group that has the best connections to the ABS is understanding of which ones to choose and sort of can manage the complexity best, not necessarily the one that can amass the most amount of e. That's going to win the LRT game. It's going to be harder to figure that out, because it's not going to be like a dune dashboard that you can use to track, it's going to be something else.
00:42:00.434 - 00:42:19.870, Speaker D: And invariably people are going to want to push boundaries in terms of the risk curve. They're going to want to go back to ABS that's spitting off the most amount of yield because they want to have that high metric, but there's more blow up risk. So I don't think we have a standardized metric yet, but it's going to be a very different game than LRTs.
00:42:19.970 - 00:42:51.090, Speaker E: I totally agree, and I've been banging on this drum to Mike for a little while. Know, I just think they're very different products. LRTs compete on total risk adjusted return. Lsts compete on basically achieving parity with ETH in terms of moneyness and utility. So the network effects of an asset are much, much stronger than the network effects of a mutual fund or like one fund. Right. And the preferences around funds are much wider.
00:42:51.090 - 00:43:21.706, Speaker E: So I don't think that there's going to be like. And I think the more an LRT tries to compete directly with steeth by being everything to everyone, like, we're going to basically accept every kind of collateral asset on this side. We're going to try to have an ABS criteria that is perfect for everybody. I just think they're not going to be good at either. So, yeah, it's super interesting. That's a little bit of a tangent from the original question, but just to.
00:43:21.728 - 00:44:13.486, Speaker A: Bring it back to the original question, just again, there is no inherent leverage in restaking. I think your actual biggest risk is if you decide to add leverage, that's on you, number one. Number two, I think the biggest security vector and threat vector is getting hacked still, and it changes and it gets less risky as Eigen layer gets more Lindy. But to your point about how Eigen layer enforces these global kind of governance standards, or at least like ABS quality standards, if an ABS is shittily constructed, does that lead to an increased risk of slashing? I'm honestly not worried about if we lost 5% of our ETH in a slashing event. I think you kind of need to bake that into the cake if you're like, out on the risk curve farming these abs. But if you get hacked and you get a zero, that's going to be really tough. I don't know how that stuff works yet.
00:44:13.486 - 00:44:22.190, Speaker A: I think we're going to have more details in the next couple of months. But ABS selection feels like it's going to be paramount to how secure is.
00:44:22.340 - 00:45:08.474, Speaker E: Human backstop of the slashing veto committee is not going away anytime soon for those reasons, because the hack is actually probably even just a bug in the slashing software rather than some sort of exploit. Right. I think that matters. And I think it does matter that just by the way it's designed because it's not part of ETh itself. It is all 32 of your eth or nothing. Right? There is no partial slashing quite yet. And I think that's probably something that should get figured out because it doesn't make sense that a double sign should result in 32 e slash from an ABS where a double sign on ETH is like very small fraction of your stake.
00:45:08.474 - 00:45:18.660, Speaker E: Right. So there's a lot to figure out, but I think we're all on the same page. It's not leverage until you start looping this.
00:45:19.590 - 00:45:32.550, Speaker A: This reminds me of like will Lido soft commit to 33% valid. I feel like ETH people sometimes get worked up about the wrong stuff. I think this is one of them.
00:45:32.700 - 00:46:23.014, Speaker E: Yeah. Now it's a different question though. If your point, Vance, why is there already five or six? Was it like 6 billion of capital deposited into eigen layer? It's not for yield, because I don't think there is, let's say even like $300 million of security spend from avss right now, cumulatively ready to go. And that would basically double the sort of native staking yield if you restake to every single avs. And so I'm curious to see how this mercenary capital, how sticky it is because it's not like an LP pool where you can just go like, all right, got that airdrop. Let's move it over to the next one. There is some kind of unwinding that you're going to have to do here that adds a little bit of the.
00:46:23.052 - 00:46:25.000, Speaker D: Vast majority of the capital is going to move.
00:46:27.370 - 00:46:55.490, Speaker A: I think we're going to see, I don't know, we think it's going to launch in q two or q three Eigen layer, something like that, and assume there's going to be like a minimum one year cliff, kind of like Celestia has today, where the FTV is just going to be super high because there's not a lot of float. And then you have all these abs coming out and maybe that's another year, a year and a half of these tokens. I don't think you're really going to see the Eigen layer capital move for the first year after launch.
00:46:56.550 - 00:46:59.486, Speaker E: Subsidies on subsidies, on subsidies, totally.
00:46:59.518 - 00:47:20.034, Speaker A: But there's always going to be this new game to play. Like, oh, you're in eigenvalue. Are you in this abs? Because it's yielding 500% per year, there's going to be a long tail of opportunities to keep people interested, combined with just these tokens not having a lot of float, meaning that rewards are going to be super valuable.
00:47:20.162 - 00:47:34.990, Speaker E: I feel like it's funny because the more they pay out, the more the value prop of Eigen layer actually doesn't really make sense versus just launching your own l one. Right. But then maybe they're just on Eigen layer for distribution and marketing and things like that. Right?
00:47:35.140 - 00:47:40.154, Speaker A: That's what we've noticed. It's like projects are star for distribution.
00:47:40.282 - 00:47:45.858, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly. So they hop on the Eigen layer bandwagon that you want to be a.
00:47:45.864 - 00:47:53.346, Speaker A: Hot Eigen layer project. It's probably better ods for your project than just launching as this unaffiliated thing.
00:47:53.448 - 00:48:26.190, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the more longer term all these native staking opportunities, if we actually do get a percentage of the proposal set that can actually be meaningful for these commitments, whether it's something like selling block space futures or like pre comps for l two s, these are like the sort of just like mev boost was to some degree just net win win versus this tension of supply side. I want yield demand side, I want cheap security. But we have a long way to get there.
00:48:26.340 - 00:48:57.302, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, Ethereum, layer twos, and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:48:57.302 - 00:49:27.886, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right, guys, on with the show. Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by swell, a liquid restaking protocol and the issuer of the r suite, liquid restaking token. Now, if you're a listener of Bell Curve, you know that I am just so fascinated by restaking and liquid restaking. I think it is going to be one of the most important trends in Ethereum. And I am really excited for the benefit that it unlocks both users and also Ethereum, the protocol itself. Now disclaimer, whenever there's yield involved in a product, do your own research.
00:49:27.886 - 00:49:51.202, Speaker B: This is not financial advice. You guys know the drill. But Swell is a great team. They have a non custodial product and they are mission driven on giving you the best liquid staking experience. If you take one benefit away from using liquid restaking, make it be capital efficiency. Now you can earn passive yield from Ethereum, you can earn yield from multiple actively validated services that stack on top of that. And then you can still use rsweep as collateral in Defi.
00:49:51.202 - 00:50:11.006, Speaker B: And because I know y'all are a bunch of degens, there's a points angle here as well. But in swell we call them pearls. So pearls equal points. And if you stake your eth with Swell, you can earn pearls and future Eigen layer rewards. When there is a token generation event, you can swap your pearls or swell tokens. Head over, click the link at the bottom of this episode. Again, just pause what you're doing right now.
00:50:11.006 - 00:50:13.002, Speaker B: Go click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:50:13.066 - 00:50:13.898, Speaker C: Check out swell.
00:50:13.994 - 00:50:14.494, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:50:14.532 - 00:50:14.878, Speaker E: Later.
00:50:14.964 - 00:50:50.726, Speaker B: Hey everyone, want to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, Flood is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because Flood is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season and this is relevant for both traders and devs. So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to Floodswap and start trading because they solve three massive problems. One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run mev free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price. So head over to Flood swap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes.
00:50:50.726 - 00:51:13.506, Speaker B: We're going to send you right there. For the devs out there you can leverage flood's flexible hooks, allowing you to make swapping a first class primitive by adding custom order types like twaps. Or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of that MEP. If you want to reach out to them, go to devs at flood bid or just jump right in the discord. All right guys, thanks very much. Appreciate you.
00:51:13.528 - 00:51:19.734, Speaker C: Flood, what do you guys think? If I had to hold your feet to what do you think the Eigen layer when it goes live, what do you think that FTV looks like on.
00:51:19.772 - 00:51:21.830, Speaker D: Day 120 billion.
00:51:24.410 - 00:51:28.630, Speaker A: Who knows? I think it launches a lot lower than that.
00:51:28.700 - 00:51:32.438, Speaker D: But it's like, yeah, day one, who knows?
00:51:32.614 - 00:51:43.760, Speaker A: A month in or six months in, I probably agree with Michael, but I don't know. There's going to be a lot of these l ones that are launching at roughly the same valuation. So I don't see it going that high, that fast.
00:51:44.370 - 00:51:57.282, Speaker E: Yeah, like an l one valuation, or is it more like a lido valuation or somewhere in between there? I don't know. I think it's probably closer to the number that you gave out, Michael, but.
00:51:57.336 - 00:52:19.346, Speaker A: It'S going to look wonky. The TBL and Eigen layer is somewhat double counted just because a lot of it is steath. That is the largest LST in there. So you're going to see weird things happen where it's like, if Eigen is at ten and Lido is at. I think it's at like three or four today, people are just going to think about catching or catching up in those trades and how much they're worth and what their roadmaps are, respectively.
00:52:19.538 - 00:52:27.770, Speaker D: Or Celestia is at whatever 1920 and IUDA launches with more throughput.
00:52:28.110 - 00:52:30.060, Speaker E: Yeah, but it's not modular money.
00:52:31.790 - 00:53:01.126, Speaker C: Celestia feels like a natural comp and lido feels like a natural comp. And one other thing that I was starting to think about is like, does this end up putting a lot of pressure on lido? In some ways, there's like a co op edition dynamic in between the two of them. And I do wonder, lyles, you and I talked about this a lot in our liquid staking season, but Lido's always had this opportunity to spin up their own restaking. I forget what it's called. Like, unit within the staking module. Yeah, module. Thank you.
00:53:01.148 - 00:53:01.974, Speaker E: Yeah, there you go.
00:53:02.012 - 00:53:02.806, Speaker C: Do they do that?
00:53:02.908 - 00:53:03.560, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:03.930 - 00:53:22.430, Speaker E: I don't know. It feels like a lot of folks kind of faded restaking, at least to some degree, for a while. And I think people are a little bit surprised of just how much mind share and flows we're seeing right now. And I think I'd be curious to get your thoughts.
00:53:24.050 - 00:53:33.578, Speaker D: I don't know. It is just the airdrop farm. Without that airdrop farm and without Celestia at 20 billion, this would not be the same effect.
00:53:33.764 - 00:54:04.618, Speaker E: So we also have this minimum viable issuance sort of discussion going on in the background, which could push the stake rate closer to zero at some target. Right? And then I think Lido is going to be looking at like, okay, shit, we got to do something. But I think we're entering that potential acceleration of Lido's involvement here. That will be super interesting to see.
00:54:04.784 - 00:54:05.500, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:06.030 - 00:54:12.640, Speaker A: And those two teams are close to I get in Lido, so it wouldn't be kind of like direct competition, but definitely understand what you mean.
00:54:13.090 - 00:55:03.158, Speaker C: Yeah. Just to maybe round this off. And then I wanted to close on. We've been talking a lot about airdrops here in general, and Starquare had their airdrop this week, and I'd love to get your guys take on that. It sounds like we're sort of in agreement that it's not exactly financial leverage, but I think one thing that, and probably the single greatest data point that this won't be the hidden leverage that blows crypto up is that everyone thinks that this is where it's going to be, which is the single strongest data point to indicate that it's probably not going to come from here. Although this is where, if you talk to tradfi types looking at crypto, they're always super interested in where the leverage is because this is just like one of those lessons of financial gravity that just repeats itself over and over. Doesn't really matter what the market is.
00:55:03.158 - 00:55:54.154, Speaker C: But even Vance, in that description, where you were describing you guys restaking it is, I think, helpful, at least for me, to understand what your balance sheet looked like, you as framework. Like, what did your balance sheet look like pre and post the restake? Because let's just actually approach it from the perspective of a solo staker. In a solo staker, it's very simplified balance sheet. Their assets would be the hardware and then the software that they've, I guess, invested in. But then on the liability side, it's like whatever risk you're taking on from slashing risks, that's how those things balance out. And then whatever's left is the equity. And so what does your balance sheet look like after you've opted into, after you've done some restaking? Well, you have an additional income stream, but you also have additional liabilities that you've taken on in the form of more slashing risks.
00:55:54.154 - 00:56:25.910, Speaker C: And I'm making the assumption that eventually they're going to be slashing risks because otherwise this mechanism makes absolutely no sense. The way that I would describe it is it's less of a form of traditional financial leverage because no one's giving you a loan, but something is happening there, right. You can't create something from nothing. And what it kind of looks like to me is more of a form of operational leverage where you're basically taking accepting some ability to generate more revenue at the cost of a very real liability, which is the slashing condition.
00:56:26.570 - 00:56:43.946, Speaker D: I don't think I would call it operational leverage. I think we're conflating leverage and risk. What you're doing is you're putting on more risk. You're not levering up. And that's like a very kind of specific difference. Yes, there's more operational risk. The ABS is you have to slide.
00:56:43.946 - 00:57:01.860, Speaker D: I mean, we talked about this, but there's not any inherent leverage. You can lever, ostensibly in LRT, but that will require you to go to aave or some lending protocol and borrow against it and lever up. But that's a choice you can make. But there is increased risk by participating in these abs.
00:57:02.630 - 00:57:31.534, Speaker A: And right now it's not slashing risk. It's like we're solo staking through our own validator. It's very easy to do. It's one click through, basically any custodian or exchange. And so a lot of the operational risk has been offloaded to the most savvy technical teams on the planet. And so we feel comfortable with that. Where we will reassess is like, what are these abs slashing conditions? And that'll be a different phase of the game that we may or may not participate in.
00:57:31.534 - 00:57:34.240, Speaker A: But there is no leverage here.
00:57:35.250 - 00:57:36.842, Speaker E: What's the yield uplift?
00:57:36.906 - 00:57:37.278, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:37.364 - 00:57:39.082, Speaker E: For what? The slat?
00:57:39.226 - 00:58:11.580, Speaker A: That's a good question. I think that's more correlated to, like, if we think there's, like, call it 5% more risk than just having Steth in our wallet versus putting that into eigen layer, we think that ETh yields are probably 4% ETh denominated. And we're bullish on ETH, obviously. And so if that goes up a lot, we'll benefit in kind. On the abs and eigen layer side, I think it's probably another. I don't know, Michael. 10% to 15% would be my guess.
00:58:11.580 - 00:58:14.218, Speaker A: Maybe higher than that.
00:58:14.384 - 00:58:15.930, Speaker D: All depends on where it comes out.
00:58:16.000 - 00:58:24.350, Speaker A: Right? If it's at 20 billion, maybe it's like 30% or 40% APR APY.
00:58:26.690 - 00:58:28.000, Speaker E: How do you get to that?
00:58:28.450 - 00:58:41.902, Speaker D: Think about this. Here's the basic math. There's 6 billion right now worth of ETH that's being staked. Let's assume everybody's been in the entire time, and the snapshot happens right now. Let's assume they distribute 10% because that's typical airdrop.
00:58:41.966 - 00:58:47.010, Speaker E: Oh, you're talking about airdrop yield. Oh, okay, sorry. I thought you're talking about ABS yield.
00:58:47.610 - 00:59:27.410, Speaker A: ABS yield could be in excess of that. That's probably when you're looking at 100 or 200% if you're playing with the right dollar size. But this is why ETH is the perfect collateral asset, especially for a fund like ours. We can borrow extremely cheaply against it. We can restake it and earn anywhere from, call it 15% to 100% yield. It's going to be really hard. We hold bitcoin, too, but it's going to be really hard for our bitcoin to outperform that actively or quasi actively managed approach, especially when we can, as we've talked about, if we want to lever things up in a way that you can't do with bitcoin on chain.
00:59:29.190 - 00:59:53.722, Speaker E: I'm going to take the other side on that. On the yield, I think it'll be much lower than people think. Because just looking at, let's say again, taking just the deposits at 10 billion, is there a billion dollars of cumulative spend on the avs side on security? Right. If there is, then they should just.
00:59:53.776 - 00:59:55.354, Speaker D: Launch an l. Hold on, hold on.
00:59:55.472 - 01:00:05.438, Speaker A: That's the wrong question, though. So the first question you have to ask is like, let's just do some math. Let's say it launches its celestial evaluations. The Eigen layer token. Let's say they give 10%.
01:00:05.524 - 01:00:06.560, Speaker E: Forget the idea.
01:00:06.930 - 01:00:09.066, Speaker D: Miles is saying independent of the Eigen.
01:00:09.098 - 01:00:12.494, Speaker A: Layer, steady state, steady state, steady state.
01:00:12.612 - 01:00:18.690, Speaker E: I think each avs is going to be like less than 1% yield uplift.
01:00:19.590 - 01:01:17.046, Speaker D: The question here is, what's the value of the iden token? The question here is how much is the cumulative value of all the abs? Basically, it's abs demand. And that, frankly, we've seen pitches for probably close to like 1015 different ABS concepts. The first oracle solution, the first this, the first that. I think that those will come out. And it depends on how big the ecosystem itself can get. If it becomes sort of the cumulative value of something like DeFi on ETH, then yeah, the yield could be pretty high in the steady state. But I also think the main point here is, if you're staking right now, or if you're contributing right now, you're going to get the ilayer airdrop, and there's going to be Eigen layer distributions probably for a period of time after, whenever those go away, is what Miles is saying.
01:01:17.046 - 01:01:18.946, Speaker D: It's like, what's the SETI state? Who knows?
01:01:18.978 - 01:01:48.074, Speaker C: There one other wrinkle there, Miles would be, is Eigen layer going to be the only, like, Eigen layer? Is sort of the ETH solution for shared security and exporting security. But there are other ecosystem specific solutions. Like in Cosmos, you have interchange. A. There was an integration this week, even in between Babylon and the hub. So now there's an attempt to essentially do some form of bitcoin shared security. And it's unclear.
01:01:48.074 - 01:02:15.586, Speaker C: There's obviously, demand for restaking in other ecosystems. Like, Skip has a really cool example of this with their new oracle, which is kind of leveraging ABCI plus, but they're calling it restaking. It's very similar. But, yeah, it's sort of unclear whether or not other ecosystems will look to ETH for security or their own sort of ecosystem. Homegrown security solutions is another big question. Yeah, basically, is this all eigen layer demand, or is it going to be segmented by ecosystem?
01:02:15.778 - 01:02:55.250, Speaker A: The reality is that ETH is the only asset that is big enough to get you the distribution that you would want or need as an abs. We're looking at a bunch of l two s right now, and some of them are, like, SVM virtual machine, secured by ETH. Da, done by Celestia. They have all of the kind of different amalgamations. But the go to market is we're going to give a bunch of money to ETh holders to get them to bridge over. And it's like, well, why don't you start with Salana? And I think Salana is part of it. But the biggest LST protocol on Salana right now is Jito, and there's about 8 million soul staked.
01:02:55.250 - 01:03:34.062, Speaker A: 8 million soul staked is about 800 million swell, which is a smaller liquid restaking token, has about the same TbL as that. And so, as you think about what the goals of your project are, you have to address an asset base that is large enough to get the goals that are, if it's distribution, if it's community alignment, if it's whatever. And so I think the restaking efforts on the other chains are going to be a lot smaller. We are investors in Jito. We are investors in Babylon, the one you just mentioned. The thing that I could see changing here is that it is so easy to restake. I mean, it isn't that easy.
01:03:34.062 - 01:03:49.400, Speaker A: Maybe that's a little overstatement, but doing it one click out of Coinbase, where a lot of these bitcoin assets live, maybe that gives you an uptick there. But people don't really use bitcoin in the same way that they do eth. I think that's just, like, a base fact.
01:03:50.250 - 01:04:38.040, Speaker D: I think bitcoin is a lot more sedentary just by default. But I will say though, and we're investors as well. As well, it's going to be, like we said, someone who can really build the relationships with the abscess, who's going to win this liquid free staking market. And is that going to be someone in the bitcoin ecosystem who's going after bitcoin, l two s, and all these different kind of new narratives possible. But if you're in the ETH ecosystem, you can be relatively smaller than the biggest opportunity in another competitive ecosystem like Salana, and still have an opportunity to shine. And so I think there's going to be a lot of stuff that we're figuring out with lrts in the next three to six months.
01:04:40.250 - 01:05:32.066, Speaker C: One last thing as well, before I want to close on the starkware airdrop. But another thing that I feel like, because we've all just had bear market PTSD, is that, I don't know, the one thing that at least I have gotten wrong when I'm trying to do business planning for blockworks at this point in the cycle is just the raw amount of demand that shows up. As bullish as you always think you are, it's like you tend to underestimate the amount of demand that shows up. I've done pro formas and blockworks on a rolling quarterly basis for six years, and I'm always wrong at this point. So there is a possibility that it could take like a couple cycles or a couple of churns, so to speak, to get steady state Avs demand. To a certain point, I could see it not all coming online in time to meet the amount of supply side from the Eigen layer marketplace. But long term, I sort of feel like it will be less of a concern.
01:05:32.178 - 01:06:07.806, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's fair. I think it also makes a difference if the AVss are looking at this as just a security spend line item or also a growth line item, right? If there is a distribution aspect to being just in the Eigen layer marketplace, I think that you can justify something like, okay, I have a 500 million dollar sort of treasury, right, I'm actually a pretty big project, like maybe an Espresso or a hyperlane, and I want to offer some decent size yield I can pay that looks like an l one.
01:06:07.988 - 01:06:38.890, Speaker D: I think that that's actually going to be the meta theme of this cycle, which is that we switch from having a I'm built on this for security, I'm built on that for throughput or technical implementation details. We're going to move towards. I am built on this platform for growth reasons because I want to get to millions of users using my platform. Totally going to happen for games, it's going to happen for consumer applications, it's going to happen for base. This is going to be the meta narrative that I think we all get to over the next year.
01:06:39.040 - 01:07:01.010, Speaker A: Nothing else matters unless you have distribution. And we saw this play out in the last cycle where you had all the Solana ecosystem projects, all the Luna ecosystem projects. Their whole thing was, we're going to ride the coattails of this movement that's really picking up steam. And I think the alignment meme of probably last year is going to get flipped on its head because now you have an alignment mechanism.
01:07:03.430 - 01:07:08.018, Speaker C: Yeah. All right. I want to just move on to spend 10 minutes.
01:07:08.024 - 01:07:09.686, Speaker D: Mike wants to talk. Start wearing real bad.
01:07:09.708 - 01:07:15.686, Speaker C: No, I don't really want to talk. Well, I'm just curious to see where you guys fall on this, because I.
01:07:15.708 - 01:07:17.480, Speaker A: Do feel like we didn't get any.
01:07:18.010 - 01:07:19.314, Speaker B: I didn't get any either.
01:07:19.452 - 01:07:36.202, Speaker C: I got none either. So bad. Yeah, but. All right, so here's, I'm going to show a screenshot of what the distribution ultimately was. And people were pretty divided on their drop. So 51.3% went to Starknet users.
01:07:36.202 - 01:08:18.794, Speaker C: About 506,000 people got that. Then there was a spread like the next biggest group was ETH stakers, which was almost just under 22%. There were some donations to the Ethereum protocol guild members, which is decently low, open source developers, Starkx users, and, yeah, Ethereum dev. So basically some people thought this was a very well architected sort of airdrop. There was another group of people that pushed back quite a bit. And there's always going to be somewhat of unhappiness post airdrop, but maybe I'll put it in two camps. Right? There's kind of like.
01:08:18.794 - 01:08:57.000, Speaker C: And this is the way that I see it, you guys can push back on me. And I think there's one group of people that says, the way that we do airdrops today are stupid. You are literally just giving money away. Like, look at the overall cost of an airdrop. Like, we have to find a way to either get this money into the right people's hands or to find a way to build organic demand. And then there's this other group of people, and I agree with some parts of that and disagree with other parts. And then there's another group of people which honestly, in my opinion, tends to be like a lot of non sort of trading accounts, which there is kind of an airdrop entitlement, which is like they just get expected to get dropped a massive amount of tokens that the implication is they're kind of going to sell it.
01:08:57.000 - 01:09:27.522, Speaker C: And maybe the one other point that I'll bring up with regards to the specific airdrop is they didn't really do themselves any favors in this public messaging, which is how I think a lot of founders feel like this privately. But one of the Starquare guys, not to call anyone out here, but this has been all over Twitter, so I don't feel that bad. Know, tweeted out, a, we don't owe you anything. B, no one asked you to do anything. C, we care about community much more than you think. D we are here for the long run. If you don't understand this, go farm useless bullshit products.
01:09:27.522 - 01:09:44.502, Speaker C: There are plenty of those. So even though probably a lot of founders feel like that, I feel like that has kind of blown back on them in a decent way, and I'll stop there. And I would love to get your guys sense of how you thought about this airdrop and what you think about airdrops sort of writ large where you fall.
01:09:44.556 - 01:09:46.902, Speaker A: I mean, stupid tweet by that guy.
01:09:47.036 - 01:09:48.218, Speaker D: What's the upside there?
01:09:48.304 - 01:09:50.780, Speaker A: Just like antagonizing your community for no reason.
01:09:52.030 - 01:10:06.160, Speaker D: I think that's actually pretty representative of the stark perspective. That is true. Really large. They want to build in a silo, they don't really care about community. And I think that that kind of shines through.
01:10:06.690 - 01:10:54.078, Speaker A: Just the other thing I will say is the actual TGE being two years in the past, and all these investors are going to unlock in like three months. And we've talked a lot about cliffs and token supply matters in a very real way because there's financial gravity when people sell things, but you're just going to hit this fucking cliff in two or three months. And on Avo right now, it's trading at, I think like 17 billion or something. So who knows if that's a real bid or not. But assume that this is not going to go well because of that TgE question. And usually what happens when there's a TGE is the token is generated, and then you start the best. We started the best two years ago, and it's going to hit in three months.
01:10:54.244 - 01:11:22.966, Speaker D: There's like the Token Genesis event when you deploy the contracts on chain, when the token is tradable. All those things are usually kind of baked into the same process where you have a live token, it's airdropped to people it's tradable. It gets implemented on exchanges. There's liquidity for it. People are able to stake it, do whatever they want to do with it, whatever they can do with it. And that's the token Genesis event. There is an element that happens before that, which is like, hey, we put our token on chain, nobody knows about it.
01:11:22.966 - 01:11:40.700, Speaker D: It's not in a script contract, it's worth nothing. It's not even tradable. But the software is on chain, it's been audited, et cetera. It seems like they just mixed up which event was which. Good for the investors, because they will get an exit liquidity in two months.
01:11:42.030 - 01:12:15.030, Speaker A: So things, they did well on this, I think, number one, they filtered out a lot of the civil stuff, just like any projects listening to this. Civil people are not your friends. I don't care if you have a bajillion transactions per day. These people are just farming your shit, and they're not going to give anything back to you. These are mercenaries. I think what they didn't do as well, and I'd like to see more people do well, is like, what was the highest allocation that somebody got? I think it was like 200,000 or maybe like 100,000 Starquare tokens.
01:12:17.050 - 01:12:23.510, Speaker E: Some of the actual development shops within Starquare, I think they're much, much bigger.
01:12:23.670 - 01:12:50.590, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the development shops and giving tokens to ecosystem teams on balance, like an okay use of tokens, but you should really just be giving those to your users. Do not be gun shy about making your users rich and aligning them with you. And you can put guardrails on it. You have to do tasks. Even the blast kind of like cringe posting is like kind of. It's just a good growth hack. Like make them vests.
01:12:50.590 - 01:13:16.902, Speaker A: There's a bunch of different stuff that people can do. And you're giving out, I think, $1.2 billion of Star wars tokens. These prices, damn. So look, I remember when we got the Uni V two airdrop, Michael, and we made just a shitload of money on that. But it was just like we were the largest Uniswap LP for a year and a half. We have always used it for a lot of our liquidity solutions.
01:13:16.902 - 01:13:33.178, Speaker A: We are aligned with them. We probably brought more volume and value than that airdrop has given to us. And I think that's how people should think about these things. Like the whales are your friends, especially in defi and TvL type of games. So that's my perspective at least.
01:13:33.284 - 01:14:20.240, Speaker E: Maybe agree with all that one observation, I was cracking up at Hayden from uniswap tweeted. His tweets have been very spicy lately, by the way. Yeah, I enjoyed them. He said, like, gas fees, Mev extraction, deflationary economy, not enough. You now have to airdrop to eth stakers to be aligned if you want to help Ethereum airdrop to Uniswap users who are getting crushed by fees and whatnot. And I think this points to just like, yeah, it's interesting that the whole point of airdrop is to kind of bootstrap the demand side of both devs and users, and yet you're rewarding Ethereum's kind of supply side of stakers. Which, sure, there's overlap there, but yeah, I'm not sure about this whole.
01:14:20.690 - 01:14:38.742, Speaker A: I think Hayden has one of the poorest senses of the ETH community, which is incredibly ironic given how much he's contributed. But the protocol guilds and we should pay uniswap instead of Ethereum. I just basically have no, that part I agree with.
01:14:38.876 - 01:14:48.920, Speaker E: I agree with, but it feels like he's kind of the one voice calling for the apps sometimes, or like maybe pushing back a little bit.
01:14:49.930 - 01:14:57.018, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I don't know. I think he's in his own bubble in many ways.
01:14:57.104 - 01:14:59.434, Speaker E: Yeah, that's fair.
01:14:59.472 - 01:15:28.502, Speaker C: It's just different perspectives, different perspectives in the ecosystem. I would generally be in the camp of, like, I actually have enjoyed some of Hayden's spicier tweets. At least we're, at least we're stirring the pot, which I think is always good. But I also think probably I'd be less in favor generally of, like, whatever the equivalent is of what's it called in value. Like, you're shouting your values out. I forget I'm blanking on the sexual virtue signaling. Thank you.
01:15:28.502 - 01:15:57.694, Speaker C: I would be less in favor of anything that even looks like virtual signaling. Basically, I think starknet should be doing things like making their users wealthy and aligned and sticky. I feel like that's where almost, like, the richest design space is yet to be sort of thought out for airdrops. And I do remember a couple of years ago, all these talking to defi founders, and they were like, yeah, we messed airdrops up. It was impossible. The expectation was just to dump tokens without any vesting schedule. I think that's going to be solved during the bear market.
01:15:57.694 - 01:16:29.426, Speaker C: And it's like, didn't really get solved. I do think it's totally reasonable to say, hey, if I'm going to airdrop you, 4100 $200,000 that this vest and you have to do some stuff with it afterwards that just feels super reasonable. And it shouldn't be wildly overly complicated, I don't think. But yeah, it feels like there's still some work to do in that whole area about how to make people sticky. And that shouldn't be a problem for the real organic users, right? Because in theory they're there anyway, I'm.
01:16:29.458 - 01:16:47.600, Speaker A: Looking forward, like, these are mostly TvL type airdrops. I'm looking forward to seeing some of the gaming ones where it's like, here's a token, play a game. Here's a token, do this quest. Here's a token, buy this. Nft. It's tough when you have that moment in time snapshot where it's like, boom, the airdrop is over. Here's all the money.
01:16:47.600 - 01:17:19.030, Speaker A: It works much better if it's a user count focused airdrop that you can kind of drip over time and make contingent on things. I think that's how we're going to see 100 million people come into the space in the next nine months. It's just like what happens when the IMX airdrop and all the games happens? What happens when these are the things that can really bring in different types of users and they can be more sticky because they're not used to this, like, shit, I just got an airdrop mentality.
01:17:20.170 - 01:17:20.920, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:17:23.370 - 01:17:24.566, Speaker D: I have to run, guys.
01:17:24.668 - 01:17:28.294, Speaker C: Yes. I think we got a shot. All right, guys, this was a really fun one. Appreciate y'all.
01:17:28.422 - 01:17:29.850, Speaker E: All right, awesome, guys.
01:17:29.920 - 01:17:30.346, Speaker A: Later.
01:17:30.448 - 01:17:52.270, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we're incredibly excited to have teamed up with the wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts which you can get and mint for free.

01:17:54.026 - 01:18:08.210, Speaker C: Take you get your free tight.
