00:00:26.650 - 00:00:31.714, Speaker B: All right everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two, vince and Yano.
00:00:31.762 - 00:00:32.594, Speaker A: We got happy Mike.
00:00:32.642 - 00:00:33.240, Speaker C: Now.
00:00:34.490 - 00:00:37.590, Speaker B: This is the radio voice. This is the face, the smile.
00:00:38.010 - 00:00:39.078, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:00:39.244 - 00:00:42.162, Speaker B: How are we doing, guys? You guys recovered from permission?
00:00:42.226 - 00:00:50.986, Speaker D: No more conferences for a little bit. I think I'm off the conference tour. I'm here in New York. I don't know if I'm going to go to Main Net, maybe just the dinners and stuff, but I thought permissionless was great.
00:00:51.088 - 00:01:02.030, Speaker B: It's a cool there's. Honestly. The south is just as someone who grew up in the north, the south gets something that the north doesn't get. They're much more laid, like just just more chilled and ready.
00:01:02.180 - 00:01:04.100, Speaker A: I don't know if Austin is the.
00:01:06.230 - 00:01:23.190, Speaker B: Though I was in Nashville once and I said basically something like what? I just said like, oh, the south is there's something really cool about the south. It's like I went to a school in the south, in Atlanta, and this guy's like, Atlanta is the New York of the south. I was like, oh shit. All right, never mind then.
00:01:23.260 - 00:01:23.862, Speaker D: Really get there.
00:01:23.916 - 00:02:03.886, Speaker B: Let's start talking about crypto stuff. I would be curious. I kind of want to start by talking about Eclipse. So Eclipse, Neil Simone, the founder, spoke at permissionless and he's got a company called Eclipse. They were an SVM based roll up as a service product that announced this week that they were launching a roll up on Ethereum. So what's particularly interesting about Neil's design choice for Eclipse is that it uses the Solana virtual machine. And there's a bunch of advantages that the SVM has over the EVM, excluding network effect, where the EVM is definitely winning.
00:02:03.886 - 00:02:46.446, Speaker B: The major reason why you'd want to use the SVM is parallel runtime, so local fee markets, parallel execution is built right into that. The EVM has a single thread processor which just limits its scale. Whereas the SVM can do parallel execution. They're also using Celestia for data availability, so they're not using ETH validator set for DA and they're using Risk Zero for proofs. So in a sense you could bill it as sort of a best of all worlds situation where you have very fast execution, really cheap DA, and it still settles down to ETH. And I think they're going to use ETH as the gas token as well. So it's kind of a very interesting blend of a whole bunch of different ecosystems.
00:02:46.446 - 00:02:47.954, Speaker B: I'd be curious what you guys thought.
00:02:47.992 - 00:03:04.774, Speaker D: About this it's kind of the opposite of Neon, right? Which was bringing the EVM to Solana. That was very hyped up because it was like EVM has network effects, solidity has lots of developers on It people.
00:03:04.892 - 00:03:07.590, Speaker A: Well, I think they're using neon here.
00:03:07.660 - 00:03:09.180, Speaker D: They're using neon here.
00:03:09.790 - 00:03:42.754, Speaker A: Yeah. They're using Neon for EVM compatibility. So if you want to easily deploy EVM smart contracts on Eclipse, you can do it through not just so it's DN celestial like Mike mentioned, SVM for Execution sediment on Ethereum, ETH is the gas token. And then proving is using Risk Zero for ZK proofs. And then EVM compatibility via Neon EVM. It's like the first time I've ever seen the full modular, not just on DA and Execution and stuff like bringing all these different providers together.
00:03:42.872 - 00:04:23.306, Speaker D: I think it's probably not as relevant for DeFi. I think it's most relevant for games where local fee markets actually matter because one game clogs polygon proof of stake. There needs to be some other scaling solution than just launching all these games on a single threaded chain. So I think this is like it's interesting from a technical perspective. I think the Ramifications will play out when there's all these games clogging all these different L two S. There will 100% be that. And I honestly do think the parallelized version of scaling blockchains makes sense for high density, high throughput markets like gaming.
00:04:23.306 - 00:04:24.478, Speaker D: So I think it's pretty interesting.
00:04:24.564 - 00:04:26.750, Speaker A: Mike, what do you think about this? You called this early.
00:04:26.820 - 00:05:19.262, Speaker B: No, I just think Michael and I actually talked about this when it was just the two of us. But I think the way you could like the problem that most blockchains are running into is one of scale and there's a couple of different so like ETH main chain runs into this problem where Ethereum, the network is optimized for solo validators that have very low hardware requirements. So there's just limited throughput that you can do on main chain. And one of the big problems with ETH and specifically the way that they allocate resources is that all the resources are sort of coupled. So one, there's just not very high throughput on ETH main chain. But then two, the way gas fees are calculated is there are two inputs, it's the base fee and then there's the computational resources that each transaction requires. So what you can get is if there's a really hot NFT Mint, it can multiply the base fee and then that base fee gets applied to transactions on uniswap.
00:05:19.262 - 00:06:15.250, Speaker B: So the resources are coupled in a way that doesn't really make sense. So what Solana, there's a couple of ways that you could solve that, which is, one, to just put every single blockchain application on its own chain, which is sort of the ETH roll up. Like that's the Op stack version of how to solve this problem. The other way that you could solve it is to actually keep everything on one settlement layer and chain, but do what Solana did by creating local fee markets and parallel processing and I don't know, I think a big question for me is how much? 4844. And Dank Sharding is actually going to reduce the costs of these roll ups. And the way I've been thinking about it recently is that it's not going to reduce costs that much, especially on the canonical roll ups that still use DA or Ethereum for data availability. So I think you need one of these roll ups to try something like the solution that Eclipse is pioneering here.
00:06:15.250 - 00:06:49.646, Speaker B: And I actually am starting to get a little bearish on just how many app specific roll ups do you really need? I'm kind of starting to get a little bearish on that idea. So I think what Neil has done is very clever in terms of the design and then it's going to be down to his BD chops to actually go and recruit developers. And who he's probably competing with for devs is Solana because these are rust devs. I think that he's hoping to bring over and build applications. I really like the architecture, but yeah, that's what I think about it.
00:06:49.748 - 00:06:58.818, Speaker D: I wonder what on an average day, this is paying to ETH to settle if it's not paying for DA. Do you have a sense of that?
00:06:58.904 - 00:07:32.874, Speaker B: Dude, it's nothing. It's like $100 a day or something like that. On the order of $100 a day? Yeah, as soon as you accept a modular roadmap. What you don't know, what nobody knows and everyone's guessing at right now, is where the network effects are, like what layer the network effects accrue to. And maybe because we started this whole industry in bitcoin, the settlement layer, like, how many times have you heard that? Settlement, settlement, settlement. It's all about that. I don't know.
00:07:32.874 - 00:08:15.594, Speaker B: But it could not be settlement, right? You could imagine. Whether you know it or not, your base view has probably been very oriented around. Well, you provide a lot of security at the base layer, make really good settlement assurances, and then everyone's going to have to come to you. And there's going to be this bottleneck of supply and demand where you could totally flip your framing and say, actually, all of the stickiness is going to accrue at the execution layer, and there's just going to be these interchangeable parts that you can swap in and out at the base layer. And it's probably not going to be as simple as one of those framings, but I think projects like Neil's is going to make people question some of their assumptions about where value actually ends up accruing, is what I think.
00:08:15.712 - 00:08:56.534, Speaker C: Not to say that this will play out in the same way, but it does kind of remind me of what the mid 2010s whole SaaS business model was, which was basically just like wrappers on top of AWS or GCP and it was all this narrative of oh, well, it's going to be Dropbox. And Dropbox owns the customer relationship and Dropbox is what people think about. But in reality it's just this cloud storage built on top of S three, EC two. And we've talked about this as well, Mike, but the value ultimately still accrued to AWS. It's just because everybody thought, oh, well, we'll just go off and build our own. We'll have our own. It's going to be better that way, it'll be cheaper that way.
00:08:56.534 - 00:09:18.734, Speaker C: But in reality it's cheaper to have AWS because they have economies of scale. So I kind of wonder if settlement will become the same thing. The narrative of we don't need to do anybody else's settlement is becoming more pronounced. But I think ultimately people are going to realize it's better just to have the same security. And even if it is the cheapest way, it's better to rely on somebody else for handling that.
00:09:18.852 - 00:09:44.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I still don't think, though, even if people everyone uses ETH for settlement, that's necessarily bullish. Not that this is necessarily what we're talking about, but ETH token price, I don't know if that means that value has to accrue to ETH, the token. So Celestia is launching soon. So Eclipse is using Celestia. Eclipse hasn't launched their main net yet. They're going to use Celestia. So I guess that Celestia is going to launch before Eclipse launches their main net.
00:09:44.854 - 00:09:59.258, Speaker B: So is that not that this is the not financial advice section, but what does this mean for ETH price and just the demand for ETH if all these roll ups start using Celestia for data availability? How do you guys think about that?
00:09:59.344 - 00:10:39.914, Speaker D: So I think there's not financial advice, no price predictions, all of those caveats. I think there's two elements to a token's price in my mind. One is the fees, the underlying, and the other is the monetary premium. And the only two assets that have monetary premium are basically ETH and Bitcoin in my mind at least. And by entering that category, you enter into a more expansive valuation. Heuristic like, what is gold worth? People just say it's worth what it's worth because it's been worth that for thousands of years. And so if you think ETH and Bitcoin have that lendiness, the market is pretty sufficiently large as long as it's used as money.
00:10:39.914 - 00:11:29.222, Speaker D: And where does it get its money use case from? Eclipse is using ETH as the gas token. We've talked about this a little bit. It's like, is that ETH burnt when it crosses the bridge? People just came out of the woodwork when I tweeted that. I don't think it's entirely that way, but I do think there is some element of putting it on a chain as a use case that looks and feels like money. And then you have the DFI and the NFTs and the games that live on ETH l one, and that's kind of where the fees come from. I do think the other part of this is if we already have I don't even know how many roll ups we have 200 at this point, more than 100 for sure, at least in production. If we are underestimating the amount of roll ups by two orders of magnitude, maybe that is enough just to add more incremental fees and build that story.
00:11:29.222 - 00:11:42.080, Speaker D: But at some level, the valuation heuristics of the ETH token price are more determined by how much of it is used as money versus the fees. That's at least what I think.
00:11:45.250 - 00:11:45.566, Speaker C: All.
00:11:45.588 - 00:12:00.418, Speaker D: The friend tech keys are priced in ETH. When you see ETH bridging to new L two S, you know that money is there to speculate. It's a very unique asset. It's impossible to value on just fundamentals one.
00:12:00.504 - 00:12:45.390, Speaker C: And it's also highly possible, once again, not financial advice that we see a J curve in terms of how much of the fundamentals or which direction the fundamentals go. And I have been doing a little bit of research on what this new 4844 will do to the economics. And there's going to be three Blob spaces per block, which means that there's going to be three roll ups that can put their Blobs in a block. And if we already have 100 roll ups, think about what that's going to do. Like, how often is your roll up going to go? Settle back to Ethel one. Is it going to be once every ten minutes? Is it going to be once every ten blocks? Who knows, right? There's only three spots. And I would imagine that we're still going to see the continuation of roll apps.
00:12:45.390 - 00:13:09.030, Speaker C: We're not going to stop at 100. Who knows where we end up maxing out in terms of the number of roll ups, but I think there's not going to be that much available space for roll apps to be able to deploy onto Ethel one. And so I don't know. I mean, it may go down in the meantime in terms of the amount of transaction volume or transaction fees, but I would say directionally, it's going up.
00:13:09.100 - 00:14:08.214, Speaker D: If you think about the high level. Mike, I totally am sympathetic to your argument, but if I look at what happened on chain today, finance spiked it to like 100 GWe because they were using some inefficient script to move assets off of their exchange. The scaling problem is fixed and fees are low until fees are incredibly high. In my view, the validator business is big lumpy days. That's really what you want, right? And so, sure, if you think about what the yields on ETH could be, let's say that ETH doubles in terms of staked and what you're earning as a yield, you're probably earning low threes most of the time in terms of yield. But whenever there's even a smidgen of activity, you're back in the six 7% range. And it's kind of hard to pinpoint when exactly that happens, but it's just when basically the market turns back on, so it's levered to the cycle effectively.
00:14:08.214 - 00:14:42.514, Speaker D: Yields are always going to be lower in bear markets. The other thing that I think is really kind of like central to this question is what role does restaked ETH play? Because that's like another money, like, use case where it's like, sure, the fees on ETH most of the time are like, say you net out on average in the fours. You can augment that with basically ETH centric yield farms where you're taking your ETH and going off and validating other Das, other bridges, other oracles. That is a very bizarre use case that you can't quantify in a financial model, but it adds the monetary premium.
00:14:42.642 - 00:15:07.722, Speaker B: I agree with, um, I have a couple of thoughts on that. So one, just a note about that. Three Blobs per slot, that actually isn't limited to roll ups. So the market for Blob space is a permissionless market, so you could have an NFT project Mint using Blob space, so it's even slightly more constrained than three roll ups per slob.
00:15:07.866 - 00:15:25.140, Speaker D: Do you remember in the bull market when it was like three grand? Yeah, I think that's going to come back, but I think it's going to be like, you look at the biggest fee days and you can see them on a chart for ETH, they're like 100 times the next closest days.
00:15:27.350 - 00:15:35.794, Speaker A: You think some of those days come back. When was one of those days? What's an example, for example, people forget.
00:15:35.842 - 00:16:12.402, Speaker D: But all of those NFT mints were like sold out, gas, war, goomba, all of the ICOs, same thing. Everyone racing to hit that one endpoint. And that's like the essence of why ethereum block space is actually differentiated. It's because that stuff happens on it and it's viewed as this high touch, high class, high gloss block space. So that only manifests in terms of super high fee markets every once in a while. But I'm not as bearish on the fee outlook as most people. I think you're still going to be in the fours when it comes down to, like, you clock out a year.
00:16:12.402 - 00:16:15.220, Speaker D: What did you actually make? That would be my guess.
00:16:16.070 - 00:16:39.114, Speaker C: I think it was November or maybe it was October last year. There were like four or five days straight of really high fees, and that jumped the yield to like 8910 percent. And that was post merge. That was the highest yield I think we've had in terms of a week, but that was pushing double digits and that was 2022.
00:16:39.312 - 00:16:42.602, Speaker D: Let's talk about the converse of this argument, which is kind of the argument.
00:16:42.746 - 00:17:28.678, Speaker B: For L two, there's some concept, right, of like a laffer curve, right, which is where you're actually missing out on some amount of transactions here. It's like dead weight load or something like that. Where when fees spiked that degree, there was a lot of people that are just priced out of making transactions at there's. Like if you use the example of Solana maybe being way too cheap relative to the use cases that we need today versus every trade costs a million dollars, right? Like, obviously if every trade costs that much, no one makes a transaction. There's some sweet spot where actually it's all very optimized in terms of the maximizing the amount of people that are making transactions, then actually fees that get paid back. So it's kind of like what Multicoin talks about, the reverse network effects, right, of the fee market on Ethereum.
00:17:28.774 - 00:18:19.050, Speaker D: I think that's right. If you do the math, basically what you come up with is that if your transactions are sub one cent, you need 100 million of them per day to make 20 to 30 million sequencer profit per year. And so the strategy of teams being like, we're going to drive block space cost to zero, it's like that is a strategy. You can definitely differentiate yourself, I guess, now less than you used to be able to. But that is actually a shit business model where how do you get 100 million transactions on chain? You're building something that probably more looks like Rweave or like filecoin or like you're trying to put high volume, high quantity data on chain. I don't know if that's necessarily where you want to be if you're trying to bootstrap a native asset as something other than just like pseudo equity.
00:18:20.430 - 00:18:25.920, Speaker C: Because frankly, we haven't seen an application that has that much throughput on chain. Right. Ever.
00:18:27.010 - 00:19:18.974, Speaker D: I think there will be some. But if 100 million transactions per day is the bar for 20 to 30 million in profit, that's a tough business model. I also think it's better to start with more expensive block space and then work your way down. Why is that a better strategy? Because you are signaling the high quality, the high gloss bitcoin ETH. A lot of the early days of that were just like, it's so inefficient, but the demand was overwhelming compared to the supply. And then over time, you kind of just drive supply of block space higher and you're able to kind of smooth out that transition. And so you have to take the ten to 20 year view of these things if you're going to ask the questions of where are fees going to accrue, where is value going to accrue, it's going to be interesting.
00:19:18.974 - 00:19:49.362, Speaker D: The other thing I'll say is that I do think that there's going to be this weird catch up effect of Dank Sharding kind of taking over some of the scalability load from these L two S, right. As they're in their own kind of process of figuring out how do you get to that 100 million transactions per day. So it's going to be different for even the L two S. I don't think the L two S have clearly run away with the market compared to the L1s. They're just at a different point in their scaling roadmap.
00:19:49.426 - 00:20:38.566, Speaker B: I don't disagree with anything that you're saying either. I'm trying to game out. What I've been recently thinking about is what is going to happen when the bull market ends up returning? Like, how are things going to play out? And I think there's like one scenario where I think activity starts coming back, gas fees start going up, and then people are like, that's okay, we have roll ups, but I don't think 4844 is going to solve the fees for most roll ups because you're still paying DA to Ethereum. So there's a lot of burn going on. The fees are high, yields are going up for stakers, profit is being returned. That's good for the network. But I think at some point this is where Solana and some of the other altl ones won last time, right? Everyone's like, this is crazy, we haven't solved the fee thing.
00:20:38.566 - 00:21:33.526, Speaker B: And then people start looking for cheaper alternatives. And at this point in the cycle, no one really cares about security, right? Like, everyone does kind of dumb stuff. And that's where I think somewhere like either Eclipse, which uses the SVM and Celestia for DA starts winning or Solana starts winning. The other version of the future that could work as well is if we just change the definition of what constitutes a canonical roll up. And the Dankrad argument is kind of like, people don't care about and they're like, you know what, DA is actually not part of being a roll up. You don't have to use ETH, DA, and we can just use Eigenda or Vale or Celestia or whatever, and then I think the fees will go down drastically on roll ups and then ETH and the roll up landscape will do a lot better. But that's what I'm kind of trying to think out right now, is who ends up winning and who ends up getting a bunch of their new users from this next cycle.
00:21:33.718 - 00:22:10.646, Speaker D: The lived experience of developers on the ground is like, you launched on a super chain. You launched on a fucking ghost island, nobody's there. It really is not a technology first argument. I'm pretty sure you could build a centralized blockchain roll up, validium whatever, and actually get your blockchain cost to zero. I don't know how much good that would do you if the main benefits of crypto are composability community open source permissionlessness. And so it isn't always a strictly technical argument. I do agree with you on the narrative of fees are going to go up.
00:22:10.646 - 00:22:47.710, Speaker D: People are going to be like, oh my God, fees are like five, six, seven, 8% again, crazy NFT mints, crazy games, whatever. Literally, the stuff that was driving the fee spike in first quarter was like this one XNET Ponzi thing. It was like this single weird Chinese app that had no sensitivity to gas prices. It's as simple as that. And you have a couple of those, three of those four of those sentiment turns like fees are going to go back up. The question is when that stops activity out. Because there was a point where it was just like, I can't introduce anybody to ETH because it literally is so expensive to onboard, then it just doesn't make sense.
00:22:47.710 - 00:23:07.400, Speaker D: I don't think we're going to get there again because that load will probably be handled by roll ups. But I do think the games are going to break the roll ups if they really take off. And that's kind of where the question is going to be like, how much of this should we put on chain? What other modular architecture can drive our cost down? That type of stuff.
00:23:08.990 - 00:23:47.158, Speaker C: I think one of the variables that I was thinking about recently is at what price point does it become beneficial to have basically the application pay the gas fees on behalf of the consumer? And I think that will be a flipping point when it's so cheap that, okay, great, we'll just bake this into our cost of goods sold. We'll bake this into something that's extracted away for the user account abstraction. That's great. The wallet will handle it, the app will handle it, what have you. And so I think ultimately you're going to get to a point where it becomes so cheap that you actually don't have to pay anything anymore. And it's not because no one's paying, it's just because the user is now not having to pay.
00:23:47.244 - 00:24:27.454, Speaker D: People love to talk about the burn. The burn does not, in our opinion, drive ETH prices. There is no price impact from that except on the super long indeterminate time period where it's like Apple took like a quarter of their shares out of the market compared to the past ten years. Maybe that on the margin drives some of the action, but the thing that drives action is demand. Even in this current market. Kind of what I see at least is there are not a lot of sellers, but there's not a lot of buyers. But when the buyers show up, you saw that huge volatile round trip that BTC and ETH took over 27 into the high 16 hundreds.
00:24:27.454 - 00:24:52.006, Speaker D: That's kind of what happens. And so what can drive demand for that? That's the name brand recognition of ethereum being the gas token on every chain. It's the ability for ETH to be composable into restaking, to be used in DFI, unless another asset becomes that. I don't see the same level of bullcase for it.
00:24:52.188 - 00:25:38.586, Speaker B: The 1559 also. I mean, the reason it kind of got co opted by this ultrasound money meme and the burn and people like to talk about and they think it's a supply based argument. But my understanding of why the burn got implemented is because ethereum as a protocol doesn't want to have to make a choice about where those there's, like, security reasons for not wanting to. The burn is actually more about a security and anti collusion thing for validators than it is about number go up technology. And actually, if you look at how it's done in cosmos, it's extremely different. A lot of the fees that the protocol or the Cosmos hub makes is kind of like redirected via the hub, which is that's not very money like. So I hear you on that.
00:25:38.586 - 00:25:45.050, Speaker B: And I think that is a big part of ETH's value. Prop is ETH could become a denomination.
00:25:45.550 - 00:26:09.314, Speaker D: It already has. And finding something product market fit for something as money is the hardest thing to do of anything It requires people to actually own it. Think of it as money. Think of it as a store of value. Use it in credit. Use it to pay for things. That is a decade long process that involves going 100 X up and 99% down multiple times and having people hold on with you.
00:26:09.314 - 00:26:17.938, Speaker D: And so I don't think you can make something money if you tried. It just kind of happens.
00:26:18.104 - 00:26:46.494, Speaker B: I don't know. This is where I do think I think crypto is net new and people would really object to is it a money or is it a commodity? Because that would inherently put it in some bucket that you have in your mind. And therefore, the valuation, heuristic would be changed. But I just think crypto is a net new thing, actually. And to call it a month. There are money like properties. There are also, frankly, commodity like properties of this thing.
00:26:46.494 - 00:26:51.294, Speaker B: Like like is oil money. In a sense, oil's the realest money.
00:26:51.332 - 00:26:52.126, Speaker D: That there is, right?
00:26:52.148 - 00:27:24.566, Speaker B: It's the input for everything in society. Arthur Hayes wrote a whole blog post about how you should denominate your life in oil. But that doesn't mean you could go to the store and use and pay for something in oil. But in a sense, oil is a much more real form of money than paper dollars that the government prints. So I don't that I would object to maybe explicitly being like, it's a money and this is how we're going to think exactly one to one on ETH. But it is a store of value money commodity like thing. And I agree that's super valuable.
00:27:24.758 - 00:27:30.478, Speaker C: Vance and I denominate our net worth in ETH. So that's how we yeah.
00:27:30.564 - 00:27:33.680, Speaker A: Mike and I do it in Right. Exactly.
00:27:35.170 - 00:28:07.154, Speaker B: Looking at crude go up, baby. Vance, you said one other thing that I think is really interesting, which is the role that Eigen layer is going to have to play in that which there's like a money like role, but then there's also a yield role, which Eigen layer is going to have to play. So I think Sriram has come under a little bit of fire from the ETH Foundation. Who restaking is kind of a scary idea. It's sort of rehypothecating ETH. Sriram would object to this, but like my personal opinion, it looks a lot like adding leverage to the system. You're adding multiple claims on the same asset.
00:28:07.154 - 00:29:04.700, Speaker B: But I think a narrative shift is actually coming for Eigen layer, where people view it as something that's very pro solo stakers and that will enable solo stakers to keep their yield. I actually there's a piece that Dankrad wrote recently where he talks about Eigen layer like this, which is seeing if restaking like the long term solution ethereum is dealing with a problem right now that they actually have too many validators and it's difficult to attest and confirm transactions in a timely way. So there's like a whole bunch of different solutions being proposed. But one of the things that people are starting to be nervous about is exactly what you said, Vance, which is after a certain percentage of the ETH supply is staked, then yields will go down to a point where it's just not very competitive. And restaking could be an answer there that could supplement the yield that people are losing on a higher stake rate, and that can get framed as a positive solo staker thing.
00:29:05.630 - 00:29:10.220, Speaker A: Why is Eigen layer bad for solo stakers? Solo stakers can participate in Eigen layer, right?
00:29:10.830 - 00:30:10.106, Speaker B: It's not bad for solo stakers. It's a threat to the whole network in a sense, if you kind of think about a worst case scenario. And there are multiple operational models for Eigen layer. So the most intensive model for Eigen layer as a solo staker is you could opt into running additional hardware yourself, so you could turn over your withdrawal keys to the Eigen layer network, and then you could actually run in like a future state, a decentralized sequencer on optimism, if they ever go that route. The other thing that you can do that's going to be probably the dominant way that people actually use Eigen layer is you liquid stake and then you delegate your liquid stake to someone else who is running hardware on your behalf. So Eigen layer isn't really pro or anti solo staker. In a sense, it will enable solo stakers to earn more yield, but it depends on the model that you use Eigen layer.
00:30:10.106 - 00:30:22.626, Speaker B: If you liquid stake and then just delegate your liquid stake into the Eigen layer network and someone runs hardware on your behalf, you're just accepting a higher amount of principal agent risk because you're.
00:30:22.648 - 00:30:25.742, Speaker A: At risk of slashing for the restaker.
00:30:25.806 - 00:30:58.702, Speaker B: So you have to basically, like, think about your counterparty. So if you liquid stake with Lido, your counterparty is the staking pool. It's Lido. And then once you get the liquid staking token, and then you delegate that into the Eigen layer network and they pair it up with someone who's running like a sequencer or an oracle or something like that, then you're trusting the Eigen layer network and whoever's actually running that hardware on your behalf. You're just adding layers of principal agent problem. It's just someone who's supposed to be acting on your behalf but could screw you.
00:30:58.836 - 00:31:29.618, Speaker D: Someone will get blown up by this at some point, trying to pick up that extra 2% yield and they get slashed or something catastrophic happens. So two things on that. Number one, there's a meaningful lower bound to ETH yields. We've modeled out what consensus layer, what execution layer rewards look like when there's 50 60 million staked ETH. It's still high. Twos, and interest rates are high right now, but those get cut. And it's also fundamental.
00:31:29.618 - 00:31:59.486, Speaker D: It's fundamentally different. It's an asset that has a chance of appreciation versus something that's supposed to be stable. You're self selecting for different things. I'm also not that bearish on yields. I think they'll be higher even in the event that there's something like 60 or 70 million staked ETH, which honestly, I do think that is probably the medium term base case the next three years in terms of supplementing your staking yields with things like Eigen layer. I think it's true. I think there's going to be so many different flavors of Eigen layer.
00:31:59.486 - 00:32:39.790, Speaker D: Eigen layer is just the first. It's not the last, not by a long shot. The yield is dependent on what is the market cap of the Oracle or the DA layer or the bridge that you're securing, how much ETH is staked against it. But if you've got 60 or 70 million ETH staked Eigen layer, DA or whatever that inflation token that you're earning is, that needs to be a huge market cap. And that's a function of like, can Sriram attract the devs to build the things and not just the primitives? Like he needs to build the use cases too. And so it's a little bit more than just build it and they will come. They each have to bootstrap a very real ecosystem.
00:32:39.790 - 00:33:28.846, Speaker D: The other cool stuff that's going to happen in my mind is things like leverage staking, more of a marketplace for staking people doing it for lower fees. I do think there's going to be fee compression on the validator side. So I think incremental yields are going to come from a lot of different places, but it's going to be more of like this multiplayer multipath game where it's like you're staking your ETH on this oracle today or restaking it now you're doing it in a bridge the next and you're using Steeth or I guess, another liquid staking token to do it. But long term, it becomes more and more important if that amount of ETH staked for something like Lido to have dual governance, because you need to have some sort of coordination mechanism with the unstaked ETH. And honestly, the EF as well.
00:33:28.948 - 00:33:32.590, Speaker B: They've got the staking router too, so they're decentralizing their validator set.
00:33:32.660 - 00:34:07.866, Speaker D: Yeah, the goal for Lido is not to just operate 28 node operators forever. They're adding new node operators every week and DVT, and the staking router is the path towards thousands. I do think just like another brief point on this is in a lower price environment, it becomes harder for smaller validators to compete. They have less to pay their validators, they have less to pay themselves. And you think of the thing that the EF just put in, which is that churn limit. I know what they're trying to do, but what that actually does is it.
00:34:07.888 - 00:34:10.954, Speaker B: Just makes it vance can you explain that?
00:34:10.992 - 00:34:43.058, Speaker D: The churn limit, they're basically slowing down the amount of validators that are allowed to enter the queue on a daily basis. And it should be, I think, the limit. I think we calculated it's like 50 or 60,000 ETH would be the max that you could stake. But what that does is it eliminates any chance for the smaller guys to catch up. It's good and bad. It's mostly bad. I think the long term prognosis is that the smaller guys probably shut down or operate on something that can drive their costs lowers like a DVT layer or the Lido staking router.
00:34:43.058 - 00:34:52.010, Speaker D: But I don't think the days of having 100 liquid staking providers are going to last very long, especially when most of them are sub fifty k e staked.
00:34:54.350 - 00:35:00.266, Speaker B: I don't think liquid staking is a market structure which is naturally fragmented. It's a winner take all, or win.
00:35:00.288 - 00:35:09.918, Speaker D: Or take most all money assets have this stable coins, major cryptos. They exist in two conditions. One is zero, or the other is huge.
00:35:10.084 - 00:35:24.386, Speaker B: Regular currencies operate like this too. There's like six currencies that have any amount of liquidity. It's like the dollar and then, I don't know, probably be the euro or the yen or something like that. But it's a really long and the.
00:35:24.408 - 00:35:37.830, Speaker D: People who are in trouble are like the UK, where it's like you're kind of a big nation, but not really. We don't have enough economic momentum to support you. A lot of these LSTs are going to be in Britain mode. In my mind, someone made the point.
00:35:37.900 - 00:36:42.586, Speaker B: On one of the liquid stake. It was the solana, it was the Jito and Zave from chorus one episodes. Someone made the point where, ironically, ETH staking ecosystem being so broken in the beginning led to the product market fit for liquid staking because there was such a long withdrawal period in between when the beacon chain was launched and you could stake versus when you could withdraw. There was no in protocol delegation mechanism for stake and there was a big DeFi ecosystem, so there was a lot of opportunity costs for staking. Actually, liquid staking originated in the cosmos but found product market fit first in ethereum. And there is this sort of irony to even like ETH being very opinionated about not wanting to take big decisions inside the protocol and limiting the throughput and usefulness of the main layer actually has led to this whole rise of really successful infrastructure providers around that who want to make it easier to use ethereum. So like Lido would be an example of that.
00:36:42.586 - 00:37:17.842, Speaker B: Eigen layer would be an example of that axiom the coprocessor would be an example of that. It's sort of interesting. And some of these other protocols like Salana, which was like, hey, we can actually just allow you to easily delegate stake within the protocol. The penetration of liquid staking in Salana is like nothing. The stake rate is like 75% and the liquid staking penetration is like 3%. You know what I mean? I don't really know what to make of that observation. But now Ethereum is like, hey, some of these infrastructure providers that have risen up and found product market fit, we have no way to regulate or control them whatsoever.
00:37:17.842 - 00:37:30.298, Speaker B: So now you're getting this whole narrative about is Lido too powerful? Are they co opting the network? And it's like I actually hear them, but also this was the design choice that you made. What do you guys think about the.
00:37:30.384 - 00:37:36.074, Speaker C: If you totally withdrawn from the beacon chain, I don't think LSDs would really exist, period.
00:37:36.122 - 00:38:13.130, Speaker D: I think they would still exist. In this blog post, the guy is like claiming that we could not have foreseen this. It's like this concept existed on Cosmos before you transition to proof of stake and the blockchain is built for tokenization. How is this going to take a different path? Of course people are going to do this. So I don't know, sometimes it feels like people just like to bash on Lido because it's successful. And that's not really like the entire truth. Contributing to Lido is contributing to Ethereum, in my mind at least.
00:38:13.130 - 00:38:18.122, Speaker D: Their values align dual governance. I don't know how much more we need if they decentralize the validator set.
00:38:18.176 - 00:38:55.330, Speaker B: I think also you could make the argument, john Charba's made this argument, and I agree with it, that Lido actually decentralized the stake in Ethereum pretty effectively. Like Lido just baked in these requirements about, hey, not all of the node operators, you can't just use AWS as your sole data warehouse. Or they also were like, hey, not all the stake can be in the US. They made it geographically distributed. They kind of had this forcing function of all the stake flowed into Lido and then Lido set these rules and pushed it out. Whereas if you had just allowed it to naturally accumulate, you saw this with like all the mining just went to a relatively small region in China.
00:38:55.410 - 00:39:05.786, Speaker A: So all the stake would have gone to centralized exchanges to Kraken. Would you rather have it on Lido or would you rather have it on centralized exchanges? That's where it would have gone.
00:39:05.808 - 00:39:40.550, Speaker D: Imagine them trying to fix that problem now. That would be such a disaster. You do have 180,000 people that own Steeth that have staked ETH to Steeth. This is a big community. I don't get why the disconnect persists, but it's not going to stop it from growing. I think the interesting long term part, I forget who wrote the Churn Limit article, but he's like, we're going to be at 75 million staked ETH by next year. That's way over optimistic.
00:39:40.550 - 00:40:08.062, Speaker D: Maybe we're at, like, 40 if it really picks up. But I think the interesting assumption that he had was that steth would be at one point bigger than the amount of unstaked ETH. And I can see why that would be a problem. But I still think the real risks are this restaking stuff. Having Steeth is one thing. Having it baked into all these different slashing mechanisms, totally different.
00:40:08.196 - 00:40:59.770, Speaker B: There is more demand for yield bearing money than non yield bearing. A Jack Farley did an episode with this guy, Sir Paul Tucker, who used to be a know central banker for the bank of you know, we've talked about the debt on this show before, and from my perspective as an American, like a young American, I'm like, this is nuts. Why are we just accumulating more and more and more debt? But from the central banker's perspective, they're like, people want our interest bearing money. There is a market demand for non interest bearing money and a market demand for interest bearing money. And the market demand for money that bears interest, which is treasuries, that have a yield attached to it, is just higher. So if you kind of get into another frame of thinking about it, you're just serving the market. What there's demand for and why wouldn't you do that? It's cheap financing.
00:40:59.770 - 00:41:18.418, Speaker B: So I kind of do see the argument that if you totally derisked Steve, like, let's just say in a totally hypothetical way, there was no risk of staking your ETH with Lido. Why would you have ETH that doesn't bear any yield versus ETH that does bear yield? You'd want the one that bears yield.
00:41:18.594 - 00:41:22.920, Speaker D: I mean, there's a balance, right? Why don't you just increase the inflation rate to 50%?
00:41:23.930 - 00:41:24.438, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:24.524 - 00:42:03.682, Speaker D: That's what you're seeing with bonds today. Yeah, the yield is going up, but everyone's losing their shirt on the bonds that they already own, and it works until it doesn't. I think the goal of being like, net zero or deflationary is aspirational. But really what you're trying to bootstrap is the fee side is a very meaningful part of the valuation of Ethan. I think you can get there based on fees that it does today in terms of what it's worth today. But the far bigger market, the far bigger premium, the far bigger multiple is money side and making sure it doesn't lose whatever it is and it doesn't matter what exactly it is. I don't think it's like definable in one sentence or one word.
00:42:03.682 - 00:42:48.818, Speaker D: But having everybody start with ETH is the gas token, and having it be something that people want to have and restake and buy for the yield, that is definitely a positive step, but it just can't be 50% a year. But there is an argument that maybe it should be like an Eric Connor from the EF or former EF was making this argument, he's like, maybe it should be at one or 2% higher or 3% higher. I think that's a conversation that everyone will have at some point and we're more likely to have it probably in the next year than in the next two years. I think yields will go back up and people will be like, we need to kind of keep our foot on the gas in terms of the deflationary side of it. But in bear markets, this is kind of always what happens.
00:42:48.984 - 00:43:56.902, Speaker B: You guys want to talk about some you want to talk about Maker? Actually, Maker is having a little bit of a run right now. So we talked about it on I can't remember a couple of weeks ago, maybe where we went through this chart here. I'll actually pull it back up because I thought it was a pretty interesting chart. It was just Maker fees versus TVL versus token price or market cap maybe, which is somewhere these two there are these two charts which are extremely correlated, which is the market cap of Maker and the TVL, which are both going down. But then if you look starting back in October of last year, it just started to rip upwards and now last time we talked, the token price hadn't really started to move, but now it is kind of starting to move again. So obviously not financial advice here and I'm more just wondering if this we talked about a resurgence in sort of DFI 1.0 and you could put synthetics in this bucket or, I don't know, uniswap or whoever you want.
00:43:56.902 - 00:44:23.940, Speaker B: But I went back. You and I interviewed Kane like, a year ago, and he was really talking about TVL being a busted metric or not a one size fits all metric, rather. And fees were going to be the important thing. That's the single source of truth for actual real demand. So fees net of token issuance. So, yeah, I'm just curious what you guys think because they've also got their end game going on.
00:44:24.470 - 00:44:50.806, Speaker C: We're definitely agreeing with basically everything that you just said. I think Kane nailed it. He's probably a little bit early for everybody else to realize it, but so are a lot of his perspectives. I think what we're going to see with DFI in the future of DFI, whether it's 1.01.52 .0 protocols that come back is the ones that come back are going to be based around fundamentals where value is accruing. And Maker has shown that.
00:44:50.806 - 00:45:35.430, Speaker C: I think we were looking at this recently, I think makers so Dai is effectively the way that you measure this, right? And the Dai supply, I think, bottomed out near maybe a year ago or maybe eleven or ten months ago at 1 billion. And it's up quite a bit since then. I would imagine with endgame you're going to see a lot more activity. I know that there's been a couple of announcements this week on different Subdows that are launching, specifically going after RWAs. I think you're going to see the model of Maker, the central bank with Subdows being the commercial banks and doing different things, taking on different risks, but being out there pushing the ball forward. So yeah, totally agree.
00:45:35.500 - 00:46:14.770, Speaker A: I think what you're seeing here is for the last five or six years, there's always been a metric that people are trying to that the market trades around, right? And there's always been games that people try to kind of play in crypto. So even if you go back to 2017, DFI aside, right, the BitMEX leaderboard, that was the game everyone was trying to play. Then it became uniswap and TVL and the market kind of traded off this TVL narrative and then there was like the game of NFTs and how high could you mint for? And stuff like that. And now I think the market is moving towards fees as the game that people are playing and that is the best game that we will have played yet because fees actually drive sustainability.
00:46:15.990 - 00:46:19.618, Speaker C: Well, it can drive sustainability doesn't necessarily.
00:46:19.714 - 00:46:21.942, Speaker B: And better than any of the other.
00:46:21.996 - 00:46:25.666, Speaker A: Games that driving sustainability, I guess, step in the right direction.
00:46:25.858 - 00:46:33.894, Speaker C: The only problem that I have with it is everybody's got a different definition of what actually is derived from that metric.
00:46:33.942 - 00:46:51.230, Speaker A: When the market does something like this, maker is starting to it feels like running a little bit. I had breakfast with a few crypto funds and kind of big crypto traders. It sounded like Maker is like the most crowded trade in the room. At least like around the table. That was what people are saying.
00:46:51.300 - 00:46:51.726, Speaker C: Really?
00:46:51.828 - 00:47:12.758, Speaker A: Yeah. People are like, maker is starting to be the consensus crowded trade. When you see something like this from a trading perspective, does it make you think like, oh, okay, one thing is running, maybe the rest of the market starts running. You're like, oh, this is I don't know, how do you think about that? When there's like clearly one trade we.
00:47:12.764 - 00:48:00.774, Speaker D: Don'T think about it making billions of dollars out of an investment. You don't do that by looking for the see if the five minute RSI is oversold. They're not always traded or crowded. The crowd kind of runs out the door at some point for some reason. And I think the other thing is that this is one of the only kind of protocols that benefits from higher for longer. And if you really believe that, which I think a lot of people are now kind of being cowed into, this is one way to express that without leaving crypto or without buying T bills, which if you're a crypto, you're buying T bills, I don't know what you're doing.
00:48:00.972 - 00:48:09.286, Speaker C: I will say though, if this was the most crowded trade in crypto, it would not be trading the way that it has been. It would be a wildly different experience.
00:48:09.468 - 00:48:10.230, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true.
00:48:10.300 - 00:49:03.766, Speaker D: There's crowd salana in 2021, all the billionaires. That is what a crowded trade looks like. I think about this thing of like, are you consensus, are you non consensus? It kind of matters what level of perception you're on. If you're in crypto, okay, sure, it might be consensus, but if you're not fully in crypto, then you're still wildly most people don't even know what maker is. Most of the major funds have also recently sold this on chain. Define consensus for me, because I think we're still in the same perspective where it's like there's probably not a lot of sellers anymore, but there's certainly not a lot of buyers, certainly not of size. And when something becomes crowded, you'll see usually some indication of it ripping.
00:49:03.766 - 00:49:07.046, Speaker D: I wouldn't call this ripping. This is like a little baby bump.
00:49:07.078 - 00:49:14.254, Speaker A: Little baby bump, yeah, that's true. What does that revenue say right there? Mike, what is the revenue number? 123.
00:49:14.452 - 00:49:16.546, Speaker B: Annualized. Annualized, 123.
00:49:16.548 - 00:49:26.814, Speaker D: A couple of disclosures. One, we own maker. Two, if you look at all of the metrics on Maker Burn, I think Maker Burn is honestly the better site.
00:49:26.932 - 00:49:32.210, Speaker A: I think it's got more revenue on Maker Burn, you're looking at like 170 or 180 in annual revenue.
00:49:32.950 - 00:49:47.480, Speaker D: But even that doesn't capture everything because and this is kind of one of the bear cases for maker is that it's definitely transparent and free wielding. It's definitely a little bit like the data isn't quite up to date.
00:49:48.910 - 00:49:55.900, Speaker C: The data isn't quite up to date. Or like the people who are running the Treasuries forgot to put the money into the account.
00:49:56.590 - 00:50:18.078, Speaker D: Yeah, because they're going off chain to on chain in terms of buying Treasuries. There's meat space in the middle. There's people who need to do things, I think for a while they hadn't gotten report from Coinbase on their PNL for like three or four months or know, take these seriously, but don't take.
00:50:18.084 - 00:50:27.650, Speaker B: Them are this is the Maker Burn. So it looks like the annualized average revenue is around I can't really see 160.
00:50:27.720 - 00:50:51.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember seeing 180 somewhere. And then the other thing was like 60 million in profit going back towards buybacks, right? And then you've got the diet supply is growing. It's probably above, what, 5 billion, maybe around 6 billion today. And then when you start to put the valuation on it, it's like, I don't know, you're getting like a PE of 20 and a revenue multiple of like ten or twelve.
00:50:52.052 - 00:51:07.502, Speaker C: Well, their largest cost item, the largest item on their expenses is DSR. And you would assume as soon as that endgame, phase two goes live, there's going to be a lot of value. That leaves DSR to go farm subdows.
00:51:07.566 - 00:51:30.934, Speaker D: The other thing is that people it feels like when this starts to happen, like this crowded trade idea, it's like people don't actually read all of the public information about what's going on. I ask people, do you know what the DSR is. What is that? It's like, well, it's the main source of expenses for Maker. Do you understand how it works? It's like no, the other thing is, and Runa said this publicly.
00:51:30.982 - 00:51:32.060, Speaker B: Can you explain it?
00:51:34.030 - 00:52:05.894, Speaker D: Sorry, I'm just going to talk about the end game. Endgame is basically the process of the commercial bank, the central bank model maker ossifies. Its job turns from collateral, onboarding ecosystem contributions, onboarding collaborators. They're just going to be giving Dai to these commercial banks. Spark to the RWA dows there's two of them. And then to Sakura, which is kind of like this gamified yield aggregator thing, targeted Asia, but that launches in Q two. It feels like people are really trying to front run that.
00:52:05.894 - 00:52:13.410, Speaker D: And it's great that people are reenergized, but it is going to take a little like it's September.
00:52:13.570 - 00:52:34.320, Speaker B: Can you explain why Rune thinks that's such a problem? Because I get that it's not unified. People think about them as two different things, but aren't they kind of two different things? They are two sort of different things and both of them are good. I think both Di and Maker have very close but super premium brands in crypto. What am I missing there? Why does it need to be one?
00:52:35.090 - 00:52:50.420, Speaker D: The public information out there is I think he wants it to be like the brand is X and then the stablecoin is X USD not like actually X. It's just a placeholder. I think he feels strongly about that. Run does.
00:52:50.950 - 00:53:00.294, Speaker A: So bringing them together. So Dai and Maker don't seem like they're under the same umbrella right now, but in the future it could be like Maker and then MKRUSD or something like that.
00:53:00.332 - 00:53:10.934, Speaker C: Yeah, he's talked about this where he says, I have people come up to me all the time and they're like, oh, well, what does Maker do? We create dai. Oh, I love dai. I use it all the time. What's maker realize that?
00:53:10.972 - 00:53:11.126, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:11.148 - 00:53:11.250, Speaker C: No.
00:53:11.260 - 00:53:12.394, Speaker D: What does blockworks do?
00:53:12.512 - 00:53:13.980, Speaker A: What does blockwork do?
00:53:14.830 - 00:53:19.178, Speaker B: We were talking about this yesterday. Yeah, I empathize with it.
00:53:19.344 - 00:53:25.886, Speaker A: Love a good conference for people to let me know that they listen to our pods but don't know Blockworks does.
00:53:26.068 - 00:54:03.866, Speaker D: But the other thing is the redenomination, which is probably the bigger impact. Is it one to 12,000 Michael or one to 1200? So new Maker will be a dollar or like a little over a dollar in that formula. That is a really different community. There's kind of no denying it. And if you slap a new name on it, it's like the meme of the guy with the tape. I don't think there's a hole in Maker. I do think Rune does feel strongly about the branding, though.
00:54:03.866 - 00:54:06.538, Speaker D: What it's going to be called? Anybody's guess.
00:54:06.624 - 00:54:28.274, Speaker A: Are they doing a migration to the new governance token at the one to 1200 ratio? That's just like a stock split because people don't want to buy $1,300 token. But they'll buy a dollar token. Right. The thing is, people don't want to buy $1,000 share of Apple, but they'll ape into $150.
00:54:28.392 - 00:54:31.470, Speaker C: No, but it's important to upgrade the software.
00:54:31.630 - 00:54:33.060, Speaker A: Yeah, important.
00:54:34.470 - 00:54:36.802, Speaker D: Get that payback. Slap it on there.
00:54:36.856 - 00:54:37.714, Speaker A: Slap it on.
00:54:37.832 - 00:54:48.314, Speaker D: It does make a difference, though. People do say Ethereum is $1,600. Can I buy half of one? Or I can't afford a whole one. It's like, oh, God.
00:54:48.512 - 00:54:51.290, Speaker A: That's why you buy Litecoin. It's cheaper. Bitcoin.
00:54:52.990 - 00:54:54.140, Speaker D: The poor man.
00:54:54.670 - 00:55:01.066, Speaker B: That is, though, such a real thing. So many people think that dude does.
00:55:01.088 - 00:55:09.054, Speaker D: This all the time. I forget how many Netflix did this, too, when I worked. Like, I can't even figure out what the price was when I started, because the stock's been split, like, so many times.
00:55:09.172 - 00:55:26.920, Speaker B: Yeah. One time, it was probably around 2020 or something. Polka dot was exactly $10, and it was the fourth biggest crypto by market cap. And I bought some purely on the thesis that people would look at Bitcoin, think it was too expensive, e think it was too expensive, and be like, here's, this one for $10.
00:55:28.090 - 00:55:29.720, Speaker A: That's not a horrible yeah.
00:55:32.410 - 00:55:54.750, Speaker C: There'S a lot of psychology into how you price IPOs, and the goal is to hit it, whatever the valuation is, to hit it around $20 a share. Because the psychology is, do you want to buy a share of that company, or do you want to go out to lunch and buy lunch? If it's something as simple as that. That's why all SPACs initially are priced at $10, to be a little bit less expensive.
00:55:55.170 - 00:56:10.474, Speaker B: Speaking of IPOs, do you remember when Bill Gurley and maybe that'll be a segue into our last discussion point, but remember when Bill Gurley went on this rant about direct listings over IPOs? Yeah, probably.
00:56:10.612 - 00:56:12.740, Speaker C: He's not wrong. Yeah.
00:56:13.110 - 00:56:39.830, Speaker B: It is a weird process, but Matt Levine will write about this. There's, like, a nice aesthetic to when the IPO goes live and then the stock pops. I mean, it is kind of stupid. That's a really expensive marketing strategy that you're running there, but it does I don't know. I don't think it's totally valueless. You don't want to pull an instacart right. And go public and have the stock fall out of the sky.
00:56:39.830 - 00:56:40.970, Speaker B: That would suck.
00:56:41.650 - 00:56:44.202, Speaker C: Well, does that suck?
00:56:44.266 - 00:56:45.934, Speaker D: They're still above their IPO price.
00:56:46.052 - 00:56:49.502, Speaker A: Instacart didn't fall out of the sky, though. That wasn't a horrendously bad.
00:56:49.636 - 00:56:50.174, Speaker B: Which one?
00:56:50.212 - 00:57:03.710, Speaker C: Just did this recently? Two days ago. So keep in mind, Mike, you want to price it. The company wants to price it at as high a level as possible because that's how much money they raise.
00:57:03.790 - 00:57:04.420, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:57:04.790 - 00:57:11.334, Speaker C: And the employees and the founders can't touch a single share until six months in, so it doesn't matter what happens.
00:57:11.372 - 00:57:11.526, Speaker D: Sure.
00:57:11.548 - 00:57:25.050, Speaker A: That's right, Michael. I think you try to underprice it a little to allow for a little bit of a pop, because as a company, as a founder and employees, you. Can't sell it for 90 days. So you want to get that momentum going.
00:57:25.120 - 00:57:49.230, Speaker C: Totally. The three variables here are existing shareholders, the company itself, and then purchasers of the IPO. The purchasers of the IPO want a pop because they want to be able to flip it. And that's the whole Bill Gurley point. The company wants to maximize money raised because it's a balance sheet question. And then employees have six months lockup. Employees, founders have six months lockup.
00:57:49.230 - 00:58:01.138, Speaker C: And yeah, sure, you want a little bit of a pop because it helps build the brand and oh, what's this company doing? It just popped 20% on its IPO day, et cetera. But you don't want to pop 100% because then you left money on the table.
00:58:01.154 - 00:58:08.554, Speaker B: You left a lot of money on it. Yeah, I hear you. That's why it is sort of a marketing it's kind of a marketing do.
00:58:08.592 - 00:58:12.010, Speaker A: You guys take a guess at Instacart's advertising revenue?
00:58:12.350 - 00:58:13.900, Speaker C: 500 million a year.
00:58:16.030 - 00:58:17.210, Speaker D: Michael cheated.
00:58:21.070 - 00:58:33.300, Speaker A: That's uber's ad revenue. Actually it's 500. Instacart, I think is like 250 or 450. Some large number. Basically, you know it, you know the number?
00:58:33.990 - 00:58:36.500, Speaker C: Not exactly, but it's around 500.
00:58:38.150 - 00:59:13.974, Speaker A: Uber is going to be at a billion dollars in ad revenue next year. Amazon is $40 billion in ad revenue. Gets you thinking about super high value. Like, who uses Instacart, uber, Tide, net worth individuals. Oftentimes it's like people who if you're in New York, maybe you'll take a $30 Uber instead of the subway. If you use Instacart like, you want it to get your groceries delivered. Makes you think about the ad business of Coinbase, right? I think Coinbase is like sitting here sleeping on a sitting on like a 500 million dollar a year ad business.
00:59:13.974 - 00:59:22.414, Speaker A: It's a bunch of high net worth, high intent, demand side, large amounts of data on users. I don't know.
00:59:22.612 - 00:59:23.930, Speaker C: I actually disagree.
00:59:24.090 - 00:59:26.660, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't really love that either, to be honest.
00:59:27.110 - 00:59:35.380, Speaker C: I disagree. I think it would be very difficult for them to build base and also suggest things to use base for.
00:59:37.530 - 00:59:41.720, Speaker A: I would bet money they launch an ad network by the end of 2024.
00:59:45.050 - 00:59:50.680, Speaker B: But is it the highest ROI thing that they could do? I don't really think it is.
00:59:51.610 - 00:59:55.706, Speaker D: Yeah, there's lower hanging fruit. If they turn that futures exchange on.
00:59:55.728 - 01:00:05.040, Speaker A: It'S going to be just somebody's going to own a colossal ad network in crypto, and nobody owns that right now.
01:00:05.570 - 01:00:29.942, Speaker C: So 100% agree with that. 100% agree. Like advertising in the entire ad stack itself, what you previously had was you had closed systems. So Google was an open ad system. Snap, Facebook, closed systems. Someone will build that stack based off of the decentralized ecosystems because all the data is available. It's how you marry that.
01:00:29.942 - 01:00:39.340, Speaker C: With proprietary targeting, that will become very interesting. But it could be Coinbase or Coinbase could be the data provider and just get paid a services.
01:00:39.950 - 01:00:50.666, Speaker B: Just yeah, I feel like there's just more high ROI things that Coinbase could dedicate their time. Like I don't just have you ever.
01:00:50.688 - 01:00:52.480, Speaker A: Looked at Coinbase's product page?
01:00:53.810 - 01:00:58.110, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot but they are getting more concentrated.
01:00:58.930 - 01:01:01.582, Speaker A: They don't think that way. This is Coinbase's product page.
01:01:01.636 - 01:01:18.694, Speaker B: Look at all freaking no, they do think that way. They think that way. I think they went too far in this last market. But if you listen to their investor calls, they have like a 70 2010 allocation framework, which is I forget it's not exactly that. It's some famous I think Google came up with.
01:01:18.732 - 01:01:19.942, Speaker C: It's been classic doodle thing.
01:01:19.996 - 01:01:25.350, Speaker B: Right? It's like 70 core business, 20 sort of fringe and 10% moonshots.
01:01:28.890 - 01:01:30.680, Speaker D: A lot on that page.
01:01:31.210 - 01:01:33.480, Speaker A: The page is ridiculous. Yeah.
01:01:34.010 - 01:01:52.240, Speaker D: They focusing their time and effort on doing a stock split, which would give them many things. Among them a new chart. I think getting back to that idea. A new chart, it's like a new it's anything is possible.
01:01:52.690 - 01:01:59.406, Speaker C: It's not a new just Apple and Google and all the other charts just go back and reset everything.
01:01:59.508 - 01:02:01.630, Speaker D: Sorry. They also need to rebrand.
01:02:03.970 - 01:02:05.746, Speaker A: They should rebrand maker.
01:02:05.858 - 01:02:12.086, Speaker C: Maker becomes we're going to issue a second stock and that stock is going to be called base.
01:02:12.188 - 01:02:17.300, Speaker D: AMC tried that. Pros are doing it. That's it.
