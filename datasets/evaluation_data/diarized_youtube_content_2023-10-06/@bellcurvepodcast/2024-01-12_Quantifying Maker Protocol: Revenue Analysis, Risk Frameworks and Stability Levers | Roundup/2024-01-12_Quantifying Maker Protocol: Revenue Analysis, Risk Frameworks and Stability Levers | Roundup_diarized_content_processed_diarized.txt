00:00:00.330 - 00:00:11.118, Speaker A: Already, I think back in early September, I was trying to tell people that, hey, look at this. This is going to create a lot of revenue and profits. And people are like, yeah, I don't know. Not really interested.
00:00:11.284 - 00:00:12.670, Speaker B: Do they have a hat?
00:00:13.250 - 00:00:17.130, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe that's what's missing.
00:00:17.210 - 00:00:39.498, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal view views, and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal.
00:00:39.584 - 00:00:41.530, Speaker C: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:43.470 - 00:00:53.040, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of on the margin. Today I'm joined by two of Blockworks star analyst class. We got westy and brick on the pod. Fellas, welcome.
00:00:54.130 - 00:00:54.494, Speaker A: Hi.
00:00:54.532 - 00:00:55.760, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:00:57.010 - 00:01:32.922, Speaker B: So we're going to spend most of this podcast actually talking about Maker. We've got a new dashboard coming out and I feel like people have been pretty inundated with bitcoin ETF content for the majority of the week. But just before we jump in, we're recording this on Thursday morning. So we're a couple of hours into trading. I think we've got over 2 billion clocked in volume for the combined spot etFs, which is an impressive start. I'm looking at the latest tweet from Eric Balkunis, who is essentially the guru on this topic, along with James Safert. And safe to say we're going to be breaking some records today.
00:01:32.922 - 00:01:54.106, Speaker B: So let me hold your guys feet to the fire and get a little prediction for the listeners here. Where do you guys think we end trading today? Any predictions around that or is this going to end up being a sell the news event or you guys have any sort of thoughts early on on the ETF? Based on today's info, I just checked.
00:01:54.138 - 00:02:10.040, Speaker A: The price and apparently people are already selling. So I don't know what's going to happen there, but I don't know long term. My opinion is that it doesn't matter what happens today. Just buy the coins and hold them. That's the strategy to win at this game.
00:02:11.370 - 00:02:36.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm expecting a pretty volatile date overall, but yeah, no numbers on specific inflows because that's really out of my range in particular to try and guess that. But yeah, a lot of volatility. And like Brick said, this is obviously a huge catalyst overall and whether it's a sell the news, buy the news doesn't matter. I think six months from now, we'll see a lot better prices.
00:02:37.410 - 00:03:25.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm in that boat, too. Fools Aaron to guess. All right, guys, let's start talking about Maker. And I know Wesy, you're going to share your screen and walk us through some of this dashboard that we created at blockworks research. But for folks who might not be following, and just to give you guys credit, I feel like I would have no idea what the maker endgame is if it wasn't for you guys. It's definitely been difficult to follow, but it's been a big year for Maker, and I think there's a lot of reasons to be bullish on the protocol. I think we're going to walk through some of those facts, but for folks that haven't been following maker as closely, can you guys just give us sort of an overview of the current state of the protocol as well as some of the proposed changes, like the redenomination of Maker and maybe just summarize the end game for.
00:03:27.090 - 00:05:18.900, Speaker A: Sure? So, yeah, last year definitely was pretty eventful for Maker. What basically happened was Ruinex. So the founder of the protocol introduced this five faced plan called endgame to change the protocol in pretty significant ways. And the main point of the whole plan is to kind of diversify or decentralized governance structure. So one of the main points is the introduction of subdos and then kind of moving the protocol forward to what is being called the end state, where it can kind of take care of itself, I guess, would be the best explanation. And being totally decentralized when you look at governance, and there was a lot of friction within the large players in governance when this endgame proposal came out, because there were basically two camps, those who were in favor of this end game plan, and then another camp that basically wanted to implement more of a corporate structure where you'd have kind of a board and not a CEO, but you get what I was saying. And when the end game plan was pushed through, a lot of core contributors and governance people left, which kind of left the protocol scrambling, which is probably one of the reasons why Endgame still hasn't started.
00:05:18.900 - 00:06:44.094, Speaker A: And to explain what it is, it's a five phased plan, and I'll go through the main points for each plan or each phase. So the first phase is basically like a rebranding of maker, which is trying to unify the whole brand, and the new native governance token, as well as, say, stablecoin will be introduced. The old tokens will still be functional, but the idea is that you can kind of switch between these two or the old versions and the new versions. And one thing that has recently caught a lot of people's eyes is the fact that maker or the MKR token will be redominated one token to 24,000 tokens of the new governance token if the proposed change goes through, which should happen at the end of January, if it happens, by the way. So then people are talking about, oh, that token price is going to go down, even though nothing happens to the market cap or fdv. But there's just like units bias there in play. But yeah, that's basically phase one.
00:06:44.094 - 00:08:17.254, Speaker A: Then for phase two, we will see like the proper introduction of subdos, which are basically kind of dows that work on some specific tasks, while maker core dow takes care of kind of like internal governance things. And while these subdos focus more on a product or some specific, like trying to facilitate governance in a better way. And phase two will also introduce subdou token mining or like farming. So each subdow will have their own native token, and through that, maker is trying to create these sub communities, basically, who are more specialized in certain things that the subdao will be doing. And a good example of a subdao that's already live is Sparkdow, which is basically the DaO for Spark protocol, which is a money market on Ethereum and nosis chain. And yeah, Sparkdow will be responsible for basically developing products that are complementary to spark protocol, as well as then, of course, taking care of Spark protocol. Then phase three is a bit of a, I don't know, an interesting one, which is supposed to introduce AI into the protocol.
00:08:17.254 - 00:08:41.746, Speaker A: So, like help or. Because governance is at the moment pretty not convoluted, but it's super hard to follow what's happening in the forums because there's so many proposals going on and protocol is so large. So maker is trying to introduce AI tools to help with the process.
00:08:41.928 - 00:09:03.114, Speaker C: There's also the maker chain as well, creating your own chain, which obviously caused a lot of backlash when they talked about using Solana potentially as maker chain. And that'll be sort of like the central governance hub of maker going forward. I'm not sure if that's phase four or phase five, but that'll be included as well.
00:09:03.232 - 00:10:29.480, Speaker A: That would be phase five, when basically the protocol is moving into its end game state. And the idea of the new chain would be to have some of the back end stuff live on the chain. So the idea is that if something super bad happens to the protocol, you could fork the chain and to keep the protocol alive, because at the moment, if something kind of terrible happens, to put it shortly, like the protocol will kind of shut down or there will be an emergency shutdown, which in short, gives out all of the collateral within the protocol, and then the protocol kind of is just destroyed after that. And, yeah, for phase four, it was like governance, participation, incentives. So there are several different ways in which maker is trying to then get people to participate more in this subdoub governance. And that's going to be happening through different token farming incentives. And that's basically the end game.
00:10:29.850 - 00:11:06.302, Speaker B: That was phase four, by the way. It's just governance incentives incentivizing people to participate in governance. And then phase five was new chain. And for folks who might have been following, that's when Rune stirred the pot a little bit by proposing an SVM fork as kind of the basis for new chain. So let me ask you guys this. Before we get into some of the details of maker and how it's performing today, and I want to talk to you guys about the RWA narrative as well. One of the things, if you listen to roon talk about this, it feels like there's a driving underlying philosophy that's informing this.
00:11:06.302 - 00:12:42.238, Speaker B: And I would. Or Rune is one of the ogs in crypto. And a lot of the people that got in, especially pre 2013 time frame, had sort of a strong ideological take on the space. And to summarize, the way he talks about human organization is that it should be very, I guess, robust in the sense that people are basically going to do the most self interested, kind of net negative thing, and we should be designing our organizations to withstand humanity, basically. Whereas if you look at a guy like, there is a famous sort of organizational theorist, Kos, and his theory of the firm, the whole point of a firm, is to actually reduce transaction costs through trust. Right? And I guess if I had to do a high level summary of what Rune's endgame is, is to basically go in the exact opposite direction, not have trust, really in between any of these disparate parts of the maker protocol, and actually segment and compartmentalize all of the different functions. One of the things that I've never really understood about the subdou model, and maybe you guys know more than I do, is how are you supposed to underwrite if each one of these subdows has its own token? How do you underwrite that? Because if I were to just look at blockworks and carve it up into different parts, like, you could kind of start to create a PNL for some of our maybe research.
00:12:42.238 - 00:13:08.220, Speaker B: You could do that for, or conferences, but then you have huge parts of our business with high headcounts that aren't revenue generating but are extremely crucial to the business. And how do you underwrite marketing function or a finance function? I'm just a little bit confused about how organization like parts of the protocol like that are going to have tokens associated with it. Do you guys have a sense?
00:13:09.390 - 00:14:28.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess this comes back to the question, is a token valuable if it doesn't accrue cash flow? In my opinion, it can be because, for example, it gives you access to something that you otherwise wouldn't have. And you could argue that, okay, some of these subdaos could have great wives or whatever. I guess that's kind of what another subdao called sakura dao is going for, which is more of like for newer crypto people to come in and learn about the space and do things like that. But I get what you're saying, because on the one hand, some of the subdaos are supposed to be revenue generating and function as businesses. Meanwhile, other ones are more governance focused and supposed to be, I guess, more friendly towards, I don't know, less business like and more of just like, welcome to the subdow. You can do whatever you want and find some friends or whatever. I don't know if that's a great way to put it, but I definitely get that it's a weird structure in that sense.
00:14:28.130 - 00:14:56.940, Speaker A: And there has been a lot of talk about how could this ever work? Because will you ever have enough professionalization between these subdos? Does it spread out too much? And will people care enough for some of the subdos versus some of the other subdos? And then if one subdao is doing really well, does that mean that everybody just flux into that one and then everything else gets forgotten about?
00:14:58.350 - 00:15:51.130, Speaker C: I also think this comes from, like you said, the philosophy of creating the end game, where he's trying to create almost like a more robust maker as a whole, but allowing each individual subdow to experiment and find their own voice or vision. And within that, each token is also going to have its own vision, where maybe it's revenue generating, maybe it's just a community token to represent your access to a certain community, maybe it's just governance. And with that, governance does have some value, being able to vote on the protocol. So it's going to allow for a lot of experimentation, and it's going to be cool to see different things play out like Brick said, if one subdao starts doing extremely well versus others, do we start to see consolidation? I think it's going to allow for experimentation, which is a good thing overall for the robustness of maker, but it's going to cause a lot of turmoil in the meantime.
00:15:53.090 - 00:16:46.240, Speaker B: One thing that I've sort of found myself thinking is, what if you took existing conglomerates and you superimposed this structure and you assumed different business lines, had another stock, a separate stock. Like if you looked at Amazon as a business and you had the legacy business that had the Amazon token, so their sort of shipping and online retail business, but then you also had AWS, and AWS had its own token pro con. I'm actually not 100% sure you could make. And people have made the argument that if AWS were to get carved out and go public as a separate company, it would be worth more than Amazon. So I don't know how this is all going to work. It is an interesting experiment. And, you know, the other thing that it remind me of is, do you guys see Oppenheimer? The.
00:16:46.240 - 00:17:43.246, Speaker B: I. I don't always, whenever I see a movie like that, I go just nerd out on Wikipedia and read about, like, I went pretty deep on the Manhattan project. And that challenge that they were alluding to of know the groves figure in the film who wanted all the scientists not to talk to one another. The Oppenheimer and his group of scientists at the time was opposed to that. But that's become doctrine as an organizational philosophy inside the US to segment out different groups, and they're just pros and cons to that. And I feel like, actually, rune is pretty deep on these different organizational schools of thought and has this funny mix of government design, like public policy, government sort of structure, and traditional company thinking, which is, I guess we'll have to see how that one plays out.
00:17:43.348 - 00:17:54.094, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty cool, though, because I guess only in crypto could you do something like this. And it's great to have some experimentation, so can't really complain about that with you, Brick.
00:17:54.222 - 00:18:11.174, Speaker B: All right, Westy, can I pick on you? Here to walk us through. So this is sort of where makers headed, but you can also learn a lot by digging into the data that exists today. So can you walk us through some of the highlights of the dashboard that we've just created in blockworks research?
00:18:11.292 - 00:19:00.554, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I'm just going to try and share my screen here. So I guess in terms of highlights, there are a few different highlights I definitely saw. And first would be this first chart here, which is annualized revenue. So, to be clear, the last, I'd say, month and a half of data is currently estimations when it comes to rwas, given that there's a lot of delay in the reporting of data, which can be over a month. And so if you hover over this data, looking at November of 2023, which was actual historical reported data, we saw over $300 million in annualized revenue, which for a crypto protocol is really incredible. It's numbers you really don't see.
00:19:00.554 - 00:20:09.422, Speaker C: This is largely driven by RWA stability fees, which is majority t bills or t bill etfs, as well as individual loans as well. And then a large chunk is coming from crypto interest revenue, which has been rising over the past few months as well. And then if you look at the price to sales and price to earnings ratio, because of these super high revenues and high net income, you see a price to sales ratio of 5.3 x, which in crypto is easily one of the lowest you'll see showing a lot of value. I mean, there's a lot of question marks as to why is it priced this low or valued this low. And I think there is something to say of RWAs and their potential growth opportunity, because there's an expectation that rates might lower in 2024, are likely to lower as well as. If you look at, I think there's another chart within the diametrics tab that looks at the PSM value, or.
00:20:09.422 - 00:20:13.266, Speaker C: Sorry, I think it's financials. No, it's right there.
00:20:13.288 - 00:20:13.586, Speaker A: Right there.
00:20:13.608 - 00:21:04.634, Speaker C: Yeah. The PSM value you can see, over time, as they've been investing in more rwas, the value of the PSM has dropped. But if you look at specifically within November December, there have been large drops where the PSM has been as low as a couple hundred million. And as a result, they have asked Coinbase custody to return some USDC that was originally given to them as part of marketing strategy. It was instead given back to the PSM because they're worried about the collateralization. And because of the low PSM, you're going to see less investment into rwas in the future. And if this number drops further, you're going to see some winding down of RWA vaults.
00:21:04.634 - 00:21:44.800, Speaker C: And so I think there's concerns around the future growth of rwas, as well as the fact that it's entirely off chain and you're trusting third parties to keep track and to generate these returns, there are a couple specific loans. Two of the RWA vaults have a certain percentage of their loans in default and are currently trying to get recourse on those. And so there's a lot of question marks. And so I think the market is sort of pricing in lower growth in these rwas, as well as the fact that they're off chain and less reliable. So I think that's definitely point number one.
00:21:46.850 - 00:21:49.600, Speaker B: Let me return. Oh, sorry.
00:21:50.530 - 00:23:38.830, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe to give some background there for those that aren't that familiar with Maker. Basically how maker deploys capital into these rwas is that they take some USDC from the peg stability module, give it to the kind of vault manager who then redeems the USDC and invests into these off chain assets. And that's why Western was saying that when the PSM or the USDC in the PSM drops, it kind of limits maker's ability to invest in, for example, t bills. So it makes sense that USDC in the PSM has historically been dropping because Maker has invested a lot of capital into that space. But now we're coming to a point where basically, I guess there's not enough demand for DAi such that USDC in the PSM gets filled, which then limits makers ability to invest into these off chain assets. But then a lot of people, as counter argument to that, are saying that, okay, now, because the bull market is kind of starting to present itself, if these revenues start dropping from t bill swallow and rwas, for example, because the interest rates are expected to go down this year. Yeah, a lot of people are saying that that will be compensated through crypto loans because basically what you're doing when you're taking out Dai from the protocol is like you're taking on leverage.
00:23:38.830 - 00:24:17.920, Speaker A: And the theory is that, and what is usually seen in a bull market is that people want more leverage. So then that would bring some non cyclicality to the protocol's revenue because usually in a bull market, rates go down, but then leverage goes up and then it works the other way around in a bear market where then these two components are pretty complementary. And then over the time, it's also assumed that the protocol can grow, which means that then the USDC and the PSM grows. And then again, maker is able to invest more into these t bills and other.
00:24:20.530 - 00:25:25.182, Speaker B: You know, you sort of anticipated one of my observation questions, I guess, which, look, if you're following along via video here, either on Spotify or YouTube, you can see where makers revenue has spiked in the past. So that was around. There was a spike in May of 2021 and then again in January of 2022. And the revenue mix was extremely different back then. So the primary driver during those periods of time were crypto interest, revenue and liquidations. To your point, brick liquidations, revenue probably kicks in when there's extreme volatility in the market. So it looks just at first glance here as if maker might have built itself something that looks like there are a couple of different complementary and actually sort of balancing revenue streams that could maybe, what's its face? Protect maker against some of the cyclicality that all crypto businesses face.
00:25:25.182 - 00:25:29.960, Speaker B: Is that a fair assessment or what would you guys think about that?
00:25:30.810 - 00:26:11.526, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely say it's a fair assessment. So if you click on the monthly time frame and scroll down a little bit, I have it split out by vault, basically. So if you scroll down below. Yeah, right there, you can see that since July, since we heard about the Blackrock ETF application, prices have obviously bottomed and started rising. And as a result, we saw the demand for leverage come back. And so a lot of revenue generated by crypto backed vaults have started to increase. And I think that's going to continue as we see prices rise throughout 2024.
00:26:11.526 - 00:26:20.790, Speaker C: And so I think it's a pretty fair assessment to say that it's pretty countercyclical to the revenues generated by RWas.
00:26:22.570 - 00:28:18.394, Speaker A: But also, one thing that should be noted is that maybe it helps to think about maker as a bank, and nothing comes free in that world where what maker is basically doing when they're buying rwas is changing their collateral type that's backing die. So what's happening is you're taking something super liquid, that being USDC, and then swapping that, for example, short term T bills, which still are liquid in a sense, but if there ever will be a huge black swan event or whatever, it would take some time for the vault managers to sell the t bills and basically push back USDC on chain. And if you remember, at the beginning of last year, we had this USDC dpegging event, which also led to Dai, kinda, or not kind of, but yeah, d pegging. And back then, people were talking about completely getting rid of the USDC PSN. And maybe it's worth mentioning that for those that don't know, the USDCPSM basically lets you swap DAi and USDC one to one, no matter what the prices are, wherever. So, yeah, Maker decided to maintain the USDC PSM, although some people were saying it's a liability to be kind of attached to that token. And the reason is that in events of high volatility, you want people to have a liquid market to change between these two tokens such that you can keep arbitraging between the two rates, and that stabilizes die a lot.
00:28:18.394 - 00:28:35.810, Speaker A: So some arm maker is kind of taking on more liquidity risk when they're investing into these t bills and rwas. And, yeah, that's an important point to make, and I think a lot of people forego that when they think about the protocol.
00:28:36.950 - 00:29:53.642, Speaker B: Yeah, I really like that analogy of maker as a bank. We've actually talked about that on the show a couple of times, and showing the similarity from a balance sheet standpoint of even something like a central bank to a bank like Morgan to maker, even know, down to the level of liquid staking protocols or stablecoins themselves, there's managing assets and liabilities, and banks, at their heart are net interest margin businesses. And just like a bank might have a portfolio of extremely liquid securities, like treasuries, you might have slightly higher interest earning, but you can't higher liquidity risk sort of portfolio of loans, for instance, to larger small businesses. And so maybe the analogy is very similar here, but also what banks typically have are other lines of revenue which counterbalance the cyclicality of their lending business. So we saw during COVID trading, profits from banks largely propped up falling lending rates, and, like the IPO market, that went dead for a little bit. So I really like the analogy here. What do you mean, brick? You were just talking about a little bit with the PSM, but this was a pretty interesting chart for me to look at.
00:29:53.642 - 00:30:34.360, Speaker B: You guys live in this data much more so than me. But just the amount of liquidity that exists in the PSM is down an enormous amount from the highs, which was back in early 2022 at 5.6 billion, it's down 90% today. Is there ever a point, you think, from a risk management perspective, where the liquidity risk that maker is taking on with their RWA portfolio is something to be concerned about, is it not? I mean, how would you, as an investor, sort of assess that?
00:30:36.090 - 00:32:00.574, Speaker A: Yeah. At least right now, I think it's quite important that there is an avenue on chain where it's easy to arbitrage, die back to its peg, and especially because it requires quite a lot of liquidity. If a black swan event ever happens, it might feel weird for somebody to see these large pools with a lot of liquidity and nobody's trading assets that much. But then if something really bad happens, it's important that the price of these stable coins can't have these large or huge wings during these kinds of events. But, yeah, I'd say right now, maker is kind of pushing the PSM liquidity to its minimum, or for the USDC vault. And it's also clear that the main kind of decision makers are taking this into account. And if the amount of USDC in this PSM vault and then into other uniswap pools drops below 300 million in total, then maker withdraws USDC from the Coinbase custody RWA vault to prop up the liquidity.
00:32:00.574 - 00:33:16.170, Speaker A: And that strengthens the peg. But as I think Vesti was alluding to earlier, was that, and this comes back to the liquidity risk point, that once the coinbase cost of the vault is completely drawn out of, and it makes sense that they start there because that's their most liquid kind of yield earning collateral, then you have to go to the next most liquid assets, which are t bills. So if that were to happen, then it kind of starts spiraling where then revenue starts dropping, you need to sell more and more, and maybe the market becomes more worried, or that would be like, kind of the worst case scenario where maker has to begin defending liquidity of diet, if that makes sense. And, yeah, I think right now is a moment where we're kind of seeing the minimum amount of USDC in the PSM such that it works. Because in recent months, there has been a lot of volatility in the PSM. Like some have speculated that it's kind of being attacked by somebody who's trying to force major into liquidating their yield earning collateral. And that's why there's been a lot of withdrawals from the Coinbase custody vault.
00:33:18.990 - 00:33:58.262, Speaker B: All right, so maybe something to keep an eye on. Walk me through, guys. We talked a little bit about the potential for Dai supply picking up and just the main driver for that being like leverage. Right. Primarily, when I think of makerdao, I know they have a large RWA portfolio, but really, the way that I think about it is people depositing crypto collateral, primarily eth, and then leveraging up, and that's what they're using DAi for. So you can kind of look at the amount of outstanding DAi as demand for that leverage. But tell me if I'm wrong about that.
00:33:58.262 - 00:34:21.230, Speaker B: Now, a huge part of that as well, and the incentive complex that underlies that, is this thing called the DSR, the dye savings rate. So you guys walk us through, because there's a pretty big change in the DSR that happened within the last three months or so. And then can you just walk us through the role that the dye savings rate plays in the amount of circulating dye?
00:34:22.790 - 00:35:38.566, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So as those who are watching this video can see the amount of circulating dye had been decreasing for a while in 2023. And at one point it was decided that. So basically, what affects makers ability to pay out interest on this DSR, which I'll explain soon, is how much profits it's making, or it's completely attached to that. And then because maker started investing more of the DAi collateral into these yield generating assets, of course, revenue goes up and profits go up, which allows the protocol to increase the DSR, which is the DAI savings rate. So maker allows DAi holders to deposit DAi into this DSR vault, which pays out a governance decided, or a yield decided by the governance. And because revenues were higher and profits were higher, it was decided that the DSR would be increased.
00:35:38.566 - 00:36:30.510, Speaker A: And it was first increased from, it had been close to zero for a long time. Then it increased 1%. That kind of didn't help it either. Then it was increased to around 3%, I think. And that didn't really induce demand. And at that point, it was decided that this enhanced DSR would be introduced, which, in short, pumped up the interest rate to 8%, which then you can see in this chart that the amount of die deposited into the DSR kind of explodes. And that's a good example of showing how the DSR can be used to induce demand for die.
00:36:30.510 - 00:37:23.174, Speaker A: But I think it should be noted that this mechanism mostly only works, or works better in a bear market when there aren't that many opportunities to deploy capital, which is when people, as I said earlier, minimize leverage and just look for safe returns. And that's why this has been pretty effective now. And then, I think going forward, what will affect the market or the amount of DAI supply is like basically how much demand there is for leverage. And then, of course, how the market sees DAi itself. So how safe does it see the asset and how liquid does it see the asset? Yeah.
00:37:23.212 - 00:38:03.846, Speaker C: Brick Devlin gave a good overview. If you want to scroll down just a little bit on that dashboard, we actually have what the die savings rate has been over time. So you can see the slight increases up to 8% at its peak, and now it's at a terminal 5%. And you can see the deposits went absolutely nuts. When they did increase to 8%, I think it increased by a billion in under a month in deposits. And since then, as the market started to rise again, like Brick said, people are sort of chasing what they think is higher potential returns in the market and withdrawing their DAI. But there's still over $1.4
00:38:03.846 - 00:38:08.150, Speaker C: billion of DAi in the DAi savings rate. Contracts.
00:38:09.470 - 00:38:30.080, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, guys, anything that we might not have covered so far? Are there critical points for investors to understand about maker moving forward? I don't even know what we're going to end up calling it. The branding change is going to throw everyone for a loop, I think, myself included, or parts of the dashboards that we haven't covered yet.
00:38:31.010 - 00:38:31.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:31.412 - 00:39:15.002, Speaker C: I think the only other thing to click on would be spark protocol, which Brick mentioned in the Subdas section earlier. But if you were to scroll up, we have a whole tab looking at Spark protocol, and it's seen immense growth since it launched in, I think it was may of last year. So they have over now $3 billion supplied in assets and over $1 billion borrowed. And that's insane growth. They're actually number twelve in terms of TVL, of all protocols, and they just launched last year. And so this is incredible growth and I think is one to keep an eye on. Right now, they're doing pre farming.
00:39:15.002 - 00:39:45.160, Speaker C: So anyone who is supplying volatile collateral and borrowing against it within Spark is going to be given a portion of, I believe it's 30 million spark tokens, which is roughly 2% after four years of subdoub farming in terms of the percentage of total supply. So a small portion of supply is being given now and then eventually they're going to start the subdoub farming. So you're able to use the new stablecoin and new governance token to farm it.
00:39:46.410 - 00:39:47.158, Speaker B: Nice.
00:39:47.324 - 00:39:47.702, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:47.756 - 00:40:29.138, Speaker B: Shout out to Sam McPherson and co for just doing an amazing job on Spark protocol. It's been, I think, one of the best year ones for a new protocol that I've certainly seen so huge. Shout out something to take advantage. You. You've. For those of you who've been following along on video, you've seen it, but we'll link in the bottom of the show notes where you can go check this out. If you're not a blockworks research subscriber, I think we can do what we can to hook you up with a trial, but we've got very comprehensive financials, dashboards built out and then deep dives on Dai real world assets, and then spark protocol.
00:40:29.138 - 00:40:37.240, Speaker B: So shout out to brick and Westy and Dan as well for putting this together.
00:40:37.610 - 00:40:38.310, Speaker C: Really cool.
00:40:38.380 - 00:40:46.700, Speaker B: And I guess just in conclusion, zooming outside of the metrics, how are we feeling about Maker as a protocol going forward into 2024?
00:40:48.190 - 00:41:05.298, Speaker A: For me, I've been looking at this or the protocol for quite a while, and already, I think back in early September, I was trying to tell people that, hey, look at this. This is going to create a lot of revenue and profits, and people are like, yeah, I don't know, not really interested.
00:41:05.464 - 00:41:06.850, Speaker B: Does it have a hat?
00:41:07.430 - 00:41:52.800, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe that's what's missing. But then maybe a week ago or something, a little narrative on at least crypto, Twitter started, where people started to talk about the redemption of maker and the revenue potential and all of this stuff, which was pretty cool to see, but I guess it didn't really sustain for that long. But I have a feeling that some of these subdoub tokens could do really well in the coming year and maybe especially when it comes to spark, because if it continues growing like this, it's definitely something to keep an eye on.
00:41:53.810 - 00:42:14.760, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the bet on fundamentals is clear, but I also think a lot of the intangibles, like the subdow farming, the fact that maker is going to be 24,000% cheaper in the future, like Unibiase is definitely a real thing. So a lot of the intangibles as well, in 2024. I think you set it up to have a good year.
00:42:15.210 - 00:42:41.402, Speaker A: Yeah. But also maybe to mention that governance is still kind of a mess. Like, not a lot of people know what's going on. It's kind of concentrated between those that are super knowledgeable about the protocol. And also, yeah, endgame is a big question mark still. So maybe keep that in mind if you're trying to look at this. It's a good flag.
00:42:41.466 - 00:43:05.542, Speaker B: It's a good flag. Hard to underwrite the complexity, but we'll see. I think you guys said it. Well, only in crypto can you run these types of extremely bold experiments. And the boomer part of my brain looks at this and it's like, this seems like there's a lot of moving parts, but I want to root for people that are taking big swings. That's definitely what Maker's doing. So props to the entire team over there.
00:43:05.542 - 00:44:24.094, Speaker B: All right, I want to move away from maker for a second here and talk about something that became a big debate on Twitter again this week because Vitalik talked about potentially increasing the target gas limit on Ethereum main chain. And this has been, I guess, gas fees and transaction fees in general, has been a topic that's polarized people since time immemorial in crypto, when people were talking about this in bitcoin, and then people started talking about it within the context of Ethereum and fees being extremely high on main chain. And there's sort of one camp that says, actually that makes the protocol unusable multicoin calls this anti network effects. And then there's another group of people that says, look, honestly, history has proven out that people are willing to pay the higher fees, and generally high fees are a source of high demand. I think this has come under increasing pressure as Solana has had an extremely successful year in comeback and it's just reignited this debate about fees. And to editorialize a little bit and put my personal take, I think put some healthy pressure on Ethereum, I would say. And even within the Ethereum camp, there's kind of two different perspectives, which is that it doesn't really matter.
00:44:24.094 - 00:45:22.882, Speaker B: The entire end game for Ethereum is to move users onto L2s, so it doesn't matter the gas fees on L2 or on ETH main chain, and we're going to get upgrades. So Dankun, in the near future, I believe that's slated for April and then full dank sharding after that. At some point that's going to make it trivially inexpensive for users to transact and basically execution on the network. But then there's another group of people that say okay, but 4844 is not necessarily going to increase bandwidth to the degree there's not enough bandwidth there for all of these different roll ups, and fees are still going to be expensive. And aside from that, why wouldn't we? There's a lot of slack actually on ETH main chain to raise gas fees. And so Vitalik posted something this week, and I'll turn it over to you guys to get your perspectives here, but the quote that he posted was honestly, I think doing a modest gas limit increase even today is reasonable. The gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, which is the longest time ever in protocol's history.
00:45:22.882 - 00:46:06.580, Speaker B: That two x bump in the chart in late 2021 is a fake, in that it reflects the EIP 1559 transition, which increased the limit by two x, but actually only increased average usage by 9%. So basically, splitting the post 2021 gains from Moore's law 50 50 increase between increased capacity and increased ease of syncing and verification would imply an increase to 40 million or so. So what do you guys think in general about aside from Vitalik's comment about the idea of making it more inexpensive for users to transact on eth main chain, is that a useful or worthwhile thing to do, or is that just going to be kind of the ultrasound money base layer and then people are going to move to l two, so it doesn't really matter.
00:46:07.590 - 00:47:05.978, Speaker C: Yeah, when I first saw this, I was super confused, because to me, a lot of the talking points and the Ethereum roadmap that has been talked about for the past few years is really focused on, okay, the roll up scaling roadmap, all users are going to move to l two s. The l one is just going to host, basically roll up data, and another one would be client diversity. You want to make the l one as robust as possible. And to me, this is pretty antithetical to both of those things. And John Tribunau had a good tweet where he said, theorem is kind of in this middle ground of, yeah, we want all users to end up on roll ups and that's where they transact, but we also want the l one to be performant and people to use that too. And they kind of have to pick one or the other. And to me, raising the gas limit doesn't make much sense because it's going to lower client diversity at the execution layer.
00:47:05.978 - 00:48:01.720, Speaker C: Right now, I think, like, over 85% of clients are using Geth. And the second client, Basu, has had a lot of issues in the recent past, and someone actually commented on that thread under Vitalik and put the specs, basically the potential block times of performance for the different execution clients, and basically was way less performant than Geth. And so when you increase the gas limit, you're going to see a lot of people just switch from the minority client to the majority. And so you're pushing client diversity to be weaker with this move. And so as a result, I just think it's kind of a weird move, given that we want to push users to the l two. So if it were me, I'd be against the gas limit. I'd say as an l one, you want to create it to be as robust as possible.
00:48:01.720 - 00:48:09.580, Speaker C: You don't care necessarily about the fees to transact because all users are going on the l two anyway. That's my overall view.
00:48:11.710 - 00:49:07.340, Speaker A: Yeah. To me, this kind of feels like now with Solana having taken a lot of mind share, maybe some people are starting to wonder that, are we going to lose liquidity, or are we going to lose users? And now we quickly have to come up with some quick fix solution to, I don't know, maybe turn the narrative around or get back at the front of people's minds. And I think Westy summarized it really well, that you want to kind of focus on your strengths instead of trying to hit every box here. And I think Ethereum strengths going forward will be on the l two level. And it just feels weird that they're going to, or that you would make exchanges like this on the l one level.
00:49:09.390 - 00:50:16.614, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I generally agree with the two of you. But I think one thing that on the other hand, Ethereum has always been extremely conservative around their gas policy because they're very worried about state growth and there's a lot more capacity on the network than they're actually basically allowing for in the current state. So if you could get kind of a low hanging fruit, easy win here, why wouldn't be, I guess would be my question. The thing that I feel like Solana has really nailed, and I don't hear as much from the Ethereum camp, but Vitalik just alluded to it here, is Moore's law is a thing, it does exist. And actually things like bandwidth are improving as well, slowly over time. Like people have better access to Internet, and the assumptions that Ethereum, the protocol has are very conservative.
00:50:16.614 - 00:50:33.960, Speaker B: So I don't know, it's kind of like, I get it. You don't want to be stuck in this messy middle ground where you're trying to ride two horses with one ass. But at the same time, if you can make low hanging improvements, kind of, why would you seed that market share?
00:50:35.770 - 00:51:24.950, Speaker C: But it's also a trade off as well, right? Because Solana, their focus is on performance, and as a result, they're going to have less client diversity. Because even with fire dancer, if they agree that performance is their main focus, all of the clients will switch to fire dancer. No one's going to use the old Solana labs client because the network is only as good as your worst client, and every individual validator is going to want to have the highest performance, and as a result, you have no client diversity, whereas Ethereum in theory is focused on more decentralization robustness, and as a result focuses on client diversity and maybe takes away a little bit from performance, but as a result makes themselves more robust in general. So I think it's a trade off overall.
00:51:26.250 - 00:52:27.450, Speaker B: Well, this is going to get into the second topic that we're going to discuss here anyway, but do you think that more clients, like a higher amount of client diversity, is more robust? And if so, do you think you max out a certain amount? And the argument here being client diversity is something that's been argued about again, we're probably talking about the two oldest, longest standing arguments within all of crypto and protocol design. But if you look at bitcoin, bitcoin has one major client, which is core. And the argument there, actually, and what maybe Adam back would say if you were on this program, is that actually more clients does not make a protocol more robust, because what you're essentially doing is dividing attention and sets of eyeballs between two different clients, and you might actually miss like bugs or something like that. It's kind of the Stan Druckenmiller. I like to keep all of my eggs in one basket and then watch that basket extremely closely. And if you look at. So I think I'm understanding this correctly, that Coinbase has come.
00:52:27.450 - 00:53:08.150, Speaker B: So people pointed out that a bunch of the validators run by Coinbase have missed lots recently, and Besu, which is, I guess, the way that they originally positioned themselves as kind of an enterprise friendly Java client, but it's much less performant than the other clients that exist. And so the flip side of having multiple clients is you're only as strong as your weakest link, so to speak. And actually by trying to allow creating the specs for the protocol around essentially the lowest common denominator of what a client is capable of, you're actually needlessly holding the network back. So that's the flip side. What do you guys think about the argument?
00:53:09.230 - 00:53:34.826, Speaker C: Yeah, I know effort capital on our team agrees with Adam Beck on this point, that you're actually more robust with one client, because like you said, all eyes are focused on making sure this client is robust as possible, as well as over time. If things converge to one client that is the most performant, the most secure, et cetera, then it's sort of found lindiness. It's sort of one.
00:53:34.868 - 00:53:35.170, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:35.240 - 00:53:52.120, Speaker C: So I understand that argument. This is definitely out of my realm of expertise, but I know that within the Ethereum camp that they believe strongly in client diversity and that being the path to more robustness. But I could definitely see both visions here.
00:53:53.050 - 00:54:41.078, Speaker A: Yeah. What comes to my mind at first, and I don't know if this completely applies, but if you think about free markets and competition in the market, it usually is much more beneficial to have robust competition because then that pushes like everybody else to kind of innovate and coming up with the best product. So I kind of flip the argument of only one client being good because everybody's looking at it. Because if you have a lot of clients that are getting built, there will be different approaches to these things, and then you might find something good at this client and then something that works better at this other client. And maybe that's going to then kind of move forward like the, I don't know, whole industry or clients as a.
00:54:41.084 - 00:55:22.290, Speaker B: Whole, a middle ground in between what we're talking about here, just to even maybe get a little bit more granular, is there three basic market structures that exist, winner take all, fragmented, and then an oligopoly market structure that sits in the middle. And maybe the optimal end state for clients is not pure winner take all, one client or many different clients, but like two. Could it be two? I mean, does that create enough competition? Maybe, I have no idea, but it seems like that actually might be. And that's like roughly where it's sort of shaken out for Ethereum as well. There are a ton of different clients.
00:55:22.870 - 00:55:40.300, Speaker A: Why I was saying that I'm not sure this market theory kind of applies here because I'm not sure if you can say that clients are straight up competing against each other. Maybe it's not the same structure here, and that's why I'm kind of being careful with what I'm saying here. But maybe I have some thoughts there.
00:55:41.870 - 00:56:24.354, Speaker B: You might be right. I'm almost venturing out of my zone of competence here. But one other question that I have for you guys on the Ethereum gas conversation is how much do you think the performance of Ethereum main chain actually impacts long run the performance of roll ups? So what I'm kind of saying is roll ups are going to have to pay some amount of tax down to Ethereum, be that today it's data availability and settlement. Now I expect validiums to get much more popular in this coming market cycle. And okay, they're outsourcing. Da. And you can make a pretty solid argument.
00:56:24.354 - 00:57:47.860, Speaker B: I think right off the bat, if cost was a little bit more reasonable, then maybe more roll up teams would opt to be pure play roll ups, as Doncrad has reminded us, instead of validiums. Right? So that's like an example of how if again, gas costs and compute was priced a little bit more reasonably in, then, then maybe we'd have that. But either way there's always going to be some amount that gets paid down to Ethereum. And let's just be really bullish here and say there are going to be thousands of roll ups in the future or a couple of roll ups that are enormous, right? Or I guess how much does the performance and cost of ethereum ultimately end up impacting the end user on roll ups? Like one of the things that is starting to be in vogue again is bitcoin. Right, roll ups on bitcoin. But the thing that they're constrained by outside of a community which doesn't really want them is the performance of bitcoin, the base layer, right? There's a totally different architecture and like ten minute block times and extremely small blocks that just makes it wildly difficult. So right now, Ethereum looks kind of performant, but you've got new age competitors like Celestia coming up, and if you don't try to keep the base layer performant at all, then who's to say some of these new l ones, because they're clearly going to be new l ones.
00:57:47.860 - 00:57:50.850, Speaker B: What's to stop them from eating Ethereum's.
00:57:51.830 - 00:59:04.940, Speaker C: Lunch, so to speak? Yeah, I actually do think that's a really good point and probably a point towards raising the gas limit in that, like you said, there are a lot of da layers that are a lot cheaper than Ethereum is going to be under protodank sharding and even under dank sharding. And as a result, you're probably going to see a lot of, like you said, validiums or celestiums as they're calling them, pop up, where they're using some sort of external Da layer, but still settling to Ethereum. And with that, Ethereum probably needs to focus a little bit on creating the best settlement layer, and with that means more liquidity and at least enough performance to basically facilitate better liquidity in trading, et cetera. Because if they don't focus on that, then suddenly you could have a more performant l one, gain a bunch of liquidity, and people just use that as a settlement layer or create a trust minimized bridge to that l one. So I definitely think it's a great point. And is one for the reason why increasing the gas limit may be a good idea?
00:59:07.070 - 00:59:38.806, Speaker A: Yeah. And this kind of comes down to one thing I've been thinking about a lot lately. Is that okay, if Ethereum, at the end of the day just becomes a settlement layer, what's the value capture at that point of the layer? Yes, it's super important for the layers that are below it, but for the token itself, how do you then justify where it's valued and like how close to moneyness it is, or whatever you.
00:59:38.828 - 00:59:39.960, Speaker C: Want to call it?
00:59:42.890 - 01:00:51.840, Speaker B: Yeah, this was originally one of my problems when bitcoin people started saying it was that this is going to be the ultimate settlement layer for every asset on the planet and yada yada. I just don't really believe that. But what I also don't believe is that I just don't really understand why that would accrue an enormous amount of value to you. And there's plenty of examples where if you look at stablecoins, where do they mostly settle down to? Not to bitcoin, to freaking Tron, because it's cost efficient. And one of the things that, it's been kind of frustrating to me, if you talk to people about why fees are what they are, it's like, well, we have to price compute resources. I get that you have to price compute resources, but why don't we approach the problem from how can we improve? How can we optimize those costs instead of just accepting those as some sort of static thing? And maybe that's a really stupid perspective, but I feel like we should be focusing more on how to drive that down while maintaining security. And you can actually, I'll link it in the show notes, but there's a really great exchange in between.
01:00:51.840 - 01:01:35.386, Speaker B: Peter, I'm going to blank on his last name, I just can't pronounce it. And you know, Martin is an OG Ethereum guy, but also one of the sort of most respected kind of builders in the space, I would say. And there's a really interesting back and forth between the perspectives where Peter's clearly arguing from the standpoint, I think a lot of people at the Ethereum foundation optimize for safety. Like they see raising the gas limit as taking on new risks, whereas Martin is like, dude, people need to build businesses on this. Even at transaction that still prices out an enormous amount of businesses. So just interesting. You can read the back and forth though.
01:01:35.386 - 01:02:36.942, Speaker B: I think it was good. All right, I've got one more update for you guys, and maybe we can use it as a jumping off point. I've also had this, a long discussion about this this week about whether or not rollups were going to try to use their native token as gas, or whether they're going to use ETh for that. So this is a proposal that went live on Starknet back in December, but the proposal is to support for add support for fee payments and STRK, and reduce transaction fees. And basically the idea is, I think it's been a long standing question about what is the primary currency, I suppose, or however you want to frame it, that these roll ups are going to use. And you have examples of roll ups using ETH. So base is a good example of that.
01:02:36.942 - 01:03:35.502, Speaker B: But there's also, I think a lot of these roll ups are going to want to use their own native tokens. And Stark, this proposal for STRK is particularly interesting because it looks like what they're going to do is enable new features for payments in STRK that would only apply to if you're paying in STRk. So that includes basically they're going to build their own native fee market, which allows users to compete for block space during congestion. So basically creating some sort of feature equivalent to 1559. There's going to be a paymaster type solution where you as an entity can sponsor users transactions. And again, if I'm reading this correctly, it looks like that is only going to be a feature for payments in STRK. And then something called volition mode, which permits users and devs to opt out of expensive l one da in favor of much cheaper alternatives, I guess like celestia.
01:03:35.502 - 01:04:02.650, Speaker B: So that's actually super interesting. And so, yeah, I think if you just read what those things are, it's a combination of like there's an obvious incentive for stark where for value to accrue to stark in some way. And something like a fee market is really central to the idea of sovereignty for these chains. So what do you guys think about the idea of l two s using their own native token as sort of the primary currency for transactions?
01:04:05.640 - 01:05:27.644, Speaker C: I mean, the reason why you would use something like ETH, or maybe tia, is because it simplifies the accounting because the roll up has to pay the l one or the DA layer in order to post their data or settle there, right? So it just helps with the accounting. If you're to use a native token, it means that you either need to create a system of swapping the native token for the underlying, or you require someone to take on some duration risk where now they're long the token in short eth or short tia, et cetera. And you have constant sell pressure of the token over time. So let's say stark is posting $10 million worth of data to ethereum per year. Well, that's $10 million in sell pressure if they're looking to pay, if people are paying in stark, and they need to convert that to ETH. And so as a result, you basically need to think about the trade off of, okay, I'm definitely increasing the value of my token and its utility, potentially demand, but I'm also creating a constant stream of sell pressure, and I have to deal with sort of the accounting and the potential things that could go wrong with that, such as there not being enough liquidity between the native token and eth, et cetera. So yeah, I think it's just a trade off.
01:05:27.644 - 01:05:59.784, Speaker C: Teams are definitely going to start thinking about it. And I also think that it depends entirely as well on how cheap the data that they're posting to the l one is. Right. So if they're paying Celestia, let's say $100,000 a year, well, yeah, they're definitely okay with having $100,000 in sell pressure for over a whole year. It's definitely worth it to increase the utility of your native token. But with something like Ethereum's current costs, it's definitely not something you'd want to do.
01:05:59.822 - 01:06:00.120, Speaker A: So.
01:06:00.190 - 01:06:02.152, Speaker C: Yeah, just something teens have to think about.
01:06:02.286 - 01:06:31.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess in these, this is me just injecting my own opinion. But outside of arbitrum and optimism and even long term optimism and arbitrum, I just can't see any of these roll ups paying Ethereum for DA. So my base assumption is going to be that this all gets outsourced to Celestia or Eigen Da. I just can't construct a rational framework for why they would want to do that. It's just far, way too much.
01:06:34.020 - 01:06:34.384, Speaker A: Is.
01:06:34.422 - 01:06:58.280, Speaker B: The, that's the primary reason why you wouldn't do this, is just the accounting difficulty and sell pressure. But I think settlement to ethereum for these roll ups is pretty minimal cost. Like I think probably on the order of $50,000 to $100,000 a year, and then it's going to be roughly the same for TIA or eigenda. So I don't know, I feel like that's sort of minimal.
01:06:59.020 - 01:07:40.010, Speaker A: Yeah. But one thing I've been thinking about is why not kind of flip it around and have l two users pay in the kind of the underlying token. So for example, in this case, eat. And then the l two decides on a certain profit margin for itself. And from that profit margin it accounts or sets aside a certain amount of e, which it then uses to buy the native token. So you're kind of foregoing the FX risk or the duration risk of the two assets, but still you accrue value to the underlying token of the l two.
01:07:42.880 - 01:08:06.256, Speaker B: That's an interesting idea. I guess the other reason that you might want to do it is just because it sucks from a UX. Like, not to call out, but there's a cosmos platform that I tried to use recently and it kind of makes you the default is to pay in the native token. It's like, this sucks. This is so annoying. I was annoyed by that. So yeah, there's probably ux reason, Bret.
01:08:06.256 - 01:08:18.970, Speaker B: I think that's a good observation too. So there are probably arguments in both camps. It might end up being a dual sort of system where eth one is default and then there's a native token too. It's an option?
01:08:19.740 - 01:08:40.210, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the best user experience would be give the users the ability to choose what token they want to use as gas. I know osmosis says something along these lines where you can use atom to pay for gas and I'm guessing they're going to add more assets once they become more liquid on osmosis, but yeah, the more choice the user has, the better.
01:08:40.660 - 01:09:08.200, Speaker A: Agreed. But yeah, at the end of the day, what's important to remember is also that the underlying token kind of has to have this money ness component or this kind of value accrual component. So I also get why, even though it sucks, for example, from a UX perspective, at some point you just have to come with some kind of, or come up with some kind of an idea how to kind of effectively use your own native token.
01:09:08.780 - 01:09:57.844, Speaker B: Right? These tokens have to be useful for something. At the end of the day, I don't know, but I still don't have a really vividly clear mental model for l two tokens in general. I don't think these are like moneyness token things. I don't think l two staking makes an enormous amount of sense, so I don't really know what they are to be honest. But if a bunch of the activity ends up migrating to l two s, one way to easily do that is to basically jam your token in. And yeah, it's not an ideal user experience, but still got leverage, baby. All right guys, that feels like as good of a place to end it as any westy brick, appreciate the two of you hopping on.
01:09:57.844 - 01:10:12.110, Speaker B: And yeah, guys, as you can see, both these guys know more about maker than most people will ever know. And definitely go check out the dashboard yourself. And yeah, guys, appreciate you coming on.
01:10:12.720 - 01:10:14.350, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
01:10:14.720 - 01:10:15.610, Speaker A: Thank you, thank you.
