00:00:00.400 - 00:00:39.108, Speaker A: Generally, l two s are very interested, but as I said, they have very distinct profiles. And the example, the real world example I'd like to give here is the EU a little bit. You did have a leading l two there, England, and they opted to stay out of the EU. A lot of large corporations that are creating a new headquarters are now doing it in Ireland because of ease of interoperability, if you will. It's very easy for that worker to migrate to the headquarters in Ireland, whereas they have to get a visa and a whole bunch of headaches if they have to go to England. So I would think this would pertain to l two s as well.
00:00:39.196 - 00:01:14.258, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, this episode is brought to you by, say, the blazing fast parallelized blockchain which is unlocking Solana like performance for the vast ocean of ETH devs out there. Now, you're going to be hearing all about, say and their new v two upgrade. But if you take away one thing, the EVM is here to stay. There are some problems with it, which we're going to get into later in the episode, but se, and especially their v two upgrade is helping solve that. So thank you very much, se, for making this episode possible. Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by Uniswap, delivering the best on chain trading experience in crypto, period, bar none. One thing I want to call out is the Uniswap extension, so say goodbye.
00:01:14.258 - 00:01:45.350, Speaker B: These days of these annoying as our pop up wallet extensions, you lose your place trading, you have to open it back up. Uniswap now has a nice, sleek sidebar that persists no matter where you are on the web. It's much easier to use if you click the link at the bottom of this episode. You can join the waiting list, and I'll see what I can do to get you moved up that waiting list. But definitely go click the link, check it out. If you're building anything in web three, you likely need Oracle's and verifiable randomness. That's why Bell Curve is partnering up with Supra, which offers the fastest oracles and D VRF free for listeners of Bellcurve for twelve months.
00:01:45.350 - 00:02:05.698, Speaker B: And you can get that@supra.com blockworks the link there is in the show notes. Or stick around. We're gonna be talking about them later in the program. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

00:02:13.938 - 00:02:15.854, Speaker C: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:02:17.954 - 00:02:26.898, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Today Hart and I are joined by Jonas from Chainbound and Marat from Primeval. Guys, welcome to the program.
00:02:27.066 - 00:02:28.354, Speaker A: It's good to be here.
00:02:28.514 - 00:02:30.610, Speaker D: Thanks for having us, guys.
00:02:30.642 - 00:03:10.922, Speaker B: We're pumped. Today we're going to be talking about something that really feels like it's on the vanguard of innovation, which is pre conformations. And before we get into that, which is inevitably going to be a little bit of a technical subject, I actually want to start with a state of the union of ETH L two s at the current moment. And obviously there's a lot to be excited about on Ethel two s, but maybe we could actually start with some of the challenges and almost the problem statement that is making folks excited about pre conformations today. So Marat or Jonas, whoever is feeling bravest and wants to kick us off, can you give us a state of like what's going on on ETH L two S? And what are some of the issues that people are looking at that has us looking at pre confirmations as a solution?
00:03:11.098 - 00:03:52.064, Speaker D: One of the bigger problems right now that a lot of people are talking about is centralized sequencers. This has been a problem for a long time, but decentralizing the sequencer is pretty hard to do, especially if you want like the really good ux that comes from a centralized sequencer. So I think that's one. I think another one is composability. Right? So if you have a central. If each of the roll ups has their own sequencer, it's really hard to get at least synchronous composability between them. So I think that's why, like shared sequencing based sequencing, I think that's why it's a hot topic right now because it does solve some of these issues.
00:03:52.064 - 00:03:54.684, Speaker D: Murat, do you want to add anything to that?
00:03:54.804 - 00:04:35.004, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree with that. And then what we've also discovered is that there's very different profiles when it comes to l two s, particularly. I mean, there's, you know, optimistic roll ups, ZK roll ups. Within ZK roll ups, there's different types of proofs that are being used. Some generate more data, some generate less data, some have a other considerations than this validiums. So it's very hard to kind of, you know, paint them with one brush, if you will. So we really need to have some abstraction mechanisms, maybe that, you know, that pertain to each one of them and not necessarily solve for a specific type of l two.
00:04:36.664 - 00:05:11.570, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe to sum some of these challenges up and we can start to segment it from the perspective of different stakeholders in the ecosystem. We can maybe talk about this from the perspective of the user. From the user's perspective, it feels like the l two landscape on Ethereum is pretty fragmented. It almost feels like the canonical journey is maybe you start on Coinbase, you go to ETH mainchain, and then you have to make these weird bridging decisions. Do I go up to optimism or arbitrum? Once I'm on optimism, it's tough for me to get my assets over to arbitrum, unless you're using across my right heart. But ultimately it feels like a pretty fragmented landscape, which is a challenge.
00:05:11.570 - 00:06:21.376, Speaker B: I think something that we're going to get into that might be more of an invisible challenge, but it definitely still exists, is quantifying some of the risk that you're taking on as user. And there are different types of risk, but definitely execution risk is one. We can talk about way the pre conformations play into that, I think another challenge, and maybe this is one of the reasons why based sequencing, this idea of base sequencing, by the way, to give a quick definition of that, it's when instead of using an additional provider like Espresso or something like that, to sequence the roll ups as a shared sequencer, you're actually using Ethereum itself to be a sequencer for the roll up. I think one of the reasons why there's been renewed interest in base sequencing, which is actually not a super new concept, but it's being augmented with these pre conformations that we're going to start to talk about is, I think there's a little bit of a concern about, hey, what is the value proposition of Ethereum? Where's our lock in? Especially as roll ups are starting to transition to becoming validiums and they're using alt da solutions, right. Some of that lock in for where you have to buy ETH in this process is starting to go away. And I think that's. I don't know if you guys have anything to add to it, but I think there's a couple of different ways that we could look at this.
00:06:21.376 - 00:06:47.034, Speaker B: Maybe from the perspective of different stakeholders and pre confirmations are being. Maybe the background in which pre confirmations are start to be big subject of interest. And I want to get into some of the different flavors of preconfirmations that exist and define what that is. So maybe either Marauder or Jonas, could one of you guys give us just a definition of like what a pre conformation is and then we can get into some of the different flavors about how they could be implemented.
00:06:47.414 - 00:07:33.048, Speaker A: Sure. You know, we published this article defining it as a credible heads up before a confirmation happens. And what's notable about this definition is that it's not about web three or blockchains. And we give this example of Amazon that fulfills your order when you make an order with Amazon and essentially gives you a pre confirmation even though Amazon's not delivering the order, usually USP's, FedEx or some other delivery specialized entity is delivering the order. But Amazon's pre confirmation is credible enough that you don't actually check USP's most of the time that you make an order from Amazon, it tells you it's going to be there in two days. So we like to apply this framework to how we think about pre conformations under web three and Ethereum as well.
00:07:33.176 - 00:08:10.824, Speaker C: One thing to push on there. So when we go back to like central, so your credible commitment, the credible heads up that something's going to happen. Credibility here, I think is kind of an interesting term because there's many ways you could presumably do that. So just to make the difference to the landscape today, where we have centralized sequencers run by the optimism labs and arbitrum labs, those entities are giving you a pre conformation today from their centralized sequencer where that heads up is basically guaranteed by the credibility of those teams. Do you agree with that?
00:08:11.204 - 00:08:21.260, Speaker A: Yeah, to some degree. And I would say the users abide by that credibility or think it's sufficient or they don't and they don't use that. Right. So, yeah, I agree with that.
00:08:21.452 - 00:08:58.500, Speaker C: Yeah. I guess actually even to go a step back just to make sure the audience is all clued on what we're talking about. Like when you submit a transaction to one of these l two s, I'll just pick optimism. When you go to optimism, you submit a transaction, the centralized sequencer is giving you a pre confirmation that your transaction did succeed or not and is going to be included. But you don't actually know that fully until, well, there's a little bit of a pipeline there until it's checkpointed five minutes ish later. And then technically you got to make sure that there's not a fault in that checkpoint. Right.
00:08:58.500 - 00:09:09.184, Speaker C: So just so we're all on the same page, we're talking about pre conformations. They exist today. Today. But they're coming from, their credibility is determined by a centralized entity for the most part.
00:09:10.204 - 00:09:34.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that's similar to Amazon. Right. I mean, Amazon gives you, your package is going to be there in two days. Any number of events can happen in between. Actually, if you order enough from Amazon, sometimes those packages don't get delivered in two days where it's the wrong package or it gets delivered to somebody else and all that. But that doesn't, I mean that takes away a little bit from Amazon's credibility, but it still has, keeps it 99% more or less. Right.
00:09:34.340 - 00:09:43.708, Speaker A: And next time you're making an order from Amazon. Yeah. You do recall that one time that things went wrong, but things still go through most of the time. So I would say it's akin to that.
00:09:43.836 - 00:10:13.520, Speaker B: Okay, I like that. I really like that example of Amazon. I'd actually like to expand that definition and even say like when you make a payment with your Visa credit card, Visa is also giving you in a sense a pre confirmation because that actually hasn't been really settled. Right. These are sort of payments networks, which is the equivalent of like the tradvi equivalent of l two. Those are all going to get batched and then submitted to a bank where that's ultimately going to end up being settled. So just like in the world of Mev, where, you know, I know Hasu will talk about like Google Ad auctions as a form of Mev.
00:10:13.520 - 00:10:49.224, Speaker B: Like honestly, you could kind of look at that same thing and say you get pre confirmations everywhere. I would love to get a sense of when you're looking at someone that's giving you a pre confirmation, what is the advantage that they're getting? And then what risk or cost are they taking on as well? Maybe, Jonas, I don't know if you have a sense because I think one of the ways that you could look at the different flavors or models for pre confirmations is who is giving you the pre conformation? Which ultimately begs the question, why is that in their interest to do so? Right. So like what is the advantage and maybe cost that they're taking on there?
00:10:50.244 - 00:11:37.364, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. So currently centralized sequencers, they would give pre confirmations because it just enhances ux, right. It just makes using the roll up a lot smoother. But in a base roll up world, there do need to be some like incentivization for different entities to give out pre confirmations. And I think a lot of that is translated in the pre confirmation tip. So the idea today is to add like a different tip that can be priced like any other way that would pay a certain pre confer or the entity that is pre conforming at that time an additional fee for actually giving out the pre confirmation commitment or promising to include it at a certain time in the future.
00:11:39.064 - 00:12:31.884, Speaker C: So actually I'm going to keep going backwards here just to make sure all the users or listeners are on the same page. So what we have today with rollups, I want to know if you guys agree if we separate this into two parts where the roll up is making transactions cheap by effectively aggregating and compressing them off chain and then checkpointing on chain periodically, but that in and of itself is actually very slow. So we'll roll up today. If we don't include a pre conformation, you might get cheap transactions, but the UX is shitty because it'd be very slow. And then what we've done to make the UX good, so we want the, for the UX, we want it to be fast and cheap. So we figured out cheapness by doing this l two compression. To make it fast we have to add in a pre conformation that says yep, with a high degree of certainty your transaction is going to be included and is going to succeed.
00:12:31.884 - 00:13:22.654, Speaker C: And right now centralized sequencers are doing this function for free. Effectively they're not really getting paid to do this, they're doing it because they want their l two to be the one that wins or whatever else, highly competitive marketplace for it. So they're centrally sequencing these things and delivering pre confirmations for free. And that works today, although you are trusting those centralized sequencers, what we're going to be talking about is other mechanisms to deliver pre conformations outside of a centralized sequencer. And those, Jonas, what you were talking about, those other mechanisms, there's going to be some costs we're going to have to pay for them somehow, and that's both to decentralize the sequencer and then maybe to add in other Ux benefits like cross chain composability. Agreed?
00:13:22.694 - 00:13:58.684, Speaker D: Yes, I think that's right. And like initially it might seem strange that you have like centralized sequencers giving out pre conformations for free and then like decentralizing the role and all of a sudden you might have to pay a bit more for like a pre confirmation. And like, at first I think it's intuitive that decentralization will cost a bit more. But hopefully by having all of the advantages and like composability that shared sequencing or base sequencing brings, in the end it might be worth the cost or actually cheaper than a centralized sequencer, but we'll have to see on that.
00:14:02.624 - 00:14:16.404, Speaker A: I would say that the cost is likely to increase. As you know, there's more actors that need to coordinate in some shape or form, but perhaps we can abstract some of that and have still, or deliver still a similar ux to the end user.
00:14:17.264 - 00:14:48.374, Speaker C: Murat, I want to add like one silver lining bit to that too, which is like, in a very technical way, as I understand it, blobs. Blobs are very large. So blobs are what is making l two s very cheap. Now, blobs are very large. They're actually much, much larger than they like need to be for any individual roll up today. And so maybe, maybe there are ways to actually make the cost of this decentralized pre conformation not any higher because we are like sharing blob space, maybe.
00:14:49.234 - 00:15:00.410, Speaker A: Yeah, the overall cost can go down, but, you know, the pre confirmation cost maybe can go up incrementally, but that's negligible regarding the overall cost. So that's very feasible.
00:15:00.442 - 00:15:01.014, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:02.314 - 00:15:49.004, Speaker B: So I want to get a sense of what are some of the diff. Who are some of the different entities that could be acting as a pre confer or issuing these pre conformations. And maybe to just maybe that's a good way to segment into different models as well. But one proposed solution that we've been sort of talking about is based pre confirmations, where the l one proposers are actually the issuer of pre confirmations. But then you could also look at it from the standpoint of maybe a builder, builders who are building these blocks. Realistically, there are, what, like three of them today? They're the ones who are issuing the pre conformations. And maybe we could get into, I think, actually, if I'm correct, maybe speaking a little bit too broadly here, but your solution, Primev, kind of started from their perspective of approaching builders to get them to issue pre confirmations.
00:15:49.004 - 00:16:11.848, Speaker B: And, Jonas, you approach it a little bit more from the base pre conformation standpoint. So maybe, Murat, can we start with you? What is this? Explain the model behind getting builders to order pre conformations. How would that actually sort of work logistically? If you could just get us into some of the more technical description and then pros and cons would be really helpful as well. Yeah.
00:16:11.896 - 00:17:05.510, Speaker A: So I have a product background, right? So I've been a product manager for seven, eight years at least, and I'm a firm believer in asking users their problems and what they need. When I was a product lead at Block native and we had about ten to 14% of block building power on Ethereum l one. Right after the merge, there was the number one kind of request or question I was getting from searchers was that, can you guarantee me next block execution? So I want my transaction to be in the next block that you're building. Well, as someone who had 10% of the network, that meant 90% of the time. I can't give you that. And that was problematic. And at the first Mevboost stewards gathering at Devcon, Bogota, I raised this issue and put out this idea that, what if we had a network of block builders that these users could interact with, and the network could give these guarantees, even though each individual actor might not be able to.
00:17:05.510 - 00:17:52.854, Speaker A: And this was interesting enough where lots of people encouraged me to pursue this idea. And eventually I founded Primev, and it eventually became Mevcommit, which is this network that we've been developing to facilitate this. But, yeah, the fundamental issue there was, how can we let these consumers of block space kind of get these network level guarantees on being in the next block? We weren't naming this as a pre confirmation at the time, but this is a core user problem that I started with, along with my co founder and others on a journey to solve. So that's the angle that we came in. After a year and a half, there's been lots of the expansion of the design space for pre conformations. The roll up ecosystem proliferated. Blobs are a thing.
00:17:52.854 - 00:18:27.594, Speaker A: Now. There's all sorts of different pre conformations that we're learning about and kind of researching. So the design space is very, very large, I would say. But, yeah, that was the angle. And because builders have their own mempool and have the ultimate visibility into the mempool, if you will, for their own sake, each builder is in the best position to make the decision whether to pre confirm a transaction or not. Now, this pertains more to defi transactions, I would say, and trades, and there may be other actors, like relays or others, that are in better positions to preconfirm other types of transactions.
00:18:29.054 - 00:19:22.040, Speaker B: Okay, that makes a ton of sense to me. I think one challenge there, from that standpoint, would be, okay, it makes a lot of sense. Builders have an enormous amount of visibility either into the public mempool, but also whatever sources of private order flow that they're looking at. So they probably have the most confirmation, or, sorry, the most comprehensive view of all the transactions at any one point, which will allow them to price. I actually have a lot of questions about how you price price pre conformations. But one of the challenges there is that ultimately all this is going to have to settle down to ETH, and the entity that has the monopoly on the next block is whatever proposer ultimately ends up getting selected. So I would assume there'd be some kind of liability of if this builder is issuing all these different pre confirmations, they can have really granular understanding of how to price that, but they still can't guarantee that those transactions are going to land.
00:19:22.040 - 00:19:25.804, Speaker B: So I'd imagine that that's, there'd be some amount of liability there, right?
00:19:26.144 - 00:20:16.234, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And this is, you know, this is how we came up with this fulfillment consortium model where let's say there's three large builders that more or less build all of the blocks, and if all of them give you a commitment, then you don't need the proposer's involvement, really. However, this is further strengthened if the proposer is involved as well. If the proposer will say, hey, I will ratify a block that comes from, you know, someone who is committed to this transaction, then the commitment becomes ultimately credible, essentially. You know, that, you know, if I'm making an Amazon order that USP's will deliver this order, whatever it is. So ultimately, it's a coordination problem that you want all of these actors to coordinate. And like, if I could wave some magic wand and have every actor along the Mav pipeline give me a commitment for my transaction, I would love that.
00:20:16.234 - 00:20:38.734, Speaker A: Right. So it's not even just the proposer, because the proposer can say stuff, but someone can deliver a malicious block, they can accept it. It can be invalid because there's an optimistic relay and there's all sorts of things that can go wrong along the pipeline. And ultimately, you want everyone's word that, you know, this is going to go through. You know, it's not realistic to get everyone's word, but we can get close to it by coordinating these actors.
00:20:40.034 - 00:21:31.830, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that makes sense. And I think, like, we started more from the, from the proposer sense, but which, like, initially makes sense because they are, like you said, Mike, they have like complete monopoly over, over the block, or almost complete monopoly, I should say. And so they can, like, promise to include something with more credibility, I believe, than like three builders. But it's true, Murat, if you include a proposal as well, that might not be a big, big issue. But the thing with, like, involving l one proposers is that you still want them to remain somewhat decentralized. And the way you do that is by not upping their duties to running like l two nodes, and by pre confirming and sequencing l two transactions. So there's a bit of a dichotomy there.
00:21:31.830 - 00:22:05.094, Speaker D: And so what we're looking at, like at Chainmount, is how can we create something that looks like bbs, that creates like an outsourceable, like a market for outsourcing. These more sophisticated, these more sophisticated duties, like sequencing, like pre confirming, but still having the l one validator, like fully commit to including whatever they promise to. And this can be done by using technologies such as Eigen layer and restaking.
00:22:06.434 - 00:22:45.774, Speaker A: Yeah. The other thing I'd like to add to that is this idea of multiplicity. There's a lot of research going on to kind of break the proposer monopoly. And when you have multiple proposers that are building or proposing a block and a slot, then you can't rely on the proposer commitment as much, or you might need a commitment from all of them, and you might still end up in a situation where you get commitments from two out of the three proposers for that slot, etcetera. So coordination still becomes a very key or fundamental issue that needs to be solved when it comes to these future proofing, these solutions.
00:22:47.594 - 00:23:01.814, Speaker C: So if I'm to summarize, just generally speaking, Morat, your design is like, we're going to get block builders and maybe proposers to join into a P two P network that you're calling NeV commit, which I like the name.
00:23:02.314 - 00:23:33.974, Speaker A: Not really. We're saying anyone who has any credibility in getting a transaction on chain, including a relay, including possibly a solver or, or searcher in some cases, and we have some bridge examples that this pertains to. We say this is an open, agnostic network to any provider of execution services, and then they can come in and perhaps there can be a scoreboard one day similar to how there's one for MeV boost, where these are the most credible actors whose commitments you want to trust, if you will.
00:23:34.874 - 00:23:48.354, Speaker C: Okay. But you have the coordination problem where in order to make the UX of this experience good, you want that commitment to happen in a short number of blocks. Like, let's just say with, well, the sooner the better, right.
00:23:48.854 - 00:23:52.654, Speaker A: In near real time, basically, you wanted that to happen as soon as possible, that you send a bit.
00:23:52.694 - 00:24:28.058, Speaker C: Yeah. And if you don't have like a big proportion of the actors involved to make that execution guarantee happen, there's a coordination problem. Until you get to that. Like, there's probably a critical threshold at which this sort of works well. Right. And then, Jonas, your solution with eigen layer restaking is you're looking to get most proposers running an AV's software. So an Eigen layer AV's, that would offer similar sort of execution guarantees, and they'd get slashed if they don't do this.
00:24:28.058 - 00:24:38.084, Speaker C: But you also have a coordination problem, in a sense, in this design, too, where we need enough of the proposers bought into this design in order for these execution guarantees to be timely.
00:24:38.244 - 00:25:46.914, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I guess it depends. Like if you want, if you want to do so, let's also maybe talk about the distinction between l one and l two preconfirmations. I think that would be interesting. So if you want an l one preconfirmation, you can only get it from the proposer that's next in line, because like, if you get it from proposer n plus two, the state might change, you might get a commitment, but it can't really be enforced. But if you're talking about l two pre confirmations, like, what you can do is have a delayed inbox and maybe a priority inbox where the priority transactions, so pre confirmation transactions are committed to, and when executed, they have priority over all of the non pre confirmed transactions, which means that essentially, like the l one proposer that is opted into this can, can give up pre information for multiple slots, and then make sure that these pre confirmations are executed before any non pre confirmed transactions, which allows them to fully manage the state that they're pre confirming over.
00:25:48.174 - 00:26:18.710, Speaker C: So just for me to push on that to help, again, the audience kind of understand. So let's just make this about issuing pre confirmations for one roll up. We'll call it like Mike's roll up. And you build an AV's where you have 10% of the stake committed to this. So, like, roughly one in every ten blocks, they are the ones that are going to be sequencing Mike's roll ups. So they're going to be committing Mike's roll ups, call it every ten blocks.
00:26:18.902 - 00:26:19.454, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:19.534 - 00:26:47.670, Speaker C: And you're saying that that network, so that that system of proposers now that have opted into this eigen layer, AV's, they could be issuing pre confirmations in real time, and then any one of the proposers of one of those blocks that doesn't honor that set of preconfirmations, they'd be slashed, and that's kind of their credible commitment. Is that roughly right?
00:26:47.702 - 00:27:27.284, Speaker D: Yes, that's right. That's exactly right. And I also want to say that, like, if your proposal is ten slots in the future, that's not necessarily the time when the l two batch will be settled, or the pre confirmed batch will be settled. Because if they commit to a, let's say they fill up a whole blob worth of pre confirmations, they can just push it to the mempool and get it included by any of the proposers or block builders ahead of their slot. So they can actually start settling faster than their own slot, which also helps with finality. It's a caveat, but I think it's maybe important to mention.
00:27:28.424 - 00:27:57.844, Speaker C: No, but basically you're saying so in Mike's roll up that's being sequenced by this AV's, you're saying that the network of the 10% of stake that's doing, that's sequencing Mike's roll up, they could just be issuing credible pre confirmations, credible commitments, two transactions in their own kind of p two p network, if you will, filling up a blob, and as soon as the blob is filled, then that gets sent to Ethereum mainnet and committed. That's what you're saying?
00:27:58.224 - 00:27:59.604, Speaker D: That's right. Yes.
00:28:00.384 - 00:28:00.896, Speaker C: Yep.
00:28:00.960 - 00:28:01.248, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:01.296 - 00:28:01.884, Speaker A: Cool.
00:28:02.544 - 00:28:32.364, Speaker B: One other thing I'd be curious. I think this presupposes the ability, something like inclusion lists, right, of proposers to be able to say like, yes, they have to have the ability to, once I make this pretty, this confirmation that I have to, I have to actually have a guarantee on the other side of things that builders will actually include these lists, include these transactions in their block. I think that's a necessary bit of infrastructure for this to work from the based pre confirmation standpoint. Jonas, correct me if I'm wrong there.
00:28:32.944 - 00:29:05.956, Speaker D: Well, if we're talking about l one pre confirmations, then yes, the proposer needs to communicate it with builders. But if we're talking about l two pre conformations, where sequencing is distinct from like PBS on L one, it's a bit different. Like the sequencer has a full rights to order transactions and doesn't actually need to communicate with builders because they can just build the l two batch and then include it in the mempool either way. I don't know if that makes sense.
00:29:05.980 - 00:30:24.438, Speaker B: I was talking about it from the l one standpoint, from the l one standpoint, because this, my understanding, right, to like maybe bring this like start to add a little bit of context outside of how this is technically going to work, is. I want to now talk about this a bit from the standpoint of this, is using Ethereum as a sequencer to add to the value proposition of Ethereum. And I feel like this is a big part of why folks are excited about this, because, one, there is frankly an element of like appreciation for ETH the asset, right? Which is like, we want Ethereum to be useful as a technology platform and that should theoretically translate into number, grow up technology for ETH. The other thing that this is supposed to help out with is you're expanding the value proposition of Ethereum, the platform, as being responsible for interop. Because Interop has been, at least from my standpoint, the largest drop ball on the ETH roll up centric roadmap. We don't really have a great solution for this. I guess one thing that never really comes up in these discussions, but is something I'm like very curious about, is what does the incentives look like for roll ups to adopt something like this? Because this is where I think people tend to immediately take the perspective of either ethereum, the network or the user and say, hey, this is great.
00:30:24.438 - 00:30:54.252, Speaker B: We get to use Ethereum for more stuff. So that's good for ETH asset. And I'm a user and I want synchronous composability across all these roll ups, right? Win win. But you're forgetting about one critical stakeholder here, which is the l two. And something that I'm starting to gain quite a bit of. This has been a really tough bd sell from some of these shared sequencing networks to onboard. And the reason is, is because their incentive actually runs counter to this, right? They see themselves as originators of order flow.
00:30:54.252 - 00:31:50.626, Speaker B: And if you're a leading l two, it's like, yeah, I understand why everyone wants to be integrated with me, but what's my incentive to share all my valuable order flow with all of you? And there's, I think, another argument that you could have on the base sequencer side of things, which is like, hey, right now, even though I'm theoretically taking on some amount of liability, issuing pre confirmations from my centralized sequencer, I'm getting quite a bit of value, right? I'm building a network effect and I'm happy to underwrite some amount of liability if it's getting me much more sticky users on my network. And it was actually a great, I saw a couple of questions on Twitter Buffalo from Jito was asking, what's the incentive from the l two standpoint to adopt these based pre confirmations? Because it does feel like you're seeding a little bit of value prop. And I would be curious, like Marat and Jonas, from the two of you, what has the reception been from the l two standpoint on all of this?
00:31:50.650 - 00:32:46.980, Speaker A: This yeah, I mean, generally l two s are very interested, but as I said, they have very distinct profiles. And the example, the real world example I'd like to give here is the EU a little bit. You did have a leading l two there, England, and they opted to stay out of the EU. But at the time, that seemed like a good decision for them. Maybe, but what you're seeing is a lot of new corporations that are spinning up, or a lot of large corporations that are creating a new headquarters are now doing it in Ireland because of ease of interoperability, if you will. If they have a worker who's in another EU country, it's very easy for that worker to migrate to the headquarters in Ireland, whereas they have to get a visa and a whole bunch of headaches if they have to go to England. I would think this would pertain to l two s as well.
00:32:46.980 - 00:33:14.646, Speaker A: Yes, there might be some very large l two that opts out of this protocol, but over time, the interoperability benefits would accrue towards the ones who are using this shared system or synchronous composability in one way or another or another. I don't think it's going to kill the other l two. I think that large l two will still continue to thrive, but I do think it'll be consequential to them that making this decision will basically be consequential at some degree.
00:33:14.800 - 00:34:12.174, Speaker D: I think there's also a point to be made. So let's for a minute presuppose that all of the execution fees in a, in a base or in a shared sequencing world also go to the roll up. So as it is right now, I think there's a case to be made that if you have more composability with other roll ups, that might actually increase execution fees on your own roll up, because, like, a lot of transactions are made possible by, like, composing multiple roll ups. So I think an argument for that can be made, but then also just more on the regulatory side. Like if you run a single sequencer, that might become a problem for you in the future, which is not great for your roll up either way. So I think from a regulatory standpoint, it might be just smart to start thinking about outsourcing this to a world war three resistant network like the ethereum l one.
00:34:14.024 - 00:34:18.364, Speaker B: All right, I'm just going to tee you up here. I know you've got some strong thoughts on this. I'd be curious.
00:34:19.064 - 00:35:53.484, Speaker C: Yeah, no, so Mike and I were joking about this beforehand because it's like the decentralization for regulatory reasons, I think is, it's a forward thinking argument, but I basically say like, the rules here are so unclear, it feels like it's hard to put that as the primary motivation for doing something. It's like right now people bring up a money transmitter problem, but circle with USDC and their CCTP protocol is already letting anybody move money between chains. I thought that was a regulatory risk for them as a money transmitter, but they apparently got comfortable with it with lawyers and whatever else. My point is that it's just, I push back pretty hard on the do this for regulatory reasons because I just think it's like the least clear argument. I do agree, though, with do this for robustness and liveness considerations to make sure something can't get shut down. That I very much agree with too. One of the arguments, if you really dig into how some of these centralized sequences are set up, I think publicly arbitrum said they run two sequencers that they could hot swap at any moment, and then they have three others geographically placed in different parts of the world.
00:35:53.484 - 00:36:09.024, Speaker C: Seems okay, but not great from a kind of robustness perspective. So that's my only right. Mike laughing because he was pushing as like decentralization for regulatory reasons is like a pet peeve of mine.
00:36:10.044 - 00:36:22.624, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I think, I think that makes sense. Yeah, maybe, maybe the liveness reason and like the composability reason is stronger, at least now, because we're not really sure what it's gonna look like in, in the future.
00:36:23.164 - 00:37:34.004, Speaker B: Yeah. One, one. Something else maybe to agree with Hart from a slightly different angle is one of the criticisms that I personally think is somewhat fair, is if you try to decentralize everything that's going on on l two s as much as it is on Ethereum, it's kind of like, what's the point where now is this a little bit of a hat on a hat situation where we already have ethereum to be extremely decentralized? If you layer another ethereum scale world war three resistant system of decentralization on top of that a, I would push folks on this podcast to explain to me how that isn't going to add cost. I feel like it has to add costs, almost definitionally. And isn't the whole purpose of having Ethereum be as decentralized as it is optimizing for solo stakers, things like that, very low hardware requirements so that we can push the limits on the layer two s and actually be a little bit more efficient because got this base layer of decentralization. So what would you say to some of these critiques that sometimes get levied at shared sequencer designs or running auctions on top of auctions that were kind of needlessly adding a lot of cost and complexity here.
00:37:36.584 - 00:38:28.024, Speaker A: I'd say I originally had this auctions on top of auctions view, not good view, but I'm increasingly seeing that in real world there's many auctions on top of auctions. And when you think about it, like settlement and tradfi is one example of this. We gave this example of visa giving you a pre confirmation, but really the money settles with the bank three days later or something. Well guess what? That bank's money actually settles with another bank two days, three days later, and that bank settles with the Fed, and a few days later, and the Fed settles with the other Fed a few days later. And it's like this whole layers of abstraction thing of the settlement. But the system works in the sense that like when I go to the store and buy something, I'm able to purchase it. And at the end of the day that's what I care about as a user.
00:38:28.024 - 00:39:15.580, Speaker A: So I feel like there might be a similar case here where maybe we do have auctions on top of auctions. Maybe a bunch of these auctions get replaced by something like a single unified auction suave, and that might be good. But at the end of the day, if we deliver the experience that users need, then I think a lot of this is just going to be running in the background and then we can let the free market figure out which one's better. And I feel the same way about l two s being a centralized sequencer or shared, I'm sorry, a decentralized sequencer. I do think there are ways to decentralize your sequencers beyond making it centralized today. You can just have two sequencers and one can do it for one day and the other could do it for another day. For example, just some basic level decentralization, and you can kind of progress from there if you wanted to.
00:39:15.580 - 00:39:33.384, Speaker A: But I do think that the inaction we've seen on this front, and kind of action being more on the research side, points to the fact that this is not a number one concern for the users that are using those chains. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what it seems to me like.
00:39:34.404 - 00:40:24.464, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think the World War three, sorry if I can add a little bit to that, I think the world War three scenario is like unrealistic in a way. It's touted as one of the big advantages, and it is in a way. But if you want like a very efficient system that can level, or that can achieve the same level of efficiency and Ux as a centralized sequencer, you're going to have to outsource things to sophisticated entities. So in the end it's not going to be completely run by, or at least in my view, by the l one proposers. There is going to be some level of outsourcing and sophistication, but it's going to be better than the status quo. That's kind of the way I think of it.
00:40:26.124 - 00:40:55.462, Speaker C: So I want to push for a second just on like what the users actually want here. Again, just playing off some of the points you guys both made here. So. Okay, first off, one question for you, mourad, because curious your thoughts on this from an l one perspective, do users really on l one s? My sense is users don't demand pre confirmations faster than like what they're currently getting. They're kind of used to this twelve second kind of confirmation time.
00:40:55.598 - 00:40:57.634, Speaker A: Depends on who by user.
00:40:58.174 - 00:41:06.474, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm saying users clicking around transactions and then metamask like that's what they've kind of gotten used to. Do you disagree with that?
00:41:07.454 - 00:41:28.794, Speaker A: I do think it would still be in a ux enhancement, but the users I'm thinking of that would need l one. Pre confirmations are actually l two sequencers who are trying to get their blobs on there and likely searchers who are, you know, doing atomic stuff or stat arb or other things. It just depends on the user class that we're talking about.
00:41:29.374 - 00:42:21.964, Speaker C: On that. I actually saw your, I watched your ETH Denver talk and I think there's an interesting and fairly nuanced point here around blobs getting confirmed on l one as blob usage goes up and latency timing games related to meV. So just to push on that point for a second, what you're concerned about, which I think is a very valid concern, is that we've introduced blobs. It's made l two s very cheap for the time being, but these blobs are huge bits of data relative to the network, and propagating them at like MEV speeds is very hard to do. Which means we now have a risk that at times of high congestion on Ethereum, blobs might get dropped or might have to pay fees equivalent to like, l one gas fees. And basically their cost advantages will go away. Is that right?
00:42:22.124 - 00:42:30.704, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty much. Basically, we've ignored this kind of dollar per kilobyte, real metric that's going on, basically.
00:42:31.204 - 00:42:50.824, Speaker C: Okay, so there's a very real point here from kind of like a MEV and cost efficiency perspective, that without something else getting figured out, blobs could actually get really expensive in times of high congestion and preconfirmations on L. One would be one way to solve that.
00:42:51.364 - 00:43:21.474, Speaker A: Yes. And really the important point there is that when you pre confirm something and everybody on the network knows it, they can transfer that data ahead of time. And that's really the disengagement of the timing game from the size of the blob. Yeah, it's not just the UX that the pre conformation provides, it's that when the knowledge is there by network actors, the network can take actions to do things that it otherwise would not be able to.
00:43:22.174 - 00:44:31.250, Speaker C: That argument makes perfect sense to me from network efficiency and like, I'll call it MeV, but it's like network efficiency type perspective. If we bring it though, back to the multi chain kind of theme of the season, things we know we need for l two s is we need fast preconfirmations, which we are currently getting from centralized sequencers. And a decentralized version of that seems better. How much better the decentralization of that centralized sequencer is. It's a topic of debate where I think the primary pros for it are liveness and regulatory concerns. And seems like the primary con would be there's probably some added cost and then the other major benefit would be some form of composability that a shared sequencer could give us. And then Mike's other point here is also like ethereum value capture, where if we make Ethereum be the central hub for sequencing everything that seems good for Ethereum value capture.
00:44:31.250 - 00:44:33.414, Speaker C: Am I missing anything here?
00:44:34.194 - 00:45:13.204, Speaker A: No, I think that's very much in line. I mean, ultimately, let's say you're at some vending machine and you want a can of coke. Like do you want to wait 12 seconds for that can of coke or do you want it now? So if we can enable for people to get their can of coke fast and as they want it, I do think that's a net positive for ethereum adoption in very kind of mainstream use cases. And chances are that vending machine might not be even aware that it's using Ethereum underneath. Maybe it's using some sort of card network that is an l three and it's rolling up to an l two that's using Ethereum, right? So yeah, I do think it's a net positive for Ethereum to be able to provide these experiences.
00:45:14.264 - 00:45:44.420, Speaker C: Yeah. My only push is that in the world we're going down on Ethereum mainnet, it's kind of like we've kind of given up on trying to have super fast transaction fee. It's just so expensive. You're maybe solving that. But like most people have already been pushed to like the l two version if they want fast speeds. That's my only point there. But all the other parts around efficiently allocating resources on the network on l one, the pre conformation aspects there make total sense to me.
00:45:44.420 - 00:45:44.916, Speaker C: Hi everyone.
00:45:44.980 - 00:46:18.988, Speaker B: Wanted to give a big shout out to today's title sponsor. Say now I want to talk to you guys a little bit about why I think say is cool from a design standpoint. Big problem that it solves for ETH devs out there and then some cool stuff that say has coming up. The reason I like say from an architecture perspective is, again, it's a very fast blockchain parallelization, all of that stuff. But say has essentially been custom building block space, which is for consumer apps, indexes. Now they have some very cool features which enable that. So twin turbo consensus, optimistic parallelization, SADB, all of this stuff allows you to reduce the time to finality, make for very, very fast transactions.
00:46:18.988 - 00:46:44.414, Speaker B: If you're building a consumer app or Dex, this is basically the blockchain for you. If you've been building the EVM, you love the EVM, but there are some restrictions about it that don't support your app. So maybe you can't do fast enough transactions or it's not parallelized. Whatever it is, you can now take all that stuff that you built. You don't have to start from scratch, and you can build it on, say, now, recently they've launched v two, but also public Devnet. So the way that you can follow that and keep up to date is go and follow, say, network on Twitter. All right, thanks, guys.
00:46:44.414 - 00:47:11.898, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. This episode is brought to you by Uniswap, delivering the best on chain trading experience, period, bar none in all of crypto. Here's how I would divide the protocol today. There's a web part, a mobile part, and an extension part. You can say goodbye to the pop up wallet extension, which is not great from a UX perspective. Now, what they've delivered is this nice, clean sidebar where you can just very easily track swaps, sign transactions, send or receive crypto anywhere. Just a huge UX improvement on the web part of it, huge improvements.
00:47:11.898 - 00:47:37.512, Speaker B: Here you can buy and sell 700 plus tokens at your price on your terms and they've got limit orders which are powered by Uniswap X. And there's gaslist. They've also got real time charts, transaction logs, pool data, project information, all this cool stuff that just really improves your UX trading on the web. And again, all this is powered by the smartest protocol in terms of Uniswap or Uniswap X. Click the link at the bottom. Uniswap extension is in alpha right now, and we'll see what you can do about getting you moved up that list. Thank you very much.

00:47:38.088 - 00:47:38.472, Speaker C: Hey everyone.
00:47:38.528 - 00:48:06.300, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Supra, delivering the freshest oracle price feeds across 50 plus blockchains. When it comes to crypto, speed and security are both critical. And luckily for y'all, Supra has you covered on both of those things. Be that for liquidation triggers, critical price levels. Whatever it is, Supra's got your back. The other great thing about Supra, they love listeners of Bell curve, so they're gonna hook you guys up with twelve months of free oracle services and verifiable randomness. They call it DVRF, centralized verifiable randomness.
00:48:06.300 - 00:48:24.436, Speaker B: So twelve months free, you just got to go to supra.com blockworks. Two more cool things about Supra, they're really secure, easy to integrate. They run on twelve times lower gas feeds than other oracles out there. So you're going to save on that as well. If you're listening. And, you know, builders that need services like Supra, you can actually refer them and get 1500 bucks in referrals.
00:48:24.436 - 00:48:38.092, Speaker B: So to get all these goodies, you just got to go to supra.com lockworks. And again, the link there is in the bottom of the show notes. Click that. So I know that I sent you. Cheers, guys. Are users going to care where their pre conformation comes from?
00:48:38.228 - 00:48:38.500, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:38.532 - 00:49:42.232, Speaker B: I think like that's maybe what you're getting at a little bit, which is like I, as a user, I place some transact, like some swap on a Dex, and I'm either going to get. Actually, there is one source of precomp, one potential pre comfort that we haven't talked about here, which is actually Amazon, in your example, Marat, which is the app, the app can issue these pre conformations. And ultimately I'm sort of an app maxi. My assumption is that when we talk about users right now interacting with Ethereum or roll up or a sequence, all that's going to be invisible. The only emotional connection in the endgame is going to be with apps. Actually, there's probably a very likely outcome that the relevant pre comfort from the perspective of the user is the application. Guess what if I had to like push a little bit in terms of like when I hear this like base sequencing talk and like, yes, I understand because I have a rough understanding, 5% of what you guys understand, but I have a rough understanding of like the network design and the actual assurances that you get from a pre conformation issued by an l one proposer as opposed to a sequencer or an app.
00:49:42.232 - 00:49:58.614, Speaker B: But is a user going to understand that and are they going to care? And I think maybe, Hart, that was behind your question about like, we've already pushed a lot of people off of l one. They're already getting these pre confirmations from sequencers. Like where is the pressing need for them to get adopted by l one? Pre conformations?
00:50:00.634 - 00:50:57.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I would say ultimately, like if we go back to the Amazon example, like, you do care if it's Amazon, and if Amazon gives you the word, then you're fine, right? If there were some other entities that Amazon said, hey look, you know, Johnnydelivery.com is telling you it'll be there, you might be like, I'm not so sure about that, but you'll probably piggyback off of Amazon said Johnnydelivery.com is fine. So then it must be right. But you know, ultimately the destination or I guess the source of your pre confirmation does matter from credibility standpoint. But yeah, I agree that apps are in a great position to deliver this for their apps. Who've actually talked to an app recently, who wants to utilize map commit pre confirmations for their app, basically for their app, they would be the only ones who can credibly issue pre confirmations and if not, the transaction would revert when it comes to that app.
00:50:57.330 - 00:51:13.564, Speaker A: So there are already mechanisms that DAp developers are thinking about to do their own pre confirmations. So yeah, this is a modular world. So everyone should be able to give the user experience that they want for their users.
00:51:14.344 - 00:51:59.594, Speaker D: Yeah, I think applications giving out preconfirmations that should also work, but they must collaborate with people further down the stack to be able to provide credible pre conformations. For example, the example from Roth, they need to have some sort of assurances that they can actually execute the pre confirmation. And on that, I've seen a lot of talk recently about like application specific sequencing, where an application sequences all transactions for their specific state. And in that case, like the application would be in a very good position to give out pre confirmation. So yeah, maybe related further, further research.
00:52:00.254 - 00:52:46.734, Speaker B: I've got a question on this is going to sound a bit like a technical question, but I do think it's pretty relevant. Is one of the, in most of the implementations that I've sort of seen sketched out about this, there has to be some sort of pre confirmation tip, right? Consider this like the priority, like analogous to the priority fee that users might pay interacting with ethel one. You have to play it, pay a tip to the issuer of your pre comfort. What does the, how, how does that pricing work? And I actually see challenges from the persif, uh, from the perspective of like if you're a builder issuing that pre comfort versus if you're an l one validator, the challenge that I see on the builder side, I think you might have an answer to this. Actually, that's pretty cool answer. But the challenge is, it actually runs counter to, it's kind of like the difference between ex post and an ex anti auction.
00:52:46.814 - 00:52:47.030, Speaker D: Right?
00:52:47.062 - 00:53:12.848, Speaker B: Like what we see in MeV on l one is builders want to wait as long as they possibly can before they actually end up submitting their block. Because the longer you wait, the more information that you have and the more profitably you can build a block, you want to drag out the time that you're running this auction. So if you, how are these builders then pricing? Right. Pre confirmations that get issued like, I don't know, half a second into the block.
00:53:12.936 - 00:53:13.160, Speaker D: Right.
00:53:13.192 - 00:53:24.324, Speaker B: And isn't that kind of against their interest? I think you know the answer on the builder side, but actually, why don't you answer that? And then I got a separate question for the l one proposer side of this.
00:53:24.944 - 00:54:22.292, Speaker A: Sure. You know, there's been an uncomfortable truth when it comes to pre confirmations and that, you know, if you users want as soon as possible pre confirmation, so as soon as they send a tip or transaction, they want the pre confirmation, and then it's in the best interest of the builder or proposer to wait until the end of the slot and then to give all of those pre confirmations. So we've come up with a decay mechanism on Mav. Commit to kind of combat this. Basically, as soon as, let's say you bid one ETH for your pre confirmation bid, it starts decaying in real time. And then there's multiple entities that are competing to give you a commitment, right? So basically, if there are two builders and one gives you a commitment right away, and the other waits till halfway through the slot, now the builder who gave it to you first essentially has a monetary economic advantage on what their block value might be. So they're competing and they're incentive to give it to you as soon as possible.
00:54:22.292 - 00:54:44.384, Speaker A: Now, this may still lead in situations where your tip isn't just not high enough and you're not getting a commitment, or you're trying to get a pre confirmation on a very contentious state that no one's going to really give it to, and then you have to deal with that. But when it comes to pricing these things, I can go into pricing a little bit more, but maybe I'll pause there to allow Jonas to opine.
00:54:46.524 - 00:55:38.870, Speaker B: Well, I have a slightly different question for Jonas, which is, all right, you. So this is challenge from the perspective of the builder, because it runs up against the natural incentives of an auction and pricing. But ultimately, builders are really sophisticated entities, right? They've got a ton of money, they've got a lot of expertise. We'll figure out some kind of way to appropriately price this. I guess my question from the standpoint of an l one proposer is how is an l one proposer, maybe more specifically? Well, even a really professional staker, like a course one or a figment, like, their internal core competency is running nodes, right? It's not like auction pricing. So how are they going to price this? But then that extends even further to your average solo staker, who's, you know, theoretically be some guy living in the woods somewhere running his raspberry PI. Like, how's he going to be like, oh, yep, I know how to price this auction.
00:55:38.870 - 00:55:39.774, Speaker B: And.
00:55:39.934 - 00:55:40.206, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:40.230 - 00:55:41.794, Speaker B: So how is that all going to work?
00:55:42.404 - 00:56:48.764, Speaker D: Right? So, no, that's a great question. I just want to reiterate that we're not like, the way that we want to build this is allow l one proposers to delegate all of these very sophisticated duties to sophisticated actors through something that looks like Mev boost. Right? So in the end, what. What they're doing is providing block space, like guaranteed block space to allow anyone else to kind of sequence and pre confirm, etcetera. So in the end, they don't really have to do all of these sequencing and pricing because we agree that they probably can't. Like, maybe there are some stakers, like Horus one, you said that could do it, but then you really, you run into the problem of solo stakers not being able to do that and the centralization vectors that that creates. So in the end, I think on this question, it looks very similar, like Murat, where builders will probably be the entities that are being delegated to, and they're in a position to prize this in a much better way.
00:56:49.304 - 00:57:50.144, Speaker B: Okay, then if that is the answer, then I have a question for this entire call, which is why basically, the way that I would look at this, and this is sort of a high level perspective that I have on blockchains. Like, you can trace the difference in every l one blockchain to what the role of the proposer should be in terms of its hardware requirements, what it's required to perform. Like this is what we expect of the, of the proposer's role. I think broadly, you could interpret pre conformations. Is Ethereum starting to walk back some of its initial design philosophy of pushing complexity to the edges? And initially the design philosophy for Ethereum was we want this to be very like, we want the l one proposer to be super simple, not very complicated, so we can optimize for solo stakers. And the way that at least I'm interpreting this is I will actually, maybe we want them to do a little bit more than we initially thought. And we're not going to put that in protocol, we're not going to make it like, we're not going to include it in a hard fork or something like that, but they can opt in via restaking.
00:57:50.144 - 00:58:15.024, Speaker B: But then also you're increasing your principal agent problem by just delegating it to a builder. And like I'm starting to question, like if ultimately we adopt pre confirmations, we're asking our l one proposers to do more than they're currently doing today, but our l one proposers aren't set up to do that, so then they just end up delegating it to a builder. Why don't we just change the spec on our l one proposers and just make them bigger and beefier.
00:58:15.524 - 00:59:17.514, Speaker D: Well, I think actually there might be like a slight research trend that's pointing towards that, like with execution tickets, with the separation of beacon chain proposals and like execution proposal. Yeah, I think that's a distinction they made. Execution tickets. Exactly. And so what it's pointing to is that you want a very unsophisticated, decentralized validator set to be able to enforce censorship, resistance and properties like these through the means of like inclusion lists. But in the end, since we're already outsourcing, like sophisticated execution to builders, et cetera, we might as well kind of put it inside of the protocol and separate execution proposers from like beacon proposers, and the beacon proposers would uphold censorship, resistance would keep basically checks on the execution proposers. Whereas they would be able to fulfill any sort of like very sophisticated tasks.
00:59:17.514 - 00:59:38.714, Speaker D: And yeah, execution tickets is one form of that, but I think there are many. Like there's a post on, on Rainbow staking, for example, from, from Barnaby, from the EF that I think is super interesting. And it also outlines a more general design of execution tickets, which is super interesting. Don't know if that answers your question, but.
00:59:40.214 - 01:00:33.054, Speaker C: Well, Mike. Yeah, like, I like it, though. And I actually, Jonas, I think I agree with this approach where I think it's okay to have a network where if certain actors go offline, there's like a degradation of service. Like, things get a bit worse, but they don't stop. And so my take on kind of what you're saying here, and even your proposal is you're saying the builder of these, forget the term you're using, but like the builder of these complicated entities, it's being outsourced from the proposer that's running this AV's. And you don't want those guys to go offline, but if they did, the network will still keep operating. And I think that seems like a useful design principle in the same way that you want, let's say, equity market.
01:00:33.054 - 01:00:41.694, Speaker C: If we do make some tradfi examples, if equity markets like if citadel goes offline, they don't break it just maybe gets less efficient for a bit.
01:00:42.354 - 01:00:45.074, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good analogy.
01:00:45.114 - 01:01:15.384, Speaker B: Yeah. One thing to also add here, just in terms of sort of, there is the possibility of decentralizing the builder role, which is being worked on sort of by like suave. I know Vitalik has talked about this quite a bit, but I think there are actual credible, very legitimate attempts at decentralizing that role over a period of time. It's going to be tricky, going to take some time. But I think you could also look at the assumption that builders are always going to be the centralized entities as not necessarily being accurate either.
01:01:16.244 - 01:02:04.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we use commitments to kind of have this happen out of protocol. So for blob pre confirmations, for example, we think the relay is in the best position to do it. Pricing them is not as sophisticated. You don't have to kind of be aware of Defi transactions, and then your pre confirmed blobs can become an inclusion list for the builder. And then the final block is technically built by the block builder, but it had rules enforced by others across the ecosystem where you could proxy a decentralized builder. In this way, you can act by coordinating these actors, you can achieve these goals a little sooner. But yes, ultimately we do need ground up designs that are decentralized by foundation.
01:02:06.174 - 01:02:43.644, Speaker B: Gents, we're in our closing minutes here. I suppose if we wanted to bookend the conversation here and leave listeners with, I don't know any sort of thoughts about this is the multi chain season. And the thing that we wanted an explanation of what pre confirmations are, maybe within the context of how it's changing the role of the l one proposal. How could potentially solve the interop challenges that we've seen on l two s. We've indirectly talked about Mev. We probably could have done a whole episode just on the MEV implications beyond this as well. But if you wanted to leave listeners with one thoughters, bookend the conversation that we've had today, what do you want to leave them with?
01:02:46.264 - 01:03:23.014, Speaker A: I would say pre confirmations are real. They're coming sooner than you think. They're going to enhance not just ux, but usability of the entire ecosystem. For most of the actors, if not all, it's just a foundational primitive, I would say, that's going to enable all sorts of design spaces. I mean, there was a workshop done by flashbots where I talked about a potential of a real time Dex that's powered by pre conformations. There's just many new design verticals that are enabled by this new primitive. A very exciting time to be in ethereum, I would say.
01:03:24.154 - 01:03:49.994, Speaker D: Yeah, I think maybe what I would say is that base sequencing and base pre conformations, the advantages that it has maybe over shared sequencing that we didn't discuss in this call, is also l one, l two, interoperability. I just want to say that that's also a huge selling point, I think, for roll ups to opt into this, and I think it will enable some very cool, very cool features.
01:03:51.854 - 01:03:52.674, Speaker C: Awesome.
01:03:53.254 - 01:04:26.474, Speaker B: Well, guys, we really, really appreciate the two of you coming on here and educating our audience about this. It's a super interesting topic. And when you search, which I often do, for things on YouTube or Spotify, there's really not that much content out there about preconfirmation. Hopefully this can be a little bit of a foundational explainer for folks. Murat or Jonas, if folks want to find out more about the work that you guys are doing, or follow you personally, what's the best way for just people to stay up to date with this and find out more about what you guys working on?
01:04:27.054 - 01:04:35.594, Speaker A: Primav XYZ, I would say, and our twitters also. But yeah, if you're curious enough, you can very easily scour the map from there.
01:04:36.374 - 01:04:50.894, Speaker D: Yeah, it's chainmount IO for us. And we're planning to release some posts also about base pre confirmation soon to make the things that people can read a bit more interesting as well.
01:04:51.314 - 01:04:56.626, Speaker B: Awesome, fellas, thank you so much. This was a blast. We really appreciate it.
01:04:56.730 - 01:04:57.338, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:04:57.426 - 01:05:12.964, Speaker B: All right, man. That was a great episode. I was a little, I'll be honest, I was a little nervous going in. When you talk about something as technical as pre conformations, it's always a bit risky, but I feel like we did a good job of getting into some of the details but also zooming out as well and given some context.
01:05:13.504 - 01:05:58.334, Speaker C: Yeah. The thing I wanted to push on is that pre conformations do exist. I agree with Morat's definition very much of this credible commitment, this credible heads up, but you're getting that today from centralized sequencers where the credibility is just their reputation and the fact that they want their token price to go up. They want to be the leading l two. All that other stuff, optimism, lying about a pre confirmation would be really, really, really bad for them. And so I think, first of all, I think Morad's push for pre confirmations on l one, I am a little bit skeptical about whether users care about that, and I don't think they really do. I think anyone that wants a faster confirmation is going to an l two today.
01:05:58.334 - 01:06:20.528, Speaker C: But I do think his points around how it's going to make Ethereum better from a network efficiency perspective. And there's some fairly technical bits around blobspace, which just made l two s so much cheaper, actually getting very expensive without things like what he's working on. I thought that was a really interesting point, but that's like quite in the weeds, too.
01:06:20.616 - 01:06:49.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought there were a couple. So I'm in complete agreement with you, by the way, on. I personally think there, this is obviously going to be a technical discussion where you know who. There are different assumptions that go into a pre conformation based on who's acting as the pre confer. Right. It's not the same to get a pre conformation from a builder versus an l one proposer versus a sequencer versus an app. But personally, I just don't think 99% of users are going to understand that or care very much is the, is the honest reality.
01:06:49.324 - 01:07:32.554, Speaker B: But I do. Well, so, but one of the, you know, one of the pushbacks that I think he gave that was good is when we were talking about, you know, is this just a bit of a hat on a hat situation? And are we recreating a lot of the decentralization on l two of Ethereum that we have on one. And is it auctions on top of auctions? I think his point was super valid and something that I've waffled on, but I'm ultimately trending towards that, which is like, if you look at the system of how anything works, like there are many layers to it and it does feel really complicated. And you know, it's very tempting sometimes to look at Ethereum and be like, why does that have to be so complicated? It's like, well, it's a global network, it's a global computing network, and these things do have many layers and different auctions that get run and it is very complicated. And I thought that intuitively sat really well and made a lot of sense there.
01:07:33.694 - 01:08:16.294, Speaker C: I agree, but I think it actually argues both ways. So both these guys are facing. So when we talk about pre conformations for decentralizing l two s, it's like a shared sequence or a base sequencer type concept. And you have this incredibly difficult coordination problem of how are you going to get these different l two networks to opt in to the same, I'm going to call it the same concept, the same shared sequencer, the same source of preconfirmations. And that coordination problem, I think is really, really tricky. And you alluded to it too, where I think there's a lot of reasons why l two s don't want to give this up. And I think we can go a bit deeper into that.
01:08:16.294 - 01:08:54.758, Speaker C: So when Maurat was talking about like, hey, yeah, there are auctions on top of auctions. And like, you look at traditional finance and when money moves from a to b, it goes through like seven different intermediaries. I'd say like half. The reason why that's true, though, is because there was some path dependency around how traditional finance got built. There were sort of existing systems in place and people that didn't want to let go of control and all these other things that said, hey, okay, no, no, I'm not going to, I'm not going to agree to this other better standard. You've got to like use my thing. And then somebody hacked together another auction on top of auction to make it work.
01:08:54.758 - 01:09:29.184, Speaker C: So I kind of think that point argues both ways where I very much agree that there's going to be these layers of complexity. But because we have a number of entities that want control and don't want to give up certain rights, I'm not so sure how many of them are going to opt into some concept of shared sequencer to deliver shared pre confirmations. I'm not really sure how that's going to happen unless the opportunity cost for not doing so is pretty huge.
01:09:29.804 - 01:10:09.040, Speaker B: I totally agree with you. I think time and time again, we've just undervalued this incentive, which is just natural to humanity. Capitalism at large is like, I want to do my thing. I want to create value in my little area, and it makes a lot of sense. And I think this is where sometimes the folks that are very focused on network design miss this is, if you're looking at it from the perspective of Ethereum the network, and Ethereum the asset, and by the way, bitcoin as well, Solana as well, cosmos as well. Like, people tend to really look at it from the perspective of the network, but all of the users and the entrepreneurs and the app developers are looking at it from their own perspective. And those things don't necessarily go one to one.
01:10:09.040 - 01:10:32.976, Speaker B: And I think because, again, we're so early and because so many of these systems haven't been built yet, again, we focus a lot on, like, how is this actually going to work? As opposed to maybe this isn't really a technical problem at all and it's not a question of how it could work. Right. We have the technology, it'd be really easy to make this work. It's a question of how do you align the social incentives? And that, I think is where we need to push more on, because that's the big challenge.
01:10:33.000 - 01:11:01.094, Speaker C: Yeah, so on. Yeah. No, yes, that I agree with. We're in agreement there. Based sequencing, the idea of Ethereum being the sequencer for every l two that connects to it, and having some network of shared sequencing where pre conformations come from a single concept, a single mechanism that everybody is bought into. I like that idea. I think that's cool.
01:11:01.094 - 01:11:47.878, Speaker C: I'm not sure it's going to happen. And so Morad also made the analogy of the EU, right? Right. So the EU grouped together to have shared market, shared immigration, all these good things, and then England dropped out. Right. And I think the analogy for l two s, I think the biggest value prop to opting into some sort of shared sequencing or based sequencing would be composable interoperability. And this would basically be the idea of being able to do a flash loan between two l two s. I'll use that as my concrete example.
01:11:47.878 - 01:12:10.542, Speaker C: And then my push would be, okay, that would be cool. And I want that to exist. But is that a big enough need? Is there a big enough need for that? That these l two s will give up some degree of their sovereignty and some degree of their own sequencing fees and control and all that in order to enable that, and that I'm very unsure of.
01:12:10.718 - 01:13:06.618, Speaker B: Okay, I agree with you. But here's one big wild card that could really influence whether or not this gets critical mass is lido. And the reason why that has Lido has such an impact is because, because of the incredibly high percentage of Ethereum proposers that they've got on their network. And if you were to do, if one of these either Primev or Chainbound or whatever, were to do some very savvy bd work with Lido and get that entire proposer set to opt into this, suddenly right there you have a really large percentage of l one proposers. And then once you look at it from that standpoint, it's like, well, maybe I can get this massive percentage of l one proposers to opt into this thing, and then suddenly I do actually have this very credibly neutral. You could build a lot of stuff with that. You could build an exchange, you could build whatever, then that's a really compelling value proposition.
01:13:06.618 - 01:13:19.410, Speaker B: I think so. I do sort of think if you were, if someone were to figure out how to make that work, that could be pretty interesting, maybe to give someone an idea about that.
01:13:19.442 - 01:14:24.754, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. No, if you get Lido and Coinbase, if you get like something like that to opt into base sequencing, and there is a place here where you get good vibes from doing this too. If you get all the intelligentsia and Ethereum pushing for this, and you get the overall ETH, whales and ethought leaders to really push for this outcome, I think there's a chance, there's a possibility. But the other approach here, what I think is probably more realistic, is you do have three ecosystems, three main ecosystems. You're probably going to have four ecosystems where you're going to have all of the optimism super chains, having some sense of shared sequencing ish, like some way of doing this and some decentralized pre conformations coming from that system. You're going to have the same thing with arbitrum, and you're going to have polygon and their egg layer doing something similar. But those are going to be separate islands, if you will.
01:14:24.754 - 01:14:42.942, Speaker C: And then the fourth would be everybody else that wants to do base sequencing. Or maybe you get one of the three other ecosystems to also do basic sequencing. I kind of feel like if I were forced to make a prediction, that's kind of how it would end up. We'll see.
01:14:43.118 - 01:15:08.918, Speaker B: I like that prediction. Hart, what did you make of. I'm conscious of this because I feel like I make this point quite a bit. But that point of. Did you agree with that whole point about we're sort of redefining the role of the l one proposer? We're asking them to do this was originally the observation here was the way that Ethereum and Cosmos thinks about their validators are totally different. Right. In Ethereum, you're trying to make them dumb and simple and unopinionated.
01:15:08.918 - 01:16:07.124, Speaker B: And in cosmos, it's literally like, what can your validator do for you? Ask them to do more stuff. And it feels like we're actually swinging a little bit back more cosmos here with the important caveat and stipulation that we're not requiring the Ethereum proposer set to opt into this, but again, we're sort of tipping the balance of incentives that I think pretty strongly encourages them. And Justin Drake did address this in his original piece that he wrote, which is exactly what Jonas said, which is that you can delegate your ability to issue pre confirmations, do all that pricing, et cetera, to builders? And I guess I'm still wrapping my own head around what I really think about this. But what do you think about this changing role of the l one proposer? Is it a problem that we're asking them to do these things, but then just delegating it to a builder? So it's kind of like, why are we even doing that at all then? I mean, what did you think about that whole perspective?
01:16:07.744 - 01:17:26.834, Speaker C: So I actually think it makes sense, and I think it's happening with Eigen Lair anyways. So, Mike, I'm pretty sure you're going to do a season on Eigen lair, and you should because it's fascinating, but like, the whole restaking thing means we're already asking all of these additional asks of proposers, and that's coming. And I think the idea of, well, if I'm now a proposer, a solo staker or whatever else, I opt in some additional set of commitments that I make in my restaking kind of contract. And where I do, I trust some other builder to tell me to do the work for me. And then I just like sign off on it, maybe. And maybe that's actually like a totally fair way to, in a sense, get the best of both worlds, where you can have highly sophisticated actors doing really complicated work with like really high hardware requirements and network requirements and da da da da da. But it still gets kind of checkpointed or proposed by a decentralized set, actually, in a certain sense, seems like a pretty elegant way where you get this sort of common community of Ethereum with some very high degree of decentralization.
01:17:26.834 - 01:17:43.034, Speaker C: Well, having all the advantages of the cosmos ecosystem, where like, what did my validator do for me? You can kind of make all those asks. They just sort of get outsourced, maybe more complicated, but I think it does. It's a pretty interesting design.
01:17:43.454 - 01:18:09.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is too. And I actually think it's. I think it's. I agree that it's inevitable that it's already happening with Eigen Lair. There was also, I'll plug another really interesting episode of Uncommon Core that Hasu and John Charbonneau did with Ansgar. And shoot, I'm blanking on his other name. I'm really sorry, but it was a great episode on the sort of future of staking on Ethereum.
01:18:09.222 - 01:18:54.570, Speaker B: And at the same time that we're starting to question, like, the role of what an l one proposal ultimately should look like, there are a lot of big questions being asked around ETH, monetary policy and issuance. And if we were to target a reduced percentage of stake today, like, how does that impact the validator set? I really do think there are some really fascinating questions going on. People are starting to question again what the role of the l one proposer should be. And I don't know, I am a broken record on this, so I understand listeners. Belkov, you're just like my. Just shut up saying this. But it just really does feel like we're converging around a similar perspective on what a proposer should look like across many different networks, albeit with really different flavors.
01:18:54.570 - 01:19:33.506, Speaker B: And I would say it does feel like it's a meaningful distinction to me. We were talking about this a little bit off air, that the basic required specs for an Ethereum proposer is still extremely lightweight, so that if, you know, God forbid, there was some sort of crackdown, that maybe we lose some functionality, but it's still, like, robust to a crackdown. And I really do think that's one of the things that Ethereum main chain has over some of its beefier competitors, like the celestials or solanas of the world. Like, I think the censorship resistant properties are stronger on Ethereum, the network. So I don't know, I think, just.
01:19:33.530 - 01:19:41.150, Speaker C: To correct you before Celestia people hit you in the replies, Celestia does have really low hardware requirements, but I know what you meant, right? I know you meant Celestia.
01:19:41.222 - 01:20:18.322, Speaker B: Celestia has low hardware requirements for their light nodes. They have really beefy validators on the, on the main chain. But personally, just, just for celestial folks out there listening, I actually think that's probably the most elegant design. Like, I'm a huge fan of that. It's like, it's basically what we're saying. That's what we're asking here is like, hey, maybe to like really zoom out here for a second, which dangerous to do right at the end is to say, hey, like, we want applications to run, but we don't want ultimately to be beholden to like one centralized actor that does that. What we're really asking is for a committee instead of one centralized entity doing an action.
01:20:18.322 - 01:20:58.272, Speaker B: We want a committee of different actors to do that action. Like, what should those committee members ultimately end up looking like? One way to still maintain a high amount of functionality while asking a committee to do a thing is to do what Ethereum is doing. The base requirement is very low. A certain subset of that committee is going to opt into doing being beefier. Celestia bakes that in and says, hey, actually mostly we're just going to assume that these are beefier, but we have this nice thing called light nodes and data availability sampling that obviates some of the risks around having fewer beefiers nodes. It's just like, this is what I mean by convergence. It's all different flavors of the same thing.
01:20:58.272 - 01:21:01.872, Speaker B: And so, yeah, that's kind of, and.
01:21:01.888 - 01:21:12.684, Speaker C: We like Ethereum's flavor generally. I think it's pretty good. And I think it's actually like all this stuff is pretty good for value accretion to ETH too, which is a point I think you keep making. And it's a good one.
01:21:12.984 - 01:21:27.210, Speaker B: Totally. I also think that the. I think ETH is already kind of won in a sense. Like maybe this is a pretty controversial opinion. I think it could almost just sit on its hand and let the liquidity and sort of network effects take hold. I know we got to run here. Heart.
01:21:27.210 - 01:21:43.574, Speaker B: This was a really fun one. This next episode, we're going to be talking with Kyle Simone, specifically about network effects. I got to shout out c node, who keeps poking fun at podcasters who are asking where does value accrue in the modular stack cnod? We're making this one for you, my man. We're making this one just for you.
