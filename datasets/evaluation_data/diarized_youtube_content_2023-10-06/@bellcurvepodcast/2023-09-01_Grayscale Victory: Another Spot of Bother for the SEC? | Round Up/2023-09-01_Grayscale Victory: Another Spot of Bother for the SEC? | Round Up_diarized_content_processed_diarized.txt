00:00:00.090 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co hosts today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.730 - 00:00:34.758, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's, one and two, vance and Yano. All the fellows are back. Welcome back.
00:00:34.844 - 00:00:35.750, Speaker A: The boys are back.
00:00:35.820 - 00:01:16.046, Speaker B: You guys just want to launch right into GBTC. This was a big week, big legal victory week for crypto overall, continuing a trend, I think that was set by the XRP decision. And we actually had two big wins this week. One was GBTC and the other was Uniswap, which flew a little bit more under the radar, but I think was almost equally as important. So maybe just to kick things off with the GBTC decision. So the high level is the US Court of Appeals struck down the SEC's denial of a bitcoin spot ETF. So what this doesn't mean is that we're immediately getting a GBTC bitcoin ETF and that conversion is definitely going to be successful.
00:01:16.046 - 00:02:24.474, Speaker B: But what it does mean is that the SEC now has to go back and review Grayscale's proposal again with the Court's ruling in Was. What makes this a win, I think, for crypto, is that the SEC was, or the Court rather was incredibly specific about the rationale for why the SEC had to go back and review the and, you know, from my understanding, not a legal expert here, but they really boxed them in. And in particular, what they focused on was the link in between the Spot and the futures markets. So that close link they pointed out in kind of plain English, something that I think many people had been thinking about all along, which is how does it make any sense in the world to have a Futures ETF approved, but not a Spot ETF? There's a great line somewhere in here, which is that the futures are derivative of the Spot market after all. So it feels very unlikely at this point that the SEC is going to appeal. I guess that would go to the Supreme Court, but that seems unlikely. There are still avenues open for the SEC to deny a Spot ETF, but what do you guys make of all this?
00:02:24.512 - 00:03:13.660, Speaker C: Spot bitcoin ETF is coming at some point. Just depends. Just this is breaking news that will be old by the time this is listened to, but they just delayed on Wisdom Tree and Galaxy, so they're not just coming out and approving these. And I think the timelines that James Cipherd and Eric Beltunas from Bloomberg say are jan 120. 24. So it's going to be a minute, but it's positive and it was 30, and I think it was a Trump judge, an Obama judge, and a Biden judge, and he lost three. And what's interesting kind of outside of that is just if you look at the recent dissents into SEC settlements, especially the NFT one that was think this week, there's five commissioners on the SEC.
00:03:13.660 - 00:03:50.070, Speaker C: You have two of them. It used to only just be Hester Pierce kind of issuing a letter of dissent against the different kind of judgments that the SEC is putting on these people that they're going after. And so it's like the courts, it's also like the commission. And you only need three out of five for something to kind of for something to get approved by the SEC. So you already have two. And I think this case is just kind of like another it may be the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of, okay, now you probably have three SEC commissioners that are saying this just isn't reasonable anymore, which it isn't. And you saw that in the court opinion.
00:03:50.810 - 00:04:51.078, Speaker D: Yeah. Only thing I'd add, James Seaford and Eric from Bloomberg, they up their odds, I believe, to 75% chance that a spot bitcoin ETF gets approved in 2023 and a 95% chance that it gets approved in 2024. So I think it's really financial gravity at this point as to what direction we're going. What does that do actually to bitcoin markets? It's probably positive, to say the least, in terms of where capital will ultimately be flowing. I did see some interesting takes. What the ports hammered on was the difference and the manufactured difference between spot and futures. And really what this ruling says, as we've been talking about is you have to go back and tell us another reason, or you have to go back and give us a different reason as to why you're denying the bitcoin ETFs.
00:04:51.078 - 00:05:54.880, Speaker D: The other way that James Seifert was talking about it is he you know, they could also just go back and rescind the bitcoin futures ETF approval. So, once again, this is not done. I don't think that's going to happen, frankly, but there is still a lot of stuff that's going to have to go through for us to be able to get to that spot bitcoin ETF. The other thing which I think is also starting to pile up is what's going to happen with Ethereum. And I think a week ago, or maybe ten days ago, there was a Bloomberg article that talked about the fact that the SEC is apparently open to approving an E futures ETF, which I think would be massively bullish for a number of reasons. Number one, obviously the capital formation that happens when you have an ETF like that, no matter whether or not it's futures or spot. But what it also implies is that it would be the first time that you have the blessing of the SEC around Ethereum, because it would effectively mean that it's not a security.
00:05:54.880 - 00:06:04.010, Speaker D: So I think that if that goes through and that would happen sometime in mid October that is also one of the most bullish things for the entire industry.
00:06:04.090 - 00:06:28.050, Speaker B: I just wanted to give a quick shout out to Permissionless. This is the biggest and best conference in all of DFI. It's the one that we do with Bankless, who's a great partner for us. Last year we had almost 7000 people there in West Palm Beach. We are moving this year to Austin, Texas from September 11 through the 13th. And if you are a listener of Bell Curve, any of these last five seasons, this conference is basically custom made for you. We're going to be talking about Liquid Staking, the theme of this season.
00:06:28.050 - 00:06:45.934, Speaker B: We've got a bunch of great panels on mev. If you listen to the App chain thesis. We've got a bunch of Cosmos folks out there in full force. We're talking about the converging architecture of Salana, the roll up space in ETH and Cosmos. So I would love to see all of you there and to reward you for being such great listeners. To bell curve. You get a special 30% off code.
00:06:45.934 - 00:06:57.482, Speaker B: It's Bell Curve 30 that'll get you 30% off tickets. Click the link in the show notes and then head over to the Permissionless site and make sure that you get your ticket today. Again. That is Bell curve 30. Click the link in the show notes.
00:06:57.546 - 00:07:19.154, Speaker A: So the three pass forward right now is so we don't have a bitcoin ETF right now. The three pass forward are one. It kind of depends on how hard Gary Gensler wants to fight, right? So one is he really wants to fight. He wants to go to the mat. So they have 45 days to figure out whether or not they want to appeal or not. That's one option. Second option is they don't appeal this, but they come at them from a different angle.
00:07:19.154 - 00:07:38.574, Speaker A: They can't use the argument of, hey, this is not a market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation. But there's a different reason we want to say no. Or the third is that they were sin the futures. It does feel like the difference between now. So the first bitcoin, ETF got introduced, what, ten years ago with the Winklevoss twins. It feels like the difference not that.
00:07:38.612 - 00:07:43.150, Speaker D: Long, but I think it was seven years, march 20, 827 or 17.
00:07:44.050 - 00:08:12.554, Speaker A: You sure? All right, whatever. However long it was ago, like several years ago, the biggest difference is that BlackRock's now in the game, I think. And now there's like a real player from Wall Street, I think, who's not Wisdom Tree and something like that. I think the appetite is there, but also the political influence is there now. So I don't see them rescinding this future's ETP. I don't know what you guys think of that. About that.
00:08:12.672 - 00:08:53.800, Speaker D: No, that's more of like a straw man example. Of like that is possible, but it's like 0% chance of he believe that's going to happen. Yeah. The other part on that second point about going back and kind of figuring out a different angle to come at know the SEC has also been really difficult when it comes to custodians and they have this new custodian rule that they're working through the system for registered investment advisors. So it is possible that that could be the new angle of attack. And if they were to come at it from a different angle, I think that would be the most likely. One.
00:08:57.610 - 00:09:54.966, Speaker B: Of the other differences though, Jason, even in between 2017 or whenever the Winkle Five first applied for that Bitcoin ETF is the market is definitely much larger right now. And a lot of the original argument that the SEC focused on and why I think there was a futures ETF allowed before a spot is market surveillance. And it's much easier for them to conduct their definition of market surveillance if there's a futures that's trading on the CME as opposed to Bitcoin, that trades on all these different offshore exchanges. And partially some of those challenges have been solved because there are better surveillance technologies now. And you do have this sort of US infrastructure in the form of what Coinbase has built out since 2017, right? So you have this kind of nasdaq Coinbase partnership which allows that to be possible. The other thing is the political will thing I wouldn't underestimate as well either. And I think one of the we can get into the Uniswap ruling as well, but it does feel like there's a tide that's turned.
00:09:54.966 - 00:10:56.634, Speaker B: Jim Chanos talks about this as well within the context of fraud. And I think the analogy applies here, which is when everything is ripping up, there is zero demand out there to get to the bottom of frauds, right, because everyone's making money and it's like, don't fuck up the money, but as soon as everything turns around, everyone wants to know why. So the demand for people to get to the bottom of fraud and bad activities is just much higher. And it feels like a couple of months ago the demand for people to find accountability for why they were losing money was at its highest and we've moved past that point. So I think that was the point of the SEC's highest demand political will and that's moving back in the opposite direction now. And there was actually an article from the Wall Street Journal, there were a couple articles that came out this week, but this one comes from the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, which is significant in my opinion. The title of this article is the SEC Strikes Out Again on Crypto with Grayscale.
00:10:56.634 - 00:11:26.710, Speaker B: And there's some choice language here. This is coming directly again from the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. It's a big deal. I think it feels like the tide is turning to me. So little anticlimactic conclusion there. But I think in the court of public opinion, the SEC is finally looking to start like it's losing. And a lot of the rationale that they used to target crypto firms wasn't actually as solid as they originally thought.
00:11:26.860 - 00:11:58.126, Speaker D: I think what we're going to hear next, not necessarily next, but what I think we're going to start to hear at some point soon here is effectively mission accomplished and the SEC is going to say, we did it, we regulated it, it's now safe, we're fine with it. BlackRock is leading the charge. They're not going to let Gracia get converted before BlackRock gets approved. But we've got traditional guys, Wall Street involved and I think they're going to memory hole the losses and basically turn it around and turn it into a positive.
00:11:58.238 - 00:12:17.590, Speaker B: Mr. Gensler is holding Bitcoin spot ETPs hostage in his crypto market power grab. Until crypto exchanges register with the SEC, he won't authorize spot Bitcoin ETFs. Arbitrary regulation and regulatory overreaches are recurring themes of the Gensler SEC and Biden administration. Is he trying to match Lena Khan's losing record at the Federal Trade Commission?
00:12:22.330 - 00:13:13.882, Speaker C: I mean, you can kind of see this with Lena Khan too, and this probably doesn't mean much to people who watch this podcast, but she's know very aggressive and losing and now she's been more favorable waving things through, waving like kind of big competitive acquisitions through. I think at a certain point you just need to stop losing. What do you do when you find yourself in a hole? Just stop digging and then just kind of try to crawl your way out and maintain dignity. But I think the dates to look out for are September twelveTH is when Gary Gensler testifies before the Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees. Then you have October 10, which I don't know why, is the day that people have put out there for ETH futures. I think that's like the next approval potential date, maybe that gets laid too. And then jan one.
00:13:13.882 - 00:13:18.726, Speaker C: So it's all happening in Q Four for the most part, which is exciting.
00:13:18.838 - 00:13:47.910, Speaker A: Yeah. And then the end of the 240 day, the other big one is Q One. Right. I think it's mid March, basically all of the final. So you have 240 days to review an ETF if you're the SEC. And a lot of the end of the 240 days comes due in March for, I think seven out of the eight open bitcoin, ETFs, BlackRock, Fidelity, Wisdom Tree, Valkyrie, Bitwise, a whole bunch of those are in March.
00:13:48.250 - 00:13:51.878, Speaker D: What if we get the spot bitcoin ETF approval on the same day of.
00:13:51.884 - 00:14:00.262, Speaker A: The right, right into the God, right into presidential year, right into the Fed turning the interest rates.
00:14:00.406 - 00:14:01.100, Speaker B: Oh.
00:14:02.590 - 00:14:44.470, Speaker D: So the other angle, which I think is interesting just because we were talking about it, know, they touched on the sort of the administrative state perspective that this has been pervasive across the Biden administration. You also had one of the leading candidates for the Republican nomination quote tweet katie Hahn about the SEC losing 30. I think you're going to start to see the candidacy. All the candidates start to build a perspective. You got RFK announcing his presidency at Bitcoin Miami. You've got Vivek Ramaswami talking about him. Quote tweeting katie Hahn I think this is going to become a new rallying.
00:14:44.470 - 00:14:49.674, Speaker D: You know, if you want to reach the younger demographics, this is going to be a good way to do that.
00:14:49.792 - 00:15:01.786, Speaker C: Vivek, what a guy. He's got some pretty out there ideas. I don't know if we have enough time to get into all of them, but some of them are pretty wild.
00:15:01.898 - 00:15:04.080, Speaker A: We're doing a political app one of these days.
00:15:05.010 - 00:15:07.120, Speaker D: We'll wait till 24 to do that.
00:15:08.050 - 00:15:49.580, Speaker C: Yeah, people are going to be fired up, but it's good to see it getting the press, and it's good to see Bitcoin standing for kind of like the it's gone through a lot of narratives, but now I think Bitcoin and crypto are kind of like push back against the regulatory apparatus, nanny state. And I don't think there's many other assets that fulfill that role. Like, you could say oil is that in some ways, but I personally don't like oil. I hope we can save the planet at some point. I think most people agree with us on that. Bitcoin is kind of more neutral in many senses, and it's gotten sir beat up past couple of years. But it's a good narrative backdrop to have for it.
00:15:50.110 - 00:16:32.410, Speaker B: I agree with that. I think it's part of an overall backlash to the political movements of the last couple of years. And it's become sort of a it's not an accident that across both sides of the aisle, the fringe candidate, they all support Bitcoin. And I think it does. You know, and I talked about this example a little while ago. Remember when Spotify was faced with Deplatforming Rogan or facing all that backlash for having Joe Rogan on the platform? So all this eventually boils down to a business decision for a company like Spotify. So imagine if they make the decision, which they did, to side with Joe Rogan, maybe they lose a little bit of business.
00:16:32.410 - 00:17:00.900, Speaker B: So now that you have that audience of, like, what impact, if any, do you think supporting Bitcoin would have on Spotify as a business? Probably pro, right? That probably moves into the yeah, this is probably a plus EV thing for me to do. And I don't think that's the core driving force for crypto or Bitcoin, but marginally, I think it actually ends up mattering. It becomes a part of these political movements and things like that going into the future, if I had to guess.
00:17:04.310 - 00:17:39.440, Speaker C: And it's not just domestic, it's international. It's the guy from Argentina. The narrative is starting to form, and it's starting to form right before the happening right before interest rate cuts and an ETF baby and an ETF in January of this year. If you could draw out, like, a plausible how do we recover the industry? From a macro perspective, it would be like somehow some banks blow up, there's an ETF that somehow gets approved and we get back in the narrative. From a political standpoint, those would be, like, the narrative things that I would care about other than use cases and things endogenous the industry. It's happening.
00:17:39.970 - 00:18:07.518, Speaker B: What do you make, if anything, of the price action? Post the GBTC News. So originally there's a big move up, right? From 25 to 28 or something like that. Looking today, it's basically given everything back. Also, the discount on GBTC, it jumped, like, 12% in one day, something like that. But it's basically given up most of its gains. Do you think there's anything is it just a little bit of a knee jerk reaction or what do you think about the price action?
00:18:07.714 - 00:18:36.370, Speaker D: Broadly speaking, it's just so slow right now. It's the Thursday before Labor Day. Nobody wants to be buying or selling right now. There's basically zero liquidity. I think people are just licking their wounds, waiting for some of these things to happen. But, yeah, this fall will be, I think, a lot of positive new catalysts. But people are, like, waiting for that right now is my opinion.
00:18:37.350 - 00:18:58.390, Speaker C: It's also the slowest day or the slowest week of the year. Two weeks for TradFi. Like, there's no liquidity in TradFi. Everyone's out. It's like the skeleton crews are manning the like I wouldn't look too much into it. I think people are preparing to come back from vacation and settle into whatever narrative they're kind of force fed when they sit down at their Bloomberg terminal.
00:18:58.970 - 00:19:00.220, Speaker A: Let's beat it.
00:19:01.390 - 00:19:08.060, Speaker D: Yeah. I think the first two weeks of September will dictate what the market like, the macro market trajectory is for the rest of the year.
00:19:09.470 - 00:19:13.040, Speaker A: Do you guys think bitcoin ends over under 40?
00:19:13.730 - 00:19:14.480, Speaker D: 40?
00:19:15.730 - 00:19:17.338, Speaker B: Is that financial advice?
00:19:17.514 - 00:19:56.086, Speaker C: Yeah. Sounds like this might become in a financial advice podcast of which we can't participate, but it's an interesting philosophical question that we can't answer. But I think the price action, on one hand, people were trying to price it in. On the other hand, it's not possible to price it in because it's like the variables are accessibility, interest, macro. But also, I think I heard on Eric Beltunis podcast that registered financial advisors control somewhere between ten and 15 trillion of wealth.
00:19:56.278 - 00:19:57.980, Speaker B: Yeah, dude, a lot.
00:20:01.150 - 00:20:36.550, Speaker C: Yeah, most has boomers, too. And he was basically saying if they even get, like, a percent or like, a 10th of a percent, that's ten to 25 billion of flows. And if you get those amount of flows, it's probably good for the best opening year other than, like, QQQ, but it'll be a substantial part of the market cap of bitcoin and ethereum and everything else so I don't think it's really possible to price it in. But if there's even a sliver of truth to that data, I don't know, this could be far larger than people anticipate.
00:20:37.210 - 00:20:46.554, Speaker D: Tom Lee from Funstrat says that if a Spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved, bitcoin is going to, based on the data and analysis that they've performed, 180,000.
00:20:46.672 - 00:20:47.514, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:20:47.632 - 00:20:51.498, Speaker B: We love Tom Lee. I love Tom Lee, man. I love his predictions.
00:20:51.594 - 00:20:53.710, Speaker C: He never folded. He stayed bullish.
00:20:54.450 - 00:20:57.162, Speaker A: His predictions and his rigorous analysis.
00:20:57.226 - 00:20:59.578, Speaker C: Yeah, he didn't fold funds.
00:20:59.594 - 00:21:15.602, Speaker B: Fat is legit. I mean, they do actually have rigorous analysis. Yano knows I've been banging the drum of RIAs for, like, five years in Blockworks because these guys control an enormous amount of money. In the US. I think that's a global stat. 15 trillion. I think in the US.
00:21:15.602 - 00:21:57.842, Speaker B: It's like three or something like that, but trillion with a T. And from my understanding, there's a basic incentive problem with Raas that you guys probably know, which is that Raas get comped on the amount of assets that they're managing on your behalf. And the way that they track those assets is partnerships with brokerage. Right? So it's all hooked up. The backend infrastructure is like, hey, you have your assets on TD Ameritrade or Fidelity or whatever, and I can track the amount that I have control over, and that's the fee that I clip. If an RAA today would recommend you put some of your assets in Bitcoin, it would take them off of the brokerage, move them onto something like Coinbase. Then they're not getting paid on that.
00:21:57.842 - 00:22:02.290, Speaker B: It's like the Silliest incentive misalignment, but it's so real.
00:22:02.360 - 00:22:37.598, Speaker D: Not only that, so there's a disincentive issue or an incentive also. I don't know if anybody has tried to do this, but has anyone tried to actually put Bitcoin into an IRA? It is so hard to like, there are now a couple of products, but you have to seek them out. You have to sign up. You have to get a self directed IRA. You have to fund it by transferring money in from your existing IRA. And then you have to start, effectively a prime account with, like, a Coinbase or any of these other platforms that it is so hard to do. I haven't even done it.
00:22:37.598 - 00:23:09.666, Speaker D: And we should be the poster child's children for being able to do this. But, yeah, I was talking to my uncle recently, and a number of funny things always happen whenever I talk with him, but he was telling me the process of what it was like. He was like, yeah, I was thinking of buying some Bitcoin and some ethereum and putting it into my IRA. And he just walked me through the process. He's like, I don't even know how to start. Not actually how to do it, but how to even start. So I think the bitcoin spot ETF is huge.
00:23:09.666 - 00:23:26.746, Speaker D: I also think broadly, there's not going to be a silver bullet. It's going to be a bunch of lead bullets. And so the writing and putting everything into one event, one approval, one catalyst, I think isn't accurate, but I think it's just going to be a slow grind upwards.
00:23:26.858 - 00:23:39.442, Speaker C: My dad's financial advisor is this guy who used to play in the Canadian Football League, the CFL that he golfs with. Why are you with this guy? He's a nice guy. All right. That's probably not how you should manage your money.
00:23:39.496 - 00:23:41.278, Speaker A: Got to ask some clubs.
00:23:41.454 - 00:24:00.918, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. But it needs to be a dead simple and it needs to have a bit of a narrative behind it. And I think we're building both. Like BlackRock ETF, you can just close your eyes and buy it. The other thing is, it only takes one basis point to trade these things. That's fucking wild. That's going to be so liquid for the rest of crypto.
00:24:01.094 - 00:24:03.530, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed.
00:24:04.270 - 00:24:21.022, Speaker C: I do think we'll see when GBTC converts. I think it's at, what, 17% today? 18%. Man, that's like a high vote of confidence in Barry converting, like, soon. I don't know how I feel about that.
00:24:21.156 - 00:24:23.290, Speaker B: Barry's the real winner out of all this.
00:24:23.380 - 00:24:34.660, Speaker C: Honestly, I would love another year of people getting just turned up and wrecked on the GBTC trade before Redemption widow trade continues. Dude. People get excited about it.
00:24:36.010 - 00:24:40.502, Speaker A: Actually, my uncle texted me. He's like, all right, like, GBTC trade back on.
00:24:40.556 - 00:24:43.480, Speaker C: I was like, all right, exactly, we're back.
00:24:45.450 - 00:25:02.890, Speaker D: Here's a question. When you've got all of the likes of the Blackrocks of the world and you've got grayscale and everybody else like bitwise, et cetera, do you think it's actually net positive value for Barry to convert or to keep it with the 2% AUM fee?
00:25:04.210 - 00:25:08.240, Speaker C: I think he'll keep it with the 2% AUM. I don't think he's going to decrease that.
00:25:10.130 - 00:25:11.198, Speaker D: You won't be able to with an.
00:25:11.204 - 00:25:13.520, Speaker A: ETF, but the competitors will be yeah.
00:25:14.770 - 00:25:19.314, Speaker D: No, you won't have a 2% AUM fee on the ETF. That'll be like ten basis points.
00:25:19.432 - 00:25:25.720, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, he will probably keep the 2% is my point, and just hope that people forget about it.
00:25:29.210 - 00:25:32.566, Speaker A: Although you might make that's an interesting.
00:25:32.748 - 00:25:46.620, Speaker B: You know what, I think the road for him is usually on commodity ETFs like this, there aren't ten options. There are two. There are two options, right? For Gold, it's GLD and IAU. And that's it, really.
00:25:47.470 - 00:26:08.014, Speaker D: This is my point. When you've got 15 applications and you're going up the likes of BlackRock to try and get one of these approved and build the AUM, meanwhile you're charging 2%. You're clipping 2% on Bitcoin ETF or Bitcoin trust, it probably is a question as to whether or not you actually want to convert.
00:26:08.142 - 00:26:39.980, Speaker B: If people want honestly, one of the best podcasts I've ever listened to is Eric Balkunis actually went on Invest, like, the best years ago, like maybe 2018 or 2019, and he did this deep dive on ETFs and how they end up growing. And he was like the strategy, it sort of barbells into either very stayed kind of boring thing or the shiny new thing. Like the arc was just taking off at that point. And he also said it's just silly, but the ticker really matters. The ticker matters a ton. In the ETF game.
00:26:40.450 - 00:26:41.390, Speaker A: I forget.
00:26:43.730 - 00:26:44.938, Speaker D: Was it wisdom tree?
00:26:44.954 - 00:26:45.662, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:26:45.796 - 00:26:48.510, Speaker D: One of them had burr as the ticker.
00:26:49.970 - 00:26:51.630, Speaker A: Like a Valkyrie or something.
00:26:51.780 - 00:26:52.382, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:52.516 - 00:26:59.780, Speaker B: Does anyone have BTC as a ticker? That's the winner, right? I mean, it's got to be.
00:27:02.310 - 00:27:07.262, Speaker C: The other thing that I'm noticing is just there's going to be a lot of marketing that happens around these things.
00:27:07.416 - 00:27:08.120, Speaker B: Yes.
00:27:09.130 - 00:27:27.130, Speaker C: I remember in the last cycle when FTX and Coinbase turned on their consumer marketing in Q, one of 2021, and it was like FTX on the basketball court and Coinbase on the rim and it was literally everywhere. And Sam's face all over fucking San Francisco on those stupid billboards.
00:27:29.790 - 00:27:37.754, Speaker A: Even in this bear market. I was in JFK this weekend and Grayscale's up on like when you walk through JFK, it's just grayscale, grayscale.
00:27:37.802 - 00:27:57.222, Speaker B: Justin's son. Justin's son's face. Yeah, out of JFK, one of the terminals that you go there's like an overpass thing and it's just like a Tron ad with Justin Sun's face. Honestly, probably millions of people have seen this because it's been up for almost I think it's been up for almost a year.
00:27:57.356 - 00:28:03.442, Speaker C: What a guy. I'm going to meet him in Korea, shout out Justin Sun, his Excellency.
00:28:03.586 - 00:28:04.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:05.610 - 00:28:06.360, Speaker C: Yes.
00:28:07.130 - 00:28:07.880, Speaker B: Wow.
00:28:13.230 - 00:28:14.540, Speaker A: That'S so good.
00:28:16.270 - 00:29:11.926, Speaker B: I've got a random question for you guys. I was thinking about this and I have kind of an answer, but not really a great answer. So crypto has stuck to these four year cycles, right? And people sort of hand wave about why that is and the having and things like that. And it was a pretty common argument that you heard last cycle that there's going to be no eventually, this will not be the case. And Suzu, obviously, he's the super cycle, the zooper cycle is wrong. But I actually was thinking about it and I'm now a believer in the four year cycle, but I can't come up with a great first principles reason for why there should be a cycle. So other cyclical industries, there are cyclical industries, and usually those are industries that are either really capex intensive or I guess and have a long time gap in between bringing supply online to meet demand.
00:29:11.926 - 00:29:44.870, Speaker B: So housing is kind of the great example of this, right, where demand kicks up in housing, it takes a long time to build the houses and by the time all the housing inventory comes online, the demand has rolled off and demand is rolling off at the same time supply is coming online and like boom. So these cycles sort of go gold is a really cyclical industry. Semiconductors things. Like that crypto is really cyclical, but it's not that capex intensive. It's harder to come up with a good first principles reason for why that is. Do you guys think it is or no.
00:29:45.020 - 00:30:20.914, Speaker C: Happening is like the anchoring point that everyone is like, this is happening, but it also just happens to business cycles kind of tend to move in like five year increments, you know, and like, it's like it's real because everyone believes it's real. But that's that's not just apparent in this industry. If you, if you've ever hung out with Real Estate bros, they're trying to get a happening going like every other year and they're just building shit that people don't need in places that are already way overbuilt, but they're either five.
00:30:20.952 - 00:30:26.258, Speaker D: Years too early or five years too late. Every single yeah, yeah, a lot of.
00:30:26.264 - 00:30:29.522, Speaker C: Our friends are too late, but we're there for them.
00:30:29.656 - 00:31:14.638, Speaker D: But Mike, to your think, you know, the first principle's answer is that it starts with the happening. And I think when you see those types of cycles and that's the only thing implicitly that goes every four years and then there's everything else that comes with it. There's the 2013 cycle bitcoin goes from like $5 to 1200, then it goes back down. You have different infrastructure build out, you have different companies, then you have the ICO cycle. And everything that happens in 2017, 2021, we're going to see if it all happens again. I think it will. The one variable that is obviously very different, this is going to be the first cycle that also has interest rates and we're not going to be in a zero interest rate perspective.
00:31:14.638 - 00:31:29.020, Speaker D: How that will have an effect, I don't know. Will it have an effect? It'll probably have some, but it's not going to be the massive ten x, 100 x changes that we've seen historically just because we're going off of a bigger base at this point.
00:31:29.710 - 00:31:58.340, Speaker A: This is a Morgan Stanley report they published last month that one of the Morgan Stanley folks sent to me. It is literally about the bitcoin having. And they're basically telling their clients that after the bitcoin having, the price goes up. It's ten pages, but I'll give you the TLDR every four years. Crypto goes through cycles and after the bitcoin having, it takes a little bit of time, but then the price always goes up.
00:31:58.790 - 00:32:10.230, Speaker C: That will be half a million dollars for that research. Please. As someone who used to make these presentations, I know exactly what these people are doing.
00:32:10.380 - 00:32:14.790, Speaker A: Yeah. Summer historically results in the highest bitcoin returns.
00:32:15.210 - 00:32:16.280, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:32:17.130 - 00:32:20.710, Speaker A: So this is summer 2024. We are ripping.
00:32:20.870 - 00:32:26.890, Speaker C: I mean, Vanek is calling for what was it? Something 130,000 for ETH.
00:32:29.230 - 00:32:31.518, Speaker D: Yeah. Their base case was 38,000.
00:32:31.604 - 00:32:36.670, Speaker A: In conclusion, it looks like we have entered a typical crypto spring. It's time to get educated.
00:32:38.930 - 00:32:40.878, Speaker D: Hats off to Ms. Yeah, they did.
00:32:40.884 - 00:33:14.940, Speaker C: A great job on that. The other part of this is like there were articles written about Uber at a billion by academics saying, here's mathematically why this is a scam and it's worth zero. And sometimes these things just end up being far larger than you can anticipate. When I see, like, the 180K target from Tom Lee thrown out, it kind of doesn't seem that crazy, honestly. For bitcoin, not for ETH. When you see people gunning for ETH 50K, maybe take some size off.
00:33:15.310 - 00:33:24.074, Speaker A: We talked tornado cash last week, or maybe it was two weeks ago, and that was a pretty kind of depressing thing that happened. But I think the flip side of that happened this week with Uniswap.
00:33:24.122 - 00:33:24.382, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:24.436 - 00:33:27.214, Speaker A: So Mike, you want to take us through that?
00:33:27.412 - 00:34:16.480, Speaker B: Yes, there was a Uniswap class action lawsuit that got also thrown out this week by a judge in the Southern District of New York. Judge Phela butcher that name. But the crux of it came down to the notion that software platforms can be held liable for damages caused by a third party misuse of that software code. Obviously, that has huge implications for crypto writ large, but also DeFi. It's probably worth noting that that same judge is overseeing the SEC versus Coinbase class action as well. So, again, I think this is significant. A, it just feels like a victory for the good guys, but B, these sorts of things set legal precedent, and the Southern District of New York is not messing around about, what do you guys think about all this?
00:34:17.090 - 00:34:58.330, Speaker D: It was a nuanced and intelligent perspective coming out of the court that I frankly just hadn't seen before. There are a lot of really good quotes that came out of it. They quoted Hayden's tweet basically saying that the protocol is the protocol effectively like our front end uniswap. I think it's uniswap.com can block an asset. That doesn't mean that the protocol blocks an asset. Yeah, it felt like a very kind of aligned perspective with all the stuff that we've been talking about, whereas a lot of the other perspectives that we've seen coming out of these courts is just unfortunately.
00:34:59.630 - 00:35:27.682, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the judge called ETH a commodity explicitly, which is not something that the SEC has been willing to do before. Some of those quotes include, like, this is a great quote. It defies logic that a drafter of computer code underlying a particular software platform could be liable under section 29 B for a third party's misuse of that platform. As discussed, smart contract platforms are self executing, self enforcing code. So, yeah, lots of agreed. Just very nuanced perspective coming out of this.
00:35:27.736 - 00:35:40.474, Speaker A: Yeah, the court said trying to go after them is like trying to go after the developer of a self driving car right after a third party had used the car to rob a bank. It's like you would never go after the developer of the car, obviously.
00:35:40.672 - 00:35:47.050, Speaker D: I mean, the other example they gave was it'd be like if somebody went after cash app or, you know, paying for illegal.
00:35:50.270 - 00:35:50.586, Speaker B: Sense.
00:35:50.608 - 00:35:53.838, Speaker C: You said this. This is the woman that's handling the Coinbase case too. Right.
00:35:53.924 - 00:35:56.218, Speaker D: Which is like Coinbase is not realized.
00:35:56.234 - 00:35:57.326, Speaker A: That that's amazing.
00:35:57.508 - 00:36:04.594, Speaker C: Yeah, that's like the bank shot. Double win. It feels like we're just getting not.
00:36:04.632 - 00:36:06.100, Speaker A: Like ripping on that then.
00:36:15.430 - 00:36:21.080, Speaker C: If that's the type of answer that she has for this case, the Coinbase case is just going to go terribly for the SEC.
00:36:21.450 - 00:36:23.800, Speaker A: Yeah, that's crazy.
00:36:24.650 - 00:36:36.570, Speaker D: Granted, there are elements that are different. This is a protocol that's a company, they make decisions about what assets they list. But I think fortune favors the brave here. I think we'll be wow.
00:36:36.720 - 00:36:45.440, Speaker C: Matt Damon channel it. I don't think we'll see him again.
00:36:47.090 - 00:36:47.838, Speaker D: Who?
00:36:48.004 - 00:36:49.150, Speaker C: Matt Damon?
00:36:50.290 - 00:36:54.810, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one.
00:36:54.900 - 00:36:58.434, Speaker C: Feels like he's a one and done on the crypto cycles, but it's good to have.
00:36:58.472 - 00:37:09.858, Speaker D: Yeah. Speaking of, do we know whatever happened to that lawsuit against everybody, including Shaq, who's evading the subpoena forever?
00:37:10.034 - 00:37:29.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a big win for Uniswap, and I think one of the more damaging impacts of this regulatory crackdown has been entrepreneurs and developers feeling like they could get prosecuted being based out of the US. And I don't think this blanket solves that concern, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.
00:37:30.270 - 00:38:50.002, Speaker D: I will say just in conversations that we have with either our existing portfolio founders or new potential portfolio companies, what happened with Ripple and what is happening with a lot of these other rulings is changing the tide in their perspective. Previously, it was there's no possible way for us to do this in the do we how how could we possibly do this in the United States? Now it's more when will we be able to and I think that perspective change is big. I mean, what is also happening we've talked about it before, but the two bills that are working their way through the House of Representatives and committees right now, the Fit bill and the you know, we're a part of it through the blockchain association, but there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to make amendments before those actually go up for vote. A lot of positive conversations with the staffers that are actually writing these bills. They're taking the industry's feedback and putting changes in. So I think not only are we going to see the courts favoring the industry more and more over time, I think we're going to see some positive movement on the regulatory front too. And that potentially negates or potentially changes a lot of the perspectives that people will have in the courts if the rules change, we're going to have clarity.
00:38:50.066 - 00:39:06.394, Speaker C: Only other thing I would add is as this bill gets feedback and gets changed, we should not be children about this as an industry. There's going to be things that we don't like that get changed. There's going to be things we don't like that end up in there. But ragging on the people who are trying to pull it all together is not helpful to the cause.
00:39:06.512 - 00:39:08.460, Speaker D: Good should never be the enemy of.
00:39:09.150 - 00:39:28.240, Speaker B: Yeah, the three advocacy groups that we have in DC. Coin Center, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Blockchain Association, people do appreciate them, but they just should get way more credit for the work that they, like, slogging through the legal battles in.
00:39:30.070 - 00:39:45.382, Speaker C: Slogging know, there's also not a lot of industries that are as dynamic and as interesting as crypto. Maybe like AI from a legal perspective, policy perspective. But these are the two cash cows for lobbyists and political type.
00:39:45.436 - 00:39:49.206, Speaker D: I mean, I would argue it's the two cash cows for the United States innovation hub.
00:39:49.318 - 00:40:01.018, Speaker C: Jesus. US needs to get it together. Every single day I read just more crazy political bullshit. Like, today, I read the Diane Feinstein stuff about her estate. You read this?
00:40:01.184 - 00:40:04.206, Speaker A: No. I thought you were going to say, did you see Mitch freeze up again?
00:40:04.308 - 00:40:05.360, Speaker D: Oh, my God.
00:40:05.810 - 00:40:10.720, Speaker C: I just feel bad for him. He's just like he's old guy too.
00:40:11.730 - 00:40:17.390, Speaker B: Someone on Twitter said this. It's just like it's sad for Mitch. It's just sad for everyone involved.
00:40:18.050 - 00:40:24.020, Speaker D: The unfortunate ironic part is the question that he froze on was whether or not he's going to run again in 2026.
00:40:24.870 - 00:40:26.998, Speaker C: You don't want to nail that. Miss that one.
00:40:27.084 - 00:40:28.566, Speaker D: Yeah, it was the finest stuff.
00:40:28.668 - 00:40:31.960, Speaker C: She is somehow worse with her husband. Over a billion dollars.
00:40:33.610 - 00:40:36.054, Speaker D: I mean, you know her house, Vance? Yeah.
00:40:36.092 - 00:40:37.350, Speaker C: It's pimping.
00:40:38.250 - 00:40:41.826, Speaker D: Literally on the line street stuff. It's like the nicest house in Billionaires.
00:40:41.858 - 00:40:50.460, Speaker C: Row, but now their whole family is knives out, fighting each other for this money. And she's like this frail old person who doesn't know what's going on. It's just a bad look. We need to get it together.
00:40:51.810 - 00:40:53.662, Speaker B: How is she worth a billion dollars?
00:40:53.796 - 00:40:59.658, Speaker C: It's a good question. Just made a few good trades on high leverage.
00:40:59.834 - 00:41:02.640, Speaker B: Couple of trades, man.
00:41:03.570 - 00:41:07.170, Speaker C: The story didn't get into that, but that also felt like the biggest unanswered question.
00:41:07.320 - 00:41:14.706, Speaker D: It's also the same situation with Nancy Pelosi. I mean, that all stems from Paul, but he ran an investment bank for.
00:41:14.728 - 00:41:20.690, Speaker C: 35 years, as one does. Anyways, these are our local senators.
00:41:21.430 - 00:42:15.602, Speaker B: I would love to be a fly on the wall when Paul gets asked, like, Paul, what's your edge? What's your edge in the markets? Like, what do you know that other people don't? He's just like, I got Nancy, got nance locked and loaded. All right, one thing I wanted to moving back to crypto, I wanted to get your guys take on. So Starware had an interesting situation this week. Starware, like many of these L Two S or even Ethereum or any blockchain, frankly, goes through a series of upgrades, right? So software updates that have to get pushed through to a bunch of different users. And a couple of months ago, they put out the notice. That something to the effect of, hey, if you're on this standard of wallet, you need to upgrade. And they pushed through an upgrade because again, the thing that governs StarkNet is a multi SIG and a bunch of people lost access to their funds.
00:42:15.602 - 00:42:51.970, Speaker B: Now, it wasn't a huge amount of money, it was five hundred and fifty K. I think they made changes pretty quickly that allowed users to claim those old funds so no one lost any money. I think it was a gaffe just in terms of pushing that forward. And I think the bigger problem is that the system even allows them to do something like that. And I think that's the thing that needs to get called attention to. And I think we know things like there are still major L two S that don't have fraud proofs live. Most of these things are upgradable contracts that are governed by a multi SIG.
00:42:51.970 - 00:43:04.246, Speaker B: If you're going to store billions of dollars on these chains, I know we need training wheels, but also, yeah, it kind of should make you think twice a little bit as a user. Right?
00:43:04.348 - 00:43:06.818, Speaker D: You should make sure nobody accidentally kicks the power cord.
00:43:06.914 - 00:43:07.174, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:07.212 - 00:43:12.666, Speaker C: Who do you contact if your balance got deleted? Is there like a renumeration program or.
00:43:12.848 - 00:43:20.860, Speaker B: Is it your local Twitter influencer with 100,000 follows supposed contact us customer support? Yeah.
00:43:22.510 - 00:43:35.950, Speaker A: So the network upgraded to new contracts, which meant that any wallet that was using old contracts were deprecated. But then people freaked out and then they flipped the switch back on so you could re access those wallets. Is that right, Mike?
00:43:37.810 - 00:43:41.538, Speaker B: Yeah, we're starting to move outside of my technical range of knowledge, but yeah, something like that.
00:43:41.544 - 00:43:55.058, Speaker A: I actually think this calls out another issue. So the obvious issues, like, I mean, that's ridiculous that they can do that. Turn that on and off. I didn't know you could honestly didn't know you could do that. It also calls out that there's still no communication layer for crypto.
00:43:55.154 - 00:43:58.342, Speaker B: To be clear, any of the L two S could do that. This isn't a star.
00:43:58.396 - 00:44:44.226, Speaker A: No, but I didn't know that was possible. And now I realize that that's possible. Not just Starkware, but I think the other issue is we had this with permes. It was like, I wanted to tell the permes that we launched this NFT thing and I was, can you get access to permissionless for free, for example? And then it was like, well, hopefully they follow us on Twitter already. We then have to drive them into a discord and then post on Discord and hope that they have notifications on for like there's no email equivalent for crypto. And you got to imagine as wallets get bigger, communication gets built into wallets. People will start checking their wallets daily, or I don't know if that's it, but you got to be able to communicate with your users.
00:44:44.226 - 00:44:44.822, Speaker A: And so on.
00:44:44.876 - 00:45:21.940, Speaker D: I think in a lot of these examples of the maturation of tech markets, we've talked about this kind of before, but obviously Facebook was not the first social network. It did not originate the idea. But what made it enabled, what made it popular, photos. And what actually made it popular was the ability to have digital photos that were easily accessible. I think we're going to look back and one of these lockstep, huge changes is going to be like, oh, we can actually communicate wallet to wallet now. You can on Ether scan and there's like hacky ways of doing it. People literally send transactions with the data field.
00:45:21.940 - 00:45:43.850, Speaker D: But until there is something that's canonical and pervasive, this is one of the things that we're looking at thinking about for social crypto. Friendtech is obviously one example of a chat based application where built into the blockchain, but you don't have this native right now. And I think that will actually enable a lot of social functionality.
00:45:46.190 - 00:46:00.286, Speaker C: Friendtech has it has the chat. It's like really shitty and it's not decentralized. But somebody like Xmtp is built Xmtp, right? I think they're kind of like the front runner right now because I think they're coinbase Wallets messaging provider too.
00:46:00.388 - 00:46:03.358, Speaker A: Yeah, they're good people.
00:46:03.524 - 00:46:32.540, Speaker B: You know what a good source of information just to close it out on Starkware is L two B is pretty good about this. They've got a sort of dashboard of these are the different things that we would like to ultimately see for L two S to be decentralized and other statistics just about each of the big L two S. And you can kind of compare and contrast side by side. So shout out L Two Beat or pretty good source of info. We talked about bringing back hot takes. Anyone have any hot takes they want to share?
00:46:33.870 - 00:46:40.742, Speaker A: In the next bull market, one big brand will drive more transactions than all D Five platforms combined.
00:46:40.806 - 00:46:41.980, Speaker C: It's going to be a game.
00:46:43.070 - 00:47:03.038, Speaker A: I don't know what it'll either be a game or like I don't know. I was looking at one of those platforms. It's not L two B, but it's like one of those run by a two person company type thing. And DraftKings drove more transactions than any platform in Crypto in July or June.
00:47:03.214 - 00:47:04.302, Speaker B: What did DraftKings?
00:47:04.366 - 00:47:16.150, Speaker A: What's the link there? They're on polygon. They launched some shit on Polygon. There were like 140,000 transactions in a week, all of like $100 each or something like relative.
00:47:17.130 - 00:48:02.706, Speaker D: There's a company called Midnight Society and they're a game. They did a mint, I think in, I want to say like February or March. 400,000 in one week broke Polygon. The scale of these games, whether it's DraftKings, I consider that to kind of be a game. That consumer scale I think is just something that crypto has never even fathomed. I was listening to the Antonio Garcia Martinez interview and he was talking about DSPs and what it's like to actually go through, like, the ad sac. And that was effectively his team at Facebook was my team at Snap, and we built the ad auction at Snap.
00:48:02.706 - 00:48:26.362, Speaker D: You're talking about, like, 300,000 to 500 to 700,000 transactions a second of just, like, being able to process all of that information in real time. Imagine the speed that it takes you to load a web page. There's about seven different institutions that that function just went through to be able to serve you that ad. It's absolutely crazy, the scale of some of these consumer apps.
00:48:26.426 - 00:49:06.118, Speaker B: I've got a hot take for you guys. Did everyone see the AirDrop announcement from Friendtech? That airdrops would basically only go to people that didn't use clones or forks, and it got widely panned. I didn't hate it, actually. I think airdrops are being iterated on right now. Like the point system is the most obvious way to kind of drag it out in general, but airdrops are a really good way to solve the cold start problem. But I think a lot of founders woke up on the other side of the bear market and were like, I'm just giving my token away for people to turn around and dump it, and that's not helping anything. So points are one part of that solution.
00:49:06.118 - 00:49:37.266, Speaker B: But, yeah, I do think that everyone in Crypto one of the not great things about Crypto is there's this expectation that I just show up early and therefore I get free stuff and I should just be rewarded. And I think Savvy founders and good product designers will be like, this is the behavior that I want to see. If you don't do the behavior that I'm trying to incentivize, you don't get the reward. So I'm not sure if it'll play out. I could see it blowing up in their face, too. But I didn't hate it. From an Ethos perspective.
00:49:37.266 - 00:49:40.134, Speaker B: I don't think that's against crypto's ethos or something like that.
00:49:40.252 - 00:49:56.730, Speaker D: I get a hot take? The first protocol, not base layer. The first application to have a billion dollars of annualized revenue flowing to a token. I think we're going to hit that in the next cycle, and I think it's already been created.
00:49:58.270 - 00:50:00.154, Speaker A: You think the protocol are you going to name that?
00:50:00.192 - 00:50:00.838, Speaker B: Are you going to name that?
00:50:00.864 - 00:50:02.506, Speaker C: Elaborate no further.
00:50:02.618 - 00:50:03.374, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:50:03.572 - 00:50:05.040, Speaker C: Thank you for your time.
00:50:05.970 - 00:50:06.510, Speaker B: All Right.
00:50:06.580 - 00:50:22.462, Speaker C: I think I would call this a lukewarm take, but the Macro Bears are back. I had a long drive yesterday. I listened to, like, five macro podcasts. I feel terrible. Too much macro.
00:50:22.526 - 00:50:24.260, Speaker A: Didn't want to get out of bed today.
00:50:25.190 - 00:50:33.958, Speaker C: Too much macro. But yeah, some guy was like, bulls are going to get their heads chopped off. It's like, dude, too much.
00:50:34.124 - 00:50:40.282, Speaker D: I mean, I've been listening predictions of 7% unemployment in Q. One Q, two of next year.
00:50:40.416 - 00:50:44.250, Speaker C: That shit is back. Like the macro recession calls.
00:50:45.390 - 00:50:52.330, Speaker A: Can you explain that to me? Just Because they think that the Fed is going to basically hike until they break something.
00:50:52.480 - 00:51:03.840, Speaker C: I think their perspective is that it's basically already broken. It just is not in the data because the data is so laggy and interest rate hikes are already laggy. They're like, it's all going to happen in Q Four. Q one.
00:51:04.530 - 00:51:47.358, Speaker D: I told this to Vance. So I graduated high school in spring 2008, fall 2007, my elective class. I chose to take Economics in high school. I remember writing my end of semester paper on whether or not we were already in a recession in December 2007. It took another nine months for Lehman to fail. But I think of that example just represents in my mind how long it takes for these things to actually play out and for them to happen, because it's not really like it doesn't move at crypto speed, obviously, and things are faster now than they were in 2007, 2008. But I think the economic data jolts this week.
00:51:47.358 - 00:52:16.120, Speaker D: The largest decrease that they've ever had in the recording of jolts was this week. You're starting to see some of these private data points, or non classic data points like unemployment rate and GDP and inflation. You're starting to see the Manaheim, the Zillow indexes, all that stuff starting to come down on inflation and growth also is not looking too hot right now. I think you're going to start to see some of these things actually break pretty soon.
00:52:18.250 - 00:52:56.590, Speaker B: The macro cycle. To drastically simplify it to your question, like, why do people think this is? There's like four components and they tend to proceed sequentially. So step number one, is there's a change in the interest rate environment. So interest rates go up or down? So they go up. The first thing that that impacts usually is housing. Housing is a super interest rate sensitive sector because basically everyone is levered to the tits on housing. And when housing goes up and down, it has this twofold effect on the economy, which is one, a ton of different sectors in the US touch housing.
00:52:56.590 - 00:53:28.286, Speaker B: It's all the things that go into the home. It's the white goods, it's construction, it's like all these raw materials and very non sexy industries that employ a ton of people. And it's also everyone's wealth. So there's a huge wealth effect when houses are up, everyone thinks they're wealthier and they spend more. So after housing goes down, both of those things start to work in the opposite direction. And when that starts to happen, you get profit margins contract, and that's when you start to see companies miss earnings and margins to get squeezed. And then what people do is they fire people.
00:53:28.286 - 00:53:50.500, Speaker B: That's what companies do. And that's the general cycle as it plays out. So everyone has been pointing to unemployment is really strong, is a sign of the economy being strong. Unemployment is the last thing to turn. And usually before recessions start, unemployment is extremely low. So that's why people think this. That's generally the way the cycle plays out.
00:53:52.490 - 00:54:02.890, Speaker C: Yeah, especially the white collar jobs. Try getting a tech job at a big tech company right now. They're like, we're not hiring. For how long? For the foreseeable future.
00:54:02.960 - 00:54:16.480, Speaker B: For AI. Did you see there's a headline in the Wall Street Journal, it's like, forget quiet, quitting now companies are quiet cutting. That's such a cutesy way of saying like, yeah, they probably watched the TikTok videos y'all were putting out.
00:54:17.170 - 00:54:20.400, Speaker C: They saw those, they saw those.
00:54:22.850 - 00:54:25.294, Speaker D: You shouldn't have had your employer in it.
00:54:25.492 - 00:54:27.506, Speaker C: AI gives them the narrative cover to.
00:54:27.528 - 00:54:31.666, Speaker A: Cut those people in the same way that COVID gave a lot of people the narrative cover.
00:54:31.768 - 00:54:32.370, Speaker C: Right?
00:54:32.520 - 00:54:33.220, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:33.830 - 00:54:51.130, Speaker C: I think the question is what is the this one macro pod that Michael and I both listened to calls for 7% unemployment by Q one. That's like a COVID magnitude event, the doubling of the unemployment rate. Maybe that happens, but it probably directionally trends that way.
00:54:51.280 - 00:54:58.058, Speaker D: And just to be clear, as crazy as that sounds, and as terrible as that sounds, I ultimately think that that's a very good thing.
00:54:58.144 - 00:55:13.360, Speaker C: Very good thing. And here's my question. There will be a bad news is good news, period. We're definitely in that right now where it's like, OOH jolter down, let's ramp Nvidia up again. But then it's going to be like, all right, what is bad news is bad news look like? And that'll be like.
00:55:17.010 - 00:55:21.106, Speaker D: Consumption goes down because unemployment is at 7%. That's what it looks like.
00:55:21.208 - 00:55:21.860, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:22.310 - 00:55:51.626, Speaker D: But also keep in mind we'll see what happens in November. It's going to be an election year. I think most change which is positive will come if the economic factors in the backdrop are not positive. I think you're going to see interest rate cuts faster if you have actual negative economic data. And frankly, this thing is going to happen. I think that's kind of where this negative macro cycle is coming from. It's going to happen.
00:55:51.626 - 00:55:57.438, Speaker D: It's just a question of when and how bad. And I think getting it over faster is going to be better.
00:55:57.604 - 00:56:32.218, Speaker B: I think the other reason why I think it's good is in a low interest rate environment, bad decisions get rewarded. I think it's really frustrating. And think about how that's played out in crypto in the past. There's a phrase, I think from Web Two, which is like, you're always at the mercy of your stupidest competitor. And I feel like this played out most directly in the case of Celsius and BlockFi. And these are just my personal opinions. I know both of those companies failed, but I've always had a lot of empathy for BlockFi because I thought that management team had integrity and generally played things really right.
00:56:32.218 - 00:57:12.258, Speaker B: And one of the ways they got screwed was Celsius just did not offer realistic interest rates. I remember talking to their VP of finance a long time before during the bear market of 2018 or 2019. We just can't see how the math adds up for their rates. But if your competitor is just taking way too much risk, offering way too high of rates, you could say that that doesn't make sense. Until the cows come home, it looks like you're just getting your shit rocked for like two or three years at a time. You know how long two or three years is to be losing? I mean, just tough, man. It's just tough.
00:57:12.258 - 00:57:17.430, Speaker B: And zerp environments reward that type of behavior because you can always get financed.
00:57:18.570 - 00:57:21.690, Speaker A: Can always get $40 million under the table from a CEO.
00:57:23.150 - 00:57:32.618, Speaker C: All right, here's a question for you. For the next 20 years, do you think interest rates on average will be above or below 3% for the Fed funds rate?
00:57:32.704 - 00:57:44.800, Speaker B: I think it'll fluctuate, but I think the US, the only option that they have is to inflate their debt away. So it really depends on where the natural rate of inflation is. And interest rates will be like 3% below that?
00:57:45.250 - 00:57:46.560, Speaker D: I think it's below.
00:57:47.090 - 00:57:54.900, Speaker C: I think it's probably below. And also just like the magnitude and quantum of the debt that needs to be rolled over means that you need low interest rates to do that.
00:57:56.070 - 00:57:57.922, Speaker D: I also don't think it's going to be zero.
00:57:58.056 - 00:57:59.480, Speaker C: I don't think it's going to be zero.
00:58:00.330 - 00:58:01.560, Speaker B: What should it be?
00:58:02.010 - 00:58:25.120, Speaker C: We'll probably find some excuse in our lifetimes to get back down there, but like two and a half, 3% interest rates? A, I'm not wigged out about that within the context of evaluation for tech stocks, but B, that's not exciting for me to go take my money off of crypto and put it in a bank, especially if that shit's on chain. I don't know. I would call these interest rates probably transitory in the fullness of time.
00:58:26.450 - 00:58:29.982, Speaker D: We're at the highest they've been in, what was it, 20 years?
00:58:30.116 - 00:58:42.560, Speaker C: Dude, you can buy like 2% real rate Treasuries, like 1020 years out. That's an amazing deal. If you're a big pension fund or insurance fund, eventually they're all just going to buy those.
00:58:44.130 - 00:58:45.880, Speaker D: You can buy them for 5%.
00:58:46.490 - 00:58:47.826, Speaker C: I'm saying real rates.
00:58:47.858 - 00:59:06.380, Speaker B: Real rates. 5% is historically relatively normal, though. But the.com bubble happened at 5% or 6% interest rates. Like, you asked that question before. Could crypto happen at a 5% tenure? Absolutely it could. I think I don't know.
00:59:06.380 - 00:59:41.000, Speaker B: The CBO is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It projects out the debt for the US. And they blew everyone's socks off, and they were like, yeah, we're projecting I think their first estimate was somewhere around a trillion dollars in debt. Then they came out and said it was going to be 2 trillion in debt per year for the next ten years. So ending the next decade at a $50 trillion plus in debt. And this second half of the year, they're now projecting like, 1.6 for half the year.
00:59:41.000 - 00:59:53.180, Speaker B: What. Is all this money getting spent on, so they have to inflate it away. I feel like that's going to suck, actually. That's going to be us that bears the brunt of that.
00:59:55.310 - 00:59:58.378, Speaker C: Well, I mean, if you hold on to the right assets no, if you.
00:59:58.384 - 01:00:00.860, Speaker A: Hold assets, we're not the ones that feel the brunt of that.
01:00:02.110 - 01:00:18.138, Speaker B: It's the social stuff. It's the social stuff, dude. I just don't think you want to live through that. If you rewind the clock to those periods of time, even if you come out on top asset wise, those are not fun periods of time to live through. Countries are miserable when that's going on.
01:00:18.244 - 01:00:28.406, Speaker A: Isn't that like countries are miserable at 50% inflation. Like, if you have like 8% inflation, it sucks. But if you hold assets, you're good. Or tell me I'm wrong there.
01:00:28.588 - 01:01:00.666, Speaker C: In the 70s, gold ripped 2800% in that decade, while inflation was like ten, I think somewhere around there. I don't think it's going to be that bad for people who hold outside money or like really high quality. Here's an example. Let's say in a few years things are looking shaky for the US government. Apple is still chugging along. Do you want to own Apple bonds or do you want to own US government bonds? Probably like apple bonds. Do you want to own ETH cash flow or like, government cash flow? Probably ETH cash flow.
01:01:00.666 - 01:01:08.494, Speaker C: Accounting for the upside, the plan is to not get worked by this salary. That's where it becomes tough.
01:01:08.622 - 01:01:34.620, Speaker D: Yeah. The other perspective here is this is just highlighted with the Jackson Hole meeting last week. Out of all of the G seven countries, the US economy is still by far and away the best. And while we may be in trouble in a lot of respects, or the next 20 years, 30 years, 50 years, we're going to be met with some issues. There are much bigger issues basically everywhere else.
01:01:37.470 - 01:02:46.318, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think the way that it yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure actually that it works. I think income people do better in this scenario because what the US is doing is they're doing a soft default of the debt is what they're doing, is saying, like, we don't actually have enough money to pay this debt back, so we're going to inflate at a rate that's much higher than our debt load. So you wake up in ten years and if you were a creditor at that point, the amount of debt relative to income is like much like think about if you had a mortgage, right, and it was $250,000 or a million dollar mortgage or something like that, and you make $250,000 a year. If there's a rip roar in inflation for ten years, you could be making a million dollars a year at the end of that ten years, but then your mortgage is still a million dollars. So the income people actually tend to do pretty well in inflation. It's the asset holders, specifically the bond holders, that get absolutely smoked because that's the explicit objective is to devalue bondholders.
01:02:46.494 - 01:02:50.098, Speaker D: That assumes that your salary changes every year.
01:02:50.264 - 01:02:54.850, Speaker B: I think your salary has to change, otherwise there would be like, riots.
01:02:57.750 - 01:03:01.814, Speaker D: Which is why I think asset holders actually do the best because that'll change.
01:03:01.852 - 01:03:05.490, Speaker B: With market depends on the asset. Depends on the asset.
01:03:05.570 - 01:03:22.380, Speaker C: I think these problems are fixable though, in my mind at least. I think we have problems. We know what they are. We also have like tools. What are they? Crypto AI nuclear technology. Broadly. I think if we put them together in the right order, we can unlock some serious stuff.
01:03:22.380 - 01:03:32.670, Speaker C: I do think there is a lot of reason to be, you know, aside from the macro doom, I think the US is in a pretty decent position if we keep all these industries on shore.
01:03:33.510 - 01:03:34.482, Speaker B: I think so too.
01:03:34.536 - 01:03:39.300, Speaker A: Yeah. Vance, I like your roast of this 22% lido thing right now.
01:03:41.670 - 01:03:43.666, Speaker C: Let's just talk about that for a second.
01:03:43.848 - 01:03:48.360, Speaker A: This tweet, I hadn't seen this tweet. This is the dumbest tweet I've ever seen.
01:03:50.730 - 01:04:25.358, Speaker C: We've talked about this a lot. So I don't want to beat this dead horse again because it's already flogged, but people are like obsessing about no validator platform. Regardless if you use DVT or have distributed node operators or anything, you can't run more than 22%. There's no evidence or justification given. And now you have this guy signing up rocket Pool stakewise Stator Labs, Diva Staking I've never heard of them. And they've all made the brave commitment to never stake more than 22% of all ETH guys. You have like 0.1%
01:04:25.358 - 01:04:25.990, Speaker C: of all ETH.
01:04:26.010 - 01:04:33.380, Speaker A: I'd be like Blockworks being like, I commit to having 1% of the financial media market and Bloomberg is like, well.
01:04:35.670 - 01:04:49.640, Speaker C: Yeah. So I also committed to never run more than 22% of all staked ETH personally in the event that I end up owning that much. So just some are bad takes out here. Let's improve, please.
01:04:50.730 - 01:04:53.474, Speaker B: The Lido takes are horrendous terrible.
01:04:53.522 - 01:04:53.894, Speaker A: Really bad.
01:04:53.932 - 01:05:34.310, Speaker B: Lido takes so bad. I think it's kind of hypocritical because Lido, first of all, the reason it found product market there are a lot of reasons it found product market fit, but the reason it was originally blessed is because A, Ethereum didn't provide an in protocol way to delegate stake and then B the exchanges were going to take the whole market. What we didn't want was binance to roll or even coinbase. As great as they are, they're still a centralized company. You didn't want them to own the entire Ethereum network. And so we got a decentralized solution which is A, dao and has dual voting or dual governance rather. So yeah, I just think it's so hypocritical and it's a winner take all market.
01:05:34.310 - 01:05:44.762, Speaker B: These people don't take into account market structure dynamics either. So yeah, having all the people that have like 5% of the stake be like, yeah, we'll never do more than 22%. Yeah.
01:05:44.816 - 01:05:55.230, Speaker A: Also, it's so hard to build a company. Lido has just executed so freaking well. You want to get more market share? Go outcompete that go execute better.
01:05:55.300 - 01:06:00.542, Speaker C: No, we'd rather sign, like, the reverse giving pledge for crypto that we won't exceed 22.
01:06:00.596 - 01:06:08.610, Speaker A: You love free markets and you love being a libertarian until, like until you're not until you don't have the market share yet. Kills me.
01:06:08.680 - 01:06:16.018, Speaker C: My bags need to go up podcast. They hit eight and a half million 8.25 today.
01:06:16.104 - 01:06:23.922, Speaker B: I guess if I did have to take the other side of that, do you think if there was some catastrophic slashing event, the ETH would hard fork on Lido?
01:06:24.066 - 01:06:52.474, Speaker C: No, we've already had that in Lido. There's been a couple of slashing incidents. Nowhere near as bad as the rest of the field, but we've already played that game. I think the more pertinent discussion we should talk about this on the next one is like inflation versus burn versus rewards. Who gets what, why, who comes to the table? How do they negotiate? How do they signal? If you have all the Steve signaling, the network is going to be a lot more cohesive than stakewise cult versus.
01:06:52.522 - 01:06:54.350, Speaker B: Rocket pool cult versus Lido.
01:06:54.690 - 01:06:57.578, Speaker C: We all are one. Ethereum, in my mind wait, why don't.
01:06:57.594 - 01:07:02.434, Speaker A: You think there'd be a hard fork? Isn't Lido big enough at this point and powerful enough to create a hard fork there?
01:07:02.552 - 01:07:17.720, Speaker C: I don't think they're actually big enough yet. I think that would be like a 40 50% moment where they could actually swing it. It also depends on who shows up or what governance voting is like or where it happens. There's no formal governance of ETH. Right.
01:07:19.050 - 01:07:54.194, Speaker B: I think you can't have your cake and eat it too. And I think Ethereum's design choice, which is the right design choice, is to not have that within the protocol. But then you can't complain when someone who's a successful service provider and gives people what they want, which is the ability to passively delegate. Stake does that. And there's kind of an irony, actually, where native stake delegation works a lot better in something like Salana, which has delegated proof of stake. And the liquid staking adoption is like 3%. The stake rate of Salana is 70% or 80%, and the liquid staking penetration is like, three.
01:07:54.194 - 01:08:22.858, Speaker B: And the reason why is because their withdrawal period is really low, and you can just delegate in protocol. It's super easy. So Ethereum, I actually kind of think it was the right choice. They decided to not put that in the protocol. Another solution popped up, and I think the right way to do that is to engage with one of the few apps that's found product market fit and not just bully them on Twitter. That just doesn't seem like the right right. It doesn't seem like the right solution.
01:08:22.954 - 01:08:27.038, Speaker C: Any other team I'd be with you, but Lido is so locked in that they don't care.
01:08:27.124 - 01:08:28.622, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
01:08:28.756 - 01:08:31.914, Speaker C: They just want to get as much Ethan there as possible. And they're winning.
01:08:31.962 - 01:08:33.182, Speaker B: All right, fellas, this is a good one.
01:08:33.236 - 01:08:33.562, Speaker C: Peace.
01:08:33.626 - 01:08:34.106, Speaker A: Good bug.
01:08:34.138 - 01:08:34.460, Speaker B: See you, guys.
