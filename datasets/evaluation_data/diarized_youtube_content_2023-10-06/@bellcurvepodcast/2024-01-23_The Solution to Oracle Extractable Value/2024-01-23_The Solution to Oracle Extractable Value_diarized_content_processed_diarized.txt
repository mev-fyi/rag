00:00:00.410 - 00:00:13.760, Speaker A: Quintus is part of the Flashbots team, and we can go deeper into how that works too. So that's the high level mebcapture for oracle updates, and we can talk about where that goes in the future, too.
00:00:14.690 - 00:00:54.910, Speaker B: Awesome. So maybe to just sum up here and even zoom out and give listeners a little bit more context, we're talking about attacking one of the major buckets of MEV that gets produced within this sort of ethereum MeV supply chain, which is liquidations. And within our sort of solution here, there are four sort of stakeholders. There's Uma, there's chainlink, Ave and flashbots. And I want to get into actually almost like what this new supply chain that we're talking about ultimately looks like. But Hart, Quintus, Turun, whoever wants to take this, can you just give listeners who aren't as familiar with what liquidation type meV, and how that actually works on Aave? Can you just describe what that entire bucket of MeV that gets generated?
00:00:58.690 - 00:01:06.998, Speaker A: Should you do the one sentence or two sentence description of what MeV is anyways, and whether we're going to call it MeV or MeV? We should also answer that debate.
00:01:07.114 - 00:01:48.930, Speaker C: I'm a mev guy. I'm a mev guy. A one sentence description of what MeV is, I feel like I'm going to have to use many commas and ands. What MeV is the most basic definition. It's value that a block producer miner originally, now validators indirectly can extract from sort of influencing the ordering or inclusion of exclusion of transactions. And in particular in this case, it'll be sort of the transaction which follows an oracle update, maybe specifically the liquidation stuff I think Turin should talk about, but I guess can go into it as maybe.
00:01:51.620 - 00:01:53.040, Speaker A: He looked frozen.
00:01:53.780 - 00:01:55.724, Speaker C: He was thinking deeply about liquidations.
00:01:55.852 - 00:02:07.860, Speaker B: I thought he was just blown away by that definition that you gave Quintus and just absorbing it. But Quintus, maybe, can you give us the, like, just kind of walk us through mechanically how MeV is created on the sort of Ave liquidation?
00:02:08.760 - 00:03:04.628, Speaker C: I mean, generally what happens with a lot of Defi protocols is that there's some update which comes, they rely on some information from the outside world, like an oracle, like a price feed, for example, on ETH, USDC, or some asset pair. And based on this, they adjust some parameters for lending protocols. They say, okay, listen, we have these liquidation thresholds. We have this much collateral for a loan, and if the price moves below a certain threshold, then suddenly the collateral is not enough to cover the loan anymore, and it's going to become bad debt. So automatically we make this collateral liquidatable, basically. And so anyone can come, different protocols do it differently. But basically, if we lent out USDC for eat collateral, if you give us enough USDC back, you can take all this ETH collateral.
00:03:04.628 - 00:03:39.990, Speaker C: And usually they let this happen at a relative discount. So the ETH is going quite cheaply because they don't want to risk sitting with bad debt. And so the person who does this trade and supplies USDC and takes off the ETH makes quite a bit of money because many people can do this. It's permissionless. All that excess value ends up going to the validator as the different liquidators bid to be the transaction that follows the oracle update and is able to extract this value.
00:03:43.640 - 00:04:20.530, Speaker B: Yeah. So do you want to describe, mean what exactly oval does within this context? And maybe just to hearken back for prior listeners of Bellcrove, we spent the entire season with Dan on the deck side talking about this idea of MeV recapture, which is going to be an idea that we refer to here within the context of how borrow lend protocols can recapture some of the MEV that's being directed to the proposer layer within Ethereum. But now maybe, can you kind of mechanically walk us through what oval actually is and how it sort of stands in the middle of AAvE and these chain link oracle updates that are getting pushed out?
00:04:21.300 - 00:04:58.924, Speaker A: Yeah. So, to summarize again what quintess was saying, you have an oracle update come in if it triggers a liquidation. Those liquidations are like juicy arb trades, and we can go into what those look like before. And this is where trune does have a lot of expertise on Gauntlet, where the thing that aave and compound and those protocols care about, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, fourth, the most important thing to them is when they need to sell collateral, they sell the collateral. Otherwise everything breaks bad debt. Right? And so they need to sell the collateral cheap. Right.
00:04:58.924 - 00:06:04.588, Speaker A: They need to sell it at a cheap price to absolutely make sure that happens. And currently, those cheap prices, that discount to whatever kind of fair value is that's getting captured in this MEV supply chain and basically getting paid to validators. Okay, what flashbots has shown us, and what the ecosystem has shown us with these order flow auctions is we can use Flashbot's MEV share infrastructure to run an auction for the right to use a transaction, and what oval does, essentially, and says, hey, when a chain link price update comes in, Ave can't use it immediately. No liquidator can use that price immediately for the first three blocks. So we're talking like 36 seconds here. No liquidator, no searcher can use this price for the first 36 seconds unless they go through MeV share. So if you go through MeV share and we run an auction, then you can use the price in those 1st 36 seconds.
00:06:04.588 - 00:06:28.250, Speaker A: If you don't go through MeV share, don't go through oval. You can't use that price. What this means is that we are essentially auctioning off the first right to use a chainlink price through the Oval flashbots MeV share infrastructure. And that auction allows us to recapture all this MEV that these protocols are losing. We'll stop there.
00:06:29.260 - 00:07:03.204, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really. I mean, true. And I'd love to get your. And for listeners who might be a little bit more used to hearing about this, again, from sort of the Dex perspective, this is almost similar to, like, the top of blockchain auction that gets bid in sex to Dex arbitrage and the right to bid against an amm. That would be sort of an analogy or framework that you might apply onto this specific situation. But Tarun, as someone who's been know, one of the founders of Gauntlet, and obviously very familiar from the sort of aave perspective, you guys have done a lot of work with them. Can you just talk a little, know, putting that cap on why this might be something that AAvE is super interested in?
00:07:03.402 - 00:07:49.560, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess there are a couple of reasons. Initially, you were talking about sort of this comparison to centralized decentralized arbitrage. You should think of that type of mev as sort of the standard picking pennies in front of a steamroller type of thing, where you're like, every block, every second, there's, like, some amount of Mev, but it's small. It's like a couple point one basis point or something like that, in sandwich profits or mev profits. So, like, I put in a dollar, I get a dollar, zero one, right? It's like a very small profit. These liquidation events are actually quite different. They're more like lottery ticket, high risk style meV.
00:07:49.560 - 00:08:19.912, Speaker D: So they're not very frequent. They don't exist on every block. They exist on particular times. And when they happen, it's usually quite a large incentive. Part of the reason for this is that in the traditional finance world, if I have a loan that needs to get liquidated, usually the bank or the broker internalizes it. So that means that they sort of hold the position and they slowly sell out of it. So, like, let's say I have a bunch of Tesla stock.
00:08:19.912 - 00:08:52.724, Speaker D: I borrow a bunch of cash against it. The Tesla stock goes down 20%. Now the bank margin calls me. They slowly liquidate. But that means the bank holds the risk in most DFI protocols, although I think this is changing a little bit slowly over time. The protocols themselves, especially the ones from 2019 and 2020, when there was no on chain liquidity, can't hold positions. You should basically think of them as like, they can't hold negative positions, like lossy positions, which people call bad debt.
00:08:52.724 - 00:10:07.756, Speaker D: But it's sort of a weird thing because the debt is floating price, so the price could go back, and suddenly it's good debt. The bad debt thing is a pet peeve of mine, of crypto people not paying attention to what the thing is and instead giving it a meme name. And anyway, so the idea is, if you can't hold risk, you need to fire sell, as kind of Hart saying. So the question is, how do you choose how much of a discount you give? And one way of thinking about it is if I give a 1% discount, and there's sort of a. I'm making up numbers here, but this is just for illustrative purposes. Let's say I'm willing to sell you collateral at a 1% discount to the oracle price, and there is a 50% chance of there being a 90% drop in the asset, 50% chance of a 50% drop and 1% chance of a 90% drop. In the case where I have the 90% drop, that 1% incentive won't be sufficiently high because there's a lot of volatility in the asset.
00:10:07.756 - 00:10:55.170, Speaker D: There's likely not going to be much liquidity at that time. And so what you're really trading off is like probability of bad debt, which is based on probability of a really tail event where there's no liquidity versus being cheap, like not having the lenders lose much money on this liquidation. And so in this vein, there's a lot of different parameters. You can tune in these protocols, whether it's liquidation threshold. So do we start liquidating them early? So that means sort of like, if your health factor is not one, if it's like 1.5, you start getting slowly liquidated to push you back up to 1.1. A lot of the newer lending protocols, a lot of lending protocols that have amm shares as collateral do things like this.
00:10:55.170 - 00:12:14.472, Speaker D: And another interesting point is, if I have a very lossy oracle price, then I can't make those parameters as aggressive in the sense that I have to give a higher discount if I have to tolerate some volatility in the oracle price because as I said earlier, the discount is sort of tied to some notion of uncertainty over some time interval, whether it's price uncertainty, liquidity uncertainty, things of those form. And the hope, I think, with an oracle, where the price that someone is conveying to pay to back run or front run, the oracle is that it should be giving you some signal about this extra protocol information, like the liquidity information. Like if someone is not willing to pay much, then that means there's not as much liquidity because they have a ton of costs to source that liquidity. And so the hope is that with this extra information, these protocols don't have to spend as much in the long run. It remains to be seen, because historically, oracle volatility relative to centralized exchange is insanely high. And so maybe I'll stop there because that was like a long lot of stuff.
00:12:14.526 - 00:12:56.470, Speaker A: Well, Truan, God, I love the way you explain things, too, but let me put some concrete numbers around some of what Truan's saying for the readers here, too. So Truan talked about this concept of a fire sale, and you just have to make sure, I'll use his favorite word, bad debt. You have to make sure bad debt gets liquidated. So Ave right now sells their collateral at between a five and 10% discount to the chainlink price when it comes in. So if a liquidation gets triggered by a chain link price, they sell it at a discount. It depends on the asset. These are parameters that you can tune, but it's between five and 10%.
00:12:56.470 - 00:13:38.276, Speaker A: And if you think about it, it doesn't cost 10% to sell that collateral. They're just inserting that threshold because they need to make sure it gets done. So what oval is doing via running this med share auction is we're inserting a market mechanism to actually price how much that discount should be per liquidation. And to put concrete numbers like Ave v two and v three have liquidated about $1.2 billion of collateral. These are numbers our teams pulled. And of that $1.2
00:13:38.276 - 00:14:19.136, Speaker A: billion in collateral, the average discount is like 5%. It's been like $62 million of discounts that Ave's paid to get that collateral liquidated, that collateral sold, and there's going to be some cost to selling that collateral. But it's not $62 million worth. It's far smaller than that compound v two and v three. It's about the same. About a billion dollars of collateral has been liquidated, and they've paid about 71 million of discounts by our calculations, too. And again, that's just way more than they need to pay.
00:14:19.136 - 00:14:36.900, Speaker A: So the entire concept here is now we get more price information, more signal, by running this auction, this competitive auction of searchers bidding for how much they want to buy this discounted collateral for, we're able to recapture that MeV and redirect it back to the protocol.
00:14:39.100 - 00:15:17.556, Speaker B: Okay, that's really helpful. Basically, just to sum up in even just five year old type language, from the ave perspective, there's an imperative to liquidate if we want to call it bad debt, pricey, whatever we want to call it. We don't want to be on the hook for this position. And in theory, the more volatile the price of the asset is, the more room for margin of error you need to give yourself. And you're kind of flying blind, right? You don't exactly know how to price that. So you're saying to arbitrage yours or anyone who's going to come in and liquidate, like, hey, I don't really know how much it's going to be to incentivize you to come do this, but I really don't want to take this risk. So let's say 10%.
00:15:17.556 - 00:15:43.128, Speaker B: So with the addition of this suave sort of auction, we can just get more granular pricing information. How should we think about this from the ave perspective? What does the actual flow of funds look like? Is this reducing a cost for AAve? Is this an additional stream of revenue for AAve? How would you actually characterize this? I guess it kind of nets out to the same thing. But how would you characterize this from the ave perspective?
00:15:43.304 - 00:17:11.500, Speaker D: It's sort of two things, and I think one thing that's worth pointing out as a technical note is it's not immediately obvious that this will lead to a huge discount. In fact, because there's sort of this weird trade off that occurs in these liquidation auctions, where the average liquidation auction will have a lot of very good signal, where people are basically bidding what they think the liquidity elsewhere is, but the liquidation auction on very edge case scenarios. So, like when Igorov was almost defaulting on curve, when November 2022 style stuff, stuff that happened when staked etH was deviated from par note, I didn't use the word pegging, despite the idiotic usage of the word pegging, for something that shouldn't be pegged, that doesn't have a natural peg. And there's kind of this thing where in the worst case scenarios, it may not actually improve pricing for liquidations. But in the average case scenario, it does improve pricing. So there's kind of this trade off of, like, in the worst case scenarios, people are even afraid to bid high because the centralized exchange, they can't clear the other side on the centralized exchange or a Dex, because there's not as much liquidity. So I would view this as a way of reducing average costs.
00:17:11.500 - 00:18:08.216, Speaker D: So, like, the average liquidation that exists will generally have lower costs. The worst case liquidations probably don't change as much. And you should really be characterizing this as sort of this trade off between how much does the protocol value bad debt at a certain size. So, like, if I have a million dollar loan versus $100 million loan, the $100 million loan's bad debt is worth x to the protocol, and the 1 million is probably worth less than x over 100, right. Because its relative size, relative to the total liquidity supply is quite high. So because of that, you sort of can view the savings as implicitly the market defining this trade off curve for the protocol of how much it's valuing each loan and the discount on the loan. And you could think of the market as pricing this for the lenders, because the lenders are passive generally, right? In these protocols you set in, forget it.
00:18:08.216 - 00:18:29.330, Speaker D: You put your cash in, and you hope that there's not too many liquidations, but there's some sense in which what you're doing is trying to make the market do some active management for the lenders, for these passive lenders. And that's why I'm saying, on the average case, it does a good job. In the worst case, though, it's not totally clear it helps that much.
00:18:29.940 - 00:19:59.230, Speaker A: The way I would simplify what Trune is saying, though, is what we are doing is delaying free access to the chain link price by three slots, by 36 seconds, although there's still free access just through this auction mechanism. And so the trade off from the protocol is you're really just capturing this free money. You're having the market price, how much they value running this liquidation. And I agree with Tarun, there's, like, edge cases where maybe it does actually cost a lot to liquidate that collateral. Like, maybe it costs 7% of your 10%, but you still are using a market and an auction mechanism to recapture the excess or the remainder. And I got actually, one analogy that I'm kind of curious if both quintess and Truan agree with here, too, because I was thinking about this more, and most of the people in the ecosystem now know that if you were to go into Uniswap and try to sell a million dollars of eth, and you put in a 7% slippage number in your Uniswap trade, and didn't use any mev protection, most people know that you'd lose 7%. You're going to get sandwiched and lose, and pay the worst possible price.
00:19:59.230 - 00:20:42.284, Speaker A: And essentially, I look at what, and I'm curious if Trin agrees with this, but when a lot of these lending protocols auction off collateral, they're effectively doing that. They're sending, like, it's like a Uniswap Dex trade with a really wide slippage window, and that hurts. They get the worst possible execution. What flashbots did with flashbots protect. So, flashbots protect is like the consumer version of this Mevshare order flow auction infrastructure. And flashbots protect lets users, when they send their Uniswap Dex trades, run an order flow auction to recapture this mev that they might lose. And they're trying to.
00:20:42.284 - 00:21:26.490, Speaker A: Like in this example I have with the Uniswap trade, with 7% slippage, flashbots protect should run an auction to recapture most of that. What oval is kind of doing here is doing the similar thing for flashbots protect, but for transactions that originate from the protocol. So, here, transactions that originate from a lending protocol. And maybe we can talk in a second about how it could be extended to other use cases, too. But I'm curious what quintess and drew think about this analogy of saying, hey, we're basically this unprotected Dex trade on uniswap. And if you agree with that, kind of, that's what avian and compound are doing, and how oval, sort of analogous to flashpots protect here.
00:21:27.740 - 00:21:37.452, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. We actually see this a lot with people trading shitcoins, where they'll set a big slippage limit and sort of allow themselves.
00:21:37.506 - 00:21:40.300, Speaker D: Give us a technical definition of a shitcoin.
00:21:41.280 - 00:21:47.200, Speaker C: Yeah, just look up my ens. You can see some examples.
00:21:49.380 - 00:22:02.340, Speaker D: Okay, so the definition of a shitcoin, just for formality's sake, is any coin quintus owns, if you want to brand your coin a shitcoin, just send his ens a little bit of your supply.
00:22:06.120 - 00:22:07.750, Speaker A: No, don't do that.
00:22:13.340 - 00:23:07.108, Speaker C: Here. A useful definition for shitcoin is something that's high volatility, right? So, when people are trading these shitcoins, often they'll set a high slippage limit, because there's a lot of competition to access the, I guess maybe a specific form of high volatility. But they're trying to access a price that is set at the top of the block, or really they don't even need the top of the block price, they just need to get in the block. And because there's so much competition, because the token is pumping or whatever, it's not clear how to get in the block. And you could directly pay a bribe to the miner or validator or blockbuilder, however you want to think about it. But instead, it's just easier for speculators to set their subject numbers high, get sandwiched, and then get included in the block. And it's exactly this kind of trade off you were talking about, where it's like risk versus quality of execution.
00:23:07.108 - 00:23:16.380, Speaker C: And so they're willing to take a worse price as long as this thing just gets done, which is the trade off you were describing for lending protocols. So I think that captures it quite nicely.
00:23:17.440 - 00:24:01.340, Speaker D: I think one tiny caveat I would give to this is that I think there's a big difference between liquidations that are of low liquidity coins versus high liquidity coins. And in the high liquidity coins, I think you could argue that the slippage limit might as well be zero because there's sufficient liquidity and sufficiently many people sandwiching that it comes out to net to zero. But for the very low liquidity coins, I think that's where you get the biggest benefit. And that's because you effectively have to trade with a high slippage to even kind of fulfill those orders.
00:24:01.920 - 00:24:15.040, Speaker A: But true just on that, though, just because the analogy here is like if Ave and compound are selling collateral of mostly very high liquidity assets, right? But they're selling it with high slippage limits.
00:24:16.820 - 00:24:31.270, Speaker D: They are selling it with high slippage limits. But I think, again, the problem is you're picking a static sell rate for something that depends on market conditions, right? And arguably, the point of the auction is to try to correct that.
00:24:32.280 - 00:24:52.380, Speaker C: You could think of. Sorry, Tara, I feel like you can think of the auction as like a second oracle that imports some more market information. So you get the chain link, oracle, it's saying, oh, you know, you should probably liquidate, and then you're doing another check. Okay, but at what rate should I liquidate? Basically, yeah.
00:24:52.450 - 00:25:23.540, Speaker A: Quintess, that's actually a pretty cool way of thinking about it. It's like the chainlink, Oracle is what triggers your liquidation, right? So that's saying. Yeah, and super robust liquidation needs to happen. Chain link, it's not particularly granular. Like those updates are relatively infrequent, but they're super secure. Right. And then I do like that this oval auction is the second auction about what should we actually pay to liquidate this collateral?
00:25:26.040 - 00:25:56.892, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, one important thing, and this is why I bring up this notion of the average case versus worst case, is order flow. Auctions in general are sort of like, you can't really make them incentive compatible. There's a lot of ways that the bidders can collude. If they collude, then the bids are not really reflecting the true market information. But collusion sounds much worse, right? It sounds like there's this nefarious discord channel where everyone is trying to fuck each other. It's a little less like that. It's more oftentimes they're colluding indirectly.
00:25:56.892 - 00:26:39.512, Speaker D: The cost of liquidity just went up. So they're all lowering their bids because they went on binance and they can't sell anything. A ton of people got liquidated on binance. So now there's just no kind of resting orders on the other side. So there's a sense in which these types of mechanisms are good as a second oracle when people are reporting close to truthfully what they see in the cases that they don't. So again, when there's no liquidity, then there's sort of like the amount of information you're getting goes to zero. And so this is why I think the correct way to think about these things is they're really good at these average case behaviors.
00:26:39.512 - 00:27:41.824, Speaker D: And in these worst case behaviors, though, you still need other mechanisms. And I think this is where a lot of the innovation in lending protocols lately has been happening, is some protocols, like compound v three, for instance, will hold some of the position for a longer period of time. And then if you look at some of the other lending protocols, like the morphos of the world, ajna, et cetera, they actually are willing to tolerate some amount of, quote, bad debt for some amount of time indirectly. And they can kind of do this type of more passive thing where they wait and see, hey, will the market correct before we immediately sell? Because one sort of problem for these protocols is the time that they are forced selling, even at a discount, is also the time the market is going down. So they could cause this spiral effect, right? Like they sell cause price to go down, cause other liquidations happen. Right. That's like the worst know that's maker black Thursday type of thing.
00:27:41.824 - 00:28:22.350, Speaker D: Right. But I think the idea of this holding positions longer piece, I think in a lot of ways that is one of the things that in the new lending protocols, you're seeing a lot of kind of interesting takes on liquidation mechanisms that do that where the protocol holds more risk. And I think there's kind of this two pronged approach of things like improving the true price dynamically by having market participants convey it, plus, also having the protocols hold some risk on their own is probably like the future in the long run.
00:28:24.160 - 00:29:17.356, Speaker B: So I want to sort of drill down here and tie off the sort of benefit from the AvE protocol perspective, but also like the Ave users perspective. And then I want to kind of zoom out and focus on this trend of protocols recapturing the MeV that they generate. So basically, to sum up, what I've heard from all of you is that I really like also that analogy. Quintus as oval is basically a second oracle where you're allowing more. Basically, you're facilitating more granular pricing of liquidations. And that could be based on the volatility of the asset, that could be based on the size of the position, whatever that ultimately ends up being. What I would guess is that that's ultimately a net benefit to ave from the perspective of not taking on risk, but also basically quoting, being more forgiving in terms of liquidations for users.
00:29:17.356 - 00:29:30.188, Speaker B: I would guess from the perspective of Ave, they'll want to be liquidating their users. So if you have more granular access to pricing for their underlying loans, you could theoretically choose to liquidate less, right? I mean, is that accurate?
00:29:30.284 - 00:30:00.284, Speaker D: That's sort of this idea of the protocol, holding more risk. Got it. They'd be willing to tolerate health factor. Like, suppose you got liquidated at health factor equals one. Health factor is just sort of the ratio of the value of your collateral to your debt. With some correction. Sometimes, say you get liquidated health factor one, maybe the protocol instead says, hey, we'll hold your position, but you can't withdraw until health factor 0.9.
00:30:00.284 - 00:30:39.904, Speaker D: If it goes below 0.9, we start selling. If it stays below one and above 0.9, for a while, we just liquidate you slowly until you go above one. Right? And that's what I mean by most the new designs you see kind of try to do the soft liquidation piece, which boils down if you squint enough to the protocol holding risk. Right, the protocol is holding a bad debt position. But again, just like pegging is a fucking stupid concept for a liquid staking derivative, bad debt is also a bad concept because it makes it sound like, oh, you should never be holding risk.
00:30:39.904 - 00:31:06.390, Speaker D: Well, this fucking thing is a trading strategy, just like any deFi protocol. It's a trading strategy with users, and it obviously has to have some risk. I think this all comes from some hocus pocus bullshit version of the world where everyone thinks, like, there are some God dictum laws like steeth has to be greater than one. Always.
00:31:09.160 - 00:31:12.464, Speaker C: You're making me more likely to say bad dead.
00:31:12.512 - 00:31:19.796, Speaker D: Now, I know that's the problem. I know I'm the mid curve, but.
00:31:19.818 - 00:32:00.596, Speaker A: I'm at least acknowledging Mike, you're going to have to do a whole episode on bad debt. And Turin, that's a whole other thing. But I think where I'm going to push Tarun to really agree is all of this more sophisticated mechanisms that we're talking about. They all require market based information to make those decisions. We could go deeper on some of these other designs, but how much of the bad debt the protocol should hold on to? You're going to want to use market participants to understand what the health ratio is and that sort of thing. And so essentially, you're going to end up running auctions. The way I look at this, you're always going to end up running auctions here.
00:32:00.596 - 00:32:46.908, Speaker A: And this goes a little bit. To know what Dan Robinson and your last is, if there's any problem you kind of hit in crypto, the right answer is just to add an auction. That's how you solve it. So right now, if I zoom out here and think about again the direction we're going, and then maybe we can tie this back into oval capture or, sorry, medcapture. Generally, this is another mechanism for a protocol originated transaction to run an order flow auction. And that's sort of what oval is doing. And I think it's the first step in a bunch of directions where we could be getting auction based information back into DeFi protocols or others.
00:32:47.094 - 00:33:47.428, Speaker B: Yeah, so Hart, totally agree with that. But if I could just even go one. The ultimate problem that auctions are trying to solve is a redistribution of MeV. The idea is that there's kind of like Ethereum is this neutral platform and apps get built on it, and these apps create a lot of mev of extractable value. And if you look at the way that the supply chain and Ethereum is set up today, if you tried to look at who ultimately is maybe getting paid too much and extracting a disproportionate amount of that value, I think what most people that are close to that supply chain would say is ultimately it's the proposer, right? So from the perspective of someone like, could be uniswap, could be Aave, could be an NFT trading platform. Whatever it is, the creators of these inefficiencies that ultimately end up getting arbed out. You can make a really strong argument that that value should flow back either to the protocol or to the users who've frankly been getting a pretty poor ux experience for a really long time.
00:33:47.428 - 00:34:00.680, Speaker B: And so I think that's why something like Mev share and swab is exciting, because the auctions are the mechanism of redistributing that value away from proposers. I don't know if you guys would agree with that underlying.
00:34:01.760 - 00:34:55.950, Speaker A: I mean, I'm actually again, curious what Turin and Quintus think, but kind of my mental model for this is like, you think of a lot of these protocols, they create this mev exhaust. It's like you use the protocol. A user using the protocol in a natural way is creating transactions that have some reorg or censorship or otherwise type value that we're calling meV. And the more you use the protocol, the more mev is created. And the bigger picture model is like, well, okay, if we can design mechanisms that actually recapture this mev exhaust, we can use it to improve the protocol. And that could be like, make the fees cheaper for users, pay for costs. Like one of the goals for Oval is to actually pay Chainlink for the costs of providing their oracle service.
00:34:55.950 - 00:35:29.850, Speaker A: Or you can imagine like you use the oval rev in Aave to lower or reimburse gas fees for using the Aave protocol. We made it better. Or you use it as a revenue stream. So Ave token holders earn the MEV from the protocol, and now we have a cool business model for how AavE is going to support itself. So yeah, I think that's super interesting where we're using MEV to power as either a business model or to improve the product.
00:35:30.460 - 00:36:49.216, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. I think another way of stating this, coming back to what Mike was saying, is that there actually is always an auction for these things. It's just that the auctioneer is the validator because they have the sort of monopoly rights to do these liquidations and sandwich and I guess whatever arbitrage, whatever strategy you care about and what the sort of protocol Mev capture discussion is saying is saying like, hey, let's build an auction or build some mechanism to redirect that value so the auctioneer doesn't end up being the proposer. And this is really interesting because I think there's a different school of thought which has said, listen, there's no way we can escape the proposer. As the auctioneer, we can't escape all this value flowing to validators and not to the applications or to the users. So we're going to build app chains and have those be integrated, have the validators and the applications sort of be the same kind of thing. And having application level MEV capture without having app chains is, I think without needing to launch a new chain, is a really strong response from the sort of general chain side of things.
00:36:49.216 - 00:37:05.430, Speaker C: And so, if we can get more applications capturing the MEV, or doing these kinds of hybrid off chain on chain solutions, using them to capture meV, then the sort of chains like Ethereum look a lot more appealing than app.
00:37:07.800 - 00:38:25.650, Speaker A: Know one thing to expand on, quintess, like, I was talking to Mike about this a little bit before too, but it doesn't really make sense using your app chain analogy, it doesn't really make sense to make an app chain for your NFT collection. That seems like not really a good use of an app chain. Maybe I'm wrong, there's other NFT experts out there, but one natural extension of where something like oval goes, or what oval could do, would be to recapture a lot of the mev lost in NFT collection drops, like in an NFT mint or something like that. I'm not really an NFT expert, but I do know that at least in v, one of a lot of these drops, there's huge amount of just gas getting wasted and crazy prices or whatever. And you could instead be running oval auctions using Flashbot's MeV share infrastructure to recapture that. And then the NFT collection could decide what they want to do with it. And so to your for this is a use case where an app chain doesn't really make sense, but you can use all these similar concepts to recapture the MeV that your application, your use case, is leaking and do useful things with it, which I think is.
00:38:30.180 - 00:39:09.016, Speaker B: A one question. We haven't really focused as much on the flashbots component of what this auction actually looks like. But one question, quintess, that I've been trying to at least think about for a little while, is the value proposition here of very general sort of order flow auctions, like swab versus more app specific order flow auctions. And you can sort of see uniswap moving in that direction. So I guess, are we just seeing two? There could be sort of two different market structures here where for someone like Ave, like, hey, I'm leaking a whole bunch of MeV through my liquidations process. I'm not getting granular pricing sort of information. I want to get that redirected back to my protocol.
00:39:09.016 - 00:39:24.210, Speaker B: So I'm just going to plug into suave, as opposed to Uniswap, who has clearly said, I'd like to build that internally myself. So could you expand a little bit on how you think about app specific versus general order flow auctions and then how that market structure eventually ends up shaking out?
00:39:24.580 - 00:40:27.976, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think there's some small details which separate these kind of auctions at the moment. Does it happen in one transaction or two? And these feel like sort of more like implementation details, and maybe they rely. There's some trust assumptions which are specific to the applications we have now, but it's something which I think, in the long run, isn't that important. What separates something like Mevshare from Unisoft X, like you were saying, is that Unisoft X is basically something for filling limit orders, whereas Mev share is this general protocol for saying like, hey, I have a transaction. Just going to create some state transition, and you can sort of bid to back around this transaction. I think Tarun, probably based on some of his work before, agrees that in the long run, having different kinds of auctions for different use cases makes sense. And in some sense, that's what overland is doing.
00:40:27.976 - 00:41:36.668, Speaker C: They're saying, listen, we have a specific kind of auction for blending protocols. Yes, we're using this general MeV share platform, but, okay, we're going to add some details in where after 36 seconds or after some parameter that the protocol can choose, the auction sort of terminates. And if we didn't send the unlocked transaction that people are trying to backrun, then everything goes back to normal and the protocol is safe and the bad debt can be liquidated. Maybe just to connect this with the whole flashbots direction. Yes, we're running MeV share now, but I think we also think that there's going to be some need for differentiation of auctions, and that's why we're building a general platform for defining these kinds of things, so that different protocols or different use cases can go and say, okay, well, I need an auction, but it looks a little bit like this, or it's a little bit different in this way, and you can fork some auction pattern that's already available and make the tweaks you want to make, and do this in a relatively trustless or whatever decentralized way.
00:41:36.834 - 00:42:58.164, Speaker A: Quintess, can I interrupt you to strong agree on that? So suave is something that's out there, right? And look, you need a lot of podcast episodes to, I think, really understand suave. But my takeaway is it's going to be one of the things it can do is be a really useful service to program auctions or platform to program auctions. And I very much do think of oval as a very focused type of auction for oracle price updates. And I think that it can naturally expand to other types of protocol transactions types. And I think it's a very cool example of an example you can use today and start integrating today for the types of specialized auctions that something like suave might support in the future. And so I really like this as a natural progression where something like oval uses like rock solid trusted flashbots and Chainlink infrastructure today to allow you to capture mev. And it can be a little bit of a preview to the types of specialized auctions that you're able to run on suave in the future.
00:42:58.164 - 00:43:00.390, Speaker A: And so I think that's kind of cool.
00:43:02.940 - 00:43:52.196, Speaker D: Instead of giving a chorus of agreement, I will take the dialectic and also give the negative case. So I think for oracle auctions, it makes a ton of sense. There's sort of a notion of a bounded payoff that you can expect, right. You kind of know the absolute best payoff you can get. So you sort of also know a lot about how know, if I looked in hindsight at are people cheating? Are they colluding? It's actually very easy to attribute that they did that. And so there's sort of a nice story that like, hey, I have this measuring stick that I can benchmark people in the future to know if they're bad and I smack them by slashing them or something. Right? The problem is for the most general possible value functions like the most general possible payoffs.
00:43:52.196 - 00:44:42.888, Speaker D: When you have tons of uncertainty in the possibility of what transfers are made, what payments are made between different users, then it becomes much harder. Then these kind of auctions kind of stop working as well. And I think to some extent that is sort of the reason you have the intent uniswap x style part of the world, because that is trying to fulfill something where instead of trying to find the optimal sort of payoff, I'm willing to wait longer. And by waiting longer, someone can find something that satisfies my desire to trade something reasonably well. So I think there's kind of this duality. And for oracles, it's just an amazing use case because the thing you're bidding on is the thing that gives you the exact benchmark to price things by, right. It is the price information.
00:44:42.888 - 00:45:27.796, Speaker D: So you really can bound the best payoff and worst payoff. But there are examples, and I think routing in Amms sometimes has some properties like this where that's much harder to do because people could remove liquidity in front of you, people could and effectively change the optimal route. People can put trap tokens. I mean, I haven't heard so much about this in 2024, but in 2022 there were just so many of these finance smart chain rug pull tokens where basically they would fill a liquidity pool with a ton of this token. So it looked like a really good route to take when you're trading tokens. But then it turned out to have like a malicious transfer function. And then you transfer into a pool, and then you can't transfer out.
00:45:27.796 - 00:45:50.940, Speaker D: And then the pool operator pulls all liquidity and that would be how they rug pulled you. That's the type of stuff you have to worry about when dealing with much more complex payoffs versus an oracle. I get the benchmark. I know the payoff. I can tell you how the auction should work. So I would make sure that you think about this in terms of those clear. When you understand a payoff auction, good.
00:45:50.940 - 00:46:00.210, Speaker D: When you have a lot of uncertainty in the payoff auction, bad. And that's like my dumb left curve or description of what I think the trade off is.
00:46:01.940 - 00:46:32.030, Speaker B: That's a good thing to keep in mind. Hart, I know we've got to close down here pretty soon, so obviously oval is extremely relevant for sort of borrow lend protocols like Aave today. But can you give us a sense of who else this applies to? Maybe that would be slightly less obvious, like could be NFT platform, something like that. You mentioned being able to recapture some of the mev that leaks, like during a mint or something like that. But just trying to give a sense for folks who might be listening and working at these protocols, like where else this might apply.
00:46:32.640 - 00:47:07.030, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's kind of two directions to go here. First direction is anyone that uses a chain link price feed. And then of that there's like l one versus l two stuff. So if you use a chain link price feed on l one oval should consider using today. You should come talk to us about the use case. So the major use cases there are like the lending protocols, like auditing and compound and all the other ones, but there are others. So chain link price feeds that are leaking mev information oval can capture on ethereum main net today.
00:47:07.030 - 00:48:21.470, Speaker A: I think capturing this type of Oracle mev on l two s is very interesting. That's like something we're actively researching, but I think that there's a lot of value in perp dexes where there is still this latency game. This is like a deeper research topic and I actually think troon. I haven't talked to trune about this, but I bet he has real thoughts where the trading prices of these perp dexes and the actual real price on binance, there is some latency or some gap in there, and that is a form of meV or arbitrage that's getting lost. And I think there's kind of really cool ways to think about how you could capture that. So that's one direction that I think Oval gets excited about how to capture MeV from Chainlink price updates on L two s. And then the other direction, like I mentioned before, is not in the Oracle space, not in the price update space, but rather are there other types of protocol originated transactions that create a bunch of NeV and that if we were to run an auction around them, we could capture that.
00:48:21.470 - 00:48:53.944, Speaker A: And the ones that come to mind, obviously here are NFT drops where there's some transaction that originates from a protocol that is leaking Mev. I think there's probably a lot of others. And that's where I'm really excited to kind of be open and live about this, to get crypto Twitter's thoughts of where else we could capture Mev from protocol originated transactions. Quintess, I saw you smiling. Do you have a brilliant thought?
00:48:54.142 - 00:49:04.792, Speaker C: No, I don't have a brilliant thought, but I feel like I can summarize very nicely what Oval does. So I'll just do it in a sentence, which is we've always known.
00:49:04.936 - 00:49:07.420, Speaker D: Sorry, Hart, are you hiring for marketing?
00:49:10.240 - 00:49:11.790, Speaker A: Yeah, we are.
00:49:15.600 - 00:49:18.850, Speaker C: Turing's got me a job and some free shit coins today. It's great.
00:49:19.460 - 00:49:20.210, Speaker D: Amazing.
00:49:21.380 - 00:49:22.530, Speaker A: Red Bull, though.
00:49:22.900 - 00:49:26.160, Speaker D: Yeah. I still am waiting for the fridge. Red Bull, you fuckers.
00:49:28.100 - 00:50:00.860, Speaker C: You guys missed the pre show Tarun Red Bull rant. But anyway, I think so. We've always known how to run these auctions. What Uma has done really well is come in with Oval and said, listen, we want to do this in a minimally invasive way. And we introduced, like, a trusted actor assumption, but it really isn't that important because we have this window in which you're trusting the actor, and after which we fall back to the protocol acting as normal. And the next step or two that we should take is taking this trusted actor role and decentralizing that. And that's what I'm really excited about.
00:50:00.860 - 00:50:09.280, Speaker C: And once you've done that. You can build these pretty cool trustless protocols that do Mev capture for many applications on chain.
00:50:10.500 - 00:50:35.930, Speaker B: Yeah, well said there, quintess. I heart. I also like that question. Do you have any brilliant thoughts? I'm going to start using that on these podcasts. Just put people on the spot, raise the expectations. But we've got to wrap it up here. So hart, if there are devs or founders or protocols that are listening to this and think, hey, this might be relevant for me and what's the best way to get in touch with you or folks at the team?
00:50:36.540 - 00:51:31.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, first of all, our doc site, we actually put a lot of effort into our doc site explaining the mechanisms here too. So if you're like Quintess, go check out the doc site. It's Docs Oval XYZ. But if you are a protocol looking to integrate us, go to Oval XYZ and we have like contact us type form and we're going to be super responsive because we're really excited to hear about people's thoughts here and want to help you guys integrate this. The whole thing is like open source and permissionless and all that good stuff so you can go play yourself. But we want to help people out and handhold them through some of these first integrations because that's the right way to do it. And then follow me on Twitter and dm me and stuff like that.
00:51:32.240 - 00:51:32.652, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:51:32.706 - 00:51:49.250, Speaker D: I'm going to end with one last comment, which is I think Oval V two thing should be selling futures future auction rights or options on future rights. So I get to participate in the next auction, at least this price.
00:51:50.100 - 00:51:53.570, Speaker A: And here's how true nerd snipes people. Let's do it.
00:51:55.940 - 00:52:03.844, Speaker B: I think that's a good idea. Second that idea. As long as we're still using the egg as the meme for this, then I'm no.
00:52:03.962 - 00:52:06.900, Speaker D: Now, when you're buying the futures, you're buying the carton.
00:52:07.640 - 00:52:09.300, Speaker A: Carton of eggs.
00:52:09.720 - 00:52:10.920, Speaker B: The memes write themselves.
00:52:11.070 - 00:52:16.276, Speaker C: Why don't you buy the chicken? That seems a slightly cooler the chicken.
00:52:16.308 - 00:52:17.224, Speaker A: Before the egg man.
00:52:17.262 - 00:52:20.120, Speaker D: Chicken. I don't finance fan. I don't know. Good luck.
00:52:22.540 - 00:52:23.796, Speaker A: I didn't know it went this deep.
00:52:23.828 - 00:52:27.960, Speaker C: Guys, it seems like we should have ended the episode a minute ago.
00:52:28.030 - 00:52:35.020, Speaker B: I was going to say we went like one too far, I think. Let's just end while we're ahead. And guys, this has been a ton of fun. Congrats. Hearts on Oval Turin and Quentin.
