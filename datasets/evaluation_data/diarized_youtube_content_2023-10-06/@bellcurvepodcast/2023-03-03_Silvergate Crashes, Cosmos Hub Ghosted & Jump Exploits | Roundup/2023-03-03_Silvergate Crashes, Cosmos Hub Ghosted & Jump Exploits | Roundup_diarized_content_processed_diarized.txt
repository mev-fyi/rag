00:00:22.404 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker B: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.570 - 00:00:44.218, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two, Vance, and we've dropped the dead weight, so it's just three of us this week. I'm just kidding. I love you, buddy. He's holding down the fort. Do you guys send people down there or do you feel tempted to go to these things yourself?
00:00:44.304 - 00:01:04.766, Speaker B: We're usually at these things. We sent a couple of our people there, but ETH Denver is a fan favorite. It's a classic. In the last one before the Pandemic, I think it was literally held in like a parking garage that was like Astroturfed. It's just like a great builder conference, but could make it this year, hopefully next year.
00:01:04.788 - 00:01:07.806, Speaker A: That's a vibe. I heard there were 30,000 people registered.
00:01:07.998 - 00:01:28.834, Speaker B: Pretty nuts from what I hear. Just on Twitter. The vibe is very positive. There's a lot of people interested in ZK, there's a lot of people interested in L two S, D, five games. It's just great when you go to those conferences and you just get a renewed sense of vigor in the industry and just like the sense that it's not just you and 15 people on crypto, Twitter, it's actually a real industry.
00:01:28.882 - 00:01:31.126, Speaker A: Like actual people doing this. Yeah, I'm with you.
00:01:31.148 - 00:02:11.590, Speaker C: I think the biggest one for us, I don't know if you agree with this, Vance, but the one that we had the first experience of that feeling was DevCon permissionless. No, this was in 2019, before we knew you, mike DevCon, I think it was six in Osaka, where you literally had like 5000 people all talking about Ethereum, all talking about DFI, all the different announcements that were happening. And then you've got Vitalik and like 20 of the core Devs with these massive Japanese dancers and drums on stage. And it was one of those where you're like, I don't know what I just saw, but it was definitely interesting. And I feel like there's something happening here.
00:02:11.660 - 00:02:18.182, Speaker A: Well, the big news of the week is that, fellas, we're going bankless. We are going bankless.
00:02:18.246 - 00:02:19.926, Speaker B: Willingly bankless.
00:02:20.118 - 00:02:48.642, Speaker A: Not the way we thought it was going to go, but here we are. No, let's talk about Silvergate because that's actually relatively big news. The title of the story is that Silvergate was due to file its ten K on Wednesday. So we're recording this Thursday, the day after, and they said that they have failed to file. So shares are down. I think at the time of recording, it's down about 45%. Turns out Wall Street doesn't love it when you don't file your ten k just to give a history.
00:02:48.642 - 00:03:49.746, Speaker A: I think we've talked about Silvergate a little bit on this show, but Silvergate, they were a traditional bank, right? Kind of like a local, regional bank. And then they started getting into crypto around circa, I think like 2014, 2015. A couple of things to know first over time, their depositors, I think as of end of 2022, it's like 90% crypto firms, right? So that obviously creates a little bit of a risk from a deposit standpoint. The other thing to know about Silvergate is that they've built out very impactful and highly used infrastructure, especially on the exchange side of things. They have something called the Send network and that's how all of these kind of market makers and exchanges all talk to each other in after hours trading and they can send and deposit US dollars. So it's been kind of widely reported on that. They struggled near the end of last year they had an enormous kind of bank run which they processed by selling their debt securities, which is they're basically holding all those deposits in Treasuries in almost any year.
00:03:49.746 - 00:04:19.070, Speaker A: That would be totally fine. The problem was it was like the worst year for bonds in a couple of hundred years in the US. So I think the Wall Street Journal, they reported that they lost about $718,000,000 and apparently it's just getting worse this year. And then I guess the last bit of news to note there is that there have been a couple of tweets, coinbase basically tweeted that they were no longer doing business with Silvergate. And it's looking pretty bleak, at least as of today. I'm not sure. What do you guys think?
00:04:19.140 - 00:05:03.418, Speaker B: It's kind of like the classic bank run scenario where just the trust has broken down and people are now pulling deposits, they're cutting relationships, they're curtailing whatever activities they have ongoing with Silvergate. And Silvergate is primarily the main transaction bank for crypto. What that means is that when you actually withdraw money from Coinbase, they're actually sending it to your bank account from Silvergate. And now Signature is going to be that player. And Silvergate is a smaller bank as of today, a 300 million dollar market cap bank. Signature is about six and a half or 7 billion right now. And so the amount of concentration risk that they had within their crypto depositor section was gigantic.
00:05:03.418 - 00:05:47.722, Speaker B: And this is the risk of that type of concentration risk. The other thing that we've looked at, and this is not like the fixed income group of framework speaking. This is like Michael and I who don't have a ton of experience in looking at banks, just like reading the tea leaves on what we're know. It looks like they took all of their crypto deposits, put it know, pretty long duration credit and then got worked on that once rates rised. And Arthur Hayes put out a tweet today. That said, really all you needed to do was take USD deposits from crypto firms, buy super short duration or at least like mixed duration credit, and then not get blown up or have to be a forced seller when rates rise just because you have a little bit more duration diversity in your book. That does not appear to be what they did.
00:05:47.722 - 00:06:09.202, Speaker B: It appears to be the exact opposite, where they just took massive concentration risk and very long dated stuff and then got blown out. So I don't know actually how mechanically an insolvency of a bank like Silvergate would work. I don't even know if they're there yet and they haven't issued a going concern warning yet. They issued a warning that they might issue a warning of being a going concern, but it's certainly not looking great.
00:06:09.256 - 00:06:49.870, Speaker C: The thing that Vance just mentioned was the thing that I was going to double click into, which is they didn't file their ten K, which is their annual report. They paused and they said that they would be filing it shortly. But it has something in it that they are concerned about the potential for going concern in the next twelve months. Which means that they need to be able to work out some of the risk factors. They need to work out some of the disclosures. They need to basically spend time with lawyers and bankers to say what is actually something that we can reasonably put forward and sign our names on the dotted line to say, these are the reasonable risks. These are the reasonable disclosures that we have to make to all potential shareholders.
00:06:49.870 - 00:07:25.946, Speaker C: The market is reacting to that. As Van said, it's down whatever percent today. I haven't checked it in a few hours, but it was down 30% after hours yesterday. Broadly speaking, though, it will be interesting to see. Do they actually have issues with drawing? Do they actually have issues with liquidity? There is a difference between something getting oversold and an actual insolvency. It's not like the bank is luna and it's propping up its customer deposits with its equity. That's not how banks work.
00:07:25.946 - 00:07:39.930, Speaker C: Regulated banks that is. So there is something to that. It's just a question of how much loss can they take before they become truly underwater? So that's kind of like the big question mark, I would say, that needs to be resolved.
00:07:40.010 - 00:08:23.422, Speaker A: I don't really know how this works either, but Silvergate has been, I think, actually going into Tuesday or Wednesday, it was the most shorted stock in the US. It was like 81% of its shares were sold short. And there's some kind of rule where if the auditor is sort of presented with I forget there's a very specific kind of legal term for what it is, then they have to investigate. So Elizabeth Warren has kind of specifically singled out Silvergate. Mark Cajotes, you know, I've seen him on Twitter kind of giving interviews. He's a pretty well known short seller. There's a lot of mean I'm with you in the sense it's very far cry from luna, but not filing a ten K is definitely there's probably cause for legitimate concern there.
00:08:23.476 - 00:08:46.674, Speaker C: Elizabeth Warren put out a letter today about this. She's calling this out directly. And at least the thought is that there's a lot of people who have, as you said, 81% short interest, a financial interest in this thing going down. So I don't know where the box stops or where this thing ends, but I do think that there are a lot of incentivized parties on both sides here.
00:08:46.712 - 00:09:22.762, Speaker B: Two other things I think are important. So MicroStrategy is a large counterparty of Silvergate, and they put out a tweet today that says, we have a loan from Silvergate not due until Q One 2025. Their market concerns re silvergate. For anyone wondering, the loan wouldn't accelerate because of si insolvency or bankruptcy. Our BTC collateral isn't custody with silvergate. So it's not like they have a bunch of they definitely have a lot of credit exposure to the industry, but the industry doesn't really have a ton of collateral exposure to silvergate. It does have implications where it's going to be harder to withdraw money, maybe harder to do create redeem with things like USDC.
00:09:22.762 - 00:10:16.210, Speaker B: But this is not like a death spiral scenario for really anyone other than silvergate if they have gotten blown out as bad as some people are saying. So that's one thing. I think the other one that I was watching a few weeks ago is you had this weird motley crew of characters getting on both sides of Silvergate. You had Brendan Bloomer as I think, like a 9% shareholder. You had Block One as a 9% shareholder, and then you had like Citadel and BlackRock Citadel, and you had a couple of other of the big boys. And there's certain rules about owning shares of a bank where if you cross seven and a half percent or something like that I don't know the exact regulations I'm paraphrasing here, but you might also become a bank in terms of your reporting requirements, and that's not fun for anybody. So it's not like you can have Block One double or triple their ownership.
00:10:16.210 - 00:10:45.066, Speaker B: You're kind of capped in terms of the offensive side of silvergate. On the other side of Silvergate, you had George Soros and his fund shorting it, and so you had kind of like these two camps lining up against each other. And this was when Silvergate was at like 15. It was just weird to see that. You don't really ever see that, especially with TradFi people taking stances in crypto. It was interesting, but it looks so far like the Soros side is know.
00:10:45.088 - 00:11:16.014, Speaker A: To address, kind of know to maybe stand up for silvergate a little bit. Know, I also read that Arthur Hayes tweet generally when I see people kind of making those tweets from the cheap seats. It's like, okay, dude, you weren't actually in a position to run that bank. There was probably a really good reason why that was the know. But thanks for the input. So that was kind of my reaction to that, to be honest. I also think my read on Silvergate, this is totally an anecdote, so take that for what it's worth, but I've interacted with that team pretty frequently.
00:11:16.014 - 00:12:03.682, Speaker A: They always came off as pretty professional and like, they knew what they were doing. And to your point, Vance, about these sort of people kind of lining up and then taking individual mean, sometimes companies are the casualty of these powerful shareholders who have these own weird battles, right? And definitely Silvergate, I think, is they probably made some mistakes, but I think they're getting caught up in something that's a little bit bigger than themselves. The last point I want to make about this is Silvergate is one of those companies where you guys probably heard this a lot. In crypto we invest in picks and shovels businesses, right? And those are supposed to be less risky than the underlying assets they're based off. Go take a look at where Silvergate has landed relative to its all time high and then go look at how Bitcoin and ETH have done from their all time highs. That's just not how it works. It's not how it plays out.
00:12:03.736 - 00:12:55.540, Speaker B: It's like that whole picks and shovels. Oh yeah, like the regulated businesses of crypto, those are like catnip to growth investors and Silicon Valley people. And just take a step back and think about the lived experience of those investors over the past twelve months, where they were like, yeah, crypto is coming, but we're going to regulate it and we're going to be the good guys. And then fast forward twelve months, it's like you invested in DCG, you invested in FTX, you invested in Silvergate, you invested in even, frankly, Coinbase. All of these things have just gotten completely worked versus Ethan Bitcoin, which are honestly not doing that bad relative. So it's unfortunate ethan Bitcoin aren't bad, but all of the incentives now are for the traditional VCs, not to allocate to these regulated plays and for everyone else to go the exact opposite direction offshore. Decentralized and decentralized is good and bad, but that's the way the winds are blowing at the moment.
00:12:56.550 - 00:13:53.922, Speaker A: We've kind of talked about this broadly as being called like Operation Choke Point, at least by people in crypto. There was also kind of rumblings from Signature, so there was an announcement from Kraken that they were going to be limiting transactions of certain sizes from Signature. And Signature and Silvergate are two very systemically important banks for crypto. They're kind of the smaller banks that really leaned in and offered banking services to the exchanges and the funds and kind of the CeFi infrastructure that powers a lot of crypto or regulated crypto based out of the US. And that's coming under a significant duress, which probably poses a lot of real challenges for big companies in crypto. I'd just be curious, how much of a worry is this overall for the industry? And then I guess yeah, I mean, Vance, you were just saying this kind of pushes people out. That is the incentive for founders and companies, right? Why would you want to domicile in the United States right now given this environment?
00:13:53.986 - 00:14:50.166, Speaker C: I think there's two things there's creating the on ramps and off ramps and having that be something that is a stable and reliable solution. Silvergate has been one. I mean, with their Sen network or the Silvergate Exchange network, that was something that was probably the most widely used rails to move money around in the crypto space, even though it wasn't even crypto. Rails signature has been probably the number two in terms of notoriety of which banks support crypto. And there's only probably one or two, maybe three others. Other than that, that will take you on as a customer, as a client, if you have anything related to crypto and what you're doing. Anecdotally I've heard of a couple of friends, one who is starting a new fund, one who is working on a new project and they're having a difficult time getting banking services and it's not going to be impossible, but it's just taking a really long time.
00:14:50.166 - 00:15:48.422, Speaker C: It's unclear as to who they have to talk to, the KYC partner, the different hoops and ladders that they have to go through to get this bank account just so that they can put the money that has already been committed to them so they can pay people salaries. The Operation Choke Point, I don't think that it's a concerted effort and I think it's really coincidental that all of this is happening at the same time. But I do think that it is serious if we lose the rails, I don't think we're going to lose the rails in totality. We may lose access to certain rails, but I think there's just going to be others that are going to step in and fill that gap. And I can't remember if it was the OCC or if it was the Fed who put out a note maybe a week or two ago as all of this was happening, there was sort of a rumor that Operation Choke Point was happening. I think it was the Fed who said it's not illegal to bank crypto companies. Crypto companies are fine and it's up to the same standards of KYC.
00:15:48.422 - 00:16:19.400, Speaker C: Anti mudder laundering, anti money laundering, bank secrecy, act violations. Like those are the things that they care about. We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. And these are not two and the same. So I think that there is a movement to not cut off an entire industry from the banking industry. And there's a desire to not let that happen. There just has to be clarity and frankly, I think this is one of those things that I think more than likely will blow over eventually, but it will be something that drags for a bit, but it's not going to kill anything.
00:16:19.850 - 00:17:08.354, Speaker A: I would agree with that too. To sort of take the perspective of an outsider, I can see the perspective of, well, what did you guys expect? We definitely have some sins to atone for as an industry. It sucks. I mean, SBF was definitely the this was probably blowback from SBF. I can only speak anecdote. I went down to DC two times and the first time I went down was right after SBF and everyone was kind know this happens and we know that fraud happens and this doesn't necessarily reflect on the industry. Then I went down a second time and it was kind of like, actually we're a little pissed, was sort of the just this is sort of the natural way that things go and there's always going to be some blowback and this too shall pass I think is the way I think about it.
00:17:08.472 - 00:17:45.440, Speaker B: Ultimately, I think it's for the better. This still is a huge prize to bank this industry, to be the bank of stablecoin creation redemption, to be the bank that does the internetwork transfers. I think this stuff is like getting exposed to a cold every once in a while. Just makes your immune system stronger. That's kind of what you need. You don't really want to get hit with something out of the blue and not be able to handle it at like do I think Silvergate Bank was the banking partner of the future for crypto? Honestly, probably not. I'm hoping that JPMorgan Bank of America, one of the large retail depository institutions, steps up.
00:17:45.440 - 00:18:05.718, Speaker B: Signature bank is frankly like a step in the right direction. It's 20 times the size. It doesn't have the same customer concentration risk. Frankly, it probably has better management. So I can see the silver lining. This is like a year of a lot of silver linings. Like, yes, there's a huge dark, ominous fucking cloud, but look, there's a rainbow behind that and you have to squid to see it.
00:18:05.718 - 00:18:10.054, Speaker B: And it might not actually be there, but you have to take it for what it's worth.
00:18:10.252 - 00:18:21.680, Speaker C: One of the things we keep on saying internally, but also with portfolio companies is like, this is a year of bend, don't break. It's going to be a tough year. There's going to be a lot of shit that we have to deal with, but we're not going a break and we're just going to continue.
00:18:23.890 - 00:18:30.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think the toughest part about Sobergate is they had a bald CEO. So suddenly that just doesn't work as an indicator anymore.
00:18:31.490 - 00:18:33.040, Speaker B: What else can we trust?
00:18:33.410 - 00:18:38.942, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the year of hair. Year of hair, my friends. Framework is poised.
00:18:39.086 - 00:18:39.954, Speaker B: Look at what's going on.
00:18:39.992 - 00:18:41.038, Speaker A: The lettuce.
00:18:41.214 - 00:18:42.286, Speaker B: Good Lord.
00:18:42.478 - 00:19:18.286, Speaker A: Oh, boy. All right, let's move past this. I want to talk about this is kind of a cool story and I'm doing a little bit of a shilling our own book because Blockworks broke it, but there was a counter exploit on the Wormhole situation. So basically the background is mean. Wormhole was hacked a while ago for a pretty large number, and Jump kind of stepped in and backstopped it. One of our analysts, Dan Smith. So credit to Dan was just as one does just analyzing wrap steep transfers, noticed a huge as one does on like a Friday night.
00:19:18.286 - 00:20:11.930, Speaker A: He was doing this at like 03:00 A.m. With a psycho, but he noticed a $220,000,000 transfer, which is obviously a gigantic outlier, and he kind of traced everything out, how they actually did this. It was very clever and it's frankly beyond my five year old brain. So we'll link the free report of how it actually happened in the show notes, but it was kind of a sophisticated counter exploit that was leveraged on something called Oasisdao. And after this all came out, oasis announced that they received, quote, an order from the High Court of England and Wales to take all necessary steps that would result in the retrieval of certain assets involved with the wallet address associated with the Wormhole exploit. So part of this was some pretty sophisticated financial engineering and know how from the Jump team, but there was definitely a legal back channel that was involved as well. And Oasis basically said, hey, we had to comply, essentially.
00:20:11.930 - 00:20:27.122, Speaker A: So there are a couple takes from the more idealistic corners of DeFi, which was, hey, this is a betrayal of the promise of DeFi. I'd be curious just what you guys thought about the whole exploit, and then if that rings true at all.
00:20:27.176 - 00:20:49.562, Speaker B: Oasis and MakerDAO are not the same thing. And not to get too into the details here, but when you do a Maker Vault, you are putting up ETH, you are drawing dai. It's totally permissionless. No one can take your position, alter it. That's one thing. Oasis is entirely another. Oasis in the US actually used to have a broker dealer license way back in the day.
00:20:49.562 - 00:21:39.926, Speaker B: People either forgot about this or didn't know about it, but that's a centralized company. And the UI that Oasis offers you if you're going to open a Maker vault is you open it through them and it is through a different smart contract. But you have all these different bugs and bells and whistles that you can put on the contract itself. Do you want to multiply your leverage? Do you want to add a trailing stop loss? Do you want to have an auto liquidation price? That's arbitrary. You can do all of that different stuff. And what's funny is that I think that the thing that caused the Oasis contract to be able to be exploited on whoever stole the ETH's behalf was the fact that they used a trailing stop loss when they were trying to lever up a wrap Steeth position. And what's the moral of the story there? Pros don't use hedges, I think is the first one.
00:21:39.926 - 00:21:43.946, Speaker B: The second one is just like that's framework compliance approved.
00:21:44.058 - 00:21:45.678, Speaker C: Yeah. That's not true.
00:21:45.764 - 00:22:18.566, Speaker B: Don't. Not financial advice being sarcastic, but the fact that they used a centralized intermediary to put these additional things on their smart contract was eventually their undoing. And I don't think anybody ever made the promise of crypto not extending to centralized institutions. That's not the thing that we're going after here. And so I wasn't surprised. I do hear the pushback from everybody on crypto Twitter about how this was not a good thing generally, but what else were they supposed to do? Like, if your thing is not permissionless, there really isn't much you can do if a court orders you to do right?
00:22:18.668 - 00:23:17.270, Speaker C: And just to be clear, I think the hack wasn't I don't know if it was necessarily a hack. I think it was more of an open exploit that existed actually for a while, where there was the ability to upgrade the contracts and in the process of upgrading, you could change or retrieve assets with the admin key in particular. So you were basically putting your trust in Oasis, the centralized wrapper, on top of the maker protocol. And just to hammer this point home, there are a lot of instances where you've got centralized intermediaries that sit on top of decentralized protocols. And I frankly think that is the future of what DFI ultimately looks like. But don't think that just because you're using something that happens to look and feel like Web Three, it's completely decentralized to a point of not being upgradable, not being exploitable, not being redeemable, whatever it may be. And so I think this is a good lesson for all users of DeFi.
00:23:17.270 - 00:23:57.474, Speaker C: Obviously, the victory lapse of the people on Twitter that are claiming this is exactly why DeFi isn't DeFi whatever. But frankly, I think this is good because now we can actually have some retribution for a really large hack that happened. And I think we can close the loop on whether or not these Oasis contracts are upgradable or not. I think they cut that capability. So it's a one time situation for them and nothing really is that much different other than the person who stole a bunch of money, got the money stolen.
00:23:57.602 - 00:24:15.934, Speaker B: So people rooting for North Korea are just idiots, in my opinion. Like, oh, how could you? Like, DeFi is supposed to be uncensoral. It's like, yes, this was a one time exploit and we took money away from North Korea. I don't see it being bad necessarily. I don't know.
00:24:15.972 - 00:24:16.126, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:16.148 - 00:24:18.330, Speaker C: Was the wormhole hack officially Lazarus?
00:24:18.490 - 00:24:40.758, Speaker B: I'm just assuming anything over there's. So few people that are sophisticated enough to do like the thing that was funny was they started levering up. That's what they use the maker vault for. They started levering up and buying more ETH. At that point I was like, oh, maybe they're not so bad, but it's like, no, we can't let them do that. We should have some sort of checks and balances in the system, even if.
00:24:40.764 - 00:24:44.040, Speaker A: It has to go to a yeah, unless they bought like a ton of.
00:24:44.410 - 00:24:46.854, Speaker B: Be, then we would have something to talk about.
00:24:46.892 - 00:25:27.374, Speaker A: Of course, Supreme Leader, he doesn't have a butthole. I don't know what you're talking about. Adam's watching this like, oh God. Yeah, I'm kind of with you there has to think. I've heard Nick Carter say this and I kind of agree with it. We're in the span of time right now where all these systems are being battle tested and we're trying to get a sense of where does decentralization really need to be. I get that it's really good from an ideological standpoint for it to have all of it be completely uncensoral and unseasonable.
00:25:27.374 - 00:25:43.190, Speaker A: But I don't know, we live in a society so where's the pragmatic like, where does this really where do those lines really fall? So I think that's all going to get tested and we can opine on it, but probably the market and governments and society is just going to come to a consensus on what they find is an acceptable compromise.
00:25:43.350 - 00:26:13.122, Speaker C: I mean, think about how many implementations of ETH exist, how many client teams exist. Think about how many different apps are built on top of uniswap. Think about how many apps are built on top of maker or any of the DeFi protocols. This stuff is going to get figured out. I think this is just a great example of where points of decentralization maybe need to exist or maybe not. And maybe this is the right outcome because now we have the ability to say, okay, let's put levels of security around this. I don't know, I ultimately think this is a really good thing.
00:26:13.122 - 00:26:19.734, Speaker C: Small tangent, have you heard about some of these rules around renters rights in Is?
00:26:19.932 - 00:26:22.370, Speaker A: No, but I heard it's horrible in California.
00:26:22.530 - 00:26:37.370, Speaker C: Oh, it's pretty funny. Like literally a renter can take your apartment that you may own and you'renting out hostage if they've been there for a certain amount of time, refuse to pay rent and then declare that you need to pay them to leave and there's nothing that anybody can do.
00:26:37.440 - 00:26:42.570, Speaker B: San Francisco is built different, man. It's a whole other ballgame out here, actually.
00:26:42.720 - 00:26:51.870, Speaker C: This is an La story of a friend who has a house and it has two condos in it and literally one of them is being seized by the tenant.
00:26:52.210 - 00:26:58.766, Speaker A: What is the steelman case, though, for why it's a good idea that tenant law exists? I'm sure there's some kind of rationale why does that exist?
00:26:58.798 - 00:28:08.370, Speaker C: Like, I mean, it only got worse with COVID but there's all these owner move in and all of the safe Eviction rules that exist. I know in San Francisco. There's those and I think in most cities in California there's some derivation of that where if you are the owner of an apartment, you're only allowed to kick somebody out if you move in and stay there for five years. And if you are found out to not be living there for less than five years, the previous tenant can sue you there's just like all these it's supposed to protect people who have been there for a long time and they don't have any ability to move. And maybe the prices have gone up and they're locked into these rates because there's rent control on certain buildings. Ultimately for anybody who's taken a basic economics class, you realize that these are inefficiencies in the market and they ultimately have deteriorate effects on the entire housing market depending on which way they are built. So obviously not a fan.
00:28:08.370 - 00:28:18.870, Speaker C: I can maybe understand why someone put that in at one point for human protection and social value, but the free market is the free market and it says otherwise.
00:28:18.950 - 00:28:34.880, Speaker A: It's like these people don't believe in capitalism. What a shame. You know what? Honestly, I said this joke, but I think there is a growing portion of people out there, especially Gen Z, that straight up does not subscribe to capitalism. They're just like nope, opting out of.
00:28:35.970 - 00:28:41.218, Speaker C: The ones that have lived at home until they went to college and then just graduated those ones.
00:28:41.384 - 00:28:45.650, Speaker B: Cuba is really close. If you want to try the alternative, I can get you there fast.
00:28:45.720 - 00:29:12.858, Speaker A: I'm just saying scoreboard for capitalism looks pretty good compared to the alternatives is what I would float out there. But who knows? Let's just blame it on the that's that's much easier. At risk of going outside of the bounds of our podcast here, let's talk about Cosmos. They're ditching ICS. So basically this was reported a little while ago. So basically Cosmos needs a native stablecoin. They had one in the form of UST rip.
00:29:12.858 - 00:29:57.434, Speaker A: That is no longer the case. There are a couple other kind of alternatives that have been suggested but basically Circle announced in September of last year that USDC would launch Natively and then we got a little bit more detail that there was going to be a general asset issuance chain called Noble and that was going to be distributed through the Hub. So the Hub, frankly it has a little bit of an identity crisis but it does a couple of things. It's kind of like a router for messaging in between these protocols. But also with the advent of Atom 2.0 there's this sort of shared security model where the Hub can kind of rent out their validator set to commercial chains and that's what this was going to be. But now that is no longer the case.
00:29:57.434 - 00:30:06.800, Speaker A: They're going to launch as a standalone proof of authority chain instead of utilizing security from the Hub. So I'm curious what you guys think about this.
00:30:07.570 - 00:30:49.946, Speaker B: Just honestly feel like Cosmos has missed its window. ETH roll. Apps are scaling, they're getting user traction, they have stablecoins. The fact that this is launching as a POA chain, noble Is versus using ICS, like a huge hit to the value accrual of the chain itself. But I don't know, for me, at least, I don't know what Michael thinks. Cosmos oftentimes feels like the purest form of the PvP meme, where it's like instead of everyone having their own decks, now everyone has their own chain and there's like $5 of liquidity and it's like the same ten people passing like one dollars back and forth trying to make it into $2. It just doesn't feel like it has the activation energy required to really make it a thing.
00:30:49.946 - 00:31:13.154, Speaker B: And maybe that changes with dYdX, but I don't know. dYdX is even less of like, the whole dYdX value prop used to be. It's on starkware. It's super fast. It's the only place you can trade perps. And that was true just like the latency of the other chains was not low enough where you could have an Oracle updating to run a perps exchange on anywhere else. But now that isn't the case.
00:31:13.154 - 00:31:21.830, Speaker B: The L two S are fast enough, they're cheap enough, so I would be surprised if it had a resurgence. Frankly, I'm just not that big of a fan.
00:31:22.250 - 00:31:56.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I generally agree with all that. I don't know if they've missed their window or if they've just been hamstrung by terra blowing up. They had their stablecoin. But the thing that matters most for an ecosystem, especially when you're developing anything that's going to have financial primitives or DeFi or even like value transfer, you got to have a native stablecoin. And if you don't have that, there's really no form of application. I think that's super interesting. The second that you have to bridge, it's going to become too cumbersome for user adoption.
00:31:56.770 - 00:33:29.918, Speaker C: The second that you have to trust in another entity to be able to have something that you can really feel you can get access to. I mean, we're talking about the choke points of banks right now for USDC, and particularly USDC on know what happens if there's choke points that break on getting your stablecoins from one network to the other. So I think that there's just a lot of trust that you have to put in that, especially for something that doesn't have the Alindi effect as everything else has and has been building for the last couple of years. That being said, if Noble can develop a sustainable, I'm guessing that circle would just put USDC into Cosmos via Noble chain. If they can develop that trusted relationship, maybe that's a good opportunity for Noble and you can kind of speed run the opportunity knowing that you're going to have the exact same playbook as USDC on any other network. It will, I think, be interesting to say, okay, let's say dYdX is going to use this? Are they going to use it? Are they going to have to have a bunch of different others on there? Is it going to be another stablecoin wars playing out in real time, just in a new ecosystem? I feel like the more harm and the more competition you have going into the rollout of this new ecosystem, the noble ecosystem is that, frankly, you just have to have something win and win big quickly to catch up to everybody else.
00:33:30.084 - 00:34:33.570, Speaker A: I will take the other side of this a little bit because I like the people in Cosmos ecosystem, and I think they think about things in a fundamentally different way. So the way that I would distinguish kind of what's going on in Ethereum land and the challenges and problems that they're really interested in solving versus what's going on in Cosmos land is cosmos has, from day one been extremely honed in on kind of like the application, right? Like they solve a lot of problems from the perspective of kind of app developers, whereas Ethereum, I think, is very concerned with kind of the modular, kind of scaling infrastructure, like data availability, validity proofs, all that kind of stuff, right? And the ZK kind of came from Ethereum land. But I think they're just very focused on solving a different set of problems. I think if they could get you're right, the native stablecoin, the ability to take out leverage, there's a lot of really cool innovation going on over there. The hub just needs to figure out what they're doing. They lack the value accrual that's I think the challenge. I think it's something that can be overcome.
00:34:35.430 - 00:35:28.174, Speaker C: So the value accrual is a major component of it as well. But the thing that advance kind of mentioned this, but I'll say it again. The narrative of basically app chains that are built around IBC and the Cosmos ecosystem and the tech stack that is Cosmos are being sped run right now by supernets and subnets, where you've got the same level of scale, you have the same opportunity, you've got very business development, heavy ecosystems in polygon and avalanche. And they're trying to create EVM compatible ecosystems that also have the same scalability and native bridging that you would see if you were a Cosmos app chain. So there is sort of an area, there is an opening, and there's a window. I'm not saying it's closed. We definitely have investments in the Cosmos ecosystem.
00:35:28.174 - 00:35:35.030, Speaker C: Not saying that it's over by any way, shape, or form, but it is something where the competitors are catching up.
00:35:35.100 - 00:36:15.170, Speaker A: I think the last thing that I just want to get your kind of take on before we move here is just because there's kind of a central idea to the whole appchain thesis. Part of this season of bell curve is one I think, advantage that you have if your validator set understands the semantics of the application. And that, I think, is just a I'm not sure how you bridge that gap for something like Ethereum, where there's validators for generalized block space. And then even in this model, there'll be first it's a single sequencer, then it's a decentralized sequencer set, but it's not going to understand the semantics of the different applications that run on top of that. So it allows you a little bit more flexibility from a product standpoint or what do you think?
00:36:15.320 - 00:36:58.766, Speaker C: L three S. L Three S roll apps, whatever you want to call them. That's kind of what I mean when I say like supernets and Subnets. These are going to become application specific ecosystems or application specific networks. And I bet you see SMB game ecosystem, and that's just going to be like all the fast casual games with the same basic use cases and the same basic interactions with the L Two or the L One, whatever it may be. I'm guessing it's L Two that SuperNet, that Subnet will be specific for that ecosystem. You also may see like a single game that has its own Subnet or SuperNet.
00:36:58.766 - 00:37:08.198, Speaker C: I think you're going to see the Bifurcation there. But I think these Subnets and supernets, just like the Cosmos app chains, are going to be application or application ecosystem specific.
00:37:08.364 - 00:37:38.954, Speaker A: Well, I guess well, honestly, I'm a supporter of both. Both here. Rooting for everyone. I do think the Op stack one thing, I had a couple of conversations about Base in general because I want to get a sense of if developers are interested in that because it's kind of like there's a bunch of users that might use it, but it also could be like a corporate chain. Apparently the developers are super excited about it. They're like, yeah, there's 108,000,000 potential users and they're excited to build stuff on base. I think it was such a win for Coinbase.
00:37:38.954 - 00:37:43.458, Speaker A: I'm so happy for them. I think they nailed it. So I'm stoked for them.
00:37:43.544 - 00:37:46.290, Speaker B: Would you be as excited if they built a Cosmos chain?
00:37:47.190 - 00:38:03.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I would be. Yeah, I would be, dude. I would be. Don't. I think it would be very I'm sure they probably thought about that, and I actually think it's probably a relevant question to ask why they didn't.
00:38:07.530 - 00:38:39.266, Speaker C: It's a fair question. I think the other thing, just to tap into a little bit more of what you were saying, I think we're going to see a shift back to people realizing that they have to have sustainable businesses, so they're going to go where the users are. They're not going to have this, like, oh, the users are coming, the developers are coming. We're going to have this tool that serves five people. No, it's like we need something that serves an immediate population, an immediate market now. Otherwise we're not going to be around in a year or 18 months when we need to do our next fundraise. I think it's not really just like, oh, are people excited about it.
00:38:39.266 - 00:38:52.374, Speaker C: It's like, oh, this is maybe the only way that I can continue forward. And I think that's a narrative that we've been talking about kind of here or there over the last 6912 months, but it's definitely becoming more real now.
00:38:52.412 - 00:39:24.050, Speaker A: I think a lot of the investing arguments in crypto are supply based, which is probably comes from like the bitcoin 21 million hard cap narrative. But I think demand based arguments for investment are always a little bit more compelling, probably. Speaking of our friends over in Bitcoin land, what do you guys think about did you see Yuga labs announce something? They have their own native Bitcoin. NFTs there's also there's like signs of life from what do you guys think.
00:39:24.200 - 00:39:26.610, Speaker C: Waiting for you to bring up this general topic?
00:39:27.910 - 00:39:29.826, Speaker A: Do you guys have the spicy take?
00:39:30.008 - 00:40:17.998, Speaker B: No, I think ordinals are cool. I do too doing things other than just being like a culture of being against everything, being for something is cool. There's a difference between being able to kind of crudely transcribe something into a blockchain versus having the apps, the DFI, the user base, the culture of trading and making these things cultural. So I think that's the next step that it's going to be interesting to see them take. And it's cool to see Udi and Nick be reinvigorated with purpose versus kind of like just like, there's only going to be 21 million of these things. I don't know how much people care about the 21 million side of things anymore, honestly.
00:40:18.094 - 00:41:02.782, Speaker C: Listen, not to toot own horns once again, but I did predict that in 2023 we would start to have a discussion around what the future of Bitcoin looks like. And I think that this is in one form, a discussion because you're putting something out, you're forcing people to make decisions, you're forcing miners to make decisions, which is going to be the biggest component. And to Vance's point, there's nothing really that's changed fundamentally about Bitcoin. Yet you're sort of just using this in an end around way to prove that there's something that could happen. But I think it'll force conversations around. Maybe this is something that we should natively support. Like, could we natively support this? Should we natively support this? The fact that there's going to be conversation around this could make it something that's viable and real.
00:41:02.782 - 00:41:07.874, Speaker C: Right now, it's truly just a toy, but eventually it could be something real.
00:41:07.912 - 00:41:31.354, Speaker A: I think I have a very hard time understanding how decisions are made within Bitcoin. I don't understand what the governance structures look like, and I understand the stakeholders. I know who those are. I know there's the devs and the miners and the validators, but I don't really get how decisions really get pushed forward and who's kind of in control.
00:41:31.552 - 00:41:40.540, Speaker C: It's really obvious. Satoshi comes back every ten years and he writes all of his commandments down on Sanskrit and we deliver them to the code base.
00:41:44.290 - 00:42:14.598, Speaker B: Ethereum is the EIP process, which is like social consensus, which is like clients integrating it, which is obviously the developer community being behind it. But just to be transparent, there isn't really like an ABCDEFG process. You try to push it through all core devs calls, it usually fails. You have to try again. You have to rally people. There is no token governance of ethereum either. Bitcoin is more crude than that, but it's not entirely, entirely different just to.
00:42:14.604 - 00:42:54.274, Speaker A: Be used to when it comes to bitcoin, I used to really resist these comparisons to the Catholic Church and some new form of religion, but it really does fit that metaphor in a lot of ways, or that analogy in a lot of ways. I mean, there's like the commandments that you were just joking about, Michael. They hate the apostates, the people that turned. Just look at all the hate that Nick Carter gets on Twitter now, and they hate him more because he used to be one of them. And it is there's just this religious fervor and there are these people that are worshipped at the Mount. It's a little frustrating because I want to root for I mean, I'm more bullish on bitcoin than you guys. I want to root for it.
00:42:54.274 - 00:43:06.600, Speaker A: And the bullcase for bitcoin is like, would you short the Catholic Church? Look at what those guys did. They had an amazing run. Look at So. But I wish it was more than that, because I feel like it could be more than that.
00:43:07.690 - 00:43:23.046, Speaker C: Listen, you may be relatively more bullish on bitcoin than we are, but that doesn't mean that we're not bullish on bitcoin or that we don't think that there's future potential for it to really change and do something different. I'm just excited to see that there's at least an opening of the conversation.
00:43:23.158 - 00:43:45.002, Speaker A: All right, guys, I think the last thing that I kind of wanted to get your take on was this Immutable X Times Unity SDK announcement. So you spent a little bit of time talking about kind of like, what an app application SDK would look like, and I think that's still kind of being built. Can you guys just, again, just give a little bit of a refresher? Like, what is an SDK and what is this announcement? How is it significant?
00:43:45.086 - 00:44:31.426, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, an SDK is truly just a software development kit, so it can mean tons of different things. Usually when you're developing something that's consumer facing, or like a game, for instance, you're going to have a bunch of software and a bunch of libraries and a bunch of integrations into other tools or services or infrastructure. And an SDK is just like an interface to be able to do that. So if you need to interface with AWS, if you need to interface with Unity, they've got an SDK. There's just a common way of communicating, and that's what the SDK really represents. So what this in particular is is Immutable. And it's funny you put Immutable as the one that announced this.
00:44:31.426 - 00:45:18.098, Speaker C: There's actually like ten more that were a part of this announcement. Immutable flow salana avalanche. There were a ton of them. It's just that I think Immutable loves to ring the marketing bell more than most. And really what this means is they were put into what's called the Unity App Store. And so what it really means is anybody who wants to build on Immutable, you're sort of like a verified vendor within the Unity Store, which means that if you're a game that's building on Immutable, for instance, or Flow or any of these other chains, you now have a direct plugin that's like a verified developer with Unity. So I think it's a big move.
00:45:18.098 - 00:46:07.860, Speaker C: I think, frankly, the biggest component of this is just Unity's recognition that web three gaming is something that they want to have plugins for and feature in their App Store and Unity. And just as a backdrop here, unity is one of the two most dominant game engines. So all the rendering of the graphics, all of the physics, all of the motion, or all the different aspects of movement within games, all of that is usually controlled by a game engine. And Unity is one of the two most dominant DM engines that are underpinning all games, every single one. Or you can develop the drafts yourselves, but most DM developers just don't do that these days. So I think the big takeaway here isn't Immutable. I think Immutable is just louder than everybody else.
00:46:07.860 - 00:46:25.430, Speaker C: But what it is, is that Unity is recognizing that web three gaming is definitely something that they want to be a part of and they want to have interface into the developers directly. And so they're going where the developers are, which is all these different chains. So very interesting to see, but I'd say ultimately very positive.
00:46:26.330 - 00:46:53.002, Speaker A: I know we've talked about this before, but in terms of I know you guys see a whole bunch of different gaming projects. I don't know, when I think of the games that I love, it's kind of like the Halo Three was kind of like my game, or like the Call of Duties or stuff like that. That's not really what we're talking about here with crypto gaming. What are the models that kind of excite you guys? Or what are some of the stuff that's on kind of like the cutting edge of gaming in crypto? How do you think it looks different from traditional gaming?
00:46:53.066 - 00:47:29.466, Speaker B: The thesis is very simple. Once gamers realize that they can actually get something out of playing these games and spending massive amounts of money on them, they will never go back to the old model. And right now, we don't have a lot of proof points on our side. We have small scale examples of success, things like pixels, obviously, like axio. Infinity was not a good proof point that was just like the Euthanasia roller coaster for largely Southeast Asian people. It didn't work out that well. But there is something powerful with being able to play something, being able to have ownership of your game assets and being able to create value.
00:47:29.466 - 00:48:02.246, Speaker B: And at the end of the day, not just having the game extract value from you, but building something that has value on chain with the rest of the community and realizing some sort of collective success. And that's the thesis and it's taking longer than we would have thought. But by the second half of this year, I think we're going to see a few games starting to prove this model out. And we're not looking for 100 games to work. We're looking for one. It only takes one. And once you have that success case, everyone is going to copy paste iterate towards it.
00:48:02.246 - 00:48:16.122, Speaker B: And that's really kind of what grows the top of funnel of crypto. At the end of the day, it is the only consumer use case that has enough scale to put a billion people on chain. And it's the clearest it's the clearest thesis that we have for that to happen.
00:48:16.176 - 00:49:10.010, Speaker C: I would describe it as the bottom of the first inning where everybody has started to build these things. They've started to test them, they've started to iterate with them. Frankly, they have pretty wide distribution on the betas for these games. And what happens is you build a game, right, and you get the graphics right, you get the storyline right, you have this entire world that you've developed and then you put a bunch of people into the ecosystem and you're like, all right, now go run free and see what happens. And that's really when game development starts, because that's when you start to balance out the game. You start to figure out what the economy needs to look like. You start to figure out how many of these different attributes, resources, capabilities should I put into the game at the start? How should I be doing my Live Ops, which is essentially the re ups every week, every two weeks of how many of these things am I going to be distributing? I need to be constantly managing this economy.
00:49:10.010 - 00:49:47.480, Speaker C: Some of the most simple games are some of the most successful games just because they have the best Live Ops operations on the back end. And every two weeks there's new content and it just keeps people refreshed, it keeps people going. If you beat the game, people stop playing the game. And so you have to keep it refreshed. So we're in that rebalancing phase right now. So a lot of exciting data, like anecdotally we've invested in a number of former game executives, game developers in pre web three gaming. And some of the retention cohorts that they're seeing is like three, four, five times what they would expect to see.
00:49:47.480 - 00:50:23.694, Speaker C: Just because you have imbued value into something that people own and that fact alone. And if you can communicate that effectively to the gamers, they stick around because they own part of the game. And so I think that's like, step one, that's like Web 2.5 for gaming. What I think Web Three and this is a hypothesis at this point, what I think Web Three for gaming actually turns into is a lot more user generated content. And so it's not just like you get to own something, it's you get to create something in the game. And that just imbues further ownership, but it also imbues your own creativity.
00:50:23.694 - 00:50:54.878, Speaker C: You get to put your own swag into it. You get to do whatever you want within the confines of the game. And that's the real value of game. Vance and I built a game prior to Framework called Hash Lates, and that was an experiment in and of itself. But back then, in 2017, 2018, everyone's like, oh, Blockchain is going to enable games to be interoperable. And I remember getting a question when we were going through the process. They were like, well, what if you put a monster on top of Tom Brady's body and you run around and it's like, no, that would ruin the.
00:50:54.884 - 00:50:58.560, Speaker B: Game and you would lose your license. So like, that makes no sense.
00:50:59.010 - 00:51:24.790, Speaker C: But that's what people were talking about, this whole interop layer. And sure, maybe if you're a game publisher and you have three related games and the characters are all the same and you want to have interop between those specific games, totally, that makes total sense. But the value of Blockchain gaming isn't going to be anything that's interop. It's going to be ownership and creation. So I think that's kind of like thesis that we're refining our previous thesis into.
00:51:24.940 - 00:52:02.686, Speaker A: Yeah, there was a guy who his name is Josh Rosenthal and he sort of gives this talk about this he spoke at permissionless, but he's also been on Bankless a number of times and he kind of has this analogy of like, imagine you are living in the Dark Ages. You're a peasant in kind of medieval times. Imagine just trying to explain to that person how little ownership and how little freedom they have. They'd be like, what do you mean? I wake up, I go and I get my hay and I get my food or whatever. But there'd be no way of saying like, dude, you don't own any of that land. You can't hire people. It's just very difficult to reframe that reference.
00:52:02.686 - 00:52:20.514, Speaker A: And I think that's what I kind of see that in the gaming side of things as well. It's like, hey, we're trying to actually give you stuff here. We're trying to give you back some of this value that has traditionally just accrued to game makers or social media in general. But I think it's a compelling thesis, but I can see how it takes a little while to get there mentally.
00:52:20.562 - 00:52:52.738, Speaker B: The thesis that we've had that have worked have always been very simple. We're going to allow you to own a part of the game. We are going to build financial services on chain, like the stuff that's further afield, where it's like, we're going to do a social network and you're going to own your own post. Maybe you can sell it to somebody else. It's like those things have generally never worked. It's going to take longer. But I don't know, it feels like it's starting to work at a very small scale and it gives us hope that this is going to really whipsaw in the right direction when it really works well.
00:52:52.824 - 00:53:27.642, Speaker C: And just another analogy, think about how much value there is in physical real estate, obviously, and the different slices of ownership, the different ways that you can manage it, the different things that you can build on top of it or do with it. But think about how increasingly each successive generation is living their lives in a digital realm. And this may be I mean, it may be social media, but it may be in these game ecosystems. It may be in game ecosystems could be like three dimensional. It could be two dimensional and pixelated. It doesn't really matter. But you're still spending hours of your life in that ecosystem.
00:53:27.642 - 00:53:43.620, Speaker C: And instead of you being the peasant that's sitting outside the gates owning your own hay, you actually now get to be an owner in that instance of that game, in that digital realm. And there's value in that for younger generations. That's the only value that they know.
00:53:43.990 - 00:54:34.322, Speaker A: The simplicity point kind of resonates, honestly. Van sometimes if you listen to business podcasts, you would think the way that things happen is you're sitting in a room and you come up with some brilliant strategy and you just do it. It is just so not how it happens in practice. Usually if there is something cool that you do, it's the result of someone told us this. They were like, hey, it's really cool how you guys built a media company backwards, because you started with the thing that makes money, and then you reverse engineered the media. And it was like, yeah, we totally thought of that when really, it took us three years to realize that what we were building was a media company and we were just trying to make it work. And it sounds all cool to talk on Pod, but I generally think most strategy actually comes from just executing and tactics and needing to do something.
00:54:34.322 - 00:54:38.550, Speaker A: Necessity is the mother of invention, but totally backwards from how I thought it was going to work.
00:54:38.620 - 00:54:55.900, Speaker B: Same thing with pitches, too. If you hear a good pitch, you leave the call and you're like, all right, let's invest. If you need to do diligence, if you need to do research and studying trends, and what's the growth rate of this country? What's the size of that market?
00:54:57.470 - 00:54:57.834, Speaker C: It.
00:54:57.872 - 00:55:02.480, Speaker B: Usually is not a good investment. The best things are usually very simple.
00:55:03.010 - 00:55:06.910, Speaker C: What's the phrase? It's 10% strategy, 100% execution.
00:55:08.370 - 00:55:10.446, Speaker A: Yeah, right, I'm with you on that.
00:55:10.468 - 00:55:12.720, Speaker B: I assure you it wasn't brains that got me here.
00:55:14.450 - 00:55:16.400, Speaker C: Somebody just lost margin call.
00:55:20.610 - 00:55:22.320, Speaker B: Hiring is kind of the same.
00:55:22.690 - 00:55:42.700, Speaker A: It's totally to usually on a hiring call in like a last stage or something. Like Jason and I kind of get looped in at the end and we'll be on and after like two minutes I have to stop myself from being like, this is a yes for me or this is a no for like you just get that very quickly.
00:55:43.390 - 00:55:53.680, Speaker C: I think what we're all kind of saying is it comes down to clarity and can you communicate clarity efficiently? And if it's very clear, it's very simple, it's very obvious.
00:55:54.930 - 00:56:10.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's bring it back to gaming. Biggest market by far. People who look and feel like crypto natives check games that are coming to market in the second half of the year and people are already fading. Blockchain games with no blockchain games out there.
00:56:11.510 - 00:56:15.410, Speaker C: Well, there's one, it's called Axie and it's still kicking.
00:56:16.570 - 00:56:20.280, Speaker B: Here's a contrarian prediction. I think Axie comes back.
00:56:22.170 - 00:56:23.800, Speaker A: You think Axie comes.
00:56:28.010 - 00:56:37.610, Speaker B: Not to their old way of doing things, but let me break it down for you. Very simple. They have a large studio, they have a lot of money, they've experienced building games.
00:56:43.730 - 00:56:45.802, Speaker C: A rebrand might be necessary.
00:56:45.946 - 00:56:58.420, Speaker B: Yeah, new coat of paint, whatever you want to call it. Different name, but it's pretty simple in my mind. We don't have any axe, we don't have any exposure, but best things are very simple.
00:56:59.510 - 00:57:43.182, Speaker A: I've got a way dumber, just stupid pattern matching observation that kind of aligns with that is I feel like in crypto there's this history of something makes a big splash, like way earlier than it should in a cycle and then it comes back like full force next cycle. Like I'll give you an example. CryptoKitties was like an NFT project that caused a ton of hype and then there was nothing after that. And everyone was like, oh yeah, NFTs are kind of a thing, but look at CryptoKitties and now look at NFTs. Even with the dao, right there was like the dao and it worked and it was like a phenomenal failure and then it just kind of laid there dormant and axe has the potential to that just feels like that to me. Obviously there was something there and now there's not much.
00:57:43.236 - 00:58:21.742, Speaker C: But using that same analogy, if Axie is crypto titties, I'm not saying that CryptoKitties is back in any way, but maybe web three gaming will come back because it's NFTs that's back now. I mean, you can think of the analogy in similar ways. I guess you could also say CryptoKitties is dapper. Dapper has a lot of other things that they've built, but I actually think the biggest thing is anything in crypto that hasn't truly died. Like, truly died. As long as you're alive and you can make it across market cycles, there is a chance that you come back bigger and larger than you were before.
00:58:21.876 - 00:58:35.554, Speaker A: I agree with that. I think dYdX actually did that pretty well. They initially launched. There was a long period where I kind of knew what they were, and then suddenly they were back one day. I agree with that.
00:58:35.672 - 00:58:44.190, Speaker C: All the original primitives of DFI summertime, all of those are still the top DFI protocols.
00:58:44.270 - 00:59:12.878, Speaker A: Oh, by the way, I do want to give a shout out to we use their phrase at the top of this episode, but Bankless just got reported that they're raising a $35 million VC fund. Love those guys. Ryan and David are we have a kind of an informal no partnerships policy at blockworks we've just over the years, but they're the one partnership where they really do what they say they're going to do. They're phenomenal to work with, and I think the world of so I hope it works out for them. That's great.
00:59:12.964 - 00:59:14.510, Speaker C: Hats off to them. They're the best.
00:59:14.580 - 00:59:23.530, Speaker A: All right, fellas, I think that's all time we have, but this was a fun one. Jason, I miss you, budy. I feel bad about that joke. Miss you, dude. Hope you're doing well. Denver peace.
