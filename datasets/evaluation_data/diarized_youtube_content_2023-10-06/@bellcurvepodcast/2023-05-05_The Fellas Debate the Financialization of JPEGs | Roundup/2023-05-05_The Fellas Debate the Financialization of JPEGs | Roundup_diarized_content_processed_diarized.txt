00:00:26.810 - 00:00:39.420, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got I'm still thinking about when you told me about my podcast voice. Michael's, one and two advance. Welcome to show.
00:00:40.350 - 00:00:47.930, Speaker A: Thanks for having to be here, Mike. Good to be here. Midsummer Mike over here with your Florida shirt ready to I'm in Florida.
00:00:48.430 - 00:00:49.766, Speaker C: You're in Florida?
00:00:49.958 - 00:01:04.110, Speaker B: Yeah, actually he's been on the show. It's Miles. It's miles 30th. So I am down here. This is like the year of all. My entire friend group is turning 30, so they're like five 30th birthdays in various places.
00:01:07.730 - 00:01:13.540, Speaker D: Vance and I were at a wedding this weekend. I've yet another one this upcoming weekend and one the weekend after.
00:01:14.310 - 00:01:15.294, Speaker B: It's wedding season.
00:01:15.342 - 00:01:18.934, Speaker C: Michael did what was it? 13 wedings. 14 wedings last year.
00:01:19.052 - 00:01:20.726, Speaker D: Eleven weddings last year.
00:01:20.828 - 00:01:21.570, Speaker A: Damn.
00:01:21.730 - 00:01:30.760, Speaker C: Sounds like the beginning that he's invited to. I've told all of my friends that I am only showing up to one of their weddings, so you better make it count.
00:01:31.790 - 00:01:35.702, Speaker A: Have you really thought one of your friends was like, didn't invite you to the first wedding?
00:01:35.766 - 00:01:37.418, Speaker B: Expecting the second, not coming to the.
00:01:37.424 - 00:01:39.834, Speaker C: Second, then one and done.
00:01:40.032 - 00:01:41.978, Speaker B: Get one. You better be really sure.
00:01:42.144 - 00:01:46.400, Speaker C: Seriously. I don't have that many weekends in a year.
00:01:47.650 - 00:02:02.238, Speaker B: I feel you. I was just talking to this about like I was just talking to this guy and he's like, oh, is it going to be a crazy weekend? I was like, yeah, we're not going super wild. He's like, after 30, it's not called going wild, it's called going mild. So that's what we're doing this weekend. Go mild.
00:02:02.414 - 00:02:03.950, Speaker C: Yeah. Boys in the hot tub.
00:02:04.030 - 00:02:08.466, Speaker B: Classic. Boys in the hot. No girls allowed, baby. No girls allowed. Chicks.
00:02:08.498 - 00:02:09.586, Speaker A: Olives got to bring chicks.
00:02:09.618 - 00:02:10.614, Speaker D: That's too nice.
00:02:10.732 - 00:02:11.574, Speaker A: Soak nice.
00:02:11.612 - 00:02:12.600, Speaker B: Soak yourself.
00:02:15.610 - 00:02:21.942, Speaker C: I'm enjoying my thirty s more than my 20s. Just to put it out there. It's a chill about it.
00:02:22.076 - 00:02:26.810, Speaker B: That was my suspicion too. Seems like 30s. That's a good age to be 30s hype early.
00:02:26.880 - 00:02:28.150, Speaker A: Thirty s real hype.
00:02:28.230 - 00:02:30.246, Speaker C: Are you two sub 30 or over 30?
00:02:30.368 - 00:02:31.310, Speaker A: Sub 30.
00:02:31.460 - 00:02:33.550, Speaker B: Sub 30. Wow.
00:02:33.620 - 00:02:34.110, Speaker C: Get ready.
00:02:34.180 - 00:02:36.240, Speaker B: We're right there though. I'm 29.
00:02:36.770 - 00:02:38.640, Speaker A: We're pushing up against it.
00:02:39.330 - 00:02:40.714, Speaker C: We talk some crypto.
00:02:40.842 - 00:03:29.038, Speaker B: Yeah. Before we paint a too vivid of a picture with the hot tub here, let's get into crypto a little bit. Yeah, let's do some predictions because I think coinbase earnings are actually going to come out during this recording. So just to refresh people a little bit, maybe I'll actually share my screen. One SEC just so we can recap how Coinbase did over the course of last year. So they break out basically they've got two buckets with different subgroups underneath, but they've got transaction revenue and they've got subscription and services revenue. Obviously transaction revenue is the bulk of their business, but Wall Street cares a lot about subscription and services because the general perception is transaction revenue is going to trend down towards zero over time.
00:03:29.038 - 00:04:18.922, Speaker B: So they really want to grow that subscription services part of their revenue. Within transaction revenue, they break it out in between consumer and institutional. The consumer bucket is much larger just because of the amount of fees. It's kind of an unspoken thing, I guess it's spoken. But the fees that consumers get charged are much, much higher. Retail gets charged much higher fees on Coinbase than the institutional part of their client base. And then for subscription and services, they break it out between blockchain rewards, which is staking, basically custodial fee revenue, interest income which is generated largely based on their partnership with Circle, the center consortium, and then other subscription and services, which is kind of just a hodgepodge of different bets, kind of like coinbase one, things like then I guess this is if you look at it in terms of their profitability.
00:04:18.922 - 00:05:07.278, Speaker B: So there's net revenue income and adjusted EBITDA. And I was going back and Brian guided towards there's a change in philosophy at Coinbase which is they basically had a goal to make all their money during bull markets and they were going to break even during these sorts of bear periods. That has changed now and they have since guided that they want to be profitable in all market conditions. Although the CFO did walk it back a little and say well, we're not committing to that in 2023, we want to see absolute growth in EBITDA. So classic the CFO kind of walking it back a little. I'd be curious, I have some specific thoughts, but I would love to get your guys thoughts on. What are you thinking about for Q One? How do you think it's going to look?
00:05:07.364 - 00:05:48.554, Speaker A: I think there are a couple of things that I'm looking at. Maybe we can break it down. So on the revenue side of things, I would assume that Q One revenue will look pretty similar to Q Four, but potentially higher. And if you look at like I bet the user base has actually shrunk a little bit and I bet you'll see like downloads of the app for example, are down, but you have higher ETH prices, higher crypto prices across the board with higher interest rates, which I think will drive higher revenue. So like, first prediction I would have is higher revenue. Second prediction I would have is on the earnings side, those are always a little tougher to predict, but I think it'll look pretty good actually because they.
00:05:48.592 - 00:05:52.342, Speaker B: Cut a ton of people huge layoffs, huge layoffs.
00:05:52.406 - 00:06:42.762, Speaker A: And I don't know what percentage of their expenses come from personnel, but you got to assume it's pretty high with like several thousand people and they had huge layoffs. So I bet their earnings will also look pretty good. Would have to assume that they do a lot of talk about regulatory pressure both on the staking products side of things and then their wells notice. And I bet that'll be like the main focus of this. And then one interesting thing that I bet Main Street or Wall Street won't really talk about is the new sources of revenue. But I'd be curious to see how they start talking about their international futures markets, how they start providing guidance around the L Two, around base. That's what I think will actually be the most interesting aspect of this that probably Wall Street will skip over.
00:06:42.762 - 00:06:44.830, Speaker A: So those are my high level predictions.
00:06:45.250 - 00:07:25.098, Speaker D: Totally agree with all those, I would say. In addition, just like breaking down this chart right here, consumer I would say, is probably going to be pretty similar, if not a bit higher in terms of net revenue from transaction revenue. Institutional I would imagine is actually going to be pretty far down. Post FTX, I would imagine that a lot of institutions just frankly stopped trading. And I think in Q Four you had a lot of rebalancing and tax loss harvesting. That attributed to the 13 million that you see in that column. The one that I think is going to be most interesting, which won't show up in Q One, but I think will absolutely be present in Q Two and they'll probably talk about it or guide towards it.
00:07:25.098 - 00:08:02.360, Speaker D: In the call is the actual blockchain rewards subscriptions and services revenue. I think post Shanghai, a number of institutional partners put ETH into the staking program that they had and a lot of that, I'd say all of that is probably ETH staking. I'm sure there's some other staking opportunities that exist or persist, but I would imagine that in Q Two that's going to jump the most. So whether or not they talk about it, I don't know and it's not going to show up in Q One earnings. But blockchain rewards is the one that I'm tracking the most.
00:08:03.610 - 00:08:31.630, Speaker B: Michael, real quick, I completely agree with you on the blockchain rewards and those are denominated. Those staking revenues are denominated in ETH. So even if they basically stay constant, the price appreciation is going to do very well for that particular line item. I would push back maybe a little bit on the institutional part of your observation because maybe just a question to you. Obviously crypto has done super well year to date. Who do you think has been buying? Do you think that's been institutional driven or retail driven?
00:08:34.550 - 00:09:10.380, Speaker D: I would say it's probably more retail than institutional. But I guess the comparison that I have well, the comparison that I have is from Q Four to Q One. And I think a lot of the institutions were tax lost harvesting at the end of last year. And so that's where a lot of that activity was driven from. There has been price appreciation in January and that was probably a lot of institutions rebuying. So maybe this is flat, maybe it's even up, I don't know. But I do think that institutional relative to consumer isn't going to grow as much.
00:09:11.890 - 00:09:46.200, Speaker B: Yeah, you might be right. I went back and sort of skimmed the analyst notes from Q Four and there actually was a disclosure there that there was an inbound in interest on the institutional side for prime. So they were onboarding a whole bunch of customers in Q Four. They did kind of walk that back though and say typically this sort of relative balance between the retail and institutional part of their business doesn't change all that much. But I don't know. I'm not really sure. I don't really think retail is back in this market yet.
00:09:46.650 - 00:09:48.040, Speaker C: I feel like you're not.
00:09:48.490 - 00:10:24.478, Speaker D: I completely agree with that. The one thing that I will say is that in Q Four, late Q Four, or maybe it was Q One, they did switch everybody over from Pro, who was a consumer, from Pro to advanced trading. And so there have been some product updates that I personally have found to be on the consumer side to be really beneficial. That's kind of what I'm basing in terms of where this activity is coming from relative to the institutional side. Anecdotally also, just like institutions were not very active in Q One because they were trying to pick up the pieces of what happened after FDX.
00:10:24.654 - 00:11:13.486, Speaker B: Yeah, Coinbase has this jason, just in response to your question about base, coinbase has this framework that they used to talk to their analysts into Wall Street. They call it their 70 2010 framework. And they say about 70% of our resources and focus is dedicated to our core business. So basically everything that we're talking about, 20% is allocated towards more strategic long term pursuits. And then 10% is kind of their risk taking, venture type investments within their product portfolio, which I actually think is easy to understand and probably a pretty decent framework for running a business. I think base is the wild card, but that would be firmly in the 10% bucket, so I doubt it gets much airtime.
00:11:13.678 - 00:11:19.606, Speaker D: That framework was started by Google in the early two thousand s and it.
00:11:19.628 - 00:11:24.438, Speaker A: Was all about 20% of time or something goes to the and they also work on anything.
00:11:24.604 - 00:11:38.940, Speaker D: They also did the 20% time for the engineers. And 70% is how we're going to make money in the next three years. 20% is how we're going to make money in three to five years, and 10% is how we're going to make money after the next five years.
00:11:40.350 - 00:11:41.610, Speaker B: I like that frame.
00:11:43.070 - 00:12:09.382, Speaker C: I haven't looked too much into Coinbase's financials, but what this tells me is that A, they're not leaving the like, all of this is basically US revenue or US centric, especially on the retail two. You know, like the staking arguments, I guess the Wells notice hasn't formally turned into a suit yet, but they're going to fight that tooth and nail. That's one of their only at least steady revenue segments that has a chance to five or ten X.
00:12:09.516 - 00:12:11.640, Speaker D: So I don't know.
00:12:12.170 - 00:12:28.138, Speaker C: It seems like Brian is trying to set up a straw man for like, we're really going to leave if forced to, but at the same time, the math wouldn't bear that out at all if Coinbase left the US. If Coinbase gave up on Staking, I don't know how much of Coinbase would really be just just to reiterate, I.
00:12:28.144 - 00:12:41.326, Speaker D: Think I said this a couple of weeks ago, but leaving the US. Doesn't mean they're leaving. They're still going to have offices in the US. It means the technical headquarters is going to be based somewhere else. But nothing changes. The product is still served to US. Customers.
00:12:41.326 - 00:12:51.460, Speaker D: They still make us money and pay taxes for those US revenues. But it's just that the technical headquarters would be in London or yeah.
00:12:52.230 - 00:13:34.654, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess we'll see. I guess just the last thing is that interest expense that's really been carrying their whole services and subscription bucket of revenue, I think it's probably too late that USDC DPEG. I think that happened in March and then there's been a draining of right. There's been some seven or $8 billion worth of market cap that's migrated out of USDC and into Tether. I frankly don't know how to forecast that because that market cap moving to Tether doesn't even necessarily mean that the portion that they generate their interest on is like they generate interest on USDC. That's custody at Coinbase.
00:13:34.654 - 00:13:56.470, Speaker B: So I don't even know if that blip ultimately ends up impacting that. But it is worth calling it out because that's the part of the services and subscription. Everybody that's basically been carrying that whole number and to be fair to Wall Street, they've questioned that. I'm not really sure it deserves to be in there. Frankly. I don't know if interest, expenses, subscription.
00:13:57.290 - 00:14:19.760, Speaker C: They'Re not likely to get more people to put A, more principal into it at the size that they've been able to historically or B, take advantage of the same level of interest rates. Just doesn't feel like that's in the card. It's giving everything that's going on with the regional bank. I guess it's not even a crisis or what's the name of.
00:14:22.610 - 00:14:24.206, Speaker B: Like, I.
00:14:24.228 - 00:14:51.858, Speaker C: Feel like that's one of the things totally unrelated, but I feel like there's this intentional and Michael and I have talked about this before. There's this intentional memory holing or trying to keep these headlines out of Bloomberg or New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. It's like how many banks have blown up at this point? And we're still not allowed to call it a crisis. Just completely crazy to me. It feels like there's some serious just like, sheeple herding going on, at least for the mainstream media outlets.
00:14:51.954 - 00:15:08.318, Speaker A: It does feel interesting. Like when in 2008, everyone in the world knew that these banks were blowing up and everything was collapsing. And today you have like the size of the banks blowing up is actually much larger. And I feel like nobody's really talking about it outside of FinTwit land.
00:15:08.484 - 00:15:15.140, Speaker C: Lesson there, there's a lesson there. I mean, the lesson there is that it's much worse than anybody is actually telling people.
00:15:15.510 - 00:15:33.666, Speaker D: Well, I will say totally agree with all of that. So far, throughout all of this process, there's been exactly $0 lost for depositors. There is an element of like, okay, sure, shareholders are done, bondholders are done, the companies themselves are going through massive.
00:15:33.698 - 00:15:37.960, Speaker C: Layoffs, but our consumers, nothing to see here.
00:15:40.330 - 00:15:42.322, Speaker B: It's a liquidity problem, it's not a solution.
00:15:42.386 - 00:15:43.740, Speaker C: Don't believe that at all.
00:15:47.150 - 00:15:53.420, Speaker A: Michael, in 2008, it was the same thing. I mean, the bank accounts were backed by FDIC in 2008 as well.
00:15:54.190 - 00:16:02.538, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a little bit different because those were investment banks and like, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, there were a lot of clients who lost a lot of money. But I do think that there's an.
00:16:02.564 - 00:16:12.354, Speaker A: Element I'm just saying, your argument that you're arguing that because depositors didn't get hurt, then it's not like a big mainstream thing.
00:16:12.472 - 00:16:37.850, Speaker D: No, it is. I'm saying I agree. I would say that being said, so far, nobody has lost money. Also, right now, I don't know. I saw the list yesterday of the after hours trading of ten different regional banks, and Pac West was at the top of the list and they were down like, 60% after hours. So this isn't stopping yet. But how far can the FDIC go.
00:16:37.920 - 00:16:39.420, Speaker B: In Vac stopping these?
00:16:40.750 - 00:16:43.210, Speaker D: How deep are the pockets, right?
00:16:43.360 - 00:16:55.280, Speaker B: And is everybody how deep? We're going to find out the FDIC insurance fund was before all this. It's not infinite. It's like $125,000,000,000 or something.
00:16:56.150 - 00:17:14.582, Speaker D: I guess what I'm saying is we have staved off depositors, losing money so far. I don't think you can go forever. It doesn't look like this is stopping. Something is going to have to give at some point. And the second that depositors start losing money, this is going to be like the biggest news story I think people are going to be talking about.
00:17:14.716 - 00:17:16.118, Speaker B: I don't think any depositor is going.
00:17:16.124 - 00:17:31.054, Speaker C: To lose any money. I think we're just going to print infinite money and just like, I agree, shove it under the rug. That's why we're not allowed to talk about it on the Internet or mainstream news. Just like, need to go to the real sources to get that information. You know what I'm talking about?
00:17:31.092 - 00:17:33.790, Speaker B: Michael Vance. Where's your tinfoil?
00:17:36.610 - 00:17:40.618, Speaker C: There's some corners of the Internet where the real news is being reported.
00:17:40.794 - 00:17:42.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Where are you spend time these days, man?
00:17:43.430 - 00:17:46.638, Speaker C: Oh, bro. You don't even want to know what's.
00:17:46.654 - 00:17:47.940, Speaker A: On your BOOKMARKS list.
00:17:50.070 - 00:17:52.180, Speaker D: Let's see your open tabs right now.
00:17:55.690 - 00:17:57.526, Speaker C: There's some pretty funny open tabs right now.
00:17:57.548 - 00:17:58.550, Speaker B: I'm not going to lie.
00:18:00.650 - 00:18:01.960, Speaker C: Let's move on.
00:18:03.530 - 00:18:08.562, Speaker A: Let's talk about Blur. Blend, yeah, blending. Blur.
00:18:08.706 - 00:18:45.926, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about Blend. So blur, obviously, is the NFT marketplace that launched earlier this year. They just announced something called Blend, which is sort of the next evolution of NFT Phi. It's a peer to peer NFT marketplace where there's a bunch of I'll just give you my I mean, there are a bunch of features on it. I think there's something that's very hard to digest about it, because one of the things that it allows you to do is do buy now, pay later for NFTs. And a lot of people have had a very negative reaction to that, myself included. But I think if you look at the design of this marketplace, there are actually some things that are pretty cool about it.
00:18:45.926 - 00:19:43.846, Speaker B: So basically it's just a marketplace similar sort of to something like Ave where you can deposit where lenders can lend to people who want to buy NFTs and only put down a small amount of collateral. And there's some kind of cool mechanism design about how that actually works. Notably, they don't rely on oracles for price feeds. So because these are individualized loans and it's not peer to pool or something like that, individual lenders can set basically the interest rate that they're comfortable lending at. And the way they get around relying on an oracle is at any given time, the lender can essentially trigger a Dutch auction. And wherein another lender can either scoop up the NFT at a higher interest rate or in the case that no lenders want to step in, they actually take possession of the collateral. We can dig into that.
00:19:43.846 - 00:20:22.510, Speaker B: I think a lot of people have a lot of problems with that. And see Gamification there. But the other thing that I thought was kind of cool about this construction is they assume I kind of see this in an evolution in crypto market structure where if you have these sort of two sided marketplaces where you're relying on liquidity. In the very beginnings of, like, uniswap, you relied on retail liquidity for AMMS and then with univ, three, kind of like well, in order to create a better borrower experience. Right. Kind of the demand side of the equation, really. There's more complexity that's needed to provide liquidity.
00:20:22.510 - 00:20:52.480, Speaker B: And they were totally okay making that bet. And Blen basically came out and said we are actually basing this one of the assumptions in this marketplace working is the existence of more sophisticated lenders who can and honestly, just hearing them say that, I was like, that's probably the right assumption. I'm actually not sure that it makes sense for retail writ large to just be market makers can contribute passive liquidity. It's hard to be a market maker. So this is just kind of me rambling about this protocol, but what's your guys take on this?
00:20:53.250 - 00:21:08.850, Speaker A: I love that Blur is out here just launching a buy now, pay later thing for NFTs in this market, like this market of all time for crypto, they're out here just being like, oh, yeah, buy now, pay meanwhile, buy now, pay later is, like, collapsing in the fintech world.
00:21:08.920 - 00:21:09.540, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:09.910 - 00:21:11.746, Speaker D: My first reaction was you guys should.
00:21:11.768 - 00:21:17.720, Speaker C: Have read the room. Aren't they, like, doing a bunch of volume right now, though?
00:21:19.050 - 00:21:23.218, Speaker D: Like, they have trading volume or lending volume?
00:21:23.394 - 00:21:24.440, Speaker C: Let's see.
00:21:24.890 - 00:21:26.706, Speaker D: I think one is the pump.
00:21:26.738 - 00:21:27.874, Speaker A: Some NFTs like a zoo.
00:21:27.922 - 00:21:29.478, Speaker C: 17,000 ETH lended.
00:21:29.574 - 00:21:52.960, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, it's done well. The volumes were I would call it a successful launch. Also, since the launch, the floors of a couple of NFTs that are featured on Blend really popped. Like Azukis ran up from 14 or 15 to 18. And if you dig into the data, there's a lot of users buying Azukis with the buy now, pay later.
00:21:55.830 - 00:22:30.362, Speaker D: I agree with all that. I think the biggest thing in my mind is kind of the only thing that's left in DeFi right now is retail. And there aren't any institutions that are stepping in and market making things. There aren't any institutions that are going to be the initial backs off of liquidity for this ecosystem yet. Maybe it comes back eventually and it could be designed for that eventually. But I do think that we're kind of in this place of it's really only crypto whales and retail players that are in this ecosystem. So building that base of liquidity is going to be hard.
00:22:30.362 - 00:22:47.518, Speaker D: If they can do it, that's going to be great. But yeah, I think the 30 hours Dutch auction is tough because what that frankly means is you got to be, like, paying attention. If that goes off the hours, you're not that long.
00:22:47.684 - 00:22:48.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:49.350 - 00:23:21.394, Speaker A: Can I tell you why, Mike? You've spent a lot more time digging into this than I have. But the reason I didn't like it was actually around their messaging. I think Blur is really smart and Pac Man smart and stuff, and they've clearly advanced the institutional NFT world in a good way and push competitors in the right direction. But their Tweet thread announcement there was like one of the Tweets is like every I'm just going to read it. Every trillion dollar market relies on financialization to scale. NFTs are no different. Instead of paying a million dollars for a house, buyers put $100,000 down and pay the rest through their mortgage.
00:23:21.394 - 00:23:45.714, Speaker A: Without this mechanism, almost no one would be able to afford homes. So he's explaining the mortgage market, but I think that's a pretty dangerous thing to do to compare massive leverage and debt positions on these extremely volatile JPEGs with the purchase of a home. And I think it sets this dangerous mentality. I think people are going to get wrecked on this.
00:23:45.912 - 00:24:02.198, Speaker C: I do agree with that, though. It's just like a matter of whether it makes sense or is sustainable to lever up any asset in an attempt to buy it. So, like, buying a house, it sounds very sweet. You have a family, you go buy a house. American dream. Whatever. You do that with commercial real estate.
00:24:02.198 - 00:24:31.518, Speaker C: 90% loan to value. Everyone stops coming to the office, all of a sudden the portfolio is zero. So is an NFT more like a house or is it more like commercial real estate? It's probably not similar to either. It's probably just like internet money with a picture on think, you know, do these things have any fundamental value? That's kind of what the entire assumption of levering it up is based on. Or maybe it doesn't. And maybe it's all just meme value and it'll come back and it's a good way to speculate, but it reminded.
00:24:31.534 - 00:25:02.230, Speaker A: Me a little too much of like so Affirm and Afterpay and Klarna are like the main buy now, pay later platforms, and they absolutely ripped from like 2019 to 2021. I think there was like 2018 or 2019. There was like 2 billion in buy now, pay later debt. Two years later it increased ten X to like 25 billion. And if you look at the marketing of a lot of these buy now, pay later programs, they were like, this is really good for gig workers. This is great for young people with poor credit histories. This is great for the unbanked.
00:25:02.230 - 00:25:12.250, Speaker A: And it was like a similar kind of like I didn't like that messaging because you're kind of like, preying on those folks and it ended up completely backfiring for those people.
00:25:12.420 - 00:25:59.150, Speaker D: In reality, it was great because of Zerp, you can get a zero interest loan on a mattress or I i do find it interesting that financialization of PFP NFTs, particularly right now, is what they're going after. And to Vance's point, there is no fundamental utility, there is no fundamental value. We created these things so far, and they have value in a secondary marketplace, but it will lead to some people overextending and getting burned. And that, frankly, I think is probably not worth going super headfirst into this ecosystem right now. But maybe there's enough liquidity, maybe there's enough liquidity on the lending side to actually make this work.
00:25:59.300 - 00:26:29.142, Speaker B: That's kind of the thing that I keep going back to. Let me just set up the overall this is kind of a philosophical discussion. Like, how much financialization is enough? Like some amount of financialization is okay and good, right? Like, to use your example, Jason, of the like, America had a social contract where they made a decision where honing a house is a good thing. That's not the case. Like, there are other countries where everyone just rents. We were like, we think it's a good thing to own your home. And basically everyone should lever up and buy their home and that'll be okay.
00:26:29.142 - 00:26:59.714, Speaker B: So we all kind of thought that was good, but then where's the line? Because now it's not small community banks that are lending to people in their community. This way there's going to be none of them left. But really what happens is those are more like small distribution centers where these mortgages are originated. They're packaged up and then they're sold to people in Japan. And it's like, well, maybe that because you have a larger base of people that are willing to buy those mortgages, you get a better price. But is that really a better system? It's a philosophical question at a certain point.
00:26:59.832 - 00:27:47.458, Speaker D: So the two points coming out of that are number one, a house is a fundamentally useful asset whether or not you live in it or somebody else does. Someone's going to be living in it, most likely. And number two, the other reason why homeownership became such an American mainstay is because overall the residential housing market has gone up over the last 50 years and that became the largest asset for most families. And that I think, is if you don't own and you rent, you miss out on that wealth creation possibility over the last multiple decades. So I agree there does need to be some financialization. It's interesting to have it be in this ecosystem. I guess maybe the point that I'm trying to make is the messaging around it and comparing it to mortgages to Yano's point is not something that I.
00:27:47.464 - 00:27:48.162, Speaker B: Thought that was bad.
00:27:48.216 - 00:28:13.994, Speaker A: Let me make one more financial. In my mind, financialization equals good. In my mind, it unlocks a bunch of opportunities and that's and like, if you think that NFTs are just like, you either think that NFTs are just tokens with pictures, in which case, yeah, you should financialize these tokens. And then on the other side, you think that NFTs are this really valuable thing that creator. In which case, yeah, financialization is also good. It was the messaging. And it wasn't just that messaging too.
00:28:13.994 - 00:29:03.878, Speaker A: It was actually like there's this strategy that they did that I thought was also not great, where they're incentivizing loans on the platform through these things called lending points, where the more lending points that you get, the more of the next AirDrop you get. And in the mortgage land, which were like if you just keep going with that analogy, there's this thing called reg N regulation N that it's known as the Mortgages Acts and Practices. It's the mortgage advertising rule, basically. And it prevents a bunch of over promoting and over advertising and doing deceptive advertising and mortgages. And to me, when I read this, I'm like, you are incentivizing people to do more than they should on this platform to farm the next AirDrop.
00:29:03.974 - 00:29:30.498, Speaker B: Oh, I agree with you. But my understanding of their point system was that they changed around. So they're incentivizing the lenders, not. The people who want to borrow an NFT buy now, pay later. So they're incentivizing people to provide liquidity and extend credit to people who want to buy. Because I think they're concerned of everyone. First of all, either gaming like playing some kind of game where you set an unreasonably high interest rate and then people default on it.
00:29:30.498 - 00:29:49.766, Speaker B: No one wants to pick it up, they scoop it up for a reasonable price and dump it immediately. That's the game that everyone has already outlined. But I think what they want to do is they want to provide a liquid market of sophisticated lenders, and those points are pushing people to not pull out, basically, and do that. That was my understanding of those points. Yeah.
00:29:49.948 - 00:29:58.940, Speaker D: I mean, it's the same way that they incentivize the trading of NFTs as well, which is you get points whenever you put out an offer, not when I buy something.
00:29:59.310 - 00:30:08.510, Speaker A: Mike, do you feel comfortable sharing what you're explaining to me about the difference between Leny Lori on Ave versus Compound versus Blur or on Blend?
00:30:14.130 - 00:30:42.090, Speaker B: I actually agree with everything you guys are saying. I just think it's important to provide some kind of devil's advocate versus I really do think for instance, I think being able to buy and sell stocks is good. Do. I think it's great that Robinhood basically pushes people into options because those are the highest margin products and that's what the order flow that Citadel wants to buy. I don't think that's like some there's a bell curve of financialization that I think is basically except you see what I did there?
00:30:42.160 - 00:31:13.934, Speaker C: Yeah, but I feel like this argument does not actually hold water when you just have other examples. Sugar is bad for you. Should we allow children to drink orange juice? Probably not, but that's like part of a balanced breakfast and also part of the food pyramid. That's not great. Every asset class benefits from financialization. Why shouldn't crypto? Have you seen the terms of auto loans? Like interest rate, interest only auto loans that jack up and refinance to whatever the new interest rate the Fed decides on. Those are pretty toxic and poisonous.
00:31:13.934 - 00:31:32.060, Speaker C: And not only do you have the industry for the loaning of that, you have the industry for the buying of those loans and chopping those up and syndicating those to pension funds. So, I don't know, I feel like crypto always gets put in this kind of, like, ideological corner of like, you shouldn't be doing those things. And those arguments just never hold water. If you look at the real world.
00:31:32.430 - 00:31:47.146, Speaker B: I agree with that. And you know what? Even as we're here, because the fundamental question that we're asking is do NFTs have value? And if NFTs have value, I think we would all say, then you should be able, to some degree of financialization is right and good and acceptable.
00:31:47.258 - 00:31:58.820, Speaker C: Define value, though. Does a car? Yeah, well, sure. I think that's the place. But what if you're not doing anything with your life and you're just like, speculating on this car because you want a cool one? I don't know.
00:31:59.270 - 00:32:11.030, Speaker D: I agree with the analogy. And six to 8oz of orange juice in the morning is probably healthy for you, but 60 to 80oz of orange juice is probably going to give you diabetes.
00:32:12.650 - 00:33:00.946, Speaker B: I agree. I think it's kind of everything in moderation, but it is because when we're here sitting and saying, is it right and good to be able to take out a loan basically to buy an NFT, we're like, oh, I don't know about that, and sort of making a value judgment there. But none of us question the ability to take out a loan on, say, ethereum or bitcoin or something like that. And 99% of the world would say that's completely unacceptable level of risk and that's not right and good. So do I think the marketing was a little aggressive? Do I think this is probably going to end in tears at some point? Probably. Do I have a philosophical problem with it? No. And the other thing that we haven't even really talked about is just like, close your eyes and imagine it's like a year and a half from now, the bull market is returning.
00:33:00.946 - 00:33:12.540, Speaker B: You have two options. You can either buy your NFT at full price, or you can buy now, pay later. Our value judgments aside, people are just going to do that.
00:33:14.110 - 00:33:28.526, Speaker D: You have two options. You can sell your NFT for some asset for ETH, or you can borrow against your NFT to get some liquidity on. Like, these things should exist. It's just a question. Know how pervasive they need to be.
00:33:28.708 - 00:33:55.062, Speaker C: You're always going to have people wanting to borrow against any asset that they own. I think the question is like, will there be lenders for that requisite borrow flow? And this actually makes it possible. So I'm all there for expanding the use cases of crypto. I feel no moral high ground over anybody borrowing or trading or being degenerate. If you want to do that, go light yourself on fire. I might even lend to you to go do that. But it is what it is.
00:33:55.062 - 00:33:56.520, Speaker C: I don't see the problem.
00:33:57.390 - 00:34:00.410, Speaker D: Just make sure you got the notifications turned on loud.
00:34:00.830 - 00:34:01.914, Speaker C: Make sure you got paid.
00:34:01.952 - 00:34:05.340, Speaker B: Your go on a camping trip after.
00:34:06.990 - 00:34:08.940, Speaker C: 30 hours is not that long.
00:34:09.630 - 00:34:36.280, Speaker B: I have one more question on this before you guys move on. So the way that buy now, pay later works, the monetization scheme in e commerce is I don't think it's a zerp thing. Michael, my understanding of the way it works is actually you get a 0% Apr loan because merchandisers are actually subsidizing that cost because the amount like your average I forget what the unit is. It's the amount that you spend on one average session or purchase or something like that goes up three or four times.
00:34:38.170 - 00:34:48.226, Speaker D: Yeah, but the platforms still have to pay the full price. So the firms put the money up and they borrow to be able to make that interest free loan.
00:34:48.258 - 00:35:25.460, Speaker B: So that's more of what got it. Got it. So my question to you guys would be, do you think there's ever a situation where Blend goes to basically charges NFT collections when they do their initial mint or drop or something like that, to offer buy now, pay later? Because just look at the impact that it's had on Azukis and maladys and punks. Like, if I were a Blend, I would be like, hey, we've got this market of people that are going to offer loans against your NFTs and that's going to result clearly in a higher floor price. But we got to get a little something something.
00:35:27.290 - 00:36:23.558, Speaker C: I think the primary asset issuer, facilitating leverage trading effectively of these NFTs is probably a non starter. I think it's something that you'll see like the cloak and dagger like governance. We're going to vote this in, we're going to get it going. I think it should be really good for projects until it's really terrible where there is no way that you can short NFTs. Right now, this is probably theoretically, if I were to go off and try to short NFTs, I would probably try to find an NFT perp to short and then I would try to immediately go off and get the spot NFT, whatever it might be. And literally the hard part about shorting crypto is that especially if it's a closely held coin, you can't make people give you their spot so that you can sell it into the market and close out your short on the perp. What you have to do is you have to actually go off and source that and horse trade and it's extremely difficult.
00:36:23.558 - 00:36:45.614, Speaker C: But on this you can literally just take people's NFTs. So I think you're going to see these things pump and then you're going to see someone smart like the GCR of NFT trading. Who knows, it's like a smaller cottage industry, but somebody's going to take a shot at all of these that have all this potential borrow flow that you can take and use to short. So double edged sword, to say the least.
00:36:45.812 - 00:36:48.586, Speaker D: Who's going to be the George Soros of NFTs.
00:36:48.778 - 00:37:21.880, Speaker C: I mean, you're going to make like $100 doing this stuff, so maybe the rest never going to be worth it. But I don't know, the peak valuations of Board API Club and stuff like that, that would have been extremely juicy. We had some guy in the last cycle approaching us trying to get all the top shot NFT cards so you could short them. It was like this rinky dank operation, it didn't end up working. This actually makes it possible, which is pretty scary. The NFT had a rough year, so.
00:37:23.850 - 00:38:05.590, Speaker B: They did. But I don't know, I kind of am with you, Jason. I agree with you to just bring it full circle. I think the way that it was marketed and something even after all this discussion, buy now, pay later for NFTs. I feel pretty confident that retail is not going to be on the winning end of that. But I also think you kind of have to choose, like, do you want a free market where people are allowed to make these decisions or do you want a market of TradFi where it's regulated all the way up to here and this is what you're allowed to do versus not. And maybe there are people out there that have thought in much more detail about me and maybe that's a false trade off, but that's kind of what I think of always.
00:38:05.660 - 00:38:07.490, Speaker D: I do think that whatever they want.
00:38:07.580 - 00:38:09.494, Speaker C: That'S my personal philosophy.
00:38:09.542 - 00:38:40.210, Speaker D: Yeah, same. I do think that we're going to see a lot more Nftx DeFi financialization opportunities. Like, there's going to be more AMMS that launch, there's going to be fungible tokens that are associated with these collections that's going to beget liquidity on these AMMS. We're going to see a lot more financialization of NFTs. And frankly, broadly, philosophically, I agree with all of that. And yeah, it just depends on how you want to approach it and who you're trying to attract.
00:38:40.710 - 00:39:12.342, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you guys want to chat briefly? I know I think coinbase earnings is going to come out too, and I want to check the results. But CRV USD launched this week, which is pretty cool. So I think we covered this a little while ago when we were talking about some of the new stables that are getting launched. So I would put go sort of in this bucket. But this is kind of the convergence of a couple of different protocols that started out with separate business models but are now converging. So I would put MakerDAO in that camp and Ave and curve.
00:39:12.342 - 00:40:22.498, Speaker B: But just to do a level set on what Curve is and why they're doing this and how it sort of makes sense is Curve is obviously a stable coin swap, sort of like uniswap, but instead of their kind of volatile assets, they'll only do like stable coins or pairs of something that are similar in price. So something like steep to ETH and they kind of dominate that pool. And they've been talking about launching a stable coin for a little while. We're recording this on Friday the fourth, and it looks like the first loan for CRB USD went live. And I guess the two things to note here is it's got to be a revenue driver for them. So, yeah, you basically have to borrow and there's an interest rate that ends up getting paid, which would be pretty good for Curve because it's an alternative revenue stream you could also imagine. I think the reason this sort of makes sense and one of our analysts, Dan Smith, is super bullish on this is right now there are these I'm blanking on the name, the three pool, basically with USDC, USDT and Dai, you could imagine a situation where Curve basically puts its own stablecoin in there.
00:40:22.498 - 00:41:22.280, Speaker B: And what's kind of interesting is there's kind of this similar to Coinbase, where there's going to be the race to zero in terms of fees. I think the general sentiment is that there's going to be fee compression in DeFi as well. If you had a pool where CRV was one of the assets that was in that pool, you could drop the fees, the trading fees to zero because you're earning interest income from the borrow of CRV. So it's kind of a way to subsidize going to zero cost. The other thing that's sort of cool about CRV, this is a little wonky, but it's an innovation in the liquidation mechanism. They have something called Llama, which is a little bit of a new twist on an AMM. So the way that liquidations happen historically is there's an oracle, and once your loan to value or whatever crosses over a certain threshold, then you basically just get liquidated and some surgery understands that and they liquidate and there's a price for doing that.
00:41:22.280 - 00:41:59.726, Speaker B: My general understanding of this, and I've only sort of dug in high level, is that when you reach a certain health check or health threshold, part of your position gets sold off and it's replaced with Curve, the stablecoin itself, which is actually pretty interesting. It's a much better user experience. So you don't just tick over a certain threshold, then your entire position is liquidated. It's a pretty cool mechanism. So that was a lot of me talking. I don't know how much you guys have dug into this or what your thoughts are on this new wave of stablecoins or Kirk.
00:41:59.758 - 00:42:50.210, Speaker A: In my I have a really high level view of this, which is that typically been pretty bearish on these protocol based stablecoins, but I was kind of ragging on Aave's stablecoin go when they announced it. But this one, seeing how they've structured, it makes me think that they're just going after Maker and that they're going after Die, basically. I've spent a lot of time at Maker, move on some things, and they've gotten a little bit stagnant and there's some key people who have left Maker recently. And I think Curve sees this huge opportunity to go after Maker right now. And that's my Zooming multi. That's what I would assume is the multi year vision here, is to go after Maker.
00:42:51.030 - 00:43:09.050, Speaker C: I think the liquidation mechanism is cool. You are basically warehousing the risk of that liquidation within the Curve stablecoin itself, but it certainly would help. And it's certainly something that Maker doesn't have in the worst case scenario where instead they just start printing Maker, which is really like a bad idea.
00:43:09.120 - 00:43:11.834, Speaker A: The lending liquidating AMM thing that they have.
00:43:11.872 - 00:43:12.362, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:12.496 - 00:43:15.142, Speaker A: Continuously liquidates and audits.
00:43:15.206 - 00:43:15.578, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:15.664 - 00:43:54.406, Speaker C: But it does it piecemeal so that you don't have like, hey Maker liquidators. Like everyone wake up. There's a 400,000 eat slug hitting the market. Is anybody prepared to bid? And, frankly, when all that stuff was happening last year around, like, I think the bad ones were in june, the liquidations, seeing those come down the pike of, like, there's 100,000 ETH about it's, just like, how is the system going to deal with this in a time where there is very little TradFi liquidity, very little retail liquidity, whatever. But it did work perfectly, frankly. There was on another Black Tuesday or whatever that incident was, that's because we.
00:43:54.428 - 00:43:56.726, Speaker D: Had someone on the Oracles putting the.
00:43:56.748 - 00:43:57.614, Speaker B: Thumb on the scale.
00:43:57.682 - 00:43:58.842, Speaker D: I don't know if you remember that.
00:43:58.896 - 00:44:38.530, Speaker C: Yeah, I do remember that there were some fortunate Oracle delays, but not having that is good. I just kind of wonder. Curve has now emitted a lot of its own token. There's not like a ton of rewards to go around. Like a lot of them already being claimed by the people who are doing the curve gauge farming. How do you bootstrap from zero to I think Maker has what's, like Maker's TVL? 7 billion or something? 5,000,000,002 of that's USDC, probably 3 billion of that is ETH. How do you actually meaningfully take share? The reason that Michael and I still use Maker is because we know that it's battle tested.
00:44:38.530 - 00:44:56.902, Speaker C: I don't think the appetite to put large amounts of ETH into new code bases is super high right now. So I think that's kind of my question is how impactful is this really? But yeah, the Curve team is smart. If nothing else, they'll figure out a way to game it effectively.
00:44:57.046 - 00:45:43.098, Speaker D: Totally agree with all of that. I think the only kind of perspective that I would include this past week we've spent some time with some regulators and talking to them about what their priorities are, especially from a crypto perspective. For the next six months. I think the sentiment coming out of those conversations is there's going to be a bill that includes and mostly features stablecoins as the primary kind of component of the regulation. I'm not saying that I actually agree with this is an interesting model. The new liquidation methods are awesome. It's going to be really difficult for a decentralized stablecoin, I think, to integrate into a legal framework in the US.
00:45:43.098 - 00:45:45.418, Speaker D: Going forward. And so when we're talking about how.
00:45:45.424 - 00:45:46.239, Speaker B: Do you break through, how do you.
00:45:46.239 - 00:46:20.200, Speaker D: Get to the size of Maker? Maker already has the distribution to be able to have Dai in all the places that it already has it integrated like Coinbase or any of their centralized providers. It's just going to be an uphill battle, I think, after this bill gets released, and I think the text is going to get released in the next couple of months, it will be difficult, I think, to be able to compete with some of the more centralized stablecoins, unfortunately. But that's kind of the broad stablecoin perspective that became more apparent this week.
00:46:21.450 - 00:47:03.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a question. This is a little in the weeds of curve and their whole tokenomics and everything, but I think people initially sort of got excited by this because kind of what I was mentioning before, it's a way to subsidize fees on some of their pools. And I think people generally agree it's going to be a race to the bottom. The question that I have for you though is sort of curves, tokenomics are sort of like bitcoin in that you sort of need the number to go up. They live and die by liquidity and the way that they direct liquidity to their pools is by emissions. And what they don't just like bitcoin, they have a deflationary supply schedule. I think it's like every year it's like 15% lower.
00:47:03.874 - 00:47:48.114, Speaker B: So they want to have basically a constant amount of dollar denominated value that they can use to incentivize liquidity into different pools. And so that's why the gauge and the lock rate, that Ve vote escrow mechanism is super important because they want to incentivize people to lock that curve up and not to go and sell it onto the open market. I feel like if they have their own sort of horse in that race then I feel like that takes away an enormous incentive for other people to lock their curve. This is a really smart team, I'm sure they've thought about this but I feel like it does risk destroying the golden goose kind of or the long game that they're playing. So I don't know if you guys have thought about that.
00:47:48.232 - 00:48:18.586, Speaker D: Well, the thing that I have thought about independent of this launch is curve launched when was it? August 2020. And if you remember, the largest locked at the time which gave you the most vote escrow curve was four years. So we're coming up on a year left of where I would assume most people put their locks. And so not only is it going to be hard because you've got less supply and less incentives and number has to go up for those incentives to.
00:48:18.608 - 00:48:19.818, Speaker B: Stay, you're going to have a lot.
00:48:19.824 - 00:48:27.520, Speaker D: Of unlocking of the token itself and not like that long of a time. So it's going to be really interesting to see how that plays out as well.
00:48:28.930 - 00:49:05.260, Speaker C: There's a lot of those cases, not just curve either. If you look at Arbitram, if you look at optimism, there's going to be multibillion dollar unlocks kind of like by early 2024. I think a lot of these are running towards product market fit and token economics that make sense before those unlocks hit. And frankly, my expectations of where the market is going, I think that a lot of these things might peak before the cycle itself peaks. You're kind of early at this point if your unlocks are coming in six months and you don't have things figured out. That's how I would at least kind of think about it.
00:49:06.430 - 00:49:18.046, Speaker B: Yeah, they're a smart team. I really like the stuff they ship and generally how they think about stuff. Yeah. No, that's cool. All right, what do you guys want.
00:49:18.068 - 00:49:18.640, Speaker A: To.
00:49:20.450 - 00:49:22.490, Speaker B: Have earnings come out yet for coinbase?
00:49:22.570 - 00:49:24.350, Speaker D: I was just tracking. I haven't seen anything.
00:49:24.420 - 00:49:48.602, Speaker B: Maybe we could talk a little bit about. I mean, I know we've talked about this before, but sort of in more Dgen sort of land here we've got pipe coin, which, depending on, I guess, how you're allocated, is the gift that keeps on giving, or it's like the bane of your existence, but that thing just keeps running. I think the market cap on it is 700 million or something right now.
00:49:48.656 - 00:49:57.100, Speaker A: Last time I checked, the market wants things to rip right now. It's just people want it. People want it.
00:49:58.030 - 00:49:59.146, Speaker C: I take crazy.
00:49:59.328 - 00:50:15.214, Speaker B: Yeah, that's nuts. It's done a lot more than I thought it was going to, for sure. We talked about that being an indicator. I'm curious, do you view that as just kind of noise and the markets do? What's going to do you take away from that?
00:50:15.252 - 00:50:15.774, Speaker D: Not at all.
00:50:15.812 - 00:50:16.110, Speaker B: No.
00:50:16.180 - 00:50:20.046, Speaker C: You need to read deeply into that stuff, even though it seems so silly.
00:50:20.238 - 00:50:24.660, Speaker A: It says you got to pull up your Fortune account. You got to work out right here.
00:50:27.830 - 00:50:31.510, Speaker C: Would this have happened in Q Four of last year? Absolutely not.
00:50:31.580 - 00:50:32.150, Speaker A: No.
00:50:32.300 - 00:50:36.806, Speaker C: Q Three? Probably not. Q Two? Certainly not. Like, it's been a year since this.
00:50:36.908 - 00:50:41.594, Speaker D: I was going to say I don't know if post luna, this happens in 2022 at all.
00:50:41.712 - 00:50:42.134, Speaker A: Totally.
00:50:42.182 - 00:51:16.098, Speaker C: And you're seeing these big LST farms. You're seeing these? L one meme coins. And there's also a reason why you don't see this on any other chain. ETH is the only chain with enough liquidity for this to possibly happen. And look at the burn today is 8000 ETH burned. You got ten K spent on ETH transaction fees overall today. You're probably looking at a scenario where if we get back to 4000, we're going to be breaking all time high fee revenues pretty easily by the start of the run.
00:51:16.098 - 00:51:53.090, Speaker C: And so people are starting to and it's not just about the trading volume. People are starting to self organize into these little groups that are searching for $10 million market cap, meme coins. And the hotball of money is turning itself over, and it's going around and round, and that's kind of what you need. You need, like, a sentiment recovery, and you need a credit recovery. And we still haven't seen that, but we're starting to check the boxes often. I talked to some guy who works at a different fund over the weekend, and they're more of a trading fund, and he was, Dude, like, my dopamine receptors are just so shot. I need something to trade at all times.
00:51:53.090 - 00:52:24.410, Speaker C: Pepe has been really big for me it's like water, take a walk around the block. But I think it's big that people are starting to do this stuff and even like the NFT VI stuff on blur and blend and all that stuff, that's great too. And guess what? It's just burning a bunch of ETH. So I'm here for it. Also, NFT phi is only an ETH l one phenomenon, just for the record. Yes, thanks for the comment.
00:52:26.510 - 00:52:56.146, Speaker D: Not to throw a whole wrench into this perspective, but one idea that I was contemplating recently is, okay, so the model is the model where 1559, you burn ETH as opposed to keeping it, but we're on track to burn about a million ETH, give or take, maybe even more than that over the next year. What if that was distributed back? I mean, it's going to be more, but I think two might be too much.
00:52:56.248 - 00:52:57.134, Speaker C: We'll see.
00:52:57.272 - 00:53:17.690, Speaker D: But what if that one to 2 million ETH was distributed back to stakers? That would immediately put the staking rate somewhere in the high teens, I think based on 15% being staked right now. Kind of an interesting concept of increasing the staking rate instead of burning it and having it be deflationary.
00:53:18.110 - 00:53:54.758, Speaker C: I think we're going to see major discussions on this. I listen to Anthony Cesano's Daily Guay podcast, like, basically every day, but he is kind of like a good temperature thermometer for what the ETH core devs are thinking. And he's thrown out a few different tidbits over the past couple of months. One is to what your point? Is it's 80 20 right now in terms of what gets burnt versus what gets given to stakers. Should it be 2080? So that was like one interesting one. The second one was a cap on the amount of ETH that's allowed to be staked to maintain a minimum APY. So that's another.
00:53:54.758 - 00:54:41.800, Speaker C: And then the third is the formula for the actual inflation is the square root of I don't know, it's just some math that I don't have on hand right now, but it's pretty complicated. And his thought process is like, should that be higher or should it be lower or should the equation be different? It's like the square root of some number and I'm sure it has mathematical significance but doesn't mean anything to me. And so I think those are going to be interesting concepts to go through, especially over time, because what happens if ETH scales 100 x and fees don't scale 100 x? We're going to need to start making changes and there's a long roadmap for ethereum. We're going to be at this for probably next five years, building the protocol, tweaking the economics. I don't think we've seen the last in terms of ETH economics and the potential changes to go in there.
00:54:42.650 - 00:54:44.150, Speaker A: Coinbase earnings.
00:54:45.210 - 00:54:46.680, Speaker C: Are we going to make it?
00:54:48.490 - 00:54:58.550, Speaker B: I just saw what happened. Oh, nice revenue beat.
00:54:59.530 - 00:55:02.910, Speaker C: Not surprising given the volatility in the quarter.
00:55:04.210 - 00:55:04.714, Speaker D: Jesus.
00:55:04.762 - 00:55:17.378, Speaker C: Carvana shares jump I mean, the block did well, coinbase did well, DoorDash didn't do well. Sorry, block. Not the block. Shopify way up.
00:55:17.544 - 00:55:19.090, Speaker A: Watch yourself, bands.
00:55:22.070 - 00:55:31.800, Speaker B: Wait, what? Outside of the so. It was a beat on revenue. How'd they do on trying to find it on their site? Yeah, I'm trying to find it too.
00:55:33.370 - 00:55:37.830, Speaker A: Beat on revenue. Little short on trading volume.
00:55:39.530 - 00:55:40.920, Speaker B: Could you share your screen?
00:55:41.470 - 00:55:49.882, Speaker A: I just typed in Coin revenue on Twitter and I'm scrolling through all the watcher group. We're at the point of the market where it's only like the watcher group.
00:55:49.936 - 00:55:51.740, Speaker B: All right, I got it, I got it.
00:55:52.270 - 00:55:55.166, Speaker D: All right, now Mike gets to share his screen here.
00:55:55.268 - 00:56:20.438, Speaker B: 1 second. I haven't looked at this yet, but I'm going to share. All right. At first glance, this looks a lot better. On the So net revenue came in at 736,000,000, only a loss of 79, which is huge. And humanly talk. That's amazing.
00:56:20.438 - 00:56:29.674, Speaker B: I mean, there's a huge headcount reduction and it didn't show up immediately because there's severance and stuff that you have to pay. But I'm sure some of that well, wait, so sorry.
00:56:29.712 - 00:56:30.780, Speaker A: Go back, go back.
00:56:31.950 - 00:56:34.950, Speaker D: The biggest number there is the adjusted EBITDA.
00:56:35.110 - 00:56:35.914, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:36.112 - 00:56:37.514, Speaker D: 284.
00:56:37.632 - 00:56:38.410, Speaker C: Damn.
00:56:39.390 - 00:56:40.140, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:40.690 - 00:56:42.720, Speaker D: A lot of this is non cash cost.
00:56:43.090 - 00:57:02.740, Speaker C: Yeah, man. My hope is that when all these tech companies, when interest rates get low again and they really reaccelerate, I just hope they don't hire all these people back. Just learn your lesson. No, more like yoga and smoothies. Just run a profitable business.
00:57:03.830 - 00:57:04.482, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:04.616 - 00:57:05.298, Speaker C: Wow.
00:57:05.464 - 00:57:08.018, Speaker D: Bad take on my part with the institutional.
00:57:08.194 - 00:57:09.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:09.212 - 00:57:10.390, Speaker C: Atrocious.
00:57:11.770 - 00:57:14.470, Speaker B: But to your credit, I mean, it's not like it didn't.
00:57:17.390 - 00:57:24.314, Speaker C: It'S like basically their biggest real source of revenue outside of transactions. Look at that.
00:57:24.352 - 00:57:25.850, Speaker A: Interest income, baby.
00:57:26.750 - 00:57:29.770, Speaker B: Quarter of a bill, I think. JPOW.
00:57:30.270 - 00:57:31.978, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say.
00:57:32.144 - 00:57:32.774, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:32.912 - 00:57:37.150, Speaker D: So blockchain rewards make sense because ETH is up in price.
00:57:37.220 - 00:57:37.694, Speaker B: Yes.
00:57:37.812 - 00:57:42.240, Speaker D: I would imagine that this jumps a lot more in Q Two.
00:57:44.610 - 00:58:17.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I would guess so, too. One thing that I've been surprised about, not to distract this too much, is CBE was one of the big liquid staking providers that enabled withdrawals post ChappellA, and they've lost market share since then, I think they're down something like 2%. And rocket pool has been crushing it. They had their Aura upgrade, I guess, and that's actually made a pretty big difference. But yeah, I think lido and rocket pool and FRAX were basically the big winners. And I don't really know why.
00:58:17.950 - 00:58:37.134, Speaker C: I mean, basically just Lido, but the other two or three are cool also. But I was having like 20, 30, 40,000 ETH days. It's cool that Rocket Pool added 3002 days ago, but it's time to pay market shares up.
00:58:37.252 - 00:58:56.774, Speaker B: I mean, the market share is up. I know it's always easy that you bet on the incumbent or whatever, but it is very hard to hold, like 70% plus market share for a long period. Of time. I think it's a tough thing. I'm not advocating for rocket pool out here. I mean, I like rocket pool. I actually think the Aura upgrade is super interesting, but I think the long.
00:58:56.812 - 00:59:30.126, Speaker D: Tail of LSTs is going to be a major narrative. I've said this before on this podcast, but it's going to be LST summer in my mind, because I agree with that. You've got like five to seven, very small at this point. LSTs that I think are going to grow relative in size and there's going to be all this infrastructure built around indexes for LSTs and you're going to have liquidity pools for LSTs. I think it's going to be interesting to see how material they become. But my guess is that's going to be a big narrative.
00:59:30.238 - 00:59:36.162, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the liquid staking just passed DEXes in terms of total value.
00:59:36.216 - 01:00:30.150, Speaker C: Locked in the and like, now all the LSTs are going to be, in short order, the ETH asset that is put into all these DEXes. That's why I kind of think FRAX is like an interesting model, albeit much smaller. It just kind of internalizes all of the endogenous yield that exists because of the LSTs on their stablecoin. I'm sure they're going to build their own decks and you can do that. I think the question is, will the regulators ever just say nope and kind of put a stop to it? Like, these things have a ton of different avenues to capture value. And so to Michael's point, I do think there will be some of them. Like, as much as I hate this, there will be like a magic Internet money, liquid staking token like Frog Nation rise up against the evil venture capitalists and who knows if it ends well or not, but that will definitely be a narrative.
01:00:31.290 - 01:00:35.654, Speaker B: So, Coin, the stock is up like three and a half. Yeah.
01:00:35.852 - 01:00:36.966, Speaker D: Not a ton.
01:00:37.148 - 01:00:38.102, Speaker B: Not a ton.
01:00:38.236 - 01:00:42.694, Speaker D: I think a lot of people expected this type of an outcome.
01:00:42.822 - 01:00:50.694, Speaker B: I agree. And I think they want to hear what Brian and crew have to say about regulation. I think it's going to be relatively.
01:00:50.742 - 01:01:06.530, Speaker D: Large, once again doubling down. I think that we're going to get some text in the next two to three months. It's going to be something that's sensible, it's going to be bipartisan in the House, and then it's just going to be a question of whether or not it can get through the Senate.
01:01:07.670 - 01:01:18.806, Speaker B: Jano, you asked earlier about the analysts not asking about base. Do you think that Coinbase wants the analysts to understand base at this point?
01:01:18.908 - 01:01:21.800, Speaker A: What did I ask about the analysts not asking about base?
01:01:22.410 - 01:01:26.120, Speaker B: I thought you'd mentioned at the beginning of this, like, that was part of.
01:01:27.710 - 01:01:38.860, Speaker A: Oh, I see what you're saying. Do I think that Coinbase actively doesn't want Wall Street analysts to understand base?
01:01:39.470 - 01:02:08.260, Speaker B: The thing that I'm asking, this isn't a Mikey Belito original thought. I'm sort of borrowing this from someone who planted this idea in my brain. I don't want to blow up his spot. The one negative potential downside of base is it might end up drawing a lot of scrutiny to what's going on in centralized sequencer land on the roll up layer. And I'm not really sure if you want that many eyeballs on that, frankly. No.
01:02:11.690 - 01:02:13.080, Speaker A: I don't think you do.
01:02:14.650 - 01:02:24.602, Speaker C: That's the thing. I think regulation, some of it's going to be good. Some of it's going to be like, you can't do that anymore, right? It'll be black and white.
01:02:24.656 - 01:02:33.260, Speaker D: Some things will be white, some things will be black. But I do think one of the things that I think there's going to be two things that come out of this. Number one.
01:02:35.570 - 01:02:37.726, Speaker B: Number one, how do you.
01:02:37.748 - 01:02:50.770, Speaker D: Go from being a security to a commodity is going to be an interesting thing that gets defined. The other one is what does decentralized mean? Is it five nodes, three nodes, 21 nodes? Who knows?
01:02:53.750 - 01:03:03.400, Speaker A: I don't think I can share this now. I'll tell you that after we stop, before we do a lame podcast thing today. But there's a new l Two coming from a big company.
01:03:04.010 - 01:03:04.950, Speaker C: Hell yeah.
01:03:05.100 - 01:03:19.340, Speaker A: I think we're going to start seeing a lot more base like things launch where companies are like, oh, damn, smart idea. Let me go launch an l two with one with a fully centralized sequencer. All right, sounds good. Down.
01:03:20.290 - 01:03:26.554, Speaker C: I mean, if you have money transmitter licenses, have at it. I think coinbase I agree. There's many such cases.
01:03:26.602 - 01:03:28.000, Speaker A: I think companies with money.
01:03:31.010 - 01:03:53.910, Speaker B: You know, it is funny. Sometimes we're off in our own little crypto land doing mechanism design and stuff like that. And I've been getting pretty deep into the weeds and mev this season. I saw this take from this guy on Twitter, Ceteris Parbos. I can't find the tweet. I was just looking for it, but it was like the unpopular opinion. But mev is going to be solved in an off chain way.
01:03:53.910 - 01:04:06.940, Speaker B: It's called going to jail. I kind of agree with him. It's like, yeah, dude, what's all this mechanism designed for? Preventing sandwiches like you go to jail. That's called front running. We got a law about that.
01:04:07.630 - 01:04:15.600, Speaker C: We've seen a few big Mev players stop doing it over the past couple of weeks. Not going to name any.
01:04:15.970 - 01:04:16.720, Speaker B: Wow.
01:04:17.890 - 01:04:36.180, Speaker C: They were the largest block builders and just like well known TradFi names and they just stopped and they've stopped doing some forms of mev but have continued doing others. And so from the outside looking in, it feels like a lawyer got to them and was like, some of this is not okay to be mean.
01:04:36.730 - 01:04:43.138, Speaker D: The other piece of news that happened this week was Nate from OpenSea officially charged.
01:04:43.314 - 01:04:46.920, Speaker A: Man yeah, I saw guys, what do you guys think of this?
01:04:49.210 - 01:05:08.350, Speaker C: I mean, he did something wrong. I think that's know you shouldn't do that stuff in general, I think just reading through the Financial Times article, the sentence is like, maximum of 40 years. Does the punishment fit the crime?
01:05:08.850 - 01:05:10.750, Speaker D: He made $1,000.
01:05:10.900 - 01:05:35.830, Speaker C: He hasn't been sentenced. Right, but I've met him once. I think Michael might have as well. He seemed like a pretty nerdy but nice guy. And yeah, I mean, it's obviously illegal to do that, but it was such a small amount that going to jail for 40 years feels like just like a lot for that type of violation.
01:05:36.490 - 01:05:45.260, Speaker D: I mean, he got convicted of fraud, which is a felony no matter what the sentence is.
01:05:46.910 - 01:05:56.160, Speaker C: That's tough. I think he also went to court at probably the worst time, sentiment wise, for crypto. Zach, you're not going to get the benefit of the doubt with generally anybody.
01:05:58.450 - 01:06:05.822, Speaker A: I think he goes to jail for less than a year, gets probation and a fine, but he still has a felony on his record, which sucks.
01:06:05.966 - 01:06:06.610, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:06:06.760 - 01:06:47.022, Speaker A: And like, dude, what it's worth, I do think what he did, the definition of insider trading is pretty clear. Like, you're the head of a product for a marketplace, there's a level of responsibility that comes with that title and in that role, you know exactly what's going on and you know what you're doing there. So therefore, I think what he did was wrong. I think the punishment is wild and fair, and I think both those can be correct. And I also think that the regulators here are looking in so the wrong direction here. They're like going after this 50K thing or 60, however much it was. And meanwhile, there's a bunch of other stuff they should be looking at.
01:06:47.156 - 01:07:11.080, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, you know what I think? No commenting on what he actually did, which whatever, but I think it's just important to have some empathy. Like, everyone knows his name now and that he did that's. Because to be honest, okay, the jail would definitely suck the felony if he works in crypto. I'm not really sure that impacts his job prospects, to be completely honest with you, but.
01:07:13.210 - 01:07:19.080, Speaker D: I do come on, Mike. Yeah.
01:07:20.330 - 01:07:32.266, Speaker B: Wow. Fair point. I don't know. I've met the guy, but I don't know, I think it does suck to have your name just like, splashed all over like that and to be the poster boy, because that's what he is, like the poster.
01:07:32.298 - 01:07:32.682, Speaker A: Totally.
01:07:32.746 - 01:07:33.930, Speaker B: And that just sucks.
01:07:34.090 - 01:07:35.310, Speaker A: That really sucks.
01:07:36.450 - 01:07:42.030, Speaker C: He's going to have all that time to think about just that one fucking click of the mouse.
01:07:44.130 - 01:07:45.826, Speaker D: I think it was more than one.
01:07:46.008 - 01:07:52.050, Speaker C: Yeah, there was a few. He was a repeat offender, but yeah, don't do that.
01:07:52.120 - 01:08:20.022, Speaker A: This isn't just NFT land, by the way. There was this woman named Anne Herbert, I think it was. She was a Nike employee for 25 years, and I think she was flipping Nikes on the secondary based on, like because she had access to the memos that the CEO was going to send out. I'm probably getting this story really wrong, but she got fired, and I think she might face some time, like, that's illegal, and she was selling them on StockX or something like that.
01:08:20.176 - 01:08:24.000, Speaker D: If it feels like it's an unfair advantage, don't do.
01:08:27.570 - 01:08:28.574, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:08:28.772 - 01:08:29.566, Speaker C: Always.
01:08:29.748 - 01:08:42.740, Speaker A: Speaking of unfair advantages, blockworks launched Hub this week, which is the most powerful governance platform in crypto. So if you want unfair advantage in governance, if you own governance tokens, you should subscribe to Blockworks research.
01:08:43.350 - 01:08:44.638, Speaker B: Always be selling.
01:08:44.734 - 01:08:47.590, Speaker C: So are you guys just going to be like, massive delegates?
01:08:49.210 - 01:08:51.320, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to be delegates. Yeah.
01:08:51.850 - 01:08:52.646, Speaker C: Wow.
01:08:52.828 - 01:08:56.582, Speaker D: Okay, we got some totins. We might delegate to you.
01:08:56.636 - 01:09:04.394, Speaker A: Every crypto venture firm cannot be active in governance right now. And we got you.
01:09:04.512 - 01:09:16.878, Speaker B: There's a certain amount of fit. I mean, our analysts, they only check, they only keep up to date with three protocols at a time. They are so in the weeds with this stuff. They're the ones that you'd want to.
01:09:16.884 - 01:09:22.720, Speaker C: Delegate, so don't govern too hard. You and Nate might be seeing each other at some point.
01:09:23.410 - 01:09:37.960, Speaker B: All right, just to end this on a more uplifting note, like a funny story of the week, I don't know if you saw that pornhub pulled out of Utah. Do you guys see this? I saw the headline because of the KYC stuff.
01:09:38.890 - 01:09:41.720, Speaker A: Why do you think Vance just left Utah? The guy was there for like, six.
01:09:43.530 - 01:09:45.030, Speaker D: Show us your tabs.
01:09:45.850 - 01:09:51.940, Speaker A: Show us the tabs. All right, everyone, hope you have a good rest of your week, good Friday, and see you guys next week.
