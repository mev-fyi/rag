00:00:27.382 - 00:00:53.562, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Maverick Protocol, a suite of liquidity tools built around an innovative AMM. Maverick helps token projects Dow, Treasuries, LPs, or basically anyone in DeFi shape their liquidity with efficiency and flexibility. How, you might ask? Stick around and you're going to be hearing about them more later. Now on with the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. You got Michaels one and two and Miles, our 6th man standing in. Fellas, welcome.
00:00:53.696 - 00:00:57.662, Speaker B: It's really just the third man because it's really just about the Michaels here.
00:00:57.716 - 00:01:01.774, Speaker A: I know, but with any sports reference, I don't want to change too much because I don't want to get it wrong.
00:01:01.892 - 00:01:03.658, Speaker C: Play it safe. Play it safe.
00:01:03.834 - 00:01:05.706, Speaker B: You had that one written out beforehand, Mike.
00:01:05.738 - 00:01:07.118, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm like looking at my hand.
00:01:07.204 - 00:01:10.740, Speaker C: 6Th man, that's his go to stick with it.
00:01:12.070 - 00:02:01.570, Speaker A: All right, we actually got a bunch of stuff to cover this week, so why don't we just get right into I maybe a bit of a feel good story here would be maybe feel good is not the right word, but Coinbase has gotten regulatory approval to enable retail's perpetuals future trading. So just the history. I mean, most of us think about Coinbase as being the entity that's domiciled here in the US publicly listed company. In May of this year they launched Coinbase International, which is an international entity which yeah, they basically moved offshore and they allowed institutional traders to trade via API. So they started with BTC and ETH perps that are settled in USDC today. And that's going to be for retail traders coming later this year. So it's pretty interesting.
00:02:01.570 - 00:02:33.918, Speaker A: Coinbase is making moves. This is just the latest in a series of data points, which is companies that are based out of the US. But trying to capitalize on international demand. So this past quarter, just again on the institutional segment, coinbase International did over just around five and a half billion in terms of volume. So that's not an enormous amount compared to the rest of their business, but that's not nothing either, especially in their first quarter. That's pretty guys, what do you guys think about this?
00:02:34.004 - 00:03:33.470, Speaker B: I think even further, it kind of highlights the differences between what US customers are allowed to do and what non US. Customers are allowed to do. Obviously this is a non US product, but if we look at it and just looking at Coin glass, the last 24 hours there was almost 75 billion in perps volume and obviously most of that, or I would probably say 70, 80%, just looking at the charts, maybe a little 60, 60% is finance. So at the same time, when you have at least at this point, kind of rumors of action against finance or some sort of process there, you've got Coinbase making moves and we saw this with institutions. May, I think, or June, it'll be really interesting to see the interest from the retail side as well. So I think very exciting. Overall, it'll become an interesting data point to watch over the next few months.
00:03:33.540 - 00:04:27.614, Speaker C: I would just add I think Coinbase has struggled with this challenge of trying to keep up with the pace of their competitors. If you think about the asset listings, that took a long time for them to come around on kind of opening that up. And I could see this just kind of being the blueprint for more products where they don't feel that comfortable in the US. But you can basically test it out, get it used and battle tested with international customers and then kind of use that as supporting evidence when you try to get this approved in the US. Say this has been working for a very long time. Right? So, yeah, I think it's interesting and definitely the timing of it couldn't be better with some of these incumbents, I would say we don't really know what's going on, but sentiment is definitely a little shaky on them. But yeah, it will be very interesting to see where they're able to get adoption.
00:04:27.662 - 00:05:14.930, Speaker B: Kind of interesting point. Anybody who's been in Crypto the last three, four years knows this, but just the product differences between a perpetual future versus an option and obviously retail. I think the movie comes out like literally tomorrow dumb money. You've got retail options being flavor de jour product for retail equities traders. It's going to be interesting to see if any of that ever carries over into equities markets. But it seems like Perps, at least for the time being, until you have a strong enough product capability to enable real options, perps is going to be the product of favor for crypto. And I think that's another point of recognition for Coinbase doubling down into retail futures.
00:05:14.930 - 00:05:17.010, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be interesting.
00:05:17.160 - 00:06:13.150, Speaker A: Well, I don't know how much you've looked into zero day telepry options, but isn't that pretty similar to Perps? And I think it's kind of the same thing right? There's sort of a funny path dependency here in terms of options became the instrument du jour for retail day traders and speculators. But to be honest, options are a much more complicated product than something like a perpetual. Actually, I remember listening to an interview with Jim O'Shaughnessy father, Patrick of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. He was like, I'm old enough to remember when options were used for hedging and that's why you had them to start with. But what they've morphed into is this vehicle for speculation just because the dynamic of you put up a certain amount of premium. There's leverage embedded in the products. They're really good for gambling, too, but maybe perpetuals are just a much simpler product, and especially in crypto where you want to concentrate liquidity.
00:06:13.150 - 00:06:21.382, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's tough to see a world in the short to even midterm where options take off that much.
00:06:21.516 - 00:06:46.250, Speaker B: I mean, you hit the nail on the head. It's leverage. It's implied leverage. Right. And the first products that I ever, I guess you could call it, traded. The first products that I ever bought were long dated options on tech companies in college. And that was because if you did some basic math, you just had to kick out the expiry for two years and you said, okay, well, I've got enough coverage here for the next year and a half before they actually expire.
00:06:46.250 - 00:07:01.540, Speaker B: And it's kind of an implied, like, three to five x leverage. And what better way to do that when your capital base is small like a college kid? But I think you're going to see perps become that same desired product.
00:07:02.550 - 00:07:34.814, Speaker A: I agree. Especially maybe to add a little bit of nuance. It probably makes sense at some point for there to be an options market for the majors like Bitcoin or Ether. But I think when you start to talk about options for shitcoins, that's where it really doesn't make that much sense to me, because the investment profile of a let's call it what it is in a liquid shitcoin is already kind of like an option. So it's kind of like a dress on a dress type thing. I just don't think it makes a lot of sense. I don't know.
00:07:34.852 - 00:07:37.200, Speaker B: 100 X on 100 X is a lot.
00:07:38.130 - 00:07:39.390, Speaker A: Do that math.
00:07:40.130 - 00:07:41.120, Speaker B: 10,000.
00:07:41.810 - 00:08:12.390, Speaker A: I'm looking forward to seeing the Dumb Money movie. It could have gone either way in terms of the narrative, and it seems like, based on what I've seen in terms of the trailer, is that the narrative is the sort of marauding, evil, weirdly incompetent. At the same time Wall Street guys get their lunch eaten by this clever retail trader, clever Internet sleuth guy who you want to identify with. Beat a rig game is the narrative they went with. And it could have gone the other way, too.
00:08:12.460 - 00:08:14.694, Speaker B: I think one of the narratives is community wins.
00:08:14.742 - 00:09:02.246, Speaker A: Hey, everyone wanted to take a quick second to shout out this season's partner Maverick Protocol. Now, many of you probably know Maverick as an innovative AMM, which they are, but in reality, they're a lot more than that as well. Maverick is a suite of tools for DeFi users and builders that allows them to put liquidity where it will get the most work done. Since Maverick launched in March, they have been gobbling up market share. And at the time of this recording, which is the end of September, on a trailing seven day volume basis, maverick is now a top three decks by volume and they support over 50% of the volume on the L two ZK Sync era chain. Maverick enables LPs and token pairs to process higher volume with limited TVL, which allows them to support some of the highest levels of capital efficiency for LSTs, like Wrap Steep. Another very cool feature is something called Maverick Boosted Positions.
00:09:02.246 - 00:09:44.662, Speaker A: So that allows protocols looking to bootstrap their token liquidity to target the shape of liquidity of any token pair with surgical precision. Maverick is backed by some of the leading institutions in crypto founders Fund, Pantera, Coinbase Ventures, Binance Labs. They are all backing Maverick in their vision to revolutionize the next generation of DeFi DApps and helping them build their liquidity in all market conditions. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. Let them know that I sent you. Thanks guys. What do you guys make of there was an article in the Wall Street Journal this week about binance melting some there's been speculation about huobi for a very long time.
00:09:44.662 - 00:10:29.154, Speaker A: Adam Cochrane wrote a big Tweet thread about how he doesn't think they're solvent anymore. We've been hearing these rumors for a while. My baseline assumption is that a lot of these exchanges aren't always 100% above board, if we're just being totally honest. So it wouldn't surprise me. But I don't know how to diligence that risk anymore, or handicap that risk. Rather, I think, in terms of the media. I actually was talking to someone who's been in marketing comms for a long time, both in web two finance and crypto, and she expressed this sentiment, which is the only coverage that is hitting in mainstream media right now is negative stuff because that's the only thing that's getting the headlines.
00:10:29.154 - 00:11:03.570, Speaker A: And even a lot of the really good reporters who work in mainstream media, they also have editors, right? And your editor might not be bought in. So we're at the point in the cycle where the only stuff that is making it through the editorial sort of headwall of mainstream press is just roundly negative stuff. So on the one hand, could there be something to this binance news? Absolutely. On the other hand, could it be kind of this quirk of media? I think it could also be that I don't know if you guys have any more thoughts or insights there.
00:11:03.720 - 00:11:33.686, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, also it depends. Let's say this goes from beyond speculation and maybe we start seeing actual withdrawals. Or let's just imagine customers really care about this full solvency thing. I think they've got two new options, or at least one new option in Coinbase. And then like, that launch is going to be interesting as well. Right? And at least Coinbase, you can trust that they're solvent. Duidx.
00:11:33.686 - 00:12:01.998, Speaker C: You don't have to trust anybody can hold your own. Right? So if that actually turns out to be like something customers really care about, then we'll see. I think these market share numbers change over the next six to twelve months. It typically hasn't been something that customers care about until it's almost too late, unfortunately. So it's not something I necessarily am expecting in the near term, but I think it's know, outside the realm of possibility.
00:12:02.094 - 00:12:48.500, Speaker B: No comments on specific exchanges or their solvency. I think there's just this tendency know, left of the bell, curve it and say looks like FTX, therefore it should be similar. And I think moving past that narrative will be important. I mean, just looking at it right now, bitcoin and ETH number three, number four, and number five is the CME. So you also have an option from a perpetuals exchange that's obviously regulated, highly regulated in the US to be able to trade on the CME, but it's still at 3 billion for Bitcoin and Finance, yesterday was 13. So those options do exist. I think there's definitely just kind of like an interest.
00:12:48.500 - 00:13:33.314, Speaker B: There's an interest to be able to trade in a safe manner, obviously, and trust your counterparty. But I think there's also just an effect of all your assets are on finance. And maybe most people don't trade the long tail of assets other than Bitcoin and ETH, but if you've got assets there, that becomes your cross margin capability to be able to go off and trade perpetuals. And you could have that cross margin and that collateral be based in something that's not US dollar denominated. It could be in any of the long tail assets. So I think there's an element of the product is really good and I think that's not really changing anytime soon. Maybe some of this smoke becomes fire from all the rumors that we've all heard, but I don't know.
00:13:33.352 - 00:14:09.862, Speaker C: No, it is super interesting where I think product capabilities have been prioritized over trust in this market, but in all other traditional markets. I spent the first six and a half years of my career at Fidelity and all we did is sell trust, right? We did not push the envelope on products we absolutely could have many times. Right? But I think that that's when it's maybe like going after a slightly different sort of market that has different preferences that do value trust above all, and we know that that's likely going to be like the larger long term market anyways.
00:14:09.926 - 00:14:39.874, Speaker B: Maybe we're also talking about two different markets, people who value product capabilities right now, and maybe we've seen that top or the relative size of that, but the much larger. There was something that he was talking about at the DTCC and they settled $4 quadrillion worth of value last year. We're talking about markets that are just orders of magnitude larger ultimately.
00:14:40.002 - 00:15:35.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you. What do you think about I saw Ari Paul actually do a Tweet thread this week about sort of expressing with more detail a theory that I've heard bandied about in crypto, which is basically there's going to be I'm paraphrasing here, so if I get some stuff exactly wrong but there are going to be two markets for crypto. You could get a scenario where crypto is bifurcated into a more regulated and a more permissionless market. And we've heard about this a lot, I think in the past where there's sort of called KYC Phi. There are attempts at KYC l two S, to be honest, is probably an opportunity for base to do some amount of KYC or proof of personhood or whatever so that you can avoid sibling and that type of thing. And then there's going to be a more open permissionless sort of casino, wild west portion of crypto. What do you guys think about that cleaving of those two worlds? Or do we end up more with a more generic compromise?
00:15:35.890 - 00:16:14.574, Speaker B: I'm going to split it right down the middle and say my vision for how ultimately a lot of this stuff will end up working is you're never going to be able to get a permissionless protocol to abide by all the different rules and regulations for every single country around the world. It's not just the US. There's now going to be mica in the EU. There's going to be regulations in Singapore, Japan, Korea. I mean, everybody's coming out with their own flavor of all of this. And I think you're going to see not the separation horizontally, you're going to see the separation vertically. And it's not going to be something where you've got permissioned and permissionless.
00:16:14.574 - 00:16:57.454, Speaker B: You've got permissionless protocols which have capabilities and features and controls in place, and then you've got user experiences or applications that have the customer relationship that then access the protocols. And I think that delineation probably makes more sense. Obviously, I think part of this would also require regulatory changes where everybody starts to agree, hey, if you're not accessing this directly and it's an interface that owns the customer relationship, that owns the customer, therefore the KYC AML and then the protocols are permissionless. I don't know if that is totally clear with most regulators right now, but ultimately I think that's where we're heading, so I would kind of flip it around 90 degrees.
00:16:57.502 - 00:18:06.742, Speaker C: Michael, I largely agree with you and I think it's super interesting to think about. There's going to be a range of these requirements and which ones can you satisfy at that front end level or outside of the protocol itself? Right. Something that we were thinking about is with Micah, one of those requirements that's non obvious is having emergency response action processes in place if there's ever something wrong. And that's fundamentally not something you can do at the if they're in that world, you could make the argument that to be compliant, like a protocol needs to be able to have circuit breakers if there is ever an exploit going on or something like that. And that is where I think it's a little bit less obvious how we're going to navigate that and where you could see just like splits maybe when it actually has to touch the protocol. But I think things like KYC and all that stuff, I totally agree that can be layered on and there could be two very different types of experiences while interacting and the protocol is kind of like the back end.
00:18:06.796 - 00:18:29.838, Speaker B: And it's also possible you've got UIs that don't do KYC and those are just permissionless UIs and they're accessing the protocol as well. But that's an interesting point on having the emergency response circuit breaker. I would imagine that's where regulatory confines meet permissionless protocols, it's going to be interesting.
00:18:29.924 - 00:18:40.914, Speaker C: No, I think there will be really cool solutions that come out specifically to address these challenges because otherwise we don't really get to the best version of this.
00:18:40.952 - 00:19:29.890, Speaker A: I tend to agree with that. There is a part of me whenever we talk about this and I think this conversation is being had a little bit around the intense part of crypto right now. But what I think people are coming to the conclusion is that navigating, this is extremely navigating. Being on chain is very difficult. Most people will not navigate and directly interface with a bunch of these protocols. So instead we're going to rearchitect this where third parties on your behalf interface with protocols for you. And a little part of me is like, man, that makes so much sense because A just look at the security concerns of being on chain b it's already too complicated even for someone like me who spends a lot of time doing stuff like this.
00:19:29.890 - 00:20:00.714, Speaker A: It's very difficult, it's not a good user experience and I feel nervous when I'm doing it most of the time. But on the other hand, as soon as you start to reintroduce third parties who act on your behalf and one thing I've always you hear this a lot, which is as long as the back end is decentralized, that's the important thing. And a little voice in the back of my head has always been like, yeah, but if everything is built around the front end and at some point it becomes too difficult or technical to interface with the back end, what's the major difference there for certain people?
00:20:00.752 - 00:20:35.830, Speaker B: They're going to really want that. They want the handholding, they're going to want to be able to call someone, they're going to want to know that all of their money and all the value that they have in their wallet is staying put. And for other people who may be more crypto native, it'll be more like, hey, I just need a clean UI to be able to access this with my noncustodial wallet. And this is also kind of the point. There's going to be rules and regulations for geographies and we can't get around that. But I also think there's going to be different flavors of all the different types of interfaces that people will want there'll be something kind of for everybody.
00:20:35.900 - 00:21:27.890, Speaker A: Let's move on to our next story here. Maybe, Miles, I can pick on you. You just wrote a great very timely, as it turns out, post on Reverie about this, what I would sort of call the Ras landscape and the interaction that roll up as a service has with their frameworks and then also shared sequencing. So I'd like to poke at you to just describe sort of why you wrote that post, what the post says, and then also Andrew Huang, the founder at Conduit, released something two days ago. So on Tuesday, which is the Conduit elector, which is a new standard for sequencers, which kind of opens up the door to the possibility of shared sequencing in the future. But you just start by just giving us an overview of how you see roll up as a service and sort of the tendency to vertical the incentives to vertically integrate totally.
00:21:27.970 - 00:22:41.038, Speaker C: I'll just give a little bit of context of why this is super interesting to me. We are very active on the Cosmos side, and so we've been thinking about the benefits of what you get with an app chain. But we also have seen really all the pain points, and in particular the fact that despite everything you can do, there are very few teams with the competence and the desire to operate all the back end infrastructure of a chain. And there are very few teams that actually know how to harness that infrastructure for the application itself. That said, the benefits clearly resonate with developers and so we now have app chains on Ethereum that have basically created a combination of these app chain frameworks and roll up as a service providers have created a much lighter weight way to get your app chain into prod. You don't need to have chain experts on your team in order to stand up your roll up anymore. You don't need to have DevOps which are resources that are taking away from time spent or capital invested into the core product and growing the user base.
00:22:41.038 - 00:23:26.960, Speaker C: Right? In general, I just don't think the majority of future application teams are going to be experts on roll up frameworks. I think I see a future where they love this idea. They love having the control, the value capture like the customization, but they're going to want some help. And so you go to a roll up as a service provider. This roll up as a service provider initially is like an It consultant telling you, okay, here are the stack that I think best fits your use case. Here are all of the third party integrations that would bring basically the user experience and the developer experience to parity with if you were building on a big L one. Right.
00:23:26.960 - 00:24:13.710, Speaker C: And we're going to make sure a lot of what we're selling you as well is reliability. Right? We're going to make sure that your roll up does not go down as you grow from zero users to 1000 to 10,000 to 10,0000. Right. And we've seen a lot of roll ups go down, frankly. So this is like, it's a very web two sort of approach to solving this, which has always very resonated with me, a lot like let the developers work on what they're good at, which is building products and growing user bases. We'll handle everything else that's undifferentiated. But it also puts these Rasp providers in a position really, I would say, like desirable position of the sequencer operators.
00:24:13.710 - 00:25:22.260, Speaker C: And so I guess part of what I wrote the piece about is if you were a roll up framework, ideally you'd want your own Rasp provider because this is kind of a way to monetize your framework without putting any burden through revenue shares or licensing fees that probably act as basically impedes adoption. And so I just think it's a really interesting dynamic between all these different stakeholders. And then of course, shared sequencers come in. So what Conduit put out earlier this week is definitely, I want to be clear here, it's not saying that Conduit is putting out a shared sequencer. It is more saying here we've got this basically a consensus, a rotating consensus of sequencers that we operate. And this ensures that if one goes down, it immediately goes to the next. Within the set, we can increase your uptime and reliability relative to if you were running this yourself or even if you hired a different Ras provider who's just running one sequencer for you.
00:25:22.260 - 00:26:31.090, Speaker C: That said, it does open up the possibility that Ras providers could break into a shared sequencer market because all they have to do is say, here's our rotating consensus, today it's just us, but we'll actually open this up to third parties. And so you can see how I think Ras has planted itself in kind of like backend infrastructure services and consulting, but it can quickly expand into shared sequencers if it wants to. I think shared sequencers are trying to go the other way around and I think they will try to expand into different sort of infrastructure services or maybe integration services. So I think all of the frameworks, the Rasp providers and the shared sequencers, I think they're on relatively friendly terms today, but we're starting to see the early signs of how these are inevitably going to compete for value capture. And so yeah, I think that's a brief overview. We can post my piece of content in the show notes here. As a self shill.
00:26:31.170 - 00:26:40.894, Speaker B: One question we talk about internally, but also I've been thinking a lot about is at the steady state, or maybe not the terminal state, but like steady state, how many roll ups do you think they're going to be?
00:26:40.932 - 00:26:43.630, Speaker A: I think that is at the core of what we're talking about here.
00:26:43.700 - 00:27:50.238, Speaker C: My general view on this is that the incentives to own more of the stack become stronger as you grow. I would say when you're first launching a project, the incentives are really point towards launching on a general purpose chain because the benefits you get are at their absolute lowest point. When you have zero users and the trade offs are at their highest point, you're doing a lot of work basically to own your own block space. That said, so I'm not super bullish on there being like immediately a huge long tail of app specific roll ups. That said, I think you could see this sort of like pyramid here where you have these layer one, like launch pads or maybe it's general purpose L two S. And then as projects grow, if they have the leverage to take their users with them, they will. And I think a lot of this also kind of depends on breaking some trade offs that currently exist around Interoperability.
00:27:50.238 - 00:28:35.570, Speaker C: And if you can do that, then this path, maybe it opens up a longer tail as well. But yeah, Mike and I have been kind of going back and forth on that same question ourselves this week. Eclipse is kind of like the opposite, right? Eclipse is now saying like, hey, we were doing these app specific roll ups for a long time. Honestly, we've talked to customers out there and we think we can get the 80% of the benefits that matter by having local fee markets and parallelization. The problem is not the fact that you need your own block space. The problem is these single threaded EVM chains. If you can just get away from that, then you don't need your own blockchain necessarily.
00:28:35.570 - 00:28:46.920, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think that there is a difference in this equation. If we're talking about EVM versus SVM and also obviously what size you are.
00:28:47.930 - 00:29:22.480, Speaker A: I don't know, I've waffled a little bit on this. I don't know about ultimate end state, I don't know about 20 years. I just think that's I'd be making stuff up. But let's just say foreseeable sort of future five year time frame. I feel like it depends on how effective upgrades like Dank Sharding are. A lot of it's going to come down to Cost. A lot of it's going to come down to how comfortable the market becomes with outsourcing DA to solutions like Celestia or Avail or whatever.
00:29:22.480 - 00:29:29.982, Speaker A: But even with that, I would guess it's somewhere between two and four big roll ups.
00:29:30.126 - 00:29:41.314, Speaker C: Roll up frameworks or roll up frameworks. But then within those frameworks, like how much of the activity is centered on their general purpose platform chain versus spread.
00:29:41.362 - 00:30:19.166, Speaker A: Across a roll app, I actually think there's going to be a diversity of different business models there. I've recently gone a little my mental framework has shifted a little bit. At one point I thought everyone was going to copy the Op stack and that was clearly going to be the way to go. And now I'm less convinced about that. And partially it is the local. Fee markets of the SVM. And frankly, even Monad, a team like Monad, they'rearchitecting the EVM, and I think there's going to be a way that we can figure out the noisy neighbor problem with local fee markets.
00:30:19.166 - 00:30:50.406, Speaker A: And you trade off some amount of customizability, like the big thing that you're giving on the table. You can't decide your own block time, for instance, but you get composability and it's going to really depend on your application. But I think multiple different models will flourish there. I don't think it has to be like one or the other miles you and I were looking at. There was actually a really great even between something like Arbitrum and optimism. Stephen Goldfeder, I believe it was tweeted something. We'll link it in the show notes.
00:30:50.406 - 00:31:33.434, Speaker A: It was a really good breakdown of the different approach between Arbitram and optimism. He actually used the analogy of amusement parks, and a part of this hinges on licensing. But basically there are two models of amusement park. One would be a Six Flag model or Disney, where you pay a lot to get in once, but then everything inside is free. And then there are other models where it's free entrance, but you have to pay for every single thing, like Coney Island. And so Arbitrum would be approaching something that's like the first model where you have to pay a licensing fee, but then you can kind of create your own L Two, and you can use the open source code. That's how they're getting value accrual, by the way.
00:31:33.434 - 00:32:18.790, Speaker A: You can still do an L Three that settles through orbit and that would be completely free. But if you want to do an L Two, like what Base did with the Op stack, you have to pay a licensing fee. And Optimism, on the other hand, has approached the Coney Island sort of measure where, hey, it's free, come on in, use the Op stack. But if you want to ride the law of chains and get 90% of the benefit to being in this distribution or easy integrations or whatever it is, then you have to pay. And they're just very different models. And I guess we'll see, but I sort of feel like there's room for all of these. But what I don't see is a world of like ten general purpose frameworks.
00:32:18.790 - 00:32:34.126, Speaker A: There's probably one or two. There might be a very dominant model, or you could maybe see like three or four frameworks and they have different models and maybe one's a little bit better than the other, but they all sort of work. But that's what I would guess.
00:32:34.308 - 00:33:11.290, Speaker B: Yes, I asked the question, but I don't have an answer. I don't think anybody does. But one way that I think about it is based off of application category. And if you really break it down, it's basically like two variables. It's user experience and technology. Now, user experience is going to be everything from the cost to the end user to where are your assets. So if you're launching an NFT, it probably makes the most sense to have it on ETH mainnet just because that's where the hotball of money at least was for NFTs.
00:33:11.290 - 00:34:00.270, Speaker B: And so I think games are going to have to abstract away the blockchain as much as possible and that's really the user experience is going to have to be abstracted and therefore technology becomes kind of the driving point. How many users, how many concurrent players, how much throughput can you put through a chain is kind of the variable that at least when we talk to games that's what they care about. DeFi or financial services on the flip side is going to be something that cares more about where is the money and how do we protect it. And so security becomes the core variable as well as user experience because if you're building a DeFi app you want to go where people already are transacting. So I kind of think about it in terms of application categories but I agree it's going to be multiple places.
00:34:00.290 - 00:34:51.340, Speaker C: Totally fair the distribution piece plays into the strategy, right. And the relative trade offs. I couldn't agree more. I am interested to hear to see where some use cases that we don't see that aren't I guess as mature today like payments. Does Visa end up needing its own roll up? If so, I would imagine yes or maybe its own chain. Right and I think it is interesting to kind of look at maybe base versus Noble which is the USDC powered chain over in Cosmos and the decisions there. I mean base is basically a general purpose as possible and permissionless which allows coinbase to kind of overlay trusted services that you can charge for.
00:34:51.340 - 00:35:23.902, Speaker C: Whereas Noble wanted that control at the chain level and wanted to control basically maximize control, right. They can't have USDC being minted and sent to blacklisted addresses and things like that, right. So I can see kind of from an enterprise standpoint like two sort of approaches there as well. I'm not sure where they'll play out but I want to say that most will care about control more so than trying to overlay a trusted product on a permissionless network.
00:35:23.966 - 00:35:41.414, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's kind of how I think about technology or the variable of technology. It really comes down to what is the transaction throughput and what is the security and like within know, you can basically know whether or not you need your own role app, whether or not your general purpose roll app or ever or if you need your own chain.
00:35:41.462 - 00:36:07.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. And it'll be interesting to see as know Ben Jones talked about this a permissionless this year. But the bet on more homogeneous block space that like an op law of chains bundle is making. Versus the cosmos. Completely sovereign app chain. And frankly, we're all just guessing. A lot of people would come down with a very strong opinion, like, this is what blockchains need.
00:36:07.700 - 00:36:12.990, Speaker A: We got to wait for the apps to see what they actually need. I think it's a lot of guesswork.
00:36:13.070 - 00:37:08.086, Speaker B: And the same thing happened. Also, the reason why I asked the question is because I don't know how I got down this rabbit hole, but I was looking at ServiceNow who went public in March of 2012. They went public by the way, with 119,000,000 in revenue in their last twelve months and then are now $111,000,000,000 company. And really the thought process there yeah, staggering over the last decade. Wow, go look at their stock chart. It's pretty fun. The threadline here is back then a lot of what the narrative was was essentially is SaaS real for all businesses or is it real for some businesses and would you ever get rid of your It department? Would you ever get rid of your mainframe computers? Would you ever become cloud dominant and be based in the cloud? And I think obviously we know how that story plays, but that's kind of the same question here.
00:37:08.086 - 00:37:22.630, Speaker B: It's like, what is the infrastructure servicing going to need to be for these different applications over the next 510 years? We don't know, but it's going to come in different flavors and maybe you do need that full It department in the mainframe, in the basement.
00:37:22.710 - 00:37:58.180, Speaker A: Reason why I found this announcement from Conduit interesting. I can't even remember. It was an Invest like the best podcast. I heard it a while ago, but they were describing the competitive dynamics within tech. And the quote that I'm paraphrasing was sometimes the biggest competition is not actually horizontally competing across categories, but it's within the same stack competing for margin. And I think that you're starting to see that play out with the framework roll up as a service and shared sequencer. And the roll up as a service is interesting.
00:37:58.180 - 00:38:35.450, Speaker A: I think it's anyone's game at this point, but the strategy, I would guess from Conduit's point of view with absolutely no insight really, other than what I just podcasts and stuff I've listened to, is you use infrastructure services as a little bit of a loss leader. Get your foot in the door. Now you have something that looks like a more robust I bet the internal sales pitch for this leader election mechanism is increase your uptime. Right? That's probably a killer pain point metric for these roll ups. And then it's like, hey, well, we're already running this thing for you. I mean, we should really just share the sequence here. And by the way, we have viewpoints into all these different mem pools.
00:38:35.450 - 00:38:53.714, Speaker A: We know how to extract mev better. We have like best in class because we have views into all these different mem pools. So we'll charge you 15%, but with how much more efficiently we can extract it. You'll see a return anyway, something like that. I mean, that's what I would guess would be the playbook from their perspective.
00:38:53.842 - 00:39:26.702, Speaker C: I guess maybe just two reactions. Like one, I totally agree with that, and maybe another web two playbook has always been commoditize your compliment. Right. And that's typically when you're in the same stack. And I think that's part of the motivation for why I've been looking at this. It's super fun to think about these competitive dynamics and I guess yeah, I think we'll see increased competition just over the next year or two. There's no chance we're not going to, I think.
00:39:26.756 - 00:39:57.786, Speaker A: Guys, I want to talk about pudgy penguins. I have been pudgy pill. I was pudgy pilled a while ago. We did a spaces with Lucanettes, David Hoffman and I, and I got back, I haven't interacted with the NFT side of the market is a little bit of a blind spot for me. There was an article that went live saying NFT projects 95% are worthless, which probably means this is the time to start looking at NFTs again. Super reliable indicator, but it did seem like a lot of definitely it was the frothiest part of this market cycle. Right.
00:39:57.786 - 00:40:46.250, Speaker A: So there's a lot of kind of get rich quick or taking money and then not really executing on a plan. But the pudgy plan has been very interesting because a little while ago you took an NFT product and they actually started selling penguin little penguins online and they sold, I don't actually know the number, I don't know if it was originally 500,000 or they sold a good amount of these penguins online. And then this week you come to find out that 2000 Walmarts are now going to be stocked with pudgy penguins. And the model that is emerging, that makes a lot more sense to me than decentralized Disney, which never made any sense to me, is it's just a traditional funnel, right? So what you have is social media at the top. Lucas talked about this. There's a great Empire episode, jason interviewed him. But there's social media at the top.
00:40:46.250 - 00:41:16.360, Speaker A: There's medium term, which is kind of like what they sell through wholesale through Amazon or Walmart. And then at the bottom of their funnel is the NFT. And part of the value accrual actually, is royalties. There are royalties every time a pudgy penguin gets sold in the Walmart that get directed back to the NFTs at the bottom of the mean. That's a pretty simple I can grok that. That makes a lot of sense to me. So pretty cool.
00:41:17.050 - 00:41:37.866, Speaker B: It's really great to see Walmart register as a licensed security exchange as well. Sorry, I had to add it. Ultimately it's awesome. I think it's the realization. One of the biggest things that we've thought about, I've thought about even back to the company that Vance and I.
00:41:37.888 - 00:41:38.460, Speaker A: Started.
00:41:40.190 - 00:42:08.340, Speaker B: Prior to framework, was a company called Hashleets, and it was digital collectibles for professional athletes. And one of the things that we really stressed and Built product around was how Do You Bridge the digital analog Divide? Like, how do you make this real? And it's a really hard thing to do from a product perspective. It's like this thing's on your phone. It Feels real because you're always looking at your phone. But sports is in person. Athletes are in. Like, how do you connect? That is a really hard thing to do.
00:42:08.340 - 00:42:35.066, Speaker B: And I think the brands, the NFT brands that Are able To Do that best are going to be obviously the most successful. But I think that's really kind of where look at Disney you Just referenced. You know, a major part Of Their business is theme Parks. Everybody remembers the time that they went to Disneyland or Disney World, but it materializes, something that lives on a screen. So it's Very exciting to see them.
00:42:35.088 - 00:42:53.506, Speaker C: Do, like, probably the most lucid commercial strategy I've seen from A fun first, I would say culture first NFT Project. I think the other way to connect us to the real world is like what blackbird's doing, which is also super interesting on the loyalty side and giving you real world benefits.
00:42:53.608 - 00:42:55.686, Speaker A: But just define what blackbird is by.
00:42:55.708 - 00:43:22.902, Speaker C: No means an expert on the blackbird product, but it's essentially letting restaurants either crowdfund some bootstrapping funding to get their restaurant off the ground. I think that's, like, one use case. The other is more like the original use case was for loyalty points. And so you walk into the restaurant. You just put up your phone. It scans. It sees that you've basically come into this restaurant.
00:43:22.902 - 00:44:03.830, Speaker C: It Gives you that attribute on an NFT that represents basically Your Profile. And then you can start getting you get a free dessert every other time you go or something like that, right? So it's just starting to get into, I guess, real world business cases and an interesting commercial business, potentially. This is like the Resi founder. This is his new project. So, you know, this guy has a very good understanding of the landscape, but this One's Super interesting Too. I Mean, I definitely had written off Pudgy Penguins for A while before Mike started telling me how actually Interesting the strategy is. And who knows? Maybe in five years we saw a Legos movie.
00:44:03.830 - 00:44:07.450, Speaker C: We got a Pudgy penguins movie. It's like the despicable.
00:44:07.790 - 00:44:12.438, Speaker B: Yeah, well, that's going the opposite direction. That's analog to digital.
00:44:12.534 - 00:44:28.078, Speaker A: You know, what Pudgy Does is I don't know if you guys know Howard Lindsen, but he has this eight and 80 rule where when you're explaining an investment, you should be Able To do It to an eight year old and to an 80 year old. This passed that test with flying colors is penguins. Everybody loves penguins.
00:44:28.174 - 00:44:32.626, Speaker B: I don't know how many of our investment theses would pass that test in the last couple of years.
00:44:32.808 - 00:44:49.426, Speaker A: So shared sequencing. Grandma, you're going to love it. Hold on. Yeah, it's just cool. It's a little bit of a feel good. It's minor wins, green shoots. And NFTs is a category, obviously not financial advice.
00:44:49.426 - 00:45:33.442, Speaker A: None of this ever is. But yeah, whenever there's a magazine cover that makes the rounds that says this thing is dead, that's usually the time to start looking at it again. Magazine cover indicator. Very tested, tried and true. Let's talk a little bit about Gary Gensler. So there was a Gensler hearing. There were 40 plus crypto founders in DC talking with Congress with the general sentiment being there's been pretty egregious overreach from the SEC, and Gensler himself was sort of deposed by this I don't know what you would call it, like this group of policymakers.
00:45:33.442 - 00:45:52.266, Speaker A: And obviously the Dems tend to be a little bit more friendly to the Gensler SEC administration, and some of the Republicans are a little bit less friendly. There was a really great what Michael was alluding to before. Is there's a really great question about whether or not a Pokemon is a security card or is a Pokemon card? Pokemon card.
00:45:52.288 - 00:45:53.162, Speaker B: Pokemon card.
00:45:53.296 - 00:45:53.882, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:54.016 - 00:46:08.370, Speaker B: Because part of that know, if I buy a Pokemon card, is that a security? Next question. If I buy a tokenized Pokemon, is that a security? Wasn't able to answer that, which is really interesting.
00:46:08.520 - 00:46:50.602, Speaker A: Yeah, the NFT, if I'm being totally honest, crypto does, especially front ends and exchanges and stablecoins and things like that, that does need regulation. And I'm usually on the side of like, yeah, I want to encourage innovation, but some amount of regulation here clearly makes sense. With NFTs, I'm scratching my head being I really feel like they're flexing the definition of what a security is. It's tough for me to there are some that should just be prosecuted as fraud, but calling an NFT a security doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Any other takeaways from the Gensler hearing?
00:46:50.666 - 00:47:32.222, Speaker B: I honestly just think it's the exact same story of every other time he's gone in front of Congress. He has the same points. The people who ask the same questions or people who ask questions ask the same questions. Nobody gets anywhere. Yeah, it does feel kind of like we're at just an impasse and there's not really anything that can change at this point other than regulation. And lo and behold, the people who are asking the questions have a couple of proposed bills that would change a lot of the rules around how this process would work. Obviously very supportive of that.
00:47:32.222 - 00:48:16.730, Speaker B: I agree. I think we're pro regulation, but we're pro the right regulation, and I think there's a huge difference there. There definitely needs to be some controls and some things to change, or people just entrepreneurs need to be able to know what to know. When we talk with companies that are based in the US. It's like, what do we do? And we don't have any perspectives because nobody knows. So I think that part is tough, but yeah, the other thing that I'll say is, and this is not obviously from the hearing itself, but seems to be like there's a lot of movement from the SEC on the ETF front. They've kind of processed a lot of paperwork.
00:48:16.730 - 00:48:51.842, Speaker B: They've delayed some decisions, which sounds like the spot bitcoin ETF is going to at least get delayed until January, probably March at this point. But it looks like they're processing a lot of the ETH futures or combined ETH BTC futures ETFs. Maybe this is in lieu of ahead of a potential government shutdown, which could happen in the next 48 hours. But I think it is interesting to see kind of all of this perspective happening on the front in the hearing and then in the background, there's a lot of movement.
00:48:51.906 - 00:49:15.420, Speaker A: I'm just looking at Eric Balkunas, who's for all intents and purposes these days, the crypto ETF Czar. And it looks like to your point, Michael, they're trying to accelerate the decision on this before a potential government shutdown. And what I'm looking at here from Eric is that the ETH futures ETF could be trading as early as.
00:49:17.570 - 00:49:18.174, Speaker B: Crazy.
00:49:18.292 - 00:49:26.980, Speaker A: Crazy. Yeah. I mean, who knows whether or not we get that. We were talking about this a little bit offline, but the question is, is this a good thing? Should we be excited about this?
00:49:27.510 - 00:49:35.250, Speaker B: If you go and find the day that bitcoin futures ETF launched, it nearly top ticked the market.
00:49:35.320 - 00:50:12.714, Speaker A: I actually remember so love the folks at CME. They do a really good job in the space. And I do remember, I can't remember there's bitcoin futures and they were launching something else. This was in 2021, there was another big product launch and we were joking on a call with them. We're like, all right, guys, we're not going to repeat what happened last time, right? Yeah. I'm not really an expert on the dynamics of futures ETFs and what that does to spot. I think that there is a school of thought around there that that's not necessarily bullish for the spot price action.
00:50:12.714 - 00:50:43.722, Speaker A: And it's kind of a combination of a carry trade that people can run where they short futures and long spot. It also just, in a sense, increases the supply. It's more paper claims, it's more ways to speculate on an asset and it's easier to go short. So there are lots of people that are on the other side of that and would take the opposite. I'm not an expert on this. There is a group of people out there who think like that. I think empirically, if you looked at the launches of these products in the past in crypto, it has not been excellent for spot price action, but I think it's good over long time.
00:50:43.776 - 00:51:26.530, Speaker C: It would be no, I'm just saying, regardless of just from an adoption or like a volume standpoint, it would be interesting to see how it ends up comparing to bitcoin, because I feel like today or their equivalent bitcoin. Product? Because I feel like that is just a signal of potentially how much more attention Ethereum has from that investor class than it did basically before the last cycle. So yeah, again, I'm also not an expert on these ETH futures dynamics. I don't know what that will do to price action or if it will have any impact. But it will be interesting to see just like, how many people are now looking at Ethereum on par with Bitcoin in terms of its importance.
00:51:26.690 - 00:51:36.890, Speaker A: What would that data tell you? I'm just like scratching my head. Who right now is trading an ETH futures ETF? I'm just like scratching my head.
00:51:37.040 - 00:51:49.934, Speaker B: I don't think it's trading. I will tell you exactly who it is. It is literally my uncle who for the last two years has been asking me when he can buy ETH in his 401K.
00:51:49.972 - 00:51:51.760, Speaker A: It's actually Yano's uncle too.
00:51:52.770 - 00:51:53.718, Speaker B: There's always an uncle.
00:51:53.754 - 00:51:56.914, Speaker A: Miles got a great parental crypto text.
00:51:57.112 - 00:52:07.060, Speaker C: No, it's incredible. It's like, holy shit, have you heard about this thing? WorldCoin. This is going to change the world. Yes, I have.
00:52:07.850 - 00:52:08.454, Speaker A: You too.
00:52:08.492 - 00:52:09.874, Speaker B: Can stand your eyeballs.
00:52:10.002 - 00:52:15.382, Speaker A: Yeah. Celestia got a shout out in there like the first modular blockchain coming live.
00:52:15.516 - 00:52:18.280, Speaker C: I'm proud of you. But I'll say yes.
00:52:18.990 - 00:52:46.110, Speaker B: Knowledgeable mom proud moment. I could see both sides of the argument for this ETH futures ETF. I mean, obviously the carry trade is painstakingly simple. You buy Spot, you stake it, you make 3% and then you short the price risk with the futures. Pretty easy. So does require you to buy Spot, which there's that. But I think that would obviously be the negative, the positive.
00:52:46.110 - 00:53:30.446, Speaker B: I mean, sure, more attention, same level as Bitcoin, just more potential for our uncles to buy. The other one that I find kind of interesting is what does this do to the SEC's ambivalence around whether or not ETH is a security? Does this totally negate it? Does this basically say they're now looking at ETH as a non security? That's kind of one of my questions around and I'm obviously not a securities lawyer, but does this sort of implicitly say that they have come to the realization that it's not? So I think that could be kind of an interesting moment in time as well.
00:53:30.548 - 00:53:50.280, Speaker A: It's really hard. I have no idea. For so long I've just been operating on the assumption that it's not. And now they're questioning it again. It feels to me like they're trying to move the goalposts so far that we're like, whoa, whoa, and definitely not ETH is not a security. But I have no idea. I'm really just talking way I have no idea how these games are.
00:53:50.280 - 00:54:35.362, Speaker A: One one topic that I wanted to get your guys take on was we've got the Celestia or the Tia AirDrop that got announced this week and we talked about it a little bit on this show. But obviously Celestia a project with a lot of great people, a lot of hype around it definitely targeting, I would say a pain point within sort of blockchain set of duties. Right. Data availability I think is going to become a much hotter topic and that's what they're optimized for. So, some details around the AirDrop. The total supply of the AirDrop is 1 billion. Tia at Genesis, it's 8% inflation for the first year, decreasing 10% per year until reaching an inflation floor of 1.5%
00:54:35.362 - 00:54:50.194, Speaker A: annually. The public allocation is 20%. So the testnet is 7.4%. Futures initiative oh, wait, no, this is the whole yeah, sorry. This is the entire breakdown. So the public allocation is 20%. The futures initiative is 12.6
00:54:50.194 - 00:55:00.362, Speaker A: R and D and ecosystem is 26.8 early backers, 19.7 early backers seed. Okay. So actually a combined of about 35. 35%.
00:55:00.496 - 00:55:02.358, Speaker B: I was going to say. They definitely sold more than that.
00:55:02.384 - 00:55:37.750, Speaker A: Yeah, about 35%. And the initial core contributors to the team, 17.6%. I guess it's interesting. I think this has the potential to be a pretty big event. Vance would say it's recapitalizing the Dgens in a sense. I also think it's a very useful a lot of the ETH roll up ecosystem does depend on getting cheaper DA costs. So yeah, I don't know what your guys thoughts are.
00:55:37.820 - 00:56:07.422, Speaker C: One like if you just look at the AirDrop distribution, I think it reflects Celestia's at least how they're thinking about their strategic positioning. Right. They want to be completely ecosystem agnostic. They want to appeal to roll up developers and basically make the market feel like you could be ethereum aligned if you use ETH for settlement. But Celestia for DA still. Right. At the same time, they are a tendermint cosmos chain.
00:56:07.422 - 00:57:01.502, Speaker C: They are cosmos in the sense that they have one single purpose to their chain and they're specializing to do that as well as possible. And of course, they're IBC enabled. So you can see why you'd have stakers and IBC relayers in that included in there. I guess the other thing I would say is it will be interesting because unlike optimism or Arbitrum, some of the other big launches, there's no degen way to farm this asset and there's going to be a lot less noise around what's considered like real traction versus, I would say speculative traction. Right. Because the only way these fundamentals are going to improve for Celestia is if roll ups use them for and like that's a high switching. That's that's quite a commitment.
00:57:01.502 - 00:57:32.334, Speaker C: Right? And so it's great. I'm really excited because we'll be able to it's always nice when there's less noise around. Actually, fundamentally, what's happening here is it gaining traction and usage and yeah, I don't know where it's going to trade. I can tell you that it will trade on Osmosis at launch. And that's a lot of because of the IBC connection, which is great. But yeah, I think those are a couple quick takeaways. We'll see how much traction it gets.
00:57:32.372 - 00:57:53.842, Speaker B: We can finally start to the the you know, one of the things I've been looking forward to, honestly for years now is everybody can pontificate on Twitter and have their own philosophical arguments, but ultimately comes down to traction and numbers. And so, frankly, I'm just excited to.
00:57:53.896 - 00:58:09.494, Speaker C: See what those numbers me too. All these roll up frameworks. We've been talking about shared sequencers, we've been talking about alt DA solutions, and we're actually going to go live pretty soon, for the most part, Eigen layer as well. And we'll start to see what's real.
00:58:09.532 - 00:58:10.120, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:58:11.290 - 00:58:18.230, Speaker C: We got a little bit too hyped up about and ultimately it's like the developers will kind of answer that, right, with their choices.
00:58:18.310 - 00:58:33.774, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm pumped for that team. I hope it ends up working. I would be a proponent. Overall, reducing cost for apps, I think is the thing that we should be optimizing for. So power to him. Power to him.
00:58:33.812 - 00:58:57.522, Speaker B: Exactly. The infrastructure build out has been nothing but impressive over the last few years. And I mean, once again, as we were talking about, you could have this flavor, you could have that flavor, you can do kind of mix and match whatever you want. But choice is ultimately what I think will drive a lot of optionality for developers and it's just going to build a diversity of different types of applications.
00:58:57.586 - 00:59:52.086, Speaker A: It's wickedly difficult. It's just so tough. I mean, in some cases. I was talking to a friend of mine on one of these share sequencer teams recently, and we were having actually the exact same debate, Michael, that you posed, which is like, how many roll ups are there going to be? And I think it matters an enormous amount and it's kind of this unknowable thing, right? Because I guess in the situation, again, if I was just sitting from the perspective of a shared sequencer, if there are a couple big roll ups, probably actually, then it does make sense to decentralize and have a set of shared sequencers. Right? Because there's enough economy sort of built on that, that you do want to increase the moneyness of that asset and it's an additional layer of security and all this stuff. But if there's 1000 individual chains with a moderate amount of economic activity, I don't think you need to have a decentralized sequencer on all those. And how could you possibly we're all just sitting here guessing.
00:59:52.086 - 01:00:10.570, Speaker A: So we're all like, all right, baby, this infrastructure is getting built out. But man, if you are in building out one of these sets of infrastructure, it's just tough. My heart goes out to you. It's brutal, it's very competitive, and it's hard to know it's just hard to know how this stuff's going to play out logically.
01:00:10.650 - 01:00:13.374, Speaker B: But it can be highly lucrative if it works out.
01:00:13.412 - 01:00:15.374, Speaker A: Yeah, baby, yeah.
01:00:15.412 - 01:00:37.990, Speaker C: You need to have a plan B, I think if you're one of these players. Like, okay, things go this way, this is how we're positioning. But if we turn out to be wrong, we can't be dead right? We need to be able to pivot quickly. And I think that that's what folks are thinking about right now. When it's now a little bit the App chain thesis has kind of come back down to Earth a little bit.
01:00:38.060 - 01:01:32.118, Speaker B: Just a side question there, Miles. Do you think that there's now? I mean, one of the conversations that we would have in 2019 and 2020 was what blockchain do we build on? And then it was, okay, well, what infrastructure should we be using? And the level of platform risk that you took on in making that choice was gargantuan. Now, I don't find that it's that high or it's not as big as it once was, and I don't think it ever goes away. If you build on their own operating system, you're just not going to be able to access a certain amount of people. But I'm old enough to remember when Mac didn't have all the fun games, whereas Windows did. And I do think that the Emulators of the world are going to come together and make it really simple and simplified so you don't have that same platform risk. But where are we? Curve.
01:01:32.294 - 01:02:07.240, Speaker C: It's kind of similar that saying you won't get fired for picking XYZ, you won't get fired for going with an EVM single threaded roll up. Right. The timing of at the same time, no one's arguing that there aren't huge downsides to Solidity and the EVM, I think we saw that with Curve. Right. There are more secure languages, there are more performative languages, and VMs, the timing of when that lindy kind of tips, I just can't say for sure. I don't know. I've been wrong in the past.
01:02:07.240 - 01:02:15.734, Speaker C: I wouldn't have thought that EVMs are still the dominant, dominant option by now, if you ask me, two years ago.
01:02:15.852 - 01:02:25.770, Speaker B: Yeah, two, three, four years ago, it was like, oh, we've got some big up and coming blockchains that are launching that are going to steal the show.
01:02:25.840 - 01:02:58.582, Speaker C: Exactly. But I will say the switching costs are a little or like the platform risk is a little bit lower because let's say you're picking a couple different components. You can switch out the DA, you can switch out the settlement, you can switch out the VM pretty easily. Right? So, yeah, I think it'll be interesting to see if this Op super chain all makes decisions together, when are they going to feel good enough to go say, like, all right, now we can do ZK or now we can do Move or whatever sort of VM. Yeah, we'll see.
01:02:58.636 - 01:03:37.758, Speaker A: It's tough. I remember listening to Antonio talk about this years ago. Antonio Giuliano of dYdX, who I've always thought is a very long term, pretty visionary founder. And he's like, I think people overplay the role of distribution when you're picking an ecosystem. And it really should be what does the ecosystem actually allow you to do from a product standpoint? And I'm with him in the long term, but man, it would suck to get the timing wrong on that. I really think that you're seeing that distribution matters quite a bit. And the reality is the most valuable customers for on chain products are in the ETH ecosystem.
01:03:37.758 - 01:04:09.910, Speaker A: And you see that with the early traction that the roll ups are getting. It's just true. And this is the classic saying, it's like first time founders think about products, second time founders think about distribution. It's like classic mistake that everyone makes. And I don't know another flipping that happened this week was base just flipped solana in TBL. And I say that as a supporter know solana. But you can you can watch the roll up thesis playing out in real time and it's distribution.
01:04:09.910 - 01:04:14.238, Speaker A: And I think it was still right to focus on that for the time being.
01:04:14.324 - 01:04:15.454, Speaker B: Totally agree friend.
01:04:15.492 - 01:04:29.370, Speaker A: Text great doesn't mean that'll be that way forever. But I think for now that was the right decision. But anyway all right guys, this was a fun one. I think we can wrap it here's.
