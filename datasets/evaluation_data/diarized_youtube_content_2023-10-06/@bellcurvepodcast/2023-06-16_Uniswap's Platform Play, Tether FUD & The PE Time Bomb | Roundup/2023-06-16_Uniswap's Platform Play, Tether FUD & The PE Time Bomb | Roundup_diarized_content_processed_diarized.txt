00:00:05.530 - 00:00:12.240, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two, vance and miles. Welcome, guys.
00:00:13.090 - 00:00:14.800, Speaker B: Thank you. What's up?
00:00:15.250 - 00:00:18.846, Speaker C: Miles is turning into a really solid rotation player here.
00:00:18.948 - 00:00:25.382, Speaker D: Yeah, I know I said I was six, man, but, you know, I'm kind of working my way into the rotation here.
00:00:25.436 - 00:00:27.938, Speaker A: Might be an upgrade here. Might be an upgrade.
00:00:28.114 - 00:00:30.438, Speaker B: Where's Yano? Just vacation or what's? Good.
00:00:30.524 - 00:00:43.770, Speaker A: No Blockworks had a charity Wiffleball game today, so Yano's holding down the port at the Whiffle. How come you didn't get the invite, Mike? These old bones don't play Wiffleball anymore.
00:00:44.190 - 00:00:48.650, Speaker D: They don't just imagine, like, a clipboard.
00:00:49.390 - 00:00:51.934, Speaker A: Like a Third Beach Coast, like, smacking people on the ass.
00:00:51.972 - 00:00:55.630, Speaker D: They run by we got to call the bullpen. This isn't working out.
00:00:55.780 - 00:00:58.030, Speaker B: Who's more athletic, you or Yano?
00:00:58.770 - 00:01:08.862, Speaker A: It's low bar. I cross both of would say Yano would say he is, but of course, I think the record would disagree.
00:01:08.926 - 00:01:10.002, Speaker B: You're the bigger man.
00:01:10.136 - 00:01:42.294, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I take the high road. Exactly. All right, we got a whole bunch of different things to talk about this week. Why don't we just jump right in here and talk about Uniswap V Four? So V Four is kind of the longer waited upgrade or new contract that's going to be deployed, and Hayden gave us a preview of it this week. The caveat is that in past times when there's been a new version of Uniswap launch, sort of there's a preview, but then at that point, the code base is already out there and it's been audited and it's sort of finalized. Hayden was very careful to say, this is a very preliminary version.
00:01:42.294 - 00:02:19.042, Speaker A: We want to be able to take on feedback from the community, and it's going to be a little while before V Four actually gets deployed. But there were basically a whole bunch of new features that V Four introduced. The main one that sort of got a lot of attention is the introduction of hooks. Hooks are sort of these customizable contracts that enable highly customizable pools and new functionality. So a list of things that are now possible with hooks dynamic fees, limit orders, TWAP orders, mev, internalization, all sorts of different things. Pools are moving away. We're moving away from the factory model on V Three to a singleton contract.
00:02:19.042 - 00:02:40.240, Speaker A: So basically, all these pools are going to be on one large contract, and that's going to save on gas costs, especially for, I think, the deployment of new pools. Hayden said it could be as much as 99%, some enormous amount cheaper. That's largely it. I mean, I'd be very curious. What do you guys think broadly about V Four?
00:02:42.210 - 00:03:34.990, Speaker D: I can jump in here. I guess my takeaways, I had a couple of big ones. So first, I think on just the framing of this upgrade and how it differs from the other ones that you mentioned, I think Uniswap has done a really good job over its entire lifetime of aligning its brand with that of Ethereum. So when people think of Ethereum, they also think of Uniswap. And one thing Ethereum does obviously know, they build in public, they put out ideas on a forum, there's period of discussion and then the upgrade happens. And of course it's not token weighted voting to make that upgrade happen, it's social consensus. I think that's kind of the direction or at least the sort of message that Uniswap wants to put out with this in terms of building in public and not just flipping the switch.
00:03:34.990 - 00:04:43.030, Speaker D: So I guess that's number one. Number two is just the capabilities that hooks enable. I think this makes the decks in general way more programmable and a lot of the things that we've seen and I've been close to in Cosmos is because you can build a lot of these capabilities into the chain. So something to say logic after every swap that is potentially for mev purposes or checking an oracle and I think they found ways to build this into the smart contract level, which is really smart. And I'd say the last takeaway I had is just the general strategy. Uniswap has been kind of in between both a user facing trading tool and sort of a platform for other apps to build upon. And I think this takes them one step closer in that latter direction, the way that balancer has always tried to frame itself, right? It wants a network of independent dependents building on top.
00:04:43.030 - 00:05:48.614, Speaker D: And I think the goal of this is so that the next team that comes along thinking that they can build a better decks instead of starting from scratch and building a competitor, they'll just take the ideas and the tooling that's know, put out there by Uniswap. Tap into the liquidity, tap into the existing brand and user. Hopefully, you know, if Uniswap is successful in their eyes, they'll know all these would be competitors now building on top of the Uniswap protocol. And so I think that it's a really strong strategy. They can retain flexibility to build user facing tools with the wallet and the mobile app and kind of let the protocol be a little bit more, I would say Unbiased or a little bit more open for development. I think we were talking about it a little bit earlier. I don't see this as a move towards a Uni chain but you could take a version of Uniswap and build all these hooks, fancy bells and whistles in and then launch a UniChain.
00:05:48.614 - 00:06:03.280, Speaker D: But I think this kind of allows them to get a lot of those benefits without having to make such a dramatic move and really helps them accelerate development because all these other teams, you kind of outsource it to the market to really experiment with these things.
00:06:03.670 - 00:06:05.460, Speaker B: Can you explain what a hook is?
00:06:05.830 - 00:06:54.638, Speaker D: Yeah, I think a hook is basically after every single transaction you have some sort of if then logic. And so Osmosis uses hooks for a tool or a module that helps it internalize mev. And this hook basically, after every single swap, checks for possible arbitrage opportunities that were created by it. So which potential imbalances in the pool? And then at the end of the block on Osmosis, it says, okay, we checked for ARBs after every single swap. Here's the one that we think is most profitable. We're going to flash mint ourselves Osmo, capture the ARB and then pay back the Flash loan. And so you could do something like that with using hooks on Ethereum or with Uniswap.
00:06:54.638 - 00:07:04.370, Speaker D: But that's general ideas. You're basically building a way to add logic after every swap or in between a block.
00:07:05.590 - 00:07:52.370, Speaker C: One way of at least I kind of read through it and thought about it was in the nice case, a limit order is probably a good example of how a hook would work. Some price on some AMM gets below some threshold or above some threshold and there's some trigger with a hook that says, okay, sell or buy that asset or swap that asset. In the bad case, it enables an entire attack vector that doesn't exist in Uniswap currently. And I generally agree with everything you said, Miles, and I think that this is a great step forward. I agree. It's also moving more in the direction of the Ethereum open source development process, which is really positive development for a protocol, in my opinion. I do think that historically what we've seen with Uniswap is it's really simple to use.
00:07:52.370 - 00:09:05.980, Speaker C: It's an AMM, it's a constant function. You know what the price is going to be and you swap and that's V one, V two, V three added a pretty significant amount of complexity. More so on the liquidity provider side, it added a lot of user benefits with different price points, different functions. There was just a net benefit to users, I would say at frankly, kind of a cost of LPs because it didn't make it as easy to LP as it was on the first couple of versions. And I see this as a further level of complexity that is added to an otherwise thought of very simple protocol and very easy to use interface that if used in a malicious way and frankly for unknown users could be troublesome, could be potentially disastrous. If hooks are like I definitely agree that you can have sort of an MAV bot that stands for opportunities and kind of ARBs them away. It could also be the opposite where it's a malicious mev attacker using hooks, where you've got these different vaults with different hooks in them.
00:09:05.980 - 00:09:39.480, Speaker C: I'm just kind of thinking here out loud, but it will be very hard to distinguish between for an end user, what is just like a normal pool without any real complications versus something that could have a bunch of hooks in there that you just don't even know about. And get steamrolled or run over without really inspecting the code or inspecting what's happening behind the scenes. It's going to be interesting to see what the user experience looks like from a user perspective, to see how they want to transact in what pools because I think that that's going to be a pretty huge divergence from just what most people think of Uniswap today.
00:09:40.330 - 00:09:42.920, Speaker B: Will the Meme coin still launch on V two?
00:09:44.410 - 00:09:45.160, Speaker D: Probably.
00:09:47.290 - 00:10:27.140, Speaker A: That's another sort of interesting. So I want to dive in, Michael, to what you just said there as well. But in hearing Hayden talk about this, I thought one thing that he emphasized that at least I found interesting, and you can see it in the construction of the singleton contract is there's a lot of focus from the uniswap team in terms of gas optimization and that's definitely well and good. But what it implies to me is that uniswap for at least the foreseeable future, sees the majority of trading happening on. And you know, a lot of the narrative that you hear is that a lot of activity is going to move up to layer two. So there's a little bit of a divergence there and maybe we could speculate, do you agree with that sort of observation? And maybe we could speculate a little bit as to why that is.
00:10:28.170 - 00:11:21.554, Speaker B: I think it will continue to exist on main chain, all the crypto native stuff. The hottest money right now is ETH, that recently staked and is now LSTs, and we've talked about this before, but they're the most willing to try shit and trade stuff and they're always going to be on ETH main net like Bridging. That stuff doesn't really make sense functionally, honestly. I've had a few conversations this week that A, these are companies pitching us or just like talking to different institutional investors. There's a lot of real world assets that are coming to ETH Mainnet that they're never going to launch on Polygon, they're never going to launch on the L two S. They don't care about the gas fees, they want the nuclear grade security of ETH L one. And it really is a pretty optimistic path forward for ETH is just like these are the people who are willing to pay the highest gas fees and put the most sensitive assets on chain.
00:11:21.554 - 00:11:52.474, Speaker B: And at least that's what I think is the hopeful future of Ethereum is it does become this settlement layer, value layer where all of these real world assets come and just hang and just never leave. So I do think that the foreseeable future will be ETH mainnet and on the kind of more nihilistic side of the house. It's like Pepe's and all of those things, those are on ETH Main net for a reason. And it's because there's 60, 70 billion of coins on ETH. And until that changes, I don't see trading moving anywhere.
00:11:52.602 - 00:12:23.100, Speaker C: I was going to say the evidence is there. These layer two solutions have been out for, at this point years or close to a year in the same user experience and capabilities that they have today generally. But why haven't the assets moved over? Why haven't they bridged? Why hasn't there been major change or major shift in moving to L Two? S if it is that much less expensive and people want to trade there, it just hasn't happened yet. So what's this suggest? What would be the catalyst to force that to move over?
00:12:24.110 - 00:12:31.130, Speaker B: Invalidation of this thesis would look like the first major Meme Coin launching on an L Two. That would make me think differently.
00:12:32.830 - 00:12:55.274, Speaker C: I would also say real world assets launching on a layer two. Like massive sizable assets launching on a layer two. If you assume that you're going to have both of the assets originate from L One. I agree that there's a ton of assets that are real world in orientation that are coming online in the next couple of years where those originate from. It's not something that has a security model that's not Ethereum.
00:12:55.422 - 00:13:47.266, Speaker D: Yeah, we've talked about this a little bit before, but this concept of like premium block space and that being kind of a huge tailwind for Ethereum. Longer term, I think I agree with you. I don't know, I don't feel as strongly about where the Meme Coins launch, but I can see a future where minting new assets that are high value, right like RWAs as we're talking about never leaves ETH. L One. Huge transfers of assets between institution never leaves L One because it's willing to pay up for those gas prices. But I can totally see let's see if Base is super successful and ends up having as many daily active users as Ethereum l One itself. If I was launching a Meme Coin, that's kind of where I would probably want to go.
00:13:47.266 - 00:13:53.240, Speaker D: I'd just follow the users. But Vance, to your point, what is the catalyst to get the users there?
00:13:53.770 - 00:14:30.002, Speaker B: I'm of two minds on like the first one is know, it's Coinbase branded. It is connected to the obviously you know they're going to have users, whatever other thought process is like once upon a time everyone was really bullish on Coinbase NFT or that NFT marketplace. And it kind of is like this binary thing. It's either going to be huge or it's going to be nothing. And what's the activation energy? What is the catalyst that drives people over to Coinbase base? I'm not exactly sure. Honestly, I couldn't come up with something.
00:14:30.136 - 00:15:03.290, Speaker A: I think it could be users. My original sort of concern about Base was that it might have the perception of something like a corporate chain, which has been pretty negative in the history of crypto. But I've done a little bit of poking around and just asked people, do you hear about people being excited about Base? And maybe it's because the industry wants to rally around Coinbase right now. For, I think, pretty good reasons. But the other thing that Coinbase has that's very attractive is developers want to build things that people are going to use. And that is one thing that Coinbase really has. They've got users.
00:15:03.630 - 00:15:30.130, Speaker C: And what I was going to say is users. Okay, I didn't understand that perspective. Just anything that's real world asset that is going to come from a traditional financial institution needs to have the safeguards and controls in place. If you assume that's out of the box functionality for base, then it could just be the supply of assets. That maybe is the only place where they can mint these things. That obviously is counter to what we were just talking about, but I could see that being an invalidation of the theory.
00:15:31.110 - 00:16:27.158, Speaker A: Do you think it's maybe I'll just throw, like, an idea that I had out, at least? And you guys can tell me that I'm wrong, but I think one of the reasons why some of the big DFI apps that sort of made their name on ETH main chain. Haven't really successfully deployed to some of the layer twos or haven't really tried to invest there is that they're not 100% confident yet in the security. And there are a lot of big questions about what is the sequencer set going to look like and how solid are these things really. And there's the question of if it's issued on ETH main chain and then bridged, or if it's natively issued on the layer two and what is protected from the fork choice rule. So I think if it were me and I was putting myself in uniswap shoes, you got a golden goose. You have an enormous amount of market share on the place where all the liquidity and activity is, even though it's the explicit scaling solution for ETH to move users up to layer twos. I probably wouldn't take that risk right now, to be honest.
00:16:27.244 - 00:16:36.380, Speaker B: I mean, they're on polygon, though, and polygon is getting reorgs pretty much daily. I don't think I really care that much.
00:16:36.990 - 00:16:40.650, Speaker A: It's small though. It's a relatively small amount of volume that happens.
00:16:40.800 - 00:16:42.540, Speaker B: Just a small reorg. Just.
00:16:46.610 - 00:16:47.360, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:49.810 - 00:17:31.014, Speaker B: I would probably take the under on base. If you build it, will they actually come? Why would they go there? There's no liquid staking, there's no big borrow lend markets. You have to bridge assets. It's an uphill battle. I think one of the reasons why or just to break down your argument, it's like, is the chain itself secure enough? I think we have good evidence to suggest that maybe that's not the most important thing to a uni V three deployment. I think the other case of what happens if there's like a bridge, that rugs that's still like the through line of most L two dynamics. To me, it's like we still have not come up with a canonical bridge and those things are pretty sketchy.
00:17:31.014 - 00:17:42.026, Speaker B: If you think about a bridge what they're doing is they're taking your assets in and they're minting you assets that kind of look or feel a little bit like them on the other side. It's not exactly straightforward.
00:17:42.218 - 00:18:18.166, Speaker C: I was going to say, Mike, out of the things you just listed, I'd say the number one holdback that I've thought about or seen and felt myself is lack of native minting. Once you have the ability to natively mint assets on a chain and then it becomes a question of composability and what other available applications and functionality is available in that ecosystem. Liquidity is one of those components, but I do think that it really does come down to native minting of assets. Where do those assets natively exist versus the bridge? I think the bridge is probably the most crucial component and probably the most fearful for anybody who's needing to use a layer.
00:18:18.198 - 00:18:20.198, Speaker A: Two agreed.
00:18:20.294 - 00:19:18.560, Speaker B: Just speaking of where these assets are minted in real world assets, we saw a few pitches over the past few weeks that are wildly ambitious versions of real world assets. Not just minting them on chain, but building out real economies and starting to bootstrap really ethereum as the back end of traditional financial infrastructure rails. And these pitches were not just like three dudes in a garage. It was like very experienced, high level former bank employees backed by global institutions in the trading and finance world with very coherent plans to both put these assets on chain and then increase their circulation and volume and really use it as a normal course of business practice. And we get obviously inspired by DeFi and by games. And it just feels like we're really starting to see those very ambitious true believers that are backed by you guys. Just put out an article that Franklin Templeton is going to use a lot of ETH infrastructure to do these rolled asset things.
00:19:18.560 - 00:19:32.770, Speaker B: It does feel like that's like the panacea that's starting to present itself. And I read a few tweets this week about how 2023 is much worse than 2019. I just could not disagree with that more.
00:19:32.840 - 00:19:35.060, Speaker A: I could not disagree with that more either.
00:19:35.510 - 00:19:47.846, Speaker B: I remember there was a point in 2019 where Michael and I were sitting at that house. We used to live in Culver City, and we were sitting by the pool and we were trying to come up with a use case for crypto. We literally couldn't think of anything.
00:19:48.028 - 00:19:50.962, Speaker C: And I was just like, Other than sports collectibles.
00:19:51.026 - 00:20:26.870, Speaker B: Yeah, other than sports collectible, which the company we were building at the time. But it was just like, is this ever going to work or am I just wasting my time? And people are like, oh, the original values of crypto were much more present in 2019 than they are in 2023. The thing that I was reading in 2019 to get me through the day was like Willie Woo's price predictions of like, we're doing like on chain ta yeah, I was subscribed to that substack. That's what was getting me through at least this bear market. There's real apps, there's real use cases. There's real institutions that care about this stuff. BlackRock just announced that they are filing for an ETF for Bitcoin.
00:20:26.870 - 00:20:31.800, Speaker B: I don't know. I just feel like the current generation is so soft.
00:20:33.530 - 00:20:37.042, Speaker A: I bet no old generation has ever said that about the new generation.
00:20:37.106 - 00:20:42.920, Speaker C: I was about to say, I'm pretty sure your dad told us the exact same thing.
00:20:43.950 - 00:20:55.722, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the other thing. When we started Framework, I was like, hey, dad, I'm starting a crypto hedge fund. He was like, Absolutely fucking not. You're going to business pool, dude.
00:20:55.786 - 00:20:56.366, Speaker C: All right.
00:20:56.468 - 00:21:03.002, Speaker B: There was no, like, chase your dreams. It was like, this industry is a scam. Did you see all of those ICOs? What happened there? Vance?
00:21:03.066 - 00:21:15.860, Speaker A: At least you had a fund in the title there. For the first, like, two years of Blockworks, all we got to say was like, yeah, we host some crypto meetups. Yeah, that was like the first two years. How many people do you think thought that was a great idea?
00:21:16.950 - 00:21:20.062, Speaker B: We went to that OG Chicago blockworks conference.
00:21:20.126 - 00:21:22.740, Speaker A: Yeah. Coin Alts. Yeah.
00:21:23.290 - 00:21:28.440, Speaker B: Did I think I would see Blockworks again? I didn't know at that point, but you guys come a long way.
00:21:29.050 - 00:21:30.620, Speaker C: Man, I forgot about that.
00:21:31.150 - 00:21:56.362, Speaker A: The thing that was painful in 2019, it was like, is any of this stuff going to be real? Everything was very theoretical. And when prices are tanking and everything's theoretical, it's very hard to at least this stuff is like, all right, are the values right? Are we going to figure out a business model? Is the SEC going to outlaw this stuff? Those are much better arguments than, does this even make sense? They're much less existential.
00:21:56.506 - 00:22:04.770, Speaker B: And they did. Jay Clayton was like, remember when Jay Clayton was like, all of these are securities. And everyone was like, all right, pack it up. We're just going to do Bitcoin.
00:22:05.750 - 00:22:16.454, Speaker A: Remember when Jay got out and Gary got in and we were all like, let's go, because he had taught those MIT classes. We got one in gets it, guys.
00:22:16.572 - 00:22:44.702, Speaker C: I remember talking to one of our policy friends, and we were super excited about that exact same transition. Their response was, I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing. True jokes on us, I would say. The other thing, though, just to add on to this, it does feel like there's a lot of negative press and negative sentiment right now, which feels like we're hitting the crescendo at least in the last relative period of time right now. Like this week.
00:22:44.756 - 00:22:45.600, Speaker B: Last week.
00:22:46.310 - 00:23:26.638, Speaker C: But to your point, Mike, this doesn't feel existential. It's not existential. All we have to do now is really just extend the time horizon of our expectations of when this stuff is going to happen. And you assume over maybe a longer period of time that things like the market structure bill are going to come through, that we're going to have an understanding of a playbook for how to do this stuff with a regulated perspective in the United States. All this stuff is going to happen. It's just now maybe going to take a little bit longer but the direction and I do think that we're all going to be on the right side of regulatory history here. This stuff is going to happen and once that happens it's going to be game on and there's not going to be a chance of being at the back of the pack once it happens to be like, okay, now it's time to jump forward and do this.
00:23:26.638 - 00:23:30.830, Speaker C: You kind of have to be in the seat right now to get the first shot when we're ready to go.
00:23:30.980 - 00:23:34.406, Speaker A: Yeah, go mouth.
00:23:34.538 - 00:24:37.986, Speaker D: Yeah, I was just going to say I totally agree with all this and I can feel like that enterprise blockchain and permissioned blockchain the sentiment coming right back in. Yeah, I was having a conversation with a lot of traditional folks who are interested in crypto this week, and it does just become clear to me at different points over the past few years that there's a lot of people that look at this as a way to have an incremental efficiency improvement, basically improve the efficiency of settlement versus the people who are on the ground building, who have the ideas of enabling permissionless, access to financial markets, creating new types of money. Right. And these are very different objectives. I'm not really sure where we land between them but I think that it kind of becomes more like it comes to a head every couple of years in the various part of your resolve.
00:24:38.018 - 00:24:39.622, Speaker C: Gets tested every four years.
00:24:39.756 - 00:25:18.494, Speaker A: Time is a flat circle. I found this in my inbox randomly this week but this is the table of contents from a 2016 report about what Goldman thought blockchain would look like. And this was at the period of time when whenever Goldman Sachs was talking about blockchain, not Bitcoin, it was like a huge deal. And my dad would send it to me and be like, maybe this isn't bullshit, but it's accelerating the sharing economy with reputation management. Building a distributed smart grid with blockchain. Reducing transaction costs in real estate, title, insurance, capital markets, US. Cash, equities repo, leverage loan trading, AML and KYC.
00:25:18.494 - 00:25:51.518, Speaker A: It's just a good reminder of these very I feel like something that happens time and time again during this period of time know when all these prices and all these new ideas some of them get sort of batted down, you fall back on this like, well what are we really doing here? And then this whole real world use case and putting stuff on chain sort of comes back into the vogue and that will probably eventually work. And to be honest maybe you guys got like it sounds like you're hearing some super interesting pitches about real world assets, but it does just remind me of the type of stuff that people used to talk about during the last bear cycle as well.
00:25:51.684 - 00:25:54.270, Speaker C: I think that slower for sure, but.
00:25:54.340 - 00:26:45.760, Speaker B: The good pitches are like you can see that. Okay. And the Goldman list that you just shared of what blockchain is useful for, I think that's actually right. But it's not just like we're going to create this permission blockchain and we're going to put these assets on there and then we're going to crank up the snarks and then it's going to be 100 times better. It's like, no, you need to get everyone to opt in. And it happens gradually, but one person has the assets that they put on chain, you have another person who wants to buy them. Historically, the problem with tokenized securities is, yeah, you can tokenize a bunch of condos in Aspen, but does anybody actually give a shit? Does anybody actually want to buy those? You need to kind of get a lot of people and build it shouldn't be surprising, but the network effects around it and it feels like that is more so what's clearly happening now versus before.
00:26:46.210 - 00:26:51.086, Speaker C: I was going to say it might I think every single thing in that list will eventually happen. It's just a question of when.
00:26:51.268 - 00:26:51.806, Speaker B: Right?
00:26:51.908 - 00:27:19.798, Speaker A: You might be absolutely right. I think the reason one of the not to be snide, but I've always thought one of the problems with real world assets is the people that control the real world assets are all old guys. And it's just very hard to get old guys to get excited about this stuff. They don't have much. Seriously, put yourself in the shoes for a second of someone who's 65 year old, they've run their entire career in TradFi. It's just a much harder sort of sell. And that's why to your point, Vance, it does take a while and it's.
00:27:19.814 - 00:27:24.860, Speaker C: Kind of like science. Science progresses one funeral at a time.
00:27:25.630 - 00:27:29.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just about to say that. That's a great quote. Yeah, I'm with you on that.
00:27:30.030 - 00:27:54.260, Speaker B: Smart people that think about this for enough time generally understand its value prop. And a lot of it is also just generational. There was a great survey put out by Grayscale, whatever you think of them, about the generational dynamics of who holds and likes crypto. The math is on our side. Over time, there's only going to be more of us in positions of power at these big banks. And it might take a while, but it's happening.
00:27:54.870 - 00:28:43.220, Speaker A: Francis Suarez is running for president, he announced today. I don't know if you guys how do we help? Yeah, who knows? Stranger things have happened. But just to bookend this conversation on Univ Four because I want to move on to prometheum here, that's going to be a fun conversation. But the general idea is I forget who made this. Point, but this is sort of a continuation of a trend that we've actually talked about a couple of times on the show now, which is there's assuming a greater amount of complexity, especially on the supply side of these DEXes like Univ Three was a big move in that direction. And this seems to be even a continuation of that trend and you see it in other Dex architecture and construction as well. Blend actually explicitly spelled out that they were making that assumption and I guess we'll just have to see if that's the right move in the end.
00:28:43.220 - 00:29:00.700, Speaker A: I suppose the detriment is that it allows for a much more customizable, sort of flexible product that pushes out experimentation to the edges instead of in the core. But the flip side is that it's not as easy for a retail user base to understand.
00:29:02.910 - 00:29:03.818, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:29:03.984 - 00:29:31.026, Speaker C: The closing thought that I have on this is frankly that they very clearly want to win the entire Dex market and the trading market and they are also not going away. Like they're continuing to innovate, continuing to build and they're not done yet. And so know, frankly, just like hats off to them to continuing to pound work out and get stuff done and we'll see to your point, Mike, it's experimental. We're going to see what happens and.
00:29:31.048 - 00:29:31.906, Speaker B: What people build with it.
00:29:31.928 - 00:29:34.206, Speaker C: But at know people are taking shots.
00:29:34.398 - 00:29:37.206, Speaker A: Agree. Miles, what do you think?
00:29:37.388 - 00:30:42.326, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess the last thought I have is I think it's a little analogous to Ethereum and Roll ups. Basically before Ethereum makes any decisions about an exact design that it wants to commit to, it lets basically a lot of teams experiment with different designs at the roll up level and you can kind of see over time what works best. And maybe there is no one thing that works best for everybody. And so you want to have a lot of these different implementations and if they had implemented, they could have basically said, here are the hooks we want that will make the best version of Univ Four and here you go. But instead they're putting out all these tools. And I could be wrong, but I believe you can now deploy new AMM pools permissionlessly with these hooks which basically take all the decision power out of governance. And that is to me like derisking from a governance perspective.
00:30:42.326 - 00:31:00.640, Speaker D: It's making governance, which I think is always smart, and it's also going to accelerate the experimentation, the rate of experimentation, because you're outsourcing it to a market. So, yeah, that's the one thing I would want to leave with very similar to.
00:31:02.450 - 00:31:18.466, Speaker A: I agree with that. Let's move on. Talk about prometheum a little bit. So, got to give I think the credit belongs here to investigative reporter moonlight extraordinaire Matt Walsh of Castle Island here, who sort of blew the top off this story.
00:31:18.568 - 00:31:19.346, Speaker C: Crushed it.
00:31:19.448 - 00:31:42.614, Speaker A: Crushed it on Saw He, so he tweeted a little there was actually a Wall Street Journal op ed that talked about Prometheum and I saw Matt sort of retweet it and then apparently he dug in and he put together what is a really bizarre, frankly, story and series of facts. So obviously the kind of backstory here is can you guys see my screen? No, I'm not presenting.
00:31:42.662 - 00:31:43.574, Speaker B: I'll share it. Yep.
00:31:43.622 - 00:32:16.194, Speaker A: All right. Boom. All right. So I'm kind of walking along here. Matt's thread, but the backstory to this, obviously, is that the SEC is bringing enforcement cases on Coinbase and Gemini and they're sort of giving the stiff arm to Robinhood and it's obviously not a great sort of environment. And amidst this sort of wave of enforcement actions, prometheum, which is a relatively unheard of startup in crypto, gets approval for its first of a kind special purpose broker dealer license. And this has obviously been a gigantic sticking point for Coinbase.
00:32:16.194 - 00:33:11.350, Speaker A: This was the allegation against Coinbase that they were operating an unregistered securities. Their CEO, the CEO gets kind of dragged up in front of Congress and he testifies and Matt and actually one of the other Congressmen, Mike Floods as well, sort of points out that these really sound a lot kind of like the Democratic SEC sort of talking points. And Matt sort of dug into the business model of Prometheum and finds that actually they are going to launch a Prometheum chain. In fact, the business model doesn't make much sense unless there's a token. And as we all know, despite what the SEC says, a public blockchain and a token is not you can't really register that as business. They're totally incompatible. And it actually turns out that there was a presale of a token to I'm actually going to butcher the pronunciation of this name, wang wang Chang, but it's a CCP affiliate.
00:33:11.350 - 00:33:18.486, Speaker A: So a CCP affiliate has basically purchased the presale of this token. And it's just kind of this extremely.
00:33:18.518 - 00:34:20.862, Speaker C: Bizarre there's so much to like, we definitely got a link to this in the show notes or something because anybody listening who hasn't gone through this thread absolutely should. Yeah, it starts with the back and forth with Congressman, I believe, Flood. And the TLDR of that is you've got on one end all of the regulators saying, come in and register these have to be traded as securities on ATSs. And on the flip side, there are no ATSs. Well, suddenly, after six years of Prometheum getting founded and being worked on, not delivering any product, but suddenly now launching their broker dealer license for special purpose, BD gets turned on. Which means that ostensibly they're able to trade in such digital asset security tokens that regulators say are only available to be traded on platforms like Prometheum. Well, as it turns out, there have been no digital asset security tokens designated to date.
00:34:20.862 - 00:35:09.402, Speaker C: There are unregistered, according to recent filings, assets that are digital assets that are said to be unregistered securities those can't be traded on an ATS, nor can things that are not considered to be securities and therefore commodities like Bitcoin and ostensibly ethereum. So you're really at this interesting impasse where this is said to be the only place where these digital assets security tokens can trade, but there are none to trade. There are none that exist with any real sort of volume. Maybe there's some Aspen condos that are tokenized that are available to trade as Vance was talking about, but there are no existing real assets or with real volume assets that can trade on this. So it's this absolute catch 22 and then you dig into the backstory of Prometheum and the story just goes absolute apeshit.
00:35:09.546 - 00:36:00.894, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to clarify, so Robin Hood tried to get this ATS as well and they got denied in March of this year. They had been after it for 16 months and then all of a sudden it was pulled back. And instead of Robin Hood a company with I think over probably like 50 or 60 million users in the US. They gave it to this literal who company founded by three guys with the same last name that are obviously related, two of which went to a law school that is unaccredited, that was funded by a broker dealer who went and raised venture money for them, which is extraordinarily unusual. And they clearly raised some if not most of this money from China. Also, the broker dealer also has just tons of they have 18 regulatory actions against them from raising money for sham companies and doing all this stuff.
00:36:00.894 - 00:36:56.720, Speaker B: So here's what I think happened. They obviously tried to figure out a way that they could distract away from the fact that we might need new regulation by saying like, look, these guys have an know, they'll cop to it in front of Congress even though literally nobody's ever heard of them. But they didn't do enough backchanneling or at least research to understand know, a this story is entirely implausible, like Mike Flood basically dismantled them right there. B their backstory is incredibly sketchy and c they have ties to the Chinese Communist Party. And so now you have the blockchain association filing a Freedom of Information Act against the SEC to find out what exactly, if any relations they had with Prometheus or whatever it's called. But like in my mind this is just going to backfire incredibly hard against them and I just think it's just fucking terrible. I just am losing more faith in the government every single day.
00:36:57.350 - 00:37:31.246, Speaker C: My favorite little kind of like cherry on top of this entire story was somebody snapped a photo of what was going on in the chamber halls of Congress while they were being interviewed in front of regulators, in front of Congresspeople. And literally the Kaplans were passing notes to each other as they were waiting to answer these questions. It's like, okay, you're literally just reading off of a script. And that's what the FOIA to Vance's point, hopefully will disclose something where there is some sort of connection here because it felt too canned and too pre.
00:37:31.268 - 00:37:50.322, Speaker B: Rehearsed the charade is getting just patently ridiculous and is falling apart. I think that's actually bullish for regulation, but it's just like if you're going to try to pull one over on people, at least do an hour of legwork to make it seem a little bit not suspicious. This was just a total clown car.
00:37:50.456 - 00:37:50.754, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:50.792 - 00:38:26.238, Speaker D: And it seemed kind of similar to when he was propping up SBF and FTX for their special regulatory classifications. He just really knows how to pick them as it relates to these allied or like Trojan horse partners, basically, to kill crypto from the inside. And this one, yeah, definitely a lot less scary than something like FTX, where if they hadn't been frauds, that might have actually worked out. I don't really know what to make of it.
00:38:26.404 - 00:38:29.566, Speaker C: It may seem like only frauds are the ones that get through here.
00:38:29.748 - 00:38:42.974, Speaker B: The exchange between I forget which one, aaron or Adam Kaplan, the guy with the bad sideburns, and Mike Flood is just absolutely like, can you trade regulated tokens on your exchange?
00:38:43.022 - 00:38:43.234, Speaker A: Yes.
00:38:43.272 - 00:38:51.714, Speaker B: It's like, can you trade any of these? It's like, no. It's like, why not? Because they would need to register as securities. Is there a path to do that? No. Unbelievable.
00:38:51.842 - 00:39:01.326, Speaker A: You know, it's a fun little callback to 2017. That broker dealer is actually behind the Long Island Iced Tea Company from 2017.
00:39:01.328 - 00:39:07.882, Speaker C: And they got in trouble for it.
00:39:08.016 - 00:39:08.700, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:09.150 - 00:39:32.660, Speaker A: Goes all the way to the top. What it feels sort of to me is like they picked this one sort of company with a whole bunch of dubious ties and history and kind of this weird clown car of executives, and they're trying to hold it up and say, hey, see, we're not biased. We will let properly regulated licensed businesses operate in the US. It's like, no.
00:39:34.150 - 00:40:08.398, Speaker C: What I think ultimately the intention is with all of this is they clearly chose somebody who has no preexisting business ties or no preexisting users, no preexisting assets on the platform. And that's really, I think, what their goal is. Basically their goal is to say, okay, great, we're going to regulate this industry. But what that means is that we're starting from zero right now. Everything that preexisted is done. It's over, it's unregulatable, it's not going to exist henceforth. And anybody who wants to restart can get going right now under the confines of everything that we approve, starting right now, which obviously is never going to work.
00:40:08.398 - 00:40:22.500, Speaker C: You can't just kill an industry because you don't like it. I think it's going to come to a head at some point. But I do truly think their intention and their way forward and their scapegoat here is to basically say, we're just going to restart everything right now.
00:40:23.430 - 00:40:24.770, Speaker B: Hard reboot.
00:40:25.590 - 00:41:12.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we've talked about this on previous shows, but I'll just reiterate this and I'll put my hand up and say I'm not some sort of legal strategist or whatever, but it does feel like the SEC is picking a lot of fights with they're fighting a battle on a whole bunch of different fronts right now. And I'm sure there's probably some strategy here. Know Gary knows his tenure in the SEC is not going to be indefinite and so he probably wants to open as many actions in the case that hopefully one of them hits. But he's now picked a fight with a whole bunch of different entities, many of which frankly have large war chests and he's kind of made that old expression, politics made odd bedfellows or whatever. Well, we're all kind of bedfellows. Um, so I don't I if history.
00:41:12.760 - 00:41:44.480, Speaker C: Suggests number one, I think Binance has already come out and said that they have a billion dollars set aside to fight this. But if history suggests these suits that are being raised right now are not going to get anywhere close to being resolved during the tenure of Gary Dansler. So it's going to know after he's gone and there's not going to be any resolution and these things are not going to be like a fold and just give up type situation. They're going to be a fight tooth and nail between Coinbase and Binance. So long arc of storyline here that's going to happen.
00:41:45.010 - 00:42:32.562, Speaker B: The path to regulatory clarity or regulatory friendliness, whatever you want to call it, is like there's multiple I actually I read this tweet from I think it was Alexander Grieve or Justin Slaughter, one of the guys who's the legal counsel at Paradigm, which is know, if you have this bill pass, it's probably going to be a little bit more restrictive than if you had. Just like people win these court cases and nothing really changed. And it just kind of continued to exist in this amorphous gray zone. I don't personally want that. I want the regulation. But the path to regulatory clarity is threefold court cases get won. I would put that ODS at probably like 60 40, like Grayscale Ripple, Coinbase.
00:42:32.562 - 00:43:00.600, Speaker B: I think those are kind of winnable cases. New administration. If you look at the betting ODS unpredicted, it's like 50 50 right now and then this bill passing. So if you have three different things that each have a 50 60% chance of happening, for me that suggests that regulatory clarity is coming, maybe not in the timeline that we want actually maybe sooner than we actually might actually think, but there's a lot of different things that can play out. Favor.
00:43:01.050 - 00:43:19.430, Speaker C: There's actually another one that Vance and I have talked about, but I think Paul for CLO at Coinbase tweeted about, which is there's next year going to be a Supreme Court case which revisits the decision that happened in 1984. I think it's of the main fisheries and Chevron.
00:43:19.510 - 00:43:21.770, Speaker B: It's Chevron versus natural resources.
00:43:21.850 - 00:44:12.090, Speaker C: Natural resource chevron versus natural resource, defense, whatever. Basically the premise is, who gets to decide when there's ambiguity within the law? Who gets to decide? Kind of like Tigers to the runner versus tide goes to the base. And I think generally what this could mean is that instead of having what the decision was in 1984 was that when there is sort of ambiguity, it goes to the regulator to decide what will happen. And what this could potentially posit is that now you're going to have a decision that has to get adjudicated by a court, as opposed to this is something that gets decided upon by the regulators. That is sort of an indirect way of getting to some resolution because then you have to start going back through the court system. But it would be a major change in how we look at regulators.
00:44:12.450 - 00:44:59.420, Speaker B: And everybody knows the Supreme Court has a lot of conservative justices on it. And if you look at the five that are conservative, they're basically all in favor of trimming this case down or overturning it completely. And so if it got overturned, it would basically say, unless it's explicitly authorized by Congress, regulators need to follow the exact letter of the law. There can't be these ambiguous interpretations, maybe not even rulemakings. So, I mean, that would have a lot further reaching consequences than just crypto. But add up those four paths, multiply it by the expected value or what you think would happen to the crypto markets if they happened, and you get like a pretty high expected value, in my mind at least.
00:45:00.350 - 00:45:04.540, Speaker A: Yeah, the way that I kind of think about this as well is.
00:45:07.650 - 00:45:07.966, Speaker B: If.
00:45:07.988 - 00:45:40.722, Speaker A: You'Re putting yourselves in the SEC's, all right, so rewind the clock to like two years ago, a lot of the argument was, hey, a lot of wealth gets created in private markets. It is BS that the everyday average Joe's can't get access to this. This is a tool of the elite. Yada yada, yada. That was when people were making money and that was the perception. Now it's the opposite. Now it's sort of turned around and everyone is losing money and it's like, hey regulators, why didn't you protect us? And I think that's generally why regulators come in and they don't try to be preventative.
00:45:40.722 - 00:46:15.986, Speaker A: They come in and sort of mop up the mess because only at such a time when everyone is losing money is there actually public demand to come in and do things. So that's probably why this all happens like this. The other thing, frankly, that might make the SEC and whoever is chairperson in a couple of years, it may make their life harder, is that we might enter another bull market. And frankly, the sort of public opinion and the desire to restrict people from crypto, the tides might turn right at the time when, you know what I.
00:46:16.008 - 00:46:39.180, Speaker B: Mean, you have a point. Like the same thing happened with SPACs when they were pumping, nobody cared. Kind of had that first dip in the summer of 2021 where they changed the accounting rules of how you could launch a SPAC and they did it when it was obviously kind of coming down. But after that you've seen no new SPACs. So there's precedent there.
00:46:39.870 - 00:47:37.360, Speaker C: Yeah, but SPACs haven't been regulated. All the major SPACs launched after that happened because everybody was in the pipeline. I think the bigger thing, I understand the bull bear market size of things. The thing that I think is the biggest, frankly, and there is a little bit of news on this this week, is SBF and all of the intricacies and ties that were generated and therefore all of the issues that were fostered with regulators or people in Congress based off of what happened with SBF and FTX. And I think that one of the best things that could happen to this industry is we get to see his day in court and get to see all the stuff play out. The eight counts that he was charged with are going to go through and the court date is set, at least supposedly for October 2. There was a discussion as to whether or not the few things that were found and he was charged with after the fact, once he was already back in the US.
00:47:37.360 - 00:47:56.210, Speaker C: Whether or not that would have to go through Bahamanian Supreme Court decisions or Tort decisions. And that would have delayed, potentially, the start of this legal proceeding by months to years. I generally think that once we get to see some resolution there, things will have a much more copacetic perspective.
00:47:57.270 - 00:48:40.286, Speaker A: Yeah, you might be right. I want to get to two more topics here, which is one is tether, and then the last one is just sort of like a divergence in the Nasdaq and what's going on in crypto. So yesterday, actually, over the course of the last three days, there's been a market shift in curve's three pool. The three pool has three different assets, three stablecoins, which is USDT, Tether, USDC and Dai. And it's kind of the on chain venue for liquidity of the major stablecoins. And it's called the Fiddy indicator, which is I think named after one of the curve devs who first noticed this. But there's actually an inverse relationship in between the percentage of tether and the price of ethereum.
00:48:40.286 - 00:49:39.346, Speaker A: The idea generally being when people are withdrawing tether from the three pool, they're going and doing risky things with it. And then when the percentage of tether has gone up, it means that people are going risk off. And in the past an extremely high percentage of tether has meant coincided with extreme stress in market conditions. So the two previous peaks in terms of percentage of tether in the three pool have been in May of this year, of last year with Terra Luna and then in November of last year with FTX. So over the course of the last three days, there's been a market shift in, I think Tether least at one point today was at almost 80% of the three pool, which historically would have signaled a lot of stress and sort of indicates that someone would be selling tether. Now, the caveats to all of this are that the three pool has much less volume than it used to. So there's a chance, yeah, it's just a lower volume pool and it's smaller selling.
00:49:39.346 - 00:50:11.486, Speaker A: To get to that extreme percentage, the signal might be a little bit diluted in that sense. Both Binance and Tether did put out statements saying something like, hey, there's going to be a transition here. We're converting a bunch of Tron based tether into ethereum based, or vice versa. I will say you never know how to trust those sort of corporate comms, right? Especially around when there could be potential crises. But it does look a little weird and it caused a good bit of panic. And the last thing, little bit of context, a lot. And then Miles will let you go.
00:50:11.486 - 00:50:27.698, Speaker A: Here is I think this was an Adam Cochrane tweet that apparently Tether's financials have been leaked to Coinbase and there is speculation that is CoinDesk, CoinDesk, CoinDesk. Thank you. And that's what could have set off the miles, sorry, you look like you.
00:50:27.704 - 00:50:28.806, Speaker B: Were going to say no, I was.
00:50:28.828 - 00:51:11.220, Speaker D: Just trying to understand the indicator because I understand one side of it. When everybody's really nervous about a big blow up, they tend to also get nervous about tether. And so I can totally see why during FTX and Luna, the pool skewed tether. I don't know if I fully understand why people why you would need tether in particular to go speculate, but I think know who knows what the hell is going on here. But this is typically we're going to see this again and again. When anything looks sketchy, people will get out of Tether. And I think back of my head, it's been a worry for years.
00:51:11.220 - 00:51:38.890, Speaker D: Just because we don't really know what's going on, finance can kind of create that same area as just we'll see. It sounds like there's more coming out on the story that could be attributed to driving at least what's moving around the percentages. But yeah, it is interesting. Anytime anybody gets nervous, they run out of tether.
00:51:39.470 - 00:51:45.120, Speaker B: The DPEG was at its lowest level, nine, five, four.
00:51:47.170 - 00:51:50.800, Speaker C: Less than half of less than 50 basis points.
00:51:51.410 - 00:52:27.020, Speaker B: So it's ten bips to redeem and we know people who redeem that is working. The other thing is, so you recently had Binance when Binance does withdrawals.com and us, you can kind of see.com sometimes refill us as balances. But the two most popular chains to do it on that have the most USDT on it are ETH and Tron. Strangely enough. What is going on on Tron? I have literally no clue, but whatever.
00:52:27.020 - 00:53:01.430, Speaker B: And recently the ETH balances for USDT were running basically at zero. And so they did a chain swap. They took 750,000,000 from Tron and they put it on ETH. And so you do have this endogenous large amount of supply that was created on chain that a lot of this is going to go into the curve pool because it's the biggest on chain venue for this to happen. That's the first thing. And then the second thing is the wallets that we have tagged as Tether just bought up all of the Dpegged USDT. So they're buying.
00:53:01.430 - 00:53:06.646, Speaker B: I just think people are susceptible to getting Fudded right now.
00:53:06.748 - 00:53:07.206, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:53:07.308 - 00:53:23.294, Speaker B: When the stablecoin FUD gets busted out, it's like, God, what the hell? The USDC FUD was actually turned out to be real, but for no cause of its own. It's because the bank that backed it blew up. But this one is classic. Like, let's freak everybody out a little bit more.
00:53:23.332 - 00:53:26.640, Speaker C: Hey, somebody bought some $0.92 USDC, though.
00:53:27.490 - 00:53:34.446, Speaker B: Yeah, true. I mean, that was probably not worth it on a risk adjusted basis.
00:53:34.478 - 00:53:36.958, Speaker A: Just I'm with you, dude.
00:53:37.054 - 00:53:45.470, Speaker B: You're betting on a fucking Silicon Valley bank bailout. What do you know on chain that those people don't?
00:53:45.550 - 00:53:46.322, Speaker D: Doesn't feel good.
00:53:46.376 - 00:53:51.686, Speaker A: No, nothing. And it's like 8% is your upside. Yeah, I'm with you on that.
00:53:51.708 - 00:54:02.540, Speaker D: Vance, when you said they're buying, I just got, like, flashbacks to the steady lads tweet. Let's hope it's a little bit different this time.
00:54:03.950 - 00:54:05.002, Speaker C: We don't need to go there.
00:54:05.056 - 00:54:08.460, Speaker B: We don't need to go there, but we'll see.
00:54:09.470 - 00:54:45.142, Speaker A: I'm sure it'll be fine. All right, last story here and maybe we can cue this. I think it was Travis Kling that tweeted out this chart. Am I still sharing my screen here? Yeah, one SEC. But basically I'd love to just kind of get maybe Vance and Michael could call on you here to sort of just get your thoughts on where we're at market cycle wise. Know, it was kind of an interesting know, Travis's sort of caption here is not the decoupling we wanted, but the decoupling we deserve. And the Nasdaq is taking off and crypto is down quite a bit.
00:54:45.142 - 00:55:01.520, Speaker A: I will say before I want to source everyone's opinion here, it's always been a little bit of a bugaboo of mine to just take like, one cherry pick one very specific period of time and then just look at divergences in between. I just think that's pretty this has never happened before.
00:55:02.050 - 00:55:03.566, Speaker B: This is brand new.
00:55:03.748 - 00:55:47.734, Speaker C: Also, let's just put a backdrop here. Unfortunately, Travis got stuck in the FTX debacle. I'd say that the sentiment on crypto for him has completely soured. So he's just looking for any opportunity to bash on everything that we're talking about here. And if you were to break apart the components of that Nasdaq growth, I bet 80% of that is Nvidia and the rest of it is probably well performing tech assets. But it's probably the top ten at max that are driving the rest of those returns. And on the bitcoin side, it's because we had some structural selling based off of what the SEC just said around not bitcoin in particular, but other digital assets.
00:55:47.734 - 00:55:50.060, Speaker C: Like, this is just a structural issue in my mind.
00:55:50.510 - 00:56:01.360, Speaker B: So I was watching this podcast with Jeff Gunblack, who at this point I've just started outsourcing all of my macro views to Jeff because he's the absolute.
00:56:02.930 - 00:56:04.378, Speaker A: Just he's the bond king.
00:56:04.474 - 00:56:35.322, Speaker B: He's the bond king. There's a couple of funny articles about him where apparently he's asked people who've had lunch with him what's it like to have lunch with the genius. He's on one, but he's smart and he knows it. But his whole point is like the S and P 493 is negative on the air. The S and P seven is doing exceptionally well. And the things I think about when I see like, Nasdaq decoupling from crypto, usually it's like a crypto specific issue. The regulatory stuff.
00:56:35.322 - 00:57:15.702, Speaker B: Like you have Celsius, you have Voyager, they're going to be either distributing or selling alts. You have Robinhood Delisting three tokens, there's some meat to get through, but all of that's going to happen probably in June or July, at least those three. Then you have the Mount Gox bitcoin sales, you have this potential further action against Binance, which is going around on Twitter. And this doesn't seem like out of the ordinary for me. It's not like there's something structurally wrong with crypto. There's just like a bunch of negative catalysts right now and that's fine. The thing it reminds me of is March 2020, where everything fell apart, crypto more than anything else.
00:57:15.702 - 00:57:21.222, Speaker B: I think we were buying ETH at I think it was like 2005.
00:57:21.356 - 00:57:24.166, Speaker C: No, we started when we started buying.
00:57:24.278 - 00:57:26.998, Speaker B: So we raised the fund, we bought.
00:57:27.014 - 00:57:29.206, Speaker C: All this 216 average cost basis.
00:57:29.238 - 00:57:30.450, Speaker B: Yeah, like 216.
00:57:30.630 - 00:57:31.360, Speaker A: Nice.
00:57:31.890 - 00:58:12.380, Speaker B: And then it went to 80 and we were like, no, not like this. And then that happened and then stocks started to rip after that. And I forget what the first ones were, but it was zoom, I think was the first one. And that was kind of what led everything else. But crypto just didn't move at all. And that was when a bunch of people were trying tokenize stocks because people thought that people would want to trade stocks on chain because crypto wasn't moving anywhere. And it kind of had this run where it set the stage for crypto outperformance later in the year.
00:58:12.380 - 00:58:40.718, Speaker B: But that's what happens. People are going to bid the ten year down to like 371st from where Fed Funds is at five and a half, whatever. Then they're going to bid tech stocks because those have real business models and that's what everyone over the past 15 years has been trained to buy the dip on. And then you're probably going to buy some random stuff after that. But all. Of this stuff is getting expensive. I checked today, Nvidia is trading at a 220 times price to earnings.
00:58:40.718 - 00:59:01.974, Speaker B: Meta is at its all time high in terms of its price to earnings ratio, and it's tripled since the bottom. And so can the stock market keep going up? Should you hope for it? As a crypto investor, 100%. But things are getting to that point where it's pretty expensive. Kathy woods sold Nvidia because she said it was in a bubble. You're starting to see people put markers out.
00:59:02.012 - 00:59:02.614, Speaker A: Oh, boy.
00:59:02.732 - 00:59:06.826, Speaker B: I know. And when she does that, I don't think I've ever like, there was nothing in 2021 where she was like, this.
00:59:06.848 - 00:59:07.930, Speaker C: Is too expensive.
00:59:09.710 - 00:59:35.860, Speaker B: But she's putting her foot down now. I also listened to the Danielle Di Martino Booth interview with I think yeah, it was with Jack Farley and she was like, the stock market's about to start falling apart, maybe, or it's just going to keep getting bid up and you're just mad that these don't fit with your priced earnings models. Historically? Kind of hard to tell.
00:59:36.230 - 00:59:49.526, Speaker A: It's tough to predict this. I mean, we did have an FOMC this week, and since this is a macro pod, we can just give a slight overview, but this is the first time that we didn't get a hike in quite a long period of time. So we got a pause on this one.
00:59:49.548 - 00:59:52.070, Speaker C: Yeah, but nobody cared about the hike. They cared about the dots.
00:59:52.490 - 01:00:01.740, Speaker B: Does anybody believe that shit anymore? Like Hawkish Skip or like a dovish 25 basis point hike? I feel like I just don't believe anything that this man says.
01:00:02.270 - 01:00:39.266, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's why people are concerned is the dot plot said there's going to be two more hikes this year, so another 50 basis points, but we'll see. I sort of think he's trying to have his lunch and have his cake and eat it too, because he's pausing to see if there's going to be something catastrophic that breaks in the financial system between now and then. Basically, if nothing does, then they'll keep hiking. But I feel like the fact that we're getting any sort of pause right now tells you that. And by the way, even, what's 50 more basis points, that's the peak. And then we're rolling off after there. So we've been through the meat of the hiking cycle, I think.
01:00:39.308 - 01:01:04.030, Speaker B: Yeah. Little round of applause for everyone going through the most gnarly tightening cycle, basically of all time in terms of speed and delta from the base. But my personal dot plot, I either think it's done or there's one more 25 basis point hike, but I think inflation is going to go to zero or negative at some point in the next 18 months and it's going to look insane if rates are still at like five and a quarter.
01:01:04.610 - 01:01:57.380, Speaker C: Someone had a really good analogy. I can't remember who, but who I was watching and basically gave the description of what is happening at the Fed right now. And they're driving with their hand on the wheel and their head has turned completely 90 degrees the other way, 180 degrees the other way. They're looking backwards. But I think one of the great points about all of the financialization of everything, whether or not you want to call it accurate or not, it's been directionally correct. But if you look at things like Trueflation or Manaheim or any of the shelter indices like Redfin and some of the private data points, anybody who's following any of that and it's forecasted and it's forward looking, can tell exactly what you just said. Vance which is it's going to go negative, and I think it was bank of America or Citi said that this could be the largest decrease month over month, two months in a row decrease in inflation that they've ever seen.
01:01:57.380 - 01:02:14.920, Speaker C: Because now we're talking about a headline CPI print of 3.2 next month. And from 4.94.03 .2, that would be the largest decrease in two months. All of the stuff is going to happen. It's just a question of when.
01:02:14.920 - 01:02:38.240, Speaker C: I don't know when rates are going to drop. I find it hilarious as well that everybody's looking at dot plots of also people who vote on this stuff and people who don't vote on this stuff being factored into those dot plots. These are just perspectives of people. And yeah, I think it's all going to happen very quickly and next month will be a big one.
01:02:38.930 - 01:03:12.154, Speaker A: The other thing that I would say as well is this stuff is all very complicated. The financial system is this gigantic amalgamation of a whole bunch of different economic activity and different sectors. And there haven't actually been that many periods of time that we've had inflation within the last 100 years. So anyone that points to quote unquote, precedent here, you're really pointing at like two times, so it doesn't really tell you that much. And the other thing that people miss is a lot of this stuff is very relational. And what I mean by that is people are like, well, bitcoin or crypto can't do well if interest rates are at 5%. the.com
01:03:12.154 - 01:03:47.298, Speaker A: bubble happened when Fed Funds was over 5% that people don't really remember. And the thing about inflation, let's just say, Vance, it's the opposite of what you just said, and there's going to be inflation for a long period of time. Bonds get smoked in inflation. That's like the number one thing that really gets hit because the fixed income that you're getting out into the future is devalued from inflation. So then money will move elsewhere. And it's just like people make decisions based on what they're going to buy relative to other assets. So if anyone's pointing to, oh, I think interest rates are going to be here, so crypto can't do well, I.
01:03:47.304 - 01:04:25.920, Speaker C: Just think that's a myopic here's a great data point. This week I was reading a report from, I think it was CalPERS or Cal Sters, I can't remember which one. But you're talking 100 plus billion dollars worth of assets and they manage a fully diversified portfolio, fixed income, probably like real assets, real estate, but also private equity, hedge funds and of course, venture. Right now the allocation that they have to venture is about 1.2% of their NAV, which is in the order of about 800 million to a billion per year that they're allocating to new venture funds. The goal that they have for the next two years is to ramp that from 1.2% to 6%.
01:04:25.920 - 01:05:05.102, Speaker C: So think about that when you have all of these storylines of General Catalyst came out this week and they said that they're raising a $5 billion fund, you've got multiple billion dollar funds that everybody who was talking about this over the last six months said, no possible way. Do these happen? Sure, I think some of these don't happen. Insight tried to raise 20 and currently is at two and they're going to cut their size. TCV, same thing. Sizes will get cut, but the allocation is not going anywhere. And if anything, it's getting ramped up and probably just going to be extended over the next period of time. So when it comes to innovation financing, I don't think there's anything that's really going to change over the next, let's call it three to five years next year.
01:05:05.102 - 01:05:08.510, Speaker C: This year might be tough, but you have to extend the timeline.
01:05:09.890 - 01:05:36.822, Speaker B: As a quick aside on the Fed, everyone should watch Jeff Gondlax interviews on CNBC about the Fed. He has so much contempt for these people. He refused to call it he refuses to call it an institution. Instead he calls it like a program, like it's like a children's play. And his whole perspective is that we should replace the Fed with the two year treasury and just never ever print money again. I don't think that's really going to happen. He's kind of like an anarcho capitalist at this point.
01:05:36.822 - 01:05:45.660, Speaker B: But the level of disdain that man has for the Fed is absolutely hilarious. And it comes through in all these interviews in the funniest watch.
01:05:46.430 - 01:06:41.914, Speaker A: I don't know how disdainful he is, but the other guy that I always like listening to is Stan Ruckenmiller. He's just got such a long sort of career of being he's been wrong a couple of times, but he's been right obviously quite a lot and pays a lot of attention to this one point that he brought up that resonated. And you actually see it all the time in crypto because there's a lot of excess during bull markets and then you see who's swimming naked. But generally it's like, to paraphrase his point was when interest rates are low for even a short period of time, people do really dumb things. But when they're really low for eleven years, people do really dumb things. And it kind of made me think what are the industries that have just been money printers for a really long time that there are probably just some horrendous practices going on under the hood. And one industry, especially in finance that's never really had a reckoning is private equity and those guys have just been a money printer for such a long time.
01:06:41.914 - 01:06:56.160, Speaker A: There are these weird I don't know if anyone listens to Bethany McLean. She's like dug into the industry a little bit. There are some weird sets of incentives that happen in private equity like that. I have no evidence for this and I'm purely speculating but I mean.
01:06:58.310 - 01:07:48.034, Speaker B: You ever seen the movie Seven with Brad Pitt? I don't think anybody wants to know what is in the mystery private equity box. I think the other one is just like these mega growth funds in tech. I think when you peel back the curtain on that there's going to be multi billion dollar holes in all of these mega funds. And if I had an option between do I LP into a crypto mega fund like the Andreessen Horowitz Four and a half 5,000,000,001 or do I give it to General Catalyst man? I'm choosing crypto 100% of the time. I think there is some serious damage that has been done to those funds and they have not been marked properly and it's just because it's just corporate equity and if you keep these zombie companies alive long enough it all comes.
01:07:48.072 - 01:08:08.070, Speaker C: Down to the Private Marts. It all comes down to the Private Marts and nobody's calling anybody out on the Private Marts. And the crazy part is to go back to private equity. We talked about commercial real estate. Obviously that as interest rates go up we can see that that will get squeezed. It already is getting squeezed. We're seeing that reflected in these bank holdings.
01:08:08.070 - 01:09:12.746, Speaker C: But the thing that people aren't necessarily talking about is the leverage that gets put onto every single portfolio company of every single private equity firm and commercial in many cases that's a fixed term or it has all these covenants that enable you to have the ability to change the terms and refinance in ways that are limited. They are so inflation rate heavy dominated that they actually have a lot of controls over how they operate. Private equity firms have none. All of leverage finance is like, as rates go up, it's Libor plus like 300 bips. And the second that rates go up, it means that all the companies that they have leveraged are unable to make their debt service payments and they're having to take on additional capital and put that onto the balance sheet. Of these portfolio companies just so that they can be able to make payments for debt service to outlast this higher for longer or whatever we end up seeing with interest rates. I think the decimation of private equity is going to start well.
01:09:12.928 - 01:09:34.900, Speaker A: I've actually got a couple of budies in private equity and I've asked people this question like, hey, isn't the reason private equity has done so well is because interest rates have been going down? So shouldn't it reverse? How does this connect the dots for me? And I've asked this to Miles, a bunch of our friends of private equity. And everyone's like, no, it doesn't really matter, actually. It's like, how does it not matter?
01:09:35.510 - 01:09:37.730, Speaker B: Because the management fees are flowing.
01:09:38.630 - 01:09:47.942, Speaker C: It's a recurring revenue business. It is the best recurring revenue business on the face of the earth. It's contractually obligated for ten years, so long as you raise a new fund.
01:09:48.076 - 01:10:24.418, Speaker A: You know what? I'm also sort of biased against private equity. I have a buddy who sent me, a meme that cracked me up the other day. It was like, you ever have something that you used to love but now is shit? You have private equity to thank for that. And I do have you know what I mean? Miles and I went to school in Atlanta, and there's a lot of these places down there. You go into a restaurant, and it kind of looks nice before you actually look at everything, and everything's cheap and way marked up. And you pay, like, $45 for branzino with a lot of grease, and you're like you just feel like you're being extracted. You know what I'm talking about? There are lots of restaurants and places like that.
01:10:24.418 - 01:10:25.802, Speaker A: Those are all PE backed.
01:10:25.886 - 01:10:33.350, Speaker D: Anything that's too good to be true is you can thank the VCs for that. And then anything that's just, like, gilded and absolutely shitty.
01:10:37.770 - 01:10:45.290, Speaker B: At least the VC people have a claim towards trying to finance the future. Private equity people are just trying to oh, I agree. Everything that already exists.
01:10:46.430 - 01:10:50.854, Speaker A: Yeah, they're asset harvesters. And they're asset harvesters.
01:10:50.902 - 01:11:11.620, Speaker B: So let me tell this story real quick. So my friend is an LP in a big private equity fund. And so there's like, six funds for this PE fund. And Fund Five had a big liquidity event. My friend was like, awesome. That's great. Who bought it? They were like, Fund Six bought it.
01:11:12.470 - 01:11:12.926, Speaker A: It's.
01:11:12.958 - 01:11:27.286, Speaker B: Like what? Who makes money on that transaction? Is it like Fund Five? That's alarming to me when the PE funds start selling shit to each other, but also to themselves.
01:11:27.468 - 01:11:30.026, Speaker C: Well, to themselves is a different story.
01:11:30.128 - 01:11:31.820, Speaker B: I've never heard of that before.
01:11:33.630 - 01:11:49.914, Speaker C: That may be rot with issues, but the way that most PE transactions happen is it is not like, oh, we're going to sell this to the public and go, IPO. It is a sponsor to sponsored transaction, which means it's a smaller private equity firm selling to a larger one. It's like the small fish, big fish.
01:11:49.962 - 01:11:54.746, Speaker B: Bigger fish, biggest fish, human centipede of private equity.
01:11:54.858 - 01:12:16.422, Speaker A: Well, here's a little hypothetical transaction that could occur, right? You're running a private equity fund. A budy of yours is running a private equity fund too. You each have a company, right? You say hey, I think you should invest in this company, in my portfolio company. Maybe you put $15 million in, mark it up a little bit. Looks good for my books. You also got some companies. I got actually $15 million here, too.
01:12:16.422 - 01:12:28.554, Speaker A: You know what? I'm going to invest it in one of your portfolio companies. Whatever valuation you think seems reasonable. Suddenly both those companies are marked up and everyone has the same amount of money.
01:12:28.592 - 01:12:33.760, Speaker B: Mike, you're talking about million dollars back and forth the last 20 years.
01:12:34.370 - 01:12:39.550, Speaker C: Mike, you're not actually talking about private equity in that instance. You're talking about traditional venture capital.
01:12:41.330 - 01:12:44.686, Speaker A: All right, whatever. But here's the best part. But here's the best part.
01:12:44.708 - 01:13:01.222, Speaker C: You mark up each company, we all look like we have grid books, and then we go off and raise our next fund and live off the management fees for the next ten years. It is insane what some of the it's insane what some of these funds have gotten away with over the last ten years.
01:13:01.356 - 01:13:29.610, Speaker A: Yeah, there was some quote about I forget who said this at one point, but it was one of, like, the big hedge fund guys that shorted. I think it was like Citibank or something. It was one of the big banks in 2008. And he's, like, looking at the books and can't figure it out. And the conclusion that he came to is ultimately that it would just be too inconvenient to too many people for something to fail. And I feel like sometimes things can just happen like that. Also, you got to take into account the market structure.
01:13:29.690 - 01:13:40.260, Speaker B: When do we stop hearing about people that made money during 2008 and have not done anything since? That was 20 years ago. I was eight.
01:13:44.630 - 01:13:47.700, Speaker C: Yeah, you were not eight in 2000.
01:13:48.470 - 01:13:49.942, Speaker A: I was, like, backing into that.
01:13:49.996 - 01:13:51.138, Speaker B: I was also doing that math.
01:13:51.154 - 01:13:52.360, Speaker A: I was like, wait a second.
01:13:53.450 - 01:13:54.898, Speaker C: You were, like, 17.
01:13:54.994 - 01:14:04.326, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I was in high school. But like, dude, I feel like there was some movie that just came out about the great financial crisis.
01:14:04.518 - 01:14:05.690, Speaker C: Who cares?
01:14:06.590 - 01:14:07.462, Speaker B: Honestly?
01:14:07.606 - 01:14:11.582, Speaker C: What's the it's going to start getting filmed on History Channel henceforth. Oh, yeah.
01:14:11.716 - 01:14:16.830, Speaker B: With the Robert McNamara documentaries with just the slow zoom ins on the pictures.
01:14:17.250 - 01:14:20.350, Speaker C: Right after it'll be documentaries about World War II.
01:14:22.050 - 01:14:28.978, Speaker B: Tell me about how they invaded France with the Arden Forest. Okay, great. Let's transition to the GFC. It's like, dude, I don't care about either of those.
01:14:29.144 - 01:14:40.310, Speaker A: Yeah. Margin Call is a pretty epic movie that's aged very well for me. And I just love the Jeremy Irons or whatever his name is, know?
01:14:40.460 - 01:14:43.378, Speaker C: I will say I think that is the best finance movie.
01:14:43.394 - 01:14:53.458, Speaker B: That's better than the big short. Big Short is too long. Also, I don't like Brad Pitt. Yeah. Do you have any updates?
01:14:53.634 - 01:15:01.866, Speaker D: Yeah, they're going to do an SBF movie, so eventually we'll get know the next God cycle.
01:15:01.978 - 01:15:06.334, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like, no complexity there. It's just like he liquidated himself and stole money.
01:15:06.532 - 01:15:07.534, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
01:15:07.652 - 01:15:12.990, Speaker C: Who would play? I was going to say I guess we can't have Army Hammer play the twins anymore.
01:15:14.550 - 01:15:26.574, Speaker B: Do you guys ever watch American Greed? That show? It's on late night on CNBC. It's like basically like local scams and grips. I feel like that's where SBF belongs, not in a real movie.
01:15:26.702 - 01:15:34.434, Speaker A: I like that show a lot, actually. I didn't realize they were still doing it, but yeah, it's a good one. I feel like they've got a michael.
01:15:34.562 - 01:15:41.350, Speaker C: So SBF is supposed to go on trial October 2, give or take. Michael Lewis's book is supposed to come out three days later.
01:15:41.500 - 01:15:46.070, Speaker A: Boy wow. It's pretty perfect timing.
01:15:46.650 - 01:15:49.090, Speaker B: We all have that to look forward to for Thanksgiving.
01:15:49.250 - 01:15:50.640, Speaker A: Oh, it.
01:15:54.530 - 01:15:56.638, Speaker B: Yeah. All right.
01:15:56.804 - 01:16:01.210, Speaker A: That seems like a good place to end it later on one, guys. Cheers.
