00:00:26.570 - 00:00:32.674, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. You've got Michael's, one and two, yano and Vance.
00:00:32.802 - 00:00:37.990, Speaker C: Sorry, travel schedule made me miss last week. Heard it was a good one.
00:00:38.060 - 00:00:45.578, Speaker B: Welcome back, budy. We miss you. The big question is, are we back as an industry? Are we back?
00:00:45.664 - 00:00:53.040, Speaker A: We're back, we're back. We're fully back. People are YOLOing into coins. Like it's November 2021 again.
00:00:53.890 - 00:00:58.800, Speaker D: Normies are texting me like 2022 never happened. People are ready to go.
00:00:59.330 - 00:01:01.920, Speaker C: People are like, what low cap gems should I buy?
00:01:02.690 - 00:01:03.294, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:01:03.412 - 00:01:06.802, Speaker D: Yeah, when you start hearing those three words, low cap gems, it's on.
00:01:06.856 - 00:01:12.180, Speaker A: I will say, though, I missed the boom in telegram groups. Telegram groups are popping off right now.
00:01:12.550 - 00:01:17.430, Speaker D: Yeah, the few survivors are having a great time. Everyone else still dead.
00:01:18.090 - 00:01:36.860, Speaker C: Not to completely reign on the parade, but I'm still holding out that there's going to be something, I don't know, somewhere in a couple of weeks and we're just back to a little doldrums. But this is good. It feels nice. Feels like we could get back in just like a couple of good positive news days.
00:01:37.710 - 00:02:04.546, Speaker D: The thing that I'm kind of looking for in terms of maybe we're not back, or like a scary narrative that could brush people back a little bit is the January inflation print looks hot. Looks like it almost doubled in terms of the acceleration from last time. So I could see there being a little bit of stop and start people getting concerned, something like that.
00:02:04.648 - 00:02:37.386, Speaker C: And specifically what we're talking about is I think it's Cleveland Fed that puts out inflation now, which is a day by day tracking of inflation, and it's an approximation. It's been hot relative to what the actual CPI and PCE prints have been over the last, I think, three or four months. So it hasn't been a perfect barometer of where the actual print will come in, but it is a pretty good indication, at least trend wise, where things are going because it maintains a day to day measure.
00:02:37.498 - 00:03:00.162, Speaker B: Well, earlier we had yesterday, actually, the FOMC and Powell kind of that's where Powell kind of gets up and announces what they're going to do in terms of rate hikes or cuts or whatever. So they did the 25 basis points that most people were expecting, but I think in terms of the verbiage that he used, it came off a lot more dovish than people were expecting.
00:03:00.226 - 00:04:07.674, Speaker C: JPAL not only announces the 25 bips, which everybody and their mother expected to happen but what was really the bulk of the announcement, bulk of the news, was his press conference about a half an hour after the announcement. And that's where you really got to see sort of the conversation point, but also the perspective behind the 25 basis point increase. I think the two kind of major components of this are at least markets following the conversation are now pricing in 50 bips increase for the rest of the year. So that may mean we have another two twenty five s or a twenty five pause and then maybe a 25 later on, or we have more hikes and then rate decreases at the end of the year, but markets are expecting 50 bits. The Tom Lee headline, though, was the word disinflation was used 13 times throughout his conversation. And so at least that word itself is starting to enter into the narrative of what the Fed is putting out. And yeah, dovish is a great way to describe it.
00:04:07.674 - 00:04:20.442, Speaker C: Markets reacted immediately, and we'll mean to Vance's point earlier. Inflation for January could be some cold water that gets thrown on this trend.
00:04:20.586 - 00:05:02.862, Speaker D: We got to put some respect on Tom Lee's name. He was like the only bullish person last year. I would read his letters just to keep the vibes up, even if I didn't necessarily agree with what he was saying. But he's been right. And I just remember all these interviews and if people don't know who Tom Lee is, he's kind of like this permable macro strategist that is very data driven and very contrarian, but also just very smart. But whenever things get bearish, they like to have Tom Lee on CNBC and they just beat him up every single time and it's like, so Tom Lee, you're back and you're still wrong. How does it feel? And these interviews are just terrible, but those are usually a sign know Tom Lee is going to be vindicated at some point, which you have.
00:05:02.996 - 00:05:04.746, Speaker A: He's like the inverse Jim Kramer.
00:05:04.778 - 00:05:08.526, Speaker D: Take yeah, I think Jim Kramer is.
00:05:08.548 - 00:05:20.660, Speaker C: Bullish now, too, which is maybe a negative signal. But yeah, Tom Lee isn't wrong. He's just off by about six to twelve months, it seems.
00:05:21.030 - 00:05:22.786, Speaker D: Yes, he's just early.
00:05:22.888 - 00:05:36.166, Speaker B: I'm a huge fan of Tom Lee. He's been pretty right, I think, by and large. And it's hard to get out there and be bullish when everyone's screaming in your face and it's very consensus to bearish. So I'm a Tom Lee supporter. I'm a stan of Tom Lee for sure.
00:05:36.188 - 00:05:38.306, Speaker D: I like his shout out, Tom Lee.
00:05:38.418 - 00:05:39.260, Speaker B: Me too.
00:05:40.110 - 00:06:01.454, Speaker D: What else is happening with the Fed stuff? I mean, my take was that his heart just wasn't in it. You could tell we're at 25 basis points. It's basically zero. Like, maybe there's one more. A lot of the stuff was crossed out. The Ukraine stuff, the supply chain stuff in the letter. I don't know, it feels good.
00:06:01.454 - 00:06:25.538, Speaker D: Like we're on the other side of what I think is the rate peak. And now you have Powell kind of acknowledging a lot of what people have been screaming at him to acknowledge, which is just the disinflation. It feels like that was like a watershed moment for people who've just been getting beat up by these rate hikes. Like thinking back to last year, the fact that he hiked 75 basis points four times, that's like taking a sledgehammer to just the economy.
00:06:25.714 - 00:06:26.470, Speaker B: Do you remember?
00:06:26.540 - 00:06:51.662, Speaker C: I can't remember if it was June or if it was July, but one of the first 75 basis point increases, he literally walks out there and he's like holding the piece of paper and he's like shaking. Think about that, JPAL, versus this one. This one a lot more cool, calm and collected. But also just like the narrative is something that I think is more conducive to people liking him and not actually hating him.
00:06:51.716 - 00:07:24.182, Speaker B: People had this really specific target in mind of about 3%. Remember, that's what people thought the Fed could get to because when he did his original pivot at one point when he was sort of early in his Fed days, he was like, we are going to be more hawkish and raise rates. And they tried to get above 3%, like the whole market just puked and he famously pivoted. So when he started doing these rate hikes, everyone thought it'll get to like two and a half or 3% or something. And to his credit, I think he kind of made the right decision.
00:07:24.246 - 00:07:25.098, Speaker C: I think he's going to get a.
00:07:25.104 - 00:07:50.974, Speaker D: Lot of credit in retrospect, for 475 basis point hikes in a row, like Gunlack and Drucken. Miller and all the people who are kind of beating up on him over the past couple of years have done a 180 and said he's actually one of the better Fed chairs of our lifetime. And I don't know, looking back, if he didn't hike like that, we still may have a large inflation problem and we're not out of the woods yet, but it was mostly necessary medicine.
00:07:51.102 - 00:08:28.538, Speaker C: I mean drucken. Miller is saying that whenever CPI has surpassed 5% in the history of the Fed, you have to raise Fed funds rate higher than CPI to break CPI. So Drucker. Miller is still calling for like another one and a half percent this year, another 150 basis points this year, which I think would be probably bad policy unless we see inflation really tick up over the next couple of months retick up. But there is a lot of countering perspectives at this point from very esteemed people like Dunlock and Drucken.
00:08:28.554 - 00:08:28.954, Speaker D: Miller.
00:08:29.002 - 00:09:06.282, Speaker B: They're really zoomed in on this one metric, by the way, which is they sort of invented three months ago, which is Core X Shelter. So what they're basically trying to do is they're trying to see through some of the noisier more volatile components of CPI, which is Core, which excludes food and energy and then they know that there's this big lagging component which is shelter. So what they're really trying to see through to is wages. That's why labor markets and the unemployment rate has been in focus and that has started to turn. So the last CPI that came in really soft and I think that played a part in his kind of Dovish stance today.
00:09:06.416 - 00:09:34.414, Speaker C: And the other big piece of data that came in, I think it was Monday or Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday was ECI, which is the Employment Cost Index, which is kind of a basket of a number of different things, but it's sort of a proxy for wages. And that was expected, I think, last month was 1.2%. It was expected to be 1.1% this month, but it was actually 1.0%. And so that beat, I think, also helps with a little bit more of the Dovis perspective.
00:09:34.542 - 00:10:07.018, Speaker B: Do you guys just last I mean, we were talking about kind of joking, we're back, but what do you think when people are pinging you about low cap gems and Kanto or Kanto is like, ripping and honestly, even in stocks, like, Carvana is up like 100% in a week. Is that not something to worry about? And that's always going to kind of happen off the lows because those things got beat up and they were shorted? Or do you view that as like, being indicative of a slightly less organic rally?
00:10:07.114 - 00:10:53.134, Speaker D: It's just like part of the cycle, in my opinion. And you saw like a few of these during 2019 where Bitcoin rallied to I think it was like 14 or 15k in its old all time high back then. Was like, I think 18 or can kind of get these pretty vicious rallies. And as long as it's not in the absolute trash of the long tail, I haven't seen Doze or Shib really go off yet. That's the stuff that kind of concerns me. And I think you've also had a bigger rally in the higher quality names, which that's one of the things that we're looking for in terms of is this industry mature enough to allocate a lot more money to you need the market to kind of be more rational than it has been in the past. So I don't know.
00:10:53.134 - 00:11:14.494, Speaker D: Kanto is like a legitimate project in our minds and like, Synapse is doing well and Lido's doing well and a lot of the projects that Dubx is doing, polygon is doing well. Dogecoin isn't really moving it's up a little bit today, but not a lot. It feels pretty healthy.
00:11:14.542 - 00:11:38.742, Speaker C: I agree. I think it goes in waves, right? Once you get to the speculative wave, that's when it starts to be too speculative. But I think we're still on that first wave right now. And the way I think about it is sort of like two is a trend and three is a pattern. We're starting to put data points together where we can map one to two, but it takes one to two to three to be able to say, okay, this is a changing narrative. This is a changing of the guard.
00:11:38.806 - 00:11:51.978, Speaker D: A lot of it's PvP too, especially the Cosmos stuff, where it's just such low liquidity that you see people tweet about it and then it'll move and people are just kind of jockeying for exit liquidity or entry liquidity.
00:11:52.074 - 00:12:16.118, Speaker C: Well, and that's the thing. The liquidity right now is so low that it doesn't take much up or down from a buying or selling perspective to move these markets pretty drastically. I think that is probably the biggest narrative. If someone comes in and wants to buy $10,000 worth of something that's not traded on a centralized exchange and they're buying it through Uniswap or Sushi or somewhere one inch, that's going to move the market a lot.
00:12:16.284 - 00:12:21.740, Speaker A: All it takes is Hal coming on the Empire podcast to move dYdX 30% higher.
00:12:23.870 - 00:12:25.766, Speaker D: Not financial advice.
00:12:25.958 - 00:13:21.826, Speaker B: Pretty bullish review. Can we get a check in, guys, of what's going on on kind of like the private side of crypto? I know, Michael, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, but actually, Jason and I, this is on both of our minds because we had a bit of a doom stage call this morning with someone who sees basically a lot of kind of earlier to mid stage crypto companies. And he said there's still a decent amount of pain to get work through, both just in terms of valuation resets, but also just there are some crypto companies that are kind of burning a lot of cash and they're going to have trouble basically raising capital. Would love to get a sense from the two of you both, just in terms of how you're seeing, in terms of new deal flow coming into the space and valuations, but also maybe without talking any specifics about your portfolio companies just like, how are folks doing that? Raised in 2021, maybe on higher valuations. And how have they adjusted to sort of the new normal?
00:13:21.878 - 00:14:09.238, Speaker D: Takes a while to reset these valuations and private markets are kind of the last to reset. But you're now at a point where prices have corrected and pretty much doubled, and a lot of the venture stuff is a lot more attractive as a result. But they still need to reset the valuations that they're going to market at. I would say most of our companies have two years of runway, and so they're going to be needing to raise in 2025, like mid 2025. That would be my guess at least. But we know of a lot of portfolio companies, of other folks and just generally in the space that have six to eight months. And things like Aqua hires and selling companies for parts have definitely been conversations that we've had with a lot of folks.
00:14:09.238 - 00:14:49.350, Speaker D: Frankly, there isn't enough product traction with most of them to really do any interesting m A or Aqua hire style deals. So that's one part of it. I would say the other is the end of this year. You're going to see a lot of people kind of hit the wall in terms of their runway and they're going to need to raise. And if the market is where it is today, the market clearing price for a ton of startups coming to market is going to be a lot lower than it has been in the past couple of years. And entrepreneurs still kind of don't realize that. So we need them to kind of have the come to Jesus moment so they can actually get a fundraise, you.
00:14:49.420 - 00:15:59.662, Speaker C: Know, start of the year, fresh, new. Okay, what did we learn last year, but what's the plan for this year? Conversations kind of going around the horn with all the major portfolio companies that we have. The advice that we've been giving is assume that the end of 2023 looks exactly like we are like the place that we are in right now, which is essentially we might get 40% pump, 50% drop and things are going to move around. But just assume that you're going to end the year with a lot of the same basic metrics that we have right now, which is TVL user growth, activity on chain, potential customers. And so if you're going to start and to Vance's point, if we have two years of runway, it means that you have to start thinking about what your fundraise looks like in 18 months from now, if not a little bit sooner than that. Which means that from then, if you work backwards, what product, what service, what user base are you going after 18 months from now that you don't have right now? Because right now it's not working right now. The product market isn't there.
00:15:59.662 - 00:16:50.670, Speaker C: Like things that worked in 2021, 2022 aren't going to work in 23 and 24. So how do you change, how do you adjust, how do you reinvent to get to where you need to be so that you can survive? And that's a lot of the conversation piece right now that we're having. But I think it also stems from and one of the interesting perspectives that I think about is like, what is the fundraising landscape for other venture funds? And basically, therefore, what is the liquidity that's going to be available for these fundraises that need to happen in the second half of this year, first half of next year, or second half of next year? And it's not going to be good for any fund who has to raise a fund in 2023. In fact, it may even be like impossible to something that's painful.
00:16:52.530 - 00:16:56.960, Speaker D: There were times in 2019 where venture funds straight up could not raise, right?
00:16:57.890 - 00:17:54.866, Speaker C: Yeah, there are a lot of notable venture firms that could not raise their funds in 2019 and ended up pulling it off eventually over the course of 18 months in 2020. I think that's going to be a lot of what you see here. I think you're also going to see venture funds who maybe raise 500 for their last fund have to go through the process of raising 225 for their next fund. You've now seen Tiger who has set off to raise 13 originally and then they announced that they're going to downsize to six and now it's down to five. That is representative of what you're going to see from a venture fundraising landscape. Now the other part is we are inclusive of this set, but there are a number of venture funds who raised basically at the end of the cycle last year who still have a ton of dry powder. But the problem is the bar for accessing that dry powder is three, four, five times higher than it was twelve months ago.
00:17:54.866 - 00:18:10.220, Speaker C: And we are being extremely cautious in terms of how we make new bets. We want to take concerted large bets but the bar to get there is just that much higher and the valuations that are going to clear the market are going to be that much lower.
00:18:10.750 - 00:18:41.438, Speaker D: You know who else had to reduce their fundraising target and their strategy set? Chamath. So Chamath is now opening social capital back up to external LPs and he was going to raise, I think, like three or four and do like growth stage and hedge fund stuff. Now he's raising one for early stage stuff and he's having a first close in March, which kind of implies if you don't close everything at one point it means that the demand is softer than you might have been expecting.
00:18:41.534 - 00:18:45.310, Speaker B: It's just a tougher environment, I guess, for everyone. But yeah, especially for crypto.
00:18:45.470 - 00:18:52.280, Speaker A: The dynamics though, for a fund, if you miss the raise, are not as bad as when a founder or when a company can't make their raise because.
00:18:53.290 - 00:18:56.360, Speaker C: Unless I don't understand yes and no.
00:18:59.550 - 00:19:00.300, Speaker D: Yes.
00:19:00.910 - 00:19:56.890, Speaker C: If you are a venture investor right now who has a fund, who is out of dry powder, like no more capital to be able to spend, how do you stay relevant while people are also doing deals? You're just uncompetitive. And if you miss a cycle so let's say you miss a year of being able to make new investments, the best investments could be in that year. You don't have coverage over. I mean, the whole point of a venture fund is that you have vintages every funding cycle which could historically it's been two to three years. Over the last five years that's shortened probably to like twelve to 18 months, which is kind of crazy. Deployments have just been really quick but now you're probably going to see like three to four years for deployments. And if you're stuck in one of those mid cycles where you deployed your fund in 18 to 24 months but in fact you can't raise for 36 months, you're out of the game for a whole year and you lose brand appeal, you lose relevancy.
00:19:56.890 - 00:20:05.434, Speaker C: It's not a death nail blow, but it is something that just kind of removes the cachet that you once had if you're not able to make new investments.
00:20:05.562 - 00:20:30.360, Speaker B: So that answer is kind of like I'm sure it's like a really stupid question, but going through these cycles, it kind of just makes you think, like, why aren't there more funds that just stop investing or don't invest at the peak and then they wait and hold all their dry powder to now, right? Why don't they buy bottom? No, that's why I'm like, sure, it's a stupid question, but.
00:20:33.930 - 00:21:29.446, Speaker C: It'S obviously not that easy as saying it that way. But I think this is where the best fund managers are prescient in terms of fundraising cycles when getting things done, but also pacing and being really prudent about when you're deploying that capital and how much you're deploying at any given point in time. I'd also say in crypto we have a really unique opportunity to change the traditional venture strategy where like, hey, a venture fund can hold liquid assets and maybe those liquid assets could be used as things that you could recycle into further venture investments. And so you do get to have a little flexibility on your strategy, a little creativity. But I think that is tough when your venture fund is all SaaS and equity investments and you have no dry powder. It's a very different place to be in.
00:21:29.548 - 00:22:02.660, Speaker A: There's actually one more dynamic inside of venture firm that I don't fully understand how it works, that I want to understand it. So you guys raised, what, 400 million for the last fund? My understanding is you don't go get it's. Not like someone like it's like, all right, like March 1 we close the fund and then the next day, March 2, like 400 million shows up in your bank account. You have to call that capital. How does that process actually work? Are you at some point this month going to call your LPs and be like, hey, Joe, I've got a good deal that we're looking at. Can you send us the money? How does this work?
00:22:05.750 - 00:22:40.000, Speaker D: Before I answer that question, there's like two jobs if you run a venture firm. Number one is you have to be like a really good investor. Number two is you have to be a good fund manager. Very different jobs being a good fund manager. When do you raise? Who do you raise from? How do you basically communicate LPs, get your brand out there, run the fund? In the operational sense, investing is like, how do you put the money to work when you raise money for a venture firm? We raised 400. We did one close, we closed it all and we've been calling it over time. Usually you'll call a chunk up front and then you'll call like 10% every few months after that.
00:22:40.000 - 00:23:02.886, Speaker D: But to Michael's point, if you want to hold liquid assets and you want to do something aggressive near the bottom, you have to call a lot more of that. And you have to run kind of like this quasi VC hedge fund style strategy. And that's something that VCLPs are generally not used to. And so that's the other part of being a fund manager. It's like, how do you communicate your.
00:23:02.908 - 00:23:13.018, Speaker A: Strategy to folks, getting them comfortable with that? And that's what you guys are doing right now. I know you guys are taking big shots because you think that we're somewhere near the bottom, so you're having to make those calls right now.
00:23:13.184 - 00:23:50.010, Speaker D: We did make those calls, and we're not kind of being as aggressive right now, but when we thought there was really good, cheap opportunities, we did. But it's an educational journey for everyone. It's not exactly as straightforward as we're going to invest in 15 equity based companies and we're going to make seven of them work and three of them will fail. There's a reason why we're talking about interest rates and what the Fed is doing and all that. Like, this is not necessarily what Michael and I signed up for, but this is kind of what you have to do. You can't sacrifice the fund for the sake of the mandate.
00:23:50.110 - 00:24:30.562, Speaker C: You still have to have a venture thesis. And basically what that means is you have to be able to underwrite, even if it is a liquid investment, a venture outcome potential for that investment. You can't be like, oh, I think this is going to pop 20%, or like, oh, I'm just going to go yield farm with a bunch of cash. It's not really anything that you can put into a venture fund. There are other types of funds that have those different types of strategies. So your LP base is expecting you to make venture investments, and that's what we do. But the way that you do that from the start and the way that your portfolio is constructed at the end in crypto, historically, every single one of those profiles has been different.
00:24:30.562 - 00:24:54.618, Speaker C: What you started out saying, hey, we're going to put this capital into 60 to 70 companies over the course of 18 months to 24 months, it's like, no, okay, everything just blew up. So there's really attractive liquid buys that we think are going to be high potential opportunities for us. Like, we're changing the strategy three months into the fund and that's okay. But you have to have an LP base that's supportive of that.
00:24:54.704 - 00:25:03.200, Speaker A: Why does it work that way? Like, when a company raises money, if we raise $400 million, that money just gets sent. It's not like we just like, hey, we want to do a big ad spend.
00:25:03.650 - 00:25:38.780, Speaker C: The reason why historically is, well, it's twofold. One, LPs have multiple areas that they're putting capital in. It could be launchword equity hedge fund. It could be a distressed debt fund. It could be venture capital, it could be crypto, who knows? But the point is they need to manage their obligations to other managers, but also potentially to whoever they are. If it's an endowment, they're funding the operating budget for the school. If it's a foundation, they have the same sort of mandate as well.
00:25:38.780 - 00:26:50.142, Speaker C: And so there's a lot of moving pieces on the LP side. But the other reason why capital calls have historically been the model for how you actually run a fund like ours, a closed ended fund is it actually is a model where you can juice IRR. And this doesn't really happen for the venture capital firms because really what people care about at the end of the day from a venture firm perspective is what's your DPI, which is dollars distributed per invested dollar. And that's all net of fees and it's just like dollar per dollar. How much did you get back over what time horizon? It's usually ten years. But when you're a private equity firm and you're benchmarking to, let's say, the equity markets of like six, seven, 8%, you've got a hurdle of six to seven to 8% and you only get performance fees on top of that hurdle. And so if you're able to say over the course of two and a half, three years, I'm only going to call capital when I make one of my five to six investments for this fund, and we're talking like buyout private equity firms that actually can add a percent or two to what your total IRR is for the fund.
00:26:50.142 - 00:27:06.866, Speaker C: Just because you don't actually start calling the internal rate of return on that capital until you call it. So that's kind of the other reason why capital calls have been a construct of the fund structure. But once again, for Venture, it's not really the main driver of success, like.
00:27:06.888 - 00:27:38.400, Speaker A: A crypto venture landscape. Question for you guys. I don't know how much you can share here, but in my mind there's, like, a group of tier one crypto venture firms like Electric and Paradigm and Polychain and Throw Framework in there and Parify and thanks kind of you, I'm sure. I'm leaving out some, but there's, like, a tier one group of crypto venture firms that's, in my mind. But when you actually look at the returns of these firms, are they drastically different?
00:27:38.850 - 00:27:43.358, Speaker D: Yes, we can't talk about our returns, but yes.
00:27:43.444 - 00:27:50.082, Speaker A: Okay, well framework okay, then take framework out of it. But when you compare those firms, how different are they?
00:27:50.216 - 00:28:11.174, Speaker D: Very different. There's people who've hit Grand Slam home runs and there's people who are kind of like 0.5 X to one X. The dispersion is massive. Some of it is what your thesis is, some of it is what you've invested in. A lot of it is frankly, timing. And that doesn't sound like the most fair thing in the world.
00:28:11.174 - 00:28:30.138, Speaker D: But to Michael's point, if you miss a. Cycle if you don't have capital to buy at the bottom you're going to show up to LPs with a bunch of illiquid stuff in terms of private startup equity that doesn't necessarily have markups or product market fit and oftentimes that's what determines the survival of a lot of firms.
00:28:30.314 - 00:29:54.634, Speaker C: I would also say every single one of those firms, I think every single one of those firms that you just listed was started in essentially the last three to three and a half years. So historically from a venture capital perspective we're like in the first to second fund cycle for each one of those firms right now you can't even really say what are the returns, you can have initial marks and maybe some of them have initial distributions. But the way that this works over the next five to ten years is you're actually going to have the stratosphere separate and figure out who's really good and who's good and who's not good and that will be sort of the longevity which is based around the strategy but most importantly it's based around the people. And right now, the biggest indication of success is like, who are the GPS, who are the ones that are calling the shots? Who are the ones that are making the investments and the younger people at the firms too, who are making investments and rising the ranks? And what's your bench look like and what is the next crop of people who are up and coming GPS? And the reason why you think of those firms as being successful firms is largely because of probably the personalities or just like public presence of those people. But that is not an indication of them being long term successful venture investors. And I think it'll take five years, five more years.
00:29:54.672 - 00:30:02.650, Speaker A: I guess really the only venture firms that have a track record are the ones who started in 2013, like the Panteras blockchain capital.
00:30:02.990 - 00:30:05.322, Speaker B: But even them dude, look how many.
00:30:05.376 - 00:30:10.046, Speaker A: Exit how many well, Pantera has been around for a long time.
00:30:10.148 - 00:30:18.180, Speaker C: Pantera started with a blockchain or sorry, a bitcoin only fund in 2013. Their first venture fund I think was like three years ago.
00:30:19.270 - 00:30:21.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess there really aren't many firms.
00:30:21.646 - 00:31:19.462, Speaker D: The other thing is our first fund was 15 million. We only had one outside LP at that time, multicoin I think their first venture fund was 17. You can put numbers up on that type of capital because a you're riding a wave b you have a very small fund size but as you grow your fund size it gets harder to do that and it's a function of how the industry is evolving in and what's investable but also how big your fund size is. And so I think what you're going to see to the point of Tiger and them raising less like Han Ventures has one and a half billion, andreessen has four and a half, Paradigm has two and a half. They're going to really need to put up numbers or else it's going to be a little bit different of a conversation the next time that they go to market. And I think that's going to be where the rubber meets the road in a lot of this stuff in terms of determining who's good. And maybe the answer is the most you can put to work is like 400 or 500 million.
00:31:19.462 - 00:31:23.718, Speaker D: That's as much as we felt comfortable raising and being able to really succeed with it.
00:31:23.884 - 00:32:34.350, Speaker C: But also keep in mind here, this is a byproduct of the size of the rounds and the valuations that people are raising at. So when we started in 2019, we're talking about seed deals that were getting done at like sub $10 million or like seed Series A that are getting done at 30 to 40. We weren't really able to participate because of the size of it in the Uniswap Series A or the Compound Series A, but the people that were, were andreessian because they had 350,000,000. And so you kind of think about it in terms of like, your fund size gets you access into whatever deals are happening at that point in time. But if you've got one and a half billion or four and a half billion, what are the deals that you're able to get into now that you wouldn't be able to get into now? But think about that with the context of you have to get to your ownership percentage for you to have any hope of returning any sort of multiple on this fund. And so I think it's going to be really interesting to see what happens to the fund sizes because that'll dictate a lot of what the LP landscape is. But also just like what's available from new investment perspective.
00:32:35.010 - 00:32:52.626, Speaker D: We have really good evidence both from Paradigm and the andreessen funds, that you can kill it. And I think Paradigm was 300 as well. You can kill it with that fund size. We don't have a lot of evidence that over a billion, you can really put numbers up. And I think that's what LPs are looking for sometimes.
00:32:52.728 - 00:33:21.834, Speaker B: And if you guys can't this is tricky to comment on, that's fine, but every once in a while I'll see this kind of like it's like a party round or something where it's like a huge raise with a bunch of big names. And I always look at that. I'm like I just don't think that makes any sense because the valuation is way off, but everyone is in it as much as you guys can. Is that kind of a known thing or like a dynamic that you just have to be in this round or it's helpful from a VC brand perspective to be in those sorts of rounds.
00:33:21.882 - 00:34:01.320, Speaker C: It is 100% a dynamic that we a rarely participate in, if ever, and B highly advise any of our portfolio companies or potential portfolio companies away from that strategy. Because ultimately what happens is if you don't have a lead taking half to two thirds of around, you have a tragedy of the commons type situation where it's sort of like, hey, is this your investment? Do we have to do work or are you doing who's the one who's doing the work after the investment is done to actually make sure that this investment and this company and this protocol is going to be successful? And we've seen it time and time again where it's just like, who's on first?
00:34:02.730 - 00:34:18.378, Speaker D: Why you do these party rounds is not for the financial return most of the time. It's so that you have a logo that you can put on your website and you can use that logo on your website to get on CNBC or introductions to LPs, or hang out with Tom Brady, or hang out with TV.
00:34:18.474 - 00:35:05.174, Speaker C: The two data points, and this actually doesn't come from us. It comes from a few of our LPs who've been in the venture investing industry for the last couple of decades. Is the two barometers of success for a venture firm over the long horizon are fund size and fund size consistently. So like benchmark raises 400 to 450 every single fund cycle. So that's number one. And number two, what's the average ownership percentage for each of the investments that they're making? And those are kind of the two North Stars that we think about, which is like, what's the most optimal fund size for this next funding landscape, this next two years? And then we're just maniacally focused on every investment being high ownership.
00:35:05.222 - 00:35:25.970, Speaker B: I've got one more question, then I want to move on to talk about ordinals because I think that would be a fun thing to get your guys perspectives on. But what is the one thing if you're a founder, what's, like the one most important question you should be asking your VC or what's? Like the thing that founders should be asking that you feel like they rarely do when they're raising?
00:35:26.470 - 00:36:00.606, Speaker D: Probably fund structure. A lot of people got burned because they had hedge funds investing in these early token rounds and like, yeah, we're going to hold it and then it's like a totally different story once shit hits. And who's the partner you're working? Like you get Michael or I at Framework or both of us in a lot of cases, but a lot of it is kind of like the franchisee model where the main partner wins the deal and then it's like some junior guy who takes over. That's not really what you want either.
00:36:00.708 - 00:36:53.374, Speaker C: And granted we have people who are more junior on the team that are stepping up now to own deals, but historically it has been either us or someone that is soup to nuts the person who did the deal. And that I think is a really important component. The other component that I would say frankly, is just like, what proof points of success do you guys have post investment? So the way that we like to work is as soon as we make an investment, all right, let's set up a regular recurring thing. Is it biweekly monthly every five, six weeks? Doesn't really matter, but that's sort of like office hours with us. And if there's nothing to talk about, great, cancel it. We don't need to talk about anything. If you want to talk recruiting, next fundraise, product, strategy, whatever it is, let's sit in a room and discuss everything.
00:36:53.374 - 00:37:17.206, Speaker C: And I think that, surprisingly, that model doesn't seem to traverse across funds, and you kind of have people showing up to board meetings every three months being like, okay, great. What are you guys doing this year? What's your biggest goals, and what are the KPIs that you want to hit by the end of the year? It's like, we've had three meetings in between now and then, and we're totally engrossed in what the product is and who you're selling it to.
00:37:17.388 - 00:37:22.070, Speaker D: Every day on Telegram, we talk to people just like, that's our job. I don't understand the board of meeting.
00:37:22.490 - 00:37:56.180, Speaker A: Aunt Andreessen popularized the model of they built a lot of the functionality in house, so they built in house sales experts, they built in house marketing experts, in house recruiting experts, and I think a lot of funds do that now, and they were the ones to popularize that. What is the crypto model of who are the experts that you need to bring in house? I'm sure there's obviously the sales and the marketing and the hiring and stuff like that, but do you have governance people who, when you invest in a protocol, the protocol can talk to your governance team? Is there an equivalent there?
00:37:57.690 - 00:38:32.186, Speaker D: I think in crypto it's a lot different because nobody really has the expertise to be super helpful for these startups and where these operational teams that you can parachute into companies really work, in my opinion, are like, private equity companies. Okay. You need to turn, like, a plastics manufacturer around. Let's hire a plastics team that ran an old factory, and we'll put them in there's a playbook. Okay, great. With startups and especially very esoteric startups, most of the people that we talk to want playbooks. Have you guys seen this before? What was that like? They want help hiring.
00:38:32.186 - 00:38:54.902, Speaker D: You need a deep network in crypto to know who's actually good. Like, you certainly don't want to hire a bunch of web two people and throw them in a company. And then the last thing is just like founder therapy, and you don't want someone junior doing that, or you don't want someone who doesn't have real skin in the game doing that, because a lot of it right now is like, all right, do you have all your fingers and toes? How do we make you survive for another two years? Like okay.
00:38:54.956 - 00:38:55.126, Speaker B: Yes.
00:38:55.148 - 00:39:09.110, Speaker D: You don't have any product market fit. Let's pivot the company. You can't really give that advice unless you're just like a crypto lifer. There really is not that many people that can actually do that job. And I don't think hiring a big platform team is really helpful.
00:39:09.190 - 00:39:52.966, Speaker C: The other thing that I would say is there are a lot of technical services that really help bootstrap growth and engagement. So like running nodes and being initial validator if you have the capabilities. Framework has this concept internally called Framework Labs, and we've got a number of people at Framework Labs that focus on running infrastructure. And sometimes it means we're testing out new trading models that one of our portfolio company is building. Or maybe it means we want to be in the initial validator set of the testnet for the protocol that's launching and we want to give feedback. That type of stuff really helps. We're one of the largest chainlink node operators.
00:39:52.966 - 00:40:08.606, Speaker C: We're one of the largest graph node operators to this day. I think that is a differentiation that most traditional venture firms don't have. I'd say crypto natives kind of get that, but it doesn't scale to every investment, it doesn't scale to every protocol. But it is an added benefit for.
00:40:08.628 - 00:40:30.446, Speaker B: A lot with the caveat that Blockworks isn't obviously a protocol. The founder therapy thing resonated, definitely. And then also people told this to Jason and I in the beginning of Blockworks and we didn't listen. And I really wish we had. Bringing on an HR recruiting person, like way earlier would have saved so much time and headache.
00:40:30.478 - 00:40:31.620, Speaker A: Should have done it three years.
00:40:32.310 - 00:40:54.510, Speaker D: Like with the platform stuff, you kind of want all those people in house. Yeah, oh, we're going to send over our marketing guy and he comes down and sits with you and he's like, all right, so what are you guys doing? Where do you even start at that point? You have to have those people in house. I'm kind of bearish on the platform model. We're going to build this talent agency and farm everyone out. It just doesn't really work.
00:40:54.580 - 00:40:59.534, Speaker C: Also, it's feasible when you can make 3% off of four and a half billion every year.
00:40:59.572 - 00:41:16.530, Speaker D: And LPs love it because it's like LPs like to know that everything is being taken care of. A lot of situations, you can't make that happen, but if you're like, yep, if they need help with marketing, we got this person, we got this person for HR, we got that person for compliance, but it doesn't actually help that much.
00:41:16.600 - 00:41:53.934, Speaker B: One other one actually, that could be I have a budy who works for a private equity fund and they use this thing. It's kind of it's I forget it's entrepreneur something, but it's basically a basic business planning, goal setting sort of framework for companies. And I say that because Blockworks is retooling ours internally just about how you set goals, how those goals all kind of roll up into each other. And a good reporting structure is, again, not the kind of thing that you might think of when you're an entrepreneur, like in the trenches trying to drag in revenue or improve your metrics. But it's a super important thing as you get slightly larger.
00:41:53.982 - 00:42:40.894, Speaker C: Totally, but on the more kind of soft skills side of things. So the Platform team that we have, and we do have someone on our team who runs Platform, which is maintaining relationships with audit firms, maintaining relationships with recruiting firms, maintaining relationships with any sort of firm that any of our portfolio companies could use. But one of the things that we found at least is if you provide someone with a framework for how to run their company, as soon as they take an investment from Framework Ventures, it's sort of like do it our way and our way is the only way you can't do that. It takes time where you're sitting with the team every other week or every month and you're like, what's going on? Okay, that's interesting. Let's talk about like that type of interaction I think is vastly more important.
00:42:41.012 - 00:42:49.730, Speaker B: Yeah. Have you seen that? It's like kind of a joke, but that OKRs were a Psyop from Google to fuck up everyone else's planning.
00:42:51.350 - 00:43:09.606, Speaker D: Most of that stuff are like medium articles that you can read and be like, got it. OKRs not that difficult to implement. You don't need like a Six Sigma guru coming into your company and being like, we're going to whip this thing into shape. That doesn't help. Entrepreneurs need to figure it out themselves. Yeah, you're right.
00:43:09.788 - 00:44:01.698, Speaker B: Guys, I do want to talk about Bitcoin Ordinals because it's kind of funny, but I also think it's frankly kind of interesting. So just to set the scene. So Bitcoin ordinals it's an NFT project that is on Bitcoin by this guy Casey Rordemore. Basically the TLDR is that there was a big upgrade to Bitcoin that was made a little while ago called Taproot, and it relaxed some of the limitations around a very specific type of data called witness data. And basically what this guy Casey figured out was that you could actually, within the witness data part of each Bitcoin block, you could actually make NFTs based on how SATS are configured. It's a very clever, pretty elegant construction, actually. So you can kind of think of it like there was a guy, Dennis Porto or something that did a really good write up of this and we'll link it in the show notes.
00:44:01.698 - 00:44:49.730, Speaker B: But if you almost think about it from the concept of like, hey, I bought a bunch of coinbase stock over the course of a year and then I sell one, it's almost like a weird accounting thing. Do you do first in, first out, or last in, first out? But it's the arrangement of those different pieces and that's what kind of the NFT is in terms of how the stats are arranged. It's a cool kind of construction. The output of this, though, is that that data is posted to the bitcoin blockchain in a heavily subsidized way. It's like ten times cheaper to post that NFT data than other types of data. And it reignited this big debate that had gone on in bitcoin a long time ago. Starting back in, I think, 2010 or 2013 with I think there was a project called DNS Domains where people wanted to store domain data on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:44:49.730 - 00:45:45.080, Speaker B: And it kind of gave rise to these two camps of is bitcoin a general data storage type platform, or should it only be used for financial transactions? And this debate never really got solved, but there was kind of like an uneasy compromise, which is this thing called op. I'm blanking on that. But there's basically a function where it limits the amount of non financial data that you can post to a bitcoin block, and it's prunable, which means that not all the nodes need to download it. So it's kind of this, like, compromise and Casey's project ordinals circumvents that. So this kind of mixed the reaction on Twitter has been sort of negative by some of the more bitcoin fundamentalists, you might say. Like Adam Back, who's a fundamentalist nice pivot away from maximalists or whatever the maxis. Yeah.
00:45:45.790 - 00:45:50.746, Speaker A: Mike, I heard you talking about this, and Vance is looking at his second screen. Loading up on these ordinals right now.
00:45:50.848 - 00:45:52.334, Speaker B: Yeah, loading up, yeah.
00:45:52.452 - 00:45:53.440, Speaker D: Kind of cool.
00:45:53.890 - 00:46:13.506, Speaker B: I think it's kind of cool, yeah. And basically Adam suggested, hey, maybe the miners should censor the crap out of these to disincentivize this sort of data from getting posted. And obviously there's got an enormous amount of pushback on Twitter, but I'd be curious what both of your guys takes on this is I don't know if.
00:46:13.528 - 00:46:35.098, Speaker D: Either of us are deep enough in bitcoin land to really make a judgment call here. I was actually looking at if Nick Carter or Jack Mueller should put out a statement yet. Doesn't look like anything has been put out. But I would buy one of these. I see there's bitcoin rocks, and I think that's interesting. I kind of want to own a piece of history whenever it's possible, but.
00:46:35.264 - 00:46:45.006, Speaker C: Can you buy it? But you're like, posting the NFT to the blockchain is my understanding of it.
00:46:45.108 - 00:46:55.278, Speaker D: However I can get it, I want to get it. That's my thought process. But I don't know. I don't know why these people are so angry about everything. They're making cool stuff and you're just.
00:46:55.284 - 00:47:29.482, Speaker A: Like, that is a response that Vance gives when the market is up 40%. I want to buy one. I don't know why everyone's so angry about everything. Why can't we all just get along? No, but I think it does bring up mike, you've been following this closer than I have, but it sounds like there's a core group of bitcoiners who are like, hey, this shouldn't clog up the Bitcoin blockchain, we shouldn't clog up Bitcoin with these pictures and these NFTs and things like that. But then if you don't clog it with these pictures, what you're essentially doing is you're censoring some part of the Bitcoin blockchain which is very against another one of their arguments. Do I understand it correctly there?
00:47:29.536 - 00:48:25.642, Speaker B: So here's the debate that I actually think is kind of interesting, which is this season of the interview. Part of Bell Curve is like app chains and specifically like app dedicated block, right? So like, forget the chain construction or whatever, but let's say you want to have block space that's dedicated to one specific application, but you also want it to be open and permissionless. That's actually weirdly contradictory because let's say you start a chain and it's like, hey, we're an AMM or a Dex, but it's permissionless. So you get contributors that want to build stuff that isn't AMM or Dexi on the chain. How do you keep those applications off of your weird? And I actually think that's what Bitcoin is kind of going through here because they are the original app chain. It's the money app chain. And a part of that community has been like, we don't want other stuff on this chain, we want to save this block space for financial related transactions.
00:48:25.642 - 00:48:33.940, Speaker B: And how do you actually enforce and do that permissioning around app specific block space? I think that's at least where my mind went.
00:48:34.790 - 00:49:16.446, Speaker D: We've seen a few chains design themselves, so specifically that for instance, like Immutable X, you can't transfer ERC twenty S, you can't do anything. It's basically only for NFT swaps and that's kind of like what the chain is for. It's not like a general permissionless l one, as you might imagine it, but they're very specific in their use case. But I don't know, it kind of seems like counterproductive to be permissionless, but also censor the apps that you want on the chain. And frankly, this is generating more fees for Bitcoin than Bitcoin's generated in a long time. So I guess it would be kind of tragic to see Bitcoin turn into our weave. But I don't know what the other sustainable economic model it has is.
00:49:16.548 - 00:50:05.600, Speaker C: My general rate of this, especially the pushback is there's someone trying to do something and then everybody else is throwing up on it. There needs to be sort of a central rallying point as to what the future of Bitcoin is. And it's kind of like what we've been talking about over the last couple of months with what is Bitcoin versus every other asset and blockchain that's out there. What you're talking about, Mike, is an application specific set of block space, but that's defined and also agreed upon as to what that app is doing and what this block space is for. When you have everybody fighting over this space, it's like literally fighting over land or like real estate. It's like, no, this is mine. And then everybody else is like, no, this is not mine, then not in my backyard starts to take over.
00:50:05.600 - 00:50:43.514, Speaker C: I think there just has to be a central rallying point. Like is bitcoin for transferring value digital gold? Is it for payments or digital gold? Or is it for applications that could be built on top of it? Like ordinals I think one of my predictions from 2022, leading in 2023 was that there would start to be a conversation around what the future of bitcoin actually is. And I think at least this is the start of the process of people having more of a conversation about it.
00:50:43.632 - 00:51:38.358, Speaker D: The one unique take that I have on bitcoin is that the mining landscape is going to be really interesting over the next couple of years. So Core Scientific, the largest North American miner of any bitcoin in bankruptcy currently, Argo looks like it's going to go into bankruptcy. They got some sort of emergency loan facility, but it doesn't look like they're going to be kept along for too long. Greenhill going into bankruptcy as like, you have most of the bitcoins that are produced in North America in some sort of estate conceivership that is willing to get out of. And like, you're probably going to have someone roll up all of these different mining operations that went bankrupt and have a lot of power over where crypto and bitcoin goes. And I don't think it's going to be a fundamentalist it's going to be like Apollo who doesn't give a fuck about Ordinals, or Luke Dash Jr. Or Taproot.
00:51:38.358 - 00:51:44.400, Speaker D: They're just trying to make money and they're trying to make it economically viable. So it's going to be interesting to.
00:51:45.650 - 00:52:28.220, Speaker B: A there was a metaphor because everyone admitted very quickly they can't do anything about this, even though there are a lot of people that were unhappy, there's nothing that can be done. And someone made an analogy. I actually think it might have been Rune Christensen on a podcast like years ago, but he made this analogy. When you're shipping software, it's like move fast and break things because you can iterate it really quickly and ship codes and fixes very quickly. But if you're shipping hardware, you don't have that option. You have to be very careful because the expense of a product recall is really intense and shipping blockchain code is very similar, right? Because unless if you're truly decentralized, you can't take that back. So this was kind of an interesting example of that dynamic also coming back.
00:52:28.830 - 00:52:59.138, Speaker D: We've looked at a lot of these bankrupt mining businesses and been like, man, at the right price, can we get there? Is this interesting? Do we want to get into bitcoin mining? And the reality is it's so expensive, it's hardware intensive. You're basically beholden to the having schedule which says next year you're going to have half the revenue you had this year. So you'd better have that price double. It's just a really tough business, and the people who are still alive are only the best run miners. It's pretty wild.
00:52:59.234 - 00:53:22.862, Speaker B: I don't know that much about gold miners or, frankly, cloud storage business, but those are similar business. They just seemed like it'd be really tough. And why would you really want to compete on like it just sucks to be in a business where your competitive edge is like, how many pennies can you save on your margin? That's just not a fun environment to work in.
00:53:22.916 - 00:53:33.258, Speaker C: I mean, that's infrastructure for you. Like, everything water, electricity, everything. It's like, how fine of a margin can you eke out a profit?
00:53:33.354 - 00:54:01.282, Speaker D: And it's like, you look at the investor decks of when these things went bankrupt or their first day bankruptcy presentations, and it's like schematics of the plants or the warehouses that they have these miners in in North Carolina, and they're like, yeah, we're thinking about adding another wing to add more miners. It's just like, wow, I'm just going to buy ETH and stake it and get the yield from that. And I guess if we want more, we're just going to lever that up. But building more mining facilities not what Michael or I really want to do with our it's.
00:54:01.346 - 00:54:37.730, Speaker A: I have a budy who's VP of Strategy or head of Strategy or head of Ops or something like that at Grid, if you guys know. So operationally intense. I have so much respect for them, honestly. He's literally like hard hat building at these sites, building construction super complex, like Excel calculations, trying to figure out the debt facilities as well. Like hundreds of millions of dollars debt lines. I have a lot of respect for folks building on the bitcoin miner side of things. It's a very complex operation.
00:54:38.330 - 00:54:39.766, Speaker B: I never have to people are just.
00:54:39.788 - 00:54:54.780, Speaker D: Swapping in curve pools and staking it at some .1 of these businesses is just too hard relative to the other to just be kept alive. How much is your electricity bill on staking your ETH? Like a few bucks a.
00:54:56.910 - 00:55:09.200, Speaker B: Just I think any business where you have to wear a hard hat in a professional capacity is not a business that I want to I'm not a hard hat guy, lunch fail guy.
00:55:11.330 - 00:55:13.230, Speaker A: Mike doesn't even go outside when it's.
00:55:15.010 - 00:55:28.500, Speaker B: Let'S let's close on a fun maybe it's a fun one. I don't know. Did you guys just see Charlie Munger wrote an op ed in the Wall Street Journal, which is the United States should ban crypto. Did anyone see this?
00:55:29.990 - 00:55:55.366, Speaker D: Like, Charlie Munger is just, like, kind of a clown in my like, they made a lot of their money backing companies like Coca Cola, fueling things like the obesity epidemic in the like, I kind of understand the point of gambling bad, but you guys have been selling trash to US. Consumers for decades, and I don't see any repercussions that you've had. So. I don't really pay attention to them.
00:55:55.488 - 00:56:23.400, Speaker C: The other thing that came out this morning and know don't know whether or not it's going to go through, probably not, but Nikki Haley came out with a cognitive test requirement for Congresspeople or people in politics that are over a certain age. Obviously we can't do that for private business. But interesting dichotomy of the two perspectives happening within a day of each.
00:56:24.890 - 00:56:30.058, Speaker A: Obviously that's obviously her taking a massive jab at Biden, but I don't think.
00:56:30.064 - 00:56:35.500, Speaker B: It'S the that's a queen move. I love that. That's awesome.
00:56:36.350 - 00:56:40.502, Speaker A: I think it's pretty funny. Politicians are too old.
00:56:40.576 - 00:56:47.770, Speaker D: On that note, we've only got like 18 months of the current administration left. It's pretty wild.
00:56:47.850 - 00:56:50.254, Speaker A: Blew by you know who actually everyone.
00:56:50.292 - 00:56:52.190, Speaker D: Was bullish on gary Gensler.
00:56:53.830 - 00:56:56.046, Speaker A: This guy taught a blockchain class at MIT.
00:56:56.158 - 00:56:56.594, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:56:56.632 - 00:56:56.994, Speaker A: We're good.
00:56:57.032 - 00:56:57.890, Speaker D: Don't worry.
00:57:01.190 - 00:57:08.422, Speaker C: Okay, so this is my Black Swan perspective. I still think we haven't heard the last of him in 2023.
00:57:08.556 - 00:57:09.302, Speaker D: For sure not.
00:57:09.356 - 00:57:10.680, Speaker A: Well, the year just started.
00:57:16.090 - 00:57:18.920, Speaker C: There's a lot of hearing of him in 2022.
00:57:19.690 - 00:57:21.898, Speaker A: I'm just talking with you. I agree with that. I agree.
00:57:21.984 - 00:57:50.260, Speaker D: But it's possible we get like you think about the bullish catalyst next two years. As stupid as I think it is, the bitcoin happening, that's one. We got a lot of good stuff on the east side, the app side, probably the legislative side. But if we get regime change, good Lord. In a good direction, if DeSantis is there, if Nikki Haley's there, even if Gavin Newsom's there. Gavin Newsom is a crypto guy. He blocked that bill that was going to kill all the crypto companies in.
00:57:52.630 - 00:58:10.630, Speaker C: Gavin Newsom is pro business and pro innovation. His perspective is just like, listen, we shouldn't cut opportunities off unless we fully understand it. We should protect people from them if they need protecting. But these are enterprising opportunities.
00:58:10.970 - 00:58:11.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:11.388 - 00:58:30.080, Speaker D: There's a great video of him explaining to I think it was the California Senate, the state Senate of why nuclear is good and why there would be blackouts if they didn't have this power plant. And it was just like two ships passing in the night, but at least he was out there just giving them hell.
00:58:31.410 - 00:58:51.960, Speaker C: Question for everybody. What, as it currently stands, is your base case for who is running not necessarily who wins, but who is running from the Democratic and the Democrat and Republican sides. Oh, boy. We're eleven months out from an election year.
00:58:56.090 - 00:58:58.086, Speaker D: Wow, that's wild. Yeah.
00:58:58.268 - 00:59:00.150, Speaker A: Nikki, haley, DeSantis.
00:59:01.050 - 00:59:04.194, Speaker C: Nikki, haley, DeSantis, trump are the two.
00:59:04.332 - 00:59:20.830, Speaker A: Those are the three republicans. Yeah. For the dems. I don't know. Buttigieg biden newsom. Kamala those are probably the yeah.
00:59:20.900 - 00:59:23.840, Speaker C: Generally I'd say Biden is probably going to take the Dem side.
00:59:24.450 - 00:59:26.186, Speaker D: I think it's going to be Newsom.
00:59:26.298 - 00:59:27.954, Speaker A: Oh, Stacey Abrams could run.
00:59:28.072 - 00:59:31.620, Speaker D: I think it's going to be Newsom, Trump and I think Newsom is going to win.
00:59:32.070 - 00:59:33.780, Speaker A: Do you think it'll be Newsom, Trump.
00:59:34.310 - 00:59:37.910, Speaker D: Look at the guy. He's just like a good looking guy. Slick.
00:59:38.250 - 00:59:39.062, Speaker A: Look at the guy.
00:59:39.116 - 00:59:39.734, Speaker B: Look at the guy.
00:59:39.772 - 00:59:41.446, Speaker A: He's a good guy. Look at him.
00:59:41.548 - 00:59:42.440, Speaker B: Look at him.
00:59:43.850 - 01:00:16.578, Speaker D: Peter Thiel gave this talk recently, which is like, there's two ideologies in America that can scale across the nation and unite everybody and win the presidency. One is like the Manhattan Complex. Like the Hillary Clinton complex. The Bill Clinton complex. We're New Yorkers, like, you do what we say and we're those type of people. The other is like the California ideology of Gavin Newsom kind of know, like the growth, the technology, that perspective. And then now there's kind of like the Florida ideology of anti woke and anti ESG and all that stuff.
01:00:16.578 - 01:00:21.106, Speaker D: So it'll be one of those three ideologies. But Gavin's by far the slickest, in.
01:00:21.128 - 01:00:27.158, Speaker B: My opinion, Belaji thinks bitcoin is an ideology. I don't know if you guys heard him talk about this.
01:00:27.244 - 01:00:30.166, Speaker D: Yeah. Is he seasteading or how is he doing?
01:00:30.348 - 01:00:43.590, Speaker A: ODS. Here are the ODS right now. DeSantis Biden trump Kamala nikki Haley gavin Newsom michelle Obama pete Buttigieg That's what the markets have it as we weren't.
01:00:43.670 - 01:00:45.750, Speaker C: Too far off in our top picks.
01:00:45.910 - 01:01:00.000, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't think I think you could see DeSantis fade down the stretch, kind of like Jeb Bush style. But someone's been listening to Sleepy Jen. No, I stopped listening to all can't. I can't get into it. I don't know.
01:01:01.810 - 01:01:07.200, Speaker B: It's the front runner thing, right, for DeSantis. But who knows? I don't know.
01:01:07.650 - 01:01:08.970, Speaker A: Good place to wrap.
01:01:09.130 - 01:01:09.838, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:10.004 - 01:01:11.178, Speaker D: All right, boys.
01:01:11.354 - 01:01:12.622, Speaker B: Fellas, this was fun.
01:01:12.676 - 01:01:13.370, Speaker A: Good pod.
01:01:13.530 - 01:01:14.062, Speaker B: All right.
