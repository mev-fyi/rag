00:00:41.050 - 00:00:54.080, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. Today we got some new faces, we got Miles, who's been on the show before, of course. Welcome back, Miles. We've got two of our senior analysts, dan Smith and Samart Fells. Welcome.
00:00:54.450 - 00:00:56.640, Speaker C: Appreciate it, happy to be the B team today.
00:00:57.650 - 00:00:58.670, Speaker D: Likewise.
00:01:01.010 - 00:01:28.150, Speaker B: Yeah, fellas, this is going to be a good one. We shed the dead weight and we got the All Stars here, so this is going to be a fun one. It's been a spicy week, actually. We got a lot of good content and maybe it makes the most sense to start with Lido because that made quite a bit of waves. So there was a forum post that appeared earlier this week. The title of the post is introducing LDO Staking. TLDR is to introduce an LDO Staking module buyback program.
00:01:28.150 - 00:02:23.260, Speaker B: It allows token holders to stake lido in exchange for a proportion of Lido Dao revenue via an LDO buyback and distribute program. The idea is that this is going to increase LDO utility and having stakers basically serve as sort of a insurance fund of last resort against some sort of slashing event. I guess the caveat before we get too far into this is just to say it seems like at this moment in time that this was probably proposed by a couple of trading firms potentially working in conjunction. It's all speculation, so we don't need to name any names on the show, but you can kind of do your own sleuthing on Twitter to find out who's being implicated here. So probably this was a little bit of maybe pump and dump kind of action, but I think there is still it's an interesting idea, right? It merits some discussion. So whoever wants to take it first, what do you guys largely sort of think about this?
00:02:23.630 - 00:03:55.670, Speaker E: Yeah, I can jump in maybe just to touch on the last point. I think it speaks to the need to be very wary of where these proposals are coming from, especially in a bear market like this where there's limited opportunities. And in general, you want these decisions to be driven by people who have long term vested interests in these protocols and as much as as much shit as the VCs get. Typically that is typically why it's sometimes good to have a lot of the voting power with market participants like this rather than potentially participants that are looking to hold lido for a much shorter period of time and have ulterior motives. So I would say use that lens, especially now in the bear market, as you kind of look at some of these proposals, but then maybe just transitioning to putting that aside, the merits of the proposal itself, I guess just say I'm strongly opposed to the proposal. And my two main issues were, I guess one is just in the context of the proposal. I think the author said that lido has 17 years of runway based off of the assets in its treasury.
00:03:55.670 - 00:04:50.634, Speaker E: And of course, lido probably has one of the more diversified treasuries of D five protocols. But the majority of that quote unquote runway is in LDO tokens. And to be able to pay, I think, a very significant contributor base at this point of around 70 or 80 people. They need stablecoins, they need cash, or at the very least, they need ethereum. I think LDO plays into their comp for long term incentives, but that's just very wrong to be using native tokens to calculate the runway. And I think we can look back to I think it was Hasu and Monet Supply wrote a great managing treasuries well piece, I think, a while ago. So that was my issue.
00:04:50.634 - 00:06:18.840, Speaker E: Number one, is that they need this revenue to pay for expenses, and they have about $30 million of non LDO expenses next year and roughly $30 million of revenue coming in. So if you send out half of that revenue, or whatever was proposed to token holders, now you're operating at a loss, and you have to go sell more lido on the open market or find more VCs to buy it in order to extend that runway. So that's number one. And then number two is, even if lido was profitable, and you kind of put these runway issues aside, I think there's just far better ways to allocate capital to maximize long term token value at this point for lido than to start returning capital to token holders. My general mental model for these things is that if you are profitable, you will use the revenue to pay for your expenses for the next year, and then whatever you have left, you want to invest in basically the highest ROI opportunities for Lido. This could be investing in the staking router, really helping bootstrapping some of these new validator sets, really building out the dual Steeth lido governance. These are the things that's going to maximize lido's long term market share.
00:06:18.840 - 00:07:06.040, Speaker E: And then once you get to the point where you can pay for all your expenses, you've allocated capital towards the highest ROI opportunities, and then you still have revenue left over, just like a traditional company, that's when it starts to make sense to start returning that capital as dividends. And so I don't know why. Maybe it's just the nature of tokens being highly liquid, but people tend to want to distribute capital back to token holders in the very early stages of these protocols, and I just generally think that it's poor capital management or capital allocation management. So, yeah, we'll stop there.
00:07:07.290 - 00:07:47.250, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I strongly agree with your takes on that, Miles. And around the token, the treasury runway thing, absolutely. That's super clear to me, and I really don't think most people would have an argument around that. I think the real debate really comes around revenue distribution. That's where I see kind of two clear camps. And I'm firmly in the belief that the model you just described is perfect in reference to pure governance tokens. If the token doesn't play a direct role in the ecosystem, whatever that may be, there are plenty of different ways that we've already seen protocols design an ecosystem around a token.
00:07:47.250 - 00:08:42.418, Speaker C: Even in the most basic sense, which may or may not be a great model, I'm not supporting the model, but Curve uses their token to create this liquidity incentive program, and they kind of pull from the bitcoin model. All right, so that is one example of where this could make sense. But if in a pure governance token model, returning revenue to the token before it's matured and to your point, has no better places to reinvest the capital is like nothing short of mental illness. It makes no sense. I can't figure out a way to justify how that makes sense. And in the case of Lido, more specifically, after they take their 5% of all Staking revenue, that currently is annualized at about $14 million, and obviously ETH price fluctuations affect that, and the current ETH staking rate affects that as well. But let's just use that $14 million number for now.
00:08:42.418 - 00:09:12.810, Speaker C: And the proposal suggested that up to 50% of that 14 million could be redistributed to the token. So that's $7 million going to a $2 billion token. Why are we doing this? This doesn't make any sense. Please go use that revenue to pay developers to expand your protocol, to improve your protocol, to improve the UX, to create a new service offering, literally anything. This is their job, and it needs to be kept within the protocol to fund future growth.
00:09:13.470 - 00:09:59.494, Speaker D: Yeah, strong agree with that, Dan. I also just think a good analogy for that is what if a bank's only business model was to take customer deposits and put them in short term T bills? Like, they wouldn't be making that much money. It's like the same with, like, they're going to have to diversify that product offering. I personally would love to see an LST backed stable that's kind of like governance minimized. And most of the excess revenue actually flows to an insurance fund because down the line, 1020 years, you could actually do some interesting things with that stablecoin after you have proper reserves backing it. So, I don't know, I think just in general they need to focus on growth and then also, I don't know if you guys remember a little while ago they were talking about giving steep holders governance rights over Lido because it's so intertwined with ethereum security. But this is exactly the opposite of aligning incentives.
00:09:59.494 - 00:10:13.838, Speaker D: This is literally trading ETH for LDO like it's value extractive for the LDO token so very against this proposal. I think there's a lot of interesting things they'll be able to work in down the line, but I just don't think that time is yeah.
00:10:13.924 - 00:10:14.462, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:14.596 - 00:11:35.050, Speaker E: Totally agree. And I think the faulty narrative that know, used to support some of these ideas is that if you start paying out dividends or returning capital in some way, that's going to pump the token price. And now all of a sudden the LDO and your treasury is worth more so you can have a longer runway. And that's why it's like a good capital allocation decision. But if you just look back at protocols that have implemented these models there's typically like a token pump, narrative driven token pump in the month after the announcement comes out, the actual amount of revenue distributed is typically negligible in reality and then the token declines back to the norm. I think that's generally the way these things work but I would say Lido actually does have a roadmap to returning capital. I Think their Goal is really to ossify The protocol over time, and Once they have really reached Maturity, and if they reach Market Dominance and they start basically ossifying these core components of the protocol, then it's basically just maintenance.
00:11:35.050 - 00:11:56.640, Speaker E: And at that Point, it probably makes sense to start Minimizing Governance as much as possible. Which Could Be like removing this idea of capital allocation and just distributing the revenue back to LDO holders. So yeah, I think we're in full agreement here.
00:11:57.890 - 00:12:29.642, Speaker B: Hey everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute but just wanted to let you know that we've got our permissionless conference coming up. This is the one that we do with Bankless. It is the biggest and best conference in DFI. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year, september 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best conferences because those are the ones that all the alpha is at this year. We've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers and the topics that we're covering are insane. We're going to be talking about ZK Tech roll ups, count abstraction, mev app, change, the whole suite of stuff.
00:12:29.642 - 00:13:38.654, Speaker B: I cannot wait myself. So because you're a listener of this podcast, you're also going to get a discount type in Pods 20 and you're going to get 20% off your ticket. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices go up every two weeks. Yeah, you know what, there was a great thread he did it as a semi joke, but sort of poking fun at a real problem. Joseph DeLong put together this thread on the Dow Run lemonade stand and it was semi hyperbole but definitely a real grain of truth and what a Dow Run lemonade stand would be like. It's not like take your lemons and your water, whatever your raw materials, and sell. It's like, well, what if we voted and dumped out four fifths of the lemonade to create scarcity and a liquidity sink? And what if your friend lobbied you to move over to the other sidewalk and this was just the living manifestation of that? And there's like two arguments here, which is, do you have this model that corporate finance has kind of perfected, which is reallocating profits back into the business until you don't have a better use for those profits? And that is when you distribute dividends in the most capital efficient way, which in tradbi is share buybacks.
00:13:38.654 - 00:14:13.098, Speaker B: So what is the time for crypto protocols to do that? I think that's a matter of debate. It's definitely not when you're not profitable. That's definitely when you should not be returning capital to shareholders. Hasu wrote a great response to this where he gave probably more realistic numbers. He's an advisor to Lido and the numbers that he gave were we're projecting Lido Dow to make 30 million in gross margin at the current price of ETH, spend 30 million in cash and spend 15 million in token incentives. So basically 45 million in total expenses. That comes to a net loss of $15 million.
00:14:13.098 - 00:15:12.270, Speaker B: So if you're losing $15 million a year, what you should not be doing is returning capital to shareholders. But there is like a debate of when. That is the problem with these sorts of focus on tokenomics in ecosystems where it doesn't necessarily make sense. Like ETH's tokenomics, like the value crawl mechanism, the burn I think is great, curve is probably a good example, but it distracts from focus which should be directed towards the product and you're trying to create these weird ponzi loops that in this instance actually take away from the business drivers of Lido. So Lido is a two sided marketplace, right, with people that want to stake and deposit ETH and node operators. You're like raising the barrier to entry for node operators by creating a bond, right? That's additional friction. So not only is this isn't even like net neutral, this is net negative in a proposal of tokenomics, which I feel like often happens when you're not focused on the drivers of the business and the financials.
00:15:14.710 - 00:16:28.134, Speaker E: While we're on the topic, I would also like to poke at that scarcity narrative because typically these types of proposals either are let's buy back and distribute the native token, let's distribute whatever the profits are just as is in kind, or let's take our revenue, let's buy back and burn. Just this general idea of when you're an application and you're not trying to be a store of value or money in any way while you're literally lighting your revenue on fire has never resonated with me. And I think it's just while we're on the topic, I would like to extend it to these burn ideas as well because you can just look back, it just hasn't been successful. And I think ethereum is a very unique case where they don't want governance, period, right, that's actually part of their value prop and being credibly neutral. And so if you don't want any sort of governance and your asset actually know you're trying to have money ness around it, then some sort of burn could make sense. But when you're building a product that.
00:16:28.172 - 00:17:51.794, Speaker C: Makes no sense yeah, I want to dive a little deeper on this, Miles. So I strongly agree that the ETH burn mechanism to try to be money, to be the base layer of an economy built on top of it, there's something to that and let's leave that aside. But strictly looking at this buyback and burn sort of this capital redistribution from protocol to token method, if you think about traditional finance and that capital redistribution is commonly done in the form of cash dividends or share repurchases. And if you think about like a buyback and burn as a share repurchase, I'm curious to get your takes around that because in TradFi, everyone has the same models that have slightly different assumptions that all get to the same ballpark value and that's generally how stocks trade. That's significantly oversimplifying it, of course, but generally and then when you look at crypto or I guess to go further on that so that's why share repurchases work when the last thing you do on that model is get the enterprise value divide by the shares outstanding and you just change that shares outstanding number then that's how the capital allocation flows from the company to the shareholder. So if you have a $50 stock and you get one dollars of dividend in cash, now you have $51. Or if I do a share repurchase, that one share goes from still end up with the $51 but in a slightly more tax advantaged way.
00:17:51.794 - 00:18:10.790, Speaker C: And with buyback and burn methodology in crypto, there are no models so there is no changing that last number on the denominator that effectively redistributes that revenue from the protocol to the token holder. So I'm kind of curious to get your takes around that. Will that model ever work in crypto?
00:18:11.690 - 00:19:38.920, Speaker E: So I'd just say, just looking at the traditional side, when do these buybacks make sense and when do they not make sense? And I'll maybe just give two examples in one area where one company where it has actually made sense is very probably the past five years that they've started doing this. And think about Apple's market position and the amount of cash that they hold. I mean, it is orders of magnitude more than we could ever imagine with a protocol at this. You know, it's been fairly successful, but they're in a very privileged position to be able to do that. And where it doesn't make sense is basically kind of what we're talking about here is when there's just better capital allocation decisions. Bill Gurley I'll have to dig up some tweets, but he's written about this a lot and if you look at like, I don't know, just taking a crypto company, I know DCG bought back a ton of shares when they could have eventually used that for the hole in their balance sheet that they created. So these you're again, it is a little bit short sighted in most scenarios, but yeah, I think maybe at some point we could get to the point where that makes sense.
00:19:38.920 - 00:19:58.940, Speaker E: If Uniswap has 95% market share of all decks trading and they want to start burning Uniswap because there's really nothing else to invest in, then that could make sense. But I just think we are years and years away from this making sense for an application that's building a product.
00:19:59.470 - 00:20:36.680, Speaker B: Well, one of the other differences as well, so outside of the capital allocation question is one of market dynamics. And the reason why share purchases work in traditional markets is they're actually relatively efficient. Right? So it's kind of this idea of if you have a pie and you cut it into four pieces or eight pieces, you have changed the slice of the pie. But in crypto markets just aren't that efficient. You just don't have that many sophisticated investors. And I don't think that the way that investors react to share repurchases in TradFi markets are the same way that they react in crypto markets. I just don't think they are.
00:20:36.680 - 00:21:08.162, Speaker B: The other consequence of share buybacks is you restrict the float. That's like not the explicit aim of a share buyback, but that is a consequence of it. And I do wonder if the reason why buyback and burn models in crypto get implemented are less about returning capital to token holders and more about intentionally constricting the float and pumping the price of the token. That's a suspicion that I've always sort of had and wondered about.
00:21:08.296 - 00:21:26.470, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's the general thinking is that you take these shares off the market but you're also applying buy pressure as you're taking them off the market and that makes the token price go up, which makes your treasury go up and it just hasn't totally played out like that.
00:21:26.620 - 00:21:56.618, Speaker D: Yeah, I wish we would see more of a revenue share model, like kind of like gains network. So they do a revenue share model but they also make sure 20% of all revenue or something like that actually goes to a protocol dev fund. So they've been incentivized since day one to keep shipping good products and building out their offering and when they do that, they generate more revenue. That incentive makes a lot more sense to me than the one with lido that we're discussing.
00:21:56.794 - 00:22:32.540, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe we've got a bunch of other stuff to cover, so I want to make sure we move on a little bit past lido. But one thing that I think would be worth getting into is the history of just why steep holders deserve some say in lido governance. And there have been a lot of sort of hot takes on twitter about how I think well, we'll get his take. I think I saw vance tweet this out, actually, that steve is going to surpass what he said. He had some take about this, but basically just rapid growth of steve and that it might be I think his tweet was that it'll be the more common base pair than ETH. On LP pools. So that's a bit of a hot take.
00:22:32.540 - 00:22:45.358, Speaker B: I've kind of come around to it, but I know whoever wants to take, I think, miles, you were sort of involved in the governance aspect of steve holders, and then if we could get into how rapidly you see it expanding.
00:22:45.454 - 00:23:27.070, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. So I think there's two drivers, I mean, liquid staking protocols in general, and you could have this kind of a principal agent problem where you're delegating your stake to a validator, right. You don't necessarily have a choice of who it's delegated to because that's controlled through governance, like a whitelist in lido's case. And these validators are in lido's particular situation, not actually putting up collateral. And so if there was a malicious know, it would destroy their reputation and their business. But that's really what you're banking on. So that's kind of like the risk here.
00:23:27.070 - 00:25:07.822, Speaker E: And second piece I would say is lido's goal is for Steeth to become as ubiquitous as ETH. Itself, right? And to do that, you really need to break through kind of what I think about as like social scalability issues, which is getting the ethereum community comfortable with that sort of roadmap, because that is what will lead to market share domination. And to do that, you really need to do two things. You need to give Steeth holders the ability to veto super malicious proposals that could destroy the value of their Steeth by having some sort of attack, right? And second, over time, you want to ossify or cement parts of the protocol and remove governance's ability to change it. And so these are things like the withdrawal contract at some point in a perfect world, that would just be completely so, you know, as a Steeth holder, you don't have to worry about some sort of lido governance attack that could rug all the Steeth or something like that. And so this is to me, it's like you're trying to solve this principal agent problem in order to maximize the total ceiling of possible market share that you could capture. And it was at a point where I think they had reached 30% of all staking market share.
00:25:07.822 - 00:26:06.034, Speaker E: And obviously we're like in the 90% of market share within liquid staking. And so theorem, community starts to get nervous and saying this is going to look like kind of like a Cosmos chain if this is what the status quo is, where we have maybe 150 validators. But that's against our principles. That's not how we designed Ethereum. And so I think all of this, like the dual Steeth lido governance, the ability to add new validator sets with a staking router, including permissionless ones this is all going towards, okay, what do we need to do in order to get the community comfortable with having Steeth basically as the canonical liquid staking token with winner take all market share? And I think they're on the right track, honestly. Yeah.
00:26:06.072 - 00:27:06.018, Speaker C: Not to put Vance in the hot seat, but that Tweet stated that Staked ETH would be the more common base pair by year end. Bold take, my friend, but I totally agree with Miles'sentiment there. Staked ETH is Lido's product and they're just trying to improve the utility of that product and give the token holders more rights in the system. And I think that's broadly kind of a good way to go about this. But yeah, I'm curious to watch Lido grow. Obviously it'll grow with the market share of total Staked ETH, but I'm curious if that 30, 33% market share number kind of acts as this stonewall for their growth. Because to Miles point, right, do we really want one ecosystem member? And sure, there's 28, I believe is the number total validators operating on behalf of Lido's total stake, but do we really want to shrink the total amount of validators to that number? And I don't know, I generally think the Ethereum community will kind of push away from that.
00:27:06.018 - 00:27:17.894, Speaker C: So I'm kind of really interested to watch Lido's growth and whether or not that 33% of total stake number becomes an issue going forward. And right now, just for context, they're sitting at about 31%.
00:27:18.012 - 00:27:45.530, Speaker B: So I have a question to you guys. Let's just say let's remove the sort of social scaling problem and whether or not Ethereum would accept that. Let's also remove the factor that there might be some sort of catastrophic slashing event or technical bug in Lido or something like that. By the way, it's kind of a shame we're talking about this because V Two actually ended up shipping this week, which is super cool. So props to Lido. I heard Ren on the Zero X research podcast. Which shield Dan and Sam here.
00:27:45.530 - 00:28:14.250, Speaker B: They put together some great content. You go over and listen. But there was a nut statistic. So there are nine different audits that were conducted on V Two, and each audit up till the last one found a new bug, which Ren said he didn't know how to feel about that. I know how I felt about that, which is not particularly great. You would hope by like four or five, there wouldn't be finding new stuff. But let's remove the social scaling risk and let's remove the fact that there might be a bug.
00:28:14.250 - 00:29:04.250, Speaker B: I think in that world you'd rather hold steep than ETH, right? Like why wouldn't you? It's just the Steeth gives you some form of interest, right? Like staking rewards and ETH doesn't give you staking rewards. And the ETH roadmap and monetary policy is clearly favoring stakers over holders, right? Everything from 1559 to the burn, those are all done for reasons of credible neutrality. Not like number go up reasons but those are the reasons. So I think to maybe defend Vance's point of view a little bit I think by end of year that's a pretty bold prediction but I do see the relative demand of Steeth over ETH. Yeah, it's going to go up over time. It's like bonds versus dollars. Like you rather hold money that gives you interest.
00:29:04.400 - 00:30:07.806, Speaker C: But the counterpoint in that example is the US government's the only issuer of what gets deemed as risk fee bonds. But there's multiple protocols that issue liquid staking derivatives of ETH that use different models just very clearly and Lido is the winner today. They kind of had a huge first mover advantage with being the first liquid staking token listed on Aave. If you pull up the chart of outstanding staked ETH and then map over when it got listed on Ave it is very clear the impact that that had. And so I'm curious, we've kind of adopted this as the safest liquid staking derivative as a market and I don't know, I'm just really interested to watch this market play out as other players get a little more mature and have a slightly different offering. Whether that be know, FRAX built this kind of Ponzonomic model where it has a two token model that provides higher yield or Coinbase has like a higher fee but know super easy to onboard new people. You get to do it directly through the Coinbase app.
00:30:07.806 - 00:30:26.280, Speaker C: There's like these different trade offs with all these different models. So I don't that's that's my issue with how does one liquid staking derivative become the de facto base pair. Is there's just so many different offerings that ultimately I fear that we're going to get this liquidity fragmentation in that world?
00:30:27.130 - 00:30:40.550, Speaker E: Yeah, I totally see that. I do think that there's also a lot of forces that push it towards winner take all though, right? Because The Liquidity basically begets more liquidity.
00:30:40.630 - 00:30:43.194, Speaker B: Begets liquidity and So on.
00:30:43.232 - 00:31:41.806, Speaker E: And there's a lot there, I think. One thing I've been thinking about and we work closely with the Liquid collective team and there is a part of the market that just from a compliance standpoint can't really touch lido because in know maybe they're like a centralized custodian that is a fiduciary on behalf of their customers and they cannot basically support staking to non KYC validators and they don't kind of reach their. Levels of compliance. And then there's another part of the market that just ideologically would prefer, like a rocket pool sort of model. And I think that that's why the staking router is so important, because you basically have your existing set of whatever. It's like 30 validators or something like that. And 100% of deposits are going there today.
00:31:41.806 - 00:32:09.800, Speaker E: But you could also see them adding different validator sets that cater to those other parts of the market and then splitting how the deposits are allocated across those different validator sets as well as within. Yeah. And so and I do think that it's a big question here. I would say that the Coinbase success has been both ease of access as well as compliance, which I don't think a lot of people think about.
00:32:10.250 - 00:32:19.320, Speaker C: And that kind of, like, ties together this whole conversation of, go use that $14 million to build out the staking contract. That was the first thing.
00:32:20.010 - 00:32:20.758, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:32:20.924 - 00:32:37.546, Speaker B: Seriously. You know what else they could use it for? So I saw dgen Spartan tweet this. I didn't realize this, but bybit they're a liquid staking program. They just convert you directly into steep. I mean, they're just like a front end distribution. Go do more of that. That's phenomenal.
00:32:37.546 - 00:33:01.320, Speaker B: Go do that with well, it's now like Kucoin or whatever other kind of tier two exchanges will have. You basically kraken's got some problems with their staking. Go do that. Let them be a front end. I mean, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff like even even there was a synthetics proposal to onboard Steeth, I'm pretty sure as well. Was that synthetics or was that some crafty BD work? I don't know.
00:33:01.320 - 00:33:15.098, Speaker B: That is what they should be doing. They should be opening up new distribution channels, pipelines. This is a winner take all marketplace. And we want to be the winner. We want to get critical mess. That's what they should be doing.
00:33:15.184 - 00:33:15.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:15.472 - 00:33:37.460, Speaker D: Another thing I'd love to see would be kind of the use of account abstraction with Steeth on L two S. As you mentioned, Mike, obviously you want to hold Steeth barring contract risk over regular ETH. So if I could pay for transactions on Arbitrum or optimism in Steeth, that would be fantastic. I would always have a steep balance in my wallet. So that's another thing they could work on.
00:33:38.710 - 00:34:26.394, Speaker B: Sorry, this wasn't even on the roadmap or the notes for today, but I got to shout out Ethereum. I saw Geez at Visa tweeting out some of the tinkering that they're doing on account abstraction and acting as a paymaster, and I was blown away by that, that they understand what that is and they understand the opportunity for Visa. You've seen a lot of proof of concepts from banks talking about tokenization of real estate. I'm just sorry, my eyes just glaze over that. But this Visa as a payments giant, understanding account abstraction of where they fit in the ecosystem is freaking cool. I would be long. Sorry, not financial advice, but Visa.
00:34:26.394 - 00:34:40.470, Speaker B: Yeah, they're probably the largest institution acting crypto today that I really think actually gets it and has a super cool approach to it. So huge shout out to Kai and the team at Visa. Just awesome.
00:34:40.620 - 00:35:19.550, Speaker E: Couldn't agree, you know, very much so. Signal over noise there. And I do think it'll be interesting though, because we have so many of these very early stage kind of account abstraction infrastructure providers that have really been kind of pioneering everything about this new development with 4337. And then you have incumbents like Coinbase and Visa that could also be extending their capabilities. And it will be interesting to see how they think about like a buy partner build with how to deal with this infrastructure, especially the ones that are not as sophisticated as Visa.
00:35:19.710 - 00:35:50.650, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, I want to make sure that we have some time to talk about Stacks. Got to give a shout out to Sam here. Wrote, I think, the Hundredth report on blockworks research and it was pretty much a blowout on Stacks, which you personally, Sam, uncovered some pretty critical bugs in that ecosystem that hadn't necessarily been there before. By the way, big fan of bootv and stacks in general and definitely pulling for them, but it was fascinating. Sam, maybe could you just give us kind of like an overview of what you found in the stacks ecosystem?
00:35:51.150 - 00:36:12.750, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I'll do my best to kind of TLDR it as quick as I can. So essentially, Stacks uses what's called a proof of transfer consensus mechanism. Basically, miners on the bitcoin layer can send bitcoin to two different stacks. Stacker staker, they call it stacking. That's probably my least favorite part of Stacks, to be honest, out of all this. I really don't like that term.
00:36:12.750 - 00:37:06.318, Speaker D: But anyways, they send it to two random stacker addresses and then dependent upon how much bitcoin they send in relation to other people who are submitting bids, they have a higher chance of mining the next stack's block. And then STX stackers are able to earn native bitcoin yield, which is actually really cool. I love that aspect of the proof of transfer design. But the problem is there's actually three problems. The first one was there was a critical bug discovered in the proof of transfer stacking mechanism that allowed a stacker to trick the contract into thinking they had more STX stacked than they actually did. So they wound up earning 15 and a half or so bitcoin over a 20 day period, basically stealing their share of bitcoin in relation to other stackers. So that's pretty bad because STX stackers are going to be charged with signing peg in and peg outs when they launch s bitcoin.
00:37:06.318 - 00:37:58.366, Speaker D: So to date they don't have like a native bitcoin bridge, but they're looking to build that out because they think it's been kind of one of the growth hurdles for their ecosystem. Their main goal is really to onboard that $500 billion of idle bitcoin capital into DFI and making it productive. But had this bug occurred with sBitcoin live, all of the bitcoin in the bridge would have been at risk. So that's the first bug. The second one is Bitcoin mev related. Basically, F two pool, the mining pool that has a 15% share of Bitcoin hash power, has been excluding or ignoring other Stacks mining bids and including only their own. So that way they can send as little bitcoin as they want to, to STX Stackers and still win the block since they're the only competition for that block.
00:37:58.366 - 00:38:35.706, Speaker D: So that's really outright censorship and kind of the first example of Bitcoin mev that I've really seen. So it's super interesting. But yeah, Ft pool over the last six months has pretty much had 70% to 100% market share over block building on Stacks. So obviously that's a problem that needs to be addressed. And then lastly, Stacks has been experiencing more reorgs as of late and there isn't really kind of a root cause known by the team. They think it's kind of just connectivity issues. But this is really bad just because stacks is going to undergo the Nakamoto upgrade and they're going to introduce fast blocks, so they'll have blocks in between different settlement blocks.
00:38:35.706 - 00:39:06.010, Speaker D: So that way the block times are faster and they're not plagued by Bitcoin's time to finality, but I'm not so sure how this is going to impact that. So definitely something to keep an eye on, but yeah, reorgs are obviously bad because they're going to reduce network throughput, potentially have some nodes drop off the chain, make it less secure. So there's definitely a lot of problems that stacks needs to combat, but it's cool that they're trying to tie their chain closely to Bitcoin because me, personally, I'm very excited about the prospects of bringing DFI to Bitcoin.

00:39:53.926 - 00:40:02.670, Speaker A: Today at Slash Empire.
00:40:06.850 - 00:40:33.506, Speaker B: Yeah, it was interesting, just we're concluding this mev season with Hasu, and frankly, I didn't even think to look at bitcoin as the source of mev or just understand what was going on from mining perspective in bitcoin, but maybe we should have. I mean, this is a super interesting exploit by one of the larger mining pools out there. So my understanding is not huge dollars, but it's still worrisome.
00:40:33.538 - 00:40:33.734, Speaker E: Right?
00:40:33.772 - 00:41:05.934, Speaker B: It's just some good old fashioned censorship and mev extraction. So, yeah, it was just interesting. It also, I think, shows the challenges of Stacks has been called a roll up. At this point, I'll just say I'm not even 100% sure I know what a roll up is. But the design architecture between Stacks as opposed to some canonical, like, optimistic or ZK roll ups on ethereum is definitely different. And I admire the work because I'm a lover of Bitcoin. I want Bitcoin to succeed.
00:41:05.934 - 00:41:19.954, Speaker B: I think all this stuff is super cool too, but there are definite challenges, like the super small block size and the ten limit or the ten minute block times that Stacks is going to hurdle. I don't know if you guys have any other thoughts or conclusions.
00:41:20.082 - 00:41:52.634, Speaker D: One thing to note honestly, because it does sound bad for Stacks, but at the same time, it's really no different. Having one Stacks block builder is really no different than having an L two with a centralized sequencer. So they're kind of in the same position in a way. So I think that's worth pointing out. It's just a little bit more worrisome because obviously, in the case of optimism or Arbitrum, they're directly incentivized to operate it in an honest manner. But this is an external party, so who knows how the incentives get switched up once sBitcoin goes live?
00:41:52.772 - 00:42:51.618, Speaker E: Yeah, it's like if optimism gave that centralized sequencer to a searcher or like a trading firm, right. They're obviously going to extract value from it. I think that's all right. And yeah, I really appreciate you digging in because I don't spend a ton of time in that area of the space. But it does speak to kind of the challenges of we've talked about Bitcoin as an app chain, and I think this is kind of deviating from really what would be considered Bitcoin's original purpose. But I still think that there's a lot of really interesting space to explore. And it's just a question of whether Bitcoin's role in DeFi is kind of truly like being exporting Bitcoin to other DeFi ecosystems that are maybe better suited for it, or if there is a way to kind of achieve what Stacks is trying to do.
00:42:51.618 - 00:43:05.590, Speaker E: It's unclear to me if that's kind of them trying to get a square into a round hole, because it's just very different than the design of the base layer.
00:43:05.930 - 00:44:00.186, Speaker C: Yeah, no kidding. And one interesting thing from this, though, was the nefarious actor was f two pool in the case of Stacks. And we've also seen them have a little nefarious activity on ETH back in the proof of work days, and they were like kind of messing around with timestamps on the consensus layer. And if you actually credit to a guy named Alex on Twitter, maybe we can link this thread in the show notes, but he actually found an address on ETH Main net that's a tied to the founder or what I believe to be the founder of F two pool. Nonetheless, it seems to be an F Two pool address. And this person is withdrawing SNX, the token to Ethereum main net, bridging it to optimism and then redepositing it back into binance and then just like looping that process. So I can't come up with any good reasons as to why that is.
00:44:00.186 - 00:44:07.530, Speaker C: But given their previous behavior in the space, I think that's kind of something to keep an eye on as this event develops.
00:44:07.950 - 00:44:09.130, Speaker E: Likely not good.
00:44:09.200 - 00:44:19.822, Speaker C: Whenever they're like, I don't know, maybe they're just bored and they're trolling finance. I have no idea. But that seems like that's generally not the case. There must be some financial incentive here.
00:44:19.956 - 00:44:50.674, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just before we can close with Tether and the announcement that they're going to start their own little Bitcoin purchasing program. But what do you guys think in general about just Ordinals and BRC twenty S? And I guess there's kind of like the ordinal NFT inscriptions and then there's also like it's part of a wider attempt to actually build out robust DeFi on top of Bitcoin. I'm kind of two minds about it, actually. I'd love to get your guys opinions.
00:44:50.722 - 00:44:51.706, Speaker E: On it, but I've thought a little.
00:44:51.728 - 00:44:52.780, Speaker B: Bit about it myself.
00:44:54.670 - 00:45:37.378, Speaker E: At first. I thought it was a bit OD or like this is just kind of a fun experiment. But I don't know, the more I've thought about it, I guess again, back to this framework of Bitcoin as an app chain and really a place. Their product is this extraordinarily censorship resistant asset. Right. Those same properties actually make for NFT storage pretty and minting, somewhat attractive. And I guess I would not expect there to be like NFT phi on Bitcoin just because if it's just people holding NFTs there and buying and purchasing occasionally, then that makes sense.
00:45:37.378 - 00:45:56.910, Speaker E: But I wouldn't expect any maybe where it becomes like high volume trading of these things happens somewhere else. But yeah, I think they also overtook Ethereum NFTs and volume this past week. So there's something there. It's at least speculation.
00:45:57.570 - 00:46:24.914, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd say fad. I don't think it sticks around for that long. The one thing I like about it is obviously the immutability of Bitcoin. A lot of NFTs on Ethereum aren't as immutable and sensor super resistant as a lot of people think. But I don't think there's any legs to it for specifically static images. That was so last Bull run at this point. I think the fun part about NFTs at this point is just the programmatic ability.
00:46:24.914 - 00:46:39.660, Speaker D: God, I can't talk right now. But you know, what I'm trying to say is of the NFTs like blend, I'm not saying that's actually a good product or not, but I just think the interesting part of NFTs is the ability to add utility to them on a smart contract enabled platform.
00:46:40.190 - 00:47:23.062, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I lean in your direction, Sam, but I kind of like the idea of mean. If we take a step back, bitcoin has a fee problem. It needs to generate organic fee revenue at some point. I'm not saying its model won't work, but that is just a problem that it's going to have to deal with at some point in the future. And at least with the rise of ordinals we can point to this and be like, okay, maybe we can innovate something. Because prior to that they'd be like, well, I don't know, we'll come up with something eventually. That was the thick of it and now at least we have something to point to be like, okay, maybe the whole speculation side of this not great, but let's try to build this out into a more sustainable ecosystem.
00:47:23.062 - 00:47:49.342, Speaker C: And that's kind of how I'm viewing it. So tend to agree. The speculation side of things is a fad. It's clearly not built properly. Right? So when you trade these BRC 20s, you're creating an NFT that says this is for 3241 tokens and then if somebody wants to buy 5000, they'd buy that NFT and then keep buying NFTs of other token lots until it added up to 5000. That's never going to work. That's not scalable.
00:47:49.342 - 00:47:50.450, Speaker C: That's ridiculous.
00:47:51.350 - 00:48:18.122, Speaker E: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. A lot more than just JPEGs, right? That make it NFTs a lot more interesting. I mean, even Lidos, I think the withdrawal process just involves an NFT, which is just another example. Right. You see NFTs in Uniswap. V three. There's a lot more that can be done here, but it is a vehicle for speculation and they needed one strong agree.
00:48:18.176 - 00:48:42.034, Speaker C: And just to give one more quick example of like a cool useful NFT was the interchange scheduler in the Atom 2.0 white paper. The idea of tokenizing future block space, and those are obviously non fungible. Each block is unique with an NFT was super interesting. I think we're going to get really cool use cases for NFTs. I personally believe those use cases will be brought more so on chain than off chain. Right.
00:48:42.034 - 00:49:06.970, Speaker C: Like to Mike's point, I also fall asleep when you talk about tokenizing real estate, but I tend to think the technology unlock of an NFT is really huge. We just don't know what to do with it yet. But I think we've already starting to see some exciting examples arise. And that also flows to Sam's point. When NFTs get more programmatic and more use case around them, I tend to think that won't be on Bitcoin.
00:49:08.270 - 00:49:55.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I've kind of thought about this a decent amount and I think ultimately, first of all, I kind of just am more in favor of market type planning than central planning. And if the market wants to do this, I don't know, I just think central planning goes wrong very often and I didn't love. I kind of had a knee jerk bad reaction to the Bitcoin high priest saying that maybe miners should censor these transactions when ordinals were originally taking off. That just really rubbed me the wrong way. So who knows? And eventually bitcoin had to figure out their monetary policy because once the block rewards went away, they had low transaction fees and that was not going to be enough to secure a network that they were hoping to grow at the size to really grow. So I think this is, like, an interesting solution. I don't love DeFi on Bitcoin, but I do like NFTs.
00:49:55.206 - 00:50:18.526, Speaker B: I think NFTs, it's been interesting to watch NFTs on ethereum. When are these going to move to Polygon or Arbitrum or something like that? They don't, because there's a provenance there's like a little bit of cachet for minting on a more expensive chain. Bitcoin fits that to a T. And bitcoin has culture, too. They've got culture, they've got a fan base. So I don't know. I think I like the Ordinals.
00:50:18.526 - 00:51:05.694, Speaker B: I'm a little bit less of a fan of DeFi on Bitcoin, but still worth paying attention to. Let's transition here to Tether and maybe we could close on this topic. And frankly, I would love to get your guys thoughts. So we just got the latest Attestation report from Tether and I think, Dan, you were the one who pointed out that I guess this came from BDO, which is not top four, one of the big four, but it's number five. It did come from the Italian branch. And I say this is an Italian, so I mean, no slight against the good folks of Italy, but I would have liked to see this come out of America, I'm not going to lie. But, yeah, it looks like everything is sound in terms of their balance sheet.
00:51:05.694 - 00:51:23.910, Speaker B: They did announce that they were going to be basically reinvesting 15% of net operating profit into Bitcoin buys and in gold as well. So would love to just sort of get all your guys thoughts about this. What do we think? Good idea? Bad idea? How are you thinking about it?
00:51:24.060 - 00:51:54.914, Speaker C: I mean, Tether is a business and they want to make money, so I get it. As long as that's with the profits and not my deposits, I would greatly appreciate if deposits are backed one to one. We don't need any more fiascos like that. Yeah, I agree. I think this was their first Attestation with BDO. I think that's a huge step in the right direction. I hear your sentiment on the Italian branch of it like, all right, what's going on there?
00:51:55.112 - 00:51:56.782, Speaker B: Oh, Dan. Do you not trust Italians?
00:51:56.846 - 00:51:58.254, Speaker C: Hey, with a name like Dan Smith.
00:51:58.302 - 00:51:59.234, Speaker B: You'D never believe it.
00:51:59.272 - 00:52:49.186, Speaker C: But also got some deep roots in the Italian heritage. But yeah, I don't know, I think it's cool. People were threading about the buy pressure on Bitcoin and this is like a fraction if you annualize the revenue they made in Q One and assume that they continue that out, I forget the exact number, so I'll ballpark it at like $400 million of Bitcoin buy pressure. That is an absolute fraction of the annual minor issuance or minor subsidies. So it's cool, but you'd probably need to see USDC encircle and the issuer apaxos of USDP and all these other stablecoins as well kind of participate in this. But Tether is largely the largest stablecoin. So I don't know, it's cool, but that's about it for me.
00:52:49.368 - 00:53:13.580, Speaker D: I got a question for you guys. How in the world is Tether not in any way impacted by the banking problems in the like? Their liabilities are US dollars. They have to hold them somewhere. And those banks likely have exposure to US dollar denominated debt, which has been obviously the root cause of the banking cris. So I just don't understand how they haven't been affected at.
00:53:15.390 - 00:53:57.406, Speaker B: Just let me layer on because there was a worry a little while ago, I don't know if you remember, a Chinese real estate developer called Evergrande coming under an enormous amount of stress. And the worry was because the word has know bond traders, they don't trade anything on Tether's behalf. They don't know any other traders, they don't know anyone who trades on Tether's behalf. So the speculation was always that they must be trading Chinese commercial paper, then Evergreen imploded, and they said, we're not impacted by this at all. So Sam, I think the only logical answer to your question is that they were in China. They dodged it perfectly, then they went to the US and invested in US treasuries. They knew the banking cris was coming, and now they're back in China.
00:53:57.406 - 00:54:01.420, Speaker B: I think that's a perfectly logical explanation. That's definitely what's going on.
00:54:04.510 - 00:54:27.154, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that was the funniest part about everybody fleeing USDC during the DPEG to USDT Tether. And it was like the implication is that there's no exposure to the US banking system, which I guess at that time was probably a good thing. But broadly, you probably do want exposure to the largest financial economy in the world. So I don't know.
00:54:27.352 - 00:55:25.538, Speaker E: I don't think that's up to them. I don't think any banks are servicing Tether. I think they've got some red flags would come up on a conservative bank's compliance department, DD. But yeah, I have no idea. We've had Tether FUD for years now, right? And it comes and goes in waves and you can spin up a story for exactly the worst case scenario here that makes a lot of sense. And you can also just kind of continue to blissfully ignore it, which is basically more or less what we've been doing and who knows what the truth is. Yeah, I would be very disappointed if this was another LFG approach to diversify some sort of the collateral into Bitcoin, which we've seen can go poorly, especially, I mean, all this.
00:55:25.538 - 00:55:41.370, Speaker E: Remember what happened with that? It was like, yay, all this buy pressure on Bitcoin and then it blew up and we're like, no, all this sell pressure on Bitcoin could see that too, but I don't feel very strongly in either direction.
00:55:43.790 - 00:56:46.750, Speaker B: I think at this stage, I think it's okay to demand transparency, especially for something as impactful as Tether as it is. E $2 billion market cap. I don't understand the justification for being so opaque. It simply should not be this difficult to get more insight and transparency into their balance sheet. And I don't know, I feel like, to be honest with you, my knee jerk response to this was, yeah, Doequan was like a year ago, if this Bitcoin is buying Bitcoin now going to end up being a poor financial decision? Probably not. We all work in crypto, I'd be bullish at this price level and it'll probably end up being a good financial decision. I guess my question is, what's the reason why they're doing this? Because if it's an optics and marketing decision, then I really don't like it, to be honest with you, because just pattern matching, I have sort of negative associations with who's done that in the past.
00:56:46.750 - 00:57:04.130, Speaker B: So I don't know, I think it's something that's interesting to watch and I would love to see the sort of pressure just ration up on Tether to just be more transparent with their books. Like they could be I don't understand why we don't insist that they aren't more transparent. I just think they should be.
00:57:04.200 - 00:57:46.130, Speaker E: Yeah, I think we have insisted. I think the obvious answer is they don't really want you to know exactly what's on there. That's like the skeptical view, obviously. And then on why they're doing this, I don't know. A ton of background on the history of the team that runs Tether, but they could be OG Bitcoiners. That just could be like some sort of ideological thing, or it could feel like it's a hedge on kind of some tail risk, black swan event with a lot of the credit backing their collateral.
00:57:47.030 - 00:58:11.498, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the reason if I'm, the Tether founder, to do this is either A, make it all back in one trade, or B, I'm trying to position myself as the future global bank, because obviously, if you think crypto, if that's part of your thesis, you're going to need Bitcoin liquidity. So I guess it makes sense to start buying now as opposed to later. But yeah, those are the only two reasons I could come up with.
00:58:11.664 - 00:58:18.010, Speaker B: I feel like everyone on this call is going to know this, but do you know which blockchain settles the most amount of Tether?
00:58:20.290 - 00:58:25.370, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, it's an extremely highly reputable blockchain.
00:58:25.530 - 00:58:33.310, Speaker C: Please, no more questions. Like these good old Justin Sun's Tron with like, what is it, 50 some OD billion?
00:58:34.050 - 00:58:46.980, Speaker B: Yeah, the gap is actually widening. You can see. Yeah, the amount settled on Tron is growing faster than ethereum. Some of the gulf is widening there.
00:58:48.150 - 00:59:09.466, Speaker C: I don't know what's up with that. I've been wondering for too long. I need to go listen to his Empire podcast with Jason, but I want to hear his answer because why? I need answers. There's no economic activity over there outside of Justin's $2 billion in their version of Ave, so I don't know, man.
00:59:09.568 - 00:59:10.720, Speaker E: Yeah. I don't know.
00:59:11.170 - 00:59:15.870, Speaker B: Yeah. We end this podcast with more questions than answers.
00:59:20.610 - 00:59:43.926, Speaker D: It actually is crazy. One last thought that just two months ago, USDC was sitting at a similar market cap to Tether, and now it's less than half of Tether's market cap. Like, what an absolute botched result of all this banking problems in the US. We had circle such a good entity fighting the good fight, and now it's just gone the other direction. So that's unfortunate to see.
00:59:44.028 - 01:00:18.494, Speaker B: I would bet that's temporary. I have to bet that that's temporary. Yeah. I actually thought miles on Reverie's podcast. I pledge allegiance that was a great interview with Diogo and Nathan and they talked about these sort of market distortions that can actually exist for multiple years. So let's say you were a competitor against Celsius and you were just watching these guys, the models, like, the numbers didn't work, but it just worked for like six years. And they ate up all the AUM.
01:00:18.494 - 01:00:47.400, Speaker B: It looked like they were winning for so long. It's like 1000 days in the life of a turkey and then boom, the head gets chopped off and there you are being served on the platter. And I think in crypto, that's especially true. I mean, these distortion fields can run for it's not like weeks or months, it's years. And it makes you question all these decisions. And I think it's just a good reminder when you see something that you're just, like, scratching your head over and just can't make sense of you're not crazy.
01:00:48.810 - 01:00:50.640, Speaker E: Yeah, it makes me feel great. It.
01:00:53.410 - 01:01:01.306, Speaker B: All right. Well, fellow turkeys, this has been a lot of fun, guys. Thanks for standing in. This was a super fun roundup.
01:01:01.418 - 01:01:02.126, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:01:02.308 - 01:01:03.210, Speaker C: Cheers, Mike.
01:01:03.290 - 01:01:04.718, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. Thanks, guys.
01:01:04.804 - 01:01:05.166, Speaker E: See ya.
01:01:05.188 - 01:01:05.580, Speaker B: Cheers. All.
