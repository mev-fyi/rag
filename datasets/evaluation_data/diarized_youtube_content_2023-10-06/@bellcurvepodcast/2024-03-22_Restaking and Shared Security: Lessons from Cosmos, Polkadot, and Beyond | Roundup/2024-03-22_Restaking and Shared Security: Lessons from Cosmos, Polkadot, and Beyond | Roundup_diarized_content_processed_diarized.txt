00:00:00.170 - 00:00:35.240, Speaker A: If we don't learn from history, we're like doomed to repeat it. And I hope sincerely that we are learning every single time and getting better and smarter about this stuff like parachain auction slots. So first of all, it just like limited innovation, right? You couldn't have a permissionlessly tap into the economic security of polka dot. They would have one every three weeks. It was this massive event. I think Acala had like $1.3 billion of dot locked up and then it was locked up for like two years, right? I mean, holy inefficiency of market structure, right? Just like wow, this is crazy.
00:00:35.240 - 00:00:40.322, Speaker A: Some of them a year later went for $55,000 nuts.
00:00:40.386 - 00:01:11.202, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, Ethereum, layer twos and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve NFTs which you can get and mint for free.
00:01:11.202 - 00:01:30.902, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right guys, on with the show. Hi everyone. This episode is brought to you by swell, a team leading the restaking future with their liquid restaking token Rsweep. Now I've talked about liquid restaking on this program before. I think it is going to be a massive tectonic shift for Ethereum and I am super, super excited about it. And I like the swell team a lot.
00:01:30.902 - 00:01:51.178, Speaker B: Goes without saying, do your own research. This is not financial advice. You guys all know the drill. Again, I like this team. And if you stick around, I'm going to describe how you can restake your ETH in swell, earn pearls, eigen layer points, and a whole bunch of future rewards. So thank you very much for swell, for making this episode possible. Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator.
00:01:51.178 - 00:02:20.834, Speaker B: Now, if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that Mev is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with Flood on this season. Flood is the only gasless and Mev free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap. Now, this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you, Flood and back to the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.
00:02:20.882 - 00:02:22.614, Speaker A: The views expressed by my co host.
00:02:22.662 - 00:02:52.130, Speaker B: Today are their personal views, and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got Miles today, Miles. Welcome and special guest new to the show, Jim Perillo of Figment Cap.
00:02:52.130 - 00:02:53.060, Speaker B: Guys, welcome.
00:02:53.990 - 00:02:58.050, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. Longtime listener, first time caller.
00:03:00.150 - 00:03:01.614, Speaker C: Excited to have you, Jim.
00:03:01.742 - 00:03:03.334, Speaker A: I love, really excited to be here.
00:03:03.452 - 00:03:05.922, Speaker B: I love the pudgy in the back there, Jim.
00:03:06.066 - 00:03:06.678, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:03:06.764 - 00:03:08.354, Speaker B: We have that in shot.
00:03:08.482 - 00:03:34.014, Speaker A: Welcome to the New York Figment capital office. I'm the GP of Figment Capital. Been working with Miles for a little while and got to know Mike at East Denver and then we're all in New York City and so got to grab drinks. Yeah, you've got the pudgy penguin behind us, which is an NFT that our CFO and COO owns. Funny story behind that. We've got some initiative stickers back here. We've got some bad kids on the walls for you.
00:03:34.014 - 00:03:43.220, Speaker A: Bad kid. Fun office. We believe in office culture. Everyone's here. Everyone works out of the office every day. It's good times.
00:03:43.670 - 00:03:52.822, Speaker B: We love a CFO that is comfortable in pudgy penguins. That is the sign of a flexible CFO. Voiceover anything.
00:03:52.956 - 00:03:59.958, Speaker A: He lets us get away with a lot of things. He's responsible in all the right ways and flexible in all the best ways.
00:04:00.124 - 00:04:14.014, Speaker B: That's amazing. That's a good one, too. It's got a little Santa cap. I don't know the rarity of all the pudgies, but it's been a tough month for pudgies. Actually, they were down like 50%, something like that in the last month. So hanging on by a thread. But what are you going to do? I think they're up, actually.
00:04:14.014 - 00:04:16.222, Speaker B: I saw the last couple hours, so that's good.
00:04:16.276 - 00:04:22.000, Speaker A: Everyone's rotating into Bowden, rotating their profits into.
00:04:25.330 - 00:04:50.778, Speaker B: Talking to you. And by the way, Vance and Michael, they're both flying back. They were with us in London. I've been in London for the last three days at Das London, which was a blast for the most part. You would be shocked at the amount of times that meme coins got referenced on the main stage of this all institutional conference by. And it's not just like the DGens that snuck their way in. It was like Franklin Templeton was talking about these things in a positive way.
00:04:50.778 - 00:05:03.118, Speaker B: This wasn't just like, oh, wrote speculation, yada yada. There were a lot of positive framings around these meme coins in a very institutional crowd. So that was interesting to like.
00:05:03.204 - 00:05:15.550, Speaker A: We don't talk too much about them publicly. Some funds do, some funds don't. I'm curious, what was the positive framing? How are they looking at them and thinking about, how's tradfi thinking about meme coins?
00:05:15.710 - 00:06:01.418, Speaker B: I think the positive framing, basically, is that it encourages adoption. And this is where there's a lot of over intellectualization going on around meme coins, I think, writ large. I think whenever you start to see the 20 thread thick boy pieces in the VCs, it's like you should probably just sell whatever they're talking about. And I think we're reaching that with the meme coins, like tokenization of culture. Okay, but one thing that I've thought about a little bit on this whole, like this always comes up, right? Speculation versus real world use cases. I think finance, when you're building financial product, the alchemy that actually goes into that is speculation. And that speculation can actually lead to real products that are extremely useful.
00:06:01.418 - 00:06:31.094, Speaker B: Great example of that is the 30 year fixed rate mortgage. That is not an animal that exists in the wild. The only reason why it's possible for banks to offer you a 30 year fixed rate mortgage is because there's a bunch of dgens out there that want to take levered bets on interest rates in this really deep and liquid market of interest rate swaps. So it's never felt totally true to me, these people that are against speculation. It's the work of the devil. And it's never really felt great to me to be like, yeah, we're just building an online casino here. I kind of hate both of those framings.
00:06:31.094 - 00:06:43.630, Speaker B: I think when it comes to financial applications, some amount of speculation is required to make real products. And I sort of just loosely lump meme coins. Somewhere into that conversation is how I look at it.
00:06:43.700 - 00:07:08.040, Speaker A: I mean, meme coins are essentially ICOs without the ICO, right? So you didn't have to put the deck together. You didn't have to scam a bunch of people. Everyone kind of knows what they're getting into on day one. And it's gambling. It's like on chain gambling, sometimes they become communities, sometimes they don't. It's fun. People should do it.
00:07:08.040 - 00:07:50.382, Speaker A: I'm going to quote you in the over intellectualization of meme coins is like a hilarious thing to think about, because when you're on chain and you're looking for them, it's anything but intellectual at all. But it's fun. It's good. There's a ton of coins that come on, and a lot of them are launching right now on Solana. And the trading pair is right, and it does create a bit of a bigger base for soul to be a trading pair, a major trading pair on its own chain. People aren't rotating into stable coins when they sell out of these. They're rotating back into Seoul.
00:07:50.382 - 00:08:20.570, Speaker A: I assume that has very much helped the price of Seoul, but it maybe also comes with, like, we've talked about this a little bit before. Violent delights come with violent ends, and you start to see these crazy ticks up, and you're going to see crazy ticks down. Because when meme coins go down, you sell into Seoul. And then when some point people start taking profits into Seoul or something, maybe it impacts the price. We haven't looked too much into it, but there's a ton of shit coins on Ethereum.
00:08:21.950 - 00:09:06.282, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, Jim and me, let me get your guys take on something about this. So talking about pudgies, I do think that meme coins are starting to fulfill at least one of the reasons why I was really bullish on NFTs going into this year. So if you look at some of these big airdrops that know, this is the first time I feel like that I've seen this dimension is a really good example of this that gave large airdrop allocations to pudgies holders. Pudgy holders or bad kids, et cetera. And the idea is like, look, we know that we're getting sibyled here, so we might as well if we're looking out into the universe of crypto users and we're looking for communities that have some form of identification, right, and are wealthy and are going to be good potential customers that I don't already have. Well, these NFT collections actually kind of look like that.
00:09:06.282 - 00:09:49.480, Speaker B: And I don't know if this is true, so someone fact checked me on this, but I saw that some crazy percentage of pudgy holders actually ended up just staking their dimension airdrop. So in my mind, that was one of the big reasons why you wanted to hold an Nft like you're probably going to get more of these free airdrops as you get a bunch of tge coming up in the next couple of months. But I think meme coins are starting to eat into some of the market share of NFTs. And the other probably larger market for NFTs is just all coins with pictures. I think that's a very real part of it. And I actually heard some speculation at this conference this week that maybe projects would actually start airdropping to memecoin holders. And I am a little bit conflicted about this.
00:09:49.480 - 00:10:22.190, Speaker B: From one sense, it probably is a really great way. It solves a lot of the problems that we were just talking about in terms of Sybil resistance, all that kind of stuff. It's probably a good way to get wider distribution and very retail participation for your airdrop. On the other hand, I'm imagining the type of person that is holding these meme coins and thinking, do I really want that? Are these the best people that I could have on my cap table, so to speak? Maybe not. I'm not 100% sure they're crypto users.
00:10:22.270 - 00:10:44.486, Speaker A: They're probably crypto native, most of them. I mean, there's maybe a world there where it could make a ton of sense, right? If it's people that you want using your product, who else is in the gutters looking up geoboat? At the very best, it's geoboted and others, but it's already your grandpa's meme.
00:10:44.518 - 00:10:45.420, Speaker B: Coin now.
00:10:47.310 - 00:11:16.818, Speaker C: And it's better than civil farmers, right? And it's different. And it will distract from, inevitably, people who are upset about whatever allocation they got. And yeah, I think these ways to think about targeting on airdrops are kind of fun. We talked about even, like, looking at podcast audiences. How about it's a bit self serving, yes, but I think that's pretty targeted as well. So, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how that evolves.
00:11:16.914 - 00:11:56.466, Speaker A: We were talking to this one restaking protocol, and they had mentioned that they were thinking about using restaking for not just for security, but more for you lock up tokens and maybe you get whitelisted for some. I can't believe I'm saying it's like meme coin presale or something like that. Right. But essentially restaking can be maybe used in different ways than what people are thinking about. It actually is like decentralized trust in a different way, where it's like trust like that, you're going to lock up this token. It's this opportunity cost that you let's assume it's ETH or solar or something. The opportunity cost is like, you are going to give this up in order to access something for a period of time.
00:11:56.466 - 00:12:08.454, Speaker A: I don't know whether that needs to be restaked or not, but essentially, it is an interesting way of thinking about maybe it also transitions us into something other than meme coins, but just like.
00:12:08.492 - 00:12:41.530, Speaker B: Every panel for the last three days, like, oh, the institutionalization of market structure. Two minutes in talking about meme coins. But that is probably a good segue here, Jim, because initially, what we wanted to do with this conversation is have a little bit of an update on the restaking ecosystem in general. And I know the two of you are just extremely, extremely deep into this ecosystem, and it feels pretty timely. I think we're having some of the large LRTs that are launching pretty soon. Ether Phi being in that bucket. There's over $10 billion worth of capital that has migrated to Eigen layer.
00:12:41.530 - 00:13:35.314, Speaker B: Looks like that's going to be up only. And there are some rumors of new challengers in the restaking arena outside of Eigen layer. And overall, the space just really feels like it is heating up and wanted to actually, before we get into some of the nitty gritty specifics around Eigen Layer, I wanted to talk to the two of you, because you've both been very involved in the progenitor of shared security on Cosmos. Right, which is interchange, I think. You know, Miles, you and I, in our app chain season, we talked about how Ethereum might be a little bit guilty of ignoring some of the lessons of Cosmos, namely interoperability as it adopted its appchain, sort of roadmap. And I would love to get a sense from the two of you about some of the lessons that you learned from the shared security side of Cosmos back in the early days and see what may or may not be applicable to Eigen layer today.
00:13:35.512 - 00:14:20.842, Speaker C: Yeah. And maybe I'll just start off by kind of giving the two forms of shared security that are either in production or in development in Cosmos, and then we can kind of compare them to eigen layer. I mean, we can talk about what's worked and what hasn't maybe within those early versions. Right. And so the first form is, what you mentioned is interchange security or replicated security. And the first version of replicated security was implemented on the Cosmos hub and with V one of replicated security. If governance approves a new consumer chain, the entire validator set of the cosmos hub, and all of the economic stake behind that is then restaked and now operating.
00:14:20.842 - 00:15:08.474, Speaker C: So the validator is now operating a new chain, and all of the economic stake is restaked to that chain. Mesh security is kind of on the other end of the spectrum, where it is purely the restaking of economic security. So let's say I am on osmosis. I've delegated to a validator on osmosis, say figment, and osmosis enters a mesh agreement with another cosmos chain, let's call it axilar. I'm purely taking the economic value of my stake and redelegating that to a validator of my choice on the other chain. And with mesh security, it can be bilateral. So, meaning, like these two chains can secure each other, or it can be just one direction.
00:15:08.474 - 00:15:50.460, Speaker C: So a provider chain providing economic security to a consumer chain. And maybe compare that to maybe. I'll also say that more recently, there is a V two of interchange security called partial set replicated security. And with this, it is, okay, the cosmos hub has a new consumer chain. It's not going to make all of the validator set opt in to running a validator for this new chain. Validators can opt in basically on their own if they think they can be economically profitable. And I think, Jim, I'll let you speak to why that makes a lot of sense based off of V one.
00:15:50.460 - 00:16:32.890, Speaker C: But quickly, just to compare to eigen layer, it's kind of a mix, right? It is opt in from the validator level and opt in from the staker level. Right. And maybe the one difference is, as a staker, you are delegating to an operator, and then basically, you let the operator decide which AvSs it's going to support, and it's actually going to run the hardware software of those AVSs. And so it's a mix of both. All right. ICs V One would never work on Ethereum because you would never get all of these validators. It's not an active set of just 150.
00:16:32.890 - 00:16:52.426, Speaker C: Right? It's thousands. And so maybe I'll pause there. And then, Jim, you've been very close to ICSV one. You've written about, okay. What can we learn from it? And maybe you can speak to a few of the lessons there that I think we are thinking about a lot as we're looking at Eigen layer in its early stages.
00:16:52.618 - 00:17:38.480, Speaker A: Yeah, Miles, you've been really instrumental, and I think in kind of educating a lot of folks on the Eigen layer side of what AVs are going to need to do. And so the ABS equivalent in cosmos, as you mentioned, is consumer chains, they're consuming security and presumably paying some sort of reward or some sort of rent or something. Lease payments to the Cosmos hub and in the form of atom stakers. So they'll receive some revenue from that or some additional payments for that. ICS has been like, I was really excited about ICs when it was first announced it was part of the Atom 2.0 white paper. It was like the part that I was actually the most interested in.
00:17:38.480 - 00:18:49.730, Speaker A: We've seen shared security in multiple levels, right? Actually, polka dot and parachain auctions is probably the first real big example of what shared security can look like, where essentially the more dot that you have, you'll win an opportunity to be part of the shared security of the Polkadot network. There's a single kind of relay or collater that helps to transmit blocks to the Polkadot relay chain. And in exchange for these massive amounts of dot that were locked up, especially initially, these teams would distribute it kind of in the form of emissions. It's slightly different, right? It's like sort of payment for this. But you would issue tokens to dot token holders. Dot token holders on the flip side were not staking their dot, right? It wasn't a liquid staking token. So there was an opportunity cost, right? You thought that the yield that you were going to receive, or like the inflation or whatever you want to call it, emissions that you were going to receive from this parachain, maybe not one to one, sometimes 20 to one, sometimes 100 to one, was going to be more valuable than just staking your dot.
00:18:49.730 - 00:19:26.082, Speaker A: And the crazy thing about parachain, parachain auction is great lesson learned, right? If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it. And I hope sincerely that we are learning every single time and getting better and smarter about this stuff. Parachain auction slots, first of all, the very first one was at the time of dot to win a slot because there was like a slot auction every three weeks. So first of all, it just limited innovation, right? You couldn't have a permissionlessly tap into the economic security of polka dot. They would have one every three weeks. It was this massive event. I think Acala had like $1.3
00:19:26.082 - 00:19:44.402, Speaker A: billion of dot locked up and then it was locked up for like two years, right? I mean, holy inefficiency of market structure, right? Just like, wow, this is crazy. Some of them, a year later went for $55,000 nuts.
00:19:44.466 - 00:19:48.566, Speaker B: I think miles and I both aped a caller, actually. And I have no idea what even.
00:19:48.588 - 00:19:53.378, Speaker C: Happened to that we might have some dot that's now unlocked from the line.
00:19:53.404 - 00:19:54.554, Speaker A: It might still be there.
00:19:54.672 - 00:19:55.754, Speaker C: I forgot about it.
00:19:55.792 - 00:19:57.020, Speaker B: Anyways, go ahead.
00:19:59.230 - 00:20:30.934, Speaker A: The market was super early and very nascent, and it really kind of stifled innovation at a point in time where Polkadot possibly could have had a bunch of parachains on. It could have been like the shared security network and layer. And a lot of these parachains look like L two s. So a couple of years passed by and cosmos hub comes in and says like, hey, we want to do this shared security protocol. We're going to call it ICs. JQuan actually had actually written a GitHub, which is relatively legible to an extent in 2021. So he'd been thinking about this for a really long time.
00:20:30.934 - 00:21:23.542, Speaker A: And he talks about V one, he talks about V two, and he actually talks about mesh security, too, which he calls Sonny's version, interestingly enough. And there's some pretty good insights in there. The benefits of consumer chains, I think, are we can talk about the benefits and we can talk about some of the costs and some of the challenges there. I wrote this crazy article about it and I was like, this is very relevant because what I'm noticing is that people are kind of staying in their own lanes. Maybe Solana people sometimes stay in their Solana lane, maybe Ethereum people sometimes stay in their Ethereum lane, maybe cosmos people are staying in their cosmos lane. And we're launching, this Eigen layer is launching on Ethereum and just reaching out to some folks and being like, hey, are you paying attention to what's happening on replicated security right now? Because you have test in prod right now, you have a real live version of shared security. And if you just pay attention a little bit, you'll see the pain points, you'll see what's not working over there right now and what they're going to have to try to fix.
00:21:23.542 - 00:21:33.046, Speaker A: And you can actually not repeat those mistakes. We don't have to learn those mistakes over again, right over in Ethereum. So it's been really interesting.
00:21:33.228 - 00:22:01.502, Speaker B: That's just such a critical point. I love that you said that because you hear that very often, there's this pretty predominant take in crypto, which is, look, there are too many things going on. I can only focus in my own lane, and I want to stay in this ecosystem. And I just think if you do that, if you look across all these ecosystems, I mean, there's so much design convergence. Miles, you and I have talked, that was basically thesis of the Cosmo season, but you see, we're going to talk a little bit about Salana l two s later as well. You're seeing bitcoin l two s. Like Celestia is starting to look very similar to Ethereum.
00:22:01.502 - 00:22:12.694, Speaker B: All these different roadmaps are converging. And I think it would be really silly to not look at the lessons that folks have learned on other chains in the past. Just could not. Plus one, that attitude more. Totally agree with it.
00:22:12.812 - 00:22:52.830, Speaker C: I agree. And maybe to double click on what are some qualities that are common qualities between, say, like polka dot parachains and ICSV one that we can identify as, okay, this was less than ideal. This should be improved upon. And to me, the two are like when you have an overly rigid structure. And I think that is reflected by, I think, what Jim alluded to with the parachain auctions and kind of a set schedule. I think the second piece, this, this whole idea of all these validators are not created equal. Right.
00:22:52.830 - 00:23:32.846, Speaker C: There are definitely economies of scales within the validator industry broadly. Right. And I think there is a world where if you were to say, combine, let's say, partial set security with mesh security, you could get the best of both worlds, where you could have the operators that can profitably opt in to run these chains and then operators that don't are able to. If you're delegating to one of them at the bottom of the set, that doesn't mean you have to miss out on this extra yield. You should be able to use mesh security to delegate your stake to one of the operators that is opted in. Right. What other big ones are there?
00:23:32.868 - 00:24:14.830, Speaker A: Jim, I feel like there's some super basic things. I think when it came to replicated security, like onboarding process, a lot of it is just like standards and processes. How do you do this? And how do you do this in a thoughtful way? And what are the expectations and managing expectations? Right. We have $11 billion of ETH restaked on Eigen layer right. Now. We argue a little bit about what's supply and what's demand, but the question is whether there's enough abs that even need this or can actually incentivize this in a proper way. That doesn't mean that Eigen layer is somehow subsidizing people to continue to restake their ETH in Cosmos because of the replicated security model.
00:24:14.830 - 00:24:57.302, Speaker A: You have 180 validators on Cosmos hub, and they're forced to support any consumer chain that launches. Right. So that's $4 billion of economic security like staked atom. Right. And when you look at the two consumer chains that exist today, you have neutron and you have stride, right? No judgment on the projects or the teams or anything like that. Talking with a collective friend of ours like Xerox Crane, he'd say it's very hard to incentivize a big thing with a little thing, right? And so the questions of managing expectations, everyone's sort of like vibing into the first couple consumer chains and saying, yeah, let's just do this. This is going to be a great experiment.
00:24:57.302 - 00:26:15.614, Speaker A: This is going to be great for everyone. And nobody really looked at the proposal standards. What do we expect to be a good amount of actual compensation for this economic security for this validator set? Are validators being properly compensated? Are some running at a loss? What is the fee split? What is the yield split? Is all of the staking rewards? Is it going to Cosmos hub? Adam stakers, are you going to be able to do dual staking these RL ones? Will you be able to stake, like, your stride token or your neutron token? What's the fee split? And we started to see some of these, and people were just like, there was no guidance, right? And so neutron essentially had to figure it out on their own. And they had to put the first proposal together kind of on their own. And they threw out some numbers. They were like, I think it's like, somewhere around, like, we're going to give 25% of transaction fees, we're going to give 50% of MEV and we're not going to have any inflation, right? Okay, that might work, but what is the value of neutron's token and how much transaction fees are we really like? What kind of transactions are we actually looking at here in volume? And you start running the numbers. And I ran the numbers and I was trying to explain the numbers to some people and I was like, this is no offense.
00:26:15.614 - 00:26:29.306, Speaker A: This is terrible for atom stakers. And these validators, especially the validators were running one network, now they're running two validators. You can tell me it's easy. You can tell me. It's hard to run a validator on Cosmos hub or Cosmos. I don't care. It still costs money.
00:26:29.306 - 00:27:21.546, Speaker A: And the revenue was like, for one atom at $10, you can expect somewhere around fractions of a penny for one atom staked, right? And so you're just like, who is making money on this? Who is actually incentivized to actually do this and to support this and to make sure that neutron doesn't go down or that neutron is supported. The operators are not incentivized. Telling them that they're already getting paid in atom tokens is not something that anyone wants to hear like, hey, I'll give you twice the work. You're going to work 80 hours this week. I'm going to keep paying you the same salary going forward is not a great incentive model. It doesn't really align the interests of the stakers, the consumer chain, the producer chain, and also the operators that are actually trying to run businesses on this. It's just kind of unfortunately probably not enough.
00:27:21.728 - 00:28:25.790, Speaker C: And it was more like set it and kind of forget it. That was the other issue. And of course the price of the reward tokens could fluctuate a ton, right? We saw stride has like ten X in the past six months. That probably should also be able to be factored into these things, right? The amount that one of these projects pays out should not be extraordinarily unprofitable for everybody in the bear markets and then maybe too profitable in the bull markets. And I think the other point you made there is that to me, I think the operators get kind of a raw deal. And I am starting to see this in eigen layer as well, that I don't think enough of the AVs side or the restaker, the depositor side are actually thinking about the constraints of the operators. Because the difference of taking on additional slashing risk is very different than running new hardware and having humans operating these networks.
00:28:25.790 - 00:29:06.262, Speaker C: The cost is linear for operators as they take on more and more. But the cost is not. It's hard to quantify the cost to stakers, right? If it's just additional slashing risk. And really the only way that operators are paid are via commission fee, right? So it's usually 5% or 10%. And I think that that should be either a floating commission rate or that should be separated out entirely, right. I think you can predict how much operators it's going to cost operators to run these networks. And you can make sure that they're profitable.
00:29:06.262 - 00:29:20.142, Speaker C: And that can be like a totally separate payment stream and consideration than how much do I need to pay depositors or stakers in terms of yield uplift for them to take this on?
00:29:20.196 - 00:29:52.614, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the title sponsor of this season of Bell Curve, the wormhole foundation. Now, if you are an on chain user, which I bet you are, if you're listening to Bell Curve, you know that the cross chain experience in crypto still sucks. Let's just call a spade a spade. We talk about it on this program all the time. Interop is still a big problem, which is why we specifically wanted to team up with the wormhole foundation. They are a decentralized interop platform that powers multi chain applications and bridges. So that could be anything from defi to NFTs, governance, oracles and more.
00:29:52.614 - 00:30:24.398, Speaker B: So if you are a developer and you're building cross chain assets, apps or data or anything like that, I highly recommend that you click the link at the bottom of this episode and go check out to see what you can build on wormhole and wormhole. First of all, this is a fun team. They did something really cool with us. You can actually go and click the link at the bottom of the screen, which is going to send you to a landing page where you can claim your own unique wormhole NFT. So we're doing this with me and we're doing this with Jason, my co founder. So help a brother out. It's a super cool NFT, I promise.
00:30:24.398 - 00:31:01.226, Speaker B: Go click the link at the bottom of this episode and fill out your poap. Get your free NFT and if you're a dev, head over to wormhole and check out to see what cool cross chain stuff you can build. Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by swell, a liquid restaking protocol in the issuer of the R suite liquid restaking token. Now, if you're a listener of Bell Curve, you know that I am just so fascinated by restaking and liquid restaking. I think it is going to be one of the most important trends in Ethereum and I am really excited for the benefit that it unlocks both users and also Ethereum, the protocol itself. Now disclaimer, whenever there's yield involved in a product, do your own research. This is not financial advice.
00:31:01.226 - 00:31:26.934, Speaker B: You guys know the drill. But swell is a great team. They have a non custodial product and they are mission driven on giving you the best liquid staking experience. If you take one benefit away from using liquid restaking, make it be capital efficiency. Now you can earn passive yield from Ethereum, you can earn yield from multiple actively validated services that stack on top of that. And then you can still use Rsweep as collateral in Defi. And because I know y'all are a bunch of degens, there's a points angle here as well.
00:31:26.934 - 00:31:45.978, Speaker B: But in swell we call them pearls. So pearls equal points. And if you stake your ETH with swell, you can earn pearls and future Eigen layer rewards. When there is a token generation event, you can swap your pearls or swell tokens head over, click the link at the bottom of this episode. Again, just pause what you're doing right now. Go click the link at the bottom of this episode. Check out swell.
00:31:45.978 - 00:31:46.526, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:31:46.548 - 00:31:46.878, Speaker C: Later.
00:31:46.964 - 00:32:19.574, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, Flood is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because Flood is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season. And this is relevant for both traders and devs. So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to Floodswap and start trading because they solve three massive problems. One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run MeV free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price.
00:32:19.574 - 00:32:50.994, Speaker B: So head over to Flood swap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes. We're going to send you right there for the devs out there you can leverage flood's flexible hooks, allowing you to make swapping a first class primitive by adding custom order types like twaps. Or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of that MEP. If you want to reach out to them, go to devs at Flood bid or just jump right in the discord. All right, guys, thanks very much. Appreciate you. Flood, let me try to, because I want to zoom out here and just explain for the audience as well.
00:32:50.994 - 00:33:40.194, Speaker B: I think what we're talking about here is, okay, everyone's very excited. There have been multiple iterations of shared security by Polkadot interchange security and cosmos. Now, the newest one is Eigen layer. And I think what you guys are both describing is that everyone thinks that that's an extremely good idea in principle, but the actual details matter and especially the economics have not been very well thought out. And whether or not this is a good deal ultimately for the supply side of this, and this is kind of what we're seeing right in Eigen layer, that we've seen a ton of money east stakers pour in, we can speculate as to why that is. Probably they're chasing, doing what the degens are doing and try to farm the Eigen airdrop or various other types of airdrops. So we can question how healthy that incentivization is from the marketplace itself, which is a huge factor here.
00:33:40.194 - 00:34:21.694, Speaker B: But it might just like maybe just to put a bow on the lessons from the ICS part of like one thing that I would also add is, well, I would just ask you guys, do you think interchange security as it exists in cosmos today is successful or not? Because one of the challenges that I've also thought of, I think you guys have loosely alluded to this, but there's also an adverse selection problem when it comes to consumer chains as well. I think that's not like stride and neutron are both phenomenal projects, but I'm not sure they really did it for the economic side of things. Right. They kind of did it. There's like a loose alignment cultural reason that both neutron and stride did this. That was more a business strategy thing. So I don't know, I guess let's put a bow on the lessons part before we kind of move more deeply into Eigen layer and get.
00:34:21.732 - 00:35:04.086, Speaker C: Yeah, I can give a super quick take. I think they succeeded on the tech and V one is like a fine V one, V two, they've shipped very fast. I think where it's fallen short is, to your point, like the nontechnical stuff, just having the restaking pipes itself does not mean success. There's the qualities of the atom token in terms of market cap liquidity, volatility. The closer you are to something like ETH in terms of all of those things, the better. And obviously Adam is very far away from that. And then there is kind of a branding alignment sort of aspect to it that I think has also been kind of a headwind for the hub.
00:35:04.086 - 00:35:05.770, Speaker C: But Jim, curious to your take?
00:35:05.840 - 00:35:52.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I think all of those things are accurate. I mean, the other thing I'd say along alignment, especially with Cosmos hub, is that it's like this application specific blockchain and they have liquidity. Right? They have Adam tokens. And one of the things that's been really interesting is there is actually business partnerships that can be spurred from this, right? There is a treasury and that treasury can be used to deposit Adam into amms, right? That atom can be used through governance proposals to liquid stake on stride and then to provide a liquidity pool between Adam and staked St. Adam. And so there are ways in which you say, hey, this is kind of like a rising tide lifts all boats sort of scenario that can be very much more played into. It requires governance to be thoughtful and actually positive in certain ways.
00:35:52.782 - 00:36:38.758, Speaker A: And one last thing I would say is that one thing I did, which I really don't recommend anyone doing unless they love being just shit on generally, is there was sorry for swearing. I posted this article about the challenges and the benefits to ICs and replicated security. Then what I decided to do was, here are how to fix it. And rather than write an article about that, I posted it on the Cosmos forum. You have to love self pain and inflicted pain in order to do something like that. So it was an interesting experience. I probably won't do it again, but I tried to come up with solutions to these problems and thought that there are actual, real intangible benefits that can exist.
00:36:38.758 - 00:37:04.594, Speaker A: But you have to kind of put in the planning work, too. It's not just about onboarding. It's also about what the offboarding standards look like and what are the processes by which people get onboarded and offboarded. And we evaluate whether something is successful or unsuccessful. When do we cut ties? When do we dock our boat to it? So I think it's really an interesting. There's a lot of learning lessons, and I'm excited to talk a little bit more about what Eigen is doing.
00:37:04.792 - 00:37:33.382, Speaker B: Me, too. Can we get into the weeds of eigen layers? So, obviously, there's been an enormous amount of demand from the depositor standpoint. I don't even know what the latest numbers are. I keep saying 10 billion. I know across 10 billion in deposits at one point probably is higher than that. Now, what I would be curious to understand is what does the abs side of the marketplace look like? When we were at miles, I know you organized a phenomenal know club abs at East Denver. And just speaking to.
00:37:33.382 - 00:38:13.830, Speaker B: I don't know how accurate these numbers are, but just talking to some folks, there are a bunch of abs there. But my sense of the size of that market wasn't hundreds of protocols. It was probably sub 30 and sub 30 Avs. And quality was probably much lower than even that. And I also think in terms of ultimately, what's driving this. My sense, Jim, you're maybe alluding at the beginning that not everything is about the economic security value proposition here. But even when you're talking about something like, there are two other elements, which is one, this sort of mushy question of alignment, ecosystem alignment.
00:38:13.830 - 00:38:56.278, Speaker B: And then I also think there's probably an element here of maybe buying into a narrative. We saw some of this where some of the stranded L ones that didn't necessarily have product market fit back when there was a new l two launching every day. I guess there still is a new l two launching every day, but we'rebranding from mid tier l one into the roll up roadmap for Ethereum. And it feels like some of the stuff that's going on in the Abs and restaking world is we're not just some middleware solution. We're in Avs, jazz fingers, that kind of thing. So give us a sense, though, being a little bit more boots on the ground of what the demand side of this shared security marketplace looks like.
00:38:56.364 - 00:39:49.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that number is probably pretty on. I think there's probably ten to 15 large. You could call them large projects, like well funded projects that will have high market caps. And then there's kind of a long tail in development that absolutely could be in the same boat in a few months. And on the ABs side, the rubber is starting to hit the road in terms of, okay, how much are we going to pay? What do we actually want here? Do we want this permissionless operator set? No, that's a little scary out of the gate. So we want to pick operators that we know we like, we can get on the phone with, and then how much do we want to pay? It kind of reminds me of where ICSV one was at beforehand. It was like, let's just throw stuff at the wall.
00:39:49.420 - 00:40:40.680, Speaker C: And that's okay. That is what I think we all expected. And I think what's interesting is that we're starting to see some of the first actual announcements of LRTs committing capital to AVSs now. And I think that all those negotiations are kind of happening off chain right now. And what's kind of funny to me is that we'll say, like, okay, we are committing a billion dollars of economic security across maybe this LRT or like, two or three LRTs. We've got the guaranteed that we'll have this for, say, at least six months, right? We don't want more than this number. We don't want less than this number.
00:40:40.680 - 00:41:56.082, Speaker C: And so we would need you guys to make sure that this is kind of a siphoned off capital, right? So new deposits are not coming towards our pooled security, because the reason for that quickly is just, if you have unlimited capital come in, the yield is diluted for everybody, and then you probably have a lot of volatility in terms of people withdrawing. And what's kind of interesting is that there's nothing actually on chain to enforce these SLas, these requirements. And so it's like, okay, well, what if there's some black swan event and there's a huge withdrawal? All these things just kind of go away, right? And then I think from the really interesting one is these duration requirements that I think make sense. Like, if I was an abs, I would want to know, okay, this is locked in for this much time and I don't have to worry about it again. We set our economics and we can forget it. But from the LRT or any sort of depositor side, that ends up with a very different sort of set of dynamics than, say, what you do when you deposit into an LST. Right.
00:41:56.082 - 00:42:27.350, Speaker C: There's going to be now a lot of complexity in terms of balance sheet management for LRTs. How do you support withdrawals? Right. If half of your deposits are technically locked up according to these agreements, and maybe those agreements eventually come on chain. Right. So they're actually enforced and then what do you do? Right. So, yeah, those are some of the observations in the early days. Maybe the last one is that I think there's $11 billion of deposits.
00:42:27.350 - 00:43:20.422, Speaker C: A lot of it is in LRts. And AVs for the most part, are looking at, okay, the easiest way to do this is to have, I want a permissioned operator set to start off with. And the easiest way to get to a set of high quality operators and a ton of capital is to go to LRTs. Right now, I think ABs are mainly working with LRTs as the fastest way to get this economic security and the operators they want. And in general, the pricing power. The leverage right now is with the ABs side because there's $11 billion of deposits and the yield uplift on that $11 billion is based off of what AVss are willing to pay. And there's relatively low number of super high quality Avs.
00:43:20.422 - 00:43:39.262, Speaker C: And so they have all the leverage at this point. And I think that makes sense. It's going to change, too, because, Jim, you remember, like stride and neutron had the leverage in those conversations because this was really the new big thing for the hub and they needed to get it started. Right. So I'll pause there, but curious to hear your reaction.
00:43:39.406 - 00:44:22.906, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the more interesting things to think about is why are, like announcing these partnerships and why are ABs is going to these LRTs. And when you think about maybe three categories of restakers right now on Ethereum, you probably have three groups. Right? You have retail, you have whales that are throwing $250,000,000 in. In a single transaction who have probably their own incentives, and then you have LRTs. Right. And if you're an ABS developer right now and you're trying to get economic security and restaked ETH kind of delegated, let's say. I know it's pooled security initially, but delegated to your abs so that you can launch on day one when Eigen layer launches.
00:44:22.906 - 00:45:12.318, Speaker A: Or like week one, when Eigen layer launches. You cannot talk to retail as a collective, right? There's no concentration of ETH that you can get restaked and committed to you in any sort of meaningful way. Sure, you can go talk to a whale if you think that that's a better idea, or funds that have a ton of ETH if you think that's a better idea. But presumably the one place that you can go and whose business it is to have an old restaked ETH and to actually figure out places and abs to delegate it to are LRTs. Right. So in some ways, it's like just the natural way that if this thing is the cold start problem of how do I start and get economic security and e three staked on my protocol, I guess I'm going to have to go to where the biggest pool is that has a single decision maker or a team of decision makers that can actually make a decision. Say, yeah, we'll support you on day one.
00:45:12.318 - 00:45:51.354, Speaker A: So there's a ton of questions about. I don't know whether Abs are asking LRTs any of these questions. A lot of the ones that you mentioned, Miles, I don't know whether LRTs are asking abs any of these questions, because there's like a ton of stuff, right. I think number one is like, you touched on the validator or the operators. One interesting thing and insight that we get at Figment Capital is that we are closely connected with Figment, the proof of stake infrastructure provider. We're separate, but we're connected with them and we talk to them quite frequently. And one of the areas I think has kind of gone, it's actually one of the interesting, more interesting things about replicated security v.
00:45:51.354 - 00:45:55.962, Speaker A: One, which is that it forced all the validators to join on day one.
00:45:56.016 - 00:45:56.198, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:56.224 - 00:46:12.670, Speaker A: You couldn't opt out. And when you're forced in, I have to do this. I'm not making a decision. The operator is not making a decision to subject or to expose the staked assets to these other slashing conditions that other operators didn't.
00:46:12.750 - 00:46:13.138, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:13.224 - 00:46:50.430, Speaker A: Once you start going down this road where operators are making decisions on behalf of their restakers, you look a lot like a fiduciary, right? Like you're entering into. You're adding risk to ETH that's been staked to you. These are not what they signed up for. Maybe initially, maybe you start going a little bit more long tail because the yield looks better. It's a little riskier of an abs for protocol. And so when you give validators, especially institutional validators, the option to opt in, a lot of them are not going to take it. And so what wound up happening, which is really interesting, is that you have these abs that are looking for like hey, we're going to run testnet.
00:46:50.430 - 00:47:22.682, Speaker A: What else do offer, right? ABS is like we're going to run testnet. And maybe one of the questions that we're going to go to operators like we would in another pseudo network and they would say like, hey, we're going to run testnet. Would you like to join and participate? We're going to be in Abs on eigen layer and the operators saying, don't talk to me. We're just validators as a service. We're just a validation as a service. Here, you better go talk to our boss and our boss in this case because we're not going to make any of these decisions ourselves. We don't want to be held liable for any of the decisions that we make.
00:47:22.682 - 00:47:44.962, Speaker A: We're not going to essentially put our reputation up with some of these Abs is. Then all of a sudden what you're doing is you're going to go speak to the, like we're going to contract with the LRTs. The LRTs are going to tell us where to go. They're going to tell us when to go there and we will. There's sort of this weird dynamic right now, especially before anything has launched, right. Once things launch, it gets different.
00:47:45.016 - 00:48:02.646, Speaker C: I think that's how you stay a service provider, right. And not a fiduciary, you know, working for the LRT. Governance of the LRT is really making those decisions. And that is like a weird subtle difference that I think is huge. Right. Interesting. Sorry, Mike, go for it.
00:48:02.668 - 00:48:46.158, Speaker B: No, I want to move us into the LRT part of this discussion. And just for folks who might be a little bit less in the weeds than the two of you, I think what we're talking about is a legal liability in the cosmos case where everyone was opt in. Basically, if you want to be this participant in the network, you have to do this as opposed to when an operator starts to make a choice about which service it's going to participate in and essentially constructs something that looks an awful lot like an investment products, there are different risk returns. It almost starts to look like a basket of bonds or something like that. Any regulator would look at that and say you're making investment decisions on the basis of folks whose capital you could be managing. Right. And so moving that up to the LRT feels critical.
00:48:46.158 - 00:48:47.622, Speaker B: I want to close the book on.
00:48:47.676 - 00:49:31.458, Speaker C: Just one more point on that, if it's all right. I think it would be interesting, Jim, with the Cosmos hub, you mentioned you submitted a proposal, right, to a governance forum where everybody is kind of in one place and can see it and make improvements on it. And then when new consumer chains come forward, they submit a proposal to governance, right? And that's a single place where all the operators and stakers can kind of see what's going on. And I think Eigen layer is going to need something like that, right, where it's a governance forum that's purely for new AVs proposals. And it's kind of like a request for, quote. Like RFP is like, hey, we're new. We want to come in here.
00:49:31.458 - 00:50:06.574, Speaker C: We don't care if it's an LRT or if you're a regular operator. Here's what we're looking for. Here's the economics that we offer. Come opt in if you want to. And it's like more out in the open, right? But it is like a consolidated place where everybody has kind of a view into what's going on. And I think that's probably one of the first things that needs to happen here because LRTs, in the absence of that, are the only other versions of that where you can go to one place and engage with operators and stakers. Sorry.
00:50:06.772 - 00:50:08.186, Speaker A: That was a blessing.
00:50:08.298 - 00:50:28.786, Speaker B: The RFP process that you're outlining there is giving me this flashback to my days as a consultant. Basically probably 50% of what we did. I was at this boutique agency and we focused an enormous amount on procurement. When I was there, it was like 70% of the. We would do this with actually mostly like large. Miles, we talked about this so many times. You know, I'm going to stay steel.
00:50:28.786 - 00:51:13.394, Speaker B: Helping conglomerates purchase like hundreds of millions of dollars of steel and running these incredibly sophisticated RFP processes to break down costs and get really into the nitty gritty of the economics across every player of the value chain. Honestly, I will say an enormous area that crypto has to improve on is the sophistication of RFP processes. It's like so bad, so bad. But I want to get deeper on the LRTs, but I want to put a bookmark for folks who, if you have one sort of takeaway around what the demand side is of this marketplace is now ultimately, maybe to editorialize a little bit. My own opinion here, it feels light, right? It feels light. Miles, you know, I've debated back and forth about this. I think we're maybe heading into a bull market always.
00:51:13.394 - 00:51:34.460, Speaker B: I'm kind of more on the side that demand will come ultimately. It always tends to. It surprises you to the upside. Like, just having tried to business plan across these cycles, I always underestimate the sheer amount of demand that will come into the market. But is it fair to say that most of the capital that's moving into Eigen layer today is chasing farming? And it's not like AbS yields here.
00:51:35.550 - 00:52:07.030, Speaker C: I wouldn't actually frame. I think the demand side for Eigen layer is actually pretty healthy. Like, look, ICs had two consumer chains. There's already 20 to 40 teams building on it. It's more that supply side is so absurdly overweighted. I think they're doing great in terms of the amount of adoptions of abs. I just don't think anybody expected $11 billion of economic stake locked up in Eigen layer at this point.
00:52:07.030 - 00:52:34.220, Speaker C: And frankly, even though the demand side is coming along really well, there's not that much spend to really make it worth from a pure yield standpoint, airdrops aside, longer term, we're going to need hundreds of AVs to support $11 billion. And. Yeah, so maybe just stop depositing and we'll have no more issues.
00:52:34.750 - 00:52:54.930, Speaker B: I want to get a sense of the LRT part of this. So this is the liquid restaking. Miles. I'm going to put a feather in both of our caps. We did an episode on this like three, four months ago, which was, I think, a little ahead of its time, actually. Since then, there have been a whole bunch of LRTs that have moved from sort of this background thing that people assumed was coming into the spotlight. Many prominent teams.
00:52:54.930 - 00:53:30.222, Speaker B: And I want to get a sense of, Miles, you actually wrote something up, like sort of a five page treatise here on how to look at LSTs versus LRTs. And I think a lot of these discussions, like you hear a lot of people say, actually, liquid restaking tokens are going to compete with the likes of steeth. But I think you at least see these as very different products and the competitive vector or the vectors that these two types of projects are going to compete on as being super different. So can you just give folks a sense of how do you think about LSTs from a high level, then? How does that compare to LRTs as a product?
00:53:30.276 - 00:54:28.402, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I'll try to give, like the Tldr. I think I'd first off say that they are going after the same market, which is ETH holders that are looking to basically get some yield on their ETH either by staking or by staking and restaking, while also retaining some level of liquidity on that E. But I think that they are very different in terms of their designs and their value problem. And I think at the end of the day, they are different products that really solve different, sort of really offer solutions to two different things. So I'll say LSTs are really homogeneous by design, right? They're all doing slightly different ways of doing the same job, which is just securing Ethereum. They don't compete on yield, right.
00:54:28.402 - 00:55:01.040, Speaker C: If they did, then Lido would not be number one. They compete, in my opinion, basically to come as close as possible to reaching parity with ETH in terms of moneyness. Right. So can I go sell this if I need liquidity right away, can I go use this in DfI? I think we'll see more and more is can I use this as gas on L two s, right. And they have really just one asset on the balance sheet. It's ETH, right.
00:55:02.850 - 00:55:11.422, Speaker A: They also issue more ETH. They issue the staking rewards every 24 hours so that it tries to stay in parity as well.
00:55:11.476 - 00:56:07.570, Speaker C: Exactly. So they track to the price of ETH. The market pretty much knows how to price in whatever smart contract risk or say like withdrawal period dynamics. And that to me is, okay, we're trying to be Internet money, especially on L two s, right? And then you look at LRTs and to me it's like the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of just how heterogeneous these things are going to look in terms of so many different elements of their design and operations and really what is also the underlying. Right. And so starting off with like, okay, do they just take ETH like native ETH as collateral and stake it and then restake it? Or are they accepting this is the assets side of the balance sheet, a bunch of LSTs and ETH, right. That matters for pricing.
00:56:07.570 - 00:56:43.710, Speaker C: They will all have slightly different or very different AVs restaking selections. That matters from a risk standpoint, right. They will have different ways of handling rewards. Some of them are going to actually just hold the rewards of these native staking reward tokens. Like Avs shitcoin. Like one through ten will be on the balance sheet along with the restaked ETH, right. Some of them are going to sell those rewards before they get brought back into the protocol, rebalanced and compounded.
00:56:43.710 - 00:57:24.202, Speaker C: And then some of them are just going to hold a whole lot of just regular staked ETH on the balance sheet to sort of float around the ETH price. Right. So it's not fully deployed. And then the last thing I think is the most hairy one is actually the duration. And we touched on this earlier, but the duration of these restaking agreements, that's going to be really hard to support when you're trying to compete directly with steeth. And so I think the more that if you were an LRT trying to compete with steeth, you would want to try to appeal to everybody. You would want to accept as many types of collateral as possible.
00:57:24.202 - 00:58:11.994, Speaker C: You'd want to come up with an ABS mix that more or less can satisfy the whole market in terms of risk preference. And I just think the more that you try to do these things, the worse you actually are at any of them. Right. So by accepting a bunch of LST collateral, you're not going to be able to reach the super conservative depositors that don't want their collateral commingled with that and socializing the slashing risk with things they would never touch on their own. There's going to be people that are happy to lock up their ETH for two years. Right. If that means higher returns, that could be like sort of a fixed income or some sort of longer duration product, right? But the more you try to do that with folks that want their capital right away, the more complicated it gets.
00:58:11.994 - 00:58:56.870, Speaker C: And then you could end up with some really unhappy customers. And so what I see the LRT side moving towards is just having a lot less network effects at the asset level, meaning each particular LRT will never have the sort of network effects that steath does. Just because it's not going to be really used as an asset, I don't think they're going to be very good at that. They're not going to attract the price of ETH. It'd be like, kind of a nightmare for an LRT to be used as gas. Imagine dealing with that. And so I think you could have winners at the entity level, sort of like fidelity and Blackrock are winners for mutual funds and have a family of different products that basically appeal to different user preferences.
00:58:56.870 - 00:59:18.350, Speaker C: That's kind of where I see this going. I think the challenge is that the more assets you launch, the more expensive it is to say, keep enough liquidity on each one or something like that. So that's generally where I think a lot of the market is kind of, like, missing right now. But I'd love to be wrong, so please push back on anything.
00:59:18.500 - 00:59:32.466, Speaker A: So just one thing. I mentioned that you pay out the rewards every 24 hours. That's like, for the lido model, right? There's rewards bearing, and then there's rewards based, like liquid staking. Some of them compound where one LST equals one point x amount.
00:59:32.568 - 00:59:32.834, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:32.872 - 00:59:34.610, Speaker C: Rebasing or non rebasing.
00:59:36.470 - 01:00:37.090, Speaker A: We actually invested in one LRT, so we invested in Renzo protocol. And I think the way that we thought about it was like, number one, these can be very big, and actually, it's not winner take all, right? I think what we've seen in Lido's case, more or less, is that it's been winner take all, right? The more. The more you look like money or the more you look like ETH, the more network effects you have. And just like, the liquidity becomes deeper and deeper, and it just sort of is like us, a mile ahead of everyone else with LRTs, based on all of the sort of factors that you just described fairly well, Miles, we're going to see these compete, ideally for very different sort of use cases and very different types of customers and users. And so I do think that, generally speaking, the unlock will be whether LRTs can be used as collateral. Outside of collateral, there's like, very. I mean, you look at Lido, if you even look at SCE, what do most people do with it? I think, like, 85% to 90% of it is just sitting in people's wallets.
01:00:37.090 - 01:01:19.430, Speaker A: They just want the ability to exit when they want to exit, and actually staking is just unnecessarily difficult. On Ethereum l one, you have to run your own validator, or you have to have over 32 ETH. And this just provides a really simple solution for a lot of people who otherwise would be not able to participate. And essentially getting diluted depending on whether it's inflationary or deflationary. For LRTs, we do view this as more of a yield bearing instrument, and you're going to be able to do a lot of different things with those assets. It's going to be all over the place, and we think that it'll be probably like four or five maybe leading contenders. And then we're kind of seeing that right now, I think just in the market.
01:01:19.430 - 01:02:06.980, Speaker A: And how well so many of these protocols have been able to capture hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of ETH being restaked doesn't hurt that there's also incentives to do that through. Not only are you getting eigen points, maybe those will be worth something someday, but also these other points or these other tokens. Etherfi just launched its token, and I believe the fully delivered value is more value than Lido right now. So that's the world we're in. Welcome to the dgen side of things. But whether that makes sense or not, I'll let other people discuss.
01:02:08.070 - 01:02:46.414, Speaker B: Miles is shaking his head for those who are not following along to put a bow on this, because I want to move on to Salana l two s as well, which is interesting. You can sort of think about Steve. Miles and I did a whole season on liquid staking, and one of the big central questions there was, what does the market structure look like? It's a winner take. If not all, then win or take most market, and that is the money market, right? Money, commodity, bond, whatever. You want to lump this new stuff that we're making here in crypto, that's what it's competing on. Security, liquidity, et cetera. Those are the vectors.
01:02:46.414 - 01:03:29.242, Speaker B: The LRTs look much more like a mutual fund, and it's a total return type competition. So that actually has a very fragmented market structure. And so I know there are at least some very smart folks out there who disagree with this point of view. I'll call loosely friend of the pod, John Zetler. Shout out, John, if you're listening to this, there are different views outside of this, but I tend to agree with that as well. I think a big part of it is the homogeneity of basically what the stakers are doing in a staking pool like Lido, as opposed to just so different and heterogeneous in the LRT world. And Jim, to your point about would you accept these things as collateral? Just think about if there are 15 different LRTs, different combination of operators and Avs.
01:03:29.242 - 01:03:58.310, Speaker B: How do you even underwrite that? How do you underwrite that from a collateral standpoint? It's so much easier when it comes to steeth. Right. It's hard to see it for me as well. So I'm basically agreeing with you. I want to move on and actually spend the last, like, 15 minutes talking about something which I think is pretty interesting and has sort of gone under the radar. But Salana, l two s. So there have been some rumblings about this for a little while, whether or not l two s would ever come to Salana.
01:03:58.310 - 01:04:38.120, Speaker B: It's kind of as many things have got dragged into this whole modular versus monolithic debate. But I do think we were talking in our chat before. There have actually been a couple of protocols on Salana that have quietly launched or announced their intention to transition to a salon. L two, which I was pretty shocked, didn't get more attention and shout out to zero X research because I wouldn't have known about it unless I listen to our analysts talking about it on a podcast. But Zeta markets is doing this, and there's another protocol called graphs. Zeta makes an enormous amount of sense to me just based on their derivatives trading platform over on Salana. But what do you guys think about this idea of Solana? L two is curious to get your guys takes.
01:04:40.090 - 01:05:00.342, Speaker A: Okay, I'll go. I think it's interesting. I don't spend a ton of time in Solana land. Dougie from our team spends much more time in Solana land than I do. I think if I was going to put my. So this is probably a mid take. So just like, I'll accept that the trolling that will ensue.
01:05:00.342 - 01:05:31.782, Speaker A: But if I had to say one thing, I would say, it seems like they're coming maybe at the best time or maybe the worst possible time. We're buying liquidity fragmentation is coming to an integrated blockchain near you right now. And it's happening because it's hard. Generally speaking, there's a couple of tweets about, hey, it's hard to land transactions on chain right now for Ethereum. It's really expensive and slow, but really, it was just really expensive and I can't get my transactions through. It's not expensive on Solana. Right.
01:05:31.782 - 01:06:01.022, Speaker A: But it is taking longer than people expected. And people are having trouble getting bridged transactions through. People are having trouble minting NFts. People are getting crazy, having crazy slippage and having to enable that. And the Solana user base is accepting this partially because maybe they just don't know any better. But I think what it goes to show is that bottlenecks will exist. And as soon as bottlenecks exist, they will exist on some chain at certain points in time.
01:06:01.022 - 01:06:54.926, Speaker A: And developers are not going to just sit and wait six to nine to twelve months until everything gets fixed and fire dancer comes or someone comes to save the day. It's just like, not these people are trying to build applications and products that people want to use, and what it ultimately does is they're going to find workarounds quickly and more quickly than anyone anticipates. The market moves quick, right? This industry moves quick. And so those moments of what do people decide to do? Typically have downstream effects that honestly can influence how the ecosystem and how the network operates and is built going forward. Like I said, that's why it kind of sounds like maybe the worst time for this to be all happening on Salana is just because people will start to build l two s. Now, one of the more interesting things, and we were talking about this before, was like, when we look at Ethereum, what was Ethereum's solution to. It's too expensive, right? It's too slow.
01:06:54.926 - 01:07:30.170, Speaker A: It was like, let's just build Ethereum on top of Ethereum. And without making it any better or optimizing in any sort of way, Ethereum equivalency was considered like the holy Grail. I don't think people are thinking about building generalized smart contract platforms like SVM chains on top of Solana. Right now. What we're seeing are kind of like application specific rollups where it's a Dex or it's like, I think what grass is. I had to look it up, but it looks like it's some sort of data AI layer or something like that. And so what they're saying is, it's not that it's a dedicated block space.
01:07:30.170 - 01:08:36.946, Speaker A: Let's just ignore dedicated block space. That's like one reason why maybe people would use this, but not in this case. It's actually because of maybe throughput or just reliability, and being able to have transactions execute, maybe even in the way or the order that you want to, and making some opinionated decisions about which transactions go first and which transactions go second are less important. So ethereum equivalency, I think, was like, so what we did was we built Ethereum on top of Ethereum, and now we're talking about like l three s. And it seems very stupid. But I think really what we want to do more than anything is if there's application specific roll ups that kind of use or work on top of Salana, I could see a world where that exists and where that makes sense, where I get concerned, is on the bridging side of things, and users. And users getting rugged because of just the things that we're talking about with slippage, and users less familiar with some of these risks that are enabled when you do slippage and you get wrecked, these users are also going to have to bridge up to l two s.
01:08:36.946 - 01:08:45.934, Speaker A: And if they do that, and they don't know exactly what they're doing, and the bridges may be a multi sig, what happens in that scenario and who gets hurt?
01:08:45.982 - 01:09:26.030, Speaker B: Just to respond to Jim, something that you said about what is ultimately the reason for this. I think it looks a little unfortunate because there's a bunch of failed transactions that are happening on Solana right now. But I don't think that's what's driving this, actually. This takes so long right. I'm sure that this has been in the works for a while, but also, actually, Miles, you were at this, but we hosted a Solana research sort of meet up in hang at our offices earlier this year, and they were actually talking about something called pros here. I'm going to share my screen here. This is a very old proposal, but it's called program rebatable account write fees.
01:09:26.030 - 01:10:13.246, Speaker B: And these got proposed because we've talked on this program before how probably Solana, their fee markets are sort of broken and need an upgrade. But one of the flaws in the fee markets of Solana currently is that it's free to just write lock any account, and you can actually do it in an unlimited basis. So this was a proposal to essentially charge a fee to, right, lock an account, but the host of that account or the owner of that account would have the ability to rebate that fee. Right. So you can punish people that are just spamming contracts, and you can actually reward users that are actually trying to interact with the account in a legitimate way. And the reason for this, if you think about what this really is, this is about sovereignty and economic control of the account on a general purpose. L one.
01:10:13.246 - 01:11:02.494, Speaker B: And to maybe draw a comparison to the idea of liquid staking in general, is like liquid staking. There are a bunch of different reasons why liquid staking makes sense, and it differs based on each ecosystem. And I think for l two s, one of the differences between salon and Ethereum is that there are a couple of reasons why you'd want to do an L two. It's cheaper, you're moving a lot of the actual execution load off main chain, but also there's this kind of sovereignty reason, and a huge amount of the way that honestly app chains, the way that they deal with MEV and can extract rent and shift around their economics. That's really nice. In Ethereum land, where fees are so expensive on main chain, it's been so focused on the cost aspect, right, driving cost down. But there's really this other bucket and reason why you might want to launch an L two and not just be a smart contract on main chain, right.
01:11:02.494 - 01:11:42.950, Speaker B: And that has to do with everything that the application, like the cosmos people just saw, they were just five years too early, I think, in just the control over your UX and your ability to mitigate some of these meV economics type things. And I think that is ultimately what's going to make l two s on Salana take off and make sense. It's not going to be about cost savings probably for that reason. General purpose l two s on Salana make a lot less sense, but app specific l two s on Salana, I think makes a ton of sense. And then, Jim, to your point about learning from other ecosystems like this was kind of the fatal flaw in the roll up centric roadmap for ETH is that they just didn't account for interop whatsoever.
01:11:43.110 - 01:11:48.506, Speaker A: Thank you. I was actually going to bring that up. I was like, I just sincerely hope they work on in protocol.
01:11:48.698 - 01:12:11.862, Speaker B: So if you builder listening to this, please, for the love of God, think about interrupt. It's not like we're so early here with all these things launching. I think union or polymer are talking about IBC on Solana potentially as well. So go talk to these guys. Let's do that. PSA for Solana builders out there. Yeah.
01:12:11.996 - 01:12:50.500, Speaker C: I have a couple of quick reactions. I totally agree with you. I think the reasons across the whole space that you see activity or teams moving to l two s or moving to their own chains is either because the base layer has gotten so shitty for their users that they have to. That's where we see just general purpose l two s kind of make sense. Or you're like Dydx, you have the leverage, right, to do this, and you take a whole user base with you because you've built a huge brand. Then the third reason is just kind of to differentiate versus peers because you can get some feature that actually, I think for Zeta is even lower latency in a roll up setting. Right.
01:12:50.500 - 01:13:41.442, Speaker C: And I think it would be not a bad situation at all for Salana to have, instead of having general purpose l two s keep all the general purpose stuff on L ones. And when projects have enough leverage and can take their users to an l two, that's how you kind of let them graduate to that. And it's not going to be every project, because some projects benefit more than others from composability. Right. And so I totally expect, like, super apps at some point for the reasons that we see app chains elsewhere and really stretch what you can do with an app chain in terms of custom block building and even native smart accounts, just all these levels of extra control that you have and value capture that comes with it. It will happen. And that's a good for Salana that they graduate to a Salana L two.
01:13:41.442 - 01:14:35.278, Speaker C: I think what I'm super interested in is because we haven't really seen it yet, the trade offs that we see on Ethereum, how bad are they in a Solana setting where you have ultra fast transaction speed, low cost and finality pretty quickly. Right. Does that in itself make these interop challenges a little less scary because you can just hop in and out of them? Or even could you maybe just have these be like base roll ups or. I don't know, it could work like that. I think that maybe takes away from the value capture stamp. Yeah, I go back and forth on base roll ups all the time myself, but that's, to me, what I'm interested in is how bad is you don't have to wait seven days for coming down from an optimistic roll up. What do they look like?
01:14:35.464 - 01:14:36.054, Speaker B: Yes.
01:14:36.172 - 01:15:50.862, Speaker A: Progressive decentralization of decentralized applications ultimately leads to applications that have large user bases creating their own value accrual mechanism that doesn't share as much of it with the base layer. Cosmos was too early. I think Ethereum had an opportunity to maybe do l two s, and a lot of teams just jumped on them because it was just too expensive to operate. And I think even for Ethereum, like we were talking about before, it looks like everybody just tried to copy the EVM. And I think one of the best areas of research right now is in super optimization and evolving the EVM, which I mentioned before, David Silverman from Polygon had a tweet and I'm going to just print it on a shirt and wear it around all the conferences, which is like, evolve the EVM, right? Like the roadmap of Ethereum being a roll up centric one, essentially what it says to us is the innovation should continue at the l two layer. Don't rely on us for innovations like super deep innovations on execution any longer. You guys take the baton and run with it.
01:15:50.862 - 01:16:25.910, Speaker A: And we just really haven't seen anyone do that too much, quite honestly. They've gone for equivalency versus evolution, let's say. And that is why I'm actually really excited about the mega E team. I think they're doing something really hard. They're really focusing on providing an execution layer that will ultimately be able to compete with high throughput, like high frequency l two s or l ones. Sorry, Alt L ones. And ethereum is going to need mega ETH, essentially is my hot take.
01:16:25.910 - 01:16:56.670, Speaker A: And if it was so easy, I'm just shocked that there's been billions and billions of dollars invested in l two s. And this is the state of things, like 120 transactions per second on a good day. And what are we doing, guys? You have billions of dollars. That's the best you can do? Maybe if he's going to come in and just kind of, I think blow the water out of a lot of these and have people look kind of silly that that was what they optimized for was like ten x improvements versus 1000 x improvements.
01:16:57.190 - 01:17:38.350, Speaker B: Well, the other thing that I completely agree with you on that, Jim. The other side of that spectrum though is I think people are going to start to question again what is minimum viable sort of functionality look like for the L one, right? For so long the design principle of ETH has been to push complexity aside. And actually I was just looking for the tweet, I couldn't find it, but maybe we can get it in time to put on the video for later. Vitalik actually a couple of months ago posted like I used to be very much in favor of just pushing complexity up to the roll up layer, but now I'm rethinking some of that. And actually Ethereum has to have more functionality. Like Miles, you and I have talked about this forever, but this whole ethereum is settlement layer. If all Ethereum does is settlement, I'm sorry, that's bearish.
01:17:38.350 - 01:18:15.850, Speaker B: That is bearish. And I think you're starting to see folks understand this. That's why there's this huge push right, from some folks, for ETH to be da and ETH to be a sequencer. It's like hey guys, the L one is still this really important coordination layer and has to do more than just be this really slow settlement layer. And I agree with you, Miles, about that point. Frankly, I'm sort of interested in the idea of base roll ups on Salana because yeah, you don't have twelve second block times, you have 400 millisecond block times. They want to move it to 200 millisecond block times and then suddenly a lot of the 90% of the pain of base sequencing goes away in that world.
01:18:15.850 - 01:18:48.470, Speaker B: So I think we're going to start to re examine what the ideal role of the L one is, assuming that every l one is going to have l two s and what functionality should be part of the L one and what should be part of the layer two s. And there are other chains out there that are building. Frankly, I want to give like avalanche. The way that they've handled interop across their subnets is great. And I think people don't talk at all about the role that the L one should play in interoperability between its chains.
01:18:52.010 - 01:19:14.286, Speaker A: To design a roadmap that is roll up centric and not think about interoperability and how all of these things are going to interact with one another. Feels like a miss an own goal. Right? We should have been thinking a little bit more about what does that look like and how does that function operationally in a good and seamless way.
01:19:14.388 - 01:19:30.770, Speaker B: And we're armchair quarterbacking and there's so many priorities. Right. I want to give credit where credit is due. We just got the merge, we got dang Kuhn. This is building the plane in midair. So I'm not saying we could do better here. It's just other chains learn.
01:19:30.920 - 01:19:34.500, Speaker A: I definitely cannot do better. I definitely cannot do better. No.
01:19:35.610 - 01:20:17.826, Speaker C: But I would hope that projects in general, infra projects, whether it's Eigen layer or Ethereum core development, is kind of listening to the market, seeing what users are actually doing, and then being a little bit more opinionated. Not necessarily. And saying things like, you have to do this. But here's a standard, right? We're going to enforce a few canonical standards that are just going to make everybody's lives a lot easier. You're not going to have to choose between the Conex wormhole layer zero, like all these interop standards or something like that. You have to be very careful which you pick and choose. Right.
01:20:17.826 - 01:20:39.414, Speaker C: Because if you're overly opinionated about the wrong thing, then you're going to lose your user base. But yeah, that's what I'd like to see a little bit more of. Just in general, I know it's all about credible neutrality, and that's extremely important, but there is kind of a needle to thread, I think. Not that I could have done any.
01:20:39.452 - 01:20:49.338, Speaker B: Better either, but we're just humble. Middle of the bell crippers, guys. Unfortunately, we got to wrap it here, but this is a lot of fun. Jim, we got to have you back on the show again.
01:20:49.424 - 01:20:53.942, Speaker A: Please do enjoyed myself. Thanks for having me, guys. Have a safe flight home, Mike.
01:20:54.006 - 01:20:54.950, Speaker B: All right, appreciate it.
01:20:54.960 - 01:20:55.390, Speaker C: See you guys.
01:20:55.460 - 01:21:17.190, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we are incredibly excited to have teamed up with the wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve NFTs, which you can get and mint for free.
01:21:17.190 - 01:21:20.050, Speaker B: Click the link at the bottom of this episode. Take you get your free NFT.
