00:00:00.330 - 00:00:08.794, Speaker A: Before we jump into this episode, quick reminder that everything said on Bell Curve is a meme and nothing said on Bell Curve is financial advice.
00:00:08.922 - 00:00:10.080, Speaker B: Enjoy the EP.
00:00:13.010 - 00:00:31.720, Speaker A: All right, partner. This one's going to be a fun one here today. We're going to be this is the last interview episode of this season of Bell Curve. We're going to be talking about Bitcoin coming to Cosmos, the collab that we didn't know that we needed, but now that we know it's a possibility we're all super excited about. Do you want to talk a little bit about who we've got on the show?
00:00:32.250 - 00:01:18.766, Speaker C: Absolutely. So, you know, today we'll be speaking to developers of Rollkit and the Babylon team and an application developer and Aidan From. So, you know, I think we have a wide range of perspectives on how Bitcoin plays into this app chain conversation. Then we also have the perspective of a builder who is thinking about these different stacks and thinking about how to make the best possible version of their product by leveraging different parts of the stack and security models. So I think, yeah, I'm really excited for this one, and I think it'll be a great way to kind of tie together a lot of these themes that we've been talking about through the whole season.
00:01:18.958 - 00:01:19.694, Speaker D: Same partner.
00:01:19.742 - 00:02:07.234, Speaker A: And just to give listeners a guide, because in the beginning, this is a little bit of a technical episode. So the first probably half or so of the episode, we're really digging into what does it mean to this kind of alliance between budding alliance or potential alliance between Cosmos and Bitcoin. So we talk about what does it mean for a chain to inherit the security of another chain, what are some of the different approaches right, both in Babylon and kind of the nascent roll kit that just sort of got rolled out and what are kind of some of the tradeoffs in between those solutions. And then we sort of end with Aidan kind of talking about things from the perspective of an appchain developer in the Cosmos ecosystem. So I think we covered a lot of really interesting ground, and I think that's about all the audience needs to hear from us. So without any further ado, let's just dive right in to it.
00:02:07.272 - 00:02:08.198, Speaker C: Sounds great.
00:02:08.364 - 00:02:09.174, Speaker E: Cool.
00:02:09.372 - 00:02:25.340, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. This is the final interview of this, so super, super excited to do this. Miles and I today are joined by Javid, David, and Aiden. We're going to be getting into backgrounds there in a second, but welcome, fellas. Thanks for joining us.
00:02:26.190 - 00:02:28.122, Speaker B: Thanks for having for having us here.
00:02:28.176 - 00:02:29.610, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks for having me on.
00:02:29.760 - 00:03:03.720, Speaker A: Awesome. Today we're going to be kind of broadly exploring this idea of know. In the last episode, Miles and I were kind of exploring this idea of the Cosmos appchain thesis playing out on ethereum. And more recently, we've kind of seen signs that there might be an intersection, a very interesting intersection to explore between Bitcoin and Cosmos and kind of the app chain thesis as well. But before we start to dig into that, I think it might be helpful just to do a super quick round of intros for those on the call. So maybe, Aidan, can I kind of pick on you to go first, and then I want to just do 30 seconds on who you are and the project that you're working on.
00:03:04.410 - 00:03:30.234, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. So I'm Aidan. I am working on Stride. Stride is an app chain that provides liquid staking for Cosmos. So what that means is today we support St Atom, st Osmo, Sefmos, St Luna, SC, Juno and St Stars. But we're going to be adding about 20 more LSTs this year. So the way that Stride works is we provide LSTs or liquid Staking tokens trustlessly through IBC.
00:03:30.234 - 00:03:34.190, Speaker D: So it's a cross chain liquid staking protocol in Cosmos.
00:03:37.740 - 00:03:41.240, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Aidan. Javit or David?
00:03:45.260 - 00:03:46.920, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead, Darwin.
00:03:49.060 - 00:04:23.624, Speaker E: Hey, everyone, I'm Javit. I was working at Optimism earlier on their Bedrock release. Before that, I was part of a lot of blockchain projects like Handshake and Dtreg. I also published this paper along with my colleague at Perz called Inventory Dos. Like in Dros, we found a lot of Dos vectors in a lot of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, multiple versions of Bitcoin, in fact. And now I'm working at the Execution Environments Team here at Celestia. Building out.
00:04:23.624 - 00:04:36.060, Speaker E: Rolltit. And recently I made it possible for Rollkit to use Bitcoin as a DLA, which we'll be getting into today. So that's me. Go ahead, David.
00:04:36.560 - 00:05:02.896, Speaker B: Okay, great. Good morning, everybody. So, I'm David. So I started this project, Babylon, about a year ago. Our goal is to bring Bitcoin security to the appchain world. So our focus so far has been on Cosmos, which is very natural, being one of the predominant app chain world. And right now we have built a testnet.
00:05:02.896 - 00:05:31.680, Speaker B: We launched it a few weeks ago. In fact, we just had a shared security summit. We organized one with Eigen Layer last week. So right now, there are eight cospos chains on our testnet integrated with Babylon, bringing Bitcoin security, including Osmosis, Juno, Secret and other chains. I'm also a professor at Stanford and this research for Babylon comes out from our research lab at Stanford.
00:05:32.900 - 00:06:03.770, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, thank you very much, David. Stanford is definitely one of the good ones that many folks here will have heard of. I actually think that the mission of Babylon is probably a really good sort of jumping off point, and maybe before we get into the weeds, maybe we could just do kind of like a high level sort of definition of terms. So I think it might be very good to kind of just define when we talk about appchains being able to borrow or leverage the security of Bitcoin, can you just get a little bit more granular about defining what does security mean? What are the properties of security?
00:06:05.520 - 00:06:08.408, Speaker B: Yeah. So you want me to start, right, Michael?
00:06:08.584 - 00:06:09.116, Speaker C: Sure.
00:06:09.218 - 00:06:38.228, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah. So security is basically robustness of a blockchain against attacks. So one can think of security as a multi dimension object. So for example, one can think that there are maybe roughly four types of attacks that one can attack a blockchain. One is double spin attack, short range double spin attack. Number two is a long range double spend attack.
00:06:38.228 - 00:07:16.370, Speaker B: This is happening when unbonding has happened. The third attack is an invalid execution attack where you create money from nothing by having an invalid state transition. And the fourth is a liveness attack. And liveness attack can further be broken down into censorship, resistance or just the whole chain got stalled because some validators did not update the software properly. So those are the four attack vectors that I can think of at a high level. Maybe Aidan and Javad can add if they think that I'm missing something.
00:07:18.740 - 00:08:25.028, Speaker E: Yeah, maybe there's another attack vector where because of an invalid state transition, the network partitions. And that is the most I think the attack there is. Like when you have a network partition, it's very hard to bring consensus back. And we saw this happen with, for example, when we disclosed in Dos, which was like a Dos vector. This falls into the category of liveness attack that David just mentioned because of the disclosure process, which takes a long time because we did a responsible disclosure. So we disclosed to the Bitcoin developers first. And the risk of not doing this properly was that in case you have a role or release passed out for fixing this bug, and it's not evenly patched on the network all at once, you would have a network partition because some nodes would upgrade and some wouldn't.
00:08:25.028 - 00:09:24.760, Speaker E: And for example, because of some malicious actor, if this bug was exploited, then you would have a part of the network going down and a part of network keeping going on a different path. And because of this, it would cause a network partition. This was a worry for most of the developers that are working on distributed systems because in contrast to traditional infosec practices, the chances of patching a bug going horribly wrong are much higher because there's just so much more complicated than centralized entity like Apple, for example, patching a bug. So there are definitely a lot of complexities involved in fixing bugs and generally approaching security when it comes to distributed systems, especially like Bitcoin.
00:09:26.880 - 00:10:13.160, Speaker C: That's great, that's really helpful. And I think we'd love to get into a little bit later how Babylon is helping proof of stake chains inherit some of these properties from Bitcoin versus how sovereign bitcoin roll up would. But yeah, I think that's probably a good time to transition over. So, Javid, you released a post this week that describes what a Bitcoin sovereign roll up would look like using Roll Kit. So maybe just take a step back. Could you give a high level overview of what Roll Kit is? How is roll kit different or similar aligned with Celestia? And then exactly what are you describing here when you say a bitcoin sovereign roll?
00:10:13.500 - 00:10:14.280, Speaker B: Okay, sure.
00:10:14.350 - 00:10:59.320, Speaker E: Yeah, those are great questions. Let's dive into those. So, first of all, Roll Kit is a modular framework for building roll ups. What do you mean by modular? You can have all the components of a roll up, which are typically the execution environment. So this is like, for example, get like EVM or for example, quantum bottom or maybe like Fuel and all these. So these are the execution environments. These are like one layer of the stack and the other pieces of the components of the stack are like, for example, data availability.
00:10:59.320 - 00:11:51.960, Speaker E: Like, how would you do sequencing the sequencer? How would you submit, like, intermediate state routes? So Rollkit includes all of these modules. Just as Cosmos SDK allows developers to create new blockchains using the whole Cosmos tab, rollkit allows developers to create new rollups and with the same level of modularity, because each component is its own package and nicely, it has abstractions defined so that they can be switched independent of each other. So our goal with showing bitcoin as a data availability layer was to highlight that Rolekit is easy to integrate.
00:11:53.740 - 00:11:54.260, Speaker B: With.
00:11:54.350 - 00:12:40.456, Speaker E: Any data availability layer. And this is what we did in the last week. Coming to your second question, how is Rolekit related to Celestia? Well, Rolekit is a neutral project. It is not related to any single entity. But you can use having you can use Celestia as data availability layer for using Rolekit. So it is possible because Rollkit is modular, but we wanted to highlight that it's easy to switch away to Bitcoin and you can have just as easily any other data availability layer implemented. So this is what we did.
00:12:40.638 - 00:13:40.380, Speaker C: It's great. So basically it's a demonstration that this framework is so modular and flexible that you could use really any L one for data availability, whether it's Bitcoin, whether it's Celestia or Ethereum. And in the case of the Bitcoin sovereign roll up, it is basically completely relying on Bitcoin for data availability and consensus. Whereas I think maybe with Babylon and we can kind of transition over to David, I think with Babylon you're really supplementing, I think, security with Bitcoin Chuck pointing. So I would love to just kind of David, if you wouldn't mind giving an overview of what Babylon is working on. And specifically, maybe I saw the Osmosis Babylon proposal was approved on Jane recently and would love to give viewers an overview of what that proposal is describing.
00:13:41.360 - 00:14:17.572, Speaker B: Yeah, great. So, yeah, maybe in a high level. Let me explain a little bit about the overall goal of the project Babylon. So if you look at the world of shared security, there are basically two sources of security, main source of security in the blockchain world, there is bitcoin on the one side, ethereum on the other side. So if you think about the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, it starts with Ethereum, the chain. And then there's a fundamental problem which scalability doesn't scale. So Roups is what appears as the scaling solution.
00:14:17.572 - 00:14:52.720, Speaker B: Scaling solution right now. So row ups get scalability, and by using technologies like ZK and fraud proofs, it shares as much as the security of Ethereum as possible. Now, what we see, the next step is that now if you have many row ops, then there's a problem of interoperability. How do these row ops talk to each other? And that's what we see. The recent, I guess you had a previous episode on superchain. So you can see the direction here from security to scalability to interoperability. Interoperability is still very much a work in progress.
00:14:52.720 - 00:15:29.476, Speaker B: Now, if you look, however, outside Ethereum, then in fact we already have an ecosystem which is very strong in interoperability, which is Cosmos. So Cosmos already have sovereign chains which have interoperability. And because they're app chain, it implicitly have scalability, because all these app chains are running in parallel. What is missing, though, is security. So sometimes you think about it, we're now working backwards, right? We're starting from cosmos. An architecture ecosystem already have interoperability scalability, but now we want to bring back security. So this is the opposite direction.
00:15:29.476 - 00:16:16.152, Speaker B: But now there's a very natural source of security for that, which is so that's sort of what we are. The goal of the project is to take the Cosmos ecosystem or any other ecosystems which will have interoperability. For example, IBC is now going beyond Cosmos. How to add the bitcoin security to that, to make it secure. So that's the goal of the project. Now going into a little bit detail as to what kind of security, whether it's a supplement, one can think of it in two ways. So basically, the core technology is to offer a timestamp, a bitcoin timestamp stamp on every single block of every app chain.
00:16:16.152 - 00:16:50.804, Speaker B: So that's the goal. Every app chain, every block has a BTC timestamp. And Babylon is the technology that enables us to do that. So this is a very scalable technology and it allows many, many chains to simultaneously get the bitcoin timestamp. Now, once you get the timestamp, there are two types of defense that Babylon can provide true bitcoin security. One, as I mentioned, is long range attack. So long range attack is when you have unbonding and then the attacker creates an alternative fork.
00:16:50.804 - 00:17:45.690, Speaker B: It's a special type of double spare attack, but it's very serious because you cannot protect it through slashing. So right now, the solutions ad hoc in the app chain world is like a 21 day or 28 day unbonding. Basically, using bitcoin, you can first make it safe, provably safe, and also reduce the bond time to less than one day. So essentially, however long time you think that the block is secure on the bitcoin chain, one day is like 100 block deep, so it's very secure and Born is very important. So we make it super secure. So that's 1 second is that you can think of bitcoin security as also an additional layer of security beyond the economic security of the app chain. So the app chain has their own validators, like a Cosmos SDK chain, like Stride for example, will have their own validator set.
00:17:45.690 - 00:17:54.760, Speaker B: They will be responsible for confirming transactions block by block. So very fast confirmation. This is POS facility.
00:17:54.920 - 00:17:55.630, Speaker C: Okay?
00:17:56.000 - 00:18:31.160, Speaker B: Now however, in some applications which we talked to different app chains, there may be some important high value transactions that you want an extra level of security, extra layer of security that you can achieve by waiting for the bitcoin timestamp of the block to become, say, two block deep in the bitcoin chain. Two block deep basically means it's coinbase can confirm a bitcoin transaction. So that's coinbase level of security. So let's call it bitcoin security. So that's the second type of use case of the timestamp through Babylon.
00:18:32.460 - 00:18:44.248, Speaker C: It's essentially trying to combine the best of both worlds, right, with the mass finality of proof of stake, but with basically the long range attack security of bitcoin.
00:18:44.424 - 00:18:55.760, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically short range by proof of stake, long range by bitcoin and medium range also for bitcoin for important transactions. So that's one way to think about it.
00:18:55.910 - 00:19:25.290, Speaker C: No, it's really interesting and I mean, I think it's leveraging the same properties that make bitcoin a great collateral asset and finding a second basically problem to solve. It's a much more crypto native problem in terms of supplementing the security of proof of stake chains. From a practical standpoint, it's fair to say this will eventually mean the unbonding periods compress to a matter of hours instead of 21 days.
00:19:26.320 - 00:20:07.050, Speaker B: Yeah. So just one point going a little bit into the technology and the contrast with say, the row up that Javad talked about, just to provide some contrast here, is that actually our design goal was to minimize the footprint onto the bitcoin chain. So basically we put each timestamp on the bitcoin chain is 150 bytes. So two so called op return transactions, so it's a very small footprint. So that was our design goal is to use as little footprint in bitcoin as possible, but yet still extract quite a lot of security.
00:20:07.980 - 00:20:37.680, Speaker C: No, and it makes sense and I think is it fair to say, Javit, that with the sovereign roll up, that is a challenge, right? In terms of the amount of data that you would need needing to post to bitcoin is it fair to say that it's hard to see practical use cases for it right now, but potentially in the future you could see something interesting come out of it? Or is it at the very least a demonstration of the modular stack?
00:20:38.020 - 00:21:43.664, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, absolutely. The integration of Roll Kit with bitcoin was absolutely meant like a research project to understand the viability of to check the feasibility of doing it. Actually, I think if a lot of data was being posted to bitcoin, it would bloat up the chain a lot. And definitely that is not like the ideal way to do roll ups. Generally, you want your data availability layer to be able to handle a lot of data without adding a lot of overhead. So this is where the flexibility of using a modular framework like Rolekit comes in because you as an application developer can choose which data availability layer you want. So, for example, if you're using Rolekit to write data to Ethereum, for example, and Ethereum is getting too congested, you might want to switch over to a different data availability layer.
00:21:43.664 - 00:22:36.436, Speaker E: And that might not be easily possible if you're using a very tightly coupled code base, or like for example, a code base which is very dependent on Ethereum. Like maybe it's parsing Ethereum transactions to read the data and you want to replace that with bitcoin. And typically these transaction formats and almost everything about them is different. So you would spend a lot of time rewriting your code base to switch over from one database to different one. And this is where Roll Kit really shines because it has a modular framework, so all the components are independently abstracted away. The component which handles, for example, this is something I appreciated when I was implementing this was when I had to implement bitcoin data availability layer. All I had to write was like two functions.
00:22:36.436 - 00:23:04.380, Speaker E: One function is to submit data to bitcoin, like it's literally called submit block and another called retrieve blocks. So it was really simple to implement because of the abstractions that Roll Kit provides. And this is where application developers can make use of the modularity to innovate and find whatever suits their needs best and implement that using the modular framework.
00:23:04.720 - 00:23:05.048, Speaker A: It's.
00:23:05.064 - 00:23:08.060, Speaker C: Really? Go ahead, Mike.
00:23:08.220 - 00:24:05.140, Speaker A: I've just got a question for the two of you. Both David and Java, can you comment a little bit, know if both your solutions are implemented, what is the impact on kind of the bitcoin side of things? So David, you mentioned that part of your design philosophy was to sort of minimize the imprint or the footprint on bitcoin block space. We know that ordinals kind of taproot sort of led to this revolution in bitcoin block space. And there's a lot of lively discussion coming from that side of the world in terms of what should bitcoin block space be used for, I'd be very curious to understand because my understanding is that we're not actually exporting physical bitcoins to be used as collateral into these appchain sort of systems. Instead, it's exporting the properties of bitcoin blockspace and the ability to actually read and write onto bitcoin block space. So can you just talk a little bit about kind of the reception from the bitcoin side of things and then what, if any, sort of benefits are there to bitcoin?
00:24:06.600 - 00:25:02.840, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a very interesting question because the timestamps that we put in is very succinct. So it's a very small footprint. And so in terms of transaction fees, it's very small transaction fees for bitcoin. So that's a double edged sword, I guess, right? From a cost point of view, we're minimizing our cost, but from the bitcoin point of view, the benefit they get is rather limited. So I think we have thought about this. So there are several different ways of thinking about this. One is the following question, which is, if you want to use bitcoin as a data availability, like what Jobat mentioned about ROKiT, then you have to put the full data put the full data onto bitcoin.
00:25:02.840 - 00:25:57.628, Speaker B: Our solution is the other extreme, where you put no data on bitcoin except for basically commitments of each block, which is very small. Do you get any benefit in the middle? Is there any intermediate benefit in the middle? I think that's a really interesting question, but at this point it's more a research question because we don't really know. So given sort of the current security framework analysis, we've done an answer of this problem which basically says that, well, it's either one or nothing. Either you put the whole thing there or you don't put anything there. You don't seem to get any benefit in the middle. But however, I think that's a very interesting question, precisely given the recent excitement around ordinary notes. Before ordinary notes, the understanding was that bitcoiners really hate people to put stuff onto the bitcoin chain after ordinary notes.
00:25:57.628 - 00:26:46.250, Speaker B: However, this seems to have changed. So I think this question, this situation revived interest on that problem. So I would say one thing, Q, is in terms of getting more engagement from the bitcoin community, more benefit. So we had a discussion with Sunny Algawa at the Shared Security Summit, and there are some ideas on whether or not one can bring some, say real BTC into the cosmos ecosystem to help with BTC staking as a way of getting another form of security. Another form of security. But this is kind of an early discussion with Sunny. Oh, going back to that question, though, I forget to answer earlier question, since I mentioned Sunny was the integration with Osmosis, so maybe very briefly talk about that.
00:26:46.250 - 00:27:27.600, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have eight chains on a testnet right now, going to ten, actually, and hopefully Stry will join us soon. So we have basically these chains on testnet, but we decide to integrate with Osmosis on the mainnet. So that was the governance proposal on the mainnet. So it's multiple phases. The first phase is basically opening IBC to get the BTC timestamp and the latter phases about fast and bonding. So the fast and bonding requires us to feed the BTC timestamp information back onto the Osmosis chain and control the unsticking module. So that requires some software changes and that will be later phases of the integration.
00:27:27.600 - 00:27:48.330, Speaker B: But right now we have an acceptance of the governance proposal about 99%. Yes. So we're very happy for the support and the general support is for the full integration. But the specifics we're going to pass more governance proposal for the specific software changes.
00:27:49.740 - 00:28:11.760, Speaker C: Just out of curiosity, David, what does the cost structure of the economics look like there with that relationship? I assume Babylon incurs a cost to post data to bitcoin and then you just add a margin on top of that cost. And is that coming from the community pool or some dow treasury of the app chains?
00:28:15.240 - 00:29:01.028, Speaker B: That's right. So we pay the transaction fees to bitcoin and we decided to increase find a new use case of increasing amount of data that transaction fees will go up. Now, the chains, the consumer chains like Osmosis using Babylon, consuming bitcoin security will be paying in terms of fees because they have to timestamp. So the technology is that Osmosis and any chains will be timestamping onto Babylon. Babylon will be timestamping onto bitcoin to sort of aggregate all the timestamp together. So the natural place where they can pay is at the timestamp when they commit a timestamp through IBC. So that would be a natural way to pay in terms of exactly how much to pay.
00:29:01.028 - 00:30:15.900, Speaker B: We're still exploring the tokenomics because we try to quantify the value that Babylon through bitcoin security gives to the app chain. So one value is the fast and bonding. So that we're doing some analysis actually with Aden, we're doing some analysis on that impact on liquid sticking protocols. Another one is you can ask the question, well, now that you have bitcoin security as sort of a backup or a slow for high value transaction, how much does that reduce the cost of the native staking? Because everyone knows, every founder knows that to maintain a POS app chain, you have to spend a lot of tokens in basically enticing people to stake on your chain. By having bitcoin security, that cost should be reduced because now that you have bitcoin security, how much is it reduced? Because the reduction is quite important, because then you can use the tokens to actually focus on the applications they try to build to provide incentives for people who build the application. So that is a very important question and that we are discussing with multiple projects, including like Akash, who's very interested in this question, and to quantify.
00:30:17.920 - 00:30:54.970, Speaker C: Really, really interesting and there's powerful implications there, I think. And maybe just to kick it over to Aidan, you tweeted the other day that you saw it was basically like bitcoin plus Cosmos ethereum and roll ups. This makes sense. And I'd love to just start unpacking this idea from the perspective of the builder. Why do you see Cosmos as potentially aligned with bitcoin ethereum and roll ups on the other side of the equation. Makes a lot of sense. I think we're starting to hear a little bit about it, but curious just to unpack this idea a little bit.
00:30:55.740 - 00:31:23.410, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. Maybe I'll start with a comment that David just made about how fast and bonding actually can improve the health of the ecosystem. And then I'll jump over to this. So, if you think about liquid staking protocols, there's sort of a few layers of the stack. At the bottom layer, you have the liquid staking protocol itself. So, for example, in Cosmos, this is Stride. We provide liquid staking tokens for all of these different L ones.
00:31:23.410 - 00:31:53.240, Speaker D: On top of that, you have the pools. So these are the LP pools that have, for example, SC Atom, atom, SC, Osmo, osmo. So they pair the liquid staking token with the native token. And on top of that, you have integrations, such as lending markets. You could buy NFTs with, for example, SC stars. This is something that's not out yet, but it could come out. So there's all kinds of applications, and they all kind of rely on the health of these pools.
00:31:53.240 - 00:32:57.000, Speaker D: Now, if you think about how to measure the health of these pools, one metric is how healthy is the Peg? So, for example, if you want to sell an st atom for atom, how much atom do you get in return? Do you actually get the same amount of atom that you should, or is it dpegged? And do you get less than you could redeem with Stride? And the way that fast unbonding actually increases the health of the Peg is the health of the Peg is a function of how easy it is to run the ARB between, for example, st atom and atom. So if st atom is cheap, one way that you could run the ARB is you buy the cheap st atom, you go back to Stride and you redeem it for atom. And in this way, you actually get the full amount of atom redeemable for st atom. So, for example, if st atom is trading at $0.95 in the pool, you could go back to stride and redeem it for a dollar. The problem is you have to wait for three weeks. Or maybe not the problem, but this is the reason why liquid staking tokens can deg.
00:32:57.000 - 00:33:30.970, Speaker D: I mean, we saw this on ethereum where Steeth had an infinite unbonding period, and therefore there were these massive defects because no one actually knew whether they could or when they could redeem se for underlying ETH. So by reducing the unbonding period, you make it much easier to run this ARB. So the way that it works is if SC Atom is trading at $0.95, someone can go in and they can buy that SC atom for $0.95, they can redeem it with stride. And if the unbonding period is only three days, that's. Actually a less expensive ARB to run than if the unbonding period is three weeks.
00:33:30.970 - 00:33:56.144, Speaker D: So by decreasing the unbonding period, you increase the health of all of these pools. And if you go one layer up the stack, you increase the health of all the integrations that rely on these pools. So I guess to summarize that point, if you sort of believe in a future where liquid staking tokens are widespread, reducing the unbonding period is actually very desirable and it can increase the health.
00:33:56.182 - 00:35:03.632, Speaker C: Of the entire ecosystem, it makes total sense. It basically reduces the liquidity premium from the perspective of the native staking tokens, which should drive down inflation rates to a more reasonable level in the long term. But also, as you mentioned, makes kind of the usage of the liquid staking tokens even more safe, which I think is great. So I can see now why starting to make sense a little bit more your Tweet, because it also improves the stride product a little bit more. But is it fair to say that basically bitcoin, the Cosmo stack, allows you to make incredible applications and bitcoin as basically the opposite set of properties. And so by combining them, you can get something that is as close to, I guess, what's replicated on the ethereum side as possible. Is that kind of the general idea with your Tweet?
00:35:03.776 - 00:35:47.008, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's fair. And to kind of unpack the Tweet. I don't have it in front of me, but it was something along the lines of, like, cosmos and bitcoin is a match made in heaven. And you have ethereum and roll ups on the other side, and you kind of have this strategy where you have a base layer that's very secure and you push the flexibility to the edges of the system. So maybe I'll talk about that for a moment. I think you sort of need to start with why shared security? So David touched on this a little bit earlier, but I think upstream of shared security, you actually have scalability. So when I think of blockchains, I sort of think of them as trust markets.
00:35:47.008 - 00:36:27.650, Speaker D: So you want to maximize trust. And the problem today is that there's way too much demand for block space than there is block space available or highly trusted block space. And this kind of leads to things like the Alt L one season in 2021 where you have all of these different Alt L ones springing up and people kind of go to new blockchains. They don't really know what the trust properties of those are. And some of them actually have quite bad trust properties. And I guess there's sort of two ways to think about scaling blockchain. So one way is vertical scaling, and this is just making your chain faster, increasing the block size, things like that.
00:36:27.650 - 00:37:01.592, Speaker D: And the other way to think about scaling is horizontal scaling. So this is where you get into ideas like the interchain and cosmos, where you have lots of blockchains running in parallel that can communicate on optimism. It's called the superchain, I believe. I just started reading about this the other day. Very interesting. And then I guess you have the more general version of this, which is just the multi chain, and that's where you sort of have all of these different chains and they're connected with various bridging standards. And I think for the most part, I mean, it's sort of the thesis of this entire podcast.
00:37:01.592 - 00:37:49.150, Speaker D: Most blockchains have come around to the horizontal scaling vision. I would say solana is like the one notable exception or holdout, where they're still trying to scale things vertically and just get bigger blocks and faster block times. But most ecosystems, I think, have come around to this horizontal scaling vision. And I would frame the problem here as new chains, when you scale horizontally, have low economic security. So if you think about the cost of goods securing chains for a POW chain, it's like the hash power. For a POS chain, it's the cost to buy a two third stake, or one third if it's a liveness attack. And for many new chains, the market cap of the staking token is actually quite low.
00:37:49.150 - 00:38:27.560, Speaker D: And this can actually lead to very bad outcomes if you have thousands of chains. So right now, there aren't very many chains, even in cosmos. Cosmos has like 50. But if you imagine a future where there are literally thousands of chains, you have strong interdependence between all of those chains. So, for example, if you bridge a token through ten different chains, you actually care about what the weakest link in that path is. And if you have thousands of chains, it's very plausible that you're like bridging between tens or hundreds of chains. Even so, if one chain along that path fails, it can lead to very bad outcomes.
00:38:27.560 - 00:39:01.110, Speaker D: So I think that's sort of the scalability side of things. And the solution that's been introduced is the idea that these high security chains such as bitcoin and ethereum should scale their trust to lower security chains. And there are tons of implementations of this, but I think they all reduce to the same thing, which is how to scale trusts. Maybe I can talk briefly about the shared security landscape and what some of those solutions look like. And then I guess why I think bitcoin and cosmos are ideologically aligned. But I'll pause there for a moment.
00:39:03.240 - 00:39:06.630, Speaker C: That would be great unless somebody else wants to jump in.
00:39:08.360 - 00:39:42.464, Speaker D: Cool. So looking at the shared security landscape today, the ecosystems that I'm most interested in personally are ethereum, cosmos, and bitcoin. If you look at ethereum, there are sort of two solutions that I'm aware of. So there's this roll up centric roadmap, the idea that you can scale ethereum through optimism and arbitram. So optimistic rollups or ZK rollups. And then you also have eigen layer, which, as David mentioned, just at a big conference. It's very exciting to learn more about them.
00:39:42.464 - 00:40:24.190, Speaker D: And the idea here is that you can re hypothecate stake, so you can take your either ethereum LST, or you can even run a node yourself. And on top of that, you can run another node and introduce new slashing conditions. So it's a little bit different than the roll up centric roadmap, but another way to scale Ethereum. On Cosmos, there are at least four shared security solutions that I'm aware of. So there's interchange security, there's opt in security, there is alliance from the terra ecosystem, and then there's mesh from osmosis. They all have some similarities and differences. Happy to talk about these, but I think the high level is in cosmos, people are sort of just starting to experiment with this idea of shared security.
00:40:24.190 - 00:40:57.704, Speaker D: And on the interoperability side, cosmos is way ahead. But on the shared security side, I think cosmos is sort of catching up to ethereum. And then on bitcoin, of course, you have Babylon and rollkit. And I think bitcoin sort of has a lot going for it. It's extremely decentralized. It's probably the most decentralized chain, and it's the least volatile crypto asset. And if you're thinking about as a chain, like looking for shared security, what you actually want, that's basically it.
00:40:57.704 - 00:41:11.964, Speaker D: You want a chain that's extremely decentralized, and you want a chain that has a low volatility crypto asset with a very high market cap so that it's very hard to sorry.
00:41:12.162 - 00:41:13.310, Speaker C: No, go ahead.
00:41:14.480 - 00:41:14.796, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:14.818 - 00:41:56.280, Speaker D: And I would actually make a claim that there is alignment between bitcoiners and Cosmos and they just don't know it yet. Actually, some people do know it. Such know david and I think Sonny has also tweeted about this. And javid, of course, you're building Cosmos roll ups on bitcoin. So some people definitely do know this, but I think it's underappreciated. So maybe I'll talk about what bitcoiners want and then what cosmos builders want and how I sort of see these lining up. So I tweeted out a while ago, and I don't think I was the first to tweet this, that bitcoin is an app chain where the application is digital gold.
00:41:56.280 - 00:42:24.020, Speaker D: So there's already sort of an ideological alignment between bitcoin and cosmos. Cosmos. I think the heart of Cosmos is app chains and IBC. And bitcoin is an app chain. It doesn't have IBC, but it has sort of half of the cosmos ideology. It's already a provider of trust. Bitcoiners talk about immutable money, and I think that relies on strong trust assumptions.
00:42:24.020 - 00:43:14.784, Speaker D: And bitcoiners really don't want anyone to mess with that. So the chain should just be minimal and secure, I guess is what bitcoiners say, and it provides sort of digital gold. Or maybe you would generalize it a little bit and just say trust. I think the problem that bitcoin has is how do you generate demand for bitcoin block space and generate transaction fees? So this is sort of the open question. Now, on the Cosmos side, what do Cosmos builders want? Speaking from my perspective and building stride, I think most app chains want sovereignty, interoperability and security. Now, the first two, sovereignty and interoperability, cosmos has this you can build your own app chain, you can customize the execution environment. Chains or protocols can even extract mev.
00:43:14.784 - 00:43:41.528, Speaker D: And IBC is sort of the cornerstone of Cosmos. And in my opinion, it's the best interoperability standard. So Cosmos has interoperability and security. Sorry, sovereignty and interoperability. It does not have security. You have all of these Cosmos chains and some of them have very low market caps. And it's sort of obvious, like, why you'd want a higher market cap on your chain.
00:43:41.528 - 00:44:33.672, Speaker D: If, say, a massive validator or someone with a lot of money came in, they could buy up one third of your tokens and stop your chain, or two thirds of your tokens and actually change the logic and steal the money. So it's not good that Cosmos chains are not secure, but there's a lot of interest around Cosmos chains, so there's lots of users and lots of economic activity. So on the one hand, you have Bitcoin, which provides trust, and it needs more demand for Bitcoin block space and transaction fees. And on the other hand, you have Cosmos chains, which have lots of activity, great sovereignty, great interoperability, but less security. So this is sort of like the opportunity that I see. And with Ethereum, this already sort of exists. Ethereum has come around to this vision and they're just going to use roll ups.
00:44:33.672 - 00:44:51.632, Speaker D: So there's already a match. So I think it's going to be pretty hard for Cosmos to insert themselves into that vision. Definitely possible. And there's people working on, for example, connecting IBC to Ethereum, like the polymer chain, but I think it's going to be harder. So this is sort of the opportunity that I see for Cosmos and Bitcoin to align.
00:44:51.776 - 00:45:38.210, Speaker C: I think that framing of sovereignty, interoperability and security is great, and I think it goes to something what David was saying earlier in that Cosmos is now working backwards to solve the security piece. Whereas I think applications on Ethereum are now coming around to this idea of sovereignty and wanting their own application specific environments. And also from maybe a less of an application perspective, but more of an infrastructure perspective, thinking about interoperability and how to recreate the benefits of IBC or port over IBC itself. So, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And let David or Java, does anything you'd want to react to there?
00:45:40.200 - 00:46:52.330, Speaker E: Yeah, I think I would just say that with Role kit, you are able to choose the best of the you can have best of all the worlds. So along all these access, like sovereignty, interoperability, security, you choose as an application developer what level of each of these you want, like, what suits your needs best and you can plug this in for your specific app because not all apps might need to have sovereignty. Like they might choose to be settled on some chain. And this is on the roadmap. So even though we have sovereign roll ups already working on roll kit, in the future, we're going to have the ability to have settled roll ups. And then on the roadmap, we also have shade sequences, decentralized sequencers. So we are going to provide the maximum flexibility for app developers to choose what their requirements are and they choose what suits their requirements best.
00:46:52.330 - 00:47:11.176, Speaker E: So, yeah, I would just say that I think modularity allows the most flexibility for the developers to choose. And we are just providing this framework for developers to innovate around and have best of all the worlds.
00:47:11.368 - 00:48:43.820, Speaker A: Okay, so I think one of the big differences that I'd like to kind of tease apart here is when I kind of think about one of the advantages of the way ethereum has sort of constructed their roadmap is it's very easy to sort of export ethereum outside of the natural ecosystem, right? There's kind of a trusted solution there to get ethereum onto, let's say, optimism. And even I think it's pretty notable that base is in lieu of a token, they're going to be using Ethereum as kind of their gas in their currency. And one of the just to get your perspective here from the bitcoin side of things, and that one of the challenges that I see here, is there's a little bit of I think there's a lot of alignment in between the sort of communities and ethos and philosophies. But I think one of the challenges is going to be there's already a lot of internal debate within bitcoin about, hey, what should we really be using our block space for? And certainly some of the kind of OGS on the bitcoin side of things are extremely protective of bitcoin block space. And without that ability to export bitcoin and create a little bit more buying pressure for bitcoin, the asset, I think you're kind of losing a big quiver right in your arsenal for what makes this appealing from the bitcoin side of things. So maybe just any commentary there about some of the challenges or frictions that you either see from the lack of ability to actually take bitcoin out of the bitcoin ecosystem or any sort of communal bump ups in between Cosmos and bitcoin, or maybe there's not. And you think it's going to be very smooth.
00:48:44.320 - 00:49:50.230, Speaker D: Yeah, I can maybe jump in with two protocols I'm aware of that might help smooth this. I'm less sure about the ideological challenges, but I sort of agree. I think if bitcoin were exported and maybe Cosmos platforms or DeFi protocols start importing bitcoin, I do think there might be a little bit more alignment behind that because there's demand for bitcoin that is happening off of the bitcoin chain. So the two protocols that I would mention are I think there is actually a trustless bitcoin bridge in Cosmos called nomic, I haven't used it personally, but I believe it's fully trustless and you can actually already export bitcoin into Cosmos. The other protocol that might drive demand for bitcoin is actually Terra's Alliance module. So I'll give a quick overview of what this does. I know there's different connotations with Terra Luna at this point, but I think the alliance module in and of itself is actually pretty interesting.
00:49:50.230 - 00:50:53.620, Speaker D: So the idea behind alliance is you have alliance chains and all it means to be an alliance chain is you can stake exogenous assets on an alliance chain. So this is actually built for staking derivatives, but technically it could be any asset. And the way that it works on Luna is you have the Luna blockchain and you have alliance chains around them. And to drive economic activity for the alliance chains in the Luna Alliance, you would take St Luna, so the Staking derivative of Luna and you would stake it on the alliance chain. In return you get staking yield from that new chain. So if there's like, I don't know, maybe Kujiro, which is like some DeFi protocol and it has a very high yield, if you stake Scluna on that chain, you get Kuji rewards and the Kujiro stakers get Scluna. So there's this sort of economic alignment or the futures of these chains become interwoven as the tokens are distributed between both communities.
00:50:53.620 - 00:51:44.148, Speaker D: And I think chains outside of the Terra Luna ecosystem are going to use alliance. It's just one of many Cosmos shared security solutions. But you can imagine a future where if you're a bitcoiner and you want a little bit of exposure, not much, but maybe a little bit of exposure to a new chain, say it's a lending platform, you could actually stake your bitcoin on that chain and receive staking rewards from that chain in return. So maybe you give up a little bit of bitcoin or maybe you don't give up any bitcoin. And the service that you're providing is just the additional security of staking your asset on this chain and in return you get paid a little bit for it. So this is sort of one plausible way that bitcoin could be exported from the bitcoin chain and also used to secure chains in Cosmos. Yeah, I kind of think about it.
00:51:44.154 - 00:52:20.588, Speaker A: As almost like capital efficiency for your bitcoin, especially if we're recording and who knows, we're recording this on March 7 of 23. Maybe in a couple of years this whole Operation choke point will be a not super fond memory, but as like a very real example, let's say if you're applying for a mortgage or something like that. In traditional finance, up until very recently, usually what they do is they'll do a survey of all of your assets. Up until recently, bitcoin was not only or crypto is not only neutral it was actually a negative for you. When you're applying for a mortgage right now, they've basically upgraded it to neutral.
00:52:20.684 - 00:52:21.636, Speaker D: So if you think about it from.
00:52:21.658 - 00:52:51.100, Speaker A: The perspective of a Bitcoiner or someone who owns a lot of Bitcoin, call it exporting, call it additional ways to leverage your sort of assets, you can kind of get it from two different financial systems. One could be traditional finance, which is increasingly hostile to all sources of crypto, Bitcoin included. Or there could be these new, very interesting sort of crypto native avenues. At least that's how I sort of bucket it in my head. Cosmos could be a really interesting avenue to consider.
00:52:51.250 - 00:53:03.020, Speaker B: So I just want to add a thought on that if it's okay. So if you think about Cosmos, right, it's like, compared to Bitcoin, bitcoin is 400 billion. Cosmos is of the order of tens of billions.
00:53:03.100 - 00:53:03.392, Speaker D: Right?
00:53:03.446 - 00:53:23.460, Speaker B: So if you look at, like, 50 Cosmos chains, they are like startups for Bitcoiners. So you can now stick on any of these chains. Just like investing in startup, you can pick and choose the ones you want to help secure. So I think that could be a potential clay. Yeah, that's really interesting.
00:53:23.610 - 00:54:26.360, Speaker C: Love that idea. And I see a lot of parallels there to jog and layers restaking. I can understand why you guys were so aligned there. Yes. Maybe just to wrap up something we've been talking about a lot this season is just the lifecycle of app chains, starting from basically just finding PMF and iterating on product and then determining, okay, how much more scalability do I need or customization do I need? Should I move to my own full stack app chain, or should I move to maybe an app specific roll up? And we're still very early here, so there aren't a lot of ton of examples to point to of builders who have really thought about this strategically. And I think Stride is one of the very few examples that is live and has at least begun this. So, you know, I'd love to just pick your brain, Aiden, on the strategic rationale behind each stage of your roadmap.
00:54:26.440 - 00:54:26.684, Speaker A: Right?
00:54:26.722 - 00:55:09.210, Speaker C: So you started as, and what you are right now is a sovereign, full stack app chain with an independent, validator set. You'll be soon transitioning to a Cosmos hub consumer chain. And then I know you have long term plans around different ways to secure your chain in a way that reflects, I guess, the usage of your product in the Stride liquid Staking tokens. So I'd just love to kind of hear your thoughts on what was the strategic rationale behind launching as a sovereign app chain, what was the rationale behind your transition to ICS and then your plans for the future beyond that?
00:55:10.860 - 00:56:26.764, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think if you look at Cosmos, I think the best manifestation of the Cosmos vision is sovereign app chains and IBC. And I know you guys have already talked a lot about app chains and IBC, so maybe I won't go too much into that. But when we launched Stride as a sovereign app chain, part of our vision is to have Stride be very minimal, very secure, and have a great UX. And I'll just briefly touch on each of these. So I think the app chains that are more minimal, closer to true app chains rather than general L ones, they're going to reap the most rewards of being an app chain, such as extracting mev, such as forkability. So the ability to change the logic if something goes wrong, or if there's a big hack, and then there's additional benefits that you get as well. In terms of security, because we're a liquid staking platform, you can actually look at TVLs across different DeFi protocols.
00:56:26.764 - 00:57:08.696, Speaker D: And liquid staking platforms typically have some of the highest TVLs of all DeFi protocols. And they're also very central to proof of stake ecosystems. They touch staking, which is sort of the heart of proof of stake. So it's very important in our view that liquid staking protocols are highly secure. And on the UX side, I think people talk about the LST wars or something, where there's all of these different liquid staking protocols and they're all battling for market share. I think the real battle is between centralized exchanges and decentralized liquid staking protocols. If you go and buy, say, Atom on Coinbase, you're going to get a little bit of yield.
00:57:08.696 - 00:57:44.916, Speaker D: It's very similar to holding a liquid staking token, but Coinbase takes a bunch of it and it centralizes the network, so this is not great. So that's just a little bit of background on Stride. Now, when we initially launched, we were in competition, we still are with lots of liquid staking protocols, so we wanted to move very fast. We were also building something that was fairly complex. So Stride is really an interchange DeFi protocol. There's logic that executes on Stride. Stride owns accounts which do staking and unstaking on other chains.
00:57:44.916 - 00:58:18.256, Speaker D: And we have to send packets to these other chains to say, hey, stake these tokens, there was a new deposit, or unstake them because someone wants to redeem. And when you introduce this asynchronous logic, the complexity space just kind of balloons. So I think as people start building more interchange DeFi, they're going to realize this. And it's actually very challenging to build interchange DeFi. So we wanted to move fast and be minimally complex. And also we're a startup, so you can think about it. We're like pouring water into a leaky bucket.
00:58:18.256 - 00:59:04.710, Speaker D: We don't have very much time, so we opted to launch with a sovereign validator set. Now, as we've talked about, bootstrapping, high economic security is hard. So our economic security is actually not where we'd like it to be today. But launching with a sovereign validator set allowed us to move very fast. And in my opinion, Bootstrapping, a validator set is actually not hard in Cosmos today, at least when we did our testnet, for example, there were like 1000 validators on our testnet and we only have 100 on main net. So there's really an abundance of very high quality validators distributed throughout the world. So this is sort of like phase one for Stride, which is moving fast and that's why we chose to launch for the Sovereign validator set.
00:59:04.710 - 00:59:53.604, Speaker D: Now, as I mentioned, liquid staking protocols touch something that's close to the heart of proof of stake ecosystems and they can have very high TBL. So you actually want liquid staking protocols to have very high security. And specifically with atom. There are people that are, I think uncomfortable with the idea of Stride holding lots of atom stake because it moves power from atom stakers over to the Stride chain. So if the Stride chain becomes a large staker of atom, for example, it might make some atom stakers uncomfortable. So we started looking into interchange security, which is also known as replicated security. It's one of the many Cosmos forms of shared security that I talked about.
00:59:53.604 - 01:00:31.116, Speaker D: And the way that it works is Stride is going to onboard to interchange security and our validator set will be the Cosmos Hub validator set. So the Cosmos Hub validators will validate blocks for the Stride chain. Now, the governance process will still happen. Through Stride's current validator set they'll transition to something more like we've been calling them GOVERNATORS. So they do votes, but they don't validate blocks. So Stride will inherit the economic security of the Cosmos Hub and it will have the sovereignty of a standard app chain. So it's sort of the best of both worlds.
01:00:31.116 - 01:01:06.212, Speaker D: So we retain sovereignty, we retain interoperability and our net security expenditure might actually go down. So today Stride has something like 10% inflation. It might actually be that we have to pay the Cosmos Hub less than we pay our current validator set to secure the Stride chain. And in return we get much higher economic security. So this is sort of v two. And I know there's like many iterations of interchange security or replicated security. There's versions where only a subset of the entire validator set validates the chain.
01:01:06.212 - 01:02:02.860, Speaker D: There's versions where you have two validator sets. So you have the Stride validator set and the Cosmos Hub validator set and they both have some power, maybe each has 50%. And then there's of course, mesh security, which is also coming. But the fact is, interchange security is the only shared security model that is live or soon to be live in a week in Cosmos today. So at Stride, we're looking to make Stride as secure as possible while retaining sovereignty, full sovereignty and full interoperability and interchange security allows us to do that. Now, Miles, you were touching on sort of a future vision which I think is personally, this is the most interesting to me, which is sort of like what Sunny talks about where you have this NATO alliance of many chains and all of their economic futures are interwoven. And if one validator misbehaves on one chain, they get slashed on another chain.
01:02:02.860 - 01:03:08.210, Speaker D: And this is this idea of mesh security. And the idea with mesh security is as a sovereign app chain, you can inherit different amounts of security from many different chains. And this is actually really useful for Stride because as I mentioned earlier, if Stride is providing a liquid staking token for a chain, that chain is actually moving some of its staking power to a different validator set. So that chain probably wants their validator set represented on Stride. And you can actually do this with mesh security. Sort of an early idea, but what we've been thinking is you can look at the TVL of each token on Stride and consume security proportional to TVL across these different chains. So say if Stride has 50% St atom by TVL, 25% St Osmo, 25% SC Juno, stride would inherit half of its security from the Cosmos Hub, and then one quarter from Osmosis and one quarter from Juno, and it's sort of a more fair way for Stride to secure itself.
01:03:09.060 - 01:03:52.812, Speaker C: No, I love that, and I think what really comes through to me there is that at each stage here you're thinking about, okay, what security model and what infrastructure would make the best possible product, right? At each stage you're really improving the product. And I think that that's kind of a big theme of what we've been trying to get into this season and I can totally see it bringing in mesh at the end to kind of it's almost like you're matching assets with Liabilities in that perspective. So, yeah, I really, really appreciate you giving an overview there and yeah, I'll turn it back over to Mike.
01:03:52.956 - 01:04:40.096, Speaker A: Yeah, I think guys, that's all the time we have, but we really dug into some super interesting concepts today and thank you all so much. I know this is, frankly, like, a very new area, and a lot of the topics that we touch on today are still developing. But really appreciate all of you coming on and sharing your thoughts. And thank you for helping Miles and I bookend what's been a really fun season where I think both of us learned a whole lot. So really appreciate all your time and guys, highly recommend that you go check out everyone's project here. So Aiden, Java, David, thank you so much, really appreciate you, budy. That was a really fun episode, just a great way to bookend the season, what'd you think?
01:04:40.198 - 01:05:00.356, Speaker C: Yeah, couldn't agree more. One of my favorite episodes, I thought we covered a ton of ground and also tied a lot of these themes together really nicely and brought in a new angle that we haven't talked about in bitcoin and how this plays into the appchain thesis. So really enjoyed that.
01:05:00.538 - 01:05:17.100, Speaker A: Yeah, there was a bit of. Sort of poetic symmetry. In know, Aiden pointed this out, but bitcoin is sort of the original app chain and it's very apt on kind of a whole bunch of levels that we ended up this season talking about the original app chain and some novel use cases for that app chain.
01:05:18.720 - 01:06:15.870, Speaker C: And just to dig into that a little bit, bitcoin has been very in the community, has been very, I would say, intentional about being an app chain. This ordinals NFT development is pretty much the first deviation from Bitcoin as an app chain with its product being this digital goal. And I think all the properties that make bitcoin a great collateral asset can be exported, like what we're seeing with Babylon to solve other use cases. So it's not changing any properties of bitcoin itself. Bitcoin can still be an app chain, but it's creating, I guess, more. And so, yeah, I thought it was a really interesting way to kind of bring everything back.
01:06:17.600 - 01:06:54.164, Speaker A: You know what, this made me think of two things. So, one, this made me think of one of the ideas that Sonny brought up in a much earlier episode of the season, which was he was talking about the idea of permissioning. When it comes to app chains, very difficult to if you have a permissionless app chain, there's a natural tension there because you want to be very specific about the design of that app space, your block space, what the uses are. On the other hand, you want it to be open and permissionless. And it's very funny. Like the original location where that played out was in the bitcoin block space. And we're seeing that reignited with we didn't really get into this, but all of this was made possible by Taproot.
01:06:54.164 - 01:07:42.696, Speaker A: And then we saw Casey Rotemore create ordinals and now there's this kind of renaissance and it's reigniting the debate around this. But it was problem or just an issue or something to think about that sunny flagged and this new especially like Babylon. I think, again, people are going to start talking about the difference between bitcoin with a small B and bitcoin with a capital B in that bitcoin with a large B being the network itself. And then there's the small B, which is Bitcoin, the asset. And I think it's an important distinction to draw that we kind of got into here because what we're talking about exporting is bitcoin, the large B, right? We're talking about the ability to read and write on bitcoin's block space. And that's different from exporting bitcoin with small B the asset. That's an important distinction to dig into, I think.
01:07:42.798 - 01:08:41.656, Speaker C: No, it 100% is, and I think Aidan framed it really well. Every app developer is looking for sovereignty, interoperability and security. And Cosmos has started with the interoperability and the sovereignty, and now they're looking for ways to augment the security piece, right? And Cosmos has a lot of likes to say undercover bitcoin maxis. And so, you know, it makes a lot of sense, I guess, that they would look to bitcoin to potentially be one of the main solutions there, along with all these other security models that are developing, like mesh security, like replicated security. These are all very complementary. And yeah, I think it could be a budding relationship between bitcoin community and this cosmos ecosystem.
01:08:41.848 - 01:09:47.568, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you. I think one of the I'm very interested to see in a lot of ways, there are going to be two ways that this might play or two components that determine how this eventually ends up playing out. There is from the perspective of the app chain builder, kind of the Aiden perspective, right, which is what exactly can bitcoin security do to improve the product that I'm building here? And we kind of talked and I want to get your opinion specifically on what he mentioned about shortening the unbonding period for proof of stake chains or tendermint based proof of stake chains and then the other component that's going to play out here. And frankly, there's not a lot of control here. I think we all just have to watch and see what happens. But this is kind of like the op wars, right, and bitcoin has to decide what the model that it wants for its own block space, right? And do we want to broaden the definition of what can settle to or write or be written in the bitcoin block space? Because the two different solutions that we talked to here had very different design principles in mind. There was Babylon, which was set to specifically minimize the footprint, right, because the thought being, hey, bitcoiners don't like it when you bloat their state.
01:09:47.568 - 01:10:08.904, Speaker A: Right. On the other hand, you don't get the security, the transaction fees from that either. And then you've got the roll kit, which is kind of the opposite of that, and you can actually write all of that data right to the bitcoin blockchain. The issues there being you very quickly run into performance issues and the bitcoiners might not like it. So two very interesting components there.
01:10:09.022 - 01:11:27.730, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. It definitely drives more demand for bitcoin block space, the roll kit approach, but it presents a lot of challenges in terms of the performance of the actual application. And to your point, you may not actually be all that aligned with the bitcoin community, but on the you know, you are basically posting as little data as possible. I thought it know, really interesting from David, I asked him kind of about what do the economics look like here and what would know basically charge chains, that it's helping augment their security. And one way to think about it is, okay, what does it just cost to post this data to bitcoin? You slap a margin on top of that and that's what you charge the proof of stake chain that's leveraging babylon for this. But that's not the way he's thinking about this. Right? He says, what is the value that Babylon is providing to proof of stake chains? Well, that is really determined by how much does the inflation could come down to stakers when you change the unbonding period from 21 days to say, five days or three days.
01:11:27.730 - 01:12:51.310, Speaker C: So, for example, osmosis has, I believe, staking rate right now of 22%, which is the equivalent of millions and millions of dollars per year in value coming out of the emission schedule and going to stakers. That is really determined by, okay, what does the staking rate need to be in order to incentivize enough delegators to stake their osmo and have it be locked up for 21 days? Well, if that's 22%, maybe it comes all the way down to 10%. If the unbonding period was, say, three days or 5 hours. In terms of the actual cost is the value that Babylon is. You know, that also leads me to think, like, people on the bitcoin side are eventually going to be like, okay, well, Babylon's leveraging bitcoin to provide this is, you know, providing millions and millions of dollars of value to proof of stake chains by reducing the unbonding periods. Babylon might see a lot of those economics. Obviously the proof of stake chains get all the benefits of increased security and protocol health.
01:12:51.310 - 01:13:14.540, Speaker C: How does the value or does it at some point flow back to the actual bitcoin community? I think that that's what we kind of touched on it. But this idea of being able to stake your bitcoin is really interesting and seems very similar to eigen layers, what they're coming out with ethereum restaking.
01:13:14.700 - 01:14:05.728, Speaker A: Yeah, Aiden sort of brought that up when we talked about exporting the small B bitcoin. And that. I think if I really thought about it, I think that is going to be something that has to get solved here. Because I do think, just to be totally honest, this is a little bit my read, right? My own opinion here, but I think it'll be a lot easier to get bitcoiners on your side if there's a way to buy some more bitcoin. That being said, the more I think about that, I'm actually not even sure it's super relevant. To the true credit of bitcoin, it is so decentralized that you have kind of the high priests of bitcoin that are saying things like miners might censor these trends. Maybe there's some merit in censoring these transactions or this isn't good, ordinals were kind of generally shamed in the beginning and these were seen as invalid.
01:14:05.728 - 01:14:45.612, Speaker A: There's not much they can do. There's not much they can do. And at the end of the day, this might happen whether bitcoiners like it or not. And there is a concept that I think bitcoin kind of has. It got distribution, right? It got mindshare and distribution and people that care about it. But I don't see the way that it scales beyond that. And what I see in this budding relationship is I thought the other thing that David mentioned that I was really interested in is this could also be almost on a transaction by transaction basis, right? Like, let's say you have one transaction that you care an enormous amount about, maybe you add an additional security guarantee.
01:14:45.612 - 01:15:12.170, Speaker A: Right. I'm sure this model is still being baked out, but that is really interesting. So then suddenly you have transactions that are actually originating on totally separate chains being written to the Bitcoin blockchain. And depending on this is where I think the Bitcoiner's opinion does matter a little bit. Depending on what happens there, it can actually create a meaningful amount of demand for block space and help save their security budget. And that seems to be the big challenge that yeah, exactly.
01:15:12.540 - 01:16:15.688, Speaker C: I think this definitely plays into the security budget, the long term concerns of Bitcoin, basically. But it's always at tension and there's always potentially at ODS with the sanctity of their block space. Right. And it's going to be some trade offs that they need to make. But I think it's really exciting just bringing it back to the chain side, that this is, I guess, Cosmos working backwards to solve the security piece, whereas Ethereum, the Cosmosification of Ethereum is underway and they have the security right. And now they're seeing the value of sovereignty, and that is going to drive the creation of a lot of these app specific roll ups. And then it's just about figuring out the interoperability piece that Cosmos is way ahead of in terms of IPC.
01:16:15.688 - 01:16:29.280, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think it was a great app because it pulled all of this together and we had some very different perspectives. But yeah, thought it made a lot of sense to me.
01:16:29.430 - 01:17:24.532, Speaker A: Yeah. One question that I wish we had asked a little bit more was, I wonder if one of the other things I think Cosmos needs a little bit of an answer for is how is it going to attract users to its products? Right. We really focus on this from the standpoint of you build the best product, what's the security architecture or apparatus that's going to support that product? But then there's the pretty obvious question of how do you go out and get the people that want to use that? And I'm very curious. I think Ordinals showed that there is a large contingency of people within Bitcoin that actually like NFTs and some of these other use cases that we talk about in crypto. I think there are probably a lot of closet bitcoiners in Cosmos land. I think it actually could a partnership between these two communities. Bitcoin is a very large and engaged community.
01:17:24.532 - 01:17:29.364, Speaker A: I think it actually could move the needle on the user side of things as well.
01:17:29.482 - 01:17:30.228, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree.
01:17:30.314 - 01:18:34.948, Speaker C: I think the big question to me is what is the overlap between Bitcoin holders in the Bitcoin community and users of decentralized applications. Right. I would say, like kind of a gross generalization in the last cycle is that a lot of the Bitcoin community would obviously hold their Bitcoin, but they would use it didn't seem like there was a huge overlap between Bitcoin holders and, say, DeFi summer users. It seemed like they were very different. Right. And now that a lot of the centralized applications have gone down and potentially this Bitcoin community was using them, or also it warmed up to the idea of using apps on Ethereum. Can you actually get distribution from Cosmos perspective by tapping into this community? Would they be receptive to using these apps if there's some alignment to Bitcoin?
01:18:35.124 - 01:19:13.252, Speaker A: Yeah, I would bet that overlap, that Venn diagram is bigger than you might think at first. I understand what the public perception of that is, but I've talked to enough Bitcoiners that have crypto punks and use uniswap and are actually on chain users. But there is a big one thing to be aware of is that a lot of people sort of get trapped by their persona, right? You talk about Bitcoin for enough years and it's hard to talk about anything else. Right. And it goes both ways. Right. Let's just be honest, crypto is a super tribal ecosystem, especially on Twitter podcasts or whatever, but I think most people are hearing crypto.
01:19:13.252 - 01:19:18.744, Speaker A: You're at least a relatively curious so I think the overlap is I bet.
01:19:18.782 - 01:19:36.076, Speaker C: That it's bigger than is it compelling enough, this alignment, that it would actually get those users to move over to Cosmos? I don't know. But I agree that's probably a larger of a lap than we give bitcoin community credit know?
01:19:36.098 - 01:20:30.770, Speaker A: Miles just to wrap this all up, one of the most fun parts about these last two episodes, at least for me, is we started talking about the app chain thesis and I think it belongs in Cosmos generally. Right? I think that's where the strongest core community of people that believe in that believe in that idea sort of originated. By the way, I also know we haven't really talked a whole lot about Polkadot on the season, but I know that the folks on Polkadot also sort of believe in this vision. But it's been really cool to see this idea sort of propagate to other ecosystems and that's what was so much fun about the last two episodes. We really saw that tacit almost actually, I would argue explicit embrace coming from optimism with their super chain. And now it was a ton of fun to end with Bitcoin succeeding, proving the app chain thesis in more ways than one.
01:20:31.140 - 01:22:02.430, Speaker C: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I think what would be amazing to see is kind of all of these communities embracing this alignment and working together on the interoperability standards because I think that that is the last piece that connects the Ethereum super chain to app specific chains and Cosmos to even other ecosystems like Polygon, Avalanche, and Polkadot, as we've talked about. And then if these chains all accept some sort of standards around Interoperability, then you can truly let the best possible product define what the infrastructure is like. For dYdX, the infrastructure is a full stack app chain because that's what makes the best possible product. That might not be true for other applications, and they'll stand up their own app specific roll ups on Op chain or on the Celestia stack. And if there was a common standard for interoperability, then it wouldn't have to be as tribal, it wouldn't have to be as zero sum. Right? It's just every application would be able to talk to each other and kind of let the product define what the stack looks like and what their security model looks like.
01:22:02.430 - 01:22:07.484, Speaker C: Coming more and more clear to me that this is probably the last missing link.
01:22:07.682 - 01:22:50.508, Speaker A: You know what's funny about that is you're just reminding me how sometimes how fast Crypto moves, but also how slow it moves as well. The very first event that Blockworks ever did, when Jason and I still had our full time jobs and the name of the event was Cryptoks, this was February of 2018. One of the panels that we hosted was on the subject of Interoperability and the fact that we needed interoperability standards. So it's just funny how anyway, this episode is very full circle for me in a lot of ways, but this is what my way of saying I'm in violent agreement with you there, and it'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
01:22:50.594 - 01:23:40.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. It's been so much fun digging into this, and I think we've heard an awesome range of perspectives from infrastructure builders to application builders and really kind of digging into, I guess, the choices they made and the different trade offs along the way. And we heard that from Maine at the end there exactly the strategic rationale that goes into picking the stack, the security model, and making those choices with the product first. That is the number one goal. You're solving core objectives with the product and letting the stack kind of be whatever makes the best version of that product.
01:23:40.540 - 01:24:05.776, Speaker A: Agreed? Agreed. All right, budy. Well, I think we can wrap it there. And listeners, Miles and I will be back next week, just the two of us, to kind of dissect major learnings and takeaways, and we'll just kind of do a retrospective on the season, even though we kind of bookended a lot of it with this discussion here. But hopefully you all enjoyed this one. I think you can tell from both Miles and I, this was a fun one to do, so hope you all enjoy it.
01:24:05.958 - 01:24:07.070, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks, everyone.
