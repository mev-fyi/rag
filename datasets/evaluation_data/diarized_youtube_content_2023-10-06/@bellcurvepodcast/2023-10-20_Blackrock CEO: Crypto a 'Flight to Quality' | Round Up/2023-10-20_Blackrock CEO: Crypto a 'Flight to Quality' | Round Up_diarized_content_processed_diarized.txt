00:00:26.730 - 00:00:31.634, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. We got Michael's one and two, vance.
00:00:31.762 - 00:00:33.794, Speaker C: And Yano fellas in a minute.
00:00:33.842 - 00:00:34.674, Speaker D: Full squad.
00:00:34.802 - 00:01:27.222, Speaker B: All right, let's talk about let's just start with bitcoin. And there were a whole bunch of different angles that we could go with this week. But I think the big story that we got this week kicked off with was actually a bit of a false start on a story, which was Cointelegraph tweeting out that a spot bitcoin ETF had been approved, or the Ishare spot bitcoin ETF had been approved. The market started to move immediately. Bitcoin ran up about 10% in the span of 2030 minutes. Then people started to ask for sources. The two Bloomberg analysts over at the two ETF analysts over at Bloomberg, james Safert and Eric Balconis, first responded positively, then said, hey, what about the source here? Then Cointelegraph added reportedly to their own tweet, but they were the ones who broke the story.
00:01:27.222 - 00:01:42.762, Speaker B: And then it very quickly, I think. I haven't even looked into how this ended up happening, but it was basically a Telegram chat that someone just saw, that it was like a shit post in a Telegram chat that I guess no one fact check, and it got tweeted out across the main channel.
00:01:42.816 - 00:02:07.522, Speaker A: This is the dissemination of media at its finest. It was a shit post in a Telegram chat. Cointelegraph picks up on it. Cointelegraph writes an article, I think it was either Barron's or Reuters saw that they posted about it, that feeds into the Bloomberg terminal, goes out over the Bloomberg terminal. Bitcoin ETF people at Bloomberg, or excuse me, ETF people at Bloomberg start tweeting about it. Boom, off to the races. Bitcoin pumps shorts, under million.
00:02:07.656 - 00:02:21.034, Speaker C: It's also funny because the ensuing journalist beef, like journalist beef, is very serious. There's a code of ethics. You're supposed to do things a certain way. There's a supply chain, like you were saying, people were pissed as they should be.
00:02:21.072 - 00:02:39.054, Speaker D: Then there was some sort of sort of half hearted explanation afterwards. And then there was also some panel interview where it was basically blamed on social media and the need to move fast in a hyper competitive news environment. And it was too much apologizing. I think they just have to be better.
00:02:39.092 - 00:03:05.378, Speaker A: It was an interesting week for media, actually. I know this isn't what we wanted to talk about, but Decrypt also rescinded a story this week. And then the New York Times changed their headlines a couple of times related to Israel and Hamas and stuff. It did get me thinking about the 2017 blockchain use case that didn't end up happening there's. The blockchain use cases that go to die, like supply chain on the blockchain, healthcare blockchain, putting media on the blockchain.
00:03:05.474 - 00:03:07.094, Speaker D: There's definitely still a market for that.
00:03:07.132 - 00:03:19.980, Speaker C: Community thing that I trust unilaterally, and I think that's like a hopeful version of what media looks like in ten years. But I think for now, we're stuck with Cointelegraph and the cartoons and all of it.
00:03:21.790 - 00:03:45.698, Speaker D: The funny part is one of the things that I always find fascinating, you know, one of the most accurate and timely news sources for any sort of up to date current events, but also up to date events is Wikipedia. Every single time, whoever wins a Super Bowl, whoever wins a game, whoever, someone breaks up with someone, they are on it every single time within like 15 minutes. It's crazy.
00:03:45.864 - 00:03:47.220, Speaker B: How do they do that?
00:03:47.590 - 00:03:53.158, Speaker A: I was even thinking because there's hundreds of millions of people who contribute to it, and then they I don't know.
00:03:53.164 - 00:04:07.994, Speaker D: If there's hundreds of millions, but there's definitely a ton of people, and there's people who are just like, really deeply ensconced within the community. And I don't know, I've actually talked to a couple of Wikipedia editors, and there's like a whole hierarchy to it. If you want to be editing something that has a certain number of page.
00:04:08.032 - 00:04:12.154, Speaker A: Views, 120,000 editors in the last 30.
00:04:12.192 - 00:04:49.442, Speaker B: Days, now we're really going down a rabbit hole here. But have you heard this story about this Chinese woman who spent years just editing fake stuff? Spent like a full decade. The way that it works is when you actually edit Wikipedia, you build up something like a credibility score that's like, oh yeah, this person has been editing for a long time. It's verified by the community that these things are actually right. So she actually spent it was like a decade or something like that, creating small edits that were accurate to build up her score and then falsifying all of this information that went, know, hundreds and thousands of years in Russia.
00:04:49.506 - 00:04:51.942, Speaker C: No more Wikipedia rat holes. Let's talk about the ETF.
00:04:52.006 - 00:05:47.302, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about the ETF. I guess the one interesting thing to point out, other than the journalist malpractice, was the price action of Bitcoin post the ETF, like false start announcement. And so basically, if you're following along on video here, it did run up to just over $30,000. It retraced some of that move, but not all of it, and actually post this sort of false start back earlier this week. Their price action has been sort of bullish and actually running up. It's just under 29,000 at the time of recording. And this is like, outside of my area of expertise, but if I had to summarize the general explanation for this, it would be something like, people were surprised that the market reacted as strongly as quickly to a headline that was pretty false.
00:05:47.302 - 00:06:05.210, Speaker B: So the thinking now is actually if a spot Bitcoin ETF does get approved and that's looking pretty likely by February, then the market probably is going to move. And judging by how people reacted, there are some folks that are off sides. Hence it's probably a good thing to be.
00:06:05.380 - 00:07:07.990, Speaker D: I think the bigger thing to note on this graph is not necessarily what happened in that morning run up, but what happened on the 16th when there wasn't any appeal from the SEC. To your point, I think that's kind of the big moment. Over the last week, the SEC decided not to appeal NBank, and I'm not exactly sure what the details mean per se, but now I think we have seven days, basically until tomorrow to see what the final ruling is or see what the final decision is from the judge. And then it's kind of a question as to where we do it from there. And to your point, I think January 10 is the date or the next decision deadline for Arc and then 14th is BlackRock. I mean they're all kind of lined up for mid January but it seems like because they're not going to appeal, something will happen in that period of time and it could happen sooner, who knows? But yeah, I think there's positive sentiment on the ETF.
00:07:08.970 - 00:07:40.910, Speaker B: Yeah. In addition to that, maybe this was also pre unrelated to this ETF announcement. But you do have a couple of the sort of blessed folks from Macro or TradFi. This happened last week. We talked about a little bit. The Paul Tudor Jones came out saying that he likes what he calls the barbarous relics being gold and bitcoin. This week you had Larry Fink going on CNBC and talking about crypto being a flight quality asset.
00:07:40.910 - 00:08:12.938, Speaker B: Some sort of geopolitical hedge. Which mean, Vance, I saw you tweeted out about mean I had to do a double take. Watching a that's a guy who's very serious, understands the impacts of his know. I feel like that's significant. And there could be maybe a changing of the tides is too much too soon. But I think it is important for TradFi buyers who we want to unlock here. They need people that they respect and look up to essentially blessing this stuff.
00:08:12.938 - 00:08:16.220, Speaker B: So feels significant but curious to get your guys take.
00:08:16.910 - 00:09:13.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I think on one hand the expectations are so high for this thing that almost anything will be viewed as like a disappointment other than tens of billions of dollars. On the other hand, you have Larry Fink who not only is positive now but has called it an index of money laundering in the past where if you make it at 180 turn like that, you got to come with more than just like bitcoin is great. You have to call your friends, you have to tell them about it. You're putting your reputation on the line and your reputation being preserved as some function of the inflows, not maybe of the first day, but the first month, the first year. I think that's kind of like where the rubber meets the road and they have a ton of salespeople and a ton of distribution. And this is not going to be the last ETF either. And so there was a good economist profile on Larry Fink about how he went head over heels into ESG.
00:09:13.894 - 00:09:50.358, Speaker C: And he's kind of like a guy that has historically been very good at reading the temperature of the room, which direction the wind is blowing, which assets are likely to be hot next, and ESG, for all the shit it gets, it was the hottest investment trend for almost ten years. And so you go from that to being on Fox News and talking about bitcoin. It's just like a huge shift. And so I think this is really the Super Bowl. It's 7 trillion of registered investment advisor assets. If you get a couple of percent of that, that's extremely, extremely meaningful. And if you think about how a bull market can come about, there's probably two paths.
00:09:50.358 - 00:10:24.322, Speaker C: One is institutionally led, kind of like what we're seeing right now, and that's where we say, we have regulatory clarity, we've cleaned up the space. BlackRock has the biggest ETF. It's blessed, you can put it in your 401, et cetera. The other path is like, we do a grassroots, like we build a game, we scale DFI, that type of stuff. And I think the latter is happening, but just like the institutional side is happening first. And so that's what the run is going to be shaped by. It's going to be like the Larry Fink cycle, whatever you want to call it, it doesn't matter.
00:10:24.322 - 00:10:53.210, Speaker C: But it is about Wall Street getting their fill, getting a restart, basically on crypto from like three years ago, prices against the backdrop of, frankly, gold ripping. And gold is like bitcoin, the deficits narratives around bills or debt not being bought, interest rates going higher just because supply overwhelms demand. It is a very constructive narrative for him to pivot into, and frankly, it just seems smart. So I think it's cool. It's great for the space.
00:10:53.280 - 00:11:25.766, Speaker B: I would tend to agree with you there. What do you think about I mean, there's been I can get the chart up here in a second, but I feel like Twitter loves to focus quite a bit on ETH, BTC, as a ratio, as just sort of a relative. I don't know how you guys feel about it. I've never viewed it as super important, but it has been in a downtrend for a little while. I mean, I'd be curious how you guys think about the concept of the ETH bitcoin ratio, whether or not it factors into your process in any way at all or I don't know. How do you think?
00:11:25.788 - 00:11:55.486, Speaker C: I feel like some people make the BTC ratio, like their whole personality, basically. And it's important not to do that. And if you think about it, it's pretty classic. Like beginning of Bull Run, BTC dominance runs. Someone like a sailor steps up and says, this is actually gold for real this time. You get that drive down in Alts. And if you look at Alts, a lot of them are making there's a few, they're doing well, but a lot of them are making lower lows and you're searching for what is actually deep value there.
00:11:55.486 - 00:12:24.806, Speaker C: And so there is this rhythm to all of this where it's like bitcoin goes up because it's digital gold. It has no fundamentals, it doesn't need to. Then you have progress on the app layer. And the reason why we're positive and hold ETH is because it's like bitcoin, you're just buying and you're along for the ride. You hope it happens. The digital gold comparisons are apt for ETH. I'm more bullish, and I think this is probably contrarian on the long term fee market of what happens on chain.
00:12:24.806 - 00:13:11.734, Speaker C: And mostly just because real world assets and tokenizing treasuries, those are things that you can stick in an AMM. You can leave a little bit on the table in terms of mev or yield for people to capture in TradFi, but that's like a system that will produce a ton of fees that is relatively price insensitive to the gas costs. They just need nuclear grade censorship resistance, and so that'll play out probably next year. I think that'll kind of be the defining trend of what happens on ETH. When stablecoins hit ETH in the last cycle, people are like, wow, you've actually built something useful like a use case. Now it's like, okay, if we can bring enough T bills on chain and maybe 10 billion is enough, maybe it's like 50 or 100, you kind of have to start paying attention and you'll have that. You'll have the spikes in gas fees.
00:13:11.734 - 00:13:21.094, Speaker C: But I'm bullish on what we're building. It's much more different than having this bullish on almost like bullish gold view that comes with bitcoin.
00:13:21.142 - 00:14:04.054, Speaker D: The only thing I'd add to that totally agree with everything. I think there is also going to be the same kind of a rising tide floats all boats perspective with ETH as well. When bitcoin gets the attention that I think it will, ETH has a futures. ETF already there's already been two filings that are for ETH. Spot ETFs. I think you're going to start to look at there's sort of the digital gold narrative and then there's maybe like the digital oil. And I know that that's probably a narrative that hasn't been used in a couple of years, but I think you'll start to see a lot of interest from investors looking at ETH as sort of the Internet oil that's powering these different applications, that's powering these different ecosystems.
00:14:04.054 - 00:14:28.482, Speaker D: Real world assets on chain, real yield driving value to applications. And yeah, I mean, there's definitely a divergence with the chart that we're looking at right now. And ETH BTC is down. But historically, every single bull market has moved the same way, which is BTC moves first, ETH moves second, and then all the application protocol tokens move after that.
00:14:28.616 - 00:15:07.838, Speaker B: That's what I was the point that I was going to make by putting these two charts together, it's not like a dunk on anything. It's just I feel like this is more indicative of where we are in the cycle, which is typically around this far into a bear market. Bitcoin dominance tends to go on a run. The trend of bitcoin dominance over time is lower and lower and lower as more stuff gets built outside of bitcoin. But I don't know, that's why I think ETH bitcoin is kind of an interesting ratio to pay attention to. For me, it just tells you where you are in the cycle. But I don't know, people like to say, like, this is the future of these two assets, and that's not the.
00:15:07.844 - 00:15:35.480, Speaker D: Way that I would I mean, roll it back all the way. You don't have to. It's a long chart, but roll it all back to 2019. I had friends that we were looking at making investments in protocol tokens that did exceedingly well. And their narrative was, I'd rather just hold bitcoin and not invest in one of those assets. Some of those assets did way better than bitcoin. The other asset that did really well over that period of time and much better than bitcoin was ETH, because ETH was trading at about $200 at that point.
00:15:35.480 - 00:15:46.554, Speaker D: So I think there is an element of history definitely gives us some direction in terms of how this stuff will play out. And it's playing out the same way that it did in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
00:15:46.672 - 00:16:13.202, Speaker A: People also just forget how quickly the narrative turns, right? Bitcoin ETF gets approved, bitcoin's off to the races for one month. People will be focused on bitcoin one month later. The question becomes, what's next? And then people start talking about an ETH ETF, and then people start looking at some of the application and different protocols that are off to the races and getting users again because the price is going back up and bitcoin leads, but the attention moves very quickly.
00:16:13.336 - 00:16:41.510, Speaker D: And it's really sensible when you think about it, as to why that's the case. It's because think about what it's like when you're sitting around an investment committee or hypothetical investment committee and you're saying, hey, we're going to go put some capital into bitcoin, we're going to try this crypto thing. I know it's gotten fleeced. You had all the fraud. This time around, it's going to be different. But if you can convince people to put money into a Bitcoin ETF, let's say, then that works. Then the question becomes, okay, maybe we should upper allocation.
00:16:41.510 - 00:16:59.774, Speaker D: Maybe this thing actually has legs this time around and you start to trickle down the effects of, okay, what's next? What's working flight to quality narrative is going to be? And by the way, Larry Fink didn't say bitcoin on that interview. He said crypto. Yeah, which is very different. I think there's going to be it's not just going to be bitcoin.
00:16:59.902 - 00:18:03.880, Speaker C: That definitely rides last thing on this, if you take the 50,000 foot view and you think that digital money is important and it's going to be a concept that stands the test of time, I personally do unsurprising. But I think the world is also kind of heading in a direction where that concept is more relevant. The question is, can you create effective, self sustaining Internet money? And I was just thinking about bitcoin. It's like, man, the bitcoin future happens and I guess it is digital gold, but it also has no fees. And in the near term, in the ten year perspective, probably that doesn't matter. But long, long term, it's like, what is the more efficient, sustainable money? Is it something that's proof of stake that burns some of the fees and that has endogenous fee markets from DA and settlement? Or is it something that's proof of work powered by electricity? I think you can construct arguments for both. One argument for bitcoin is that energy prices are going to go to zero.
00:18:03.880 - 00:18:33.454, Speaker C: Maybe, but it seems like energy prices are going to go higher. And so what are the bullish things that ETH has going for it? It's an extremely lightweight Internet money that has a lot of users that people use in different transactions and that is gaining a monetary premium across chains. I still think about that over the fullness of time and ordinals are cool and Lightning is cool, but it just doesn't add up economically. So that's kind of the last thing that I have to say about it.
00:18:33.492 - 00:19:13.520, Speaker A: Let's go to another story that's related to the ETF, which is so the New York AG this week filed a claim against a couple companies where they argued that one, Gemini misrepresented its earned product. They said that Gemini marketed their earned product as liquid and safe and that it was not. But even more powerful is they said that Genesis, DCG and they kind of called out two folks in particular, barry Silbert and Michael Morrow, quote, disguised 1.1 billion in losses through a months long campaign of misstatements emissions and concealments. Would love to get your guys'take on this.
00:19:16.050 - 00:19:17.360, Speaker D: It's a big one.
00:19:18.770 - 00:19:22.394, Speaker C: That's your big boy right there. Is it civil?
00:19:22.522 - 00:19:23.200, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:19:25.590 - 00:19:26.942, Speaker A: I think it's civil.
00:19:27.086 - 00:19:41.946, Speaker D: Well, but what they're asking for, which is probably a huge blow, obviously, is that the people involved would not be able to sell securities in New York ever again. Turn in your license and you're is Barry.
00:19:41.998 - 00:20:04.750, Speaker A: This is Barry giving it up. So I think one of the important things that wasn't really tweeted about was 230 they specifically called out 230,000 investors. So this is not, I think, in like, media terms, it's not a B to B case. This is a B to C case. They're talking about the 230,000 investors that got crushed from Genesis and then inherently Gemini.
00:20:05.890 - 00:20:13.434, Speaker D: Yeah, it's all via Gemini. But Genesis was the vacuum. Remember, Genesis was the only party, the only counterparty to Gemini. Gemini earning product.
00:20:13.492 - 00:20:18.286, Speaker A: Let me pull up these look at these crazy stats. 50 billion.
00:20:18.478 - 00:20:20.238, Speaker C: I know, this is so wild.
00:20:20.334 - 00:20:57.546, Speaker A: Q four 2021 market snapshot of Genesis's activity. 50 billion in loan originations. Total active loans of twelve and a half billion. 31 billion of spot volume traded, and 21 billion of notional derivatives traded. I was saying this Asante earlier today. I think people who were around in crypto in 2013 and 2014, remember, Mount Gox is like sitting at the middle of everything in crypto. But people who come into crypto today is like mount Gox is almost this mythological thing that you can't really imagine.
00:20:57.546 - 00:21:20.760, Speaker A: It for people who come into the industry now and forever after. Genesis will just be this thing that they never really felt. But Genesis sat at the middle of everything in crypto. They sat at the center of everything. Any CFI product that offered a yield, babel or Gemini or Blockfire, any of these products, genesis sat behind that.
00:21:23.930 - 00:22:01.806, Speaker C: Look at that. Those numbers fit with the FTX case, too, right? It's like 13 billion lent by them. Another couple of billion from Voyager, another couple of billion from Celsius, another couple of billion from Blockfly. There's probably 20 billion of aggregate credit created by these now bankrupt entities. And I read a little bit of the letitia james she's, the AG for New York charges against Barry and Co. At one point, I think it was at this point, 60% of all loans were to Alameda. All of the loans through Gemini were to Alameda.
00:22:01.998 - 00:22:04.130, Speaker A: They lent them 2.4 billion.
00:22:05.990 - 00:23:03.378, Speaker C: Between friends, who knows? But it kind of punches a hole in the Gemini story that we're victims. It's like, are you victims or are you people that are not doing any due diligence and trying to just offshore that risk to somebody else? Seems more like the latter. And I think to tie it all together with the ETF, if you can't issue securities in New York, can you? GBTC ETF on the New York Stock Exchange? So let's tie it all together. Gary Gensler interview, he's saying it's not about the security, it's about the issuer, and we're going to have to go issue by issuer. Well, he said it's about they're equally as important. And so GBTC getting a conversion very different than a general spot ETF being approved. And I think the only way that you can say that the institutional phase of crypto has started is if BlackRock or a bigger guy has the biggest ETF.
00:23:03.378 - 00:23:13.638, Speaker C: If it's still GBTC, I don't think that's enough of like a mission accomplished type moment. So I would expect the GBTC stuff to get more pushed out somehow.
00:23:13.734 - 00:23:30.560, Speaker B: Do you? I don't understand the complex legal arrangements that the DCG empire had. I mean, is there a chance that this is a complaint against Genesis? That GBTC and Grayscale would be firewalled from that and not impacted, or you think.
00:23:33.730 - 00:23:49.126, Speaker D: So? Yes, there is a chance. I don't understand exactly the separation. I know they're separate companies. DCG is the parent company. Genesis was one of the subsidiaries, along with Grayscale, who creates GBTC. They're just related entities, I think. We don't know.
00:23:49.126 - 00:24:18.686, Speaker D: You would assume that there is no way that if this happens that you'd be able to convert, but it's something that we won't know for a long time and probably is independent of the conversion itself for now. I think the bigger point is, is this a reason to prevent an issuer? I mean, there's literally a charge, multiple charges. Is there a reason to prevent an issuer from being the first out of the gate? And I'm obviously not a lawyer, this feels like a reason.
00:24:18.868 - 00:24:30.180, Speaker A: The argument that they're separate entities goes out the door when you see that Genesis had a $1.1 billion loss and then DCG has given them 1.1 billion at a ten year, 1% rate.
00:24:30.550 - 00:24:43.958, Speaker D: That argument is nullified now, intuitively, yes, that makes sense. And that's exactly, I'm sure, what the prosecutors will be arguing. I just don't know what the legal standards are for piercing the corporate veil in that respect and saying, these are.
00:24:43.964 - 00:24:45.426, Speaker B: All one N. They were also forced.
00:24:45.458 - 00:25:00.330, Speaker C: To halt deposits, like, last week or the week before that. That was kind of like, underreported, I thought. But my first instinct was, like, who is still there? Who is still trading on a bankruptcy, theoretically bankrupt exchange.
00:25:01.550 - 00:25:03.926, Speaker D: I honestly thought that was a fake tweet.
00:25:03.958 - 00:25:56.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw that too. I was just confused, like, how many times has Genesis been shut down at this point? Either? I don't know. But let me ask you this. What do you think the implications are if GBTC can't convert? Like, what is the impact on inflows into the spot ETF? Because then you sort of have this trapped I don't know, how much AUM do they still have? Is it like 20, 30 billion, something like that in GBTC a lot? Something like that, yeah. I don't even know how to game that out, really, because theoretically, he would have converted that into an ETF. Now you're going to have that money just trapped there. Does that impact other ETFs at all? Or is that just sorry, why is that trapped there? Assuming that it's still at a discount to net asset value, people won't want to redeem.
00:25:56.378 - 00:25:59.438, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's been at a discount for so long, people probably bought it.
00:25:59.524 - 00:26:01.134, Speaker D: And getting charged 2% a year.
00:26:01.172 - 00:26:01.758, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:01.924 - 00:26:06.430, Speaker A: Why wouldn't you just get out? If you bought it at a discount, you're probably up. Well, if you bought it a discount.
00:26:07.490 - 00:26:18.918, Speaker B: I think probably a lot of people didn't buy at a discount. I don't know, but I bet a lot of people didn't. A lot of people bought at a premium, actually. I think that the fact of the.
00:26:18.924 - 00:27:02.286, Speaker D: Matter is the people who are getting sold this product, or this hypothetical product from Ark in BlackRock, et cetera, et cetera, are not the people who put into the GBTC fund. I think they're net new. So I don't know if that has any effect whatsoever. Maybe it actually has the opposite effect, which is people will be more incentivized to move over faster. So maybe the redemptions of GBTC will happen if that conversion doesn't happen versus just sitting there as latent ownership of a bitcoin ETF versus the fund. And you're happy because A, the spread closed, and B, you're not getting charged 2% anymore. But if GBC doesn't get approved or converted, maybe that will actually flow into a new ETF faster.
00:27:02.318 - 00:27:12.022, Speaker C: It's impossible to buy GBTC right now. You literally can't get a broker to let you do it, especially on the retail level. So assume everything is net new.
00:27:12.076 - 00:27:13.880, Speaker B: Sorry, why is it difficult?
00:27:14.330 - 00:27:20.010, Speaker C: Just like from the brokers we've talked to, it feels like there's been this de facto ban on offering this to clients.
00:27:23.470 - 00:27:25.740, Speaker D: You have to be sort of grandfathered in.
00:27:28.030 - 00:27:42.654, Speaker C: So yeah, I think most of the people probably don't even notice it's trading at a discount. It's probably stuffed in their retirement account somewhere. That would be my guess. I guess they do run a lot of ads, but to what end? You can't really access it.
00:27:42.772 - 00:28:22.730, Speaker B: How would you look at the spot ETF as a catalyst? There are sort of two benefits from my vantage point, which is you're theoretically opening Bitcoin up to a whole new level of buyers, depending on how many people just haven't bought because they've been waiting for it. Or it's just sort of the idea that people would feel safer buying Bitcoin or crypto overall because it's a part of the US regulatory apparatus and there's a big issuer, like kind of obviously those are related things. But is it the buy pressure that is the bullish thing here, that's the major part of the catalyst? Or is it just like, yeah, this is a legitimate asset?
00:28:23.470 - 00:29:14.986, Speaker C: Mean, like I said, the expectations are super high. So I think crypto Twitter is so discerning that anything less than a billion dollars of inflows is probably going to be disappointment. And there's also this redemption supply catalyst, which is not immediately great, but the whole thing is the Winklevoss filed for this ETF like eleven years ago. But what the space has been building up to for over a decade is the final institutionalization of at least one coin, which would lead to many more. And so I think it's just the beginning of that journey. And I think if Gold and Macro is cooperative, which could be. A various range of scenarios.
00:29:14.986 - 00:29:49.538, Speaker C: It could be a big recession hits and they start easing. It could be some sort of other financial accident. It could be gold just starts ripping. But I think the setup is favorable. All the dovish talk from the Fed governors this week, it's clear that they were kind of spooked by the long term bonds going down and the yields going up. So it kind of feels like if it's going to be anytime, it's probably going to be now. I don't think this would have mattered last year, honestly.
00:29:49.538 - 00:30:25.006, Speaker C: It would have been too much noise and not the right macro. You want to buy bitcoin with rates going up and they're probably going to double. No one would want to do that. But I was thinking about this today. If you're like some guy sitting in an investment bank and you're making like 8% or 9% on your cash because you're connected, what price movement of bitcoin gets your attention from? Thirty k? It probably gets to you're like, all right, I missed the first leg, I'm not going to miss the second. The burden is higher because the interest rates are higher, but it is possible just because of the setup.
00:30:25.198 - 00:31:05.038, Speaker D: The only thing I would add is the downside perspective here is that as we saw with what happened, the ramp up to 30, the ramp back down and then kind of the slow creep back in. That chart is that this is going to be priced in by the time it happens, and there's going to be a kind of sell the news moment. And I think I could see an argument where people who wanted to buy bitcoin, even if it's in their 401K, have been able to do that with fidelity for a long time. People who wanted to buy bitcoin not in a 401K have been able to do that with coinbase for a long time. Maybe there isn't as much demand as we think there is, but the only way for us to figure that out is if it launches.
00:31:05.214 - 00:32:13.986, Speaker B: So what I was going to ask you guys is how would you gauge the overall sentiment out there? And what I'm kind of wondering is I think it's a little bit mixed, actually, because I think there are actually, quietly, a lot of people, especially businesses in crypto. It's been tough sleding for the last 18 months, going on two years, and there are definitely a lot of companies out there that are just like, hurting and they're like, hey, we need a return to the bull market. And I think a lot of them are hoping more than anything else for an ETF or having or catalysts or whatever. But I also think there's been a lot of emotional damage and scarring over the last two years, which also tends to happen around the last legs, knock on wood of bear markets where we can't just believe, obviously good catalysts. And I don't know we've talked about on this podcast, but it's kind of like could we just be overthinking it? And the having plus a BlackRock ETF is like, that's got to be good, right? I don't know. And I know Vance, you've been in New York a little bit talking with some more TradFi esque sort of folks. Like, I'd be curious what the sentiment is around them, around crypto.
00:32:13.986 - 00:32:15.542, Speaker B: I would guess it's rock bottom, but.
00:32:15.596 - 00:32:56.340, Speaker C: I mean, at least makes me pretty optimistic know, crypto is like thoroughly off people's radar, at least at the institutional size. And they're like call me when the ETF gets approved. But they're bullish on things that kind of look and feel like crypto or other high quality digital assets. Like they're all crowded into the same seven tech stocks. They all believe that growth story that could be a correlator for something like ETH if you build something really impressive on it. They're all bullish on gold. People think at least kind of in the Wall Street communities that I've kind of been a part of, gold could double or triple just because central banks are buying it.
00:32:56.340 - 00:33:46.594, Speaker C: It's like a very lame idea, but if you look at the gold chart, you want to pull the gold chart up the long term one and there's hundreds of years of price history or whatever, but it does look like it's the world's largest asset at 12 trillion. But if anything, it looks like it's going to break out over a long term time horizon. It's probably gold. And so for them it's like, do you want something that has a bit more alpha? It's a bit younger, it's a bit more zeitgeisty, it's constantly online. In a way gold is not like bitcoin it's right there. And so I can see kind of the early innings of people starting to construct a bullish thesis on crypto. The other thing that's kind of interesting about gold is the ETF corollaries, the Spider Gold Trust launched in November 2004.
00:33:46.594 - 00:34:20.586, Speaker C: So just to the left of where this chart is and look what happened to the price. That's kind of where people's minds are going. And guess who was the chairman of the CFTC when the gold ETF got approved? It was Gary Gensler. And there was this same sort of dichotomy of like he's trying to keep the ETF caged up. The price is being suppressed, the bankers are trying to get us. And so there's enough corollaries, there's enough evidence, there's enough of a lack of anything else to invest in. Also that kind of leads people towards crypto and the Wall Street crypto crowd.
00:34:20.586 - 00:34:25.834, Speaker C: There's a lot of overlap of people who are just doing it nights and weekends. That's been another thing that I've noticed.
00:34:25.882 - 00:34:55.594, Speaker A: I think a good signal for when the market is ready to rip is and Mike, we talked about this, I remember over beers about a year ago, is when the market goes up 50% to 100% and nobody says a thing and nobody even notices. And bitcoin itself is the best performing asset class of all of 2023. Right? Large cap growth in the US is up like 25, 30%. An index of commodities is up like 510 percent. Bitcoin is up like 60, 65% on the year. Nobody said a thing. Doesn't feel like that.
00:34:55.632 - 00:35:02.762, Speaker C: When has that ever happened? The top performing asset now has Wall Street. You can build the narrative Legos, so.
00:35:02.896 - 00:35:40.998, Speaker A: At a certain point you can't ignore it. And the two catalysts is, like, to go back to Mike's thing is like, you can't ignore it when the price goes up 100%, especially if you are a financial advisor. And we just had Matt Hogan and Hunter from Bitwise on the Empire podcast with Santi, and they laid out this stat that I didn't know, which is retail controls 20% of the wealth in the US. Institutions control 40% of the wealth in the US. Financial advisors control the other 40% of wealth in the US. And right now it's really hard for financial advisors to recommend Bitcoin because you're not incentivized on it.
00:35:41.164 - 00:35:41.542, Speaker C: Right?
00:35:41.596 - 00:35:49.574, Speaker A: So if you recommend that your client buys Bitcoin, michael, you're saying they can access bitcoin in their coinbase.
00:35:49.622 - 00:35:49.882, Speaker C: Sure.
00:35:49.936 - 00:35:52.886, Speaker A: But if you're a financial advisor, you don't get paid on that.
00:35:53.008 - 00:35:53.818, Speaker D: Totally.
00:35:53.994 - 00:36:06.138, Speaker A: What the Bitcoin ETF does is it allows financial advisors to recommend it to their clients, not because they haven't been able to in the past, but because now they can get paid on that. And that is a big catalyst in my opinion.
00:36:06.314 - 00:36:50.318, Speaker D: Totally agree with that. We were also meeting with a couple of our LPs over the last few weeks and just asking them what the LP market is right now. And they're out raising funds, obviously deploying into other funds. They said that there is a direct one to one or one correlation, correlation of one to how much money they raise for blockchain specific funds with the price of crypto, the value of crypto, which is hilarious, but think about the psychology of that. It's people want to deploy into crypto funds or venture crypto funds when Bitcoin and ETH are ripping. And I think the wealth effect or sort of success or price action will but get more price action, I think that that's also going to be a huge narrative that takes over.
00:36:50.484 - 00:37:15.640, Speaker B: So how do you guys remember experiencing 2019? What was your mental state? What do you think? The industry? Where was the industry at? I remember it as this barren wasteland of lost hopes and dreams at that. I think people were way more beaten down then than they are now. I'm starting to see people come out and say, this is as bad as it was back then. I still don't think.
00:37:17.870 - 00:37:54.114, Speaker C: The alt communities that are pick a coin, I'm not going to pick on any coin, but all the alts are down like 95% to 99%. And you go in those communities, some are building, some are having fun, but the vibes are like death march terrible. Like, when you're down that much, that just mentally will do something to you. Last cycle, the majors were down that much. Bitcoin was peaked at 20K. Then it went to three K, that's down 85%. ETH went to 1400.
00:37:54.114 - 00:38:05.240, Speaker C: Then it was at 80. That's down 95%. The sentiment that was in the alts last time or on the alts this time was in the majors last time. So think about how desolate that was.
00:38:05.850 - 00:38:11.110, Speaker B: And there was just nothing really either. I mean, there was like, the beginnings of some alts. That could be something.
00:38:11.180 - 00:38:48.342, Speaker D: But let me provide a different perspective, a similar but from a different angle. 2019, when everything blew up. 2018. 2019. Remember, the chairman of the SEC basically pushed us off as an industry and was, like, too small, too irrelevant to regulate. And that's kind of what know, we kind of blew up ourselves in this fringe corner of the Internet, and nobody really other than us noticed, whereas now you've literally got the committee meeting after committee meeting on Capitol Hill. You've got draft bills that are working their way through the House.
00:38:48.342 - 00:39:18.414, Speaker D: You've got the most popular business story in the world right now. Maybe business story, maybe not total story in the world right now, which is a case against one of our former superstars, and now everybody knows about it. It's kind of negative in that respect, but the positive sentiment of that is that everybody knows about it. So when things come back, everyone will be like, okay, it's back. They've cleansed themselves. I know about it. I know what it is.
00:39:18.414 - 00:39:22.518, Speaker D: And the market just gets to be ten times larger.
00:39:22.554 - 00:39:33.300, Speaker C: I'm so over the case. I'm so over the SPF case. Just like a reality TV show. I don't think anybody cares more than the reporters themselves.
00:39:34.870 - 00:39:51.574, Speaker B: This is what happened. This was the price action for Bitcoin in 2019, which was like, if you just looked at this and you didn't know the backdrop or the context of what we were just talking about, you'd be like, wow, this is a really good year. Bitcoin more than doubled, and I'm just picking out Bitcoin.
00:39:51.702 - 00:39:58.138, Speaker C: That year sucked. I can tell you every dot on that chart how I was feeling, and it was not great.
00:39:58.304 - 00:40:05.918, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a brutal year, but I'm just saying, like, if you looked at that chart in isolation, you'd be like, that looks like you look like.
00:40:06.004 - 00:40:23.540, Speaker C: You look at Bitcoin and east now, and you're like, not that from their all time. They're not that far down. Like, bitcoins was, like, 68. It's at, like, 30. Basically. ETH was at 4900. That's not trying to go from 80 to 1400.
00:40:23.540 - 00:41:18.814, Speaker C: I remember joking about people at East Denver in 2019, like, east to one K. It's like, fuck, I hope so. It's just not that bad anymore. So I think the one thing we're still looking for is what does deep value and alts really look like? How bad can it really get? Because there's only 21 million bitcoin alts just have a lot of unlocking supply so that's more situation dependent. Like seeing blur price action has just been pretty wild to see it just drop like a stone and that's like a well regarded primitive backed by a well known firm with well known founders. Some projects are on the tail end of those lockups, some are frankly just starting like Aptos and Swee and all that stuff. Those are like years long emission schedules.
00:41:18.814 - 00:41:21.318, Speaker C: We're going to have to just sort that out at some point.
00:41:21.484 - 00:42:24.970, Speaker B: One thing I'd love to just outside of just market commentary, I'd love to get your guys take on the uni fee switch thing that happened this week, which was this was not the fee switch that we'd been talking. About which was going to be actual fee switches on, like V three pools where the funds would flow to the Dow and theoretically accrue to the token. This was put into place by Uniswap Labs. And sure most folks who are listening on this podcast know, but there is a Dao entity which governs the protocol and the token. And then there's a Labs entity which is a much more traditional centralized company which is funded by VCs and they are like a for profit, much more traditional. And the overall relationship is that there's the Uniswap protocol which is governed by the Dao and token and then Uniswap Labs builds products on top of that, namely the front end and the wallet. So the distinction here is that this was a 15 basis point fee that got added on some tokens only on the Uniswap Labs created front ends.
00:42:27.470 - 00:42:45.666, Speaker D: Frankly, I'm surprised that there was surprise here. The second that they raised money for Uniswap Labs, whatever that was like six months ago, everybody should have known that this was coming. You're not just going to throw money into a company because you expect them to be good stewards of the protocol. They're going to build products that are going to be able to make money and that's the whole and hopefully that.
00:42:45.688 - 00:43:17.658, Speaker C: Makes you money if you're a token mean. I do think it is a travesty just like the know rules and regulations around this stuff where you haven't been able to turn on the fee switch and people are just left there like holding the bag. I think it's not dissimilar to a GBTC or some other eventual promise of value or redemption or something like that. But they have every right to charge a fee on the front end that they maintain, that they fight tooth and nail with regulators and all sorts of people for. So if you don't like it, just use a different front end.
00:43:17.744 - 00:43:50.230, Speaker D: Keep in mind, I mean the way that at least it seems that the regulations are trending. There will have to be a lot of things that uniswap labs and the front ends that they maintain in a centralized way, they'll have to do, which is like KYC AML, they're going to have to maintain suspicious activity reports. They're going to get regulated in a pretty deep think. You know, that's an element here too, that people need to remember. If you want to use the clean Apple supported interface to trade or to buy or swap tokens, it's going to come with extra bells and whistles than just using a DeFi interface.
00:43:51.290 - 00:44:14.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's well, some I saw some of the competitors to Uniswap try to dunk on the fee as if they weren't also charging fees just in an even less transparent way. So you got to give this to Uniswap. And it was sort of an L for won't name any names, but yeah, there were a couple of other protocols that were like, hey, we don't charge fees, come over here. And then it was like, yeah, those.
00:44:15.012 - 00:44:31.140, Speaker C: Protocols which should not be named have internalized basically all of the fees. I think we got to be affirming each other and building each other up, not trying to piss on someone's parade when they're trying to build a sustainable business. That's poor form.
00:44:31.510 - 00:45:25.774, Speaker B: Vance, you were sort of talking about, do you think there's the opportunity for this to actually be the first real institutional cycle for crypto? And I don't know. One thing I was thinking about, with the benefit of hindsight is a significant moment for stablecoins. In the last cycle, which was also in the doldrums, was Libra coming out and saying, or Facebook coming out and saying, we're going to build a stablecoin. And it obviously wasn't 100% because of Libra, which ended up falling apart. But that did catalyze this insane bull market in do wonder. I do wonder if there could be some similar effect here. I don't want to overstate it because it's one CNBC interview and I know I'm biased and I want this to be the case, but we've never had anyone like Larry Fink come out and know crypto is a flight to quality safe haven type asset.
00:45:25.774 - 00:45:44.106, Speaker B: There's even a big difference between Paul Tudor Jones saying something like this and Larry Fink, because Paul Tudor Jones, yeah, he controls money, but it's really mostly his money and he's a hedge fund guy and he'll get in and out of trades. Like, Larry Fink is at the very top of the world of institutional finance. He through BlackRock controls I don't even know what it is.
00:45:44.128 - 00:45:46.442, Speaker D: Eight or nine largest asset manager in the world.
00:45:46.496 - 00:46:07.938, Speaker B: Yeah, largest asset manager in the world. I don't know. I mean, this could be the first cycle where we get real institutional money that isn't just kind of web two VCs taking big punts or not knowing what they're doing or I don't know. Last cycle was kind of institutional, but kind of not really at the same.
00:46:08.104 - 00:46:51.598, Speaker C: So just to tie it all, like, a lot of the people who use Genesis in last few years were based in New York. It was known as the New York City Wall Street style investment bank. And a lot of those people are stuck or know people who are and so that only leads them to kind of be more and more like this is a scam and that's just like a group of people we can't afford to isolate. They literally control all the money. Just like not a good idea. So whether you like or don't like Larry Fink, having him as the cheerleader, as the world's largest asset manager, mobilizing his sales force, telling his friends, is it going to be a disappointment on day one? Depends on where expectations are. And if Bitcoin rips like 30% higher, of course it probably has that chance.
00:46:51.598 - 00:47:39.722, Speaker C: But it's about the first year or the first few years and also what the macro backdrop is doing. And I think it was like we had this COVID sugar high. All the arguments Sailor was making at that point in time were like, this could happen. We hadn't experienced any of the inflation when he started buying in late 2020, we had an idea that it might happen. But now it's like all those chickens have come home to roost and it's kind of chaotic feeling and Bitcoin and ETH and other currencies that are sustainable are probably going to do decently well if there's institutional adoption. So I think it's the beginning of a journey that has taken ten years to start. When the Winklevoss filed this, this is kind of what you play for as an asset manager.
00:47:39.866 - 00:48:19.290, Speaker D: The number one thing that I would say is holding back the industry, and I know we've talked about this ad nauseam before, is lack of regulatory clarity and we're not going to get it anytime soon, it's not going to happen in the next three months. But the first thing that will happen it seems like is a bitcoin spot ETF, which is in itself sort of regulatory clarity on one aspect, a major aspect of this industry. And I think that there are a lot of people that are waiting on the sidelines for that and hopefully that's just the start of the process of getting more pro crypto regulations done. But it'll trickle down just like we've seen with the wealth effect flowing through the market ecosystem.
00:48:19.790 - 00:49:23.502, Speaker B: One thing just to note as well on your point Vance, about it not being about immediately the inflows versus the year, at least the last having, the price didn't immediately skyrocket in May when the having occurred. It took a couple of months until September, October from my memory, for the price to start running up. And so just maybe a point about expectations going into the having obviously the spot ETF and if and when that approves would obviously impact that. But the other thing that I would say about the regulatory point is that I've heard Matt Levine and Jim Chenos talk about this as a framework and I think it's relatively true. When price is going up there's not much demand out there in the public to regulate things and it's like, oh, well, maybe this stuff is actually really useful and we should adopt it and do all these things. And then when the price goes down, people start looking for blood and someone to blame. And that's when the SEC and other regulatory bodies are at kind of peak public interest for regulating, which is what we've been seeing for the last year or so.
00:49:23.502 - 00:49:45.414, Speaker B: So conversely, I think if I don't know if it should work like this, but I sort of think it does in a sense. If the price of Bitcoin and ETH and crypto starts to go up, there might be more demand for positive regulation or at least less public interest in just getting out the torches and pitchforks against the space, which is what's happening right now.
00:49:45.452 - 00:50:22.798, Speaker D: And the reason why is because what we're talking about is financial services. The financial services next to healthcare is the most regulated industry. Those are the most regulated industries in the United States. No one can put a dollar into some ecosystem. If you work at a registered investment advisor, investment bank, et cetera, et cetera, unless it's something that is cleared by compliance, there's no way compliance clears things. I understand the argument where you don't want regulation as an industry is growing. I think the caveat to that is you don't want regulation for your industry while the technology is maturing so long as you're not dealing with a regulated industry.
00:50:22.798 - 00:50:42.214, Speaker D: But because we are, I think we need some regulations for people who are banking institutions, investment banks to be able to transact in stablecoins. That would be just like a base case. So I think positive regulation, but I also think once again, ETF positive sentiment and then that leads to more positive.
00:50:42.262 - 00:51:25.720, Speaker C: Regulation just on the regulation stuff. So it looks like Jim Jordan is not going to be the House Speaker, nor will Steve Scalise and now it looks like they're thinking about elevating Patrick McHenry to be the temporary speaker until right, you know, awesome, super hardworking, super honest. Like he's definitely one of the more moderate and reasonable politicians that I've ever met and he's going to be the guy who's the temporary speaker of the House and he has the ability to bring certain things up. And there's a lot of stuff that needs to pass by January. Like we got to give Israel aid, we got to give Ukraine aid. There's border stuff, there's probably spending packages. I wouldn't be surprised if the stablecoin bill slips into something like that and that's just like a really good bill.
00:51:25.720 - 00:51:58.078, Speaker C: It is super reasonable for anything that has been invented before it comes to pass. They're going to give it a study period. There's a lot of things that are lining up in crypto's favor. The other thing I would say is 2024 is going to be a big transitional year. It feels like with the presidential election, with a lot of kind of the economic problems, a lot of things are going to come to a head at some point in the next year. So I think people have kind of been in this happens with presidents. You kind of get into this groove of like, yes, they're still president.
00:51:58.078 - 00:52:10.194, Speaker C: You're just kind of like moving along. But we're going to decide what the future of the country is for the next four years. And that's super exciting. But it also get people thinking about the future and what different shapes it can take. So I think it's positive.
00:52:10.322 - 00:52:52.414, Speaker B: I think that the stablecoin but stablecoins also feel like one of the least thorny areas of crypto to regulate. I feel like there are some very common sense things that you can do that would be super win win. There was a Nick Carter created this chart. So credit to Nick, but this was great. Basically the idea is that stables create net new demand for US treasuries because at this point that's basically all that at least USD circle. And USDC is backed by and I actually don't really know Tether, but I'm assuming Tether as well. And you can see stables are small, but they're the 16th largest sovereign holder of Treasuries, ahead of some pretty heavy.
00:52:52.462 - 00:52:54.990, Speaker D: Korea, Germany, Saudi Arabia.
00:52:55.150 - 00:52:57.640, Speaker B: I was pretty surprised to see Saudi Arabia on there.
00:53:00.810 - 00:53:27.600, Speaker C: This is such a wonderful narrative as we try to figure out who is going to buy all of our debt and we just have this thing. Don't worry, we invented the stablecoin and all retail globally wants to hold this stuff. That's so perfect. Why are you trying to ban this? You get the positive regulation, you get the ETF, you get Larry Fink saying crazy stuff on Fox News 2024. Let's see.
00:53:28.290 - 00:54:10.662, Speaker B: I'm very curious to see how the bitcoin corner reacts to this because in one sense, I feel like generally bitcoiners are very positive on stablecoins, probably because it's not another token that threatens. I mean, this is in theory, we're importing into crypto, sort of the mo for why bitcoin exists in the first place, which is US debt. That's not theoretically like. Just to be clear, I'm super positive about this. I think this is a very good thing. But you're also kind of importing from the bitcoin frame of like this theoretically safe asset that isn't that safe because X, Y and Z reasons.
00:54:10.726 - 00:54:24.190, Speaker C: But I just think I think you think of it as like lily pads. It's like the currency of your country probably is worse than the US dollar, which you can then get to and you can then get the US dollar to some high quality, more sustainable crypto.
00:54:28.850 - 00:54:45.574, Speaker D: Also also keep in mind I'm looking at USDC or some of the other publicly announced holdings reports. We're not talking about 30 year bonds that have gone down 48% in the last two years. We're talking about six month, three month T bills. Very different.
00:54:45.772 - 00:55:01.766, Speaker B: Yeah, I know this isn't a macro podcast, but the thing that's going on in the bond market right now is the worst sell off in US bonds in all of US history right now. So that's inclusive of the Civil War. I mean, it's nuts. Absolutely nuts. Drawdown.
00:55:01.958 - 00:55:02.982, Speaker A: Why is that, Mike?
00:55:03.046 - 00:55:50.250, Speaker B: Why is mean? I'm not like a bond math person, but there's an element of convexity which is basically like the lower that you draw down yields on bonds, when they move up, basically the difference in terms of the overall price of the bond is going to be very different. If you're moving from a 0% interest rate to 0.5% interest rate than from like five to six, even though it's a smaller amount, the face price of the bond falls more. And we had like record issuance of very long dated debt at super low yields, like basically 0% coupons and then we jacked interest rates up. And what's been happening is the long end of the curve is what's moving up right now. And that's where everyone's financed.
00:55:51.730 - 00:56:08.210, Speaker D: I saw a great tweet this week. If you would have bought the 30 year treasury bond on December 31, 2021, and you bought Bitcoin on the same day, guess what is worth more right now? Bitcoin.
00:56:08.790 - 00:57:14.966, Speaker C: Bitcoin never goes down. Remember when Palm used to tweet that when servers AWS to go down? Not helpful, but it is true. The people who are having the worst time are the people who are heavily rewarded for making two to percent, three per year, but heavily punished for losing any sort of money. And those are all the pond people. Can I make like a suggested listening for the pod? So Jeff Gunlack Michael sent me this presentation, did a wonderful grant so Grant's interest rate observer, kind of like the archaeologist of interest rates and financial markets and he gave like a 40th anniversary of interest rate presentation about the US and debt and the deficit and where interest rates are and where they might go. And it is just like the most thorough debunking of the idea that we can print all the money we want and it's refuted just by simple math that you can do on a napkin. But the basic point is like, stocks not a great idea.
00:57:14.966 - 00:57:36.620, Speaker C: Bonds, not a great idea. There are certain things like tips which will probably get outlawed in his opinion. There's very few investable things that have correlation to the basement of the money supply. And he hates Bitcoin unequivocally, but he kind of makes the argument for it without really understanding. So I thought that was cool.
00:57:37.090 - 00:58:06.434, Speaker B: I don't know how much I actually really believe this, but just. As a theory for cause. There are really smart people out there who say the deficit doesn't matter ultimately in the long term because the US can print money. And my theory there are really smart when really when, you know, no name people on Twitter say that it doesn't matter. I disregard that. But when very smart people, I just try to understand where they're coming from. And I think what it actually is is a rooted bias.
00:58:06.434 - 00:58:22.478, Speaker B: I try to imagine if I was 60 years old and I had a bunch of interests in this TradFi system that was propped up by this unsustainable thing, I wouldn't want them to pull the rug out now, but that's not my position.
00:58:22.564 - 00:58:31.290, Speaker C: This is like market forces. This is all this is. It's more supply than demand for various instruments that the government's trying to issue totally.
00:58:31.370 - 00:59:07.306, Speaker B: But at some .1 of two things needs to happen. Either you need to normalize it in one way or the other. You need to inflate everything to such that you need to basically run inflation hot and interest rates slightly under that so that you normalize GDP relative to debt. Or you just say, hey, this has gotten way out of whack, and you try to pull the rug and it has to be through inflation or deflation that you do a reset here. And if I was a 65 year old and I had a bunch of TradFi assets, I would not want them to do the second thing I'd want.
00:59:07.328 - 01:00:01.834, Speaker C: Them to do, like you say, reset. Those people are not dictating the future of what we're going to live through. I think your point is similar to mine, which is there's these various points at history, like World War II, you know, the invention of the printing press where you have to rethink how institutions are built and rebuild them in and of themselves. And Jeff Gunlack's classic example is he's a guy that wants to abolish the Fed and replace it with the two year treasury. It's kind of like a weird idea, and it doesn't give them any levers to increase or dramatically decrease the monetary supply. But that's the whole point. It's like, does it really make sense for them to set the price of money? Does it really make sense for them to buy or sell bonds or have a balance sheet to do whatever they want to do with versus something like, honestly, like an ETH or a bitcoin where it's like, you know the rules, the system's not like this is a different mean.
01:00:01.834 - 01:00:29.942, Speaker C: Stan Druckenmiller and him are saying basically the same. Like, at some point you have to add those perspectives up and it means something. And it's always a shitty idea to call for the end of the world. It's never profitable. It just takes much longer than you think to happen. But these are going to be the narratives that are in the backdrop, and there may not be a collapse in our lifetime. But people are going to be really worried about this, especially as things like the tenure just keep nuking and yields go higher.
01:00:29.942 - 01:00:30.966, Speaker C: That doesn't help.
01:00:31.068 - 01:01:15.314, Speaker B: I think the Bitcoiners would hate this idea, but I do think East's monetary policy, the flexibility is slightly better if there's going to be a money, because actually a totally static demand profile for money is not actually great. You kind of want it to be, I think, dynamic, but rules based. To be honest, I don't 100% have a grasp on east monetary policy, but I do think the government largely gets it right. It's like when there's a bad economic time, you want to stimulate a little bit. When there's a good economic time, you want to pull the reins back and create stability. But the problem is it should just be rules based and it should be an equation like the Taylor equation instead of succumbing to panic. Right.
01:01:15.314 - 01:01:17.046, Speaker B: And just like eight people, I think.
01:01:17.068 - 01:02:05.730, Speaker C: Of it as like lighter or heavier. Heavier assets over time will sink, lighter assets will rise. What are the functions of something being light? Having very little new supply issuance, having a strong holder base, having some sort of buyback that's more in, like TradFi, not having forced sellers that have fixed cost to generate your coin and your security. Those are the things that a good money has. And Charlie Noyes put out a Tweet, I think two weeks ago that was know there's a chance that ETH is terminally slightly positive in inflation and that's like the goal is not to delete all the supply. The goal is to make the most sustainable internet money that you can over decades and assume that the lightness of that asset will propel it past heavier assets. It's exactly what you're seeing with alts right now.
01:02:05.730 - 01:02:30.506, Speaker C: There's just so much supply. The examples only work in the extreme where it's like if you had all the supply in the world of an alt today, it would dump, it would be heavier. But if you think about it in the 1020 30 year increments, how much does proof of work actually cost versus proof of stake? Is it enough to tip the balances? It's one of many factors, but I do think your point is probably right. It's just like a much lighter monetary supply engine.
01:02:30.688 - 01:03:08.182, Speaker B: I thought you actually had the Tweet of the week, by the way, which was the idea of it's like, hell yes, I did. It was the point that you brought up about millennials and Zoomers not being able to afford a house and the link between that and basically YOLOing into meme coins and meme stocks and all that stuff. I do think that's the key point. Making all this stuff unaffordable means that you just need to like, all right, I'm not going to have all the stuff my parents had, so I'm just going to yolo into this thing that may go way up or may hit zero and pull the slot machine type thing.
01:03:08.316 - 01:03:23.214, Speaker A: I also thought vance had the tweet of the week, but I would actually point to one day you'll be so tired of winning. You'll say to me, vance, please, vance, can we just stop winning? Can we just take a break for a second? And then we'll all win some more?
01:03:23.412 - 01:03:24.494, Speaker B: That was a good tweet, too.
01:03:24.532 - 01:03:37.040, Speaker C: I think there's a good tweet to be jubilant. I think the setup is lovely, and yeah, we'll see. I'm just looking at my own tweet. It's beautiful.
01:03:40.610 - 01:03:42.202, Speaker A: That feels like a good place to wrap.
01:03:42.266 - 01:03:45.346, Speaker B: Yeah, we can wrap it up. All right, guys. Bye.
