00:00:00.090 - 00:00:30.466, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve.
00:00:30.466 - 00:00:34.902, Speaker A: You got Mike and Miles today. Just just two lads holding it down.
00:00:34.956 - 00:00:40.970, Speaker B: Two of us, just the two of us getting cozy on a nice Thursday afternoon fireside chat.
00:00:41.550 - 00:01:13.314, Speaker A: Little fireside chat. Yeah, just picture by fire, warm mug of cocoa. It is the first couple of weeks of Fall, which is my favorite season. We thought we'd mix it up here a little bit and actually not really discuss any of the news that's been gone on this week. It's been a relatively slow week. The only thing that's really happening on the news front is the FTX trial and saga. And I don't know, I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed with the constant deluge of little facts there.
00:01:13.314 - 00:01:56.818, Speaker A: And I think the CT coverage of it has been basically a historic low, even for crypto. Twitter. It's been bad. So we could just skip that. And instead, if you're also sick of that, just like we are, I think maybe we can zoom out and actually have a debate about just more of a debate sort of episode, where one of the topics that I think is the topic jour in Crypto right now, at least in Ethereum land, and I think in Cosmos land as well, is enshrinement enshrining things. And I think this has been under the radar, something that's being discussed more and more back at ECC in July. If you went vitalik actually spoke a couple of times about the trend of enshrining coming back.
00:01:56.818 - 00:02:58.494, Speaker A: He just recently wrote a blog post talking about should we be okay with enshrining more things within Ethereum? And we talked about this in a little bit in last week's roundup, too. So bear with me here if this is repetitive for you, but it was a very instructive post, kind of on the original philosophy of Ethereum, of not enshrining things, not putting things within the protocol, similar to the Unix philosophy, and instead pushing complexity out to the edges. You actually walk through the history of the many attempts to enshrine account abstraction, going all the way back to 2015 or 2016 to demonstrate how difficult it is actually to enshrine things in the protocol. Even if you can decide as a community that this makes sense and we can get into some of the pros and cons of enshrining and why it makes sense and why it doesn't make sense. But Miles, you actually have a great analogy, I think, for how to think about this. And I've increasingly started to think that when people talk about Enshrinement, it's sort of ships passing in the night and people are using these very different arguments. So you have this great framework.
00:02:58.494 - 00:03:03.462, Speaker A: I'll just tee it right up to you if you want to give the folks the two ways how you think about it.
00:03:03.596 - 00:04:03.830, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I think the big question I'm trying to poke at here is really around does credible neutrality, which is really what has been optimized for at this point, mean letting everything go to the private market? And I guess the way I've observed that, there's two very different ways of thinking about this topic and although they kind of get to the same place and one is, okay, you think about Ethereum or any blockchain should be basically treated like a government treats its country. And from that perspective you could argue if you're a proponent of Entriment, hey, it's not great to let everything go to the private market. There are certain services that lead to natural monopolies. And if you were to let the private market completely capture something like utilities, that would not be healthy for the underlying ecosystem.
00:04:03.910 - 00:04:04.250, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:04.320 - 00:04:51.830, Speaker B: And so maybe Ethereum should be selectively pick a few areas that it believes it should regulate or even nationalize at some point for the greater health of the ecosystem. And I think the pushback here has been like, well that sounds like communism to me. Or nationalizing businesses or what sort of precedent does that set? That's not healthy, right. For attracting future entrepreneurs. I think that pushback is totally valid as well. Then there's a very opposite end of the spectrum way of looking at this, which is to think about Ethereum more like operating systems. And I think we'll be seeing Apple and Microsoft.
00:04:51.830 - 00:05:08.558, Speaker B: I mean, these big operating systems did bundle many first party apps into their system, right? So these are like things like browser or the calendar or even iMessaging with this.
00:05:08.644 - 00:05:19.874, Speaker A: And when you say first party apps, there miles just to underscore. That would be like if Windows or Microsoft designed the operating system Windows, then they would also create Outlook, things like that. The basic exactly.
00:05:19.992 - 00:05:21.106, Speaker B: Microsoft office.
00:05:21.208 - 00:05:21.906, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:22.088 - 00:05:23.854, Speaker B: Or apple. Imessage.
00:05:23.902 - 00:05:24.114, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:24.152 - 00:06:35.402, Speaker B: And I think that this is to some degree to protect their users again, because relinquishing this control to the private market could lead to worse user experiences. But it also is effective in deterring competition. And of course Microsoft went through all that antitrust stuff because of it. So they definitely took it to the Nth degree of bundling. I think whether you're looking at an operating system or a government, I think that that is the big question is can we retain this value prop of credible neutrality that attracts entrepreneurs and reduces platform risk? It's not something they need to think about while also not letting everything go to the private market. Are there things that we can enshrine? That's the word we're using. But really it's kind of like building a first party app in my eyes that makes the rest of the ecosystem net better and still leaves plenty of ample room for third parties to come and innovate and drive value.
00:06:35.402 - 00:07:36.990, Speaker B: So you're not driving away entrepreneurs but you're also giving yourself a little bit of a competitive moat under the guise of also protecting users. And so from that perspective, I could think it's interesting we haven't seen more entriment, right? I think we're coming out a pretty extreme degree of credible neutrality optimization by not doing any of this right. But now people are starting to question it that as the private market winners have started to emerge and saying, okay, maybe this isn't so healthy for the rest of the underlying ecosystem, whether that is Lido today or eigen. Layer tomorrow. If there are things that are super close to the metal, should we be pulling more value back? First of all into the chain. More control into the chain. And if we do that, does that actually deter future entrepreneurs from coming and building third party apps? Which we absolutely that's our main value prop, right? We're selling block space for applications.
00:07:36.990 - 00:07:48.020, Speaker B: So that's kind of the way I'm thinking about it. It's two very different views and I think there's like valid pushback and support based off of which angle you're more coming from.
00:07:48.550 - 00:08:28.334, Speaker A: So I really like that way of thinking about it. But I actually would poke at you and maybe challenge the idea that those are very different. I think the uniting principle is good user experience. So good user experience from the perspective of a citizen in your first example of a country nationalizing, like a banking system or utilities or something like that. Or good user experience from the perspective of using an operating system. So from the perspective of Windows, one thing that everyone is going to do is try to use email. So it would make sense to look, maybe this isn't the thing that we take our rake on and make a bunch of money from.
00:08:28.334 - 00:08:57.994, Speaker A: It's more important to us that everyone has this basic service. It's very safe. You aren't getting viruses transmitted to you, it's not buggy and it just works because if that basic utility works, then it's going to lead to all of these other profitable activities down the road. Same thing with a country actually. And this is where there's a little bit of nuance between regulation and nationalization. So there's sort of like a couple of things that countries do which is provide free goods and services. They're not really free, you get taxed for them.
00:08:57.994 - 00:09:12.330, Speaker A: But really actual public goods like building roads, the post office, things like that. Then there's regulation, which is to say, look in your example of utilities.
00:09:14.450 - 00:09:14.766, Speaker C: The.
00:09:14.788 - 00:09:58.358, Speaker A: Natural market dynamic of a utility is that there's a natural monopoly there. So what we don't want is for people, whoever becomes the one supplier of power in a big urban area like New York to just be able to gouge everyone and charge them so much that they're maximizing their profit. But 10% of the city is without power or basic goods and services. We just don't think that's a good thing. We're going to improve the basic user experience of people who live in this area and just not allow them to do that. And that actually should be like a net good and pay dividends back for people who create businesses in those areas and all those other things. Nationalization would be an example of a government that wants more control over its financial system and takes the banks under their wing.
00:09:58.358 - 00:10:57.600, Speaker A: Or in an extreme example, if your financial system blows up and the government has to come in and save parts of the financial system like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So we've actually sort of done that to a degree in the that's probably that is sort of to your point how I was thinking about it before. I do think the middle ground here is some form of regulation. And I think even going back to season two of Bell Curve, did a great episode with Larry, did one with Hasu as well, which provided this framework that I think is pretty accurate, which is the governance should fit how close you are to the metal. So, like Ethereum governance, super, super decentralized, one level up is probably Lido. And that should be because it's so close to the Metal, it should be almost as flat and decentralized as Ethereum itself. Now, I guess the question that we're really getting at here, and the crux of it is what is so close to the Metal that it actually should just be directly controlled by Ethereum? And that is what I have less of a solid answer for.
00:10:58.130 - 00:11:28.870, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And that is a super important nuance. Like if you can create elegant regulation that doesn't need constant governance, that's very different than operating what would otherwise be a full application and being opinionated and saying this is the only version of this that you can use. And I would make this slight differentiation where you have regulation with utilities which restricts there from being like one electricity provider know the entire country uses.
00:11:28.950 - 00:11:29.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:29.808 - 00:11:33.350, Speaker B: And so you have a variety of them and they're regional and that's healthy.
00:11:33.430 - 00:11:34.060, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:34.910 - 00:12:23.050, Speaker B: But if you're using Microsoft and you're using Microsoft Office, that's literally like, you've got this one choice, this is what you're going to use. Obviously, it's more browser based ones now today, but that's essentially the line here. And yeah, with something like Lido, it's a question of sure, it can be as flat as absolutely possible, even without any sort of entriment and that's what they're going for. Right, but I think then the concerns are coming from, okay, that's still like one electricity provider that still is powering the entire country and they still have that ability to enforce pricing, price gauging and gouging and unhealthy things.
00:12:23.120 - 00:12:23.740, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:24.590 - 00:13:14.086, Speaker B: And so with the LSM, the liquid staking module that we talked about, it's first of all possible in Cosmos because Cosmos has governance, first of all, and it also has delegated proof of stake. And so I think that that's the next question is, okay, if you want to go for this middle ground or frankly, the nationalization ground or the first party, whatever perspective you're thinking about it from, what are the downstream implications of that for Ethereum? And if you do add something like any kind of formal governance or delegated proof of stake, what are the trade offs with that? Does that start to potentially pick away at this ultrasound money start of the value prop?
00:13:14.118 - 00:13:14.410, Speaker C: Right?
00:13:14.480 - 00:13:22.602, Speaker B: Like, the more complexity there is and control there is in the protocol, the less of a money meme Ethereum becomes.
00:13:22.666 - 00:13:23.280, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:23.730 - 00:14:08.006, Speaker B: And I think it's always been trying to strike that middle ground where it can compete with Bitcoin as a money, but also be this operating system. I think we're now getting to the point where that actually hits serious tension, where if you are going to try to compete with Bitcoin, then you're going to have to make trade offs like sacrifice, like relinquishing that control of the private market completely. Or you say, at the end of the day, I think this can still be money with there being some form of governance or control and yeah, no, I think it'll be interesting to see where it ends up playing out. I have a hard time seeing Ethereum implement token governance in any form, frankly.
00:14:08.198 - 00:14:09.100, Speaker A: Me too.
00:14:09.470 - 00:14:44.630, Speaker B: And so I think that anything that requires that is a bit out of the equation. I think that it seems like delegated proof of stake is becoming a little bit more of a viable option, or at least I've seen it thrown out there in a couple of the solutions that are being proposed here. And so, yeah, I think some of that is also worth keeping in mind here is like, if you do decide to tackle the Lido problem, what other problems might you introduce, right, that could potentially undermine the objectives?
00:14:45.290 - 00:15:39.206, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that fundamental tension is the one that I think about too, which is the trade off with Enshrinement is complexity. The more complexity you take on the cost of that is you need governance, you need a way to manage all that complexity. One of the things that I think has been strongest for Ethereum and Bitcoin as well, for its commodity money ness, however you want to describe it, is the fact that there isn't this. It's not like a company, it's not like there are shareholders that can vote, and it's just this thing that gets sort of decentralized, gets coordinated around, which looks very commodity like. I think the more that you bring within the protocol, the more complexity you ask it to absorb. Eventually, if it's doing enough people are going to start to be like, all right, who is making these? Like many decisions are being made now. I understand this.
00:15:39.206 - 00:16:45.760, Speaker A: Who is making these decisions and what is the process? And I do think there are guys like I've heard John Adler use the exact metaphor of regulation in the past. And one know it doesn't often get thought of like this, but you could think of the EIP process as a part of one component of regulation in a way they're framed as improvements, but they are things that the clients will have to implement and gets brought into the protocol. So I think it's worth considering and formalizing more thoughts about how regulation looks in a crypto and in an L1 sort of environment. But then it is worth looking at how governance is going to look and this trade off between the more human decision that's around it, the more it's subject to change yeah. The less it looks like a commodity. And to the bitcoiners credit, they saw this coming from light years out. These debates were had a long time ago in 2012, 2013, and they saw a lot of this complexity coming down the road and they said, I don't want to deal with that, we're not going to deal with that.
00:16:48.050 - 00:16:52.830, Speaker B: I'm a little biased. I would have preferred to have this problem rather than bitcoin's problem.
00:16:52.900 - 00:16:53.802, Speaker A: Oh yeah, me too.
00:16:53.876 - 00:17:47.678, Speaker B: At least there's things happening. But now you have to kind of accept the realities of those trade offs. And maybe just to give you some one idea of how regulation that isn't opinionated in terms of impacting the apps could look is you can like the liquid staking module. They could add the ability to basically natively mint some sort of delegation specific LST. So this is like an NFT, right? And from there you can then take that NFT and give it to one of these third party liquid staking providers who pool it. But the regulation is that you cannot mint unlimited LSTs with one validator unless they continually increase their minimum bond.
00:17:47.774 - 00:17:48.322, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:48.456 - 00:18:15.990, Speaker B: That mitigates the principal agent problem. So you're saying, okay, this reduces the risk that all of the stake gets delegated and minted with one validator that can then basically rug the protocol. But we're also not going to like so we have a healthy distribution of stake at the delegation level, but then we're going to let the private market handle how to pool those NFTs in a way that brings them back to fungibility.
00:18:16.070 - 00:18:16.650, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:16.800 - 00:18:25.950, Speaker B: Or with Eigen layer you could make the protocol aware of basically how much of the network stake has been restaked and cap that.
00:18:26.020 - 00:18:26.350, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:26.420 - 00:18:59.122, Speaker B: So then maybe only like if the network now knows that you're restaking to an Avs or something else, it can say, okay, out of the entire ethereum stake, x percent is restaked. We want to cap that at like 2020 5%. Now the Bloat that this would add to governance is that you'd have to be constantly reevaluating all these parameters and you would have to be basically doing a hard fork or a soft fork like an EIP for every single one of these updates.
00:18:59.186 - 00:18:59.414, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:59.452 - 00:20:13.470, Speaker B: So let's say like, oh, we got comfortable with the liquid staking cap at 20 or the minimum self bond at x parameter, right? Well, what if we want to bump that up a little bit, right? Regardless of what you do and whether you nationalize it or not, you are adding governance bloat. But is that worth it in order to make this the benefits of a healthier ecosystem so we could end this endless debate? What does that actually look like? And I think that that's maybe the one thing missing, I think from these lido debates is okay, can we all agree, first of all, that social shaming is not going to work here. And so if you really want to think about this in a practical way, it has to be something at the protocol level. I don't hear anybody really talking about those downstream implications of governance bloat or of delegated proof of stake. We've heard mainly just like social pressure and now we have a vampire attack. But anything at the in protocol level I think has yet to be really explored.
00:20:14.210 - 00:20:55.306, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is where we've talked a little bit about this and this person's been referenced on the show. I don't know who Gwart is, but what a joy. What a joy to get brought to very someone drew like this Ven diagram of people that are smart and people that are funny to try to identify who it was and it's clearly someone who's in the know but they've got a good sense of humor as well. But that is where this kind of meme around the unalignment police because just rubs you the wrong way. I've been on the show saying I genuinely think it's very well intended but I do think it is always going to rub people the wrong way. Kind of the dynamic of social shaming.
00:20:55.338 - 00:21:09.150, Speaker B: Is just or it just reflects a disconnect between, I guess whatever those values are and what they believe ethereum users will do and what's actually happening on the ground.
00:21:09.230 - 00:21:09.860, Speaker C: Right?
00:21:10.230 - 00:21:25.302, Speaker B: And so it's just kind of pointless to keep yelling into the void really from that side when you can see in the data what their social layer is.
00:21:25.356 - 00:21:25.574, Speaker C: Right?
00:21:25.612 - 00:21:28.614, Speaker B: And I think that was the Gort bomb last night.
00:21:28.652 - 00:21:58.942, Speaker A: That was great, I agree. But I also think maybe to take the other side of it just for a second, the other side of this would be that for many years there was really no reason to use Ethereum unless you really believed in this stuff. I do think ethereum is here today because of those people that believed in those values. So I can see if you're one of those people who just deeply deeply cares about it. And I do care about these things too. I would just be like, come on, guys, this is what we're built off here. The success protocol.
00:21:58.942 - 00:23:13.030, Speaker A: Irresponsible yeah, and one thing I've been thinking about a lot is people love probably because this whole space started with Bitcoin, which was explicitly out to be a form of money, and now there's this ultrasound money, meme and Ethereum. My personal thought is that it looks more like a commodity, like oil or something like that, than a more traditional money. But I do think that the question is in the ways of money is how do you get people to use this stuff and really believe that it's money? You don't have the luxury of a government, of just you have a monopoly on violence and you get to force people to use it and force people to pay their taxes in it. And it seems like the organic answer that crypto has landed on is to basically form a religion, like a commodity type money, which is enforced by religion. And I'm increasingly starting to see the L1s through that lens because there are people that have been in crypto for much longer time than me. But I've been in it for six years now and I went through the same process that many people do when they first get into this space. Oh, it's so tribal.
00:23:13.030 - 00:23:58.870, Speaker A: It's not going to be this tribal forever. It's going to get less and less tribal. And that's just not what I'm seeing. I think, if anything, every year that I'm in this space, it gets more tribal, it gets worse, I think sometimes. The other thing I hear people say sometimes is that's just on crypto Twitter, that's not really what it's like between builders and it's like kinda but kind of not actually. There are some debt, like, good friends of mine in the space who I know I just have to be a little bit like, yeah, I'm in this camp, or like, no, I'm really in this camp. Just as someone who I look at this space from a media standpoint a lot and yeah, I think you just have to acknowledge that there are these even just look at how separate of a camp bitcoin is in these days.
00:23:58.870 - 00:24:37.862, Speaker A: It did not used to be like that, even two or three years ago, and now it's like, might as well be a different industry, might as well be an entirely different industry. So I don't know, I've increasingly sort of started to look at these things. Like, I probably think the tribalism is here to stay, and I think that its evolutionary purpose, so to speak, is what Ethereum alignment is getting at, which the enforcement mechanism for using these forms of commodity money is a religious like devotion to an adhered set of values. So if I had to guess, I think that's actually more of the I don't know if that permanently, but it's more moving in that direction, it seems like.
00:24:37.916 - 00:24:38.520, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:38.970 - 00:24:59.938, Speaker B: I guess my perspective on this is more coming at the angle of, okay, what is the most scalable way to make Ethereum money? I think it's by making it the best possible operating system to build on. And in order to interact with this operating system, you need Ethereum.
00:25:00.054 - 00:25:00.720, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:03.810 - 00:25:13.966, Speaker B: I think that, to me is kind of how this actually scales long term rather than I think where we get in trouble is when you start to question how it's being used.
00:25:14.068 - 00:25:14.720, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:15.090 - 00:25:23.678, Speaker B: And that's what's starting to happen here. I mean, the end of the day, all activity is good for Ethereum's moneyness.
00:25:23.774 - 00:25:24.420, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:24.890 - 00:26:22.614, Speaker B: And I think the second you start to get super too opinionated about how it should be used and whatnot, then you start pushing people out right. That don't want you to have opinions on this operating system if credible neutrality is kind of like your value prop. Yeah. And Bitcoin is interesting because Bitcoin in some ways has cut itself off from the rest of crypto and it's taken tribalism way too far and taken its opinionation way too far. But then there's also a massive class of holders that are basically treating this like a macro. Like, I don't think Paul Tudor Jones gives a shit about the debates on Twitter and the block size wars and stuff like that, except in the context of, does this make this a better macro asset? That the reason I'm betting on.
00:26:22.652 - 00:26:22.950, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:23.020 - 00:26:40.010, Speaker B: And so in that sense, it is interesting how that played out. But ethereum, I think, is very different. And Ethereum's bet is based off of people actually using it for applications. And so they need to be even more careful about being opinionated around how people use this.
00:26:40.080 - 00:26:40.650, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:40.800 - 00:26:44.366, Speaker B: Because that will deter that activity yeah.
00:26:44.468 - 00:27:35.134, Speaker A: On a long enough time horizon. I think it's not surprising to me that the Paul Tudor Joneses of the world are more interested in things like Bitcoin than Ethereum. I'm just speculating he just talked publicly about because I feel like Paul Tudor Jones is the type of investor who is money on bonds, commodities, a much more traditional macro sort of guy. And Bitcoin just so neatly fits within that story. And that's what I think Bitcoin basically needs to succeed at this point. It's cut itself off from the rest of crypto and its success will be determined by big institutional buyers buying into this digital gold store of value type narrative. I think Ethereum has a totally different path and way of success and it probably does look more like the sort of reserve asset of crypto economies, I would say.
00:27:35.134 - 00:28:06.434, Speaker A: And I think that the sort of investor that it will appeal to. Look more VC ish in nature. Not exactly, but more VC ish in nature. This is a little bit of a weird spot because I do think of Ethereum as a commodity. I don't think Ethereum will appeal as much to traditional commodity type investors because it's so tech platform in nature. But at the same time, it's hard for me to really just see VCs just buying and holding ETH either they're equity investors. It's an interesting spot.
00:28:06.562 - 00:28:43.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you could treat it more like an index on all the applications built on top, right. And that's kind of, I think the mindset, but it's definitely more of an equity growth mindset, right, and I think that that's really where we're going and I could not agree more. That's why it has a very different class of stakeholders and investors and frankly, way more from the VC side because whether you're holding Ethereum or you're just working in the Ethereum space for the applications and trying to identify the big winners, that's a very different mindset to your point.
00:28:44.230 - 00:29:46.502, Speaker A: So one sort of related, but a little bit of an orthogonal point here. We have a buddy who's just making me think about this and he is without protecting the names of the innocent here, but he's thinking about launching a crypto game. It's a game that has crypto on the back end. It's a cool game too, built like a little bit of an MVP messed around with it and his idea was basically to just abstract away all of the crypto nature of it. So you as a user basically wouldn't even know that you're using crypto and I could be wrong, but I actually wouldn't do that. I would lean more into the I would look at your audience as people who have crypto and want to spend their ETH specifically. I'd be curious what you would think about this, especially with you in an investing seat, but I would kind of think of your target market as people that have ethereum and want to use it to do fun things.
00:29:46.502 - 00:30:46.780, Speaker A: That will promote ethereum and people can spend their ethan. This is not probably a permanent state of fit, but I think there is a very large market out there. Friendtech is a really good example of this, friendtech, clearly they did not take the approach of let's build a social app where crypto is totally abstracted and no one knows. I actually think that was probably right in the very long term, but I think that messes with you as a crypto entrepreneur, I think Friendtech had the right playbook here. They're like my market is people that own ETH and they want to do cool shit with their ETH and a cool thing that you can do is take some of your ETH and use it to bet on friends in this social app. And I think that I've pushed back a little bit on this whole ETH ultrasound money meme, but people do and I wonder of this because oftentimes you hear like oh, it's a better UX to use USDC and that's what is being talked about over in Cosmos and I'm kind. Of like I don't know about that.
00:30:46.780 - 00:31:24.070, Speaker A: I actually wonder if there should have been more of a leaning into Atom and promote because the flywheel that ends up kicking in that ethereum has just done so well on is cycle starts. People hold ETH. ETH goes up 20 x. Every one of those holders gets much more wealthy which A, makes you more predisposed to the ecosystem, kind of unites everyone's incentives, b, some of those profits that capital gets rolled into new businesses that in turn make ETH more valuable. Now there's reflective down cycle of that on the other side, but that is a powerful flywheel and I'd just be curious what you think about that whole.
00:31:24.140 - 00:32:26.698, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to point out Frontech too because I think if you were like there would have been many founders that look at that and say I'm building for the masses with this app. Obviously the masses use USD predominantly. Why the hell would we make them go buy this ethereum? But I think you kind of to your point, first of all, you're probably overestimating the amount of mainstream people that would be or over early adopters. Sorry. And you're underestimating the virality benefits that you get around even something as simple as using ETH as kind of like the main currency in there now. At the same time, you definitely don't want to bar yourself or add any sort of friction or UX to people that may not have ETH right away. Right, and so I do agree with all those points.
00:32:26.698 - 00:33:35.854, Speaker B: I think that if you can add additional optionality to some of these apps then that's great too. I mean, it's all just going to get swapped back to ETH anyways. But yeah, I think this kind of plays into this idea of alignment as a GTM hack, if that makes sense. And I think that we see that to varying degrees, whether it's a roll up framework that wants to be like the most ETH aligned roll up framework despite the additional costs, we're going to use it for DA and settlement, right. And we're going to get all the political figures to come out and support our framework as the one that's most aligned with our values and then we're going to have ETH be the gas token rather than using for example, Op or ARP as the gas token. And so, yeah, I think we will get to this challenge of, like it actually happens every cycle where you can risk by putting too big of an early focus on kind of like the bigger picture of the mass market. And not just if you want to be like I'm not just building for crypto natives.
00:33:35.902 - 00:33:36.500, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:37.190 - 00:34:11.580, Speaker B: Then you risk building for nobody. But at the same time, I don't necessarily support projects where the biggest version of it is really just a Dgen tool that is only appealing to crypto native folks today. And so yeah, I think it gets into some themes around using speculation as a tool, using ETH alignment as a tool and it will be very interesting to see just how successful these are.
00:34:13.970 - 00:35:33.800, Speaker A: I mostly agree, but I would say in the beginning, again, it all comes down to sequencing, right? I think eventually you need to be building with a product roadmap towards the future where you do not have frictions for people that don't already own ETH or Solanar or Atom or whatever. But I think you should be optimizing for those users in the beginning, you know what I mean? And one of the things that I've been thinking about because that actually is relevant to this guy's app, our friend, that he's developing, but it's relevant to friendtech too. One of the superpowers of or one of the very unique things about building for people that own a lot of ETH is that they aren't subject to the same restrictions in payments that a regular user would be. It's much easier, not necessarily on ETH, but on roll ups or once we solve or move past some of the gas fees, it's just way easier to do payments, like probably ten to 100 times easier to do payments for things in app, in game, micro payment, things like that. And frontex are really interesting. Like Frontex is actually a great example of an app. And by the way, I say this with like I'm not really sure I love the idea of being able to bet on your friends, but just what they've done.
00:35:33.800 - 00:35:55.520, Speaker A: I don't think you could do that if everyone is just hooked up to bank accounts. I just think the payments back on the loan of that would be almost a non starter. So I just think that probably is a superpower, something that's very differentiated that a crypto user has. Is this really lack of restrictions around payment?
00:35:56.050 - 00:36:55.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's fair when you don't necessarily have to go back into another fiat currency to close the loop right, or even to start the loop right. No, I think that's totally fair. That said, again, how many people are willing just to never close that loop and just continue accumulating ETH? I think that's the risk you take on. But it's a much easier problem to basically get that early adoption and then open up the possibilities, open up more options later than it is to ignore this early adopter market and find yourself in a situation with no PMF and having to figure things out later. Yeah, so I think it really does come down to sequencing and yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.
00:36:56.470 - 00:37:13.240, Speaker A: How big do you think that market is? Just out of curiosity and when I say that market, how many monthly active users do you think there are in something like Uniswap, which is probably the best proxy that you have for relatively active on chain people today?
00:37:13.690 - 00:37:30.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so if Frontech is at like 15,000 right? Now of uniswap. I would put it in the tens of thousands, but I'm not positive on that. It could be much, much lower. Monthly or daily? Monthly? I'm not sure.
00:37:30.996 - 00:37:31.594, Speaker A: Monthly?
00:37:31.722 - 00:37:39.600, Speaker B: Yeah. Unique users, repeat users. Frankly, it's probably under 100,000.
00:37:40.290 - 00:37:50.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking at wait, this is a little bit out of date, but yeah, around and I'm pretty sure I looked this up recently. I think it's even lower than Frenttech. I think it's like 10,000 or something like that.
00:37:50.264 - 00:37:52.034, Speaker B: Yeah, it doesn't shock me.
00:37:52.152 - 00:38:21.834, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's a small market size, but it seems like that is the a user isn't a user, isn't a user. It's kind of like the users that are still left using on chain products are very there's not a lot of them, but they're probably relatively high value, I would guess probably more than the average user in terms of fees that they're willing to generate, money that they're willing to spend. Highly engaged. Pretty valuable users, actually, if you can retain their loyalty, which is the trick.
00:38:21.962 - 00:38:22.542, Speaker C: Right?
00:38:22.676 - 00:39:31.090, Speaker B: In some ways they're extremely loyal because we're still using these crypto apps today after all the shit that we've gone through. But at the same time, within crypto, the switching costs are quite low. But I think that brand does play a huge component in that stickiness, even within the crypto native users. So yeah, I think that would be interesting. I also think that there's maybe opportunity at some point to have in platform stablecoins that are kind of like white labeled or maybe even just show up as USD, but I think that are owned by the Protocol or by the application so that they can retain the business model off of that and then send it back out, convert it over to USDC on the way back out. But yeah, I could totally see basically a lot of these apps having a toggle between do you want an ETH denominated app or a USDC denominated app or a USD call it and just abstract away whatever stablecoin that is. I think that's probably the next step here.
00:39:31.240 - 00:40:00.438, Speaker A: All right. I do not mean to dunk here at all, but first of all, I completely agree with that. I think what was the name we were talking about? Bridge. Bridge XYZ, which is a very interesting, very cool example of this. Give me 2 seconds. You might have seen it as well. Someone tweeted out this user experience of what it was like swapping into basically stables around Cosmos.
00:40:00.614 - 00:40:17.986, Speaker B: Oh, that was Larry. Yeah, it was trying to get into the neutron like wrapped Steeth. Hilarious. Yeah, it's a hop, skip, and a jump to get there. There's some wrapping, there's some bridging, there's some swapping. It could be improved, it could be.
00:40:18.008 - 00:40:21.650, Speaker A: Streamlined across the Atlantic Ocean.
00:40:21.990 - 00:40:22.740, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:40:25.430 - 00:40:40.860, Speaker A: Even as someone who uses these products, the amount of people that would be capable of using and fully understanding these products is extremely low. Even of the on chain people. It's probably like sub 2% or something.
00:40:41.550 - 00:40:57.390, Speaker B: It's something. And yeah, Cosmos has a bit of a distribution problem or aware. And I think that highlights it to varying degrees of how painful it is. But yeah, in general, I think that's fair.
00:40:57.540 - 00:41:44.382, Speaker A: Yeah, Cosmos, I'm a huge fan of that ecosystem. I know it feels a little disjointed right now, but I think they're going to get it together. One thing I would be curious to get your opinion on is while we're talking about ETH and ultrasound money and commodity like money, how do you view I know this is something that we've talked about off air before, but how do you view the idea of issuance and whether or not it's a cost to the network? And I'm going to put a little asterisk around that term cost to the network. But this is something that gets debated back and forth quite a bit. How should investors think about issuance? Is it different on the L1 level versus on the app level? How do you think about this idea of issuance putting on your investor cap?
00:41:44.516 - 00:42:02.386, Speaker B: Sure, I think of it as maybe this is a little bit of a traditional sort of mental model, but I think of just take like an L1, like Ethereum. It's like a marketplace for block space.
00:42:02.488 - 00:42:03.090, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:03.240 - 00:42:41.710, Speaker B: It has a demand side of applications that want to consume that block space. And in order for that block space to be valuable, it needs a supply side of operators that basically sign off on the blocks and also ensure that the more distributed it is essentially more secure the block space is. Right. So that's the product, first of all. And then from that, that's how I kind of back into my thinking here. Your supply side are service providers. They need to be paid in order to, I guess, maintain your value prop right.
00:42:41.710 - 00:43:07.726, Speaker B: Which is incredibly neutral, like block space. And so I view it as a cost. I know this gets into a lot of there's another view where you can be a staker, maybe that's like preferred stock. I think if you view this very simply, there's like three different PNLs. There's a supply side PNL, there's the network's PNL, and then there's applications PNLs.
00:43:07.778 - 00:43:08.380, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:09.150 - 00:43:35.058, Speaker B: And for the network, the revenue is basically what people are paying to consume the block space. And there's a cost, which is issuance. And then there's two pieces of what I consider today to be like, I don't know, rev share or basically supply side rev share, which is like the execution fees in mev, but the network can always pull those back in.
00:43:35.144 - 00:43:35.586, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:35.688 - 00:44:01.990, Speaker B: So thinking like mev burn, right. That is now improving the marketplace's economics because it has enough leverage over its supply side to say, hey, I know we were giving you that part of the revenue before, but we're going to take that back. And basically the PNL for the supply side, right? The supply side's revenue is the network's cost. That's issuance. Supply side's costs are their operating costs.
00:44:03.050 - 00:44:03.800, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:04.250 - 00:44:43.474, Speaker B: So that's how I say it. Maybe the app side, their revenue is fees paid by users to use the apps. Their costs is like what the pass through costs are to pay for the block. For every dollar that is spent on uniswap, half of that is basically going to Ethereum and half of it's going to the LPs. Like if you're just looking at what people are paying to interact with uniswap and that's a huge, huge rake. And so that's generally how I think about it. I think once you get into the application layer, there's some nuances.
00:44:43.474 - 00:45:05.690, Speaker B: But in general, I just see this as, okay, if you took away issuance as a cost, then would you be able to maintain your value prop? No, right. Your supply side would go away unless maybe you're earning so much revenue and you're fine passing through those costs and not having any other sort of revenue like mechanism.
00:45:05.770 - 00:45:06.400, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:07.810 - 00:45:14.430, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll stop there. I know I've heard both sides of this many times, but just I can't get past it.
00:45:14.500 - 00:45:16.480, Speaker A: I agree. I agree with you.
00:45:17.270 - 00:45:19.250, Speaker B: This is supposed to be a debate, Mike.
00:45:19.670 - 00:46:14.674, Speaker A: All right, here's all I'll put well, so the person who originally pushed back on me on this, and I didn't think he was right at the time, actually got a little frustrated. But then I sat back and thought I was like, damn it, he's right, is John Sharp. Now, what does it mean to be a cost to the when you I like the way that you frame things in terms of intersecting PNLs between different stakeholders that coordinate economic activity around the network. But the network is weirdly. Not a stakeholder in the same way that again, ETH is a commodity, let's say oil, right? When there's new oil wells discovered, is it a cost to oil? That doesn't even make sense as a framing. It's not a cost to oil, but it does have an impact. The additional supply of oil has an impact on the PNL for people who are pulling oil out of the ground, so to speak.
00:46:14.674 - 00:47:09.270, Speaker A: So it's a semantic note, but I think it is actually a very important semantic note in that, yeah, the network isn't really a stakeholder. It's really what you're talking about. And the simple bell curve thing here is like really what people are asking is, is the price going to go down if there are more issuance? Is the price going to go down? But it probably is an important distinction to say it is a cost to holders, not necessarily a cost to the network. Now, the big difference here being with something like oil, technically there is a group of people that can vote and change the issue. That's where the analogy breaks down a little bit. There's no oil foundation, there is OPEC, there is OPEC but there's no real ability to change the supply.
00:47:11.370 - 00:47:37.578, Speaker B: I think that's fair. I just see less differentiation between the network and the asset. I think the economics of the network directly impact the asset and if more and more people are using the demand, like from the demand side is going up the block space is getting more and more valuable that accrues value to the holders.
00:47:37.674 - 00:47:38.320, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:39.010 - 00:47:59.202, Speaker B: And in the opposite degree, if way more issuance is going out than revenue is coming in that should in a rational market decrease the price of ethereum not because of issuance right. But because it's being used less. The economics are like the actual PNL has gotten hurt.
00:47:59.266 - 00:47:59.542, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:59.596 - 00:48:11.702, Speaker B: And this is not me saying that also that you should have deflationary tokens or that you should have hard supply caps either. I think it's a balance.
00:48:11.766 - 00:48:12.090, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:12.160 - 00:48:50.130, Speaker B: And you should be striving basically not to be overpaying your supply side but you need to think about the downside trade offs of let's say we've been talking about minimum viable issuance. There's been a lot of talk about that recently and you need to be careful not to try to draw that line at the bare minimum issuance for the network to work because that has downstream implications about well, maybe that's keeping a couple of validators profitable but you're killing the entire long tail right. Which then hurts the value of the block space because it's totally centralized.
00:48:50.290 - 00:49:34.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm still undecided about this but I think even like you use the word revenue for the network and I feel like that's a confusing term. And even when people talk about something like block space profitability again, think about the oil analogy. Really what that's saying when the ethereum block space is profitable is that there is demand. It's an indication that there is more demand to use the block space than there is supply of the block space. It's kind of like in oil you would not say if there's more demand to buy and use the oil than there is supply of oil. It's slightly different. I get that it's slightly different just even by the flows of the value.
00:49:34.642 - 00:50:28.630, Speaker A: But it would be very confusing to say the revenue of oil that just gets reflected in the price of oil. In the same way, in theory, the more profitable the block space is, the more demand there is for block space relative to the supply. In theory, the accounting mechanism which is ether within that block space should go up in value. In practice. I think what makes it even more confusing is that the price of ether tends to lead blockspace. I think blockspace profitability or the demand characteristics of blockspace actually lag the price just based on this is how I think money flows into and how bull markets typically kick off which is that price leads everything. When the price goes up, people start asking why there is a positive narrative that gets attached to the price movement.
00:50:28.630 - 00:50:41.402, Speaker A: The positive narrative, in turn, feeds more interest in buyers. Price continues to go up. All that positive flywheel that we talked about before kicks in. VCs start getting involved again. And that's it.
00:50:41.456 - 00:51:11.662, Speaker B: I'll just say this. Did Ethereum, the asset, become more attractive after EIP 1559 was introduced? And I would say, yes, quite a lot. The revenue is the base fee today, right? That revenue, that base fee, it could have been gone to some Dow that does public goods funding. That was an option. It's burn just for simplicity sake.
00:51:11.726 - 00:51:12.194, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:12.312 - 00:51:31.558, Speaker B: And in the future, if Ethereum stakeholders want to do so, they can then include the mev portion of that. And that's what's being proposed with mev burn. Again, I would say that this is making the asset of Ethereum more attractive, assuming that demand continues to increase.
00:51:31.654 - 00:51:32.300, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:33.550 - 00:51:44.410, Speaker B: To me, it's a little bit less, I guess, oily, and more like we can make decisions that make our product better or worse if oil can't make its product better or worse.
00:51:44.490 - 00:52:29.578, Speaker A: Right, but see, that's such a great example of a decision around making it eliminating use. Right? Like, one thing that you could have done, this is what Cosmos does to some extent, is to say, hey, we're getting this revenue, we should invest it. Suddenly that looks very company like, right? Like then you bucket this as like a company like thing. But the Ethereum decision to burn not only the base fee, but now eventually, potentially the execution layer, mev type rewards, that just makes it look more like a commodity, because it isn't this equity returns type thing, I would say. Also, I have a chart. I should actually show it on this podcast. It was showed to me by Urian fidelity boy.
00:52:29.578 - 00:53:03.346, Speaker A: Fidelity man, I should say. And he showed me the 250 year returns of cash yield bearing cash, commodities, gold, equities. Equities smokes everything. And commodities do all right. Actually yield bearing cash does extremely well. And gold and precious metals has these sort of spikes like this. And I think if you look at ETH or Bitcoin as this ultrasound money commodity like thing, probably it's just funny.
00:53:03.346 - 00:53:39.620, Speaker A: Bitcoin has this hold it forever type thing. You don't really want to hold a commodity forever. That's more of a trade, right? Like you're making a trade based on this environment of debasement and people moving should be sort of a one time thing, but it should not be a forever hold. And that is how I kind of view these L1s is like the price ceiling on commodities is that you don't really want commodities to be expensive because they're used for stuff. Right? Eventually. Not that social markets can decide commodities, but for instance, when oil gets too expensive, like OPEC finally is like, all right, we'll release a little bit more of.
00:53:43.350 - 00:53:43.666, Speaker C: You.
00:53:43.688 - 00:53:51.878, Speaker A: If you're calling something a commodity like money, you're subjecting yourself to those dynamics because yeah, you don't actually want ETH to get too expensive because anyone gets priced out.
00:53:51.964 - 00:54:21.242, Speaker B: Yeah, I've just never really subscribed that hard to the commodity side. I think of it more like, okay, would Ethereum be more attractive as an asset today if it had so much demand that the fees that flow through to, say, execution in mev, what if it was significant enough that that could sustain their supply side with no issuance? I would say that that makes Ethereum a more attractive asset.
00:54:21.306 - 00:54:21.582, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:21.636 - 00:54:26.622, Speaker B: Now you have zero actual cost coming out of the asset.
00:54:26.686 - 00:54:27.300, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:28.790 - 00:55:21.246, Speaker B: And the price of Ethereum could go up a ton because of that. Right. I think where it gets a little complicated and not perfect is that you get a piece of that even more of that revenue if you decide to stake it just to get the pass through costs. But to me, I think that I don't think there's going to be any sort of we should release more Ethereum because the price is getting too high and it's killing user experience. I think that you can eventually get that through different scaling mechanisms. But maybe that is the upside cap in some degree, is that as it gets so expensive, you need to find even cheaper and cheaper and cheaper ways to get the same thing. And maybe now you're starting to use more Celestia instead for DA, because I think that is yeah, I think that's.
00:55:21.278 - 00:55:56.590, Speaker A: Exactly what that's what we're talking about, the two ways of scaling Ethereum. There's basically, in my opinion, two ways of scaling Ethereum. One is to move some of the computation that was happening on ETH off chain. So that could be in the form of L2s, that could be in the form of proofs and coprocessors or whatever. But you're taking some of the computation that was happening very expensively on ETH main chain and moving it somewhere else and posting a more minor part to Ethereum. And then there's the part of Ethereum which actually make redesign parts of the execution layer to make it more efficient. So that would be what Monad is doing, or the SVM would be a good example of that.
00:55:56.590 - 00:56:09.726, Speaker A: And I think both of those things, they're the same market forces acting on the same thing. This is a classic commodities thing, what you just described, seeking alternatives.
00:56:09.758 - 00:56:09.906, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:09.928 - 00:56:24.920, Speaker A: Like when one commodity gets too expensive, seek alternatives. So I think there's just this natural now that said, I think this is a good time period to own these things. Like, this is the trade portion of the layer one asset, I would say.
00:56:25.370 - 00:56:46.702, Speaker B: Yeah, right. I think it does get interesting if you consider your main value prop being like an app for platforms, a platform for apps. And now the success of your base layer token is degrading that UX. There could be like little periods of which we had before EIP one five nine, where it was almost unusable, right?
00:56:46.756 - 00:56:47.166, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:47.268 - 00:57:14.070, Speaker B: To interact on ethereum. And now, okay, we've come back down because we've had ways to maintain good user experience but still get the benefits of Ethereum. So we'll have revenue go down for a bit until, again, the amount of activity on that l two level gets the point where it's making Ethereum's price go up a lot again and maybe we'll see if people start using alternatives.
00:57:15.130 - 00:57:15.446, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:15.468 - 00:57:21.610, Speaker B: So I think if you're playing the long game, which is to maximize the amount of activity happening on Ethereum.
00:57:25.230 - 00:57:25.498, Speaker C: I.
00:57:25.504 - 00:57:40.650, Speaker B: Think it's a lot of interesting questions there that would maybe point to not making decisions in the interest of this being a money or a commodity. Or maybe it is more like a commodity because you do want to keep it cheap.
00:57:40.810 - 00:57:41.518, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:41.684 - 00:57:42.350, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:57:42.500 - 00:58:28.062, Speaker A: This is something that gets talked about more in the Bitcoin space. But if you go back in the history of money, there are more debt based commodities, more commodity based monies. This is where I really do think I would personally be in the camp of I don't view something like Bitcoin or Ethereum as a company with a it does have a product, but it's in the same way that a raw material is a product. I do view it as something unique that is more analogous to a sort of digital commodity as opposed to the product of a centralized company. And I think, yeah, that's how I view at least it's really Ether bitcoin. I think Solana, Adam, soladom are on the verge of that as well. Maybe last thing, just because this looked like it was going to be pretty cool for a second.
00:58:28.062 - 00:58:45.166, Speaker A: Now it looks like, I guess you were telling me it might not happen, but the Stride acquisition by the Hub, well, you're closer to it than me. You want to just describe we talked about a little bit last show, but you want to just describe what that was, why it was potentially interesting, and then we can get to some of the dynamics of it.
00:58:45.208 - 00:59:24.174, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So for those who don't know, stride is the leading liquid staking provider in the Cosmos ecosystem. And I think roughly 70% of its TVL is in staked. Atom. St atom today. And they've basically made a couple strategic decisions that has already increased, I would say, its alignment with Adam and also the security of the protocol. So Stride first became a consumer chain of Atom.
00:59:24.174 - 01:00:44.954, Speaker B: So they're an ICS chain, which means the Atom validator set is operating Stride. But they've retained basically the majority of their economics and their governance rights. So before this proposal, it was getting the security of Atom, but it did not have full alignment to some degree and it only got the security of the operating security. It hadn't mitigated the governance risk piece. And I think that if you're in this position in Cosmos and you look and see what's happening over in lido and Ethereum, you can tell that at a certain point of growth there becomes social scaling issues if you don't basically decentralize the liquid staking protocol as much as possible. Right? That's what we're talking about at the beginning of the show. And so Stride's kind of proposal was based on the fact that, okay, if we merge with the Hub, which is the single most decentralized proof of stake, I would say network that also has token governance, then we can basically avoid running into these issues when we get really big.
01:00:44.954 - 01:00:57.386, Speaker B: Right. First of all, this would make all of the atom holders comfortable with Stride having 70 or 80% of staked atom as liquid staking tokens.
01:00:57.418 - 01:00:57.614, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:57.652 - 01:01:16.014, Speaker B: If they owned and controlled Stride, this could even make other networks that are like Celestia or dYdX more comfortable because, okay, what was pointed to as a governance risk is now a much larger set of stakeholders.
01:01:16.062 - 01:01:16.226, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:16.248 - 01:01:58.562, Speaker B: It's much harder to attack or do like malicious things through the Hubs governance given its market cap, than it is through the Stride governance today. And so the rationale going in was, okay, we can make very simply the biggest, best version of Stride if it is one in the same with the Cosmos Hub. And from the Hub's perspective, we think this would be attractive because the Hub has kind of been soul searching for, I would say, a source of value accrual. The Hub, unlike Ethereum, doesn't have a product like block space that everybody is using.
01:01:58.696 - 01:01:59.186, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:59.288 - 01:02:26.518, Speaker B: The hub is not like the l one of Cosmos. Its original purpose, which was to be an IBC routing Hub, has not accrued very much value at all. And any revenue that they get from being a security provider is kind of contingent upon its market cap staying high. And its market cap is not going to stay high forever if it continues to not really have any sources of revenue.
01:02:26.614 - 01:02:26.922, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:26.976 - 01:03:32.382, Speaker B: So that was the rationale going in, is that, okay, great. The Hub now has a revenue driver and a real business associated with it. And Stride can basically avoid these social scaling issues that come once you get to be a certain size. So that increases the ceiling of Stride's market cap and it now gives the Hub something to basically really focus on and kind of that starts to build out the vision of how it accrues value in the long term. Of course, then you get to the process of actually doing this through decentralized governance, which is typically very difficult. I think there are people on the Stride side that were concerned mainly had two big pushbacks. I would say there's one pushback that was like, okay, I think Stride has a lot more upside than Adam and that kind of ignores the fact that there'd be even more upside if they would merge or maybe they disagree with that.
01:03:32.436 - 01:03:32.702, Speaker C: Right.
01:03:32.756 - 01:04:42.438, Speaker B: And then there's, I think, a really valid concern to some. Degree is, well, do we actually have a worse shot at getting big new networks like a Celestia? Because we're like this hub aligned protocol rather than being a neutral third party with the hub security, like, isn't ICS enough? And then, so those were the two pushbacks on the stride side, and then the pushback from the atom side was I don't want to mint any atom. There's only $30 million of atom left in the community pool, and stride's market cap before it dipped was around 75 million. And I think it's around like 50 million now. And so I think of course it is. Yeah, it went from around seventy five cents to around $0.50, which is very interesting.
01:04:42.438 - 01:05:37.802, Speaker B: There's a lot of overlap between the two holders. Who knows really what's going on? It's always hard to tell what is just kind of your crypto twitter noise versus what are the most important stakeholders think about all this. And there's a lot of uninformed takes around this is stride, like, trying to get an exit opportunity. And that makes no sense to me because first of all, it would have been impossible, and second of all, they're not looking to exit at whatever it is their current market cap. Right. This would only be done if everybody can agree that this is going to basically the sum of these two parts is larger than what they would have been had they stayed independent. Yeah, it's been interesting.
01:05:37.802 - 01:06:28.978, Speaker B: I mean, it's definitely different than the ethereum enshrinement debate, but there's some definitely similarities. So it's not quite the same as Ethereum saying, yeah, we're going to acquire lido, but it's not impossible. Lido could propose tomorrow that they would never do this. But hey, I think the biggest version of Lido is one that is actually owned by ethereum, right. And we create this subdow within outside of ethereum social consensus. And now you guys don't have to worry about the self limiting debate anymore because you guys can control things. And that's going to guarantee that we'll get 80 90% market share and it will make you guys more comfortable.
01:06:28.978 - 01:06:35.142, Speaker B: That was kind of like the rationale here, if you had to draw an analogy. That's definitely imperfect.
01:06:35.286 - 01:07:19.790, Speaker A: I agree. So there's sort of just like any m a transaction, there is sort of a strategic rationale for both standpoints, from both the perspective of the Stride community and the Adam community, and then there's the economic perspective from the stride, the Adam community. So I think from the stride perspective is kind of like just to quickly sum up, let's just avoid all that stuff in lido land. We see how that's all playing out. We understand that in order to hit them, we're in a market where there's a natural monopoly. In order to get to the 80 or 90%, we're going to have to solve the social scaling dilemma. And this is a pretty good way of sidestepping that and presumably capturing 80% to 90% market share will make us be very good in terms of the appreciation of our token.
01:07:19.890 - 01:07:24.986, Speaker B: Right. Simply said, decentralization is a growth strategy. That is the rationale, which is what.
01:07:25.008 - 01:07:26.822, Speaker A: Makes LST so unique.
01:07:26.966 - 01:07:57.782, Speaker B: Yes, super unique. Yeah, I totally agree. I think the difference is they have more supported networks than any other LST out there. I think they support like eight or nine different chains right now. And that's just the nature of Cosmos. And so it's a little bit different in that you don't know if that same I guess decentralization as a growth hack applies outside of atom, which you'd be merging to.
01:07:57.916 - 01:08:32.334, Speaker A: Right. And then I guess from the atom perspective, it's like, yeah, this is a revenue stream. But I think even more than the revenue, the incremental revenue and the control that it would bring in, I think the soul searching of what is the roadmap for the Hub and how it's going to value this is a critical building block. Mean, my sort of read on this mean, just in terms of M A, I've always been a little bit bearish in terms this question crops up every couple of years. When is crypto M A someone makes a prediction. Crypto M A is going to happen. It's going to happen this year.
01:08:32.334 - 01:09:00.700, Speaker A: I've never been particularly excited about it because the valuations are really wonky. And there aren't really that many businesses with real moats in this space. Maybe that's partly because maybe that's partly because of the open source nature. But when you really, I think, start to look at most businesses, maybe there are like two or three people that I could maybe just hire away here instead of paying 100 million. And that's the other thing. The valuations from founders are just completely unrealistic and untethered for the most part.
01:09:01.870 - 01:09:44.102, Speaker B: But I would say on the moat piece, I would say I would push back a little bit. All right, there's two moats that I think so I did hear people say, why don't we just fork stride from the Hub side? Why the hell would we be minting all this atom and it's all open source, we can just fork this thing. And I would argue that would not go well because I think there is a moat around, first of all, talent, human talent. There's a team that is really good at building products and has been laser focused on execution and actually direct to retail products. There's nobody on the Hub side that has any remotely close to that.
01:09:44.156 - 01:09:44.662, Speaker C: Right?
01:09:44.796 - 01:10:33.654, Speaker B: And then there is another, I would say, moat somewhat around brand, and there's a lot of layers to brand, but I think that to me, is where I would maybe make the distinction. And then on the deal structuring side, it's interesting because you would be like, okay, let's go to TradFi. Let's pull in best practices. We should apply a control premium. We should be looking at this and this and it's like, well, yeah. At the same time, you don't want to pull in too many of those approaches, because then you would have to justify why the market cap is the way it is today, when the PNL suggests that that's like 100 X earnings or something. That would just never happen.
01:10:33.692 - 01:10:33.942, Speaker C: Right.
01:10:33.996 - 01:10:45.930, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think it's still super messy when the base valuations are not grounded in the way that TradFi would value it.
01:10:46.000 - 01:10:46.714, Speaker C: Right.
01:10:46.912 - 01:10:56.990, Speaker B: Then you're trying to slap on all these traditional best practices, and you can get yourself in hot water if you're trying to justify a premium that way.
01:10:57.140 - 01:11:44.010, Speaker A: Well, I think so. Obviously, TradFi, and especially the bigger the deal is, the more laser focused they are in multiples. But I've always been a fan of the framework of build versus buy when it comes to valuing businesses is outside of just how difficult would it be to build this on my own versus what you've already built. And when you decide to buy, there's the multiple price that you're paying, but there's also the execution risk that maybe I just try to build what you guys build and I just can't just literally can't do it. Or maybe there's a time to market element of, okay, maybe I could build this and maybe I could even do it cheaper, but it would take me two years. And where would I be relative to the position of the market on a two year time frame? And I think that's probably more applicable of a framework to be looking at it from this standpoint.
01:11:44.170 - 01:11:50.330, Speaker B: Couldn't agree more. And looking at it from an ROI standpoint across all of those different paths.
01:11:50.490 - 01:11:51.246, Speaker A: Right.
01:11:51.428 - 01:11:53.894, Speaker B: And the third option there is partner.
01:11:53.962 - 01:11:54.194, Speaker C: Right.
01:11:54.232 - 01:11:57.902, Speaker B: And I would argue that's where they are today, they've already partnered.
01:11:57.966 - 01:11:58.242, Speaker C: Right.
01:11:58.296 - 01:12:29.654, Speaker B: They're already sharing economics. I think 15% of Stride's revenue goes to the hub, and in return, Stride gets the operator set, which makes them more secure. And I think what was proposed is, hey, this is going really well. I think we could both benefit by doubling down and going from partnership to merger or acquisition. And the market disagreed. The market disagreed. Or at least crypto Twitter voices disagreed.
01:12:29.654 - 01:12:44.302, Speaker B: And it sounds like it was allowed enough basically to pull it back. But yeah, I also do have the perpetual M and A is coming to crypto type of deal, because we do see areas that make sense for consolidation.
01:12:44.366 - 01:12:44.980, Speaker C: Right.
01:12:45.430 - 01:12:54.100, Speaker B: And you can lay out a rational case, but then when the rubber hits the road, it's like, oh, no, still not there. Not even close.
01:12:57.350 - 01:13:51.362, Speaker A: I feel like I'm coming off as if I'm criticizing a little bit the cosmos, and that's not what I mean to do here at all. But I think one thing that at least I am lacking and maybe it's because I'm not as in the weeds, but I feel like I think if you had a clearer vision of the strategic vision for the Hub and where something like Stride fit in, it would be easier to get the community behind something like this, if that makes sense. For ethereum, it's like, okay, the order of operations is vitalik, writes something everyone scurries about to essentially do said thing, but it kind of works. Right. Okay, roll up centric roadmap roll ups end up getting built. Now, what's next on the roadmap? We need to make DA cheaper for roadmaps or for roll ups. So we got proto dank sharding eventually full dank sharding.
01:13:51.362 - 01:14:30.706, Speaker A: Then we know that we got to get proposal builder separation. It's like there are these things that I know and so when you have the full strategic vision and where you're going, it makes it easier to say, okay, this is a huge priority. If I get this thing in, then it's going to help me get to this thing in the future. Whereas I think that's what's sort of missing here a little bit. It's like, okay, this is a great source of revenue, but I don't see where's the full picture are. We going to go acquire more things and when you don't have that, suddenly it just becomes, well, how much does it cost and how much am I immediately going to get out of it? Instead of, wow, I'm so bought into this future thing. I'm so pumped about it, I cannot wait to get there.
01:14:30.706 - 01:14:37.458, Speaker A: Oh, if we got this little piece here, it would get us closer to that vision. Okay, let's just get it. The cost is a cost.
01:14:37.544 - 01:14:38.053, Speaker C: You know what I mean?
01:14:38.053 - 01:14:40.166, Speaker A: It's just a very different exactly.
01:14:40.348 - 01:15:13.230, Speaker B: If you have a roadmap, you can make a decision based off of, is this going to accelerate the roadmap and are the benefits of that worth the cost? It's so much more simple and yeah, I couldn't agree more. I think there's a lot of challenges. I would say the main ones are around. First of all, there's the cosmos stack roadmap and their core objectives. And there's the cosmos hubs roadmap and vision.
01:15:13.310 - 01:15:13.698, Speaker C: Right.
01:15:13.784 - 01:15:52.774, Speaker B: And there is a challenge here where the people who are in charge of building, I would say right. Have to kind of choose which one to optimize know, so, okay, we're going to go bring value back to Adam because we've been focused on the cosmos stack for a while and Adam suffered. Okay, great. Within Adam, there's very little there's no consensus around what that vision is. We had Adam 2.0, right. That was like the at least shout out to Samhart.
01:15:52.902 - 01:15:53.338, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:53.424 - 01:16:42.320, Speaker B: One attempt at it, it was shot down, and now it's kind of know. Again, people are trying to pick up the pieces and anytime something is put out there, it know, a ton of pushback from people know. It's almost like people are afraid to get out of this sort of meme stage with Adam where it's still valuable, but the second you try to actually do something, it becomes clear that, okay, maybe we should put a value on what you're trying to do and maybe that comes down. That's challenging. But I could not agree more if there was at least not super prescriptive, but somewhat of an aligned vision for the Hub and this decision would be a lot easier and more clear for both sides. Right.
01:16:43.170 - 01:17:09.266, Speaker A: So this observation I was listening to essentially this discussion you and I are having with our analysts on zero x research and effort capital, as you know, is big in the Cosmos ecosystem. And he made this observation about, yeah, it's kind of funny that these communities don't feel aligned. It's like, oh, strideholders atom holders. It's the same people. It's the same people. The Venn diagram of Cosmos is basically a circle. It's almost one to one.
01:17:09.266 - 01:17:41.002, Speaker A: So it's just kind of funny that you'd say they aren't aligned. And you and I have talked about this a little while ago. We watched. I do think this is the benefit of ethereum. In the beginning, everyone just got behind this ETH and they rallied behind it. It was a shelling point, but it was also a source of shared wealth in the same way equity in a company unites everyone. And I remember when we saw the roll ups leaning in and each roll up had their token, it was eventually, you know, it's not all one thing know they're going to be distinct communities.
01:17:41.002 - 01:18:01.400, Speaker A: And I think you are starting to see those cracks form in Ethereum today. But Cosmos started out with that. So there was atom, but the atom never accrued any value because it didn't accrue any other value. And because there were all these other tokens, there was never one thing for people to rally around and it has led to more disjointed action. I think.
01:18:03.610 - 01:18:06.322, Speaker B: That'S part of the vision.
01:18:06.386 - 01:18:06.998, Speaker C: Right.
01:18:07.164 - 01:19:24.660, Speaker B: I think there could have been one version of Cosmos where the vision was to optimize for Cosmos stack adoption and basically treat the Hub as a public good of some kind and treat atom as a public good. But that's very challenging because you did raise this ICO. You do have to return capital to the atom holders at some point. But I think more so than any ecosystem, the tension of value accrual to that original token is most at ODS with the vision of Cosmos, of the applications broadly, because the more value that goes back to the atom hub is presumably being taken away from the app chains themselves. And the whole reason you're building a Cosmos in the first place is because you want your own app chain. So, yeah, I think it's more difficult to rally the troops per se in Cosmos than any other ecosystem because they're building there in the first place because they wanted more sovereignty than Ethereum. They didn't like being subject to kind of like the roadmap laid out by vitalik maybe.
01:19:24.660 - 01:19:27.502, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of in their nature.
01:19:27.566 - 01:19:48.658, Speaker A: Right, I get it. And I think that will be beneficial down the road, I think. Again, we've talked about this a lot, but I do think the sequencing generally is going to be launch. Probably actually skip main chain these days. Probably just launch an app on a roll up, maybe. Then you decide you want to be your own op stack chain. Then you probably migrate to Cosmos.
01:19:48.658 - 01:20:38.966, Speaker A: But I do think in the meantime, I don't know if there's some yeah, I mean, this is kind of the trade off, right? Like the full sovereignty, but you lack the unity. And maybe there's an analogy to be made here to the United States itself with the original Articles of Confederation. And it's like, yeah, everyone wanted no central government and there's like, well, we need know, we need maybe something a little stronger than this. And maybe one fix here would be just I don't know if you could even do this at this point. I think the community would probably hate it. Cosmos people, maybe you just absolutely hate this suggestion, but why not make the default gas on every Cosmos chain, Atom, just to start, right? I feel like that's not even a huge UX sacrifice because I think people want to use Atom anyway. I really think they do.
01:20:38.966 - 01:21:25.270, Speaker A: And I don't actually think people want to use like I would just challenge people who say that, and I used to be on that train, but I'm not sure it's so obvious. Like, think about the user flow for most people into this space, right? You start on a centralized exchange, like Coinbase. Then you buy like a little bit of Bitcoin, maybe some ETH, okay? Then you take your ETH on chain, then you start doing things with it. You don't go onto an exchange, swap your USD for USDC, take that USDC on chain, and then start doing things with your USDC. You start with the thing that you bought on the centralized exchange. And so I don't actually think it's a bad user experience to require the native token for gas.
01:21:26.890 - 01:21:50.714, Speaker B: I don't think you need to require the native token for gas. I don't think it needs to be I guess so there's one question, like, can Cosmos succeed without Adam succeeding? It's an interesting question. I think it's still TBD, but I would point to one thing. The biggest win Cosmos has had is dYdX adopting its stack.
01:21:50.842 - 01:21:51.520, Speaker C: Right?
01:21:52.130 - 01:22:12.710, Speaker B: Everybody was cheerleading when that happened. And frankly, Cosmos mindshare went up a lot after that happened. That's when this whole app chain thesis really started kicking into gear. Do you think dYdX has any interest in making like, well, this isn't going to work unless we have Adam as our gas token.
01:22:13.770 - 01:22:14.534, Speaker A: I get it.
01:22:14.572 - 01:22:54.254, Speaker B: No, right? And so for the Cosmos stack to win, that in some ways means value doesn't. You can't force value accrual to Adam. That said, I think everybody does realize, like, damn, it would be really nice to be rallied around one token right now. And we can see that that's a big part of Ethereum's success. But I think you're making trade offs that end up undermining the reason that people want to build on Cosmos in the first place. That's the risk.
01:22:54.302 - 01:23:43.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I hear you on that. I'm not really pushing back at all. I don't know, it's an interesting question. The immediate answer that came to my mind, not having really thought about it, is yes, Adam could survive, or Cosmos could survive rather. But maybe it doesn't look like Sam Hart will say cosmos is a design philosophy and that for the design philosophy, like, you know, tendermint as in consensus, to survive. No, you don't need Adam to succeed, but to succeed in the way that I think most people implicitly mean for it to succeed as an ecosystem, I do think you need Adam.
01:23:44.470 - 01:24:17.598, Speaker B: Let's think about it this way. Does Op need to accrue tons of value for the Op stack to be successful? I think again, the only way to do that is through something like the law of chains. Right, but how do you justify the law of chains? You have to make law of Chains Op stack roll ups first class, right? There has to be end user benefits that outweigh, that cost.
01:24:17.684 - 01:24:18.320, Speaker C: Right?
01:24:19.330 - 01:24:55.530, Speaker B: And they're doing that, they have their own roadmap. And that kind of reminds me a lot of really where the AEZ was trying to go. But the difference is the AEZ doesn't have differentiating features that mitigate pain points that are as extreme as we see on isolated roll ups today. But I think we will see some interesting dynamics there, right? Where if you want to use this stack, do you need to pay a tax or can you bet on yourself?
01:24:55.680 - 01:24:56.042, Speaker C: Right?
01:24:56.096 - 01:25:47.466, Speaker B: You can bet on your own nap as the shilling point. And so it will be interesting. But I just can see similar themes starting to play out with these roll up frameworks too, where they're stuck in between optimizing for Op Value Accrual and then Op stack adoption. There's always going to be a tension there in the same way that optimizing for AEZ and Atom Value Accrual is a little bit at ODS with Cosmos stack adoption. Because to my point, earlier, if you had to use Atom as the gas token, I think Doidx would have said like, fuck A, I'm not sure.
01:25:47.568 - 01:26:16.126, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know that to be the A business. I think Antonio is a really pragmatic founder, is my read on him. And again, the way I would think about it is I want to do what my users want to do. And the choice that ETH has made is, I think, the business decision for someone building on ETH. I mean, it's mandated on ETH.
01:26:16.158 - 01:26:16.354, Speaker C: Right?
01:26:16.392 - 01:27:03.410, Speaker A: But even like the friendtech example, right? Like you view your target market as people that want to spend their ETH. And that's actually a user experience. Sort of like it's a way to carve out or target a very engaged user base as opposed to an additional friction, which is how I feel like this is traditionally viewed. If you make someone use your token as gas, it's a friction, whereas you could look at it as, hey, here's this huge base of people who are weirdly religious about this thing and want to see it used. And all these people just love to tweet, like, oh, I'm using my ETH for this silly little there is. I think you can make a pretty compelling business case. Like, I've heard Antonio say this before, that you should think less about these ecosystems as distribution.
01:27:03.410 - 01:27:07.794, Speaker A: But I don't know about that. I think he's right about that.
01:27:07.832 - 01:27:18.898, Speaker B: Well, okay, maybe this is a little bit unique because users that he's trying to bring with him did not pay for gas, period, in Dydxv three, right? It's gasless trading.
01:27:18.994 - 01:27:19.494, Speaker C: Right.
01:27:19.612 - 01:28:10.200, Speaker B: And in Dydxv four, they're not going to be paying in dYdX for gas fees, for trading. It's still gasless trading. So I would just say that and all the collateral is based in USDC. Again, I think Cosmos draws that type of developer that cares about all those things and doesn't maybe necessarily value. And I also would maybe say, yes, I agree with that. Adam's in a bit of a tougher place to really enforce that. Or I just think the Friend Tech ETH example is a little bit stronger, like a point, because people own very I wouldn't even say the majority of crypto does not own Adam, but I do see your points.
01:28:10.200 - 01:28:20.070, Speaker B: I think they're stronger on ETH and they're stronger the more of further along you are in growing those network effects of the base asset.
01:28:20.230 - 01:28:45.170, Speaker A: Yeah, it's always a mix of both. You have to do both. It's product and it's distribution. You can't totally pick one or totally pick the other. You got to do a little bit of both. But look at this did end up being a little bit of a debate. And by the way, I really do love Cosmos, and the reason I enjoy having these sorts of discussions is like, yeah, I have just a vested interest in seeing all these ecosystems succeed.
01:28:45.170 - 01:28:56.982, Speaker A: Well, we did see, I guess, just the one little newsy thing that's kind of interesting. We did see Paul Tierra Jones say he likes the gold and the bitcoin this week.
01:28:57.036 - 01:28:58.198, Speaker B: He likes it again.
01:28:58.364 - 01:29:05.590, Speaker A: He likes it again. Baby. Let's go back. All right, so back. So back. No. It is October.
01:29:05.590 - 01:29:14.922, Speaker A: It is not October. It is October. All right, buddy. This was a really fun one. We should make these debates. This should be a nice little nice little feature.
01:29:14.986 - 01:29:21.662, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. Every once in a while, once these narratives get a little spicy, we'll get on here, hash it out.
01:29:21.796 - 01:29:22.334, Speaker C: I like it.
01:29:22.372 - 01:29:22.826, Speaker B: I was a blast.
01:29:22.858 - 01:29:23.660, Speaker A: I like it. Yeah.
