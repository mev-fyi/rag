00:00:00.090 - 00:00:23.914, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co hosts today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:23.962 - 00:00:32.934, Speaker B: Alright, everyone, this episode brought to you by our friends at Avalanche. They are the Layer One blockchain that is fast, stable and scalable. You're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. For now, let's get into it.
00:00:32.972 - 00:00:57.470, Speaker C: Sushi in 2021, they spent over $500 million of token emissions. That is so much money. And what would happen if they had that money now? That would be a lot more useful in growing their market share. And so I think you keep incentives low, you keep cash flow going to the core developers, and then you wait till the last possible second to turn on the fee switch.
00:00:59.650 - 00:01:07.534, Speaker D: Welcome to Bell Curve. We've got the four of us here back again this week. We're starting off with a couple of shills.
00:01:07.662 - 00:01:33.898, Speaker C: Permissionless is the number one crypto conference in Blockchain. And last year's Miami event was one of the most well attended circuit conferences that I've ever seen. Yeah, wherever it was, it's a hazy period of time. It was great. And next year they're doing it in Austin, Texas. Austin, Texas, which is the capital of Texas. And it'll be super fun.
00:01:33.898 - 00:01:36.278, Speaker C: So, yeah, sign up now, get your tickets.
00:01:36.374 - 00:01:39.558, Speaker D: We're both going and excited to attend.
00:01:39.734 - 00:01:44.960, Speaker B: Yeah, you buried the lead, fellas. You guys are both that's the draw here. We got the framework, guys.
00:01:45.890 - 00:01:48.750, Speaker C: Yeah, it'll be great. It'll be a good time, man.
00:01:48.820 - 00:01:52.590, Speaker A: We have a VP of Marketing role open. I know. Who is not getting that role.
00:01:57.570 - 00:02:08.202, Speaker D: Man. The other show that we've got for this week is A Thousand X, the new podcast coming out of Blockworks featuring it's Avi, who's leading it regularly?
00:02:08.366 - 00:02:10.518, Speaker B: Avi Feldman. Yes, yes.
00:02:10.684 - 00:02:21.722, Speaker D: Avi Feldman will be leading it regularly. He is the head of Digital assets at, I believe, golden Tree and General Crypto native. Exciting to hear more about the market.
00:02:21.776 - 00:02:36.080, Speaker B: Takes from Avi and Joan of they will be had. It's a great episode. It's a great podcast, guys. It's going live on the Empire feed as well. So definitely make sure you check it out. We're big fans of the work.
00:02:36.850 - 00:02:42.494, Speaker D: I honestly did listen to the first half, maybe the first third of it this morning. It's good. I'm going to enjoy that one.
00:02:42.532 - 00:02:44.366, Speaker A: It's really good. First episode. It is good.
00:02:44.468 - 00:02:45.470, Speaker B: Yeah, very good.
00:02:45.540 - 00:02:58.920, Speaker A: Vance, he called you a smart guy. Said he thinks that you know some things in my conversation with him today. So you should listen to actually, Vance was not going to listen. Now Vance is definitely listening to it.
00:03:02.330 - 00:03:16.694, Speaker B: They're men of culture. They're men of culture. Yeah. Actually, Vance got two shout outs on Blockworks podcast. We have a podcast that our analysts do called Zero X Research. And there's A in the hot seat. So basically someone who's messed up this week, binance was in the hot seat.
00:03:16.694 - 00:03:29.280, Speaker B: And then there's the Cool Throne for best Take of the week. And Vance's l one tweet thread was the cool Throne take of the week. So you got some shout outs? Yeah.
00:03:33.190 - 00:03:37.810, Speaker D: I mean, sounds like a good place to start. What was this thread?
00:03:39.030 - 00:03:40.660, Speaker C: I think we discussed this.
00:03:42.390 - 00:03:42.850, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:42.920 - 00:04:18.590, Speaker C: I don't want to beat a dead horse, but seems like SBF put a lot of client money into Salana, and a lot of these all L1s are valued based on that come up. So could be an interesting year for those high value private projects. If you raise 200 or $100 million I saw today that Aztec raised. I don't know who leads your next round, but you're going to have to prove your worth as a public network, which is going to become increasingly harder. So that's kind of my take. I've gotten a lot of shit for that take, too. People have reached out and been like, you're so cynical.
00:04:18.590 - 00:04:32.798, Speaker C: How could you just beat up on the builders like that? But I feel like at this point, we should be trying to not view the past with rose colored glasses. We should be actually trying to figure out what happened and what that means for going forward. And that was my best approximation of the truth.
00:04:32.894 - 00:04:45.410, Speaker B: I'm worried about getting outclassed in the debate here, but I actually think that solana is probably one of the better risk reward bets that you could make in crypto right now and not financial advice.
00:04:45.570 - 00:04:49.350, Speaker C: That sounded a little bit like it's not financial advice.
00:04:50.650 - 00:05:30.722, Speaker B: All right, it's not financial advice. You can relax, budy. But let me tell you my sort of thinking on this, and then you can tell me why I'm wrong. But the whole argument of SBF, basically, which it looks like he was doing this right, he was basically selling Bitcoin and ETH, so artificially depressing that price in exchange for pumping up his sancoins, which you could sort of group solana in that bucket. But that's not a fundamental argument why solana may or may not have worth. That's a technical argument for buying and selling over a specific period of time. Right? So just because Sam bought Solana doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't affect the fundamental first principles use case for why solana may or may not be valuable.
00:05:30.722 - 00:05:59.274, Speaker B: I think overall, there's going to be demand for what solana values, which is they've know the way that they do, their consensus mechanism and the composability. I do think that there's probably some use case for what they're building. So I don't know, I kind of think that if they make it through the crucible right now, it's either not going to work or it's going to be a lot more successful than it is today. So that would be kind of my argument.
00:05:59.402 - 00:06:07.230, Speaker D: So follow up question there. How do you value or how should you value valuation theories of base layer chains?
00:06:07.810 - 00:06:19.510, Speaker B: I'd say I guess it's like whatever you can sell the block space for essentially. Right. So it's kind of tough to there's like a fee market, right? I guess that's how I would roughly look at it from a high level.
00:06:19.660 - 00:06:54.702, Speaker D: Exactly. And that kind of equates to revenue. Revenue minus inflationary, which inflationary tokens, you could say that's cost. And so revenue minus cost profit is generally how I would say this is like super simplified, but it is probably how you could value most of these businesses. The other way to look at it as well. The same way to look at it. But another angle is to say, okay, all the different apps that are building on top of the chain, the amount of transactions that are going through in each one of those apps and the amount that people are willing to pay or developers are willing to pay for the transactions going through those apps.
00:06:54.702 - 00:08:10.086, Speaker D: So it's basically quantity times price equals revenue. The reason why I think a lot of this comes down to who is actually buying, who is selling, is that there is sort of a halo effect of wealth creation that drives a lot of people to choose one blockchain over another. And same thing happens on the flip side, which is as you're on the rise and you're know, if you're a developer building on top of Solana, chances are you either need to have Solana or you have some in general already. And as you start to see your purchases of Solana, of Sol go up in value, it has this halo effect where you are now kind of feeling good about the ecosystem, feeling good about the blockchain. It has a reflexive up, but also a reflexive down perspective. And it sounds really simplistic to think about this, but when ETH was priced at $4,000 and some person who wanted to come into the ecosystem and buy, I don't know, like an ETH and it costs $4,000, that price point is actually pretty restrictive. I think there is actually some effect of not only prices going up, but whatever the price point is being really important as to how you should value these ecosystems.
00:08:10.086 - 00:08:29.920, Speaker D: Because the value of the ecosystems is the leading indication of how many apps are building on top of it. Where developers are going will ultimately translate to revenue anecdotally. There's just a lot of people that are pulling away from Solana for a number of different reasons right now. And so that kind of leading indication is sort of the reflexive down.
00:08:30.450 - 00:09:31.940, Speaker B: I want to get into this idea like modular versus monolithic blockchain. Ultimately, I think most blockchains end up being modular, but I think it's a valid thesis, I think, to have some use case for monolithic blockchains. But if I just close my eyes and I'm like, how do I think this is ultimately going to play out? I think the big challenge of crypto is trying to scale throughput while maintaining security and meeting demand. Like, that's the challenge that crypto blockchains ultimately have, right? They are kind of deluged by this unbelievable increase of demand and some of that spills over into these alternative layer one chains. I think ETH's roadmap is ultimately a good roadmap, but it's not going to be able to scale proportionally with these insane waves of demand that come into crypto. Just by virtue of that alone, I just think there are going to be other layer one blockchains that end up succeeding. I also kind of think some of this probably is just and honestly, the other thing too is I think one lessons that investors might have learned looking back at this last bull run is that the only thing that is still really investable in crypto is layer ones.
00:09:31.940 - 00:10:07.850, Speaker B: I do not mean this in any way offensive. Like the DAP builders, you guys are fucking awesome. And ultimately I think DApps should be more valuable than the layer ones they're built on. But guys, we've shown this chart before on this podcast. Look at all of the DApps on ETH denominated in ETH it's like down only charts. So I think what a lot of investors might have looked at has been like, look, DApps are just uninvestable at this point because you could just buy the layer one. And history tells us that the layer one is going to return more than the DApps that are built on the ecosystem.
00:10:07.850 - 00:10:39.642, Speaker B: And they're the biggest and most liquid investments that you can make. So, I don't know, I'm kind of looking at all these things and being like, I think there's a decent chance that Solana makes it here and it's like, okay, if you put some money in and you lose it, it could go to zero. But so many people are so bearish on Solana at this point. It's kind of like what do you make if you're right and what do you make if you're wrong? And I think if you I don't know, that's sort of the way that I'm that would be my attempt to steal man. Because I agreed with a lot of what you said there.
00:10:39.696 - 00:11:14.926, Speaker C: Vance as mean, just like on the topic of DApps, this week actually there became a new number one by TBL DAP lido and this thing is just inhaling ETH and it's just stacking ETH. And pretty much all of the charts that you look at for its revenue are up. And to the right there are some apps that are really starting to demonstrate their value even in a bear market. I don't know if the lesson of last market is you should invest in the all l ones I think it's more so, like, we need to prove out product, market fit and use cases on the DAP level or else we're going to be circular forever.
00:11:15.118 - 00:12:15.046, Speaker D: Mike, what I would add to that, to your discussion, and I agree, like, on par, on the face of it, all of that is absolutely correct. The one variable that I'd add to all of this is modulo valuation, where the value of what you're buying something is a major component of how you can view whether or not buying right now, buying in six months, buying six months ago would have been a good idea. And value once again, comes down to valuation. Is this a good value investment right now? Even if it's down 90%, it could still go down another 90% before it hits zero. The value here is a very important thing, and I think that gets overlooked because all of these have different if every single token project, if every single blockchain had the exact same number of tokens, we would be able to evaluate based on price. But nobody really thinks about what's the market cap, what's the fully diluted market cap, how many tokens are left to be unlocked, what's the unlocked schedule. Those are all things that need to be put into the evaluation of when to buy or when to not buy something.
00:12:15.046 - 00:12:17.878, Speaker D: And I don't think that that happens enough, and I wish it did.
00:12:17.964 - 00:12:36.474, Speaker B: I think you're totally right. And by the way, at some point I would think that DApps end up they should be like higher beta to whatever l one they're built on. I would think that's the way that it should work. Right. Because they're slightly riskier. Right, so you're taking more risk. Investors should demand a higher return and they should be like high beta.
00:12:36.474 - 00:13:05.206, Speaker B: Lido should basically be high beta. ETH to way oversimplify. You sort of combine that with whatever revenue and caught their discounted cash flow, I guess. But it doesn't really seem to perform like that today, so I hear you. I'm also on the train of like, we got to build stuff that people want and charge fees for that and actually build sustainable businesses here. But I could definitely also see with my slightly cynical goggles on, I could also definitely see investors taking the other.
00:13:05.228 - 00:13:19.970, Speaker D: Side of that, the three businesses that are working right now selling block space, trading digital assets and staking. That's basically the only things that have you can point to multiple options of them that have over tens of millions of dollars of revenue.
00:13:20.150 - 00:13:35.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like on chain, like Perps is like a pretty good like GMX and dYdX. Also, again, not financial advice, but I think those are pretty interesting financial advice.
00:13:35.342 - 00:13:36.530, Speaker C: Section of the podcast.
00:13:40.390 - 00:14:19.242, Speaker B: Can we talk a little bit about I know we've talked a lot about SBF in general, but his trial, he got arrested this week, right? So he was actually supposed to testify in a hearing on the 13th, right? And we get a Tweet out the day before that. He's been arrested in the Bahamas and is now currently in Fox Hill, which is one of the top five apparently worst prisons in the world. I don't know. I'm not necessarily a fan of SBF, but I also just think from a humanitarian standpoint, like, no one should be dumped in horrendous situations like that celebrated.
00:14:19.386 - 00:14:29.934, Speaker D: The apparently contacted his family and let him know that they're not actually infested with rodents anymore. So at least Fox Hill is a little bit better than when it was imported.
00:14:30.062 - 00:14:54.314, Speaker C: There's kind of this interesting story of this guy. His name is Victor. I think it's like Ozenki. He's a Czech born businessman. He allegedly went to Harvard and he perpetrated like, a few large financial scams. This is like in the was like 1999, like 2000, that time horizon. And he bought Irish citizenship when they had like a pay for passport program.
00:14:54.314 - 00:15:20.286, Speaker C: And once he committed these frauds, he fled to the Bahamas. And in the Bahamas he was arrested and put into Fox Hill Prison. And he fought extradition. He didn't want to go back to the US. He didn't want to go back to Czechoslovakia, so he fought extradition. And he was in Fox Hill Prison for three years fighting extradition. I think it was from like 2005 to early 2009, and he successfully fought extradition.
00:15:20.286 - 00:16:00.494, Speaker C: And now he is effectively confined to the Bahamas. He's no longer in legal trouble at all. At least in the Bahamas, he's still wanted by the US and Czechoslovakia. But he fought extradition. He kind of lived to fight the other day. And the kind of trade off that he made was, I'll spend three really bad years in Fox Hill for a lifetime of freedom on the outside. I wonder how much SBF is studying that guy and being Know A, how do you survive in Hill? And like, what is the like, do you tap out that Fox Hill was bad enough and you just get extradited? Or do you try to fight it and stay in the Bahamas and potentially get some sort of lighter sentence in the case of know, whatever his name was? But I thought that was a very interesting historical precedent for what's going on.
00:16:00.692 - 00:16:49.114, Speaker D: The other historical precedents that I was looking up over the course of the week, know, as the indictment or whatever process was unsealed, you actually got to see what charges were being brought and how many of them were and where they were coming from. SEC, CFTC, and I guess apparently the DOJ is still working on other potential crimes as well. But the Southern District of New York has filed the charges. It's eight counts. If all of these counts are reached at the maximum level, what you're looking at is 165 years of prison, which is actually more than Bernie Madoff got. So don't expect that there's going to be that level of time that is served. On the flip side, you have Elizabeth Holmes who perpetrated $121,000,000 fraud against her investors.
00:16:49.114 - 00:17:28.778, Speaker D: And that was what she was committed. That's what she was found guilty of. $121,000,000 of fraud against investors equated for her to eleven point 25 years in prison. The levels of fraud that we're talking about here, and at least in the charges that were unsealed is to the tune of 1.8 billion. So these are massive in relation to what was just happening with theranos case, but they're also against lenders and they're against customers. And so I think the narrative of who this person is and how they're viewed like the court of public opinion, it's going to absolutely sway against him.
00:17:28.778 - 00:17:34.320, Speaker D: The other thing that I found in reading those indictments is it's very obvious that someone is talking.
00:17:35.010 - 00:17:35.518, Speaker B: Who?
00:17:35.604 - 00:17:51.426, Speaker D: We don't know. But it's not likely or reasonable to assume that they have this level of detail without sworn testimony, witnesses, and someone on the inside who knew, who's probably talking. Right mean, it just started coming out.
00:17:51.448 - 00:17:53.246, Speaker A: That folks are talking. Like what's?
00:17:53.278 - 00:17:54.974, Speaker D: The Ryan salami.
00:17:55.022 - 00:18:17.658, Speaker A: Ryan Salami, right. Ryan Salami went to the I think it was the Bahamas authorities and told them that he may have been committing fraud, that SPF was committing fraud by set. He told them the story, it sounds like, and this is how it goes, right? They say, oh crap, I'm facing 50 years in jail. Let me get out of that. Say it was all SBF, but also.
00:18:17.824 - 00:18:28.830, Speaker C: Ryan Slammy seems to be doing the right thing. So there's definitely good people that didn't know about this, seemingly, that were higher up. And I think that shouldn't be lost.
00:18:30.450 - 00:18:34.958, Speaker A: That's what's supposed to work, is that people come out and share the real story.
00:18:35.044 - 00:18:39.906, Speaker C: But I think that gets to the point of how contained this information was.
00:18:39.928 - 00:18:59.878, Speaker A: At the highest levels of mean. But I think we know said I think one of the interesting points is that only three people at FTX had the required passwords to transfer funds to Alameda. And this was, I think according to Salami, it was SBF, nishad and Gary.
00:18:59.974 - 00:19:01.194, Speaker D: Gary, yeah.
00:19:01.312 - 00:19:02.330, Speaker C: Where's Gary?
00:19:03.470 - 00:19:04.422, Speaker A: Does Gary exist?
00:19:04.486 - 00:19:04.822, Speaker D: Gary?
00:19:04.886 - 00:19:07.862, Speaker C: Does Gary exist? Fever dream.
00:19:08.006 - 00:19:09.820, Speaker B: I can see the back of his head.
00:19:12.130 - 00:21:09.874, Speaker D: So the other take that I had, and this one's maybe just like more because I share a similar hometown to SBF that listening to the whole thing with his parents and hearing kind of the backdrop of what they were going through, what their reactions were in real time in the courthouse, and just the backstory of what they've been doing over the last few years with FTX. I think this is representative of peak Silicon Valley, hyper woke, hyper liberal, hyper elitist parenting. And you think about it, you've got SBF, who obviously the child of the product of two Stanford Law professors, goes to an elite high school. Obviously MIT is super smart, super educated, and definitely has a lot of the same political leanings as his parents and isn't very well rounded, is hyper focused on this one category of the world uses, as, in his words, the woke perspective to shield and conceal what he's actually intending to do. And historically, in Silicon Valley, you've had this very hyper liberal, hyper educated group of parents that have been overriding overbearing on their kids, and it's been kind of boiling over and getting crazier and crazier over the last couple of decades. I would say it wasn't the case for me and my experience of living there, but just hearing I have two younger brothers and hearing about what their experiences were like or what their friends'experiences were like in Palo Alto, it really is like calling into question this entire parenting. And how do you raise a kid in this example and situation? I don't know.
00:21:09.874 - 00:21:13.860, Speaker D: That's been one of the takes that I've had over the last few days just listening to all this.
00:21:15.430 - 00:21:31.802, Speaker B: I only skimmed that article, basically, but I saw when he was referred to as being a fugitive, his mother, quote, audibly laughed in the courtroom and stuff. To be honest with you, I didn't even have a take. Is that sad or is it confusing? I really didn't know what to think.
00:21:31.936 - 00:21:38.826, Speaker C: I mean, probably in shock, just, like, have gone fully to the loony bin temporarily as they deal with this.
00:21:38.928 - 00:22:13.650, Speaker B: I have some empathy for the family situation, to be honest with you. I don't know. I've heard, and I understand how it looks. I get it. But I also sort of think you have a huge blind spot when it comes to your family, and it's like, hey, I've got this son who raised a bunch of money from a lot of other people, clearly fooled other people as well. And his family. It's now been sort of intimated that he was opening doors for him, and it's like, well, yeah, now that it turns out he was an enormous fraud and lying to everyone, that looks really sinister.
00:22:13.650 - 00:22:23.850, Speaker B: But also, let's say he had actually been what he was representing publicly to the world. And let's say your parents give you the benefit of the doubt. Wouldn't you try to help your kid do these?
00:22:23.920 - 00:22:24.346, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:22:24.368 - 00:22:35.726, Speaker B: It just wouldn't have looked quite as sinister. Maybe I'm extending way too much leeway here, but when it comes to family stuff, I always maybe give people passes when they don't deserve it.
00:22:35.748 - 00:22:36.174, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:22:36.212 - 00:22:40.762, Speaker B: But I don't know. I'm not in the cool throne.
00:22:40.826 - 00:22:48.980, Speaker C: See, if they were actually on the take, yeah, I'm very much there for they didn't do anything wrong, but they may have.
00:22:50.390 - 00:23:19.820, Speaker B: All right, there was some interesting okay, I have another question for you guys. So Sam got arrested. You said eight counts, right? It was basically everything that you might have hoped that he would get. There was wire fraud, conspiracy, to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud. There was money laundering there. They threw the book at him, but they also threw the book at him one day before he was supposed to testify publicly in front of Congress. And mean, what do you make of that?
00:23:20.290 - 00:23:49.480, Speaker D: Honestly, I think it's nothing burger nothing burger? The timing of it, sure, in retrospect it's suspect, but you saw his testimony. We all read his supposed testimony that I think Forbes published. He was just going to placate and pander and say, hey, I don't have all the data in front of me, but let me tell you my side of the story. And here's what I remember. I do not recall. I do not recall. It was just going to be that whole dog and pony show.
00:23:49.480 - 00:24:30.910, Speaker D: I think you wouldn't have been able to get him to stick to anything or really, truly answer something that would have been more incriminating know, basically Andrew Ross orkin was able to accomplish. And because of that, I don't think that there's that much value. The indictment was filed, I think, the previous Wednesday, and then was officially issued the Friday. So the timeline here isn't like, we got this thing in within 24 hours so that we could stop him from testifying. It's more so that this path was already getting was happening, but it wasn't something that we could really stop. And it just happened to land the day before he was supposed to testify.
00:24:30.990 - 00:24:36.866, Speaker B: But I don't know wait, can we just this is how he was planning on starting his testimony.
00:24:36.898 - 00:24:39.122, Speaker C: Oh my God, this is so bad. He's such an idiot.
00:24:39.186 - 00:25:09.754, Speaker B: I would like to start by formally stating under oath, I fucked up. That's the opening line. It doesn't get much better. It's just like, dude, come on. It's a pretty classic, pretty classic Sam, though I think there actually was one pretty interesting tidbit. So John Ray, the Enron guy, also testified, and I think he shed some pretty glaring light on stuff that people had suspected for a long period of time. So it's not really news to people who've been following this podcast or deeply plugged into crypto.
00:25:09.754 - 00:25:23.342, Speaker B: But Alameda did have an enormous exemption, right? Their liquidation on FTX had been turned off. They shielded the Alameda losses by moving it into an account titled our Korean.
00:25:23.406 - 00:25:26.146, Speaker C: Friend, the Weird Korean account.
00:25:26.248 - 00:25:26.894, Speaker A: That was wild.
00:25:26.942 - 00:25:54.158, Speaker B: Some of those you kind of have to laugh at a little bit. Here's one thing that I thought was actually pretty interesting, that didn't get an enormous amount of coverage. So apparently there was a blog post that was penned by Sam that was going to be released in September, which is we came, we saw, we researched. So that was going to be a blog post that was announcing the closure of Alameda back in know there's a.
00:25:54.164 - 00:26:20.840, Speaker C: Lot of different I'm not surprised, honestly. The secret to their success, the secret ingredient was crime. And then when they ran out of basically user balances, the ability to stop hunt people, special exemptions that they could move around, obviously then your next step is like, okay, how do we wind this down? But at that point, when you have a negative four or $5 billion weird Korean account, it's just over. You can't do anything.
00:26:21.290 - 00:27:09.482, Speaker D: Well, one of the questions that I have is like, okay, let's say they were able to accomplish shutting it down. What would that actually look like and how would that materially have changed the outcome of the events that happened over the last three months? One of the ideas that I had is they probably would have been able to conceal a lot of the losses within Alameda, and you would have been able to like so, yes, Alameda had trading capabilities. They had a bunch of losses, but they probably would have been able to shift money from right pocket to left pocket, left pocket to right pocket. I think you would have been able to fill a lot of the hole of FTX, but then it just got to be so big. And then when FTT bottomed and all of that, it just got to be too much. But thinking back to where FTT was in September, there's a possibility that this could have at least been a better outcome.
00:27:09.566 - 00:27:16.530, Speaker A: How though? The pile of money that they lost could never have been that big because it was a prop fund, they didn't take outside capital.
00:27:16.690 - 00:27:48.260, Speaker B: I've got a question for you guys. Did you see that they lost alameda posted or SBF, through his combined entities, posted a loss of $3.7 billion in 2021? I looked at that and I was like, wow, that's a really big number. But how did they even lose that much? They didn't raise that much money. How did you even post a net loss? Even if it's just a loss that's realized on paper, shouldn't there have been a gain? All the gains came in 2021. How could you have posted that loss in 2021?
00:27:49.190 - 00:28:18.234, Speaker C: There's like one explanation for that. The one big drawdown in 2021 was the summer, right? That's when you could have theoretically lost a lot of money. And if you look at the market, there's two peaks in 2021. There's like this organic peak around when Elon was Shilling dogecoin on SNL, and everyone was written like, Sailor was going to get nation states to put bitcoin on their balance sheet. That was like the organic top. Then it died in the summer. And then there was the Futures ETF run for bitcoin, where we kind of ran it back.
00:28:18.234 - 00:28:43.118, Speaker C: Turbo my hypothesis is that they blew up shortly after Elon went on SNL, and then they tried to make it all back by doing this kind of like degen gambling, trying to force a revenge pump on crypto, which kind of worked, but then they somehow got out over their skis. Again and got hurt more. But the only time that they really could have blown out was the summer in both summers.
00:28:43.214 - 00:28:47.790, Speaker D: Both summers. I mean, I think they got really pretty badly trapped in luna.
00:28:47.870 - 00:28:50.040, Speaker C: No, this is just 2020.
00:28:51.130 - 00:29:20.720, Speaker D: I'm saying both summers. The only way that you would have been able to realize multiple billions is if you lost. But then the other way that you can do this is you realize the loss. There's no tax loss harvesting rules in crypto, and then you can rebuy at a lower valuation. And then when you pull that out and you use that as collateral, so then you say, okay, I just rebought all this bitcoin, it's at a lower cost basis. I realize a loss and that's it. My cost basis is now at whatever it was twenty K at the time.
00:29:20.720 - 00:30:03.930, Speaker D: I'm able to actually go off and use it as collateral, which is not a taxable event, when I pull out cash against that collateral to then go off and trade. I think that's probably what happened, but it takes some maneuvering from a tax perspective. I'd be very curious to see what their expected financials would have been for 2022. But to just go back to it, the reason why I was saying Alameda could have concealed a lot of the losses is because they could have taken bad debt expense for Alameda and basically just not paid back their loans. And so you probably would have been able to conceal and contain a lot of the FTX consumer losses if you just basically had Alameda go insolvent and bankrupt.
00:30:04.010 - 00:30:08.106, Speaker A: Got it. I'm going to move us past FTX.
00:30:08.218 - 00:30:11.886, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm putting SBF in my 2022 rear view.
00:30:11.988 - 00:30:13.410, Speaker B: I think that's a good idea.
00:30:13.560 - 00:30:17.234, Speaker C: I'm done with his ass. He's gone now.
00:30:17.352 - 00:30:40.746, Speaker A: There are some interesting still implications of spill. There's still a little spillover right? There's some new stuff that came out with Genesis that looked like and then obviously, I don't know how much Mike and I should talk about the block, but another media company was taking money from Sam, so maybe one of you guys want to do that story justice just because Mike and I have a.
00:30:40.768 - 00:31:16.642, Speaker C: Little I'll do the block. Yeah, I mean, looks like the CEO had taken a personal bribe from Sam and not told the company. And the circumstances surrounding the actual sale of the company are pretty murky. But our base case is that nobody else the block basically knew frank, Larry, the rest of the people. I think this is just like a case of massive wrongdoing for just the CEO, basically. And now the question for the block is, you guys respect the block, obviously your competitors, but they are a solid cryptojournalism outlet. Frank's great.
00:31:16.642 - 00:31:49.102, Speaker C: Larry's great. The rest of the team puts out a lot of research, but the organization was huge and I think they're going to have know potentially right size themselves. They're going to have to focus on whatever's generating revenue because I think they kind of had just like carte blanche from SBF and the funnel of loans from him. But I think know good people, they're going to make it. It's just going to look a lot different and they're certainly going to be hopefully like a little bit more. I mean, they've always been pretty good investigative journalists. I think this was just a blind spot for them.
00:31:49.102 - 00:31:56.010, Speaker C: And so maybe just like a redoubling of like, okay, who exactly is in this ecosystem? Who's potentially nefarious?
00:31:56.090 - 00:32:22.334, Speaker B: All right, everyone, quick break from this episode to talk about our show sponsors, Avalanche. Many of you know Avalanche as the fast, reliable, and scalable layer one. The folks at Avalanche have a really great message for those of you who are in the crypto industry right now, which is bear markets are for building. So while a bunch of our friends over in CFI are kind of going through these struggles and travails, the folks at Avalanche have basically put their heads down and are shipping products that builders want. The latest solution elasticsubnets.
00:32:22.402 - 00:32:34.734, Speaker A: Right? And just to expand on that, avalanche is consistently upgrading all of their platforms. Right? So on the platform side, you've got Elastic Subnets, you've got new VMs. On the infrastructure side of things, you've got Core, which Mike, I know you used that the other day.
00:32:34.772 - 00:32:37.680, Speaker B: I was a bridgeor. I was a bridge or yeah, exactly.
00:32:38.690 - 00:32:50.690, Speaker A: So they're upgrading the infrastructure side with Core and Enclave, the chain has had like no downtime super customizable for devs. Yeah, if you're a builder. AVAX Network. AVAX Network, great place to be.
00:32:50.760 - 00:32:58.718, Speaker B: But do Yano and I as well. So definitely go check them out. But click the link at the bottom of this episode. Click the link, you're not going to get any credit. Come on, click the link at the bottom.
00:32:58.824 - 00:33:06.790, Speaker A: Give us the credit. Exactly. So, yeah, big thanks to Avalanche. You just had a great experience with them the other day on the user side of things.
00:33:06.940 - 00:33:48.930, Speaker B: Go check them out. Guys, thank us later. Let's get back to the show. I've got a question for you, just in terms of could be for the block, but it also could be for basically anyone that took money unknowingly, sort of from FTX and SBF, right? I mean, is there like usually you raise debt from someone, then you got to pay them back plus interest. But in this particular instance, the guy that you theoretically have to pay back plus interest to is bankrupt and in prison. So how does that look? I mean, does that end up getting clawed back by some sort of bankruptcy court? Or is it kind of just like, hey, you kind of got away with this because this person's in prison. I'm not a lawyer here, but how do you think that works?
00:33:49.000 - 00:34:06.918, Speaker C: It would have been cleaner if it was an equity investment in the bankruptcy process. You're basically selling assets. You're recouping whatever you can get and then you're distributing cash from the estate. And the estate is the person who's managing out the shell. John J. Ray is the estate manager for FTX. For loans, that's another category.
00:34:06.918 - 00:34:46.386, Speaker C: Those are things where you're sitting in a bankruptcy proceeding and you're saying, what assets do we have? Well, we have a bunch of loans out to people. What are our options for recovering that loan? Well, we can force them to pay it back and go after them, or we can sell it to debt collectors for pennies on the dollar who are going to go after them as well. But the common denominator here is that you have someone coming after you for the money. And in this case, it looks like McCaffrey is going to be that person. It's not going to be the block. McCaffrey mechanically was the one who received the loan and then he went off and spent whatever it was to use that money on. The bankruptcy estate is not going to go after the block.
00:34:46.386 - 00:34:57.962, Speaker C: They're going after Michael. Michael's problem is a different know. Like, you had these loans or this equity purchase of the block, he will then probably have to sell that to try to make hold of the creditors to the extent that he can.
00:34:58.096 - 00:35:36.674, Speaker D: So just to be clear on this, there were three loans that were given to Mike McCaffrey. The first one was $12 million loans so that he could buy out the existing owners of the block when he took over as CEO. The second one was a $15 million loan given to his holding company. All three of these were given to his holding company to be able to have operations expenses for the block. And then the third one was so that he could have a penthouse in the Bahamas. All of those went to his holding company. And I would imagine that the holding company, therefore, is the owner of the equity of the block.
00:35:36.674 - 00:35:58.394, Speaker D: And so not only is it sort of like, got to try a new path for the block going forward, you're probably going to have to restructure in a certain new way. And then it's a question as to who stays, how does it work. Negotiations with creditors is going to be the thing that takes a really long time, but this is going to be one of those negotiations and that holding company is definitely one of the debtors.
00:35:58.522 - 00:36:21.878, Speaker B: Well, I think if we have a take on it's, like, honestly, our heart goes out to the people like the block. I know they're a competitor of ours. They do great journalism. And it really sucks for the people that have been putting their life's work and their reputation into building something that stands for integrity. And I think it still does. But to have this sort of smear on it is like, totally unfair to the people that I think did super good work there.
00:36:22.044 - 00:36:23.446, Speaker D: Wholeheartedly. Agree.
00:36:23.628 - 00:36:52.094, Speaker B: Yeah. So heart goes out. It's a crappy situation over there for sure, but I'm sure they'll be okay. Do you guys want to talk about Sushi governance? There's actually something pretty interesting going on in that world. All right, so there's a proposal. So, Jared Gray, for those of you guys who don't know or might not have been following this, there was a pretty big, relatively hotly contested governance vote for who is going to be the new head chef over at Sushi. And this guy, Jared Gray, won.
00:36:52.094 - 00:37:37.226, Speaker B: So he made a proposal earlier this week basically to redirect funds into the Sushi Treasury. Right? So I'll just read you here what the proposal is in his words, over the past two months as head chef, I've spent most of my time analyzing the operational budgetary, expenses and liabilities to ensure the project's long term success. After reviewing expenditures, it's clear that a significant deficit in the treasury threatens Sushi's operational viability, requiring an immediate remedy. In my original post, sushi operated with an annual runway of 9 million U. S. Dollars. However, after my detailed review, we've reduced that requirement to $5 million, made the reduction possible by renegotiating infrastructure contracts, scaling back underperforming or superfluous dependencies, et cetera, et cetera.
00:37:37.226 - 00:38:02.022, Speaker B: However, as previously stated, sushi is currently near full distribution of its token supply this is important. We'll get back to this. And has yet to capitalize on opportunities to diversify its treasury and provide necessary liquidity for ongoing operations. The treasury currently provides for 1.5 years of runway. Therefore, the situation requires immediate action to ensure sufficient resources for uninterrupted operation. So I propose I'm skipping a little bit here.
00:38:02.022 - 00:38:42.020, Speaker B: I propose setting canpai to 100% of fees diverted to the treasury multisig for one year, or until new to economics are implemented, helping return Sushi's fiscal resources to the competitive level. An additional benefit of Kempai's solution to the treasury is the diversification of assets, which limits the need for market selling Sushi, which is a net positive for stakeholders. In addition to kenpai's revenue, the Sushi team increased its funding by securing several multi million dollar partner deals. Yet relying on business development deals is only part of the successful business model to secure Sushi's future. Do you guys, I've got some sort of thoughts on this, but what is your high level take about this?
00:38:42.790 - 00:38:54.806, Speaker C: So, 6 million to run this organization is very cheap. I think it's the first thing. If you look at the actual line items of the salaries, that's kind of what people most focused on.
00:38:54.828 - 00:38:55.234, Speaker D: CEO.
00:38:55.282 - 00:39:14.238, Speaker C: Four hundred K. Four hundred K for another person, three hundred K for a few engineers. That is expensive. But this is not a traditional technology job. You are taking on substantial risk by running one of these organizations. And if I was him, I would probably be wanting that much as well. Sushi is cheap to run.
00:39:14.238 - 00:39:41.334, Speaker C: It's 5 million. I was looking up maker Dow's. Last quarter expenses 13 and a half million. So it's like three x the cost to run Maker for one quarter that it is to Sushi for a year. And generally where we want to see Dows, like DFI Dows, and there's a lot of them. If you're small, 5 million makes sense, if you're big, ten to 20 million makes sense, but that's generally the range of acceptable inputs. I think you're going to see a lot of this.
00:39:41.334 - 00:40:34.390, Speaker C: Like, OOH, we've minted all the tokens, we've given them all. Like, it's time to redistribute the wealth. You're going to see a lot of token migrations, like when Lens did a token migration to Aave in the last bear market, that was to solve a lot of the problems that are endogenous in this proposal. But this is kind of what it costs. And I think people on the Sushi token side, the community are pissed about, well, the whole thing about Sushi is that you're going to give fees to the users and Uniswap doesn't do that. And now you're having to double back and say like, okay, we need to actually recapitalize the treasury for this to keep going. And I think the answer is just like, do you want more of a much smaller pie or do you want this thing to actually live on and grow and succeed? And the go go bull market, everybody just wanted tokens and yield, but now it's like you have to opt in to double down on this organization because they're just not going to be the same level of fee sharing that there was a year ago.
00:40:34.390 - 00:40:38.140, Speaker C: The economics just aren't there and it's just part and parcel of the whole.
00:40:42.270 - 00:41:38.890, Speaker D: Yeah. To reiterate everything that Van said, kind of aside from the operations and operating costs, I think one of the more interesting things here is just what happens with long term versus short term token models. And if you have the long term perspective of what this token is, where it'll be, and you know exactly where it's going to be in 510 years from now, you're probably going to be wrong. And so what happens? What you need to implement, I think, is usually some sort of like inflation schedule, some sort of change element that can be implemented. I think it was WiFi, why earn that? Minted an additional 20% of tokens to give to the core developers so that they were incentivized. Because remember, 100% of those tokens went to users of the platform, not the people who are building it. So you have to have the right incentive structures to be able to persist these in the same way that you would a technology company.
00:41:38.890 - 00:42:16.790, Speaker D: And the problem that you have with token models is that when you have a token and you give 100% of it away, 100% of it is gone. When you have an equity in a company and you have 100% that's gone. Next round. Next time you raise money, there's also an additional re up of the employee stock option pool. There's additional shares that are created. So you're always increasing that 100% when you do subsequent financings for companies and you just don't have that mechanism with tokens. And so there isn't a natural point where you have the same corollary with companies.
00:42:16.790 - 00:42:19.354, Speaker D: And so I think people are going to have to figure out ways to do that.
00:42:19.392 - 00:42:48.306, Speaker B: All right, can you comment on that exact observation? Right, so Sushi basically distributed an enormous amount of tokens to its community. Same thing with urine. Right. But the way that works in equity, this is a little bit of a funny thing that I think you could make an argument that it sort of comes over from Bitcoin, because the meme of Bitcoin is 21 million hard cap, never going to be another one fixed supply. Yada yada. And that sort of got borrowed. Right, because Bitcoin was the first one that did it.
00:42:48.306 - 00:43:13.302, Speaker B: That makes sense for like a hard money, commodity store value type thing. I don't think it necessarily makes sense for a lot of these protocols and the way equity financing happens, which is you issue new tranches of equity every time you raise subsequent round of capital so that you have a smaller piece of a much larger pie. It's kind of a better way of doing it for a lot of these. I mean, do you have commentary on just the what do you think about that? I'm sort of looking at it being like, why do we do it this way?
00:43:13.356 - 00:44:08.650, Speaker C: I think if you're going to have a finite supply of the tokens of your protocol, you should have a finished version of the product in mind. Is it going to take a year to get there? Is it going to take two years to get there? But at some point you need to kind of take your hands off the wheel and be like, we're not actually governing anymore, this is just and like, that's the model that works with having a finite token supply where you can't have any more and you're making decisions that are supposed to be not reversible. And I think a lot of projects are getting there, like, MakerDAO doesn't need inflation, lido doesn't need inflation, uniswap doesn't need inflation. They're kind of like finished products and I think that's why that works. But if you're building something that looks more like a company where you're pivoting the product, you're releasing new things, you're doing this, you're doing that, you're doing the other thing. Just like equity, you're going to need the ability to inflate your supply, to pay people, to keep operations going, to raise more money. And so I think we just had this mental model that we copied from Bitcoin, but it doesn't actually work in all kind of scenarios.
00:44:09.550 - 00:45:02.318, Speaker D: I'd actually test that. So I think every single private round of any equity financing, usually for a technology company has new class of stock and new refresh of employee stock option incentive pool. What I think also happens with publicly traded companies, I don't know the number off top of my head, but last I checked it was somewhere between two to 4% of stock based compensation for mature publicly traded companies. Happens every single year. So there is a natural inflation for products and services that are done because you still have to incentivize people to continue to maintain them, to work on them, to make them better. Even like Yahoo back in 2010 when it wasn't absolutely doing anything, it still had to pay people in stock based comp to be able to get people to show up every day and keep the lights on. And it's not the exact same with the protocol because you put it out on chain and it exists there into perpetuate and users pay the cost of operating it.
00:45:02.318 - 00:45:24.930, Speaker D: But there is an element of, like, if you are 100% deployed with all of your tokens and you can't do anything else, that literally means that it's over and it's done. And I don't think any of these things are really even close to getting there. Even the lidos and the Uniswaps and the matrix of the world, I think that they're close maybe to having the product that they want. But if they wanted to change anything, how do you get people to do that?
00:45:25.000 - 00:45:45.242, Speaker C: If you're going to have a decentralized protocol, both in terms of upkeep and governance, at some point it has to be done. You can't keep going back to the well, that's why Bitcoin is powerful. That's why Bitcoin only has 21 million. It's like, it's done, it's over. And that's my vision of a decentralized protocol. And even in Vitalik's roadmap, he's like, in five years, Ethereum is going to be a finished product. We're not going to have to govern anything more.
00:45:45.242 - 00:45:54.000, Speaker C: Maybe a couple of EIPS here or there, but we're not going to need the Ethereum foundation, we're not going to need all these discretionary tokens. I think that's where these should be going, at least.
00:45:56.610 - 00:46:30.550, Speaker B: Because the way that I would sort of view it is like, it's all about the return that you're getting for that inflation. Right? So, Michael, to your point about, okay, so you inflate by 2% every year. Is that good or is that bad? I don't know. What did you get for that 2% inflation? Because if the workforce that you use to procure that with that additional issuance makes the value of the company go up 5%, then congratulations, you had like 100% return on that inflation. So for me, it's less of a like, is inflation good or bad? It just depends on what you're getting for that inflation.
00:46:30.890 - 00:46:42.430, Speaker D: 100%. I mean, we talked about this when we were talking about the valuation model for base layers. It's what's the revenue and subtract out the net inflation. And that's basically how you get to net profit, let's say, for a decentralized protocol.
00:46:44.290 - 00:47:40.234, Speaker B: I also think one other little bugaboo is this idea, and we had Chris Berninski on the interview part of the show this week, and he, I think, put it pretty know, we talked about when is it appropriate to basically return funds to token holders? And there was this whole kind of emphasis on cash flowing protocols for a period of time. And that was always the appeal to Sushi, right? That you got paid out, basically. And there's this idea that when there's a bear market, well, everyone's like, well, hey, I'm already down 90% on my token here right now. You're going to take away my payment, too? It's like, well, yeah, dude, but you could be down 100% if you're not careful. Things have to be sustainable. And the other thing, too, is I take your point, Vance. At some point, these things need to be finished, but I would argue almost nothing in crypto, with the possible exception of Bitcoin, is finished before something is finished.
00:47:40.234 - 00:47:46.862, Speaker B: Why are we returning funds to token holders as opposed to reinvesting? That basically for labor.
00:47:47.006 - 00:48:31.360, Speaker C: Yeah, you shouldn't be you should be waiting as long as possible. Start with the assumption that these markets are far larger than we can even anticipate, and that market share is the most valuable thing. If you look at a discounted cash flow in ten or 20 years down the line, everything that I would guess would be keep internalizing the economics, keep improving the product, keep trying to get it to a finished point, and then at some point, maybe you can start returning cash flow to token holders, to the Dow, to whatever. But if you don't get that market share, it's not going to be worth anything. And you can see the reverse, where you spend your wad of tokens too early. In Sushi, in 2021, they spent over $500 million of token emissions. That is so much money.
00:48:31.360 - 00:49:02.774, Speaker C: And what would happen if they had that money now? That would be a lot more useful in growing their market share. And so I think you keep incentives low, you keep cash flow going to the core developers, and then you wait till the last possible second to turn on the fee switch, and then that's how you have the parabolic. Like, okay. Uber started in. What? Michael like 2005, 2009. Have they ever paid a dividend? No, it's been like a decade. I think that's the right timescale.
00:49:02.774 - 00:49:17.194, Speaker C: At least a decade, yeah. Ethereum the same thing with EIP 1559, and the merge started in 20 14, 20, 22, 20 23. That's the first time they ever talked about giving people money for holding Ethereum.
00:49:17.322 - 00:49:51.658, Speaker D: The other example that I think about, I don't know, I was living in San Francisco in 2013 through 2017, and that was the heyday for startups basically paying you to use their products. And it would be like, you get your dry cleaning basically like 90% off. And this company, Rinse, would literally walk up and give you a cookie every single time you got your dry cleaning delivered. And some guy that you got to know, you had this sprig concept, which is basically like DoorDash before that blew up and it would deliver you lunches. And there were all these things, all.
00:49:51.664 - 00:49:53.980, Speaker C: The free Blue Apron meals. Remember those?
00:49:55.070 - 00:49:59.098, Speaker A: I got lunches for $3 a day when I moved to I remember this.
00:49:59.264 - 00:50:00.446, Speaker B: I remember Yana did this.
00:50:00.468 - 00:50:09.710, Speaker D: Actually, it was subsidized Uber pool usually literally would cost $3.20 to get across San Francisco.
00:50:11.330 - 00:50:12.766, Speaker A: $5 anywhere in New York.
00:50:12.868 - 00:50:13.262, Speaker C: I know.
00:50:13.316 - 00:50:16.180, Speaker A: Like uptown. Fide eye. $5.
00:50:16.550 - 00:50:19.358, Speaker C: Dude, it's like $70 now. It's so expensive.
00:50:19.534 - 00:50:51.790, Speaker D: Yeah. So think about that and think about the correlation between that and everyone who has overspent on their marketing budget equivalently with tokens or with emissions, whatever you want to call it. And sure, maybe some of those implemented gains in market share, but I bet 99% of them did not work out. And most of those companies are probably gone. And I know most of them, the ones that I just listed are it's the exact same thing if you spend your marketing budget too soon or if you use it frivolously and you don't maintain that market share or it's not good spend, you're not going to last long.
00:50:51.860 - 00:51:36.140, Speaker B: Yeah. I also think that there were some bad lessons that were learned in this era of easy money and money printing and blah, blah, blah, and share buybacks. All of this is a question of where are you in the lifecycle of the company? Right? Share buybacks make sense when you can't more profitably allocate that capital towards organic growth like R and D or acquisitions or something like that. And you're like, look, I don't really have any good investments on the horizon. All the returns are below the cost of my capital anyway. I'm going to give this back to shareholders by buying my own stock back. But I think what that has morphed into in this wacky last two years is, yeah, we should buy the stock to support the price.
00:51:36.140 - 00:51:52.442, Speaker B: And a lot of people took that lesson away and put that I see some of people talk about this in crypto land like this. Like, yeah, go out there and market buy the token. It's like, what are you talking about? That is a poor use of capital.
00:51:52.506 - 00:52:14.374, Speaker C: Yeah. First of all, market buying a token right now, you're just not going to make any impact. You just don't have the size to do it. The reason that it worked when, you know, there was this legendary meeting where he told Tim Cook to start buying back the Apple shares. They had billions and billions and billions of dollars to do. But like, this is not just a company thing. This is how the stock market works.
00:52:14.374 - 00:52:52.978, Speaker C: This is what investors want to see when you look at a stock and you're an institutional investor, one of your main questions is what are the buybacks like? What are the employee stock compensation like? This has been institutionalized and it's not going away either. People are very quick to write the eulogy of, like, oh, free money, and how bad it was and how stupid we were and how it's never going to come back. But the tenure is at, like, 3.4. The average ten year yield from 2010 to 2020 was 2.1. We're not that far away. It's not like we've gone to, like, eight to 10% yields, flogged ourselves and been like, we're never investing in technology again. All of this stuff is still built in the stock market.
00:52:52.978 - 00:52:58.774, Speaker C: All of this stuff is still coming back. I think we just have a little bit of a hangover from a little too much a little too soon.
00:52:58.892 - 00:53:47.906, Speaker D: But let me also add on the stock buyback part in particular. That's not necessarily just like a one for one or like, we're doing this or we're doing that. We don't have anything to invest in, therefore let's give it back. It's part of a cohesive strategy and a cohesive plan. But also the reason why you buy your stock back isn't I mean, it can be to support the price, but usually what it's for is that adds to the treasury stock that the company then owns. And you can give that out as stock based compensation and the ability to say, okay, we are adding to the coffers of the company. We think that our stock is relatively undervalued right now is usually a good sign with a stock based or stock buyback because they probably know the internals of the company just as well as the CEO, and they're able to tell whether or not the stock is undervalued.
00:53:47.906 - 00:53:56.118, Speaker D: So I think there are multiple reasons for stock buybacks, but it is part of the options and the plethora of things that you can do as a company.
00:53:56.284 - 00:54:20.590, Speaker B: I would have more sympathy for that argument if companies weren't absolutely fucking horrendous at deciding when to buy their stock. Like, you can look at all this data. They buy the top and they sell the bottom. Except for one guy, John Malone, who's like, famously good at this. He's sort of telecom tycoon who was really, really good at buying his stock when it was low and issuing stock when it was high.
00:54:20.740 - 00:54:22.240, Speaker C: Is he the guy?
00:54:22.610 - 00:54:26.110, Speaker D: No. What happened?
00:54:26.260 - 00:54:28.426, Speaker B: You rolled up? Kicking?
00:54:28.538 - 00:54:29.574, Speaker C: Still kicking?
00:54:29.722 - 00:54:30.514, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:30.712 - 00:54:35.586, Speaker C: Miss that guy used to watch his, like, Sunday cook offs, I think.
00:54:35.608 - 00:54:39.286, Speaker A: John Malone is now the largest landowner in the entire United States.
00:54:39.468 - 00:54:40.822, Speaker C: I believe that's correct.
00:54:40.956 - 00:54:46.360, Speaker A: It's either him or Bill Gates or Ted Turner or maybe yeah.
00:54:47.370 - 00:54:57.430, Speaker B: You know, it'd be very interesting. I wonder if anyone on Yanner's recommendation. I'm listening. Or I'm watching this documentary on Rupert Murdoch. It's on HBO. It's pretty good. Empire of influence.
00:54:57.430 - 00:55:11.440, Speaker B: And my mom. Actually just read the Ted Turner documentary and their know, supposedly as guys on the total different ideological spectrum, there are mirror images of these in a lot of different.
00:55:13.890 - 00:55:16.180, Speaker C: Just you should be wild back then.
00:55:17.910 - 00:55:39.126, Speaker A: Same with John Malone, by the way, all three of them. So I watched this Rupert Murndock documentary, and then I read John Malone's biography and Ted Turner's biography. They're all like these media tycoons. They just bet the farm over and over and over again for like 40 years in a row. Like, every three years, they make a bet the farm decision.
00:55:39.318 - 00:55:41.814, Speaker C: So much survivorship bias in the biographies.
00:55:41.862 - 00:55:59.934, Speaker B: That you read versus the ones you don't. God, yeah, 100%. And people just told these guys, this is a bad idea. There is a low likelihood of success for minimal outcomes, but they just kind of rolled the dice and it ended up working for a lot of them also.
00:55:59.972 - 00:56:03.440, Speaker C: Both let's talk about 2023.
00:56:04.050 - 00:56:07.666, Speaker A: Yes. All right, in what sense? What do you want to talk about?
00:56:07.768 - 00:56:09.970, Speaker C: I don't know. How are you guys feeling?
00:56:10.790 - 00:56:24.082, Speaker A: I have a question for you, Van. This is not about 2023. Are you guys buying so we just started seeing the Venture stuff at like, 80% discounts, like some of these later stage stuff. Do you guys buy those just out of curiosity?
00:56:24.226 - 00:56:26.440, Speaker D: We have we look at everything.
00:56:30.010 - 00:56:31.126, Speaker A: Good to know.
00:56:31.308 - 00:56:35.578, Speaker B: Yeah. Hard, maybe. I honestly just because we have to.
00:56:35.584 - 00:56:39.500, Speaker C: Be accurate, we have we continue to look at stuff like that.
00:56:40.110 - 00:56:42.220, Speaker A: All right, now we can talk about 2023.
00:56:42.830 - 00:57:27.770, Speaker B: Well, first of all, I want to do a more all encompassing predictions episode. We should do that to kind of cap off the year. But I also think I honestly am going into 2023 feeling very optimistic, like, very positive. And I sort of think it comes across a couple of different dimensions, which is there was like a period of time, like post luna when everyone was like, oh, this has got to be the bottom. And Yanner and I used to have these conversations where it's like, I don't think so, because everyone's still way too angry. There's, like, a lot of emotion and angry, and people are engaging and yelling at other people. And now we've sort of entered what feels like this very apathy and when it isn't apathy.
00:57:27.770 - 00:58:11.100, Speaker B: So people at the peak of the bull market, this is purely a sentiment based thing, but people used to get very angry when you would even suggest something negative, right? When you breathe the word of possible skepticism about X, Y, or Z thing, people would yell at you. Now, we get a lot of comments on our YouTube. The best contraindicator is the Blockworks YouTube comment section, because whenever you say something bullish or positive, people get mad at you. They're like not having it. And I don't know, FTX, which is a top three crypto exchange imploded, and we didn't really put in new lows so I'm kind of just like I don't know, I feel sort of positive going into the new year, to be honest.
00:58:11.550 - 00:59:07.254, Speaker C: I share the optimism. I read a lot of financial history, not because I'm trying to out macro people, I just like to understand the different cycles and how people felt and all that stuff. And the cool part about the history of finance is that there's literally 200 250 years of data about how things traded, what happened after big collapses, what happened after big booms, and mean reversion is a seriously powerful force. If you look back, it's very rare for you to get smoked twice back to back one year and then the next. Usually there's some sort of at least relief. And so when you're up 20 or ten or 15% like it was in 2021, you naturally get nervous about the downside. But now it's like, I don't know, unless there's centuries of mean reversion, data that's wrong feels like it'll at least be a little bit more accommodative.
00:59:07.254 - 00:59:19.840, Speaker C: And washing out all of the bad players helps to add to that story. The worst thing that we could do is just carry some bodies with us into 2023. I would like to leave those behind if at all possible.
00:59:20.210 - 01:00:04.938, Speaker D: The thing that I'd add just from a macro perspective, I think from a micro perspective, my quick take is that things are starting to work. We're starting to see games that have hundreds of thousands or potentially single digit millions monthly active users. Things are launching. You start to see the revenue numbers of some of these staking options and providers and those are working as well from a business perspective. So the green shoots of the micro side of it are popping through and I bet that they expand over the next six ish months. I would say the overhang that I'm thinking about right now is what happens once Shanghai goes in. That feels like the last piece of FUD that oh my God, you got 15 million ETH that's about to become withdrawn and sold on market.
01:00:04.938 - 01:00:51.402, Speaker D: Obviously that's not going to happen, but that's one of the big kind of variables that I'll be looking to in March when that finally goes through. But I'd say on the macro side, the way that I've been thinking about it and Vance and I had a conversation this week with a couple of other friends in the space and basically the stock market has been a tail of two cities over the last twelve months. Maybe like the last 15 months where you've had the S and P 500 is only 15% off of its highs right now. It's not a bear market in the sense of the global US economy. Unemployment still doesn't budge even this week with the new unemployment numbers, the economy is still working. But the thing that's the other city has been anything that's a risk. Asset growth stocks are down 70, 80, 90%.
01:00:51.402 - 01:01:12.580, Speaker D: Crypto is obviously taking a shellacing. And I think what we're going to start to see is like a shifting back of the subcategories of the market that have done well. Energy and materials and chemicals, they've all done really well this year. Back to some of the risk assets, some of the growth assets that just got hurt over the last 15 months.
01:01:13.350 - 01:01:14.994, Speaker C: That's probably how I would peg it.
01:01:15.032 - 01:01:25.720, Speaker D: But I don't know if we're going to have like a banner year in the SP writ large. I think we're just going to have subsectors doing much better and the ones that have been doing well probably a rotation out of those.
01:01:26.490 - 01:01:50.826, Speaker C: Last thing I'll add to add to Michael's point, if you look at goldman's 2023 outlook, the two top ideas that they have are short the s and p and then commodity super cycle. So they think of these are going to go up 43%, and they think short s and p is going to net you like 20% or something like that. Same people who were telling you last year that we were bound for all time highs this year, and that long s and p was the consensus.
01:01:50.938 - 01:02:09.142, Speaker B: Okay, all right. So I was actually at the salana, like the breakpoint top signal of all top signals. And I actually remember somebody saying at this crypto thing, because people back then, this was a legitimate thing people debated about, do you believe in the super cycle? And someone was telling me how.
01:02:09.196 - 01:02:10.710, Speaker C: Do you believe in Santa Claus?
01:02:12.570 - 01:02:33.486, Speaker B: No, someone was actually telling me how every couple of years in commodities, someone comes out and calls it a commodity super cycle and it ever, ever is. And they were like, oh, well, we see this in commodities. And that's why I don't believe in the super cycle for crypto. And it's just at the time I was like, it makes a lot you.
01:02:33.508 - 01:02:35.200, Speaker A: Don'T understand, suzu, man.
01:02:36.130 - 01:02:37.200, Speaker C: You don't understand.
01:02:38.210 - 01:02:50.990, Speaker B: I'll be honest, I never knew what revengeist was. I never googled it. I've seen it come up on twitter quite a bit. I've never looked into what that term meant, but I will forever associate it with suzu.
01:02:51.070 - 01:03:26.118, Speaker C: Suzu and his big brain. Yeah, I mean, commodities are very similar. I grew up in Canada, and part of my family is in the commodities business in vancouver and British Columbia. But they were the original people who there was this one year where loyal went up like two or three x or something crazy like that. One of the rich kids that I knew growing up, his dad bought the calgary flames. They won the stanley cup. So you had the commodity super cycle, you won the super bowl of canada.
01:03:26.118 - 01:03:54.178, Speaker C: And then there was this whole theory that Canada was just going to be the biggest country in the world and we were going to take over the americans and all that stuff. And a year later, there's bumper stickers around vancouver and calgary saying, Lord, give me one more super cycle. I promise I'll sell the top. This, like, getting worked and coming back. This was a lot of the story of at least the businesses that my family was in. But it's the same thing people always think can go up forever and then it inevitably doesn't.
01:03:54.354 - 01:04:37.534, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm looking for there was a chart on the margin. There's a guy named Yurian Timmer over at Fidelity who does, like, macro analysis for them. I like that guy a lot. And he showed this chart that basically forever changed how I thought about Bitcoin as a long term investment. And he basically showed, I'll see if I can pull it. And I was just looking for it on my email, but I switched computers so I can't find it. But basically he showed the very long term returns of cash gold equities, like debt, cash plus debt over long periods of time.
01:04:37.534 - 01:05:22.558, Speaker B: And what you can really clearly see is equities crushes everything else. Like, it's not even close. There's an enormous gap in between everything but what gold does over periods of times, it has these spikes. It has these spikes that because it's the exact thing that everyone says that it does. It protects your purchasing power over a period of time, and it's a hedge against when there's crazy debasement or inflation or whatever it is. And it just made me think it's the thing that people have always said, which is you want your assets to be productive. And it kind of made me think more of Bitcoin as a trade than as, like, a long term hold into eternity, because it doesn't compound it's.
01:05:22.574 - 01:05:31.398, Speaker C: Interesting, I just looked at the price. Gold's down 6% this year. You're only, like, marginally better than the S and P 500 where you might get a dividend too.
01:05:31.564 - 01:05:37.320, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'm with you on the gold thing. It would be tough to own, but.
01:05:38.170 - 01:05:45.580, Speaker C: My mind is still blown that gold has a 12 trillion market cap. How does that make any sense at all?
01:05:45.950 - 01:06:23.090, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. I have a theory about this too, dude. If you go back and look in the history of gold, like, the vast majority of gold's gains all came over, like, two periods, two periods of time, right, when they made it legal, basically, to own again. And then, like, once in the that crazy volatility. I think it just imprinted on one generation that you just hold this thing and it goes up forever. And that imprint, that psychological imprint has carried it as an asset class to this very day for, like, 60 years. Yeah, for like 60 years, because people are like, I learned my lesson.
01:06:23.090 - 01:06:30.550, Speaker B: I don't sell gold. And I just think they have. I respect the people who hold the gold, but, yeah, that's kind of what I think.
01:06:30.700 - 01:06:47.950, Speaker A: How much of the gold reserves? Wait, so gold has a $12 trillion market cap? How much of that is held by countries because you got to assume the US has probably us definitely has the largest gold reserve. I bet the US has like 10% of that. I bet they have like a trillion.
01:06:48.930 - 01:06:50.510, Speaker B: I think more than that, even.
01:06:50.660 - 01:07:02.180, Speaker C: Top ten Central Bank Gold Holdings. Can we actually guess investinggold.com, which is a real website? Okay, you want to go first? What do you think the United States has?
01:07:05.110 - 01:07:06.786, Speaker D: I'm going to say less than a trillion.
01:07:06.898 - 01:07:09.062, Speaker B: Yeah, far less.
01:07:09.196 - 01:07:11.480, Speaker C: Okay. Yano, you want to go for them?
01:07:12.010 - 01:07:13.960, Speaker B: 100 billion, I'd say.
01:07:15.450 - 01:07:20.010, Speaker A: What do I think they actually have? Yeah. Somewhere between 500 billion and a trillion.
01:07:20.750 - 01:07:23.878, Speaker B: I think I know the bank that has the most can I just skip?
01:07:23.974 - 01:07:43.360, Speaker C: Yano guessed a range which was not actually allowed. You guessed a 500 billion dollar range. The other contestants split it value. Smart. It is $528,000,000,000, strangely. All right, for bonus, what's the second biggest country?
01:07:43.730 - 01:07:44.150, Speaker B: Russia.
01:07:44.170 - 01:07:45.394, Speaker C: And how much do they have?
01:07:45.512 - 01:07:54.050, Speaker A: One of the European countries? It's either Russia or it's either Russia or one of the top or probably Germany.
01:07:54.470 - 01:07:58.470, Speaker C: I'll give you a hint. It's culturally on the nose that they would have this much gold.
01:07:58.810 - 01:07:59.670, Speaker B: India.
01:08:00.090 - 01:08:01.814, Speaker C: Nope. That is a good guess.
01:08:01.932 - 01:08:02.950, Speaker A: Germany.
01:08:03.450 - 01:08:06.280, Speaker C: There we go. Very German to hold a lot of.
01:08:07.690 - 01:08:15.610, Speaker A: Interesting, very conservative wait, and what do we think they have relative to the I bet it's one quarter of what the US.
01:08:15.680 - 01:08:16.106, Speaker C: Has.
01:08:16.208 - 01:08:17.900, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say 100.
01:08:18.670 - 01:08:20.140, Speaker C: They've got about half.
01:08:20.690 - 01:08:21.680, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
01:08:23.570 - 01:08:29.822, Speaker C: There's a good economist article that's saying how all the autocratic nations are buying up gold this year.
01:08:29.956 - 01:08:30.542, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:30.676 - 01:08:36.558, Speaker C: So Russia has about a hundred billion quarter of what the US. Has.
01:08:36.724 - 01:09:02.774, Speaker B: Yeah. They've been buying. Yeah, they've like totally petered off track. But if you're in Russia, I mean, people really disregarded this. When we froze all those Central Bank assets for Russia and people said, well, look, it's a signal of strength for the dollar, but come on, put yourself in the position of a nation that does not have their interests aligned with the United States. I mean, you have to be developing contingency plans.
01:09:02.822 - 01:09:03.130, Speaker C: Right.
01:09:03.200 - 01:09:17.422, Speaker B: Is that a crazy leap in logic? If your largest adversary on the political the global stage can just freeze your reserves at any given time? It's not going to be tomorrow. But you have to be developing a contingency plan there, right.
01:09:17.476 - 01:09:38.854, Speaker C: I would think that's what Felix Zelof, who did Zulov, was saying. Yeah, I was listening to that on the treadmill this morning. I was like, this is way too depressing. I got to take this out. He's a big proponent of the autocratic nations are going to buy commodities and bury them in the ground. Yeah, I don't know if that even really matters if it's on the margin. These things are so small.
01:09:39.052 - 01:10:03.166, Speaker B: I've been listening to Felix Zulov for a while. He's pretty on the money. If you listen to him over periods of years, he's pretty good, actually. But I hope he's not right, because, yeah, his predictions have gotten pretty dire. Although he thinks the bottom is coming in like Q One or Q Two of this coming year and then one big up and then big down.
01:10:03.268 - 01:10:29.400, Speaker C: The thing about all of these guys is I remember four years ago listening to Kyle Bass, the Hong Kong dollar is going to zero. We're going to short the hell out of it. I'm getting massive leverage and I'm like on these foreign exchange sites trying to figure out how I can short the Hong Kong. It's gone nowhere. Literally the whole trade has gone nowhere. China is going to blow up for the past ten years. Technology is overvalued for the past ten years.
01:10:29.400 - 01:10:48.218, Speaker C: Everybody's got an opinion. I just don't think his is well founded in reason. Inflation is going down, all of the components negative. Other than rent, you can really see it. So maybe he's just smarter than I am. Entirely possible, but I don't know where it comes from.
01:10:48.384 - 01:11:23.894, Speaker D: One call out, just on the inflation point, I don't know if you guys follow Trueflation. It actually has like a crypto component where they're putting it on chain, I think via chain link. But anyways, they've created their own proprietary, and I would argue probably more accurate in real time. CPI measure or alternative to CPI. Someone figured out that their predictions and their subcomponent predictions are exactly correct. They're just moved forward three months. So I think the October 1 was the equivalent of the December 1.
01:11:23.894 - 01:11:34.358, Speaker D: And they nailed every single component and the top line number. It was kind of a fascinating Twitter thread and analysis, but shout out to Trueflation, interesting.
01:11:34.524 - 01:11:35.510, Speaker C: Just give him a follow.
01:11:35.580 - 01:11:46.170, Speaker B: All right guys, great episode and we'll see you next weekend.
