00:00:27.382 - 00:00:52.090, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Maverick Protocol, a suite of liquidity tools built around an innovative AMM. Maverick helps token projects dow, Treasuries, LPs, or basically anyone in DeFi shape their liquidity with efficiency and flexibility. How, you might ask? Stick around and you're going to be hearing about them more later. Now on with the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another weekly roundup at Bell Curve. We got Michael's, one and two, and Vance guys, welcome.
00:00:52.160 - 00:00:53.242, Speaker B: We're back. We're so back.
00:00:53.296 - 00:01:45.066, Speaker A: Why don't we start with talking about obviously we have the SBF trial that's going on right now. We're just talking a little bit before we can get into some of the details about the trial, which I feel like there have been a couple of tidbits that have trickled, you know, that we didn't really know going in. I think the one thing that has surprised people, I think maybe not you guys, but I was surprised by the takes of Michael Lewis actually in the book Going Infinite. So obviously Michael Lewis, the backstory here for folks who didn't know is before FTX was revealed to be a fraud and all the criminal activity that was going on there, alleged criminal activity that was going on there, michael Lewis was planted. And we can get into there's kind of an interesting backstory. Nick Carter has a really great thread about the IEX Lewis relationship. He obviously wrote Flashboys, which was the accusation being sort of an advertisement for IEX.
00:01:45.066 - 00:02:21.242, Speaker A: FTX has a big financial relationship with IEX, so maybe there's some kind of relationship there. But either way, Lewis found himself a plant for about six months in FTX offices. This book was being written, obviously then FTX imploded, and at least my assumption was going to be that all right, he probably did a lot of work, but he's going to have to rewrite it. And he came out and did a 60 Minutes interview and a whole bunch of other publicity, essentially, with the through line being these were some kids, they had a profitable business, but they just got in way over their heads. And now there is, quote, this SBF sized hole in the world. It's just been a pretty bizarre take.
00:02:21.296 - 00:03:08.166, Speaker C: The other blatantly or glaringly incorrect representation of the facts is that this was a bank run. And there can only be a bank run if you have under collateralization in a system because you don't have all the money available to be able to pay people back. And even if it is denominated in something else. We've talked about on this podcast, I don't know, nine months ago, about how it was pretty clear that there was rotation from assets that they didn't like into assets that they did like. So even if you didn't have a one to one backing of the assets that people deposited into FTX, let's say someone puts in a bitcoin and they're going to sell the bitcoin and maybe buy something like FTT or maps or something that they were trying to promote. Even if you didn't have that one to one, you still should have the.
00:03:08.188 - 00:03:09.578, Speaker B: Value to back up all of the.
00:03:09.584 - 00:03:37.838, Speaker C: Deposits, especially if you have a highly profitable business. And that's how exchanges work. That's not how banks work. And hence why if you have a bank run, you do, based off of basel requirements, have to have a certain amount of cash and treasuries and liquidity to be able to backstop the amount of loans or balance sheet that you develop as a bank. That's the business model of a bank. A bank run is not possible with a one to one backed exchange.
00:03:37.934 - 00:03:38.334, Speaker B: Period.
00:03:38.382 - 00:03:39.010, Speaker C: End of story.
00:03:39.080 - 00:04:23.790, Speaker B: I had a couple of reporters reach out to me about why do you believe this business? Wasn't very, very simple logic tree. So people only wanted to trade on FTX because you could trade against Alameda, you could trade crazy mobile coin perps, you could trade the Trump win lose, you could trade all these basically shitcoin perps that they launched and then subsequently destroyed. They were the initial liquidity providers for that. If you remember the Stargate IEO, they bought all of those tokens and then proceeded to seed the perp and trade against people. And that was why you traded there. You could trade against Alameda. And Alameda was so bad at trading that they had to steal customer deposits to backfill the shortages.
00:04:23.790 - 00:05:07.200, Speaker B: Like, IPSO facto, this was not a profitable business. It was just margin that was being internalized and then lost by Alameda. And that's really the only reason that people wanted to trade there. Same thing with Know, same thing with the holy trinity of like serum soul and I forget what the other one was, there's a third one. But this was not a profitable business, not even close. And I think the only other surprises to me the I've read parts of the excerpts on like some of the details are so sordid that Michael Lewis is sharing. Do you see the one where he's going through all the women that SBF slept with and SBF was whispering him this to him.
00:05:07.200 - 00:06:00.480, Speaker B: It's like Michael Lewis do you need to go to Horny? Is what is wrong with he's? Like he was know different girls every night of the week and like windmill dunking. What a chad. It's like, dude, how old are you? Just a picture of a person that was totally enamored by SPF and for some reason won't let it go. And I wonder if it's because of stupidity, if it's because of incentives, or if it's because there's something he's trying to expose facto rationalize for himself or his audience. But it's funny. I've seen a lot of Twitter comments from, like, ex Solomon Traders, which is where he used to work, and they know it's good to see Michael get exposed as a Midwit that couldn't make it as a trader was. Terrible at sales and is likely to fall for the sordid song of some random guy who pretends he's a billionaire for a short period of time.
00:06:00.480 - 00:06:05.138, Speaker B: I think he's just frankly gotten this one completely wrong.
00:06:05.224 - 00:06:26.466, Speaker C: I mean, he's gotten things wrong before. He wrote Liars Poker thinking that it would be this entire expose of the bond trading shenanigans that were going on at Solomon Brothers and destroy the industry. It'd take down the culture of finance. It did nothing more than engender a culture of finance bros for multiple decades that became it was like the Wolf.
00:06:26.498 - 00:06:29.590, Speaker A: Of Wall Street right before that.
00:06:29.660 - 00:06:34.490, Speaker C: He may understand how to sell books, but I don't think he understands the culture around the things that he's writing about.
00:06:34.560 - 00:07:10.422, Speaker A: The first thing that I actually thought about when I was watching all of this and I'm conscious of the fact that we live in a little bit of a bubble and we're really into the details and it's like, hey, it's this thing that you really care about. Now you're raising your hand. But my first thought was, man, maybe we gave the HFT guys a hard time. And I think it's sort of an open secret that anyone that works in high frequency trading is like, this book's not accurate. And what struck me, I think there are two levels to this. And one, I was listening to this interview that he gave. It wasn't the 60 Minutes interview, but I was struck by it's not like he got it wrong, a little bit wrong.
00:07:10.422 - 00:07:33.978, Speaker A: He got it 180 degrees wrong. And the phrase that he used was, he keeps calling it a profitable business, which it just wasn't a profitable business. So there's just a factual inconsistency there. But the way he describes it is there was this profitable casino, FTX, and then there was Alameda. And if it hadn't been for Alameda, then FTX could have gone on and survived.
00:07:34.074 - 00:07:37.550, Speaker B: And that is argument too.
00:07:37.700 - 00:08:04.962, Speaker A: This is what 180 degrees the wrong. Remember we had a conversation when FTX was imploding and we all were like, hey, well, which one do you think he actually wanted? Which one mattered more? And the answer is Alameda, because FTX was never real, but Alameda was the vehicle that he was using to siphon all of the wealth out of FTX. So to paint it like that from Michael Lewis is just so incorrect. But it's almost too perfectly incorrect.
00:08:05.026 - 00:08:13.290, Speaker C: And then you start to look at it on multiple instances and you're thinking to yourself, wait a second. This happens multiple times. How much of the entire thing is wrong?
00:08:13.440 - 00:08:14.634, Speaker A: All of the body of work.
00:08:14.672 - 00:09:02.290, Speaker B: I think his explanation was completely wrong. Pretty disgusting. No respect for victims. And the weird part is, in the 60 Minutes interview, he's like, what was he really doing? Stealing or rehypothecating money from just crypto traders? Who really cares about them? He was going to give Trump 5 billion not to run. And so it wasn't so bad, was it? It's like, no, those don't make it okay to steal from people, A. And B, the chances of that Trump phone call ever happened, I'm putting that at about 1%. Who knows what Michael Lewis was fed, where his primary sources of information were, how much SBF was just bullshitting and making up as he went along? I don't know, I just think it's so sad.
00:09:02.290 - 00:09:03.202, Speaker B: Book we got.
00:09:03.276 - 00:09:23.450, Speaker C: What will be very interesting, I think, is what the ultimate outcome of this trial is. Because in a certain way, it's kind of putting the story that Michael Lewis purported which, as you just said, is the same story that SBF is trying to put forward in court, it puts that case on trial, that storyline.
00:09:23.530 - 00:10:11.098, Speaker A: Hey, everyone wanted to take a quick second to shout out this season's partner Maverick Protocol. Now, many of you probably know Maverick as an innovative AMM, which they are, but in reality, they're a lot more than that as well. Maverick is a suite of tools for DeFi users and builders that allows them to put liquidity where it will get the most work done. Since Maverick launched in March, they have been gobbling up market share. And at the time of this recording, which is the end of September, on a trailing seven day volume basis, maverick is now a top three decks by volume, and they support over 50% of the volume on the L two ZK sync era chain. Maverick enables LPs and token pairs to process higher volume with limited TVL, which allows them to support some of the highest levels of capital efficiency for LSTs, like Rap Steep. Another very cool feature is something called Maverick Boosted Positions.
00:10:11.098 - 00:10:38.150, Speaker A: So that allows protocols looking to bootstrap their token liquidity to target the shape of liquidity of any token pair with surgical precision. Maverick is backed by some of the leading institutions in crypto founders fund, Pantera, Coinbase Ventures, Binance Labs. They are all backing Maverick in their vision to revolutionize the next generation of DeFi DApps and helping them build their liquidity in all market conditions.

00:10:38.220 - 00:10:46.954, Speaker B: Let's talk about the over under on years. Let's put hard numbers to it. Does he get off light? What does that mean? Does he get off not light? What does that mean?
00:10:46.992 - 00:11:04.786, Speaker C: So maximum is 115. Vance and I have talked about this. I'm putting the line somewhere at 20. You know is it is it well under that? Is it well over that? That's kind of the question.
00:11:04.888 - 00:11:20.438, Speaker B: Federal crimes. You also don't get good behavior out early dynamics on either. So he'll be there for however long he gets. I would say 20 is probably the right number. Sadly I would take the under on that.
00:11:20.604 - 00:11:23.830, Speaker A: I would take the under too. How long did Bernie Madoff get?
00:11:23.980 - 00:12:12.482, Speaker C: 165. 165. And then Elizabeth Holmes for securities laws violations. The sentencing rubric that she received was one year for every $11 million of fraud. And it was found to be that there was approximately $121,000,000 of fraud. And really what that represents is when she went to go and raise $121,000,000 from investors, there was misinformation, there was deliberate fraud about the representations of the company and people put in $121,000,000 and then it obviously went to zero. So that was sort of the black and white of what happened with her in eleven years for $121,000,000 of fraud.
00:12:12.546 - 00:12:39.098, Speaker A: I'm getting the same. I don't know, I just don't understand. One thing I'm very confused about is why this narrative is still hitting of a bank run. It wasn't a bank, it was an exchange. And I don't feel like that's a huge logical leap to make. I don't think that's something that you need to have a background in this industry to understand there shouldn't have been rehypothecation going on. So why is that line still flying?
00:12:39.274 - 00:12:40.142, Speaker B: I don't get it.
00:12:40.196 - 00:13:30.042, Speaker C: I don't know enough about the case or about the law to the minutiae of what else they could use. But if you just use the same rubric that was used in theranos case, how much money did FTX raise on false pretenses and how much was raised deliberately misrepresenting? All of the things that they had, the connections with Alameda, the use of funds, the profitability, if anything's, incorrect on that pitch deck. Coincidentally, Matt Juan is taking the stand today. He is a defense witness today from Paradigm. And so I think part of the case is going to be representing that. And in that case it looks bigger than I don't know if they can prove it. I don't know what's going on in the case outside of what we hear afterwards.
00:13:30.042 - 00:13:34.218, Speaker C: But I do think that there is a through line there in terms of just pure security sprouts.
00:13:34.234 - 00:14:17.200, Speaker B: The unanswered questions for me are probably the most interesting part. I put one of them, which is like what happened with that hack, right? I guess it was November 9 or whatever that day was. The 500 million that was stolen, who did it, who owns it, where's the money? Because it's moving around right now, a lot of it's. Wash trading NFTs on Salana in some sort of weird laundering operation. I don't know that's one. The other one I'm really curious on is the identity of Chef Nomi and whether we will learn that. And if it was SBF, because one thing that I'm curious about is Alameda started as this programmatic trading firm and they started with 170, and then they got redeemed down to like 30 or 40.
00:14:17.200 - 00:15:11.280, Speaker B: And then somehow that turns into tens of billions of dollars of tokens at some point. My theory is that SBF is probably Chef Nomi, that he was basically the large scale industrial farmer of Sushi, turned that money around, farming Sushi at $20 at like a $5 billion market cap where they gave away 100% of the supply, takes that, that's basically its capitalization base. Invest in salana, log wealth, ensues. And that's kind of like the story. But there is this missing middle of like, bro, you didn't make billions doing this Kimchi ARP where you lost the ripple token. Like what happened in the middle, that would be one thing I would be looking forward, understanding. And Shrelli, who knows, he's like a court reporter now, which is know, he's like showing up live, tweeting the whole thing.
00:15:11.280 - 00:15:22.100, Speaker B: That's what he says he thinks is going to happen. So lend some credence to that. We're missing the whole middle part of the story. How did Alameda get so much money?
00:15:22.470 - 00:15:30.646, Speaker C: I would love for us to be able to uncover that. I think the government is just going to take a stance that, listen, we have parts of this case that are.
00:15:30.668 - 00:15:31.346, Speaker B: Just dead to rights.
00:15:31.378 - 00:15:52.362, Speaker C: There's no way to deliberate on it. We don't need to confuse or add other flavors to this whole thing. We're just going to do the even very straightforward path. I hope that we find out more, but I unfortunately think it's just going to be like, let's do this, let's get it done fast and move on.
00:15:52.496 - 00:15:59.114, Speaker A: I would settle for the right outcome happening. My curiosity wants to know, but I'd be happy if just we get the right outcome.
00:15:59.162 - 00:15:59.614, Speaker C: Here.
00:15:59.732 - 00:16:47.200, Speaker B: The other stuff that I've just been thinking about as I read through the case and just the different things is there's this line, I think we've talked about it before, where what's the utility of a bet where you keep doubling up and you can do it infinitely until you get infinitely wealthy or you go to zero. And SBF has always thought of this as like the St. Petersburg paradox. And it's like a highly valuable game for him because he would just always keep betting, keep trying to double up until he gets to infinity wealth, and in his own words, lock into this hugely valuable existence. That really was kind of the underpinning of everything that he was doing. His risk management style, his trading style, like taking these huge bets where the payoff would be 100 X to one. It kind of just feels like that's how he ran the exchange too.
00:16:47.200 - 00:16:56.202, Speaker B: He's like, if I get caught, I go to jail, but if I don't, I become the wealthiest person on the planet and I can do all this effective altruism bullshit.
00:16:56.266 - 00:17:12.694, Speaker A: You know, where that doesn't line up, though, is don't you hit some amount of money where you just don't need, I mean, a lot, right? Like, let's say a billion dollars. I mean, what can you really do with 10 billion that you can do with one outside of the mega yacht, right? That's like the only I think the.
00:17:12.732 - 00:17:33.274, Speaker B: Hundreds of billions range gives you like nation state status, which is kind of even the Bahamas thing. It kind of all lines up with that. Whether this phone call happened or not with Trump, I don't think it did, but he's know I can give him 5 billion not to run. That's where his head was at.
00:17:33.312 - 00:17:37.710, Speaker C: He was also talking to the Bahamian government about paying off all of their debt, allegedly.
00:17:39.250 - 00:17:40.538, Speaker B: Yeah, that's so funny.
00:17:40.634 - 00:18:28.314, Speaker C: There's all these little tidbits that are coming out, and the only way that you could possibly think about paying five here and eight here, and pretty soon those small numbers would become a really large number, is if you're thinking in terms of hundreds of billions. And that, I think, is probably where he was shooting. I also think maybe there was some truth to him thinking that. Okay, you're right, though, like Mike, you're right. There's no possible way that a human can spend that level of money over their lifetime other than if they're doing things like what we're talking about, which know, buying, know, get out of jail free card in the Bahamas, making sure the Democrats win next, know against Trump. All that type of stuff is, as Van said, nation state level capital.
00:18:28.362 - 00:18:44.334, Speaker B: So the Michael Lewis excerpt, where he's like, no, Tom Brady really was his friend. They had this very special you made him $55 million. The craziest I thought, my friend, if I pay him $55 million kevin O'Leary.
00:18:44.462 - 00:19:02.962, Speaker C: $15.7 million for 20 hours of work. How much do you trust all of that? Kevin O'Leary saber rattling. Against FTX or against finance? In favor of FTX, right. As FTX was collapsing. Goes on CNBC. No, CZ did this.
00:19:02.962 - 00:19:03.642, Speaker C: I know it.
00:19:03.696 - 00:19:43.814, Speaker A: I actually meant to bring my tinfoil hat and I forgot to bring it. But the relationship that we were talking about with Lewis too, because folks might not be aware of mean, for those of you who read Flashboys, flashboys was one of these books that Lewis wrote about HFTs. And the way that it was portrayed was people didn't understand what was going on. There was this nefarious force for why people weren't getting the execution that they thought they should. It was shrouded in secrecy. It's this world of high frequency trading, and it was ripping people off. And it sort of portrayed in the same way the Big Short sort of lionizes the short sellers of the time, the Michael Burrys and Blanking on the other names, but sort of lionizes that group.
00:19:43.814 - 00:20:11.038, Speaker A: There was this group of insiders within institutional finance as well who were aware of this HFT problem, these predators that were preying on everyone. And what it wound up with was the creation of this exchange, IEX. Now, IEX is pretty much not successful. It has not largely been successful as an exchange. IEX stands for the Investors Exchange, and it's supposed to be much more friendly for investors, but no one really wants.
00:20:11.124 - 00:20:17.454, Speaker C: And just to be clear, this started as Equities Securities Exchange, had nothing to do with crypto.
00:20:17.502 - 00:20:34.774, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. So timeline here, and this just comes right from Nick Carter here doing his little investigative. Him and Matt are actually in another life. They could be investigative. They go in and get all the details. They do.
00:20:34.774 - 00:20:57.038, Speaker A: But this is really helpful. Like, in March of 2022, FTX and IEX pre partnership hold joint meetings with the SEC, aiming for safe harbor US operations. April 2022, FTX US announces an investment in IEX. The deal is described as small and strategic. Size. Not disclosed. Later emerges that it's 270,000,000, described as a controlling stake, as reported by the Financial Times.
00:20:57.038 - 00:21:21.880, Speaker A: Large stake with the option to buy. May. June of 2022. Michael Lewis begins closely shadowing SBF in order to write a Hagiography, presumably similar in tone to Flash Boys. Summer of 22, gensler keep meetings with IEX and FTX's lobby in Congress. The timeline clearly, if Michael Lewis wrote this book about IEX, he knows Ronan and all the guys over at.
00:21:24.810 - 00:21:31.322, Speaker B: The you know, the book ends with like, and these guys are going to fix it.
00:21:31.456 - 00:21:31.802, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:31.856 - 00:21:33.354, Speaker B: And then it didn't work.
00:21:33.552 - 00:21:34.058, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:34.144 - 00:21:41.260, Speaker B: What do you think the chances are Michael Lewis introduced IEX to FTX? Probably higher than like 20, 30%.
00:21:42.270 - 00:21:44.990, Speaker C: Or it could have been the reverse.
00:21:45.970 - 00:21:57.250, Speaker B: Totally. I wonder if Michael Lewis has any financial incentive in IEX or otherwise. Something about this is so strange and I don't think we're going to find it out exactly.
00:21:57.320 - 00:22:35.678, Speaker A: But one last thing, just because I want to leave FTX here, but do you guys understand? How does the claims market work for FTX? So I was kind of looking at this a little bit this week. Anthropic, the AI company that FTX invested in, has actually been doing pretty well. They raised a big round from Amazon. Then a couple of days after, Google looks like they're going to put in an additional $2 billion at around a $20 to $30 billion valuation. So that's good for FTX creditors, I think. I saw they're trading between 30 and don't know if that implies more recovery for that. How does that market actually work, the claims market?
00:22:35.764 - 00:22:38.062, Speaker C: It is not a very efficient market.
00:22:38.196 - 00:22:56.350, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. There's been basically no big claims that have traded, despite everyone saying to the contrary. I do think that Gloy sold theirs at like 14, which sounds bad. But also, Kevin can make money and.
00:22:56.520 - 00:23:01.814, Speaker C: Having the capital opportunity cost is expect this in years.
00:23:02.012 - 00:24:04.630, Speaker B: And it's amazing that Anthropic has been doing so well and that the recovery might be higher than initially expected, but anthropic isn't exactly a liquid asset either. Might not be valued properly either. Yeah, I mean, it's being done at, I think, 300 X revenue forward. So we'll see. I've heard just on the topic of claims and distributing crypto that was stolen back to victims, I think in some ways it's a little bit of like a bullish AirDrop. People not having their crypto is not helpful if people are somewhat recapitalized by a mixture of claims being distributed, price action, getting a little bit better, maker endgame providing a bunch of yield farms. I do think there is a world where these are actually bullish events versus strictly bearish, but it all depends on the structure.
00:24:04.630 - 00:24:21.790, Speaker B: And having galaxy starting to sell things for US dollars is kind of like the bearish side of it, but I don't think it's necessarily like a one sided good or bad thing. I think there's nuance there, and having crypto people back with their crypto, I think is just important in general.
00:24:21.940 - 00:24:29.066, Speaker A: I like this phrase they use, the Dgens need to be recapitalized. That stuck.
00:24:29.178 - 00:24:37.966, Speaker B: They do. I think there's a few opportunities for that to happen coming up. And frankly, I think of these as airdrops in many ways.
00:24:38.088 - 00:25:23.378, Speaker A: Let's move on from FTX. I want to talk a little bit about enshrinement with you guys and this sort of trend. So Vitalik wrote this piece this week about get the actual title of the piece should Ethereum Be okay with Enshrining? More things in the protocol. And I heard him speak at ECC back in July about this exact thing. He talked about it within the context of account abstraction and 4337. And basically he outlined this philosophy that Ethereum has taken for a very long time that was inspired by Unix, which is keeping as little inside the protocol as possible and pushing complexity out to the edges. But ethereum is a lot larger than it used to be back in the day.
00:25:23.378 - 00:26:09.502, Speaker A: It's faced with much more complexity. And I think this was Vitalik's sort of like reasoning about, okay, maybe it does make sense to bring some things in the protocol. And he went through a bunch of different categories that this could apply to, and we'll link it in the show notes. I'd encourage folks to actually go and read it. He spent the most time talking about count abstraction and 4337, and he walks through this entire history of trying to enshrine account abstraction or actually bake it into the protocol. And he talks about some of the technical challenges of doing that, but also why it wasn't prioritized at different periods of time. And it kind of gives you a very first hand understanding of why this is such a complicated process and the sets of stakeholders that need to align on something like enshrining.
00:26:09.502 - 00:26:59.934, Speaker A: So it was just a really good history of that. And he goes through a number of other categories that this could apply to. So he talks about ZKE VMs, he talks about PBS proposer Builder separation, enshrining Private Mem Pools, liquid Staking and Pre Compiles and everyone should go and read this themselves. This is where I'm just going to in my sense of he kind of goes through and talks about the pros and cons of Enshrining, each one of these group of things. ZKE EVMs, I think he was the most undecided on the ending was enshrining. ZK EVMs presents both promise and challenges. The challenge being you sort of have to pick one set of standards and then you risk favoring one developer.
00:26:59.934 - 00:27:40.958, Speaker A: Basically EPBs enshrining PBS is already the community has already basically decided that's going to happen. It's just an implementation detail and when it ends up happening liquid Stake, private Mem pools, the technology it seems like we need more technology there, but in theory it's a good idea. Pre compile seems okay. Liquid Staking is probably the one that spends is worth talking about because the pushback on Lido has been heating up quite a bit, I would say, in recent weeks and we've talked about it on this show. It was interesting to hear Vitalik's take on it. My take on Vitalik's take is that he was balanced. Vitalik is always balanced when he talks about this stuff.
00:27:40.958 - 00:28:19.958, Speaker A: But he did come out and actually say enshrining something like rocket pool or a mechanism that would support a rocket place that or a marketplace that rocket pool had built would make sense. And this is where I'm firmly entering my own realm of speculation here. But I think it says to me, and if you take that with the additional context of Dankrad and Danny Ryan and some of the leaders at the Ethereum Foundation pushing back really hard against Lido, I would just say it's indicative of the fact that at the very highest levels of Ethereum, people are concerned about the protocol. I have thoughts about that. I'm just curious what you guys think about this.
00:28:20.144 - 00:29:18.106, Speaker B: You want to enshrine rocket pool in ETH? That is the least decentralized worst option. I think Vitalik's take was honestly pragmatic and I don't think he actually said we should enshrine anything on the LST layer. He basically punted on it and he said we need to be kind of pragmatic and Lido is kind of the best that we have right now and hopefully they continue to decentralize and there's things that you can do on the margin, like setting the churn limit lower that theoretically could help. But I kind of don't get it other than they have a sensitivity around the LDO governance token being structurally important to ETH. I mean, look, you have all these L two S that have their own governance tokens that are arguably taking fees from you. It's like, how do you pick which hill you want to die on? I don't see them being able to a really do anything about it. It's.
00:29:18.106 - 00:29:32.722, Speaker B: Still growing faster than any other LST protocol. Their efforts are probably better used to coordinate and make it better in partnership versus getting into an antagonistic relationship with the 9 million ETH that are staked in Lido today.
00:29:32.776 - 00:30:22.340, Speaker C: It's on Staking in general from Pete to trough and I think Pete was around maybe mid to late June. In terms of the validator queue, it's literally down 90%. There isn't really as much, I think of an issue with needing to have to change dynamics of churn limits, which is effectively withdrawal limits or taking it longer to get into the validator ecosystem. I think a lot of this stuff is going to sort itself out. So I think that just generally LSDs are frankly just not growing as fast as they once were. There just aren't as many people moving into the validator process as there was. It's starting to peter out.
00:30:22.340 - 00:31:21.862, Speaker C: So I think market sentiment will probably change therefore, but I will say as more of like a global comment on any sort of enshrinement, there are things that I think make a lot of sense. Just something like account abstraction is a perfect example. It's a feature. It should be something that is in the protocol know, potentially pre compile as there there are things that make sense to just bring them in because instead of having some third party to often develop it and everybody has to adopt that standard. This should be part of the standardizations and it's once again vitalik pushing the ball forward, having the conversation around things that he used to think were sacred cows or maybe not quite, but something along those lines and questioning some of his previous assumptions. I think it's healthy for the protocol or any of the people who are working on the protocol to think about different ideas that may change as market sentiment and market dynamics change.
00:31:21.996 - 00:31:52.030, Speaker B: I do think Michael, just to talk about the drop in the active validator think. So we've done research correlations between positive price movement and e. Staking extremely think. You know, if you believe that know a bull market around the corner like we do. I think staking activity is going to pick back up. The other two tailwinds that I think Staking is going to ride are a restaking that is just like another source of yield. There's more money on the table, there's more people that will want to come and grab it.
00:31:52.030 - 00:32:46.850, Speaker B: And the second one, frankly, is just maker endgame wrap Steeth. If you look at Spark, subdou is the main form of collateral that's being used there to do all sorts of loops and interesting types of borrow trades. There's just going to be more yield on the table. It's going to drive specifically liquid stake tokens up, specifically the ones that have enough network effects and collateral backing to be used in these protocols. So I see no other real option other than for Lido to grow and to figure out how to decentralize itself further, I don't think you can really reverse put the cat back in the bag and reenshrine it at this point. The funniest tweet that I saw today was someone tweeting that the EF should just take Lido private at $10 a token and enshrine it that way. Of all the options on the table, I think that's probably the most realistic.
00:32:47.910 - 00:33:34.298, Speaker A: I like the way you phrase that. Maybe a more global comment on this. I think we've talked about this before, but I don't think this is if you view Ethereum as a credibly neutral platform for applications, I just don't think this sends the right message to developers. And I think, whether it was explicit or not, what Lido is doing, first of all, I think they're a best intentions team, and they're just doing what the incentives say to do. And they found a market which is winner take all or win or take most pretty naturally, and they're devoting an enormous amount of their incentives to decentralizing. This isn't a team that feels like they're acting in bad faith. And yeah, I disagree with the philosophy.
00:33:34.394 - 00:34:28.578, Speaker C: One of the kind of classic lines that I think in the 2010s was really prevalent in the startup world, especially with VCs. Was VCs really hammering entrepreneurs who are trying to raise money? And their big question was, well, why wouldn't Google just build this themselves? And I think that that sentiment is sort of kind of the same thing. If you open up the door for product or major features as opposed to minor protocol upgrades or products themselves versus minor protocol upgrades, you kind of put yourself in that same camp of Google in the ecosystem. Who sucks? Up all the oxygen and becomes the prohibitor of entrepreneurship and innovation because you want to have that stretch out to the edges is my opinion at least. And I hope we don't get into a situation like that.
00:34:28.664 - 00:35:05.920, Speaker B: I mean, how that ends is you just have to underwrite all of your friends and enemy relationships and figure out who's who and what happens when an L Two has, for a single day or two, more fees than ETH? Are they friends, are they enemies? Or should we reenshrine the L Two? Because that's kind of like the Dank Sharding roadmap is scalability on the L one. The L Two s kind of lose some of their relative speed, transaction, whatever advantage. I just don't think that's a road that vitalik is prepared to go down, because once you start going there, you need to go all the way. It just doesn't make sense not to.
00:35:06.290 - 00:36:00.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a philosophical thing here which is sort of I don't really think this is what this is, but it's more socialist communist than it is capitalist, I would say this viewpoint. And if you look at most communist regimes and countries, they run counter to human nature. So it requires this actor to sit in and actually be sort of a very authoritarian actor because there's a forcing function that is making everyone act in ways that are counter to their personal incentives. And I would just say I don't think this is the route that blockchains want to go down and you're already seeing it. It's cropping up. First of all, Gwart is there a better new account to crypto Twitter than Gwart in the last six months? I mean, they make me laugh all the time, but it's the beginnings of this pushback against this concept of ethereum alignment. And I think ethereum alignment is a great thing.
00:36:00.574 - 00:36:20.040, Speaker A: Ethereum has great values. I firmly believe it's all done in really good intentions, but at the same time, it's starting to feel a little Illuminati esque. It's like we don't have any transparent rules here. Like, what makes something ETH aligned versus not ETH aligned? Whenever that stuff's not transparent, I think it's not either.
00:36:20.730 - 00:37:01.746, Speaker B: I've been following people since Maker announced that they're going to do in five years like a SVM backend. People are like, man, ever since they announced the SVM and started tokenizing uranium, they've really lost their way. I don't even think they're aligned with it's. Like, what are you fucking talking? Like Rooney is like, the assets are going to stay on ETH. We're going to keep building there and we're funding all these EVM clients and that's just not good enough for some people. I think it's almost like the EF is now pandering to the Twitter outrage crowd, which is not good. They should not do that.
00:37:01.848 - 00:37:44.394, Speaker A: So I don't know everyone in the EF, the people that I've interacted with there, I think they are really technical and heads down. And I don't think this is the majority of how EF people feel, but I don't know the reason why. By the way, I think this is an important issue to push. And I did see someone tweet today that basically putting the onus on consumers. And consumers should be conscientious and value decentralization and should stake with a multitude of different LST providers, little LST providers. And it's like what that is like is like you should be like, you shouldn't bank with Morgan. You should be a conscientious banker and put your money in small community banks because of your values.
00:37:44.394 - 00:38:17.834, Speaker A: And it's like, no, you should put it with Morgan and bank of America and do the thing that's safest for you so you don't lose your money. And if we all decide as a society that there shouldn't know one or two big banks, then we should make a systems level change, but don't put it on the consumer. I think that's totally wrong and it will probably get people to lose money. That's the most likely outcome from a scenario like that go with low cap, untested, no network effect. LSTs I just think that's where that could be really damaging. And that is where I think that's super important to push back on.
00:38:18.032 - 00:38:23.770, Speaker B: Yes, you did lose all your money, but for a brief period of time you were fully aligned with the EF.
00:38:26.510 - 00:38:36.290, Speaker A: I wonder if this because again, I'm not trying to defend, but the people I know at the EF don't really think like this. I do wonder if it's this kind of thing where Twitter just run with it or something.
00:38:36.360 - 00:38:42.466, Speaker B: It's also know, I think of this as a very small, like a bear market thing.
00:38:42.648 - 00:38:44.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so too.
00:38:44.200 - 00:39:15.562, Speaker B: Even the bear everyone starts coming for each know at some point and mostly nothing happens. I've been through and Michael too, and you as well. You've seen so many metas come and uh I remember when WASM was going to be the thing. We were gonna write smart contracts in Python and JavaScript. Lost track of that one. Guess it didn't happen. If you don't like something on crypto, Twitter, just wait three days, it'll be gone, it'll disappear.
00:39:15.706 - 00:39:31.826, Speaker A: Actually, Jason and I, we did a little off site this week and we did like a super in depth history of the 2018 to 2020 through the current period. And we just relived some of these trends and you just see these things just come and go.
00:39:32.008 - 00:39:34.100, Speaker B: Totally. What were some funny ones?
00:39:34.790 - 00:39:38.454, Speaker A: Do you remember Malta as a place? As a thing?
00:39:38.652 - 00:39:39.110, Speaker B: Yes.
00:39:39.180 - 00:39:42.902, Speaker C: That was like the place post Asia that finance moved to.
00:39:43.036 - 00:39:59.242, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll actually get these headlines. We drew these headlines. It wasn't just like Cointelegraph. It was New York Times and Bloomberg and Forbes. The headlines were like new crypto hub. Yada yada. They actually had 8000 people at an event in the first year.
00:39:59.242 - 00:40:02.540, Speaker A: Like stuff like that. That was a pretty funny one.
00:40:03.410 - 00:40:06.910, Speaker C: I didn't know that that many people could fit on Malta either.
00:40:06.980 - 00:40:08.730, Speaker A: They launched their own cryptocurrency.
00:40:08.890 - 00:40:16.690, Speaker B: Remember that Mimble wimble the petrodollar? There's so many random ones, but oil backed stablecoins.
00:40:17.270 - 00:40:19.762, Speaker A: That was one that people were really pumped about.
00:40:19.816 - 00:40:23.310, Speaker B: Then oil went to negative three and now it's like, whoops.
00:40:23.470 - 00:41:24.662, Speaker A: One similarity I forgot to point out on the enshrinement debate is that's actually occurring over in Cosmos at the same time. So in Cosmoverse, which happened this week in Istanbul, stride announced a sort of proposal and wanted to get a temperature check on a potential acquisition of Stride by the hub. So they wouldn't necessarily call it enshrinement. That's not the word that they would use because they have this entity called the Hub over in Cosmos land. But it's kind of like the Hub has had this identity crisis where there isn't really a good monetary or economic model or just value prop baked out for the Hub. So this would kind of just to connect this with the Lido debate, there have been attempts over in cosmos land to solve some of the problems that ETH is experiencing with their liquid staking. So they introduced something called the liquid staking module, which makes the Hub aware of and able to regulate the liquid staking that's going on of at least atom or Staked atom, which is pretty cool.
00:41:24.662 - 00:42:34.646, Speaker A: And this is kind of like a trend further in that direction, where actually the Stride, which is the leading liquid staking provider over in Cosmos, would get absorbed into the Hub. So it's more functionality for the Hub, it's a clearer value proposition, but it also is more credible neutrality and decentralization for Stride as a liquid staking provider. So again, they don't call it enshrining it into the protocol, but it's the same premise they're doing it for the same sort of is, which is kind of cool. And what it makes me think is just to get back to this EA debate a little bit, because I really don't think the Ethereum alignment thing is a negative sounding thing, but they have a branding problem because it feels very Illuminati esque. But one of the big differences that I've always thought about between Cosmos and Ethereum is Cosmos does have token voting, which has a lot of drawbacks, but at least there's voting and governance there. ETH has no token voting and a lot of the governance of the protocol doesn't take place in a super transparent way or there's no formal structures. It is transparent.
00:42:34.646 - 00:42:57.358, Speaker A: There are dev calls and things like that, but there aren't formal structures. So I do wonder, as ETH enshrines more and more, if the solution is like, we don't want to deal with lido enshrine something like this, enshrine this Ekevm, eventually it's going to have to govern all this stuff. So if there's no formal governance mechanism, do you guys see that as being sort of a tension or I don't know. It's just a fundamental difference between Cosmos and ETH.
00:42:57.454 - 00:43:07.880, Speaker B: There is some sort of formal governance. Like the Stakers have the power at the end of the day. And so if this ever comes to pass in a very contentious way, which.
00:43:08.250 - 00:43:09.506, Speaker A: I do have a lot of respect.
00:43:09.538 - 00:43:49.202, Speaker B: For the EF, I don't think they're going to let it come to that then there will be some sort of voting, even if it's signaling. And I think that will be the start of a new type of governance process. Governance process. I don't think token voting is good for the big L ones. It introduces too much volatility at a stage where it's probably too mature. I think you can also say the same for going down the path of enshrining things like what if we had this debate on Bitcoin? It would be like a civil fucking war. And that's what ETH, when the chips are down, does well is it coordinates.
00:43:49.202 - 00:44:18.430, Speaker B: It actually has not like Illuminati, but the main people can get together and plot a path forward. And I expect that is going to be the case here. Maybe some changes on the margins, but you're trying to build the plane while you're flying it. And once you start going down the path of fixing things, you're a hammer and everything looks like a nail. So I would advise against it. It's cool to see it play out in smaller ecosystems, though. I think there is product market fit for that probably in a different way.
00:44:18.500 - 00:44:19.534, Speaker A: I tend to agree with that.
00:44:19.572 - 00:44:52.710, Speaker B: Let's talk about ETH futures. ETH futures launched this week. It was kind of like a sudden start. Like there was rumblings, I think, last Thursday that it was going to happen, and then Friday there was this hurry up offense that was run by the SEC to get everyone ready ahead of a potential government shutdown, which didn't end up happening. And they launched. And it was funny on the first day, everyone was like, oh, these are not like, what the fuck? There's only $2 million of first day volume for Van Eck. I think the things you need to understand are number one, these people were rushed out the door.
00:44:52.710 - 00:45:28.414, Speaker B: There was no month long heads up. It was creating demand on the first day. Number 250 percent of ETFs run at a loss. Like, there are so many ETFs, they're so hard to actually get any sort of volume for. This still made for a top ten ETF debut this year, even with the muted volume that it had on the first day. By day three and a half, I guess we're at right now, we're at like $42 million of volume across all of them. And this is the product that's going to have, probably in the next few months, hundreds of millions of dollars in it.
00:45:28.414 - 00:45:53.674, Speaker B: To me, that's a huge success. And I think the even bigger thing on the background is Ethereum is officially not a security. And you saw Brian Kent say that. You saw all these government people say that. But this seems to be the real lasting impact of regulatory clarity on the second largest crypto asset. So I just see I'm not going to name any names, but certain fund managers. I can see what they're doing.
00:45:53.674 - 00:46:06.778, Speaker B: They're trying to talk the price down or do different things. And I just think it's worth pointing out that there's a lot of context nuance and that this is actually a pretty successful start. Despite all the Twitter kind of chatter.
00:46:06.874 - 00:46:18.230, Speaker A: I think it got a bit of a bad rap because Biddo got more volume and it was getting compared to that, but totally different point in the cycle. I mean, that came out during the bull market, so not really a fair comparison.
00:46:18.810 - 00:46:21.974, Speaker B: Yeah, it came out of the actual top.
00:46:22.172 - 00:46:26.470, Speaker C: Wasn't it like October 21 or 22nd or something like that?
00:46:26.620 - 00:46:33.462, Speaker A: It was give or take one month from the absolute top. That indicator just remains undefeated. In terms of timing.
00:46:33.526 - 00:47:28.794, Speaker C: The one question I have is what is a direct I know that there's been some analysis on spot buying of assets, particularly Bitcoin. How does that have a price impact for every net dollar that's being bought. What does that do to the value of all of the market? And there was some leverage effect of like spot buying has I can't even remember what the number, but I want to say like five to seven x market impact in terms of what the purchase value is. I wonder what the e futures or any futures product does to the underlying spot value. I don't know if anybody's done that analysis. I would imagine it's a little bit more muted just because of the way these futures markets work. Eventually you have to get down into something that's spot because the futures will have to hedge at a certain point or someone will have to buy the asset at a certain point, but it's not a one to one.
00:47:28.794 - 00:48:17.740, Speaker C: And so I guess what I'm saying generally also I think yesterday or potentially the day before, former MD from BlackRock came out and said strong certainty that SEC is going to actually approve all of the spot bitcoin ETFs at the same time in the next three to six months. And mostly because they don't want to give anyone an unfair advantage. So you can imagine it's going to be a race if when that ever happens, in the same way that we're talking about which ETF is doing well, compare it different times, different places, but that race will be a really interesting one. I mean that just becomes a marketing game at that point. But if that goes through in the way that they suggest it will, very interesting.
00:48:20.190 - 00:48:51.718, Speaker B: It's so positive that we have that we have the like we have a really good setup in my mind. And I also like how Vanek has been playing the e future stuff where first day they tweeted out all caps, low volume, just like your JPEGs. They're in this for the long run. They're starting to do marketing and you have to think about what are their alternatives. You launch like the 500th ESG fund, you launch the 600th uranium ETF. This is new. It's exciting for them and they're in it for the long haul and that's what you want.
00:48:51.718 - 00:49:01.274, Speaker B: Access to these products is huge and their benefits are only going to be felt when the buyers really start to show up. And I think we have a setup that'll be favorable for that.
00:49:01.312 - 00:49:30.882, Speaker A: I tend to agree with that. Also, venk has been a real. They've been in it for a were. At least when I started paying attention, they were. I feel like maybe mostly a bitcoin shop back then, but when we helped create off the Chain, which became the Pump podcast later on, gabor Garbach was one of the early guys to come on the show. And I remember thinking like, oh, this is a TradFi guy, but he really knows his stuff about crypto. So props to Van AC.
00:49:30.936 - 00:49:37.318, Speaker B: I think Van AC is going to be a big player in know it'll take time, but I think they're doing it the right way.
00:49:37.404 - 00:50:04.634, Speaker A: XRP got another minor win as well this week. So the appeal that the SEC filed got struck down. So this is not necessarily a slam dunk win and the SEC still has the option to come back, but what it is is it's just kind of another strike against them. So I don't know what you guys made about that, but it actually seems like kind of big news that went slightly under the radar.
00:50:04.682 - 00:51:05.986, Speaker C: Not a lawyer, but I've listened to a lot of them talk about the situation. What the SEC did was they filed what's called, I think, an interlocutory appeal, which means we need to stop the process of this current case. We need to stay it until we can get resolution on the summary judgment that they just received. In particular, I believe having to do with primary sales being sales of securities, secondary transactions happening on exchange being non sales of securities, non SEC jurisdiction. And I believe the bar to get an interlocutory appeal is fairly high. And so yeah, the judge decided that the SEC did not meet that bar and denied the interlocutorial process. What this means, though is that the rest of the case, in particular the case against Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larson, need to follow through and continue forward.
00:51:05.986 - 00:52:17.346, Speaker C: And then once that is settled, the SEC can appeal or Ripple can also appeal, depending on what the judgment is in the rest of the case or anything that's happened so far in the case because Ripple didn't win all of the different things that they were alleging. So really what this means is that timelines now become a variable of interest estimates of maybe this case gets finished sometime in the April May 2024 timeline, which means that at that point you can have an appeal process begin, which pulls the entire process again for this entire case. And who knows how much they would want to appeal on, who knows how much they'd have to go back and relitigate. But it sort of starts the clock again for this entire case. And so that probably kicks the can down the road to a post 2024 timeline, which means that the summary judgments that exist so far are going to be kind of the state of perspective for the time being and probably for the next 18 months at least, connecting.
00:52:17.378 - 00:52:44.266, Speaker B: This back to kind of like what we see with entrepreneurs and what the sentiment is on the ground. In every bear market, it usually gets very unfashionable to launch tokens or even think about launching them. And we saw this in the 2018, 2019 bear market compound, was never going to launch a token. It was going to be an OTC desk. And then price action changed. There's a little bit of regulatory clarity. And then it was like, very much in the zeitgeist to launch tokens.
00:52:44.266 - 00:53:32.154, Speaker B: And it feels like we've almost come in that full circle in this bear market, too, where we met with a couple of entrepreneurs based in SF in New York. And they're like, yeah, I mean, optimism launched a token. We can figure out a, you know, the stakes are worth it for us, where we think this could be big enough, where we'll fight the charges, go to court, whatever. People are emboldened in a way that they haven't been in a while, but it's not kind of like the like it's not worth it for them. And like, the jig is up on creating vaporware and selling a token, but there's real entrepreneurs who are just no longer scared. And I think that's kind of the silver lining of it, where we need to see where US regulations go to tell where the space really goes in the US. Long term.
00:53:32.154 - 00:53:42.622, Speaker B: But until that happens, it feels like it's no longer a barrier. Whereas probably, certainly a year ago, people were too scared to really do anything that feels to have changed.
00:53:42.686 - 00:54:16.910, Speaker C: The ripple decision only applies to ripple. It doesn't apply specifically to anybody else. So this isn't a new framework that people can use, but it maybe shows directionality as to where courts at least are having their perspectives on these different types of matters. But goes back to the same thing that we've been saying for the last, I don't know how many months, new regulations are going to be the thing that creates the framework for which entrepreneurship can happen in the digital asset space in the US. That's it.
00:54:17.060 - 00:54:21.150, Speaker A: Did you guys see that Brad Garlinghouse got an XRP tattoo?
00:54:23.970 - 00:54:26.478, Speaker C: Yeah, that worked well for the last guy who got I was going to.
00:54:26.484 - 00:54:29.890, Speaker A: Say jinx of this magnitude we did not need.
00:54:29.960 - 00:54:32.786, Speaker B: Every lawyer we talked to told us that Ripple would not win or they.
00:54:32.808 - 00:54:34.914, Speaker C: Would win on certain things, but not this.
00:54:35.032 - 00:54:57.702, Speaker A: Oh, this was another speaking of Malta, but this is another flashback. I mean, back do you remember in 2018, 2019 period? First of all, lawyers used to talk a lot at our events, and they talked at a bunch of events, and it was like, the hammer of God is going to come down. These ICOs were getting away with murder. All these people are going to go to jail. Yada, yada. And in some sense, that was true. There were enforcement actions that were brought.
00:54:57.702 - 00:55:20.690, Speaker A: Most of them were just civil, and they ended up not being a gigantic deal in the meantime. So, I don't know, we feel a lot of questions like that from newer blockworks employees or people that are newer to the space. And it's like whenever someone's just aggressively shilling you, doom just maybe push back on it a little bit, especially lawyers. I've actually started to feel a little bit hopeful.
00:55:21.030 - 00:55:22.066, Speaker C: I don't know how much you guys.
00:55:22.088 - 00:55:59.838, Speaker A: Have been paying attention to what's going on over in the Macro for a little bit. But what's going on with the sell off in longer dated Treasuries? It depends on how you view bullish. That doesn't mean that stocks are going to go up. It's bad for stock prices soon. But what it indicates is that term premium are compressing. This is kind of the last thing that needed to happen before we could reset and the Fed could start cutting now. Probably what ends up happening is something might end up breaking before then, which would not be excellent, but we do need some sort of catalyst unless we just want extremely high rates for a long period of time.
00:55:59.838 - 00:56:05.694, Speaker A: But that's all kind of lining up with what we were talking about around the having and the bitcoin ETF.
00:56:05.742 - 00:56:46.382, Speaker C: I also listened to the OD Lots podcast this morning, listening to the Chicago Fed president basically say the only time we would revisit dropping rates is if unemployment or growth are going in the direction that doesn't bode well for the US. Economy. So I agree bear steepening, especially when you have an inverted yield curve. Very strange and tons of people have talked about this. The inversion has also dropped like 70% in the last few months. So the inversion is working its way through. I think we're probably going to see some interesting stuff in the bond market in the next couple of months.
00:56:46.382 - 00:57:35.470, Speaker C: What that does to other asset sectors remains to be know. Some of the things that we're seeing here in San Francisco and commercial real estate do not bode well for the rest of the economy. There's definitely some consternation. As an example, apparently there's effectively zero commercial real estate lending market right now. So everybody who has financing that's coming due on properties in San Francisco, which probably have a pretty sizable 30, 40, 50% markdown on the equity value, there's no market to be able to roll that loan. So it's tough and you're going to start to see that in sectors. But commercial real estate is sort of like a slow moving train wreck truly, because it's not market driven, it's not liquid, and it doesn't trade like any other markets.
00:57:35.470 - 00:57:42.510, Speaker C: There will be some market that probably hits the skids at some point. It's just where I think things are going to net out in the next few months.
00:57:42.580 - 00:58:14.774, Speaker B: Bonds are confusing to the lay person. I had a friend that owned I'm not going to name who it is, but he owns a bunch of bonds and he's like, hey, the yield is going up. I was like, not yours, somebody's. Just to explain briefly, the price goes down. That means the yield goes up because if you're holding a four and a half percent flavored tenure, there's a five out there now or close to it. Four, seven, five. And so that's the reason that the price drops.
00:58:14.774 - 00:58:42.190, Speaker B: But the way to think about bonds, you kind of need to think about them in two ways. One is backed by the. Full faith, credit, military, whatever regime of the US. They can always print more. It's very credit worthy, the safest asset in the world. It's also an asset where if you remove the fact that it's backed by all those things, it's 40% to 50% held in a meaningful sense by the Federal Reserve. They are not buying anymore.
00:58:42.190 - 00:59:16.110, Speaker B: In fact, they're starting to sell. And if that was an equity, if somebody owned 40% of an equity and was like, you know what, I'm not buying anymore. In fact, I'm going to start selling, you just wouldn't want to buy that stock. And the question is, you listen to CNBC, same shit every day, 2 hours of outrage that the tenure is going up. How could they do this to tech stocks? There's too many bonds. Who's going to buy them? And it's like hours and hours and hours of this stuff. And the answer is like, it's not going to be the private sector.
00:59:18.530 - 00:59:26.238, Speaker A: A small technical detail. They don't technically sell the bonds. They just let them mature and they roll off the balance sheet.
00:59:26.414 - 00:59:52.950, Speaker B: Which is also some, I guess, a readjustment of the definition of what QT is. The QT definition was supposed to be we just start selling bonds. I think if you tried to galaxy scalp all the bonds that they owned in the market, I don't know what would happen. But the bottom line is that they're just going to have to start buying these again. There is no version of the future where we are able to run two to $3 deficits per year and not buy our own bonds.
00:59:53.110 - 01:00:41.340, Speaker C: There's a forced buyer here, which is bank balance sheets, which obviously deposits aren't going massively up. In fact, they're kind of rolling off. There's also an element of pension funds that need to be buying these things just because they've got mandates to hit five, six, 7% yield. And they're willing to take the loss for the next two to three years if they can lock in 5.6% on the 30 or 4.6% on the 30 because they can lever it up and hit that five. I do think there's an element of we don't really know what's going to happen, but I don't see necessarily any other market that's as liquid that is going to potentially have issues just based off of all the wonky stuff that is happening.
01:00:41.340 - 01:00:47.130, Speaker C: If I was to pinpoint where something breaks, generally I think it's going to be in fixed income.
01:00:48.270 - 01:01:08.446, Speaker A: I don't know how you define break, but if you look at something like TLT, which is 20 years down, 40 plus percent, 50 plus percent, the index is 21 years old, it is almost flat. Now you've been getting fixed income that entire time, but in terms of price appreciation, it's basically down to flat.
01:01:08.558 - 01:01:46.314, Speaker B: The person who I outsource my thinking to on this is Joseph Wang, the Fed guy. You've had him and he's super smart and he's basically just been tweeting for the past two years. The pain trade is higher in yields. He just keeps tweeting this and they just keep going higher and now he's like, all right, we've run out of buyers. And it's been a lot of retail demand aping from bank account deposits to money market funds. Now the likelihood of something breaking is increasing, where I think it could be imminent. And I think yield curve control is the end game, which is a fancy version of like, they're going to have to buy these bonds.
01:01:46.314 - 01:02:19.230, Speaker B: Michael, to your point, the pension funds definitely can buy them, but the scale of selling on the treasury side is far larger than the scale of buying that can be provided by somebody like a pension fund. And so this time is not different. Like, the Fed will cut rates, they'll buy bonds, it'll be the whole thing again. It'll be under a new acronym, I'm sure. To confuse there. The financial math is only one way. And the spooky part, last part, spooky part is that the rates have been ripping as inflation and the signs of inflation has been decreasing.
01:02:19.230 - 01:02:42.346, Speaker B: And so what that tells me is it's not an inflation story that's driving this, it's a supply demand story. And that is probably we've never hit that invisible ceiling before, mostly because we haven't let ourselves because we've been buying the bonds. But now we're about to do some serious napkin math and probably realize what we've known the whole time, which is we just need to keep buying these things.
01:02:42.468 - 01:03:09.754, Speaker A: Make an argument that there's sort of soft yield curve control in place right now. The banks have this thing called the Btfp facility. So yield curve control is just you have a target for what you want to pay out in interest rates. The most crude way of doing that is just like we're infinite bid at x price, mostly. No one does that anymore. The bank of Japan is the only one that really does that. We did it back in the 40s.
01:03:09.754 - 01:03:26.298, Speaker A: But another sneakier way that you could do it is say, hey, big holders of bonds, don't worry, don't sell, we're going to let you like, here's a lending facility where you don't actually have to sell and you could get the full face value of your bond.
01:03:26.394 - 01:04:08.694, Speaker B: Totally. But all they're trying to do there it is, soft yield curve control. But all they're trying to do there is stop them from selling these bonds and stop from rising further, like they're trying to remove another seller from the market. But the math is they are still the biggest. It's like it's very easy to do on a napkin and tell that you need to be buying these things. One of the interesting things now that this is a macro pod is the UK rolled out their version of Btfp. Maybe it was a week ago or two weeks ago, but this is becoming, like, a standard operating procedure for most of these markets with a sovereign bond market where, okay, you're sitting on a huge loss.
01:04:08.694 - 01:04:39.074, Speaker B: We'll lend you money against it. And they're not just rolling it out for big banks, they're rolling it out for non banking, financial institutions, pension funds, potentially fintechs. Like anybody who's sitting on a loss can pledge it as collateral. Surely this will work 100% of the time and there will be no negative externalities. It literally is like the boat starts leaking, you plug it with your finger, and then you get your other hand, you put it on the other hole. The water is going to keep coming into the boat.
01:04:39.122 - 01:04:41.730, Speaker A: Well, there should be consequences to your actions.
01:04:41.810 - 01:04:50.890, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't want people to be without pensions and without the things that they need. I think it's very simple. They just need to start buying these bonds again.
01:04:50.960 - 01:05:28.920, Speaker C: Barr report on Silicon Valley Bank they saw interest rates rising. They knew they were sitting on all this fixed income. They knew that interest rates rising would drop the value of the fixed income. They decided, and they're freely welcome to hedge their fixed income risk by buying interest rate swaps. They decided that the Fed wasn't going to be able to or have the gumption to raise rates as high as they have now and that they weren't going to buy the full swaps because they thought they'd be able to make more profit because swaps obviously cost a ton of money.
01:05:29.770 - 01:05:30.818, Speaker A: It's hubris.
01:05:30.914 - 01:05:39.234, Speaker C: It's short termism. There will be more examples like that. But ultimately that was the death nail for Silicon Valley Bank.
01:05:39.282 - 01:05:43.650, Speaker A: All right, guys. Well, I guess we can wrap it here this weekend, fellas.
