00:00:23.962 - 00:00:41.898, Speaker B: Alright, everyone, this episode brought to you by our friends at Avalanche. They are the layer one blockchain that is fast, stable and scalable. You're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. For now, let's get into it. All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. You got Michael's one and two. Vance and Thomas, welcome back to the show.
00:00:41.898 - 00:00:46.618, Speaker B: What up, SUP SUP black Hoodie gang this week.
00:00:46.704 - 00:00:51.360, Speaker A: You think Vance and Michael are on their game this week? You guys were off last week.
00:00:52.690 - 00:00:54.542, Speaker C: Michael couldn't even get his internet working.
00:00:54.676 - 00:00:56.910, Speaker D: Yeah, technically.
00:00:57.650 - 00:00:59.200, Speaker A: Vance, you really wanted to speak.
00:01:01.650 - 00:01:02.880, Speaker C: Last week either.
00:01:04.690 - 00:01:07.338, Speaker D: I mean, the good news is there's nowhere to go but up from here.
00:01:07.364 - 00:01:08.626, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:08.808 - 00:01:10.002, Speaker C: The bottom is the thing.
00:01:10.056 - 00:01:18.118, Speaker B: You guys actually let Yano and I get away with murder last week because we were wearing matching shirts the entire broadcast. You guys didn't say a single thing. We were like, there's no way they.
00:01:18.124 - 00:01:18.854, Speaker D: Don'T call that out.
00:01:18.892 - 00:01:20.600, Speaker A: But we got away with that.
00:01:21.370 - 00:01:23.138, Speaker C: Are there more co founders of Blockworks.
00:01:23.154 - 00:01:24.680, Speaker A: Or is it just you two?
00:01:27.050 - 00:01:30.570, Speaker B: There's just two of us, but there was a third.
00:01:30.640 - 00:01:33.306, Speaker D: Yeah, there was.
00:01:33.488 - 00:01:34.458, Speaker A: Little known story.
00:01:34.544 - 00:01:37.820, Speaker B: Little known, yeah. Getting to some blockworks lore here. Yeah.
00:01:39.070 - 00:01:41.450, Speaker D: Sometimes the best addition is subtraction.
00:01:42.750 - 00:01:45.280, Speaker B: If you're listening to this, budy, we love you.
00:01:45.730 - 00:01:50.122, Speaker A: I actually talked to him last night and I know that he does listen, so we love you, buddy.
00:01:50.266 - 00:01:51.710, Speaker B: We love you, brother.
00:01:54.770 - 00:01:59.902, Speaker A: Oh, you know, we were going to talk about that. We didn't talk about last time was Michael and Vance's co founder Dynamics.
00:02:00.046 - 00:02:09.926, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. But let's, let's, let's we got to give people something to look forward to. So let's wait till the end to get into know you also have a.
00:02:09.948 - 00:02:15.800, Speaker A: Surprise, right, for us this week. Shut up. No.
00:02:16.730 - 00:02:19.078, Speaker B: All right, let's get into it here.
00:02:19.164 - 00:02:19.638, Speaker A: All right.
00:02:19.724 - 00:02:20.678, Speaker B: We got a bunch of stories I.
00:02:20.684 - 00:02:21.146, Speaker A: Want to talk about.
00:02:21.168 - 00:03:03.766, Speaker B: Binance's proof of reserves. So Binance released, they tweeted out that they were going to have a proof of reserves system fully in effect. And there was a little bit of pushback that came back from Jesse Powell who's the founder of Kraken. So Jesse had kind of gone on record earlier and said, hey, I'm going to be better about calling things out when I don't necessarily agree with him. So he tweeted out some problems to point out and a couple of the things that he pointed out were, one, there was BBTC and BTCB that was being used interchangeably with BTC. Those aren't necessarily the same thing that's BTC on the Binance smart chain. And then there's wrapped bitcoin on ETH basically.
00:03:03.766 - 00:03:45.278, Speaker B: And Binance is the issuer of both of those wrapped tokens. So those shouldn't necessarily be equated one to one. There's a risk on the part of the issuer there. The other thing is there were negative account balances. So the way spot margin sort of works is when you're taking out a margin position at an exchange, you put up a tiny bit of collateral and then basically you are trading with more assets than you actually have. And the way that works from an accounting standpoint is it's a negative balance for you because the exchange has loaned you money which shows up as a positive asset for them. So there are like a whole bunch of different sorts of problems with the and Nick Carter, who's he said he's not the expert on this, but he does talk about it quite a bit and he's very knowledgeable.
00:03:45.278 - 00:03:56.962, Speaker B: I probably call him an expert, to be honest. Has pointed out that he saw some problems with it as well, though he has yet to respond with the piece. Do you guys have any take or particular thought on the proof of reserves?
00:03:57.026 - 00:04:42.338, Speaker C: I mean, looking through a couple of these things, the reserves is just like one half of the equation. Most of the trouble that these exchanges seem to get in is like taking coins, staking them, making them illiquid, taking on loans, lending out collateral to other parties. I guess this does prove that there is an aggregate large amount of customer deposits in the system. It doesn't show you exactly what they're being used for, what they're pledged against the negative balances aren't alarming if you have any sort of margin trading. Like that's how it works. There's a big pool of assets and then some people have negative balances and that you're hoping that your auto liquidation mechanism basically nets them out before they go truly underwater on a negative basis. But it's a very basic form of proof of reserve.
00:04:42.338 - 00:05:19.134, Speaker C: It's also audited by some auditor that I've never really heard of. I think it's a step in the right direction, but it doesn't give us any confidence to go put a bunch of money on Binance. I also think generally this is not part of this story, but where we kind of see things going are like people that are in DeFi chasing long tail coins, doing things like that on chain and then people that are in regulated venues. At least if you're like a US. Presence. Like everything in between, where you're taking counterparty risks, where you don't know what the balance of liabilities and reserves are. That's kind of like out of consideration for the US based funds.
00:05:19.134 - 00:05:29.890, Speaker C: So maybe that's a standard that's okay for the Asian funds or the more international ones. But I don't know, I just don't see us getting there anytime soon in terms of putting meaningful assets on that exchange.
00:05:29.970 - 00:06:43.820, Speaker D: Yeah, only thing I'd add is just like to reiterate, this is half of the equation, right? Accounting is assets plus liabilities equals shareholders equity. What we have right now is assets. We don't have any idea of what the liabilities are. If we could get a sense of equivalently what the proof of reserves are for the user deposits and then be able to see if there is any mismatch of what the assets are versus what the user deposits are, that would be an even further step in the right direction of being able to say, okay, is there an asset liability mismatch? One of the things that we've spent some time going through is with all the details of all the six or five or six concurrent bankruptcies going on, some of the details that are coming out of what was happening in those situations is pretty damning and also crazy. But one of the largest takeaways is there's just a massive asset liability mismatch. And if that's something that's going on underneath the hood, a, proof of reserves wouldn't be able to tell you that, but B, that's really what needs to be figured out. It doesn't matter whether or not you have 100 and 5200 billion dollars of assets on the chain or on the platform, if you have greater liabilities or frankly, even just a mismatch of what those liabilities are.
00:06:44.910 - 00:07:21.478, Speaker B: So it might actually be worth just giving a little bit of credit to two of the exchanges that are actually sort of pioneering proof of liabilities. So to your point, Michael, what we saw basically after the aftermath of FTX and all these exchanges came out and said, we're going to do proof of reserves. They were only doing proof of assets. They were just pointing to a wallet that had a certain amount of bitcoin. That's completely useless because you don't know what the liabilities that correspond to that asset were. But actually, I think it was BitMEX that pioneered this idea of proof of liabilities. And it is kind of cool because it's something that you can only really do on a crypto exchange.
00:07:21.478 - 00:08:33.310, Speaker B: So basically what you want to know is to your point, you want your assets to match your liabilities. In this case, you want the amount of bitcoin that you have to equal the amount of customer deposits, right? Let's assume it's just bitcoin here. So what you can do basically is the approach that BitMEX pioneered was you could basically do a full list of liabilities within a merkel tree structure. So all the liabilities are at the top, but the rest of each individual customer is arranged as a leaf in that merkel tree and then you as a customer are given enough information to basically test to see, is my personal account included in that top number list of liabilities. So obviously not everyone's going to test, but doing some generalized testing ability, that's pretty cool. The limitations of that are just because your deposits are in a wallet balance that match the assets of the exchange doesn't mean that they haven't pledged that as collateral in an off chain sort of transaction. So there are limits to proof of reserves and proof of liabilities, but it's a step in the right direction and it didn't seem like binance.
00:08:33.310 - 00:08:36.974, Speaker B: They've got a little ways to I.
00:08:37.012 - 00:09:14.186, Speaker D: Mean, not only that, there's a solvency issue, which is if you don't have enough assets to make up for the actual liabilities, there's also an ill liquidity issue. So if you have a bunch of ETH on a platform, but they've taken that ETH and they've staked it, and this is pre Shanghai, you can't get that ETH back. It's not ETH, it's some other asset that is staked and illiquid. So there are two types of issues that you can run into. And yeah, I think this is once again half of the equation, but it's really, frankly, not even the half that matters.
00:09:14.298 - 00:09:47.786, Speaker C: The other stuff. I think the last point is if you have a scenario where there's a lot of volatile price action and somebody makes bank on that, you can bankrupt an exchange. Especially if you're able to trade 20 X plus leverage like you are on finance. If there is a substantial move and say, somebody nets a huge windfall from something like Shorting, UST or Luna, that can easily absorb all of the existing assets that you have in the system. And so it's not just your current liabilities, it's like your future expected liabilities. If this volatile price action plays out based on the open interest that's on.
00:09:47.808 - 00:11:00.640, Speaker D: Your exchange, So just taking this thread a little bit further, one piece of news that did come out, and I can't remember which situation it was relating to, but there's actually been a couple of court decisions in the last week as to who owns these assets. And one of the biggest issues I think that most consumers had with whether it was BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, probably Binance as well, is nobody actually read the terms and conditions. And in some of these instances, literally, the terms and conditions state that when you give your assets to the platform, these are now platform assets. These are assets that the platform owns and has authority to do whatever they want to do with them. And so if you're taking your ETH and you're putting it into a platform, and they're taking that ETH and they're staking it, or they're converting it to bitcoin, or they're converting it to dollars, and you still have that ETH liability. It's totally fair for them in the terms and conditions in certain situations for them to go off and do whatever they want with it. Effectively, you're pledging these assets to a crypto hedge fund who's going off and doing whatever they want to do with them.
00:11:00.640 - 00:11:31.820, Speaker D: And one of the things that is being discussed right now and being decided right now is who actually has authority over these assets. Let's say in the case that there's a bankruptcy or an ill solvent situation. So I generally think all of this stuff is going to get worked out now, but one variable here is people need to read the terms and conditions for these user accounts because they have very strong implications as to who has authority of these assets over the long run.
00:11:33.310 - 00:11:59.886, Speaker B: The other thing about Rehypothecation did a podcast with Ben Hunt who was explaining this. When you give your assets to a third party, let's say an exchange in this instance, and then they go pledge that as collateral. The way the claims will play out is ultimately whoever they pledge that collateral to will have a senior claim to you as the depositor. So that feels crazy unfair, but that's how it works. That's why you got to be super careful.
00:12:00.078 - 00:12:02.420, Speaker D: That's exactly the situation I'm talking about.
00:12:03.270 - 00:12:43.230, Speaker C: Think about the situation with BlockFi suing SBF personally to get his Robin Hood holdings. BlockFi is a secured creditor. All of the people that are deposited in FTX are unsecured creditors to that claim. And so BlockFi gets paid back first, and then I guess the creditors will need to go sue BlockFi like the FTX creditors will need to sue BlockFi and the BlockFi creditors to get those assets put into line to get distributed. FTX, it's just like this Russian doll of creditorship that's just a mess. But unfortunately, it looks like most of the unsecured creditors, aka the depositors, are generally last in line for a lot of these things.
00:12:43.380 - 00:13:22.490, Speaker B: Yeah, and I just think the reason why this stuff is important right now is what's happened with FTX is a negative situation. There is a silver lining if we can do things better than we did before FTX, so getting things like proof of reserves right is sort of the bare minimum that we can do. I'm kind of of the mind that we'll always have some centralized exchanges. There'll always be a subset of people that wants the convenience instead of owning and managing your own keys. But there are ways that you can mitigate some of the risk of surrendering those keys to someone. So, I don't know, I think finance, if they want to get like a perfect scorecard on this, get a big four. I don't know who Mazda, I looked it up, they have 42,000 employees.
00:13:23.710 - 00:13:24.278, Speaker A: I know them.
00:13:24.304 - 00:13:48.238, Speaker B: Yeah, they're pretty big, but they're not a big four in terms of the I think you need that. And then there needs to be proof that you actually have the keys right, and that you control the private keys to the wallets. And then you can't include negative account balances in there that messes up the whole calculation. So they're a minor, like we're on the right track, but those are the things that they need for a perfect scorecard, basically, yes.
00:13:48.344 - 00:14:16.190, Speaker D: I mean also just like to say this, this is what we do every single year as a fund. We from our auditors have to receive some amount that we have to send from all the different wallets that we have and they run a test to make sure that we have access to them. And this is just like par for the course for the industry. And so I think they're not too far off to your point, Mike. They can do this. It's just a matter of figuring out what the most reliable process will be to get both sides of the equation.
00:14:23.310 - 00:15:14.130, Speaker A: Yes. It biggest takeaway is that even though they hired some good people on the venture, like good resumes maybe I had talked to a lot of VCs who were like, yeah, FTX seems to have this good strategy on the venture side. Like a year ago, at least some VCs maybe. No, you guys were saying that and it's just looking at this portfolio, they were even more clueless than about running an exchange. They were punting into not even crypto company, like weird fintechs and real estate deals. It wasn't even crypto companies. I think if you sent them a pitch, they were just going to say yes, that's what it looked like.
00:15:14.820 - 00:15:51.992, Speaker C: I think a couple of things. Number one, they were known to set the floor of the Aptos and Sui private deal valuations. They wouldn't let anything clear. That was like a legit aptos suite product for less than 100 million for seed, and the same with Solana. And so they were kind of backstopping that implicitly or explicitly. I think my favorite investment that they made, do you remember when they did stocks for like four months last year? Or like six months? But it was also through that weird sketchy Swiss brokerage. You had to be like, I forget if it was like European or like KYC with the German subsidiary of the Swiss.
00:15:51.992 - 00:16:19.424, Speaker C: And then you look at their venture sheet and they put $320,000,000 into Digital Assets AG, which is the broker that allowed them to run this stock experiment. And so I don't know what they were thinking, but maybe it was like, we want to do stocks. All right, how much does it cost? 320,000,000. Okay, cool. Invest in that company, get them to do it. And then it basically just went nowhere. And I think that was kind of very symbolic of the intellectual rigor and diligence they were doing and the level of investment strategy that they had.
00:16:19.424 - 00:16:24.196, Speaker C: But there's a lot of just really funny looking ones on that sheet generally.
00:16:24.308 - 00:17:16.676, Speaker D: I mean, one of the largest takeaways of my reading of this is just how large this sheet is. Think about it. Alameda, FTX, all of the different venture investments probably started in earnest in 2020. I don't think they had the capital to really do it in 2019. So we're talking about less than two years a year and a half and they've done over 400 investments. There's just no possible way that there's any sort of rigor, strategy, or diligence that can be done if you're doing that many deals in that short of a period of time, especially to this size. The other takeaway that I have is, while you could probably discount basically everything with a 50% haircut, maybe even a lot of these with like an 80% to 90% haircut, I still think that there is some value in some of these investments, and there could be actual value in some of these investments.
00:17:16.676 - 00:17:31.676, Speaker D: And I think we talked about this on a previous pod, but there was some bankruptcy proceeding that happened, I think you were talking about it, where part of the creditors got the portfolio of venture investments that ultimately ended up making everybody essentially whole.
00:17:31.778 - 00:17:35.520, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Yes. On Empire.
00:17:36.340 - 00:17:54.896, Speaker D: Yeah. I can't remember which example that was, but there actually is some residual value here for FTX claims. I think it's unclear as to how much and when that'll happen, but there will be some value that you can probably assume from this. Most of these are going to zero, but some of them I think will be valuable.
00:17:55.008 - 00:18:01.780, Speaker C: Do you have the sheet or the FTE? Can we throw that up here? I just want to see what the biggest ones were again.
00:18:01.850 - 00:18:03.450, Speaker A: Yeah. Here, I can share it.
00:18:04.380 - 00:18:23.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to say I think there are a couple of angles on this, but I personally think there are a couple of very big checks to some very small names. And I would be very curious to see once you dug into who were associated with okay, ready here's that there is a 500 million dollar check. Sorry, 300 million dollar check.
00:18:23.830 - 00:18:24.304, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:24.422 - 00:18:27.250, Speaker B: Written to K five.
00:18:27.620 - 00:18:28.370, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:28.740 - 00:18:29.840, Speaker A: I looked it up.
00:18:29.990 - 00:18:34.210, Speaker D: Do you know what? K five. I couldn't find anything relevant on K Five.
00:18:34.740 - 00:18:46.630, Speaker B: Yeah, so I got something here. It's like a six person venture team with no companies that I've ever heard invested. I'm not 100% sure.
00:18:47.640 - 00:18:50.824, Speaker D: The other one was Modulo capital, I think.
00:18:50.942 - 00:19:05.928, Speaker C: So that is FTX. That is alameda. It was registered at the exact apartment that Albany Towers that FTF was living. I've what I've heard that.
00:19:06.014 - 00:19:15.500, Speaker B: And maybe they just found another great entrepreneur based out of Albany in the same apartment complex and it was like, what a happy coincidence. Yeah, it was ran into the hallways.
00:19:15.580 - 00:19:16.256, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:16.438 - 00:20:04.248, Speaker C: If you look at the date that Modulo was registered, it was registered basically a day before Luna collapsed. What the scuttlebutt is on Twitter at least, is that this was a way for Alameda to hopefully shield the remaining cash that they had right after this big blow up. Like, obviously that's basically fraud and or money laundering. That's for the courts to decide. The other one that I think is a funny big investment that he made is the half a yard that he put into Anthropic, and that is a plant grown meat startup. So like an impossible foods competitor. And you think about the things that could potentially make customers whole on like a 20 year basis if you get really lucky.
00:20:04.248 - 00:20:11.680, Speaker C: And one of these things returns. I think Anthropic, or whatever it is, is probably the most real investment at size that they have.
00:20:11.830 - 00:20:30.004, Speaker D: No, the real investments are, I think, the venture funds. I mean, they put a couple hundred million into Sequoia Paradigm. I think there are a number of other, like, ultimater, I think was on there. There's some real investments, like putting half a yard into some vegan meat company.
00:20:30.122 - 00:20:38.250, Speaker A: No, it's not a vegan meat company. It's an AI research firm. It was the skype. It was the guy who founded Skype created it or something like that.
00:20:38.700 - 00:21:02.208, Speaker D: But taking potshots with that much capital at single companies, I think that's going to be harder to return the funds themselves. I don't know if the capital has been called or what the deal is, or if those are just like commitments or if those are actual investments, but I would imagine that the funds can have some residual value. That's what I was referring to when I said there was some residual value here.
00:21:02.374 - 00:21:15.264, Speaker B: What about this gigantic investment in Genesis Mining? Has anyone dug into that? What is good with that? That was like is a yard a billion? That was a full yard.
00:21:15.392 - 00:21:16.292, Speaker C: Did I do that right?
00:21:16.346 - 00:21:27.208, Speaker B: Yeah, that was nice. Did I get that one? Yeah, but that was a big one and I haven't really heard anyone dig into that. But that struck me as a very weird bet.
00:21:27.374 - 00:21:59.220, Speaker C: The interest between these entities is just bizarre. Bizarre. FTX Alameda was an investor in Genesis. Genesis lent to Three Arrows. Three Arrows owes BlockFi money. Three Arrows also owed Voyager money, who was bought by, like you kind of get this idea that the money was moving in a circle and there were some fees or whatever being stripped off as consideration in between. But this looks very circular.
00:22:00.440 - 00:22:13.000, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. Here's a good one. Actually, there was a small one. There's a $25 investment in a $25 million investment, something called Toy Ventures.
00:22:13.340 - 00:22:13.944, Speaker A: Oh, God.
00:22:13.982 - 00:22:18.170, Speaker B: And I'm going to ask you a question. Does the name Ramnick Aurora mean anything?
00:22:19.180 - 00:22:19.930, Speaker C: Yes.
00:22:22.060 - 00:22:23.684, Speaker A: Big shout out to Matt Walsh.
00:22:23.812 - 00:23:16.670, Speaker B: To Matt Walsh from GasLi Island Ventures who has a great, like, two minute rant on this. But Ramneck Aurora was a relatively high up member at FTX, but he was the head of product, head of investor relations, and he ran corp dev. So the implication there being if you're the head of product, shouldn't you kind of know if there was a backdoor that's in the middle of your product? If you're heading up investor relations, shouldn't you know how SBF has the ability to stake $500 million to buy invest in vegan meat companies or AI or whatever? If he's the head of Corp. He was sort of the key man. And he also got a $25 million donation to his venture fund. So maybe some answers from old Ram Nico that we might demand here.
00:23:17.280 - 00:23:23.212, Speaker D: Creditors are going to call that back. Congratulations. You had it temporarily, but that's coming back.
00:23:23.346 - 00:23:39.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there were a lot of them. This was also Matt calling this out. He's like Rockbird LLC raised 10 million from VCs. Most VC backed companies aren't LLCs. Like 15 million into lonely road. Lonely Road is not a real company. There were a bunch of these.
00:23:40.920 - 00:23:56.024, Speaker C: No. Really? No. I think the net of this and this kind of like dovetails into, I think, which is a larger discussion is oh, my God.
00:23:56.062 - 00:23:59.320, Speaker A: This is the website for K Five ventures. Oh, God, yes.
00:23:59.390 - 00:24:00.216, Speaker C: Let's see it.
00:24:00.318 - 00:24:01.320, Speaker D: Pull it up.
00:24:01.470 - 00:24:04.956, Speaker B: Yeah, that's why I was like, how.
00:24:04.978 - 00:24:06.750, Speaker C: Much money did they put into this again?
00:24:07.920 - 00:24:09.710, Speaker A: 300 million.
00:24:10.240 - 00:24:10.700, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:10.770 - 00:24:13.180, Speaker A: Get ready to impact the world, baby.
00:24:14.100 - 00:24:20.416, Speaker B: Investment strategy. Go to market. Focus. Boom. Sign me up, baby. That is putting me over the finish line.
00:24:20.518 - 00:24:25.264, Speaker D: Yeah. Hit their portfolio. Can you name a single?
00:24:25.462 - 00:24:26.930, Speaker A: These are not real companies.
00:24:27.400 - 00:24:32.480, Speaker C: Engineero is compass. Put money in the compass.
00:24:32.560 - 00:24:33.952, Speaker D: I don't think that's the same Compass.
00:24:34.016 - 00:24:34.790, Speaker A: It might.
00:24:35.720 - 00:24:37.344, Speaker C: Oh, that's compass mining.
00:24:37.472 - 00:24:38.150, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:39.480 - 00:24:43.000, Speaker C: This doesn't really look like a fund that you'd put, like, $300 million into.
00:24:43.070 - 00:24:44.900, Speaker A: I mean, they can't even find what is Coin?
00:24:45.060 - 00:24:46.840, Speaker B: There's a company called Coin.
00:24:49.740 - 00:24:58.696, Speaker A: Cannot be reached for people who are not watching along. God. Great. Yeah, that's pretty cringe.
00:24:58.888 - 00:25:37.640, Speaker C: So I think the point that I would like to get to on all of this is say that the whole is like at least 10 billion. It's probably bigger than that if you think about all of the mismatches and all of just generally the user deposit liabilities that they cannot cover. And if you assume that the 10 billion was made up of pro rada crypto assets. So, like, Bitcoin was probably like 40%, 4 billion. Of the 10 billion, maybe ETH was like another three or 4 billion of the 10 billion. Maybe like a portion was stablecoins. A portion was like long tail alts.
00:25:37.640 - 00:26:18.928, Speaker C: If you think about the price action of last year, really what was happening was they were taking this ETH, this Bitcoin, the stablecoins, they were selling the ETH and the Bitcoin, they were buying salona, they were buying FTT, they were buying serum. And even if you look at the price action this year, there were these weird levels. Like $30 of Sol, $22 for FTT, where most mornings I would wake up and I would just try to check where sol and FTT was to see what type of day it was going to be. And there was just like this concrete floor that they would bounce off of. It would never let it drop below that. But if you're looking at the price action of the last year, and a lot of the narratives and the themes and just the ideas that were powerful. It was kind of all this, like, Alt l One wave.
00:26:18.928 - 00:26:55.532, Speaker C: And the Alt l One wave, in my opinion, was fueled by people looking at salana that was pumped to, like, 200, $250 fraudulently, I believe, by SPF selling Ethereum and Bitcoin artificially short these assets to pump salana. And then everyone else said, okay, cool. Salana can be worth more than 100 billion. So can Luna. AVAX can run like, BNB Matic can run. And there was this idea that maybe you could actually create a legitimate competitor as money. And on the scale of money's opportunity as Ethereum and Bitcoin, I think without that in the equation, the market looks much differently.
00:26:55.532 - 00:27:41.490, Speaker C: There's potentially 10 billion less of selling pressure. So, like, another EIP 1559 less of selling pressure for Ethereum. Same probably with Bitcoin, but on the tail side, like these Alt l ones, that narrative and that idea is fundamentally broken. In my opinion. That was all reliant on basically the biding of a fraud, which hopefully next time is not going to be there. And I think that's the main takeaway for me is if you're looking at the last year of price action or the last two years as a guide to where things can go, you're probably entirely yeah, it's just going to be really interesting to see the relative strength out of this. I think the people who believe that Salon is going to go right back to where it like you're basically betting on another SBF coming along and doing the same.
00:27:42.580 - 00:27:56.416, Speaker D: So to play this out and understand this as a theory, but know, we'll see whether or mean that is complete fraudulent action taken by the FTX and Alameda teams.
00:27:56.528 - 00:27:57.092, Speaker A: Correct.
00:27:57.226 - 00:28:15.628, Speaker D: Like, there's no way to say that. That is not you can't say that. Oh, it was a margin account that got away from me and like, oh, I misplaced some bank accounts. It's like, no, that is legitimate fraud if you're taking customer deposits, selling the assets that they have, and using that to buy other assets. Right. Am I missing something?
00:28:15.714 - 00:28:35.116, Speaker B: I think that's what we've been saying for the last month. Yeah, I'm in agreement if he's done that. Yeah, I agree with you. Just out of curiosity, what's the rationale for him wanting to pump Solana? Is it just that there's such a heavy correlation between Solana and all the stuff that's built on salana? Is that why there's the need to support that price instead of just FTT?
00:28:35.308 - 00:29:29.184, Speaker C: It looks like SPF personally owned around 10% of salana, and so he was taking ETH and Bitcoin selling it, or just taking Stablecoins, buying his own coins, which he could then use his locked salana to sit on as collateral and hedge out via Perp, and he gets US dollars back in his account. And then the price action of salana is something like, I have never. Ever seen, not even 2017. Ethereum really matched that level of like, oh, it went from twenty cents to two hundred and fifty dollars in six months. And I think there was this idea that there was this new paradigm and these things could trade as money and it would just be like off to the races. But that idea is seriously damaged in my opinion. I think next cycle the alt L ones are not going to be the main drivers of the narrative.
00:29:29.184 - 00:29:47.188, Speaker C: It's going to have to be applications with utility, decentralized Staking protocols, decentralized finance protocols, decentralized games. That kind of has to be where it goes, in my opinion. This narrative is just no longer workable. If you think that this was actually a fraud, which the math would dictate.
00:29:47.284 - 00:30:00.220, Speaker D: That it probably was so then play this forward. What happens to the alt L ones that haven't launched yet or are just barely launched and are trying to run a similar playbook?
00:30:01.920 - 00:30:37.464, Speaker C: The things that I think are really interesting are looking I basically chart everything against ETH in my own mind and am mostly Ethnominated. When I think about our portfolio. If you look at any of the alts since about the beginning of May, beginning of June, it's basically been down only versus Ethereum. And the same thing, curiously with Bitcoin, I think Bitcoin is a different issue. It's mostly just like there's too many miners. But you look at ETH, it did not make a lower low, it made a higher low. You look at all the alts, they basically all made lower lows except for a handful, and Bitcoin made a lower low as well.
00:30:37.464 - 00:31:05.170, Speaker C: And so I think that's telling you something very specific about how much Ethereum was deposited into FTX last year, how much was sold to buy these other coins and what the scale of the whole was. But I think you have a couple of tailwinds, you have EIP 1559, which takes a lot of selling out of the equation, and you just have the absence of SBF selling Ethereum as well. And those two things in my mind are why ETH is relatively outperforming at the moment.
00:31:06.660 - 00:31:36.600, Speaker B: You might be right there. I don't have any special insight, but it makes a lot of sense to me that he would do that. Frankly, I think where I might push back a little bit and just I don't know. I think there was someone said this a little while ago, but it stuck with me. It's like a lot of people lost a lot of money trying to find the next Amazon when maybe the thing to do is just actually buy Amazon at whatever price it was trading at. So I think that there will basically always be people who are looking for the next X thing. Even if it does just make sense to go into ETH.
00:31:36.600 - 00:32:03.460, Speaker B: Then I think there will always be some market, because if I was putting my investor hat on for a second. The point that you made about if you denominate everything in ETH, then basically everything's a money loser, including the DApps that are built on the ETH ecosystem. And that, I think, eventually has to change. Otherwise there's no reason for anyone to buy or invest in or use any of those things because I would just want to buy ETH. Because that's going to outperform.
00:32:04.520 - 00:32:30.216, Speaker D: To be clear, even if Framework was denominated in ETH and we're not, we're denominated in dollars, technically we have done very well in relation to ETH. So there are opportunities to invest in things that do better than ETH. But I think to Vance's point, it's more about the Alt L ones, where you're competing on the same plane, the same market, which is what's the base layer and what's essentially the operating system for these applications.
00:32:30.408 - 00:32:43.404, Speaker C: Keep in mind, all of the Alt L one pumps, for lack of a better word, were mentally based on this framework of Salana going up first. Because if you think about it, it was Solana first, then it was Luna AVAX, and then it was Foam.
00:32:43.452 - 00:32:43.664, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:43.702 - 00:32:54.388, Speaker C: Or phone phantom. The acronyms so absurd last year, I can't even remember them. Near was part of it. But all of those Martin Galengo, there.
00:32:54.394 - 00:32:56.004, Speaker B: Was a flamingo or something at one point.
00:32:56.042 - 00:32:56.388, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:56.474 - 00:33:25.496, Speaker C: No phantom. Phantom. But all of those Martin Gale pumps off of the mental framework of like, Salana is going up. We can get a part of this as well. I think the next cycle you're not going to have that Salana outperformance that leads everyone to be like, all L ones are where we need to go. I think you're going to have more organic price action around things that are generating fees and generating traction, and people are going to be hopefully a little bit more mature and buy things that are early on the application layer versus these massive All L ones that are just like, fraudulently inflated.
00:33:25.608 - 00:33:36.368, Speaker B: All right, everyone, quick break from this episode to talk about our show sponsors, Avalanche. Many of you know Avalanche as the fast, reliable and scalable layer one. The folks at Avalanche have a really great message for those of you who.
00:33:36.374 - 00:33:37.664, Speaker A: Are in the crypto industry right now.
00:33:37.702 - 00:33:51.952, Speaker B: Which is bear markets are for building. So while a bunch of our friends over in CFI are kind of going through these struggles and travails, the folks at Avalanche have basically put their heads down and are shipping products that builders want. The latest solution. Elastic subnets.
00:33:52.016 - 00:34:04.284, Speaker A: Right. And just to expand on that, avalanche is consistently upgrading all of their platforms. Right. So on the platform side, you've got Elastic Subnets, you've got new VMs. On the infrastructure side of things, you've got Core, which Mike, I know you used that the other day.
00:34:04.322 - 00:34:05.628, Speaker B: I was a bridge or I was.
00:34:05.634 - 00:34:20.320, Speaker A: A bridge or yeah, exactly. So they're upgrading the infrastructure side with Core and Enclave the chain has had like no downtime super customizable for devs. Yeah, if you're a builder. AVAX network. AVAX network, great place to be.
00:34:20.390 - 00:34:24.556, Speaker B: But do Yano and I as well? So you definitely go check them out. But click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:34:24.588 - 00:34:25.888, Speaker A: Click the link, otherwise you're not going.
00:34:25.894 - 00:34:28.304, Speaker B: To get any credit. Come on, click the link at the bottom.
00:34:28.422 - 00:34:37.652, Speaker A: Give us the credit. Exactly. So, yeah, big thanks to Avalanche. You just had a great experience with them the other day on the user side of things. Go check them out, guys.
00:34:37.706 - 00:34:39.716, Speaker B: Thank us later. Let's get back to the show, man.
00:34:39.738 - 00:34:57.420, Speaker A: So you think we'll see the price action that we've seen in the last couple of cycles, which is like, Bitcoin moves, then ETH moves, then I guess last time it was like Alt L ones move and then tokens move, or like something further on the risk spectrum. Like last time it was NFTs.
00:34:58.160 - 00:35:50.748, Speaker C: I think it starts even earlier than that and I think we're starting to see the beginnings of it. So remember after COVID when the S and P 500 was ramping and crypto was doing nothing? I remember this because I was like, should I start buying cruise ship stocks and airline stocks? Because these are just like left out of the equation. So generally it's like bonds get bid, equities get bid, ETH bitcoin then get bid, then it's like, what's next? And that what's next question is the key thing because that's like the narrative driver of the market? Is it like these all L ones that are kind of like rudderless, that are just copy pasting ethereum? Or is it like people are finally getting interested in DFI and games and liquid staking derivatives and things like that? My hope is that it goes into the more utility driven camp than just like, let's go pump soluna AVAX phone, or whatever people are interested in now.
00:35:50.914 - 00:36:24.250, Speaker B: I think another big something that's important to think about is like, where's the leverage ultimately going to come from? So when you think about what ended up driving the great financial crisis, there was these mortgage backed securities, right, that you could chop them up a million different ways and you could say, this is lower risk investment and you kind of ladder on this entire system of derivatives. On top of that, the leverage that drove this particular cycle and unwind was basically like these CFI bucket shops and all piling into the same, like, two arbitrages that everyone saw.
00:36:25.340 - 00:36:56.820, Speaker D: Do you know what the ten year US government bond has done in terms of yield in the last month? It's down almost 20%. So to play this out once again, you've got yields going down, bonds are getting bid, stock market. So the S and P 500 is above, I think, four K today, or it's close there. It's 19, 39, 50. You're starting to see the tea leaves and the line of sight to where the bid starts to get pumped.
00:36:57.640 - 00:37:30.830, Speaker A: So, yeah, this makes the world make more sense to me, actually, because you didn't see this. Like, bitcoin should have gone beyond 65K in the last cycle. Both Bitcoin and ETH should have pumped higher in the last cycle. But now with that thesis, if you believe what Vance just said, and Michael, what probably you agree with, the price of the majors was artificially suppressed in the last cycle. Yeah.
00:37:32.160 - 00:37:51.670, Speaker D: In lieu of these alt coins, alt assets that were getting higher a bid than they should have, you can't just pull value out of the system, right? It's like one of those balloons where you squeeze one end, it pops up on the other. That's kind of the core thesis here.
00:37:52.600 - 00:37:56.020, Speaker A: God, the Bitcoin maxis are going to be so cringe in the next cycle.
00:37:58.940 - 00:38:00.836, Speaker D: Just wait for the ETH maxis.
00:38:01.028 - 00:38:04.600, Speaker A: I like ETH, Maxis. David Hoffman throws a good party.
00:38:05.340 - 00:38:06.570, Speaker C: Hey, there we go.
00:38:07.100 - 00:38:14.670, Speaker A: Did you see CoinDesk's most influential, by the way? I don't think Mike is going to come back. I think Mike's, he's having some struggles, this.
00:38:18.560 - 00:38:19.310, Speaker D: Three.
00:38:21.360 - 00:38:24.930, Speaker A: Did you see the CoinDesk Most Influential list came out this week?
00:38:25.700 - 00:38:26.848, Speaker C: We didn't get hit up.
00:38:26.934 - 00:38:40.790, Speaker A: It was a horrendous list. I was like, who is making this thing? Just a horrendous list? But B, the Bitcoin maxis were really upset because there were no bitcoin maxis on, like, poor one out.
00:38:41.160 - 00:38:44.448, Speaker C: Well, Nick Carter was on there, but they took some nick Carter's?
00:38:44.464 - 00:38:48.992, Speaker A: Not a bitcoin Maxi. I actually would not throw him in the bitcoin maxi.
00:38:49.056 - 00:38:52.836, Speaker D: Yeah, not anymore, maybe used to be I like Nick.
00:38:52.868 - 00:38:57.864, Speaker C: If I was a Bitcoiner, I would probably elect him president of whatever council there is.
00:38:57.902 - 00:39:18.224, Speaker A: Well, what happened was Castle Island castle island made some really good investments last year or yeah, this year still in 2022. Unfortunately, they made some DFI investments and the Bitcoin maxes were like, you're not a true Bitcoiner. And he's like, I'm getting returns for the fund. Like, sue me. And so they got pissed at him, right.
00:39:18.262 - 00:39:28.692, Speaker D: And then he didn't he have the whole, like, hey, I've actually really taken a hard look at the Bitcoin Massey community and didn't he change his name to Nick ETH or something?
00:39:28.746 - 00:39:51.836, Speaker A: Yeah, something like that. Yeah. I love it. I got a question for you guys as we wait for Mike to potentially come back. So apes and punks both trading at about 63 floor right now. I think technically apes might be like one or two ETH higher. What would you OOH, your lawyer won't let me ask this question.
00:39:52.018 - 00:39:53.532, Speaker C: No, you can ask this question.
00:39:53.586 - 00:40:00.670, Speaker A: What do you like more apes or punks at these or okay, what question do you want me to ask?
00:40:03.680 - 00:40:07.730, Speaker C: Own, I think I own like a couple crypto punks or something like that.
00:40:08.100 - 00:40:09.650, Speaker A: Oh, aren't you so cool?
00:40:10.260 - 00:40:33.960, Speaker C: No, I bought them because Michael and I started an NFT startup before we started framework. And then for the first year and a half, we refused to do anything oriented because we had so much scar tissue. And then I bought literally the absolute pico top of crypto punks to see what it felt like. And it was the most anticlimactic experience of my entire life.
00:40:34.030 - 00:40:36.570, Speaker A: See what it felt like. You want your screen to pop up?
00:40:36.940 - 00:40:40.952, Speaker C: I showed my grandma. I was like, look, that's not that cool.
00:40:41.006 - 00:40:42.540, Speaker A: I was like, you're not sick.
00:40:45.840 - 00:41:08.224, Speaker C: I think the execution risk of the board ape metaverse is very high. If they blow that, you kind of blow up the whole ecosystem. But if it succeeds, maybe it's a lot more valuable, kind of like ETH. Versus if punks are like the bitcoin. And there's never anything that's going to happen with punks. I think the punks avatar is iconic. I think there is a market for that, at least.
00:41:08.224 - 00:41:18.420, Speaker C: Like the board apes are just like, kind of ugly to me. I am wearing a board apes hoodie right now, though, because they sent this to me. So thank you. But I do love free merchandise, I think is the point.
00:41:18.490 - 00:41:23.168, Speaker A: I do too. That's why we do a pod, is to get the free merch.
00:41:23.264 - 00:41:25.944, Speaker C: Dude, I wore a blockfly shirt to the gym the other day and people.
00:41:25.982 - 00:41:37.020, Speaker A: Like Mike was repping a luna shirt the other day. Just got to do it. It's free. Vance, why isn't your PFP your punk on Twitter?
00:41:38.000 - 00:41:43.580, Speaker C: Because I bought it into my doxed wallet or my undocumented wallet, and I don't want people to know that it's mine.
00:41:46.560 - 00:41:47.500, Speaker A: Crypto.
00:41:49.280 - 00:41:50.936, Speaker D: Got to have that docs wallet.
00:41:51.048 - 00:41:56.708, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the bad part about a one of one NFT. You can't really send it anywhere else and have people not know who you are.
00:41:56.794 - 00:42:09.960, Speaker A: No, that's true. All right, let's talk about Maple. So Maple got on the wrong side of a loan to orthogonal. Michael, you want to do us the justice of summing this up?
00:42:10.110 - 00:42:10.856, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:11.038 - 00:42:56.400, Speaker D: And just as context, we are investors in Maple, not providing any financial advice, et cetera, et cetera. My read of the situation, and just to describe Maple a little bit, they are a platform that has three parties that facilitate the ecosystem. You've got the lenders who put capital in, and usually it's in the form of USDC or sometimes ETH into a pool. Then you've got borrowers on the other side of that pool. And the people who are making the credit decisions are what's called the pool delegates. They take a fee, so they get a cut of the loan origination fee. I think potentially sometimes part of the interest, but essentially the ecosystem is maple is just the software solution.
00:42:56.400 - 00:43:49.992, Speaker D: And you've got pool delegates who take on the credit risk, usually provide some first loss capital to the pool itself, and then they're making credit decisions for the borrowers, and borrowers pay lenders with interest and principal. Ultimately, what happened here and we've been a lender. I think we've also been a borrower. We're users of the platform and still think that the platform is going to outlast this situation. But essentially Maven Eleven was the pool delegate for a pool that lent a substantial amount of the pool's assets to a trading company, a market making company called Orthogonal Trading. Orthogonal Trading had assets, it seems to be on FTX. Originally when the FTX situation blew up, orthogonal said that the losses were like 10% of what they actually were.
00:43:49.992 - 00:44:55.870, Speaker D: So there was a misdirection or just sort of an untruth that was told to the credit deciders here and essentially the hole was a lot bigger and so it became apparent in public that the hole was a lot larger. People who are lenders in this situation are going to take a loss on the capital that they lent and I'm not sure exactly what the resolution will be. But Maven Eleven essentially is the credit decider here and they probably have some either capital backstop that they lose or some credit reputational risk that they have as well. So tough to see all around. This is just like part of the blowback. And frankly, when we were talking with the teams, all the different parties related to this, way back a couple of weeks and a couple of months ago, it seemed like we got off scot free and there wasn't any situation, there wasn't any blowback, there wasn't any issue. And in reality the issue was larger than we were initially led on.
00:44:55.870 - 00:45:09.664, Speaker D: But ultimately what I'd say is this isn't a software or a platform issue and it's more of a credit issue in a particular situation. And yeah, that's the only kind of directive going forward.
00:45:09.782 - 00:45:20.432, Speaker A: When you say it's more of a credit issue, that's the same issue that a BlockFi had. BlockFi didn't have a software issue, BlockFi had a credit issue.
00:45:20.486 - 00:45:26.870, Speaker D: So very distinct difference in that BlockFi in this analogy was both the.
00:45:28.920 - 00:45:29.536, Speaker A: Well.
00:45:29.658 - 00:45:41.416, Speaker D: The users of the platform were the lenders, the borrowers were the borrowers, but BlockFi was the pool delegate. Blockfly was the pool delegate as well as the software solution, the platform.
00:45:41.518 - 00:45:41.876, Speaker A: I see.
00:45:41.918 - 00:45:49.150, Speaker D: So yes, they are the platform, but they were also making their credit decisions of who to lend to. So there is a very clear difference.
00:45:51.760 - 00:46:26.680, Speaker A: Defaults are a normal thing in any platform, right? When a borrower defaults, that's basically a failure. In underwriting, that's like the risk evaluation went wrong somewhere though I guess that's like it's normal to default. But you would hope that if the risk management and your risk engine is good enough, then that risk gets priced into any loan, into every loan origination, which then helps create this reserve to account for defaults. Right. So I guess a couple of questions here. One is just to make sure I understand the Maple system. Does Maple do the underwriting or who does the underwriting?
00:46:27.820 - 00:46:28.724, Speaker D: The pool delegate.
00:46:28.772 - 00:46:30.810, Speaker A: Pool delegate. Right, okay.
00:46:31.340 - 00:47:01.780, Speaker D: So this is a very kind of clear difference. The pool delegate for each individual pool. And so when we were participating, there were like four or five, six or seven different pools. Each one of them has a different pool delegate who is making the credit decisions, who's doing the risk management, who's also putting up first loss capital. And so there is some skin in the game, but they're also the ones who are making the decisions. It's sort of like saying, okay, Block five failed. And therefore that's an indictment on the internet, because all of this was running over the internet.
00:47:01.780 - 00:47:09.540, Speaker D: It's not the same thing if you're running the platform, you have the software, you have the network, but you also are making the credit decisions.
00:47:11.080 - 00:47:43.520, Speaker A: I love Maple and Sid and everything that they've built on the positive side of this defaults happen, they had like a 99.7% repayment rate on 2 billion of loans issued after this week. That repayment rate goes down to like 98.5 platforms getting better every single month. That's the positive side. Maybe the pessimistic side of this is like if this had been big enough, this could have taken down. They're lucky that this was so small.
00:47:43.520 - 00:47:45.890, Speaker A: I would say they got pretty lucky here.
00:47:47.060 - 00:48:34.464, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's learnings too. Maple probably needs and Maple is like, there's Maple version one, like Maple version two is coming out next year. And part of Maple version two is just like better underwriting tools, like proof of reserve, proof of liability, giving tools to the pool delegate to understand where exactly are your liabilities in real time. Because if you looked on, and this may have not have told you anything, but if you looked at Nansen AI, you can see orthogonal depositing, like $23 million FTX. And at that point you probably know that, okay, these people are stuck here. And that wouldn't have helped you because the money is just gone at that point. But having a direct understanding on a position by position, counterparty by counterparty basis of where things are, I think that's where this is going.
00:48:34.464 - 00:48:47.392, Speaker C: And there's always going to be a need for under collateralized or like at collateral borrow that's not going away. And all of the alternatives today are completely dead.
00:48:47.536 - 00:49:57.288, Speaker D: I was about to say, especially with Genesis blowing up Blockfly, blowing up the centralized counterparties, let's just run this out and take it to its logical conclusion. The thing that we've been saying for the last six months is that CFI, centralized finance, where you have black box institutions ultimately can run away with the value and they can take it and they can do whatever they want with it. Right? It's a black box. When you have the ability to have transparency and decentralization, that's where you have a competitively advantaged position relative to the centralized black box providers, better tooling, better understanding, all of that stuff makes the most sense and is going to be literally months away. But if you have Genesis, if you had Genesis's loan book in the same manner that Maple has their loan book, you would have been able to figure out the insolvency or the ill liquidity way sooner because it's all on chain. The only situation here, I think the other big lesson here from a pool delegate perspective, when you're making credit worthy decisions, don't put over 40% of the pool into a single centralized entity. That's just not smart.
00:49:57.288 - 00:50:18.960, Speaker D: So that's more on that particular situation. But as a lender, you can see that that pool delegate decided to put 40% with orthogonal trading. You make that decision and you make that decision every day that you put assets into that pool. The ability to see that is just a competitive advantage versus something that we've seen blow up historically.
00:50:19.120 - 00:50:44.036, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this just shows how big of an opportunity underwriting is in crypto and to make yeah, I don't know, I hadn't thought about that that much. But you basically just need much faster underwriting, you need better underwriting, you need more data available on chain to underwrite things on chain. Are you guys investing in that or is Maple your play on that or how do you invest in that?
00:50:44.158 - 00:51:18.560, Speaker C: One of our big themes is rebuilding DFI and rebuilding it not from a position of like, we need to go launch, like, 50 more uniswap V two clones, but underwriting. That makes sense on an under collateralized basis on chain regulated platforms in the US that people can use to do D five things without going on chain explicitly. Even things like Exchange connectors and low latency trading infrastructure. These are all the things that are going to lead to the next boom in DFI. The bad news is that they don't all have a token. Like retail can't participate in all of them. Most of them are like private startup investments that are equity.
00:51:18.560 - 00:51:43.230, Speaker C: But the future of DeFi is bright. There's a lot of very obvious holes that need to be filled. And I think once those holes get filled, the market's going to be entirely different going forward. We're also funding new prop firms that could be the next jump. Trading things like that. Building those market participants and those personas is also part of kind of what we're doing. And so we're not just like building the tools, we're also building the users and funding them.
00:51:43.230 - 00:51:52.640, Speaker C: I don't know, I think DFI has a very bright future ahead of it. It just needs more tooling, more infrastructure, and just like better underwriting. Just generally.
00:51:53.460 - 00:51:57.980, Speaker D: 98.5% is a pretty amazing statistic.
00:51:58.060 - 00:52:01.650, Speaker A: So you guys are optimistic Maple makes it out of this?
00:52:02.020 - 00:52:26.296, Speaker C: Yeah, there are startups that we worry about that don't have product market fit that we're trying to steer towards having an audience of people who want to use it. Maple does not have that problem. Maple has like an egg on its face problem and we need to launch version two problem. But Sid the team, they're high quality entrepreneurs. They have a product that people want. It's just a matter of weathering the storm and they have the capital to make it. So we're not too concerned.
00:52:26.296 - 00:52:34.670, Speaker C: It's just like awkward. We're friends with the Maple Evan guys, we were friends with Josh and Orthogonal, and we're investors in some of their projects as well.
00:52:35.280 - 00:52:39.600, Speaker A: And they're just like, what happened to Orthogonal? They just got on the wrong side of some trades.
00:52:40.980 - 00:53:04.744, Speaker C: Probably a mixture of bad trades and leaving money in these places, but markets and at the end of the bull market, it's kind of like, oh, you're in a group chat with all of them and one of them blew up, the other is pool, and now you have to play intermediate or it's just like a shitty situation. You don't want to be in that situation.
00:53:04.942 - 00:53:26.608, Speaker D: And it's tough too, right? Everybody had some pain. Whether it's direct, indirect, the different contagions have spread extremely far. Where it gets to be unrecoverable is misleading people to think that there isn't as big of a hole as there really is. And that, I think, is that's the toughest part.
00:53:26.694 - 00:53:27.840, Speaker A: Chad GBT.
00:53:30.020 - 00:53:31.170, Speaker C: I like it.
00:53:32.100 - 00:53:46.116, Speaker A: I just want to get your guys'take in. I'm curious if you guys I mean, obviously it's just fucking cool. We don't have to hopefully people know it at this point. But I'm just curious if you think it has implications for either your business or for any of your port. Definitely.
00:53:46.218 - 00:54:30.676, Speaker C: Definitely has implications for our business. I would say that my impression of Chat GBT in general, the AI suite of software is that it's amazing productivity software, and that allows people to iterate faster, it allows entrepreneurs to ship faster. Generally, I think it leads to a productivity boom in the US economy or just like the global economy, which is really positive. And I think the setup is kind of like you had Google in 2001 really start to gain steam and traction as a search engine and it made everyone's lives a lot easier. It allowed people to be wealthier. It allowed them more free time to do things they don't want and then it's like that they want to do. And then the question is like, okay, what is the social network that gets built after all this productivity software? Frees people up to do more things, be wealthier, experiment with more things.
00:54:30.676 - 00:55:14.860, Speaker C: And I think the social network is crypto. And instead of having the next Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, I think the social network of things like ethereum, the identity ecosystem, are really the things that are allowed to really flourish because all of this productivity has basically been taken and spread around all of these different industries. And so if it was just crypto as a technology trying to lead us out of this recession, that's going to be hard. Crypto doesn't help people solve day to day problems that frees them up. But like Chat GPT, I'm looking at this thing and thinking like, do we need another analyst? Can I think just ask this thing questions? And I'm sure that that's a lot of the thought process of many people running businesses right now is that it's going to get easier for them, which is great. That's what you want. You want a productivity boom.
00:55:15.020 - 00:56:27.976, Speaker D: So I totally agree with everything Van said. Maybe a different take on this is I think productivity is one of the things that gets enabled here. One of the things that I was thinking about is this in relation to DAOs and historically, yes, you've had chat bots, you've had Widgets, you've had the ability to have customer support be in a different location from the core team and the sales team, or the people that you call when you want to buy something. Those people are elsewhere. I think you take all of the things that used to be, like human scale issues for any of these large scale companies, and you can now put that into a chat bot that has artificial intelligence, enough to be easy to work with, easy to understand, and something that a dow and a set of smart contracts can actually have control over. And think about that. If you wanted to build an institution that had customer support, that had inside sales, that had a lot of these functions but was a Dow and had software as the core infrastructure of what was enabling this institution, you would be able to integrate chat GPT and have that be sort of like the interface for people who still want to pick up the phone, who still want to chat with a customer support agent.
00:56:27.976 - 00:56:35.100, Speaker D: Those types of opportunities are now possible for software. Just so happens that Dows are basically software institutions.
00:56:36.240 - 00:56:39.550, Speaker A: It's really interesting. Do you guys listen to all in this week.
00:56:41.120 - 00:56:43.212, Speaker C: No. Or last week?
00:56:43.346 - 00:57:39.184, Speaker A: Yeah, last week. Yeah, last week. I guess one of the things they were talking about was I only listened to like half of it, but one of the things they were talking about is this kind of marks the pico top of SAS or like SAS. It's going to be less and less about SAS now, which I think everyone that's not a unique take. Everyone's like, okay, yeah, we've maxed out how many SaaS businesses can be successful businesses. But talking about how, okay, now you've got this general data set, basically, that feeds into GBT and the future really valuable companies will basically take that generalized data set and combine it with one of their that and that's where a lot of the power will come from. So the example that Chamath gave is like, okay, well, can you take the data set that Chat GBT is built off of? You go acquire a hospital system.
00:57:39.184 - 00:57:49.910, Speaker A: Now you're mashing up the healthcare data system with your Chat GBT data system, and now. That's a really powerful healthcare GBT data set or something like that.
00:57:50.520 - 00:58:09.080, Speaker C: I worry about is it real? Okay, say you combine the Chat GBT with the hospital system data. What do you get tactically? What is the specific output of those two things put together? Better medical recommendations, more efficient record management.
00:58:11.340 - 00:58:32.210, Speaker D: To play this through, I think you should have sort of like an interface of you going to the doctor that's not like, oh, you had a shoulder surgery four years ago. Yeah, your shoulder hurts. Okay. We can get you some basic information and some basic treatment if we can read your medical records and have a PII HIPAA compliant conversation. Right?
00:58:33.060 - 00:58:35.312, Speaker C: I guess WebMD and Google stuff.
00:58:35.366 - 00:58:49.060, Speaker A: No, what I think it gets you is, like, the ability to, I don't know, scan, look at a bunch of scans and be like, oh, wow, there's a 99.99% chance that's cancer, instead of some random doctor being like, yeah, that looks like cancer.
00:58:50.040 - 00:59:07.116, Speaker C: Totally. And that may improve the outcomes for the 0.1% of people who didn't get the right diagnosis. But I really want to be specific about what is no two things. And is this just better WebMD or a slightly better search engine? It's unclear to me.
00:59:07.138 - 00:59:36.884, Speaker A: I don't know. I've been thinking about it a lot because obviously, the nature of our business is content and media, right? So it has a direct implication. We already use Dolly for our business. Dolly is now, if you go on our website, our copy editor, who has no design background, we don't have to send our images to a designer before they go on the site. Now we just use Dolly. Like, we'll type in picture of a guy on the beach with a bitcoin in the background. Boom, there's your cover art.
00:59:36.884 - 00:59:51.400, Speaker A: So we use it. We use Dolly for blockworks. It's really, really cool. And so I put in a news story. I was like, this weekend, I was like, oh, go write a news story on Sam Bankman Fried. And it was really bad because it was like, Sam is this great guy. He's a philanthropist.
00:59:51.400 - 01:00:52.828, Speaker A: But the reason that that happened is because the data set for Chat GBT cuts off at the end of 2021. So it doesn't have the new data. But Chat GBT Four is coming next year, mid 2023, and that pulls in 500 times more data than Chat than GBT, 3500 times more data. And the most important thing is that it pulls in live Google search data. So I bet if I asked GBT Four, go write a news story on right? So I've been thinking about this for our business. It's like, what are the implications on journalism? What are the implications on podcasts? There's a new podcasting tool someone showed me where you can put in someone. It's like, hey, go create an episode of Jason and Mike talking about the fact that ETH just went to $10 million and talk about this, this, and this news story.
01:00:52.828 - 01:01:04.336, Speaker A: And it spits out a podcast and uses our voices. And it's like, that's a podcast. It's just really interesting. I don't know. I'm still definitely trying to wrap my head around it.
01:01:04.438 - 01:01:47.944, Speaker C: I have two thoughts on this. Number one at Netflix, back in the day when I used to work at Netflix, getting subtitles and then dubs. So like, people speaking the native language so that it made sense, like, if you're just listening to the movie was such a huge cost center and took so long because we need to find to dub it over the right guy who spoke Japanese, who could read English but had an actor level voice. That is like a business process that entirely gets used by this and kind of removed. I think that's, like, you're going to see a lot of productivity gains. To my original point. I also think it's funny that in the original descriptions of AI, everyone was like, oh yeah, AI is going to make everything except for the human creative jobs irrelevant.
01:01:47.944 - 01:02:20.360, Speaker C: We're all going to be free to do Macaroni noodle art and finger paintings for the rest of our lives. And that's what the human race will end up doing. And in reality, the first thing that AI knocks out is the designers, the copywriters, the creative people that need to write stories. Those are kind of the first to go. And so I do feel like it has been a little oversold as a friendly to creative human tool. It really is just like replacing the need for most people and replacing them with people who can ask the right questions or describe the right scenarios, not like the right painters.
01:02:21.100 - 01:03:02.564, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one of the implications for our business is going to be that actually just for media in general, and there's going to be a return to what journalism I think used to be, which is you used to have this huge advantage when you broke a story because you'd have, like, I don't know, actually 24 hours lead on any other competitor. Right? Because it would be printed in a newspaper. And then every other newspaper would be like, oh crap, that's the story. Okay, that we'll run it tomorrow. Then what happened is now that went from 24 hours to like 15 seconds. If we post a news story and CoinDesk is like, oh crap, there's a news story.
01:03:02.564 - 01:03:22.124, Speaker A: All right, cool. We're going to get the same news story up there. I think there's going to be a return. If Chat GBT can write these stories pretty quickly and using APIs, you can automate all this stuff. There's going to be a return to original journalism, breaking news, getting scoops, things like that. I don't know. That's one thesis that's a positive state.
01:03:22.242 - 01:03:56.680, Speaker C: Yeah, it definitely makes it more of like an individual talented sport. All of the people who are kind of commodities, they're kind of going to be reduced by this productivity software, but everyone else who's really carrying their own weight is going to be entirely distinguishable from everybody else. And so it makes the orgs a lot top heavier in my mind. If I can just ask GPT to make me a deck for when we go out and raise money. We don't need people to do that. It's going to be very interesting to see orgs develop with this in mind.
01:03:56.830 - 01:04:34.630, Speaker A: I mean, I think basically every SaaS company too is just going to plug this into some version of Chad of GBT three into their thing. Have you used pitch? It's a really nice way to create decks. It's like much better than Google Slides and for me it decreases the time to create a deck. If it takes me like 10 hours to create a deck on Pitch, it takes like 2 hours to create this beautiful deck. You could see a world where it takes like, I don't know, five minutes to create a deck. If I just put in like a one pager Google Doc, I'm like, hey, go create a deck based on this, or go create a deck based on this prompt or something.
01:04:36.680 - 01:04:39.668, Speaker C: Outside of that. Think about homework when you were a kid.
01:04:39.754 - 01:04:41.480, Speaker D: I mean, that's what I was going to say.
01:04:41.630 - 01:04:55.468, Speaker C: How do you teach kids to work? Also? Is that even a relevant question? Do you need kids to go memorize stuff? I mean, probably is like a mental exercise to build memory strength, but I don't know.
01:04:55.634 - 01:04:59.230, Speaker D: Yeah, fourth grade Michael is like, where was this?
01:05:01.680 - 01:05:07.356, Speaker C: We're pre internet kids too. I mean, I was at least a pre internet kid, couldn't Google stuff.
01:05:07.458 - 01:05:37.448, Speaker A: I feel like we've been reading about AI for a decade and now I feel like this was the moment. Do you guys remember when you first saw the iPhone? I remember where I was. I was in like 7th or 8th grade and I was like sitting on the, like we called them the stacks. There were these outside blocks where the cool 8th graders hung out. And my friend, maybe it was 7th grade, my friend Mia, she had like the iPhone three or something and she's like, look at this thing. I was like, oh, it's nuts, like mind blowing. And actually had a similar thing experience.
01:05:37.448 - 01:05:48.940, Speaker A: The first time I used Uniswap, I was like, wait, I just traded and I didn't open an account and didn't send it was one of those and I had that with using Chat GBT.
01:05:49.520 - 01:06:21.736, Speaker D: So I was literally about to say the instances that I can remember super Viscerally are number one. The first time playing a computer game, like using a computer and having a digital screen where it's point and click, I mean, it seems rudimentary, but it always does in retrospect. The first time sending an Im and having communications over the internet with another person that I knew in the real world, the iPhone was definitely a moment. Sending an ethereum transaction I think is similar to your uniswap experience. Chat GPT is up there.
01:06:21.838 - 01:06:55.440, Speaker C: Yeah, let me give the bare take on Chat GBT. I was talking with Smarter Child on AOL Instant Messenger when I was like 14. I'm sure you guys were as well. Like the automated AI chat bot. Maybe this is just like a productivity tool that fits into existing applications and business. Maybe it makes it a little bit lighter, but it's not entirely game changing. There aren't many specific end use cases other than media content and some commerce that could really use this.
01:06:55.440 - 01:07:23.568, Speaker C: I do still think the burden of proof is on OpenAI Chat GBT to prove its usefulness as at least an enterprise software. But keep in mind the really big tech outcomes over the past 20 years have been the social networks. How do you build a social network out of AIS? Does that even make sense? I think that's the rate limiter for how big this can get. Can this become a social network?
01:07:23.764 - 01:08:01.350, Speaker D: Let me take the bull side of this, which is, I think, yes, over the last decade, the largest outcomes have been social networks. The previous decade and still one of the largest outcomes ever in the history of capitalism is a search engine. And I think Chat GPT or any sort of AI originated search experience is just going to be fundamentally better than typing text into a text box. That model is actually going to be more fundamentally interesting. If you're changing up what the text box is and what Google homepage is, you now have the greatest money printing business, because that previously was the greatest money printing business for Google.
01:08:01.800 - 01:08:41.990, Speaker C: Yeah, but Google is going to respond to this. I think they're probably like a few months away from unleashing something that looks like Chat GBT. But for search queries, I think that nukes a good part of their search ad that that's going to be fundamentally negative for Google. But maybe that's the story. Maybe these companies don't actually have a license to print money in the way that they actually envisioned and AI actually strips those profits out and gives them back to the consumer, the advertiser, et cetera. I don't know. There's going to be some successful enterprise software companies created for this, but generally I think this is just like stripping costs out of the system.
01:08:42.920 - 01:09:09.710, Speaker A: So I agree with that advance, but that's the best thing. I don't think there's going to be these. I think this is going to be the next big bubble in VC. I'm already getting pitches in my inbox like, oh, we're built on GBT. I'm already seeing all those and they're a bunch of fluff in my mind. And there's going to be 10,000 of these funded and most of them won't make it. But the best thing in my mind about this is not the companies that get built on top of it.
01:09:09.710 - 01:09:38.710, Speaker A: It's how existing companies and new startups can use this to decrease the cost. It's like when we were starting off, when we started Blockworks, we built using a squarespace website that saved us, like, to create an old website used to get a server and we used like, 99 designs. It's like all these little things save entrepreneurs so much time and so much money, and they save companies time and companies money, and entrepreneurs make the world a better place.
01:09:39.640 - 01:10:20.404, Speaker D: It's a trade off of producer surplus to consumer surplus. And that equation, in economic terms, is exactly what you're describing. Either it's going to be realized through lower cost price points of being accessed, getting access to these different services, or it's going to be produced with less people working at these companies and therefore more efficiently run companies. It's going to be cost savings, fundamentally. But I don't know. I agree it's probably bubish and probably will continue to get published because we just run the same playbook every single two to three years. But I think one of the things that I think about with GPT and sort of any exponential scale technology is that it always looks small in the first couple of years.
01:10:20.404 - 01:10:32.040, Speaker D: But the fact that it's exponential scale means that it surpasses expectations at some point. And I think that there is a moment where it will surpass expectations. And AI has been on that path for literally a decade now.
01:10:32.110 - 01:10:46.188, Speaker C: So the other one I'll say is that we actually have numbers on how many of these startups have been funded and how much has been raised. So about 12 billion has been raised by AI startups and there's about 480 of them today.
01:10:46.274 - 01:11:02.460, Speaker A: Cool, guys. Good chat, good pod. Good pod. We are entering 2023, where there is going to be no narratives. It's going to be tough to catch a narrative. We're the last stage of the bear cycle where it is capitulated.
01:11:02.620 - 01:11:11.348, Speaker D: I disagree. I think because there's such a void, everybody's going to go home for the holidays, you're going to come back, refreshed, renewed. It's like, great, we're going to start a new year.
01:11:11.434 - 01:11:35.144, Speaker A: People are so tired of 2022. It is remarkable. It's remarkable. I talked to a fund the other day who's like, yeah, we have a bunch of dry powder, we're just not allocating because we don't want to deal with any of the paperwork and deal with stuff in 2022. And some advertisers like, Blockwork is one of the ways we make money. And people are like, yeah, we've got money. We raised like, 123 months ago, we're fine.
01:11:35.144 - 01:11:39.368, Speaker A: But I'm just done with 2022, all right?
01:11:39.454 - 01:11:49.280, Speaker D: I was talking with one of the investors on our team and had two instances where some founders sent him Calendlies, but the first available spot was like, January 5.
01:11:49.940 - 01:11:53.676, Speaker A: I respect it. Just throw it in the Dell punt.
01:11:53.708 - 01:11:55.552, Speaker D: To the new year next year.
01:11:55.606 - 01:12:00.030, Speaker A: Yeah, cool fellas. Great pod. See you guys next week later.
