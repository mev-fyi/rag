00:00:26.650 - 00:00:35.526, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Crib. You got Michael's one and two. Vance Yano. Welcome, fellas. Good to be back.
00:00:35.708 - 00:00:36.566, Speaker C: What's up?
00:00:36.668 - 00:00:38.030, Speaker A: Tea today, Vance?
00:00:38.210 - 00:00:50.090, Speaker C: I'm always drinking green tea. I don't drink coffee anymore, so green tea just, you know, I drank so much coffee one time where like, really freaked myself out.
00:00:50.160 - 00:00:51.658, Speaker B: Like one big day.
00:00:51.744 - 00:00:57.902, Speaker C: Yeah, really all came to an end at that point. So now I do green tea.
00:00:58.036 - 00:00:59.120, Speaker A: What day was?
00:00:59.490 - 00:01:06.500, Speaker C: Oh, it was in Venice. I forget when, but I remember just being at a restaurant, being like, I need to get out of here immediately. I think I'm about to have a freak out.
00:01:07.350 - 00:01:11.310, Speaker B: How much coffee do you need to drink to freak yourself out off? Coffee.
00:01:11.470 - 00:01:15.538, Speaker C: I mean, like seven or eight cups of strong stuff that'll do that to you.
00:01:15.624 - 00:01:18.006, Speaker A: Mike used to drink a solid five or six a day.
00:01:18.108 - 00:01:24.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I still drink a pretty disgusting amount of coffee. I'll drink, like I have a French press and I'll drink the whole thing myself.
00:01:26.650 - 00:01:28.040, Speaker A: I'll drink the whole thing.
00:01:29.130 - 00:01:34.442, Speaker C: Yeah, make a lot of coffee just to the face. Put a lid on that thing.
00:01:34.576 - 00:01:36.719, Speaker A: Well, apparently, apparently we're not going to.
00:01:36.719 - 00:01:44.570, Speaker D: Be able to drink Diet Cokes anymore. Aspartame is rumored to be coming out next month as a potential carcinogen.
00:01:44.730 - 00:01:51.070, Speaker A: I thought we already knew that. I thought it was like yeah, for 20 years it's been like, Diet Coke gives you cancer. But it's so good.
00:01:51.220 - 00:01:55.680, Speaker C: So good. Worth it. I'm like leaking Aspartame right now, as we say.
00:01:56.130 - 00:02:03.970, Speaker B: All right, why don't we get into the content this week? Do you guys want to start with Prime Trust? I feel like we kind of got to start there. Yana, you want to give us the rundown?
00:02:05.350 - 00:02:38.238, Speaker A: Sure. Here's the rundown. All right, so Prime Trust is I think we've talked about this before, but Prime Trust is basically an infrastructure provider for what I'd say are like earlier stage crypto companies. So if you're a seed stage company, you just raise let's say you're building a consumer app, and let's say you're building like a Blockbuster app. They will give you the ability to have all the middleware and the back end, and they take care of all of that. So all the KYC AML, that's actually really complicated to do. All the onboarding kind of like the separate accounts for your customers.
00:02:38.238 - 00:03:10.674, Speaker A: That's actually pretty complex to set up. And it might take twelve to 18 months to set up. But Prime Trust is like a white labeled solution to be able to set up all that stuff in, let's call it 30 to 60 days. So you see a lot of seed and Series A companies using Prime Trust, and then once they get to like Series B or Series C, they start kind of chipping away at the back end and usually they get off of Prime Trust. But the reason this is all relevant, prime Trust basically just blew up in the last month. And here's kind of the timeline that I know of. So June 7 starts leaking.
00:03:10.674 - 00:03:41.038, Speaker A: That prime. So this is we're recording on June 29. So 22 days ago, starts to kind of leak that Prime Trust is in trouble and specifically got announced or got maybe leaked that they were raising a $25 million emergency round. A day later gets announced that BitCo is acquiring Prime Trust. So BitCo is one of the longest standing. Like most reputable custodians, they were going to acquire 100% of Prime Trust. A couple of days later, June 13, bank B A NQ, who's a Prime Trust subsidiary, filed for bankruptcy protection in Nevada.
00:03:41.038 - 00:04:20.954, Speaker A: And when they dug into their assets in the filing, it showed that they had 17 million of assets with liabilities of five and a half million. So everyone's like, okay, that looks fine. A week later, June 20, Prime Trust halted deposits and withdrawals, sent out an email saying, we're halting withdrawals, halting deposits of both crypto and Fiat. A day later, June 21, this is a week ago now, the trust, Prime Trust sought receivership from Nevada after they got a season desist order. So then everyone's like, oh, maybe this is actually pretty bad over there. Day later, June 22, BitCo terminated their plans to buy Prime Trust. They said they did a bunch of due diligence and came to the hard decision to terminate the acquisition.
00:04:20.954 - 00:05:23.986, Speaker A: And then, June 27, Nevada asked the court to impound the assets and all related property of Prime Trust, saying that they were short of being able to pay back their outstanding crypto based obligations. However, so that all basically just seems like kind of the unwind of Prime Trust. However, the kicker is there's two kickers. One is it sounds like, and it looks like the FID alleged that Prime Trust lost access to their legacy wallets in 2021. So if you are a Prime Trust, I talked to a couple of Prime Trust customers today and yesterday, they could actually see on chain the assets of Prime Trust. And it looks like they had them, but it turns out so it wasn't like they were like, leaving the system, but it turns out you could still see them there because Prime Trust couldn't even access them themselves. So then what they did, and this was back in 2021, so anyone who's onboarded onto Prime Trust, I know several companies who have since 2021, they've been insolvent basically since then they haven't had access to that money.
00:05:23.986 - 00:06:07.220, Speaker A: So that's why I think this is like, this is going to be whoever was running Prime Trust at the time should that's fraud. And then the second thing is to try to make I think Michael might know more about this than I do, but to try to make back the loss of customer funds or funds, they basically took the remaining customer funds and yoloed it on a couple of trades to try to make it back. And you guys have seen how the market's been the last several months. It did not go well for them, to say the least. So today where we stand is Prime Trust lost access to some of their funds in 2021. They used customer funds to try to make it back. They today owe a million dollars of crypto to their customers and about $80 million of fiat to their customers.
00:06:07.220 - 00:06:20.466, Speaker A: And of the crypto that they owe, 88% of their crypto assets today are in audience token, audio token, which is audience's token. So it's not looking good for Prime.
00:06:20.498 - 00:06:28.614, Speaker C: Trust, I will say so they're very bullish on music. NFTs basically, Cobra hasn't got to them.
00:06:28.652 - 00:06:30.150, Speaker A: Yeah, he has infiltrated.
00:06:31.050 - 00:07:28.346, Speaker D: So I think there's another variable here too, which is interesting. I don't actually know where the fiat came from. For them to be able to go off and yellow this Prime Trust almost exactly a year ago, at least, the announcement went through, raised $100 million to be a custody solution that was going to expand into IRAs and said they were going to expand into crypto. Staking if all of this is true, and this is all put together in a complaint that was filed, I think, in the last week, if all this is true, it looks like they took the investor capital and tried to be able to use that to yolo back into these assets, to be able to get them back. The tough part is, and I don't exactly know how the technology was set up, you kind of touched on it if you were able to see the assets on chain. And kind of my understanding of how this would work is they had basically the wallet addresses that were generated from.
00:07:28.368 - 00:07:30.938, Speaker B: The public key, private key pair, but.
00:07:31.024 - 00:08:17.180, Speaker D: They had lost the private key. So when they were setting up the infrastructure, it's sort of like you can send to that address, but that address doesn't have access to the private key to be able to send from that address. And that's the key point. It's like an email, right? You can receive emails, but you can't actually send them from that if you don't have the password. I think that might be the case of what happened, which is crazy, because from the outside looking in, every single custody solution says you have to have segregated accounts, you have to be able to track them on chain. And if anybody hasn't set from those accounts before, there's no way to know whether or not the private key is in access of the solution that they're trusting as the custodian here. So I think ultimately we're going to get to the bottom of this to see what happens.
00:08:17.180 - 00:08:49.270, Speaker D: The tough part is we have to get through another what looks to be another fraudulent case of something. The good news is audience audio token is not one of the top tokens that people are tracking. And I think also the size of this is fortunately relatively small compared to some of the other custodian know, like Coinbase, Anchorage. Obviously no comparison here to what they do and how they work. But the size of this is in the tens of millions, not the billions.
00:08:50.330 - 00:08:52.440, Speaker C: So who's affected by this?
00:08:55.130 - 00:09:28.526, Speaker A: Small crypto companies. So a lot of companies would have their they just had the USD held at Prime Trust. So they might have an ACH reserve account with half a million or a million at Prime Trust. They might have like an instant settlement or an omnibus account with Prime Trust. And there were a lot of these kind of smaller companies. And if you looked at their customer list, if you ever use, like, Archive.org, the Wayback Machine, their customers used to be big folks like Kraken and some of the big names.
00:09:28.526 - 00:09:39.638, Speaker A: And now it's a lot of smaller, again, like Seed Series A companies. Like what's the Bitcoin company where you can buy and sell swan, like Swan, the swans of the world.
00:09:39.724 - 00:09:54.522, Speaker B: Yeah, that was one of the early indicators. Back on June 7, there were reports of having trouble withdrawing from Prime Trust. And I think they transferred ownership of their assets to BitCo, some mix of BitCo and Fortress or something.
00:09:54.656 - 00:10:14.334, Speaker A: But fortress is run by Scott Purcell, who is the old prime trust founder. So just putting this out there. Yeah, I have a company. There a company I invested like, hey, we got impacted by Prime Trust, but we're moving off. We're going to fortress.
00:10:14.382 - 00:10:15.700, Speaker D: And I was like, God.
00:10:17.830 - 00:10:44.294, Speaker A: Same person, different company. But it's interesting because actually they were like, there aren't other options for us to use right now. It's the worst of the options, but there are no other options. Like wire shutdown. You guys remember wire? Wire shut down months ago. So I think wire would have been someone else that people could go use but can't use wire anymore. All the banks, barely any banks that you can use anymore.
00:10:44.294 - 00:10:48.460, Speaker A: So pretty tough situation for new crypto companies getting started today.
00:10:48.990 - 00:10:58.110, Speaker D: So just to double click into that, specifically what you're talking about is being able to receive Fiat and Mint or create something on chain that represents.
00:11:01.490 - 00:11:01.902, Speaker C: After.
00:11:01.956 - 00:11:09.678, Speaker D: Silvergate and Sen. And I can't even remember what the signature version of that was. There's basically nothing that facilitates that anymore.
00:11:09.774 - 00:11:10.450, Speaker A: Yep.
00:11:10.870 - 00:11:14.034, Speaker C: Is Santiago building that bank? Feels like that would be a good.
00:11:14.152 - 00:11:24.760, Speaker A: I talked to him again today about it. He said he's doing it. He said a lot of people reached out to him being like, look man, really like you, let me just save you the headache, don't do this. And he said he still can do it.
00:11:25.130 - 00:11:30.300, Speaker C: This seems like a pretty good business, mind it's the crime and forgetting where the assets are.
00:11:31.390 - 00:11:36.934, Speaker A: I mean, he might be able to do it because he lives offshore. He lives. Not in America.
00:11:36.982 - 00:11:48.446, Speaker C: It's closed location. Maybe they forgot the Pin code to the ledger. That's not maybe this is just a case of mistaken Pin codes that ever.
00:11:48.468 - 00:11:49.360, Speaker A: Happened to do.
00:11:52.790 - 00:11:56.900, Speaker D: This is Vance's recurring nightmare that he probably gets like once every three weeks.
00:11:57.990 - 00:12:00.660, Speaker A: I've had nightmares about ledgers. That's a real thing.
00:12:02.470 - 00:12:22.460, Speaker C: I'll wallet. I mean, what else is there to say? This is a shame, there was some crime involved. Seems like somebody is at fault here. The fact that the founder moved on and started the same business also very sketchy. I feel like we need some investigative journalism with a capital J on this one.
00:12:23.230 - 00:12:37.038, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the latest. There's actually kind of a rich history of brokerages reappropriating quiet funds and trying to make it all back in one trade. There was a guy, John Corzein, who was yeah, you have you ever heard of him? He used to be he was the.
00:12:37.044 - 00:12:40.750, Speaker D: Head honcho at M Sachs. Was it at like MF Global or something?
00:12:40.820 - 00:12:41.674, Speaker A: Ms Global?
00:12:41.722 - 00:12:44.574, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe it was MF, I think.
00:12:44.612 - 00:12:45.102, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:45.236 - 00:12:54.900, Speaker B: Yeah, but he did the same thing. It was a much larger brokerage. And I think the irony is he actually did it. He actually placed a good trade that would have eventually paid out.
00:12:55.670 - 00:12:57.102, Speaker A: He got stopped regulators.
00:12:57.166 - 00:13:01.046, Speaker B: He got stopped out by the regulators. But it would have really wallace's make.
00:13:01.068 - 00:13:01.746, Speaker A: It all back trade.
00:13:01.778 - 00:13:07.190, Speaker C: Like some people he had bought, I think it was Euro bonds or something.
00:13:07.260 - 00:13:08.498, Speaker B: I think it was Greek bonds.
00:13:08.594 - 00:13:27.406, Speaker C: Yeah, Europe had Italian and Greek bonds and they blew out and he lost kind of like most of the money and then he got found out and stopped out. But if he had just held them, he would have made a lot of money for both himself and his clients. So what is the lesson there? Crime doesn't pay sort of if you.
00:13:27.428 - 00:13:33.530, Speaker B: Get caught unless it does. That's the, like jesus.
00:13:33.610 - 00:13:49.574, Speaker C: I mean, it's not obviously the same thing as holding your client's net worth in FTT maps and oxygen tokens. But all of these stories are so similar at this point. Even the prime trust, like we have no exposure. Well, we have some exposure. Somebody's going to buy us. All right, they're pulling out. Okay.
00:13:49.574 - 00:13:51.750, Speaker C: The deal is over and we're insolvent.
00:13:54.650 - 00:14:00.620, Speaker A: It makes me think you really do need some regulations and some forced audits at the custodian level.
00:14:01.470 - 00:14:05.978, Speaker C: Yeah, but this is why as a.
00:14:05.984 - 00:15:20.398, Speaker D: Regulated investment advisor, registered investment advisor, you have to keep all of your assets at a qualified custodian I mean, there are rules in place for this if you get to a certain size. Obviously this and most of the clients weren't able to have that designation or didn't have that requirement because they're not fund managers, they don't have enough assets, all of the above. But this is why you just got to go with big guys. I think the other element here, which is interesting, is like, is there a point that DeFi could have solved this and if they truly had segregated accounts and they truly had lost the keys at creation? I don't know exactly the details that'll probably come out in the next couple of weeks, but there is an element of where you can have control of these assets in a DeFi ecosystem that has a wrapper around it. That has all of the stipulations and requirements of a qualified custodian to basically have the best of both worlds, where you have the you have, you know, the decentralization of these assets that are being held by somebody else and controlled by somebody else. But you still have the KYC, you have the AML checks and you have all the safeguards that a qualified custodian would have to have if they were doing this themselves. So I think there is actually room for improvement.
00:15:20.398 - 00:15:33.800, Speaker D: A lot of that would probably have to come with legislation changes and maybe that is something that's on the horizon, hopefully. Knock on wood, but I think eventually we'll ultimately get there because there's a better advantage to doing that.
00:15:36.010 - 00:16:15.700, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe that's a good lead in unless you guys have anything else to say about Prime Trust. To rob Leschner's new venture. So Rob Leschner has a new venture called Superstate, and I think maybe even before we get into the weeds and details of what Rob is doing, it's sort of a real world asset play, but I think that has the connotation many people think about putting commercial real estate on the blockchain, and that's not necessarily what real world assets look like today. So, Michael Advance, could one of you guys kind of give an overview about how you think about real world assets and maybe sort of the quality of some of the entrepreneurs that you see coming in and then we can kind of get into what Rob's actually doing?
00:16:17.030 - 00:16:17.490, Speaker D: Sure.
00:16:17.560 - 00:16:17.746, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:17.768 - 00:17:05.406, Speaker D: I mean, I think real world assets comes with so many different flavors. Like, to your point, Mike, it could be historically it's let's put apartment buildings on the blockchain. I think it can span from and there's a number of providers now doing this. Like, let's have representation of treasury bills on chain so that people on chain can get access to the yield that's being generated by T bills. I think the other aspect on the other end of the spectrum is let's do something that's native to the DFI ecosystem. Let's say it's ETH staking or like a leveraged ETH staking even. But it's going to be a 506 B fund that is regulated with the same controls that you would have if you were doing this with a subscription agreement and paperwork.
00:17:05.406 - 00:18:02.342, Speaker D: It's going to have the same type of stuff, but it's all going to be represented on chain and therefore sort of in this permissioned ecosystem. So I think you can kind of have both and call them real world assets on chain. I'd be really curious to see kind of where Rob thinks about the product offerings that he's going to be giving with superstate whatever it's yeah, but I think that you can kind of think of the blending of, okay, we bring something on chain that is represented off chain and historically by legal agreements, or we create something new and novel. That's a product that really should just be like an LP pool. But because we need to go through the same safeguards and attract new potential investors that have to go through the same regulated offerings, it's going to be something that looks like an LP pool, but with the same controls that you would have if you were just subscribing to a fund. So I think it's kind of both.
00:18:02.396 - 00:18:31.662, Speaker B: And so to get into some of the details of Superstate, I'm just reading from the release here, rob Leshner, the CEO of Decentralized Lender Compound, submitted filings to US. Securities regulators for Superstate, a new company that will create a short term government bond fund using the Ethereum blockchain as a secondary record keeping tool. So basically the idea is to know we've talked about people in crypto seeking yields that are offered in TradFi. Now, fed funds is higher than it's been in quite a long time and.
00:18:31.716 - 00:18:32.686, Speaker D: It was only a matter of time.
00:18:32.708 - 00:19:09.980, Speaker B: I think, before crypto tried to harvest some of those yields. I think one of the key things to understand here is that the fund is going to rely on a traditional Wall Street transfer agent to keep ownership records and Ethereum will kind of act as an alternative or a secondary record keeping service. So before we get into the details, because I actually think it's a great idea and we need to bring more collateral in, I think there's the rub a little bit. So, question to you guys. I would assume that this is an issue for all real world asset type things, but what happens in the event that the Wall Street transfer agent and the Ethereum sort of record keeping service? They don't necessarily agree.
00:19:11.810 - 00:20:04.634, Speaker C: Depending on who you ask, that's either a benefit or something that makes this not permissionless not acceptable as crypto collateral, et cetera. So in a world where you have a whitelisted access to this asset and the custodian of the actual T bills or real world assets determine who actually owns it, the only person that can hack you is yourself or the people who are issuing this asset. The other side of that coin is like, let's just say that I put a T bill real world asset in a uniswap liquidity pool and it gets hacked. All of a sudden, you can kind of just say, you know what? It didn't actually get hacked. That person still owns that asset. We're going to reissue a token. It kind of upsets a lot of the natural balance that you kind of come to expect with permissionless assets.
00:20:04.634 - 00:20:40.274, Speaker C: But these aren't permissionless assets. These are actually, in most case, shares of a fund, an Lt fund. Not an Lt uniswap pool, but an actual registered fund either in the Cayman Islands or the US. And so it kind of upsets a little bit of that. And that's like one of the less understood parts of this is that if you are not whitelisted, which means you are not KYC, you are not signed up for the fund, you can actually hold these assets. Imagine framework going and selling stakes of our fund to people that we didn't know, didn't KYC, didn't file any documents with us. It's the same thing.
00:20:40.274 - 00:21:17.182, Speaker C: It would be totally legal. There is some interesting kind of middle ground there where you can put all these T bills on chain. You can put all of them on chain, you can build a lot of them and then you can have a stablecoin protocol. And there's a couple of these going around. Ondo is building one of them where you can issue a stablecoin against the T bill. And is that stablecoin part of that fund? Can that stablecoin go to other people that are not know? A lot of the know, if you look at USDC or USDT would suggest that that actually could the kind of real world asset push is kind of twofold. Number one is bringing all the collateral on chain.
00:21:17.182 - 00:21:40.780, Speaker C: That's awesome, but we need to get the collateral moving around being used on chain. The on chain can't just be like the receipt of what's going on off chain. And I think the stable coins are going to be a big part of this. And as I'm looking at this, I'm just also looking at USDC kind of continuing to bleed out. I would be very surprised if this wasn't part of their new strategy, but maybe not.
00:21:43.230 - 00:22:28.646, Speaker D: Just to hammer that home or double click into it. In this example of the T bills or framework LP tokens living on chain, you got to have two options. You either make them non transferable and only the transfer agent like contract on chain can touch the contracts that represent the tokens on chain. Or you have them live in a permissioned ecosystem where it kind of goes back to what we were talking about with USDC. Like wherever the native minting happens, that's where the canonical example of USDC is. If you're using a bridge to get there, it's just not the same experience, not the same representation. If every single transaction has to go through the transfer agent, let's say you're in a permissioned walled garden experience of permission DeFi.
00:22:28.646 - 00:23:26.110, Speaker D: You can KYC, you've got, I don't know, framework tokens, you've got T build tokens, you've got like apple tokens and they all live in the CGO system. But every single time you want to make a transaction, it has to go through an intermediary contract that is represented by the transfer agent. That's not necessarily DeFi, but that's kind of like the other option, the other available option. Right now, we still have to figure out how to do that. It's almost like how you can have something live natively on chain and a transaction on chain has the same stature and status as something that is regulated and adjudicated by the transfer agent. We're not there yet, and I think frankly, rules will have to change for that to be the case. Just in the same way that when you used to sign something online, there was a law that was passed for digital signatures to be represented in the same legal stature as physical signatures, which is why DocuSign and hello sign and all those things actually started to exist.
00:23:26.110 - 00:23:34.930, Speaker D: We need the same type of designation here for blockchain transactions that have the same effect as financial transactions.
00:23:36.870 - 00:23:37.346, Speaker A: Just to.
00:23:37.368 - 00:24:30.162, Speaker C: Expand on that even more. So if you think about know in your you, how are you getting asked? So you're usually on coinbase, you're taking USD, you're converting it to USDC, and then you're putting it on chain. And the big thing there is that you have distribution from coinbase and that's what allowed USDC and USDT to go to 120,000,000,000 plus of stablecoin market cap. This is a different sales process. What you need in this sales process is you need Robert Leshner in a suit going to these Wall Street institutions saying, hey, put some of your cash management on chain and we'll give you additional yields. We'll do strangles, we'll increase the yield in some way, but you're going to have people selling to Wall Street institutions trying to get them to LP or put their LP tokens on chain. So that's the first one.
00:24:30.162 - 00:25:07.946, Speaker C: And if you think about what Leschner won't have is you won't have Coinbase being able to mint these T bills to retail. So you're not going to have that natural distribution advantage, but you're still going to be able to run an asset manager at a far lower cost, at least we think, than the traditional asset managers in the space, just because all of your clearing, your settlement, your compliance, your tracking, that's going to be on chain. So I think that's pretty interesting. The other side of that coin is we talk to a lot of these real world asset managers and there's probably like ten of them. The entrepreneurs in these things are super talented. The ondo guy, he's from Goldman Hashnote has like DRW behind them. Robert Leshner is very well known.
00:25:07.946 - 00:25:55.306, Speaker C: He can get in the door with any Wall street institution he wants. We think there's probably like in the next couple of years, at least 10 billion of pipeline, maybe 100 billion on the table. And if you look at all the real world assets on chain today, it's only a quarter billion. And so there's a lot of growth that you can get. But the business model and what it ends up looking like it's probably somewhere between what Bitwise is today and what Circle is know, it's not quite as dynamic on the distribution side as Circle. You're not going to get that natural flywheel of retail being able to mint this stuff, but it's not quite as slow and cumbersome as a traditional fund and running that because there is some reflexivity to having these things on chain. And if you can have a stable coin against them, you can get cheaper leverage because borrowing on chain is cheaper than off chain.
00:25:55.306 - 00:26:01.626, Speaker C: Right now there's certainly interesting things but this is all extremely bullish and frankly, it's all happening on Ethel.
00:26:01.658 - 00:26:50.750, Speaker D: One, the clear delineation here, just an additional point is stablecoins have a different designation versus what we're talking about here, which are going to be securities. These are represented as they're not going to be misconstrued as they will be securities. And so they just have to go through different safeguards. And I think the answer here to make this as distributed and available as possible is some representation of an ATS like product that has a securities exchange that lives naturally on chain. And I think there would have to be once again rules that are changed to be able to enable that fact. But that would be sort of the uniswap equivalent of how you'd be able to transact and interact with these things on chain.
00:26:51.890 - 00:27:04.290, Speaker B: I have maybe a silly question here, but how will the payments from interest on the bonds be remitted to owners of the LP shares? Is that done on chain or is that not done on chain?
00:27:04.790 - 00:27:36.974, Speaker C: So this is actually one of the cooler parts. So talking to a lot of these people, the real world asset entrepreneurs, they're like the reason asset management is expensive and you can't build a lot of products, even though they should exist or would be attractive to people is because you have a million holders of these. Call it high yield strategies. And you separate them all into their component parts and then you waterfall them all down, which costs money. And then the bank takes their feed, which costs even more money. And by the time you actually do all of this, the expense ratio is super high.
00:27:37.092 - 00:27:38.478, Speaker B: It's not worth it because you can.
00:27:38.484 - 00:28:01.154, Speaker C: Do all of this shit on chain. These people are like, we can actually design new financial products that would be too expensive to do off chain. And so I think that's actually one of the really compelling reasons is these people are like we'll put bonds on chain, we'll put. Stocks on chain. We'll do all that stuff. It's pretty interesting. It's a big market, it can be solved and it'll grow the crypto ecosystem.
00:28:01.154 - 00:28:14.540, Speaker C: But being on blockchain rails allows you to design new real world asset financial products that you can't off chain. And that's kind of the thing that you hear universally when you talk to these people. And I think that is just like incredibly awesome.
00:28:15.310 - 00:28:20.874, Speaker D: The recognition of that fact alone is why so many of these things happen to be popping up right now.
00:28:21.072 - 00:28:40.670, Speaker C: A lot of times we have to tell entrepreneurs, here's how this works. Here's why this would be interesting, having the entrepreneurs tell us it's way too expensive than TradFi to do. We can actually do this on chain. Here's what you don't know. I don't know. There's a lot of that happening right now. We're kind of on the fence if these are like venture backable opportunities, if it's like just an asset manager.
00:28:40.670 - 00:28:50.706, Speaker C: But I think if you build a winning one, tether made more money or is on track to make more money than BlackRock this year. So there's something there that's nuts.
00:28:50.898 - 00:29:30.820, Speaker B: I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is one of the things that's been a big problem for DeFi is just the lack of solid collateral in the system. So I guess I can't tell if I'm trying to fit a square peg into a round hole here. But if you had LP shares in a bond fund that just owned like three month UST bills that I could see being super useful in a DeFi protocol as collateral, and especially if you were getting sort of almost like a steep, like, Rebasing type structure you just had on chain payments that got Remitted to. But I now I'm wondering if that's actually how it work, because I guess the interest would get paid.
00:29:32.710 - 00:30:27.870, Speaker D: This is just like me thinking through product wise how that could work. Let's say you've got one of these asset managers, or like a consortium of asset managers that comes through and builds instead of the inability to transfer things on chain, they go with the walled garden approach. Okay, great. So you have all these things, these LP tokens, these Treasure T bill tokens, these whatever tokens that represent collateral and things in the real world. What if that ecosystem also has its own native stablecoin? And that own native stablecoin is something that just lives within the four walls of that permission to ecosystem and that is also being able to be used and they have a lending protocol. So then you could also borrow in that native stablecoin against the tokens that you have represented in that real world. And it's basically like taking all the concepts that we have existing DeFi and representing them in this small permissioned ecosystem.
00:30:27.870 - 00:30:45.930, Speaker D: But what if one of those is a stablecoin swapping mechanism where you can take the native ecosystem stablecoin that has to stay within those four walls and swap it for something like Dai or USDC and then you can have the representation in that permissioned ecosystem but also something that's transferable outside those four walls.
00:30:46.510 - 00:31:21.974, Speaker C: Yeah and in this walled garden ecosystem you might have your own perps protocols, you might have your own options protocols. Think of it kind of like binance versus coinbase versus on chain. They're kind of like we can't as American citizens get on binance with our KYC but we exist within the same continuum of crypto just trading hands. It's just going to be, I think very positive for crypto and think about Michael Howell and all of his high quality collateral is basically the driver of liquidity and price asset. If we just get more of these things on chain it's going to be really good.
00:31:22.092 - 00:32:06.130, Speaker A: I think this could have an interesting second order impact of driving institutions to not just offer crypto products like the Bitcoin ETF, but actually push them to start thinking about on chain products. And I think when I'm reading about Lesner's, what they're building, it's identical to what Franklin Templeton is building with their on chain us. Government money fund. It's the exact same product is my understanding of. So Leschner's doing it other vance you were naming some other people doing it. Franklin Templeton is making a big push could it doesn't make sense now but I don't think it happens now. But market starts going back up people start seeing DeFi being real thing again.
00:32:06.130 - 00:32:15.400, Speaker A: You could start seeing some of these huge asset managers and investment management firms starting to toe the line between on chain and off chain products.
00:32:15.850 - 00:32:33.098, Speaker C: Keep in mind stablecoins also made no sense when they were first proposed like in the last bear market you're like why would I put my dollar I have a dollar in my bank account. Is there like what you got to squint a little bit to see the future and I don't know, these things coming on chain is just awesome.
00:32:33.264 - 00:32:57.570, Speaker D: I mean it's also possible just think about it this way, maybe even my example is a little bit too much too many steps. What if instead of you minting a native stablecoin in that permissioned EJS system you just mint USDC and you're automatically building a loan position against your real world assets all that lives on chain but the USDC is something that's transferable and basically the substrate to be able to transfer value between public and permission DeFi.
00:33:00.090 - 00:33:38.980, Speaker B: Yeah I think one thing that's a little bit different in between some of these attempts versus maybe some of the scar tissue that formed in 2019 era is a lot of big financial institutions have proven that they understand this technology. Their understanding is far, far ahead of where it was just from my own anecdotal experience at that time. I've talked about visa a lot on this podcast but they've done a lot of really good work. They had one guy on their team. Mustafa put out this great thread about modular versus monolithic architectures, and that was not the kind of thing that you were seeing from some of these larger TradFi teams back in the day.
00:33:39.590 - 00:33:42.100, Speaker D: Everybody levels up in the bear market.
00:33:42.790 - 00:33:54.850, Speaker B: Yeah, big agree. Do you guys want to talk a little and shout out to Rob? I mean, he's a tremendous entrepreneur, and he's moved the space forward quite a lot, so just excited for him on this one. Yep.
00:33:55.010 - 00:33:57.438, Speaker C: And shout out Jason, the new CEO.
00:33:57.634 - 00:34:01.286, Speaker D: He's our boy name j Hob.
00:34:01.398 - 00:34:02.518, Speaker C: J Hobby.
00:34:02.694 - 00:34:06.380, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a fine name, I guess. All right, do you guys want to talk a little bit about.
00:34:10.750 - 00:34:13.020, Speaker D: Mike? Mike, what happened there?
00:34:14.910 - 00:34:59.798, Speaker B: I disclaimer I told everyone this before, but I just got off a Twitter spaces with Luca from Pudgy Penguins, and I'm all bowled up on the Pudgies, so maybe take this with a little bit of a grain of salt. But there was a new issuance of there was a new mint, basically, for Azukis this past week. It's called elementals. It was very hyped. People were very excited about it, and it ended up, from my looking at it, just being Azuki is facing a different direction. And I think a lot of people were pretty upset just in terms of what does this actually mean in terms of the fundamentals of the project? There was an are you kidding me? Kind of vibe. I'd be curious to get your guys sense of the response.
00:34:59.814 - 00:35:01.782, Speaker A: I don't even think they're facing a different direction.
00:35:01.926 - 00:35:04.250, Speaker B: No, I think it's the same same direction.
00:35:04.750 - 00:35:22.834, Speaker A: Aside from it, there are a few new traits, like a firebolt or something. But yeah, I was flipping back and forth between them on Blur. You literally can't tell the difference. And immediately, I will say very impressive. They were able to mint out I think it was like, 38 or $40 million. Yeah, that's a lot of money. Very impressive in this.
00:35:22.872 - 00:35:23.726, Speaker C: Very impressive.
00:35:23.838 - 00:35:52.154, Speaker A: The counter, though, is the community absolutely tore them apart. The price of Azukis fell basically 40% instantly. I don't know. It brings into a question a lot of things. So they were trying to raise. Azukis was trying to raise at the same time that Board Apes were trying to raise, and Board Apes raised that huge round, and Azukis wasn't able to get the raise. Imagine, like, take NFTs out of this.
00:35:52.154 - 00:36:08.366, Speaker A: Imagine you're one company and your main competitor does a huge raise, and now they're doing all these things. They're building games and all that kind of stuff, and you aren't able to do that. You probably are like, oh, crap, we need to go hire the devs and get all these people, and so we need money. Oh, my God. That's an ugly chart.
00:36:08.558 - 00:36:30.874, Speaker C: The devs are devs. I just have no idea about, like I feel like we just talked about everyone leveling up in the bear market. I feel like the NFT community has not done. Don't I don't even know what the NFT community is anymore. Is it like PFPs? Is it art games taking longer than expected? But that could be a boon to it, but it also doesn't feel like it's relevant to this.
00:36:30.992 - 00:36:35.740, Speaker A: We have our NFT specialist Mike Gablito to explain why NFTs are toys on.
00:36:39.150 - 00:37:02.260, Speaker B: Honestly talking. Yeah, this is definitely not financial advice, but do you remember a little while ago where there was this discussion about NFTs equity in this community? And from my perspective, I think that's been definitively. Don't I don't think that's what NFTs are. Definitely not. But do you remember Doodles raised at some ludicrous valuation a little while ago.
00:37:02.790 - 00:37:06.420, Speaker C: That was led by doesn't? Really?
00:37:08.070 - 00:37:52.162, Speaker B: So, no, but I think if you think about these things as IP, I'm not a huge believer of the decentralized Disney thing that gets tossed around, but honestly, look at what Pudgies have done. I mean, they sold, like $500,000 worth of penguins on Amazon within the first 24 hours or something like that. They kind of broke down on the spaces, like their Monetization strategy. And it mints is like a part of know, secondary sales and royalties are like a very small EBITDA kind of bump. It's like the cherry on the cake. But they think of it from licensing sort of agreements. They actually make money off the content that they produce on Snapchat and Instagram and stuff like that.
00:37:52.162 - 00:38:09.560, Speaker B: They have a very clear roadmap. And I think there is a good way to do this and a not so great way to do this. And what I walked away thinking is, if you're relying on financing your community via new Mints, you're just diluting the brand value that you have. I thought it was a betrayal of the community, to be honest.
00:38:10.330 - 00:38:16.870, Speaker D: Next time. Azuki's so the other aspect here isn't just like, oh, we're going to go off and mint some mizukis, and I'll.
00:38:16.950 - 00:38:20.974, Speaker C: Try I wouldn't buy one of those. This is I'd buy one of those.
00:38:21.012 - 00:38:23.840, Speaker A: These are cute. Yeah, they're cute. Yeah.
00:38:24.530 - 00:38:51.430, Speaker D: So it does feel like, I think, at least from my understanding of what's been going on, that the community was left in the dark on this. And everybody feels a little bit betrayed, obviously, with the sell off. But because there isn't much differentiation, there's not really anything that's different about these two different Mints. You thought you had one in 10,000. Now you have one of 20,000. They raised $37 million worth of Beats.
00:38:51.850 - 00:38:52.998, Speaker B: How much do you think they're going.
00:38:53.004 - 00:39:38.550, Speaker D: To raise next time they do any Mint whatsoever? Zero. Just destroying your customer relationship is like the death nail in this entire ecosystem. I think that's definitely lesson number one. Lesson number two is like, what's the use case where's the utility? If you're really just going to come out with the same artwork and the same thing, then there's lack of creativity on that front. I think artwork is definitely and has definitely proven to be a valuable aspect of NFTs and people care about that. It is sort of like a community and a bond that people have with their NFTs, especially ones that are used more as PFPs. But I do kind of go back to the same fundamental question is like what is the utility of this thing? And this is what Board Apes is working on.
00:39:38.550 - 00:40:09.120, Speaker D: There's games, you've got the whole Digi dash component. Maybe there's going to be some content strategies eventually. You think the same with Hugh Pain, with what is the next leveling up if you do own one of these things in this community, I don't think it's equity, but you're a part of the community. So what does that actually mean? It's kind of like the so what question. I think that's kind of the big question mark that I have broadly for NFTs. And I think that's something that has to be at solved before we can have a path forward.
00:40:12.130 - 00:40:49.546, Speaker B: There was just one more note that kind of got me thinking. I don't know if you guys have ever dug into any luxury sort of businesses. There's a great acquired episode on LVMH and there's kind of like a lot of the canonical rules of business are sort of flipped upside down when it comes to luxury. Luca made a really interesting this is the last time point I'll reference from him, but he made a pretty interesting point. It's a double side, kind of a dual edge sword of NFT communities. He said when you're building a brand, one of the most difficult things actually is kind of in year one and two of getting anyone to care about the brand that you're building. So getting those first, like 5000 people, that's a big advantage of doing an NFT type community.
00:40:49.546 - 00:41:13.186, Speaker B: The flip side of that is that after a couple of years when you have those people, you have to continuously kind of serve them and not feel like you're abandoning the core community. So it's kind of like this early jump start, but then it almost feels like there's a ceiling because you don't want to go too mainstream and abandon the 5000 people that really loved you in the beginning. And it's just an interesting there was.
00:41:13.208 - 00:42:06.578, Speaker D: Another aspect of that from that podcast, but also in just other information. Scarcity when it comes to luxury is a poor component. So much so that in Italy it is now illegal for handbag companies to burn their excess product. They used to handbags the leather handbags that Coach or Prada was making. They would burn them when they wouldn't sell out for the season. Instead of having excess inventory that degrades the brand and brings sure, they could have sold them for 40%, 50%, 60% or less maybe. And so now what they do with them is there's companies that go out and specifically control the supply of those products, so it'll be like, I don't know, a random target in Oklahoma gets one of those luxury brand items per month and they control it and send it out.
00:42:06.578 - 00:42:19.100, Speaker D: But the point is, it's all about manufacturing scarcity for this brand, because once you have that brand appeal, the best way for you to lose it is to dilute the brand. And, I mean, this is a showcase in that.
00:42:21.470 - 00:42:26.380, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't have much else to say. I disagree with you. I think it was not the best move.
00:42:29.150 - 00:42:46.690, Speaker C: I'm just licking NFT floor bright. This is just a hate crime. I just feel bad, like, that retail was the most into NFTs and it just felt like the absolute worst actors were in the NFT space. Maybe not the absolute worst, but some of the worst.
00:42:48.790 - 00:43:06.738, Speaker B: It was the new hype thing. It had been talked about in previous cycles, but there was like, CryptoKitties, but it hadn't really caught on. And the hypeiest areas are always going to attract the most cryptos, but there are a couple of good, solid NFT entrepreneurs out there, so I guess we'll.
00:43:06.754 - 00:43:09.074, Speaker D: Just have to gary Vee or Gary.
00:43:09.122 - 00:43:10.426, Speaker C: Vee or whatever his name is.
00:43:10.528 - 00:43:14.060, Speaker B: Whatever happened, I wasn't necessarily thinking about him, but yeah.
00:43:17.310 - 00:43:21.230, Speaker A: Have you guys heard of character AI? Have you guys been following.
00:43:23.330 - 00:43:25.866, Speaker C: Got it. You got a whitelist to get us on? You got a mint?
00:43:25.898 - 00:43:30.446, Speaker D: Let's actually, I have seen some of these.
00:43:30.628 - 00:43:32.014, Speaker A: Have you seen this?
00:43:32.212 - 00:43:33.054, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:33.252 - 00:43:59.530, Speaker A: You remember when Chat GBT completely took over Twitter and it was the only thing on Twitter for a couple of weeks? I'm not on TikTok. Are you guys on TikTok? Any of you guys? No. So TikTok has been 100% taken over by this thing, character AI. Let me show you their numbers. Look at this. They launched a couple of months ago. Oh, you can't see this.
00:43:59.530 - 00:44:35.262, Speaker A: Look at the can you see this? This is a similar web. 100 million visits in March, 170,000,000 visits in April, 280,000,000 visits in May. I'll show you the website for anyone listening. It's not super impressive. So you basically log in and you can talk to these characters. So you can get, like, an AI work study buddy, an AI assistant, your no nonsense assistant. You can talk to Elon Musk like, hey, Elon, why did you buy Twitter? You can plan a trip, write a story, et cetera.
00:44:35.262 - 00:44:45.080, Speaker A: You can talk to famous people, so you can ask Mark Zuckerberg anything, and it pulls all this information. So how do they have 280,000,000 visits? How are they growing at 6% a month?
00:44:45.690 - 00:44:46.630, Speaker C: Crime.
00:44:50.250 - 00:45:08.830, Speaker A: It's crime. People are basically just texting these. So I'm not going to describe some of the content that's being discussed, but go on Twitter and type in character AI and you'll see the conversations that are happening. It made me real bearish.
00:45:10.210 - 00:45:12.702, Speaker D: Oh, is that mean?
00:45:12.756 - 00:45:13.680, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:45:13.990 - 00:45:15.922, Speaker A: In the beginning, people were like, people.
00:45:15.976 - 00:45:21.570, Speaker B: Only use the internet for porn. I got news for you. Look at the most viewed websites on the internet.
00:45:22.150 - 00:45:35.480, Speaker C: Ellen mike, while we're doing the Chart Corner segment, let me share another chart. We good now, yeah? I mean.
00:45:38.650 - 00:45:41.400, Speaker A: You just wait till Chat GBT Five comes out.
00:45:44.350 - 00:45:51.738, Speaker C: It's like, I don't really care about that. I kind of wonder how much more.
00:45:51.904 - 00:45:58.080, Speaker A: This AI Hype cycle, do you see someone raise it? Someone raised $1.3 billion today.
00:45:59.250 - 00:46:11.300, Speaker C: First of all, that's insane. They raised 1.3 billion on 4 billion. And in their press release, they announced the amount they raised, the investors and the amount of GPUs that they had bought with the money.
00:46:12.630 - 00:46:23.298, Speaker A: But that's why people are raising this money right now, right, is because the GPUs are so in demand, right? No one got the GPUs.
00:46:23.474 - 00:46:31.810, Speaker D: It doesn't matter if you raise $1.3 billion if you don't have order forms with the company that's selling you those GPUs.
00:46:31.970 - 00:46:34.026, Speaker C: So I was watching the by the.
00:46:34.048 - 00:47:14.390, Speaker A: Way, that's why the amount of corporate VC, if you also look in these deals, the amount of corporate VC is at like an all time high. I think the high level information is and there's two reasons for that. One is like, they're all scared about AI and they want AI in their strategy. But the second is because it's so valuable for a startup to have someone with GPUs basically give them the GPUs. So it's like, money is free right now in AI funding, but GPUs are the hottest commodity. So you'll take a lower valuation, you'll take less money. If you can get a corporate VC who has GPU access on your cap table.
00:47:16.090 - 00:47:22.620, Speaker C: I mean, the corporate VCs have what I would call an unfortunate track record.
00:47:23.950 - 00:47:25.260, Speaker B: I know they do.
00:47:25.790 - 00:47:33.174, Speaker C: We work with some you're cool if you know who we are, but the rest of you just man, there have been some bad investments historically.
00:47:33.302 - 00:47:34.302, Speaker D: What do you seem the best?
00:47:34.356 - 00:47:39.920, Speaker A: You're an LPN framework, I really respect you, but if you're anyone else, we don't have any.
00:47:41.970 - 00:47:49.198, Speaker B: I actually almost helped design a corporate VC sort of structure. It's like one of the last projects that I did as a consultant.
00:47:49.294 - 00:47:50.878, Speaker C: I don't think there is a good structure.
00:47:50.974 - 00:47:55.830, Speaker B: No, there's no good mean. The number one problem is purely compensation.
00:47:57.370 - 00:48:21.580, Speaker D: So I was literally about to say the only model that I've seen that actually works is Google. Google Ventures, because they're basically like a one LP venture firm and they don't have any real information sharing. They're completely separate entity, just that the relationship is capital from Google and they incentivize everybody, just like regular venture investors. That's like the one model that I've seen work.
00:48:22.190 - 00:48:45.886, Speaker B: Yeah, the reasons I've seen it not work or the price, like one just compensation. It's like the amount of money you can make as a VC. Very quickly, you start to bump into what a CEO gets paid. And that doesn't exactly foot super well in an organization. So just right there you have a disadvantage. But then your objective as a corporate VC is to do things other than just pure financial return. You're supposed to fit it into the corporate strategy.
00:48:45.886 - 00:48:54.440, Speaker B: And what if the corporate strategy at the time doesn't necessarily mesh with the financial opportunities that you see as a VC and it's just kind of a brutal cocktail, to be honest.
00:48:54.810 - 00:48:57.080, Speaker D: Or what if the corporate strategies change?
00:48:57.390 - 00:49:06.662, Speaker B: Yeah, lots of issues with it. It was actually really popular around the.com bubble. There were tons of corporate VCs.
00:49:06.806 - 00:49:07.660, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:49:08.350 - 00:49:09.882, Speaker B: They didn't end super well.
00:49:10.016 - 00:49:14.960, Speaker C: Yeah, didn't end that well. Spoiler alert to anybody who hasn't read about that.
00:49:15.410 - 00:49:16.110, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:16.260 - 00:50:01.482, Speaker C: The other one that I saw on the corporate VC side was Databricks bought Mosaic ML for 1.2 billion. But if you dig into it, they paid with all stock and the stock of Databricks was valued at 38 billion. It feels like there's so much like smoke and mirrors out there right now where it's like all the VCs need to raise a new fund. All the software companies need to figure out how to slow the pretty serious decline in their revenue and decline specifically in new revenue. And AI is this thing that's like amorphous that you can kind of make it seem like it's kind of anything, but also just like encompassing of basically everything. It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out.
00:50:01.482 - 00:50:04.480, Speaker C: And now you have SoftBank riding to the rescue with even more.
00:50:07.890 - 00:50:10.174, Speaker B: There was a I saw an article about him.
00:50:10.372 - 00:50:11.086, Speaker A: Did you see this?
00:50:11.108 - 00:50:18.526, Speaker B: It was the Financial Times maybe or something like that. How he had kind of a come to Jesus moment. Really doubted himself. But now he's back on track, baby.
00:50:18.718 - 00:50:35.320, Speaker C: Yes. I too have started talking to God when we had bad investment. Are you there, Jesus? Yes, I know.
00:50:39.050 - 00:50:42.058, Speaker B: Last story I kind of wanted to get your guys opinion on do you.
00:50:42.064 - 00:50:43.034, Speaker D: Want to talk a little bit about.
00:50:43.072 - 00:51:37.814, Speaker B: Alts and specifically Solana Cardano polygon? So there was an announcement a little while ago we should also talk about Ripple as talked, I think it was last week, about just bitcoin dominance. And bitcoin dominance has been screaming up and everyone was sort of proclaiming the death of alts and how they're just going to get pummeled into oblivion. A little while ago there was an announcement from Robin Hood, I think he was back in the beginning of June. Yeah, June 9. They announced that they are going to stop their support of a couple of alts they named Salana Cardano and polygon that would be effective June 27. So there were these arguments that were getting constructed that a whole bunch of that supply was going to get brought online and those assets were basically just going to get annihilated. We're standing here on June 29, so a couple of days after this, and it kind of turned out that that event was a nothing burger.
00:51:37.814 - 00:51:49.280, Speaker B: And Vance, you were saying before we got on here, ripple's price action is not trading like it's about to be listed as an illegal security. So I'm just curious what you guys kind of think about the state of alts in general.
00:51:49.810 - 00:52:18.086, Speaker C: Ripple is higher today than it was when it got charged with the unregistered securities lawsuit. So that's one thing. Number two, there used to be when you would and this has really only happened I think once with Ripple but you would get instantly delisted from all important global exchanges. No one would talk to you or care about you or trade your coin. It was assumed that you were dead. Like being called an unregistered security was a death blow. Now it's kind of just like Robin Hood and the normie platforms will probably delist you.
00:52:18.086 - 00:52:43.440, Speaker C: There's going to be a little bit of overhang which the market makers are going to sell. It's like a 20% down price action day. But if this is like the worst case scenario for being called like an unregistered security, it really isn't that bad. Obviously you shouldn't make unregistered securities or do any of that or not financial advice, whatever, but I don't know. Gone are the days of Coinbase delisting you on just the whiff of a SEC lawsuit. It's just a different ballgame now.
00:52:45.170 - 00:53:53.800, Speaker D: Yeah, I think a lot of that will depend on what happens with Coinbase and I think that that's maybe one of the other pieces of data here is the backdrop. I think that was filed this morning, maybe it was last night, of Coinbase seeking a motion to dismiss the suit with the SEC and I'm definitely no lawyer nor legal expert. It seems like the strategy that they are taking is something that's pretty unique and pretty robust. I don't know what the chances are of that actually getting dismissed or actually having any effect on the case, but we do know that they're going to be fighting this tooth and nail to the end, which I think is why the tides have turned know back in the day with a single asset in the form of ripple versus now something that coinbase views as being existential to their entire business. So it's going to be a while most likely for any sort of decision, but it's taken years for to even play out. But it will be something that I think as this stuff gets figured out there's going to be changes but nothing's really going to change in the meantime. So it'll be interesting to see.
00:53:55.770 - 00:54:31.250, Speaker B: There's one of the blockworks podcast, Thousand X's with a guy, Avi Felman and Joda Van Borg and it goes live on the Empire feed so shout out Yano. But Jonah made a really interesting point on that podcast where the sort of point of maximum momentum in the SEC's favor actually comes out, happens when the enforcement action is announced because the dynamic there is it's very asymmetric it's kind of a sucker, isn't? They don't know that this enforcement is coming. The market doesn't know that the enforcement is coming. So that's kind of peak FUD and max fear.
00:54:33.430 - 00:55:25.060, Speaker D: I would actually say it's like, seven days or a month before it comes out, because I think every single time when you've seen these announcements, when you see the actual stuff that comes out, it's kind of like, oh, okay, all right, well, now we know what we're up against. But the fear and the uncertainty of what that could be is what really drives market action, at least from what I've seen on some of these moments of, like, the day where it actually gets announced, not that much happens. Remember what we were talking about? Like, marches were up when the Coinbase suit happened. Was it coinbase or binance? One of the two. So I don't we I think I've said this before, use this analogy before, but it's kind of like in the scary movies or, like the horror movies when you finally see the monster or the killer at the end and you're like, oh, it's actually not that scary. We're kind of at that point, right?
00:55:25.510 - 00:56:10.050, Speaker B: Yeah, you could be know, I'm not a trader. I don't pay enough attention to really look at price action around these things. But the other part of that so you might be totally right there, Michael. The second part of the point, though, is that the company where the enforcement action is, like, let's say the SEC is levies this enforcement action against Coinbase. They haven't had time to defend themselves yet or marshal counterarguments, and it was actually completely unrelated to this particular action brought by the SEC, but Coinbase won a case of the Supreme Court last week that I think actually moved the market. So one thing that we often forget about is that courts are actually needed to decide these sorts of things. And I don't even want to say, like, knock on wood here, but it seems like we might get a little bit luckier.
00:56:10.050 - 00:56:11.906, Speaker B: I was just talking to Jay, so.
00:56:11.928 - 00:56:13.026, Speaker A: I'm so weird at this point, I.
00:56:13.048 - 00:56:13.794, Speaker B: Can'T even say good.
00:56:13.832 - 00:56:20.514, Speaker A: Mike is now the most super that's.
00:56:20.562 - 00:56:27.670, Speaker B: The I think there are other I just feel like I don't know. I'm getting good vibes about it.
00:56:27.740 - 00:56:29.910, Speaker A: You guys see Jay Clayton on CNBC?
00:56:30.490 - 00:56:31.046, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:31.148 - 00:56:32.390, Speaker C: Heater of interview.
00:56:32.730 - 00:56:33.830, Speaker A: Love Jay.
00:56:34.570 - 00:56:36.746, Speaker C: Well, Jay wasn't that nice to us.
00:56:36.768 - 00:56:39.450, Speaker D: When I was about to say do you think you would have said anything.
00:56:39.520 - 00:56:41.366, Speaker B: Of the sort of that in 1780?
00:56:41.478 - 00:56:49.150, Speaker A: So funny when he was there, he's like, we need a new friend's. Like, we got to get this guy out. We need someone new. And then we got Gary Gensler. It's like, Jay's our boy.
00:56:49.300 - 00:56:50.238, Speaker C: Jay's our boy.
00:56:50.324 - 00:56:50.960, Speaker A: Well.
00:56:52.690 - 00:56:54.666, Speaker B: I think it's a lot easier.
00:56:54.698 - 00:57:02.690, Speaker D: To say that when you don't have the role, and I think he has a lot more clarity, and both sides of the. Perspective now.
00:57:02.840 - 00:57:10.562, Speaker A: I mean, he's also worked inside some crypto companies. He was an advisor at, I think, Fireblocks. Maybe one other dude.
00:57:10.626 - 00:57:39.680, Speaker C: That interview is notable because he trashes Gensler and says it's an abuse of power and all this stuff. It's also funny because it's a six minute interview. It starts with, So, Jay, like, how are you feeling about the war? Like, do you think the counter offensive is going to succeed? He's like, yeah, he's like Pining on the counter offensive and backmudd and well, or take that back and it pivots to crypto. That job of chief pontificator. That's a great gig if you can get it.
00:57:40.930 - 00:57:44.974, Speaker A: Yeah, true. I feel like you'd like that.
00:57:45.012 - 00:57:46.960, Speaker C: Vance, man.
00:57:47.430 - 00:57:51.278, Speaker A: Ukraine. Ask me about Ukraine. Yeah, let's dig into Ukraine, dude.
00:57:51.294 - 00:57:53.810, Speaker C: Just give me the John Madden iPad playbook.
00:57:54.550 - 00:57:55.620, Speaker D: We got the.
00:58:02.730 - 00:58:04.840, Speaker C: How are we feeling about RFK, guys?
00:58:06.730 - 00:58:21.846, Speaker D: That honestly was another heater of an interview. I don't know if you've seen it. Maybe came out last night. It's all of his talking points on his perspective on vaccines, but it just sets everybody straight.
00:58:21.958 - 00:58:39.780, Speaker A: The reason I don't like him is the reason I think a lot of crypto twitter does like him, which is he feels like nobody would know him if it wasn't for Chamath and Sachs just putting this dude on a pedestal and pumping this guy. I mean, also his name is Kennedy, so that's fair.
00:58:43.590 - 00:58:46.222, Speaker C: I like him because he's, like, the real burn it down candidate.
00:58:46.286 - 00:58:51.298, Speaker A: I liked him. You see his shirt off, flex it. Yeah, dude.
00:58:51.474 - 00:58:55.750, Speaker C: I mean, the weight on that bar, that's a little suspect. I think that was thinking at 25 and a five.
00:58:55.820 - 00:58:59.000, Speaker D: Yeah, it was 95 pound bench press, but whatever.
00:59:00.250 - 00:59:06.730, Speaker A: I'm not ready to get into politics on Belt curve yet. All right, here's a month away from the election.
00:59:07.070 - 00:59:08.170, Speaker B: We're a long ways away.
00:59:08.240 - 00:59:09.498, Speaker D: It's game time, though.
00:59:09.584 - 00:59:11.066, Speaker A: I know, but you know what I.
00:59:11.088 - 00:59:44.578, Speaker B: Find interesting is, so here's a candidate that has gathered some steam. He has kind of these unorthodox beliefs, and what does he decide to do? He decides to tap into the Bitcoin audience. And I just think that's a very interesting development, that he views this as large enough that he should take a very pro positive stance on it. That's meaningful. That's super meaningful. Let's use another example. Let's say Spotify in another world, or frankly, in the future, starts getting a ton of heat for Joe Rogan.
00:59:44.674 - 00:59:44.934, Speaker A: Right?
00:59:44.972 - 00:59:52.890, Speaker B: They get a lot of heat for this guy being exclusive on the platform. They decide to side with Joe Rogan. What else would it make sense for them to do?
00:59:52.960 - 00:59:54.186, Speaker A: It would make sense for them to.
00:59:54.208 - 01:00:03.390, Speaker B: Tap, become I really think Bitcoin will become this political sort of movement as much as it is a financial asset.
01:00:04.450 - 01:00:11.600, Speaker C: Say whatever you want, as crazy as it is, and if you need people to back you up, you just go. And I like bitcoin too.
01:00:12.450 - 01:00:13.200, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:15.670 - 01:00:17.966, Speaker C: Some crazy shit, but he is. Pro bitcoin.
01:00:17.998 - 01:00:21.422, Speaker A: You ever need a wallper of a tweet in this market? Bullish bitcoin.
01:00:21.486 - 01:00:24.978, Speaker C: Or if you ever get canceled, bullish bitcoin. Exactly.
01:00:25.064 - 01:00:25.806, Speaker B: Bullish bitcoin.
01:00:25.838 - 01:00:27.010, Speaker A: Why do you ask? Vance.
01:00:28.390 - 01:00:30.786, Speaker B: You're hosting an RFK. Yes.
01:00:30.968 - 01:00:31.998, Speaker A: Invite to a dinner?
01:00:32.094 - 01:00:32.510, Speaker D: No.
01:00:32.600 - 01:00:35.590, Speaker C: I mean, I haven't donated to RFK, but I think he's.
01:00:37.850 - 01:00:43.610, Speaker A: Nick Tomino from one confirmation. Had an interesting thread on DeSantis.
01:00:44.990 - 01:00:46.780, Speaker D: Hosted something for him, too.
01:00:48.990 - 01:00:59.760, Speaker B: While we're on the subject of non consensus, unorthodox beliefs, I'd like to create a petition to turn at least ten minutes of this podcast into a UFO type podcast if folks want to.
01:01:00.530 - 01:01:06.318, Speaker A: Did you watch the documentary? Maybe. This is an old documentary. I think it was on Hulu.
01:01:06.414 - 01:01:08.690, Speaker C: Did you watch the alien documentary?
01:01:10.310 - 01:01:11.650, Speaker A: It was a banger.
01:01:13.030 - 01:01:15.220, Speaker D: Is that the Bob Lazar one?
01:01:16.230 - 01:01:25.030, Speaker A: No, actually, it was like a three part series. I'll send it to you guys. It's a good one. I'm reading three body problem right now at Mike's recommendation.
01:01:26.490 - 01:01:27.720, Speaker B: That's a good one.
01:01:28.190 - 01:01:29.500, Speaker A: I like that one.
01:01:30.990 - 01:01:31.450, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:01:31.520 - 01:01:40.960, Speaker A: I hope you told me to read it. Why didn't that I don't think I read that.
01:01:42.290 - 01:01:51.134, Speaker D: I don't think there's enough content for ten minutes, Mike, but if you ever want to revisit current events on UFOs, I will.
01:01:51.332 - 01:02:06.402, Speaker B: I've got one down the rabbit hole for you guys. One of my buddies sent me this thing. Apparently this whistleblower came forward on four chan and just answered all like it just came forth and this massive I read it on the plane. It took me, like, an hour to actually read this thing.
01:02:06.456 - 01:02:07.974, Speaker A: It's pretty good. It's a good read.
01:02:08.012 - 01:02:09.190, Speaker C: Just give show notes.
01:02:10.010 - 01:02:12.920, Speaker B: I'll link it in the show notes? Yeah, it's on reddit as well.
01:02:13.450 - 01:02:18.438, Speaker A: Oh, boy. RFK and four chan in one episode. All right. Yeah. There we go.
01:02:18.524 - 01:02:19.462, Speaker C: I think that's it.
01:02:19.516 - 01:02:24.050, Speaker A: I think that's it. Good wrapping place. All right, later. Peace.
