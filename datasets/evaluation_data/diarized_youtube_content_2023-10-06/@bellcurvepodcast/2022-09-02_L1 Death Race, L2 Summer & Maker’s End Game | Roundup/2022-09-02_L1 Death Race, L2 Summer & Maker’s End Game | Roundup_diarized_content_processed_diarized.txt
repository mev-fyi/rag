00:00:00.650 - 00:00:22.138, Speaker A: Like if we're all just investing in picks and shovels, nobody's ever going to find gold. And I really would like to see the venture industry specifically move more towards the application layer. And I think that's where it's going. Time was whoever had the most technical investors would probably be the best venture firm in crypto. That's what drove outperformance. But I think you're moving in a fundamentally different direction. You have to play more at the app layer.
00:00:22.138 - 00:00:28.470, Speaker A: And funding all L ones right now feels like you're of fighting the last war, which is just going to be increasingly less relevant.
00:00:31.450 - 00:00:41.980, Speaker B: All right, welcome back everyone to the first official roundup of Bell Curve. I'm joined by Mike's One and Two. We'll see who's who by the end of the show. We got Yano and Vance fellas. Welcome.
00:00:42.430 - 00:00:43.814, Speaker C: Macro mike micro.
00:00:43.862 - 00:00:45.674, Speaker D: Mike, thanks for happy to be here.
00:00:45.792 - 00:01:02.030, Speaker B: We're cutting that. It's just not how we're going to start this podcast. Speaking of micro, by the way, we're going to chop all the other stories. There's a one big story that we got to talk about this week, right? That's the vitalik. That's the vitalik.
00:01:03.010 - 00:01:07.722, Speaker C: I thought you were going to naturally go speaking of micro micro strategy, michael.
00:01:07.786 - 00:01:52.490, Speaker B: Saylor, dude, I'm one step ahead of you. Dude, I got some good memes saved for the end, don't worry. All right, but let's actually get into it here because we got limited time. So Vance and Michael begged to talk about macro this week. So that's where we're actually going to start with this chart here. So we're looking at the DXY, which is the index of the dollar, and then we're looking at the Nasdaq and Bitcoin. So basically just I don't want to rehash too much, but the Fed had their Jackson Hole presser basically last week on Friday and that's right around were they came out much more hawkish, right? There was a lot of debate about if he was going to accede or if he's basically going to be Arthur Burns or Volcker.
00:01:52.490 - 00:02:21.290, Speaker B: He kind of went volcker and said, hey, we're going to raise rates to whatever we need to do. So the dollar has basically broached a 20 year high and we've seen Bitcoin and the Nasdaq basically sell off in tandem and we don't need to really opine and try to read the tea leaves of the Fed. But I would be curious because there was a lot of talk about is the merge in the driver's seat fundamentals of the merge based around Ethereum or is macro and rates really sitting in the driver's seat here? And I would guess based on just looking at this chart, they're like perfect inverses of each other. So I guess anything that jumps out to you guys looking at this chart.
00:02:23.630 - 00:03:06.070, Speaker A: Looking at this chart, things don't really jump off the page. To me. If you do look at the larger if you click on all and look at kind of like the past 20 years. This does become like a really crazy chart that just click on all go way back. It's really not been in this level for almost 22, 23 years and I was actually just thinking about this in the gym today. All the inflation people are experiencing, especially in emerging markets is just so much worse because the dollar is strengthening relative to their local currency and it's so much better in the US. As a result of the converse.
00:03:06.070 - 00:04:10.250, Speaker A: There's an interesting theory called dollar milkshake theory which is basically the dollar is this wrecking ball and when it goes up it tends to break things and when it goes down it's kind of this rising tide that lifts all boats in the same way that interest rates work and those are both highly correlated. But the strength in the dollar, the strength in the tenure leads me to believe that macro is probably still in the driver's seat. But the stock market today at least, and this is Thursday, September 1 seems to be dropping potentially on its way to more weakness. But there's been relative strength in crypto which has been really interesting to see and I think kind of what you're finding out is at some level there is a crypto native bid for these assets that isn't really that affected or correlated to macro. So I don't think I have a super unique perspective on macro. This is certainly not what I'm kind of best at or do but it's relevant because a lot of the world is just like one big trade. Are you evening, are you loosening? Are you tightening? Are you pausing? So yeah, it's all correlated.
00:04:13.250 - 00:05:37.000, Speaker D: The one thing that I'd add is just to keep in mind that markets move so much faster than policy and then policy moves faster than economics. So policy is going to happen before the numbers in CPI or GDP come through and markets are going to move way faster than policy will. And the president of I think it's the Minneapolis Fed, Neil Kachikari went on OD lots earlier this week and said he was happy with the reaction that the markets had to what was announced and what was talked about on Friday. And that type of hawkish perspective from someone who coined the term inflation is transitory, means that we're probably going to see more stuff happen with Fed policy and they're going to probably overhike before we actually see a real turning of the policy perspective. And I saw this on Twitter last night but right now the market is predicting that we hit 4% interest rates in March 2023 and that's currently priced into the market. If you think that interest rates are going higher than 4% by March 2023 that would be a change in policy from what is already expected to happen. And so markets are already pricing this in and I wouldn't be surprised if basically we see a change in perspective or a change in policy or even a change in the way that it's being talked about.
00:05:37.000 - 00:05:39.174, Speaker D: And that actually has positive impact on.
00:05:39.212 - 00:06:15.380, Speaker B: Maybe let's zoom in to our little corner of the world here. I mean, we've got basically a chart of major L ones, right? So we've got cosmos, ethereum, polka dot, bitcoin, salana and avalanche, actually. Decently wide dispersion, I would say. But the big outliers here are cosmos outperforming, especially over the course of the last month or so. And we've got avalanche, maybe underperforming a little bit. I don't know where you guys want to start on either one of those two. Maybe we can start on avalanche, since that's kind of the big news of the week.
00:06:15.380 - 00:06:18.040, Speaker B: Michael, I'll tee you up for that one there.
00:06:23.130 - 00:07:07.326, Speaker D: Definitely we can save a little bit of extra time for avalanche conversations. I think it's hard to look at individual prices and perspectives on what that means. But I think the one thing that is really interesting here is just like ETH versus everything else, the alt layer one base layer perspective, it seems like kind of across the board, other than, obviously Adam, based on the price chart you're showing. But basically all the other alt layer ones are having a tougher time than ethereum is price wise. But I think that that obviously has some impact from the merge. But also, just like generally, you're starting to see more gravitation towards at least layer twos onto ethereum, and that also has an impact on ethereum.
00:07:07.358 - 00:08:28.446, Speaker A: The other thing that stands out to me with this chart is if you think about something like ETH. That's been it was an ICO, I think, at like forty cents. And then it went to $1,400 in 2017, then it went down to $86, and then it went back to $4,900, and now back to $1,600. There's been so much price discovery in that asset that one of the things that we're willing to pay a premium for, for assets like ETH that have just more price discovery is just the certainty that in a bear market, when things get crazy, what level of conviction do the holders of that asset actually have? Are we going to get sold into in these kind of like, long, drawn out bear markets? And if you think about kind of the various assets, bitcoin, you have the four sellers of miners when the electricity costs produced of bitcoin is roughly equal to the market price of bitcoin today. But then all these other all L ones, you have just like this structural selling of people that are unlocking tokens, which are a considerable percentage of a lot of their fully diluted valuations. So the things that surprised me, like AVAX on this chart, is not super surprising given the lawsuit and probably people who knew about that before it really dropped. But Soul is kind of the one that stands out where you just have this massive unlocking cycle that to me looks a lot like east did in 2018, where it's just like everybody's selling it all at once.
00:08:28.446 - 00:08:38.420, Speaker A: Relative weakness on the asset that used to be the strongest. And so it just goes to show you kind of that velocity and that acceleration that happens in the bear market. It works both ways.
00:08:39.750 - 00:09:01.514, Speaker B: Yeah, I tend to agree with Been. It's been an interesting last month for Cosmos. They've attracted some pretty interesting projects. So Duidx is launching their own chain over there. And then Mike, I know you wanted to chat about Say, which is a new layer, one that's kind of specialized for DeFi. We can get into that because there's some pretty interesting implications for central limit order books there. But yeah, I kind of have the same take.
00:09:01.514 - 00:09:44.582, Speaker B: I mean, I do want to get your guys perspective on AVAX. So to set the scene, I was trying to load this picture, but you can see we'll loop it in later. But CZ basically tweeted this out. But there was a website. You guys can all find this online, but that tweeted out kind of these explosive allegations where they had a lawyer on video, right? Kyle Roche, that was basically detailing in his words how avalanche. Employed him as an early employee. Gave him a whole bunch of equity to basically, to paraphrase, direct the ire of the CFTC and the SEC at other projects to benefit avalanche relatively to them.
00:09:44.582 - 00:10:18.500, Speaker B: And I guess the caveats that I would say other if you look at some of the other reporting that this website did, it didn't look super fair and unbiased. I would say there's definitely a perspective, kind of a pro ICP definitive type perspective, but the videos are the videos too, so it didn't look great. I don't know if you guys had a specific take, but CZ basically tweeted this out and AVAX dropped like 10% basically as soon as he tweeted it. But I don't know if you guys had any specific thoughts or anything that you want to share.
00:10:19.110 - 00:11:00.778, Speaker A: First thing that comes to mind is whenever people try to do the fancy footwork sneaky moves in crypto, it rarely ever pans out in their favor over the long term. We have so many different anecdotes of people trying stuff that they probably shouldn't have for trying to get back at competitors or things like that. It always kind of blows up in their face. And this is an area where people are experimenting with software engineering, with financial engineering. The regulations have yet to have be defined and people can get really hurt if you are actively suing them, if you're actively directing regulatory agencies towards them. And so generally it's just not a cool thing to do. We should all be in this as web three stewards and stewards of this new movement.
00:11:00.778 - 00:11:46.080, Speaker A: And this feels very PvP. And the things that don't engender you to open source builders are things like this where you're the gatekeeper, where you're the arbitrator of right versus wrong, where you're doing things that are vindictive. And so yeah, I mean, I don't think that this will be the last that we hear of know, regulators find out about things in a lot of the same ways that we do. They read things on the Internet. They look at headlines on the Wall Street Journal, on various websites. So they're going to see this. And yeah, I mean, for all of the denials that Amin issued, the videos are just awful and they point to a pretty black and white case and we'll see what happens with yeah, I mean, we shouldn't be encouraging this type of stuff and we shouldn't just be taking these denials at face value.
00:11:49.490 - 00:12:26.140, Speaker D: One of the things that I kind of want to double click on and totally agree with what Van said, we should self regulate our way out of this. But I think that that's kind of the only stance that we can take at this point. And I feel like the industry has actually been doing a pretty good job of this so far. We've gotten rid of some pretty tasty characters over the last few months. It's quite a list, but I think it really is. The hit list is huge. Why do you think that is? I guess is kind of the question that I'm asking.
00:12:26.140 - 00:13:14.650, Speaker D: My visceral reaction to my own question is you're dealing with basically religious perspectives because there's money involved. And if this was just like open source technology and it was like one platform versus another, or one company versus another, I feel like it would be less just painful or less dogmatic. But because it is involving money, I feel like that's something different. And it kind of goes back to and I know we're going to talk about it later, but Rune's perspective of the door is closed and we've already lost in a lot of ways and we can debate that later on in this conversation. But he's, you know, basically we have financial incentives here and we just continue to blow ourselves up because of human greed.
00:13:15.870 - 00:14:12.270, Speaker C: I think I take a different approach, actually, on this whole avalanche case. This is not specific to like this is something that's been happening since the dawn of time. And you look at I had a bunch of friends probably similar to you guys, because you guys were like product people in San Francisco back in the day who are at Uber and Lyft, right? And like Uber had operations slog where they would literally in 2014 or 15 or 16 in the early days, where they would literally have Uber people who would get credit cards funded by Uber and then they'd create fake Lyft accounts as drivers, excuse me, as riders. And then they'd order Lyfts, and then they would basically no show the Lyft drivers. So the Lyft drivers would get all pissed off with Lyft, and then they'd go back and start using Uber. So there are these backdoor things, and even, like, Rockefeller, right back in the days of standard oils so that the regulators didn't come after him. He would basically direct the regulators and be like, here's something that my competitor is doing that's really slimy.
00:14:12.270 - 00:14:24.270, Speaker C: It's shady, it's not right, but it's not specific to crypto. It's something that's been happening at the highest levels of business, I would say forever.
00:14:25.250 - 00:14:54.874, Speaker B: I just felt like I was watching dirty laundry get aired. I just don't think anyone just kind of like when you watch a boyfriend and a girlfriend get really hammered and then fight at a party and you're like, I don't even know whose side I'm on. I just want this to stop, please. I just don't like what I'm seeing here because some of it didn't stand up to me. Some of know this, believe the way he was portraying it. It was like, he's the know, the marionette, like, pulling the strings at the SEC and CFTC. I was like, I don't buy that.
00:14:54.874 - 00:15:03.322, Speaker B: I don't think that's how that so, like, that wasn't really standing up to but, like, I didn't love the response from the it was just a weird.
00:15:03.386 - 00:15:13.780, Speaker C: Also just I mean, I just don't trust this. Whatever. That's very suspect whatever I'm looking at. So just got to flag that.
00:15:15.350 - 00:15:31.170, Speaker D: One of the interesting angles here is he's been removed as one of the lawyers on a number of different cases that are currently ongoing. The tentacles run deep for Kyle, which is kind of funny.
00:15:33.210 - 00:16:02.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I kind of think it's a dirty laundry. If it is true, then, yeah, it obviously goes without saying. It's just a super uncool move and just not becoming. I think I think one of the things that might be, like, even Mark Benioff, right? He did all this crazy stuff with the media right when he was building salesforce. But it's a little bit different in crypto. We're still so early stage, and there's a huge focus on community that there might not have been for other. I don't get the feeling that Rockefeller was like, let me build a community around this oil company.
00:16:04.530 - 00:16:30.826, Speaker C: You said salesforce, benioff at the beginning, there was no SaaS industry. There used to be no SaaS industry until salesforce salesforce would literally salesforce would literally hire protesters, like fake protesters, and they would go protest outside of Oracle conferences and stuff. He'd hire hundreds of people, and they were protesters, but really, they were just paid for by just I don't not I'm not for it.
00:16:30.848 - 00:16:33.706, Speaker A: I'm just saying this is how the sausage gets made.
00:16:33.808 - 00:16:39.290, Speaker B: Yeah. Now you're getting some direct insight into blockworks's line item opex.
00:16:44.350 - 00:17:07.486, Speaker A: I don't think last cycle we did a good job of being self regulating. We didn't call out things, or at least when people did, it was just drowned out in a sea of people just making money. And so I don't know if I'm certainly not in favor of cancel culture or taking Kyle out of a job forever, but we should be trying to keep each other honest at a bare minimum. That feels like an okay goal.
00:17:07.678 - 00:17:30.718, Speaker B: I agree with that. All right, I'm going to start sharing my screen again. I want to get into this topic of value cool. Because we're going to move on. Talk about L two S and specifically Nitro's launch on Arbitrum, some of the activity that's going on there. But I want you guys to guess, if you guys had to guess, some of the D Five majors, like Compound, Ave, Uniswap, let's say, last two years of performance relative to ETH, how do you think?
00:17:30.724 - 00:17:37.760, Speaker A: They did say probably down 50% or 60%, maybe more. Last two years.
00:17:39.970 - 00:17:47.074, Speaker B: Last two years, I'd say since October 2022. So almost two years. October 2020.
00:17:47.112 - 00:17:51.220, Speaker D: Wait, since October 2020? Yeah.
00:17:52.470 - 00:17:56.054, Speaker A: Well, I would say down probably 50%.
00:17:56.252 - 00:17:59.240, Speaker C: I think October 2020 is a bad time.
00:18:00.490 - 00:18:09.082, Speaker D: Yeah, because that was post DFI summer. That'd be a tough benchmark to hit. I'm going to say up.
00:18:09.136 - 00:18:13.434, Speaker B: Wow. We got pretty big spread so far. We got negative 50 and up.
00:18:13.552 - 00:18:22.942, Speaker D: What I'd say even because I think ETH was pretty high back then, if I recall. But I could be off.
00:18:23.076 - 00:18:24.000, Speaker B: Yeah, no.
00:18:25.650 - 00:18:28.606, Speaker C: Haven't both of them round tripped since October 2020?
00:18:28.788 - 00:18:29.290, Speaker B: Essentially?
00:18:29.370 - 00:18:42.820, Speaker C: No, I think D Five is down. I think like, Ave and Comp and Uni are down relative to relative to ETH. I think ETH was at like 300 or 400 or $500 1500. Today Ave is probably down.
00:18:43.510 - 00:18:46.182, Speaker B: I make your guess because I shared my screen too quickly.
00:18:46.236 - 00:18:49.030, Speaker C: It's down. DeFi is down. DeFi is down relative to ETH.
00:18:49.450 - 00:19:02.506, Speaker B: These are the numbers here. It's like not great. It's not great. So if you're not following so Ave is the leader. It's down about 52%. Then it's uniswap at 67. Maker down 70.
00:19:02.506 - 00:19:08.810, Speaker B: Curve 71. Comp is down 91.86%. It's not great.
00:19:08.880 - 00:19:11.034, Speaker C: Comp is down 91% relative to E.
00:19:11.072 - 00:19:48.322, Speaker B: Yeah, the reason I picked this is two years. It's about even, and this is as far back as it goes on Trading View. So it's the easiest way that I can do it. But if you go back that's my scientific method, but if you go back, you can look at Coin Gecko and just look at charts of Maker Denominating ETH, you go all the way back to 2018 or whatever they launched, and it's like a straight. The reason this got flagged is I saw on Twitter, maker denominating ETH is like the almost the lowest it's ever been, basically. So basically, DFI as a sector is kind of bottomed out. I think it kind of raises larger questions about value accrual.
00:19:48.322 - 00:20:01.994, Speaker B: And also, I mean, we're going to talk about say as well, but why it's still such a good bet to bet on L ones. Actually, I'd be interested to see if this same pattern holds up with Salana and some of the DApps that are built on there, I have no idea.
00:20:02.112 - 00:20:38.070, Speaker C: I don't think the l One trade is there anymore. Actually, I think what happened is the l One trade happened in the last bull cycle, was like, the l One cycle kicked it off, kicked everything, or it was like DFI summer, and then everything rotated into these L ones and like, salana ripped and then avalanche. And I think what's happening now is you have all these, like, the Aptos and suities. There's going to be like 40 L ones going into the next cycle, and I think there's going to be people chasing the l One trade. But the l One trade is going to get instead of getting spread out over near Salana avalanche, it's going to get spread out over like, 40 different L ones, and the trade won't be as intense.
00:20:40.190 - 00:21:03.198, Speaker D: But I actually disagree to a certain extent because I actually think that if you look at anything in Crypto right now, where is the most value aggregating and this is to Mike's point, it's aggregating the L ones. And if you're raising $5 million for probably, I don't know, let's say like 510, 15% of the tokens, it's a pretty good bet to make to be.
00:21:03.204 - 00:21:04.554, Speaker A: Able to buy what L One raises.
00:21:04.602 - 00:21:06.000, Speaker C: $5 million right now.
00:21:06.370 - 00:21:27.480, Speaker B: That's what say raised. Yeah, I don't know. Say is pretty interesting. I don't know. Maybe we should I'm jumping around a little bit, but maybe we should talk about that because I feel like the reason why that might be worth bringing up is it made a pretty interesting trade off, especially when it comes to, like there's a big debate, right? Central limit order book versus AMMS in general. But just to give you guys kind of like the rundown for what happened. So this is a new l one.
00:21:27.480 - 00:21:56.314, Speaker B: They raised $5 million. It's an l One blockchain that's optimized for DFI. So it's not an app specific chain and it's not a generalized L One blockchain. It's kind of this mix in between. So it raised 5 million in funding. It was led by multicoin with participation round robin of kind of blue chips like Coinbase Ventures, Delphi, Digital, hudson River Trading, GSR, et cetera, basically, in their words here. So most L ones fall into like, a barbell type distribution.
00:21:56.314 - 00:22:51.934, Speaker B: You've got two extremes. So the general purpose chains and that's like ETH and Salana. Then you've got app specific chains like what dYdX is trying to do, and you've also got Osmosis in the Cosmos ecosystem. And basically, the way I understand it, the limitation is, in a general purpose blockchain like Salana, even if you have low fees, if it's a successful blockchain at all, it attracts a whole bunch of other activity outside of just DeFi, right? So maybe on Solana, it was like the NFTs, when you have that congestion in the block, space fees go up, and that naturally disrupts some of basically the DFI type purposes. And so then you have kind of like these app specific chains, which is what dYdX is trying to do on Cosmos, but then Say takes a little bit of an in between where it's actually not totally general purpose. L One, they've got like a built in order matching engine, but actually they're trying to make it very easy to spin up central limit order book markets on that chain.
00:22:51.982 - 00:22:52.146, Speaker C: Right?
00:22:52.168 - 00:22:57.090, Speaker B: So it's not like you go to, say, exchange. They're trying to make it very easy for you to spin up separate markets.
00:22:57.830 - 00:23:09.622, Speaker C: I'm sorry, why is this not you might have just explained it, but middle of the bell curve here. Why is this not solana? What Solana tried to do, Michael's, like, it is, baby.
00:23:09.686 - 00:23:12.794, Speaker B: It is solana. I mean, I'm just going to call.
00:23:12.832 - 00:23:40.930, Speaker C: It how I see it, which is like, this feels like Multicoin taking another shot on Goal. This was their blog post for the Solana investment. You can build central limit order books and spot and derivatives trading. You can't do all that stuff on chain now, but you can do it on chain if you can build something that looks like Solana. And now it's two years later and I'm down with Say, I'm down with more ones. I just feel like we should say what it is, which is Multicoin taking another shot on Goal.
00:23:41.510 - 00:23:46.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, don't want to dog Kyle or in Tushar for it. We like those guys.
00:23:47.450 - 00:23:49.400, Speaker C: No, I don't think it's a bad thing. By the way.
00:23:52.570 - 00:24:15.226, Speaker A: I'm not for it. I'm not against it. I'm mostly just like, who cares? We've been around long enough and we see literally like 2000, 3000 pitches per year. Most of them are not L ones, but like, a good chunk of them are. And some of them are L Two S, and some of them are variations. And we've literally heard everything. Parachains app chains, scales via hardware, scales via L Two, scales via subnets.
00:24:15.226 - 00:24:16.234, Speaker A: It's written in JavaScript.
00:24:16.282 - 00:24:16.880, Speaker C: Whatever.
00:24:17.890 - 00:24:59.578, Speaker A: Who cares? Who's actually going to use this thing? How is it going to get distribution? And the reason why we are so interested in things like ETH and Bitcoin, to a lesser extent, is because they have not only this technology angle, but they have the call option of being money. And that is like the fundamentally mispriced option, which is that's how these assets get to trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of scale. And there's this concept of the window. Okay? A year ago, a year and a half ago, e fees were high. The scaling roadmap was far away. The alt L ones were hot on their tail. The window was wide open.
00:24:59.578 - 00:25:39.862, Speaker A: Flash forward to today. Most of the transaction fees on these L Two S are ten cents. And it's really easy to build your own L Two side chain that transitions into an L Two. Why would you not just do that, all things considered. And I think the answer is basically, well, the incentives are to become your own L one because that's where the highest market cap could be. But that window, in our opinion, is basically closed if 4844 gets put in. And that's basically this improvement proposal which lowers the cost of putting call data on chain, what's the point of doing this other stuff? And it's not like a funding round gets announced, three months later the blockchain is out.
00:25:39.862 - 00:26:03.600, Speaker A: Six months later it's in mainnet, it's like the funding gets announced a year later, it's like ready for alpha. A year later it's got like tools. A year later you got the community. That's way. Far in the future, if we're all just investing in picks and shovels, nobody's ever going to find gold. And I really would like to see the venture industry specifically move more towards the application layer. And I think that's where it's going.
00:26:03.600 - 00:26:21.270, Speaker A: Time was whoever had the most technical investors would probably be the best venture firm in crypto. That's what drove outperformance. But I think you're moving in a fundamentally different direction. You have to play more at the app layer. And funding all L ones right now feels like you're kind of fighting the last war, which is just going to be increasingly less relevant.
00:26:21.690 - 00:26:36.300, Speaker C: It's also just we can't have another cycle where we just fund L ones because we're going to have another cycle where there's no quote unquote adoption that comes. It's probably not good for your portfolio, but it's also really not good for the space to just keep funding these L ones.
00:26:37.950 - 00:27:32.400, Speaker D: The one caveat that I would give is there is this intermediate time period right now where a lot of all L ones have been funded. There's all the different modular blockchain examples, but you're literally in a race against time for the scaling of other major blockchains L ones. Smart contracts with L two S that have scaling to really scale. And that's what EIP 4844 does. I mean, Nitro just launched yesterday on Arbitrum and I saw where we were talking about it, but like $0.06 is the transaction fee with EIP 4844 that goes down to subscent layer. And once you have that, it's really going to be hard to compete with the security model of Ethereum, the community of Ethereum, and frankly, the apps and development and tooling that has already been happening on Ethereum for the last six years.
00:27:33.010 - 00:27:38.160, Speaker C: I know you guys are all in on ETH. Can I push you guys to take the other side of the argument? Sure.
00:27:40.530 - 00:28:15.370, Speaker A: The other side of the argument is at least I would start with this. I would say the intervening year that's about to happen doesn't matter. It's going to be kind of like flat to bearish. There's not going to be any blockchains that hit these hyper adoption moments like Eats network effects are not likely to grow. And so you would kind. Of draw a line from that to saying all right, the network effects are relatively weak, we can easily replicate a DeFi ecosystem. NFTs are harder.
00:28:15.370 - 00:28:53.240, Speaker A: You basically have to that's a function of time effectively building an NFT ecosystem and maybe we can peel off a few games and if those games hit instantly, we have the biggest blockchain with the most amount of users. And I think the thing that's most exciting about Say if I were the people who invested in it would probably be the valuation. It's a cheap call option on all of that happening and at a certain price it is priced right to happen. But you have to think probabilistically as an investor and that's why this does make sense in some contexts. But yeah.
00:28:55.770 - 00:29:36.146, Speaker D: I'd also add that the major difference between something that you're constructing from the ground up now versus something that's been around since 2015 is frankly just tech debt. The amount of time and energy spent actually trying to pull off a major change like the merge that is supposedly going to happen in the next two weeks is just orders of attitude harder based on the stuff that you have to go through to get it to the point that it is now, with it also being live and at the scale that it is today and has been for the last few years. So there is a really strong argument to be made around just being able to move faster because you don't have mean that is totally fair is not.
00:29:36.168 - 00:30:05.120, Speaker A: Available to people who make this argument anymore. That used to be was like when Solana came out, it was like there's new types of applications that can be built on Solana that cannot be built on Ethereum and that was some as people who hold like that was like oh shit, this could run away from us pretty quickly. But again, it comes back to that concept of the window and the window for that type of differentiation is basically over and so what is it now? That's a little bit harder of a question to answer now versus a year ago.
00:30:07.010 - 00:30:58.362, Speaker B: I guess my question because Jason go back all the way to what you said is Say just another Solana? I mean the difference there is that Solana is a completely permissionless general purpose blockchain. So you have other applications that aren't necessarily DFI whereas Say is optimized for it's optimized for DFI applications, right? So you don't get a lot of that clogging. They've built some pretty interesting stuff in there. They've kind of solved the front running issue of MEB like the transactions per second that they have, it's something like 7300 transactions per second versus dYdX is 500. If I had to strongly on the argument for that as well, I'd say a lot of the unlocks how they come in cost reductions in other industries like biotech, like the cost of sequencing a genome went from like I forget some enormous amount. It took like multiple years and now you can do it for like $500. That's a huge unlock.
00:30:58.362 - 00:31:14.740, Speaker B: I think if you optimize entirely for speed and you make some trade offs, but you optimize for speed, then you get a whole bunch of unlocks that are hard to understand now that's the whole business model behind high frequency trading is you have to order. Sorry, Michael, you look like you're going to say something. What's going on?
00:31:15.990 - 00:32:11.202, Speaker D: Well, I was going to ask the question like, yeah, sequencing the genome is sequencing the genome. And if you have the ability to do that at an orders of magnitude lower cost, it's hugely valuable. Implicit in the question though, in this context is the question, does a central limit order book maintain its position as the most preferred way of trading? Or is it something like an AMM or frankly, something new that hasn't existed yet but is now enabled by a blockchain that is the dominant way that we trade for crypto. And look at the traditional financial industry. The dominant trading pattern is options, but think of options relative to perps when it comes to crypto. And we do have new models, new trading methodologies that are just different for this industry. So one of the questions that I kind of maybe posed the entire group is like, is the central limit order book something that we're going to continue to have at the same volume that we've had in traditional markets?
00:32:11.346 - 00:32:52.786, Speaker B: It's hard for me to answer that. Apparently the volume of high frequency traders versus regular organic flow is something like 25 times to one or something like that. So the business model of exchanges basically exist around it's a central limit order book they cater to and they allow those high frequency traders to basically trade more cheaply in exchange for providing liquidity. I don't know if that's the only model, but I think you need to come up with something like liquidity is good for markets in general. So I think if you're going to say, all right, we don't need to do it with a central limit order book anymore, instead it's going to be maybe concentrated liquidity on the AMM space. Like Univ Three is pretty interesting, frankly, but I think you need to come up with something that replaces that is the only thing I say. But I'm not bell curve guy.
00:32:52.786 - 00:32:54.930, Speaker B: I'm not sure what that is exactly.
00:32:55.080 - 00:33:32.586, Speaker A: The two questions that I ask when you ask that question to me are basically what's the differentiated functionality of an AMM versus an order book? And I think AMMS have great product market fit for the long tail of assets. Like you can spin it up, especially Uni V Two provide liquidity. Bob's your uncle it's, trading it's, live it's, whatever. That's a great use case that literally is not available for central limit order books. And for the things that have a little bit more scale like Univ Three. It's challenging to be an LP there. We've done a lot of analysis which suggests you're basically break even in permanent loss versus fees, if not negative.
00:33:32.586 - 00:34:24.260, Speaker A: But that's a great way that you can do sizable block trades in the same way as a central limit order book and get about the same execution. And then I think about like, okay, is it better on price? And AMMS are probably not quite as good on price, but looking back at the historicals everything that we know about crypto and retail, interacting with crypto would suggest that they are very fee insensitive. That is not the thing that matters the most to them. They're willing to pay 2% for NFTs. So at the highest level of scale, at the finance level, where you're doing like tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of volume per day, per month, whatever, you probably do need a central limit order book as that anchor. But for the rest of the ecosystem, to me, it's like, who cares? Serum is great, but who cares who uses it? Do people want to use the Orca decks instead? Like all of the stepping people?
00:34:27.590 - 00:34:28.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:28.632 - 00:34:30.270, Speaker B: Why do they use orca?
00:34:30.430 - 00:34:32.420, Speaker A: It's a good question. I don't know.
00:34:34.150 - 00:34:34.926, Speaker B: What's up, Dana?
00:34:34.958 - 00:34:37.250, Speaker C: Well, because they're stepping people and they rebranded the right.
00:34:37.320 - 00:34:42.520, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I think they might have started their own decks too. Maybe that's no longer the case.
00:34:44.730 - 00:35:26.946, Speaker C: I know I was kind of ragging on saying we can move on from saying a second, but if this was a non crypto company, I actually probably might like it because I'm going to try to play devil's advocate to what I'm saying, which is and try to take the other side of the argument. If there was like a cloud provider that came into the market and they were like, all right, we're going to go head to head with Google, Amazon and Microsoft, I was like, great. Who are your early customers? You're going to target? Who are you going after? And they're like, oh, everyone. SaaS companies, gaming, finance. I'd be like, all right, well, there's no way you're winning. You have no chance. And I think what Say is doing is they're like all that other stuff, other people can go win it, but NFTs go do that somewhere else.
00:35:26.946 - 00:35:41.482, Speaker C: And honestly, it's probably pretty smart. Like a poorly designed NFT Mint can consume all the block space and kind of ruin DeFi for a couple of days on a blockchain. And so, yeah, that's probably the counterargument, is like hyper focused companies and founders usually do win.
00:35:41.536 - 00:35:46.940, Speaker A: That's true. I'm also very bullish on poorly designed NFT Mints because they just burn a lot of.
00:35:49.310 - 00:36:31.286, Speaker B: Burn, baby, burn. Let's move on, because I had this up here and we weren't even looking at but I want to get your guys take on Arbitrum, maybe in relation to optimism as well. So Nitro got rolled out, which is basically an enormous improvement. I guess actually we should start with Odyssey, which was Odyssey I think was a pretty interesting initiative that was rolled out by Arbitram. It was basically like, to paraphrase, it was essentially a scavenger hunt that Arbitram was basically it was trying to put its users through. Say, hey, there are going to be these 56 the top apps that are going to be grouped in this thing and you should go use all of these different things, right? Like decentralized exchanges and whatever, and you essentially have the ability to earn these. NFTs.
00:36:31.286 - 00:37:13.778, Speaker B: This was rolled out in June. It was live for about a week. Then they had to pause it because the fees to transact on Optimism or on Arbitrum were actually higher than Ethereum. So basically they had this big announcement we're going to pause and you can actually see it. I'll share my screen again in the spikes on this chart, but they paused Odyssey and they just rolled out Nitro, which is an enormous increase in terms of transaction throughput. So it's like six to ten times, increased it by almost a full order of magnitude. And they've kind of moved in lockstep here, but it looks like they're starting to win, right? So transactions per day is flipped, transacting addresses per day is flipped.
00:37:13.778 - 00:37:25.930, Speaker B: Between Arbitrum and Optimism, I'm curious if you guys have and some of the projects as well, like GMX is kind of the standout on Arbitrum. I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts on just Arbitrum versus optimism in general, or just, I guess the Arbitrum ecosystem.
00:37:26.990 - 00:37:58.040, Speaker C: I will just say Vance and Michael are going to have much better takes on this than I do. But I think when you look at these charts today, in two years, you're saying, oh, the transaction slipped. When you look at these charts in two years, these are going to be like the smallest little blips on the chart. So optimism will probably flip back and overtake Arbitram at some point. Then it'll flip back, then it'll flip back, and these will just be like, we're at 0.1% of the transactions that will end up happening on L Two. So I know where you're getting at, I just wouldn't spend too much time on this.
00:37:58.490 - 00:38:41.406, Speaker D: Yes, that was literally going to be my first reaction, is it feels like we zoomed into the 2013 bubble and crash on the price chart and it'd be nice to zoom out a couple of years and be able to see where we actually are. I mean, we were talking about it earlier, but EIP 14844 is going to be something that ten to 100 x's the amount of cost or decreases the amount of cost for call data on L one. Assuming that goes in, assuming it works the way that it is supposed to work. This stuff here is kind of moot, but I also agree. I think this is just going to be a dogfight. And you can literally see it in the transaction fees or the transacting addresses. It's just going to bounce back and forth.
00:38:41.406 - 00:39:35.060, Speaker D: The thing that will be the difference maker, though, is where applications aggregate. So you've got certain applications that are optimism only, you've got others that are arbitram only. Do you have the ability to have cross Arbitrum optimism and have that be a seamless experience? If that's the case, it's going to be really who's who. The other angle that I think is really interesting as well is, is there going to be a centralized bridge to be able to get from L One to L Two right now? If you pull your assets off of and I don't know, arbitram, I've done it personally recently on optimism, still takes seven days. You're waiting seven days to be able to pull assets off of optimism. If you can have that be something that is a centralized bridge, and there's just market makers that can ARB that away and get you assets immediately, or you can trust the process, that is a great thing. But for seven days, you're basically waiting for things to disappear and then come back.
00:39:35.060 - 00:39:37.310, Speaker D: It's a weird feeling for a blockchain.
00:39:37.470 - 00:40:25.122, Speaker A: When we were looking at Gem versus Genie back in the day, I remember all the Twitter peanut gallery was like, oh, man, it's over. Gem is way in the lead, they're blowing them out. And it looked that way if you pulled up Dune. But then if you dug into the amount of users, it was like Gem had like 60 more users than Genie and they had like 100 total combined CT. To your point, Jason kind of tries to call everything early. I think my unique perspectives on this are the seven day withdrawal window makes these things kind of like one way bridges. Getting your stuff off of these chains is very hard, and we've done it, but it kind of makes the nature of them one directional, and it's just going to be this thing that sucks in a ton of users and they don't really leave.
00:40:25.122 - 00:40:42.394, Speaker A: And the way I think about Ethel One and the continuing value accrual there is like number one, DFI and NFTs are extraordinarily sticky for Ethel One whales, and that's kind of like where the three to 4K ETH fees per day are going to come from in the next six or twelve months.
00:40:42.512 - 00:40:43.850, Speaker D: That's what we're guessing.
00:40:44.430 - 00:42:06.114, Speaker A: But number two, now that we understand at some sort of scale what the cost dynamics for these blockchains are, we can understand what's valuable about this emerging kind of thesis of the modular blockchain stack. And so if you look at, say, arbitram transactions are a dollar each, I'm paraphrasing Polina, who's a great Twitter follow if you don't follow him, about 30 or about 55% are just like, paying for arbitram fees of that dollar. So $0.55, about $0.40 are for paying for data availability and posting call data to L One and then 1% is just paying for or like a very small percentage of that dollars is actually for paying for settlement on L One. And so you're actually starting to understand what is valuable, what are people willing to pay for? Is it the settlement layer, is it the data availability? What is it exactly? And that's very interesting to me because I think eventually we're going to have to come to some sort of consensus as to, all right, what is the minimum that these L Two S can pay these L ones and still claim to be affiliated with the Ethereum community, to have this credible decentralization. Because you're always going to have this push and pull between people who are holding arbitram or optimism tokens who wants the value of cruel to flow to that versus the people who want to continue paying relatively high amounts for settlement and data availability on the L One.
00:42:06.114 - 00:42:13.240, Speaker A: So it's interesting to get this early kind of feedback on exactly what that value cruel dynamic is and could potentially be.
00:42:15.290 - 00:42:57.560, Speaker B: I think it's kind of interesting to look at. I mean, the big difference, I point taken, we are zooming in on a really small period of time. But the big difference, I would say right now in between, it's just like their acquisition strategy because optimism actually has a token and they're doling out incentives like left, right and center, which is why you see those enormous spikes, whereas Arbitrum has kind of a different strategy where they're I mean, I guess the NFTs are an incentive. As really I mean the real reason why Odyssey was so popular was there was the idea of incentives in the future like potential airdrops of the Arbitrum token. Everyone's basically taking it as a given. So I do think it's kind of interesting just looking at I mean, people are trying out new strategies for go to market, for how to migrate users from ETH to this L Two versus the other L Two. It's kind of interesting.
00:42:59.530 - 00:43:06.118, Speaker D: I don't know why, but I just got really strong Rob Hanneman vibes. Ross hanneman revenue. Pure play.
00:43:06.204 - 00:43:07.846, Speaker B: Never. Yeah. Never.
00:43:07.868 - 00:43:09.580, Speaker D: Get Russ Hanneman. There we go.
00:43:14.750 - 00:43:27.440, Speaker A: Dream value of having a token. You can get 90% of that by just telling people like, you're going to have one in the future or will AirDrop it's. Like you don't need to actually use it, you just need to tell people you have it.
00:43:29.250 - 00:43:33.966, Speaker B: So basically you're like dangling the meat in front of the dog, basically hoping that the dog jumps.
00:43:33.998 - 00:43:40.930, Speaker C: Yeah, honestly, I have heard that subscribers of Bel Curve could get a token. So if you're listening.
00:43:45.050 - 00:44:48.534, Speaker D: Nice token aside, I think the biggest thing that we're going to see summing up this whole L Two discussion, or frankly, even just like execution discussion where people are transacting or choosing to use the applications, it all comes down to price. And if you have lower prices, not only is it just easier to use, obviously less expensive, but it opens the aperture lens of what applications actually can be built on these chains. And one of the interesting things that Vance and I talked about a lot in I think it was like 2020, 2021 was basically if you have a ten X decrease in fees, what do you think happens to the revenue that's flowing through, like price times quantity? It actually increases because you have more transactions at lower costs than you would if you had higher costs. I think as we see these decreases of ten X, like I think we saw with Nitro or whatever it is, six X, you're going to see more activity aggregate there just because the fact.
00:44:48.572 - 00:45:37.382, Speaker A: The other thing I would say, going back to the say, discussion, like, what would be the counterargument to being bearish? So you'd be bullish on, say, in this instance. I think one of them would be, yeah, cool, you fixed the scaling problem for the 20,000 users that are on Arbitrum and optimism today. But the second that you have a popular game with 10 million users, you're going to be right back in the bucket of like, okay, you didn't actually scale this. And that's kind of to Michael's point of if fees decrease, will people fill up that block space? Like the people we're filling, the people we're opening up block space for are like, game developers and people who have millions and millions of users. And frankly, we still have not tested that level of usage on any blockchain. Consistently. I would say ETH is around 500K daily active users per day.
00:45:37.382 - 00:45:41.660, Speaker A: Most of the major blockchains are half that two thirds of that.
00:45:45.070 - 00:46:37.210, Speaker B: All right, I want to move on to Maker. I think this is going to be kind of a meaty discussion, frankly. So Rune's been publishing multiple different, I guess, iterations of his version of Endgame, and he just came out with a pretty recent post. But I guess to sum everything up, I mean, there was a lot of attention that got paid to the OFAC sanctions, the treasury sanctions on different smart contract addresses. So Tornado Cash kind of got shot down. And then Rune, in the discord for Maker, said something to the effect of maybe we should just yolo into ETH and disregard the peg, which he kind of walked back, but now is kind of addressing more seriously and laying out a very specific vision for what he thinks the end game is for Maker. So we'll link the whole thing in the show notes here, but basically, to sum everything up from the TLDR that he posted, the title of the proposal is the Path of Compliance and Path of Decentralization why Maker Has No Choice But to Abandon the Peg.
00:46:37.210 - 00:47:33.018, Speaker B: He kind of describes it in like three different phases, right? So financial regulation has trended towards a post 911 paradigm. Either of you're with us or you're against us with eventual zero tolerance for anything that doesn't give full surveillance power, essentially over any sort of financial infrastructure in general, DFI has kind of failed to prove real value and demonstrate real value to, let's say, the masses, right? So obviously we got some sort of negative PR to put it lightly, with massive crashes around Terra and Celsius, even though Celsius wasn't. And actually Jason, we just did an interview with Kane and he did say that a lot of the even like the founder class in DeFi was kind of taken aback. They didn't really expect this severe of a crackdown at this period of time. So I think the whole community is sort of reeling with what to do. And the big challenge for Maker is that Dai, it can't become blacklistable. So basically Maker doesn't even have the option of being compliant.
00:47:33.018 - 00:48:23.850, Speaker B: So the solution that Rune is outlining here is to limit the attack service by limiting the amount of RWA, which is real world asset exposure that they have. And he's kind of freely admitting that the likely outcome of this would be, in his exact words, to cause Dai to free float away from USD at stable predictable rate. That feels like negative interest rates. And basically this endgame plan that he's outlined has two effective tools to deal with this metadals and protocol owned vault which is cryptospeak for balance sheet. There's like so much to unpack here. I actually tried to read the full thing and I felt like I was reading Chinese like 45 minutes in. I was like, dude, is this the same language? I have opinions on this, especially because I think there's a fundamental misalignment at the top of what Maker even really is.
00:48:23.850 - 00:48:26.042, Speaker B: But that's what I was going to say, Mike.
00:48:26.106 - 00:49:20.522, Speaker C: I think when you talk about the end, this is the second. Honestly, there have been many iterations of the endgame the endgame didn't. Now it's all about real world assets and censorship and free floating dai. But really the endgame plan started as just a conversation about how to structure what Maker Dow really is. You could use the word governance as the all encompassing word, but it's really not that right now, Maker is just this hodgepodge of core units that are just like it's very he. If you look at the end game plan, he uses this image of Google, or really Alphabet, right? Where it's like what he's trying to in his words, he's like, I want to transform Maker from this unclear structure into something where every aspect of Maker is very well documented, where people have KPIs and goals. And if you look at Google, it's like Alphabet owns Google X, Sidewalk Labs, google Ventures, Fiber, Google Capital, Nest.
00:49:20.522 - 00:49:52.954, Speaker C: Inside. One of those is Google. And Google owns Android and Maps and Ads and Search and YouTube. And then within YouTube you have YouTube kids and then you have the main YouTube. And each team has very strong KPIs and they have like a budget. And that's I think where all this came from. Which makes sense if you again trying to not think about this in crypto speak and RWAs and PSMs and Die and D three Ms, if you just think about this is a founder being like holy shit, my startup just went from ten people to 200 people.
00:49:52.954 - 00:50:03.550, Speaker C: It's so chaotic. I'm trying to wrangle this in that's what I'm seeing is a founder who's like, whoa, my startup just got really big, I need to think about organizational structure.
00:50:07.570 - 00:51:01.566, Speaker D: It's an interesting take. I mean, my reading of the tea leaves and I don't disagree with that because I don't think that they're mutually exclusive. But my take here is just let's roll back the tape of what Maker is, which is the first DeFi protocol and Dai is the first decentralized stablecoin to hit scale. Let's say. It may not be the first, but it's the first one to hit scale. And where you got to real world assets, which felt like an about Face for the entire direction of the protocol was what happened following March 2020 crash, where you needed to find stability, you needed to find new asset collateral to be able to add to the ecosystem. And so that's where you had the first vote to add USDC as one of these collateral types that you could put into Maker because you had to be able to have that to be able to stabilize Die following the crash and the outage and everything that happened during that period of time.
00:51:01.566 - 00:51:37.562, Speaker D: And now you have a continuation of that strategy where you have 100 million dollar off chain loan to the bank. And I can't remember the name, but that's another real world asset that is the first of its kind. But also that happened very recently. It's not like that was something that happened a year ago. And now you have a complete additional about face back to the original thesis of let's be fully decentralized, fully on chain. I think as he described in the post, his hands are tied in a lot of ways. So it does make sense to move in this direction at this point.
00:51:37.562 - 00:51:52.622, Speaker D: But it's been a lot of whipsawing back and forth. I think maybe it's a realization of this startup, this company that we're running. This organization is massive and need to have more structure to it's also. It also just feels very know.
00:51:52.676 - 00:52:52.018, Speaker A: Back in the day, Maker owned an exchange called Oasis that owned a broker dealer. Know Rune was going on CNBC as the CEO of Maker in a collared shirt. I remember that DevCon Osaka speech Michael He gave when he was like, we're going to TradFi all this stuff. And so it is a really different perspective and I think beyond the direction that Dai goes. Just for the record, I very much disagree with Roon about DeFi providing no value, the window being closed for these things to be regulated institutions, basically all of that stuff. We've only started engaging with regulators and legislators over the past year, and for the most know there's been definitely some people who push back, but there's a lot of people who are in our corner. And I think we're just waiting for a time know, the stars are aligned with the right administration, with the right balance of congress to actually get something done.
00:52:52.018 - 00:53:37.374, Speaker A: And Michael and I spent a lot of time helping push that forward. And so I don't think it's time to just roll over and die and just be like, okay, it's only going to be decentralized protocols from here on out and we're all going to be a non devs. That's very much not the future that I see for this asset class. And Michael shares that as well. In terms of the paths that these DeFi protocols take forward, like call it the OGS or whatever, I think one path is going into the window that Rune says is now closed or at least waiting for that window to reopen. And I think it's more of like a reopening concept where we're certainly not in the window where that can happen today. If Maker walked into the SEC and wanted to register with them, I just don't know how that would happen.
00:53:37.374 - 00:54:40.514, Speaker A: But in the future I think there is the potential for a legislative framework for that to very much be a possibility. But that's probably two or three years away. And so if you're playing for that regulated window to open, you're playing for some date that's a little bit further in the future and you need to be aligned with that. And places like know places that are also in the US that are in like they're very much going down that path and I think that will be a fruitful one for the people who don't want to do that, who are probably more international in terms of their basis in the countries they're located in. Maybe there is, maybe there isn't a way to register, maybe it doesn't even matter particularly. But I think a lot of the paths that they take, these international DeFi OG protocols will be kind of like this fully crypto native version of what they're doing that's just reliant on the endogenous growth of crypto. Like if Maker gets a bunch of USDC in their vaults and they really own it and they start paying down the debt of the vault owners and ETH starts mooning, that's going to be a very powerful protocol and they have the potential to draw in a lot of ETH.
00:54:40.514 - 00:55:11.582, Speaker A: And so you're just betting on the endogenous growth of ETH and the desire for truly permissionless systems, which is lumpy, but it's very important. Yeah, the last kind of unique perspective I think I have on this is like if you really dig into the economics and the mechanisms of how this proposal works. It's kind of like a DeFi Summer style playbook. It's like, yes, we're going to DPEG, we're going to get a bunch of money in the vaults. We're going to go off and yield farm with it. We're going to go pay off people's debts with that. It's like, okay, this is kind of almost like alchemyx in a way.
00:55:11.582 - 00:55:47.882, Speaker A: And I think that's cool and I think it's definitely a departure from the Maker that we know where it's like Rune in a collared shirt on CNBC. Maker kind of just like not doing anything for a year, two years. If you play back the tape on DeFi summer. Last time they missed like they were not a part of that cohort. And so yeah, I mean, at the end of the day it comes down to what does your team want to do and what are they good at. And for a loosely affiliated group of contributors that are not based in the US. That want to run this crypto anarchist playbook, this seems like kind of the only direction you can go in time.
00:55:47.882 - 00:56:02.400, Speaker A: Like Rune at the beginning of his post says that the earliest this could happen is three years. So this is them getting kind of in their ready set ghost dance. But yeah, I think it's an awesome discussion and it leaves a lot for other DeFi founders to consider.
00:56:06.870 - 00:57:20.710, Speaker B: I agree with parts of that. I think the one thing that I would say is the product in my vision of Maker is something that is supposed to be a dollar, right? You're supposed to look at this and be like, everything that Maker is doing is in service of creating something that is a dollar and it is at least of stable value. So it kind of like as me because I do think it's cool to experiment with new economic models and like, hey, could we yield Farm some of this and give rewards back? But the way that I would think about it if I had to denominate my entire life in maker all these assets that I have all my wealth is denominated in Dai now instead of US dollars, I would kind of have the perspective of like, yeah, back that shit up with something know? Probably back that up. Probably don't do any of that stuff, actually. Probably just put dollars in not, I'm not saying that because I see the problem with the real world asset as well. Actually, Jason, maybe to carry your analogy of being a Founder a little bit further, if I was Rune, I think I'm not Rune, obviously, but I guess if I was sitting in his seat and, like, deeply believed in the ethos that I believe that he has right. Which is trying to create a decentralized stablecoin that's separate from real world assets, but then you're also, like, he ran up against the limits of where he was in time.
00:57:20.710 - 00:57:53.774, Speaker B: Right. Which was that there wasn't enough demand to mint die against ETH. So he had to, in order to grow the protocol and have it survive, he needed to find other collateral, another source of collateral. And it's like, this is where my ideology and what I want to build runs up the rubber meets the road in terms of what options I have as a founder and what I have to do. And I kind of think that he made the only choice that he could at that moment in time. And this is where a butterfly flaps its wings. And maybe if he had been doing it five years later and there was more solid collateral, like, ETH was an order of magnitude larger, even Bitcoin or other crypto assets, he had more options, then he could have taken a different path.
00:57:53.774 - 00:57:54.420, Speaker B: But.
00:57:56.970 - 00:58:29.034, Speaker C: I don't think Rune wants to DPEG. I don't think that he wants to to. I think he is trying to like, if you go in the maker discord and you spend a lot of time in the maker discord and you're on the forums, the core group of people who hang out in there are very like, maker needs to be self sustaining. Maker can't have real world assets. Maker cannot get censored. And so you have to appeal to that group. So what he did, I think what he just did in this thing earlier this week was very smart.
00:58:29.034 - 00:58:59.606, Speaker C: He said for three years, basically, we want to accumulate like Max ETH. He called it. And we can do that by getting unlimited real world asset exposure. Then he said, we can keep the peg for three years, but we can go longer if there's no authoritarian threat. And then he said, we can delay the free float of collateral if we're at least 75% decentralized. He's putting in all these things that are like, yeah, we're going to free float, but we won't free float if this and definitely the plan becomes censorship resistant. But we don't need to if they're not coming after us.
00:58:59.606 - 00:59:37.780, Speaker C: So I don't think he wants you never want to take the harder path as a founder. Like, building a company is hard enough, you want to take the easier route. So I think he's trying to appeal to the core group of basically employees who want something. But he's like, I don't know. I think he wants real world assets. And I also think that he's smart enough to know that if you get a shit ton of real world assets, maker is not like tornado cash. Like they censored tornado cash because 30 or 40% of transactions were from North Korea or some shit like that.
00:59:37.780 - 00:59:53.740, Speaker C: If your collateral is from Huntington Valley Bank, and then maybe in two years from like BlackRock, the regulators aren't coming after you, they're working with you. If BlackRock has put their stamp of approval on you, and I would assume Root is smart enough to understand that.
00:59:55.150 - 01:00:08.414, Speaker D: So then this begs the question where does the rest of OG DeFi go? Does it move in the direction of permissionless or does it move more permissioned? Or do you have to kind of float between the two to get to this end state of maybe both.
01:00:08.612 - 01:00:11.470, Speaker C: It goes offshore with VPNs.
01:00:14.710 - 01:01:16.338, Speaker A: I think that's one possibility. I think the broader thing that Maker is trying to figure out is what is its self sustaining economic model? And unless you have that at scale with the product that you're currently offering, which Maker? Frankly it has some, but it doesn't have a ton of cash flow from just the interest rates they charge, you need something else. And that's basically what he's saying is we got this thing, it's like generating some cash, not enough to cover everyone's expenses. And we also have this threat of the US government nuking us if we just got a bunch of ETH and we yield farmed with it and we did all this stuff and made the system more economically self sustaining because then we'd have assets we could earn yield on. That's what makes a full business that really can't be taken down and can pay expenses every year. And if you look at Maker, they're the most advantaged at the lending platforms because they have their own stablecoin, their cost of capital is the lowest. They can give people loans at a moment's notice, unlike Aave or Compound, which actually needs to source the USDC and then lend it out.
01:01:16.338 - 01:02:12.102, Speaker A: And so for me, this kind of begs the question to the other lending protocols. It's like, what are you guys going to do? And Ave is moving in this direction. They're issuing their own stablecoin that'll lower their cost of capital. But is that enough to build a large self sustaining business that can not only cover costs, but produce a ten or 20 or $30 billion market cap outcome, which is what the founders are shooting for. And so if I'm Ave, I'm thinking about, all right, do I need to staple something else onto my business model where I own the assets and I lend them out and I give that assets back to the Ave token holders? Compound, same thing. And so for me, this is a very lending specific question around the business models for things like derivatives and just spot AMMS. In general, I think it's more like derivatives, you only need like 30 large customers to make your exchange really work and profitable at scale for AMMS, it's more of a question of what your penetration rate is of the market.
01:02:12.102 - 01:02:30.090, Speaker A: But uniswap, if the fee switch was turned on, that token would be probably much larger. And so it's more of a question of the business models of these places than it is any. Like to Yana's point, is this really about the US government trying to nuke them or is this about their business model not being quite as attractive as people thought? And I think it might be the latter.
01:02:31.630 - 01:02:48.500, Speaker B: I have a question for you guys. When we're looking at those relative valuations like compound versus Aave, so Ave has done relatively better than compound over the course of the last, let's say two years. Do you attribute any percentage of that to Ave being based internationally and Rob living in the US.
01:02:49.030 - 01:03:24.854, Speaker D: Yes, absolutely. I think what this comes down to and what we're kind of implicitly saying here is your hands are somewhat tied if you're based in the US. And working within the confines of regulation. You just can't move as fast. It's either an approval basis where you have to ask permission to do a lot of different things, or you just know that things are going to be out of bounds if you're based in the US. Whereas in other jurisdictions the rules are different and that's just a fact of life. And Tiana's point about this whole thing DeFi moving out of the country and using VPNs, I think that that's one path.
01:03:24.854 - 01:04:12.122, Speaker D: I think that there will be a lot of that. I also think that there will be a lot of DFI that looks like public permission, DFI where some of these things will move in the direction of regulation, whatever the time period is to enable that, I don't know. As Vance said earlier, we started engaging regulators basically in the last twelve months. But over the course of, let's say years, which is the development cycle for a lot of these things, it will happen where you'll have broker dealers that are on chain, you'll have the ability to invoice factor accounts receivable in non DeFi, non crypto invoices that stuff will live on chain eventually. And so I think we're going to see two divergent paths. And that's kind of what Rune is getting at here, I think, is that he's basically calling like we're at the fork. I also agree.
01:04:12.122 - 01:04:24.190, Speaker D: I don't think we're at the fork yet. It's not a binary right now. I think you're going to have some that move in one direction and others that move in the opposite direction, but you can also kind of live in both worlds still. And the window is definitely not closed.
01:04:24.710 - 01:04:43.800, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll just say, like I said, moves offshore. It's VPN. I don't actually think all of it does that. I really do think that hopefully the regulators and policymakers start to understand this stuff and the innovation. I'm hopeful and Capital and the founders can stay in the US. But I think a lot of it, that is why the regulation is important.
01:04:44.570 - 01:04:53.094, Speaker B: You're going to be a father in five months. Would you advocate for your child to VPN if he was a founder?
01:04:53.222 - 01:04:56.380, Speaker C: I was waiting for you to bring up some kid joke on this.
01:04:56.830 - 01:05:06.800, Speaker B: Anna's getting married in three weeks. We're all taking over and unders on when the first kid is going to be here. I've got five months.
01:05:08.690 - 01:05:16.046, Speaker C: My group chat. All right, moving on.
01:05:16.068 - 01:05:47.834, Speaker B: All right, moving on, moving on. I got one more thing that I want to get your guys opinion on before we move on to memes, which is this ave proposal, which is temporary ETH pause on ETH borrowing. So, simple summary. Again, we'll link this in the show notes, but it's a proposal to pause ETH borrowing in the period leading up to the ETH merge. In addition, basically ahead of the merge, AVIC Protocol faces the risk of high utilization in the ETH market. Temporarily pausing ETH borrowing will mitigate the risk of high utilization. Basically, when you have an enormous amount of people that want to borrow ETH right.
01:05:47.834 - 01:06:16.910, Speaker B: Utilization goes up and then there's difficulty in terms of managing collateral and liquidations. So I guess when I'm looking at this, reading this, I think it's like a very fair move. And it's an order of magnitude better like that. This is being done out in the open and people are voting on it. But I also do remember when Robinhood kind of changed the rules on everything. There was like this whole uproar of, like, you guys are changing rules on things and everything like that. But maybe the difference is just that this is done in a super transparent way and with good rationale.
01:06:16.910 - 01:06:20.206, Speaker B: I don't know what you guys mean.
01:06:20.248 - 01:07:05.646, Speaker D: Obviously, this is one of the core advantages of DeFi the transparency. But isn't this just an ETH proof of work thing? Isn't this just like a mitigation of people trying to borrow a bunch of ETH so they can have it on chain to be able to get the snapshot? That's my read on this, which I think is fair and we should be pausing that. I also know that there are other protocols, at least synthetics. I know as well as Coinbase, who are going to be pausing ETH and ERC 20 transactions and movements ahead of a couple of hours before and a couple of hours after. I think that has to do more with, like, let's just batten down the hatches and ride this merge out. But I think this one in particular, borrowing ETH is a move against ETHW.
01:07:05.758 - 01:07:21.100, Speaker B: Yeah, most likely. All right, guys, I know we're winding down here. Anyone have any suggestions for Tweet of the Week? Meme of the week. Because I've got a couple. Wait, we didn't talk about Sailor at all, actually.
01:07:21.870 - 01:07:26.454, Speaker D: Yeah, I was about to say we're missing one big topic.
01:07:26.582 - 01:07:30.182, Speaker B: Is that the lead into Sailor or Vitalik's?
01:07:30.246 - 01:07:31.202, Speaker C: Vitalik.
01:07:31.366 - 01:07:52.766, Speaker B: He's back in a weapon. What an L week for bitcoin? We got hero sailor downtown. What a win for Mean. I don't really know what there is on the Tax Division thing. I mean, it seems like he wasn't paying the taxes, income tax in DC. Even though he was supposedly living there. But he also had these videos being like, I'll never pay my taxes.
01:07:52.766 - 01:07:54.606, Speaker B: I'll fake a boating accident.
01:07:54.798 - 01:07:55.540, Speaker A: Cool.
01:07:57.270 - 01:07:59.826, Speaker B: Let's see how that mean?
01:07:59.928 - 01:08:47.810, Speaker A: Yeah, just like all of the super cyclers have Know basically taken out and shot. And it's not surprising to see that Sailor has not only been kind of like, I don't know if he was forced out of MicroStrategy, but certainly his role has become diminished. And then this stuff basically all those insane podcasts that he did over the past two years. Side note, my favorite up only episode is Michael Sailor talking to Kobe because it's like Sailor interviewing Sailor on Sailor. It's like so like he's in his own head and crazy. And I think when you say crazy stuff on Know, it's going to get around. And it's not surprising and juxtaposing that with Vitalik and how he's just like the best possible unelected leader of ethereum that you could possibly ever get.
01:08:47.810 - 01:09:23.140, Speaker A: Like one of our LPs who's super into the Grateful Dead, thinks he's a lot like Jerry Garcia, where he's kind of like this guy who was this average dude and not really ever wanted to lead but was just chosen and placed atop a throne. And it's like he's walking through every day as if it was like his first day on the planet. It's like incredible. Great meme content. Obviously, the picture from this week is very demonstrative of my last point where some things just don't seem to register. But that's the best part of it. You just know that he doesn't really have a mean bone in his body and he's just uniquely well qualified for a number of reasons that he has.
01:09:25.030 - 01:09:56.266, Speaker D: One of our founders who is not vitalik. But I would say up there in terms of stature in a lot of ways once asked me who is memed more than about any other founder we could possibly think of. He asked me one time, he goes, why am I such a meme? And to this day, it still sticks in the back of my head. It's just like, do you think that people who are getting memed actually know it and think about it and react to if? I wonder what Vital's reaction was to.
01:09:56.288 - 01:10:21.678, Speaker A: This this week, because I remember the Sharding episode when we were all making those jokes on Twitter and being, ah, sharding sharding. It's like, okay. And he was like, I'm going to quit if you keep doing this. And one of the first tweets I saw after that got out was this guy named Statelayer who works at Pseudoswap being like, I'm not here for the Vitalik jokes. We're not making them this time. Like, if he leaves, I'm going to kill all of you. It's like, yes, protect Vitalik at all costs.
01:10:21.678 - 01:10:27.986, Speaker A: That's very much my mindset at the moment. Whatever he says know you could be.
01:10:28.008 - 01:10:39.020, Speaker B: Accused of worse things is what I will say for all right, guys, tweet of the Week. Do you guys have any suggestions? Any thoughts? Play of the Week, take the week.
01:10:41.470 - 01:10:44.060, Speaker D: My first one was going to be what we just talked about.
01:10:46.590 - 01:10:48.460, Speaker A: Let me see if I can find this one.
01:10:49.870 - 01:11:02.910, Speaker B: I've got one, too. While you're finding that right, I'm going to share my screen here. Actually, I'll just read it to you. This is the tweet. White smoke has emerged from the chimney atop north Hollywood high school signaling that Leonardo DiCaprio has chosen a new girlfriend.
01:11:09.110 - 01:11:18.038, Speaker D: I was literally about to say the one that I liked was tate winslet versus old version of tate winslet. 25 versus 26.
01:11:18.204 - 01:11:19.362, Speaker B: That's really funny.
01:11:19.506 - 01:11:20.790, Speaker C: This is my favorite.
01:11:21.770 - 01:11:23.480, Speaker A: Yes, I saw that one.
01:11:25.930 - 01:11:40.300, Speaker C: The guy sweating. The guy sweating, but choosing between two buttons, right? And you're up on the bottom. I'm just telling I know you guys can see it, but I'm telling folks who are listening starve but be woke. Turn on nuclear power plants. Can't make the decision between yet.
01:11:41.070 - 01:11:44.782, Speaker B: Yeah, that was a little dark because that one's playing out in real time.
01:11:44.916 - 01:11:46.240, Speaker C: I know, but it's real.
01:11:47.570 - 01:12:11.558, Speaker A: And this flew a little bit under the radar. I'm going to put this in the chat so we can share it. FUBAR, who's a great follow on twitter, there's this guy, Gabriel Layton, who came from machine zone. He was the CEO. He's now starting in web three. He's just been, like, terrorizing crypto twitter all week, and people have strong opinions about him. I'll kind of leave it at that.
01:12:11.558 - 01:12:48.980, Speaker A: But I thought Fubar's tweet captured it perfectly where he said, it's been a while since we had a cult founder out for blood. This time is different. When you become the main character of crypto twitter, there really is only one preordained outcome that we know of today, and that is know, things get crazy at some point and you get nuked. And so it's crazy to see someone kind of step onto the scene because a lot of the loudest voices in the room were like sue and Kyle and doe and people like. So, yeah, I mean, it appears that we have a potential new, at least side character, maybe not main character, and hopefully this time is different.
01:12:52.630 - 01:12:57.750, Speaker D: Keep in mind, machine zone raised at four and a half billion, I think, and then sold for 250,000,000.
01:12:57.900 - 01:12:59.430, Speaker C: Did you guys invest in this company?
01:12:59.580 - 01:13:01.160, Speaker B: That's a loss for people.
01:13:04.410 - 01:13:10.060, Speaker C: I do not think this guy is a good new face of crypto twitter. I'm just going to say that.
01:13:11.950 - 01:13:16.102, Speaker D: Well, he did just raise $200 million for marketing.
01:13:16.246 - 01:13:41.518, Speaker B: Okay, I've got a question. Do you guys think if elon musk successfully rides off into the sunset that he will flip this rule and that trolling people on twitter actually will end in a good result? Like, if elon musk flies off to mars, like being valued at a trillion dollars personally, and was like, yep, I told the SEC to go suck. Might he might personally flip the rule of the universe, and then that behavior will be acceptable.
01:13:41.614 - 01:13:44.846, Speaker C: I think it's already acceptable, the intergalactic.
01:13:44.878 - 01:13:46.370, Speaker D: SEC, though, that's true.
01:13:46.440 - 01:14:09.990, Speaker C: I think it's already acceptable. I was talking to the partner, one of the biggest, I would argue the top five crypto funds. They are now encouraging their founders to be louder and more as he described it. He said, more dough. Like on Twitter. He goes, we don't tell anyone to go full dough, but we think it's a smart strategy to be a little louder. I was like, yeah, it's smart to.
01:14:10.000 - 01:14:11.546, Speaker A: Be a little louder. Telling people to be dough.
01:14:11.578 - 01:14:13.360, Speaker C: Like, a little more dough. Like.
01:14:16.290 - 01:14:20.286, Speaker D: There'S better examples, I would say.
01:14:20.388 - 01:14:26.034, Speaker A: Yeah, there's better examples, but having a loud founder is not a bad thing.
01:14:26.232 - 01:14:29.460, Speaker C: Who's your favorite founder right now? Like in your port code?
01:14:33.510 - 01:14:37.666, Speaker B: And then if you have children who.
01:14:37.688 - 01:14:42.630, Speaker C: Are two founders who have all asked it in a PC way, like, very impressed. Who have impressed you this year or something?
01:14:42.700 - 01:14:43.094, Speaker D: I don't know.
01:14:43.132 - 01:14:44.390, Speaker C: That's so much lamer.
01:14:45.850 - 01:15:11.194, Speaker A: I think the Kane comeback arc and know, taking the beatings during the bear market or the bull market from sue about the houses he bought and turning synthetics around and kind of telling the haters to go fuck themselves, that's been pretty impressive. I'm trying to think of who else. It's been pretty quiet on Twitter, as you would probably expect after the industry getting nuked.
01:15:11.322 - 01:15:15.330, Speaker C: How about Stardust? Canon is a gigabrain.
01:15:16.630 - 01:15:17.570, Speaker A: Canon.
01:15:19.670 - 01:15:25.300, Speaker C: I don't know how to name, but I talked to him. You are a gigabrain. I like you.
01:15:27.370 - 01:15:56.794, Speaker D: That's a great new nickname. So Kanan was lesser known than Kane, for instance. But I think they have really come out. And Stardust is centralized, no token, so you're probably not going to hear about it as much. It's also infrastructure, so it's going to be underneath the surface, but I'd say canaan would be my choice as well. The groundswell of talent that they have is growing.
01:15:56.922 - 01:16:04.270, Speaker A: There's also a lot of young bucks that are just getting started. So let those plants grow. We'll come back six months.
01:16:04.340 - 01:16:06.458, Speaker C: All right, let's wrap.
01:16:06.554 - 01:16:14.890, Speaker B: I think finger guns is a good place to wrap it. So this is fun, fellas. See you at the same time next week. All right, thanks a lot, guys. Take care, you guys. Bye.
