00:00:00.090 - 00:00:22.318, Speaker A: Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal.
00:00:22.404 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker B: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.730 - 00:00:54.670, Speaker A: Hey everyone. Before we get into it today, just want to give a quick shout out to this season sponsor, Rook. Close to a billion dollars worth of mev has been taken out of users'pockets and that's just on Ethereum and that number is only getting larger. Unfortunately, Rook thinks that it's time for a change and they've built a solution which is going to automatically redirect that mev back to where it belongs, into the user's pocket. So you're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. I'm a huge fan of this team and what they're building, so stay tuned to find out more.
00:00:54.740 - 00:01:07.582, Speaker C: You can be a competent searcher and generate your own and be competitive as a searcher, then there's a high likelihood that you should also be a builder. Right. Simply because who are the best builders? They're people that have their own order flow.
00:01:07.646 - 00:01:31.298, Speaker A: All right, Hasu, so today we're going to be talking to Dean Eigenman and anish Ognihotri, a couple of searchers and I think this will be a very fun callback to the original. I think the sort of canonical there are very few interviews with searchers out there, but your interview with a searcher from 2020 really stands out. So yeah, why don't you tell listeners? What are we kind of trying to probe for here in this conversation?
00:01:31.394 - 00:02:13.750, Speaker D: Yeah, I look very much forward to talking to these two guys, to anish anish I would consider a friend of mine. He's been on the podcast before. He used to work for Paradigm at the same time when I was there and I think he's so good at breaking things down and explaining them in a concise way and yeah, it's really insane how young he is. I think that's something that you'll be hard pressed to find a person who has kind of spent more of their time in crypto as a relative percent of the age, which is I think it's very interesting. Dean, he's a super colorful character. I think he's very polarizing. He always has great stories.
00:02:13.750 - 00:02:33.646, Speaker D: He's working for this, so he has his own mev company, Project Blank. I think they are mostly active on these alternative chains, so not predominantly on Ethereum. I think they do a lot on kind of these alternative EVM chains. So I think we get a very broad picture here.
00:02:33.748 - 00:02:34.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:34.436 - 00:02:36.110, Speaker A: All right, let's get right into it.
00:02:36.180 - 00:02:44.782, Speaker E: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Today Hasu and I are joined by anish Agnihotri and Dean Eichenman. Guys, welcome to the show.
00:02:44.836 - 00:02:46.714, Speaker B: Thanks for having us for this episode.
00:02:46.762 - 00:03:06.162, Speaker E: We're going to be kind of diving deep into both of your roles as searchers in the Mev ecosystem. But I think before we get into that, I think Hasu and I would love to know, kind of just to kick things off, could you guys just give our audience a little bit of a background about each of you and how you kind of got into the space? I think that'd be a very interesting segue into our conversation.
00:03:06.306 - 00:04:04.442, Speaker B: Sure, I could start I've been in the space for a while, starting like 2016, 2017. I met a guy on Reddit called Matthew Deforente. We were talking about smart contracts at the time, and he was running an audit shop called ZK Labs and was part time on the Ethereum security team. And so I started working together with him. And then around the same time, Nick Johnson was looking for help on ENS because he was the sole developer there, started helping Nick Johnson and then was doing those things full time for a while. At one point we shut down ZK Labs because auditing is grueling and not really at one point worth it anymore. Then I left that, kind of took a little bit of a break, and then joined Status working on protocol research for messaging, worked on some of the peer to peer message protocols there that are still being used.
00:04:04.442 - 00:04:37.058, Speaker B: And iterated on the iterations of Whisper that the EF had originally proposed. And around that time as well, I co founded Dialectic together with Ryan, who was previously a co founder at Polychain. Yeah. And been doing Dialectic ever since. That's been like almost three years ago now, I think. Kind of hard to tell. And part of the things we were doing at Dialectic, we wanted to look into Mev and started a fully fledged team from there to kind of do mev.
00:04:37.154 - 00:04:38.966, Speaker F: Dean, to stay with you for a.
00:04:38.988 - 00:04:39.560, Speaker E: Second.
00:04:41.850 - 00:05:00.460, Speaker F: What would you say was the relationship between what you did previously, which is kind of security auditing and protocol research? How did that allow you to transition into searching? And what would you say was your first big break as a searcher that made you realize, this is something that I can do for a living, that's something that I find really interesting and so on.
00:05:00.830 - 00:05:49.738, Speaker B: I mean, when it comes from the protocol research and things like that, the main thing is for the research I was doing, it required a fundamental understanding of the full stack, which you kind of need for mev as well, which is one of the reasons why I like spending so much time on Mev. And I find it the most compelling thing to do in crypto right now, is because it incorporates everything. Right. You need to understand the networking. You have to understand the clients, how they function. You have to understand how the EVM works in detail and things like that and so for example, for the EVM part, my experience from Auditing obviously helps there because we had probably a better understanding of that paradigm than just a normal smart contract developer would have.
00:05:49.824 - 00:06:07.780, Speaker C: I got into crypto, I'd say probably 2014, so coming up on ten years next year, which should be exciting as an enthusiast. Similar story to Dean was on Reddit making websites for people got paid in Bitcoin because that was the only way as a kid and so stuck around since then.
00:06:09.350 - 00:06:14.580, Speaker F: Say how old you are to make people realize how crazy it is. How long you've been in this space?
00:06:14.950 - 00:07:28.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm 20 now, so I got in when I was eleven, a couple of years ago now and since I've stuck around, it's the most exciting thing to me. It's the closest hands on I can get with anything in crypto and so that's why I've stuck around in 2016, 2017. I unfortunately was a kid so I didn't buy into the ethereum presale but I got my parents to buy me a bunch of R 9280 X graphics cards and was a minor early on, stuck around in the ecosystem, did a bunch of open source work with Gitcoin. Eventually found myself in senior year of high school joining Polychain, another place where Dean's co founders worked and co founded. I think there was a part of a prop team for about a year in early DFI summer where we arbed the yield from borrowing across centralized exchanges and put capital into new and protocols that had only been around for two or three days at that point of time. Left that in 2021 and joined Paradigm as a researcher where I worked mostly on open source protocols and building tooling and about ten months ago left that to go independent as a Mev Searcher fellow.
00:07:28.670 - 00:08:04.040, Speaker E: That's fascinating for both you guys. I think maybe to start at a super high level, I think it'd be great to give the audience sort of a perspective of what does the landscape look like for Searchers today? When I say that, I mean, I think at least for me going into this season when I thought of Mev Searchers, I thought of kind of a bunch of individuals, kind of writing bots that were looking for mev and finding a way to profit. Is that a realistic understanding of the landscape or has it kind of professionalized and is it kind of dominated by larger shops that are searching for mev? Like what does that whole kind of landscape of Searchers look like?
00:08:04.650 - 00:08:47.074, Speaker B: That's kind of a hard one. It's hard to be able to actually tell because you don't know who's speaking the truth and who's not, right? The only thing you actually know for certain is what's happening on chain. From my feeling and kind of what I can see is I think if not professionalizing people are starting to group together. I think there's probably a lot less solo searchers than there were one or two years ago, because the competition has just gotten so much more fierce. But whether or how much of the space looks like that, it's hard to say for certain.
00:08:47.192 - 00:09:08.860, Speaker C: Yeah, if I were to ballpark numbers, it's like today there's probably an upper limit of 500 searchers total just based on but of course, it's like you can't guess from addresses, but at least that's what my high level number is. And of them say majority are probably in small teams of under ten people.
00:09:09.470 - 00:09:12.110, Speaker F: That's all of crypto or just ethereum.
00:09:13.090 - 00:09:17.550, Speaker C: I'd probably say all of crypto. There's a decent overlap.
00:09:18.050 - 00:09:22.560, Speaker B: I even think for all of crypto, that 500 is a very optimistic number.
00:09:23.970 - 00:09:35.300, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm counting this as anyone that has sent maybe like a bundle in the last year or like a couple of last year to a relay. Practically speaking, it might even be like a fraction of that number.
00:09:35.750 - 00:09:53.002, Speaker B: There might be 500. But then I think the amount making money is like or the amount who can live off of MEB, because there's a lot of people who do mev just for the fun of it, who aren't actually making any money. I've seen, like, a lot of the various mev discords is just like people.
00:09:53.056 - 00:09:56.410, Speaker F: Messing around like Mike on ticketmaster.
00:09:58.030 - 00:10:18.226, Speaker E: Yeah, that's exactly right. I'll tell you guys a little mev story, how I lost a bunch of money. Dean, you mentioned that the searching landscape was getting much more competitive. Could you describe just give the listeners a little bit more of an understanding of what that means? And maybe in particular, how is searching or the landscape for searching changed based on when you first got into it and what it looks like today?
00:10:18.328 - 00:10:44.986, Speaker B: I mean, should we count the stuff we were doing in 2017 with like, ether, Delta, ARBs and stuff like that as searching? Because back then it was easy, right? No one was doing anything. You were in the mempool. You didn't even have to PGA back then. Right. You could just kind of do transactions, and that was it. And then people started Pgaing. There was more competition and things like that.
00:10:44.986 - 00:11:47.520, Speaker B: And then at one point, flashbots came. And what flashbots did was democratize, I guess democratize access to validators or democratize collusion of sorts. And what that effectively did is it caused a race to zero on the known strategies that other people are doing, because now you're competing on a different landscape. Right. And so I think from those strategies, the things that people are doing over flashbox and stuff like that, the competition has become a lot more professional because they need to optimize for very few things to be able to win in that paradigm. And so you see a smaller concentration of people doing those things. And I guess probably more people are looking for stuff outside of there that they can do without having to pay miners tips and things like that.
00:11:49.730 - 00:12:42.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the overton window of mev has shifted a lot over the last couple of years. Where in 2017, 2018, like Dean mentioned, I remember Arbing on zero X by just point and clicking tokens. And that was very feasible because nobody was looking at it right for context, unisoft v one, I think, came out DevCon four of 2018 and we didn't see any sophisticated actors for that pop up for a long time afterwards. And so it's sort of just like as we've seen volume rise up, people have started to more eyes are looking at this and saying, hey, there's opportunity here. And because of that a window has shifted to now this is more mainstream and there's trading firms out there that are now dealing with mev, which four years ago I couldn't have told you there was anyone beyond friends and family type of thing. People I see at conferences who are just Arbing this by clicking.
00:12:44.150 - 00:12:44.946, Speaker B: To put.
00:12:45.048 - 00:13:06.566, Speaker F: All of this into a little bit of context. So you probably can't go into super great detail. But as to you two, can you describe in broad strokes like what you do in mev, what chains are you on, what kinds of opportunities are you focused on and are you doing this alone or as part of the team?
00:13:06.668 - 00:14:18.346, Speaker C: Yeah, so I am a solo searcher, so it's just myself. Because of that, I focus mostly on the long tail. So differentiating here between the short tail, which is the usual Arbitrage liquidations, things that large teams are mostly focused on. I don't do a lot of that. Most of my work is on a broad, long tail of opportunities which looks know NFT market making NFT mints probabilistic back running on protocols that don't have solutions like flashbots spam keeper bots a wide range of the obscure things that you need to keep the chain running but aren't necessarily as sexy as, say, Arbitrage or know, liquidations and things like that. As for chains, I'd say predominantly on Ethereum mainnet, although I basically deploy the code that I have to any EVM based execution environment since most of it is largely the same across each and every single one. And that includes some of the new upstarts like EVM on Cosmos, similar to Kanto and things like that, where there's.
00:14:18.378 - 00:15:00.170, Speaker F: Opportunity that makes sense. How would you say to stick with you for a second before we go back to Dean? As someone who is active on all EVM chains, at least in theory, how has so far the kind of shift to roll ups in terms of like roll ups have now surpassed Ethereum in pure volume numbers? But how would you say this has impacted the mev that's available on these chains? And maybe related to that also, how is working on these chains different for you given that they don't have kind of mev auctions or they have these sequences that kind of order transactions in a first come, first serve manner.
00:15:00.510 - 00:15:34.098, Speaker C: Sure. Two questions there. I think the first one probably with as transaction flow moves to L two S, how that's shaped up for the Mev world? I think for me it's not much of a difference. It's mostly just a different execution environment with most of the same paradigm. I think it's a difference in the node software and the networking. Wherever volume goes, generally mev searchers will track that very well and go there as well. And so we already see there's dominant teams that ARB across Arbitrum.
00:15:34.098 - 00:16:39.206, Speaker C: Right. And just the way that they do it is slightly different. So on Arbitram and on optimism, these L two S, you currently have centralized sequencers. And so it's much more of a networking game of how close can we be to the sequencers? How close can we be to the order flow originators where these transactions are originating from? How quickly can we take a look at what state transitions are happening and then send and fire off a transaction versus on Ethereum where you have solutions like Flashbots? And so it's much more competing over the tip to the validator for at least most short tail opportunities. So that, I'd say, is probably what the initial difference is. As for the differences that I notice moving across L two S and other execution environments, I'd say for at least a long tail searcher like myself, it's much more beneficial to build up a domain expertise in networks that aren't Ethereum. Like if I can understand the quirks of a smaller L one, if I can go deep into the protocol code that sometimes is a fork of death but has its own modifications that change up the way that networking.
00:16:39.206 - 00:17:01.454, Speaker C: Works or changes the way the Mempool works. It makes it much more competitive for me to compete on that chain versus, say, any random searcher from Ethereum that can come and deploy their code on any EVM environment. And so for me, it pays to basically double down on these more obscure L ones that trading firms and other large teams don't focus on to get that competitive edge.
00:17:01.502 - 00:17:09.350, Speaker F: That's a great answer. Thank you. Kicking the same question to you, Dean. What do you do broadly and how has it evolved?
00:17:10.170 - 00:17:58.900, Speaker B: So we kind of do the opposite of a niche right now. We don't do much long tail. I think long tail is less viable for teams, more viable for independent searchers. That answers the question as well. We are a team. And yeah, the thing we do as well is we deploy right now pretty much on any EVM compatible chain and are also ensuring to get expertise to corner markets outside of EVM compatible chains, especially with things like roll ups coming right now, the Cosmos ecosystem gaining traction and things like that. I think that looking around in that space is going to be very interesting.
00:17:59.270 - 00:18:40.306, Speaker E: Can you guys just in terms of when you're sort of looking out there in terms of the world and trying to assess different opportunities, can you describe what sort of makes for a fertile environment in terms of extracting mev? So, Anish, you mentioned that where kind of transactions and volumes go. So, like layer twos for Ethereum, for instance, but what about the applications that are built on top of those L two S? Like, for instance, there's been uniswap V three, for instance. That's very fertile ground for extracting mev and kind of the whole AMM model. So outside of just where volumes are, what about the apps that are existing in these environments? How does that also play into where opportunity exists for you?
00:18:40.328 - 00:19:31.300, Speaker C: As a searcher, as a long tail searcher, at least, I'm app agnostic and my work basically pushes me to whichever apps have the highest volumes with the least competition. So I'd say in the short tail, maybe you're looking at how can I optimize these AMM hotpaths, how can I get really good at this type of liquidation? And that carries well over to other different types of protocols. For me, that's more of a problem. Right. I want to go places where people have not fared because that gives me the competitive advantage. Right. So a lot of my work is in absolutely new apps and new protocols that are doing experimental things that aren't very well defined by like, an AMM structure, since that lets me get very deep into those code bases, understand how they work, and find out where those inefficiencies are before other people have figured it out.
00:19:31.300 - 00:19:50.754, Speaker C: And so, at least in the lifecycle of an opportunity, for me, it's much more important to be there early and not even to do well, but to just be there early and understand everything than it is to say, understand the intricacies of uniswap B three very well and then adapt my strategy across every network where that's deployed.
00:19:50.802 - 00:20:20.734, Speaker E: And can you maybe, without definitely revealing anything that you're working on right now, but maybe like an example of a past opportunity that you were able to exploit? I'd love to just kind of get in the nitty gritty of what that actually means. So how do you go about what are kind of the steps for determining sort of the logic of different applications? And then maybe if you could just give listeners one sort of concrete example of an exploit or an opportunity, maybe that's expired, just so we get more of a concrete understanding of what that looks like in practice.
00:20:20.862 - 00:21:15.570, Speaker C: Sure, yeah. I'll give one that's been spoken about decently well and has repos of people that have worked on it. A lot of my work, I'd say greater than 50%, is in the data ingestion analysis of what happens on chain. Right. So it's consuming a bunch of Ethereum data, other chain data, and then writing rules on top of that to identify what a profitable transaction looks like. So say a very naive rule could be analyze every single transaction over the last year where a user has inputted less than what they received in output, right? And a good example of what that catches is say something like keepers for a protocol, where a user is spending gas fees to get some protocol token in exchange for running some services for a smart contract or a protocol or an app. A concrete example being, say, beanstop protocol, where they have a keeper that you can run.
00:21:15.570 - 00:22:22.474, Speaker C: It's a simple smart contract function you call once an hour that progresses some activity in their smart contract. And in exchange of that, they emit you some quantity of bean token, which is their dollar denominated stablecoin. And so essentially it says something like every hour you can get, I think now 25, but previously it used to be $100 for just calling this function. And that's an easy opportunity to spot on chain since you're looking for transactions where users spend very little in gas fees and ethereum and get a decent amount of dollar denominated stablecoin on the other end. And so that's something that pops up across one of the trackers that I'll write. It's even easier because that's something that's on a fixed schedule, right? It happens once every hour, which means that if I do some naive clustering, I can easily see, okay, there's somebody calling something every hour that makes them money. And so I will go in and I'll investigate, okay, what does this look like? What is this opportunity? How much money is there to be made? Is it worth it for me to go and write the code? Naively, you would think, oh, $100 an hour for free.
00:22:22.474 - 00:23:00.590, Speaker C: Okay, this is fantastic. Right? Do the math. Out $2,400 a day, 30 days, that's almost a million dollars a year, practically. That's usually not how it works. For starters, if I'm finding an opportunity that somebody else is already doing, there's that aspect of competition where it's likely that it's already been bid up to the point where you're paying upwards of 90% to the validator. And so in the case of bean, if you're trying to do that today, you will maybe make a couple of cents every time you call it simply because it's such an easy strategy that 99% of the tip of the extracted value goes as a tip to the validators. And so there's not much there.
00:23:00.590 - 00:23:55.286, Speaker C: But like I said earlier, it pays to be early, right? So if you were one of the initial people to come across this and or if you do it in some unique way, right, like for a period of time last year, I did it where when mev boost first came out, there was upwards of ten to 15% of stake that hadn't onboarded to MVV boost, right. You had 80% adoption of people using the relays versus 20% not. So if you just defaulted back to that 20% of people that weren't using a relay and just submit transactions in the Mempool. You actually got better price execution on running these keeper bots, which meant that you were much more profitable compared to somebody who was a less sophisticated actor paying 99% tips directly to Flashbots or some other relay. That's I think a concrete example of the type of work where it's much more figure out what's going on on chain, where's the opportunity and then find some unique way to extract that value.
00:23:55.388 - 00:24:52.150, Speaker F: You touch on so many interesting points there anise and I'd be interested to kind of hear your take, Dean, on just the competitive aspect of searching. Right, so Mike was asking, well, what makes it for a further ground for searching? And sure you need some opportunity to be there, but then the other big thing that you need is you want low competition, right? So you can actually, as you were saying, quantum market, because it doesn't matter if opportunity is big, if the competition is also big, you're not going to catch much. But if an opportunity is small, but you can control it entirely, then probably you can make a very nice return. So how do you think about the different layers of competition, like searcher versus user, searcher versus searcher, searcher versus builder, if that exists on any of the chains that you're on, but also kind of searcher versus validator? How do you think about kind of these different layers and how do you try to position yourselves within them in order to get the best possible outcome?
00:24:52.230 - 00:26:04.002, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, validator is the absolute end game of competition, right, we saw that last week. I think that's a problem that a lot of me probably haven't thought about enough, given what happened. For those who don't know, there was a Validator who ended up muving searcher last week. The way we try and analyze competition is not like what is the value of a given strategy, it's what is the maximum extractable value for us given that we join this competition. Like, are we able or do we think that looking at this competition and doing an analysis of it, which includes analyzing the way they send transactions, analyzing all of their smart contracts, do we think that we're able to easily push them out? Because that's a strategy as well, which we've employed. Right. You don't always have to have the biggest pie in the beginning, but you might be able to easily burn competition out.
00:26:04.002 - 00:26:54.746, Speaker B: Right. That's kind of the thing. The way I like to go about it, because a lot of the strategies that we do are pretty common. But from what we can tell, sometimes it's still solo searchers and things like that and then they don't have 24 hours coverage to optimize their strategies and react to everything that's happening on the network, whereas we do. And so, yeah, I like to burn out competition and corner them as much as possible. We don't go into things where we see that the competition is sophisticated as well as employing some of the strategies that we do. So, as Anish said, a lot of his job is doing data analysis, and that's the case for us too.
00:26:54.746 - 00:27:03.714, Speaker B: We do a lot of data collection and run various tools to kind of find Anomalies on the network, find patterns, things like that.
00:27:03.752 - 00:27:30.086, Speaker A: Hey, guys, quick break from the show here. I want you to imagine something for me. Imagine swapping two stablecoins on Chain, paying $0 in gas and instead getting a rebate of $2,000. This is something that's actually happened on Chain. To understand how, I want to introduce and thank this season's sponsor, Rook. Zooming out for a second. The current state of affairs at Mev is billions of dollars so far have been extracted from users'pockets using Mev.
00:27:30.086 - 00:28:01.794, Speaker A: Rook is coming in and saying enough is enough. Blockchain should drive value to their users and the applications they use. It is time to leave the hobbyist era behind us if we want to move forward and we want to get this right. That's why Rook has built a custom blockchain settlement network, and it's one that gives you full control over the entire transaction cycle. Today, you can connect to an open source Rook node. The Rook protocol will automatically match, bundle, and auction your orders and transactions in seconds with zero gas overhead. Also, any Mev that's discoverable along the way will be returned to you, the user.
00:28:01.794 - 00:28:41.006, Speaker A: Created as a collaboration between the industry's top mechanism designers and Mev engineers, rook was built from the ground up to be scalable, safe, and programmable. You can get your own Mempool, choose Searchers and Builders, and link your Mempool with others to discover even more Mev. You can define how the MEB is shared and delivered as well, and what can basically process anything from transactions to metatransactions and more. This is the way that Blockchains basically should have been from day one. So if you're a user listening to this, here's what I want you to do. I want you to go to your wallets, go to your favorite app, your node provider, and say, hey, I want you to be working with these guys. Rook I want the Mev that I create to be redistributed back to Me.
00:28:41.006 - 00:28:56.118, Speaker A: If you're a developer and you want to stay ahead of the game, the best way to do that is to follow them on Twitter. They are at Rook. Or even better yet, slide into their DMs. They are lightning responsive. They'll get you set up today. And if you do slide into those DMs, as always, please tell them that I sent you.
00:28:56.284 - 00:29:40.662, Speaker E: I actually would be curious. I don't want to go too far down this rabbit hole, but as two searchers, I would love to get both of your perspectives on the exploit that happened last week. Because, again, the kind of two perspectives that hasu and. I laid out on the last episode know, on the one hand, searchers are generally very sophisticated actors and very well compensated for what they do. And these particular searchers were sandwich bots, which isn't maybe the most sympathetic quarter of mev in the world. But on the other hand, you don't necessarily want searchers like you guys to be concerned about some of the infrastructure kind of upstream of where both of you interact. So I would actually love to get both of your perspectives on the exploit that happened last week.
00:29:40.796 - 00:29:43.030, Speaker B: All is fair and love and mev.
00:29:45.210 - 00:30:25.698, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm on the same page. I'd say as a sandwicher you explicitly take that risk of using the infrastructure and you should be well aware of the fact that there's no certain guarantee that your front slice and back slice will always be in the exact position you want to. And this was just a good example, or at least the most explicit example we've had of that not being the case. And that's all I think in mev generally. You have to go in with the mindset that things will break and the intuition that you have of the way a system works is not necessarily the same as both the designers of that system and the users of that system.
00:30:25.864 - 00:31:18.790, Speaker E: Well said, guys. Well said. I actually want to pick a little bit at what you said as kind of the searcher versus Validator as being the ultimate level of competition. Definitely seems like searching is a very sort of PvP zero sum game. And I'd be curious just to clarify something when you said is kind of part of your strategy, especially for kind of like short tail mev to sort of crowd out other would be competitors by accepting lower maybe profits than you would otherwise would on trades for less well capitalized teams to basically crowd them out of trades. And then how do you kind of think of is your sort of mental model that you are kind of in competition with Validators or proposers to extract more of the value of mev? And if so, how do you sort of trip away or win at that game over time?
00:31:18.860 - 00:32:04.180, Speaker B: I mean, in the end I definitely am in competition with Validators because I don't like paying them. And so I think the obvious end goal there is to run enough Validators where I do my mev from. Yeah, there's definitely been scenarios where we've seen on chain that competition is accepting or none of the profit and bribing as much as possible to burn out competition. Definitely seen that happen. I said all is fair in love and mev. I think people will kind of do anything to get a slice of the pie.
00:32:05.750 - 00:32:06.114, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:06.152 - 00:32:18.310, Speaker F: What do you say? That's one of the advantages of being a big up firm compared to like a solar searcher, that you have the balance sheet in order to take a loss maybe for a couple of weeks to months on a certain opportunity. The expectation.
00:32:18.970 - 00:32:21.980, Speaker B: Yeah. And just the adaptiveness. Right.
00:32:23.870 - 00:32:25.818, Speaker F: Have you experienced any of that yourself?
00:32:25.904 - 00:32:28.794, Speaker C: Anish yeah, I mean, all the time.
00:32:28.832 - 00:32:31.226, Speaker F: From the other side. Oh, really?
00:32:31.408 - 00:32:57.430, Speaker C: It's a very common thing, right. Sort of the game theory of the grim trigger of if I can't make any money, then neither will you or anybody else is, I'd say, very common in mev across basically all types of mev, right. And I'd say it's probably when I enter a new strategy with a competitor, it's probably the first thing that happens, right. Where they're like, okay, I am willing to play the war of attrition and to crowd you out of this simply because I'm willing to take zero profit.
00:33:00.570 - 00:33:07.000, Speaker F: Fascinating. Okay, give us some PvP stories here. Come on. That's what the listeners want.
00:33:09.530 - 00:33:12.200, Speaker B: I don't know. I have a fun one, but.
00:33:14.090 - 00:33:15.382, Speaker F: Let'S start with you.
00:33:15.436 - 00:33:16.394, Speaker E: You got to tell us. Come on.
00:33:16.432 - 00:33:17.740, Speaker F: Just thinking about it.
00:33:18.430 - 00:33:55.800, Speaker B: I mean, the one thing we see often now is with sandwich bots, sandwich trappers, which are essentially bots that will purposely trap sandwichers in very interesting ways where the sandwicher thinks they're going to get a huge amount of profit and then ends up walking away with nothing. Yeah. So you sandwich the sandwicher and things like that. We've seen stuff like that, which I find relatively fun because that one's a funny one because people talk about the ethics of sandwiching and I'm like, yeah, but if you're sandwiching the sandwicher, are you a bad guy?
00:33:57.770 - 00:34:02.570, Speaker F: Dean how does that work? Yeah, does it work on a chain like Ethereum where bundles are private?
00:34:04.110 - 00:34:06.422, Speaker B: I've not witnessed it on Ethereum.
00:34:06.566 - 00:34:09.900, Speaker F: Okay, well, except this one time now, last week.
00:34:10.270 - 00:34:15.066, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's a different context because you had the validator in play, right?
00:34:15.248 - 00:34:15.594, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:15.632 - 00:34:17.522, Speaker B: So then, yes, it could happen on Ethereum.
00:34:17.606 - 00:34:22.990, Speaker F: Yeah. So it can happen on chains that basically don't have private channels. Two minus.
00:34:23.490 - 00:34:33.042, Speaker B: Yeah. On certain chains you also have private channels, but the private channel is only 30% to 40% of the validator set. Right.
00:34:33.176 - 00:35:01.290, Speaker E: Dean just for the listeners, could you describe the mechanics of that attack? Like, what does it mean to sandwich the sandwiches? Because in this ethereum example, obviously, where one of the validators was involved, there was sort of a baiting of sandwiches where you gave the impression to these sandwich bots that there was going to be a really juicy front running opportunity and then obviously that backfired and they ended up getting exploited. So what are the mechanics? Is it kind of a similar thing on other chains where there's a lure, so to speak?
00:35:01.360 - 00:35:28.914, Speaker B: It's a similar thing. It often revolves around you do a kind of bait and then you do multiple transactions. And most of those transactions bots won't simulate because they're not or they don't look related, and that's where the real juice is in. So you bait with a shitty trade that's as much detail, as I'll say, interesting.
00:35:29.032 - 00:36:40.006, Speaker E: Fair enough. I would be very curious, it seems like, especially for more of this, like, I guess the heuristic that I'm getting from you, Dina Nanish, is sort of for long tail MEB opportunities that's kind of better suited for single person sort of searching outfits. And then when you get to the more short tail side of things, it looks more like almost like a hedge fund, kind of like a high frequency trading shop is my mental model. I would be curious because at least on Ethereum, now you have PBS, so you've got searchers or sorry, you've got searchers and then you've also got builders, right? And I'd just be very curious, like if you were a sort of a hedge fund or a high frequency trading firm and you're saying, hey, this MVV stuff actually looks very similar to what I do in TradFi markets. And they were trying to decide, do I enter kind of the searching space or the building space? What would be the mental framework for deciding where to play in that value chain? Or if you're a shop, would you just say, I'm going to do both of these things, which might actually be happening right now, but I'd be curious to just get an understanding of where the different competencies lies. Maybe anish this is proposed to you because you're on Ethereum, but between builders.
00:36:40.118 - 00:36:44.462, Speaker F: And also, don't forget your PvP story. You're not after.
00:36:44.516 - 00:37:55.026, Speaker C: Okay, sure. I can start with the PBS. I'd say if you're a sophisticated trading firm, if you're a centralized shop that's coming into Ethereum, it pays to do both, right? If you can be a competent searcher and generate your own and be competitive as a searcher, then there's a high likelihood that you should also be a builder simply because who are the best builders? They're people that have their own order flow, right? It's either you have transaction flow yourself, so say something like flashbots protect feeding into the flashbots builder and or you're a market making or trading firm or an mev shop that generates ARBs, that generates liquidations. That has all. Of these types of transactions that nobody else has, that you can then stuff your own blocks with to augment the profitability of those blocks and make your builder the winning builder. So if you're a shop in the traditional world, you want to do both. And that's what we see today, right? Places like Jane Street, SCP, Winter, Mute, all of them run their own internal searching operations and at the same time have builders that they operate simply because it pays to do that.
00:37:55.128 - 00:37:55.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:55.432 - 00:38:48.920, Speaker F: And maybe just to give some further intuition on why that's the case, if you are a searcher who sends their order flow to a bunch of different builders, then your order flow will make the blocks of all of these builders more valuable. They will compete with each other and bid up the price that they pay to the validator. Whereas if you are kind of your own builder and you don't share your order flow with anyone, then you now have less competition, you end up paying yourself like the searcher side of your business pays kind of the builder side of your business, but you end up paying less forward to the validator. And so it's almost like you can get a rebate on what you've paid yourself in the first step. So Anish, what are some other benefits that you can get by being a block builder that you don't have as a searcher other than the financial one?
00:38:49.450 - 00:39:23.194, Speaker C: Sure. So most direct one is you can do types of strategies that require you to have access to the entire block. So with bundles you can only sort of do this atomic set of transactions that are all bundled together versus with the full blocks you have the complete liberty to have. Bottom of the block, ARB. Top of the block, ARB. Do things in the middle of the block, you could sandwich entire bundles that other people are submitting to you. And there's existing builders that do exactly that right where you submit them your bundles as a searcher.
00:39:23.194 - 00:40:06.462, Speaker C: They will then run their own algorithms to search around your bundles and then give you a kickback for submitting order flow to them. And so it opens up sort of like this entire new space of strategy that you can do around building efficient blocks and doing new types of things. And I expect that'll only get more sophisticated as we move forward. Where, for example, one of the things I've been looking into is, say, if you can know for certainty that you're proposing two slots in a row from a single relay or a single validator set, then you can get into some really cool things of having cross block MEB where you're building the blocks for both this block and the next one. And so yeah, there's like an infinite opportunity space of you can do anything.
00:40:06.596 - 00:40:23.330, Speaker F: Do you think that eventually kind of all of the major trading firms will have to be block builders and vice versa? Or do you think we'll see ever like a reversal of this trend where the need to be a block builder will decrease?
00:40:24.890 - 00:41:10.222, Speaker C: I'd say it depends. I'd say it's probably in their best financial interest to be block builders. Although if you're not particularly dominant and if you're a shop that has very little transaction order flow or very infrequent, then it might not pay to have dedicated teams that maintain the node software and run your builders. And you could instead delegate out to other builders that take very minimal fees. Like for myself, it doesn't particularly pay to run my own block builder. I have some transaction order flow that other people don't and I have some long tail transactions, but it's not enough for me to justify the infrastructure costs of running an entire builder operation.
00:41:10.366 - 00:41:55.454, Speaker E: I have a question for maybe both of you and Dean, I've heard you talk about this a little bit in the past, but can you guys describe what sort of the capital requirements are for searching in general and how trades get funded? Like, Dean, I heard in the interview that you did on zero knowledge that you've used flash loans in the past to fund some of your operations. So I'd just be very curious. Is searching again? Depends on, I guess, short tail versus long tail. The type of thing where you need to come in with a good amount of capital to fund some of these, especially like sandwiches, where you have to move the price of assets in specific pools. Or is it the kind of thing where you can use flash loans or just in time liquidity? Or just be very curious about what the funding sort of model looks like for searching?
00:41:55.502 - 00:42:07.694, Speaker B: So from every bot that we track, which is like 2030 bots across various networks, they're pretty much all using flash loans.
00:42:07.742 - 00:42:08.340, Speaker E: Still.
00:42:11.110 - 00:42:51.970, Speaker B: I think that one of the nice things about using flash loans is that you don't have to keep any capital in native currency, meaning you don't have to take on any inventory risk. In the end, you still want to be smart about that, right? Even if you're operating on a chain and believe in a chain, you are operating a business. So you want to reduce your inventory risk as much as possible. And so flashbots gives you the nice opportunity there. Yeah. And most of these sorry, not flashbots, flash loans. And most of these venues where you can get flash loans, you can get more liquidity than is reasonable to hold anyways on an EOA, which you need to run a bot.
00:42:51.970 - 00:42:59.750, Speaker B: Yeah. So yeah, I think most people probably still use flash loans.
00:43:01.690 - 00:43:12.714, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say for my atomic strategies, still use flash loans for the non atomic ones, short duration inventory risk. So nothing a couple of blocks maybe.
00:43:12.752 - 00:43:44.770, Speaker E: We could when you say like non atomic because I think anish at least one of the surprises for me going into the season hasu definitely came in with more knowledge than but you know, my understanding going in was that most of the mev being captured was atomic. And atomic is a very interesting idea when it comes to mev because it's like really pure riskless sort of arbitrage. But my understanding is that the majority of mev that's being generated today is actually not necessarily atomic. So could you describe kind of the change that's undergoing there?
00:43:44.840 - 00:44:44.082, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'd say that could be split between the non atomic strategies that exist in short tail versus the non atomic that exists in long tail. So in the short tail and released, if you can exclude the atomicity and you can remove the need for flash loans, you can be much more efficient with your execution. And that's what we see with things for trade on different venues. And so a good example of say, non atomic trades, or at least shortly non atomic trades, in short tail, are things like CFI DeFi ARB or Stat ARP where one leg of the execution happens on chain and another leg of the execution happens off chain. And so if you were to look at just simply the on chain leg, you would see that's non atomic because they take some position on chain, right? They're either long an asset or they're short an asset and they hedge that out off chain using centralized venues to close that gap. This pays for a couple of reasons.
00:44:44.082 - 00:45:39.010, Speaker C: The first being that you have more venues that you can trade on. The second being that you can take some duration risk and you can use your own inventory. So, say if you're a market maker like Winter Mute and you already have $200 billion of ethereum inventory and you have some internal price set, it's now much more efficient for you to only have to execute one leg of that trade on chain since you already have inventory off chain. And it also lets you capitalize on things that aren't just extractable value from ordering where from any transaction on chain, there's sort of two types of extractable value. There's the extractable value you get from ordering that transaction in some way and then the extractable value from the signal of that transaction. Right? And Stefan and Unkid at Frontier had a really great piece on this which breaks it down, but it's know just from seeing a transaction. What alpha can I get from that? Just from the fact that it's in the Mempool.
00:45:39.010 - 00:46:34.182, Speaker C: If you make a massive trade of ETH, right, where you say, I'm buying $100 million of ETH and put that into the Mempool, I don't even have to as a searcher be the one that's sandwiching you or front running you. Simply knowing the fact that there's such a large trade that may execute gives me insight into the fact that the price of ETH might go up and I can then go make a trade based on that. So at least in the short tail, that's where the non atomic is very dominant. In the long tail, it comes into more obscure types of strategies where I might have a good prior on the fact that there's an 80% chance that I make a profit on this trade, but it might not be an atomic trade. And a really good example of this is that got common in the last year is something like NFT Mints, right, where I'm spending ETH gas fees today for some NFT that I may be able to sell for a profit in the future. And if I have a very high prior of the fact that I could be profitable, that's not non atomic, but it's decent enough for me to participate.
00:46:34.246 - 00:47:49.470, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes an enormous amount of sense. I'd be curious because one of my sort of mental models for this was when you talk about Stadarp, at least in TradFi, this is what Hasi and I have discussed this, but what Citadel securities is sort of famous for, right. And they have sort of this practice where they have a huge advantage seeing this sort of dumb order flow from a venue like Robinhood. And while they don't trade directly against the customers on Robinhood, they use that information as signal to make more informed trading decisions. So the example that we've talked about is you see a bunch of buy orders for GME, it's probably relatively safe to assume that there's going to be a bunch of buy orders for AMC or very correlated type asset. So I guess it sounds like similar games are being played on Ethereum or in crypto, so to speak, so far. And I guess my question for you is if the opportunity set trends that way so that most of the mev being realized is non atomic and that has higher capital requirements and it favors an organization like Wintermute that has a bunch of ethereum on their balance sheet.
00:47:49.470 - 00:48:00.934, Speaker E: Do you see the overall trend of mev extraction again moving towards some of these larger sort of hedge funds? If that's the way the opportunity set moves and Dean open question to you as well.
00:48:01.052 - 00:48:09.240, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean generally speaking, that is the way I see the trend moving. Right. It's people that have the inventory and can take the.
00:48:12.570 - 00:48:44.066, Speaker B: Question. I see the trend moving that way as well. The question is always at what point do we still call it mev? Is some of this that ARB stuff actually mev? I think that's one of the big debates as well. Right. Because in my definition of mev, I only view the atomic things really as mev. Although we do non atomic things as well. I call it mev because that's what everyone else calls it.
00:48:44.066 - 00:48:50.390, Speaker B: But that's not really what I view as mev. Maybe I just have a very old definition of the term.
00:48:51.450 - 00:49:14.350, Speaker F: Well, it would be I guess it's an interesting question, but I think if we expect that the non atomic firms are going to crowd out the atomic traders because they have a lower cost and they can bid up the opportunity more than does it mean that the mev goes down? I think that would be illogical, right. The mev doesn't disappear just because it's being captured by non atomic players.
00:49:14.930 - 00:49:56.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess you could say the mev goes down just a different attack now. Yeah, I don't know, I think that's like a broader discussion on how to define things. But in the end I see the space going that way as well. Right. I think that a lot of this stuff is going to professionalize and a lot of strategies from trying to find things are going to roll over into how some of this stuff is done. I think a lot of Mev shops right now are unsophisticated. They haven't looked into things like how inventory is handled at HFT firms and things like that.
00:49:56.858 - 00:50:48.074, Speaker B: But then I also think that HFT firms will inevitably have a lot of hard need to do that they didn't have to do in the TradFi space just because of the nature of the system that they're interacting with. Right. The way to win in HFT is you pay more money to be closer to Wall Street, essentially, so that you get the shortest cable, or that's one of the big ways to win. Right. That's not really the way that you end up winning in mev, or I don't think that's how you end up winning in mev in the long term, because otherwise you're just giving all of your money to various validators or you're using a public private mem pool like Flashbots, which is of a disadvantage to you as well.
00:50:48.112 - 00:51:25.686, Speaker C: For what it's worth, really quickly, I don't think this inherent centralization that we're going towards is a totally bad thing either. Right. For what it's worth, a lot of what happens in Mev today is reapplying the same things that HFT in the traditional world has seen 1015 years ago, but just doing it in a more decentralized and publicly auditable way. Right. Where today you can't see what order flows Citadel is trading on that comes from Robinhood. If Citadel were to do that same type of thing in Ethereum today, or with the various designs that have been proposed to do that type of stuff, it'd be much more public and auditable. Right.
00:51:25.686 - 00:51:29.366, Speaker C: So it's like a better way of doing what TradFi has already experimented with.
00:51:29.468 - 00:51:56.830, Speaker E: I mean, just on that vein, Dean, you were starting to get into kind of a thread of the formula for winning in HFT and TradFi is you buy up space in New Jersey that's very close to the exchange, right. In this kind of Chicago, New Jersey pipeline, so to speak. If you had, know, be super reductive for mev describe. Okay, so that's the way you win in TradFi, HFT what's? The way that you win in crypto?
00:51:59.090 - 00:52:07.302, Speaker F: It's actually, I think it's like, almost outdated right. That you only need to be very close to.
00:52:07.436 - 00:52:55.842, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very outdated view of it. You have that plus the engineering chops that you require right now. Because everyone has the shortest cable, you inevitably have to do optimizations elsewhere. Elsewhere being making sure your code is the fastest. And I think in TradFi, it looked more cable, less code optimization, whereas in Mev right now, it looks less cable, more code optimization. That's at least how I view it. But I think that probably shifts to an equilibrium on both, whereas probably in HFT, it might already be at that equilibrium.
00:52:55.986 - 00:53:48.050, Speaker F: I think it probably differs by how the sequencer works. So on Ethereum layer one, where you have mev auctions, definitely you have more code optimization and size of balance sheet. And on layer two, where you have kind of a latency auction. Now, the quote unquote cable length is very important, but something else that I was alluding to, I think it's a the code optimization, I think it's the size of the balance sheet. I think it's the proximity to exchanges, but it's also how fast you can ingest information, which is what both of you were talking about in kind of your data ingestion efforts. And also how fast you can move information across the globe in a way that doesn't rely on public Internet infrastructure. Right? So I think we're seeing a lot of the HFT firms operating their own microwave tower infrastructure.
00:53:48.050 - 00:53:55.862, Speaker F: I don't know if any of them are operating satellites that's probably not faster. I'm not sure, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that.
00:53:55.916 - 00:55:08.254, Speaker C: Honestly. From my perspective, I think what works in the traditional world with centralized exchanges is basically a one to one mapping to how it is in NEP. Right. From my perspective, the three things that you need to do on is how optimized your code is, how low level are you, how good is your networking stack, how quickly can you ingest transactions, how quickly can you emit orders, how quickly can you cancel orders, and how much exclusive order flow do you have from venues like Robinhood and things like that? And the way that I see it, that's identical to what makes you successful in crypto, save for perhaps your crypto Nativity and how deep you can go into protocols. Other than that, it's how close am I to the sequencer, how quickly can I ingest transactions, how much of the validator network do I see, how close to them am I? Do I have exclusive order flow from some DApps or some exchanges and things like that? So yeah, for me it's mostly the same thing. What works in the traditional world works really well in mev, which is why there's a lot of traditional firms that are now coming into mev and are doing decently well.
00:55:08.292 - 00:55:08.494, Speaker E: Right.
00:55:08.532 - 00:55:09.870, Speaker C: It's their bread and butter.
00:55:12.690 - 00:55:25.960, Speaker F: Is either of you working with exclusive order flow? So not one that I'm not speaking about order flow that you create, rather, but that you purchased and purchase and then interact with in some way.
00:55:28.650 - 00:55:34.520, Speaker C: I think you'd be hard pressed to find any searcher that would admit that they pay for order fund.
00:55:38.580 - 00:55:40.880, Speaker F: Okay, that's also an interesting answer.
00:55:40.950 - 00:56:32.548, Speaker E: I mean, this is something that we kind of touched an issue. Sort of just hit it with your three buckets there. But I'd be curious just how you think about the increased role of latency in the searching game. I think HASUs kind of flagged it as like, what you don't necessarily want, at least from the perspective of Ethereum, is to be an mev system that's completely optimized on latency because that just presents for certain risks, sort of geographical risk, and regulatory risk being very prevalent there. But I'd be curious to understand how latency has kind of the role of latency has kind of evolved and maybe going back to kind of your early days of searching, like, how much of that was a vector of competition for you? How much time do you spend thinking about latency today? And how do you expect that to kind of evolve into the future?
00:56:32.634 - 00:57:50.940, Speaker C: Sure, couple of things to unpack there. I guess the first thing is how does latency play a role today? I'd say network optimizations are probably the easiest pickings I can get in mev, right. Where even before I try to optimize code hotpaths, if you're a competent searcher, you write code out of the box that isn't particularly unperformant. Right. It's not horrible code optimizing that might shave off a couple of milliseconds, but you're much better off trying to optimize your networking stack where you're playing in the tens of or hundreds of milliseconds to get around the globe. And so I'd say in terms of latency, for at least myself, just optimizing networking and getting better, latency has the best advantage. It's especially important in L two S, where the entire game for things like arbitram and optimism is how quickly can you see a transaction and how quickly can you fire off your transaction? And that's true of things like Dean's on BSc, and I'm sure he can say that back running on BSc, for example, is 100% a game of networking infrastructure, right? It's how quickly can I see and respond to these transactions? And so I think that's where latency plays in on Ethereum.
00:57:50.940 - 00:58:05.772, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, latency continues to play a role even in ways that we wouldn't expect. Like a good example is there's a latency that's involved with simulating blocks that are submitted to relays.
00:58:05.836 - 00:58:06.064, Speaker B: Right?
00:58:06.102 - 00:58:45.420, Speaker C: So if I submit a block to the flashbots relay today, it takes, say, 200 milliseconds for them to validate that that block is valid. Which means that I miss out on the last 200 milliseconds of a twelve second window to submit a block versus, say, ultrasound relay, where they have optimistic relaying. Which means that I now have better performing, higher paying bundles and blocks simply because I can fit more transactions in and don't have to worry about that latency loss due to simulation. So that's latency in a different way that it affects Ethereum today. And this is like data we've seen over even the last month as they've enabled optimistic relaying.
00:58:46.080 - 00:59:06.576, Speaker E: I don't know if you have anything to add, Dean, but Anisha, that's just interesting to hear you say that. We had Justin Drake on in our first episode of the season, and he was actually talking about, from his perspective as the operator of the ultrasound relay, just how important latency was and some of the small adjustments they made so that they could lower their latency even further and then win more blocks.
00:59:06.608 - 00:59:07.044, Speaker B: So just.
00:59:07.082 - 00:59:09.796, Speaker E: Interesting to kind of hear you validate the other side of that.
00:59:09.898 - 00:59:30.472, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I'll validate it again, the optimizations we focus on 95% of the time is latency networking because yeah, usually a win. There is a ten x multiple on what you would get over some shitty go memory or whatever language you're using. Optimization.
00:59:30.616 - 01:00:30.080, Speaker F: Anisha, I would maybe push back on something that you said a little earlier, where you said, maybe it's not so bad for crypto if we end up with a similar market structure as I mean, I would also argue that I think wholesale pfov gets sort of an unnecessarily bad reputation in terms of the execution that it provides. The execution is great, but I think what it does is very centralizing on the market structure in a way that's not a big problem in TradFi, but in Crypto, you kind of have the block builders also playing this very important role in providing very fundamental network guarantees. And I think if you have too much of a concentration on that layer, then it ends up affecting kind of the whole crypto stack. And that's my concern why I think we kind of need to try to evolve the market structure in a way that hopefully leads to a less concentrated outcome.
01:00:31.380 - 01:01:14.424, Speaker C: That makes sense to me. Although my counterpoint there is block building today is already centralized to the large extent in terms of competition where the same five or six block builders make up 95% of blocks on Ethereum today. And I expect those same entities are also going to be the ones that are taking proprietary order flow and then putting it into their own blocks. And so from my perspective at least, it's like the shift doesn't really look much different than where we are today. And it may actually, like you said, better execution. It's probably going to be more beneficial for users at the end of the day and less will go to validators through kickbacks and things like that. And the entities that are involved will largely stay the same from my perspective.
01:01:14.424 - 01:01:30.692, Speaker C: Right, so it's like we're only getting better from here on out, right. We're not really making anything detrimental though. I get what you're saying though, that inherent centralization factor. But it'll become much harder for the average entity to compete and to join in on compared to today. I agree with that.
01:01:30.826 - 01:01:31.124, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:31.162 - 01:02:05.320, Speaker F: And, I mean, there are also techniques that we can enable, I think, that kind of make stuff like censorship harder, stuff like enabling kind of private mempools. Memphis that may also be private from the builder, but also techniques such as partial block building, where maybe the station committee builds part of the block and block builder builds the other part of the block or whatever. I think yeah, this is all stuff that Vitalik laid out in his endgame post, which I would recommend everyone to read. So I think yeah, it's a very interesting debate.
01:02:05.480 - 01:03:12.150, Speaker E: Maybe we can sort of start to wind down here, but I'd love to just get your thoughts, like actually moving out of the weeds here for a second and sort of getting your thoughts on. One very popular debate in mev is it kind of manifests around the fair ordering versus auction maximalization. But there is still kind of a very consistent camp of people who say, mev is this sort of bad negative externality that should be avoided and we should do everything that we can in terms of mechanism, design or thinking about it when we're designing consensus or how these systems work to mitigate mev or just sort of eliminate it. And then there's kind of this other camp that says mev is inevitable, whether it's in crypto systems or Google AdWords or wherever, it kind of exists in life. And ultimately what we should be doing is extracting that mev and then making sure that it gets distributed back to the users or to the validators that are securing the network or searchers that kind of come up with these algorithms or whatever it is. So I'd love to kind of understand where both of you fall on that spectrum and then.
01:03:14.280 - 01:03:14.948, Speaker C: It'S kind of a.
01:03:14.954 - 01:03:17.764, Speaker E: High minded word to use, but sort of the morality and the ethics that.
01:03:17.802 - 01:04:09.984, Speaker C: Underlie mev, I think mev is inevitable. It will always exist in systems. And you should protocol designers, application designers should think of mev when they are building their applications and attempt to minimize it to the extent that's possible, but it will never be possible to completely eliminate it from my perspective. As for the ethics, frankly, I think in my role as a searcher, I do a service to the ecosystem by providing better execution and extracting what value. It's kind of like if it's not me, then that value isn't extracted at all. This leads to more efficient prices, this leads to potentially better kickbacks for users in the future, leads to better revenues for validators. And so ethically, I think it's perfectly fine to extract mev.
01:04:10.112 - 01:04:58.070, Speaker B: Yeah, mev is inevitable. I have always said that we might be able to reduce it to some meaningless amount, but inevitably it will still be there. I do think that we should spend time reducing it as far as possible on the protocol level. And I think the ETH core research and stuff like that is definitely leading on that front. Ethically, I feel the same as anish I view mev from an accelerationist standpoint. It's like somebody's going to have to extract it and show where the flaws lie. And looking at it in theory, we only get so far.
01:04:58.070 - 01:05:27.496, Speaker B: A lot of the issues probably weren't apparent to us two, three years ago until people started actually doing mev and we uncover all these inefficiencies on this network. And so yeah, I think not only is it doing a service from the points that Anish mentions, but also it's helping to uncover and turn Ethereum and all other chains into more anti fragile systems.
01:05:27.608 - 01:05:55.064, Speaker F: Both of you dropped so much good knowledge in this podcast already, so thank you for that. I do want to end on the question, if you had to kind of take an intern in the Mev space, there's a new Dung and Hungry Kit upcoming searcher wants to break into Mev. How would you recommend they go about it? What is the kind of skills that they need to pick up, and would you recommend kind of they reach out.
01:05:55.102 - 01:05:57.816, Speaker E: Towards their starting point, know how to.
01:05:57.838 - 01:06:14.590, Speaker B: Code and know how ethereum works, and then just DM me for anyone who's DM me before knows that I'm pretty responsive on Twitter. And it wouldn't be the first time I hire someone who sends me a Twitter DM and a GitHub link.
01:06:15.440 - 01:06:16.510, Speaker F: Do you take.
01:06:20.240 - 01:06:29.276, Speaker B: I mean, most of the Project Blanc team is publicly anonymous. We have Add ons even at Dialectic at the yeah, yeah.
01:06:29.318 - 01:06:59.740, Speaker C: I'd probably say know how to code very well, understand ethereum, and then honestly, there's a lot of opportunities that are still public. Flashbots maintains a GitHub repository of here are some opportunities that need keepers or liquidators or things like that. And even there, there's still money to be made. I think the only way you can get into it is by doing. And so whip out a code under. And even if you won't make much money, try to be competitive in one of those strategies and that'll teach you a lot and get you down the rabbit hole.
01:07:00.560 - 01:07:11.936, Speaker F: Give me an underrated quality in mev. What's something that nobody else appreciates if you had to hire someone that you would actually value a lot?
01:07:12.038 - 01:07:32.230, Speaker B: I mean, the thing I mainly look for is someone's resilience how many times they can get punched in the stomach and keep going. And that's more so than any other job. I don't think that's a unique skill. I think you just need to have a far higher pain tolerance working in MEB than you do in software engineering in general.
01:07:32.780 - 01:07:35.130, Speaker F: Any advice on how to test for that?
01:07:37.420 - 01:07:51.870, Speaker B: I think you can easily tell that from a person's character from like three days of working with them. That's probably the most practical. Work with someone for a bit and see how fast they give up.
01:07:53.280 - 01:08:30.228, Speaker C: The most common trope is probably that mev is sexy and everything I'm going to do is landing ARBs and making money. And I'd say that's maybe 5% of it, 95% of it is taking systems you've already got, making sure they don't break maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, over and over in an environment where inherently everything is set out to break around you. And so, yeah, plus one on the resilience, look for people that don't mind the grunt work of just being in there and just doing it every single day. And it might not be the sexiest work of finding Arps that's once in a blue moon.
01:08:30.324 - 01:08:59.120, Speaker E: Dude, I've got a question for you, actually. Just as someone who runs an mev shop. What's your strategy for maintaining, finding and maintaining people in a super specialized field? Because I would imagine one of the challenges is a bunch of people would like, I could either work at Project Blanc, or I could do what Anisha is doing and then just go and sort of find my own long tail mev. And I'm assuming that that's a pretty attractive opportunity, kind of do my own thing.
01:08:59.190 - 01:09:24.680, Speaker B: How do you sort of keep my answer to that is always you could make a million dollars a year and work like 18 hours days, or you could make $10 million a year and work ten hour days. And I'll offer the latter, but Anisi is really happy with the former.
01:09:25.040 - 01:09:28.060, Speaker E: Pretty attractive value proposition there, Dean.
01:09:28.480 - 01:09:33.276, Speaker B: That's pretty good. You pay them well.
01:09:33.378 - 01:09:34.350, Speaker C: That's how.
01:09:36.320 - 01:09:52.820, Speaker B: All right. I think I said all of these things are going to turn to teams just because the overhead of doing several strategies by yourself, it's a lot of work. Everyone we hired on the team went through a burnout because they were trying to do it themselves.
01:09:52.970 - 01:10:15.450, Speaker E: All right, guys, well, you've both been super generous with your time. If folks want to either get in contact or find out more about the work you do, I will plug you Dean here and say the Project Blanc website is probably my favorite website I've seen in quite some time. It's got very simple message on there, but people can change it.
01:10:16.940 - 01:10:22.190, Speaker B: I had to change it while the lawyers were setting up incorporation because they didn't like what it said.
01:10:23.360 - 01:10:32.930, Speaker E: Actually, you know, could you just say because Project Blanc has a very cool sort of history, and I'm a huge nerd for this kind of stuff. What does Project Blanc mean? What does that refer to?
01:10:33.940 - 01:11:42.920, Speaker B: It refers to these two guys in France, back in the 18 hundreds or something. And they did arbitrage because what happened in France is the stock exchange was in Paris, and the way they would notify price updates is there would be a coach every day that went from Paris to wherever they lived, which was like two or three days away by horse. But Paris or France had this great infrastructure of semaphores everywhere across the entire country to which the government could communicate messages. What these two brothers realized is that there's an error correction system. So what they did is they bribed the guy at the Semaphore in Paris and the guy where they lived to do price updates or put price updates within the error correction system of this Semaphore. And so they get price updates within hours, rather within days. And we're able to trade based on those price movements.
01:11:45.260 - 01:11:47.320, Speaker F: Some true HFT shit.
01:11:47.660 - 01:12:02.220, Speaker B: And nothing ever happened because there was no law for this. So it was truly the first Mev. Right. They were taken to court and everything, but the French government was like, we have no law for this. This is fair game.
01:12:02.290 - 01:12:33.284, Speaker E: That reminds me, I think there was this it might have been the Rothschild. There was one of those, know, families that made a ton of money in sort of the old world, but they had a similar strategy in the Battle of Waterloo. They paid a messenger to basically run back to London faster than anyone else so they could trade off that information. So, yeah, mev existed long before crypto. So, yeah, definitely check out Dean's website. And then Anish, if people wanted to follow you or find out more about you or whatever, just what's the best.
01:12:33.322 - 01:12:34.116, Speaker A: Way to do that?
01:12:34.218 - 01:12:37.050, Speaker C: They can just reach out on Twitter. The easiest way to reach.
01:12:37.740 - 01:12:38.344, Speaker A: Awesome.
01:12:38.462 - 01:12:44.680, Speaker E: All right, well, this has been a super fascinating conversation, guys. Thank you so much for joining us.
01:12:44.750 - 01:12:45.852, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
01:12:45.986 - 01:13:01.440, Speaker A: All right, man, what an interesting conversation. I was really looking forward to this one. Like, hearing from people who are actually doing kind of live searching. So thankful that both those guys kind of gave us their time. What were your takeaways hasu?
01:13:02.340 - 01:13:58.290, Speaker D: My takeaways? They weren't sharing quite as much and as openly as I was hoping, to be quite honest with you, but I still thought there were some real nuggets in that conversation. I think especially on niche. I think he dropped a lot of interesting, just like, high level descriptions of how the MEP space works and what it takes to be a good searcher. I thought that they both did. I think this control of the networking stack, having exclusive order flow, but then also this deep and very low level understanding of the domain that you're working on and ingesting information and so on. I thought this was a very holistic overview that we got from them about the real kind of operations of a searcher or of a searching team.
01:13:58.660 - 01:14:40.412, Speaker A: Yeah, I like the buckets that Anish sort of gave us for what makes a good searcher, and I was kind of hoping to get a stack rank for those. Like if you had to prioritize, sort know, networking versus code optimization versus kind of your latency or your view of the network. But it sounded like all three of those things were frankly very important. And some of that just depends on your strategy. Like, I would sort of guess based on that conversation that for short tail, maybe your view of the network is slightly more important or access to proprietary order flow. And then if you're long tail, that's slightly less important and you really want to be your networking stack and code optimization, you got to be top notch.
01:14:40.476 - 01:15:55.784, Speaker D: So Anish didn't say that, but I know for a fact that there are long tail searchers who deliberately do not even use Flashbots Protect. Not sorry, not flashpots protect, but the flashpots block builder or flashbots relay. And not any of the other builders either, because they use the public mempool kind of like direct to a validator connection so that they run even their own validator in order to get a transaction mined in a way that other searchers don't observe it after the fact. Because it's a lot about kind of stealing. It's not about an unbundling like we've seen in the past like a couple of weeks ago in Mefboost, it's more about searchers analyzing after the fact what other searchers are doing and then copying their strategies and getting alerted to nice opportunities. And so all transactions that are being mined by the main block builders, those are under the microscope, right, by the entire searcher community. And that's why some searchers take the deliberately kind of the long way in order to get transactions mined that maybe more expensive, maybe have higher latency, but it doesn't matter because they don't have a lot of competition in the particular strategies that they are doing.
01:15:55.784 - 01:15:59.960, Speaker D: And so it's okay. So for them, it's actually more important to stay under the radar.
01:16:00.380 - 01:16:39.760, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very well said. It's funny and even in your interview, interview with a searcher when was that? Three years ago, maybe in 2020. Mev Sempai said something very similar to that, which is for some of my juicy opportunities, I won't submit it through Flashbots. This was when it was still proof of work. So it's kind of interesting. I don't know if you have something to say there. I had another takeaway actually, which was a lot of this season I'd been thinking about I kind of went into this episode wanting to ask them quite a bit about the searcher versus builder dynamic.
01:16:39.760 - 01:17:20.496, Speaker A: But it was interesting to hear Dean say ultimately where he viewed his sort of competition and his end game is in between himself as the searcher and the validators. And that was sort of a light bulb for me, which I guess when I looked at it should be sort of obvious. And I'd be curious what you kind of thought of that. And then I guess the obvious conclusion to that is, yeah, if I was a searcher, I could either send these bundles and these interesting arbitrage or whatever sort of extraction opportunities to someone else and hope that it gets put on chain or I could just run a validator myself and that kind of seems obvious.
01:17:20.598 - 01:18:06.210, Speaker D: So you have to put that in the context that kind of dean's firm is on a lot of chains that do not have proposal builder. You would as a searcher, you can submit your bundles to block builders in Ethereum and then you can get access to a lot of the block space, a lot of the validators through Mafboost. That same mechanism does not necessarily exist. Right. And so for many opportunities, you kind of do not have this luxury of submitting directly. You don't have this channel where you can submit to validators. And so that's why very often the best thing that you can do is actually run a lot of validators themselves.
01:18:06.210 - 01:19:17.640, Speaker D: Searchers see this as something positive, but at Flashbots we see this as something that's very negative. So this vertical integration between searchers and validators was the entire reason why Flashbots end up creating the original Mafgaf because we did not want that kind of this vertical integration between the two roles to the point that some validators would end up making a lot more money than other validators and causing centralization on the validator layer. So I think it's very understandable that players like Dean and Project Blank are kind of pursuing this route of running their own veldors. But this is something that these layer two or layer one ecosystems really need to think very carefully about. If they see that this is something that's going on, and I can assure you it is going on on kind of all of these chains, what do they want to do about it? And my response would be you need proposal builder separation in order to protect the decentralization of your validator layer.
01:19:18.380 - 01:19:37.392, Speaker A: Yeah, very well said. And just to give listeners a perspective, there's a very big difference between the environment that Dean is operating in where there are twelve validators that are operated by finance, versus how many validators are there. On ethereum. There's some 500,000.
01:19:37.526 - 01:19:40.976, Speaker D: Yeah, not at the same time, but yeah, exactly.
01:19:41.078 - 01:19:51.650, Speaker A: So just super different environment, obviously. But it was just interesting to hear his perspective there.
01:19:52.980 - 01:21:21.196, Speaker D: You know what else I thought was really interesting? How they both said 80% of searching is basically latency optimization. So I think in the previous episodes we were talking a lot about this latency between a builder sending a block to a valdator or kind of a searcher sending a bundle to a builder. But I think what this episode really drew out was looking at the entire almost like lifecycle of an mev opportunity because they both were kind of alluding to this idea that you basically need these elaborate pricing models, right? You want to build this picture of what the fair price should be like a what the market prices are of different assets in the world and then B, what you think the correct prices should be, right? And then you want some kind of mechanisms to act on that. And so there's a lot of ingesting information as fast as possible and then simulating against that and then translating that into some opportunities that you want to put into action. And we only talked about the latter, but I think what both Anish and Dean were saying is that actually the former, this ingestion step, this is actually the even more important part. And there's nothing really that, for example, core developers in Ethereum or Flashpoints, et cetera, can do in order to make that any easier for these searchers.
01:21:21.228 - 01:21:21.424, Speaker F: Right?
01:21:21.462 - 01:21:34.150, Speaker D: And so this will probably always be something where a lot of competitive advantage can be had and that can end up being kind of a very centralizing force as well.
01:21:35.240 - 01:21:42.470, Speaker A: Did you agree with what Anish said, that basically everything that worked in TradFi and HFT is largely going to work in.
01:21:47.800 - 01:21:48.336, Speaker F: It'S?
01:21:48.368 - 01:22:37.240, Speaker D: Like, I think it's probably right, but I don't think it's desirable. So I think we can just empirically say that all of the strategies that are proven to work in TradFi, they are coming to crypto. They are coming in a big way. So there are kind of major trading firms in crypto that are now running their own microwave tower basically. Right? So it's just like this stuff is coming and it's not just that, it's like crypto firms kind of adopting these techniques now. It's also from the other end, you have the big firms from outside of crypto now pushing into crypto and they bring all of this expertise and they bring all of this existing infrastructure. Right? And so I think you kind of see this convergence from both ends.
01:22:37.240 - 01:23:47.584, Speaker D: I think it is on us that we have the opportunity to actually build systems that are maybe more fair, more open and kind of better in some ways than the systems that we have in TradFi. Even in TradFi. So, for example, from Professor Eric Buddhish, we have seen sort of excellent proposals about kind of the New York Stock Exchange adopting frequent batch auctions. And he's kind of made all of these models to show how they can eliminate the mev that is most of the mev that is kind of leaked to these latency wars between HFT firms. But there are kind of political and historical reasons why these things are very likely to be ever adopted in TradFi. But here we have kind of the chance to build entirely new systems that do not have the same amount of entrenched players yet. I definitely think that it's correct and it's a threat that we need to be very vigilant against.
01:23:47.782 - 01:23:48.432, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:23:48.566 - 01:24:41.168, Speaker A: What do you think about I liked, by the way, that word, the lifecycle of an mev opportunity. I thought that was a really interesting concept. It seems like in mev it's almost like centralization whack a mole in a way where you focus on trying to prevent centralization in one part of the supply or the value chain, like, let's say the validator level right now. But then what I heard Anish say sort of in response to one of your questions was, well, right now 95% of the blocks are built by these highly centralized builders, right? And there are like five of those. And if you're a builder, you have a lot of advantages that you don't necessarily have as a searcher. For instance, you can have bundles that sandwich other bundles, right. You just have the entire view of the block and there's a much richer design space for the sorts of extraction opportunities that you have.
01:24:41.168 - 01:25:33.036, Speaker A: And then even I know we'll talk about this with John and you I heard you discuss this with PBS kind of at the layer two level or at the roll up level where sequencers today it's almost like taking a step back. And now we don't have PBS on layer twos, and that's where a bunch of the value change is going to happen. So maybe less of a question to you than just an observation that it's just very tough, right. And centralization pops up in a whole bunch of different so all right, well, I think we can call it there. I think the next episode that we'll be doing is actually with some of the guys from Solana. So we're going to be talking to Lucas and Eugene from Solana. And that's a very different ecosystem.
01:25:33.036 - 01:25:44.336, Speaker A: Mev works very differently on Solana than it does on ethereum. So we'll have a lot of specific questions for them about that. But for now, this has been a ton of fun hasu.
01:25:44.368 - 01:26:33.404, Speaker D: And I look very much forward to the episode on Solana because I think especially with Eugene, I think we can have a great conversation about the pros and cons of latency. I think he'll make the argument that you want low latency systems because they can generally provide a better service. But then you still need to balance that with kind of providing a fair mev extraction system, which is where I think then GTO Labs is going to come in and we will try to understand exactly how they can provide a flashboards like offering on a low latency chain. So that's a very interesting prototype, I would say, or case study, where if this works, then maybe we can find techniques kind of to have lower latency and still preserve this kind of decentralization guarantee.
01:26:33.532 - 01:26:34.210, Speaker E: Absolutely.
01:26:34.820 - 01:26:38.130, Speaker A: All right, signing off.
01:26:41.460 - 01:26:42.980, Speaker B: You rapa.
