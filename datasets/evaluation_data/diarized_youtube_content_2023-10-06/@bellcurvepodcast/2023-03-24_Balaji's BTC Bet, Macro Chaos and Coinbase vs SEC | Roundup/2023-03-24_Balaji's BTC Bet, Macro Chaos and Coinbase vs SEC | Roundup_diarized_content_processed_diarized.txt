00:00:22.404 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker B: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.650 - 00:00:31.110, Speaker C: Michael's, one and two. Vance. No Yano this week. How are we doing guys?
00:00:31.180 - 00:00:37.590, Speaker D: Doing good. We actually got to hang with Yano this week. So where were you Mike?
00:00:38.010 - 00:00:43.820, Speaker C: I'm sorry, I guess my priorities aren't in order. I couldn't make it over there. How is he in person?
00:00:44.510 - 00:00:51.850, Speaker B: Tall, dressed nicely, felt like we weren't dressed in the nines like he was, but good to see him.
00:00:52.000 - 00:01:05.386, Speaker C: I was on that. You watched that Michael Howell thing? Michael Howell's in a suit, jack Farley's in a suit and I got a T shirt. I feel like a bum, but what are you going to do? I think I've owned my mike.
00:01:05.418 - 00:01:07.220, Speaker D: I listened to it, I didn't watch it.
00:01:07.590 - 00:01:13.220, Speaker C: I appreciate that. Thanks man. Well you heard about Yano and his statement. We're all really proud of him.
00:01:14.150 - 00:01:14.882, Speaker B: What did he?
00:01:14.936 - 00:01:38.534, Speaker C: Yeah, he said he's shaving his head bald. He's in solidarity with Brian. Hold on a second, you guys don't no, it's really good. Look at here. We've got to actually our team has done a little mockup of what this could potentially look like. You're going to be bald.
00:01:38.582 - 00:01:47.302, Speaker B: Your ears really got to be yeah, you got to be aerodynamic, not work with that.
00:01:47.456 - 00:01:49.790, Speaker D: Might want to invest in some Scotch tape.
00:01:58.630 - 00:02:16.710, Speaker C: All right. With that I think we can let's get into it. So, yeah, this is Bell curve. This is a macro pod. So we got to talk about FOMC this week. Yeah. So basically the high level is there was the 25 basis point hike that we all sort of knew was going to happen.
00:02:16.710 - 00:02:52.820, Speaker C: I think the thing that people were looking forward to is the context going into the FOMC was before this we had expected ongoing hikes. Right. So I think the expectation was if I had to put a guess on it, it's probably like a series of 25 basis point hikes that was going to peter off for some period of time. Obviously with the amount of baking stress, like we'll talk about Credit Suisse a little later, but I think that spooked people a lot and there's still a lot of fear around regional banks. Like bank stocks are trading absolutely horrendously. I think they're going to put in a new low today. We're recording this on Thursday the 23rd.
00:02:52.820 - 00:03:31.070, Speaker C: So the question is how much more leeway do they have and is this going to get them to pause rate hikes? Powell comes in, he talks all about inflation. He doesn't really mention any stress in the banking sector whatsoever. It sounded pretty hawkish until we got to the reporter's questions and then there were a couple of pointed questions and he changed ongoing hikes to maybe some firming. And the exact words of Jay Powell was, I would direct your attention to May and some so everyone's trying to figure out what exactly that means. I'd be curious what your guys take was on that felt tense.
00:03:33.250 - 00:04:15.294, Speaker B: The vibe last time when inflation was lower, jerome was smiling, saying the world deflation a was, you know, laughing. Even now it's like you could cut the tension with a knife. You can tell he does not want to be there. You can tell this is probably one of the last hikes that he does. You can probably tell that he might not be in this job for too much longer if things keep going south. Like this bank index, all these bank stocks, they are trading like dogecoin and you literally have like the luna chart where it just drops off. I'm not a macroeconomist, but it doesn't look good for Jerome at this point or really any of his plans as a result.
00:04:15.412 - 00:04:58.362, Speaker D: I was going to say 100% agree with all that. It reminded me of sort of the reciprocal of I think it was June or July last year, where he literally gets up to the podium and he's holding a piece of paper and he's shaking because he knows what is about to like this feels like the equivalent of that. You can't go back in your words, I mean, you kind of have to do what he did, but at the same time he knows you're meeting in a hard place with rate hikes or anything that's going on. I just looked up FRC, first Republic Bank down another 7% today. I mean, they are 91% off the all time high, which is just six months ago. It's not looking good.
00:04:58.416 - 00:05:44.326, Speaker C: It's bad the two year as well. So if you look at what the bond market is pricing in, I mean, the two year fell in anticipated even before the FOMC, and then it fell even lower after Jerome finished talking. Basically the thing to understand about the two year is the two year and the FOMC policy rate typically walk hand in hand, right? So the two year dipping lower says that's where the market thinks that the policy rate should be. And Jerome has it at 5%. The two years just below 4%. So usually when this happens, the Fed comes to the market instead of the other way around. And also typically when the two year crosses the FOMC, that is historically when the Fed starts to change their monetary policy and start cutting instead of hiking.
00:05:44.326 - 00:05:47.580, Speaker C: So the signs are kind of there.
00:05:47.950 - 00:06:28.566, Speaker B: I mean, you can kind of call it, it's been a year of rate hikes and it feels like it's probably over. If this is the first hiking cycle that you've lived through, congratulations. If you're still here and alive and excited about crypto. But even a year ago, prices were probably not exactly where they are today, but roughly similar. We've just had so many casualties, even Doe getting arrested or whoever, if that was like DOE's body double and like Negro, we don't know what exactly happened, but we've come so far and so many people have left. It does feel like a lot of the damage has been done to the extent it would have been done.
00:06:28.668 - 00:07:01.838, Speaker D: The two year right now, at least according to trading view on my phone, is at 3.77%. The 30 year this is interesting, is at 3.67%. And granted the ten year is at 3.38. But what we're talking about here is for the last, I don't know how long it's been, nine months, ten months, we've had an inverted yield curve. We actually might be getting back to where the two year is below the 30 year for the first time in a long time. And what that suggests is that rates are going to drop in the short term, they're going to rise in the long term.
00:07:01.934 - 00:07:39.200, Speaker C: Exactly. And the Fed has an enormous amount of control over the short end of the curve going out to about like definitely two. But even through kind of five years, the further you get out, the more that's about expectations in terms of growth. And you know, another thing too that I've just been thinking about this week is it is very difficult to run a bank with an inverted yield curve. And it's kind of a banks to drastically oversimplify are supposed to borrow short and lend long. That doesn't work if the short rates are higher than the long rates. It's a tough feature if that's how you fight inflation as well.
00:07:39.570 - 00:07:52.958, Speaker B: Do we ever find out who owns these bank stocks? These must be sitting in large mutual funds or retirees accounts. I can't name a single person who's ever owned any of the shares of any of these banks.
00:07:53.054 - 00:07:58.902, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's probably spread out throughout the S and P 500 index funds, mutual funds, zero.
00:07:58.956 - 00:08:07.394, Speaker B: Hedge says we've taken about, I think, 400 billion off of financials since the start. It's like that is half of crypto wiped.
00:08:07.522 - 00:08:46.290, Speaker D: I think the other thing, Mike, that you just touched on, which I think is an important call out, is the variable that's still in play that we don't really have any control over directly is inflation. And the price metric or the inflation metric that Vance and I tracked is the Cleveland Fed puts out the inflation now casting. And as of today CPI month over month is at 0.3%. PCE is at zero point 28%. So if you analyze that, we're actually very close to getting to that whatever 2% 2.8% is going to become like the new normal of whatever the Fed decides is the new rate of inflation. That's acceptable.
00:08:46.290 - 00:09:26.370, Speaker D: But the other thing too is that historically, over the last four months, five months. The inflation now casting print has been higher than what the actual read is. So this March read, which is we're on the 23 March, so not done yet, but that's where it's trending, I think. Could be something that suggests that inflation is now not the primary cause. And remember, we also don't have anything until May from the Fed. So there's going to be two months of inflation prints before we actually get another Fed meeting, which will be really interesting to know how the market prices in these changes in between now and then.
00:09:26.440 - 00:09:51.610, Speaker B: Hear me out. The war resolves inflation, resolves rate cuts, growth scare passes. That's the bull case. I think the Bear case, which is the one I hear the most, is kind of like reminds me a lot of COVID of the market has it wrong. These banks are not going to be able to lend. We've lost business confidence. All of these businesses are kind of upside down in their unit economics.
00:09:51.610 - 00:10:03.030, Speaker B: I don't know, you just keep seeing tech rip and Gold is now at almost its all time high. I think this could be another extremely hated rally.
00:10:03.110 - 00:10:37.986, Speaker C: Yeah, you could be right. I mean, this is where the people have been saying this for a long time. So just like take this with a big grain of salt. But people have been saying for a long time, the rubber is going to meet the road. When you have these incredibly high levels of debt, the Fed and central banks globally have been very willing to ease rates. It's been these kind of a free lunch in a lot of people's eyes, but now that's just much tougher to do when you have inflation. And that point that you brought up, vance about banks, jerome Powell the way he phrased it actually was the contraction in credit is basically going to be equivalent to a rate hike.
00:10:37.986 - 00:10:52.398, Speaker C: Because what they're trying to do is they're trying to control the amount of credit that's in the system. And banks going under this amount of stress, they're not going to be as willing to extend credit. So the financial conditions have tightened considerably since last week as well.
00:10:52.484 - 00:11:07.410, Speaker B: If you think the bank stuff is really bad, that's like ten rate hikes. You're just basically telling people like, okay, no more lending. I don't know, he just seems increasingly out of touch with reality. I don't think it's going to go very well for him.
00:11:07.560 - 00:11:22.760, Speaker C: Well, for folks in crypto, it's not as drastic in terms of percentages, but it's similar to what happened when all of our CFI lenders blew up the contraction and credit in OurSPACE. This is going on on a much larger scale, right?
00:11:23.290 - 00:11:29.960, Speaker B: Yeah. It's not like blowing up all of the crypto lenders was equivalent to hiking funding rates. It's just like the system had a heart attack.
00:11:30.490 - 00:11:58.994, Speaker C: I don't know what particular insights you may or may not have about Credit Suisse but I do think it's worth I mean, it feels like forever ago that this happened. But Credit Suisse, they are not First Republic. They are not Silicon Valley bank. They are a very old, very well established bank. At one point, they had about just under 1 trillion in terms of assets that's fallen in recent years. They made a bunch of bad decisions. We've got the full list here.
00:11:58.994 - 00:12:36.382, Speaker C: But, yeah, it's not been a good decade for credit suites. They lost five and a half billion on the Archegos blow up after making 17 and a half million in fees, which just seems like the worst risk reward of all time. They lost 1.7 billion on this green cell capital trade financing type fund, which was a little bit of a scandal when it was happening over in Europe. They lost 100 million on the Citrix debt deal. So it's been a tough decade for them, basically. But they got bought in basically a fire sale by UBS at $2 billion.
00:12:36.382 - 00:13:16.614, Speaker C: There was actually something pretty significant that happened, by the way, in terms of governance around the shareholders of Credit Suisse. They were excluded in this deal by the Swiss government. And this is where I don't really know this. I've sort of read the headlines, but there was a series of bonds, some pretty significant amount of value that was held in these bonds that got wiped even though 2 billion in equity was protected. That is the opposite of how that is supposed to work. Debt is supposed to be senior in the capital structure over equity. So this is where look, I'm not an expert in this, so I kind of hesitate to talk about it because it's out of my realm.
00:13:16.614 - 00:13:26.350, Speaker C: But people were up in arms, I think, rightly so, because the stuff that holds our financial system together, property laws, seems to have been disrespected here, to say the least.
00:13:26.500 - 00:13:54.098, Speaker B: Feels like we're doing this Men in Black style concerted effort to memory hole all of this stuff or to sweep it under the rug. Like when Silicon Valley blew up or Silicon Valley Bank blew up. Everyone was acting like that was like a college credit union that just got destroyed. It's like, no, that's like a huge it's the second largest bank failure. You know, now it's spread, and it's not just the tech bank, it's like more banks. First Republic people are trying to say, oh yeah, we put deposits in. Well, it might actually fail.
00:13:54.098 - 00:14:28.500, Speaker B: And also we may need government assistance. Like, okay, we're trying to sweep that under the rug in Europe. Credit Suisse is one of the global, systematic, important banks, and it's just gone. And you wiped out 17 billion billion of bondholder value and something that probably is pretty legally questionable in terms of the transaction. It just feels like we're making this concerted media effort to not talk about it or not blow it out of proportion, but really the charts don't lie. If the bank stock index is about to hit a fresh all time low since COVID you might want to check on some things.
00:14:29.030 - 00:14:34.434, Speaker D: You forgot one, which is Signature Bank, also on a Sunday was shut down.
00:14:34.552 - 00:14:36.760, Speaker B: Zero when Signature Bank killed itself.
00:14:37.770 - 00:15:07.626, Speaker D: Yeah, right. It got suicided. I think there's going to be a lot of blowback from all of these actions because all of these things are going to get litigated in the courts eventually when the dust settles, when all this stuff stops, we're going to have some lawsuits. We're going to have some suits. We're going to have some figuring out what the hell happened and who made decisions. FOIA requests. There's going to be some questioning, there's going to be some depositions.
00:15:07.626 - 00:15:28.738, Speaker D: We're going to get to the bottom of this. But I agree, right now it looks pretty sketchy. That being said, there is kind of a funny tweet that I found this week. Credit Suisse fines by year. Did you guys see this? Total amounts of fine. I'll put it in the chat. I don't know if these are all going to the Swiss government.
00:15:28.738 - 00:15:54.910, Speaker D: 2022, 700,002,021, 280,002,018, 90,002,017, 5.4 billion. It just goes on and on back to 2002. It's pretty incredible. I mean, I think someone on some podcast this week talked about it, but it was like a very well known secret that Credit Suisse would do business with anyone. And I think the proof is in the pudding.
00:15:55.410 - 00:16:51.966, Speaker C: Other people have since brought up this point. I mean, look, if you do business with bad people, I think a lot of the charges that made their lives hard for the last decade where there were accusations of impropriety and stuff like that. But one of the challenges for banks, the implicit understanding of regional banks, is in order to compete with these gigantic banks that have access to the best customers, lowest cost capital, et cetera, you have to take a little bit more risk. So one of the undesirable kind of side effects of this whole weird thing that regulators are trying to do is they're making a very difficult environment to be a small regional bank. And that's just going to lead to more consolidation. And then I don't know, what's the difference then if there's only a couple of small banks, they become like arms of the state. They're kind of de facto nationalized in a way I find enormous issue with.
00:16:51.988 - 00:17:36.762, Speaker D: That at that point. They are nationalized. If we have four banks and all four of them are the service providers of all banking infrastructure for the entire country, for all businesses, for everywhere community, nationwide, federally, everything, that's a problem. That means that we have no competition in a major financial sector of supposed growth and you don't have diversification of products, like you don't have any sort of ability to compete and break through. So, yeah, what we're seeing right now is the riskiest. The most heterogeneous and very specific banks are going under the gun right now, but this is not over. I think that when Silicon Valley Bank blew up, one of the things that we talked about internally was, this is not the end, this is the beginning.
00:17:36.762 - 00:17:39.710, Speaker D: And I think we're starting to see the rest of the dominoes start to fall.
00:17:39.780 - 00:18:33.982, Speaker B: That's why I'm kind of like, I don't agree with Bellaji, but I see what he's doing and I see the dots he's connecting. And it feels like we're kind of building to that point in the macro sense, where it's like kind of getting frenzied and anything can happen, including Bitcoin going to a million, but not in the next 90 days. But if this is the path we're really going to go down, I definitely would not bet against Bellaji with any time frame less than a year. And maybe it's not a million, maybe it's something less than that. But the thing that I'm personally internalizing about where we are in the market right now feels like 2019 when everyone started to put out these crazy markers. Bitcoin is trading at three K at that point, and people are like, it's going to 100. Willow Woo is doing on chain analysis, it's going to 200 to 400.
00:18:33.982 - 00:19:15.914, Speaker B: And so people are starting to put these markers out. And the markers are such a key part of bull market psychology. Whether you want to do like Plan B, or maybe the rainbow chart is also plan B, I forget, but all these crazy kind of like Eric Wall. Yeah, that might be Eric, but people index on these things and they're kind of the roadmap for, okay, things look kind of crazy right now. Things look kind of bad, but we're staying till a million and a million is 50 X from here in Bitcoin or 40 x or whatever it is. So even despite it not reaching 100K last cycle, people are even more bullish. And that's the animal spirits that you think about.
00:19:15.914 - 00:19:18.602, Speaker B: That's when they're reignited, in my opinion.
00:19:18.746 - 00:20:03.882, Speaker D: My favorite line from the biology podcast on I think it was Moment of Zen, was he said, the critique that Mark Andreessen has given me is that when I'm right, I'm off by some order of time, but it happens or I'm too early. And when I'm wrong, I say it's going to eleven, but it only goes to eight or nine. And I think that that's a really good framework to think about belagi's perspectives, which is that directionally, he's probably right. Like, we're going to move in some direction that he is completely right about. He also was probably the one person in January, or like one of the ten people in January of 2020 that was calling that this was a lab outbreak. It was going to spread virally. It's going to be disastrous for the entire world.
00:20:03.882 - 00:20:20.274, Speaker D: You can't stop it. It's a viral outbreak. And he was completely right about that. And he was calling it three months before basically anybody else was. So you can't fault him for his perspectives. He's well researched, he's well read, he knows what he's talking about. It's possible that he's wrong about the time.
00:20:20.274 - 00:20:27.586, Speaker D: And it's also possible that to Vance's point, it goes in that direction. It just doesn't hit a million dollars in 88 more days.
00:20:27.688 - 00:20:44.854, Speaker B: Yeah, we need to get moving if it's going to get there. So let's all buy our bitcoin today. Do your duty. Yeah. My first instinct is not to fade Bellagi. He doesn't put out too many predictions. He'll put out like weird science stuff and Seafaring and the network state and all that jazz.
00:20:44.854 - 00:20:50.766, Speaker B: But if he's putting out hard numbers and he's betting real money on it, I'm kind of inclined to believe him.
00:20:50.788 - 00:21:44.362, Speaker C: Directionally, I have kind of complicated feelings in how I think about this. People writ largest society have systems for how to handle things, from game theory, from people just being something, being irresponsible in our group, psychology, whatever. Humanity has this thing where we get way out ahead of our skis, we create too much credit, we do all this stuff, and then there needs to be some kind of big reset. And there's probably all this game theory for why that happens, but that's what does happen. The way governments have historically handled that without defaulting, which causes an enormous amount of consternation and probably like deaths and stuff like that, because people are very serious about that kind of thing. They sought default. So what they do is they implement capital controls and they do financial hold, you know, yields, interest rates very low, they let inflation run hot, and there's this kind of uncomfortable but you do accomplish this thing called a reset.
00:21:44.362 - 00:22:06.226, Speaker C: I think what Belagi is keying in on is I'm not okay with that system. Like, I don't want to do that system anymore. You made decisions here at this period of time that I shouldn't necessarily be holding to and I'm ringing the fire alarm. I feel like that too. That's how I feel. I'm like in awe. I'm just shocked all the time by the generation that came before us.
00:22:06.226 - 00:22:29.290, Speaker C: Like, how the hell did you guys make this decision? This is completely irresponsible decision making that shouldn't be on us. But also then I kind of try to play out, well, what would happen if we all opted out of the system and the US was just bankrupt? And I try to imagine my life like, waking up in that world. I'm like, woof, that would suck. So I kind of have complicated emotions about this. I'm not really sure where I land.
00:22:29.360 - 00:23:02.786, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin is a tough one because it does have that doomer mentality where someone has to lose for you to succeed. Things like ETH feel a little bit less zero sum because it's like you're creating real on chain value that hopefully is benefiting more people than just yourself and nobody's losing on the other side of it. But I still can't find any real flaws in Bellagy's math like demographically. There's more old people, they're going to need more money to care for them in a medical sense, for the rest of their lives. There's less young people. We're kind of over the demographic hill. There's a lot of debt.
00:23:02.786 - 00:23:24.350, Speaker B: It needs to be refinanced. We're going to print more money. This is math you can do on a napkin that you really can't refute. It just depends on where we go from here. Are we going to be this indebted society, kind of like Japan, or is there a different path? Potentially. But the other path does mean a lot of pain for people who don't hold whatever the chosen assets might be. And there's no guarantee that it's Bitcoin.
00:23:24.350 - 00:23:34.362, Speaker B: It could be things like gold, could be things that are commodities or real estate, but it doesn't look really good in any sense for people who don't hold those types of assets.
00:23:34.506 - 00:24:41.480, Speaker D: So one of the most fundamental books that frankly, I've ever read, but I think it's also a key point to Bellagy's entire argument is The Changing World Order by Ray Dalio. And it came out maybe like two, maybe three years ago. It basically talks about the long term debt cycles in relation to the short term debt cycles. And the long term debt cycles essentially are such that there is 100 to 150 year process that happens where there's a new country and that country becomes the reserve world currency, and then it becomes the massive financial center of the world. It gets to be so large, it becomes overbearing with debt and that eventually they lose reserve currency status and a new country steps up and takes over reserve currency status. Part of what Balogy is saying is Bitcoin is one of the paths that we could have going forward. He's also acknowledging that, frankly, RMB is going to be one of the other paths that we could have going forward, where China is now the new reserve currency of the world, where it becomes the new hegemon, whereas the United States basically becomes the same thing as the UK and the same thing as the Netherlands before.
00:24:41.480 - 00:25:03.386, Speaker D: Like there are these processes in history, it is just math on a napkin, but it's also historical context that you can apply to this that has happened three times previously. And it feels like, and all the information in Ray Dalio's book is also true, that we're in the middle of that process of transitioning global reserve currency status to a new country or a new asset.
00:25:03.498 - 00:25:09.150, Speaker B: I'd rather be Bitcoin than Chinese, 100%, there's no question.
00:25:09.220 - 00:25:22.370, Speaker D: I'm just saying that there is also another path that is in the same logic thread that isn't Bitcoin going to a million, or isn't this network state that we're talking about, it's another country taking up the reins from what we've had over the last hundred years.
00:25:22.440 - 00:25:57.402, Speaker B: The only reason I disagree with that is relative to most other countries, the US is in a better debt position. And so all of the emerging markets and even places like China have a lot more debt. But also demographically, we look a lot better than other countries as well. Look at a country like Japan, look at a country like China, or like they're further over the hill. And so there's not a clear like, okay, this is the country, or this is the type of currency that we might want. There's just no good options if you're looking at on a very long time scale.
00:25:57.546 - 00:26:24.674, Speaker D: So I completely agree with that perspective. Just to play devil's advocate, going into the process that made us the global reserve currency of the world, which was World War II, we also looked like that. We also looked like we were a smaller growth country. We were not in the top ten in terms of GDP or in terms of economic or militaristic power. And there was a catalyst that changed all of that in favor of the United States. It is possible that this all can change very rapidly.
00:26:24.722 - 00:26:54.000, Speaker B: Two ocean superpower demographically in a much earlier state. At that point, the World War definitely catalyzed it, but the US was always going to be the most powerful country on Earth just because of its geography. And if anyone wants to read a book on this, it's called Ten Maps That Change the World. It's really interesting. It's just a book about geography that tells the history of why certain nations are powerful, why certain nations aren't. For instance, Russia doesn't have a warm water port. That's been their challenge throughout their entire history.
00:26:54.000 - 00:27:03.202, Speaker B: It's funny. It's in a wave of a lot of technology. A lot of times it just does boil down to rocks and dirt. Know where you are and stuff like that.
00:27:03.256 - 00:27:13.894, Speaker D: To be clear, I completely support this as well. Also, another book, Peter Zahan Accidental Superpower. It's the exact same logic. As long as you're connected to oceans, you're fine.
00:27:14.012 - 00:27:25.878, Speaker B: Canada somehow didn't make that work. It really is mind blowing that the guys with all the rocks and dirt and trees had the most inflation when Bush came to shove.
00:27:26.054 - 00:27:26.918, Speaker A: And oil.
00:27:27.014 - 00:27:27.798, Speaker D: And oil.
00:27:27.894 - 00:27:31.978, Speaker B: I know I love Canada, but fuck, it's just such a brutal place.
00:27:32.144 - 00:28:05.106, Speaker C: They're chilled out people. I agree with parts of what both of you are. Me, I'm not sure if I've ever articulated this to you, but my concern actually in this I see a lot of stuff through the lens of this great power competition with China. But what I think is the most likely outcome is I think the US is even though there's this perception out there that, oh, the China's playing the long game and we're just bungling and can't walk over 2ft in the United States, I don't think that's the case. I think we're actually far. More competent than most people think. Like we're still the superpower.
00:28:05.106 - 00:28:49.470, Speaker C: But I think what's going to happen usually to Dalio's point, the thing that accompanies these deleveragings that he's talking about is external conflict because people internally start looking for someone to blame. You already see that we're going to ban know there was the Chips Act, so all of know rising hostility. They're gonna look for a bad guy in the form of China. I think if it comes to some sort of power competition, the US will win, but they're going to erode freedoms along the way. Do you see what I'm saying? Like, they already want to track every transaction over $600. You know, the old politicians thing, never let a good crisis go to waste. I'm sure that there are people who've been around the block and think like this oh, great, power competition.
00:28:49.470 - 00:28:58.086, Speaker C: Everyone thinks China is a threat. They're not a threat, we're going to be fine. But to beat China, we need every transaction over $5 to be directly emailed to Janet Yellen.
00:28:58.118 - 00:28:59.642, Speaker A: I'm like kind of making hyperbole here.
00:28:59.696 - 00:29:10.810, Speaker C: But do you see what I'm concerned? That's my concern.
00:29:11.250 - 00:29:20.880, Speaker B: Temporary programs become permanent. The permanent programs get more restrictive. Get your COVID booster every year. Get it twice a year. No thanks.
00:29:24.130 - 00:30:17.410, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, listen, this is the entire argument that Balaji presents, which is basically we're on this path. And there is the path from a more economic geopolitical perspective which know China or Russia or whomever is going to be the next global hegemon. I agree there is another path, which is the network state, which is what he talks about, which is what he promotes, which is we are not going to actually lose. I mean, look at Russia and think about the superpower militaristic power that they supposedly had. But they've been at war with Ukraine for a year now and it's still not clear who is absolutely winning that conflict. And just think about that in relation to the military of the United States. And there's no question that we are not going to be fine, that we are going to be fine if we were ever to get into a skirmish with anybody.
00:30:17.410 - 00:30:34.194, Speaker D: But I think your point is exactly right, which is the network state actually is the bigger threat. What's happening domestically and what we can do and what we're losing domestically is going to be the bigger problem. It's just going to happen like a toad in slow boiling water. You're not going to know it's boiling until it's too late.
00:30:34.322 - 00:30:59.520, Speaker B: I do think all of our politicians are so old and people say that that's really terrible. They are old for sure, but that is both a feature and a bug. Like they are going to either age out of their posts gracefully or not gracefully, but that's coming. DeSantis is 44. The next people up are young. There's a Gen Z congressman in there. It's happening.
00:30:59.520 - 00:31:25.400, Speaker B: We're slowly taking over. And the biggest issue is that none of these people realize how impactful technology is. I don't know if you guys watch the TikTok questioning, but there weren't that many questions. It was just them saying things at the guy and him getting kind of flustered and them not really knowing how it worked. It was just really embarrassing. Those hearings in ten years will look a lot better for whatever tech company or protocol is being questioned. And I think that's ultimately what you're playing for.
00:31:25.400 - 00:31:46.478, Speaker B: Like Diane Feinstein, Michael and I's, local congresswoman. How long has she been in Congress? 30 years. 40, like so old. But she's not running for reelection next year. Had a great career, great life. Hats off to you. But whoever's next needs to understand this at a little bit more of a.
00:31:46.484 - 00:31:55.906, Speaker D: Deeper level than she's not the it's not the same district, but look at one of the, you know, someone who actually understands it goes on.
00:31:55.928 - 00:31:56.066, Speaker B: Meet.
00:31:56.088 - 00:32:02.082, Speaker D: The press calls for the bailout of Silicon Valley bank. Probably initiates, like, that type of energy.
00:32:02.136 - 00:32:04.580, Speaker B: That type of Roe was there for.
00:32:05.910 - 00:32:53.090, Speaker D: But, you know, that was the catalyst on Saturday, or maybe it was even Sunday that started the process, or at least furthered the process, to be able to get that solution solved very rapidly. There's a famous line in science that is progress happens one funeral at a time. And I think that there is obviously not calling for anybody to pass away. But at the same time, there is a changing of the guard. That's going to have to happen in the next decade where we're going to have the first generation of more than not a congressperson or a senator will have been grown up in an age where the Internet existed. Think about that. Every single person who is in Congress right now, basically the vast majority of them saw the Internet go from zero to something.
00:32:53.090 - 00:33:21.710, Speaker D: But imagine having the majority of the people who are the elected officials of our country be in place of power where they just have known about technology from the start. And I feel like there is a huge difference for people who just have known about it from the start and have grown up with it, have seen it. And that's been just something as commonplace as electricity or water. You just understand technology at a much better, deeper level. And we're going to see that happen in the next decade because that aging up is happening.
00:33:21.860 - 00:33:23.822, Speaker B: Imagine when that's regulators too.
00:33:23.956 - 00:33:36.770, Speaker C: You know what I also think is it's been instructive and kind of eye opening and kind of scary that no one at banks considered the impact that mobile banking would have on bank runs.
00:33:37.910 - 00:33:39.902, Speaker B: This is so bad and so embarrassing.
00:33:39.966 - 00:33:41.874, Speaker C: Nobody's happening faster than before.
00:33:41.992 - 00:33:43.410, Speaker B: Yeah. What?
00:33:43.560 - 00:33:44.450, Speaker D: Of course.
00:33:44.600 - 00:34:15.406, Speaker C: Yeah. That was a real eye opener to me. And you know what it made me think of is this whole phase that we're talking about where there's financial oppression and yield curve control and stuff like that that's never been tried in an era of Twitter 24/7 pundits. These people, I just don't think they understand the blowback that they'll get. Also, the whole system is global. It's so much more global now. You can't just ring fence the United States like you were able to do.
00:34:15.508 - 00:34:16.400, Speaker D: I think.
00:34:18.610 - 00:34:22.218, Speaker C: It'S going to go poorly. I think they're going to try it, and I think it's going to go poorly.
00:34:22.314 - 00:34:44.326, Speaker B: And more people are learning about this stuff too. All the macro pods you guys have are probably blowing up just because it's like people are starting to learn about this stuff, and they probably never understood it before. Even myself, I didn't really know what a bond was or what a yield curve was. And I studied business in college until 2015, like a couple of years after.
00:34:44.348 - 00:34:50.430, Speaker C: I graduated, until three months ago. Framework I'll pay, you listening.
00:34:50.610 - 00:34:55.578, Speaker B: And like, 90% of people, if you ask them, they would have no idea how how that works.
00:34:55.744 - 00:34:56.938, Speaker C: I'm with you.
00:34:57.104 - 00:35:15.326, Speaker B: Ask them how a two year bond works mechanically. Like, when do you get the money? When do you put the money up? When do you get things back? They're not going to know. But now they will. And increasingly these things of like, OOH, it's the Btfp, it's the QE, it's the know, three letter acronym, people are just going to see through that stuff.
00:35:15.428 - 00:35:41.450, Speaker D: I'm going to be the Senate here and say that people will still not understand it. And that's the big problem. More will. I totally agree with that. More will. Enough will. The market is growing, but unless it is something that becomes so cataclysmic that it faces every single United States person, every single person under the sun, it's really just not going to be something that people pay attention to.
00:35:41.600 - 00:35:43.206, Speaker B: Kind of like every regional bank blowing.
00:35:43.238 - 00:36:00.910, Speaker D: Up at this very moment. We don't have that. But it could happen. I'm not saying we're going to head into the cataclysm, as I'm saying, but if that happens, I think a lot more people will know. But definitely more people know more now than twelve months ago.
00:36:01.060 - 00:36:37.500, Speaker C: People also have a sense of things being unfair, even if they don't quite exactly know the mechanics and how all of it works. I've actually kind of noticed this about finance in general, too. Finance is complicated, right? It's like complicated how all the mechanics of everything works. Exactly. And oftentimes I do think people like, people say Citadel securities is front running and Citadel is like, no we're not, blah blah blah, because of some technical reason for why they're not exactly doing it. But you printed $20 billion last year, friends. Yeah, you probably are in some indirect way.
00:36:37.500 - 00:37:10.950, Speaker C: And they get to say, no we're not, and you don't know what you're talking about. But I think people generally, over a long enough time have a sense if things are working properly or working for them or if things are fair and if they're not, and even if people can't pinpoint it, I think they generally have a sense that something's not going particularly well. That's actually a little dangerous, too, when that happens, because then people are just mad. The motions are flying. And I found it harder to talk with people about this stuff sometimes. Stuff that would just be a discussion. Emotions get fault much sooner than they.
00:37:11.020 - 00:37:30.540, Speaker B: We are force beating people. Financial literacy, like inflation, okay. You got to figure out exactly how much your money is worth, okay? All this bank stuff. You got to figure out where exactly your money is hanging out. I can't even remember, but when I graduated from college, I don't think I thought about any of this.
00:37:33.570 - 00:37:36.174, Speaker C: Major classics major.
00:37:36.372 - 00:37:39.150, Speaker B: But now they're talking about translating Greek.
00:37:40.050 - 00:37:40.462, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:40.516 - 00:37:59.590, Speaker D: We also graduated college into a decade of nothing but up into the right. Zero interest rate policy. Nothing but up into the right. Put your money in the S and P 500, it'll grow 7% to 10% a year, maybe 20. Tech is going to continue to grow. Growth is taking over. There's no such thing as value investing.
00:37:59.590 - 00:38:12.700, Speaker D: We literally graduated at a decade of the exact same thing happening every single year after year. And this is the first change agent that we've had post graduation in the last 13 years.
00:38:13.070 - 00:38:34.382, Speaker B: It kind of feels like that's what Belagi is trying to do, is just take that to the next level of, like, okay, these localized problems of inflation and your banks being insolvent, like, zoom out. What if this really starts to domino? I kind of don't like the doom and gloom stuff he does, but I understand the point, and if he's putting real money behind it, here's my support.
00:38:34.436 - 00:39:01.610, Speaker C: It's going to be a weird decade. But you know what else? The other thing that I've because to your point, we have a bunch of macro podcasts who do stuff that's like, way more in the weeds. A great way to feel kind of existentially nervous is to focus in on this stuff. A great way to feel very sure and happy is to talk to people who are deep in the weeds of building something because they're so unaware of what's going on. And I think it's the way to live. Personally, I get interested in this stuff. I pay a lot of attention to it.
00:39:01.610 - 00:39:06.810, Speaker C: But talking to developers makes me happy, to be honest with you.
00:39:06.880 - 00:39:16.254, Speaker D: It depends on what you're building or developing, because when your job is also to pay attention to what's going on and decide what you're building is the right thing for what's going on.
00:39:16.372 - 00:39:23.520, Speaker B: I never wanted to learn any of this stuff. I'm going to be honest. I had no interest.
00:39:24.050 - 00:39:54.780, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm interested in it from a purely in a very important sense is how things work honestly, Michael, you said people don't want to know. I've heard people talk about this. I'll be honest, because we're admitting that we didn't know what bonds were on this podcast. I didn't realize that we had a central bank. When I was getting into crypto, I was like, oh, a central bank. Okay, what is this thing? And now everyone in America knows who Jerome Powell is. They know him by name.
00:39:57.870 - 00:40:01.790, Speaker D: This is a safe space. It's in the tone of silence. Anything else you want to admit?
00:40:02.290 - 00:40:04.830, Speaker C: No? That's good. Jerome Powell.
00:40:07.250 - 00:40:08.746, Speaker B: He's going viral.
00:40:08.938 - 00:40:15.380, Speaker C: He's going viral. Yeah. You know what blows my mind is that that guy wants to be in that position.
00:40:16.870 - 00:40:25.026, Speaker B: It was a pretty cushy job until recently. Lots of people would tell you how smart you were until things really I.
00:40:25.048 - 00:40:31.286, Speaker D: Was going to say there was like a three month period of time where he know? Ripped by trump but other than that, it's been pretty nice.
00:40:31.388 - 00:40:38.402, Speaker B: Dude, he's just out of the frying pan into the fire, just getting jabbed by Trump on Twitter straight.
00:40:38.466 - 00:40:45.610, Speaker D: I was going to say, I don't know if he wants this job. Ever since whatever FOMC meeting, it was where he was literally shaking at the podium.
00:40:46.670 - 00:41:07.810, Speaker C: I thought he was shaking a little bit. This paper, someone definitely told him, like, Jerome, Jerry, make sure you put that paper on that pedestal. Do not hold that paper. I saw like, he was almost done. He picked it back up and his hands were stuttering. I was like I felt bad for the guy. Didn't make me feel confident, though.
00:41:07.880 - 00:41:26.966, Speaker B: The whole gang has had a good run. Yellen. Brian dees powell. There has to be we haven't even gotten to the part where we've started assigning blame, and that is the most important question. Especially politically. I don't know how they survive this. I don't think they will.
00:41:27.068 - 00:41:50.158, Speaker D: Do you want to know the thing that I think has also flown under the radar? Maybe it hasn't. I just haven't been paying attention. The thing that got dead and killed the most in the last twelve months. Modern monetary theory. Everyone who was talking about how inflation isn't ever going to come into play. We can literally print money forever. Let's just blow more money on the problem.
00:41:50.158 - 00:41:56.250, Speaker D: It's going to be fine. Every single one of those theorists, it doesn't feel good to be you right now.
00:41:56.340 - 00:41:59.602, Speaker B: They were on a sick one for like, ten years, and then it didn't work.
00:41:59.656 - 00:42:10.162, Speaker D: I mean, that's literally how crazy it got. That's how crazy the last decade got, where we were just like, throw out every theory we have about money. We can print it into Bazillion.
00:42:10.306 - 00:42:12.920, Speaker B: I guarantee you that comes back, though.
00:42:14.010 - 00:42:16.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know if that specific.
00:42:16.972 - 00:42:23.466, Speaker D: Idea does, but I think a lot of exactly, dude, you know what is.
00:42:23.488 - 00:42:50.130, Speaker C: So crazy about this stuff is that it's so apparent in history. It's not even hidden, like oh, I'm like some scholar, and I look at this stuff. Inflation, price caps, like, naturalization of all of this stuff has happened many times throughout history, and it's just funny that the same solutions are provided and they do not work. But people that's my frustration with Liz Warren. I'm like, you are a smart.
00:42:51.830 - 00:42:52.530, Speaker B: Is.
00:42:52.680 - 00:43:02.374, Speaker C: Yeah, well, she's a smart person. She's a smart person. She's a savvy politician. I think it's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. She is. Go look at her early stuff. I'm from Massachusetts, actually.
00:43:02.412 - 00:43:03.974, Speaker B: You're a fan of her early work?
00:43:04.172 - 00:43:47.140, Speaker C: Yeah, fan of the early years. I like the old Warren. It's not going to do it, but yeah, no, she's a smart person. The problem is you have all these politicians saying stuff they don't believe. I'm recording this podcast with a guy who's ex FDIC, ex Federal Reserve on Friday, and I was talking to him about some of this stuff, and I think we would all be pretty disgusted if we actually knew how it really went down in Washington. It's the kind of stuff, you know, you're like, I'm sure it would be bad, but then you dig in and it's probably so much worse than you even imagined it would possibly be.
00:43:47.510 - 00:44:12.378, Speaker D: House of Cards was a documentary. I've got a friend in a group chat, and it's kind of like a political chat, or it's turned into one, at least over the last couple of years. And he was, like, one of the few people who was like, I'm on Liz Warren's side. I'm absolutely supportive of her. Every, like, two to three months, he texted me, and it was like, I can't believe how wrong I was. I was so wrong.
00:44:12.464 - 00:44:28.946, Speaker C: You know what? Robin Williams said this as a joke years ago, but I think they should actually do this. Politicians should have to disclose who their biggest donors are. They should just have to wear it on their clothes, like, when they're talking. It would solve so many problems. Do they do that?
00:44:29.128 - 00:44:36.722, Speaker B: They do. You can go and see anybody who donates, who they donated to and all that.
00:44:36.776 - 00:44:38.450, Speaker C: Like the super PACs and stuff.
00:44:38.520 - 00:44:46.130, Speaker B: Those are all dark. You can't tell a well, you can't tell who's donated to them, but you can't tell what they did with the money, which candidates they supported.
00:44:46.210 - 00:45:01.646, Speaker D: It would just super below the fold. You can't tell it is cloak and dagger at best. Yeah, a forensic accountant could put it together and be like, okay, this money ties to there, and, okay, there we go. But no, it's not an example of.
00:45:01.668 - 00:45:32.086, Speaker B: This I saw today. So the TikTok hearing was today, and Jamal Bowman, the congressman from New York, held a protest outside of Capitol Hill, not against TikTok, for TikTok. And he had, like, 20 creators with him. And it was like this, like, we need to keep TikTok in America. TikTok is good for small businesses. Just makes you think, Why are you saying these things? Is there something we need to know about? Because I didn't realize Jamal was such.
00:45:32.108 - 00:46:05.434, Speaker C: A big you know, he's doing his little dances. He's going like that, like Jamal. I agree. I agree with, um let's talk about a little bit of crypto stuff. Yeah, like, all right, let's talk about the Wells notice that got served to Coinbase, because that's a big one. So SEC served Coinbase a Wells notice Wednesday afternoon over concerns about alleged securities violations. The Wells notice, which precedes an enforcement action, states that the SEC will be targeting Coinbase's spot market, staking service, coinbase prime and wallet.
00:46:05.434 - 00:46:12.178, Speaker C: So, man, that is basically everything. And there was Paul Gruall. Yeah, that's everything.
00:46:12.264 - 00:46:12.850, Speaker A: That's everything.
00:46:12.920 - 00:46:45.422, Speaker C: And Paul Gruall, who's the chief legal officer at Coinbase, he dropped a blog. And he kind of highlighted two years ago, he kind of dropped, like, a history from the Coinbase perspective, obviously, of what happened. But two years ago, the SEC reviewed Coinbase in detail. They approved Coinbase to go public. And clearly, like, the S One explained their asset listing process and included 57 different references to Staking. Again, this is all from Paul's blog. I'm kind of summarizing here, but over the past nine months, coinbase has met with the SEC more than 30 times.
00:46:45.422 - 00:47:22.998, Speaker C: They shared details of their business, building a path towards registration, blah, blah, blah. They said the SEC never gave them any feedback. Last July, Coinbase filed a petition with SEC calling for more regulatory clarity. Still no response. They've spent millions of dollars in manpower trying to draft a registration proposal. Basically, his perspective is that Coinbase has done everything that they can, even gone above and beyond to try to act in a responsible way and register with the SEC. And his point was that this just didn't feel like due process or that this was just but I'd be curious to get both your perspectives.
00:47:23.174 - 00:47:53.954, Speaker B: I think all this stuff eventually needs to end up in the courts. The courts are like the most American, most know thing that we have, and it doesn't exist in every country. And we're very lucky that it's not just like, Gary Gensler calling the shots. And that's how it is. The Grayscale hearing was a disaster for them. It looks like a couple of the other cases are going to be harder fought or harder to win than they might have otherwise anticipated. And so you've got Coinbase going up against and they're the most resource company in the US.
00:47:53.954 - 00:48:42.270, Speaker B: Going up against the SEC for something that appears to be related to Staking. I would guess it's ETH. And so in the process, you're likely going to have to prove that ETH is a security, which there's just not a great fact pattern there either. I think this is scary for Coinbase in the sense that the downside is real, but I would give them pretty good chances in a court of law and we have a general counsel and most things he's like, oh fuck, this is not good, or whatever. He's like, this is actually pretty interesting. This could go Coinbase's way and that's kind of what the rest of crypto twitter lawyer section lawyer division has also said. People are excited to see this in court because it feels like at last we're going to have a fair shake.
00:48:42.350 - 00:49:11.866, Speaker D: Yeah. Only thing I'd add there is Coinbase is probably the most litigious company representing the industry. We know exactly where this is going. I kind of view this as the situation when in an old western town it's like, all right, I'll meet you at noon in the town square. Guns blaring. But SEC knows exactly what they're doing with Coinbase. This is like the big kahuna that they've all been waiting for.
00:49:11.866 - 00:50:07.950, Speaker D: Everybody knows exactly what's going to happen, which is frankly like this is going to go to court and it's going to take years, it will literally take years to be able to process this. Look at Ripple, that was what, 2019 and we're still talking about it. It still hasn't been settled and this I think will probably be even more so. But the fact of the matter is the fact pattern is really positive for Coinbase. This was a business model which obviously talks about staking in the S, one that was approved by the previous iteration of the SEC and for whatever reason this SEC decided that it was not the business that they should still be in. So it does kind of know. Are we talking about not just the politicalization of all of the previous stuff that we're talking about macro wise, but are we also talking about the politicization of regulatory bodies and that becomes a big problem.
00:50:07.950 - 00:50:11.898, Speaker D: But to Vance's point, the courts are not politicized.
00:50:11.994 - 00:50:56.718, Speaker B: I like their odds I think is overall the point and the more that regulators push on things like this, it's hard for Republicans to get super behind crypto from first principles as a know statement of the congress and Senators. But Republicans love what Democrats hate and Republicans love pushing back on government overreach and you don't need to be for or against crypto to know that that is what's happening. You know, you're just kind of building up this bucket of goodwill with one party as they see this government overreach happen, especially on the regulatory side. So if things ever change from a congressional or Senate split or the presidency probably looks a lot different in terms of what the regulatory landscape does as well.
00:50:56.884 - 00:51:23.906, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a bummer because I don't feel like it was destined to need to happen like this but it is becoming just a completely partisan issue. Crypto and you saw DeSantis came out and said we're not going to have a CBDC in know that's probably some bit of political posturing. He's done stuff like this in the past. Like he sent up, you know, the, you know, immigrants to Mars.
00:51:23.938 - 00:51:27.206, Speaker B: No, those are not the same thing. Those are not the same you know.
00:51:27.228 - 00:51:33.926, Speaker A: These people are all you know what they're doing. I didn't understand this until I started doing like media and tweeting and stuff. They're like, you know, when you have.
00:51:33.948 - 00:51:35.046, Speaker C: Got a fire tweet, you're like, this.
00:51:35.068 - 00:51:56.042, Speaker A: Shit'S going to rip. This is going to be a ripper. That's what they do. They're like, oh yeah, I'm going to bust these people up to Massachusetts, hit him in Martha's Vineyard. That's the game. That's the game that's being played and whatever, I respect the game, but I think that's what he's doing, too. But if that gets the thing done, I guess it gets the thing done because I think a CBDC would be disastrous.
00:51:56.042 - 00:51:57.342, Speaker A: I think it would be horrible.
00:51:57.486 - 00:52:41.370, Speaker B: We're getting presidential candidates to stake out positions on like that's what's happening here. And it's not because DeSantis loves crypto. It's because he hates big government and he hates what the Democrats are doing and he hates the CBD study that's going on right now. So it's kind of like the enemy of your enemy is your friend a little bit. And I think that's how I would categorize the Republicans right now. But then you have like and very important ones, patrick McHenry, Tom Emmer that are in leadership positions in the House that are very pro crypto because they know what it is. And so over time, you hope that core grows to the rest of the Republicans at least, and Rokana and all the Democrats.
00:52:41.370 - 00:52:44.480, Speaker B: I feel like they know what crypto is. I don't know about you, Michael, but.
00:52:45.330 - 00:53:38.178, Speaker D: I feel like they're pretty reasonable, 100%, I was going to say, I don't think that this is necessarily crypto is not a partisan issue as much as it is an age issue. And I think that if anybody came into congressional or senatorial seat in the last five years, three years, maybe they know what it is, they understand the power of it, but also they understand that the number two thing that everybody has in the Robin Hood account behind an S and P 500 index is some form of crypto. If you are under the age of 35, if you're over the age of 35, it's literally the opposite. And I think everybody, at least at some point, is the bid is going to flip as people start to realize where the younger generation is actually trending. The problem is we just don't have a mass or we don't have representation in our government at the moment.
00:53:38.264 - 00:53:41.550, Speaker A: Also, the youngs don't vote. We're not good voters.
00:53:41.710 - 00:53:56.262, Speaker B: We're going to have to change that. Things are going to get so bad if the worst plays out here that it's really going to be a call to mobilize because I don't know if yeah, it's just going to be tough if we have another four years of.
00:53:56.316 - 00:54:09.180, Speaker A: Bank failures and inflation, poor decision making, weak leadership. It's weak leadership. But let's talk about a little bit about the Arbitrum AirDrop because I'll be honest, I don't have much of a take here.
00:54:09.550 - 00:54:10.970, Speaker D: I was going to say a drop.
00:54:11.570 - 00:54:30.530, Speaker B: They did it. Congrats dropped. Yeah, everyone saw phenomenal. It's trading at 1.38, which is $13.14 billion. And we're back launching eleven figure FTV tokens like the bull market never ended.
00:54:32.470 - 00:54:37.960, Speaker D: Wait, what's the fully diluted versus the market cap or what's the percent trading right now?
00:54:38.330 - 00:54:57.578, Speaker B: So they did 11% AirDrop, so they got about one and a half billion out, but they're fully diluted is eleven and a half. Yes, math checks out many such cases, but time is can I get you.
00:54:57.584 - 00:55:23.010, Speaker A: Guys to speculate on something? Actually, I just have a question about this. So let's say to oversimplify here, what ends up happening on Ethereum is you got Ethereum main net, you got generalized layer twos and then you've got kind of app specific blocks like roll apps, whatever the word that you want to use is between those three. How do you think the value distributes.
00:55:23.510 - 00:56:13.540, Speaker B: ETH is going after a market of being both technology and money? And the key thing is, number one, what is the business of L One? The business of L One are like the central banks of DFI, Maker, Ave and all the best NFTs and basically like the main stage for finance when the really big battles play out, like UST getting liquidated or blockfly or Genesis going under all that stuff. Clears on Chain on Ethereum l One. So they have sticky demand. It's not going anywhere. The question is also not just, okay, is there one L2? Is there two? L two. Are there 1000? Are there 3000? Because then it's like, okay, even if they cannibalize your fees, you're going to have enough call data booting put on chain where that's generating a lot of additional fees. And honestly, I view the L two S as technology.
00:56:13.540 - 00:56:52.558, Speaker B: They're not going after the market of being the next reserve currency of the planet. So you have to discount them. You can't give them that high of a multiple and you need to value them based on fees. And most things are valued at the biggest tech companies in the world and some of the fastest growing are ten to twelve to 15 x next twelve month revenue. And that's being very generous. We're probably looking at like a few thousand x in some of these L2 S and some of these L ones. So am I bullish on an eleven figure coin? That's always going to be a challenge no matter what it is, but at that point you better be producing real fees for me to be excited about it.
00:56:52.644 - 00:57:45.742, Speaker D: The way I think about it is it's sort of like the dichotomy between AWS versus maybe Facebook or Snapchat as an application that was built on top. Of that infrastructure where you can have and to be clear, there's a professional class of investors that invest in Snapchats and Facebook's and applications. And that's basically the venture capital thesis right there. There's also a class of investors who buy AWS stock, Amazon stock in 2006 because they understand that it's going to become the platform, but it's not necessarily something that you can invest in from a venture scale outcome, which is like 1000 X. I think you've got just a risk reward difference. That being said, I do think that it really does, to Vance's point, depend on what the value crew model is. If you're talking about the promise of future platform level participation and therefore revenue and cash flows, that's great.
00:57:45.742 - 00:58:18.646, Speaker D: But you have to prove that, especially under the guise, under the backdrop of ETH being able to generate that, and some applications on top of ETH being able to generate that. It really does come down to what are the metrics, what are the value accrual models, but I kind of think about it as like, platform versus application. And you might have apps that are super valuable, but the definition of a platform at least is the economic value that's created on top of the platform is greater than the platform itself. It's that dichotomy.
00:58:18.758 - 00:58:23.680, Speaker A: It's a tough one. I was just curious to see what you guys thought because I was kind of thinking about it myself.
00:58:24.050 - 00:58:53.510, Speaker B: Keep in mind, none of crypto trades or very little of crypto trades on fundamentals. You're seeing like, glimmers of hope in that direction right now. But I can't explain to you why Ripple was worth 15 billion at the bottom when everyone was getting liquidated and things were terrible. I don't have a logical explanation for that. And so sometimes you just have to suspend disbelief. If you're really going to get into crypto, it would be hard to get in with a very skeptical lens.
00:58:54.010 - 00:58:55.494, Speaker C: I agree with that.
00:58:55.692 - 00:59:20.426, Speaker D: We were talking to this partner of ours who's also an investor, and he recently was like, I'm convinced there's a formula to be able to predict how something will become valuable. You don't even want to go there. It's not going to work. But people are like, Why? This doesn't make any sense. Ultimately it comes down to animal spirits and fundamentals.
00:59:20.538 - 00:59:25.410, Speaker B: That's it over time, hopefully more of the latter than the former.
00:59:25.750 - 00:59:27.220, Speaker A: Yes, I think it will.
00:59:28.150 - 00:59:40.754, Speaker B: No one can explain why Tesla trades where it is. Like, I do understand we need to be rational here, but within the context of the environment that we're operating in, it's tough.
00:59:40.882 - 01:00:13.280, Speaker A: I mean, isn't the theoretical rationale for what an equity is valued as the discounted sum of all its future cash flows? The important part there being the future, like, people's ideas and their expectations about where a company is going to go changes quite a bit. So I don't know if the last 20, maybe this is just me being a millennial, and my experience with investing has been crazy, manipulated, up, only insanity. I'm sure it probably isn't always like that, but for my entire, like, it wasn't always mentioned to markets. Yeah.
01:00:14.470 - 01:00:54.320, Speaker D: So security analysis by Benjamin Graham was written in 1936. Twitter did not exist in 1936. There is this element that we've kind of been talking about, which is like, is it worth revisiting all of the models, all the mental models, all the formulas that we have for politics, finance, just general perspectives on things for this new normal. And I think that the smartest people, the earliest adopters are actually moving in that direction. But it does kind of beg the question of, like, it's not a total ripping and replacing, but do we need to adjust or do we need to add to our perspectives or our formulas to be able to actually get to what the new normal is?
01:00:55.410 - 01:01:37.690, Speaker A: Yeah, there was some I had a friend of mine, we were talking about this when COVID was happening, and it was that crazy markets mania. Sometime in 2021, we were looking at the company Snowflake. Snowflake. And we basically did this back of the napkin math where it was like, in order for that price to be rational, the wildest expectation was, I forget, $100 billion of revenue and x percent profit margins. And there are companies that are already there that were trading at like, one 10th the value. So you got to kind of look at that and just say, people aren't as rational as everyone would like to believe.
01:01:37.760 - 01:02:00.900, Speaker B: I don't think in terms of pricing, even like, the not going to name any names of their investors, but the Silicon Valley set, especially like the growth investing set, really, if you ask them about Snowflake, they'd be like, oh my God, this is going to change the planet. It's not just about the next two years, it's about the next 200 years. It's like, okay, does that even make sense?
01:02:01.830 - 01:02:09.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not invested on a 200 diaper amir palace. That's insane to me.
01:02:09.096 - 01:02:24.726, Speaker B: And then you look at CNBC, and I turned it on the other day and they were doing a segment called Grade the Trade, and they would all throw out, like, ridiculous trades and they would grade each other. Oh, you get a C. Or like, that's an A plus trade. We're all doomed if that is what's.
01:02:24.758 - 01:02:25.900, Speaker C: Going to happen here.
01:02:27.710 - 01:02:34.094, Speaker A: To be honest. That's hilarious. Content people give CNBC a tough time. Whatever, man.
01:02:34.212 - 01:02:40.346, Speaker B: It's 245 in the afternoon. You're having, like, a yogurt. You put CNBC on, it's just an absolute circus.
01:02:40.458 - 01:02:42.174, Speaker A: Yeah, you're having a yogurt, as one.
01:02:42.212 - 01:02:50.990, Speaker B: Does at 245 is what it is, I guess. But I wouldn't call them any smarter than your average retail investor.
01:02:51.150 - 01:02:56.434, Speaker D: If markets were efficient, we wouldn't have jobs. Yeah, I thought about that.
01:02:56.552 - 01:03:10.454, Speaker B: That was a deep thought I had the other day. It's like, is Chat GBT eventually just going to be able to ingest everything and spit out trades, probably. But they will probably be very similar to everyone else's trades because that's like the biggest trading data that it has.
01:03:10.492 - 01:03:11.080, Speaker C: Right?
01:03:11.450 - 01:03:37.426, Speaker A: Let me ask you guys a question. This is probably a stupid question, but if there might be a business or something like transforming data in such a way that it could get processed by Chat GBT or whatever AGI is behind it? Because I was actually thinking, what if you could feed all of the transaction, like a blockchain's entire transaction, log entire history into a blockchain into Chat GBT and just ask it questions and all.
01:03:37.448 - 01:03:38.962, Speaker B: The centralized order book data?
01:03:39.096 - 01:03:42.850, Speaker A: Yeah, it could probably come up with some wild insights.
01:03:45.190 - 01:04:01.642, Speaker D: We actually have a couple of at least one portfolio company who as one of the proof points of their product, they're going to have Chat GPT. But for Dune Analytics, you ask a question and it'll tell you the answer.
01:04:01.776 - 01:04:02.570, Speaker C: Dude.
01:04:05.150 - 01:04:10.470, Speaker A: This has been pointed out. But it is funny that everyone's like, yeah, the blue collar workers, they're going to get screwed. And actually it's probably the white collar.
01:04:10.550 - 01:04:38.520, Speaker B: Oh my God, that was so funny. First of all, the thing that everyone always said with AI is like, don't worry, the business people will go first, but we're going to protect the artists and we're going to protect the people who really you can't replicate the passion of these people. And then the first thing we did was create a way to create any image and disrupt every artist and never pay them any more money. It's just like, oh, we eliminated the artists first and all the white collar jobs are going to go last.
01:04:38.890 - 01:04:59.100, Speaker D: Literally. Last night we have GDC Game Developers conference here in San Francisco. And I was at one of our portfolio companies events, was having a conversation with a game company CEO who's like, yeah, we used to have eight people on the creative team. Now I have mid journey and it works just fine.
01:04:59.710 - 01:05:01.280, Speaker B: Life comes at you fast.
01:05:03.170 - 01:05:04.560, Speaker A: It does, man.
01:05:07.410 - 01:05:20.420, Speaker B: Real stuff. We're going to need to find places for all of these people because if we have all of the artists not getting paid, it's going to get so wild. People are going to be pissed. Yeah.
01:05:23.350 - 01:05:40.902, Speaker A: It'S a funny thing to be like, oh yeah, we solved. You guys don't need to work anymore. That should be this euphoric kind of. I read this book, I'm going to blank on the name. This was a shoot. I think it was like children's time or something like that. I cranked through it on audiobook.
01:05:40.902 - 01:06:05.634, Speaker A: But the premise of this book is Aliens Come. It was written in like, 1953. Arthur Clark is the name of the author. And the premise was aliens come down to Earth and they're benevolent and they solve all of Earth's problems. Just solve everything, like overnight. And it basically starts out from that kind of hypothetical and then branches out from there. I don't want to ruin the plot of the book, but it's extremely interesting.
01:06:05.634 - 01:06:36.394, Speaker A: And one of the things that this guy writes in 1953 is that with so many problems solved, content explodes. And people sit around consuming content all the time, to a point. And he actually says this where some people consume content for as much as 3 hours per day. 3 hours per day? Like, that was a mind blowing number that people wouldn't really believe written down in the book. And now it's like, I have five and a half hours of screen time on my phone. I would love to get it down to three.
01:06:36.592 - 01:06:38.650, Speaker D: You ever read Snow Crash?
01:06:39.230 - 01:06:40.560, Speaker A: I haven't, actually.
01:06:42.290 - 01:06:59.570, Speaker D: That's a good one. The premise is that the only job left after AI takes over is delivering pizza, and that is the one job that is left for humanity. We're laughing right now. But you were just talking about 3 hours of content per day.
01:06:59.720 - 01:07:01.620, Speaker A: No, I know.
01:07:02.070 - 01:07:13.560, Speaker B: It's worrisome shout out to anyway, it's going to be a wild decade. It just feels like it's going to be super volatile, and that's probably a good thing.
01:07:15.690 - 01:07:20.026, Speaker D: The crazy thing is it's not going to happen. It's already happening.
01:07:20.208 - 01:07:40.638, Speaker A: The AGI stuff is, yeah, I'm a little bit of a luddite, like a closet luddite. I know we all work in crypto, but I kind of have a little bit of a distrust of technology and I don't like buying software and stuff like that. I've been trying to wrap my mind around the implications of Chat GBT, and it's a little frightening, to be honest.
01:07:40.724 - 01:07:43.390, Speaker B: Have you seen the South Park episode? No.
01:07:43.460 - 01:07:45.230, Speaker A: Oh, they wrote a whole episode, right?
01:07:45.300 - 01:08:14.490, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Stan hooks his phone up to Chat GBT to text his girlfriend back, and they have this amazing relationship. And at one point she's just like, yeah, there's just one thing I don't get about the boating accident in Switzerland. And he's like, Wait, what? Like, Chat GBT has been making up this whole separate life for me. Blows up his relationship, blows up his family. It's like, yes, this is exactly how it's going to happen. So many people are going to get caught texting their girlfriends via Chat GPT.
01:08:14.490 - 01:08:18.940, Speaker B: My girlfriend not yours, though, right? No, never.
01:08:21.330 - 01:08:25.950, Speaker D: One of my friends has been using that for Hinge.
01:08:28.290 - 01:08:29.040, Speaker C: Really?
01:08:31.170 - 01:08:34.110, Speaker D: He's like, Everybody's going to start using it. I'm ahead of the curve.
01:08:34.930 - 01:08:35.790, Speaker A: He is.
01:08:35.940 - 01:08:36.734, Speaker B: Wow.
01:08:36.932 - 01:08:50.790, Speaker D: This is also the friend who, without meeting someone he met on Hinge, is going to a wedding in Tokyo with her. So Chat GPT already made up a trip.
01:08:52.170 - 01:08:56.980, Speaker A: I thought we're out of time. Yeah, it's been a fun one. All right, we'll see you next week.
