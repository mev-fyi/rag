00:00:00.330 - 00:00:14.590, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Avalanche, the layer one that is blazingly fast, low cost, and ecofriendly. You'll hear more about Avalanche later in the show. Maybe I'm the anomaly.
00:00:15.810 - 00:00:16.670, Speaker B: OOH.
00:00:18.450 - 00:00:19.310, Speaker A: OOH.
00:00:20.530 - 00:00:20.942, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:20.996 - 00:00:21.600, Speaker A: Boy.
00:00:21.970 - 00:00:23.630, Speaker B: Is framework hiring?
00:00:32.410 - 00:00:44.010, Speaker A: Court is in order. Court is in session. Today, we are kicking this off. We have Vance, Michael, Michael and Santiago. And we are talking about creator royalties. The biggest thing going on in crypto. No, I'm just kidding.
00:00:44.010 - 00:01:29.974, Speaker A: FTX and Binance obviously brought a bunch of smart fellas to the table today. Here's what I want to do. I want to really quickly go through just like a brief history of Alameda and FTX and their kind of alleged relationship. And then I want to go through a timeline of events, and then I want to spend the bulk of this conversation, guys, just talking about the most important things that you guys are paying attention to, the contagion, the risk in the system. I want to hear how obviously, Vance and Michael, I don't know how much you guys can talk about the fund and framework and just how you guys are thinking about things right now. Santi, if you're still with us, I think you just dropped, but just to hear how you're positioned right now, it sounded like santi, you didn't sleep much last night. I was messaging you and it was probably around two or three or four in the morning last night for you.
00:01:29.974 - 00:01:32.146, Speaker A: So just want to hear how you baby.
00:01:32.178 - 00:01:35.830, Speaker B: I just woke up and I had a very bad feeling about how things were going.
00:01:35.980 - 00:01:42.494, Speaker A: And here we are. I don't know what time zone you're on because I was messaging you. It seemed like it was like 04:00 a.m. Of time, but can't tell.
00:01:42.532 - 00:01:43.598, Speaker B: We lost track.
00:01:43.764 - 00:01:44.720, Speaker A: Yeah, never.
00:01:45.810 - 00:01:49.360, Speaker C: Last night was like the third non sleep night this year.
00:01:50.610 - 00:01:52.014, Speaker A: What were the other two?
00:01:52.212 - 00:01:54.320, Speaker D: I slept great last night.
00:01:54.850 - 00:01:57.490, Speaker E: I was going to say I did too. I slept like a baby.
00:01:59.190 - 00:02:09.474, Speaker D: Glass of wine, got to bed at like 1030. It was pretty good. I mean, we also don't have any funds on FTX, so I think that was probably most of it. That helps.
00:02:09.522 - 00:02:13.622, Speaker B: I do have some funds on FTX, just a little. But I did sleep like a baby. I woke up.
00:02:13.676 - 00:02:16.470, Speaker C: No, you did have funds on FTX.
00:02:16.970 - 00:02:17.960, Speaker B: No, I did.
00:02:20.890 - 00:02:23.590, Speaker A: Were you able to get those funds off FTX on Tweet?
00:02:23.950 - 00:03:07.800, Speaker B: No, they're still requested. I tweeted in the morning. Requested? I spelled like, okay, it's going to be 24 hours. And as soon as I woke up at three in the morning, which was like the six hour mark, and I was like, still requested. And I didn't catch the trick to withdraw in smaller increments. And I was talking to you, Jason, while all this was going, had my spidey senses went off and I was like, yeah, if I wake up and I don't get that nice confirmation email, then you sound the alarm. And the more I talked to a few people in the morning when I woke up on the East Coast, I sort of had a feeling that things were not going to be as great as most people thought they were.
00:03:08.250 - 00:03:20.522, Speaker A: Santi texted me and said, hey, are you having trouble pulling stuff off FTX? I said, I don't have anything on FTX, but we have some employees who have stuff on FTX. They're pulling stuff off. Santi goes, Is it size? I say, Santi, our size is not your size.
00:03:20.576 - 00:04:06.486, Speaker B: My listen, like, to be fair, yeah, it was most concerning while all this was going down is that they never tweeted. Obviously, Sam came out with this thread, like the infamous thread that you don't want to see, right? Funds are safe. Once you see that, it's like, okay, deja vu all over again. We've seen this movie play out before, but it's Sam, so it's not like Doe Kwan like, steady lads. But still, it was a little bit pretty concerning. And then, yeah, it was really bad how they manage. Like, I guess lawyers took over Comms, which is never a good thing, but they never kind of alerted.
00:04:06.486 - 00:04:21.360, Speaker B: Every private channel I was talking to is like, guys, are you having trouble withdrawing funds? And they're like, no, we're doing it. I'm like how much? And it's like, five k, ten k. You look on chain and then anything above 50K was not clearing. And I was like, yes. No, this is not good.
00:04:22.130 - 00:04:47.186, Speaker A: Let's give a little rundown. All right, so for folks, we're going to publish this on Empire and Bell Curve. So if you're listening right now, we're recording this on a live stream on YouTube. But just a quick, like, 62nd TLDR for those who don't know about FTX and Alameda. Sam, right? Sam was at Jane Street left in 2017. Did kind of a big Arbitrage play, I think it was in Japan. Then starts Alameda, which quickly becomes like this huge, very successful trading firm.
00:04:47.186 - 00:05:12.320, Speaker A: One of the largest market making firms in all of Crypto in 2019. They're looking for a better exchange, at least. This is the story. They go, launch FTX in April of 2019. From the get go, I'd say, like, pretty unclear how those two firms are connected. The trading firm that Sam started, he then put this guy, Sam Tribuco, in place. Sam left a couple of months ago, put this woman, Carol, if you hear the name Carolyn or Caroline, he put Caroline in place once Sam left.
00:05:12.320 - 00:05:40.022, Speaker A: But it's been pretty unclear, like, how those two firms are connected. Binance, a lot of people don't realize this was an early investor in FTX. So what ends up happening is FTX grows pretty rapidly. They end up becoming the second or third largest exchange in Crypto. SBX is on the COVID of Fortune. The title is like, the next Warren Buffett. Finance sold its stake and actually agreed to $2 billion of the buyout in FTT, which is we'll get to that later about why that's important.
00:05:40.022 - 00:06:26.680, Speaker A: So then Finance is basically holding this big multibillion dollar FTT bag, which is FTT's token that they use for trading fees. So anyways, what happens? A lot of this actually kicked off with a CoinDesk story. So on November 2, six days ago, CoinDesk published an article. Divisions in Sam Bankman fried's crypto empire blur on his trading titans. So, pretty damn long title. Basically, the story is written by this guy, ian Allison over at CoinDesk said, just looked into the assets and the balance sheet of FTX and Alameda, and I think this is an important place to kick off. So maybe Vance or Michael, can I ask one of you guys to just give a summary of what that CoinDesk article showed and what that kind of sparked in the market?
00:06:28.010 - 00:06:58.558, Speaker D: So what it showed, which was it felt like kind of like a coordinated campaign of some sort, just because all of these things were coming out at the same time, was a picture of Alameda's balance sheet. And it was only a parcel snapshot. And it was old, so you couldn't really tell what was going on. At the same time, the rough contours were pretty visible and scary. They had 10% of salana. We've done a lot of venture deals. We've never seen anybody own 10% of a base layer.
00:06:58.558 - 00:07:28.250, Speaker D: That was crazy. Most of their assets were in FTT. It turns out they controlled most of the float. They had like, serum. They had all these things that were down a lot. And the more I looked at the charts of like, you know, since the summer blow up till now, like, there are these very obvious levels, FTT at 22 and Salon at 30, which are being very clearly defended for some reason. And I think what we're realizing now is that those assets were pledged as collateral for loans which potentially blew up.
00:07:28.250 - 00:07:48.450, Speaker D: They also borrowed customer funds, potentially. We'll see. But it wasn't good, I would say would be the overall synopsis of it. And it came after the Dccpa, him getting kind of like bashed by everyone in the industry. Then it was like this balance sheet stuff. And this was like a surprise to most people. And I do want to make two things clear.
00:07:48.450 - 00:08:21.974, Speaker D: Number one, feel awful for everyone who is potentially stuck losing money, things like that. I think the second thing is the sense of surprise to me is a little bit surprising. Let me give you a hypothetical scenario. Let's imagine a world where Brian Armstrong ran his own prop fund. It traded most of the volume on Coinbase Exchange. He was the biggest investor in the tokens that pumped the hardest during 2021 through this entity. And he also borrowed customer funds.
00:08:21.974 - 00:08:39.700, Speaker D: People would be immediately like, red flags, red flags, red flags, whatever. But for some reason, the Tom Brady, the effective altruism, like the fluffy profiles in these magazines that kind of made everyone docile and it wasn't a threat, but it turns out it was. And that's kind of where we are.
00:08:42.070 - 00:09:34.750, Speaker E: Mean, we talked about this on Bell Curve last week, but I thought it was pretty shocking when that I know it was a partial document or whatever, but I think we talked about I kind of assumed with Alameda. Based on where the market was. Like, if you looked at their balance sheet, it was going to be mostly cash, maybe some Bitcoin and some ETH, basically. And there's pretty safe trading going on. So I think the whole market kind of collectively looked at that and there were a lot of question marks around like, is this really the best way to have $14 billion allocated? And then the next big shoe to drop that I think a lot of people thought was pretty funky was Caroline basically calling out that $22 target, and maybe you guys are smarter than me. Maybe other participants in the market were smarter than me. But I think a lot of people interpreted that as saying, if you actually thought FTT if you wanted to accumulate known more of it, you would have just let it dump and then buy it on the dip.
00:09:34.750 - 00:09:49.558, Speaker E: But the reason why you set out a price target like that, it's almost like central banking want to run, right? You tell the market what you want the price to be, then you back up the truck to support that price level because there's a reason for that. And I think that's when the market started to kind of smell weakness.
00:09:49.734 - 00:10:30.550, Speaker C: I mean, it reminds me of, I think it was Zero Hedge, the Twitter Zero Hedge was tweeting out literally the Three Arrows liquidation price on like June 22 or something like that this year. One of the other sleepless nights this year, at that moment, it was like, okay, this is going to happen. At that point, there's just too much interest. There's too many people involved. I mean, the other thing to keep in mind here is this is a slow moving train wreck. This is probably known for weeks. The fact that it was moving against them, the fact that the balance sheet came out is probably testament to the fact that this was something that was going to happen and it just happened a lot faster because the balance sheet came out and because of the 22 price point.
00:10:30.550 - 00:11:13.342, Speaker C: All this stuff is not just happening in a vacuum. It's happening because of a reason. So it's unfortunate to see I think the other thing Vance and I were talking about this morning was this is another stain on the track record of CFI, but DeFi is doing fine. And this is another reason why transparent finance, open permissionless or open finance is valuable because you can actually see the flows. We're talking about whether or not you're seeing the withdrawals actually get processed. You're talking about where the assets are, who's rehypothecating them. If you actually have a track record that lives on chain and everybody can see that, it's a huge advantage in the world of unregulated finance centralized.
00:11:13.486 - 00:11:43.578, Speaker A: Let me take us back into the timeline here because I want to make sure that we make this entire timeline out. So actually, before Caroline tweeted out the $22, let me take us to so the CoinDesk story drops on November 2 when someone like that publishes something just like a look behind Media. It's not like FTX didn't know that was coming. CoinDesk is a good media brand. They gave FTX heads must I'm sure they told FTX that this was going to drop. So Caroline, the real question is how CoinDesk got it. How CoinDesk got it.
00:11:43.578 - 00:11:44.598, Speaker A: Let's get into that.
00:11:44.624 - 00:11:46.110, Speaker E: A little question.
00:11:46.180 - 00:12:08.910, Speaker A: That's a real one. And how pissed is Barry that they released it? Because now there's negative impact on Genesis, but that's the real one. A few notes. So Caroline tweeted this out. All these tweets, there are four big tweets from November 6. So first off, Caroline, who is the CEO or co CEO of Alameda, tweets a few notes on the balance sheet that has been circulating recently. One, that specific balance sheet is for a subset of our corporate entities.
00:12:08.910 - 00:12:35.366, Speaker A: We have over $10 billion of assets that aren't reflected there. The balance sheet breaks out a few of our biggest long positions, et cetera, et cetera. Given the tightening in the crypto credit space, we've returned most of our loans right now. So she says we've returned most of our loans right now. About an hour after that, CZ tweets out the big tweet that kicked a lot of this off as part of Finance's exit from FTX Equity. Last year, Finance received roughly $2.1 billion in BUSD and FTT.
00:12:35.366 - 00:12:48.850, Speaker A: Due to recent revelations that have came to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books. We're going to try to do this in a way that minimizes market impact due to market conditions and limited liquidity. We expect this to take a few months.
00:12:48.920 - 00:12:52.660, Speaker E: So basically, this is what was the time on that?
00:12:53.430 - 00:12:55.154, Speaker A: This was 11:00 a.m.. On a on.
00:12:55.192 - 00:12:56.782, Speaker E: A 11:00 A.m. On a Sunday.
00:12:56.846 - 00:13:16.710, Speaker A: On a Sunday. So, by the way, minimizing market, you don't announce this on a Sunday because it's the least liquidity. So CZ, this is CZ basically saying, I'm about to dump like $2 billion of FTT. He's doing it on a Sunday morning. Now. He says he's like, I want to do this in a way that minimizes the market impact. So then that's when Caroline responds.
00:13:16.710 - 00:13:45.022, Speaker A: Hey, CZ, if you're looking to minimize the market impact on your FTT sales, alameda will happily buy it all from you today at 22. Then that's when CZ tweets again. Liquidating our FTT is just post exit risk management. Learnings from Luna. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after a divorce. We're not against anyone, but we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. So now he's taking a jab, right? He's taking a jab at FTX.
00:13:45.022 - 00:13:59.110, Speaker A: And this is when to me, I was like, oh, okay, this is his moment. He's been waiting for this for years. He's going for the jugular here. That was my take when he sent that out. I'm curious, Santia, I don't know if you have a when you saw these tweets on Sunday, I'm curious what you thought about this.
00:13:59.260 - 00:14:12.302, Speaker B: Well, I was running marathon and then I came back to York. I'm like, I was pretty tired. I'm looking at this going like, oh shit, I think I'm going to go to bed. And I'm like, no, every time you try to go back, the crypto market.
00:14:12.356 - 00:14:13.598, Speaker C: Just pulls you back.
00:14:13.764 - 00:15:16.558, Speaker B: Anyways, I look at this and I'm like, yeah, well, I immediately ping a few folks. I'm like, how credible is this? And then the first one was my immediate reaction was like, well, first of all, FTX has acquired a bunch of other folks. What's going to be the contagion if this thing actually goes down? Particularly Genesis and a few other folks? And I'm thinking, you look at the price of FTT, what you guys were saying before is like, okay, are they getting margin called? And if they are, then this can spiral out of control quickly. And so, yeah, the tweet from Caroline was pretty telling and you're just kind of waiting to break that 22 level. And it did, I think, what it was like 18 hours ago. And that's where I think things really kind of kicked into high gear. So, yeah, for me, I unfortunately had a small amount of funds on FTX.
00:15:16.558 - 00:16:21.910, Speaker B: I tried to know some decent size, I guess, yesterday night. And then I was talking to you, Jason, about it, and it sounds like some withdrawals were being processed, but not some. And as soon as I woke up this morning and saw that it was still processing, that's where I started to get some really bad kind of spidey senses. The question now really is we saw so much contagion from Three Arrows, arguably it's still going on. Now the two things that are on my mind are, okay, well, who's next? Genesis basically, FDX absorbed so much from the contagion, or we thought it did from the prior contagion, which was Luna and then Three Arrows, but that's now being put back front and center. And then you have to question what's going to happen with Genesis and BlockFi and some other folks out there. Basically, any lender in crypto, most lenders in crypto have exposure.
00:16:21.910 - 00:16:52.302, Speaker B: And so I think what you're seeing now, this massive sell off, because, Jason, maybe you want to come to this next, which is as soon as the announcement was made by Sam and CC about the acquisition of know the market kind of did a bit of a relief rally and then it dumped really hard. And I think what you're seeing now is the early signs of just a massive run where people are being margin called and liquidated and it's going to get pretty ugly, I think.
00:16:52.436 - 00:17:14.530, Speaker A: I want to go to the contagion. Right. So we were just on November 6, which was a Sunday, it's really important to talk about the tweets on the 7th because there's one line from one Sam tweet that I think is going to be a key point. So that was all on Sunday. So then on Monday, by the way, we're recording this at like 04:00 p.m.. Eastern on Tuesday. Sam tweets out Monday morning said a competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors.
00:17:14.530 - 00:17:33.046, Speaker A: FTX is fine, assets are fine. Then he says FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. Then this is the key line. So we don't invest any client assets, not even in Treasuries. We've been processing all withdrawals and will continue to be. We're heavily regulated, even when that slows us down. We have GAAP audits.
00:17:33.046 - 00:17:51.710, Speaker A: We have over a billion dollars in excess cash. We have a long history of safeguarding client assets, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. And then he ends it with, I'd love it. CZ, if we could work together for this ecosystem. CZ. Then tweets out a little later, he's like, I was out with friends yesterday when the topic of whale alerts came up. Following our principles, I decided to be transparent.
00:17:51.710 - 00:18:15.734, Speaker A: Little did I know it was going to be the camel that broke the straw that broke the camel's back. And then actually, I think the most interesting tweet of yesterday was when I saw this tweet from Arthur Hayes last night. He said, when you can lend money to the US government at close to 5% for one year, a lot of other investments cease to make sense. The Crypto credit carnage will claim more victims. Bear. Stearns equals Luna. Three Arrows and Celsius.
00:18:15.734 - 00:18:31.280, Speaker A: Who's going to be Lehman? And when I saw that, I was like, daddy, Arthur knows something's coming. And that's when I think things really started to so that led into the selling of I just lay that up because that's the timeline pre market. Absolutely.
00:18:31.890 - 00:18:48.500, Speaker B: I want to ask you a question, guys, because one thing that I noticed from the latest thread from Sam was around this idea that FTX US is fine. It seems like they are fully backed one to one. He has a line that.
00:18:50.230 - 00:18:51.110, Speaker D: Know, customer.
00:18:51.180 - 00:19:40.120, Speaker B: Funds are backed one to one, we are processing withdrawals. Now that to me feels like a minor footnote in the prior statement, which probably they're like, okay, you're processing withdrawals. And now he's probably going to try to say, well, I really meant to say that customer funds and I was referring to specifically about FTX US, not the broader FTX, because it sounds to me like there obviously is a liquidity crunch. They're not processing withdrawals and a lot of FTX non US, it sounds like they were using funds because they can't process all these withdrawals. Or maybe it's a mismatch of assets and liabilities and they have assets everywhere with a bunch of lenders and hot and cold storage, but they can't move them around as easily and they can't process withdrawals. So I'm curious to get your guys'take on that.
00:19:42.010 - 00:19:55.020, Speaker C: It begs the question, if you have to say that your assets are backed one to one, customer deposits are backed one to one, what assets are not backed one to one? And if you have to say that for FTS US, why is that not the case for Fts.com?
00:19:55.630 - 00:20:01.786, Speaker B: It almost feels like he's saying that. He's admitting that non US FTX is not backed one to one.
00:20:01.888 - 00:20:02.540, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:20:04.190 - 00:21:05.950, Speaker E: I think one of the things that accelerated this too, there was like the silence is deafening type effect where a lot of people began looking kind of the on chain. So like where is FTX's cold wallet? Right? Because you can kind of point to that for Binance or Coinbase, et cetera. And everyone was kind of like, well, where is the know cold storage wallet that all these funds are supposedly held in and no one could kind of find it. And there was start to be like this din growing about, hey, they could very easily just stop all this market chatter and protect their position if they just pointed to this wallet. And the fact that they weren't doing that, I think probably increased the pressure on them and probably increased the speed of the withdrawals. I think that also probably led to speculation, right? This is not a confirmed thing, but what people are speculating on right now is, was FTX essentially lending out, right? Were either customer deposits or something like it being used to generate yield basically on that platform? If that was the case, there's total speculation, but that would be an enormous violation.
00:21:06.770 - 00:21:32.146, Speaker C: This kind of reminds me of what was going on at the end of June and July of last of this year. Wow, feels like a year ago. But when everybody was like, oh wait, Andreessen just raised four and a half billion. You've got billions in the coffers. Like where's the bid going to come from? Someone's going to come in at $1,000 ETH and someone's going to buy up all that ETH. It didn't really happen because there wasn't really a bid. And it's kind of the same thing with the cold wallet for FTX.
00:21:32.146 - 00:22:06.322, Speaker C: It's like, well wait, no, they've got a cold wallet somewhere. I know. Oh, sorry, it was in my left pocket, not my right pocket. And I think it's just not going to get there. The other thing that happened, that it's been talked about on Twitter, at least, but unsubstantiated, was that FTS was out trying to raise capital yesterday and today and to the tune of five to $6 billion, which is a pretty huge hole, when the last equity valuation that you had was, what, 28 and a half billion? Like 25% of your company. You're trying to fill that hole. And whether or not that's true, we don't know.
00:22:06.322 - 00:22:10.440, Speaker C: But if that is the case, then this could get a lot deeper than we think.
00:22:11.290 - 00:22:53.220, Speaker B: Should we talk a little bit about the relationship between the different entities here? Like there's FTX, there's FTX, us, and then there's Alameda, which is kind of front and center to all this whole mess, I think, which is the relationship between FTX and Alameda has always felt a bit contentious, particularly one is a trading arm. And even though it has been put into question in terms of the conflict of interest, if you're investing in particular venture deals and then Alameda is making a market on those. So maybe if we can just cover that, I think it would be important. And then what's going to happen to Alameda in this case, given the Binance acquisition, if it goes through.
00:22:55.430 - 00:23:02.200, Speaker A: Vance or Michael? Can you guys take that? Because you guys trade against Alameda and or with Alameda I would have to.
00:23:04.810 - 00:23:12.810, Speaker D: Like generally when you're trading crypto, you're trading against like four or five big market making firms. It's not know we seek them out and go to trade against them.
00:23:12.960 - 00:23:14.854, Speaker A: Who's. Alameda jump winter mute.
00:23:14.902 - 00:23:19.420, Speaker D: Alameda jump winter mute. Like full Feng, like a few others.
00:23:20.770 - 00:23:21.774, Speaker C: It depends on the market.
00:23:21.812 - 00:23:23.760, Speaker D: But yeah, it depends on the market.
00:23:24.690 - 00:23:25.854, Speaker B: And sorry, what was the question?
00:23:25.892 - 00:23:39.330, Speaker A: Yano, just like before this, obviously they said that FTX and Alameda were very separate. But how have you, as this sophisticated crypto investor, thought about the relationship between FTX and Alameda?
00:23:40.070 - 00:24:28.494, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there was never any confirmed proof, but Michael and I's intuition was that Alameda has been around for probably four years, since 2018, and they used to be smaller. And there was around the moment that FTX launched, they got a lot bigger. And I'm not like a rocket scientist, but it seemed like they were getting some source of external funds that was not available to the rest of the market makers. The rest of the market makers just were not growing at that same clip. And I think there has been some the narrative was that it was like some freak gamma trade or some freak DeFi farm that just netted them a few billion dollars. But we did really well during DeFi summer. We weren't pulling billions of dollars out of these yield farms.
00:24:28.494 - 00:25:00.294, Speaker D: That just doesn't seem possible. And so we knew that something was wrong. And also the way that their margin lending was set up was such that you could put stablecoins on there, you could flip your lending switch to on and there would just be this instantaneous borrow, like someone was borrowing these assets. It was very clear. And it just seemed like the most logical point that it would be Alameda. And so it was something somewhat of like an open secret. We didn't really have any information or anything like that to confirm what we thought was happening, but we just didn't put funds on FTX.
00:25:00.294 - 00:25:34.182, Speaker D: We didn't buy into any of the ecosystem coins. We just kind of stayed away. And yeah, so my theory is basically the combination of the whole setup know, the alameda balance sheet got released, and it felt like they were going to survive that. The Dccpa stuff got released, and it felt like that they were going to survive that. And it even felt like they were going to survive. CZ market selling $500 million of FTT. Like Caroline told him that they could take him out of that at 22.
00:25:34.182 - 00:26:23.080, Speaker D: No reason to not believe that. I think what really hurt them was when the bank run started. That to me was like the kind of the death blow, because that put stress on Alameda and Alameda would have to they were funding FTX deposits and withdrawals with Alameda hot wallets from Kucoin, like alameda wallets that we knew of. And once that started to happen, it was know, game over in my mind. But I really hope what didn't happen was that he tried to rescue Alameda to save think, I think that's kind of the question. Who got into trouble first? Who needed rescuing? Did he rescue Alameda with customer funds? Did he rescue FTX with Alameda funds? That I feel like is going to be the crux of if and when this goes to court. What people talk about.
00:26:24.170 - 00:27:09.560, Speaker B: Do you guys look at the well, I think if you look know, them trying to defend FTT, if they're being margin called, whoever it is, Valame is being margin called, or FTX is being margin called. Because my understanding is that a lot of lenders have exposure and they were using FTX as collateral to fund their operations. And so as soon as you start getting margin calls at different levels, you're wondering, well, how are they filling that collateral and where is that coming from? I hope it's not using customer funds, but if they did end up doing that as a kind of measure of last resort, then that's where it gets pretty bad. But again, I don't know if that's true or not, but I hope it's not.
00:27:10.890 - 00:27:44.998, Speaker E: I think the other thing to point out just as well about kind of tracing Alameda's history as well. Again, a lot of this is kind of hearsay, but if you hear the way that's described usually from Sam, it's like, oh, we started out as this very small operation, and it was kind of like, at this time, they're taking advantage of the Kimchi premium. There was bitcoin that was traded in the US. Was very different in Japan or other exchanges and kind of made money doing old fashioned arbitrage. And that's how. We got our start, but definitely by the end element was not necessarily seen like that. Definitely they were very large, sophisticated fund that was now it's clear, taking outsized risk.
00:27:44.998 - 00:28:35.330, Speaker E: But there's even a difference between taking outside risks and maybe the allegation was engaging in some sort of pump and dump type activity, right? There were like a couple assets that you can look up on. Know, I don't want to sling any mudder. I mean, I don't know, obviously some pretty unethical stuff was going on. But you can look at Google Alameda on Twitter, and some of these threads will come up. There have been a couple of people that have put them together, but I think it's been sort of known for a little while that some of the trading and the activity they've engaged in hasn't been 100% on the up and up. And I think that's also why probably people were more willing to jump on this when they sensed weakness than otherwise they would have been. But I think it's important to point out alameda is a very different entity now than it was when it started out or began.
00:28:36.310 - 00:28:57.586, Speaker D: So the Kimchi premium origin story, I have no idea if that's right or not, but when I hear pieces of information like that, I'm kind of doing three things. Number one, I'm like, okay, you made all your money from the Kimchi premium. Cool. That's interesting. It shows that you're talented. I'm trying to read into what might be between the lines. These guys are super aggressive.
00:28:57.586 - 00:29:28.430, Speaker D: They're internationally based. They're willing to do anything to make money. The third thing I'm thinking about is, why am I hearing this information about like, do they want me to think something? Do I believe this to be true? What are the chances that you can pull out as much money as Alameda had from this Kimchi premium trade? Very low. And so even that was kind of like a little suspect. We knew people who did the Kimchi premium trade. Maybe they made a million bucks, maybe a couple of million. It wasn't that big of a money maker.
00:29:28.430 - 00:29:31.358, Speaker D: So it just kind of was like another red flag. Honestly.
00:29:31.534 - 00:29:33.458, Speaker C: One thing to double click with the.
00:29:33.464 - 00:29:45.894, Speaker D: Balance sheet in CoinDesk. When that came out, I was reading it literally. I was trying to interpret any second order effects. But I was also thinking, like, why am I reading this? And I think the why was know CZ is about to put the hammer down.
00:29:46.012 - 00:29:48.570, Speaker A: So you think that CZ leaked this to CoinDesk?
00:29:50.110 - 00:30:02.720, Speaker D: Who knows? Stories like that don't end up in places like that by accident. It's not like some person just decided to give them this because they felt like it one day. There was some sort of.
00:30:05.890 - 00:30:51.414, Speaker B: You got to wonder. One of the things that CZ said that's pretty interesting is we've supported this. It sounds like he knew that this was going on for a long time as an investor in FTX, you have insight into how this is managed and operated, and you do diligence on that. And I think Binance does pretty thorough diligence in the things that they invest in. So I got to believe that he knew about this. You got to wonder, how many has it been years? And then he just chose this moment because you just get triggered by some of the lobbying efforts that Sam over the years has gone fairly involved in politics and very vocal about regulation and was throwing mud on Binance, it seems. And that triggered CZ.
00:30:51.414 - 00:31:16.718, Speaker B: And then you set in motion and you choose the right timing, and things are always to your point, man. It's very coordinated. You look at three arrows and Luna. I mean, a lot of this stuff is coordinated. You got to wonder who else knew about this and how long has it been going on, and you just choose a perfect storm to shoot the I.
00:31:16.744 - 00:32:06.846, Speaker A: Have a feeling that I think CZ will go down as one of the best entrepreneurs of the last hundred years, or ever, maybe. I think he's an incredible entrepreneur. I have a feeling that CZ saw FTX as like this big investment, and maybe a friend three years ago or four years ago when they were starting off, but FTX started to become competitive, to finance. And I have a feeling that CZ over the last 18 months, or maybe even just since the bear market, we're exactly one year into this bear market. I have a feeling that someone who's as cutthroat and ruthless as CZ is saying, okay, at some point in this bear market, I'm going for the drug dealer. At some point, I'm trying to take FTX out. He has more insight into what FTX is doing than pretty much anyone else other than folks who actually work at FTX.
00:32:06.846 - 00:32:43.370, Speaker A: And I think through this, I don't know who leaked this article, the info to CoinDesk, but I think CZ just saw this as an opportunity to go for the jugular. And here's what he was able to expose. He was able to expose a bunch of like and it all was just this perfect storm. One, I think he exposed, or this all maybe not CZ. This all exposed that Alameda and FTX were way more closely related and working more closely together than anyone realized. I think it revealed that FTT was probably propped up as collateral, right? Because you can use FTT as collateral inside of FTX. I think it revealed that Alameda was more directionally in the hole than people realized.
00:32:43.370 - 00:33:11.110, Speaker A: I think when people look at Alameda, they see this huge trading firm that makes a boatload of mean. Their portfolio looked like a retail trader's portfolio. Like it wasn't this amazing portfolio. And then the fourth is that, which is the most important thing, is that it's very possible that FTX was operating on this fractional reserve model, lending customer deposits back to Alameda, which is by far the most important of those four. But those are like my four takeaways. As I think about what this is kind of exposed.
00:33:11.530 - 00:33:45.886, Speaker C: 100% agree. The other thing that I was going to touch on when Vance was talking about the Kimchi premium is let's just diagnose what that trade actually is. What that means is that you're buying spot coins, spot bitcoin on one exchange. And because there was lack of liquidity and lack of ability to get into the South Korean market, you literally had to have your own bank account. You had to be KYC with the South Korean exchange. You had to be able to get that to be able to trade bitcoin in the South Korean exchange, which is trading at sometimes like 14% higher rate. So it's not like the most sophisticated trade.
00:33:45.886 - 00:34:06.380, Speaker C: It's like buying and selling at the same time and you're just moving money from one account to the other at a premium of 14%. Whether or not they were able to extract the billions that they allude to being able to do is one thing, but to your point on the balance sheet, it does look like a retail trader's trade because the Kimchi premium was also a retail trader's trade. It's not that.
00:34:08.430 - 00:34:13.840, Speaker E: Know, can you kind of take us through the end of the timeline here and where we're at? And I'd love to guys, get your.
00:34:14.450 - 00:34:48.434, Speaker A: Contagion too or go mean. Where we're at now is FTT started dumping last night. What was happening is that basically FTT started falling late last night. Alameda started selling sol to keep I think this was what was happening. Alameda started selling salana to keep FTT above 22. Eventually, I don't know what happened, maybe they ran out of Seoul or something, but basically just that $22. It's not a peg, but like proverbial peg broke and FTT just started completely tanking.
00:34:48.434 - 00:35:22.482, Speaker A: Meanwhile, CZ was probably dumping FTT as well. Market starts really dumping FTT. And then while that's happening, there starts to be obviously fear in FTT. More and more people start selling FTT. As that's happening, there starts to be a bank run on FTX saying, well, shit, if FTX is kind of propped up by this FTT as well, then I got to get my money out of FTX. And so that just kicked off this huge spur of withdrawals. And what's FTT at right now? 555 56%.
00:35:22.482 - 00:35:45.878, Speaker A: Today. Exactly today. Vance, I'll throw this to you as you sit here. 05:00 p.m on Tuesday. What's the biggest thing when you're thinking about just like second order impact? The contagion of this. There's a bunch of directions we can go impact on folks like the Blockfis and Voyagers and Genesis.
00:35:45.878 - 00:35:52.800, Speaker A: There's the impact on the regulatory side of the world. There's the impact on just like does this prolong the bear market? What's top of mind for you right now?
00:35:56.690 - 00:36:52.494, Speaker D: So I think top of mind is Michael and I have spent the know however long, since the top, basically just looking at all of the data for all of the protocols, seeing who's doing well, seeing who's not doing well, where the traction is. And in an event like this, what we should potentially buy. So that's kind of the first thing that we're thinking through is we're not running for the hills. We're just like buying more high quality or at least we think high quality crypto assets. So that's the first thing. The second thing is when the Luna and Three Arrow stuff happened in the summer, there was kind of this period where we weren't sure if the monster was dead or just hiding in the closet and everyone was just waiting for the coast to be clear. And that was like a palpable feeling of like and I think the most contagion and is the coast clear? Like those types of words.
00:36:52.494 - 00:37:37.710, Speaker D: And my lawyer just texted me, none of this is financial advice. If you are going to buy crypto, refer to your lawyer or broker. Whoever does that frameworks lawyer despises us at this point. We have the best lawyer of all time, but unfortunately he's a stickler. But yeah, so things I'm thinking about when is the contagion, the coast is clear, vibe going to be done? And I think that largely depends on the speed at which the steel comes together and that's probably also something we should discuss at a certain point. My sense is that it either closes in the next like twelve to 24 hours or it doesn't at all. And really only crypto native investors can move this quickly.
00:37:37.710 - 00:38:15.930, Speaker D: They're the only people in the world who can get diligence done and wire funds in 24 hours. I think that is why probably a lot of the other people just didn't go for this deal. You'd have to imagine CZ is the absolute last person that SBF would want to engage. You know, that's something I'm thinking about. When does it kind of end? When is that sense of is the coast of clear gone? Because I think that weighs on the space from a sentiment perspective. I'm thinking about a lot of people who have eight, nine figures stuck in FTX and what they do because they're like technically creditors. And I think my guess is that ever since the summer, crypto credit has been super tight.
00:38:15.930 - 00:38:49.830, Speaker D: Genesis, whole new team, whole new underwriting standard, voyager is done, BlockFi is done. The Asian lenders are really dinged up from bad bitcoin minor loans, so there wasn't really any credit to borrow, at least from our perspective. So I'm wondering if it's more of the traditional financial institutions who've been lending to them. And that's something I think about. And the last thing I think about is basically policy and what the narrative is for. Hey, you know that guy that was in Washington aggressively talking to you and telling that he's going to be the future of the industry. And he's got all the regulations and stuff figured out.
00:38:49.830 - 00:39:03.354, Speaker D: Turns out he's insolvent. They totally blew up. Like, yep, we know that midterms are today. We know that he was there last week are bad. But I think the narrative here is that Jesus texting me.
00:39:03.392 - 00:39:03.834, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:39:03.952 - 00:39:26.210, Speaker D: The narrative here is basically CFI blew up again, you guys should regulate that. DeFi has no problems. It's actually done really well today. Nothing's broken. Ethereum is about to be deflationary. So let's craft language around that. And I think the political dynamics have also changed in Washington, such that Sam is a huge Democratic liberal donor.
00:39:26.210 - 00:40:00.140, Speaker D: When Republicans take over, if they take over tonight, it's going to be a very different conversation. Whereas if the opposite had happened, if the Democrats were forced to deal with SBF and on the regulations and all that stuff, I just don't know how constructive that would be. It feels like the Republicans kind of just can kind of say, like, he did know that's CFI, let's regulate that. There's more of a carve out. Generally, they're more favorable to our DeFi position. As you know, I think people are freaking out, but I'm actually pretty positive, but just waiting for that coast is clear feeling to be gone.
00:40:03.090 - 00:40:15.730, Speaker E: I want to dig into a whole bunch of those. But can we get a sense of magnitude here? Just maybe in comparison even to Three Arrows and Celsius and Voyager going bust.
00:40:16.630 - 00:40:18.126, Speaker B: This is way bigger.
00:40:18.318 - 00:40:19.060, Speaker D: No.
00:40:20.870 - 00:40:23.570, Speaker C: I would say smaller as well. This is way smaller.
00:40:24.070 - 00:40:25.054, Speaker D: Way smaller.
00:40:25.102 - 00:40:27.250, Speaker A: Oh, really? I was thinking bigger.
00:40:27.410 - 00:41:02.878, Speaker C: Yeah, no, the largest loser in all of this is the equity holder of FTX, because you know that I'm assuming that customer deposits are actually probably going to be able to be resolved. It's just going to take time. And maybe there'll be some haircut. Frankly, if there is a haircut, that's going to be a major stain. But I think it actually is probably something that's just taking a long time to process. But I do think that the people that put in at 28 billion and now it's going to be sold for pennies on the dollar. That's a tough stain, but that's going to be contained to a certain small set of investors that were able to buy into that.
00:41:02.878 - 00:41:32.762, Speaker C: FTT holders. Obviously those are going to be the ones, but it seems like Alameda had like 90% of the float there anyways. This actually, I think, gets pretty contained pretty quickly. The bigger part was Blockfly, Voyager, Celsius, those were retail customers. And once again, this is assuming that retail is going to be fine and that people who have deposits are going to be fine, which is an assumption, but it's at least not a loan book. It's an. So I think this actually is a little bit easier than those.
00:41:32.896 - 00:41:48.254, Speaker A: All right, folks. This episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava. Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now.
00:41:48.254 - 00:42:08.614, Speaker A: Crypto wallets and browser extensions. They feel clunky. They feel non intuitive. That's why Avalabs built Core. It's a free noncustodial browser extension that gives avalanche users a seamless and secure web three experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try Core. Here's what I'm experimenting with.
00:42:08.614 - 00:42:44.026, Speaker A: Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet. It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn, yield or borrow against your Bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those C Five platforms. Right now, core's native Bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your Bitcoin to avalanche's robust DFI ecosystem. Last but not least, Core makes on ramping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the MoonPay.
00:42:44.026 - 00:43:00.200, Speaker A: Integration just takes a few clicks. Download Core today using the link in the show notes. It's really, really nice. If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using Core. Download Core using the link below. Now let's get back to the show.
00:43:01.530 - 00:43:33.966, Speaker B: Michael, I tend to agree with you, although that operating assumption that you're making is one that does concern me, which is I'm thinking about all the exposure of major lenders in the space, the Genesis of the world and what's going to happen to them. And obviously that has implications. I guess the question is what happens to customer funds at BlockFi? Those would not be impacted, assuming that.
00:43:33.988 - 00:43:43.460, Speaker C: Those would not be impacted, right. And customer funds at Genesis, if Genesis is one of the larger lenders to Alameda and let's assume that the liabilities surpass the assets at this point.
00:43:45.430 - 00:43:45.746, Speaker D: I.
00:43:45.768 - 00:43:57.720, Speaker C: Think Barry Silbert and DTG probably going to be able to figure out a way to plug that hole. But it is something, once again, that's contained. It's not going to be customer deposits that are in the.
00:44:00.970 - 00:44:47.094, Speaker D: Draw. Just to draw a clean parallel in terms of numbers, I'm just trying to find the amount of bitcoin that Doe had. What I remember of the Luna and Three Arrow stuff was he sold like 80,000 or something bitcoin. When it was like at, he sold it within like 48 hours, and then Celsius blew up after that and then after that. The big scary candle in June was when all of the centralized OTC desk tried to clear their books on the same weekend. Like michael. We were in New York.
00:44:47.094 - 00:44:50.700, Speaker D: It was that Saturday. Always remember that.
00:44:51.150 - 00:44:51.814, Speaker C: No sleep.
00:44:51.862 - 00:45:14.126, Speaker D: Number two this year. I literally no joke. I thought the Chinese were, like, attacking us or something. I thought we were at war. I was like googling news to see what was actually going on. But that was the most amount of selling that I'd ever seen in a short amount of time period ever. I don't think it's possible to reproduce that level of selling just with the level of leverage in the system right now.
00:45:14.126 - 00:45:38.070, Speaker D: And it depends on who their creditors are. If it's Genesis and they lent them some money, they're not going to turn around and sell like a few yards of crypto. That's just like it's only going to make the situation worse. I really don't think this is going to be quite as bad. But yeah, it just depends. The lenders are done, I don't know, they're probably just completely toast.
00:45:38.410 - 00:46:27.670, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the game theory here is, do you think the acquisition does go through? One of the things that's been interesting is how BNB has performed since all this happened. It's holding up fairly well. It's down 5%, but if you start looking at it's probably the best performing coin since over the last five days. And if you're a CZ, I think the thing that scares me the most, if this acquisition doesn't go through, then I think naturally users will be affected and they may not be made whole. And if that's the case, and I think that has a much bigger implication of the industry from a regulatory perspective. And again, anytime customers lose funds, it is probably the biggest setback that we can have as an industry.
00:46:27.670 - 00:47:01.266, Speaker B: And hopefully the acquisition goes through because if it does and withdrawals are at some point resuming, it restores a lot of confidence. And I think from a regulatory perspective, I think that'll be the most positive thing. And also from just Binance market share, I think here binance at this point you're thinking about 2nd, 3rd order effects and I think they can stand to really just continue to win a lot of market share just through the acquisition and also just by being the preferred kind of exchange in the market.
00:47:01.448 - 00:47:41.338, Speaker C: So keep in mind one quick thing. When Sam went out and bought BlockFi, the major component of that deal, at least, and I actually do truly believe that he means well, it may just be the case that he got over his skis a bit. But when they bought BlockFi, the major component of that was whether or not they were going to keep customer deposits whole. I do truly believe, once again, this is probably the last place that Sam wanted to sell FTX to. And it probably was the only place that would be able to guarantee that you were able to have customer deposits whole. I do truly believe that he wants to make sure that that holds true. You're right though, Santiago.
00:47:41.338 - 00:47:47.380, Speaker C: If that doesn't hold, then we have a bigger issue. But I think that this is the solution to having that be true.
00:47:47.990 - 00:48:28.542, Speaker D: I'm like 50 50 if this goes through. So on the Bear case, for it not going through. Number one, they had Tiger, they had SoftBank, they had Tomasic, like the most deep pocketed funds in the world look at this and say no, ostensibly right, because they went to know if he really hates this guy and he has this personal animus for him. This is the kill shot. You drag out the liquidity crunch, you reneg on the deal last minute. That's it. So that's like the Bear case, the bull case is that people know kind of who started this.
00:48:28.542 - 00:48:53.400, Speaker D: It was CZ, and if he's in regulatory hot water anywhere, people are just going to be like, hey, losing a bunch of customer deposits after you promise to backstop them, that's not going to engender you to anybody. And I don't think he actually loses that much. That money comes to his platform, they trade it on finance, he gets the fees. It's very lucrative. He'll make more than what he put in and ten times that probably.
00:48:55.690 - 00:48:59.720, Speaker A: How much do you think the acquisition happens for? What's the purchase price here?
00:49:00.650 - 00:49:27.186, Speaker D: I don't even know if it's a purchase price thing. I think it's like, how much customer deposits do you need a backstop? Like the people at FTX ostensibly hate being run by BNB, so you're not really buying the employees or the human capital. Binance has probably better regulatory standing in most countries. Like, you're not buying any licenses either. Binance has probably better finance does not.
00:49:27.208 - 00:49:31.826, Speaker A: Have better regulatory standing than FTX definitely does.
00:49:31.928 - 00:49:38.894, Speaker D: No, sure, but it's not like, okay, cool, we're buying this thing that's going to be all shiny and clean up our reputation like you're buying a defunct exchange.
00:49:38.942 - 00:49:54.890, Speaker B: No, they're buying deposits and that LTV of that is much higher than whatever the purchase price. It's going to probably be a taste of his own medicine, which is how we structured the blockfly deal, contingent on some sort of stuff no one really knew. And that's how he's going to say he's like, hey, it's your playbook.
00:49:56.190 - 00:50:10.782, Speaker C: You can go out and buy the bank. Banks cost just like a trust, a community bank or something small like that. You literally can buy them for like a million and a half dollars. The problem is you take on the liabilities that the bank also has, so you have to be able to backstop that as well.
00:50:10.836 - 00:50:20.978, Speaker D: And all the lawsuits and all the other everything. I think that's a very Bearish probably doesn't get done side of your in your Bear case.
00:50:21.144 - 00:51:06.770, Speaker B: I guess we haven't touched on what happens on there's a couple of entities right there's FTX, FTX, US, which is being segregated, but the elephant in the room is like, what happens there? That's the liability part. That's the biggest risk piece of all this. And I don't have enough insight. CC probably does. If there's anyone at this point that has as good of insight as anyone is CC of how the interconnectedness, if any, between Alameda and FTX and how you disentangle that, if possible. And that's, I think, the only thing that can really derail this deal over the next to your point, I don't know how many days, but as you do diligence and you understand that that's the only thing that I think could meaningfully derail this, unfortunately.
00:51:07.430 - 00:51:39.660, Speaker D: Here's my big question. Last year's, SBF was worth like 34, 35 billion. He pledged to put in five or maybe up to 15 billion into the Twitter deal. Like something insane. My understanding was that he had a few billion sitting in his bank account and he could just roll with that whenever. And the 500 million dollar FTT sale was like the death shot. The numbers, or at least the order of magnitude of the numbers just are not matching up.
00:51:39.660 - 00:51:48.522, Speaker D: Yeah, it just doesn't make any sense to me how you could lose all of your customer deposits and not be able to do withdrawals.
00:51:48.586 - 00:52:03.970, Speaker B: This is Three Arrows. Yeah. Didn't he back out from like a billion dollar commitment to the Democratic, some candidate of sorts, or the next presidential election? He said he was going to do a billion. He's like, no, I'm just kidding.
00:52:04.550 - 00:52:21.690, Speaker D: I think that was more he just realized he was on the losing side. Just like democratic midterm shit. But what am I missing? How is that a material in a poll where he needs to sell the exchange?
00:52:25.230 - 00:52:36.910, Speaker C: Once again, this is Three Arrows all over again. You would have thought that they had more capital or dough. Everybody is swimming without any pants on right now. And when the tide goes out, no Pants party.
00:52:37.410 - 00:52:38.990, Speaker A: Bunch of naked swimmers.
00:52:40.210 - 00:53:19.240, Speaker B: When I was just going back to this idea of how big this impact will be relative to the other kind of Three Arrows and Luna, the only thing that I'm also thinking about is there are a lot of ecosystem funds that have been funded by FTX that are tied to the hip to FTX. Again, Michael, I do agree with your assessment. It is putting aside the whole withdrawal situation and user funds in FTX, assuming that they're protected, hopefully they are for my own sanity as well, I'll be you know, I'll continue to do Empire. I guess I'll be here.
00:53:19.890 - 00:53:22.414, Speaker C: Wait, you're getting paid for this?
00:53:22.612 - 00:54:15.614, Speaker B: No, I don't even get invited to the conference anyways. But it does feel like a lot of investors and funds are probably going to have to foresell they're going to get redemptions. And that obviously has I'm thinking of this impact may not be as acutely felt as perhaps Three Arrows, but it will be very drawn. Like, I think when Three Arrows and Luna happened, I thought the bottom of the market was going to be a billion and I said, okay, it feels to me like that's going to hold up fairly well. And you've been kind of hovering around that. And then I revisited my thesis and I said, no. Just given the magnitude of loss of confidence in the system because a lot of consumers and retail got hurt and the policy implications of that, I said, well, we could probably go lower, like another 2020 5%.
00:54:15.614 - 00:54:30.914, Speaker B: I'm thinking now you're at 900 ish. How low can you go as an industry? And all the funds that are going to have to liquidate for sell, that's going to take a few months, maybe.
00:54:31.032 - 00:54:32.420, Speaker A: A couple of weeks.
00:54:32.870 - 00:54:47.670, Speaker D: I don't think so at all. We had the Come to Jesus talks with some other funds in the summer fall. That was the death blow. This is just like you're literally just beating up a dead body on the ground.
00:54:51.450 - 00:55:37.346, Speaker E: Yeah, maybe the framework that I have for this is like, you know how if you're going to do cuts at a company, if you're going to do riffs, you better just do it once and better do it deep. Because if you got to go back twice, then no one's going to know if you're actually on solid footing or not, and people are going to be worried about their jobs. That kind of feels like this to me because there was kind of like all these implosions, right? And there's this kind of idea. I mean, this is crypto, so it's never 100% on solid footing, right? But we thought, okay, maybe there was going to be minor selling, like for Bitcoin or something like that. Maybe we get like one more scary candle, but that's going to be it. I think this is scary, at least for me, or a little spooky, because it's like Alameda. Regardless of your opinion of them, they sit at the heart of crypto markets.
00:55:37.346 - 00:56:11.730, Speaker E: Right. It's hard to get more connected than Alameda as a firm. So it's just concerning, man. And frankly, it was concerning before they blew up that it was like that this was the level of risk that they were taking in a market like this. It kind of just makes you think, what is everyone else doing? I actually feel kind of a sense of I don't want to get emotional about it, but my emotions are a little spooked. But I mean, it'll be fine, but also just a little frustration. It's like, what were you thinking, dude? What were you thinking? And it makes it long term negative on management.
00:56:12.790 - 00:56:32.330, Speaker B: That's what it is. When you feel you're smart and you're glorified, you believe it, and you start believing it more as people start glorifying you. Crypto markets always come to humble you, and it is just shocking how people don't understand guys, all you need to do is there's this idea of Lindy effect. The longer you survive, the stronger.
00:56:32.990 - 00:56:38.022, Speaker A: You know who looks pretty good right now? Santi coinbase. Coinbase is like if I'm coinbase.
00:56:38.166 - 00:57:13.030, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good point, actually. Shout out to certain exchanges have always made proof. Of reserves. A lot of the US exchanges historically have been fairly untouched and unscathed with all this coinbase kraken both of them to my knowledge certainly Kraken does proof like on chain proof of reserves binance has moved to this model like that's. I think the biggest positive now in all of this obviously DeFi. Michael and Vance to your point I truly believe this. I think it is important as an industry to really make the distinction for especially policymakers.
00:57:13.030 - 00:57:55.880, Speaker B: CFI and DFI are not the same thing and it just underscores the importance of transparent open finance. No one ever knew and I guess it will look really dumb in five years. Like guys, what the hell were you thinking? They were not very forthcoming with their proof of reserves. They never gave us the wallet mean I think you can almost hear a congressman drilling like Sam's like why didn't you ever publish this stuff when other exchanges like Kraken have been doing this forever. I think as an industry we really needed like self police. I've been saying it in the podcast over and over. The biggest risk of this industry is self sabotage and it's incredible how much dumb shit continues to happen in this space.
00:57:59.290 - 00:58:35.246, Speaker C: I totally agree with that. I would say the one caveat is that we have the tools. We are literally in the process of making all this stuff happen. It's just that it hasn't been pronounced yet. This is like a vestige from 2017 2018 era when you had FTX plus Alameda and it just took five years for it to blow up I think who's the biggest loser? Well obviously FTX shareholders once again I think customer funds will probably be okay if this deal goes through and then know and that what like two or three shareholders? This isn't going to be like a massive drawn out blow up.
00:58:35.428 - 00:58:56.120, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't I don't think so. Mean it is just super dumb that people do this but it can get to feel like video game money very easily and once you get to that point you should probably take some size go have a glass of water, maybe dial down the leverage a little bit.
00:58:56.810 - 00:59:26.420, Speaker A: Take a walk around the do more water. I want to move us into the next part of the conversation talking about actually Solana for a second. So when Terra Luna blew up, that killed a whole ecosystem. Sol has basically just been valued at having this perpetual bidder in FTX and Alameda. Now that that goes away, I'm just curious what happens to the soul ecosystem and DeFi on Sol and all these Sol gaming projects. What do you guys think?
00:59:26.950 - 01:00:04.842, Speaker D: There's good builders on Sol. The Jeto guys, the solen guys, some of the D five teams are pretty good games. They're probably getting like 2020 5% of all the games that we see just because they have like a super strong Labs presence and BD team and stuff. Like that. This is all kind of like a function of your token price and how much people respect you. So it's like backwards looking in some degree. Like you build up respect and confidence, but what happened today doesn't help them and they're going to need to find kind of like a new leader or a new vibe or just like a new center of gravity for that ecosystem.
01:00:04.842 - 01:00:47.606, Speaker D: Because the sad part is that if Alameda FTX goes down, whatever, they own 10% of the salon supply and the investors that they had in that round were a bunch of TradFi investors. And if you think they're going to hold, I have another thing to tell you. I don't know, it just feels like that's going to be a pretty depressing place to be for at least the near term. But Solana and that ecosystem I do think has value, but it's just going to have to work through this massive overhang of supply. Why do Michael and I like ethereum? One of the reasons is it's been up 100 x and it's been down 99%. Like three or four times. Anyone who is going to sell has sold.
01:00:47.606 - 01:00:55.580, Speaker D: We have an idea of who the ecosystem is. We know what the movement looks like. You just are not able to have that level of confidence with these other ecosystems right now.
01:00:56.450 - 01:01:35.980, Speaker C: Just to hit on this point and double click into it. One of the things that we evaluate when we're talking about new investments, especially talking about a base layer type investment, for instance, in Solana or any other asset like that, is who holds it and what's the vesting, what's the unlock schedule and how much is left. And to Vance's point, just to double click in, ETH is done unlocking. Right. So that is a huge advantage that you have as a base layer because you don't have this overhang of 10% sitting over you constantly, potentially as a sell. It's just a huge component that frankly could be the unwinding that we're talking about. What's the other shoe to drop? That could be it.
01:01:38.270 - 01:01:56.020, Speaker D: Two things. One good. One probably not as good. Number one, ETH is about to go deflationary. So the promise of this technology is real and it manifests at scale in the data. Number two, I don't know if you've seen the silvergate price today. The stock, it's down almost 20%.
01:01:57.670 - 01:01:58.420, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:00.470 - 01:02:14.258, Speaker D: That is a little concerning. I don't know if there's anything behind it. Maybe it's just like the only stock that these hedge funds can short that's correlated to crypto just because they do a lot of business in crypto. But yeah, certainly not confidence inspiring.
01:02:14.434 - 01:02:16.982, Speaker B: Well, they recently had a management up as well.
01:02:17.036 - 01:02:17.602, Speaker D: Right.
01:02:17.756 - 01:02:21.530, Speaker E: Is Alan still there or no, CEO?
01:02:21.950 - 01:02:23.290, Speaker D: I don't know Alan.
01:02:25.230 - 01:03:08.860, Speaker B: Yeah, neither do I, but I think it was last week that they changed a few of their executive team. Obviously a lot of things know fairly obvious in hindsight. But I think you started to get again some spidey senses. Vance michael, we've been around, we've seen these things play over and over and I think you just develop an instinct in crypto of know, you always assume the worst and if there's any probability of shit going just you want to be there the first one out and not take risks. And then I guess now you look back and you say, well, Sam Trubuco, right, who was the co CEO of Alameda left.
01:03:09.950 - 01:03:11.802, Speaker E: Michael, say the thing you want to say.
01:03:11.936 - 01:03:22.300, Speaker B: A few months ago, what did he know? Right? And then who else left? It was the head of FTX US. Right. The President of FTX us.
01:03:23.330 - 01:03:28.762, Speaker A: One left to go spend more time with family and one left to pursue happiness. So pretty good reasons.
01:03:28.906 - 01:04:02.090, Speaker B: Anyways, look, correlation causation, I'm not implying things, I don't know this stuff. But you almost have to think at some point, did this guy just make a lot of money and wanted to check out and go fishing for a year or what we mentioned earlier in the pod? It feels to me like there are certain people in the industry that knew how precarious the situation was and then you just were kind of waiting and then maybe it was just took one billionaire to piss off another billionaire to say, hey you know what, I've had enough of this crap.
01:04:02.670 - 01:04:27.214, Speaker C: It feels like this will happen literally all of a sudden, like we wake up this morning and boom it's dead. It's possible that this is late in comparison to how everybody else was thinking about it, who had inside information and that everybody else was thinking, okay, this is going to happen maybe over the summer, maybe in the fall. But the fact that it's happening right now, it took a Tweet, it's possible that this has been happening, so to say, for a long time.
01:04:27.412 - 01:04:30.562, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean these things just don't happen in isolation, right?
01:04:30.616 - 01:04:31.122, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:04:31.256 - 01:04:39.102, Speaker B: You don't take down a giant like this just by a Tweet or just by selling 500 million on FTT. That doesn't do it folks.
01:04:39.166 - 01:04:40.962, Speaker C: The Tweet is just final nail.
01:04:41.106 - 01:04:43.810, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just the nail in the coffin.
01:04:43.970 - 01:05:09.406, Speaker A: Guys. How much do you think if finance was seen in a good light by regulators? This feels like game set match for finance. I'm like finance is just they're going to win. But I think the maybe counterargument to that is that they're kind of like this regulatory pariah. I think now after this they own 70% of the spot market, 70% of the derivatives market. They recently launched options. BUSD is going to take off.
01:05:09.406 - 01:05:35.800, Speaker A: Now maybe you could argue this is bearish for proof of stake decentralization, right? This kind of puts more pressure on liquid staking derivatives. Actually exchanges are the largest stakers. We just had two of the largest exchanges merge feels pretty obvious that Binance will probably release their own liquid staking product feels pretty obvious that BUSD usage will like does it just feel like gameset match for binance right here?
01:05:38.170 - 01:05:39.660, Speaker C: They have a lot of way to.
01:05:40.590 - 01:06:31.830, Speaker D: Mean I kind of view the ecosystems as like Coinbase ethereum and then Binance, I do think know, becomes probably the richest person in the world. Him and Elon probably end up tied at some yeah, I mean it's just like a strategic masterstroke. Like the perfectly placed kill shot at the exact right time with the exact right levers. You just do not want to fuck with CZ and I just do not see anybody else really throwing their hat in the ring to do that. So I think the participant set and the long term competitive set of crypto has narrowed. It's coinbase, it's Binance and it's ETH.
01:06:32.730 - 01:06:57.220, Speaker C: So totally agree. Let me pose a different perspective. Not totally. There's sort of two things happening at the same time now. It's just Binance and Coinbase and ETH. Yes. But really Binance and Coinbase in terms of Spot, the biggest size of prize that has yet to happen is derivatives and true actual transactions with all the different types of products in the US.
01:06:57.220 - 01:07:32.480, Speaker C: That is the final shoe that has yet to hit. I think it's going to be Coinbase. If I was to put my bets on something, because I don't know if binance can be regulated at this point. It's kind of too far gone in a lot of ways. Just the jurisdiction hopscotch that they've been playing the launch of BNB. Kind of everything they've been doing, it feels like they're moving the direction of but you know, if Coinbase can get there, there is a chance that Coinbase and the resurgence arc of Coinbase and Brian would be like he would be my best bet to potentially in five years time actually give it a go. With.
01:07:35.170 - 01:08:27.120, Speaker B: Much just touching on one thing here. In terms of sentiment and industry perception, one of the things that is important to understand is FTX has been very visible in the US. And you have obviously a bunch of sponsorships and Sam's presence. Even though assuming again, consumer deposits are not affected and those are restored, how much does this set us back? At least in the both. All of you guys here are in that market. I'm curious, how much do you think that this matters? Does FTX ever recover as a brand name or do people just kind of it never bounces back. And you think of binance us going forward.
01:08:27.890 - 01:08:30.720, Speaker C: Are you going to put assets on Celsius again?
01:08:31.490 - 01:08:32.142, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:08:32.276 - 01:08:33.774, Speaker B: Never have, never will.
01:08:33.972 - 01:08:34.720, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:08:35.270 - 01:08:36.126, Speaker D: Totally.
01:08:36.238 - 01:08:36.900, Speaker A: Just.
01:08:41.830 - 01:09:19.822, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think the exchange literally gets renamed and it becomes like a BlockFi style. This company doesn't exist anymore. It's over on the policy side, I don't think it's that bad. It's going to take some explaining and we're going to have to go to DC and hopefully the midterms go our way. But the nice part about having these you can point to it things is you're basically like, yeah, but that was that guy, and here's why. And here's the other part. The big problem with DC has been a few of them have been like CFI and DeFi being conflated is the same thing.
01:09:19.822 - 01:09:45.080, Speaker D: And that was a story that was told by someone who was in CFI, who wanted to regulate DeFi out of existence, and who wanted all the regulations just to be basically around this CFI concept. Now it's like that CFI concept. Look how far that got you. Here's this other thing, and here's these new rules. So I don't think it's that negative, but we look super dumb right now. That's the problem. We have credibility, but we just need to build it back up.
01:09:46.250 - 01:10:40.122, Speaker E: I don't know if we talked about this on last week's roundup, but I don't know if you guys watched also, like, the Eric Voorhees versus SBF type debate. So we're shameless self plug, but we're moving Das to DC moving forward. And so we've been talking to a whole bunch of regulators and stuff there and might surprise you to like, they all watched that debate and they saw something super different than, I think, what a lot of people in crypto saw. Frankly, like to a letter, if you're sort of crypto and a crypto native, you're like, wow, Eric, did you see that thing about Ave and the email comparison? Like, I really boxed him into a corner. And Sam seemed like he was on the you know, to summarize the other view of how that debate went, it's, wow, that guy was super idealistic, not realistic at all. Wow, you really just don't want to get into a debate with SBF. So I think it's a little bit of a question mark in terms of how the DC apparatus is going to react to this.
01:10:40.122 - 01:11:11.954, Speaker E: Because Sam's basically been, for better or worse, the one who's engaging with that set of stakeholders. So I don't know, I could see it kind of going one of two ways, which know, they're guy was this guy was bad. Even the guy that we thought was good was bad, and this whole industry just sucks. We just don't like this. Or they could look at it like SBF is kind of a martyr and got took down by this. Like the one good regulated guy got took down by a unregulated exchange. And I don't think they think super.
01:11:11.992 - 01:11:51.838, Speaker C: Favorably about, let's be serious, FTX was unregulated, as you know. Sure, they had GAAP audits, but they were an unregulated exchange that did not provide access to US customers. The thing that I would say about what at least our limited experience at DC, which is actually, at this point kind of substantial. What we have seen works is a very logic based argument where you have this and then that, and if you provide a reason for doing something, then it definitely falls on ears that are willing to listen to it. If you have an idealistic perspective, we need to be this new industry. We need to provide financial inclusion. We need to do this or that.
01:11:51.838 - 01:12:36.670, Speaker C: That never really plays in DC. And so when you have the error versus SBF argument, you ultimately have a conversation where, yes, it's like pie in the sky. Wouldn't it be amazing if that type of stuff, which probably resonates with all of us and resonates with entrepreneurs and resonates with the industry, but it's not something that resonates with DC people. It is the logic based discussions that ultimately have the teeth to be able to get something done. So it is a loss, I would say, for the industry, given that we took our DC white knight off the table. But given that, be that as it may, I think we do have to now move in the direction of, okay, what's the logic for DeFi? What's the logic for this or that? And use this as another example where DeFi wins and CFI has to be regulated.
01:12:37.410 - 01:12:51.330, Speaker D: I think, again, Teresa, now super serious, like sending policy people to the Hill like Paradigm formed their policy council and announced it last night. The whole Dccpa stuff is comparable to the infrastructure bill. I forget when that was.
01:12:51.400 - 01:12:56.834, Speaker C: Last November or maybe 2 November 2021, right?
01:12:56.872 - 01:13:32.970, Speaker D: That's when we all got super mad and super pissed. And how could they do this to us? And the Dccpa is like a similar catalyst, but legislation is now right around the corner. It's not like us trying to fight some random inclusion into an omnibus bill. It's like us coming together to draft the legislation, which is going to be the future of this industry. And I think, taking like a thousand foot perspective is that all this stuff sucks. That legislation is the only thing that matters. Not having SBF in the room, probably a positive on balance, having Andreessen Paradigm, whoever else there fighting for DeFi, that's super positive.
01:13:33.130 - 01:14:28.610, Speaker B: I think that's spot on. Vance it started to feel like, you know, for better for us, had a lot of influence. And we both here believe in the power of DeFi. And he had a clear interest in vilifying DeFi to some extent, because he's a CFI guy and he has interest in CFI. And it's not just him. For a matter of fact, I've heard from other folks and policymakers that exchanges, whether they don't understand or pretend they don't understand DeFi, but they actually sling mud at DeFi because it threatens their business model. And so I think now that we have more space to own the conversation from funds like you mentioned, and other folks that are invested in DeFi because you believe in the power of DeFi and you believe that it actually is the right thing.
01:14:28.610 - 01:14:50.060, Speaker B: And I think maybe this is the positive where we get to reclaim the conversation. And now it's a group of entities that perhaps the most important thing now is to be very coordinated to really control the narrative across the different organizations and lobbying groups that are doing good work. It's just a matter of just really just making sure that the message is very clear.
01:14:51.230 - 01:14:51.980, Speaker D: Yes.
01:14:52.990 - 01:14:54.380, Speaker C: You just nailed it.
01:14:57.870 - 01:15:10.826, Speaker A: So Arthur Hayes tweeted out said FTX equals Lehman. That wasn't the bottom. SPX hit six six six in March of 2009. Therefore 17 five BTC is at risk. How about dem puts now? What's your thought on this, Michael?
01:15:10.938 - 01:15:13.360, Speaker D: Arthur has been wrong all year.
01:15:14.130 - 01:15:16.866, Speaker C: I don't care what Arthur tweets at all.
01:15:16.968 - 01:15:19.182, Speaker A: Yeah, but he's a good writer.
01:15:19.326 - 01:15:20.594, Speaker E: He's a good blogger, though.
01:15:20.632 - 01:15:23.150, Speaker D: I love ten pages.
01:15:23.230 - 01:15:23.742, Speaker C: Congrats.
01:15:23.806 - 01:15:44.410, Speaker D: I'm sorry, but I'm not reading all that. I don't really care what Arthur says. I'm just scrolling through Twitter as I talk. But it seems like the whole is 2 billion, 3 billion. It's not six, I don't think. I don't know why he's trying to raise six. That is like absurd.
01:15:44.410 - 01:16:17.846, Speaker D: If it's two or three that feels more manageable, you can calculate the revenue that FTX has on a yearly basis by backing out of what they burn. And the revenue is probably like a billion to a billion, two or something like that. Probably lower now. Probably like 500 million to a billion. But if you can keep this thing going, which is going to be very difficult now that everyone's withdrawn, you can pay that back. But I don't know, it also feels like all the confidence has been lost at this point.
01:16:17.948 - 01:16:19.240, Speaker A: Michael, what do you think?
01:16:20.330 - 01:16:34.954, Speaker C: So I only read the first half of the tweet in the 2 seconds before I said anything, but FTX equals Lehman I think is accurate. The rest of it is not. I don't think that there's contagion. I don't think that there's a major fallout. We're not like waiting for March 2000.
01:16:34.992 - 01:16:40.478, Speaker A: I think he's insinuating tether he's tether FUDding if I have to read he.
01:16:40.484 - 01:16:46.480, Speaker C: Announced put options last night. Let's talk about talking our book.
01:16:48.850 - 01:17:07.986, Speaker B: Okay, here's a hypothetical, guys. If Terra and at Celsius hadn't happened, 3 hours hadn't happened, would you have seen this bank run on FTX over the last 48 hours?
01:17:08.168 - 01:17:08.900, Speaker C: Yes.
01:17:09.290 - 01:17:10.246, Speaker B: You think so?
01:17:10.348 - 01:17:34.026, Speaker C: The magnitude, I mean, it would have been the exact same thing as Celsius and Three Arrows and that whole thing in June. I think the difference, though is that you would have had ETH at probably, I don't know, 2500. So it'd be a very different story because the wealth effect of the rest of the industry would be larger. So I don't think it would be as disastrous. But this just again, I think a.
01:17:34.048 - 01:18:34.766, Speaker B: Lot of this is when you're running fractional reserve and you have the equity underpinning the confidence in value, then it's at a point where FTX at one point was in a lot of people's minds was like the star of the industry and the gold standard if you will. And now, of course, because these two things have happened, everyone is on edge and these things can happen. And my point is, I think a lot of people are now not taking any chances. And as soon as you felt that this was remotely similar to Celsius or Three Arrow situation, everyone was like, I'm not taking any chances. And so that obviously put a lot of strain on FDX. So back to the conversation. Who else is next and who else is in a very delicate position? That's the only thing that's keeping me off.
01:18:34.766 - 01:18:54.822, Speaker B: I do agree with you. 2 billion, 3 billion, 6 billion, I think is certainly it's manageable. I think at this point, maybe you're like what you said earlier, which is probably fairly accurate, which is like you're shooting a dead body twice now. Everyone's pretty in a bad state, so how bad can it go? But still, I think there are some other players out there that might be in a delicate position.
01:18:54.956 - 01:18:55.974, Speaker C: I mean, to be honest.
01:18:56.012 - 01:18:56.920, Speaker D: Who's left?
01:18:58.510 - 01:18:59.530, Speaker B: Genesis.
01:19:01.070 - 01:19:03.180, Speaker A: Does Genesis make it through all this? Guys?
01:19:06.190 - 01:19:10.620, Speaker D: They got to rename it or something like Genesis or something else.
01:19:10.990 - 01:19:17.550, Speaker A: Definitely don't put Vance and short. They got to do that big rebrand. Change it from Genesis to Genesis.
01:19:18.610 - 01:19:20.126, Speaker D: Change the name, feel like the B.
01:19:20.148 - 01:19:21.390, Speaker E: It's a much more pleasing sounds.
01:19:21.460 - 01:19:25.242, Speaker B: He's a great investor. He's not a marketing guy. That's how you know he's a good investor.
01:19:25.306 - 01:19:27.550, Speaker A: Vance is a meme lord. I know Vance is the Meme lord.
01:19:27.630 - 01:19:38.498, Speaker D: I don't know. I like those guys, but I don't know if they were on the wrong end of this. Again, it's kind of like that's. Three strikes in three months.
01:19:38.664 - 01:19:55.370, Speaker B: Guys, I'm just going to say it. Everyone believed that Three Arrows were the smartest guys. And then you look at their book and you're like, it looked like a retail book. You're looking at Alameda's book and it looks like a retail book. I mean, you can't make this movie.
01:19:57.470 - 01:20:02.330, Speaker C: Kimchi Premium. Kimchi Premium is like buying and selling spot at a premium.
01:20:02.750 - 01:20:40.554, Speaker B: I'll tell you a story. When I first met Sam, he was in Hong Kong and he hadn't even started FTX. And then six months later he wanted built FTX, which is pretty impressive nonetheless, I think in many ways. After my meeting I said, okay, this guy's fairly smart. He's come from Jane Street. And I was wondering I'm not that sophisticated. I'm like smooth brain, but someone like that, if you're like an algo trader, I'm left wondering why isn't his entire desk just leaving Jane Street and doing what he described as fairly simple strategies to make a killing? TradFi is pretty armed out.
01:20:40.554 - 01:20:54.250, Speaker B: Even 14% is like, you're like the best performing hedge fund in the street. You come to crypto and it's a fairly inefficient market still. But yeah, I think to some extent.
01:20:55.150 - 01:21:19.110, Speaker C: Anyway, I will say trading is hard, especially in these markets. So I give them some benefit to that. But there's just a lot of, at certain points in time, a lot of easy ways to make money. And it seems like they took the easy paths at the times when they had them. I don't know what they were doing in the meantime. It could be highly sophisticated, it could be interesting. But I do know for a fact that it is very hard to trade these markets.
01:21:19.530 - 01:21:43.680, Speaker D: Yeah, we did not come from Jane Street. We are smart, but not super, super smart. And when I looked at the Alameda balance sheet, I was expecting to be like T bills and exotic commodity exposure. And it's like, oh shit, they're holding a lot of maps. That's when I knew when the maps exposure was meaningful, it was over.
01:21:47.970 - 01:22:12.162, Speaker E: We can start to kind of wind down here. Love to maybe just get like closing thoughts from each of you. Like take it in whatever direction you want. Like either maybe an angle that we haven't discussed that you think people might be widely missing, like winners and losers, outside of the obvious winner being CZ and the loser being SBF. Just curious. Or even just like closing thoughts just on this whole debacle.
01:22:12.226 - 01:22:55.550, Speaker A: I have one. I have two actually. One is anytime you see someone who just feels like a hero of an industry, like Michael Saylor, was this like doe Kwan like suzu now Sam, it just happens time and time to it's not just crypto by the like industries tend to worship people, especially people who rise really quickly. And it's just like a cautionary tale over and over again. Whenever you see people going front page news, whenever you see people on cover of magazines, sometimes people fly too close to the sun and it's just like, it's a very again, sailor do Kwan like Suzu. We keep seeing it. So it's just a cautionary tale.
01:22:55.550 - 01:24:00.878, Speaker A: That's the first thing. The second thing is I know a lot of found so the reason I thought this was bigger news than Terra Luna, all those blow ups is obviously people got like retail got killed on that and there were some funds that we know that got killed on that. But if you were either kind of like in the Terra ecosystem or you weren't in the Terra ecosystem, a lot of people touch FTX in one way or another. And I know a lot of funds who use FTX, and I know a lot of actually startups, unfortunately, who have put their customer funds who have put like their USDC for example, they raised in USDC, they raised like 8 million a series A, and they've got like 6 million left and they just hold it on like an FTX institutional account. And this is a real fucking bummer. If what happens here, if FTX and Alameda getting offside kill a bunch of great entrepreneurs and startups in the same way that sue and Kyle killed a bunch of great startups because they told startups they would give them 8% on their treasury. So I feel for all the I got messaged by three different founders today who are in that situation, I just feel for those folks.
01:24:00.878 - 01:24:02.300, Speaker A: So that's my take.
01:24:02.910 - 01:24:51.500, Speaker C: I was going to say basically the exact same two things, which is just get reminded of Icarus every single time and time again in crypto and you don't ever want to be so out there and bombastic that you can. Basically what's going to happen with all of the FTX media, all of those billboards, all of those posters everywhere, that's going to feel tough and I think you just got to be careful about being too fast too soon. So that was number one. And number two is I think a lot of this analysis, a lot of the conversation that we've had is highly dependent on what happens to customer funds. Basically all of the analysis goes out the window if we're talking about a loss in customer funds. So that I think is really going to be the next big thing to figure out.
01:24:52.910 - 01:25:51.180, Speaker D: Yes, it sucks, we'll be back. It's not going to be forever, we're just in temporary PR jail and when we're obviously going to help break ourselves out of that. Echo everything Yano and Michael said, I mean the other stuff that comes to mind, like the startups to your point, like Aptos and the really big, really aggressive base layer investments, they like those are all subject to the courts deciding what to do with them. Auctions for selling, I would just be careful around the assets that are still part of their collateral base because those eventually will have some sort of just fight over them, I guess. But yeah, regrettable, we're going to be fine. Life goes on.
01:25:52.510 - 01:26:33.626, Speaker B: Yeah, I would definitely agree with everything that's been said here. Every time you feel like it can't get any worse, well, it has felt like it continues to be, but in many ways it is clearing up. I think one of the most important points that was said here, I think it was you, Vance or Michael. This is from a legacy era of like 2017 where DFI didn't exist. And you're seeing the collapse of all of that. And in many ways you have to go through this process of really just crypto is a very efficient market and I think it exposes things over time. And there are people that are seeing on chain stuff and you're able to exploit it.
01:26:33.626 - 01:27:06.734, Speaker B: I mean, it's a very adversarial environment and I say that in a good way in the sense that a lot of these things that shouldn't exist are ceasing to exist much faster than I would have ever thought. And the positive of all that, again, hopefully it sucks that customer funds are lost. That's the worst thing. And I think that should always be the number one priority and you should. Never play with customer funds, especially in an industry that's super volatile. It doesn't matter if you can move collateral fairly quickly. Just don't play with leverage, kids, not in this industry.
01:27:06.734 - 01:27:29.002, Speaker B: Because what you want to do at this point is surviving. And it doesn't pay to take that kind of risk. It sucks that you're right on the thesis, but wrong on the execution. And the worst thing that you can do. I've learned this the hard way. March 2020 is just playing with leverage. It doesn't allow you to have a clear mind.
01:27:29.002 - 01:28:05.426, Speaker B: Just think about how this industry is going to be and be a builder. Honestly, there's a lot of things that I think to take away. There's a lot of opportunities to get involved in crypto. There's going to be a huge undertaking on controlling the narrative. And we need better people that are not just engineers, but there's a big opportunity for people to step up and help the industry because there's clear gaps, right, in communications, legal accounting, basically every function that it's not just engineers. So this is a good we'll. We'll come out of this stronger.
01:28:05.426 - 01:28:12.774, Speaker B: But yeah, hopefully customer funds are protected and honored.
01:28:12.902 - 01:28:15.450, Speaker A: Yeah. Mike, any last thoughts? Sorry.
01:28:15.520 - 01:28:23.100, Speaker D: One before Mike goes. Genesis just tweeted that they have no exposure to nice. So that's good.
01:28:25.710 - 01:29:06.346, Speaker E: Less than 1% chance or no percent chance? Because that's what people are saying today. I had a thought, actually, just listening to you, Santiago. There there was a Jason you might remember Jason and I, when we were like pre blockworks, really being anything, we were sitting in this I think we even had our full time jobs. We were sitting in this room with this guy who was potentially going to help us or do something, and he gave us a bunch of advice. But one thing I do remember, actually, we were scheming. Like, how are we going to be different from CoinDesk or the other media outlets that exist? And he said, this thing is like, maybe you guys just need to survive and stick it out. And honestly, that ended up being some of the best advice anyone has ever given us when it comes to business in general.
01:29:06.346 - 01:29:37.394, Speaker E: And this is just a marathon, it's not a sprint. And I will say maybe to do one concrete know when you're looking at the exchange landscape, I've always liked Kraken, but I've never really understood necessarily. I was like, where do they play in the ecosystem? Maybe they just survived, man, and they kind of stuck it out. They built this great brand. They did the proof of reserves things before other people did. It hugely beneficial, I think, to the ones that kind of stuck it out. And Kraken basically put themselves in the group that stuck it out.
01:29:37.394 - 01:29:38.466, Speaker E: And I think they'll be big.
01:29:38.488 - 01:29:41.478, Speaker C: Beneficiaries, great point. Great point.
01:29:41.564 - 01:29:55.378, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks everyone. Thanks everyone, for tuning in. If you missed the beginning of this conversation. You can listen to it on empire and bell curve feeds. Just find it in spotify and apple and we will see you guys on the other side. Thank you, folks.
01:29:55.378 - 01:29:56.020, Speaker A: A lot of this.
