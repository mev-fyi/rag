00:00:02.810 - 00:00:31.442, Speaker A: All right, everyone, before we jump into this episode, super excited about our newest sponsor, Reserve. Big shout out to reserve. They are the easiest way to design, deploy and govern stablecoins, backed by a diverse set of assets with access to DeFi, yield and insurance. If you don't know Reserve, we're super excited about them here at Bell Curve. You'll hear more about them later in the show. Welcome to the last episode of season two of Bell Curve, folks. This is the episode where you get to hear Mike and my unfiltered thoughts on the season and these episodes.
00:00:31.442 - 00:00:36.566, Speaker A: So, Mike, you look surprisingly warm for it being negative 40 degrees where you are.
00:00:36.668 - 00:00:55.870, Speaker B: Well, I am inside, but yeah, it is extremely cold in Big Sky. Actually Montana right now. Moved from Bozeman to Big Sky. And yeah, fun fact, they actually won't fly at this temperature because the jet fuel freezes. So that happens at negative 30 degrees. I didn't think that was the threshold that I was necessarily going to cross, but there you go.
00:00:55.940 - 00:01:08.542, Speaker A: I'm trying to remember whose call I was on yesterday, but someone had oh, Sam Martin, who leads our research team, he had gloves on inside because his heat broke. So at least you're not at the gloves on stage.
00:01:08.686 - 00:01:14.814, Speaker B: Devastating. No, you can see these ten beautiful babies here ungloved.
00:01:14.862 - 00:01:20.950, Speaker A: I never need to see your wiggling hands again. So with that, let's get into the finale.
00:01:21.370 - 00:02:22.038, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about the season. I thought this to briefly do a retrospective on the first two seasons that we've done. I think what we concluded going into season one or at the end of season one, which was the advent of DeFi native fixed lending, fixed lend and borrow markets, we thought that that thesis was right, but too early, I think, when doing the retrospective on this past season. And what did we learn about governance? I think it ended up less about being a specific thesis and more of sort of an exploration of a lot of different ideas and narratives that you hear forming around governance. And honestly, I mean, this will be the devil's in the details, but I think I kind of came away believing in some of them more strongly, albeit with a bit more nuance. And ultimately, a lot of the things that you hear are valuable about dows and decentralized governance. I think we did a pretty good job of debunking in this season.
00:02:22.038 - 00:02:25.500, Speaker B: So overall, I think I learned a lot.
00:02:26.110 - 00:02:53.346, Speaker A: Yeah, it felt different from season one. In that season one was really going up against testing this thesis that we had. This really wasn't, I think, because dows and just explorations on governance, it's still so early. This was more of an exploration. At least that's how I realized a couple of episodes in that we were treating it and I found it really interesting. And we went down some pretty weird rabbit holes that I liked. And I'll say I learned some new things, which we should talk about.
00:02:53.346 - 00:02:58.334, Speaker A: And it also confirmed some of the things I was thinking about going into this about Dows.
00:02:58.462 - 00:02:59.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:02:59.992 - 00:03:07.794, Speaker A: Well, how do you want to do this? Do you have any big themes that you want to talk? Any do you want to go like, episode by episode? I'd love to talk about the big themes and some of your takeaways.
00:03:07.922 - 00:03:49.286, Speaker B: I'd like to start with big themes. So just in a really important refresher. And we kicked this entire season off with this idea of product governance fit. And that is the episode that we did with Hasu and Chris. And the idea there being that in addition to the pretty familiar concept of product market fit in crypto, there's an added layer there, which is the governance needs to fit the type of product that you're trying to create. So big takeaway number one from the season is I think that we are generally trying to extrapolate one particular form of decentralized governance to a bunch of protocols that it doesn't necessarily apply to. That's what I think.
00:03:49.286 - 00:04:20.800, Speaker B: I think you probably can root that in. A lot of know we've talked in these episodes about taking ideas from Bitcoin just because Bitcoin was the first, that don't necessarily make sense. Like the fixed token supply cap we talked about in the episode with Chris and Fernando. And I think we sort of borrowed a very similar rule and lesson from Bitcoin governance and ethereum governance, and we're trying to blanket have that apply to basically every crypto protocol. And the answer is, I don't think it.
00:04:24.610 - 00:05:36.646, Speaker A: So the Hasu and Chris episode was such a good episode to set up the season because there were these two big tensions that were outlined in that episode that then persisted throughout the entire season. And it made me realize even in that last episode, talking with Nick from ENS, it was the same tensions that existed that Chris and Hasu brought up on episode one, which was one like governance fit versus maturity of the Dow. Right? Like Bitcoin and ETH can have these kind of slow governance systems because they're super mature and we can't just take those really slow governance systems and replicate them into new startups, right? So there's this governance fit on a maturity timeline or a maturity spectrum. So that was one thing that came through in the entire season, and the next was another theme that was in episode one and in episode seven with Nick, which was public goods versus expectation of return. And that persisted through that's. Probably the biggest thing that I've been thinking about is what form of governance you should have. Should probably be predicated on how deep down in the stack you are and how much of a public good you.
00:05:36.668 - 00:06:19.780, Speaker B: Are in a I think I actually would separate those. I think those are two sort of different ideas. So the one thing that again came from. The Chris Hasu episode was depending on where you are in relation to the Base layer infrastructure of everything that we're building in crypto, probably as a general rule of thumb, the better it is to have decentralized governance. The best two examples that I can point to there are Ethereum and Bitcoin, which are at the very base layer. And that's where you start to get some of these benefits of decentralized governance. This is basically the most compelling pro in the decentralized governance camp, which is if the government decides that they don't like Bitcoin, they can't haul up the CEO of Bitcoin and demand that they stop it.
00:06:19.780 - 00:07:01.938, Speaker B: It's still possible to do, but it's much more difficult to stamp out. And then you can kind of move one layer up and you can look at okay, on top of these very base money protocols or smart contract layers. Then you have one layer above, which is basic financial infrastructure. And that could be your compounds or your Ave that is somewhat more consumer facing, but it's also still very base and foundational to basic financial functions. So you probably don't want something that's necessarily as decentralized as Bitcoin or ETH governance. But you start to kind of layer up and ultimately, at the top of that stack, something that's very consumer facing, that doesn't sit at the very base layer of infrastructure. Something like a game.
00:07:01.938 - 00:07:28.730, Speaker B: I don't know. Games don't need to have super decentralized governance, I don't think. I think it's like you're directing a movie. You need like one person with a vision who can create a world, like Tolkien or James Cameron, even though I heard Avatar Two kind of sucked. But you need one person with a vision who can create that. And it's not ultimately that important because if the game isn't good, the game's not good, it doesn't really matter. Whereas base layer financial infrastructure is deeply important and foundational to how people live their lives.
00:07:28.730 - 00:07:32.350, Speaker B: So I think that was a really important point.
00:07:32.500 - 00:07:49.154, Speaker A: Let me ask you this. Now, having done these seven interviews or seven episodes, why does the Base layer need to be more have that slower governance feature and be a Dow? Is it because is resilience the key thing that you're fighting against there, or.
00:07:49.192 - 00:07:54.446, Speaker B: Fighting I think this is where the Vitalik paper that we also referenced earlier.
00:07:54.478 - 00:07:56.978, Speaker A: In the season, convex versus concave decisions.
00:07:57.074 - 00:08:57.602, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like convex versus concave decisions. I personally think that actually we'll get into this into a second, but the maturity of an organization and then there's censorship resistance, which I think is kind of you ultimately want those things at the base layer of society to be not able to you don't want big centralized powers to be able to corrupt that. And then there's also this idea of credible neutrality as well, which is you want everyone to basically believe that it's operating in a fair way. You don't want the things that you and I need and rely on to be influenced by a small, outsized group of people. So that's why I sort of think that it's kind of like I actually thought this was a really apt analogy. I've never heard anyone talk about, but hasi referenced this when he brought up utility companies because you and I said, well, this doesn't really exist in corporate America, right? And he said, absolutely not. There's different layers of regulation.
00:08:57.602 - 00:09:40.594, Speaker B: You could look at utility companies where utility company, you and I need it, dude. Totally inelastic good, right? Where it doesn't really matter how much power costs. I'm in negative 42 degree temperatures right now. I'm going to pay whatever it is, right? And the government and society writ large has said, yeah, I know that you would pay that, but we don't want you to be able to charge that because ultimately we all want power. We all want to live our lives. So the government literally stepped in and said, you are allowed to invest this much in capex as a utility, and you are allowed to earn this much as a return on that capex, and they regulate that. And I think there's going to be a similar decision that happens around the more base layer infrastructure, and I don't really know how that ends up getting dictated.
00:09:40.594 - 00:09:47.106, Speaker B: I think we all, as a community, have to make a decision for what we think is how do you tie.
00:09:47.138 - 00:09:56.860, Speaker A: Together that thought that you just had, Mike, about the utility companies and not like the utility company there is not maximizing the value that they could kind of pull out of.
00:09:57.470 - 00:09:58.474, Speaker B: Do you?
00:09:58.672 - 00:10:12.334, Speaker A: It reminds me of what Nick said, which is like lower level infrastructure as public goods. And he had that statement, right? He's like, I'm not maximizing value capture for the shareholders because ENS doesn't have any. So how do you mirror those two thoughts together?
00:10:12.532 - 00:11:27.170, Speaker B: Okay, so two big takeaways, just to review, is that we're generalizing a form of governance which applies to a very small subset of protocols, to all protocols, and that's creating tension. Then there's this idea of the way that we think about decentralized governance popularly only applies to those base layer infrastructure type protocols. The next two fundamental tensions that I think came from this series was, one, even in those cases where there's a big premium on Immutability, right? Like a premium on things not changing, that still only applies to mature organizations, whereas the vast majority of protocols and Dows today are immature. So you're trying to apply a form of governance which makes sense at a very late stage of the organization to a very early stage organization. That would be like with Blockworks, when we were six months old, trying to basically adopt the governance of a full scale public company where we have a board of directors and shareholders and they're all weighing in on decisions. And realistically, at that period, of time, you and I were kind of driving a lot of the decisions, and now we're decentralizing decision making. Even in blockworks, that's probably going to be the trend for hopefully blockworks is around for a long time, but that'll be basically the trend.
00:11:27.170 - 00:12:06.386, Speaker B: So there's a big tension in between maturity of organization and the type of governance that people want to use. Second is this idea of public goods. This one, I don't have a great answer for you because the tension there is that everyone likes the idea of a public good. I want these things to just operate in a way that's free and provides a lot of value to me as a potential user. But then most of these public goods have a token and they expect that token to go up. And my point to you just would probably be that I just don't see how those two things are necessarily compatible because the token should go up because returns are being maximized. Right.
00:12:06.386 - 00:12:07.306, Speaker B: For the token holders.
00:12:07.358 - 00:12:27.370, Speaker A: Right. If you think about public goods, like a public park or something, it'd be like having a public park where you have to charge for entry, or like there's a stock associated with the public park. Those are directly at ODS with each other. Or street lighting, like paying for the street light. It's directly at odds.
00:12:27.710 - 00:13:05.782, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So my sort of ultra cynical take on the way public goods are being touted right now is I do think a lot of these things will probably end up being public goods. But people are using, like, we asked Nick this, right? Well, why do you have a token, then? He's like, it's not a particularly good form, it's not a particularly good end state right. For public goods funding. But there was a mania in crypto, and that mania allowed us to fund a bunch of public goods, basically because they issued the token. People didn't question it, they just bought it. But eventually, this is now playing out during the bear market.
00:13:05.782 - 00:13:31.120, Speaker B: Saner heads are going to prevail. More probing questions are going to be asked. Protections are going to be demanded from investors. They're going to want to understand, hey, I'm not buying this because so I have the right to make governance decisions here. There has to be something else that makes me buy this token, and the good protocols will figure that out, and there'll be some sort of balance struck in between returns on the token and public goodness, basically.
00:13:31.650 - 00:14:14.640, Speaker A: You know what that reminds me of is I think it was either Larry or Derek brought this up on the second episode, the reverie episode, which is dao has to figure out who they're optimizing for, right. And a lot of DAOs are optimizing for the wrong point. I think it was maybe larry brought up like, token holders and users are often not the same person, unlike this kind of original mental model that we had of like, why are crypto networks valuable? Oh, because it really aligns the user and the investor, the user and the token holder. That doesn't end up usually being true. So someone like Nick at ENS really has to think about like, are you optimizing for the token price here or are you optimizing for the user and building the best platform?
00:14:18.930 - 00:14:59.866, Speaker B: Also, you know, one of the other things while we're talking about that episode, one of my favorite moments in the entire season was when we quoted from Wikipedia the definition of sabotage. And Derek said that he had actually cut that, printed that out and hung it above his desk at Reverie, which is so funny. And I think one thing that Dows are ultimately going to have to fix is I think people who manage companies kind of know the game that everyone is playing at a high level is just trying to attract and retain talent. And right now Dows seem like they are miserable to work for. The first half of the season, frankly, was pretty negative. We ended on a much more positive note. But man, it was Hasu's quote that.
00:14:59.888 - 00:15:09.534, Speaker A: Summarized the first half of the season. Right? Haste just saying, after working with Maker, I don't want to work with a Dow ever again or I will never work for a Dow ever.
00:15:09.572 - 00:15:41.594, Speaker B: Yeah, because a players want to work with other you want to solve problems. Inevitably some level of politics is going to happen at every organization, but you don't want to spend the majority of your time navigating internal politics as opposed to solving real problems. So Dows are ultimately going to have to fix that. And I did unfortunately have a takeaway this season where I was like, man, I don't really know how much I would want to throw my hat in the ring for a lot of these Dows, but I think there's definitely light at the end of the tunnel. There's a lot of potential for some of these.
00:15:41.712 - 00:16:09.650, Speaker A: Yeah. What did you think of? Okay, so episode three, it was Mika and Treyas. I was not on that episode, but there was one thing when I listened to it about like dowser and extension of social networks, that thought made me think of what Jules brought up about trust layer versus social. That because that was the one episode I wasn't a part of with Mika and Treya. So I'm curious if you had any takeaways from that episode.
00:16:11.750 - 00:17:00.466, Speaker B: The basically, I think that episode sort of confirmed a sort of mental model that I had for Dows, which is one of the reason, even though I understand there are so many problems with them, I'm still very bullish. It's kind of the dows are sort of the continuation of this trend that's already been happening for a long period of time where you have global workforces as opposed to localized workforces. You have to be honest, there are pros and cons to this, but relationship between employers, employees that feel much more transactional as opposed to long term relationship based. My grandpa worked for Warlitzer from the day he graduated high school. Then they gave him a gold watch or whatever at 50 years, and then he retired from that company. I mean, that is a completely antiquated concept and I think Dows are just the most logical extension of that. Right.
00:17:00.466 - 00:17:37.200, Speaker B: It's even one more from Gig work. And then the other thing is, frankly, that COVID shown pretty harsh relief on is that there's going to be some hybrid going to the future of in person versus not in person. And I think Dows are kind of optimized for that. So I sort of came away from that episode thinking that Dows are the logical extension of a trend that's already happened anyways. And there's a lot of stuff that needs to be worked out in the interim and some pretty core foundational concepts need to get questioned. But.
00:17:38.930 - 00:18:25.120, Speaker A: Dows are an extension of what's already happening in the sense that the world's already going global, going remote, going the one thing that where Dows maybe do something too soon there. So I agree with that. That's a good take, is like Jules brought up trustwear versus socialware. And one thing DAOs do is they try to codify everything really early on and oftentimes because it's a bunch of engineers, right? And engineers famously try to codify everything very early. And I don't think you can do that. Again, when you think about blockworks, if we try to codify things that were working in 2018, by 2019 we would had to blow the place up. And if we try to codify what happened in 2020, that wouldn't work today.
00:18:25.650 - 00:19:17.882, Speaker B: Yeah, it's so funny. One of our mutual friends who works pretty closely on Lido, I remember him describing this to me about six months ago, this idea that you're going to ossify certain parts of that protocol and that was going to be a huge advantage to something that you couldn't do in the real world. I remember thinking that's a negative. Yeah, it is a negative. But at the same time, in these last couple of weeks I don't want to make this about something that is not, but I've been watching what Elon's been doing with Twitter, and to see it get proposed that Twitter. Was going to limit the mentions of other social platforms. It was like, that is such a radical departure from the promise that Twitter made to its early users that I actually kind of do think putting something like that in stone could actually be an enormous benefit.
00:19:17.882 - 00:19:26.370, Speaker B: You literally can't do that in any other that's interesting. Yeah, I sort of am looking I don't think so.
00:19:26.440 - 00:19:37.458, Speaker A: I think decisions like that end up that decision is going to get reversed because Twitter will just really quickly realize that that was a bad decision and they'll just reverse. Yeah.
00:19:37.544 - 00:20:05.618, Speaker B: I've got another one for you. So Google, take a look at Google, the product as it exists today. Unbelievable money printing machine, right? It's hard to really pick too many problems with that product. I, for a long time have started to feel like google doesn't do a particularly good job for me anymore. Like, when I Google something, I basically get six ads right in the form of AdWords at the top. And then I just get a bunch of SEO optimized blog posts. And for a while I've been feeling like, actually I get a much better ironic.
00:20:05.618 - 00:20:28.866, Speaker B: I know I just picked on Twitter, but I get a lot better. I've started to search things on Twitter because I get better answers than I do on Google. I started to sort of find Google. It's helpful for using websites, but it had departed from originally. The way it successfully competed against Yahoo. Is Yahoo. Wanted to be the Internet, and Google said, no, we actually just want to direct you to where you want to go on the internet.
00:20:28.866 - 00:20:56.042, Speaker B: And ultimately Google outcompeted Yahoo. But then it became yahoo. In a like, you can see it with those, you know, when you click the first couple things, you're not actually going off Google the platform, you're staying on Google. And I don't know if there are ways that where they could have ossified some of the core tenets of their promise. Yeah, they would have had to find alternative ways to monetize. I bet they probably could have figured that out. It's hard to counterfactuals here.
00:20:56.096 - 00:21:38.570, Speaker A: I disagree. I disagree. Okay, so you're talking about okay, so now on Google, it's a crappy experience because they've got like five sponsored things that pop up. Yeah, it's not that the I think A, you're in the severe minority that you go to somewhere like like most people don't go to Twitter. The other thing is it's just so much easier to use than searching on Twitter. If at some point that experience gets worse to use Google than something else, google will change that. So it's just letting the free market mean this is like this overhyped thing at this point already.
00:21:38.570 - 00:21:49.150, Speaker A: Like chat GBT. I feel like everyone's talking about it. Obviously. That's the first I've searched on Twitter. I use Reddit all the time for search. Actually. I love reddit for search.
00:21:49.150 - 00:22:11.430, Speaker A: It's still much craftier than Google, though. Chat GBT was the first time you get like, one really concise answer. Google will launch a Chat GBT thing in 2023, I'm sure of it, because it's just a better product than Google. So you let the free market decide, just like Twitter is going to let the free market decide about their bad decision.
00:22:11.850 - 00:22:12.600, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:13.770 - 00:22:23.706, Speaker A: It just scares me having built not a big, huge company, but like, it just scares me to put anything in stone that early on.
00:22:23.808 - 00:23:04.802, Speaker B: I hear you, but honestly, let's be a little critical and be like, okay, is there anything that I would feel ossifying, that I would be comfortable ossifying to the promises that we made to our customers. I actually have one I would ossify in if this were possible to do that. We're going to continue to put out good content. That's a promise that we're going to keep to the people that keep consuming blockworks stuff. I would go and just promise that because if we broke that promise, I don't know, I think it would be such a different company at that point. Then I think that's a foundational sort of thing. So that's something that I would actually feel comfortable.
00:23:04.802 - 00:24:30.850, Speaker B: I'd put my stake in the ground and I'd say, yeah, we are going to continue to crank out good content. Would I promise our business model is going to stay the same? I'm not going to promise our business model where I promise that a certain amount of revenue is going to come from here. Would I even promise that we're going to continue to do events? I know my heart of hearts I will always do Pod, but would I promise the continuation of any specific product line? No, I wouldn't. But I could promise good content creation and I actually so to your point about Google, google, it doesn't seem like they're at risk right now, but as a user of Google, I've seen the quality of their product degrade it's because they have a monopoly and they're probably being extractive with that monopoly at this point. So I guess we'll have to check back in ten years to see if they're still top dog and still winning, or if ultimately there's been someone assumes the promise that Google broke, which was, I'm going to help users, people find information in the best way that they want to find it, where I don't feel like Google is doing that anymore. But let's move past this and talk about because this sort of also does get into Jules's discussion about trustwear versus socialware. And again, this kind of plays at that maturity versus an immature versus a mature company and immature companies like startups it makes sense to use socialware to bootstrap which is you have a couple of people at the top.
00:24:30.850 - 00:25:13.200, Speaker B: And you have all these social contracts and promises that you use to build trust in the beginning and get people rowing in the same direction. And that's the quickest, easiest way to do it, that it makes sense in the beginning over periods of time that should be more sort of set and it should be harder to break those promises and that's what trust where ultimately is. I think as she was describing it and the example that she used was the governor contract right for voting. So you sort of enshrine this sense of decentralization and this idea that you'll have a right in governance and that's something that you can't break. That's not a social thing that's coded in. So I thought that was a really interesting idea.
00:25:17.730 - 00:25:26.740, Speaker A: Did we talk about multi sigs on that podcast? Would you say that a multi SIG is a trustwear or socialware? Probably.
00:25:28.070 - 00:25:35.350, Speaker B: I don't think we discussed it, but I'd probably put that more into trustwear. I think that's a pretty good example. Like Nosisafe and what they do.
00:25:35.420 - 00:25:41.642, Speaker A: You ever tried wrangling people, though, to sign a multi SIG? Because that's trustworth. That's so sure. Anyway.
00:25:41.696 - 00:26:07.058, Speaker B: That's so sure. Let's talk about one of the other big conclusions. This was something that I actually, frankly came into the season thinking. I exited the season thinking totally opposite. I've changed my view over the course of the season, which is the value of community. We asked a couple of different people this, and I think it was Jules, who actually came out with her flaming hot take, said, community is bullshit. Community.
00:26:07.058 - 00:26:14.500, Speaker B: The meme of community is flaming hot take. But, yeah, she said it was BS. What did you think about that?
00:26:15.910 - 00:26:44.410, Speaker A: I said it on the show. I was like, I agree that community is bullshit, but I think that there's something deeper than everyone says they want to build a community. This was when I went on that little rant about, like, I think communities are a dime a dozen these days. Whereas communities used to be, like, part of one or two communities. Right. Used to be part of like I won't get into examples of old school communities because I think you made fun of me when I said your softball league and your church. You weren't happy with me with those examples.
00:26:45.010 - 00:26:50.462, Speaker B: Just funny that those are the first two that popped into your head. Sorry, continue.
00:26:50.596 - 00:27:19.580, Speaker A: Yeah, but now people used to be part of two social communities. Now people jump from a community. They're part of three communities on a Sunday, and by the next Saturday they're part of like, six other communities and they drop the other ones. Right. Because when the going gets tough, the tough get going with communities. I would agree with Jules in that sense. Where I do think that it's really valuable is when you can somehow figure out how to build a cult around your brand, which is like one layer deeper than community.
00:27:19.580 - 00:27:40.720, Speaker A: Because that's when you basically have this diehard cohort of people who rally around your brand just because they love your brand. And I think the only way to do that is when your brand represents a bigger idea that's outside of your brand. So that's what I think about community.
00:27:41.090 - 00:28:21.046, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think basically the problem with community for me is it's not a defined stakeholder. And what I mean by that is, like, if you think about what the different sets of stakeholders are in corporate governance, very clear, well understood relationships. There are the shareholders, which are there the principals, they're the owners of the company. There are managers, and they're supposed to operate the company on behalf of the shareholders. And then there's. The board of directors which sort of sits in between and is supposed to look out and interface and make important decisions for the managers on behalf of the shareholders.
00:28:21.046 - 00:29:08.460, Speaker B: And I just don't understand where community fits into that. Like what are their responsibilities, right? What are they supposed to get and what are they supposed to give in return? It's just this weird nebulous mob that you sort of make yourself accountable to for some reason and it's unclear what you really get in exchange. And I think that's my problem with them. Where I would maybe quibble with you a little bit on the cults thing is, I don't know, I sort of think about communities. Cults have reflexivity, right? Bitcoin reflexive, tesla reflexive. It's we're like playing this experiment out in real time, right? Like how good that is over a very long period of time. I will say to maybe counterpoint my own point there, apple's got a cult and they've been very long lasting and that's been great for them.
00:29:08.460 - 00:30:20.946, Speaker B: The other way that I sort of think about community though and this is where I want to transition to talking to yield farming and incentives. We had a really great conversation with Fernando and Chris about this. But the thing about community that I think would be really powerful and I can't tell if I'm just looking at something that's way too small of a use case, but I'll give you the example of people that have created forums for Excel tricks, right? So the Microsoft Office suite is probably the best, most profitable software product in the history of business, maybe rivaling Bloomberg's product and probably better. And one of the big challenges of selling this software is Excel PowerPoint. Those are difficult, right? So Microsoft could have tried to do a bunch of trainings and I'm sure they probably did that bootstrap that in the early days. But what they did sort of do was there's this online community, if you Google like how to do this thing in Lot you get an enormous amount of responses, right, from just this grassroots community of people who are there are these forums and there are even competitions and I think Microsoft sort of encourages this. There's actually an Excel competition every year, which is pretty but so I think Microsoft kind of encourages it.
00:30:20.946 - 00:30:38.300, Speaker B: But really it's this grassroots community thing which saves them an enormous amount of cost and complexity and that I feel like if you were able to combine that with token incentives in some way that would be extremely powerful. But no one's really cracked that nut. So I don't know, that's what I think about community.
00:30:39.310 - 00:31:16.770, Speaker A: You want to hear something interesting about that Microsoft strategy though? Yeah. They are changing their strategy and it was a good example but they are buying up or launching their own. They're either buying up or building their own for communities. So for example, there are Microsoft conferences all over the world like big group gatherings of like 10,000 people where it's a bunch of Microsoft power users. They are now telling those groups we're going to launch those conference businesses, we're going to launch our own Microsoft events or just sell to same with the Excel groups.
00:31:17.830 - 00:32:00.846, Speaker B: I think that is short sighted. I understand why they're doing that. I think it's a poor decision. I just think it's a bad decision. Like you and I have talked, I mean, one of the successful things that you can see happen in real time around like Ethereum as a community, for instance, and Bitcoin, it has spawned and indirectly created and encouraged these strong media evangelists, right, in the form of podcasts or Twitter people or whatever. And it carries more weight because, you know, as a consumer of that information, that these people just love this product or this community or this idea or this set of values and this ethos that align with ethereum or bitcoin. And to have that directly come, I think, from Microsoft.
00:32:00.846 - 00:32:13.734, Speaker B: And this totally waters down the messaging and the heft and power of it. I just think as a poor decision, I think short term good because I get it, they're like vertically integrating, but long term bad in my opinion.
00:32:13.852 - 00:32:50.258, Speaker A: By the way, first brand that I think is going to have this cult following in crypto is Lens. Lens protocol, not financial advice. No, I don't own lens or anything. I think they represent a bigger idea than just something in Crypto, which I think, and honestly, I used Lens. I do like the team. It's a really annoying experience. It was like not nearly as good as using Web two social, but they have this cult following of thousands of people who are going to push this thing into work.
00:32:50.424 - 00:33:44.766, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. All right, let's talk about the big conclusion from the Chris Berninski Fernando episode was there was an enormous amount there, but we were just talking about community and we talked about yield farming because yield farming is one of the things that it was a mechanism for getting tokens out into the hands of people. It also, I think, ended up being a mechanism that encouraged some form of equity financing. Tokens could bootstrap the growth right of the protocol by giving out tokens equity in the protocol. And yeah, it was a very powerful growth mechanism. There are enormous problems with that. There was mercenary liquidity where people would just take the tokens, say thanks very much and dump them and then remove their liquidity.
00:33:44.766 - 00:34:20.190, Speaker B: So it ended up not really doing that much good for the protocols. And then also, if you think about it, they're just handing out tokens to people that are going to dump them on the open market. So there's consistent sell pressure on those tokens. It's just a nightmare. So they're reworking that. Chris laid out what I've heard other people on Twitter refer to as governance farming but basically that really what people wanted before was liquidity bootstrapping liquidity. Now the much more important thing for these protocols is actually people, right, getting labor, actually to contribute to these protocols as opposed to just capital.
00:34:20.190 - 00:34:48.802, Speaker B: I had some thoughts on that. I mean, we talked about it on the episode, but yeah, keep going. I'm really divided on that because I deeply believe in it, but I see an enormous amount of problems. The problem being yield farming, for all the flak that it got, was very simple and capital is very fungible. It had the advantage that capital is fungible. So when you're trying to attract capital, all capital is equal. When you are out there just trying to attract labor, labor is not equal.
00:34:48.802 - 00:35:26.622, Speaker B: It has to be compensated very differently and you have to underwrite that later. Labor, that's what companies do. And you need an enormous infrastructure to underwrite that labor to the point where it becomes effective. So that's my question. And what I start to see forming is Dows are basically at the stage where they're like, hey, we've got these grants protocols and we've got delegate, but people aren't making very good decisions. We need a more professionalized set of delegates and they're going to be like, we need more professional type of labor. And I just see that as this weird mix of consulting, professional service businesses and guilds.
00:35:26.622 - 00:35:45.340, Speaker B: And I'm not really sure what that end state looks like if you really play that out very forward because then it's like everyone's working basically for a glorified temp agency that's tempting them out into these protocols. And I don't know, I'm just putting myself in the shoes of someone who's doing that and I'm like, what fuck, does anyone want to do this?
00:35:46.830 - 00:35:58.480, Speaker A: The most talented people won't want to do that because I think the most talented people get passionate about building something, like being a part of something big, not going and doing a twelve week consulting project.
00:35:59.330 - 00:36:19.666, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, jeez, you do see that, right? It's kind of in the zeitgeist of like, hey, I want to contribute to multiple different projects and I want to consult around and have my flexibility and be able to travel. So maybe it's not like but maybe it just ends up carving off a big portion of society where there are actually these people who are willing to.
00:36:19.688 - 00:36:21.078, Speaker A: Make that trade off, right?
00:36:21.244 - 00:36:39.674, Speaker B: Because you don't really build much equity value doing that, unless I guess you did tokens and you don't have that sense of like, I'm taking something from zero to X, but maybe you're willing to accept that as a trade off. And really what we get is these sets of guilds of professionalized labor and they're the ones that play it out though.
00:36:39.792 - 00:37:09.234, Speaker A: Play that out, okay. Someone does a twelve week consulting project for someone and it goes super well. What do you try to do if you are the person hiring that person, you try to hire them full time and that's like let's use Hasu as an example. Hasu kind of bounced around, did some work with like three protocols or DAOs Maker, Lido and Flashbots, and then had a huge impact on Flashbots, really like working with that team. So now he's basically like full time at Flashbots. Now.
00:37:09.272 - 00:37:13.878, Speaker B: I'm watching what's happening and what people are saying and there are many things that frankly I see happening that I.
00:37:13.884 - 00:37:16.070, Speaker A: Don'T necessarily agree with.
00:37:16.140 - 00:38:25.582, Speaker B: There was just a couple more things I wanted to conclude on the Chris and Fernando episode and then we can leave know he was talking about insider rounds. Like insider rounds and the ability to one of the craziest things remember we used to talk about this at one point, which in retrospect was a screaming mark of the top was anyone can get capital. Capital is meaningless. Remember people used to say this not twelve months ago, right? And instead it's all about differentiation, XYZ and people, if you view capital as meaningless, then VCs are basically predatory in that paradigm. Whereas right now what people don't see is during a bear market when valuations collapse and no one wants to spend, VCs fund the companies so that they can keep going. And Chris's point was like, hey guys, those same people basically who are yelling that VCs don't add any value and are predatory are the same ones not buying right now and are at the top next time. Yeah, and he made the point that it's cheaper to buy on the public market right now for tokens than it is to do like traditional VC for crypto companies.
00:38:25.716 - 00:38:26.400, Speaker A: Right?
00:38:27.570 - 00:38:36.658, Speaker B: I kind of agreed with him on that. I was like, that's a super fair valid point. And I say there's a non VC funded company, but I still see the value for sure.
00:38:36.744 - 00:38:38.900, Speaker A: You just say there's someone who's buying the bottom.
00:38:39.350 - 00:39:09.302, Speaker B: Buying the bottom, baby. Buying the bottom. Last point. Maybe this is a good point to even just end on for the wrap up is I had actually dropped for this, but basically the value of just sticking around because you and I got this advice early on from someone that we didn't end up working with. But it was really good advice and it was maybe you guys just have to stick around and make it. And damn if that didn't end up being the best advice we've gotten from ever gotten.
00:39:09.366 - 00:39:14.298, Speaker A: It's funny, chris said it, then I said it and then Fernando's like, yep, I got the same advice.
00:39:14.474 - 00:39:15.550, Speaker B: Just stick it out.
00:39:15.620 - 00:39:39.718, Speaker A: Stick it. That is, that that is the big takeaway though with DAOs, what we see right now with DAOs treasury Management, we didn't even talk about Tarune's episode. Treasury management, the governance systems that exist. This isn't how it's going to look in a couple of years, but you just got to survive as a protocol, play around with governance, figure out what works, what doesn't work, lean into the stuff that works, chop the bad stuff pretty quickly, move on.
00:39:39.884 - 00:40:08.618, Speaker B: This is V one. I totally agree. I actually left the season. I'm really glad we ended on the episode with Nick because it left me feeling just overwhelmingly positive I think. And it really was it was pulling teeth to get anyone get anything nice to say. But even for people who I know believe in this stuff deeply. But the end of the season with Nick and yeah, I guess it maybe makes sense to give you a little bit of a teaser for the next season.
00:40:08.714 - 00:40:18.130, Speaker A: Well let me ask one last question on Dows and then let's talk about the next season. More or less optimistic on Dows going after this season.
00:40:28.230 - 00:41:24.630, Speaker B: More optimistic but I think almost doing a lot of research and having these conversations and talking to these people. You know how sometimes when you get closer to the problem it made you like whoa, I understand this problem a lot more and there's more to be worried about. I think I sort of feel a little bit like that and maybe I'll focus that in one very specific lens which is it has definitely changed how I look at the short term prospects of uni the token as an investment because I don't mean to pick on uniswap. I think this applies to a lot of frankly the DApps that are out there right now. We didn't really talk about the regulatory component at all but I don't want to get into this point here but it sort of made me feel differently about those as an investment opportunity, frankly. Could be dead wrong about this but I think there are some short term headwinds for that to figure out in terms of the ultimate future of Dows. It made me feel super positive.
00:41:25.850 - 00:41:34.982, Speaker A: I would agree with that. I think that's a good takeaway. So fun season. Next season is going to be really fun. Want to give folks preview?
00:41:35.126 - 00:41:48.366, Speaker B: I do want to give folks so first of all just a preview. We're actually experimenting with guest hosts for specific seasons. Basically this is Jason's very polite way of saying dude, I've had way more than enough of you.
00:41:48.468 - 00:41:54.046, Speaker A: This is Mike's way of kicking me off the politely like dude, I talk.
00:41:54.068 - 00:42:18.534, Speaker B: To you all the time. This is a step too far. But we're bringing on a guest host. And actually, I don't want to announce this person's name because I don't have the final confirmation on it yet. But it would be great, because not only is he super knowledgeable about the topic. He's also one of Jason, my best friends from college, actually, that ended up getting into this space and is now extremely deep in the weeds. But really intelligent and there's just no one that I'd rather be.
00:42:18.534 - 00:43:02.680, Speaker B: Exploring this thesis with which is basically we're going to be digging all into the Appchain's thesis. And Appchain thesis sort of starts obviously we're going to be spending a lot of time talking about cosmos in general. But the Appchain thesis is actually bigger than I think just Cosmos. They're just kind of leading at the vanguard of it. But we're going to be talking basically about really what we want to talk about is how blockchains scale, what is the business model that underlines blockchains, how are blockchains going to scale, and what is the interaction ultimately going to be in between some of the dominant L1s today? And I think it hasn't fully been formatted yet, but I think exploring the relationship in between, specifically Cosmos and ETH as ecosystems is going to play a big part in the coming season. So it's going to be super interesting.
00:43:03.210 - 00:43:37.694, Speaker A: Super interesting. It will be super duper. Super duper interesting. Yeah, actually, just if mike, I saw you sent out this tweet and I've been digging into the App. I know you kicked me off as the co host, but you had that nice tweet about resources for Appchains. So if folks have pieces that they've read or ideas or questions that you want us to dig into in the next season related to Appchains, go find Mike's tweet and comment on that. Also, I just want to say this has been such a fun season, but this would not be possible if it weren't for the sponsors.
00:43:37.694 - 00:44:16.414, Speaker A: And I know people always give the sponsors a big plug at the end or at the beginning, but I really, genuinely it's been awesome having Reserve and Avalanche underwrite this show. This is a podcast, so obviously it's free, but this would not be free, and we wouldn't even be doing this if it weren't for the sponsors and they made all this content possible. So just a huge amount of respect and love to Avalanche and Reserve for supporting this. And if you guys haven't checked them out, if you weren't enticed by our enticing ads already, you should definitely go check out Reserve and Avalanche because, yeah, they've been building some really cool stuff this year. Totally agree. Yeah. Awesome, guys.
00:44:16.414 - 00:44:23.790, Speaker A: Well, this has again been a fun season. Thanks again to Avalanche and Reserve and yeah, we'll take a couple of weeks off and see you on the other side.
00:44:23.940 - 00:44:24.540, Speaker B: Cheers, guys.
