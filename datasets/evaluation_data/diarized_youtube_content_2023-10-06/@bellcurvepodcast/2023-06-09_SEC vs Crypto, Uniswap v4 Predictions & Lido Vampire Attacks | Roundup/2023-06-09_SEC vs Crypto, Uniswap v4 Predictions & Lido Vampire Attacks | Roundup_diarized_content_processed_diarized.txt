00:00:26.650 - 00:00:32.840, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. We got Michael's one and two. Vance, welcome.
00:00:33.290 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker C: What's up?
00:00:33.932 - 00:00:34.502, Speaker A: Thank you, sir.
00:00:34.556 - 00:00:35.560, Speaker C: Good to be here.
00:00:36.570 - 00:00:52.400, Speaker B: Been a slow week. Slow week in crypto land. Busy for DC. Vance, I think we owe you a congratulations. Congratulations in order. Yeah, we got the shout out from VCs congratulating themselves.
00:00:54.610 - 00:00:55.920, Speaker C: I'm a two time.
00:01:01.170 - 00:01:02.382, Speaker A: Big. If true.
00:01:02.516 - 00:01:05.620, Speaker C: That's great. No, but good.
00:01:06.790 - 00:01:08.370, Speaker D: Voracious reader.
00:01:10.470 - 00:01:11.940, Speaker A: How have your readings been?
00:01:14.230 - 00:01:22.262, Speaker C: Bought it. I bought one other book and I thought it was a normal book. It's a fucking textbook. It's like a thousand pages that just showed up. I was like, I can't read this. This is too far.
00:01:22.396 - 00:01:25.638, Speaker B: Was it the Dahlio? The New World Order book?
00:01:25.804 - 00:01:37.546, Speaker C: No, it's a hundred years of investment returns. It's called the triumph of optimus. It's got like, all these charts. It's a lot. Maybe it's too much, but I'm going to start digging into it at some point.
00:01:37.648 - 00:01:43.280, Speaker A: Did you learn that every hedge fund, if you've given long enough time, eventually blows up?
00:01:44.130 - 00:02:01.250, Speaker C: Yeah. That is pretty undeniable. That and being bullish is usually a winning strategy. I think those are kind of the two lessons, especially if you read the long dated takes on finance, like The Price of Time or Triumph of the Optimist.
00:02:02.710 - 00:02:13.990, Speaker B: I agree with Heard, even like Stan Druckenmiller, who I think he said he makes his money in a bearish way, but most of the people even like the famous macro bears out there, made their money on longs, not shorts.
00:02:14.810 - 00:02:26.060, Speaker C: Yeah. I don't think I've known anybody in Crypto who's made a career off of shorting. I know a lot of people who've been completely destroyed by, you know, have anecdotes there as well.
00:02:26.830 - 00:03:06.642, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, you want to get into the stories of the week here? So obviously, I guess the caveat here would be that these have already been sort of talked to death, so I want to spend a relatively limited amount of time on them. But the SEC came after both Binance and Coinbase this week. The TLDRs that the allegations against Binance were, I would say, much more serious than Coinbase. So non exhaustive list for Binance was that so Binance, Bam Management, Bam Trading and CZ were all personally named as defendants in the suit. The allegations are that Binance Bam Trading sold unregistered securities, Binance.com and Gold customer funds.
00:03:06.642 - 00:03:33.046, Speaker B: I'll call back to SBF. Binance operated as an unregistered exchange. There was wasp trading on Binance US. Binance and CZ solicited US customers and whole bunch of other things. Coinbase is what's much more I would say it's completely different actually. And their allegation is that Coinbase operated as an unregistered broker. There were securities, unregistered securities on that exchange.
00:03:33.046 - 00:03:51.480, Speaker B: The one that stood out there was Solana and Matic, but there were others listed like Cardano, Filecoin, sand, and then they specifically targeted their staking program as well. So there's a lot that's been said about this already. But curious just what sort of takeaways you guys had from the week.
00:03:54.090 - 00:04:38.340, Speaker D: Frankly, it's not a super differentiated perspective, but as it relates to both of these lawsuits, I think one of the things that we should keep in context is what's going on with whatever is happening with Ripple. And that started in December of 2020, it's now June of 2023 and there isn't resolution on that. There's been intermediate decisions and intermediate kind of things that have been admissible, things that have been dismissed. But this is going to take years to play out for both of these situations. And in the meantime, Coinbase came out and said, we're not shutting down our staking program, we're not delisting assets, we don't list registered security, unregistered securities. We are compliant. We were compliant when we went public.
00:04:38.340 - 00:05:03.486, Speaker D: All this stuff is going to come up to a fight and it's either going to happen in the court or frankly, it's also going to happen potentially in Congress and there's going to be new laws and new rules created in the meantime. So yeah, not a hugely differentiated approach. I think on the front, frankly, like everybody was wondering where Catherine Coley was. We now know that's the best part.
00:05:03.508 - 00:05:05.280, Speaker A: Of all of this is that Coley's back.
00:05:06.850 - 00:05:40.390, Speaker D: It seems like Brooks and Been have sharing information and you would also kind of assume with the level of the allegations that are happening in the Binance suit, I wouldn't be surprised if there's something from the DOJ at some point, just because it looks and feels a lot like the SBF FTX Alameda stuff. Not saying that a suit means that they're guilty in any way, shape or form, all that stuff has to get adjudicated, but it just feels like that's the direction that things are moving for Binance.
00:05:44.030 - 00:05:50.570, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, I don't really have that much to add there either. I don't think it's widely.
00:05:51.470 - 00:06:06.640, Speaker A: There were two things that were interesting, gensler and the SEC. They were obviously trying to paint finances like FTX 2.0. But if you look at the outflows of finance here, I can pull the chart here, it was pretty business as usual, like normal day.
00:06:08.450 - 00:06:09.114, Speaker D: Right?
00:06:09.252 - 00:06:36.822, Speaker C: I think it's nice we got this out of the way. Also, you had the Wells notice hanging over Coinbase for like six months. Finance has been four years of waiting. I remember Tether in the last bear market. That kind of resolving was one of the points where things got a little bit more optimistic. But there's no alpha, in my opinion, in worrying about this regulatory stuff. It's either a full cycle away so the next bear market is when this might resolve.
00:06:36.822 - 00:06:51.982, Speaker C: But ahead of that, to Michael's point, there's, like, legislation, there's court cases, there's so many different things that could supersede this that who really cares, in my opinion about this. Probably just like traditional media news outlets that are trying to make a narrative out of it.
00:06:52.116 - 00:06:56.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I also think media, mainstream media, man.
00:06:58.930 - 00:06:59.994, Speaker C: Get off here.
00:07:00.132 - 00:07:18.890, Speaker B: I actually think there was a bit of a market signal, which know, it's not like prices really reacted super negatively to this, especially post the Coinbase news. They actually rebounded, and generally I viewed as a positive sign when there's really bad news, but prices don't put in a new low. So I thought that was actually kind of a silver lining.
00:07:19.710 - 00:07:44.282, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, for all of the media consternation from the mainstream, ETH is up just about as much as Nvidia this year, and Nvidia is best performing asset in the of. I get this feeling that perception is just a bit more doomer than reality at the moment. It's good to kind of just take a step back and look at the prices and just see that it hasn't moved.
00:07:44.426 - 00:08:00.182, Speaker D: It's kind of like in scary movies when you have the whole two thirds of the movie where you're chasing around and you're trying to figure out what the monster is and the monster is coming to get you, but then you finally see the monster and you're like, oh, that's just animatronics it is interesting.
00:08:00.236 - 00:08:23.950, Speaker C: If you think about how risk averse coinbase used to be. I forget if back in the day, we were waiting for them to list ETH because it was just like bitcoin and litecoin for a while. They only had, like, three assets. They were super careful. There wasn't a listing framework. It was just know there were two assets, and now it's the total different way, and they're not really as scared seemingly, of the SEC anymore.
00:08:25.410 - 00:08:33.898, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that was sort of an internal fight between bellaji was at Coinbase at the time. He was their CTO, and there was someone else who had more of a Trad Five background.
00:08:33.994 - 00:08:47.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't remember that being a regulatory reason for them. I think that was just like, are we trading bitcoin only or adding stuff? It was May of 2017. No, it was 2016 that they added ETH. It was when they acquired GDAX.
00:08:47.182 - 00:08:48.660, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:08:49.110 - 00:08:50.660, Speaker C: Did they acquire that?
00:08:52.710 - 00:08:58.390, Speaker A: They rebranded Coinbase Exchange to the Global Digital Asset Exchange GDAX.
00:08:58.730 - 00:09:17.070, Speaker D: Well, I think they had their UI was basically like a basic swap, and then they added GDAX for professional traders because I believe that was sort of like a Frederick desired goal because he wanted it to be for more like a trading experience.
00:09:17.220 - 00:09:48.040, Speaker A: Yeah. I have a question for you guys. They're coming out like all the C Five exchanges are getting attacked right now. It makes you think about just the role. Okay, so basically there are three groups in traditional markets that perform different actions, right? You have the exchange which brings together the buyers and the sellers and is the marketplace for the buyers and sellers. Then you have the broker dealers who represent the customer and bring the trades from the customer to the exchange. And then you have the clearinghouse which settles the trades and sometimes is the custodian as well.
00:09:48.040 - 00:10:26.580, Speaker A: In CFI right now there's this kind of weird commingling of like there's no broker dealer because the user has their assets on Coinbase and the settlement is sometimes with Coinbase but sometimes just on the L one like on ETH. It just makes me think about what is the role of CFI in the next market? Is this just a stopping point on the way to the inevitable? Let's translate that to DFI Exchange, Uniswap Broker, MetaMask Clearing Agency, Ethereum and it just makes me think of what is the role of CFI not in the next year or two, but five to ten years from now.
00:10:27.750 - 00:11:27.750, Speaker C: There's a bunch of interesting stuff that's being a bunch of startups that have recently gotten funded that are probably going to be in market in six or twelve months. And the things that we see that are going to kind of take advantage of this change in market structure are bilateral trading desks that are based in New York, kind of to replace the genesis of the world that no longer exists. Places like know places that have access to the CME. And recently, the CME has been seeing a ton of new. So, like, there is interest from the traditional institutions, and they're starting to trade there a bit more in size, and then there's things like payment for order flow, which, frankly, work at an abstraction level closer to retail. Those aren't really like institutional funds trading that's more so just like servicing the order flow from those wallets. But those are coming kind of like just like different participants, lit markets, people with different structures with relating to things like custody and how you trade out of a separated custody account.
00:11:27.750 - 00:12:06.834, Speaker C: That's also coming. There's like a lot of really interesting things that are being shipped right now. And on the other side you have probably a lot of market makers that are also getting bootstrapped and those are going to start replacing the Jane streets and the jumps of the world as they pull back. So it does feel like there is this healthy rotating of the guard but also new technology stepping in to fill the market structure gaps and then you also have just like DeFi running alongside that and getting a different part of the market. So I think it's all pretty positive. I think the things that could change are if there's legislation and that literally changes the market structure. That creates a lot of very interesting new firms that makes ETFs possible.
00:12:06.834 - 00:12:16.390, Speaker C: Places like Bitwise probably get share from that. So there's a lot of just different tailwinds that the space is riding at the moment. I feel like we're pretty positive on it. Michael?
00:12:16.890 - 00:13:23.630, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I was going to jump in on the last point there and say the same thing, which is I think know in the eyes of what has been happening in DC or New York, wherever these suits are being founded. The biggest thing that happened this week was the market structure proposal. And I think the quick TLDR is it provides a lot of black and white playbook for how things like stablecoin should work, for how registrations should work for token projects, how something goes from a security to a sufficiently decentralized commodity. And that market structure will fundamentally change the way that DeFi interacts in the current status, where if you're an insider, a founder, or an investor in a protocol versus a user, you're going to have different designation of the tokens for the first twelve months. You're not going to be able to sell them. If you're an insider, you have to disclose all of the holdings. It'll eventually transition to something that's sufficiently decentralized that will move from trading those assets from an ATS to a CFTC registered and compliant exchange.
00:13:23.630 - 00:14:03.526, Speaker D: The market structure is going to get a lot more complicated as regulation starts to come to the forefront, but I do think it's going to look and feel a lot similar for end users. It's just going to be the venues of where things trade. When is going to change pretty fundamentally. It's not really just going to be like the exchange is uniswap. It's going to be, yeah, sure, maybe eventually uniswap can be an exchange, but for the first twelve months it's going to be one exchange and then after that it's going to be a different one. And if you're based in the US, it's going to be something else. So maybe it's the wallets and the broker dealer designation here that has to figure that part out and route accordingly and manage the customer relationship accordingly and be registered accordingly.
00:14:03.526 - 00:14:08.300, Speaker D: But there's a lot of movement in a very positive direction that we think about.
00:14:08.750 - 00:14:24.938, Speaker C: I'm also curious, what do people think there was a Uniswap for teaser this week or maybe like Easter Egg. What do people think they ship payment for order flow probably like a Suave competitor.
00:14:25.034 - 00:14:38.680, Speaker B: I don't know, something. I think like, that there's a budding debate in the Mev world between sort of application specific order flow auctions versus more generalized order flow auctions like a Suave. And I think Uniswap probably takes some kind of stab at that.
00:14:43.770 - 00:14:45.110, Speaker A: What do you think, Beth?
00:14:45.850 - 00:15:36.950, Speaker C: I think the AMM market is probably good. Like I don't see another innovation in that space. Really like getting them from zero to one in terms of just more market share or just growing the pie overall. I think their problem historically is they've been hamstrung by having to vote through these deployments on these different chains. And it probably works if you can have something that is functional at a level of abstraction over everything so you can kind of service order flow on any chain on any type of block space that exists. So that would definitely be a departure in terms of uniswap is so simple. And that's kind of like where its beauty comes from and why it has a lot of usership, but maybe they kind of take a step in a more aggressive direction with something that's a bit further out there and plays at a different level of abstraction.
00:15:38.330 - 00:16:24.386, Speaker B: I think there are sort of two trends in AMM design that are diverging around maybe Uniswap versus something like Curve that I think is interesting and it kind of has to do with their assumptions around supply side and liquidity. The jump from V two to V three was kind of based on the assumption that you would have more sophisticated market makers. Like it's much harder to be an LP on V three than it was on V two. And we've talked about this on previous shows. I don't have great evidence around this, but from what I've kind of heard, it's very concentrated in terms of who provides liquidity on V three. So I would bet you that their design sort of capitalizes on that in V four and there's some sort of ofa like order flow auction type thing so that you can give a better experience for users. The Curve is almost taking the opposite approach.
00:16:24.386 - 00:16:43.706, Speaker B: They're sort of banking, they've made it easier for retail to be LPs on the new design of their exchange and they're sort of lowering their fees and they're trying to subsidize that with fees from their stablecoin. So it's kind of two very different designs. I'm interested to see how it plays out, frankly.
00:16:43.898 - 00:16:57.374, Speaker C: Yeah, that last playbook you described is only possible in Switzerland. Uniswap is not issuing a stablecoin that they can do different things with the fees, with their design space is a lot more concentrated.
00:16:57.502 - 00:17:01.970, Speaker B: Do you think that's a benefit or an obstacle?
00:17:03.190 - 00:17:27.500, Speaker C: I think the benefits of having a bit more expansive of a playbook where you can do different things with the fees, you can make it more reflexive have blown people up and so there's drawbacks to that that aren't immediately apparent. But I think if you asked Hayden would he like a bit more design space to work with, he would probably say yes. It's just a matter of do you take that and then light yourself on.
00:17:29.150 - 00:18:11.266, Speaker B: Know, it is like you could probably draw that analogy across a couple of different examples in crypto. So in the C fi space there's like the binance versus the coinbase approach, then there's kind of like Aave versus compound and then maybe Curve versus uniswap. And I agree with you. I think it's sort of like we'll see which one of those strategies ultimately ends up. I actually think the Aave versus compound is pretty interesting. I think a lot of people have sort of slept on the new upgrade to compound in general. I know people really like Ave is great, they ship a lot of stuff, but they have very different strategies and it seems like compounds is more like people want to borrow and lend stablecoins so let's make it as capital efficient as possible to borrow and lend stables.
00:18:11.266 - 00:18:22.640, Speaker B: Whereas Ave is like you should be able to supply collateral and borrow lend with anything that you want. And so far that's been the winning strategy but I'm not sure it's going to be into the future.
00:18:23.490 - 00:19:03.370, Speaker D: I would also say I don't think you can't necessarily say that everything is apples to apples in the sense that there are different markets between swapping spot assets, borrowing spot assets and exchanging and doing derivatives and all that. And these are companies and it was just announced today, but Lens is something that they're working on at Aave. There's just a bunch of things that are going on inside of all of that that dictate a lot of the direction of where those things go. So it's not like we're going to take this strategy and we're going to go full bore into this direction versus that strategy in that direction.
00:19:05.710 - 00:19:35.940, Speaker C: I'm stoked for all these stablecoins to get to escape velocity though. I saw this position on DFI Moon, the Twitter account retweeted it where someone had taken, I think it was like seven Steeth and looped it with curve until they had 35 Steeth. In my mind this is where some of the credit is going to come from for the next run. We still haven't seen any recovery of the dollar lending markets in crypto, but these seem to be the next best thing.
00:19:39.100 - 00:20:14.292, Speaker B: I completely agree with that. I think we've talked about it on the show. But one thing that at least I didn't understand in the last bull market was where leverage was getting introduced, which was via grayscale. Just didn't get that sort of loop between the Arbitrage that was being run. Yeah, true. Not just grayscale but yes, true, that was a big part of it. And probably there's some sort of combination of an eigen layer rehypothecation plus the liquid staking tokens reaching escape velocity, which is probably good.
00:20:14.292 - 00:20:17.800, Speaker B: That probably injects a little healthy leverage.
00:20:18.540 - 00:20:59.670, Speaker C: I mean, you can kind of already start to see it, people leaping these things, chasing yields. There's probably market fit for that for better or for worse. I'm just trying to find this chart on the growth of some of this stuff. I'm going to send this to you. This is one of the more interesting charts that I saw over the past. I think this is definitely blockworks analyst sourced your army of interns, but this is super interesting. If you want to throw it up in this.
00:21:00.440 - 00:21:01.652, Speaker B: Yeah, I got it.
00:21:01.786 - 00:21:38.130, Speaker C: But this is a chart of wrapped ETH versus LSTs, and I didn't know that wrapped ETH was this prevalent, but at one point, almost 7% of the supply of ETH was in wrapped ETH. And you just see that kink from 7% down to 3% contrasted with the kink up on the LSTs. There's 3% more of ETH just sitting on chain. That will probably stake at some point, and it'll probably be LSTs as well. It's going to be huge.
00:21:38.820 - 00:21:56.470, Speaker D: The key point here is that we wrapped ETH is what was technically used for most of DFI because you had to wrap it to be able to put it into smart contracts to be able to use as collateral or whenever it may be. So it's basically like DFI 1.0 versus what you could probably say is DFI 2.0.
00:21:58.360 - 00:21:58.736, Speaker A: Wait.
00:21:58.778 - 00:21:59.224, Speaker B: Say that again.
00:21:59.262 - 00:22:01.050, Speaker A: Michael. Say that last sentence again.
00:22:01.740 - 00:22:06.196, Speaker D: DFI 1.0 would be wrapped ETH on this chart. D 5.0 would be LSDs.
00:22:06.228 - 00:22:13.470, Speaker A: LSTs. Yeah, I agree. I mean, it seems pretty obvious at this point LSTs are just going to continue to grow as a replacement to.
00:22:13.840 - 00:22:17.356, Speaker B: ETH and weath why would you?
00:22:17.538 - 00:22:21.176, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. Sort of like, okay, here's an asset.
00:22:21.208 - 00:22:35.092, Speaker A: That you can use collateral. I feel like we've already talked about this a little bit, but I'm curious if you both I mean, we talked about this last time a little, but will we see a hard cap or like some sort of tax proposed on lido's market share? Will we see it this year?
00:22:35.226 - 00:22:36.388, Speaker C: No, not this year.
00:22:36.474 - 00:22:36.964, Speaker A: No.
00:22:37.082 - 00:22:45.300, Speaker C: I think that's like a multi year conversation. There's no taxes or hard caps or gates in the protocol right now. I think that would require.
00:22:47.320 - 00:22:47.844, Speaker A: You also.
00:22:47.882 - 00:23:08.508, Speaker C: Risk splitting the community. Frankly, if one of the LSTs has 20 million ETH and people are like, all right, we're going to hard cap it, does that community just take it lying down? Probably not. It kind of reminds me of the Bitcoin chain wars back in the day. It's an argument over basically the same thing, which is like, the economics of.
00:23:08.514 - 00:23:26.480, Speaker A: The protocol going to be a pretty interesting q three Q four for ETH. What's the next upgrade called? Cancun I think cancun you have EIP 4844 protodink sharding reducing L two fees by a lot? You have like, Steeth flipping wheat.
00:23:26.840 - 00:23:28.196, Speaker C: Yes, I think you're going to see.
00:23:28.218 - 00:23:28.772, Speaker B: A lot of that.
00:23:28.826 - 00:24:02.408, Speaker C: I mean, the short term, the 4844, I think it's very exciting. It'll definitely decrease the L two S fees. But yesterday bedrock decreased optimism's fees by like 90% in and of itself. It's not like that was any change to the L one or the L one asset or the L two asset itself. It's just like a bit cheaper to transact in optimism. I think people are going to obviously enjoy that and use bedrock to create their own L two s, but I don't really see that as being super big news. I don't know, Michael, if you agree with me or not.
00:24:02.434 - 00:24:16.560, Speaker A: Well, bedrock was big, not because of reddit. Cut gas by 40% or something. Cut the deposit confirmation times by 90%. But I think the real second order implication there is that it kind of opens the gates for Coinbase's base to launch.
00:24:16.640 - 00:24:17.076, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:17.178 - 00:24:18.292, Speaker A: Weren't they waiting for this?
00:24:18.346 - 00:24:19.620, Speaker C: Right? Yes.
00:24:19.770 - 00:24:22.544, Speaker D: This is the first Op stack enablement.
00:24:22.672 - 00:24:43.630, Speaker C: Feature the stuff, and frankly, is like kind of the medium term, like 18 to 36 months roadmap of, like, do we actually get dank sharding on L one? What does that look like? Does the EF just call it a day after the roll ups have scaled to who knows how many transactions per second? But I think that's going to be a very interesting debate within the community.
00:24:44.160 - 00:25:25.364, Speaker D: The other thing, just as context here, I pulled up ultrasound money over the last 30 days. 137,000 E that were burned. Arbitrum was 3200 of that. Optimism was 1400. So we're not talking about layer two being a full feature or like a full burn component of they're like one and 2% respectively. And so I think generally we don't need lower gas costs right now on those L2 S because they're not being utilized to the fullestent. And once that starts happening, applications start developing where you actually start cramming those things full of transactions.
00:25:25.364 - 00:25:28.036, Speaker D: That's when we can start talking about the need for protodain.
00:25:28.068 - 00:26:03.824, Speaker B: Sharding, do you have any sense there was something maybe kind of interesting this week, or maybe not particularly interesting, but I don't know if you guys saw something called Aerodrome happen, but Velodrome is I think it's the largest DAP on optimism. Optimism exchange. It's a fork of solidly with a couple. That was the Andre Crone exchange, that it was kind of the original Ve 33. And there are some improvements. From what I understand, Velodrome is actually doing pretty well. So then Aerodrome announced that they want to be the liquidity hub on base.
00:26:03.824 - 00:26:46.660, Speaker B: I'm a little bit unclear what the relationship is in between Aerodrome and Velodrome, but there's going to be an AirDrop of Aerodrome tokens, and they're going to people who staked Ve. Velo holders, like 40% of the token supply are going to Velo holders. It generated some lively debate internally. I think you could probably make the case of why this is just another deployment on a second chain. Why would you want to do that? I also think it's probably worth noting that there haven't been a ton of really successful deployments from main chain on layer two. And maybe a sort of new but related team with a token is a good strategy.
00:26:47.240 - 00:26:47.796, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:26:47.818 - 00:26:50.900, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys saw it, but I thought it was kind of an interesting tactic.
00:26:52.440 - 00:27:46.100, Speaker C: I mean, it just speaks to the dynamics of these L two S encourage it's like you launch a new L2, there's going to be a project that launches on you, gives away tokens, bootstraps, TVL, bootstraps fees, they pay it to ETH, they post the call data. I can kind of see this trend persisting over many different L2 S, not just base. I think this is interesting. Beldrome has definitely proven out that there is a market for new challengers to incumbents on these different L2 S. And to tie it back to our uniswap conversation, I feel like that's what I would be thinking about is like, what's the growth vector? Right now, it's probably like LSTs on L One and then just like a proliferation of native assets on L2 S that look and feel a lot like your money makers on L One, like just meme, coins, new projects, random stuff like that. I think you kind of want to be across those if you're going to be serious about competing. And the two token model kind of seems a little silly to me.
00:27:46.100 - 00:27:55.092, Speaker C: Should probably just try to do it with one. But I think Beldrome has the right kind of like strategic mindset of just going after every single chain that launches and trying to make it the canonical.
00:27:55.156 - 00:27:58.700, Speaker D: Liquidity provider vampire squid approach.
00:27:59.520 - 00:28:13.948, Speaker C: Yes. It's interesting that no one's tried that on Lido yet. I still think someone will probably try and I guess they just haven't been successful so far. But just that approaches.
00:28:14.044 - 00:28:17.840, Speaker D: How would you say that that would work? Just go after Steeth holders and wrap Steeth holders?
00:28:18.740 - 00:28:45.160, Speaker C: Yeah, you offer them tokens. Like, the LST farms have definitely gotten temporary TVL, but you'd basically spit out tokens, try to basically force exit the Steeth somehow and restake it to your own validators bootstrap, your own validator set. The problem is this all takes a long time, especially at scale, and your token price is going to drop before you probably get to escape velocity. That would be my guess at least.
00:28:45.310 - 00:29:17.380, Speaker D: I do think that there's an element of maybe not dropping tokens specifically to Vampire Attack as a competitor to Lido, but I do see there being a lot of movement in the direction of like we were talking about with that crossing chart, adding Steeth and wrapped Steeth into the collateral set or into the capabilities of other protocols. And I think that's going to pick up. And whether or not you're getting token incentives from participating with that as an asset, I think that's going to be the equivalent of, okay, great. You want to trade perps? Like, we've got a derivatives exchange and you can use it at wraps ETH as collateral.
00:29:18.840 - 00:29:28.260, Speaker C: It's going to be hard to get collateral recognized if you got like, a new LST. I definitely wouldn't in any just like of the canonical protocols.
00:29:28.420 - 00:29:33.000, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the only two that are supported by maker are Wrapsteth and rocket ETH.
00:29:35.900 - 00:30:12.710, Speaker B: Yeah. If you're a Lido, I guess there are like. A couple of things that you can do. You can make Steeth more, give it more utility or you can try to juice the yields and then I guess juicing the yield is more in the there are more implications for restaking there because I'm sure there'll be some sort of race for other liquid staking providers to have their validator set restake onto other weird chains and sort of juice the yields that way. So that's another sort of like a yield competition. I feel like that's another way that you could attack Lido as well.
00:30:13.640 - 00:30:52.044, Speaker C: That only works if you think the restaking players have a very high FDP coming out of the gate. I think we have evidence to suggest that your average new LST is going to have very little success in vampire attacking Lido. But if the restaking play is valued at like 10 billion and you have a billion of incentives for a year to give out, you could probably take a better run at it. But I still don't think you'd be very successful, honestly. Because at the end of the day, the thing that you're restaking on, you need to get fees towards that. You need to bootstrap developer usage on that. That's not exactly straightforward.
00:30:52.044 - 00:30:54.710, Speaker C: You're basically just like another L one or L two.
00:30:55.160 - 00:31:20.844, Speaker B: Yeah, well, there could be. I mean, I don't think any of this would happen with Eigen Layer anyway because Eigen Layer has only approved our ETH and Steeth initially, so I think they'll be very choosy. But who's to say in the next bull market there wouldn't be some competitor to Eigen Layer? That I mean, it's how it works. Some new fangled thing. I don't know what it will be now, but always BitCo is buying Prime Trust. You see that.
00:31:20.882 - 00:31:23.070, Speaker C: Didn't BitCo get hacked once upon a time.
00:31:25.120 - 00:31:26.108, Speaker A: Did they?
00:31:26.274 - 00:31:28.780, Speaker C: Oh yeah, BitCo.
00:31:29.120 - 00:31:32.448, Speaker A: I feel like BitCo is pretty I.
00:31:32.454 - 00:31:33.570, Speaker B: Didn'T know about that.
00:31:34.340 - 00:31:38.800, Speaker C: Bitfinex got hacked and their money was a BitCo fudmonger.
00:31:40.500 - 00:31:42.050, Speaker D: Very different story.
00:31:42.900 - 00:31:44.160, Speaker A: A little fudster.
00:31:44.920 - 00:31:46.272, Speaker C: Multiple fuds.
00:31:46.416 - 00:31:52.592, Speaker A: No, I mean BitCo did sell to Galaxy, but then that deal got walked back for 1.2 billion.
00:31:52.656 - 00:31:57.850, Speaker C: It's a huge man. I feel like Galaxy dodged a bullet on that one.
00:32:02.700 - 00:32:18.924, Speaker A: It was in the heat of the prime. We're all going to build a prime brokerage know Falcon X was ripping coinbase acquired like everyone wanted to be the prime broker and Galaxy scooped them up. I also think they too much money.
00:32:19.042 - 00:32:19.644, Speaker C: Too much money?
00:32:19.682 - 00:32:50.330, Speaker D: Too much for sure. It depends on the financials of BitCo. But that was bull market, so you can assume that the valuation was inflated. The Tinfoil have perspective is that that was going to be the way that Galaxy went public on the Nasdaq because right now they trade on the TSX. They can't come public in the United States because basically investment company issues and if you have a big enough business that's driving enough revenue from a business versus investment returns, you can actually become not an investment company.
00:32:52.620 - 00:33:01.230, Speaker C: He's also moving people out of the US. I just saw a report on that. He's moving the folks to Singapore or something.
00:33:01.680 - 00:33:11.752, Speaker A: Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the exodus to Asia. I had dinner with, that's what we're calling it. That's the title of this podcast.
00:33:11.816 - 00:33:12.744, Speaker C: Everyone's leaving.
00:33:12.872 - 00:33:37.450, Speaker A: Everyone's out. Everyone's out. No, I did have dinner with the founder of this crypto company, said 20% of their business six months ago was coming from Asia and now it's 70%, which is a very stark difference in a very short amount of time. I'm curious just how you guys are seeing that. Are your companies that you're, companies that you've invested in, are they trying to do more business in Asia? Is this some overhyped thing? Is this like what are you guys seeing?
00:33:37.820 - 00:34:11.440, Speaker C: All the games are East Asia, Southeast Asia. Like those are kind of the most ripe markets for at least the games. Specifically the DeFi and the trading. Feels like it's kind of like the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Toronto to a lesser extent. But all the VCs are still in the US. And it feels like all the media is still in the US. And it feels like all the kind know very startup y founders that you get from the tech, you know, frankly just tend to be the best ones are still in the US.
00:34:11.440 - 00:34:43.164, Speaker C: So it's probably a bit more skewed towards Asia at the moment. But I do think that's also a preview of if any of these games hit the industry is going to be mostly in. Like I think that could happen. It isn't happening at the moment, but I don't think the exodus from the US. Is the right way to phrase it's. Just like the Asian market is growing. Keep in mind they did not get caught up in were the government, right or wrong, saved them from that just by not allowing them to access it.
00:34:43.164 - 00:34:48.360, Speaker C: So they have a bit friendlier perspective on the industry than otherwise equivalently.
00:34:48.440 - 00:35:18.410, Speaker D: Just imagine what it's like. And I was having a call with one of our portfolio companies this morning based in Brazil and their perspective is like, listen, 80% of the market is finance in Asia. It's probably the exact same. All of the stuff that they missed. Also paired with we have the biggest exchange on the planet, which is a distribution funnel for anything that people are launching. They also have a wildly fanatic games community. As Vance was talking to.
00:35:18.410 - 00:35:45.890, Speaker D: I think Asia is going to be kind of the temporary heart and center of this for a bit. But going back to it, as soon as regulation becomes clear, whether it's this bill, whether it's something else, there's going to be movements in the next year or two to make this stuff real. That center is going to gravitate right back to the US. Because it's going to be instead of unregulated DeFi. It's going to be regulated, totally blessed, and people are going to move in.
00:35:46.260 - 00:36:26.590, Speaker C: Yeah, think about it this way. If you're an entrepreneur and you have an option to do a token or equity and both are fully regulated and you won't get in trouble for doing one versus the other, nine times out of ten, you'll probably do the token. I do think that will be like the new paradigm. And if you're an investor, you probably want to sign a token warrant for every single investment that you do if that really happens. And that's like a really different frame of mind for a lot of people and probably changes the VC landscape downstream as a result. Like, a lot of people will have to register as Raas. But yeah, maybe it does gravitate towards Asia in the interim, but I feel like once the regulators are able to put this behind them, I do think the SBF trial is also part of that.
00:36:26.590 - 00:36:31.180, Speaker C: There's just things like emotionally, I feel like people still need to put behind them.
00:36:31.250 - 00:36:36.488, Speaker D: Basically, October 2, that's going to be.
00:36:36.674 - 00:36:42.870, Speaker C: I'm sure every day the coverage is just going to be like insane as the evidence piles up.
00:36:43.560 - 00:36:48.240, Speaker D: It's going to be done. I mean, it's supposed to be done by the end of the year. By Thanksgiving.
00:36:48.400 - 00:36:49.110, Speaker C: Yes.
00:36:52.360 - 00:36:54.570, Speaker A: Great. Thanksgiving with the FAM. It sounds like.
00:36:58.060 - 00:37:40.070, Speaker B: We got them. I will say someone put this pretty well. It's like the flip side that I was talking to this week, the flip side of the US taking forever to make decisions is that it also provides kind of more sound ground as opposed to a regime that's just really top down and they can change their mind. Basically on a like right now, everyone's really excited about the UAE, right? But let's just say for hypothetical's sake, FTX had happened there. They can change these laws, know, and sunset in a whole industry and it's just know if you have a really long term mindset and you're trying to build a generational business, it's just harder to do on that type of footing than it is in the US.
00:37:40.520 - 00:38:16.930, Speaker D: I would say in addition to that, a number of other jurisdictions are waiting to take their cue from opinions. I was once again was talking to the portfolio company in Brazil and they were surprised. They wanted to talk all about the different suits that were going on, but they were surprised because they hadn't heard that much about the market structure bill and it's like, okay. And they're intrinsically tied in with a number of regulators and governmental bodies in Brazil. They want to move forward. But if there's something on the table that the US is going to pick up and move forward with, they're going to follow suit. Exactly.
00:38:19.220 - 00:38:37.460, Speaker C: If you're still in position in the US and your business is doing well and the regulation happens, it's going to be night and day because there's not a lot of people who will just frankly still be there at that point, even if it's in like six months or twelve months. I do think it's just going to be game changing for the whole industry.
00:38:37.880 - 00:38:42.920, Speaker A: Yeah. How worried are you guys, short term about some of the subpoenas that seem to be going out to protocols?
00:38:43.900 - 00:38:45.000, Speaker C: Not worried.
00:38:47.520 - 00:38:49.244, Speaker D: That's been going on for years.
00:38:49.442 - 00:38:52.140, Speaker C: Yeah. That's not a new phenomenon.
00:38:55.040 - 00:39:48.828, Speaker B: I don't know, I think a little while ago talked about sort of sentiment and it's an overused analogy, but this does feel, at least to me, a lot like 2019, kind of and feel like there's a big sentiment difference in between. Even when FTX and everything is like exploding and people are really worried, at least there is sort of an active energy there, right? Like you're sort of keyed in and paying attention, whereas I do feel like the aftermath of that tends to be a little bit more depressing, actually, because that's when apathy really sets in and your first instinct to stay is that, oh, all that stuff is behind us now. Everything's going to turn around, but then there's like a lag before it actually does turn around. And I think that can actually be the most mentally challenging for a lot of people, especially very execution oriented builders. What do you guys think about just sentiment generally? Do you talk to a lot of your founders that are struggling with this? How long do you think this goes on? And I don't know, what advice do.
00:39:48.834 - 00:40:38.936, Speaker C: You give them on the negative side? You can really dig the hole as deep as you want. You can go to the Earth's crust, like just thinking about, is the industry fucked? Does this protocol work? Is my team the right team? Am I wasting my time? All of that. It really is kind of like you can choose your own adventure and that leads you only to one path, which is just like failure giving up. But I do think if you take a step back objectively, a lot of the stuff that's happening is like a positive backdrop and when things are bad, you just got to put 1ft in front of the other. I think there's really no, like, you can't wake up happy one day, you just got to keep going. Maybe that's not like the most comforting advice, but good advice. There's nothing else you can do always.
00:40:38.936 - 00:40:44.592, Speaker C: And the alternative is just like the doom loop. It doesn't really work that well.
00:40:44.646 - 00:40:48.396, Speaker D: It doesn't help the best founders don't.
00:40:48.428 - 00:40:52.660, Speaker C: Have those types of points that's conversations or perspectives.
00:40:53.000 - 00:41:46.132, Speaker D: And I would say, honestly, most of the conversations that we have with portfolio founders is like, here's all the news that's happening. How do you reevaluate, how do you readjust? Do you want to change strategy? I know your head's down building right now, but maybe pop up and touch some grass or actually get outside and see what's going on, to assess where things could be going and make sure that you're on the right path there. That's our job is to see the tea leaves or hear different disparate information, put things together and just say, hey, here's where we think things are going. Use this information as you want. It's really not like the founder therapy of what do we do every day when we show up to work. Also, I think it's like two days away from being the four year anniversary of Starting Framework. We started in the summer of 2019, and if this is summer 2019, this is the best time to be doing exactly what we're doing.
00:41:46.266 - 00:42:46.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the other thing is you have to believe that you're building a big business. There's milestones that you can put in the ground that are irrefutable. Can you get to 50 to 100 million of Arr? That's kind of like the minimum for a venture outcome for you to make a lot of money. And I think a lot of people, frankly, have the small market problem right now where it's like, you're a business that's selling to a business that's facilitating, like, retail flow or NFT sales or there's just not many things that you can sell software to. And I think those people are having a bit harder of a time just understanding the reality of if your startup is going to succeed, you need 10,000 others to use and buy their product. And right now, there just aren't 10,000 startups willing to do that. But the people who are closer to the metal either building new markets closer to the fundamentals in places like DeFi, or building for just gigantic markets like games, those are the people who have a lot of reasons for optimism, and it's kind of just on them.
00:42:46.710 - 00:42:54.184, Speaker C: I do believe most of those people can really build things that are important. It's just a matter of having the tenacity to do it.
00:42:54.222 - 00:42:58.924, Speaker B: You guys want to talk about chainlink a little bit? They've had a big news week.
00:42:59.122 - 00:43:00.110, Speaker D: Oh, boy.
00:43:07.280 - 00:43:08.680, Speaker B: The Marines, baby.
00:43:08.760 - 00:43:14.000, Speaker A: The Marines. This is our growth strategy. We need the Marines to jump.
00:43:16.020 - 00:43:20.080, Speaker C: Of course I wouldn't play with them, man.
00:43:20.150 - 00:43:50.780, Speaker D: They were also born in the air market. Yeah, chain Link had some announcements of some partnerships this week. I think the funny part is when at least we got started with Chain Link, which is in 2017, when they launched literally the rumor of the first partnership that they were going to announce was Swift. And it was like, Chain Link and Sergey are working with Swift behind the scenes, and it was always the rumor of Swift. And when were they going to announce that Swift is switching to Chainlink and it's going to run on Chain Link? Well, this weekend.
00:43:54.960 - 00:44:21.520, Speaker C: For years, like, just little photos. And we would dial into the Swift yearly conference, which is like, totally such banking dribble, so dry and getting through hours of five minutes of Sergey. But the madman, he pulled it off at least proven concept, like, step in the right direction. But it is good to see Sergey.
00:44:21.680 - 00:44:23.700, Speaker B: They've got some pretty good entrance.
00:44:26.140 - 00:44:27.492, Speaker D: Sergey Nazarov.
00:44:27.556 - 00:44:28.596, Speaker C: There were rumors.
00:44:28.708 - 00:44:38.584, Speaker A: I like all the like yeah. Is Sergey Satoshi, like, he owned SmartContract.com in 2009, like, a day after the White Paper went live. Like, all those things.
00:44:38.782 - 00:44:40.696, Speaker C: Wow, you've gone deep on your Sergey.
00:44:40.728 - 00:44:56.044, Speaker A: Lore chain link was my yeah. Well, we won't get into it. The guy next to me in 2017, when crypto was ripping, when I pre blockworks, was a big chain link bag holder, so his name was Mike.
00:44:56.172 - 00:44:59.404, Speaker B: You owe that guy thank you. You owe him like an edible arrangement.
00:44:59.452 - 00:45:13.510, Speaker A: I owe him a thank you. Yeah. What is chain link's business? Because they have like 400 or 500 or 600 employees or something. How do they make money? What is their revenue models? What are their products?
00:45:15.820 - 00:45:51.820, Speaker D: Well, it's changing. I think historically, it started off with price feeds and all the DeFi applications that needed decentralized price feeds. Basically every single DeFi protocol at this point would pay to use those price feeds. And that was something that was sort of negotiated or talked about. Sometimes it was paid by the Dow, sometimes it was a service fee. I don't actually have very much context as to how that was constructed. I think where they're moving in general is to CCIP, which is cross chain communication information protocol.
00:45:51.820 - 00:46:15.588, Speaker D: I'm probably butchering that, but we could think of that as like a cross chain messaging protocol where you can actually have no bridges and decentralized trust for those different node operators on those different chains. And that gets cured by the token it's paid for by the users, and it would be something that flows to the operators of those nodes.
00:46:15.764 - 00:46:18.248, Speaker C: Like an l one, basically. Yeah.
00:46:18.334 - 00:46:18.920, Speaker A: Got it.
00:46:18.990 - 00:46:34.656, Speaker C: I think the chain link three mode L one is actually going to happen. That was at least like the smart context of last year. And if you think about it, they probably have some of the most amount of developers building on them. Of any L one in general, just by virtue of the price feeds, they.
00:46:34.678 - 00:46:38.876, Speaker D: Definitely have the most TVL that's supported by a protocol other than Ethereum.
00:46:38.988 - 00:46:41.344, Speaker A: Is it public how much revenue they do?
00:46:41.542 - 00:46:43.830, Speaker C: No, we have no idea either.
00:46:45.240 - 00:46:45.990, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:46.680 - 00:47:29.520, Speaker D: I think generally you'll be able to see everything on chain with CCIP, I would assume, because it's all going to be on chain. The stuff that happens that isn't that in historical products. No idea. The other stuff that they do, which I think is kind of undernoticed, is random number generator, which is what powers most of the play to earn gaming. So whenever it's actually kind of a hard math problem to prove that something was a random number, especially with the compute of ethereum and you have to be able to have that for it to be a fair game. And so that's one of the things that they're obviously powering DFI but they're also powering a ton of games.
00:47:30.180 - 00:47:31.120, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:47:31.270 - 00:47:34.704, Speaker B: Can you explain that? I'm not fully following what is that.
00:47:34.742 - 00:48:00.556, Speaker D: Why if you're programming and you have a math function that gives you a random number it's actually just like we're going to choose one between zero and 100 and set DVD that percentage to a certain decimal point. Well it's actually not mathematically random. There is some bias in that and for you to do a fully random calculation it has to be something that requires off chain compute and that's what their off chain compute enables and then.
00:48:00.578 - 00:48:03.310, Speaker B: Brings it back on chain gotcha interesting.
00:48:04.480 - 00:48:05.340, Speaker A: Yeah it's cool.
00:48:05.410 - 00:48:13.804, Speaker C: They've got a lot of different things that have, doesn't it's? Not like outside the realm of possibility to see this as now you do.
00:48:13.842 - 00:48:27.830, Speaker B: You guys see a little while ago, I think it was Dan Elitzer who wrote this big, long thread about what makes up a crypto primitive and sort of advocated for not using oracles in DeFi primitives. I would be curious what you guys think about that.
00:48:28.760 - 00:48:40.168, Speaker C: Feel like that would lead to multiple financial disasters almost immediately the on chain Oracles have caused more problems than the off chain Oracles just empirically over the.
00:48:40.174 - 00:48:50.990, Speaker D: Past few also well generally I would say that sounds like a great research project but not something that's real.
00:48:51.440 - 00:49:16.980, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, uma I remember back in the day tried to build BitMEX with no, was it was an interesting idea, but mostly a science like these are really interesting designs, the consumers. It makes it very hard for them to use. And also, there's huge accidents if you get a bad Oracle on chain because it's just super volatile. Right. And the prices are by definition stale if all of the discovery happens on centralized exchanges.
00:49:17.800 - 00:49:35.400, Speaker D: Remember when Auger was going to be the Oracle solution for all of crypto and it was like a 14 day contest period and you had to get a certain number of votes to be able to enable quorum and then people would vote on whether the outcome was correct or not. Like come on people just want to know if it was heads or tails.
00:49:37.600 - 00:49:45.804, Speaker B: Feel like decentralized prediction markets is one of those white whale things in crypto that every three years people Polymarket does.
00:49:45.842 - 00:49:51.280, Speaker C: Okay I think but only when there's like the once in four years presidential elections.
00:49:52.820 - 00:50:06.870, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think about different what about something like a uniswap which wouldn't depend on a price Oracle but they basically depend on arbitragers to move the price back in line.
00:50:08.680 - 00:50:40.264, Speaker D: I think generally the one thing that is becoming more apparent and actually Kane from Synthetics had an interesting post on this recently, which is basically their trials and tribulations of having a pull versus a push Oracle solution. The reality is that having multiple solutions for different use types and user types is probably the best solution for most of these protocols. 99% of the time it's going to be used one way. But if you're going to use the product in that way or this other way, it's probably something that would be better suited for something easier.
00:50:40.312 - 00:50:41.310, Speaker B: All I need.
00:50:41.760 - 00:50:42.844, Speaker C: I got to run.
00:50:42.962 - 00:50:44.890, Speaker B: All right, fellas. We can call it all right later.
