00:00:04.250 - 00:00:30.066, Speaker A: Let's jump in. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup. We've got a little crossover with Empire and Bell Curve, but we have dropped the dead weight. So Santiago's gone, Vance is gone. We've got, I don't think Santiago vance, you're going to enjoy those, Michael's one and two. And for the Empire listeners, that is Michael Ipolito from Blockworks and Michael Anderson from Framework. And then we have Vance Plus Plus, otherwise known as Miles O'Neill from referee.
00:00:30.066 - 00:00:31.560, Speaker A: So welcome, guys.
00:00:32.490 - 00:00:34.200, Speaker B: Great to be here.
00:00:34.970 - 00:00:40.314, Speaker A: Michael, whether or not Vance and Santiago return to our respective roundups after that.
00:00:40.352 - 00:00:43.338, Speaker B: Intro, I was going to say a.
00:00:43.344 - 00:00:46.266, Speaker C: Little less than that, but Michael real.
00:00:46.288 - 00:00:53.626, Speaker D: Question is I feel like I delivered on a picture of Bald when when Yano was gone. Do we have a bald Vance or.
00:00:53.728 - 00:01:02.590, Speaker C: The I know I dropped the ball. I'm going to have to share it after the fact and put it in the, uh this morning was kind of busy.
00:01:04.370 - 00:01:12.340, Speaker D: Look, all I'm saying is a little unsolicited advice if you want people to take Framework seriously, like, someone's got to go bald. You guys are just too strong on the hair game, right?
00:01:14.870 - 00:01:26.966, Speaker C: Get he is currently, I think, on a plane to Tokyo and he got probably the shortest haircut I've ever seen him get yesterday. So we're getting close.
00:01:27.148 - 00:01:28.038, Speaker B: How do you get the right direction?
00:01:28.044 - 00:01:29.210, Speaker C: I think it's closer.
00:01:31.950 - 00:01:44.934, Speaker D: There's nothing quite like especially like a very short or like kind of trying something with a haircut to make you feel like you're about twelve years old in terms of insecurity. So we'll have to instant regret.
00:01:44.982 - 00:01:45.580, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:49.390 - 00:01:51.726, Speaker D: Let'S talk about our okay, cool.
00:01:51.748 - 00:03:06.018, Speaker A: And then I want to get into some mev stuff, but let's start with Arbitrum governance. So the TLDR of what happened this week is so Arbitrum launched their token and then AIP one, which was the Arbitrum improvement proposal, framework proposal went live. The first proposal for Arbitrum and the TLDR of it is that they wanted to move 750,000,000 Arbitrum tokens, which was roughly a billion dollars from the treasury, into the foundation to be able to do at a high level, like BD deals, grants, like hiring and things like that. Blockworks research actually came out pretty strong in this one and voted no against it and I think helped to tilt the vote in the no direction. The overview, and I think why we voted no was that it makes sense to probably move money from the treasury into the foundation, but there really was very little transparency into what was actually going to happen with that billion dollars. And I think there's a bunch of second order impact questions from that from that proposal. Like, the big thing that was on my mind is like, well, when a new token goes live, one of the first things that people look at is like, what allocation is going towards the team? What's going to the investors, what's going to the foundation.
00:03:06.018 - 00:03:28.480, Speaker A: And my first thought was like, if the first thing that you do is move money from the treasury to the foundation, why don't you just start with more money, more of the Tokens in the foundation to begin with. So it feels like a little bit of governance kind of theater there in a way, but I want to get your guys'take. So what do you guys think about what happened the past couple of days with Arbitrum here?
00:03:29.490 - 00:04:07.930, Speaker D: I think one more minor bit of detail, Michael, sorry, before you jump in, is I think the other reason why this was not very well received is after the vote started to shift to no, there was some on chain sleuthing that was done that revealed that actually the funds had already been distributed to the foundation. And come to realize, with hindsight, Arbitrum says actually this wasn't really a vote, this was a ratification of something that has already happened. So even though the vote was actually turned down, the end result was no, the foundation still has those funds. So just like a little bit of additional color and kind of why they were getting so much heat.
00:04:10.110 - 00:04:54.486, Speaker E: Hey everyone, exciting announcement from Blockworks. We are hiring two podcast hosts to come build a brand new show with us. The show is called Lightspeed. TLDR of Lightspeed is that it is a show for builders, tinkerers and lovers of technology. Lightspeed is a callback to the heyday of Silicon Valley where great technology was built in garages, non corporate fortresses. Lightspeed is an exploration of crypto from the perspective of a builder and an engineer who's really designing for scale and is interested in onboarding the next billion users into crypto. So if this sounds exciting to you and you have a background in creating content or hosting podcasts, head over to the careers page of Blockworks.
00:04:54.486 - 00:05:10.720, Speaker E: It's just Blockworks co careers, or even easier, slide through my DMs on Twitter, hit me up, let us know. We would love to hear from you. We are super excited about the show and we're looking for two podcast hosts who are as excited as us. Talk to you soon.
00:05:13.730 - 00:05:59.040, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. That was essentially what I was going to talk about. But more to the point of the point of doing it after the Token had launched is so that you can use the mechanism of decentralized governance to be able to promote the community. And Tokens being part of the governance mechanism, it just doesn't look that great when it gets found out to be more decentralization theater than actual true decentralization. And frankly, the moment when a Token launches, it's like the most wild and crazy period of time. You've got Tokens flying everywhere, you had this massive AirDrop. There isn't a consistent Token originated community because the Tokens literally didn't exist and suddenly they do.
00:05:59.040 - 00:06:23.080, Speaker C: In retrospect, it's the worst time to be trying to corral everybody to get behind a vote. And I think it definitely kind of ran in their face a bit and I hopefully think that the arbitrary team will be stronger because of this going forward and definitely have that perspective but they're going to have to learn how to engage the community in a different way. This is just a testament to that.
00:06:23.770 - 00:07:29.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I think my initial reaction is, I guess two things. One is that I think it does provide some insights into the regulatory challenges that these teams face because it would have been a lot easier just to take that 7% or 8% and add that to the team's allocations but then going out and then deploying that to do BD or other things that presents some regulatory challenges. It looks like you're more like a security essentially. And then the second option would have been I guess carving out an entirely different category beyond the community treasury from day zero for this foundation. But then of course that's not in the hands of the community. It's probably a decision that the community should make so you can't do that. So you get to this third option which is basically present it as if it was part of the treasury but then as soon as governance launches, move it into this own foundation and hope that you don't get any pushback.
00:07:29.290 - 00:08:10.250, Speaker B: And so I think this would be a lot easier if you didn't have those challenges in the first place. But the second takeaway for me is just I think it's a lesson in terms of that others should look to for learning best practices on proposal submissions. And if there's one thing we've seen is that first of all, when you bundle a lot of pretty major decisions into one omnibus proposal, say like the Atom 2.0 saga right, that was a loaded proposal. You are just setting yourself up for more, I would say pushback. Right. And so it's much better to isolate these proposals separately.
00:08:10.250 - 00:09:12.874, Speaker B: And then really, when it comes to anything around treasury spend, there is a huge onus on you for transparency and there was just some table stakes details that you guys called out that were missing from that, especially of a treasury of that notional size, at least in US dollar value. And we run grant programs and we have to be extremely explicit about our processes. Who's in control of the actual funds? Who's doing the day to day work? Why are we capable of doing this? Why should you trust us and why should you trust the folks on the multi SIG? All of these things I would say are standard for a ten or $20 million grants fund, much less a billion dollar foundation proposal. So yeah, I thought early lessons and launching a Dow anytime soon, I would just take some notes. Good thing to avoid going forward, get.
00:09:12.912 - 00:10:12.154, Speaker D: Your little yellow notepad out and just jot some. I'm in total agreement with you Miles, and I do think it's worth just highlighting again, it's a very different regulatory environment and frankly there's an organizational challenge around Dows that haven't necessarily been solved yet. So I think it's always fair to give the benefit of the doubt to these teams that are trying to navigate really difficult problems in real time in a highly competitive environment. That said, I think there were some pretty obvious mistakes that were made here. And to your point, just to re highlight this was 750,000,000 ARB tokens which is over a billion dollars worth of notional value in US dollar terms. And the explanation that the foundation gave this comes from Patrick McCrory. He said that the foundation needs a sustainable amount of funding not necessarily governed by tokens to deal with partners who won't do on chain transactions to make IRL partnerships, right? Like kind of some of the ones that Polygon has gained a lot of attention for to avoid voter fatigue, et cetera.
00:10:12.154 - 00:10:27.970, Speaker D: And there definitely is some concept of this even within sort of companies today. It doesn't make sense to have every single person weighing in on every decision no matter how small or no matter what the expertise is. But I'd say there's a fine line and a spectrum.
00:10:28.130 - 00:11:40.934, Speaker A: But I think that begs the question then mike so Patrick's saying that they need to use those funds to do these BD deals with off chain entities. So like big brands and I'm assuming what they're saying is they need to compete with the Polygons of the world or when Polygon is doing a deal with a Starbucks or a Nike or whoever their other big web Three or like a Meta or something like that. The way those deals work is there's oftentimes almost not like a bidding process but they are incentivizing those companies to work with them with money. So Polygon might pay $5 million or $10 million or I've even heard upwards of like 20 or $30 million to go convince one of those web two brands to work with them. So what Arbitrum is actually saying here is they need $20 million to be able to go compete with Polygon and win the Starbucks BD deal. But in that case shouldn't the community and they're saying they shouldn't have to ask the basically community if that's a good use of funds. Isn't that a perfect point in time of where you should actually ask the community of like hey, I want to go spend $20 million to go try to do this beta deal with Starbucks.
00:11:40.934 - 00:11:43.340, Speaker A: That feels like a lot of money for that kind of a deal.
00:11:43.870 - 00:13:09.900, Speaker C: So all upon here and say I think there is a difficulty in especially the type of transaction that you're talking about where a lot of those deals are competitive and a lot of those deals need to stay private until the deal is done. And if you're in a bake off process against any other participant, they now have information against you that they can use in their process, which is going to be private. So I do think that there is an element of I mean, the question that I was going to pose to the group is what do we think is and I don't think there's a clear answer, but what are the different types of governance models that work and which ones don't? I think a pure token, one vote, one token model for every single initiative is probably not the best model and you shouldn't be asking the entire audience of what we should do in every single decision. The one that I do actually kind of like is the multi council model where your tokens are voted to elect people to have different controls over some of this stuff. And Synthetics actually has a really good example of this, where they've got a Spartan council who does the upgrades for the protocol. They've got a treasury council who manages the treasury. And the point of the Treasury Council is they know the information, like how much people are getting paid via the treasury when they're contributing to the protocol, any of the business development deals and what the details of those are.
00:13:09.900 - 00:13:23.280, Speaker C: But that isn't shared with the entire community. Their budget is determined by the community and the token holders, but their process and they're evaluated with outcomes, that's something that goes to the community but the internals is not.
00:13:23.810 - 00:14:24.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess one interesting, maybe nuance that I'm personally curious about is I've always gotten the sense that Polygon and even optimism were doing these deals off of their own balance sheet of the operating company and using their own cash that they've raised. I think polygon raised like $400 million at some point in the last cycle. And why Arbitrum is opting to do this out of what is, I guess, the community's allocation of tokens in the first place. But I guess that mean. Michael, to your point, I think at the very least, if it's a foundation or a grants program, they need to have an approved mandate. Like, here's what we're going trust us, we're going to go do these private deals that need to be done behind closed doors until they're announced, but here's what you're giving us money to go do. And I think that even that was missing here.
00:14:24.420 - 00:15:30.440, Speaker B: And I think the proper amount of transparency and the proper governance structure kind of depends by function, like upgrades to the smart contract bridge. That is something that should absolutely be a large council of multi stakeholders from all different sorts of backgrounds. Right, whereas I don't think having a council to do BD is actually very effective. I think that's one thing where you approve a team that you trust and is capable to go do it for you and then have them basically report back every quarter, every six months or something like that, and then decide, do you want to keep funding them? Do you want to claw back the funding if they've done a terrible job. So, yeah, I guess that's my initial reaction. I do like the different the two house governance models. I don't think something that's like a council for every single function works well, but I think you can mix and match these things.
00:15:31.210 - 00:15:53.194, Speaker D: Yeah, just confirming there. By the way, I was sharing screen for folks who are following along via video, but it was a $450,000,000 raise which was led by Sequoia for Polygon. Date of that was February of 2022. So honestly, a lot of the difference that gets made for Crypto is like if you raise money at the right time, that's exactly the right that was a good move from Polygon, right.
00:15:53.392 - 00:15:56.446, Speaker B: Cash and then they don't have to go through governance. Right.
00:15:56.468 - 00:16:13.570, Speaker A: Well, can I actually maybe push back on that, Mike? It was a good move from Polygon because they were able to raise 450,000,000 and then go win all these BD deals. But do we think that's a good use of money in the first place? They probably spent $100 million on winning these web Three or Web Two deals.
00:16:14.230 - 00:17:04.100, Speaker D: So two separate parts of that question actually one is just I think the strategy of staying existing in crypto throughout multiple cycles is just sell your equity when it's like the most expensive at the top of the cycle and use that to get you through the bear market. So that's more what I was talking about in Coinbase. I don't know if remember we talked about this when we saw they did that $1.5 billion debt issuance. I remember the two of us were having a conversation like, maybe this is a sign that Coinbase deciding to finance themselves here probably means we're approaching some sort of top. But then the meat of your question there was, are these BD deals good from the perspective of Polygon? And this is where I'm not an expert in this. I have my own sort of opinion and I don't have the knowledge of all of these deals and the results that they've had.
00:17:04.100 - 00:17:13.750, Speaker D: I think I was saying my diplomatic opinion. I was trying to give you non answer.
00:17:13.900 - 00:17:15.910, Speaker A: I want the non diplomatic opinion.
00:17:19.770 - 00:18:01.814, Speaker D: Look, it really depends. It's kind of like being in the business of honestly, like venture or content. You're trying to take a portfolio of different bets and hoping that one really ends up paying off. And if one ends up paying off, it's going to pay for all the losers. And at the end of the day, if Polygon lands one of these things and they pay $20 million to Starbucks and that actually ends up onboarding 10 million people onto their blockchain, then boom, it doesn't matter what you did with the rest of the 450,000,000 because that's going to be such a gigantic win if they miss. And probably most of these are going to miss and look like expensive wastes of money with the benefit of hindsight, then everyone's going to say it was a really stupid way to spend that money.
00:18:02.012 - 00:18:09.420, Speaker C: I think the product strategy for Polygon right now is to not have a product strategy and try everything.
00:18:12.110 - 00:18:21.098, Speaker B: Casting a wide net both in terms of but yeah, that's generally my take journey is.
00:18:21.104 - 00:18:52.760, Speaker A: Still this might be an obvious thing to you guys. I originally thought that these ecosystem funds were like a crypto thing. I was kind of skeptical of these ecosystem funds as well, which is kind of related to what we're talking about. But I met with someone who was like, first five employees at Amazon Alexa, and he was explaining that they did the exact same thing. They had like 100 million dollar ecosystem fund to convince people to come build on Amazon Alexa. And he said that it's very common practice, which that might just be my naivete, but I never knew that was a thing.
00:18:55.850 - 00:19:42.582, Speaker C: There is a model in, like, I think it was mostly in the late 90s, early 2000s, where you wouldn't necessarily have the company itself fund a specific venture fund to go off for these ecosystems. But I very viscerally. Remember Kleiner Perkins famously had the Java Fund, which was anyone who's building applications in Java, they would fund that. They also had the ifund if you were building an application on iPhones, they would give you some funding. I mean, you can kind of think of it in the same way, which is I'm sure a lot of that capital came from the respective invested interests in those ecosystems. But it is interesting to think, okay, well, how are we going to build this platform? Oh, we need to invest in things that are going to build on this platform. Oh, we need to go fund those.
00:19:42.582 - 00:20:21.554, Speaker C: Okay, let's go. That model is definitely tried and true. The one thing I will say about Polygon is, and I don't know this for sure, but my guess is that they have two buckets of assets to pull from when they're making these deals. They have the cash on the balance sheet and they have the Polygon the Matic token itself. My guess, and once again, don't know this for sure, is that a lot of those deals were actually struck with Matic itself, not with the cash on the balance sheet. Cash on the balance sheet is funding the hundreds of people that work at Polygon, not the business development deals. That's kind of how I think they do it.
00:20:21.554 - 00:20:56.846, Speaker C: And I know that this is a playbook that Ripple ran way back in the day. This is a playbook that a bunch of these ecosystems have run where it's like, hey, we need to find massive ecosystem partners. Let's just give them $10 million worth of our currency. Then they're bought in. They have the asset that they are going to need to use the ecosystem, run a validator run a node, whatever it may be, but they're also going to be able to be participatory in the network with governance and potentially see upside with growth of the network itself. So I think that's probably what was going on and what has been going on with a lot of this BD stuff, less the cash itself, just kind.
00:20:56.868 - 00:21:01.870, Speaker B: Of cracking up, matching Starbucks, not knowing what to do with this $20 million of Maddox.
00:21:03.990 - 00:21:10.660, Speaker A: So I'm funny figure out how to get this.
00:21:12.550 - 00:21:36.022, Speaker C: I have a friend who is one of the VPs of Finance at a large social media company that is trying to go public who's been involved in Web Three. So you can piece the two leaves together if you want, but they randomly have all these tokens on their balance sheet, and they're like, where do we custody them? Apparently they were stored in some MetaMask wallet on one engineer's device.
00:21:36.166 - 00:21:39.946, Speaker B: And what do we do? We have to recognize I can set.
00:21:39.968 - 00:21:41.482, Speaker A: Up MetaMask for us.
00:21:41.616 - 00:21:52.350, Speaker C: It's like, okay, we got to put them onto a hardware wallet. We need to safeguard this stuff. And how do we account for these things? Do we have to disclose these in the S? One comes painful.
00:21:52.770 - 00:22:35.470, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe we could pivot this conversation into mike, you had a pretty interesting tweet this week about ETH L two S having every feature that all L1s are criticized for. And I think the things that you specifically mentioned were centralized, single sequencers, network downtime, opaque resource allocation, which is what we're talking about right now. Wildly expensive valuations, also what we're talking about right now. And you said time to call spade of spade, right? ETH L two S have every feature that all L1s are criticized for. You got some pretty interesting engagement and pushback on that, I'd say. I'm curious, now that you've had a couple of days to digest that, what are your thoughts around it? Or maybe do you want to share a little more into what you meant by that tweet?
00:22:36.850 - 00:23:34.106, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the thing that I'm kind of trying to ask myself, and one I do just think there's look, some of the other ecosystems outside of especially Bitcoin and ETH, take like an enormous amount of flack. A lot of it is very well deserved. A lot of it is just because some of these blockchain ecosystems are just not at the same point of maturity and haven't been allowed to achieve the same sort of deflationary schedule or inflation or emission schedule or level of decentralizations that decentralization that more mature blockchain ecosystems have. So that was kind of the point that I was trying to make with that. But I think I actually kind of want to ask this question to you guys, which I think there's kind of an interesting comparison to be made here between hypothetical to all of you guys. The FDV of salana and Arbitrum are about the same. They're about between eleven and $12 billion each.
00:23:34.106 - 00:23:45.220, Speaker D: I'd be curious if you guys had to invest in one of those or buy them at the current price, which one would seem more attractive to you and why?
00:23:46.890 - 00:23:49.110, Speaker C: Disclosure not financial advice.
00:23:51.610 - 00:24:00.730, Speaker D: Not financial advice, not financial spiny. Put on a little speculator caps here. I just love to know how you guys would construct the argument.
00:24:04.110 - 00:25:02.970, Speaker C: I think it's a really interesting question and we're not investors in either of them, don't intend to not financial advice. The way that I would see it, and this is going to be no surprise to you guys, let's just say that everything else is equal. The token economics are the same, so the value accrual model is generally the same. I think there is still kind of a question as to what the value accrual model will be for Arbitrum. But that's a question that exists relative to where you would see the value accrual potential with Solana. So let's just say that those are the same, the token economics in terms of distribution. So one of the reasons why you look at how much has been vested, how much is liquid, is because you want to know what those unlocks are and who potentially bought at a much lower price, who would potentially want to sell at the current price that will drive price action in a lot of these ecosystems.
00:25:02.970 - 00:26:13.742, Speaker C: And then what you really want to look at is what's the growth, what's the potential go to market strategy, who's building on top of it and where is that trending? So all else being equal, that's kind of how I would think about it. Where who is on the up and who is on the down? I would say Arbitrum is definitely on the up relative to Salana, just because they're an ecosystem. They have historically been the most used ecosystem out of the top l two S on top of ethereum and with 4844, there's a potential that their cost drops to something below what you would see on Salana. Even so, that I think is a huge variable. Unfortunately, I'd say Salana did get caught up in the FTX debacle, unfortunately, and not something that they did specifically themselves. And anecdotally we've just heard a number of either games or application developers that are moving away from the Solana ecosystem. So that is the lifeblood of growth for these platforms.
00:26:13.742 - 00:26:16.600, Speaker C: And if you start to see negative growth, that's a really bad sign.
00:26:17.690 - 00:27:16.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's fair. It also kind of depends on what Arbitrum wants to be, which I think is not totally clear to me right now. But I think a fair compare or more apples to apples comparison is Arbitrum the general purpose roll up and the prospects of that versus Salana, the general purpose l one and two different economic models around and growth prospects honestly, of that. But I think where it becomes apples to oranges a little bit is if Arbitrum starts and I think they're heading this direction, it's more like a roll up framework that there's going to be the Arbitrum general purpose roll up. But Arbitrum is obviously launching lots of other types of, I would say roll up frameworks and tooling for whether it be app specific roll ups. I think it's Arbitrum Nova orbit, I think. Right orbit.
00:27:16.210 - 00:28:54.002, Speaker B: I can't remember the names of them off the top of my head but I think if you're just comparing the roll up to Salana l one, which I guess they're both general purpose you're looking at whatever they can get on gas fees, plus potentially mev revenue in the future if they decide to do some sort of sequencer PBS auction or something like that. But, yeah, I think solana. And then if you think about the verticals, I think Salana is kind of soul searching at the moment, given that DFI has taken such a hit over there and kind of retail like web3 activity is down. But still seems like that's more kind of the niche they're going for. Which I think is much more promising than competing on the DFI side. But yeah, I think it also depends on is arbitrary multi going to put out a shared sequencer service that all of its apps can tap into? Right? That's another form of revenue. Is there going to be some sort of any sort of, I don't know, economic share from the other tools that they're putting out? Or is it just going to be completely free open source, like SDK tooling? Yeah, I think there's probably more angles for value accrual with Arbitrum or maybe it's just a more complicated kind of unclear future, whereas solana you know what it's going for, right? You don't know exactly what type of activity it really wants or it's kind of out of their control since it's permissionless in general purpose.
00:28:54.002 - 00:28:57.270, Speaker B: But yeah, I just want to call out that nuance.
00:28:58.430 - 00:29:01.050, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, another answer to this is neither.
00:29:04.430 - 00:29:52.154, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know, I was just kind of thinking about this myself and I'm not really 100% sure, but I do disagree with you. I actually think I'm not financial advice. There are times charm, but I think Salona is going to end up doing much better than basically the consensus majority would expect. And I've got some technical arguments and some non technical arguments, which is purely based on kind of pattern matching. But I sort of remember at the nader of the last bear cycle during around like 2019, the consensus bet then was not ethereum. The consensus bet was bitcoin. And if you look at how bitcoin did during the last bull cycle, it did well, but it underperformed most other tokens that did better.
00:29:52.154 - 00:30:40.114, Speaker D: And I think the one thing that the bitcoiners kind of didn't take into account was that there's so much more. The liquidity kind of cuts both ways, right? So the larger market cap means that you need more marginal dollars to come in to. Move the price either up or down, right? So it outperformed on the way down, but it also didn't go up as much as people expected because they just don't think they took that into account. I think one dynamic of the L2s on ETH that people I haven't really heard anyone say this, but it would make sense. It would logically work like this. I think people allocate to different ecosystems. Like, they'd be like there's kind of like different layer ones which are seen as like an index of everything that's going on in the ecosystem.
00:30:40.114 - 00:31:40.150, Speaker D: And I think ETH went from being like, hey, I really like ETH and what's getting built on ETH. So I'm going to chuck $1,000 into ETH to I really like the ETH ecosystem. So I'm going to put $500 into ETH and 250 into Arbitrum and 250 into optimism. And then I think that, combined with the larger market cap of ETH and these L two S is just I think they'll do well this next cycle, but I think it will underperform what people generally think is going to happen in terms of price. Whereas Salana is they've got to get their BD chops kind of figured out. They've got to attract projects back to the space, they've got to rebuild DeFi, they've got to capitalize on the momentum they have around any NFTs, and they've got to solidify brand. But what they've got going for them is that it's non consensus and they still have the ability for that shit to pop because the volume is just generally lower.
00:31:40.150 - 00:31:42.670, Speaker D: And that's where you get the big moves.
00:31:47.090 - 00:32:19.850, Speaker A: Your take is that when we go back into a bull market, investing becomes left bell curve. And where we're at in the market right now, we try to go right bell curve and think kind of technically, but back in a bull market, we go left bell curve. And if you're investing in ETH, it's kind of confusing you're like, does value accrue to ETH? Does value accrue to, like, optimism? Is it Arbitrum? So if you have $1,000, you might put 500 into ETH, 250 into ARB, 250 into optimism. But for other folks, it's like the Alt L1 thesis is easy, and you're just like, let me throw $1,000 into Salana. Is that your thesis?
00:32:20.990 - 00:32:35.040, Speaker D: I think regardless bull or bear market, you need to be able to quickly articulate whatever the left bell curve version is of your investment thesis. Like, preach bitcoin is like Internet money. Internet money. Bing, bang, boom. Ethereum is like.
00:32:36.930 - 00:32:37.758, Speaker A: Bitcoin, but you can.
00:32:37.764 - 00:33:00.390, Speaker D: Do other stuff, too. You can do more stuff than you can on Bitcoin. Super easy. And then solana is like ethereum but faster. And it's just very easy stuff to understand because what moves the price of assets marginally is like, it'll be retail inflows. And so you have to have a very simple, easy to understand thing. The L two S are a layer of complexity and it's going to divide flows.
00:33:01.290 - 00:33:21.130, Speaker C: Do you think that that narrative changes ethereum but faster once 4844 goes in and Ethereum L2 S roll ups are cheaper than Salana. Assuming that Salana also puts in the fee market, 4844 goes in a reasonable amount of time and the expectations are reality in terms of the cost compression.
00:33:22.510 - 00:33:42.740, Speaker D: Kind of because you're like, okay, this is like ethereum but fast. But then immediately you ask the next question like, okay, but it's also ethereum. So wait a second. Do I invest in ethereum, the base layer or this thing on top? And it's just again, I think they'll all be successful and fine over time. I'm just trying to take the most left bell curve sort of explanation there.
00:33:43.750 - 00:33:45.810, Speaker C: It is called Bell curve. The podcast.
00:33:46.870 - 00:34:14.110, Speaker D: Yeah. Miles, could I actually call on you and Michael? I'm assuming you probably have some opinion on this as well as an investor in optimism, not financial advice, but do you want to break down? Because, Miles, we were kind of talking about this a little bit and you have a tweet about how you would categorize the revenue and expenses for L2. And if you want, I can actually pull up I've got it somewhere here. But if you want to start to walk us through and then I can find this tweet. Sure, man.
00:34:14.260 - 00:34:52.714, Speaker B: I think it was in response someone was saying that roll ups don't have operating costs. And I think we were kind of pushing back on that and saying that their PNL actually doesn't look that much different than a layer one. In the future, once they have actually decentralized these sequencers, maybe not as much as actually bootstrapping a validator set like a layer one or an app chain would. But there will be some sort of cost there. So just running through it, I guess I had on the revenue side, you have obviously the margin on gas fees. That's what they're making today. Right.
00:34:52.714 - 00:35:45.642, Speaker B: So there's a call data cost to post it to L1. They take a margin on top and that's the basic bare bones revenue model. Then in the future, though, you're going to basically have to have for DeFi oriented roll ups, I would imagine there will be a decentralized sequencer set. You're either going to be bootstrapping your own decentralized sequencer set and paying them somehow or you're going to be renting access to a shared sequencer set from like an Espresso or an Astria and they will be secured by say, Eigen layer restaking ETH or maybe some other token. And you're going to have to incentivize them to take on that additional slashing risk. Right. And so I think at the end it looks like on the cost side, you still have that call data side.
00:35:45.642 - 00:36:44.254, Speaker B: You can call that either like a rev share with ethereum or cost of goods sold. You're going to have some sort of rev share likely with the sequencer set. So if you're making a 10% margin on gas fees, then maybe that goes down to a 5% margin and that's how you're incentivizing people to take on that risk of restaking. Right? And then if you go a click deeper, what we're seeing like Skip protocol is doing for Osmosis right now, I think we'll see that expand into the roll up side, which is basically incorporating some sort of way to internalize the mev that's generated on your roll up through an auction. And so I think longer term, on the revenue side, it's the gas margins, it's the mev auction proceeds. If it's a roll up app chain, then it could have app revenue. And then on the cost side, like today, you've got the cost of posting data.
00:36:44.254 - 00:37:19.210, Speaker B: There's going to be some sort of revenue share with a sequencer set or some sort of token incentives with a sequencer set, and then you've got normal token liquidity incentives. So I call that like CAC. And you've got what we're seeing now with Arbitrum. You're going to have to pay for grants and dev costs out of a foundation at some point. So, yeah, I was just saying, I think the P LS will you can kind of flush them out right now. And to say that it's zero operating costs, I think that's probably unrealistic.
00:37:20.110 - 00:37:31.440, Speaker A: Miles I followed all of that except for I have one question there. Where would you bucket on A-P-L incentives for other protocols? Where do you bucket that?
00:37:32.370 - 00:38:34.426, Speaker B: I would bucket that into cost of acquisition, not cogs. No, I would say token incentives are for the most part an acquisition cost. I've had some back and forth like the Lido team on whether their token incentives to say like the curve pool is really yeah, to me that seems like you're trying to maintain liquidity and that sounds like more like you're not trying to acquire those curve users or those curve LPs anymore. Right. You're just trying to get them to keep their liquidity there to keep your product functional. But apart from that, if liquidity is core to your value prop like Lido, you could argue that it's cogs. But for most other circumstances, I think you're really incentivizing the supply side to come in and make user experience better or you're just trying to get new users into the platform somehow.
00:38:34.618 - 00:38:54.338, Speaker C: I've always thought that liquidity incentives would also fall into effectively CAC, not maybe in the traditional sense of CAC, but it is essentially rewards for customers, discounts rewards incentives, which is all part of broadly like marketing spend in a way which isn't really historically cogs.
00:38:54.514 - 00:38:56.600, Speaker B: Yeah, totally agree.
00:38:57.550 - 00:39:27.538, Speaker D: Yeah, it'll be interesting. A big question on there that I still have and exploring right now with Hasu is basically what's the roadmap for decentralizing your sequencer and what is the model going to be for? And like, Astria and Espresso are kind of the two that have put forth different models there and it's kind of unclear. I think they're both promising, but we'll just have to see how it ends up shaking out.
00:39:27.624 - 00:39:47.400, Speaker B: Regardless, you're going to have to pay for it. Right. And that was kind of my point right now is like, sure, the sequencer is pure profit or minus the call of posting data, but those margins will get eaten away by actually having somebody else do the work for you instead of being a company running this.
00:39:49.290 - 00:39:53.278, Speaker D: Absolutely. What's up, Yano?
00:39:53.394 - 00:40:00.838, Speaker A: I was going to pivot us into Mev. I'd love for you to give an overview on Mev stuff, if you're up for it.
00:40:01.024 - 00:41:06.518, Speaker D: Yeah. So there was a pretty large exploit this week in Mev land, somewhere to the tune of $25 million, which was kind of a very complicated sandwich attack. So this has to do with a bug in the MEB boost relay, but basically there are kind of two parts to the exploit and Miles, you can kind of correct me here on some of this stuff, but basically there was sort of a malicious Validator. The attacker, whoever this person or entity was, deposited the amount of ETH that was required 32 E to set up a Validator. They waited like the eight days or whatever it was, and a bunch of core to PBS, right. Which the relay system that we have now, which was pioneered by Flashbots, is like a trial fix for eventually PBS is going to be enshrined in Ethereum, but right now we use relays. And the core function of that is so that the Proposers, which are the Validators, are not able to see the contents of the block.
00:41:06.518 - 00:41:51.630, Speaker D: And then these builders are separate entities which there's frankly like a lot of concentration in. And they're pretty much like large kind of hedge funds that build these block. And then Searchers will submit bundles which are smaller kind of sets of transactions to the builders. The builders build them and they get passed along via relay to the Proposer. And again, the key thing there is that what goes along the relay is the block header. So there's an understanding of how much profit is in that block, but you don't actually get to see the contents of that block. So what ended up happening here was there was some sort of bug or this Validator is able to exploit this design, see the contents of the block and actually reorder the transactions and steal the Mev.
00:41:51.630 - 00:42:47.438, Speaker D: This is the part where, to be honest, this is kind of a live exploit. So I'm not 100% sure what the connection was, but what allowed them to do is to understand some details about some strategies that searchers had way further down in the Mev sort of value chain. And one very common form of Mev, which I would categorize as a harmful form of Mev is sandwiching. So if you have a transaction that takes place, you reorder the transactions that you buy before the transaction, you sell after the transaction, the user, you kind of get screwed. But for mev searchers, it's atomic arbitrage, so riskless profit. What ended up the sophisticated attacker essentially set traps for some of these Sandwich bot searchers in some very kind of like low liquidity pools. And they baited these searchers into Sandwiching and taking these transactions.
00:42:47.438 - 00:43:02.838, Speaker D: And the end result of that was that they ended up draining, I think it was four searchers, four or five searchers to the tune of $5 million each. So Miles, correct me if I left out some of the technicalities there.
00:43:02.924 - 00:44:15.274, Speaker B: No, that's basically it. I think he had to set two traps. He had to, first of all, basically set up a trap for these searchers so that they thought they were seeing a really profitable mev opportunity that that's what they were going to bid enough basically to win the block based off of what they were seeing. And so I think he basically let them have a small win like a couple of days before this so that they knew that the strategy was profitable and then set them up basically when he was ready to be the proposer for this big one. So that's the first, he had to trick the searchers into going after these basically booby trapped pools. Then the second piece is that he had to basically fool the relayer into thinking that he had returned a signed valid block header. And the relayer, this is the whole thing where privacy, the reason all of this happens off chain is because privacy is so hard to do on chain, basically have to bring this auction off chain.
00:44:15.274 - 00:45:06.160, Speaker B: You would have to encrypt all the transactions in the entire blockchain. But the relayer thought that it was getting a valid block, and so it revealed the contents and then it tried to post that to the network and couldn't valid. So the proposer says, okay, great, now I know all the contents of the block, I can see the searcher's strategies go in, I can do whatever I want with the block, basically. And so if that ever happens, none of this would ever work because the proposers would see the contents of the searcher strategies, replace it with their own every single time, and there would be no market for there would be no incentive to be a searcher at that point. If you're a searcher, at that point, you just go and become a validator, right? So you can do that for yourself.
00:45:06.530 - 00:45:16.660, Speaker A: But it seems like that's where things are trending. Is that mev? Eventually it seems like the incentive to be a searcher is going away. But you guys understand mev way better than I do.
00:45:17.350 - 00:45:29.254, Speaker D: There is a strong incentive to vertically integrate, but it's not between builders and proposers, it's between builders and searchers. And that is already happening. A lot of the big builders are essentially their own.
00:45:29.372 - 00:45:38.210, Speaker A: Yeah, but it seems like searchers are just going to be outcompeted by Validators? No, because they can't censor or reorder transactions and Validators can?
00:45:38.380 - 00:45:59.886, Speaker B: If flashbots is broken, then yes, but I don't think that's the case now. The whole point of separating it is to make the proposer as dumb as possible and get paid as much as possible for just saying yes. Looks good to me. It's all valid. But that's like the fear here is.
00:45:59.908 - 00:46:06.020, Speaker A: That I guess if Mev boost is actually working as it should work, then the searchers are fine. Yeah. Okay.
00:46:08.550 - 00:46:48.640, Speaker D: Point of history just to illustrate why relayers are really needed is what they're trying to do. The point of this design is to avoid centralization and collusion at the validator level. So if you rewind the clock to the way it used to work before the merge, it was mining and there were these big mining operators. There were like five or six mining operators. And when you only have like five or six entities, then you don't really need infrastructure like relays or things like that because those five or six entities kind of can just trust each other. They don't need some kind of enshrined mechanism designed to make them trust each other. They have an economic incentive to do that.
00:46:48.640 - 00:47:49.570, Speaker D: What changed when we had the merge? We had a bunch of different Validators out there and the design of Ethereum wants to make sure that one tiny little validator out in Arkansas or Ethiopia or know has the same that they're not disadvantaged by not being in one of these large speaking pools, for instance. So really the point of these relays is to make it very easy. Right. The only thing that proposer is allowed to see is the actual reward for doing that. And the whole point of this design is so that the 10%, the smaller groups of validators can communicate in the same way with the large actors in the space, in the same way that the large actors would intercommunicate with one another. That's kind of like the whole point of relay. And then eventually, just to repeat what I said, these off chain sort of solutions which are these relays are going to be replaced by PBS, which is enshrined within Ethereum.
00:47:49.570 - 00:47:53.234, Speaker D: That's like a year away.
00:47:53.272 - 00:48:05.698, Speaker B: I think though, the challenge with enshrining it is because it's really hard to bring it into the protocol and still keep the contents of those blocks private until the moment that they're basically submitted on chain.
00:48:05.874 - 00:48:32.800, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like there were kind of two camps here. One camp was like I have very little sympathy towards the Mev bots and they should get wrecked because they were doing these sandwich attacks. And then there's like another bucket of folks who call the flashbots drainer like a malicious actor and thinks that they should get punished or return the funds or whatever. What bucket do you guys fall into there?
00:48:37.750 - 00:49:15.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I think no one really feels bad for sandwichers getting sandwiched. And I think that's fine. I think there are very valid concerns. Basically a lot of problems we thought we had solved could not be as buttoned up as we thought they were, at least on the revealing content side. And yeah, I'd say it's malicious enough that I think they slashed the validator. But that's kind of the problem with the 32 E. You're slashed like four E or something like that and you just told $20 million.
00:49:20.450 - 00:49:51.962, Speaker D: Yeah. So basically you're not posting enough collateral. I'm in agreement with you, Miles. I think, look, nobody's going to it's like playing the world's smallest violin for, frankly, like kind of a pretty strategy that's supposedly run by very sophisticated so optically. Yeah, like no one's shedding any tears. But I do think there's a question of integrity in the systems. People want to be able to trust that when you submit your bundles and blocks to relays that you're not going to get exploited there.
00:49:51.962 - 00:50:02.010, Speaker D: And that is foundational to how blocks are mined or created in ethereum today. And you don't want to undermine trust in those systems.
00:50:03.310 - 00:50:04.970, Speaker B: Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead, Michael.
00:50:05.710 - 00:50:24.350, Speaker C: I was just going to say that was like my one question coming out of this is like okay, it feels like mev is kind of this ever expansive set of learnings and lessons and strategies. Do we feel like this is now going to be something that's tested and tried more often or do we feel like this is going to be something that is more regularly occurring?
00:50:24.510 - 00:51:27.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing my short answer is probably yes, but my second order effect, I think is it know. I think Justin was on Bell Curve, the mev version, the other day and he was talking about mev burn. And I think that that does make actually a lot of sense. And this could accelerate sort of the push of burning the mev portion of the block rewards. Again, I always say no one's looking out for the common ETH holder, but I do think that obviously that would accrue a lot of value to any sort of ETH holder. But it would also kind of get rid of this almost lottery system where if you win the lottery, then on the most valuable block of the week, then it skews all these sort of APRs and averages way up. But it also provides a lot of incentive that if you are the proposer and you can figure something out, then you can run off of the funds.
00:51:27.510 - 00:51:37.020, Speaker B: Burning the mev would actually probably have solved this. Right. You never have to worry about proposer shenanigans again.
00:51:38.030 - 00:52:07.326, Speaker D: Yeah. To just sort of round out that explanation because it's a little bit of a technical explanation. There's an incentive to pool in ethereum because the way that validators are chosen, which who gets to mine with block is totally random. I think there are like 550,000 validators. So it's like a relatively low percentage that you end up winning. So you kind of have this if law of large numbers and averages. If you sort of pool your power together, then there's more of a steady stream of sort of income.
00:52:07.326 - 00:52:41.886, Speaker D: So you have this incentive to pool, but then the collateral that you post to your pool is relatively small compared to a gigantic payout. Right? In this case, $20 million is nothing on the 32 E or whatever that you're required to actually stake. So there are just some kind of weird incentives there at the consensus level. But the Flashbots team is super smart. I know they're hard at work trying to make sure that this doesn't happen again. And actually there was a I want to maybe tease a little bit without giving everything away. There was a really matt Cutler also.
00:52:41.886 - 00:53:37.634, Speaker D: He's the CEO at Block Daintive who's, like, very deep in the weeds of MEB himself, and he runs a relay and a block builder. And there was a very interesting there's, like, a very long discussion to be had, and it was had, and it will be out on this week's Bell Curve about kind of the merits of Flatbots runs their relay for free. And Matt's sort of argument is that infrastructure at the ethereum level, especially off chain infrastructure that the protocol depends on, should not be taken for granted. There should be strong economics to ensure that they keep doing that. There are very good arguments on both sides of that debate, but that's a little teaser. I got to stick around to listen. All right, you know what? This is kind of a feel good story, actually.
00:53:37.634 - 00:54:16.286, Speaker D: This Was The Euler DFI recovery. So this was, I think it was the largest crypto recovery of all time, about $200 million. The hacker appears to have been doxxed as well, which you can find if you want to look it up, but I'm not going to repeat that stuff here. But, yeah, it ended up being I guess it was kind of a happy ending in that the oiler team sort of got their funds back. So definitely props to them. I'd be curious what your guys kind of thoughts or takeaways were from this whole exploit and then the return of the funds. What do you think?
00:54:16.308 - 00:55:05.900, Speaker C: Mike I totally agree. I mean, it's a great outcome for the situation, frankly. I think this is a testament to why we need better systems for security monitoring, for bug bounties, for basically the entire system that protects these systems. And it's unfortunate that we haven't did at the point of doxxing the person holding their personal identity over their head to be able to get them to give the money back. And I know that there's a ton of teams building out this stuff and they're working really hard to make it more and more robust every single day. But I think that this is just more a testament to how we can prevent this from happening in the first place and the need for that being ever present with any sort of smart contract that has value in it.
00:55:06.850 - 00:55:40.860, Speaker A: I like the way you put it, Mike, that it's a feel good story. I'm not sure if this happens in other industries, but I feel like this happens time and time again in Crypto, where you have a lot of people who band together to help out. And you saw that with this, you shout out. Like, from what I heard, Tay jumped in like Hudson, Jameson, Sam Czan. Like I heard, there were just a number of different people who committed a lot of time to basically doing tracking this person down both on chain, but also off chain and getting this solved. So definitely a big win.
00:55:43.950 - 00:55:45.894, Speaker D: If you're talking you're on mute, buddy.
00:55:45.942 - 00:56:22.550, Speaker B: On mute here. Thank you. Yeah, I think everybody know Euler is a great I would know very positive sentiment among the communities, everybody's rooting for them. I think we see this a lot where hackers are good at getting the funds but very bad at laundering them and it's getting increasingly hard to do that. That's positive. But yeah, I would agree with Michael's take that. I think we're seeing more and more the limitations of audits and more and more of a need for ongoing monitoring tools.
00:56:22.550 - 00:57:36.990, Speaker B: I think circuit breakers are really interesting. They break composability, which is what has kind of stopped their adoption so far, but something like that, if we can get over that hump, the amount of pressure on audits would come down quite a lot. Right? And so yeah, stuff that we think about a lot with Osmosis too, we have IBC rate limiting now so that on any given day only 20% of the TVL of an IPC channel can move in or out. You can instantiate rules like that so that on one day, sure, maybe you don't double your TVL. Like if that was going to happen without sort of this sort of requirement, maybe people are told that they have to wait a few days to deposit more, but it's way more. You'd much rather have a slow onboarding of liquidity rather than allowing all the liquidity to exit on one day. So yeah, definitely some service providers out there working towards that vision shout out range in the cosmos ecosystem.
00:57:38.130 - 00:57:58.630, Speaker D: Do you guys wonder why these exploiters end up doing this? They can't do much with that money. They can't move that money out of crypto. Why don't they just do this? Why don't they just get handsomely paid for some bounty instead? Now you got this legal trouble and all this stuff. I mean, it's not been a good story for this exploiter.
00:57:59.210 - 00:58:26.922, Speaker C: Shout out one of our portfolio companies, Immunify, they build a bug bounty program. I know codeerine is another one that has the similar types of challenges. Challenges as in you get to compete to find bugs. And that's where you can turn from black or gray hat to white hat and also get paid for finding these things. I think that has become the industry norm and the incentive model is pretty strong, which is like 10% of the value is usually what the bug bounty.
00:58:26.986 - 00:58:27.600, Speaker B: Is.
00:58:29.970 - 00:59:01.970, Speaker C: And that's a payment that's legal and agreed to and boom. So I think there's still yeah, no, that we just have to make that more the industry norm. Every single technology trend, you have different security standards, different security models that you gravitate towards when it's a centralized system. Everybody's got firewalls. Miles, to your point, firewalls are great, but what are you going to do if something gets passed it?
00:59:01.980 - 00:59:03.098, Speaker B: Do you have to cut up the.
00:59:03.104 - 00:59:15.920, Speaker C: Circuit breaker and kill composability? We just have to find the new norms that work for this industry. Audits are a great start and necessary component, but only one that I think we need to find others to accompany it.
00:59:17.650 - 00:59:48.122, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we're at the stage of crypto where to use a way overly used example, but if you take the analogy of the internet in the early days, there was this overriding narrative of democratizing information and giving everyone access. It was going to level the playing field. And there were a whole bunch of other narratives that came started around that time too. And some of those narratives kind of got validated. In some cases they kind of did and others just didn't. There are a lot of supposed advantages of crypto. Right.
00:59:48.122 - 01:00:18.146, Speaker D: Composability is one of those. Transparency is one, immutability are others. And maybe some of those narratives end up coming totally true. Maybe others are slightly less true. Like Cosmos is definitely doing a lot of experimentation with Async composability and maybe for actually same with ETH L2s. Right? So maybe we discover like, hey, composability is really cool, but maybe it's actually like Async composability is kind of like 80 20 rule, really good. Async is just good enough.
01:00:18.146 - 01:00:43.286, Speaker D: So I think it's yeah, all this stuff is basically being the trade offs are being figured out in real time. We'll probably knock some of those narratives off, but then we'll figure out the ones that end up existing and really matter long run. Yeah. Trying to think, guys, if we have any oh, maybe we could just end ask everyone to put their speculator hats back on. But we've got framework.
01:00:43.318 - 01:00:45.162, Speaker A: Lawyers are going to love this one.
01:00:45.296 - 01:00:49.660, Speaker D: Yeah. Adam's, like Michael, there's a lot of financial advice in this last.
01:00:52.530 - 01:00:54.510, Speaker C: No, there isn't. There is none.
01:00:55.490 - 01:00:56.640, Speaker D: None at all.
01:00:57.730 - 01:00:58.094, Speaker A: Okay.
01:00:58.132 - 01:01:11.346, Speaker D: But I do want to get your guys perspective because we've got the major Shanghai upgrade, or I guess CHAPELLA as it's being labeled, which is coming up relatively soon. Sorry, I should know the exact date off the top of my head, but.
01:01:11.368 - 01:01:13.330, Speaker C: It'S I think it was April twelveTH.
01:01:13.670 - 01:01:14.274, Speaker A: Next one.
01:01:14.312 - 01:01:14.994, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:15.192 - 01:02:08.520, Speaker D: Okay, so maybe it. Makes sense to do this now, because next Friday we're going to be talking about the aftermath and what it ended up looking like. But the big question that has caused an enormous amount of debate is what is the impact going to be on people taking their funds out of unstaking their ethereum? And again, there's kind of a bear in a bull case for this. And the bear case is, hey, there's an enormous amount of ethereum that's been locked in this contract for a long time. People are going to want liquidity and there's going to be significant sell pressure on ethereum. The bull case is, and I don't think these are mutually exclusive, but you are now going to derisk what has henceforth been hence previously been a major risk, right? And now people know that when you stake an ethereum, you can withdraw that stake. And that actually could lead to more ethereum being staked actually over time.
01:02:08.520 - 01:02:28.540, Speaker D: So I guess my question to all of you, if you had to put your guessing caps on, is what do you think the immediate thanks. Don't have any tinfoil cats today, just your speculator cap. But if you had to guess, what do you think the short term impact of this is going to be? And then longer run.
01:02:32.530 - 01:03:16.410, Speaker C: My perspective is, and this doesn't have anything to do with the value of it, this is more just a comment around the entire ecosystem. I think there will be a lot that happens over the first couple of days. So keep in mind the upgrade is happening next week. But so much of the ETH is being staked not directly on validator nodes. It's being staked in ecosystems like Lido where you get an actual liquid staking token out of it. The LSTs have been liquid for years now. So you've actually had liquidity to the three nines or two nines worth of liquidity via curve if you wanted to sell those assets.
01:03:16.410 - 01:03:59.186, Speaker C: So that is kind of like not part of the ecosystem that could be removing and selling or removing, withdrawing and doing whatever with it. I do think that there's an element, frankly, of taxes where if you've been earning staking rewards and those are now liquid, there's going to be a tax income hit. Granted, that doesn't mean you have to sell the assets to cover the tax bill immediately. It just means that there will be taxes factored in. I think that's probably one of the biggest structural things that needs to be recognized and it'll probably be a little bit wonky right around the upgrade. It doesn't seem like Lido or any of the other liquid staking providers are going to be ready to go. They need to go through their own upgrade path.
01:03:59.186 - 01:04:48.562, Speaker C: And last we read, Lido is targeting May for their upgrade to be able to withdraw from state ETH. So I think a lot of this is also going to happen over the course of the next couple of months, not necessarily the next couple of days following the upgrade. But yeah, it'll probably be a little bit wonky. Like I said, over the short term, medium term, I think it'll kind of dissipate and this will be just generally a catalyst, as you were saying, Mike, to more staking activity coming on board. I know of a lot of so here's another example. We as a fund can put our assets into something like a state ETH, but then we get Steeth back. For instance, there's a lot of tax complexity when it comes to moving that ETH into Steeth.
01:04:48.562 - 01:05:49.210, Speaker C: Not to mention Steeth is a rebalancing token where you're earning more tokens every single day, sure you can wrap it. And that is another complexity because each one of these, in the most conservative view of tax guidance, is a taxable event. So unless you're underwater with your ETH purchases or at par with your ETH purchases, you're going to incur a tax income when you swap those assets from ETH to Steve. When you stake through a centralized provider like Coinbase, and it could be any provider but a centralized, staking provider like a custodian like Coinbase, you don't get a token back. And when you don't get a token back, that doesn't incur a tax hit. Now, probably most of the institutions that are staking are not going to want to or that own ETH that want to stake are not going to want to incur a tax hit as well. When you receive the liquid rewards every single month from the centralized custodial staking, you do have a tax income element, but those rewards are liquid.
01:05:49.210 - 01:06:13.170, Speaker C: So there's just this whole kind of perspective of do we think ETH staking percentage will go up or down following this upgrade? Our belief is it's going to go up over the medium to long term, probably by a large margin because of the effect of derisking, mostly from an institutional perspective. And a lot of that I think, will aggregate into the custodial staging environment.
01:06:14.710 - 01:07:21.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have a lot to add. I think the tax considerations are a great point. I'll be just very curious to see what the withdrawal queue looks like and how it evolves over the first couple of weeks. And then I think one thing that's exciting is that we actually might have some rational price discovery with the LST tokens now that you actually understand your liquidity risk, like you understand exactly how much time to maturity it takes to redeem these tokens and make them liquid. So yeah, I think that will be interesting, but overall, couldn't agree more. It just derisks the concept of staking so much and it will be interesting to see just how many players come off the sidelines. Maybe not as maybe a little bit muted because of the market environment, but over a year or two, or whenever activity speculation starts to come back from sort of the most conservative participants.
01:07:21.130 - 01:07:32.750, Speaker B: This kind of opens the door to staking for them. So yeah, expecting it to be a little weird in the beginning, but overall very bullish.
01:07:34.290 - 01:08:25.150, Speaker C: One other just kind of secondary effect of this change. Let's assume that staking rate goes up as we're describing over the next twelve ish months. What also happens, unless there is a commensurate increase in activity or fees flowing through the network, is that staking rate, the percentage of rate returned goes down. So there's an inverse relationship to that. And Hal Press has talked about this a bit on Twitter of just like, it's going to be interesting where you get more stake, which is probably good for network health, more participation in the ecosystem, but at the same time staking rate as a percentage return goes down. I think that's going to be one of the most interesting things to follow over the next twelve months as we see these changes play out. That's just something that we're tracking.
01:08:25.650 - 01:08:34.578, Speaker B: As soon as it goes down, you'll be able to restake it with Eigen layer, take on a little bit more risk, and then get those numbers back up.
01:08:34.744 - 01:08:35.460, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:08:36.230 - 01:09:45.890, Speaker D: Man, that's going to be interesting because I was listening to Tarun in one of his I can't remember one of his talks, but he was excited about one of the things that restaking allows you to do is basically kind of tranche out different, know, different portions of risk that you'd like to take around E stake. And I think Miles, it was you who was telling me that in one of those protocols, maybe it was elementfi that allowed you to strip out the yield between kind of principal versus variable yield. Everyone thought you were going to take the safe principal yield, but crypto is a bunch of degen. So it was like people just funneled into the higher rate the variable stuff and it will be interesting. I think it's going to attract an enormous amount of demand as soon as you kind of tranch out the I don't really know how you would do that, assign riskier or slightly less risky parts of that yield. But yeah, I think a lot of innovation and I think a lot of innovation and definitely maybe a little cause for just something to keep an eye on is some of the financial engineering that goes on with E staking yields.
01:09:45.970 - 01:10:03.770, Speaker B: Exciting and terrifying. You could see restaking index, right? It's got a trance that's just regular staked e. Then you've got your safe restaking options like Arbitrum optimism, and then it gets really wonky towards the junior tiers.
01:10:05.330 - 01:10:35.458, Speaker C: Miles, you were talking about it earlier when talking about operating costs, but I do think that one of the things that's going to be really substantially mispriced from a user perspective is the additional slashing risk that you take on by participating in one of those ecosystems. The slashing risk of being in a Lido pool is fairly small like you may see a lower return, but you're not going to lose your state. Whereas when it comes to actually restaking, there is a principal asset.
01:10:35.634 - 01:11:05.758, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And I think that needs to be a lot of thoughtful work being done both on the validators who are going to be opting in on behalf of their depositors to understand what they need to see in terms of return to justify the risk. And there's going to be a lot of work and negotiation on middleware side to say, okay, here's what we have to pay. Here's the bare minimum we have to pay to incentivize people to take on this risk.
01:11:05.854 - 01:11:06.500, Speaker A: Right.
01:11:07.910 - 01:11:17.570, Speaker D: I personally can't wait until next bull cycle. There are yields of only 500% and it's going to be well, much less than it was last cycle. These ones are sustainable, baby.
01:11:18.790 - 01:11:21.186, Speaker C: 1000% APY. Let's go.
01:11:21.368 - 01:11:37.562, Speaker D: 1000%. Yeah, absolutely. All right, guys, this has been a really fun one. I think it's a good place to leave it here. Miles, thanks for subbing in here and joining the roundup crew. Nice little season three, depending on how.
01:11:37.616 - 01:11:40.570, Speaker A: Upset Santiago and Vance are at my early comments.
01:11:46.370 - 01:11:51.786, Speaker D: Are you willing to shave your head? Miles, are you willing to shave your head? Going to factor in I'm the 6th.
01:11:51.818 - 01:11:54.590, Speaker B: Man of Belkir if I can hop off the bench.
01:11:57.730 - 01:11:58.814, Speaker A: Exactly. Love it.
01:11:58.852 - 01:12:00.640, Speaker D: All right, guys, this is a fun one.
01:12:01.330 - 01:12:02.780, Speaker C: It was. See you.
