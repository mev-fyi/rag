00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.714, Speaker A: And something like restaking will make that a lot more clear where it's like, yeah, I got my ETH staked on l one, but I'm also staking on a bridge. I'm also getting these oracle tokens. Like, it's money. And that is the main thing that I think at some point in time, why ETH will actually flip bitcoin is because it's actually used as money. Like the hard money meme of, like, you just lock it away. I think that's good for some people. But over the long term, the assets that are used more as money will just have a more heavier supply sink and will just trade a lot lighter.
00:00:27.842 - 00:00:58.782, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, Ethereum, L2s, and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:00:58.782 - 00:01:25.798, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right, guys, on with the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views, and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal.
00:01:25.798 - 00:01:36.426, Speaker B: Now let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two advance, fellas. Welcome. How we doing?
00:01:36.608 - 00:01:40.380, Speaker A: Feeling good, feeling good. First one back.
00:01:40.830 - 00:01:59.330, Speaker B: I know, I know. Missed you guys. It's been a minute. It's been a wild start to the year. We got bitcoin etfs that finally got approved. Definitely shout out to James Sefert and Eric Balkunis, who have been the gurus, and it's been nice to see them active on crypto Twitter, tweeting out some of our memes. That's made me smile.
00:01:59.330 - 00:02:30.380, Speaker B: But we were just talking off air before we even get into bitcoin ETF and flows and that whole discussion. What's your guys sense of going into this year, we're just sort of chatting off air about. I mean, even if you bring it all the way back to last year, everyone was so bearish. Going into 23 turned out to be quite a good year. I feel like at the tail end of this last year, people got extremely bullish and everyone accepted I was going to be a soft landing. And now maybe it looks like it's going to be a bit bumpier than that. So how are you guys feeling generally, on the more macro side of things?
00:02:32.930 - 00:03:04.006, Speaker A: Feel pretty good. We were just talking about, we all follow Tom Lee, who is either the most hated person on Wall street or the one person who gets it right. There's kind of no in between with Tom Lee, and he works for Fundstrad and he's kind of known as this permeable. And his whole philosophy for this year is that the s and P is going to 5200. It's at 4700 right now. So that'd be a new all time high. But the first half of the year.
00:03:04.028 - 00:03:05.154, Speaker B: Is going to be choppy.
00:03:05.282 - 00:03:53.706, Speaker A: You have a lot of just uncertainty with the election, uncertainty with rate cuts, uncertainty with QT turning into QE. But ultimately, if you have a long term perspective, it's really hard to not be bullish. And what's the bear case for crypto after the nuclear winter of 2022? The implosion of all the mainstay characters. We just kind of like, randomly stall out and don't hit a new all time high. That just seems like you have to play for the most likely outcome, and that just doesn't feel like the most likely outcome. And so there's always things that could happen, surprises. But I think if you continue to see Trump election odds rally, you're going to see risk rally alongside it, because that is just like certainty for the risk markets looking into 2025.
00:03:53.706 - 00:04:14.720, Speaker A: And I've always been surprised of the people who are like, we're playing for the 2024 bull cycle. If we have a new administration, it's like 2024 to 2028, lower interest rates. Kind of like the nihilistic capitalism that Trump represents, whether you agree with it or not, is what's coming.
00:04:16.610 - 00:04:18.026, Speaker B: What do you think, Michael?
00:04:18.218 - 00:05:05.914, Speaker C: I think generally we're probably going to have a pretty bumpy ride the first quarter, maybe the first two quarters, just as people are starting to figure out what 2024 means crypto wise. I think there's a lot of positive catalysts, macro, there's also a lot of positive asymmetric catalysts. Maybe we get resolution in Ukraine, maybe we get some of the clarity on where the government is going election wise. And I think there's a lot of things that could become more clear over time, so that'll help. But it does seem like it's going to be bumpy for the first couple of months, which is fine. I think that's just part of election cycles as well, is the election year itself is usually one that's not the cleanest and the clearest, at least from the outset.
00:05:05.962 - 00:05:12.080, Speaker B: Historically, yeah. Do you guys still see macro being in the driver's seat for crypto? For the most part?
00:05:13.830 - 00:05:52.166, Speaker A: To a certain extent, yeah. I mean, you're either dealing with headwinds or tailwinds. And for what we're looking at with crypto, at least hikes turn into rate cuts, QT turns into QE, Democrats turn into Republicans. It's always in the background, and it's been a long time coming as well. The four consecutive 75 basis point increases relative to even just staying stagnant with where they are is a huge shift in just in psychology of market participants.
00:05:52.358 - 00:07:08.870, Speaker C: The one thing I will say on that, though, is the market is pricing in at least where it currently stands. And let's assume typical price cuts, rate cuts, unless there's some massive endogenous shock like a bank blows up or something, where they actually need to cut rates hundreds of basis points in a single meeting, the typical rate cycle is not more than 25 bips per meeting. And the way that the markets are pricing current rate cuts for 2024 is that we have one meeting coming up in a few weeks, probably a 0% chance that they cut rates there. They're expecting that March could be that first rate cut, but then if the typical rate process holds, they're expecting rate cuts every single meeting for the rest of the year. I just fundamentally don't believe that's going to be true. And so I think the markets are expecting more rate cuts than we're actually going to see, which in and of itself is a difference of where guidance is versus where expectations are, versus where things actually land. So that, I think, is a recognition that the markets will have to digest probably over the first six months as we start to see what March actually turns into, what April turns into, and then June, July.
00:07:08.870 - 00:07:41.470, Speaker C: So one thing about markets, which is tough, is there's directionality, but there's also guidance and expectations. And so you could have positive directionality of there are going to be rate cuts in 2024, but if everybody's expecting it to be 300 basis points, it only comes out at like 200 basis points. That's a negative change in and of itself. Even though there's 200 basis point cuts, just because it wasn't what people were expecting, it's viewed as a negative. So that's the reason why I think it's going to get a little wonky.
00:07:41.890 - 00:08:06.518, Speaker B: I think that's a really good point. This discussion has started to crop up a little bit around even the bitcoin ETF. And I saw a chart or I saw someone tweeted out today like, hey, we had a trillion in inflows, but the price hasn't moved. Like, makes a lot of sense. But price did move. It moved over the last six months in anticipation of those flows. So it's kind of a meme in crypto because it's an immature market.
00:08:06.518 - 00:08:18.940, Speaker B: A lot of retail participants and stuff doesn't get priced in till pretty late. But in tradfi, things do get priced in. There is a known set of expectations, and performance relative to those expectations ends up mattering quite a bit.
00:08:19.310 - 00:08:26.462, Speaker C: Short term, it does. Short term, it's all about how you perform versus expectations. Longer term, it's about the direction of where things are.
00:08:26.596 - 00:09:04.374, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So I have a question for you guys on maybe zooming more in on the crypto side of things. How are you viewing? Like, I saw this tweet from Chris Berninski who was talking about private market valuations. So basically, private deals in crypto tripping over themselves to keep up with public market memes valuations and topic dujour unrecognizable from Q three 2023 tipping into borderline excess. So I would be curious what you think. I think my mental model, which is basically just like in 2023, we saw rock bottom post FTX.
00:09:04.374 - 00:09:39.240, Speaker B: And then I think something that confused a lot of people was the salana, call it like minibubble or something. And I think that was mean reversion from a massive dislocation in prices. And I think that maybe got people's animal spirits firing a little bit more than they otherwise should have at this point in the cycle. And now we're kind of like treading water. But it's interesting. You guys obviously do professional investors like I do a little bit of angel investing, and I've noticed valuations have changed a lot in the last three months. And I'm wondering if you guys think that's frothy and what do you guys think about that?
00:09:40.250 - 00:10:44.410, Speaker A: It's definitely frothy in the private markets, and I think if you break it down, what's happening is something like a say which has not unlocked any of the tokens that belong to investors or the team. They've done the airdrop, which is about one and a half billion, and then they've got the fully diluted, which is like seven or eight. And so projects are looking at that and saying, look, I should be worth four to 8 billion in the private markets because this thing is trading at 8 billion in the public markets. And that belies the fact that the unlocks have not happened yet. And what happened in 2022 is everyone was unlocked. And so the valuations reset very quickly because the public market comps were affected by just the stream of supply that was coming to market for the team and the investors. And so I think a lot of the private markets are benchmarked to, like Chris calls it memes, like FTV memes, which I think is pretty accurate.
00:10:44.410 - 00:11:42.314, Speaker A: Is that reflective of the real price of this, when only 10% of it is unlocked? Probably not. And so that's like the danger zone for investors when your comp is off and you're already admittedly not investing on fundamental value. If Celestia is making $75 a day and it's 20 billion FTV, you can't wire frame it from the fundamental perspective. And if you're using that as a comp, theoretically you should be willing to pay anything up to 20 billion to bench to get to the next celestial competitor. So I think it is a little bit off. And if you roll back the clock to something like DFI Summer, why did DFI summer not last longer than the April 2021 kind of peak? It was because of the unlocks. And so we're hyper dialed into what are unlocks going to look like for the major tokens that are coming to market this year for their unlocks.
00:11:42.314 - 00:11:58.130, Speaker A: Arbitrum, Celestia, whatever else, I think that'll dictate a lot of the private market valuations. But other than that, if you're a private market investor and you've got like a four year unlock schedule and you're investing right now, you're holding that thing through the next cycle.
00:12:00.790 - 00:12:41.200, Speaker C: A couple of things. First off, I think this is why we have cycles in crypto. It's not because of the happening. And sure, that's a meme that probably bolsters the front end of the cycle. It doesn't really fit the back end. The back end is all about liquidity and who's selling. And go figure that all of these tokens that raise at massive valuations have three year unlock cycles and that the unlock cycle for a lot of these tokens are going to start probably in twelve months, eight months, ten months from now, whenever that first year clip is, sometimes it's twelve months, sometimes it's 1824 months.
00:12:41.200 - 00:13:40.562, Speaker C: But then you start to get this drip feed of tokens over the next 36 months after that, where you slowly have, like, you build up a position and you're deciding whether or not you're an investor, and you have these things is marked at, I don't know, $12 billion fully diluted valuation. You're like, should I take some money off the table? And then things start to slide and now it goes down to ten and you're like, oh, man, I really need to take some money off the table now. And then your price action, because you're selling one or 2% of the protocol token from the seed round, pushes it down to like, eight or six. That's the type of cycle that I think happens actually quite frequently with a lot of these new layer ones, DFI summer. So I think of DFI summer as being basically like June 2020 to September 2020. And the reason why DFI summer didn't persist is because we lost interesting new food coins to go farm. But then DFI flatlined throughout fall 2020.
00:13:40.562 - 00:14:19.680, Speaker C: But it's that cycle from 2021 where people invested and raised money in the 1920 era. And then you had Avax, you had Salana, you had all the major kind of like, alt l ones that were unlocking during that 2021 and 2022 cycle. That was the liquidity that I think was the catalyst or part of the process of bringing things down. But I think we're going to start to see a ton more similar examples of this. Anything that's over a $5 billion ftv, expect that there's going to be some liquidity issues when everybody's trying to get out through the same door, just to get more specific.
00:14:20.050 - 00:14:36.862, Speaker A: So you can do things called non deliverable forwards to effectively try to hedge your unlocks ahead of time. And you can probably do this like three or four months ahead of that unlock. And it kind of makes the derivatives markets. And it's all settled on the derivatives markets.
00:14:36.926 - 00:14:40.566, Speaker B: Sorry, go for. Can you explain what that is? What's a non deliverable forward?
00:14:40.668 - 00:15:14.110, Speaker A: So what you're basically doing is you have the tokens and they're going to unlock, say, in like three or four months, you go to an OTC desk and you say, hey, I want to hedge this. And they say, okay, cool. Or maybe you do it yourself. And they say, okay, we're going to start shorting the perp for you and when your tokens become available, so to close a short, you need to deliver the physical tokens. That's concept of that. But while you're doing this, you're shorting the perp. People know that there's short interest on it.
00:15:14.110 - 00:15:52.970, Speaker A: You're also paying fees in some of these perps. I think in the first week that Celestia launched, it was like people were paying like 300% per year. Hedge this out. And so people see that, they'll try to squeeze the shorts, they'll try to get you to add more collateral and things like mobile coin. Remember when that blew up and that was the result of an investor trying to hedge unlocks? And so the volatility that comes with these unlocks is sometimes not just to the downside, sometimes it'll be like squeeze up and then gap down. But it just creates that environment of anxiety and volatility and nervousness around general unlocks.
00:15:53.310 - 00:16:52.894, Speaker C: But keep in mind, though, anyone who has two, three, 4% of this token is not doing this because frankly, they'd only be able to do it with about 5% of the total supply, like the size that you can put on. Also, the spread that these desks are charging is like 10%. If they're shorting the perp and they're quoting you one price, it's like, okay, the price is trading at $5 right now. You're going to pay the fees and we're going to quote you a fill rate of like 425 as you try to sell this. So it's massive spreads, they get to dictate the market, and you can only do this with single digit million dollars of volume, otherwise it's just too much to put on those contracts. So any of the major investors, I think, are just not able to do this or they're doing it over the course of years, where they just kind of roll a three month, let's call it $5 million, deliverable forward, and then they do it another $5,000,000.03 months later and then another 5 million, and it's kind of a way of rolling out of it.
00:16:52.894 - 00:16:56.370, Speaker C: But at that point, you might as well just twap and just sell spot.
00:16:56.710 - 00:17:11.830, Speaker A: Generally, I think it's a good idea for everyone to have a good sense of unlocks and it's like publicly available information. Token unlocks, I think, is a good website, and it's like one of the major components. What is the supply?
00:17:12.250 - 00:17:59.474, Speaker B: Yeah, you know what this reminds me of? I think we've mentioned it once or twice on the show before, but I don't know if you've ever heard Degen Spartan talk about why he thought that DeFi Summer came to an end and he actually put sushi swap as like a massive contributing factor because that's where you had like pool twos and super risky yield farming strategies going on. And it was just, there was such an incentive for liquidity if you were holding on to this super illiquid bag. The game theory was like, this is probably the best time I'm ever going to get to sell this stuff. So everyone dumped it at the same time. And maybe like a mini thing happened like that with blur as well, where it's like got these illiquid jpegs, there's going to be a massive liquidity event points, farming, all that stuff. So I'm going to dump it. It's good long term overall, you want more liquid markets, but in the short term could be dangerous.
00:17:59.602 - 00:18:52.086, Speaker C: I mean, to kind of pull it back to something we were previously talking about. James Heifer at Arab Kumas talk about how there is an interesting narrative around the inflows into these bitcoin etfs. The bigger thing and the harder thing to accomplish is to get etfs with sizable volume and therefore low enough spreads, because that's where it becomes an attractive way for traders to arbitrage this. Eventually you're going to have options on these etfs being able to have people who are probably trading like spot bitcoin with a balance of the reverse on the ETF side, and you're able to trade that spread. The liquidity here is ultimately what matters the most in the ETF world. And go figure that that's what matters most in these token worlds as well.
00:18:52.268 - 00:18:53.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:54.650 - 00:19:56.170, Speaker A: One more thing. The psychology of all this pulled together is like say your average l one is raising at one to two to maybe even $3 billion. Who knows? And you're kind of like doing this calculus of maybe if it trades like say this is still double, triple, or maybe if it's like near, that's like the floor, which is like a few billion. I think when you look at that and you look at what I would call just like the resounding success of these coin etfs, and sure, the price has not moved, but grayscale is dumping billions of dollars of bitcoin to resolidify their balance sheet. And a lot of the GBTC outflows are another component. Do you think the success of bitcoin with the CTF or things like eth that if these flows continue, the risk reward of that comparable to the private markets is basically the same. You have effectively the same way better liquidity.
00:19:56.170 - 00:20:22.020, Speaker A: You're not playing this game of like, oh, maybe in two or four, six years I'll be able to actually do something with this. It's no longer clear that the private markets are extremely undervalued. Whereas a year ago I thought that was the case. You had amazing projects raising at like 30, 40, 50 million fdv for the seed or the a. The minimum now is like 100.
00:20:22.390 - 00:20:54.282, Speaker B: I know, yeah. It's sort of a losing dynamic for everyone, even those founders. The expectations if you're raising at an inflated valuation are so high, you have to deliver so much. And inevitably, when there's some bump in the road or the next bear market or whatever, you're probably going to have to raise. Best case, not a down round, but basically same valuation, worst case a downround. That's what most people do. And that just sucks.
00:20:54.282 - 00:21:02.030, Speaker B: It's so brutal. It just wipes out a whole bunch of employees. Equity morale is terrible. I don't know, it's kind of a loose, loose.
00:21:02.690 - 00:21:34.620, Speaker A: I talked with a couple of other fund managers this week and their perspective was like, is it the right time to do venture right now? Maybe you sit out for six months and try to let it cool off. I think yes and no. I think what else is coming is generally like a crypto fund replenishment. It seems like most lps are pretty bullish, pretty open to investing, and you're going to have all the major funds re raise. And that doesn't do anything for the floor, it only increases it.
00:21:35.870 - 00:21:58.466, Speaker B: I know. I mean, it's kind know what we were talking about. The downside of this Trump nihilistic low interest rates capitalism is this like valuations that don't make sense and you have to figure out what you want to do about it. Because I agree. I don't think it's getting any less crazy from here. Probably base case maybe, is that it's stagnant for a little bit or chop sideways. But I don't know.
00:21:58.568 - 00:22:24.470, Speaker A: I mean, at the end of the day, the law of physics dictate that things are not going to go just like up only because there's only so much liquidity for people to get in and out. I think both Michael and I have just been very impressed by the etfs relative to basically everything else. If these flows increase, I think that's annualized like 25 to 50 billion of inflows.
00:22:24.630 - 00:22:51.838, Speaker B: Yeah, we're talking about real money. Let's talk about the etfs. I'd love to get your guys take. I don't know if you guys can see this from. This is Eric Balkunis, but you can actually see flows split out by the newborn nine, which is what he's been calling these new etfs. So the total net inflows, it looks like, is 1.2 billion.
00:22:51.838 - 00:23:19.146, Speaker B: It looks like now XGBTC would be 3 billion. They've also talked. Both Eric and James have talked quite a bit about the volume. Like the total volume now is over 11 billion traded, which is like a stupendous amount. There were analysts before these all launched that were predicting $10 billion worth of trading volume in the first year. So truly like a really record breaking. I mean, that was like a very bearish estimate, I would guess.
00:23:19.146 - 00:23:46.950, Speaker B: And then I guess you've got probably, like many predicted, you've got blackrock, the ibit, in the lead, over a billion dollars worth of assets now. So congratulations to Blackrock. Not a huge surprise there. Then you've got fidelity in a close second at 882, and bitwise in third place at 373,000,000. What's your guys take on the performance in sort of week one of the very positive.
00:23:48.090 - 00:24:31.602, Speaker C: I think it's no surprise that you see ishares fidelity at the top. Just think about their respective sales forces and what they're able to do from a marketing perspective, and just like, how much access they have. Phenomenal to see bitwise in third place. And I think that that hats off to them. They've been charging up the hill for how many years? Since 2017. And the recognition, I think, in this respect is pretty incredible to have fidelity or blackrock fidelity and then bitwise as the top three etfs. The thing that kind of boggles my mind is, okay, let's look at Grayscale in terms of net flows per day, and then let's look at it, volume per day.
00:24:31.602 - 00:25:35.154, Speaker C: And just keep in mind, probably going to mess this up, but I think bitwise is at 20 basis points or 24 basis points. Fidelity and Blackrock are in the 25 to 30 range. And they've got kickers where there's a certain amount of time and assets where there is no fees. Anyways, all of that to say Grayscale is at 150 basis points, and if you have net outflows of 450, but your volume is 1400, give or take, on day four, that means that people are still buying this, which in my mind makes no sense if you're a net new buyer. Why would you be buying Grayscale GBTC right now? I would have imagined like, grayscale is basically playing the game of sure, we expect billions to flow out, but we expect the mass majority of the 28 billion or 29 billion that we had to stay in. And we're only reducing our fees 25% down to 150 bips so that we can continue to make payments on the debt that we owe. And maybe we'll have more products eventually.
00:25:35.154 - 00:25:48.140, Speaker C: But people are going to just kind of be stuck in GBTC and that's the business game that we're playing. But it seems to me like there are new people coming into, like, I don't know if you guys have a different read, but that kind of boggles. My.
00:25:49.890 - 00:25:55.098, Speaker A: Mean, imagine what this looks like without GBTC net outflows.
00:25:55.274 - 00:26:26.630, Speaker C: Yeah, crazy for sure. Yeah, we can imagine what that would look like. And eventually the GBT outflows will stop. I think it'll probably be a period of time, like weeks to maybe months for it to continue to kind of bleed out, and then it'll asymptote towards some number, which we'll see. But I just mean, imagine what it would look like if GBTC's inflows were coming into Blackrock or fidelity, because there must be inflows if there's this much volume.
00:26:27.770 - 00:26:41.674, Speaker B: So just a couple quick responses. There one to just underscore the point about bitwise. For folks who don't know, one thing that might not even be apparent. Obviously bitwise is crypto native. They've been working on this for a long time. They just have such a great team. They really are.
00:26:41.674 - 00:27:20.360, Speaker B: This is like an example of the good guys winning. So shout out to bitwise. But the other point, and Michael, just in response to why Grayscale might be doing this, just listening to Eric and amount, they were coming in with such a stupendous head start. Like if you look at GLD, which is the primary ETF for gold, that's not an inexpensive product. There are many better ETF products for gold like IAU. But once you have that head start in Aum, and once volume starts to concentrate around an like institutions, the primary decision maker for them is going to be liquidity. So that's probably what they're banking on here.
00:27:20.970 - 00:27:56.130, Speaker C: So, yeah, totally understand. And it's not just direct inflows and outflows that create volume. It could be existing holders who want to put that up as collateral for something. Other people on the other side take that collateral and trade with it. So I completely understand that volume can come from other sources, but there is a multiple difference in terms of basically a five x difference in terms of where these fees are relative to the other major players. I don't know. It still boggles my mind that they're that high of fees.
00:27:57.750 - 00:28:17.446, Speaker B: I agree. Yeah. Ironically, actually, you could trace that. Why that is to the SEC's handling of this. Right? Because that's why GBTC was so successful, because they didn't allow an ETF and they kind of gave grayscale this head start. So just another thing to thank Gary.
00:28:17.478 - 00:28:35.920, Speaker C: Gensler and the whole cash create versus in kind create. There's going to be a lot of stuff that. I mean, that's the other thing too. I can't remember. I don't think we've talked about this, but proshares has come out with.
00:28:38.610 - 00:28:38.926, Speaker B: I.
00:28:38.948 - 00:29:19.950, Speaker C: Think it was van actor, maybe even somebody blackrock for fidelity, maybe came out with a covered call strategy ETF for bitcoin. Now, I mean, we're going to get like inverse strategies, we're going to get leveraged strategies. We're going to get in a few months. It sounds like there's potential that the 19 four b's for options on these etfs will go live, which means you can write options in traditional financial markets on basically bitcoin. So I think the diversity of product is about to explode. And this isn't even counting other assets other than BTC. And we'll see where that lands.
00:29:19.950 - 00:29:26.430, Speaker C: I mean, there. There's going to be a lot of things that come out and go live in the next six months.
00:29:26.500 - 00:29:57.402, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including salana, Sui, Ethereum, L2s and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:29:57.402 - 00:30:29.466, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right, guys, on with the show. What do you guys think about. I mean, it's been like we've been talking about Larry Fink, obviously, as soon as the iShares filing for the spot ETF became public. He's been talking more positively about crypto, know, conflict in the Middle east. He called crypto a flight to safety asset or something like that. But recently he's been really on the warpath about two things, which is the ETH ETF.
00:30:29.466 - 00:30:44.170, Speaker B: So he's very positive about an ETH ETF, and he's very positive. He loves this idea of tokenization. And actually, the direct quote, which sort of made me laugh, was tokenization cures solves all corruption.
00:30:46.750 - 00:30:51.978, Speaker A: Firsthand. That is not the case in the industry.
00:30:52.154 - 00:31:45.120, Speaker B: Yeah, me, you know, what do you think is the. Even just like this sounds silly, but if you look at the Van Eck Twitter account or the Franklin Templeton Twitter account about, like, they've got laser eyes on the Twitter account. They've given the. These were things that they seem small and stupid, but to me it just says this is a gradual attempt from tradfi to be more accepting and lean into crypto. I don't know, it doesn't seem like a small thing that a financial institution like that, like multiple trillions of dollars in Aum, would just allow laserise and the intern to take control of Twitter account. But do you guys think that this cycle, do you think this means anything? Like, is this materially going to change what types of institutions are involved in this cycle? Or is it just kind of like, yeah, he's doing the tour and they're going to say stuff like this.
00:31:47.010 - 00:32:40.126, Speaker C: I think it's. Honestly, it depends on who wins the bitcoin ETF race or the other etfs as well. I think right now, it's like the starting gun has been fired. You've got Blackrock and fidelity, obviously off to the races, GBTC competing, bitwise competing. Even Franklin Templeton, $1.5 trillion Aum, they're still competing, I think, eventually, and Eric and James have talked about this, a lot of people ultimately drop out if the bitcoin, if their etfs aren't profitable, or it's very clear that there are certain winners. I don't think people like Larry Fink are going to step out and make these types of claims, mostly because if you think about Larry Fink's track record, and we've talked about this before, but he has a pretty dark stain of ESG on his record over the last ten years.
00:32:40.126 - 00:33:00.834, Speaker C: And, I mean, that's falling apart and has been falling apart for the last few years, I think that he needs to try to find a new narrative and a new chapter that he's going to push forward. It could be tokenization, but the Franklin Templeton laserize, I think, is just like, at least for the time being, a marketing gambit.
00:33:00.962 - 00:33:31.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I much prefer the Blackrock commercial. Hair neat, guy in a suit, soft jazz playing in the background. He's explaining why bitcoin is the digital gold that everyone's been looking. It's like these products are not bought, they're sold. And Blackrock Salesforce and all of the commercials that they're doing, I think are hugely positive for the space. And we have something for right now. Buy the bitcoin ETF, buy the ETH ETF, blah, blah, blah.
00:33:31.258 - 00:33:59.900, Speaker A: But there needs to be a forward looking. What does this become in several years? And that's like the tokenization pitch. It's kind of know chat. GBT is the app for now for people to try. And then in the future, we're going to be replacing jobs and creating robots. You need something for now, and then you need to pitch the long term vision. And Larry Fink is dialed in and to point, like, if the political winds are blowing in a different direction and you're the ESG guy, that's going to be.
00:33:59.900 - 00:34:08.620, Speaker A: He's a, he's a savvy operator, and he's starting to calibrate. Hmm. Maybe I should reposition this a little.
00:34:11.150 - 00:34:19.594, Speaker B: I've that commercial, we can link it in the show notes. It's a really good, it's like totally different way to market bitcoin to a completely different audience.
00:34:19.722 - 00:34:23.950, Speaker C: And the way I describe it is, it's boomer juice.
00:34:24.550 - 00:34:42.120, Speaker A: It reminds me of all the other ETF commercials I've seen. Like, vague, safe, you kind of know what's going on. Seems like a nice, that, that goes so like, I love Franklin Templeton, but I don't think the laser eyes are bringing in any new people.
00:34:42.730 - 00:35:06.394, Speaker B: No, it's not. That's what I think is you're, I mean, think about how bureaucratic an institution like Franklin Templeton is to allow that to happen. The level of buy in that you, it tells, what it sort of tells me also is like they see a different customer than Blackrock. I mean, you could infer that, right. That's a leap.
00:35:06.442 - 00:35:47.942, Speaker C: But I will say Jenny Johnson, who's the CEO of Franklin Templeton, has come out, been on stage talking about tokenization, talking about how is the future of finance institutionally. I think Franklin is ahead of the curve in terms of where most financial institutions are currently looking at the landscape right now. And I know they've got a crypto venture arm that we've talked to. They're very much in the weeds, investing in things, building things. So not to say that they're not doing anything, they definitely are, but just the laser eyes to the point, it's not like they're bringing in a bunch of new people who are going to buy etfs with laserize. That's just pandering to the existing audience.
00:35:48.086 - 00:36:34.970, Speaker B: You're right. I totally agree. All right, I want to actually move on to, while we've all been very focused on the etfs and markets and stuff like that these last couple of weeks, there's actually been some pretty sizable movement on the regulatory front. And there is like a more immediate case to dial into that's relevant for crypto, which is coinbase versus the SEC. But actually there's a much larger, extremely important administrative doctrine, the Chevron doctrine, which is talking about getting overturned. So can we actually start at the Chevron doctrine level? Because I think that's going to inform more of the microcosm of the SEC versus coinbase. So can you guys just kind of give like an overview of what this doctrine is and why it's so critical?
00:36:35.470 - 00:37:30.794, Speaker C: Yes. So Chevron was a case, I think, from 1984 that went to the supreme court and is pretty innocuous case that was decided basically in favor of the NRDC, which is National Resource Defense Fund or defense coalition. I can't remember what the last word is. Council, but council, yeah, basically the Chevron doctrine, as it became known afterwards. And also, I am not a lawyer, nor do I know very much about this other than what we have read about this doctrine. But the doctrine basically says when there's ambiguity in how the laws are to be interpreted, the ambiguity is up to the administrators who are in charge of enforcing that law. And so this is the executive branch.
00:37:30.794 - 00:39:07.580, Speaker C: You could think of the NRDC as looking at natural resource regulations, and obviously chevron comes up against a number of those things in their creation of oil and gas products. But the idea is, if there's ambiguity, it's kind of like tie goes to the administrator in terms of how to look at these different rules and regulations. And in the case of overturning it, there are a couple of cases, actually, that are kind of coalescing around whether or not that is fair or whether or not that is, in the eyes of the defense, an overreach of the executive branch to have more powers than the constitution originally sought to give. And overturning the chevron doctrine would be something that probably looks to have a court adjudicate, whether or not these different ambiguities in terms of how rules and laws are interpreted and then enforced, have a court system decide the interpretation of them as that relates. Coincidentally, yesterday, there were oral arguments for a motion to dismiss the SEC Coinbase lawsuit, which was filed last summer. The basis of the argument is an interpretation of what is a security using the Howey test. And there are a number of other nuances in that case, and I listen to a fair portion of it.
00:39:07.580 - 00:40:24.100, Speaker C: And basically, there's the four prongs of the Howie test, and each side is coming to the court and saying, there is ambiguity here. We're talking about a 1930s law to regulate two thousand and ten s and two thousand and twenty s technology. We need clarity. On the same day that SCOTUS is hearing oral arguments for the Chevron doctrine, we also have in New York coinbase SEC initial oral arguments for the first proceeding of that case. And you can imagine if chevron doctrine were to be overturned, institutions potentially like the go would have the ability to be asked questions in court whether or not the ambiguity as it relates to previous laws or rules and regulations should be interpreted one way or another. And so that's kind of why this is important and obviously applies not to just the SEC, but any sort of administrative agency within the executive branch as it relates to ambiguity within laws. And not every single law, especially something that was written decades ago, can be directly applied to something that exists today, especially with the speed of technology.
00:40:24.100 - 00:40:50.140, Speaker C: And so the argument against it is, how can we possibly have clarity, and why should we go to the court system every time there's ambiguity for something like how we should regulate AI? Obviously, Congress isn't moving as fast as technology is for that. So there are arguments to both sides. But given the six three nature of SCOTUS, right now, it seems like Chevron and the doctrine that it represents is potentially going to be held in question.
00:40:51.890 - 00:41:24.360, Speaker B: Yeah, the Chevron case, just to underscore, again, not a crypto story at all. But if you even just look up the Chevron doctrine on Wikipedia, it's cited as one of the most important decisions in a us administrative law. It's been cited on thousands of cases since its issuance in 1984 was the year. And it's really incredible to hear, if you just google what's been going on, some of the quotes from this judge, who's Catherine Polk? Phyla is her name.
00:41:25.530 - 00:41:28.998, Speaker C: That's for Coinbase Sec, not Coinbase sec.
00:41:29.084 - 00:41:52.046, Speaker B: Yeah, but what she's reiterating is stuff that you've heard from crypto people for a really long time, basically saying, I'm concerned that what you're asking for is far too broad. Basically, under the exact quote here is we're all just afraid that you have so few limitations, noting under this logic, that collectibles or commodities could be regulated as securities. Yeah.
00:41:52.068 - 00:42:33.390, Speaker C: The biggest downbite that came out of yesterday was a mutual agreement that tokens, as themselves are not securities. It is only the format in which they are sold that is held in question as to whether or not those are investment contracts, which is a huge recognition. I mean, that's basically what was decided in the ripple summary judgment as well, which is that there are ways in which you can sell something that is an investment contract, like if it's a private transaction, but if it's happening on secondary markets, which is the argument of Coinbase, those are not considered investment contract transactions, and therefore it's not the sale of securities. And that was a mutual agreement with both the SEC and Coinbase.
00:42:34.130 - 00:43:37.700, Speaker A: Some of the philosophical underpinning of the arguments to overturn chevron is that it makes Congress lazy and it makes the regulators lazy. So, like, Congress passes a somewhat ambiguous statute to regulate, doesn't. Doesn't speak to any of the nuanced points that Michael mentioned, is a token security in which circumstance, and then they hand it off to the regulators, and the regulators have the chevron doctrine, which allows them to interpret it broadly. And so one thing that's interesting about regulatory agencies is a lot of them have what are called administrative courts. These are not real courts. These are owned and administered courts by the SEC, where if you get fined or if there's a civil know, you go to sec court and guess, like most of the time you're guilty because it's run by the. You know, the whole thing about Coinbase taking the SEC to actual court is like, the SEC then needs to go in front of a judge and make the arguments and prove why it's security or non security or whatever.
00:43:37.700 - 00:44:41.880, Speaker A: And obviously, a lot of the liberal arguments on this are know, throwing out this statute would throw everything into chaos, and it would force every judge to effectively be a policymaker and know the district courts in Texas, with the unregistered security question, probably a lot more favorable than the district courts in New York City. And so there's also this weird geographic element to. And I do think if you really kind of zoom out and think about where we are in history, I think that the Jimmy Carter Reagan part of history is pretty relevant here. Jimmy Carter, really high inflation, really unpopular president, pretty old, pretty unpopular. Then you have Reagan come in and you have this massive deregulatory boom. He basically deregulates everything. And his famous line from his campaign is like the most dangerous sentence that you can ever say is that I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
00:44:41.880 - 00:45:20.354, Speaker A: He actually predated the chevron doctrine, and so he went kind of regulation by regulation and cut them. He did it pretty quickly. This is like, if this happens, this terraforms a lot of the existing, like the Food and Drug Administration, the FTC, the SEC, like all of the regulators that you've ever heard. Like this kind of hits them like peanut butter spread. It's just like they all now need to go to court all the time. So I think there's pretty decent parallels here to what's happened historically. And I think you're going to see a lot of growth as a result.
00:45:20.354 - 00:45:29.960, Speaker A: You're probably also going to see a lot of people take advantage of this and that'll be negative. And depending on where you fall in the political spectrum, it's like that's either a huge problem or a huge opportunity.
00:45:30.730 - 00:46:19.238, Speaker C: I mean, the one kind of argument that they have against this is growth potentially with deregulation. The one argument against this is that it actually stymies growth because what it does is it puts everything on pause until you can adjudicate this in mean and look at how long ripple took to play out, which is two years, two and a half years. Coinbase started in July. We are now hearing the first oral arguments in a motion to dismiss, and it's expected that that decision will happen sometime in June. It'll take years for Coinbase to work itself out. So if we overburden the court system, it's also not going to be the best and fastest procedure of making things happen. All I'm saying is that there are arguments on both sides, I think.
00:46:19.238 - 00:46:33.930, Speaker C: But I do think ultimately the perspective of having the tie not go to the executive branch is kind of the most important one. You have to have a fair process for adjudicating things that are ambiguous.
00:46:34.830 - 00:47:28.730, Speaker A: It is interesting to think about, like if you wanted to get GDP growth to 50% next year, what would you do? You'd allow fracking in the backyards of every home in Oklahoma. You'd do all this stuff that is kind of arguably like cancerous growth that's caused by deregulation. And then there's like a sweet spot where it's just deregulated enough and the courts are just slow enough where you're able to kind of shoot or thread the needle I think this is all against the backdrop of if you see a different administration in the White House, like a republican one, all of these agencies are also going to be much smaller. The courts are going to be slower, the agencies are going to be smaller, there's going to be less resources to try things. And so I'm in favor of the chevron doctrine being overturned or changed, but I'm definitely not in favor of the free for all. That also seems like a negative.
00:47:29.950 - 00:48:12.394, Speaker B: I agree with that. Not a legal expert and haven't fully thought through all the implications of it yet. But speaking purely from someone who works in crypto, there are obviously downsides to removing the Chevron doctrine, but it's been pretty bad if you've been subject to the SEC and if you believe that crypto is the next big. I don't want to use the word paradigm, but computing platform or money or technology platform or whatever you want to use. The SEC has been doing its absolute best job to push that out of the US for a pretty long time now. You guys know it from the perspective of funding new entrepreneurs, you can see the activity actually meaningfully moving out of the United States. So I don't know.
00:48:12.394 - 00:48:23.946, Speaker B: I mean, it's hard to root against some form of change because it's been pretty tough. It's made it harder for us to operate our business, like a lot harder. So, yeah, I'd be in favor of this for sure.
00:48:24.048 - 00:48:45.566, Speaker A: Unfortunately, there's no middle ground, it seems, in America. It's either like we're regulating this thing out of existence or like we're taking the gloves off and we're just going to go bare knuckle speculating. I think that's also what makes America great. It's like the pivots extraordinarily hard from administration to administration. It'd be nice if there was a little bit more consistency.
00:48:45.758 - 00:49:12.060, Speaker B: You know what else is nice about America? Is good governance, like checks and is this was a designing principle of the US is having different branches of the government that balance each other out and have a different set of incentives. And it's kind of ethereum esque, actually. It moves very slowly. It's supposed to be neutral and flat. And that's been a really good strategy for the most part. And I feel like if anything, this is the US returning to its roots a little bit.
00:49:13.790 - 00:49:14.780, Speaker A: Wish for.
00:49:17.170 - 00:50:21.460, Speaker B: Point. All right, Michael, I know you've got a hop here, but maybe, Vance, we can stay on and just cover. The Ethereum foundation did a. So they do these Reddit, amas which is actually pretty, you know, you've got very senior know, the Doncrads and Justin Drakes and actually Vitalik himself chiming in to just answer questions from the community, which I thought was super cool and what it gives you if you're a reader of this, and actually I'll link it, there's a guy named Wolfgang who at Bitcoin Suisse he did a really nice 30 minutes overview of it. So if you don't want to actually read through all the comments yourself, but basically you get to see what people that are high ranking at the Ethereum foundation are thinking. This doesn't mean it's 100% going to make it into Ethereum's roadmap, but I'm just curious to see what they're thinking about. So one of the things that Donkrad said is there's an actual quote about it, but he's very focused on scaling data availability and they get in the weeds on what 4844 actually means.
00:50:21.460 - 00:51:01.040, Speaker B: But I thought this was an interesting way to sum up his thoughts, which was extending Ethereum's data capacity is definitely the most critical thing on our mind in 2024 and probably 2025 as well. So that's kind of interesting because it's taken in conjunction with Vitalik being broadly supportive of an increase in the gas limit on main chain. So Vince, I'd be curious what you think about is that the right focus from your perspective? Were you surprised? Are you kind of in the camp that Ethereum gas just keep gas where it is, it doesn't matter, people pay fees on the main chain. Or are you like, hey, this is the low hanging fruit and we should maybe make fees cheaper if we could.
00:51:02.130 - 00:51:44.560, Speaker A: I mean, I'm in favor of more experimentation, and ETH transactions just hit all time highs. Like gas is constantly super expensive. All of the people who said that fees were going to never return to their previous levels have basically been wrong. And now I think it's about just thinking about what the future looks like. Specifically for Ethel one, it feels like the Ethel two roadmap with l two s contributing 20% to 25% of all gas transactions. That's pretty solid with 4844, and we know a ton of roll ups that are just waiting for 4844 to launch. So I think the cost for roll goes from like a couple of million bucks per year for the developer operating team to a couple of hundred thousand, and you probably see ten x more of them.
00:51:44.560 - 00:52:53.330, Speaker A: And with that in mind, scaling DA is smart. I think I would make the argument that the most important market for ETH to go after is money. And I know a lot of people probably disagree with the eth is money meme, but it is inarguably the biggest market that you can go after. And so if you're trying to bootstrap the moneyness of an asset, it's actually helpful to have fees be more expensive, for yields to be higher, for people to want to stake, for people to want to borrow against the collateral asset. If your asset of your blockchain is just like cheap, there's no fees, it's all inflation, people don't really want to use it. It's hard to bootstrap that money. And so I think Ethel one has arguably done that very well, and now it's about kind of a spreading the asset across all these l two s that are creating supply sinks and b figuring out how to either recatalyze developer adoption on Ethel one scale up DFI or the higher cost, lower throughput applications, or doing something like scaling DA to make it more of a consumer style chain.
00:52:53.330 - 00:53:30.510, Speaker A: I do think whether it's dank sharding, which is going to come in the next 18 months or 24 months, we're already at a point where blockchain space is basically free if you really want it. And so I think it's frankly a good idea to keep experimenting. Raising gas limit is probably what I'm most in favor in. But scaling DA is also interesting. But it's good to see the East foundation responding. And they don't respond on Twitter and they don't shit talk other projects, they just ship stuff. And that's kind of how they ef.
00:53:30.850 - 00:54:09.654, Speaker B: The EF, in my opinion, is phenomenal. I just think in terms of what they've done stewarding the protocol, the quality of people that are in that organization is incredibly high. And I agree, they never stoop down to any crappy level or anything like that. And they're just really brilliant people that work there. I agree with you on the money thing. This is where I would disagree with what I think is the consensus way of thinking about it within the Ethereum foundation though, which is I'm not a huge fan of the ultrasound money. And the reason I'm not a fan of the ultrasound money is a it's actually that idea of like hard money is not even that popular within tradfi circles.
00:54:09.654 - 00:54:28.498, Speaker B: Like there's this really great quote from Jack Bogle. Eric Balkunis retweeted it this week. He's getting a lot of airtime on the know, but this is the Jack Bogle quote. Commodities are a real loser's game in the long run. They have no internal rate of return. You buy a commodity, gold is a good example. You're betting you can sell it to somebody for more than you paid for it.
00:54:28.498 - 00:55:09.674, Speaker B: I don't have an intelligent comment about that. It's absolute rank speculation. So commodities, people, people that trade gold and believe in gold, there are lots of really good fundamentals, first principles, arguments against that. But it's such a pervasive way of how people think about intrinsic value that you can model a stream of return, be that a cash flow, cash flows of a company, a dividend, or a payment from fixed income. This is why I just really like the yield narrative for ETH. And what I think the EF people would argue correctly is that that's a little bit of a meme. It's just you're trading value between stakers and holders, and what the EF foundation would want to do is favor the holders.
00:55:09.674 - 00:55:40.966, Speaker B: Right? It's basically, if you're paying less issuance to the stakers, you're implicitly favoring the holders. And the returns that would have gone to stakers go to holders instead. And it's a more tax advantaged way, almost, of collecting that income. I just think that the meme is important. I think the meme of yield bearing money and the desire for people to purchase that is so immense, it's just a massive. So I agree with you, and the money is the opportunity for ETH. But my own personal opinion on this would be to lean into the yield narrative.
00:55:41.078 - 00:56:45.786, Speaker A: And I think that means leaning into the gas limit increase, which is know when Vitalik passes something down from on. Like, usually people get the message pretty and like the ETH foundation does, from what we've heard, agree that ETH is money is the most compelling narrative and use case. And so stripping all the fees out of ETH, l, one they're not going to do it is my. And like, you think about all the things that ETH has going for it, and all the problems that they've solved, and that they've yet to kind of deal with. An interesting thought experiment is, let's just say ETH and Solana switch places, and Solana got all the fees and ETh got all the throughput. Who would be in a stronger position? I think Solana would, because it would have the money ness of the ETH ecosystem, would have the apps, it would have all the Defi, it have all the TVL. It's a lot harder to scale and build real economics than it is to just increase the throughput of your blockchain.
00:56:45.786 - 00:57:21.466, Speaker A: It's not a slight against Salana, it's just a point about the relative positioning. And I would just say no other blockchain has ever gotten to profitability on a per block basis where there's more demand for the block space than there is supply. And you think about a lot of these blockchains. Let's say something like Seoul is worth 50 or 60 billion and there's about 7% inflation. That's three and a half billion to 4 billion of selling per year. That's a lot. And so like we were just talking about with unlocks that slowly grinds on you.
00:57:21.466 - 00:57:49.694, Speaker A: And imagine what ETH would be trading at if it was still proof of work. Who knows what ETH BTC would be at? It might be negative. Who knows? But what ETH has going for it is that ETH is money. There's 30, 40 billion of it locked into DFI. People want to stake. That's the major narrative. Whether it's me or Steve or Fraxis or any of these other competitors, there's a vested interest in acquiring ETH.
00:57:49.694 - 00:58:26.474, Speaker A: And I posted this meme the other day. It's like, what's the best part about restaking? You're going to need ETH for that. I'm going to go off on a little tangent here, but if you think about a blockchain, you think about a crypto asset. What is it actually? Is it its consensus network? Is it like the TPS that it has? Is it like the virtual machine that it runs on? No, it's literally none of those things. What a blockchain is, is it's its native asset. And what is its native asset? Well, there's two components. There's supply and demand.
00:58:26.474 - 00:59:08.874, Speaker A: There's how much of it is being inflated per year, there's how much staking activity there is supply sinks, there's how much of it is locked into defi contracts and that people are willing to use as a collateral asset. And then there's the demand side, like how much is used every day, how much is bought every day, how much is spent on gas fees. And these crypto networks are just their native assets. And something like restaking will make that a lot more clear where it's like, yeah, I got my ETH staked on l one, but I'm also staking on a bridge and I'm also getting these oracle tokens. It's money. And that is the main thing that I think at some point in time, why ETh will actually flip bitcoin is because it's actually used as money. Like the hard money meme of, like, you just lock it away.
00:59:08.874 - 00:59:17.818, Speaker A: I think that's good for some people, but over the long term, the assets that are used more as money will just have a heavier supply sink and will just trade a lot lighter.
00:59:17.994 - 00:59:47.554, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, let me run something by you. And actually, by the way, if people want to explore that idea of what a blockchain is, there was a really interesting. I'm going to shout out. Chris goes, the founder at Anoma, wrote a really interesting piece on this on intents and an intent centric topology of what blockchains might look like. So his argument is actually a blockchain is four things. There's the actual protocol itself, there's a specific security model, a history which includes the asset.
00:59:47.554 - 01:00:43.498, Speaker B: And then there's a community of people who identify as members. And I actually am going to plug the next narrative season of Bell Curve and say that's a big idea that is being explored, is like, what happens when you unbundle those things. Because I think it's a pretty interesting idea to think about. But I have a question for you on the restaking, Vance, and I would love to understand how I'm thinking incorrectly about this, but my sense is that there's a direction that eth could go down, which I don't know how actively is being explored or whatever, but that there would be some kind of staking cap or something like that. There's a desire to limit the amount of the staking percentage of Ethereum. For me, what that would do, like, if you play that out, what ends up happening is people go further and further into restaking. And right now, what ethereum at least has control over is its monetary policy.
01:00:43.498 - 01:01:29.126, Speaker B: It can adjust its issuance rate if it wants to, and it can regulate how people like. There are all these proposals for things like two tier staking. They're pushing towards being able to regulate the sort of staking environment and its issuance policy. But if you were to cap that or you were to severely limit that, you push people out into restaking to seek that yield, and then that puts Eigen layer in a position of control. I think that's actually really bullish Eigen layer. Because then Eigen layer can, depending on the parameters that it sets within its platform, it can control how risk on or risk off the market is for seeking yield. So in a sense, I don't know when I think about when I tried playing that out.
01:01:29.126 - 01:01:32.730, Speaker B: It's like, I feel like that's kind of bullish for Eigen layer.
01:01:33.390 - 01:02:25.914, Speaker A: Let me stop you right there. So what's the bear case? What's the opposite of your argument? So your argument basically assumes that this is kind of like a bearish restaking argument, but let's just play it out. Restaking is powerful when there's a bunch of abs alternative validator services that want to give tokens to ETH restakers to go off and bootstrap their ecosystem. So maybe an oracle provider, maybe like a DA provider, maybe like a bridge. First of all, I've not seen any good pitches for abs as yet. I'm still waiting for good pitches. And a lot of it is like, if I'm a talented team that's built an amazing bridge, someone like, socket, I got my own tokens, and that's my value accrual, and that's what I want.
01:02:25.914 - 01:03:10.530, Speaker A: And I don't really want to give those away to other people just for the honor of being considered, like a restaked service. Let's just even go simpler. Eigen da. Let's assume that Eigen DA trades at whatever celestial is at like 15 billion, not even the Eigen layer token, just like Eigen Da ETH right now is what, 300, 350,000,000,000? And let's say that the first year inflation of that $15 billion token is 20%. So they're going to give away 3 billion of tokens to whatever, like 120,000,000,000 of staked ETH. That's not that much yield. That's like, not even enough to move the needle.
01:03:10.530 - 01:03:54.200, Speaker A: And so the position of control that Eigen layer would be in presupposes that they have all these amazing aBs services where the tokens are trading at high FDV and the unlocks never come. I think there's like a more cogent argument where it's like, there's going to be a lot of. You're going to have the barbell. You're going to have a lot of people staking ETH because it's like very consistent, three and a half, 4%. And then you're going to have a lot of people farming like 200% APY, or a very small number of people farming like 200% APY like crazy abs. Almost like quasi, like, DFI summer ponzu scheme. Not like Ponzi schemes, but they're just giving away a lot of tokens, and the unlocks are coming.
01:03:54.200 - 01:04:04.970, Speaker A: It just doesn't feel like there's in that middle of that curve. The thing that will give a lot of APY to a lot of people on the restaking layer.
01:04:06.030 - 01:04:41.526, Speaker B: Okay, this is a really good point. So this was my question as well. Is what is the demand on the avs side going to still. So we did an episode with Sriram and Zaki about how a lot of cosmos chains are exploring Eigen layer restaking as a method of security. And people should go and listen to the portion where Zaki describes from his perspective as a protocol founder, the value proposition. Because to summarize, basically, he was like, look, here's the myth about recruiting a set of validators. It's super easy.
01:04:41.526 - 01:05:05.930, Speaker B: Like really easy. I could do that in one day. And he has a reputation in a network. But even for a relatively new founder within Cosmos, super easy to get a network of validators. What's really hard is to get a network of validators that will continue to stake with you over bear and bull cycles. And so what you end up having to do is way overpay. For he's like, I did all these schemes.
01:05:05.930 - 01:06:03.070, Speaker B: I thought about all this stuff where how to get these people to basically lock up their capital with me instead of doing something else. So I would frame restaking as lowering the opportunity cost of capital on staking on alternative protocols. So instead of being like, I can either stake on ETh or I can stake in somalier, it's like, I can lock up my stake in ETH and then opt into additional incremental yield in all of these and look like, why wouldn't I keep doing that in a bear market? It's like, okay, I've still got my estake here, but why would I take this thing out? And that was the value proposition from his standpoint. But I agree with you. That is the big question. And then the other question is, is there an adverse selection when it comes to shared security? So this is a big problem for interchange security in cosmos because it's exactly what you said. It's like, if I'm a cream of the crop, new application, maybe socket or someone else, I don't need it.
01:06:03.070 - 01:06:27.670, Speaker B: I am actually really like the sexy nude protocol. It's going to be no problem for me to convince a network of long term validators to stake with me. But if I'm like a shitty product project and maybe I can't convince those people, then I need to go to the hub in cosmos or Eigen layer and restaking. Maybe there's an adverse selection problem that shared securities providers end up having adverse selection.
01:06:29.150 - 01:07:15.170, Speaker A: I think they're related. It's like adverse selection and then scale. Because if you have the cream of the crop best projects who get ETH restaked on them, who knows, maybe their market cap is altogether $100 billion and you're giving out 20 billion of incentives a year. And to the 150,000,000,000 of staked ETH, that's like another 10%. It's like, holy shit, we're cooking with gas now. But if it's the other thing where it's like you add up all the cosmos, ecosystem projects, market cap, and you're looking at like 5 billion and they're giving away 10% and maybe less in a year. It's like you got 500 million of incentives going to 150,000,000,000 of staked ETH doesn't move the needle.
01:07:15.170 - 01:07:57.960, Speaker A: And so I think what you're going to have is you're going to have the vanilla eth stakers that are like maybe putting it in ave to boost the yield another 1% because the lending APY actually scales. And then you're going to have the crazy dgens farming 300% maybe adverse selected projects. And I think that will be healthy because that's kind of what happens on crypto Twitter anyways. It's like, oh yeah, you're making 5%, I'm making 500%. It's like, oh, that's bullish eth. But again, you're going to need ETH for that. So I think it's very hard to game through what happens here.
01:07:57.960 - 01:08:12.460, Speaker A: But I think no matter what, the assets that are used to restake and that can transcend their consensus layer and their TPS. And in my opinion, the shit that doesn't matter, I think those are going to be very bullish for those.
01:08:14.750 - 01:08:43.570, Speaker B: Actually, to maybe sum up the way that I think about it, I'm actually, I think so bullish on restaking. I think it's such an obvious value proposition, actually, that my original concern was that it actually becomes so successful that it co ops a good amount of Ethereum's control over its own monetary. My, I don't, my, and Sriram has said on the show that his eventual endgame for Eigen layer is to be enshrined within the protocol. So maybe that ends up being a non issue.
01:08:43.640 - 01:09:38.194, Speaker A: But I mean, the ETH foundation and those guys are coordinated and I think you're going to see it just depends on how successful the initial launch is. But another thought experiment let's say celestia was trading at 2 billion instead of 15 or 20. If that was the biggest project that was going to be able to be restaked, that would be like bearish. And so a lot of it's like chicken and egg. But if the market caps of the tokens that are to be farmed are high, it makes it more likely to be successful. But you can also have this moment where if it's not a high market cap token, it's not driving APY. For a lot of people, restaking could be like it's just for the dgens.
01:09:38.194 - 01:09:55.770, Speaker A: It's like why institutions don't farm fucking tokens. Because they're just like, I don't want to get rugged. It's not worth my time, it's not scalable, it's not repeatable. I'm not bearish on Eigen layer. I'm just like trying to paint the full picture of what I think the math.
01:09:57.630 - 01:10:38.342, Speaker B: Got another. So just maybe in closing here, I do think it'll be really interesting to see what happens in terms of liquid staking penetration on celestia. So stride has shout out stride, I think what is probably the most comprehensive proposal thus far. It's live on the Celestia forum. We can link it in the show notes if anyone wants to take a stake rate like the overall adoption of staking in Ethereum and other proof of stake chains is really different. And there's very different views on what the optimal amount should be in Cosmos and salana, which were proof of stake from day one, much higher. And in Ethereum it's much lower.
01:10:38.342 - 01:11:25.334, Speaker B: It's like 80% around in Cosmos and Salana, but the penetration of liquid staking is extremely low. You know better than me on jeto, but I think it's like 4% penetration for liquid staking within salana, and it's roughly the same in cosmos, but it's extremely high in Ethereum. And one of the relics for why that is is like the user experience. Because there was such a long period of the merge where you could stake, but there was a lockup. It was kind of this weird one off event which the ux of being able to trade in and out of your stake was very, very compelling. So there was really high adoption of things like lido. It'll be really interesting to see Celestia and whether or not liquid staking ends up getting really adopted, or where that sort of percentage overall shakes out.
01:11:25.334 - 01:11:56.414, Speaker B: Because maybe the reality is just that there's a couple of reasons to liquid stake and what assets are attractive to be liquid staked? But maybe the desire, maybe for enough people, it's just good enough to set it and forget it and stake and get your yield. Maybe the market for people that want to take that liquid stake and loop it in some kind of borrow lend protocol and lever it up is not that high. I don't do that. And it's not because of the risk. I'll buy meme coins and nfts and shit. I have no problem doing any of that. But that's easy.
01:11:56.414 - 01:12:04.562, Speaker B: I can just click it. But for me, I got to go do this active thing where I loop it in a protocol. I'm not doing that. That sounds hard, bro.
01:12:04.616 - 01:12:05.806, Speaker A: Come on, dude.
01:12:05.838 - 01:12:13.090, Speaker B: I just don't. But maybe I'm mid curving the shit out of this, but for me, it feels like something active. I don't understand leverage.
01:12:13.170 - 01:13:00.834, Speaker A: I think you're mid curving this. I had an open maker vault for probably like the past six years, and it's like simple. You loop it and you just sit there and your liquidation price is pretty low. And do you want to buy a meme coin or do I want to have two or three x liberty? Just as, like my personal account? It's pretty clear the meme coin is going to go to zero. But if I'm just sitting here for the next ten years, I feel pretty good about having something that's looped. And the thing that's super important that's weird about Salana and maybe other blockchains is you have these centralized validator companies, so people like figment or there's a lot of Solana specific ones, and they'll basically take the Solana and they'll stake it. And that doesn't do anything for the network.
01:13:00.834 - 01:13:37.102, Speaker A: It's just sitting in a centralized validator company. And those assets are not liquid. They're not moving around on the chain, they're not generating fees, they're not bootstrapping defi TVL, they're not bootstrapping the moneyness of the asset. They're not being traded for NFts. They're just like, locked away. And so Jito is breaking this. And that is, I think, one of the main reasons that Solana is going to be very successful over time is a higher liquid staking rate, as price ramps and as unlocks happen, and as decentralized validator services kind of just figure out that they're not going to get as much mev or they're not going to be as competitive.
01:13:37.102 - 01:14:09.260, Speaker A: But having liquid staking penetration rates be high. I'm bullish on most blockchains that are having high liquid staking, because it just speaks to people are using the assets on chain, and there's a culture of, again, bootstrapping the moneyness of these things. And most of these networks do not have enough fees to justify their fundamental value. And so you better have some sort of moneyness that's associated with a token to carry your valuation premium. Maybe that's like left curving or mid curving or whatever, but I think that stuff is very important.
01:14:09.790 - 01:14:11.100, Speaker B: I don't think so.
01:14:11.870 - 01:14:12.778, Speaker A: I would object.
01:14:12.864 - 01:14:42.882, Speaker B: A lot of people will. The one thing I would maybe we have an analytics product. If you go to our analytics product, the first thing you'll see on ETH is blocks based profitability. It's an incredibly important metric. Maybe it's a semantic argument, but I don't love people being like, hey, this is the profit, and I'm going to do a DCF on ETH. I think that's a good way of looking at companies where you can assumption the reason why there's such a focus on cash flow is because that can be reinvested. I just view ETh as a commodity.
01:14:42.882 - 01:15:13.550, Speaker B: I think most of these things are as commodities. And my long term thesis is like a return to things that look more like commodity like money. Like, if you look at the history of money, sometimes money has looked more commodity like. Sometimes it's look more credit like. I think this is a return to more commodity like money things. Bitcoin, eth, and then, yeah, we'll see, like Salana. I think if it wants to go down that route, they're going to have to do their own, like 1559 this year, and there will be decisions made to prioritize.
01:15:13.550 - 01:15:36.600, Speaker B: Soldier, asset, or the network, or whatever. And Celestia is going to have to do the same thing. So, I don't know, I'm just very interested to see how it all shakes out. I could see it going a bunch of different directions, but my framework for a little while has been, this is a digital commodity boom. Like a commodity boom, like the early two thousand s. Yeah. And that's what this is.
01:15:36.600 - 01:15:48.810, Speaker B: I was just thinking about it this week. This industry is so dynamic, so fast moving. I don't see how you could work anywhere else at this point.
01:15:48.960 - 01:15:58.430, Speaker A: Totally. I mean, it's so dynamic, it's so fast moving. I think an orthogonal point to that is like, everyone is always focused on the things that are changing.
01:15:58.770 - 01:15:59.326, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:15:59.428 - 01:16:17.410, Speaker A: And in my mind at least, I opened a coinbase account in 2012. A lot of things don't change. A lot of things stay the same. And having an appreciation for that. Here we are, eleven years later. We have a bitcoin ETF. We have Larry Fink shilling the ETH ETF.
01:16:17.410 - 01:16:36.890, Speaker A: As much as things change, things stay the same. To, um, which is cause like, if you have the ground always shifting underneath you, it's just fucking annoying. But it's like nice balance of things that are meant to be permanent and last forever and that are sustainable and all these amazing new experiments. It's great industry.
01:16:38.590 - 01:17:13.862, Speaker B: We did our annual kickoff this week and we walk through. We did this at the beginning of January 2020 of the four stages of a bear market, and we did it for a bull market as well. And it's a lot of fun, but it is like, there was a macro guy that I was talking to who described what retail traders are like in a market which is basically like three year olds. It's like when you show a three year old something, everything's for the first time. It's like, oh, my God, that's the best thing ever. Or they're crying and super upset. And I don't know if you've never been through one of these cycles, it is really fun, but you definitely want to remind yourself to keep a cool head.
01:17:13.862 - 01:17:24.410, Speaker B: And it's not always going to be great forever. It's not always going to be shitty forever. But if you've never been through that before, it takes you on an emotional roller coaster, which is a good experience in and of itself.
01:17:24.480 - 01:17:27.738, Speaker A: It's also fun in a different way. I got to run.
01:17:27.904 - 01:17:30.054, Speaker B: All right, buddy. All right. This was fun. Cheers.
01:17:30.102 - 01:17:30.410, Speaker A: Later.
01:17:30.480 - 01:17:45.434, Speaker B: Talk to you later. Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we're incredibly excited to have teamed up with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol.
01:17:45.434 - 01:17:55.890, Speaker B: And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free. Click the link at the bottom of this episode to take you get your free NFT.
