00:00:48.726 - 00:00:49.050, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:00:49.120 - 00:00:50.300, Speaker D: Good to be here.
00:00:51.090 - 00:01:05.570, Speaker E: So I forgot to say, I think the biggest news of the week just dropped like about 30 minutes ago. The warriors are getting chris Paul. Really? No. For Jordan poole.
00:01:05.990 - 00:01:06.740, Speaker D: Wow.
00:01:07.110 - 00:01:21.734, Speaker B: This is the part of the conversation where Mike taps. I did hear last week I actually listened to you guys. Did hear that you guys were having a debate about Mike versus my athleticism and I got better and I than you.
00:01:21.772 - 00:01:24.886, Speaker C: I'm just going to say it. I got better and I'll just say it's.
00:01:24.908 - 00:01:27.670, Speaker B: Not even ask Mike how closely you follow sports.
00:01:29.790 - 00:01:30.780, Speaker D: For you.
00:01:31.630 - 00:01:40.886, Speaker C: I got some photos of Yana playing whiffleball at the charity tournament. Right. Don't make me air those things. Actually, that's a total bluff because neither.
00:01:40.918 - 00:01:47.162, Speaker B: One of us play neither one of us can play. Bunch of two sub 30 year olds with blown out backs.
00:01:47.226 - 00:01:51.550, Speaker D: Yeah. Didn't even step to the whiffleball playoff.
00:01:52.550 - 00:02:03.380, Speaker B: I actually saved one home run, but tumbled backwards and looking bad up there. Setting up for like three months of PT after catching that thing.
00:02:06.950 - 00:02:18.760, Speaker C: Oh, my God. Yeah, we were playing these blue collar, like, 50 year old guys who just they look like I think we were the only one that didn't have matching outfits for that thing.
00:02:20.010 - 00:02:21.302, Speaker D: Taking it too seriously anyway.
00:02:21.356 - 00:02:50.194, Speaker C: Taking it too serious. All right, why don't we just launch right into the news of the week? I think the big headline is obviously the ETFs. So this actually happened at the tail end of last week, but BlackRock announced that they were filing for an ETF. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world. They've got $9 trillion in assets under management and their record for getting ETFs approved is 575 approved to one not approved. So pretty.
00:02:50.232 - 00:02:51.966, Speaker B: Good post BlackRock.
00:02:51.998 - 00:03:16.940, Speaker C: There's just been a slew of other ETF issuers that have filed. So bitwise reignite their ETF application. Same with Investco, same with Wisdom tree. So pretty big week and prices have responded. So Bitcoin sort of leading the charge. It's been a very good week for Bitcoin and the rest of Crypto. So what do you guys I know it's been talked about a little bit but what are your guys takes on this?
00:03:18.350 - 00:03:48.082, Speaker D: I think initial take is just like sentiment flips on a dime. People can't even remember how they felt two or three weeks ago. And you have CMS intern memes, you have Fractals to 100 and 8200K for bitcoin. People are expecting this to get approved next week. So it just shows how fickle sentiment is. And to me, bear markets are when price doesn't go up on good news. And this is very much price going up on good news.
00:03:48.082 - 00:04:24.794, Speaker D: And it's kind of like a solution to a lot of the existential considerations, the asset class in terms of are we ever going to be let into the kingdom of I think, you know, November, December, January. It was probably not never, and now it looks be. There's edx the citadel exchange, there's the soros fund coming out and saying crypto has a place. Jerome Powell says crypto is not going anywhere. You have the spot ETF, which is looking like it gets considered. And it's not just bitcoin. There's going to be a plurality of these things.
00:04:24.794 - 00:04:47.702, Speaker D: If bitcoin gets considered and approved, ETH is probably next after that. And so it's good to see all of a sudden, you look at the chart, the previous all time high of bitcoin was like, I think 69,000, and we're at 30. Once you kind of get to like 50% of the drawdown erased, people start thinking all time high.
00:04:47.756 - 00:05:03.440, Speaker B: That's just how yeah, people start thinking we're close. I mean, you could see it in the social sentiment. There are these different tools that track social sentiment. 6 million people tweeted bitcoin ETF. 6 million people tweeted bitcoin ETF last week.
00:05:04.210 - 00:05:42.300, Speaker D: And it's always like the cold star problem, because things like bitcoin and ETH are more likely to be successful the higher the prices, which is the opposite of every other tech company. If meta is up ten x, it's more likely to go down than up at that point. Like something is wrong. The business fundamentals don't justify that, but things like digital gold or things that are reflexive like ETH, if you can get the cold start solved and you get people talking and the flywheel started, if bitcoin goes over 40K, people are thinking like next six to nine months, like all time high. That kind of feels like where we're going to go at some point.
00:05:43.470 - 00:06:26.054, Speaker E: I 100% agree with all that. I think the other take here, the additional take here is, let's think about this in the context of the timeline where you've got over the last few weeks, over the last few months. Just terrible sentiment from regulators as to wanting to blow this industry know, drive it into the know. It's never going to be legal in the United States. Then you've got the largest partners of asset managers and largest asset managers in the space. Investa, wisdom tree and BlackRock and fidelity citadel, charles Schwab, all coming out with positive sentiment, positive news, a desire to move in that direction. And I think that it kind of turns it around.
00:06:26.054 - 00:07:05.298, Speaker E: Instead of when we were talking about this last summer, we were all thinking, okay, when's going to be the J. Powell put? I think now we're talking about the GG put. When you've got all this stuff happening in parallel, when you've got these massive asset managers coming through and saying, hey, we're actually going to step out and support this, you kind of assume that it has been derisked from a regulatory perspective, from a reputational perspective, from a business perspective. For these and this is maybe one read of why these blackrocks of the world are putting out the ETF. There may be other reads. Maybe this is just the straw man or maybe this is just a signal. I don't necessarily buy into that.
00:07:05.298 - 00:07:08.018, Speaker E: I think those are a little bit more contrived perspectives.
00:07:08.114 - 00:07:10.102, Speaker C: But if we think about this also.
00:07:10.156 - 00:08:03.574, Speaker E: In the timeline of what's happening in 2024, there is positive sentiment with what we know is coming in, probably March of the happening of bitcoin. And the timeline for these ETFs potentially getting approved is 240 days, which is, I think, in February or March of 2024, there is just sort of a new narrative. Obviously, all of that coincides with one of the most negative sentiment periods of time I've seen in crypto in the last seven years. And there was a massive amount of short interest happening while that negative sentiment was happening. It was one of the most low volatility periods that we've seen. And I think a lot of the move up was definitely a short squeeze, but then it was also driven by positive narrative. What happens going forward, who knows? But I do think we're going to see a lot more positive movements and it's really going to come down to a regulatory fight.
00:08:03.574 - 00:08:34.858, Speaker E: And is it going to be the market structure bill or the draft bill, which is now? I think that was actually one of the biggest things that came out over the last couple of days. There will be a vote on that on July 19 out of committee and that is a huge step forward. That'll be the first time that we have a regulatory bill that's pro crypto, or at least supportive of crypto, going up for a vote. So it's all of these news stories coinciding in a backdrop of the most negative sentiment period of time from a regulatory perspective. So I think that's my quick and dirty.
00:08:35.034 - 00:08:49.622, Speaker C: Yeah. Can we just remember that just last week we were talking about whether or not this was a worse cycle in terms of sentiment than 2019, right? That was one week ago. That that was a legitimate question that was getting floated around Twitter. Now look where we all are.
00:08:49.756 - 00:09:19.680, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think? That BlackRock. So this comes on the back of two interesting things, right? The SEC is currently in a lawsuit with Grayscale over Grayscale bitcoin ETF. And also the SEC is currently suing Coinbase. BlackRock is filing a spot bitcoin ETF using Coinbase custody on the back. Right. So, like, what do you think that BlackRock knows here that the rest of us don't know? Is it just that they what do you what do you think about that?
00:09:22.530 - 00:09:58.774, Speaker D: I think there's two schools of thought. One is this is a line manager on the ETF product suite that just threw this in and is hoping to maybe get in front of other people, get in position if Grayscale wins. Just wants to be considered. The other school of thought is like, this is coming down from on high from Larry Fink directly. And he's like Gigabrain 60 chess, trying to do all sorts of things within the Democratic political machine. He thinks that Coinbase is something that he'll use long term. I've seen all these conspiracy theories.
00:09:58.774 - 00:10:00.220, Speaker D: It's probably somewhere in the middle.
00:10:02.830 - 00:10:18.638, Speaker B: I'm surprised none of the four of us showed up with the tinfoil hat on. Right. I would have done that. I just didn't have you don't like the take. Like the entire past year was a giant inside job coordinated by Wall Street parasites and government regulators so they could catch up to the old bitcoin.
00:10:18.734 - 00:10:41.746, Speaker D: I feel like that's like just table stakes. I don't even feel like that's conspiracy theory. It's also kind of too obvious maybe for me. Like double agent conspiracy theory. Like conspiracy theory to the conspiracy theory. I don't know if there's really any inside track here. I think it's more of a forcing function of like, this is going to happen eventually.
00:10:41.746 - 00:11:10.180, Speaker D: And I think now what's going to weigh on market sentiment is like, I don't think maybe this gets approved in the next 45 days. That's what this guy Eric Belchunas from Bloomberg seems to believe and he's way more knowledgeable about ETFs than I am. I also think there's a high likelihood that Gary Gensler drags this out till yeah, like between now and February. What are we all thinking? It's probably somewhere between the sentiment that we had before and the sentiment that we had now.
00:11:11.350 - 00:11:38.234, Speaker C: I think also just to address the conspiracy theory stuff, because many people are, oh, well, right after the SEC enforcement know all of these TradFi things. First of all, we'll talk about the exchange as well. But that NDX what is the name of that exchange? Edx. That was announced a long time ago. So all of this stuff been in the work. The way these institutions work isn't know do a snap decision here and hey, let's roll an exchange out because Bitcoin is down. These things take a much longer period of time.
00:11:38.234 - 00:12:03.582, Speaker C: The other thing is, I love a good conspiracy theory. I'll wear that Noah T shirt thing. But I think the simplest Occam's razor explanation to this is just that we were morons for the last two mean it's much simpler explanation for me to think that the institutions saw that there was something here, they wanted to get their piece of it. They weren't going to decide to participate when we were being full stream morons.
00:12:03.646 - 00:12:05.522, Speaker B: This feels like a good Opportune time.
00:12:05.576 - 00:12:11.074, Speaker C: I don't even think you have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe this. This is just good business strategy from their standpoint.
00:12:11.202 - 00:12:41.870, Speaker D: All these guys love a bargain. Yeah, I feel like how many of them been hurt just like, by buying things that were zeitgeisty and AI is fully priced. I don't know what we're going to do with that. But if you do anything now, you're probably going to buy close or at the actual top. Crypto is beaten down, but it's not going anywhere. Bitcoin, even at these prices, is like a 600 billion dollar asset, 500 billion dollar asset. People think the bitcoin has failed as an experiment, but it's like the biggest alternative store of value that exists.
00:12:41.870 - 00:13:30.778, Speaker D: This is going to be something that's important. I think they recognize that. I don't know if there's any imminent approval coming, but like, you know, if you have a few wins on the legal litigation side, which Coinbase seems to have, you have a tactical narrative of TradFi is starting to get behind this. This is kind of like what happened in the last bear market, honestly. But sub out some of that for Michael Saylor, starting to buy Bitcoin and telling everyone it's legitimate Tesla, you know, all that stuff. And one of the things that I find super interesting about prior cycles is that if you ask somebody to remember or to recall to you what exactly happened and when it happened, they would have no idea what actually happened. It was just too much euphoria, too much craziness.
00:13:30.778 - 00:13:59.530, Speaker D: They wouldn't be able to tell you the order in which the assets went up. But bitcoin. Every cycle leads. I'm just looking at this chart, right? So this is the BTC dominance chart. Let me just throw out a couple of numbers just to illustrate this. So, December 2020, bitcoin has broken through its all time high. It's at 34,000 by the end of December.
00:13:59.530 - 00:14:29.406, Speaker D: ETH, BTC is at 00:26. Didn't basically move. Bitcoin ripped first. And then you have from March 2021 to about May, you have that ratio effectively quadruple. And so you kind of need to get the simping for bitcoin out of the way early. And it's a very digestible asset. It's a very simple narrative.
00:14:29.406 - 00:14:47.160, Speaker D: It's very easy, but it's kind of the gateway drug to all these different things. You have all these different assets in crypto. And I think that's kind of what I'm framing this in my mind as is like, okay, this is probably the start. If you see this big bitcoin dominance move up, this is probably the start.
00:14:49.630 - 00:14:55.020, Speaker C: I would agree with that. Vance and I think it's easy. You could even look at.
00:14:56.750 - 00:14:57.514, Speaker B: I think.
00:14:57.632 - 00:15:32.854, Speaker C: There'S two ways that I think about bitcoin dominance, which is there's sort of a secular trend, and then there's a more cyclical trend that can be kind of useful to you. The secular trend of bitcoin dominance is down over a period. Let me zoom out a little bit more. If you go further back before 2017, it was about 95% dominance. And if this was a stock chart, right, it looks like it kind of bounces here, and now it's going to bounce again, but it's going to make lower highs. And I expect that to continue to be the case because a lot of the innovation and value that's getting created in crypto isn't just concentrated in bitcoin anymore. I think that's a pretty healthy thing.
00:15:32.854 - 00:16:02.382, Speaker C: But cyclically, I think bitcoin dominance tends to bottom at the absolute peak of market euphoria. This was January of 2018, and then it's kind of the first thing to catch a bid as well on the other side. So this might be the beginning of that process. So I basically would just agree with you, and then you can tell here. Bitcoin dominance peaked in December of 2020, and then it was basically down only when everyone rotated into ETH and alts and those sorts of things.
00:16:02.516 - 00:16:32.202, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a really healthy indicator that shows that money and interest are flooding into the space. Because I agree with what van said. I don't think you can have a bull run until this bitcoin dominance starts to rise a little bit, because the end of the day, bitcoin is not really getting moved from retail buying right now. It's getting moved from institutional buying, I would assume. And I think this shows that there's the first real spark of institutional interest back in crypto, and probably a year and a half here.
00:16:32.336 - 00:17:08.470, Speaker E: So one of the questions we were discussing earlier today is what does a spot ETF, let's say BlackRock, ends up winning it? BlackRock gets to distribute it to all of his financial advisors who are selling it into the sales force of BlackRock. What does that actually do to bitcoin, the marginal buyer? There's some analysis that we've seen where it says if for every dollar that you put in, it has a 15 to 20 x dollar multiplier in terms of the market cap, do you think that there's enough net interest right now from ETF purchasers to really drive a new narrative?
00:17:09.530 - 00:17:34.190, Speaker B: Not from ETF purchasers. I think I'm just scarred by that specific narrative of know, the institutions are buying. They're putting bitcoin on their private platform and their private wealth management platform. They're all going to buy because now, for the first time ever, they have the ability to buy directly from the JPMorgan private bank platform. I think that narrative, it's probably why I'm going to miss the next web3 social. Probably because I'm so scarred by that narrative.
00:17:35.010 - 00:18:08.310, Speaker C: I would push back on that. I view those as different things. There's sort of the corporate blockchain, not bitcoin arguments, but I've always thought it'd be super bullish if you could just buy bitcoin directly from your Fidelity brokerage, which you can now. Yeah, I just think once that like an ETF would first of all, it would give a real seal of legitimacy. A lot of the conversations about is this going to be legal? Is it not going to be legal? So there's the actual flows sort of component in terms of how much demand is it going to drive? But then there's the credibility argument. I think they're both powerful.
00:18:09.930 - 00:18:26.874, Speaker B: I don't know what you guys think of this take, but I think that maybe the SEC thinks that they just can't win the Grayscale case and they're going to roll over on bitcoin while still trying to kill the rest of protocols and the long tail of crypto assets. So maybe they roll over on bitcoin.
00:18:26.922 - 00:18:30.800, Speaker E: But keep trying to attack, give the industry a win.
00:18:32.050 - 00:18:47.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, make them look reasonable. I think maybe the SEC realizes that they went a little too far. And that seems to be the sentiment in DC. Is that Gensler extended his hand too. So maybe this is them pulling back a little think.
00:18:47.864 - 00:19:15.454, Speaker D: I have no idea. Unfortunately for them, I don't think crypto works that way. Right. If you did this with stocks, if you said, know, Tesla is the only legitimate EV automaker sanctioned by the government, all the other EVs would tank. All the EV companies would tank. If you do that with crypto, if you say that bitcoin is legit, we're going to give it a spot ETF, what's everybody going to do? They're going to buy Alts. It's a global game.
00:19:15.454 - 00:19:23.300, Speaker D: There's exchanges that are outside the reach of the US. That's just kind of how it works. So maybe they try that. I'm not sure how effective it would be.
00:19:27.510 - 00:19:29.620, Speaker E: And therein lies the GG put.
00:19:31.030 - 00:20:10.590, Speaker C: Yeah. The other thought, this is where I really wish I had a tinfoil hat, but I find this argument from the Maxis super frustrating because the tagline kind of is, everything else is a security except for bitcoin. But at the same time, the Maxis believe that the US is this top down sort of scam about funneling money up to the top. So if you had to pick one crypto, which was the most directly against the interests of the United States government, you'd have to pick, right? I mean, the other ones aren't necessarily explicitly trying to be money, and the other ones, the tagline isn't down with the US dollar.
00:20:12.630 - 00:20:55.886, Speaker E: Right. But the one thing that you could say, though, you're confusing securities regulations with money and OCC regulations and CFTC and commodity regulations, those aren't all intertwined to the government cabal coming together to say that's the thing that we need to go kill. I think you can use individual perspectives as perspective on how to change things, regulate things control. But the SEC isn't really going to win an argument and has already come out and said, I don't think Gary Genzler has actually said this yet, but other members of the SEC have said that bitcoin is not a security, so the cat's already out of the bag. But I don't think you can run that back.
00:20:56.068 - 00:21:23.160, Speaker C: I get that, but that's why I wanted my tinfoil hat on for this particular part, because I know that it's not like one big cabal and everyone's not on the phone being like, let's kill bitcoin. But I do think countries in general respond to national interests. And if bitcoin were to be successful as the explicit stated intention, is that's not within US. Interests? And I think it's a convoluted argument to say that it is.
00:21:23.530 - 00:22:05.042, Speaker D: I think the most interesting thing about the ETF is, like, does it drive additional flows? And I think it will, but it won't in the way that people imagine it. I think the narrative of being approved by BlackRock and brought into the regulatory fold is a narrative that drives flows. But we've had veto for two years at this point. This is not like a new phenomenon. You can go buy GBT in your 401K retirement account if you want. There's a lot of ways to access this. And the other stuff is that Coinbase has been onboarding a lot of the biggest hedge funds, biggest asset managers on the and like, they are some of the primary users of this.
00:22:05.042 - 00:22:32.030, Speaker D: And like, I get that there's an angle of if you want to short, like, you can't really do that on Coinbase if you're really an upsize asset manager. Also, I've heard that these asset managers want to use it for leverage and do different things with it that are only kind of available within the prototypical broker dealer custodian model. So I think there's some but we've already had this for a long time, so I don't think it's like turning on the floodgates.
00:22:33.570 - 00:23:10.598, Speaker E: The counterargument. There would be you can go buy GBTC or Beto. Beto has an expense ratio that's underperformed Bitcoin. GBTC is at like a 32, 33% discount, and it requires you both of those require you to be or the GBTC requires you to be an accredited investor. I mean, the largest asset holders in the US as a population right now are the boomers, the baby boomers, and they have no access. Effectively, if you're in a retirement account to be able, like 401 KS, you can't unless you're on Fidelity. Fidelity Digital Assets allows you to buy Bitcoin and ETH right now.
00:23:10.598 - 00:23:12.426, Speaker E: But if you have a can't get.
00:23:12.448 - 00:23:14.246, Speaker C: Access to Bitcoin, frankly.
00:23:14.358 - 00:23:37.730, Speaker E: So there is an argument that there is a net new buyer. I agree, though, that I don't think that it's going to be as pronounced as the expectation of everybody with this potential application getting approved is expecting. I think that there will be net new, but it's going to be more of the benefit will be realized in the institutionalization of bitcoin, less in the actual flows.
00:23:40.310 - 00:24:09.146, Speaker D: Alex Weiss also had a tweet where he marked all of the ETF approval and denial. Pretty it's pretty clear, like, the market topped on the approvals and the denials. And I think it's kind of interesting. The last cycle ended with the veto. ETF was approved, I think, December 10, the cycle will start with it just.
00:24:09.168 - 00:24:12.074, Speaker C: Like the do you remember Vance?
00:24:12.122 - 00:24:33.362, Speaker E: Do you remember in I think it was March of 2017 when the winklevoss twins had their application denied and that's what kicked off all of the excitement around ETH. And frankly, ICO summer. The denials and the progols are major catalysts up and down.

00:25:30.890 - 00:26:06.146, Speaker B: Let me ask you guys about edx markets. So edx is this exchange that Citadel, fidelity, Virtu, Charles Schwab, sequoia, and interestingly enough, paradigm are behind. So they announced it back in, I think it was September of 2022, but it just went live this past week. So that's why it was in the news again. The only four tokens that are trading on it are, I think it's litecoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin and ETH. Who's trading on this, do you think? And would any crypto native funds, like, would you guys ever trade on this or there's no reason for you to trade on it. Before we talk about this, I just.
00:26:06.168 - 00:26:53.674, Speaker D: Want to say that if you knew that there was a bitcoin ETF news coming and you bought bitcoin, you would still underperform bitcoin cash. So that's the extent to which all this stuff is correlated and especially alts that are like, illiquid and move a lot. It's not necessarily like a buy bitcoin if bitcoin ETF gets approved. But on the edx stuff, we've heard this is citadel is basically main play for crypto. They've stopped doing a lot of the OTC stuff, but it's like run by a guy who was very prominent in the organization. It's clearly kind of like this. It's like a very kind of like overcomplicated version of what you could do with crypto.
00:26:53.674 - 00:27:25.942, Speaker D: But they've separated the custodian from the clearing, from the trading. It's great, but it doesn't make a ton of sense within the context of crypto just being a more efficient version of all of that. I don't think we would ever trade there. I mean, we have ETH, we have bitcoin litecoin BCH. I don't know why we would do that, but I expect this to take a lot of share away from places like Coinbase, frankly. And like all of the color that we have from the people that we trade with and work with are that they largely, if they're still in the US. Move to the CME.
00:27:25.942 - 00:27:39.470, Speaker D: And you can see that the CME volumes, they've ramped over the first six months, that really is becoming like a center of flow where it historically has not been. So yeah, I think the next cycle probably will kind of be like a regulatory cycle.
00:27:40.530 - 00:27:41.518, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:27:41.604 - 00:27:51.010, Speaker C: I might be misunderstanding this, but I thought that EVX was going to partner with brokerages. You wouldn't go and trade at a it's an actual exchange.
00:27:51.430 - 00:28:00.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I may be funnel they funnel trades through to different brokerages, I think, I mean, similar, not you're not going on the New York Stock Exchange and.
00:28:00.044 - 00:28:12.262, Speaker E: Making also, I believe, I think I read this, it's API only. There's no interface. It's just an exchange to trade and institutional only in that respect.
00:28:12.406 - 00:28:41.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're launching a clearinghouse to settle trades, but not yet. But I think the key here is that if you look at all the crypto exchanges today, there is this kind of like they're a hodgepodge of custody and settlement and they have the exchange and they are the broker as well, kind of, but that model doesn't even really fully make sense if you apply it to crypto. This is like we are going to take the traditional model of separating custody, settlement and exchange and then apply it to crypto trading, which doesn't really exist.
00:28:43.270 - 00:28:51.890, Speaker E: Would you say the comp here is more like Nasdaq New York Stock Exchange versus the monolith that you would have with Coinbase finance? Is that a fair assumption?
00:28:51.970 - 00:28:53.462, Speaker B: That is, yeah.
00:28:53.516 - 00:28:53.926, Speaker C: Okay.
00:28:54.028 - 00:29:10.246, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I thought. Like people joke about the cabal in crypto or the know, there's like a room where everyone's fates are decided and where the market direction is chosen. I don't think that exists, honestly, in crypto. I don't think it really exists in TradFi.
00:29:10.278 - 00:29:12.899, Speaker B: But someone who was in the cabal would say that.
00:29:12.899 - 00:30:10.254, Speaker D: That would be something that I would say all the terrifying guys kind of travel in the same circles we've noticed over time. And there's like if you can just turn on crypto trading by going to the Citadel branded run licensed exchange versus getting IC approval to get on the coinbase and do all of that, like, it's just going to make easier for them to come on board. And I think that's what most of. The TradFi people within Crypto are talking about at this point, it's like, are you going to go trade on CME or are you going to wait for Edx to get up and running for real? Because it's just like it's another API within the same regulatory framework and technology stack that this is the interesting part. It's the same technology stack that Citadel securities works. You know, if you're already trading on the largest market maker in the world, you can trade on the just as.
00:30:10.292 - 00:31:05.200, Speaker E: An anecdotal piece of our, one of our investors back in the day, when we were talking with them about DeFi and using things on chain and trying to get all this, they're very traditional registered investment advisor, and they were telling us it took them, I think, like six months approval. Just be able to stand up. A separate airdap computer doesn't have any of the software running on it. And that was like their DeFi computer and it had to stay in the office. They had to have monitoring on where the ledger was, the controls that maybe just like unless you're in that position in that institution, the controls that are associated with RIAs and financial advisors and all the stuff that comes with that are so strong that nobody's willing to even go there. If you have to be able to promote this idea, step outside the bounds and try something new. I think it's underappreciated how hard that is.
00:31:05.810 - 00:31:06.560, Speaker D: Yes.
00:31:08.550 - 00:31:16.770, Speaker C: It'S just one thing that's sort of funny to me is that Litecoin and Bitcoin cash are included there. That's just a funny selection of assets.
00:31:17.350 - 00:31:28.642, Speaker D: I mean, it's no coincidence that those are the same poor assets that Gary Gensler in that one speech said are not securities except for Bitcoin cash. Well, maybe you did say that one, I forget.
00:31:28.706 - 00:31:47.838, Speaker C: But I don't know because even yeah, Jason, I've gone into Bloomberg a couple of times and if you just open up a Bloomberg terminal, look at the crypto products that they cover, it's like Bitcoin and ETH and then it's like every ICO shitcoin from 2017. It's like Ripple, Stellar, Bitcoin, Cash, Litecoin. They're all up there.
00:31:48.004 - 00:32:08.420, Speaker D: I think lost within this also is like the fact that ETH is in there. It's been said it's not a security by the CFTC. It feels like it's in the process of being blessed by the TradFi community, but having it on these places is extremely bullish in my mind.
00:32:09.350 - 00:32:58.310, Speaker E: Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think in this era of the SEC we're going to be able to see them bless it as not a security. It's going to have to live in this phase of purgatory, mostly because if they say that it's not a security, what that does is it gives credence to the Hidman documents and it basically gives a playbook for anybody else who says, hey, we just followed the playbook of Ethereum. You've already said that Ethereum isn't a security because it becomes sufficiently decentralized. And if you run that playbook, you can make it such that you believe that you're sufficiently decentralized. All of this is to get at without new legislation, frankly, what's at least been discussed in the draft market structure bill, where you have definitions around all of this stuff. We're just going to continue to live in a world of purgatory.
00:33:01.450 - 00:33:03.318, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess we'll have to.
00:33:03.324 - 00:33:05.046, Speaker C: See how the regulatory stuff plays out.
00:33:05.068 - 00:33:06.294, Speaker D: Over the next couple of years.
00:33:06.412 - 00:33:11.020, Speaker C: Well, I would love to maybe talk a little bit about e scriptions. I know you guys were excited on this.
00:33:12.270 - 00:33:55.718, Speaker B: There's one other institutional news thing that nobody really talked about this week, which was actually SAP, which seemed boring, but I don't know if you guys read this blog post. So SAP powers a lot of fortune 1000s. They're kind of like the underlying infrastructure for how a lot of fortune five hundred s and fortune 1000s collect payments and do their billing and accounting and all that stuff. They put out a blog post today, a couple of days ago. It says today cross border payments are a hassle for small and mid sized enterprises with international business partners. Expensive up to $50 a transaction, slow up to seven days to transmit the money, and nontransparent, you never know the status of the transaction. These major challenges can get solved with digital money as a means of settlement and blockchain is the underlying technology.
00:33:55.718 - 00:34:34.850, Speaker B: And what they announced a couple of days ago is that SAP is now testing cross border payments for all of their customers using USDC. And I think this is a narrative that is completely dead. Like the payments narrative is completely dead. But I actually had breakfast with someone yesterday who's they're working on the same thing, but for consumers, they're really good crypto founder, been building for several years. They are working entirely on this payments solution. And I think this could be a narrative that stable coins in the real world economy. This could be a narrative that comes back that nobody's talking about.
00:34:34.850 - 00:35:02.860, Speaker B: And I think reading that SAP blog post, you can really quickly imagine a world where millions of businesses, I mean, it already happens in crypto. We accept us, where millions of businesses all around the world can settle this intercompany trade instantaneously using USDC and other stable. I'm getting a little echo, by the way, but yeah, I don't know. I'm pretty excited actually, this renewed interest in payments. Curious what you guys think.
00:35:04.050 - 00:35:55.040, Speaker E: Jay Powell yesterday in front of congress said that we should consider stablecoins to be a form of money. And it was one of the comments that he made yesterday, which I thought was pretty profound. I think we're going to start to see cross border, frankly, as we see efficiencies gained on. We've talked about this before, but native minting of USDC, I think provides a really strong use case for bringing USDC over onto a layer two, onto an execution environment where it's just that much cheaper to transact. I saw sending a token or sending ETH on most of these L two s was getting close to that $0.01 cost basis. And you assume a couple more iterations and a couple more improvements, and you're sending unlimited amounts of value for less than a cent over a layer two.
00:35:55.040 - 00:36:38.042, Speaker E: If you have that with native minting, you then have the security guarantees of USDC and the cost reduction that make payments viable. I think when you break down what payments really are, it really comes down to just their cost per execution. Person to person payments is going to be probably the hardest in person payments. So point of sale transactions is sort of the next hardest. You're used to having to pay a fee in those types of situations, which is just assumed by the merchant cross border payments. That fee goes up in some cases to be percentages, if not like 10% of the total value. And so you just start to tick those things off and break down.
00:36:38.042 - 00:37:07.366, Speaker E: Okay, in the payments ecosystem, what's going to be the most viable right now? Cross border. Then it comes down to it's not really a cost structure there. It's about availability. So how do you get USDC or any of the local currencies to accept that as a form of cross border payment? I think it'll be still a long ways before you get point of sale transactions to support USDC, mostly because people are just obsessed and kind of addicted to the points that they get from credit cards. But I think payments is always going.
00:37:07.388 - 00:37:08.422, Speaker D: To be a viable option.
00:37:08.476 - 00:37:13.430, Speaker E: It really frankly, just comes down to cost. And that's kind of what drives adoption and payments.
00:37:16.730 - 00:38:02.230, Speaker C: I'm not super bullish on it in the short to medium term. I just think there's this guy gave framework a little while ago that really resonated, which was just if you have a product and you can make something like a service or product order of magnitude better, but you have to add one step, good luck, you're toast. And as opposed to if you have a product that's just as good but you get to remove a step, then that's a gigantic business right there. And I just think even like if you magically transported to a world where everyone is already on blockchain rails, no one would ever use the system that we have in TradFi. It sucks, but because we don't have that, what you're asking is tons of individual merchants and businesses to understand how to use this stuff and retrain and do new systems.
00:38:03.850 - 00:39:03.670, Speaker E: Just to be clear though, Mike, everybody thinks of payments as being like Venmo transactions and using your Apple Pay or credit card at a point of sale orders of magnitude more value are transferred cross border every single day. And in business to business transactions, I didn't see the SAP announcement, but we're talking tens to hundreds of more value is in the payments realm in that area of the world where cross border FX and reliability of actually receiving the money that you get if you send a wire transfer and it has more than two stops. So three or four different FX conversions, there's like a 95% chance that your money actually shows up on the other end. So if you want to send value to Nigeria, for instance, it's got to go through Euros, it's got to go through to the local currency and then to the bank account that you're trying to send it to. The reliability there is actually still extremely small. So specifically what I'm referring to is cross border and potentially with FX involved.
00:39:04.590 - 00:39:50.070, Speaker C: What'S, like an example of a cross border payment for that? Because you still need if you're going between currencies, you're still basically FX trading, you're going like Euro to USDC to dollar, because no one in the real world I use USDC, but it's for crypto stuff. Usually if you want to do crypto things and buy crypto stuff, then USDC is more utility as a dollar. But in the real world, you can't pay for anything at the store with USDC. So I think that's the point I'm trying to get at is there's still that three hop conversion of currency to USDC to X, and then you need a different set of infrastructure to manage those transactions. So that's the friction that I see in the short to midterm. Yeah.
00:39:50.220 - 00:39:59.754, Speaker E: And the difference would be it's on a blockchain where you can check it versus like a correspondent bank where the money flows out and you're like, I hope this comes back on the other side.
00:39:59.952 - 00:40:17.294, Speaker C: That is true, and it does suck. We had one small period of time where we had to as blockworks, make a bunch of international cross border payments. And I can tell you it was horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. It's literally the blows out and five.
00:40:17.332 - 00:40:20.066, Speaker E: Days later you hope it ends up and where it's supposed to go.
00:40:20.248 - 00:40:26.002, Speaker B: Yeah, you think bridging your assets over to an L two are bad. I need an international wire waiting 20.
00:40:26.056 - 00:40:28.102, Speaker E: Minutes versus mating four days.
00:40:28.156 - 00:40:28.806, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:28.988 - 00:40:45.130, Speaker B: Baby steps, though. One of the reasons the SAP is cool is I don't know, remember when everyone was talking about private ledgers? Like SAP is using public ethereum for global trade with USDC? It probably takes ten times longer than we realize, but I don't know. Baby steps.
00:40:45.870 - 00:40:47.846, Speaker D: I'm there with Yano. I'm bullish.
00:40:47.958 - 00:40:48.938, Speaker E: Let's go then.
00:40:49.024 - 00:40:50.106, Speaker D: Let's go, baby. All right.
00:40:50.128 - 00:40:54.110, Speaker B: Should we talking descriptions? Speaking of being bullish.
00:40:56.530 - 00:40:59.790, Speaker D: Tell me your analyst ten year thesis on each scriptions.
00:41:01.010 - 00:41:03.200, Speaker E: First, let's do a description of it.
00:41:06.370 - 00:41:38.140, Speaker B: I'm sure you guys understand it better than I do, but basically all right, so you have the EVM. The EVM processes user transactions and stores a bunch of data. There's like different types of data right? There's persistent contract data, which is like the storage, right? There's temporary contract data, which is the memory. And then there's the transaction data, like transaction input data. And this is call data. If you look at both storage and call data can be permanent. But call data is just again, my understanding is like, it's a lot cheaper to use.
00:41:38.140 - 00:42:22.762, Speaker B: And the reason for this is because smart contracts can't read the call data unless it's this is where my understanding breaks down, but unless it's the input to one of its own functions. And I think that's kind of the basis for E scription. So E scriptions are basically just chunks of call data that store images or text. And so if you look at here, sometimes it's helpful to see it. I just found this one on Etherscan. If you can see this here. So this is Etherscan and you can scroll down and this input data doesn't look like anything, but if you change it to this utf view, you can see there's just an image here.
00:42:22.762 - 00:42:41.262, Speaker B: So this is an ETH scription. And voila. It's like ordinals, but with better branding. Because ordinals I should say it sounds like ordinals. I think it's basically ordinals. Like you hear the word ordinals though, and doesn't really mean anything. I think the branding on ETH scriptions is really nice.
00:42:41.262 - 00:42:45.780, Speaker B: It's an inscription on ETH. See it on etherscan. There you go.
00:42:47.510 - 00:43:02.518, Speaker D: I like it. God bless these kids who are just using Ethereum for things it really was not intended to be used for. But cool. Anyways, I don't know if this is like a ten year thesis or like you need to go out. I think there's like Ether Punks now, right?
00:43:02.604 - 00:43:05.282, Speaker B: Yeah, they sold out instantly. Ethereum punks.
00:43:05.426 - 00:43:22.860, Speaker D: Instant iconic. Is it a bit silly? Do we already have NFTs really need this? Yes, potentially. No. But I think also it's like we're just continuing to bootstrap culture around ETH. L one.
00:43:24.990 - 00:44:17.200, Speaker B: I think here's thesis for E scriptions is that there's a lot of stuff happening in the NFT world where people are realizing that maybe I'm going to botch all of this. But if you look at foundation or Openc or something like that, you realize that a lot of NFT value and information is actually stored more at the Zora. I don't have the details right, but on OpenSea and not at the protocol level, but Ether Scan is kind of the source of truth for all of ETH. Right? And it can be recreated just using this decentralized ETH data. So ETH scriptions are like, maybe more of a hard data as opposed to something that's stored at the app level. Does that make sense?
00:44:18.290 - 00:44:42.514, Speaker D: Also, what a beautiful business. Ether scan is Never raised outside funding. I think they're based in Malaysia or something. Probably like wildly profitable, but it's just been the source of truth for as long as I've been in crypto. Same with Michael. I was trying to read a bitcoin Block Explorer to check out where the US government was sending the bitcoin. I just was like man I cannot make heads or tails of this anymore.
00:44:42.514 - 00:44:44.582, Speaker D: This makes no sense at all. Yeah.
00:44:44.636 - 00:44:47.806, Speaker B: Have you ever met them? Have you ever met who is it Matthew who runs?
00:44:47.858 - 00:44:48.860, Speaker D: Never met him.
00:44:50.270 - 00:44:54.970, Speaker B: You could imagine a Coin market cap like exit for them in the next cycle.
00:44:55.790 - 00:44:59.626, Speaker C: CoinGecko is a great they have a great story as yeah.
00:44:59.728 - 00:45:01.162, Speaker B: Bobby shout out.
00:45:01.296 - 00:45:07.066, Speaker C: Yeah. What is the business model for the Block Explorers? How do they monetize ads?
00:45:07.178 - 00:45:09.566, Speaker D: I think Ads, if you go to.
00:45:09.588 - 00:45:23.806, Speaker B: It and you click Exchange, like right now you click Exchange and it's sponsored by IO or Play, you get like Metawin or Coins game. And this is all an automated business so they don't have a sales team at least is my understanding.
00:45:23.918 - 00:45:28.450, Speaker D: They make money doing the L two S block Explorers too, right? Like b and b, scan and op.
00:45:28.520 - 00:45:29.310, Speaker B: Oh really?
00:45:29.480 - 00:45:35.830, Speaker D: Arbiscan. And I think there's like a two year waitlist for getting them to do your blockchain too.
00:45:35.980 - 00:45:38.054, Speaker E: I don't know how recurring that.
00:45:38.172 - 00:45:44.258, Speaker C: Yeah, that's not recurring but hefty price tag I've heard is to accurate.
00:45:44.354 - 00:45:45.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:45.370 - 00:46:12.180, Speaker D: Very expensive. I think broadly it's like when are we ether scriptions aside, when are we going to get the NFT people reactivated? I feel like of all the crypto folks, they've just been destroyed. Eminem sold his board Ape today. It's June 22, 2023. Looking like there's some outstanding loans on some board apes like right around the floor. Price right now on bend out.
00:46:13.030 - 00:46:14.498, Speaker B: Eminem dow is bad.
00:46:14.584 - 00:46:33.340, Speaker D: I know you need to get these people reactivated. I don't know why that going to be, but I remember it was like 2019, 2020 there was really no activity on NFTs and then 2021 it was all of a sudden like punks are worth half a million dollars each. Do we think that's going to happen again?
00:46:33.870 - 00:47:07.250, Speaker E: I was with a fun manager yesterday who has a lot of same similar perspectives as we do. And one of thesis that he had was it might be the right time to start buying punks. We were also talking with another manager in the space and one of their pretty strong theses and I think they've already been deploying into it is buying NFTs. There's an element here where it gets so low and potentially attractive that it might become a good just investment category.
00:47:07.410 - 00:47:09.254, Speaker B: What buying NFTs again you're saying?
00:47:09.372 - 00:47:09.990, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:10.140 - 00:47:12.150, Speaker B: Can you guys buy NFTs in the fund?
00:47:12.300 - 00:47:15.110, Speaker D: Yeah, we can. We haven't.
00:47:16.170 - 00:47:19.990, Speaker B: At what price would punks have to go to to buy some punks?
00:47:20.490 - 00:47:33.278, Speaker E: It depends on how you have to underwrite it. And are you looking at it from like an individual asset class perspective and is there some value or utility from that specific NFT? Or are you looking at this basically as like a levered ETH play?
00:47:33.444 - 00:47:44.880, Speaker B: No value, no utility punks specifically. I said punks, because there's no game that's being created around punks. It's just a number go up, and it's probably a levered ETH play.
00:47:46.610 - 00:47:47.634, Speaker E: I don't know if we could talk.
00:47:47.672 - 00:47:49.058, Speaker B: About what price we buy.
00:47:49.224 - 00:47:53.858, Speaker D: Yeah, we can't talk about any of that. But just looking at punks right now, it's 49.
00:47:54.024 - 00:47:54.980, Speaker B: 49.
00:47:55.690 - 00:48:17.130, Speaker D: So the total market cap is 491,000 e, and ETH is at 2000. Call it so times ten, 4.9 times 1049. This is like, what, 2 billion market cap? Something like that. Let me do that math.
00:48:20.110 - 00:48:24.026, Speaker C: Remember when you and I said we were definitely going to buy punks when they went down?
00:48:24.128 - 00:48:29.066, Speaker B: Mike and I, top of the market. We're like, if we ever get into a deep bear market, we're definitely buying punks.
00:48:29.178 - 00:48:31.822, Speaker C: Here we are getting to another bear market.
00:48:31.876 - 00:48:41.218, Speaker D: So punks has a $1 billion market cap aggregate. That's how I think about it. But there's no utility, right? There's no fees, there's no anything like that.
00:48:41.304 - 00:48:42.610, Speaker B: That's why they're valuable.
00:48:45.110 - 00:48:53.894, Speaker C: It looked like utility was trouncing that this is digital art for a little while, but I don't know, I kind of think it maybe isn't one size fits all.
00:48:53.932 - 00:49:06.106, Speaker B: Second you add utility, people start trying to make an equation out of it. Where you have the utility on one side, is it greater than or less than the price? I mean, you got to be a.
00:49:06.128 - 00:49:09.546, Speaker E: Pure revenue, pure play, pre revenue, pure play.
00:49:09.728 - 00:49:13.130, Speaker B: The crazy part about punk number up chart.
00:49:15.010 - 00:49:16.190, Speaker C: No revenue.
00:49:17.730 - 00:49:44.280, Speaker D: The crazy part about punks is that blur kind of like farmed the farmers in many ways, where someone on march 17 sold 800 punks into blur bidding liquidity at once. I don't know when the market changes that dramatically in terms of volume and liquidity, I at least want to wait to re underwrite things.
00:49:45.610 - 00:49:48.934, Speaker C: Could you explain what you mean by farm the farmers? Yeah.
00:49:48.972 - 00:50:21.220, Speaker D: So all of these farmers were paid in blur points to basically bid NFTs. Meanwhile, the people who were selling NFTs were actually the biggest net beneficiaries, and you have this two sided liquidity that has never happened before. And so who are the winners? Probably the sellers of NFT, but also the protocol that got this artificial bid liquidity. And the losers were the people who, you know, big brother machi folks like um, just kind of got torn up and lost a bunch of ETH in the.
00:50:23.030 - 00:50:23.346, Speaker B: Don'T.
00:50:23.368 - 00:51:13.970, Speaker C: Have you guys ever heard the dgen spartan line on? You know, this was an uncommon core episode he did a while ago with Hasu, but I did actually see he made the comparison between blend and sushi, which was basically one of the reasons why DeFi coins topped around the same time as sushi swap is. The incentives were so strong on sushi that they pulled so much liquidity to one place that if you held these kind of illiquid DeFi coins, your entire incentive there was to sell. And kind of a similar comparison can be made to Blur. Whereas you might think something is super bullish because you're pulling a bunch of liquidity to one venue. But if you're a long term bag holder of these things, there's an attractive price you're incentivizing everyone to dump at the same time.
00:51:14.120 - 00:51:45.474, Speaker D: So that makes your options to liquidate NFTs at scale are like you get this so the bees sponsored grail type sale or you sell into Blur. I mean, maybe it is like a decent time to buy NFTs, but calling them levered ETH feels very specious. That implies it has both the fundamentals of ETH and then this other thing. I don't know, maybe we're just too right and left curve simultaneously to be part of this new generation of degens.
00:51:45.542 - 00:51:47.738, Speaker E: But wouldn't that put us mid curve?
00:51:47.834 - 00:51:49.374, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean right in the middle.
00:51:49.412 - 00:51:50.640, Speaker D: We'Re glow so far.
00:51:52.770 - 00:52:02.798, Speaker E: Yeah, I completely agree. The only other argument is that depending on the tax situation, NFTs will probably take a more favorable regulatory perspective.
00:52:02.894 - 00:52:11.800, Speaker C: What do you guys think? I know we're running short on time here, but did you see that BNB is using the Op stack to launch a layer two?
00:52:12.170 - 00:52:13.400, Speaker D: It seems like.
00:52:15.290 - 00:52:39.726, Speaker C: Zora was another NFT marketplace that announced that they were launching using Op stack. It feels like there's some traction that's at least just my sort of just looking at it perception and more and more protocols are using that. Is that your perception as well? I got to be honest, I haven't really looked into the finance like the BMB using Op stack, but it seems like there's some critical mass that's gaining there.
00:52:39.908 - 00:53:04.310, Speaker D: Doesn't make sense to me. To build an L two on a centralized L one with a permission validator set, you can literally have any scalability you want. Just like L two S are just probably a new opportunity to launch a token, frankly. And as we've talked about, the lowest effort thing that has the highest market cap return will get launched a lot until there's so many of them that they're all worth nothing. Enter all of the uniswap clones from 2021.
00:53:04.380 - 00:53:06.150, Speaker B: Very well said, Rip.
00:53:07.690 - 00:53:41.730, Speaker D: Aside from the L two S on finance and all that stuff or BNB. The thing I would like to see in this bear market, I would like to see CZ and Brian kind of bury the hatchet come together. You're literally the two last men standing. I feel like there's been a lot of beef between those two. Obviously very different regulatory approaches and probably viewpoints of the world as well. But we're going to have this TradFi carving up of Coinbase's business. I feel like a little bit it would be good to see them get on the same page, more so than they have been historically.
00:53:44.790 - 00:53:46.600, Speaker B: Good luck with that. Me too.
00:53:47.450 - 00:54:01.898, Speaker D: We got to bring the tribes together. Even Bitcoin. We don't hold a lot of Bitcoin, but respect the pump as Ivan on tech. Once pump you got to be there for the other folks. There's not many of us left.
00:54:02.064 - 00:54:04.666, Speaker B: As Ivan on Tech once said, I.
00:54:04.688 - 00:54:13.920, Speaker D: Used to watch those streams. It was so bizarre watching him turn into, like, a tech explainer to a guy who pumped coins. But that line that he said is just a classic, and it's true.
00:54:15.730 - 00:54:23.460, Speaker B: One day, we'll tell you about our influencer business that we created in the bottom of the bear market. But leave that for another time.
00:54:24.870 - 00:54:27.362, Speaker C: We don't I would love to just never talk about that again.
00:54:27.416 - 00:54:29.570, Speaker B: We should have the YouTube streamers.
00:54:31.590 - 00:54:32.900, Speaker D: Big growth business.
00:54:33.910 - 00:54:37.300, Speaker B: Yeah, that was chaos. Anything else this week, guys?
00:54:43.030 - 00:54:46.518, Speaker E: Well, no submarines for anybody soon, please.
00:54:46.684 - 00:54:48.454, Speaker D: Yeah, man.
00:54:48.492 - 00:54:54.422, Speaker C: So you need to feel bad for those people at the people were, like, mocking the people in the submarine. That made no sense to me.
00:54:54.476 - 00:54:56.162, Speaker E: Like, totally terrible.
00:54:56.226 - 00:54:59.910, Speaker C: Terrible way to go for people that are trapped at the bottom of the ocean.
00:55:00.290 - 00:55:06.810, Speaker E: Well, it sounds like it wasn't really trapped. It happened very fast, but crazy story nonetheless.
00:55:06.970 - 00:55:08.350, Speaker D: No submarines for anybody.
00:55:08.420 - 00:55:08.862, Speaker C: All right.
00:55:08.916 - 00:55:17.770, Speaker B: It's a good way to end it's.
