Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.570 - 00:00:35.030, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup on Bell Curve. You got Michael's, one and two, Yano and Miles, our six men sports reference.
00:00:36.570 - 00:00:42.380, Speaker A: You think Vance is getting nervous? Two back to back weeks, sitting him out, benched him?
00:00:43.550 - 00:00:45.162, Speaker C: I would be if I was him.
00:00:45.296 - 00:00:49.740, Speaker D: I would be your award right here, at the very least.
00:00:51.070 - 00:01:04.430, Speaker B: Personally, I don't know if I'm going to accept Vance back on this podcast. If he has any hair, I think he's got to go bald. That's why he's got to prove himself, no? We miss you, Vance. Vance is representing over in Japan.
00:01:06.790 - 00:01:11.380, Speaker A: Anything about his Japan trip? Any alpha from the other side?
00:01:13.190 - 00:01:33.100, Speaker C: Only stuff I've heard so far is that crypto is pervasive in Asia and a lot more so integrated into social applications and just more yeah, it seems to be something that is more embraced positively over there, which I think is a really good sign.
00:01:34.430 - 00:01:37.046, Speaker A: Yeah, he said he paid for his sushi with ETH.
00:01:37.158 - 00:01:39.478, Speaker B: Exactly why he would spend his ETH.
00:01:39.494 - 00:01:41.500, Speaker A: In time like this, I do not know, but.
00:01:43.550 - 00:01:45.514, Speaker B: Not sure. Believer.
00:01:45.562 - 00:01:46.160, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:46.610 - 00:02:29.674, Speaker B: All right, let's get into some of these stories. So I want to talk maybe we can kick this off just talking about Uniswap and their wallet being finally available on the Apple App Store. So this is following a monthly review by Apple, uniswap's mobile app has finally secured its place in the iOS App Store. It's now available for users in most countries, which includes the United States, according to a tweet from Uniswap Labs on Thursday. And Uniswap has assured people that they're going to continue to launch in other countries as soon as Apple lets them. So in addition to allowing swaps on the Ethereum mainnet, polygon, Arbitrum and optimism, users will also be able to track their NFT collections and purchase crypto with debit cards through MoonPay, which was an integration which was actually rolled out, I guess, last December. That's pretty cool.
00:02:29.674 - 00:02:54.034, Speaker B: That solves a big onboarding problem. But Miles, I know you actually were guinea pig and actually installed the wallet yourself and have some thoughts. But before we do that, Michael, I think on one of the earlier Bell Curves we were talking about the restriction that crypto apps not being able to get distributed on the Apple App Store app. So what are your sort of thoughts on the Uniswap mobile wallet making its way through?
00:02:54.232 - 00:03:44.674, Speaker C: Yeah, so historically, Apple has been incredibly difficult when anything ever touches crypto involved with an app that's under review by their app Store review process. And just as context, the review process is not something that's just there for any sort of crypto app. Historically there's been back and forth with major applications like Uber. I know that they got in trouble for some of the things that they've done. And really what the review process represents for any app that's trying to get into the App Store is a walled garden approach where they are the gatekeepers. They get to decide who's in there, who's not, and they effectively set the rules. When Apple has the App Store review guidelines, which are very infrequently updated, and a lot of people would probably say that they're antiquated in a lot of ways.
00:03:44.674 - 00:04:24.674, Speaker C: The way to think about them isn't a constitution that says, here are all the rules. Here's how we're going to be dealing with these different types of applications into perpetuity. Think of them as like an auto append list of rules that they decide kind of ad hoc as they see new applications. And so earlier, I think it was in October or November maybe, they came out with kind of a general perspective on specifically NFTs, where they said that NFTs, when you're purchasing an NFT in an application, would have to go through IAP, which is their in app purchase mechanism. A lot of people, I'd say that.
00:04:24.792 - 00:04:27.074, Speaker B: You had kind of polar perspectives on.
00:04:27.112 - 00:05:27.186, Speaker C: This adjustment, where you had some people who said, what the heck, IAP is great. But what is implicit within IAP is that Apple charges 30% to the seller of anything that goes through IAP. So if you're selling an NFT, for instance, which is considered digital content, apple wants their 30%. Obviously, if you're selling anything in a secondary transaction, it's going to be exceedingly difficult to have 30% be a take rate, effectively that the seller would have to abide by using this mechanism. This is definitely for NFTs and it's specific to that one category of purchasing, but it did show positive trajectory in just Apple being supportive and having rules around crypto writ large. And so that was kind of the other perspective. And some people said, hey, we're used to game developers are used to paying 30% for any digital content that's sold within the application.
00:05:27.186 - 00:06:14.690, Speaker C: And in fact, the fact that you get hundreds of millions of credit cards on file using IAP is actually more of a benefit than having to pay the 30%. The one thing that is of note here is that because I believe, and I haven't played around with it. So Miles, I'm curious to hear your perspectives. Uniswap, I believe is going to leverage a non custodial wallet. And there's a difference between what Apple considers to be a convertible virtual currency like Ethereum versus what they would consider to be digital content and NFT. And that's the reason why MoonPay is the payment provider. Whoever the payment provider is has to have money transmitter licenses to be able to facilitate transactions with convertible virtual currencies.
00:06:14.690 - 00:07:18.230, Speaker C: But in doing so, convertible virtual currencies are explicitly outside the scope of IAP, and it's not something that Apple will support. And so you won't have to pay the 30% fees, but it's only supported assets that Apple will be able to or that MoonPay supports that you'll be able to use in those apps. Once you get the assets into the app, that's when you can swap them around. But you can imagine if you want to buy something that's maybe not supported directly by MoonPay, the process would go USD to Ethereum, ethereum to whatever that asset is. The user experience is plenty, to say the least, but I do think that generally the recognition of Apple having an app that's going to be as widely used as Uniswap is a really big deal and I'm sure it'll get better over time. But the biggest thing that can happen for an app developer is to get approved. It's a lot harder to get approved than it is to have changes that go on once you're approved in the App Store because it's more of a conversation, less binary.
00:07:24.510 - 00:07:57.522, Speaker B: Honestly. Miles, I'd be curious to get your take of what the UIUX was like just because, on the one hand, I think we've talked on this podcast before about I know I was in the minority when I voiced this, but that it's a big deal that you can now buy in custody at least bitcoin, and I think Ethereum as well on fidelity. So it does seem like getting access to distribution that the App Store provides is definitely a huge boon. So I think in that sense it's pretty interesting. But Miles, I would love to get your understanding of what you thought about the user experience.
00:07:57.656 - 00:08:29.598, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. And maybe just to touch on one thing, last thing on, you know, I'd be very interested to hear what the discussions in the past month have sounded like, know, the Uniswap Labs teams and Apple, because it sounded like they were just getting know, there was basically radio silence for a long time. It almost reminded me of Coinbase shouting into the void for the SEC to tell them what to do in order to be okay. But yeah, I think maybe at some point we'll hear how those conversations went.
00:08:29.684 - 00:08:30.238, Speaker C: Very interesting.
00:08:30.324 - 00:08:54.280, Speaker A: It does seem like, Miles, there were some changes. Do you remember when they, maybe several months ago or three or four months ago, talked about this app coming out and there were like NFTs inside the app, there was a way to import private keys. They talked about support for MultiChain. I did notice that there's no support for MultiChain, no way to import a private key, I think. I haven't actually used it. And then I don't think there were NFTs inside the app.
00:08:54.810 - 00:08:57.000, Speaker B: There are, yeah, there are. Okay.
00:08:57.530 - 00:09:03.370, Speaker D: As far as I can tell, they did put out what they advertised.
00:09:04.670 - 00:09:11.546, Speaker A: Okay, then I'm wrong. I was thinking maybe they pulled it. Like basically pulled back, did a preliminary version to kind of get their foot in the door, but okay.
00:09:11.728 - 00:09:12.266, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:09:12.368 - 00:09:50.210, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, exciting announcement here from the Blockworks podcast network. We are hiring two podcast hosts to build a show with us called Lightspeed. TLDR of Lightspeed is that it is a show for builders, tinkerers, and lovers of technology. It's a callback to the heyday of Silicon Valley, where great tech was built in garages, not in corporate fortresses, and was truly the Wild West. Lightspeed is an exploration of crypto from the perspective of a builder and an engineer who's designing for scale and is interested in onboarding the next billion users into crypto. If this show sounds exciting to you, you have a background in podcast hosting or content creation, go to the Careers page of Blockworks. That's blockworks Co careers.
00:09:50.210 - 00:10:04.702, Speaker B: I've also linked it in the show notes here. You can just click there, it'll take you right to the page. You can also follow me on Twitter. I'm Mike Ipolito underscore. You can just slide right into my DMs and we'll set up some time to talk. Would love to hear from you. We are super, super excited about this show.
00:10:04.836 - 00:11:02.350, Speaker D: My overall high level take is that it's a decent V one. If I had to have a criticism, I would say that it doesn't provide a better experience than existing wallets for sophisticated crypto native users. But it also, you know, that's one side of the spectrum, but it also doesn't necessarily simplify the experience enough for brand new crypto users. I think that latter category is the intended audience that they're going for with this wallet. They know sophisticated crypto users are very comfortable interacting either directly with the protocol or on the UI. And so this is going after retail, right? And mainstream retail that might have been using a coinbase or an FTX in the last cycle. And so that's the perspective of the user I took as I tried to onboard.
00:11:02.350 - 00:12:03.986, Speaker D: And yeah, I guess some high level thoughts. I would say wallet creation is very easy. You could use an Icloud backup and Google social auth login to create a wallet, not have to remember backup your keys if you want to. The Fiat onramp process is pretty straightforward and simple. It took a couple of minutes for USDC to show up in my actual account balance, but I would say there's a few big pain points if I was a brand new crypto user who is trying this out for the first time. And I would say that when you're onboarding from MoonPay, it gives you all these different networks, right? So ethereum, optimism, arbitram, polygon, and each token has four different versions of it that you can on ramp to. So I'd first be like, what the hell are all these network? And why is there four different versions of every token? I have no idea.
00:12:03.986 - 00:12:18.294, Speaker D: What this means. Is there something I should know about if I onboard to optimism? Does that have features that Arbitrum doesn't have, or does it have less features than Ethereum has? So there's not much of an education there.
00:12:18.332 - 00:12:24.662, Speaker B: Yeah, miles, what would you do? Would you default just to one network, but then give people the option to do others, like switch?
00:12:24.806 - 00:13:00.726, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe I'll get to that at the end because I think it's related to the other pain points. I just chose USDC and optimism, and it did show up my wallet a few minutes later, which is great. But now, okay, I want to go swap that for another token. Let's say my friend said, hey, you should buy this lido token. It's going to moon. And I say, okay, let's look for lido. Fortunately, lido was in the optimism asset list, but I noticed that the optimism asset list is a lot smaller than the ethereum asset list.
00:13:00.726 - 00:13:25.786, Speaker D: A brand new crypto user might not know why. Right? But, okay, great. I've got USDC and I want to swap to lido. And now it's telling me that I don't have enough ETH in my wallet to pay for the transaction fees. And as a new user, I'd be like, what does that mean? That's annoying. Okay, now I have to go. Let's go swap for some ETH so I can pay these transaction fees.
00:13:25.786 - 00:14:33.234, Speaker D: And again, don't have enough ETH to make that swap. Right? So now I'm stuck going back to square one with the fiat on ramp and saying, okay, now I need to on ramp fiat directly to ETH, so I have some gas to spend. And that part wasn't clear to me. And so I think that there are two main things that would make this really powerful for mainstream user. First, I think that you need to abstract away all these networks and different types of assets. And so I would say if there could just be one version of every asset that shows up to the user and you don't have any sort of differentiation about networks, and then you basically just say if a user wants to swap from USD to Lido. This runs through some sort of ridge Dex aggregator that looks at all the uniswap markets, finds you the most efficient path to buy that based off of gas fees and liquidity and slippage and all that good stuff.
00:14:33.234 - 00:15:04.718, Speaker D: And then I have it in my wallet. And whether that's lido sitting on optimism or lido sitting on Arbitrum or L, one, I don't really care. I have exposure to lido now. Like, I got what I wanted. And then two, and I think this kind of leads into a bigger conversation, but with count abstraction, there's a lot of things that would make this experience a lot more frictionless. First of all, get rid of gas fees. Going back to square one, if I was a new user, I would have probably churned right there.
00:15:04.718 - 00:15:39.980, Speaker D: I don't want to go through that again. So pay gas fees on behalf of users. I think that's more than reasonable. And you also have more secure account recovery methods than maybe this EOA path using the icloud backup and you can split keys and all that good stuff. Yeah, I think that those are the two main things that I would say to take this to the next level. When you go in your Coinbase wallet, it doesn't tell you which network version of every asset you want to buy. Right.
00:15:39.980 - 00:16:11.540, Speaker D: So I worry that V one, it's a great start, but it's kind of in no man's land where it's not necessarily catering to the sophisticated crypto native users and it's not trying to, frankly, but it needs a couple more improvements to really compete with a centralized Exchange app for newbies folks that have not ever tried this. My that's my product review.
00:16:11.910 - 00:16:42.510, Speaker A: Miles, why do you think that this is just for why do you say that they're really focusing on new folks here? Because my understanding, when I think about this product, I don't think that a new user to crypto who owns no bitcoin and no ETH, I don't think they're going direct to uniswap here. This product feels like for the four of us, where the four of us been in crypto for a while, own crypto, still don't have a mobile experience like a crypto native mobile experience. And I've wanted to use the MetaMask app for years.
00:16:42.660 - 00:16:44.110, Speaker B: It's just god awful.
00:16:44.690 - 00:16:47.360, Speaker A: That's who I thought this product would be for.
00:16:48.050 - 00:16:54.478, Speaker D: That's fair. I think the main objective is to capture retail flow with this app, right?
00:16:54.644 - 00:16:55.166, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:55.268 - 00:16:56.240, Speaker B: Should look like.
00:16:59.810 - 00:17:00.406, Speaker C: That'S.
00:17:00.458 - 00:17:29.900, Speaker D: Whether that's retail flow that is an existing crypto user, that's a small, relatively small bubble, right? And then whether it's retail flow, that's maybe just a centralized Exchange user, that's at least 100 million people right there. So that's a much bigger audience. Maybe this is their onboarding experience. And then there's the folks that have never tried anything crypto related before. And to your point, don't see them going straight to this uniswap app.
00:17:30.910 - 00:18:15.382, Speaker C: Part of me wonders to go back to one of the things you're saying Miles, is just like what the conversations? You know, you submit an application, they assigned you a reviewer, and then you start the conversation with that reviewer to basically say, okay, here's what we're going to do. Here's the things you need to change. It is a dialogue to a certain extent. I would wonder if part of that dialogue was this cannot be a custodial experience. In the same way that Apple is preventing in a lot of ways the Coinbase application or the Coinbase wallet application, which they talked about. If they have to list all the different networks, if it has to be a separate wallet where you can't import your private keys. I wonder if these are limitations.
00:18:15.382 - 00:19:14.526, Speaker C: And this is kind of what I having dealt with the App Store review team a few times. I wonder if that's just like, limitations that they said, okay, you want to have this? This is what we need. And I also think the other thing too, just as a blanket statement on App Store reviews is, like I said, it's an auto append list of all the different rules and it's ever increasing, never decreasing. But it's also not suggestive that because Uniswap got in with this particular format, that they are able to then build a playbook around this and all the other applications that want App Store approval are going to have to go the same route and build the same way as Uniswap. It is really a specific use case by use case for each of the different applications that are going through the process. So doesn't mean like, because Uniswap got in, we now have a playbook for how to get every other app in. It's really just like because Uniswap got in, this is a big signal that maybe there's an open dialogue that could.
00:19:14.548 - 00:20:26.980, Speaker D: Be, you know, similar to the Staking dialogue. On the regulatory side, I think this general direction that we're getting now is the more of just a pass through you are or a way to interact with the protocol rather than making the experience, doing things outside of the protocol to make the experience better or smoother. That protects you a little bit, but it would be too bad if that was actually stopping them from doing things that don't necessarily make this a custodial app. I think if you put in a Dex Bridge aggregator, something like a socket network behind the scenes, don't it's still not custodial, right? You're just abstracting the UX complexity away a little bit, right? But if the Apple Store is saying it has to be kind of wonky and complicated because that's what a true just pass through to interact with the protocol should look like, then we're in a tough spot. But account abstraction also does help a lot with at least some of these pain points.
00:20:29.990 - 00:21:19.638, Speaker B: A lot of people focus, especially in crypto, right? It's very easy to be like, hey, Apple is trying to throttle us and all this stuff. And people focus on the 30% take rate that Apple takes in their App Store. But the truth is, from Apple's perspective, that they're trying to when apps originally started to get launched, there were tons of scams and really poor user experiences. And part of the reason why Apple has that append only list is to protect users, right? Like they view when people go to the App Store, apple wants you to be able to trust that you're not going to get scammed and that your experience is generally going to be relatively good. So to be honest with you, I can actually sort of if this is what the conversation sounded like, I could definitely see it from Apple's perspective that hey, guys, people lose their private keys all the time. It's an insane user experience. We don't want the liability of our brand or this isn't the experience that we want our users to have.
00:21:19.724 - 00:21:27.080, Speaker D: I could be wrong, just wanted to call it out, but I'm pretty sure it did give me the option either to create a new wallet or import.
00:21:27.790 - 00:21:30.026, Speaker B: You can. Yeah, you can.
00:21:30.208 - 00:21:35.722, Speaker A: And Miles, could you sign up with an email address?
00:21:35.856 - 00:22:10.486, Speaker D: Yeah, because I spun up a new wallet and then chose the most web two path on board through that. Then it was fairly easy. It was basically sending choosing a Google account and doing a two step verification. It's I think I had to know backup your keys with icloud or something like that, which I'm sure how does.
00:22:10.508 - 00:22:17.854, Speaker A: This little thing get through? I just looked this up. This is the only uniswap app in the App Store right now. It's a fake. That's a scam.
00:22:18.002 - 00:22:25.654, Speaker D: Yeah, you have to actually click the link from their Twitter post that frankly.
00:22:25.702 - 00:23:07.206, Speaker C: Is just like an App Store. It's so new that it hasn't been picked up by the search algorithms yet. That happens a lot though. So Mike, I totally agree with all of what you were saying. I do think mean, my personal perspective, just broadly, not on apps specifically, is that it did start off as a form of protection to make sure that the quality of the apps that are in the App Store is as high as possible. I do think, and there are a number of lawsuits ongoing currently that contend that Apple is extracting monopolistic power with its 30%. So, yeah, I agree with that.
00:23:07.206 - 00:23:24.250, Speaker C: The intention probably started off to make sure that the quality bar was high, but at this point there is no level of competition, there's no opportunity unless you're in a specific category where they don't want to support their payment method, where they force you to use the 30% fee.
00:23:25.410 - 00:23:36.500, Speaker B: It's always a little bit of both. People tend to view it in binary, but usually there is like a good reason for that being the case, and then there's probably a more extractive reason and they can both be true.
00:23:37.270 - 00:24:41.880, Speaker C: So the fact that I think is the biggest one is when you are using Apple IAP to make purchases within your app, they're charging 30% whenever someone's making a purchase. It's only for digital content. So something that effectively has a zero marginal cost to produce and therefore they feel like 30% is fair, but also they have hundreds of millions of credit cards and people on the other side of that. So not only are they just saying, hey, we're going to sit right here in the middle and charge 30%, we're also going to create the ability for the demand side to just easily onboard and seamlessly pay for things. So I do think that there is a benefit to it in certain situations, but once again, when you have selling of digital content, in the case of crypto, it's NFTs when you're selling convertible virtual currencies like ETH and USDC, it doesn't have to go through IFB that's where MoonPay steps in. I also have had I don't know if you guys have used MoonPay. Miles, one question I was going to ask you is have you previously used MoonPay and did you have a track record with them? Okay.
00:24:44.410 - 00:24:51.500, Speaker D: Yes. And then picture my ID and do like a little liveness check, all that good stuff.
00:24:52.190 - 00:25:07.034, Speaker C: Exactly. And it's debit card only and the auth rates on those, depending on what your bank rate, depending on what your bank is, the auth rates I've seen somewhere in like the 60% to 70%. So 30% to 40% of those transactions.
00:25:07.082 - 00:25:08.190, Speaker B: Aren'T even going through.
00:25:08.340 - 00:25:17.300, Speaker D: Wow, I did see that. Yeah, it said if you use a credit card or if you use a debit card, there's a 35% greater chance. True.
00:25:18.310 - 00:25:49.926, Speaker B: Okay, no bueno. I will say though, even though I think all these are really fair criticisms, miles, is that good on Uniswap for doing this? Right. I think historically the journey for people going on chain has been having their first experience be with a centralized exchange and then staying there for a long time and then kind of migrating to on chain. And this is I think the first meaningful shot that we've had at just onboarding people directly onto being on chain, which I think is definitely a step in the right direction.
00:25:50.118 - 00:26:45.440, Speaker C: 100% agree. One of the things that I think is going to be really interesting to see is how does Uniswap the protocol interface with Uniswap the wallet and what's the business model respectively for each of those and stakeholders? Is the team now moving over into Uniswap the wallet and focusing on that? Are they going to be charging an additional fee on top of that and have it be a centralized business? That was kind of what people were talking about when they raised all that money. It will be interesting to see how you can have centralized businesses that are spawned out of decentralized protocols that then are extracting additional rent on top of the protocols that they originally built. I think that part is going to be really fascinating to see if the competition drives that down or if they're able to build the beachhead with customers to be able to have a user retail flow actually derive value for uniswap the wallet. Yeah, going to be interesting.
00:26:46.130 - 00:27:45.490, Speaker D: I think you could make a similar analogy to the way that Ethereum has kind of scaled and developed, I think uniswap similar to Ethereum. L one, you keep the protocol as conservative as possible and there's very little that they're doing at the protocol level. They just kind of upgrade to another version every couple of years and you drive the complexity and the really complex stuff that's going to help you scale and get distribution up the stack, basically. And in this case, it's out of governance. But I would say, like, the ethereum analogy is where you're seeing the roll ups and all of the kind of abstractions starting as far away from the L one as possible and the mev supply chain. And so I think that that's kind of the strategy here. And frankly, it's a lot easier to build sort of these products outside of the scope of governance.
00:27:45.490 - 00:28:33.982, Speaker D: And I think that's the main thing here. I would say my other observation is that I think they're going for less of a wallet, but more of this app or super app that has a wallet attached to it. Right. I don't think they want to make people think that they're downloading a wallet. I think eventually they'll show up and they'll see like, okay, here's a portfolio of different things I can do and apps I can use, and whether or not they skim something off the top or even implement like an order flow auction sort of model here. And that to me, would make a lot of sense. And yeah, I think that only accrues directly back to Uniswap Labs in terms of the revenue.
00:28:33.982 - 00:28:39.490, Speaker D: But the volume, if they're successful, drives value to Uniswap protocol.
00:28:41.190 - 00:28:53.506, Speaker B: Yeah, it's almost like if they had optimized in their UX for retail users and you're producing a bunch of dumb order flow, that'd be pretty good timing if order flow auctions become more and more prevalent.
00:28:53.538 - 00:28:53.686, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:53.708 - 00:29:34.318, Speaker B: That'd be an extremely good revenue model. Although, again, just to take the other side of this, if I were designing the UX for this wallet, one of the examples that would be burned into my brain is Coinbase's launch of their NFT platform, which was a pretty big flop. And think about all the takes after that, which was like, all you had to do was replicate the design of OpenSea and you would have been golden. And instead they tried to make it more web two e. And who knows, this is probably a challenge that people on the Internet might remember. I just wasn't around. But there's probably a challenging period of time where the users that existed were like very techy users who knew how to use the browser and stuff like that, and eventually they had to make the transition to mainstream.
00:29:34.318 - 00:30:19.746, Speaker B: But I'm sure there was a really tough period of time where UX and UI people were sort of stuck in the miles. I had a question for you, actually, that was so one of the maybe challenges, maybe opportunities between Uniswap Labs and Uniswap the Dao is that you've got two different instruments with appreciation there. There's like, you need the token and then there's Uniswap Labs equity. So in an ideal world, you mentioned in account abstraction where it is a no brainer right, for the protocols to pay for gas fees. Now, where would they, like, I would assume the way that. Uniswap would afford to do that.
00:30:19.768 - 00:30:19.906, Speaker D: Right.
00:30:19.928 - 00:30:30.514, Speaker B: It wouldn't be a permanent thing, but they would do it for some period of time from uni the token. Right. They would sell off some of their treasury in Uni token or no. You think it would come from Uniswap Labs?
00:30:30.642 - 00:30:59.214, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I could be wrong, and this hasn't been implemented on one of the roll ups yet, but I do get the sense that Uniswap Labs would basically just fund this paymaster that provides that pays gas on behalf of users. I honestly think that that's potentially a good investment, a good positive ROI for them.
00:30:59.412 - 00:31:01.150, Speaker A: Can you explain that? Can you say more?
00:31:01.300 - 00:32:16.070, Speaker D: Yeah, basically imagine this is on a roll up with account abstraction, and these are all 4337 transactions instead of regular transactions. So without going into it too much, this will basically run through its own mem pool that sits above kind of the main execution environment, and the transactions are bundled and relayed over to basically a paymaster. And I believe that you can say set the parameters of the paymaster so that any address that has been identified as a Uniswap wallet address is eligible to be, okay, I'll pay gas for you. And then let's say another 4337 transaction comes in that's not from Uniswap wallet, then they would have to pay for their own gas. I could be wrong, really, honestly just started thinking about this as I was testing it out today, but to me that sounds like something that would likely come from Uniswap Labs. I think they could fund basically a.
00:32:16.220 - 00:32:56.998, Speaker C: Gas account, especially if you default to an L two, and that becomes the default location for where these assets, as they're put in from USD, originate in the application itself. I think that that obviously would alleviate a lot of the user onboarding flow for the archetype of user that you were pretending to be. Miles and honestly would probably be a really interesting test just to see what account abstraction actually can bring in terms of user growth. And there are plenty of other roadblocks in the onboarding flow, as we discussed. But I think that that would be a huge one, especially for someone who's never been in crypto before.
00:32:57.084 - 00:34:16.990, Speaker D: Yeah, 100%. I think the motivation to or I guess the incentives to vertically integrate up the stack into your own wallet are really powerful. You're just cementing that relationship with the user by having them also be not only the app you interact with, but the touch point to interact with the app. I think that prior to account abstraction, and still today, because we've got probably a year until account abstraction is really widely implemented, it was very few apps that had the amount of leverage over their users and the network itself to say, we're going to build an EOA wallet and put people through this experience. And Uniswap is one of them, OpenSea is the other one, and it's awesome. To see what the first version of this could look like with the uni wallet. But I think that this idea of headless wallets that is enabled with account abstraction or another way of framing it is like embedded wallets, which is possible, is going to open this vertical integration or vertical expansion up to a lot of different apps that don't have that same level of leverage.
00:34:17.490 - 00:35:06.190, Speaker C: And just to piggyback on that concept, one of the dominant conversations that at least we're having with games and games have probably the potential to be one of the largest N. I think historically they also have been the largest N in terms of users per application on chain. And as more games launch, I think we'll be able to see more of that on chain. But a lot of those users are not paying customers. They're free to play users that come in and if there is an actual cost to playing, maybe they wouldn't come in, maybe they wouldn't convert. But that's probably the dominant narrative right now, which is how do we get rid of what they call the wallet wall? How do we have somebody sign up for this game? There's a wallet that's created on the back end. It's pre funded by the company that's building the game itself.
00:35:06.190 - 00:35:49.578, Speaker C: If there are any on chain transactions, they're abstracted away from the user and paid. The gas is paid on behalf of the company itself. And I think that's going to be kind of generally how these consumer applications grow and launch and scale and then it just becomes a question of how long are you willing to subsidize the gas fees for a user who doesn't pay? It's going to make the point of monetization for these users be at different levels than what we've seen for previous games or previous applications just because there is this operating cost, this cost associated with every single user that comes on chain. So it's going to be really interesting. But that's a dominant conversation that's happening in the DMs ecosystem right now.
00:35:49.664 - 00:35:58.030, Speaker D: Yeah, seems like it's a future cost of revenue line item for most. Right, so retention and an acquisition.
00:35:58.770 - 00:37:13.766, Speaker B: You know what else isn't just something that we've talked about in previous episodes is Coinbase's Wallet as a service offering as well. So now you might get this super potent combination of account abstraction happening at the same time that Coinbase will whitelist a wallet for you. And it just solves two of these enormous pain points to the point where app developers can focus on building their applications that people actually want to use. And Miles, you and I talked a lot about the Fappening, which is the Fat Happening, interesting title for a Z Prime article, but it's the idea that there could be these gigantic Fat apps in crypto and it's kind of like who ultimately owns the relationship with the customer? Is it the wallet? And maybe the user experience is, you have your wallet and it gives you really easy access to all these different apps that you want to use. So you would open your wallet on your phone and kind of use that. Or maybe it's the app that the user feels the tight relationship with and ultimately starting with the app and then having a nice wallet built on top of that, like uniswap is just going to ease the friction of people doing what they already wanted to do, which was use the app. And then that's kind of your Trojan horse way in which honestly, as I say it out loud, that sounds a lot more that sounds like sorry, if.
00:37:13.788 - 00:37:35.710, Speaker C: We double click into that, are you saying that an application would plug into the uniswap application? So you have a game that's downloaded or an application that's downloaded and you've got uniswap that's downloaded all on your phone, all on your home screen. You've pre funded your uniswap wallet. Your uniswap app and other applications would be able to leverage account abstraction via your uniswap wallet.
00:37:36.690 - 00:38:23.950, Speaker D: Or it's maybe know uniswap either through expanding horizontally themselves or by finding close know. You log in like they are the aggregator essentially where you are on the uniswap wallet home screen. Because they started with a protocol, they built a brand off of that. Now they have enough leverage over the user that they'll take them with them. And then it's a question of, okay, now we've got you here, how do we keep you here and buying and doing more and more things, right? And then it's like a buy partner build sort of exercise on their end to determine if they pull in other apps that are close partners or if they want to do more acquisitions or expand horizontally.
00:38:24.370 - 00:38:27.162, Speaker C: Everybody wants to be the back end wallet service provider.
00:38:27.226 - 00:38:28.510, Speaker D: It's so funny.
00:38:29.490 - 00:38:47.170, Speaker C: It reminds me of, I don't know, maybe like 1015 years ago where everybody wanted to build the dominant JavaScript framework to build web apps in and it was like, okay, we've got twelve dominant JavaScript. I'm going to build one that's going to supersede all of them. And like, congratulations, now we have 13 dominant.
00:38:47.670 - 00:39:00.234, Speaker A: But I think there's a big opportunity for other wallet as a service companies to compete with Coinbase because there are a lot of companies that are not going to use Coinbase's Wallet as a service because they compete with Coinbase in one way or another.
00:39:00.432 - 00:39:24.510, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd say there's no shortage of them in the space right now just from having conversations. It's like a very hot area. And I think that there's a spectrum of different kind of solutions here with Coinbase wallet as the surface being on one end of the spectrum where basically you let Coinbase also have the ability to help you recover your keys. So it's almost like this I could be wrong.
00:39:24.660 - 00:39:45.430, Speaker A: Well, coinbase only gives you the SDK. Like if you want a UI UX on top of it too. Like, let's say you're Macy's and you want to give someone a wallet as a service, but you don't want just the SDK. You want like a nice front end of the file. You might use Bitsky's Wallet as a service or Magic has a wallet as a service. So it's like, I think how much of the stack do you want to control basically?
00:39:45.500 - 00:40:23.726, Speaker D: Right, exactly. Even Fireblocks is getting into all these games with more retail or B to B to C sort of offerings. And then the other side of the spectrum, you've got like Biconomy and Ox Pass and a few other really interesting providers. Even the Safe SDK is another one that are kind of building this. You've got like a suite of tools and bells and whistles that you can add to this app specific wallet that's all white labeled for your brand and everything like that. And it's just all happening in the background. Yeah, I see that's.
00:40:23.726 - 00:40:35.320, Speaker D: Kind of one of the big unlocks of account abstraction is this idea of having an account on every app you use without having to spin up this painful wallet experience.
00:40:36.090 - 00:40:57.738, Speaker C: I do wonder though, every single application has an account that's abstracted for you, specifically for you. You have some assets that are in there. Maybe they're NFTs. Maybe it's ETH. Maybe USDC. It doesn't really matter. Going to the hundred different applications that you have used at some point and going and retrieving the residual value that's left in those wallets is going to be painful.
00:40:57.738 - 00:41:15.714, Speaker C: Yeah, there is a fragmentation issue where it would be nice, hypothetically, if there was a single wallet and it was a white label service and everybody could just have that be the one thing and everybody's trying to be that one thing. Right, but fragmentation becomes an issue.
00:41:15.832 - 00:41:48.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I see two solutions. It's either it's like you have one EOA that is kind of like your actual bank account, right. And then you can know that EOA control these other smart accounts that are know your Venmo balance equivalent or you've got a service provider opportunity to aggregate all your accounts on some other app. Right. It's like if you used Google to sign in or to create a smart account, like aggregate know, smart account associated with my Google login, I think I.
00:41:48.740 - 00:42:15.814, Speaker B: Kind of understand why. I've heard Fred Wilson actually on a podcast a couple of years ago. He had this little line that stuck with me, which was he never really could. He had this idea that actually your Google Maps or your Apple Maps should be kind of your home screen of choice for something like Uber. Right. So instead of signing into Uber, the app, you would just log on to Google and then you could call an Uber to your location or you could order food from your location. But he just kind of never really played out.
00:42:15.814 - 00:42:41.440, Speaker B: And I kind of think the reason for that is like the simplest. You already have a wallet. It's called your. So like, when you want to do something like call an Uber or order food, I don't want to log into another app on my phone and then go through that. I just want to be able to go to it the quickest way possible. And I sort of think that's why it hasn't necessarily played out like that.
00:42:42.610 - 00:42:52.286, Speaker C: I would also say there's just such a huge vested interest in Uber maintaining that customer relationship that they would never want to be a feature in Google Maps.
00:42:52.398 - 00:43:04.150, Speaker B: Totally. And that's another good reason why none of the apps that ultimately end up gaining a whole bunch of users and they have funds and traction and all that stuff, they're going to be incentivized to not just be a feature in a wallet.
00:43:05.050 - 00:43:53.782, Speaker C: In the equivalent would be you could say, okay, I want to leverage the Google Maps API, and we're going to build the big partnership with them and know, Google Maps wants to actually now have us be a feature within their map. It's like, okay, great, we'll just go to Apple Maps or Mapbox or any of the other providers and have the same experience. Competition ultimately will drive this in the direction of, I think, where probably the best outcomes will exist. And frankly, Uber would not be a service. They wouldn't be able to test different applications. They wouldn't be able to test different services that they provide if they weren't their own standalone application. So I'd much rather have Uber be a standalone app versus a feature within a maps application, even though that may be in some ways a better user experience.
00:43:53.782 - 00:44:01.020, Speaker C: But I think the best user experience is having a sustainable business that can provide car services as a standalone application.
00:44:02.750 - 00:44:39.510, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's right. I think the big difference there is that Uber can actually block people from the only way you can use Uber is through their own app, right? Where I would say there will be like an like they can't block people from using Know by saying you can only use it through the ave specific app or wallet in this case. So it's a little bit more challenging to kind of create those moats, I would say, and really own the relationship here because there's so many different entry points to interact with these protocols.
00:44:40.250 - 00:45:03.814, Speaker B: I wonder if another challenge too, just from a marketing standpoint, advert. When it's advertising or doing its marketing, netflix doesn't go around and say, hey, subscribe to Netflix. What it does is it advertises its shows. So you're like, hey, this show looks good. I want to go watch that show. So if you're only a wallet, the way you get people to sign up is, hey, we're a great wallet. Download our wallet.
00:45:03.814 - 00:45:23.460, Speaker B: And then immediately my reaction in my head is like, I don't want to download something else. I already have so many apps on my phone. I'm loaded up with apps here, but if you start from the perspective of uniswap and I'm like, oh, I want to trade oh, and they have this wallet, like, yeah, I'll just do know. And I think it might just be like it's eliminating a step instead of adding something else.
00:45:24.870 - 00:45:26.226, Speaker D: I think that's right.
00:45:26.408 - 00:46:08.626, Speaker C: I was also going to know not to put the cart in front of the horse here, but okay, great. You've loaded up your wallet, you've loaded up your uniswap account, you put some cash on, you've traded some coins around. What next? Is it sort of the Miles description of the app store within uniswap that has the uniswap backend for the wallet? Maybe account abstraction eases the onboarding. Are you able to take those assets off of uniswap easily and use them in other applications, like from iPhone app to iPhone app? And it does beg the question as to definitely have done my fair share of trading crypto tokens. But what next, I think is kind of the question that I get to.
00:46:08.728 - 00:46:35.466, Speaker D: Because that's not like a come back every single day sort of activity. Right. You'll get them there, but then you need ways to keep that engagement up and again yeah, I think that's probably expanding horizontally into complementary products and whether or not they just compound you can come on this now, or whether they decide to actually build out the stuff themselves will be interesting.
00:46:35.648 - 00:46:43.758, Speaker B: Yep. Can we talk about the Saga Solana's phone? Because actually that kind of segues into michael, what are you going to say before we go?
00:46:43.844 - 00:46:49.070, Speaker C: I was just going to say the one thing that I do know that Apple hates is app stores within apps.
00:46:50.930 - 00:46:53.198, Speaker D: That's true. That's true. Interesting.
00:46:53.364 - 00:47:32.874, Speaker B: Hurts the monopoly. Yeah. But let's talk a little bit about so Solana a little while ago announced Saga, which is going to be their foray into their own Android phone. And it's sort of the first swing at a crypto friendly mobile stack. So the reason we're talking about this now is they just announced that the Saga is going to be available for customers in the United States, EU, UK, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. You're going to be able to order the phone starting on May eigth. And the whole point basically is you're trying to integrate web3 into a mobile experience, which the majority of users in crypto are mobile, at least it's designated by kind of web traffic and stuff like that.
00:47:32.874 - 00:48:20.540, Speaker B: There hasn't really been a great mobile experience so far. And having being vertically integrated into a phone and a full stack sort of mobile suite that allows you to do things that you couldn't do if you only controlled the software. So there are four kind of pillars to Saga, which are it's got a seed, it's like crypto native, you can store your seed phrase mobile. There's a vault that's built into the phone. There's a mobile wallet adapter, there's Solana Pay and there's a Solana DAP store. So kind of in reverse order know, Michael, you're talking about some of the you that these apps are going to have going through the Apple Web Store. Well, now Solana has basically tried to take matters into its own hand and they have their own DAP Store that comes native on the phone.
00:48:20.540 - 00:49:06.474, Speaker B: They also have Solana Pay, which kind of exactly as it sounds. Think about Apple Pay or Venmo on your phone, how easy it is when you just use, which I use all the time now Apple Pay, I use it almost exclusively, but you just go like ding it at a register or something like that. The theory is you could do that with Solana as well. So I think it sounds super cool. It's definitely like a big bold swing at something which I always report when people do big bold swings. I think the challenge is there's a big difference between being a software organization and then a hardware organization, which is definitely more capital intensive, more operationally intensive, and definitely folks have struggled kind of trying to do that in house. So I don't know what you guys think.
00:49:06.474 - 00:49:10.860, Speaker B: I think it's basically very cool. If it works. It's definitely going to be a challenge as well, though.
00:49:12.450 - 00:50:22.258, Speaker C: As an anecdote. I was actually having dinner with one of my good friends, actually, the guy that introduced me in Vance originally last night, and he works for a large technology company based in Cupertino and he has been working on a project for, I think over seven years at this point. He and I were actually interns there in 2011, which is how we met and has been working on this hardware project and working his butt off too for the last number of years. And I think the thing that you don't really necessarily see is how hard hardware really is, especially when you're going up against behemoths like the Apples, the metas of the world, where when they are doing an R and D project, their budget for R and D is unlimited. It is infinite. It is something where there's no venture backed company that can come close to competing. Even meta to a certain extent has had to shut down.
00:50:22.258 - 00:50:27.640, Speaker C: A lot of the Oculus stuff that they were working on when they started Cost Reality Labs exactly.
00:50:30.330 - 00:50:31.046, Speaker B: All of the.
00:50:31.068 - 00:51:20.680, Speaker C: Things that are in the components of Saga. I hope that their phone is good enough because I completely agree with all the directions that the phone could be taken. But it is just so hard to build good hardware at scale and have that be something that's usable such that I want to be carrying around this device to be able to pay for things in person. And I think that's just ultimately going to be the biggest challenge, how you can build a hardware organization and the other antidote I have is when I was at Snap, one of the big things that we were working on was the spectacles. And that was a completely separate team, that was a completely separate operation. And frankly, they had to be completely separate because you had to run the company completely separately. And it's not something that you can mix and match.
00:51:20.680 - 00:51:41.110, Speaker C: It's very incredibly difficult to mix and match hardware and software. And there are probably only a few examples, apple being one of them, that has done it well, but it is just an exceedingly difficult technical problem as well as organizational issue. So I hope the best, frankly. But those are the roadblocks that I foresee.
00:51:41.270 - 00:52:41.914, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that. And I also think it's great that they're taking a big swing at this. I can see the rationale, right? We just talked about the Apple Store issues, right, and how that is really a potential dependency risk for the growth of mobile crypto apps. And two, if you just look back at the apps that have driven the most usage on Solana, for the most part, they're gaming very retail friendly apps that are best interacted with on mobile. And I would say maybe that's generally what they're going for. They're trying to reduce dependency risk and they're trying to make these, I would say web3 retail focused apps as good as possible. But I did get the sense that a lot of that activity was coming from Asia when it was at its peak.
00:52:41.914 - 00:53:09.850, Speaker D: And so I think it is interesting, but I don't see I'd be curious to know how much of those users are actually in these countries where this will be available, because Apple's just got such an enormous moat in the US at least, and Android's much more common in other parts of the world. And so if I were them, I'd be thinking about going to those users.
00:53:13.470 - 00:53:46.670, Speaker A: I think there's a lot to learn from the Amazon phone. So in 2014, Amazon released the Fire, if you guys remember that, and they were trying to compete with so it's the iPhone galaxy and the Google Pixel. And there are two main reasons I think that that failed. The Amazon phone failed. First is, like Michael was saying, they spent all this time on hardware and features that were really flashy and sexy, but users didn't actually want. And I think their big thing that they were really focused on in 2014 was 3D. So that made the phone really expensive.
00:53:46.670 - 00:54:32.018, Speaker A: But then once they released it, they realized that no one actually needed or wanted those features. And then the second thing is that they forked the Android operating system and they came out with the Fire OS operating system. And so what that meant was that and their thesis for doing that is they're like, oh, this is going to create this huge ecosystem of apps and app builders and developers who want to come build these new experiences on top of the Fire OS ecosystem. But what ended up happening in reality is a year after launching, it was basically just a dead ecosystem and there were no good apps. So like a year after launching, there's still like no Google Maps competitor on the Fire OS. And so I think that you can make a comparison to the Solana phone. So we played around with it at the blockworks office today.
00:54:32.018 - 00:54:48.006, Speaker A: The flashy feature comparison could be like, there are all these really cool things you can do in it, so you can take a picture and immediately mint that picture as an NFT. And that's something I'm like, oh, that's cool, but I don't really know if people want to do that. And there's a lot of those kind.
00:54:48.028 - 00:54:48.870, Speaker B: Of features in there.
00:54:48.940 - 00:54:50.646, Speaker A: And then the operating system too, it's.
00:54:50.678 - 00:54:52.342, Speaker B: Like, yeah, they have their whole DAP.
00:54:52.406 - 00:55:17.620, Speaker A: Store and that's just like if there end up being these use cases on top of Solana and on top of crypto, native people build fun things to do on crypto rails, then yeah, that booms. But it could also be an ecosystem that there's not much action happening. I think that's a decent comparison to make is looking back at the flop of the FirePhone to see what went wrong.
00:55:17.990 - 00:55:32.354, Speaker C: Mean, keep in mind, Apple did not open up the App Developer Store or the ability for third party developers to come onto the platform for two years. It was only the official Apple.
00:55:32.402 - 00:55:34.150, Speaker A: Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know that. Okay.
00:55:34.220 - 00:55:44.630, Speaker C: It was only the official Apple apps that were approved. And then I think in 2009 was the first year with the you're saying Apple, not Amazon?
00:55:44.710 - 00:55:45.302, Speaker A: The apple.
00:55:45.366 - 00:56:49.358, Speaker C: Apple? Apple didn't allow third party developers onto the App Store until the I think it was the iPhone 3G, which was two years after the first gen. So I think there is an element of, like, you need to prove out the hardware, you need to prove out the use cases. But here's a different question. What are the probably most used applications that you have in crypto right now? Uniswap or like yeah, I'm saying like DApps. But the point is, if Solana was to have those DApps as applications that were in their DAP Store as opposed to specifically Solana applications, would that make it more useful? My take is yes. The advantage here could be just having an open ecosystem for DAP developers to get into a mobile experience, a mobile hardware, and not necessarily have it be limited to a single blockchain. That could be kind of what I would say.
00:56:49.524 - 00:56:52.062, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that. Maybe I agree with that.
00:56:52.116 - 00:57:45.362, Speaker B: I do know people don't really talk about it like this a lot, but if you are able to and by the way, every point taken there, Michael, that it's very difficult in terms of to execute right on hardware versus software. But if you are successful in manufacturing hardware device that people actually want to use. It's really effective distribution. People forget that's how Microsoft Kind, they cleaned up back in the day doing exactly that. And I have heard it's hard for Zuck to bemoan at all how Facebook has played out. But I also know that part of the reason why they've invested so much in reality labs is there was a strategic decision to be only software for a while and they kind of regretted never having the hardware and the vertical integration there. So again, it's kind of like if you can execute it, it might pay off super well, but it also could be a big bet.
00:57:45.362 - 00:57:51.842, Speaker B: And yeah, I don't know, I always just like to support big bets that are taken.
00:57:51.896 - 00:57:54.260, Speaker A: I'm rooting for it too. I'm definitely rooting for.
00:57:58.070 - 00:58:15.930, Speaker B: Guys. I know we talked about this last week, but it does this is happening in basically one day. We got ChappellA coming up. So Michael, I know you know, some initial thoughts there. I don't want know keep hitting the audience with stuff we've already talked about, but what are your sort of updated thoughts on Bella?
00:58:16.430 - 00:59:21.150, Speaker C: My updated thoughts are kind of what the narrative is on Twitter right now, which is it seems to have gone decently well. There's some talk of some of the blocks. I don't know exactly what's going on, but it seems like some of the mining pools are missing proposals which suggest just some network issues. But I do think the big thing to note is the withdrawal queue is probably not as large as most people suspected. It was interesting to see that the withdrawal queue leading up to the actual hard fork was about half the size of what was signaled for withdrawal after the hard fork happened, which just kind of tells me people maybe forgot about it and maybe they saw what happened and they said, oh, now I'll signal for withdrawal. But yeah, generally it looks like about 150,000,000 of ETH is going to be able to be withdrawn per day and that will probably take another like ten to 15 days to process. Unclear whether or not that's desired to sell or whether or not it's just movement of assets.
00:59:21.150 - 00:59:41.560, Speaker C: One thing that we were talking about was tax day is officially five days away from when we're recording this. So there could be some element of that interesting timing to have the withdrawal queue available. But yeah, I'd say probably a lot less than what we expected is kind of the summary from our end.
00:59:43.770 - 00:59:48.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have many updated thoughts. I sort of agree with all that.
00:59:48.670 - 01:00:10.830, Speaker D: Yeah, me either. It'll be interesting to see just how fast the withdrawal queue kind of returns back to what could be like a normal level going forward and what that time actually looks like to withdraw. Is it a couple of days or is it two weeks? I think that actually does impact the pricing. For LSDs.
01:00:13.810 - 01:00:39.290, Speaker C: One additional point, I did see some, and this was last night, so the data may have changed, but it looked like almost 70% of the assets that were in the withdrawal queue were coming from Kraken specifically, which, if you remember, they are required to send back all of that ETH, withdraw all that ETH. So even the numbers that we're seeing could be overinflated by specific actors in situations like that.
01:00:39.440 - 01:00:40.140, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:42.430 - 01:01:42.370, Speaker B: I generally think that crypto underestimates likelihood of bad things happening, so I sort of tend to come into these sorts of events with a negative bias. But I do think that people generally kind of overstated the concern. The question that I have to you guys is because this was the sort of strong consensus going into this like one or two months ago that we've talked about a lot, is there was going to be this initial dip as people unstaked, and then there was going to go back up. But my question to you guys is how much withdrawal and ETH do you think people would need to see to be satisfied that withdrawals actually work? Do you know what I mean? Like there's some amount of, okay, I actually want to withdraw my stakes so I can pay my taxes or because I haven't had liquidity in a number of years. But also just as likely is could be likely that over the first couple of days you see some amount of ETH successfully able to be withdrawn. The market decides, wow, this has just been derisked. Right? I've seen or I've heard my friends or this fund that I know, and people tweet about it publicly.
01:01:42.370 - 01:01:54.418, Speaker B: They withdrew their ETH. So then actually the deposit queue ends up it ends up netting out sort of positively and there isn't really even that period of dip could happen like that too. I don't know.
01:01:54.504 - 01:02:02.798, Speaker D: Kraken withdrawing a billion dollars, they can do that then. Should have pretty good confidence that it's doable.
01:02:02.974 - 01:02:25.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we should check back on the numbers in a week from now and see where everything nets out from, because I did see at certain points there were large deposits as well as the consistent withdrawals. And at certain points in time before I think Kraken really got into it, there were actually more deposits in than there were withdrawals.
01:02:26.670 - 01:03:27.470, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just as a closing story here, I'd love to get your guys thoughts on this idea of the US falling behind in crypto. So a 16 z kind of put out this report and you actually saw Avico Garg over at Electric Capital kind of raise the alarm bell or ring the fire alarm or whatever, know, what have you, that the US. In terms of developer activity is actually falling way behind. And for a good portion of at least my time in crypto, I've kind of heard these calls that the United States is falling behind in crypto, but I haven't really seen much evidence of that, I would say until recently. There are kind of starting to emerge like real signs that we might actually be in danger of losing this race. And it's not like some overwhelming tsunami of information but anecdotally here and there. I see less funds that are being formed or domiciled in the US.
01:03:27.470 - 01:04:03.650, Speaker B: I see more know, move to be constituted outside of the like more of the interesting projects that are getting funded are based in Asia. It seems like Abu Dhabi and Vara are being very serious about their desire to attract crypto talent. Even Hong Kong seems to be making a real play at crypto, which Tacitly I think we can understand to be China saying at least, hey, this is okay in our sort of regulatory sandbox. Know, I think it's definitely still too early to call, but it really, actually does, for the first time, at least since I've been in Crypto, seems like it's genuinely shifting outside of the Les.
01:04:03.730 - 01:04:20.958, Speaker A: Rob Leschner came on Empire, and one of the things that he mentioned, because he does a lot of investing out of robot ventures, is know, advise founders not to be in the United States anymore. He's like, yeah, it's just not worth it. And he's like, look, if I started compound all over again I wouldn't do it from the States again.
01:04:21.124 - 01:04:25.066, Speaker C: It's part of our evaluation criteria whenever we look at an investment.
01:04:25.258 - 01:04:26.000, Speaker B: Wow.
01:04:27.250 - 01:04:28.286, Speaker A: Say more about Michael.
01:04:28.318 - 01:04:31.538, Speaker B: So like you'll get like a ding if they're based in the US.
01:04:31.704 - 01:04:32.898, Speaker C: It's going to be more difficult.
01:04:32.984 - 01:04:33.426, Speaker B: Yes.
01:04:33.528 - 01:05:34.502, Speaker C: So you have to understand what that implies. You're going to be operating with one, if not both hands tied behind your back. And regulation by enforcement is sort of like you don't want to say anything because if you're too loud you might get clipped. So there is an element of, I would say simultaneously and this is what the presentation goes through is there are actually positive regulatory perspectives that are happening in Singapore, Hong Kong or Western Europe. Like there are places to go where you can have this company operate in the way that you want it to that are not out of left field countries that you'd have to move to and it would be a crazy place to live. These are very well established and even some with major tech centers. So that's largely where a lot of the decentralized protocols that we look at for investment are coming from just because they recognize the same things that we do.
01:05:34.636 - 01:05:50.410, Speaker D: Now Michael, do you notice that most of these teams you talk to are expats that have left the States or less friendly regimes or for the most part folks from these regions?
01:05:50.930 - 01:06:28.374, Speaker C: I would say not necessarily from those regions in particular but probably from somewhere that then moved to that region to be there. I would also say there's a huge difference between the breakdown of the team versus the founding team? Where are you getting engineering or design or product resources? Where are they from originally versus the founding team? That is a difference as well. But yeah, usually it's the founders. Where are you based is a question. Or are you willing to be based elsewhere? Is a question.
01:06:28.492 - 01:06:52.720, Speaker D: It's interesting. I've always gotten the sense that Solana ecosystem was very Silicon Valley kind of based. And so I think ethereum. We rarely meet teams that are located really? The legal entity is never headquartered in the United States. But I'll be curious to know some of these Web 2.5 teams if they're feeling the heat, too.
01:06:54.210 - 01:07:17.560, Speaker C: Without clarity and I'm not a lawyer, nor do I pretend to be one, but without clarity, it's not worth it. And we've already started to see some of these enforcement actions, specifically going after US. Persons. It doesn't matter whether or not the company came in or what have you. If you're living and working in the US. They can find nexus there.
01:07:20.250 - 01:07:42.480, Speaker B: Yeah, well, maybe. It's definitely not over yet, but if there are any regulators or policymakers that are listening to this, I think I don't want to speak for everyone on this call, but I can say we all want this to be a US. Led industry. I would love it if crypto flourished in the US. But definitely it's not destiny, right? That it has to be based out of here.
01:07:43.090 - 01:08:06.646, Speaker C: Yeah. And last thing I'd say is we do think that we will get to clarity at some point in the next year or two. There's a lot of push in DC. To at least have some understanding of what the regulatory situation will look. You know, this is what Brian Armstrong talks about all the time. Give us a playbook, and we'll be able to operate and run with that. So don't get me wrong.
01:08:06.646 - 01:08:13.850, Speaker C: We're not hopeful that this continues. I think we just need to know where the black and white lines are and stop living in this point of gray.
01:08:15.310 - 01:08:32.158, Speaker B: Yeah. Agreed. All right, fellas, on that slightly somber note, we can maybe end it, but this was a good one. And I was in Texas for this last week, and I got a special T shirt from Michael. I can promise that he's going to.
01:08:32.164 - 01:08:33.460, Speaker D: Wear it next time.
01:08:35.750 - 01:08:39.906, Speaker C: Which one is the question of whether or not I'll wear I'll tell you.
01:08:39.928 - 01:08:58.406, Speaker B: I'll read you out. The less controversial one, because there were a couple that would not be Adam approved. Let's put it like that. But it says, Noah was a conspiracy theorist. Then it rained. I actually think that's a pretty funny one.
01:08:58.588 - 01:08:59.922, Speaker C: That one might be a better Vance.
01:08:59.986 - 01:09:10.250, Speaker B: T shirt, but yeah, right. Honestly, Vance, with that and the tinfoil hat, I think that'd be a real winner. That could be a nice little get up. 100% belt.
