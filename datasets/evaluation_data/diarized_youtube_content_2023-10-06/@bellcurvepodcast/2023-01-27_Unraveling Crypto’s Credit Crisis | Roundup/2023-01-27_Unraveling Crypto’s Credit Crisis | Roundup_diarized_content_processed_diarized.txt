00:00:00.090 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co hosts today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.490 - 00:00:42.918, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. Today you've got me and Vance, which I think most people would agree was strongest two of the show anyway. Yeah, exactly. Not getting dragged down by those other two that always are just freeloading, just riding on our coattails.
00:00:43.014 - 00:00:47.562, Speaker C: Feels nice to have two big squares on the screen versus four exactly. States work.
00:00:47.616 - 00:01:15.442, Speaker B: It's so nice. Maybe we should reevaluate, honestly, this whole rest of the dynamic here. All right, let's get into it today. I love where we want to start here talking about credit, so I'm going to actually just turn it over to you. People who are following along on video can get this helpful visual here, just looking at Genesis Active Loans, quarter over quarter, but could you just kind of tee it up? Like, why do you want to start this conversation talking about credit and what are we looking at here?
00:01:15.496 - 00:02:10.882, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think a lot of the stuff that I've been doing is taking stock of 2021, 2020, seeing where things made sense in retrospect, seeing where there was a lot of credit created, seeing where firms like Three Arrows took that credit and used it. And I think it helps you understand both the past, obviously, but also more likely the future and where things are going to go, because some of these things will be in the market cycle next time, a lot of them won't. And it'll just have a different type of impact on the market as we know it. And so I think there's kind of three steps to this. The first is how much credit was there in the aggregate. The second is who did it go to? And then the third is what was it used for? And we don't have all of the answers on this stuff. A lot of it is unknowable.
00:02:10.882 - 00:02:49.940, Speaker C: These are private companies, but you can kind of start to piece together a little bit of what went to who and what was it used for, and just starting the discussion. This is free form, but this is a good place to start. So on the screen right now, you have Genesis Active Loans by quarter and Q Four 2021. They had about twelve and a half billion outstanding. And that was not the high water market actually went a little bit higher to about 14 billion in Q one of 2022. And so let's start with this. Call it $14 billion number of credit.
00:02:49.940 - 00:03:29.466, Speaker C: And if you look at this chart, which is a super fascinating research piece put out by ADESA Cap on Twitter. I have no idea who they are, but this is good research. It's interesting. There's 14 billion of credit. More than half of that looked like it was USD, but about half of it was Bitcoin and ETH. And so let's start with that 14 billion number. There was a report that the Wall Street Journal released this month that said that at the height of the amount of credit that was created, six and a half billion of the Genesis active loans were to Alameda.
00:03:29.466 - 00:03:52.354, Speaker C: And we'll get back to who was using this, but let's start with this $14 billion number. $14 billion from Celsius BlockFi's Q two. 2022 Transparency Report. They had 1.3 billion in loans, roughly double that. So that we are at the peak of the credit creation in 2021 to take us back there. So call it like two, two and a half plus 14.
00:03:52.354 - 00:04:15.898, Speaker C: So we're at 17 and a half of total credit created Voyager in their bankruptcy filing, 200 million to Alameda, 700 million to three Arrows, and 100 million to 200 million to others. So that's another billion. So we're now at 18 and a half billion. Let's call the babble. Finance holdlenot blockchain.com. Bucket One. Let's say that was another billion.
00:04:15.898 - 00:04:44.854, Speaker C: So we have 19 and a half billion of credit. And then you have the FTX situation where they were selling user assets to pump their own coins. Call that credit as well. And I think that's around three to 4 billion. The point of this is that you get to 20 to 22 billion of aggregate credit that was created in the market during 2000 and 22,021. The credit market is completely dead today. You literally cannot borrow dollars from anyone except for maybe Maple, but they're still kind of rebuilding and doing their thing.
00:04:44.854 - 00:04:50.950, Speaker C: But that's a lot of credit. And so just like, let's stop there. Mike, any questions or anything like that?
00:04:51.020 - 00:05:51.770, Speaker B: Yeah, well, honestly, one of the things that I don't know if you're kind of planning on getting into this, but one of the things that also stands out to me, looking at this chart here, is this enormous green area, which is USD like dollar based lending. And it seems like, based on what I know purely about the Genesis situation, seems like that's actually where they got into an enormous amount of their trouble, sort of as well. There was a really great thread that sort of came out about this, which was, if you look at US dollar credit creation, how it works in the rest of the world, it's like that happens at the level of commercial banks. And commercial banks have all these advantages, right? First of all, they have enormous balance sheets. They have that window with the Fed right there's, like FDIC Insurance, but on top of that, even their prime brokerage desks and stuff like that. There are all these tools and systems and processes and communication channels that have been built up over the years. And honestly, just watching, I'll see if I can find the Tweet thread and link it, which gets into more detail.
00:05:51.770 - 00:06:13.780, Speaker B: But just watching when you look at this big green part of the chart and you saw Genesis trying to enter into this business, my thought is just it was like, wow, they're really taking a knife to a gunfight. And they were just pretty ill equipped at trying to participate in the business. This is obviously where a lot of their revenue is being generated. So that's a huge takeaway for me. Looking at this.
00:06:14.470 - 00:06:30.502, Speaker C: The growth of the chart is crazy too, right? Crazy. You can see how this went from something that was manageable a small cottage industry of micro loans to one book alone, 14 billion and 15 billion in credit from just Genesis. That's pretty wild.
00:06:30.646 - 00:06:44.560, Speaker B: Yeah. So where did this end up getting used? How much can we piece together about because I sort of have my own little theory about this, but where have you been able to piece together? Where was all this credit kind of.
00:06:46.610 - 00:07:27.146, Speaker C: And just to back up, I do think there's an intermediate question here, which is what was being lent out as credit? About half of it was US dollars, but the other half was Bitcoin and ETH. And if you're a market maker and you get Bitcoin and ETH, the first thing you do is sell it, put on a hedge if you have to get it back, but you need US dollars dollars to do your work. You can do kind of crypto collateral on different types of levels, but that's pretty hard for market makers. So that's one other thing to keep in mind. So the numbers to remember, 20 to probably 22 or 25 billion of credit was created in 2021 through all of the venues. And where did it go? Alameda. So let's just put that one out there.
00:07:27.146 - 00:08:13.846, Speaker C: There was a Wall Street Journal report that said there were six and a half billion outstanding loans that were given to Alameda just from Genesis at a single point in time. And so that's greater than 50% of their loan book at any given point. And so you can kind of imagine Genesis giving them a few billion of USD, a couple of billion of Bitcoin, a couple of billion of ETH. They sell the Bitcoin and ETH, they go off and market make do whatever they need to do. And that loan was eventually called. So Alameda has six and a half billion from Genesis. They have at least another 200 million from Alameda, and they probably have another billion or 2 billion or so just from other sources and uses most specifically the FTX collateral that was stolen and probably sold and then used to buy the other assets.
00:08:13.846 - 00:08:30.782, Speaker C: So I'm calling it at least 10 billion of credit was given to Alameda. And you think about that. That's a big number. And where did it go? Probably a few different places. And we'll get into that. I have an answer there. So Alameda, there's 20 billion, 25 billion total credit.
00:08:30.782 - 00:09:00.594, Speaker C: Alameda gets about half three Arrows. Let's talk about that one. The week that they got called, the data that was put out and they got margin called and they got blown up because they couldn't meet their credit obligations. They had 3 billion in loans from Genesis. They had 700 million from Voyager, 700 million from Blockfly, and probably another few hundred million from Blockchain.com. They probably had 5 billion in credit. And so if you think back during 2021, you had Alimated with 10 billion.
00:09:00.594 - 00:09:31.790, Speaker C: You had Three Arrows as like a slightly smaller, more scrappier competitor, but they had probably 5 billion between those two. You're talking about 66% to 75% of the entire credit market was just from them. And you look at Genesis's statements that they put out, alameda was their biggest counterparty, was about 33% of their loan book. 3 Hours was probably 20%. But the figures match. You're talking about roughly 15 billion of credit between those two. And so the question that I get to is like, where did the other credit go to? There's 2020, 5 billion.
00:09:31.790 - 00:09:50.422, Speaker C: 15 billion is 3 hours in Alameda. Directional hedge funds, probably pretty small mining, that's probably another one. And then maybe the GBTC trade, that would be the third place. But really, you're talking about the entire market encapsulated 75% between two people. And that's just wild to look back on.
00:09:50.476 - 00:10:24.082, Speaker B: 100%. And it's funny because Three Arrows has now blown up. I mean, it feels like a lifetime ago that those guys blew up, but there are these commonalities in between. First of all, just to reiterate what we've talked about on the show a million times, kyle's and Sue's explanation for how it's not their fault still just gets to me. At my core, they're like, no one could their big thing was, oh well, we didn't know that people would follow us into this trade despite publishing that they had like $1.5 billion of outstanding GBTC in going to a trade. So there was that.
00:10:24.082 - 00:11:20.358, Speaker B: But a lot of these guys ended up getting taken down by a pretty similar mistake. And honestly, even though so a huge part of the market was like these two entities that you're pointing out, but honestly, Three Arrows, capital DCG, and Barry Alameda all kind of did the same thing. They had a horrendous duration mismatch, whereas they had a source of financing that was supposed to be geared towards longer term, less volatile risk taking. And they used that to lever up and go super long shitcoins, which is good when shitcoins are going up, but then when the market turns and now like, is I'm sure this is what's being talked about behind closed doors at DCGs, like, how do you get liquidity on that? And that's like what happened with Three Arrows. It's what happened with I mean, Alameda was kind of a whole different thing, but kind of honestly, same thing with Alameda. And then DCG is, I think, facing that same exact problem, right?
00:11:20.444 - 00:11:58.020, Speaker C: And they had kind of the same symptoms and ultimate diagnosis of just being dead. But how they got there was two different ways. Like if you look at how they got the leverage, alameda printed the FTT token and this is all public information. They used it to collateralize the you know, if you think about that relationship where Ft is really the whole thing that's probably up the empire, barry says, I want the loan back. You can't really say anything else. What's the alternative? They just sell FTT into the market and collapse everything. And so it was not surprising in retrospect to see that that loan actually got paid off in the summer, whereas they probably just extended the duration on everything else.
00:11:58.020 - 00:12:53.026, Speaker C: And then if you think about Three Arrows, how they probably got the leverage was different, right? It was the GPTC trade, which is kind of the self encapsulated trade within Genesis, where Three Arrows comes up. They buy GPTC, they pledges collateral, they get more loans, they buy more GPTC, they pledge collateral, and so on and so forth. And in that scenario, it's kind of the opposite, where Barry now has the token that is underpinning his empire GPTC. And if that really gets panic know, there's a different scenario. And so a lot of the Three Arrows claims know, Barry just liquidated us to steal our, you know, who knows if that's right or wrong, but you can kind of generally assume that Barry really wanted to protect that GBT from being sold on the open market, because that would really hurt a lot of his business. So it's kind of different paths. But it's just interesting to think about the power dynamics of the relationships between the lenders and the borrowers and how.
00:12:53.048 - 00:13:01.918, Speaker B: They each got there 100%. Although I do think, to be fair to Barry, there's much more like GBTC is more legitimate as an asset than FTT.
00:13:02.094 - 00:13:45.426, Speaker C: Yeah, more to hang on there. You also created it, so there's some rules around what you can do with it, but it's just interesting nonetheless. And so the last part of kind of like this analysis that I wanted to do mostly for myself, just understand what happened is how did these people use the collateral? So these are just like round numbers that I'm guessing at. But there's 2020 5 billion of credit that no longer exists in the crypto ecosystem that used to Alameda's VC portfolio. That's 5 billion right there. That's what they use that for. They probably use another two to 3 billion on FTX and FTX exchange operations, marketing, personal loans, things like that.
00:13:45.426 - 00:14:37.806, Speaker C: Those figures roughly match. There was likely about 2 billion spent supporting Samcoins, in my opinion, two to 3 billion, that's a lot of money, especially if you're levering perps up with it and you're really charging against people in a no liquidation context. And so that's another one, and that's kind of like the Alameda bucket, and that adds up to 10 billion. But it reminds me of this old saying, how did you lose all your money? It's like, well, I spent the first 3rd on know, women and fast horses, and the rest I just squandered. They did squander a good portion of it just on these stupid marketing things and all like that. But the rest of it was used in ill advised VC bets trying to prop up ecosystem coins. The thing I want to drive home on how Alameda used the funds is that that was very self contained within the solana and the Solana ecosystem and the FTX ecosystem.
00:14:37.806 - 00:14:47.058, Speaker C: You didn't really see Alameda going long ETH or bitcoin, or like they were spending money to make money within their own ecosystem.
00:14:47.234 - 00:15:13.078, Speaker B: So is the long term implication for that then basically mechanically then, in the market, there was basically a lot of sell pressure, sort of artificial sell pressure coming from the Solana FTX part of the ecosystem on kind of the core assets of bitcoin and ETH. Sort of artificially propping and a lot of artificial buy pressure on kind of the Samcoin ecosystem. Is that the takeaway? And you would expect that to kind of reverse moving into this new regime? Or what's your sort of takeaway?
00:15:13.114 - 00:16:03.280, Speaker C: From the analysis, I would say that the two to 4 billion spent on Sam coins is probably something that you don't really see again. I also think the 5 billion that they spent on just like VC style bets and propping up ecosystem token or doing all the venture rounds for all the ecosystem tokens, you probably don't see that ever again. The VC presence of setting the floor on salana projects was a phenomenon that just blew my mind, where everything that was raising private money on Solana was like two or three x more expensive than ETH. And you probably don't see that again. But I think the takeaway is there's going to be just less of a bid on Sam coins. And that playbook of having this massive ecosystem fund really won't work again. Just the credit won't be there.
00:16:03.280 - 00:16:32.140, Speaker C: So that is what FTX did. And they were big solana backers, but that was really their game. You look at three arrows, it's mostly the same story, but it's a little bit different. Sue still has the red triangle, so he's along AVAX. He did all those deals with Luna. I think he was like a billion plus of deals with Luna. And so if you think they have 5 billion, maybe that's like one and a half, 2 billion of money that they spent there.
00:16:32.140 - 00:17:07.362, Speaker C: They did near, they did Mina, they did the GBTC trade. The things they didn't do were the majors. Honestly, they didn't put net buy pressure onto Bitcoin or ETH. It was all used within these relatively self contained ecosystems. And so I think the long and the short of it is ethereum really didn't get much or many of these flows. And I think that will be different next time going forward. But mostly, and not to harp on this over and over, you can kind of tie the source of funds to how they were used.
00:17:07.362 - 00:17:17.794, Speaker C: And I can just see these all l one ecosystems really taking a hit as a result. Like, you're going to need large ecosystem funds to support them, and I just don't know if they're there anymore.
00:17:17.922 - 00:18:08.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to actually get back to the point of ecosystem funds. There was an ecosystem fund that was announced this week. I'm not sure if you saw it, and I think it's actually very confusing how these things are phrased because it's not like $160,000,000 was raised for this ecosystem fund. So actually, I would be great if you could explain mechanically how this stuff works. But I have a question before we get there, which is how would you contend? Because the big story this week, right, and I know you were on the bankless pod this week and they were asking you about this, but is like this Aptos sort of run here. So if we're looking at this in terms of, like, okay, there's sort of this artificial buy pressure that was propping up and injecting capital into these sort of contained l one ecosystems and ETH and Bitcoin flows were suffering as a result. That dynamic should so what you might expect to see in the reverse dynamic is like Bitcoin and ETH outperforming.
00:18:08.210 - 00:18:18.762, Speaker B: But actually the things that have performed the best right are some of these alt one, like Aptos is like, running away and now has a valuation that's tied with zoom. So how does that square basically with this?
00:18:18.816 - 00:19:10.070, Speaker C: I mean, you can generally say that it doesn't make sense. It's worth double coinbase at this point, I think. Yeah, doesn't make a ton of sense when you think about it in the right context. But the long term of how a bull cycle manifests over several years versus the short term of how a token launches gets shorted by the wrong people, and then people long it and run over them, forcing them to buy back, those are two different things. And so my idea of how this Aptos run has come about is like, mostly people are offside shorting it. People are longing into it, trying to take out their stops and force them to buy back higher. And it makes sense within the context of if you are a fund that did the Aptos early rounds and you're now sitting on a billion of unrealized paper gains, you're going to try to short the perp.
00:19:10.070 - 00:19:34.834, Speaker C: The only question is, do you have enough collateral to withstand people longing against you? And I think the answer that we just learned is probably not. But things are expensive. Optimism is worth coinbase and that's in our portfolio. So glass houses don't throw stones. I ultimately think in the fullness of time you're going to see the flows dictate the price. And I don't think we're at a point where you can make that conclusion yet.
00:19:34.872 - 00:20:28.094, Speaker B: I want to move on to just actually, because this was a subject of debate internally at Blockbust this week, actually, when this news came out. But there was $160,000,000 ecosystem fund that is in the Injective ecosystem or $150,000,000. So pantera jump Crypto back $150,000,000 injective Ecosystem Fund. And there was a period of time actually to your point before where it was like every week there was a new $150,000,000, $300 million ecosystem fund for these different l one sort of ecosystems. And it's worded a little bit confusingly because it's not like there's money. It's not like Jump and Pantera just deployed a fresh $25 million check into this fund that Injective is going to use. So each ecosystem fund is frankly a little bit different in the structure and they're kind of opaque.
00:20:28.094 - 00:20:36.422, Speaker B: But can you talk a little bit about ecosystem funds? Like when you hear that word, what do you think about these things? Like how do they typically work, actually?
00:20:36.556 - 00:21:21.362, Speaker C: So the fine print on most ecosystem funds is that to your point, it's not US dollars sitting in a bank account, or at least I wouldn't assume that. The vast majority of ones that I've seen are more than half the native token of the ecosystem, plus some money from outside investors and some sort of handshake agreement that they're going to get the first look at any project that comes out of it. And it can be used for venture funding, it can be used for liquidity mining in the case of AVAX. But I think the common thread is that they're mostly tokens. This isn't like real us. I remember when avalanche had like the billion dollar, I forget what it was called fund, like blizzard or something. They had the cool snowboarder graphic.
00:21:21.506 - 00:21:23.058, Speaker B: Actually it was a pretty dope graphic.
00:21:23.154 - 00:21:53.358, Speaker C: It was a cool graphic, but I haven't seen these things work very well over the long term. There's something about the nepotistic. Like we are the chain, we are also the fund. We are going to incubate the projects where if it's too self encapsulated, nothing ever really breaks out into the mainstream. It just becomes this echo chamber. So we'll see how it does. But I think generally I'm just happy that we're putting points on the board with new funds, new capital, new ways for entrepreneurs to do what they're doing.
00:21:53.358 - 00:21:54.602, Speaker C: What's up, Yana?
00:21:54.746 - 00:21:55.774, Speaker A: What's happening?
00:21:55.972 - 00:21:58.042, Speaker B: Yana, thank you for gracing us with your presence.
00:21:58.106 - 00:21:59.042, Speaker C: Yeah, really nice.
00:21:59.176 - 00:22:04.766, Speaker A: I wasn't going to join until I saw that Vance got a new headshot and he's looking pretty dapper in it. So I figured I'd figured I'd join.
00:22:04.798 - 00:22:09.526, Speaker C: You guys, my comms guy sent that to you. We've been going back and forth on.
00:22:09.548 - 00:22:18.102, Speaker A: Whether I look pretty sharp. You and Michael have like, similar look. I know those were taken on the same day, same photographer. I've been there, man. I've been there. It's okay.
00:22:18.156 - 00:22:19.340, Speaker B: We did that too.
00:22:19.790 - 00:22:26.554, Speaker C: The first headshots that Michael and I ever did, we went to this place in Oakland, this fake brick office.
00:22:26.752 - 00:22:29.370, Speaker A: I remember that. It was in the Forbes article.
00:22:31.390 - 00:22:50.820, Speaker C: And the guy was like, you two are so awkward that do you want a drink or do you want me to start playing music? And it was like an absolute gonk show of a two hour session. At one point, I was standing on a table, really? So I could be the same height as Michael. And he did not like that.
00:22:53.030 - 00:22:54.020, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:22:55.830 - 00:22:59.606, Speaker C: But we were just talking about ecosystem funds and all that good stuff.
00:22:59.708 - 00:23:03.446, Speaker A: Oh, Mike loves ecosystem know, it was.
00:23:03.468 - 00:23:15.190, Speaker B: A subject of intense internal debate at Blockworks about we decided not to cover this particular fund for it's. Just they can be misleading sometimes in the way that they're announced.
00:23:15.270 - 00:23:19.450, Speaker C: Honestly, you want to ask the specific questions of like, what's it comprised of.
00:23:19.520 - 00:23:23.178, Speaker B: And they were unwilling to answer that specific question, so we ended up not covering.
00:23:23.194 - 00:23:25.774, Speaker A: What does that mean, Vance? What would it be comprised? What are you looking for?
00:23:25.812 - 00:23:36.958, Speaker C: There like mostly tokens, like $150,000,000 fund based on the private valuation of X Protocol marked at its highest and last round.
00:23:37.054 - 00:23:45.602, Speaker A: Oh, so you could have a 200 million dollar APDoS ecosystem fund based on Aptos at $15 right now, and it's all Aptos token. I see what you're saying.
00:23:45.656 - 00:23:46.114, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:46.232 - 00:23:52.086, Speaker C: The key is to announce your ecosystem fund when your market cap is the largest. So people think you're big and scary, right?
00:23:52.188 - 00:24:16.000, Speaker B: And then the other question is, where are those specific tokens coming from? And oftentimes the investors that are participating in the ecosystem fund, it's like, hey, there were all these investors and they were going to have their unlocks at one period of time. So sometimes those unlocks, instead of just unlocking into the wild, are put into the ecosystem fund as well, which is another little way sometimes those things end up happening.
00:24:16.450 - 00:24:28.114, Speaker C: Fancy footwork. Yeah, good for them for going there. Even if all tokens, you're willing to put something up and fund people, you're cool with me.
00:24:28.232 - 00:25:00.266, Speaker B: I agree with that. I agree. Let's talk a little bit about I don't know if you guys saw, just speaking of unlocks, dYdX actually had a pretty interesting move. So they announced that they were doing the opposite of an unlock, actually. They had, they had a big unlock that was scheduled for January and they pushed it back. There's $282,000,000 worth of token unlocks that they pushed into the future. So it's going to start in December 1, 2023 now, so basically at the end of the year.
00:25:00.266 - 00:25:57.278, Speaker B: And then there's an unlock schedule, which basically like 30% of the unlocks happen on December 1, 2023, then 40% in equal monthly installments first day of each month, January to June, then another 20% from June till the end of the year, and then 10% from July 1, 2025 to June 1 2026. So basically they kicked these unlocks way down into the future and dYdX kind of exploded higher. It was up like 20% on the first day that this was announced, and it's since been doing pretty well. Without trying to put words, our analysts on our research team are pretty excited about dYdX overall. Like, on chain perps are a pretty interesting use case, especially right now. There are just so few DApps that people are actually using. You can always count on the 24 hours casino to attract some amount of users, and decentralized perps are a pretty good way to do it.
00:25:57.278 - 00:26:27.414, Speaker B: Even if you just look at cumulative volume of dYdX versus which has been around for like, five years, I think Antonio has been building that versus GNS and GMX or Gains Network and GMX, I think dYdX has done like, $800 billion cumulative in terms of volume and combined gains, and GMX have done just a fraction of that. So I don't know if you guys saw this move to delay the unlocks or if you had any thoughts on it.
00:26:27.452 - 00:27:00.100, Speaker A: I don't have thoughts about the delaying the unlock. Maybe Vance does, but I get why people are so excited about dYdX. I don't think it's about the unlock as much as it is about, like they're one of the best app tokens right now. They did 350,000,000 in revenue last year, and they're about to turn on revenue. The revenue return is about to be implemented this year. Not guaranteed, but from what I've heard, and they launch V Four coming soon, I don't know. And they have some pretty big catalysts coming this year, like returning the revenue, launching V Four.
00:27:00.100 - 00:27:20.650, Speaker A: I think it's an easy buy for an institution who's looking at DFI to be like, all right, they have revenue. They're going to do like, dividends back. They've got a massive tam, low float, only one unlock this year in I think it's going to be February now. So I see why people are so excited.
00:27:20.990 - 00:27:47.394, Speaker C: I think you're going to see these teams slowly put things together. We're turning on the revenue, we're launching the app chain. Okay. Crypto and speculation and DeFi are like the most endogenous use cases to crypto. We don't need anything else to happen for those things to be popular. And I think you're going to see teams put it together. And it starts with, what is the token doing and dYdX's token has always been a sideshow, but they're going to put together the pieces to make it work.
00:27:47.394 - 00:27:59.222, Speaker C: They're going to direct revenue to the token. There's not a lot of these, but the signs of them putting it together is. Really encouraging, and we like it.
00:27:59.276 - 00:28:07.142, Speaker B: Vance, I've got a question for you as a VC. When these protocols talk about returning revenue to token holders, what are your thoughts about that?
00:28:07.276 - 00:28:53.702, Speaker C: Don't until the last second, most technology companies don't return any revenue, any dividends ever, let alone like in the first three years. And that's because you're trying to capture this massive market that you believe could generate substantially more revenue if you internalize it and use it wisely in the beginning. And that's what I want all of our protocols to do. Who cares about them giving people one, two, 3% in the bear market? They can go buy T bills if they want that. I would just say don't return money until you have, like, a massive scaled protocol that's fully decentralized and frankly, because of securities regulations, a finished product. I'm not a huge bull on governance at all. I'm a bull on no governance and just like a finished product.
00:28:53.702 - 00:29:12.640, Speaker C: And that's what I ultimately want to see from these teams, something that is beyond the reach of any sort of reproach in terms of securities, but also able to generate massive revenue and give it back. Token holders at scale. I'm just simply not interested in a protocol that's worth a billion dollars that's returning $10 million a year. Token holders just like, not interesting.
00:29:14.850 - 00:29:18.990, Speaker B: I'm 100% with you on that. Hard agree on that.
00:29:19.140 - 00:29:32.910, Speaker C: The peanut gallery will always want the fees even when they're faced with we will shut the product down if we can't get revenue into the treasury. Like, they'd rather have 100% of zero. I'd rather have a much smaller percent of something much larger.
00:29:32.990 - 00:30:08.922, Speaker B: Next story. Kind of wanted to get your take on Was. I know, Yano, you were talking about this a little bit earlier today, but this is Circles announcement. So Circles, they're launching Circles cross chain transfer protocol. So the background is they released this week developer documentation for CCTP as it's being called over the it was this weekend. I guess it aims to be a permissionless on chain utility that can burn USDC on a source chain and then Mint native USDC on a destination chain. Circle will serve as the ultimate source of truth, serving as the Minter burner price Oracle for USDC.
00:30:08.922 - 00:30:50.674, Speaker B: They're not calling it a bridge. And I guess there is a difference between most bridges, which are like, you lock and then mint, and this would be burn and mint. And the key difference here is that it's a one asset bridge where Circle happens to be the issuer of the native asset. So it's pretty interesting. I think there's definitely desire in these different ecosystems for there to be USDC natively. And I know it's been a pain in the ass for Circle to launch on Ethereum and then have to figure out if you want USDC on Solana or wherever else or in Cosmos or wherever else. So it seems like it is a pretty big deal, but I'm curious to get your guys thoughts.
00:30:50.742 - 00:31:26.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say bullish circle. Bullish DeFi. Brings liquidity, helps assets move across DeFi, much smoother bearish for other bridges. I don't know who uses a bridge when you can just burn USDC on chain A and then mint USDC on chain B, except if you're like a decentralization maxi or if circle is forced to KYC. Is forced to KYC it so, like, I think it's a I think it's smart that they're calling it a utility, right? Like, bridges had like 2 billion of hacks last year. So obviously people think about bridges now. They're really scared of them.
00:31:26.680 - 00:31:36.406, Speaker A: But bridges, like, the UX experience of bridges sucked. It was like you had like, axilar USDC and then you had like, wormhole USDC. It was like a total nightmare.
00:31:36.438 - 00:31:39.850, Speaker C: Dealing with ten different types of USDC on SLANA and all that.
00:31:40.000 - 00:31:57.410, Speaker A: It's just a nightmare. I don't know. I think it's a great product. I really tip my capit circle here. The counterargument is that they are the minter, the issuer, the source of truth, and that's kind of like anti DeFi, I'd say. But I think it's a great product development.
00:31:57.990 - 00:32:45.642, Speaker C: I think we're going to see people use bridges less in the future. I think what we're going to see, instead of like the plain vanilla transferring USDC from one chain to the next chain, okay, I'm now on this next chain. Now I'm going to go do this thing on this next chain, and then I'm going to go withdraw it to the original chain so I can go cash it out. I think what you're going to see is these interoperability protocols that are not just asset specific, but they're more about moving data and relaying transactions. Where you're on ETH, you need to bridge to optimism, buy an NFT and then figure out how to sell it and bridge it back. You're going to be able to do that in one, two transactions. And I think this will be part of a larger interoperability stack that really makes the concept of switching from one chain to another just not make a lot of sense to users.
00:32:45.642 - 00:33:24.086, Speaker C: That's where I roughly see this going. There's always this like, oh, my God, this is the new thing, and this is going to be the new way that we do it all the time, forever and for all time. But it's usually like, okay, this is like a stepping stone towards something that's a little bit more seamless from a user experience. And I think that's ultimately where we're going. But we haven't seen the death of other bridges. I think we've seen more of a rearrangement in terms of what they're going to do and what they're going to be useful for. And the plain vanilla bridges like things like Hop, I think those are going to be challenged just because we've looked at 70, 80% of the monthly volume of transferred assets is either USDC or east, where there's a native ETH bridge.
00:33:24.198 - 00:34:00.402, Speaker B: That's what I think is kind of smart about this. It's just like if you just look at instead of trying to be a bridge that you can send, if the scope of what you're trying to achieve there is be able to transfer any asset across to any other from one l one to another, is very tactically complex. Whereas if like 70% of the volume is going to this one asset and you can just win that one asset, it kind of reminds me of the compound strategy of just trying to instead of being able to deposit any type of collateral, people just want to get leverage on their dollars. People just want to borrow and lend in dollars. So just get maximum capital efficiency, get the best rates for USDC.
00:34:00.466 - 00:34:21.342, Speaker C: Tell you what, we are scared shitless of using bridges, and we will only use ones that we've done on audits on. I'm glad to see something safer come to market, because I think we probably lost a few billion dollars of customer assets in bridges last year, none of which we invested in. By we, I mean the proverbial we of the Know. Not not a great look either way.
00:34:21.396 - 00:35:30.050, Speaker B: So I don't know if you guys saw Antonio, the founder of Know, like very quickly to Jeremy lair when he tweeted this out, but he said dYdX would be they would use this basically instantly, starting day one when they make their transfer from StarkNet to their own protocol, their own chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. And there was an announcement of a general asset issuance chain, which I think is called Noble now is the name, and Circle is going to leverage that basically to mint USDC, which then with IBC through the Cosmos hub, you can basically have Cosmos native USDC. And that's kind of interesting because for Cosmos applications, there's no native token. Like there is an ETH. Like you have to use ETH to mint or to burn, like gas fees and stuff. And if you want in a Cosmos chain, you could actually use right, to pay for things. Or if you're dYdX and you want to reward your user, they have like a whole bunch of trading rewards, right? That's a huge part of their token allocation.
00:35:30.050 - 00:35:38.310, Speaker B: You could actually pay your users in USDC instead. So it'll be interesting, honestly, to see what ends up getting used there.
00:35:38.380 - 00:35:40.950, Speaker C: When are we going to stop calling it the Cosmos ecosystem?
00:35:41.110 - 00:35:42.140, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:35:42.750 - 00:35:44.246, Speaker C: The Kanto ecosystem?
00:35:44.358 - 00:35:45.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I've asked.
00:35:45.312 - 00:35:45.866, Speaker A: I don't really know.
00:35:45.888 - 00:35:47.754, Speaker B: I haven't looked into what Kanto is at all.
00:35:47.792 - 00:36:16.066, Speaker A: Our analysts literally bridged assets over into Kanto before some of the devs at Kanto bridged their assets over, they were literally look at the chain. They were the first dollars. I was like, guys, I remember over the summer them telling me about Kanto. And they're like, yeah, you definitely shouldn't do it. None of us are going to get our money back. Once you bridge over, there's no way to even get it out right now.
00:36:16.168 - 00:36:19.682, Speaker C: I was like, honestly, that's how you make it. That's how you make it.
00:36:19.736 - 00:36:22.262, Speaker A: I'm not willing to take those risks at this age.
00:36:22.316 - 00:36:29.402, Speaker C: I mean, I like your analysts a lot. There's always, like, three of them. Whenever I'm on a call with them, it's like they roll in packs. Exactly how I did it.
00:36:29.456 - 00:36:38.298, Speaker A: So vance we just had our offsite we just had our offsite in Savannah. And they move together.
00:36:38.384 - 00:36:40.986, Speaker C: Like, they move no, they roll know.
00:36:41.008 - 00:36:54.874, Speaker A: You might have, like, a tape. There are different presentations given at the company, and we go to a bar, we go to a restaurant. Different teams sit together. You have, like, a salesperson sitting with a marketer sitting with a developer or something. The analyst. You just look at a table.
00:36:54.922 - 00:37:00.980, Speaker C: It's just like, analysts. Nobody wants to sit with that energy either, because you know what I'm talking about.
00:37:01.350 - 00:37:02.078, Speaker A: Roasted.
00:37:02.174 - 00:37:05.774, Speaker C: What other bridges can we ape to get into weird places?
00:37:05.902 - 00:37:15.766, Speaker A: I love it at that table. There's no, like, how was your weekend? What game are we watching this weekend? It's like degen, only let me take.
00:37:15.788 - 00:37:20.986, Speaker C: You on a different path. You know who Andrew Tate is, right? We all know who Andrew Tate is. Yeah.
00:37:21.088 - 00:37:22.742, Speaker A: Wow. Really? A different path, huh?
00:37:22.806 - 00:37:24.700, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm not sure how these are going to break.
00:37:25.870 - 00:37:36.378, Speaker C: So I looked at it's going to tie I looked at andrew has a thing called Hustlers Academy, which is kind of know, we'll train you to make lots of monies and get, like, a cool colored bugatti.
00:37:36.394 - 00:37:37.386, Speaker A: Mike's a member.
00:37:37.578 - 00:37:40.906, Speaker C: Yeah. Mike's for sure a member. Mike's for sure a member.
00:37:40.938 - 00:37:45.246, Speaker B: I was the first one as, like, our analysts were into contact. I was the first one for top ten.
00:37:45.348 - 00:38:02.978, Speaker C: Yeah. So he's got, like, three careers that he'll train you in. You enter the website, you enter the flow, and it's kind of like you have to pick, like, a guild or what you train in. The first one is Drop Shipping. So somebody orders a fancy soap, you order it from Alibaba, and you send it to their house. And you don't have a front. Like, that's one career.
00:38:02.978 - 00:38:14.198, Speaker C: The next one is I think you can describe it as, like, multi level marketing Ponzi schemes. Okay. And then the third one is like, we'll teach you how to trade. Like, those are the three.
00:38:14.284 - 00:38:15.994, Speaker B: Wait, but I heard but I actually.
00:38:16.032 - 00:38:17.014, Speaker A: Nailed a bunch of calls.
00:38:17.062 - 00:38:41.006, Speaker C: Oh, he nailed a bunch of calls. I heard the bottom on a live stream. He called the top in October 2021. But I thought it was funny. It still is if you're trying to make it andrew Tate's telling you it's one of three options. And the other two are Drop Shipping and Herbal Life. It's pretty compelling to your analysts who are aping these obscure bridges into these obscure chains.
00:38:41.006 - 00:38:42.130, Speaker C: I can see why.
00:38:42.280 - 00:39:06.070, Speaker B: Can you imagine how embarrassing it would be if the list of people that were a member to that ended up getting leaked? Can you imagine that? That would be brute. And if you were like, on that, let's put it like this. Would you rather have it leaked to the world that you are a subscriber to ten only fans accounts or the Andrew Tate or the Andrew Tate, like, self help little club?
00:39:06.150 - 00:39:11.740, Speaker C: Listen, I used to subscribe to Willy Woo. Substack? That would probably be the most embarrassing of the three.
00:39:12.110 - 00:39:17.534, Speaker A: Oh, man, I bet I've subscribed to some embarrassing stuff back in the day. Back in my self help college days.
00:39:17.652 - 00:39:24.354, Speaker C: There's always that moment where you're, like, coming out of college, like, 23, 24. Man, am I really going to work this corporate job for the rest of my life?
00:39:24.392 - 00:39:29.662, Speaker A: When I was, like, 19, I read a lot of, like, rich dad, poor dad, robert Kiyosaki.
00:39:29.726 - 00:39:30.354, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:39:30.472 - 00:39:42.242, Speaker A: Think and grow rich. Napoleon Hill. I think it was how to win Friends and influence people. Those books. Like, 19 year old me ripped those books.
00:39:42.386 - 00:39:47.960, Speaker C: The worst self help book is The Game. I don't know if you have any friends that read that.
00:39:49.930 - 00:39:51.878, Speaker A: It was in that group, but I never read it.
00:39:51.964 - 00:39:58.986, Speaker C: If that's how you talk to women, if that's how you learn how to talk to women, you're going to have some big problems later in life. You may turn into actual Andrew Tate at some point.
00:39:59.008 - 00:40:03.180, Speaker B: Oh, is this the pickup book? Is, like, pickup artist type thing.
00:40:05.710 - 00:40:15.760, Speaker C: The concept is like, okay, all women are the same. This is how you should approach them. You should act like an alpha male and kind of a dick. And the people who've read that, it's like, you can't really bring them back. Yeah.
00:40:17.750 - 00:40:20.370, Speaker A: Once you go full like The Game, you never come back.
00:40:20.440 - 00:40:31.478, Speaker C: You never come back. But I think to the original point is, like, the Hustler Academy is filled with guys that are trying to make it. And those are your three best options.
00:40:31.564 - 00:40:46.938, Speaker B: According to was there I was listening to a podcast. This is like a legacy podcast. I still tune into everyone. It's hosted by these two people that don't know crypto. But I like this podcast a lot.
00:40:46.944 - 00:40:47.366, Speaker C: It's pivot.
00:40:47.398 - 00:40:50.646, Speaker B: I don't mean to shit on either of these two. I like Kara. And I like Scott Galloway.
00:40:50.838 - 00:40:51.546, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:40:51.648 - 00:41:18.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been listening to it for years. It's like my guilty pleasure thing that I listen to. And Scott was on the board of he's. On the board of he. And he was describing he was like, yeah, so people are buying up our wallets. And I keep urging the founder that the future of crypto isn't in these NFTs or anything like that. It's in storing digital assets, like healthcare records and supply chain material.
00:41:18.978 - 00:41:23.186, Speaker B: I was like, I cannot imagine Pascal listening to that on a board meeting I want to cosplay.
00:41:23.218 - 00:41:24.742, Speaker A: I was like, get this guy out.
00:41:24.796 - 00:41:26.902, Speaker C: Thanks, Scott. We'll get right on that.
00:41:26.956 - 00:41:31.974, Speaker B: Thanks, dude. 100%, Scott. I'm with you on that, Scott. Big fat. Yeah, but I don't mean to be mean.
00:41:32.012 - 00:42:03.970, Speaker C: It's like something I tweeted today. People are obsessed with these real world use cases where their mother will be able to use it and their grandmother will be keeping her health care records on that. There's just like, guys, we're building a large crypto economy, and you're focused on putting these things on chain. What types of revenue are they going to generate? How are they going to be reflexive and have a flywheel? I don't know. I kind of think we're in this purgatory where any use case we come up with will be declared as not a real use case. But that's how people get sidelined.
00:42:04.470 - 00:42:44.094, Speaker B: It's interesting trying to talk to someone who the majority. A lot of people came into crypto in the last 24 months or something, and all they knew was the bull market before this. And now this is the first iteration of these real world use cases that they're seeing. And it's very compelling to people who've been in crypto for like, two years, because it's like, oh, okay, dog coins aren't really going to be a thing. And they're more skeptical in their head, and they're like these real world use cases of tokenization and real world assets, which there might be some merit to real world assets. I haven't really made up my mind, but it's basically just a rehashing of blockchain, not bitcoin and enterprise blockchain and a lot of that.
00:42:44.132 - 00:43:06.390, Speaker C: Same thing? Same thing. Every single thing, yeah. And Coinbase and Brian Armstrong have talked about this where I think after the 2014 or 2015 run, they were kind of down in the doldrums. Their exchange wasn't generating a lot of money, and one of their board members was saying, you guys need to Pivot to be and this company doesn't exist anymore. An R Three competitor which built private blockchains for people who literally never use them.
00:43:06.460 - 00:43:07.720, Speaker A: I remember r three.
00:43:08.810 - 00:43:13.190, Speaker C: Remember digital assets with Blythe masters?
00:43:14.170 - 00:43:15.740, Speaker A: I remember them well. Yeah.
00:43:16.270 - 00:43:32.382, Speaker C: How are those things going? They did not survive. They did not find product market fit. They were staffed with the smartest people in finance. The reality is those are interesting enterprise SaaS businesses, but that's not the movement. It's not the revolution. It's not like what we're trying to build. It's just not the big market.
00:43:32.516 - 00:44:11.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. But the point that there are also outside of that on Pivot is like that. And I actually do kind of believe this as an idea. It's like the ultimate buyers of these things. The reason why bitcoin and Ethereum and crypto is so compelling to a younger millennial or Gen Z type generation is because if you talk to especially Gen Z, there's this idea that the system is like, we're already fucked. If we try to do the thing that our parents did, or people that are older than us buy stocks, you're not going to work, never going to make it. So we need to do something else, something that's like higher risk, higher volatility, like higher convexity, kind of.
00:44:11.306 - 00:44:27.010, Speaker B: And crypto is that thing. And I actually do I think I buy that argument because I also think, like, that a little bit. There's a part of me where it's like, yeah, I'm not going to make money buying the stock market right now. Look at it's. Ridiculous.
00:44:28.310 - 00:45:06.414, Speaker C: I think it's different now, too, because of social media. What do you see when you go on Instagram models and private jets and movie stars and rock stars, and everyone was brought up with the idea of, like, you too will someday be one of these people? But there's a lot of daylight between the average person and getting to that level. And so it's logical. You didn't have that mirror of pop culture 2030 years ago that was instant on demand. If you're living in New York, you probably didn't even know what was going on in on Los Angeles. Now, that culture, the movie star, big life, that's everywhere. And I think that's what people are all aiming for just because of social media.
00:45:06.414 - 00:45:09.822, Speaker C: So I think it's now like that more than ever.
00:45:09.956 - 00:45:22.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so, too. Social media is a tricky don't. I have a lot of conversations with my dad about this, who ascribes a lot of the ill in society to social media, and I've kind of defended it for a long time.
00:45:22.312 - 00:45:23.262, Speaker A: Mr. Ipolita.
00:45:23.326 - 00:45:24.002, Speaker B: You imagine that?
00:45:24.056 - 00:45:28.230, Speaker A: Damn social networks. Yeah, I'm just kidding. I do love your dad.
00:45:31.050 - 00:45:34.518, Speaker B: I've defended him a lot, and I increasingly think he might be right.
00:45:34.604 - 00:45:36.102, Speaker A: I'm completely on his page, too.
00:45:36.156 - 00:45:49.610, Speaker C: Yeah, you go on Instagram now, it's just trash. It looks like a chat GPT-3 instance took over the Internet, and it's just like all models and movie stars and cool houses.
00:45:50.830 - 00:46:01.258, Speaker A: You guys should watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix. If you're not already convinced that social media is horrible, you will delete Instagram from your phone immediately.
00:46:01.434 - 00:46:05.520, Speaker C: I deleted it. I deleted Instagram and Twitter. Haven't had them for like a year.
00:46:07.190 - 00:46:12.340, Speaker A: I also haven't had Twitter and Instagram on my phone, and I don't have any social media on my phone, actually.
00:46:13.270 - 00:46:17.474, Speaker C: If I need to tweet something, I need to go sit down on my computer, open the computer, take a breath.
00:46:17.522 - 00:46:18.134, Speaker A: Me too.
00:46:18.252 - 00:46:20.914, Speaker C: Type in my password, tweet.
00:46:21.042 - 00:46:26.294, Speaker A: If I have Twitter on my phone, it is endless scrolling, so I just don't have it.
00:46:26.412 - 00:46:38.026, Speaker B: Yeah, all you really need to know is that all these execs at Apple and Facebook, they don't let their kids use it. They limit their kids. That's the only thing you need to know.
00:46:38.128 - 00:46:40.010, Speaker C: Would you let your kid buy crypto?
00:46:41.630 - 00:46:42.634, Speaker A: Why wouldn't you?
00:46:42.752 - 00:46:58.846, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. You know what, though? There was like a you know, it's not totally binary either. I mean, there was like, we let people smoke cigarettes even though it's bad for them, but someone has stepped in and be like, yo, you can't inject this shit right into people's veins. You need to put a filter on that.
00:46:59.028 - 00:47:00.178, Speaker C: Don't market it to kids.
00:47:00.264 - 00:47:11.270, Speaker B: You can't use this chemical. You can't market it to kids. Honestly, we might just be living in the part of society before they introduce whatever that equivalent is for social media and phones and all this stuff.
00:47:11.340 - 00:47:35.086, Speaker C: The TikTok Ban bill is out today. I think it's Senator Josh Harley or something. So, like, we're getting yeah, that used to feel like the cardinal rule of, you know, capitalism. Do whatever you want, but don't fuck with the kids. They're the future. And now it's okay. Like, we're finally getting there to the point where you've realized these things are semi poisonous and we probably need to curtail them.
00:47:35.086 - 00:47:36.894, Speaker C: So I think it's really good.
00:47:37.092 - 00:47:51.220, Speaker B: Benioff called Facebook the new cigarettes, like, three or four years ago, and I actually remember listening to it at the time being like, what are you talking about, dude? And I'm like, he has his own reasons for saying that, but he's probably more right than wrong.
00:47:51.670 - 00:48:00.760, Speaker C: Most people can identify the point in their lives where they started using social media, and there's kind of, like, the before and after. That's probably not a good thing.
00:48:01.450 - 00:48:34.778, Speaker B: I agree with that. Oh, you know what else? Just last point on this topic. Have you guys ever heard of a movie called 8th Grade? Okay, watch. Eigth grade is 8th grade is it follows, like, a girl who's in 8th grade, basically. And it's just dude, it's pretty depressing because do you remember being that old? Like, you were super young and in middle school, and I don't know what you guys did at that period of your like, I played a lot of Xbox. I had no access to any of this stuff then. And watch her like it's.
00:48:34.778 - 00:48:37.938, Speaker B: Bo burnham. Bo Burnham did the movie, if you guys know who he is.
00:48:38.104 - 00:48:44.850, Speaker C: My plan was to become a professional skateboarder. That's what I was for at that point. Yeah. Didn't work. But we found something else.
00:48:44.920 - 00:49:26.282, Speaker B: There's just two stories that I want to get to before we jump. So something happened earlier this week with Stargate Finance. This is kind of funny, but it's also indicative of a bigger problem. So this got posted in their governance forum. The Stargate Foundation has been approached by an individual representing that he works with a family office that is looking to acquire $2 million of STG at market price from the Stargate Dow. As this is the first time this has happened, this issue is being brought forward to the Stargate Dow. Should the stargate dow complete this transaction? Selling $2 million worth of STG priced as a three day time weighted average price TWAP for USDC this USDC would then be used to purchase ETH that is locked in Stargate Pol and support Stargate liquidity on ethereum.
00:49:26.282 - 00:49:49.670, Speaker B: Assuming a target APY of 5%, this would reduce STG emissions by 100,000 per year and strengthen Stargate's permanent liquidity, blah, blah, blah. Basically, we just want to let the community know. Fast forward to 2 seconds later. Stargate pumps from $0.47 straight up to $0.69. That's really funny. And it's just like obviously everyone front ran this.
00:49:49.670 - 00:49:56.214, Speaker B: When you publish that, there might be a huge OTC buy. So one that's kind of funny, unless.
00:49:56.262 - 00:50:00.362, Speaker A: It'S Psyops and the family office already bought and then that was their way to pump it.
00:50:00.416 - 00:50:16.994, Speaker B: It could be psyops. Yeah, but how could they like, I don't know what the liquidity is in Stargate. I would guess it's super thin. So I guess this would reflect poorly on Stargate. Or I guess maybe the family office somehow sourced the liquidity outside of this or I don't know how they would have done that.
00:50:17.032 - 00:50:18.654, Speaker C: But you're right, it could be Psyops.
00:50:18.702 - 00:50:22.820, Speaker A: Probably not psyops. And probably they just got front ran. And this is a good lesson in governance, though.
00:50:25.510 - 00:50:46.662, Speaker B: Let me just ask you, because we've talked about this in the context of not airing dirty laundry necessarily. Sometimes you see these really personal work feuds that get aired out in governance forums. What do you think is appropriate? How much should be kept behind closed doors because it's frankly better for everyone involved. Versus what are things that should be run through governance?
00:50:46.806 - 00:51:14.034, Speaker A: Most should be kept behind closed doors. I don't think that the idea of a Dow needs to be transparent. Everything and every decision goes through. I think there's this idea that Dows have to have everything 100% transparent and Dows have to have every decision made by committee. And I think both of those things will be seen as a remnant of the early days of Dows. You can't build good companies like that.
00:51:14.152 - 00:51:21.366, Speaker B: I agree with that. I agree. Especially HR issues and stuff. I mean, that doesn't serve anyone.
00:51:21.468 - 00:51:22.358, Speaker A: Why would you want to know?
00:51:22.444 - 00:51:29.878, Speaker B: Yeah, but this is a good reminder too, also why there's alpha in governance and it pays to pay attention to this stuff every now and again.
00:51:29.964 - 00:51:32.842, Speaker A: I think the most alpha in crypto is in governance right now.
00:51:32.976 - 00:52:32.998, Speaker B: Yeah, there was something else we didn't really want to talk about on this, but there was a curve pumped because basically avalanche or sorry, Ave was unwinding the impact of some bad debt that was in one of their curve pools, which is courtesy of Avi eisenberg Rip. And this also went through the governance form and curve also pumped because basically Ave bought back a bunch of curve. So you can pay attention to this stuff and it is very helpful. Last thing I wanted to get your take on because I know you've got some thoughts on this is just is Doodles moving over to flow? So the background is on Wednesday, they announced that Doodles Two, which was premiered back in June, is going to launch on Flow. Doodles Two is to span millions of NFTs instead of the 10,000 Avatars in the first Doodle series, which I actually think is very interesting. Core doodles collections were made on Ethereum, so that's not changing. This is just doodles two.
00:52:32.998 - 00:52:59.890, Speaker B: But basically the founder posted a thread for why they chose Flow, which has to do with kind of the almost like the customer journey for signing up and getting an NFT. So you can just create a wallet really easily in Gmail when you use Flow, you can buy wearables with your credit card in a couple of clicks, no transaction fees. So there are some legitimate reasons to using Flow. What's your sort of thought on this decision from Doodles?
00:53:00.390 - 00:53:58.630, Speaker A: It's a big risk that I disagree with, but I could be wrong. And I think basically what they're doing is they're so you have Doodles core, which is like the 10,000 doodles, and those I think my understanding is they're staying on Ethereum. And then there's like Doodles Two, which are going to be like millions of doodles and those are moving over to Flow or those will be built on Flow. I think that they're basically jeopardizing their core audience for this hypothetical and potential massive tam audience, which is like normies who use Flow because it's super easy to use and it doesn't feel like crypto. And every time I've seen that strategy over the last four, five, six years, it's never worked. But I get how the decision was made, which is like today we're just this 10,000 PFP crypto thing. I think there's actually a broader problem here, which is like, Doodles raised 54 million or 50 million at 700 million dollar valuation.
00:53:58.630 - 00:54:36.178, Speaker A: They have to grow into this valuation, right? If you raised it 700 million, if they want to get a ten X, they have to become a $7 billion project. So you don't do that by staying as a 10,000 PFP collection that's just held by crypto people. So this is them needing to take a swing because they raise so much money at such a high valuation. And I think that's why they're moving over to Flow. But I don't know flow. I never hear about Flow who uses Flow. Like, TOPSHOT is dead.
00:54:36.178 - 00:55:09.246, Speaker A: They did a big thing with Dr. Seuss. I don't even think that got off the ground. And they created nice IP with NBA TOPSHOTS, but I haven't heard about that in like a year. And also they built a completely permissioned it's not DeFi and it's not like a permissionless crypto platform. It's a completely walled off garden, which I think I don't know. I would assume what happened here is Flow went to know most of the doodles team came out of CryptoKitties, and most of the Flow team came out of CryptoKitties too.
00:55:09.246 - 00:55:21.710, Speaker A: So what I would assume happened. Is they're close friends. Flow went to Doodles, and I'm sure they gave them a decent chunk of change to go move on to Flow, and that's fine to happen. I just probably disagree with the decision.
00:55:21.790 - 00:55:53.726, Speaker B: One thing I think is kind of interesting is the decision to launch millions. So I don't know if you ever read or listened to any of the interviews by Gabe Layton, but he kind of has this idea that most people will get their first exposure to crypto through an NFT. And he has this whole thing about free to own. There'll be free NFTs, and then I'll make you sign up for a wallet. And that'll be the Trojan Horse. I do think there's this weird thing that's happened with the initial punks collection. Kind of picked an arbitrary number of punks out of thin air when it was unclear that any real value would accrue there.
00:55:53.726 - 00:56:18.530, Speaker B: And ever since, everyone's just copied this 10,000 number for no real reason. And what that's given rise to is just these whale community. It's just made NFTs like a whale game. And the whole NFTs, all you do is you find a mint that you can be early to. You mint the NFT. You either flip it or you hold onto it when you can become like a whale. And it means that there's no sustainable revenue model for NFTs.
00:56:18.530 - 00:56:53.714, Speaker B: And if you look at Yuga Labs, all they do is just find new ways to there's, like, the secondary trading fees, and then there's minting new primary sales of NFT. They're just primary sailing this, primary sailing that. And I think the way that you open up your base to a broader number of people and therefore increase transaction revenue is to have larger collections of less expensive NFTs. So maybe Doodles is doing that. That would be cool, but I don't know that that's their strategy, so I'm with you. It kind of feels a little bit.
00:56:53.752 - 00:56:54.786, Speaker A: Weird, to be honest.
00:56:54.888 - 00:56:55.394, Speaker B: Move.
00:56:55.512 - 00:57:05.774, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know who else is built on Flow. I don't know one other thing built on flow.
00:57:05.902 - 00:57:13.206, Speaker B: No me open. I know they have plans to open up and become permissionless, but if they did, then I would be more excited about it and kind of change my mind.
00:57:13.308 - 00:57:36.794, Speaker A: It's like liquidity rules everything rules everything in the NFT space, and there's no liquidity. There's $6 million of NFT volume on Flow in total. Users don't want to store high value NFTs on Flow. So I think you'll see these the good doodles will stay on ETH, and then the bad doodles go to Flow. I don't know. It just doesn't feel like a good strategy.
00:57:36.922 - 00:57:43.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. All right, buddy, I think any other stories? Anything else you want to catch up on?
00:57:44.770 - 00:57:52.174, Speaker A: No, it's about it. It's funny that we pour one out for Kevin Rose. He got hacked. $2 million sucks. Poor guy.
00:57:52.212 - 00:58:01.126, Speaker B: Honestly. Big fan of that guy. And if he's not safe, and he's getting hacked in this space. I'll be honest, it makes me feel a little bit nervous as well.
00:58:01.228 - 00:58:23.440, Speaker A: One thing that everyone needs to do is just have two wallets. You have a wallet where you hold your valuable stuff and then a wallet that you use to interact with smart contracts. Like, no if, ands, or buts. Everyone should have that, and he didn't have that. He had all of his NFTs in one wallet. Probably the reason you do that is either laziness or to flex, to show, like, I've got all these NFTs in this one public wallet. Look at me.
00:58:23.440 - 00:58:44.542, Speaker A: And I think this is what happens when you have all your stuff in this one valuable wallet and you're interacting with smart contracts. So what I do is I have a wallet that never touches anything, never touches smart contracts, and then if I want to mint or I want to sell something or interact with the smart contract, I move the asset over into that wallet.
00:58:44.606 - 00:58:54.680, Speaker B: I know. Let's give him the benefit of doubt and say, I don't know if it's about maybe he's just very active. That's a huge pain in the ass. What you're describing. That system is a gigantic pain in the ass.
00:58:55.290 - 00:59:17.466, Speaker A: I pour one out for him, for sure. I feel really bad for him. I'm just saying, I don't think I wouldn't have $2 million in a wallet where you're interacting with smart contracts. And that's not on him. That's on the industry to like, I don't know. There's got to be a better way to do this. I don't know the better way, but I feel like MetaMask could give a flag being like, this is a bad contract.
00:59:17.466 - 00:59:18.794, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know the solution.
00:59:18.842 - 00:59:26.414, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm with you there. All right, budy. I think we can close that. I love how you missed the crypto stuff in the beginning and just came.
00:59:26.452 - 00:59:28.026, Speaker A: I just came on to talk about social networks.
00:59:28.058 - 00:59:39.640, Speaker B: Yeah, about social media. You know what? I've drank the cool. I think it's after a long time defending it and be trying to be too contrarian for my own good, I think they're pretty bad.
00:59:40.330 - 00:59:42.934, Speaker A: Me too. I'm going boomer on it. I agree.
00:59:43.052 - 00:59:44.006, Speaker B: I go and boomer too.
00:59:44.028 - 00:59:46.434, Speaker A: All right, partner. Good chat. Peace.
00:59:46.482 - 00:59:47.170, Speaker B: Bye. Peace.
