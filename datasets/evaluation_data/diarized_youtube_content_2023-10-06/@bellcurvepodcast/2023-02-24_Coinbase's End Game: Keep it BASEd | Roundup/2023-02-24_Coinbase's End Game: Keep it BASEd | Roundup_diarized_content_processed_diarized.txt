00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.080, Speaker A: Before we jump into this episode, quick reminder that everything said on Bell Curve is a meme, and nothing said on Bell Curve is financial advice. Enjoy the app.
00:00:14.370 - 00:00:20.702, Speaker B: All right, guys, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. You got Michael's one and two. Yano and Vance fellas. Welcome back.
00:00:20.836 - 00:00:21.840, Speaker A: What's happening?
00:00:22.610 - 00:00:23.582, Speaker C: Good to see you guys.
00:00:23.636 - 00:00:27.270, Speaker A: Good. Good week, huh? I feel like good week for crypto.
00:00:27.610 - 00:00:28.774, Speaker D: I had a good week.
00:00:28.892 - 00:00:30.230, Speaker B: What happened in Crypto?
00:00:30.890 - 00:00:33.640, Speaker A: Ryan Carson left. NFT. So we're back.
00:00:34.090 - 00:00:35.240, Speaker B: Oh, he's out.
00:00:36.250 - 00:00:37.000, Speaker C: Nice.
00:00:37.930 - 00:00:40.440, Speaker D: How he can resume the yeah, yeah.
00:00:40.810 - 00:00:47.226, Speaker B: I like that. We finally got evidence this week that you should invest in Bald CEOs. That's that's my big takeaway from this.
00:00:47.328 - 00:00:49.340, Speaker C: I've been I've been saying this for a while.
00:00:50.110 - 00:00:58.990, Speaker B: Bald is undefeated. Bald is undefeated. It's like the have you ever seen the Curb Your Enthusiasm with the attractive wife? But it's the unattractive wife.
00:00:59.970 - 00:01:00.718, Speaker A: Same thing.
00:01:00.804 - 00:01:05.922, Speaker B: Fagaya's hair is just too vain for me personally. Give me a bald man that guy's got working.
00:01:05.976 - 00:01:07.490, Speaker A: Basically short framework.
00:01:11.190 - 00:01:18.180, Speaker D: We're quadruple threats. We're hair, body, face, and eyebrow guys. So your eyebrow guns, what does that even mean?
00:01:21.910 - 00:01:22.690, Speaker A: That's right.
00:01:22.760 - 00:01:23.798, Speaker B: If you do the one up or.
00:01:23.804 - 00:01:26.200, Speaker A: One down, give all that and carry up and down.
00:01:27.210 - 00:01:39.100, Speaker B: Wow, look at that. Eyebrow control. All right, let's actually get into it. You got to talk about Coinbase because they had a big week. Do you guys want to do earnings or base the L2 chain first?
00:01:39.790 - 00:01:40.970, Speaker D: Let's do base.
00:01:41.120 - 00:01:41.578, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:41.664 - 00:01:42.106, Speaker B: Cool.
00:01:42.208 - 00:01:43.020, Speaker C: All right.
00:01:43.870 - 00:01:46.286, Speaker B: You actually did the interview with Jesse. You want to give us yeah, sure.
00:01:46.308 - 00:02:10.278, Speaker A: I like give a little overview. So, basically, this week, Coinbase launched their own l Two. It's called base. It's built on the Op stack, which is different than being built on optimism. So the Op Stack is open source code that powers optimism. The backstory, the little backstory is that they met the optimism team while optimism was working on EIP or contributing to EIP. 4844 met the team, really liked them.
00:02:10.278 - 00:02:48.834, Speaker A: Coinbase is now joining as the second core dev team working on the Op Stack. And they're also going to contribute some of the sequencer revenue to fund public goods, including contributing to the Op Stack from a competition lens bases. My understanding is that they're competing with all the other L2 S. Like, they're competing with optimism and other L2 S right now. Eventually they see everything being interoperable, integrating together, but not yet, which is like, kind of a funny thing because optimism is helping Coinbase get this off the ground, but also competing with them. But Crypto, it's permissionless from day one. It's in testnet right now.
00:02:48.834 - 00:03:23.166, Speaker A: Mainnet comes soon. They're also launching this ecosystem fund to incentivize development. From a business model perspective, it seems like the business model is fees here, but that's something I definitely want to talk about with you guys. They're not enabling mev right now. So basically transactions are just going to be handled in the way in the order that they come into the sequencer. And on the note of the sequencer, I think Coinbase right now is the only sequencer, but eventually they're going to decentralize the block building, which will or should open up mev. I think that's about it.
00:03:23.166 - 00:03:30.400, Speaker A: And there's no token, which is from a regulatory perspective, no token, no mev seems probably like a smart move.
00:03:31.570 - 00:04:03.740, Speaker D: And there's some agreement between Coinbase and optimism for them to pay. I think it was 20% in an earlier version of the website, but now it's like some arbitrary percent for use of their sequencer. And that seems to be the optimism business model going forward, is a million different app chains and they all use the sequencer. We'll see if that works. We're also investors in optimism. So for bias here, but I tweeted this, but it does feel like the app chain narrative is starting to play out on ETH, which is cool.
00:04:04.510 - 00:04:17.770, Speaker B: Yeah. What do your guys kind of take around? Obviously this created a lot of energy. It kind of leaked a little bit before they did that little blue orb or whatever. And I think a lot of people guessed.
00:04:17.930 - 00:04:20.000, Speaker C: Everyone on Twitter leaked it.
00:04:20.450 - 00:04:21.434, Speaker D: I want there was a leak.
00:04:21.482 - 00:04:25.470, Speaker A: I think Coinbase was like a blood. Get people hyped.
00:04:26.050 - 00:04:42.950, Speaker B: But how do you guys contextualize this? Do you think it's a really big deal Coinbase has? I think 108,000,000 users is the figure they gave at their earnings. So could be a huge push to get people kind of on chain, but kind of help contextualize. How big of a deal is this? How good is it for Coinbase?
00:04:43.290 - 00:05:10.400, Speaker A: Game changer. I think this will be one of the biggest product launches of the year. I think bringing crypto to 110,000,000 registered users on Coinbase EVM equivalents gasless transactions, all the Coinbase APIs account abstraction from day one, native Bridging, professional RPC nodes from day one. You're basically bringing 100 plus million users into l two and crypto native land. I think it's a huge deal.
00:05:11.970 - 00:05:17.538, Speaker C: You just touched on the two points that I think are the most important. The number one is account abstraction, where.
00:05:17.624 - 00:05:18.722, Speaker D: You'Re going to be able to have.
00:05:18.776 - 00:05:50.102, Speaker C: An account or an app or some interaction where the app is actually paying your gas fees. And that I think, has been actually rudimentary to think about. But that's been the number one impediment to growth from a user perspective. It's just like every single time you go into an app and you have to charge somebody to actually use the app. It's just so counterintuitive to how the native Internet works. And so the ability to have account abstraction out of the gate with 100 million registered users, that's massive. The second is the native integration.
00:05:50.102 - 00:06:51.200, Speaker C: Being able to actually have an entity sign financial contracts or any sort of legal agreements on one end and then put a token on the other end. And have that be the native Bridging is a massive deal. One of the feces that I personally have been thinking about a lot. And we're starting to see a little bit of the tea leaves as they start to form up. But real world assets on chain, real world assets in DFI I think is one of the major theses that we can point to in 2023 to be like, okay, this is going to be like one of the major themes up the future of D Five. But the biggest issue is being able to have authority and authenticity of real world assets being put on chain. What if you want to put some collateral that exists in a legal contract in the real world? Who's going to be the arbiter of that? Who's going to have the legal contract? Who's going to be able to verify that that's real? This should be the application layer that enables I mean, those are the two big things that I think about what I think about Coinbase and Base.
00:06:51.200 - 00:07:11.720, Speaker C: The other thing is just like, I don't think that people are going to actually understand how big of a deal this is until a year or two from now. And it's going to be one of those like, oh wow, this they launched and nobody really gets it, nobody understands it, but eventually everyone's going to be like, oh wow, that was a massive deal, but only retrospect, not right now.
00:07:14.570 - 00:07:39.550, Speaker D: Agree with everything Michael said. The two unique takes I think I have on this are the more that people have rollups that don't have tokens, the more everyone else is going to get questioned and pushed on why they have a token. If you have things like Eigen layer and if you have things like base which are both demonstrating how to create rollups, data availability layers, bridges, Oracle networks, without a token, I think there's going to be a real question as to.
00:07:39.620 - 00:07:40.954, Speaker B: What the value prop of a token.
00:07:41.002 - 00:08:14.486, Speaker D: For something like arbitram or frankly optimism is. So that's one unique take I have. I think the other is it's super cool. They're going to onboard a ton of people. It's going to be really great. And then there's going to be a moment where the inmates take over the mental asylum and there's like, ohm, forks and dog coins and all sorts of crazy stuff happening. And that's going to be a moment where I think the probably regulators or powers that beer like, what the hell is going on on this chain that you created Coinbase? And that's going to be hard to answer in some contexts.
00:08:14.486 - 00:08:41.890, Speaker D: But in other contexts there is no security here, there is no token, there is no expectation of profit. It is just an ecosystem that's running on open source software that's built on ethereum. And yes, you can decentralize the sequencer, but it's going to be really hard for regulators to really press on this in a way that is meaningful. I think that might be part of the Coinbase strategy here, is like, look, we just built this. This is open source technology. People can do with it what they want. But fundamentally, whatever happens on the chain is really not our fault.
00:08:42.950 - 00:09:12.400, Speaker C: One question that I have is, how do you guys break down? What's the business opportunity here? Obviously, they didn't talk about there's no token, there's no ability to invest in base right now. But the way that you would assume that Coinbase will make money is that there's going to be a set of validators for this ecosystem. And there can be the ones who are earning some form of payment, I think, right now, at least in the form of east, maybe there's other forms of payment of actually, what do you think the ultimate business model is here for Coinbase and launching base?
00:09:13.010 - 00:09:56.026, Speaker A: I have three business model ideas for Coinbase here. One is that Finance did 1.2 million in fees yesterday. The BNB, or finance chain, whatever you want to call it, doing like roughly the same volume as Arbitrum in terms of transaction scale, that's $500 million a year that they're generating in revenue in a down market. And I think that there's no reason that the base chain can't do something similar just with on chain fees. So I think right now, you look at L, two S are making like 100 million a year on sequencer fees in a bear market with, let's call it a couple of hundred thousand users. I think optimism maybe is less than that.
00:09:56.026 - 00:10:34.306, Speaker A: Like 20 million a year or 30 million a year. Arbitrum is probably closer to 50 million, 100 million a year. So I think that's one model is fees. The next model is, I think, coinbase. Now with this, it puts them in the lead to win the real world asset battle. So right now, Coinbase, I think Devs or anyone building like real world asset stuff, will basically be able to leverage all the KYC data for whitelisting of real world assets. Plus, Coinbase can offer on ramping and direct on ramping to the chain from Coinbase, which is super lucrative.
00:10:34.306 - 00:11:16.260, Speaker A: So I think it basically just like it makes putting securities on chain 100 times easier because you can determine how much KYC and how much you want to pull in from the centralized Coinbase. So I don't know exactly how that'll work, but I would have got to imagine this puts them in the lead for real world asset stuff. And then I think the third is just staking and like CBE. I think at the start, Coinbase is going to make these small UX decisions that push CBE on base. And then eventually, I think you could see CBE becoming the gas token of base. So trying to make CVE the de facto LSD would be the third business model.
00:11:16.870 - 00:11:34.362, Speaker B: I agree with all those. I would add one more, which is their wallet I think is going to be integral to this play. Think about it, they decided to play at the L2 level, not the layer three level. Right. There's like a roll app architecture that people are building on bedrock. They decided to go level two.
00:11:34.496 - 00:11:35.914, Speaker D: Roll app did you say?
00:11:35.952 - 00:11:57.842, Speaker B: Yeah, roll app, that's roll app. Yeah. I did not. I'll take credit for it. Like, sure, yeah, why not? But no, the roll app. So I think one of the things that Coinbase has been if people have been kind of sleeping on is this wallet. Right? Honestly, you guys said it crypto still has a MetaMask problem.
00:11:57.842 - 00:12:18.070, Speaker B: In general. I've used the coinbase wallet. It's pretty nice if you suddenly onboarded. How many active users does MetaMask have? 6 million people. Coinbase has 108,000,000 users. If they converted even 20% of that, they've got three times the amount of users of MetaMask. And I actually think it's a pretty kind of a brave business move.
00:12:18.070 - 00:13:00.258, Speaker B: Honestly. The bread and butter of Coinbase is still transaction based. I'm sure what you could look at is this could be cannibalizing to that the obvious revenue source is like in wallet swaps, right, from the Coinbase wallet, which you could look at as kind of cannibalizing the golden goose. But I think they sense that's where the market is kind of going and could be of it's. What Jason said. You can kind of push people in the UIUX and make CB the coinbase wallet, kind of the native wallet of this ecosystem that they're pushing all of these people into and they could kind of take down MetaMask. There it also vance, you kind of brought up this idea of the app chain.
00:13:00.258 - 00:13:45.182, Speaker B: Like one question that I have is, and I think it's still undecided is how fat is the exchange layer going to be as an application layer? Because right now they've bundled a whole bunch of things together. They've got custody, they act as a brokerage, they act as an exchange. They do all of these things and it's like TBD on how that's going to get bundled out, right, and broken up. And there is a world where Coinbase acts as a thinner layer kind of in the future, like a thin app layer on top of a whole bunch of DeFi protocols. And they're kind of the aggregator distribution layer and they abstract away a lot of the complexities of interacting with DeFi. I think it's just I'm like very interested to see how that all evolves.
00:13:45.326 - 00:13:48.760, Speaker A: I think there will be two. Yeah, go ahead, Vance, go ahead.
00:13:49.290 - 00:14:00.410, Speaker D: Some aspects of DeFi they will like spot trading. Most aspects of DeFi lending, derivatives, insurance, not going to be able to touch too dicey from a regulatory perspective, but.
00:14:00.480 - 00:14:25.440, Speaker A: I see your point. They're going to build their own. So they're launching teams to go build apps as well on base. So there's going to be just builders who go build on base. But they're also going to build on base as well. So I could see right now in their wallet, I think they integrate. Like, if you want to swap, I think it probably integrates with like paraswap or Matcha or something like that.
00:14:25.440 - 00:14:52.518, Speaker A: I think you could eventually see them if you think about any other business in the world, if that was the case, you do that, you integrate and make it as easy as possible, and then you start climbing down the stack and you want to go lower and lower on the stack. So if this were another business, the inevitable thing seems like they do that. They get the users, then they start eating away and shipping and going lower and lower on the stack. So you could see them building like a paraswap competitor, right?
00:14:52.684 - 00:15:09.166, Speaker C: It seems to be really interesting the comparison that you had with the B and B chain making whatever, how many million day having all of that aggregate to coinbase the validator set of base which is going to be interesting from.
00:15:09.188 - 00:15:11.038, Speaker D: Just like what is decentralized, what is.
00:15:11.044 - 00:15:29.282, Speaker C: Not decentralized, who else is going to be a validator on base? There's no token. There's no egalitarian way of deciding who's going to be a validator. Is it going to be like Coinbase that decides who else is a validator? Is just Jimmy Coinbase, who's the validator in this ecosystem? Like, that point will be an interesting one to see how they traverse.
00:15:29.426 - 00:15:31.910, Speaker A: Why do you only watch with one validator?
00:15:33.290 - 00:15:39.450, Speaker C: Right? Do they decentralize it? What is a blockchain if it's just one validator?
00:15:40.750 - 00:16:27.794, Speaker B: But they all do that. My understanding is that the hardware everyone wants to decentralize the sequencer set. My understanding is that when you do that, it increases the hardware requirements of running one of those things to a point where it's not super feasible today. So I think it's on everyone's kind of roadmap to decentralize that sequencer set, but today it's just not super. Like, we talked about mev last episode, and I'm not sure about this, but look at what we talked about. Mev is probably going to get extracted at two points in the Mev value chain at the wallet layer, right, via order flow, and then at the block space layer via block space auctions. You could imagine a world here where Coinbase as its own l two kind of controls or has a lot of influence at the block space layer.
00:16:27.794 - 00:16:54.240, Speaker B: Right. With their right now, it's a solo sequencer, but eventually they'll still have a role in that. And then they've got if a bunch of people start trading on their wallet, then they kind of have access to the order flow layer at the top, too, which is a super unique position and imperfect analogy. But it's almost like Citadel securities and Robinhood being the same player, which is interesting.
00:16:55.650 - 00:16:58.610, Speaker C: Or like Top Shot and Flow being the same player.
00:17:00.710 - 00:17:04.100, Speaker B: Yeah, true. That's a security dude. We don't talk about it.
00:17:06.710 - 00:17:08.734, Speaker D: Security dismiss. Clive.
00:17:08.782 - 00:17:09.490, Speaker C: Action.
00:17:11.130 - 00:17:46.382, Speaker D: I do think that is relevant here though. If one of the facts around why this could potentially be a security for Dapper is the fact that they spun up their own validators. They had all the on and off ramps from a fiat wallet perspective. They had all the UI components. From an interaction with the chain perspective on their wallet, there is going to be a limit as to what Coinbase can extract from this chain, even if optically. But if it goes the direction of, like, we're extracting mev and we're extracting payment forwarder flow and we're building the NFTs and we're building the exchanges, I don't think that's a securities violation. I think that's more of like a Finsen.
00:17:46.382 - 00:17:50.306, Speaker D: Like, is this a network that you're just privately operating? How does this work?
00:17:50.408 - 00:18:16.918, Speaker C: I mean, not to dive too deep into it, but I would also say there's not too sharp of a comparison between Flow and what we're talking about here. With Base, with Flow, it was a private blockchain. They controlled the payment network. They issued all the different NFTs. They were the ones that they would literally restrict how much you could put in and how much you could pull out of the ecosystem. There were a lot more controls. It was very much database.
00:18:16.918 - 00:18:25.563, Speaker C: But I think it is kind of an interesting comparison. But to Man's point, the more you add on, the more you layer on.
00:18:25.563 - 00:18:26.958, Speaker D: On top of each other from the.
00:18:26.964 - 00:18:31.390, Speaker C: Same entity, the more there is a question of egalitarian decentralization.
00:18:32.930 - 00:18:52.786, Speaker D: Let's think about a funny worst case scenario for Base. So, say like Lazarus Group somehow bridges onto the chain and starts wreaking what? What does coinbase do? Can they do anything? Are they responsible? Are they in charge? What do you guys think? What are the regulators?
00:18:52.898 - 00:18:55.110, Speaker A: What do you mean by wreaking havoc? Vince?
00:18:55.930 - 00:19:08.026, Speaker D: Let's say that Lazarus Group steals a bunch of money from Base or from somewhere else and then bridges it onto Base and there's now this large slug of dirty money that's interacting with clean. Like, how does that play out?
00:19:08.048 - 00:19:26.580, Speaker C: Well, not even that. Let's say that they build a fork of Aave and they say, okay, great, we are now operating our own ave lending markets. And every single time it's not just like Aave and there's some dirty value that's on chain. It's like every single time you're interacting. The counterparty is Lazarus Group.
00:19:28.550 - 00:20:27.698, Speaker B: I've got another one for you as well. I'm not sure about the technical capabilities here. Maybe we can just edit this in after here. But there was a great excerpt. Alex Thorne, in his podcast, he interviewed someone who worked at Paxos with Binance and he described one of the reasons behind Binance's decision to have BUSD. And actually it was kind of like a risk management, liability management thing because people were basically making a whole bunch of different versions of BUSD and binance is associated with that from a brand standpoint. So this is an important concept but you can kind of look at things that are issued there as liabilities of binance in a sense, not necessarily a legal sense but like a brand sense, right? So my question to you guys is would you consider this kind of a liability for coinbase at the same time, even if it's not again, in a strict legal sense of people.
00:20:27.698 - 00:21:00.560, Speaker B: If there was like, for instance, a big exploit or something like that. And a bunch of people lost money on coinbase chain. What the brand move says to do is you want to compensate your users, right? In the same way that the Winklevice stepped in and provided a hundred million dollar backstop. So again, just on the considerations to have is like if this is some open permissionless thing and people we all know it's going to happen, right? People are going to get rugged, people are going to do dumb stuff. Are those kind of liabilities of Coinbase? I pose that no one question.
00:21:01.330 - 00:21:25.830, Speaker D: I think this is going to be regarded as a really good decision and then a really bad decision and then like a really good decision. It's just going to be a roller coaster once you start opening up these permissionless chains to people to build on and know do whatever they want to do on. Like Michael and I both know it can get pretty. Like the concept is no one's responsible. But if it's called base chain and your name's Coinbase.
00:21:30.330 - 00:21:39.530, Speaker C: That being like every single time someone gets hacked via some application on the internet, it's not like they're calling up Cisco because it went through Cisco routers.
00:21:40.030 - 00:21:42.786, Speaker D: I think there is coinbase is an easy target.
00:21:42.918 - 00:22:02.130, Speaker C: Coinbase is an easy target for sure. But I do kind of question whether or not people are going to ascribe at value of everything that's like coinbase versus apps are built on base. And frankly I just don't know. We don't know yet. We don't know what that separation is going to be. It's not like people are calling out Batolic every time they get robbed on ethereum.
00:22:03.270 - 00:22:26.778, Speaker A: Different. There was a case two years ago with Cloudflare. Do you guys know Cloudflare? Yep. Where people were suing Cloudflare for bad stuff that was happening across the internet. And I think specifically it was copyright infringement. So there'd be copyright infringement and someone like Disney would sue Cloudflare. They're like, our thing is getting copyrighted and it's going on this website, you have to take it down.
00:22:26.778 - 00:22:39.946, Speaker A: And actually I think the Supreme Court deemed that Cloudflare did not have to take that stuff down. Which I'm trying to draw an analogy to what two world but the totally.
00:22:39.978 - 00:23:16.810, Speaker C: Fair analogy, I don't know the details of that situation, but Cloudflare runs a lot of the internet and a lot of everything is either built with one of their products, built with one of their services or managed by one of them. Once again, easy target. I think they're publicly traded or at least a large company to go after. It's sort of like going after the ISP or going after the CDN for em data that happens to pop up somewhere around the internet. It feels know you can grasp its straws in that respect, but it's not going to be like really, who's at fault?
00:23:18.110 - 00:23:43.294, Speaker B: Yeah, again, in my mind it's less of who is legally liable fault. It's more of just a brand thing. And again, the chain is called Base. I think that's the difference. And they're a company, so no one's going to get anywhere by yelling at batolik the individual. But like Coinbase is an entity that you can so oh yeah, and they do get sued.
00:23:43.342 - 00:23:46.820, Speaker D: A yeah, yeah. Let's talk about the.
00:23:50.230 - 00:23:56.070, Speaker A: Sense in the sense that investors had no idea how to value this news and that the stock was actually down on this news.
00:23:56.220 - 00:24:28.002, Speaker B: Well, yes, well, let's get there. But let's talk about earnings first because they announced earnings this week before this news came out. So in terms of revenue, they did 604,000,000 versus 581.2 million of expectation. The way that breaks down is $308,000,000 of consumer trading, which is slightly down quarter over quarter. I think 9% down 182,000,000 through interest income. So that's basically that partnership that they have with Circle USDC and then 62.4
00:24:28.002 - 00:25:08.046, Speaker B: came from Staking Rewards, which is basically dead flat. And that's actually kind of interesting considering the success of CBE in terms of kind of profitability. They had a 4% quarter over quarter reduction in terms of employee headcount, that's still up 21% year over year. But they're kind of doing what Wall Street wants them to do, which is be more responsible from an operating standpoint. They had a Q four loss of 557,000,000, which seems like a lot, but it's where they guided. So I think two quarters ago they basically guided and said we're going to lose between five and $600 million a quarter. So this is within kind of what they said they were going to do.
00:25:08.046 - 00:25:35.618, Speaker B: Coinbase has $5.5 billion in cash. So I listened to the earnings call. It was not wild. The only thing that I would add to this is I would say that in the earnings call they indicated a change in philosophy. So previously they've guided and said, hey, we are basically going to make hey while the sun is shining. Like we expect to generate a lot of profits during a bull market and our aim is to break even during bear markets or down cyclical periods.
00:25:35.618 - 00:25:44.218, Speaker B: They've changed that philosophy. They now want to generate profit in all conditions, all market conditions. So it's what most people wants to.
00:25:44.224 - 00:25:47.500, Speaker C: Hear, even Coinbase moving from growth to value.
00:25:49.310 - 00:25:49.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:49.712 - 00:26:16.386, Speaker D: And everyone is going to be able to actually make that pivot, but everyone is saying that they're going to do it. I think that's like the trend. But Michael and I were talking about this a couple of nights ago. They're holed up in some place and they're basically surrounded by regulators, by class action lawsuits like staking income probably going to your point, get discounted. It's unclear if that will continue to persist in a world where crack and.
00:26:16.408 - 00:26:19.798, Speaker C: It'S down from a retail perspective, right?
00:26:19.884 - 00:26:44.314, Speaker D: In a world where crack and retail is down, custodial all the money that we pay to keep our cash or to keep our assets different places, if they're not a QC, that is a big deal. Paul Grewall on Twitter is like know we're a QC and we were yesterday and we'll be know tomorrow. His opinion doesn't really matter. We report to the SEC and they're the people who tell us where we can put our assets that will also go down.
00:26:44.432 - 00:26:57.022, Speaker C: So this is a major subject that we should talk about, but it'll go pit in that and we can talk about it in a bit. Like this QC thing that came out of the SEC last week I believe is like a major, major topic.
00:26:57.086 - 00:27:23.146, Speaker D: But we can pause QC income down, trading income down. Coinbase is definitely the stalwart of the US movement, especially the institutional movement for crypto. But I follow Djen Spartan, I see him buying Coin at 35 and 40. I don't necessarily think it definitely has a lot of hair on it, is.
00:27:23.168 - 00:28:12.042, Speaker C: How I would put it. It feels like every single business that they have is coming after, is getting chased after by regulators, by people, by competitors, whatever it may be. I mean, the Kraken stuff I think is big, that could have ramifications if similar logic about the same logic. Everything is facts and circumstances. CBE should be in the crosshairs of a regulatory action in the same way. That was so to talk about it now the SEC put out comments basically describing what their proposed change to what a qualified custodian is. And this is a rule change that would literally change or be a different interpretation of the Advisors Act.
00:28:12.042 - 00:29:23.680, Speaker C: Basically the TLDR is we are framework is in RAA with the SEC, which means that we have a duty of care to be able to keep all of our funds assets at a qualified custodian. Qualified custodians historically have been Anchorage, Coinbase, prime, there's a number of others that we've worked with or that provide the same service. The reason why you can have a qualified custodian is because they have, I believe, a trust charter that allows them to be a qualified custodian via their trust relationship. What the proposed rule will change is basically that being an available option for being a qualified custodian, which would effectively change the way that they're looking at subscription revenue or the way that they're looking at their prime offering for institutions. And I think that that is one of the business lives that's actually been growing and actually been shining. And it feels like there's just so many different angles that every single time they try to move in one direction or try to be able to build a base and build a strong business, there's getting shut down left, right, and.
00:29:24.210 - 00:30:01.546, Speaker D: There'S the additional nuance. So there's kind of like two ways to become a QC right now. There's a state charter or a state trust, which is what Coinbase has, and then there's a federal charter, which is what Anchorage has. And then everyone else who basically is a QC or claims to be a QC in the US has one of these state trusts or charters. And the only reason why Anchorage has the federal charter is because the OG Brian Brooks gave them that on his way out as the interim. So, you know, there's changes to this rule. There's also rumblings that maybe Coinbase or Anchorage could both get their charters pulled in some way, shape or form.
00:30:01.546 - 00:30:15.282, Speaker D: And then it's like, where does framework keep our assets? BNY Mellon is one. Like, they're not going to take the stuff that we have. We just have so many different types of tokens, there's just no feasible way that we could put it there.
00:30:15.336 - 00:30:17.634, Speaker A: And what would you actually do there?
00:30:17.832 - 00:30:57.630, Speaker D: We're trying to figure this out and same with every other firm. And one thing you can do is basically write a letter explaining why you're doing your duty of care for your assets and why this is representative of a qualified custodian, even though it might not technically be one, the fact is you're still probably in violation of SEC rules. This is not up to Coinbase to decide. This is up to the fund managers or to the SEC who are going to get dinged whenever they're having assets that are in non compliant places. And fireblocks isn't compliant. Like, all of these solutions, it's targeted at us, which is the weird part.
00:30:57.700 - 00:31:05.934, Speaker A: So this is basically just going to end up creating some sort of monopoly around custodial services, where the regulators are going to king make a couple of custody folks.
00:31:05.982 - 00:31:06.386, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:06.488 - 00:31:09.278, Speaker D: They've already been teammates.
00:31:09.374 - 00:31:11.554, Speaker B: Yeah, well, they've already been teammate, which.
00:31:11.592 - 00:31:39.350, Speaker C: Is Coinbase because they have a trust, anchorage, because they have a national trust, BMW Mellon, if you have Bitcoin and like, other banks, if you have Bitcoin only. But what they're trying to do now is take all the ones that were previously keen made and say, nope, those don't actually, like, there is going to be kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place if this goes through. But who is cannon fodder in this process? Subscription revenue at Coinbase.
00:31:39.510 - 00:31:40.314, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:40.512 - 00:32:04.882, Speaker D: And institutions that are trying to get into anything other than, like, Bitcoin or ETH. Yeah, maybe they can stuff that into BNY Mellon, come up with some bespoke arrangement. Also, I think Fireblocks is the back end for BNY Mellon, which is like, because that's also not a proper custody solution. It's just shitty because we feel like we're trying to do our jobs, and meanwhile, we're being forced to solutions that are either higher cost or lower security.
00:32:05.016 - 00:32:10.486, Speaker A: Is there any decentralized crypto native MPC solution out there?
00:32:10.588 - 00:32:16.850, Speaker D: Oh, there's terms, but they don't satisfy the know circulation.
00:32:16.930 - 00:32:23.690, Speaker C: Native decentralized MPC solution is not a qualified custodian. So ruled out just by default.
00:32:24.190 - 00:33:20.862, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting because look at it. The whole point of the SEC, right? And this is frankly, like, what they should be doing is to protect your grandma from swindlers who say, hey, invest $500 in this. The whole reason why hedge funds and RIAs are regulated in a totally different way is the philosophy. And thinking goes, if you have a bunch of money, and these are purportedly very sophisticated investors, we don't have to be as hands on and help. And if you lose your money, well, it's kind of tough shit. And there's a bit of, like a systemic thing where they don't want part of the reason they stipulate a qualified custodian is they don't want big systemic parts of the market to fall out. But I don't know if they've put out an official why they're proposing to do this or what the reason is behind it, but it's hard to see any other reason other than just choke off capital to crypto, make it more difficult for people that want to invest.
00:33:20.996 - 00:33:39.838, Speaker C: To mean, let's be serious. It's under the guise of, okay, SBF just ran away with how many billions of customer funds. They're trying to prevent that from happening again. And of course, everything is thrown. The baby is thrown out with bathwater here. But that's the reasoning.
00:33:40.014 - 00:33:40.740, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:43.030 - 00:34:06.460, Speaker D: We'Ll find a way to make it work because this is our job. The institutions like, picture a 29 year old analyst at Apollo who's trying to pitch crypto to a bunch of really old guys, and it's like, yeah, we can do this. It might make money. Very passionate about it. And they're like, Where do we put it's? Like, oh, yeah, that would make the firm in violation of SEC custody rules. Like, absolutely.
00:34:08.830 - 00:35:14.130, Speaker C: You know, is what it know. The thing that we started talking about here originally was, okay, this is one of the business lines that's been growing. This is one of the big opportunities for Coinbase. If this proposed rule goes in, does it change the outlook for Coinbase just based on the fact that this institutional prime product that they have and trading is one of the products within prime custody is obviously another one, does it change either the opportunity from a growth perspective or just like the margin that they have? The other thing, too, is if they have to go off and keep this in a different location or have to do this in a different way or they have to have a different insurance provider, does that actually change? The business model that they have where instead of charging 1520 bits on whenever assets are being held within prime, do they have to charge 50 now because their cost structure has changed? There are a lot of different perspective as to what could happen to the business. But this has been one of the shining lights, I would say, within Coinbase.
00:35:14.470 - 00:36:13.486, Speaker B: And the reason to your point, Michael, why this is so important is the general thinking on Wall Street is we've seen this play out before. Fees, especially in kind of a brokerage model, is a race to zero. So even though Coinbase is generating quite a bit of money from their fees today, their transaction revenue, which is for those of you who are following along on video, can kind of see up here, the thinking is that that's eventually going to go away and that's why there's so much emphasis on this bucket here. The subscription and services revenue, which is blockchain rewards, which is basically staking custodial fee revenue, interest income and this kind of other, which I guess is like earn. And their coinbase one subscription product. And honestly, just because we've been so nice to Coinbase here, this interest income is kind of a dubious grouping, frankly, within this bucket because I don't think interest income really that's definitely not a subscription type product. And it was a good hedge.
00:36:13.486 - 00:36:25.842, Speaker B: Like it's a good business decision, like their center consortium with circles paying off. But that shouldn't be getting a subscription type multiple, I don't think. To your point, that's the challenge.
00:36:25.906 - 00:36:26.182, Speaker A: Basically.
00:36:26.236 - 00:36:29.640, Speaker B: They've got big headwinds in this revenue bucket here.
00:36:30.350 - 00:36:31.098, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:31.264 - 00:36:46.254, Speaker D: If things get bullish again, they're going to be making so much money and everyone's turning a dime. So it is a little bit of feast or famine. But to Brian's point now, he's like an all weather stock, so kind of expect a little bit more.
00:36:46.452 - 00:37:34.562, Speaker B: Well, Jason made this joke at the opening here, but I actually just can't wait for the next earnings call and listening to the questions that these equity analysts have about just also go and take a look. You can go see the equity analysts that cover Coinbase. These guys have a decent understanding of what a brokerage model is or an exchange model. But as far as crypto, they have no idea how to value base. And by the way, this is a little bit of I talked to one of the analysts who worked like a big bulge bracket and they all kind of speak to each other. And the thing that they were excited about was the NFT. The reason why the analysts were bullish on Coinbase for a while was their NFT backlog.
00:37:34.562 - 00:37:50.354, Speaker B: Do you remember when they had like 2 million people or whatever signed up and that was what all the bankers were talking to each other about. They were like that's sign off, like bullish Coinbase. I just wouldn't listen. They're just not in the weeds enough.
00:37:50.392 - 00:37:52.420, Speaker D: To how old are these people?
00:37:53.110 - 00:37:57.000, Speaker B: You can look up by average age of 45, 50.
00:37:58.010 - 00:38:02.550, Speaker D: That's not going to work. Let's talk LSTs.
00:38:03.130 - 00:38:05.830, Speaker C: LSTs, LSTs.
00:38:06.890 - 00:38:09.270, Speaker A: What are we pivoting to liquid staking tokens?
00:38:10.510 - 00:38:14.650, Speaker D: Wait, we talk about always has been LSTs.
00:38:14.990 - 00:38:16.540, Speaker A: No derivative here.
00:38:17.470 - 00:38:52.840, Speaker D: I had this conversation with a company who I won't name, but it's this Asian company that has a bunch of ETH, a Bund or a CFI company, not going to say, but it's one or the other. Narrow it down for you. But they were like, yeah, we have like billions of ETH and we're starting our own liquid stake token. I was like, interesting, you're just going to start it? And they're like, yeah, it's an easy way to make money. We have a lot of ETH. It's just sitting there. We're going to go off, do different things with it.
00:38:52.840 - 00:39:30.434, Speaker D: So many people are going to do this where this is like another thing I saw last week was somebody forked rocket pool's code. I forget what the name of the project was. They got a bunch of shit on Twitter. They made the GitHub repo private in response. But their whole plan is basically like clone this LSD, make people deposit into it, give them tokens to do so, and then that's going to be their business model. The last time I saw this happen, this copy paste clone stuff was like during DeFi summer with the AMMS. Whenever you see people starting to copy paste stuff, that's a very strong signal that something is happening in the market.
00:39:30.434 - 00:39:48.994, Speaker D: And here's why. The lowest effort to make the most amount of money is where most of the capital will trend. And that is going to be a theme, I think, for a while. And Yearn's LST basket is playing right into this, which I think is pretty that's.
00:39:49.122 - 00:40:33.094, Speaker B: By the way, I want to bookmark this because that exact viewpoint I want to recycle for some of these new stable coins that are being issued. But I want to get your perspective on. Let's just talk about the urine basket in general. So could you guys give kind of an overview for sort of the uninitiating on how the vaults work? And then I think we've already kind of talked about Staking derivatives and who some of the big players are on the show. So I'm not really sure that it makes a lot of sense to go into detail there. But basically long and short of it is that this urine vault is kind of offering basket exposure to a whole bunch of different LSTs. So could you guys just go into the merits of that or why that might not make sense?
00:40:33.292 - 00:41:08.722, Speaker D: So let's imagine that there are 100 LST projects. Everyone has decided that copy paste clone LST projects is like the way to make money. All of these projects have tokens. All of these projects are willing to incentivize people adding ETH to their vaults with tokens. They're willing to incentivize more liquidity for their LSTs so on and so forth. Who is going to benefit from this? It's going to be people like Urine that are basically saying, all right, we're going to aggregate all the LSTs. We are going to make sure that they have price parity with one another.
00:41:08.722 - 00:42:07.780, Speaker D: We're going to get them distribution. And in return, you're going to give all the tokens you're planning on distributing to people, to us. US in two senses, us in the sense of just ape your LST into this yeast protocol and we'll distribute the tokens and also tokens will go back to Wi Fi holders. The Wi Fi model really worked well when there was a ton of different stablecoins in DeFi summer, and people were trying to get leverage and trying to get borrow and trying to get price parity for their stablecoin once the market really consolidated. Urine was one of the main people who just kind know, had a negative impact from but like, the explosion of the many different types of LSTs is exactly when there was like 100 different types of stablecoins and people were being willing to pay tokens just to get their stablecoin into consideration. So I think it's like a really interesting move. And they also have a bunch of curve and ve curve, which they can vote to increase curve emissions, which is another source of yield for them.
00:42:07.780 - 00:42:14.470, Speaker D: This is happening in my mind, like the LST summer, whatever you want to call it, but this is going to be a trend.
00:42:15.690 - 00:42:33.246, Speaker C: Do you not disagree with LST summer? The one thing that I will say, though, is that the other thing that happened when everybody started to copy pasta everybody else's code base, is that we got absolutely blown up in certain situations. I don't know if you remember, Vance, but like Yam and Yeem, I was.
00:42:33.268 - 00:42:35.134, Speaker A: About to say, yeah, we were off.
00:42:35.172 - 00:42:37.226, Speaker D: By like 18 orders of magnitude in the math.
00:42:37.258 - 00:42:42.954, Speaker C: Sorry, there were 18 zeros extra added to subcalculation.
00:42:43.002 - 00:42:47.074, Speaker D: I remember it on ether scan just like, running over the bar. It was like the whole screen.
00:42:47.272 - 00:42:49.858, Speaker B: But the problem that you're going to.
00:42:49.864 - 00:43:35.666, Speaker C: Run into is like, okay, sure, there's going to be a basket of products if you yield, there's going to be a basket that maybe you're farming whatever the native token is of that one specific LST, and that's giving you additional yield. But if that doesn't have any value, there's going to be a linear effect, and there's going to be a different model here, which is it kind of goes back to what is the top one, two, maybe three different LSTs. And there is going to be a consolidation of that when everybody starts to realize, okay, the inflationary rewards that are put out by the 20th LST, we're farming those, we're dumping those. But it's only going to last for so long until you have some differentiated edge, maybe. But unless you can get into that.
00:43:35.688 - 00:43:37.778, Speaker B: Top one, two, three, it's going to.
00:43:37.784 - 00:43:44.162, Speaker C: Be really hard to say that the value is not going to eventually aggregate around whoever is top dog.
00:43:44.296 - 00:44:09.034, Speaker D: Totally. That's like a 2024 question, though. We're going to do just like, craziness of something like DFI summer, because when you have this and then you have Eigen layer, which is just like more combinatorial forms of yield, people are going to be putting their ETH in such strange places and some of them will never get it back. But there's going to be this fervor around the speculative nature of these know.
00:44:09.072 - 00:44:30.770, Speaker B: One of the things that this reminds me of, just this psychological urge that you're talking about, Vance, is I heard some quote a little while ago, it was about Amazon. It was like, more money has been lost chasing the next Amazon. If they had just basically it was like, just invest in Amazon. Don't try to chase the next Amazon. But it's this thing that it's an urge that a lot of people have when they're sort of new to something.
00:44:30.840 - 00:44:31.314, Speaker D: Right?
00:44:31.432 - 00:44:46.680, Speaker B: We've joked about it like first bags. But the reason I kind of get it is when I first came, I had a similar psychological reaction to everyone else. I was watching Bitcoin go from like three to 20. I was like, all right, I've already missed that. So what's the next thing that I can buy that's going to do that?
00:44:48.750 - 00:44:51.670, Speaker A: And it was cheap bitcoin, which was litecoin.
00:44:51.830 - 00:45:04.960, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that was literally it. And I was like, oh, it's faster. Yeah. And I've seen that reaction replicated across so many people. And listen, you could tell people they won't listen.
00:45:06.610 - 00:45:26.162, Speaker D: Finance either. It's music. You don't want to listen to someone popular. You want to find your own thing. It's like everything. There's a market for being new, but with finance, it's different because I think the primary market that you're trying to serve is people are trying to make it. They're like, I can't make it with Lido, I can't make it with rocket pool.
00:45:26.226 - 00:45:27.302, Speaker B: Those will take ten years.
00:45:27.356 - 00:45:34.454, Speaker D: I need to make it in one year. How can I get there? It's like, well, you need to stake your ETH in some strange place so it might not get it back.
00:45:34.652 - 00:46:36.106, Speaker C: What I was actually going to say is this is like one of the biggest pitfalls that I think we're going to start to see a lot more of in venture capital, which is that everybody just goes off and finds nesting because it's valued at like 2030, 40, $50 million when they're doing around versus actually betting on the number one and the industry leader, which may be valued at like a billion, but at the same time, because of the market leader, because they're number one. They're going to actually have the venture scale outcome versus the other one who hasn't even launched yet. And because they have a similar model, but they're 20 times less expensive, that's going to be the best opportunity. I think you're going to start to see a lot of this in the venture world where people are taking shots at whoever is the market leader. Because it used to be that you should be in the top five, you'd be in the top seven, maybe even top ten and still have like a venture outcome. But what we're going to start to see is that it's going to be top one, maybe two that have the venture outcome opportunities. Yeah.
00:46:36.208 - 00:46:50.526, Speaker B: Power loss. Power loss. So basically just to get your kind of summation about this not super bullish on these vault broad index exposure thing to LSTs because no who are the.
00:46:50.548 - 00:47:28.474, Speaker D: Winners when the dust clears? Probably the biggest ones still continue to win in general, just because DeFi summer is what brought Stablecoins on chain. That was the only thing that made that happen. This is going to be the same thing where ETH is going to leave the centralized exchanges. ETH is going to be bought by people who want to get this weird combinatorial yield, but other than that there's probably going to be a market for a super aggressive, almost magic internet money style like Daniel ST's playbook. And I think we're just like seeing that with Fracs, but there's not a ton of spots for people.
00:47:28.672 - 00:47:54.610, Speaker C: I think it really depends on the time horizon we're talking about over the next twelve months. I truly believe that we could see LST summer and there's just going to be so much tension brought into Staking as soon as Shanghai goes in and derisking that there's going to be institutional Staking options, there's going to be hedge fund products around Staking that all of that becomes a massive opportunity. But let's be serious, over the next two to three years it's probably going to be something that aggregates back to the winners.
00:47:55.510 - 00:47:58.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's fair.
00:47:58.890 - 00:49:04.026, Speaker D: The other summer trend, maybe not summer, maybe fall, maybe winter, I don't know. But the other one that I think is really interesting, and I was just messing around with this last couple of weeks, and I'm not sure how I feel about Blur, but I can go on Blur right now and buy, like, one to two to 3% of an NFT collection. And I can also sell one to two to 3% of an NFT collection. And that fundamentally changes at least how I think about NFTs because the last thing that I want is to buy an asset that tracks ETH where there's just no liquidity, where you buy it and then the liquidity portal closes behind you and you're waiting for Sothby's or someone to auction off your collection at a block sale. If you can trade NFTs like coins and you see Blur having a lot of the liquidity, you see things like Nftx which have your ability to fractionalize and sell and borrow against things. It feels like slowly the pieces of the puzzle for NFT phi summer or fall or whatever are starting to fall into place. That is another one that I think is pretty interesting.
00:49:04.026 - 00:49:20.734, Speaker D: And the other interesting part about it is almost by definition, it has to happen on ETH l one. All the attempts by L two S by side chains, by other L1s to create a meaningful NFT market have totally failed. Like, nine of the ten NFT projects on Polygon are actually phishing scams right now.
00:49:20.932 - 00:49:22.080, Speaker B: Why is that?
00:49:23.570 - 00:49:50.046, Speaker D: Probably something about the user base that's there and people's desire to prey on them, which is like the ETH l one, it feels like a little bit more of a whale and a little bit more of an educated person's game. But people think that, okay, the L two S are going to cannibalize all the L1 fees, maybe on the DFI side, the NFT side, especially with things like Blur that's staying on L One forever.
00:49:50.178 - 00:49:55.050, Speaker A: I've got a couple sorry, I don't fully follow that. Vance why couldn't that go to Arbitrum or optimism?
00:49:56.190 - 00:50:20.980, Speaker D: It could. Why hasn't it? There's something about the ETH block space, about the provenance of the block space, about honestly, and I've talked to NFT projects and collectors about this. They kind of like how expensive the gas fees are. It tells them that, okay, this isn't moving anywhere. The blockchain is secure. If you're paying a penny for a painting on Polygon, do you want to hang that in your house? I don't know.
00:50:21.670 - 00:50:25.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually kind of weirdly get that it actually slows the liquidity a.
00:50:25.560 - 00:50:29.640, Speaker A: Bit, which is like good for collectors markets, right? Yeah.
00:50:32.090 - 00:50:55.470, Speaker B: I have a Blur specific question for you. So I saw this statistic. I'm going to get these exact numbers right? But the kind of order of magnitude is, I think, roughly directionally correct. It was like the average transaction value on Openc is something like five or $750. And Blur was like five or six times that. So maybe it was around four grand or something like that. And that was being touted as a good thing.
00:50:55.470 - 00:50:58.746, Speaker B: Right. Obviously that factors into the way that they generate revenue.
00:50:58.778 - 00:50:58.974, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:59.012 - 00:51:37.020, Speaker B: Average transaction value volume. The question that I had, though, just trying to put a narrative around that or think why that might be, is it seems like there's kind of like that hotball of money that CMS talks about. That's roughly my mental model for how NFTs work right now. There's just this kind of hotball of money in NFT land that is like these whales or people who get in early or connected and they're kind of just rotating. And it seems like that's what Blur kind of won, right? Like they took that group of people. And my question to you is a, do you agree with that narrative? And B, is that a good thing? Is that the customer base that they want to build their business on?
00:51:40.190 - 00:52:43.486, Speaker D: Blur has its own problems, for sure. Like 500 traders make up about 60 70% of volume. They're incentivizing the shit out of liquidity with so many tokens and there's $300 million of tokens that are hitting the market, I guess, when the next season launches in March 15. So we'll see how liquid the bids on these NFTs are fundamentally. But it almost feels like they've cultivated this group of NFT market makers that didn't exist before who are willing to take directional risk on. And like prior to this, the only way that I've heard of market making NFTs is basically setting an automated program where if somebody fat finger sells a crypto punk below the floor, you buy it, relist it at the floor and then hope someone picks it up. If you can actually make a liquid market for these things and they become more of like the altcoin with picture Thesis, that totally changes the dynamics of the NFT market and it'll kill some categories of NFTs like it'll.
00:52:43.486 - 00:53:19.146, Speaker D: Probably kill the profile picture ones, but it'll probably do wonders for the long tail of NFTs as well that are probably less costly, less expensive. But it feels like the market that blur won't penetrate are things like Fidenzas that is just so much directional risk to take on something that literally has no cash flows or quantifiable value and so it will be uneven. I still think OpenSea and Sotheby's will come to dominate the art collector market. But the PFP market feels less important now and games and longer tail NFTs feel more important.
00:53:19.328 - 00:53:46.900, Speaker B: Yeah, it is just funny. It does feel like there's like two markets in NFTs. There's the all coin with pictures market and the Sotheby's kind of market. And one thing I feel like I used to hear OpenSea say a lot is their strategy as I understood it. That's why they had protection for royalties because they wanted to control the supply, right, basically of creators. They wanted to get them to list on OpenSea. But I think this is the Bill Burley thing.
00:53:46.900 - 00:54:23.086, Speaker B: In years of funding and building marketplace based businesses, I can definitively tell you that it is better to control the demand side. And I do sort of think a lot of investing arguments in crypto have, maybe because of the Bitcoin heritage, have a natural supply side kind of bent to them. They're like we're going to create stuff that's really scarce. Whereas I think if we're doing a scoreboard here for outsized returns outside of crypto, controlling the demand side is much more important. So maybe that's like a way that you could sort of see blur versus maybe that's how the NFT market gets.
00:54:23.108 - 00:54:24.320, Speaker C: Split a little bit.
00:54:25.190 - 00:54:31.438, Speaker D: I think of it also as like the mashup of those of demand and supply, which is like are you the price discovery venue?
00:54:31.614 - 00:54:32.340, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:32.710 - 00:55:25.522, Speaker D: And once you lose Michael, remember when we used to trade before framework on Vidrex? That was the price discovery venue. And then all of a sudden it wasn't, and it completely lost relevance. Even if you have 1% of the customers of Openc, if you become the liquidity venue and be that through tokens or a better programmatic API to trade through, it's going to be difficult for people who trade NFT size to ever go back to Openc. Look at the other side, guys. I forget who it was. Two guys sold $10 million of board apes into the Blur bid, and the floor didn't move at all. If you own serious amounts of NFTs, there's only one venue that you can now trade on, and we'll see how the token does and how the bids persist.
00:55:25.522 - 00:55:40.506, Speaker D: But what if instead of crashing, blur gets ten times bigger from a token price perspective? Now, Openc would need to strategically launch a token to then get back to being the price discovery venue, but I.
00:55:40.528 - 00:55:41.660, Speaker C: Don'T think they can.
00:55:42.190 - 00:55:47.674, Speaker D: Right, but at a certain point, burning down fully and you need to start.
00:55:47.712 - 00:56:14.834, Speaker C: To put it out. I mean, maybe they can, maybe they can. I don't know. I would just say they're very much situated in the camp of Delaware c Corp. United States Corporation not going to be able to launch a token, just like not within the wheelhouse corporate structuring that they put in place to the tune of $13 billion. So how do you rate that ship? I don't know. Maybe like Hail Mary type move.
00:56:14.834 - 00:56:20.046, Speaker C: You got to do it. You can, but it would be pretty disastrous, I would imagine.
00:56:20.158 - 00:56:23.538, Speaker A: Do you think Open Sea is in Hail Mary mode with the $13 billion valuation?
00:56:23.634 - 00:56:41.580, Speaker C: No, I didn't mean that at all. I meant if Vance's prediction of Blur going up ten X as opposed to crashing ten X at that point, you kind of have to call the question, like every single savior cow that you have, do you have to change your entire model?
00:56:44.930 - 00:56:46.446, Speaker B: Jason, you have more questions?
00:56:46.628 - 00:56:48.110, Speaker A: No, just leaning forward.
00:56:48.260 - 00:57:10.040, Speaker D: And one last thing I would say is what would be the retrospective on Uniswap versus SushiSwap? Like, if Uniswap could do it over, would they say that launching the token when they did save them or didn't save them? I think it's kind of hard to tell. But SushiSwap wasn't just going to go away. That wasn't like a problem that would have solved itself. It would have gotten worse, not better.
00:57:11.290 - 00:57:13.000, Speaker B: I think you're right about that.
00:57:14.570 - 00:57:23.980, Speaker C: I would be really interested to hear the complete backroom perspective on whether or not launching Uni and Uniswap token was the right call.
00:57:24.510 - 00:57:26.220, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it was.
00:57:27.550 - 00:57:28.300, Speaker C: Really.
00:57:29.310 - 00:57:43.440, Speaker D: I mean, what was the cost of them? They got a lot more. They got like a $6 billion market cap token and won the war. Kind of. Whatever the counterfactual is, the ends have justified the means at this point in my mind.
00:57:43.970 - 00:58:00.530, Speaker C: I understand that, but I guess I would say raising $125,000,000 to go off in a centralized direction, which seems to be putting. The uni token at a lower standard than what they're now focused on would suggest that they have deprioritized the unit token.
00:58:00.950 - 00:58:10.540, Speaker D: I think you could see Openc follow the same playbook where they're like, we're going to have the token and we're also going to have a wallet that we monetize have your cake and eat it too.
00:58:10.990 - 00:58:13.580, Speaker B: Depends on how successful it doesn't really.
00:58:20.370 - 00:58:39.300, Speaker C: You go last thought. I guess I would wonder whether or not Uniswap Incorporated or whatever the company is called versus Openc Incorporated has better chance of going public because that's what you have to be playing for if you put $100 million into something. Right.
00:58:40.950 - 00:59:01.482, Speaker D: I think Coinbase is like a public company has been such a gong show that it's hard to see what the path for them would be. Coinbase is like this incredible business with a bunch of different revenue streams. If you're just selling, like, I don't know if that clears the public market hurdle of is this a good business? Especially at this point in time?
00:59:01.616 - 00:59:03.658, Speaker C: At this point in time, hard to say.
00:59:03.824 - 00:59:06.246, Speaker B: I mean, more you're just selling NFTs.
00:59:06.278 - 00:59:22.794, Speaker A: In the way that people think about NFTs today. Not like, hey, ebay big company just selling collectibles on this marketplace. Next cycle, I think we're in the depths of a bear. We got to remember. Yep, you're right. Cycle NFTs are like digital collectibles that every big brand in the world has launched.
00:59:22.842 - 00:59:23.546, Speaker C: Like, boom.
00:59:23.578 - 00:59:27.940, Speaker A: Now you own the marketplace where digital collectibles trade public company.
00:59:28.310 - 00:59:37.480, Speaker C: Right, but my point is whether or not OpenSea without a token or uniswap with a token is going to have a better chance of getting past the SEC to go public.
00:59:39.050 - 00:59:40.200, Speaker D: That's a good point.
00:59:40.810 - 01:00:31.250, Speaker B: It's a good point. It also is just like there's a weird internal conflict of interest where it's like, which instrument are we concerned about? Value accruing to that is like, I think could be confusing as well. But I want to get your guys opinion on something else because this dynamic that you're talking about, like people piling into the new kind of like we're in a bear market right now, right? So lots of companies during a bear market, they kind of converge on what's working. Right? It's like what is working right now? Like liquid staking derivatives NFT marketplaces and Stablecoins. Right? So there are like the Fiat collateralized stablecoins, like Tether, USDC. Then there's kind of a slew of decentralized stables. Like there's Dai and you can debate about how decentralized that really is, but then there's this new wave of stables.
01:00:31.250 - 01:00:38.658, Speaker B: There's go from Aave. There's Curve that they've indicated that they're.
01:00:38.674 - 01:00:39.810, Speaker A: Launching their own staple.
01:00:39.890 - 01:01:18.334, Speaker B: And I've heard of two more that haven't launched. But I want you guys to tell me why I'm wrong here. I really don't think that that's a good idea, to be honest. And here's why. Because in general, if you look at and I don't mean to pick on anyone here, but go as a business model. What they're doing is they're a borrow lend protocol, right? They have a bunch of assets on their platform that may or may not be liabilities, depending on how you view the contract kind of nature there, but they make money on that spread. And then if you think about it from a capital structure standpoint, there's like the customer deposits here and then there's the Ave Token.
01:01:18.334 - 01:01:54.800, Speaker B: That's a backstop, right, in the case of an exploit, right? So that's what you have when you're holding the Ave token. Them being like, we're just going to launch Go, right? And we can give you cheaper cost of capital and all that kind of stuff. And it's going to be this new revenue stream. In my mind, that's a new liability stream. That's an encumbrance on that token, right? That's how I kind of view it. And the analog that I have is like, what's the future of this? Just each DeFi protocol has their own stablecoin, like we had in the Wild West where each bank had their own currency and then they all.
01:01:57.010 - 01:01:57.966, Speaker D: I'm not.
01:01:57.988 - 01:02:21.834, Speaker B: To be a doomsayer, but these protocols could default. They're super over collateralized and safe now. But it's right there. That's what abe is, right? It's the backstop. And there could be a spiral there where if your liabilities exceed your equity, that could be bad. So am I totally wrong in my framework for thinking about this? I personally would like you're going to be a stablecoin issuer. That's like all I want you to do.
01:02:21.872 - 01:03:07.282, Speaker D: Basically, it's no more risky than Dai. Honestly, if you look at the Curve construction or the Aave construction, it's like, all right, we're going to start with ETH collateral, we're going to mint this token against it, and we're going to spit incentives into curve pools and uniswap to peg. It kind of how Dai works. It's less lindy, but if it depegs, theoretically, if it's backed by good collateral, it should be something that we would buy and just are the difference out? I think what you're seeing is just like lending protocols. I'm looking at Ave right now, $9.4 million of annualized revenue, I think like 10% or so flows to the token. That's just not enough to generate a multibillion dollar outcome.
01:03:07.282 - 01:03:33.722, Speaker D: And maybe in the bear market it's like five or ten times higher, but still then it's pretty challenging. You just need to stable on more aspects to your business. And if one of your competitors can mint a stablecoin for free and you have to draw a USDC off chain to on chain and then put it in your platform, you're at a disadvantage. And so all of this should be construed as these curve and Ave taking shots at Maker and wanting us.
01:03:33.876 - 01:03:54.438, Speaker C: Do you guys remember, I don't know, maybe it was like 2017, 2018 when Snapchat came out with stories and then Instagram copied them and then every single platform on the Internet had their own Stories product LinkedIn. Everyone was like, oh, we can do that too.
01:03:54.524 - 01:03:55.574, Speaker B: Oh, we can do that.
01:03:55.692 - 01:03:58.378, Speaker C: I remember seeing a Stories bar across.
01:03:58.464 - 01:04:05.498, Speaker B: Like it was Photoshopped, obviously, but like an Excel file, it does feel a.
01:04:05.504 - 01:04:13.100, Speaker C: Little bit like that where, oh, we can do that too. Like, oh, cost us nothing. Does it get us more users? Maybe we'll find out.
01:04:13.470 - 01:04:18.846, Speaker D: Yeah, once they start to dabble in long tail collateral, that's when you know.
01:04:18.868 - 01:04:19.674, Speaker C: The game has changed.
01:04:19.722 - 01:04:23.380, Speaker D: And if you want to start shorting the stablecoin, that's when you start doing that.
01:04:23.990 - 01:04:24.740, Speaker B: Okay.
01:04:25.270 - 01:04:26.420, Speaker D: To start with.
01:04:28.710 - 01:05:42.694, Speaker B: Okay, there was an interesting so this comes from here, let me actually get the link so I can make sure that I'm not spewing FUD here, but this is a part of a proposal for makers. So this is a part of makers endgame, which is the that's the plan from Rune Christensen, the founder. I don't know if you guys can see my screen here, but basically one of the tenants that was kind of buried that I didn't notice and I saw someone tweet out about it, is that you can now leverage your maker token, which is kind of like the equity in the network to borrow Die. And that to me is again, I don't mean to be like doomsday, but that's a similar construction to I mean, collateralizing the stablecoin with the network equity is what got Terra into all that trouble. And before then it was Enron that collateralized their loan obligations with Enron stock. It's like when that unwinds, it just happens very quickly. So I think you're right, but I want to bring this back to something.
01:05:42.694 - 01:06:20.200, Speaker B: I think two years ago that when he first said it, I really disagreed with, but now I kind of agree. You know that saying like, you're at the mercy of your stupidest competitor? It's like your competitor is going to do non economic decisions. Like you have to respond to position yourself, otherwise you're going to get smoked. I used to believe that. But now we just watched all the people that made dumb decisions get washed out so aggressively that I do kind of think there's some merit to making choices that you think are economic or viable or whatever in the long term and not just constantly counter positioning with stuff that also doesn't necessarily make sense.
01:06:20.970 - 01:06:29.960, Speaker C: Do you have an opinion on that? Totally understand where you're coming from. I do think that there's a difference in DeFi and that it really does depend on the mechanism that you're talking about.
01:06:30.890 - 01:06:32.234, Speaker B: Do I want to put up my.
01:06:32.272 - 01:07:05.726, Speaker C: Maker tokens to be able to draw Die against it? I could view that as being the exact same proposition as putting up my ETH or like Blink or any other asset. It's just another asset. And sure, maker has value and therefore I want to be able to borrow against it. On the flip side, or not. Flip side on an additional point, there is a mechanism that has survived two bear markets at this point with the exact same description that you're describing here, which is Synthetics. And we're an investor in it. Synthetics has been able to use and they're changing the token economics.
01:07:05.726 - 01:07:12.390, Speaker C: They're launching. V three. There's going to be a bunch of people talking about it at E Denver in a couple of weeks and moving.
01:07:12.460 - 01:07:13.794, Speaker B: Past this model directly.
01:07:13.842 - 01:07:47.310, Speaker C: But for the past four years, three years, they have been using SNX, the core asset, as the collateral backstop for the entire ecosystem. And it once again really depends on the collateralization ratio, the mechanism for liquidation, like how you actually process that. And they've run into issues. They've solved those issues. But I think it all depends on the details. And yes there will be people that blow themselves up like Terra and Doe but there will also be others that have strong mechanisms and strong mechanisms.
01:07:49.970 - 01:08:29.166, Speaker D: Just depends how big it is. If it's big it could be a big problem. There's 10 billion of Maker stakes against the stablecoin. Maker is not that liquid either. Michael and I both know that you can get really badly hurt if you have 10 billion of collateralization and you have five billions of stable coins and all of a sudden half of your supply is under collateralized. Luna really incentivized this to happen. So I don't think that'll happen at Maker but this is kind of when you start flirting with the danger zone know using your own asset as collateral which can create these destabilizing feedback loops which is not good.
01:08:29.348 - 01:08:31.390, Speaker A: I don't like it. I think it's a horrible idea.
01:08:31.460 - 01:08:31.658, Speaker B: It's.
01:08:31.674 - 01:08:49.510, Speaker A: Like, why do it? I think Maker struggles. Maker struggles from the this. Like, I don't think maker has decided still what it wants to be, and this feels like another step in that direction of, like, I don't know. Do you want to be this super secure platform, or do you want to take risks and grow at all costs?
01:08:50.490 - 01:09:12.414, Speaker B: I think it has decided what it wants to be. They've gone with the end game there was an internal battle between hasu to be like some sort of he described it like the euro dollar kind of shadow banking system and then there was this endgame Phoenix scenario where maker deep die deep as the inevitable thing.
01:09:12.452 - 01:09:25.246, Speaker C: I mean back to you why do it if you were to beard to steal me on this why would you put maker as a collateral asset? I don't think you should right you.
01:09:25.268 - 01:09:26.590, Speaker A: Allow me to make the argument that.
01:09:26.660 - 01:09:29.534, Speaker D: We shouldn't answer so that arrow against his maker.
01:09:29.582 - 01:09:34.526, Speaker C: Yeah I was about to say that every single maker employee can use their assets as collateral.
01:09:34.638 - 01:09:36.370, Speaker D: I too would like free leverage.
01:09:38.730 - 01:09:56.214, Speaker B: All right so you know what is a funny do you guys catch I'll actually try to find the link to this proposal but within Maker the end game. There was a proposal for Maker the Dow to buy Rune's personal stake in Lido.
01:09:56.342 - 01:09:58.700, Speaker A: Do you remember that? That's so.
01:10:01.410 - 01:10:04.270, Speaker B: I pose that you buy my bag.
01:10:06.050 - 01:10:13.210, Speaker D: It's only been a minute since I've seen Rune. He feels like he's in the shadow somewhere.
01:10:13.290 - 01:10:17.314, Speaker A: I heard him on a pod. He was sounding kind of wonky remember.
01:10:17.352 - 01:10:26.370, Speaker D: When he's trying to donate 20,000 maker to some woke cause. That is more Maker than the protocol has burned in its entire lifetime. Yeah, dad.
01:10:27.290 - 01:10:54.814, Speaker B: All right. I've got another one for you. This is also part of the end game, but there's a proposal for something called scientific. It's like scientific sustainability. So he wants to create a scientific sustainability fund, something to the tune of 20,000 MKR. If you want an understanding of how to run a professional global scale grift, look no further than the ESG business. Right.
01:10:54.814 - 01:11:14.610, Speaker B: Which is probably the most successful game in town right now. And there's a whole industry around how to siphon know investment and funds and direct flows capital. There are a couple of instances of this is all I'm going to say. So yeah. Not throwing any. I don't want to get Yano in trouble. He's a maker.
01:11:16.070 - 01:11:19.560, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. Your day grip from you.
01:11:22.730 - 01:11:33.610, Speaker B: I like this. I like this. In fact, I would like to propose a Yanowitz sustainability fund to the bags.
01:11:34.030 - 01:11:36.860, Speaker C: Can you borrow against delegated stake or no?
01:11:37.790 - 01:11:40.766, Speaker A: Yeah, with this you could. Oh, yeah.
01:11:40.788 - 01:11:46.990, Speaker D: No, you can. That's part of wow. So a little something for the delegates too. That's nice.
01:11:47.140 - 01:11:47.840, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:48.850 - 01:11:52.234, Speaker B: It's almost like you're kicking something to your friends. Kick.
01:11:52.282 - 01:12:13.750, Speaker A: There should be a word. Also, if you look at all the delegates, you can look at where the delegates get their maker from. Most of the big delegates get their maker from Rune. So there's this thing inside of Maker where you don't want to just vote how Rune wants you to vote. But also Rune has given you all your money, all your voting tokens.
01:12:16.090 - 01:12:16.770, Speaker C: Governance.
01:12:16.850 - 01:12:19.954, Speaker B: Inside baseball here public.
01:12:20.092 - 01:12:21.466, Speaker A: You can go see it. Yeah.
01:12:21.648 - 01:12:28.170, Speaker D: All this going on, I'm not going to be surprised if Go or Curve USD takes a meaningful chunk out of Maker.
01:12:29.470 - 01:12:35.006, Speaker B: You know, it would be an interesting product, by the way. I don't know if this is possible. Can you see? You should theoretically. I don't think so.
01:12:35.028 - 01:12:52.530, Speaker A: Band, you want a stablecoin that's been battle tested and Die has been battle tested through the absolute depths of the bear market, including Flash Crash March 2020. Makers risk team is also phenomenal. Yeah, that's fair.
01:12:52.600 - 01:12:54.498, Speaker D: And the steakhouse are great too.
01:12:54.584 - 01:12:55.362, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
01:12:55.496 - 01:12:56.900, Speaker D: Infrastructure there.
01:12:57.430 - 01:13:03.400, Speaker A: I agree that I don't like this, but I wouldn't go so far as to be like, oh, like aave stablecoin is going to eat a significant chunk out of.
01:13:05.690 - 01:13:11.082, Speaker D: Dai. When I borrow dai, I sell it immediately. I get USDC. Yeah.
01:13:11.136 - 01:13:22.634, Speaker C: That is how I did see two pitches this week for new stablecoin projects. There are at least neither of them.
01:13:22.752 - 01:13:23.900, Speaker D: Nothing happens.
01:13:27.570 - 01:13:29.610, Speaker B: We'll see neither of them are decentralized.
01:13:29.690 - 01:13:40.622, Speaker C: Or really kind of the same thing that we're talking about here. But there is at least some desire to move in the direction of finding new stablecoin projects, how you get distribution.
01:13:40.686 - 01:13:43.342, Speaker B: How you get adoption from NCPC.
01:13:43.486 - 01:13:45.534, Speaker C: But you have to do something differentiated.
01:13:45.662 - 01:13:46.754, Speaker D: I don't think it's going to be.
01:13:46.792 - 01:13:51.430, Speaker C: Like, let's just put stories on Aave and curve.
01:13:52.170 - 01:14:21.358, Speaker B: I will say if we're deciding, like taking micro out of the equation and deciding between curve and Ave, I would put my hat in the curve ring for that. Just because the power of the gauge and I think when it comes to currency liquidity is kind of the ultra that you worship at and it is a little bit of like Amazon pushing your own products type deal. But to be honest, that strategy works. That's an interesting stable to watch, I.
01:14:21.364 - 01:14:22.400, Speaker C: Would say, as well.
01:14:23.330 - 01:14:25.054, Speaker A: All right, fellas, think we got a wrap here.
01:14:25.092 - 01:14:25.900, Speaker B: This is a fun one, though.
