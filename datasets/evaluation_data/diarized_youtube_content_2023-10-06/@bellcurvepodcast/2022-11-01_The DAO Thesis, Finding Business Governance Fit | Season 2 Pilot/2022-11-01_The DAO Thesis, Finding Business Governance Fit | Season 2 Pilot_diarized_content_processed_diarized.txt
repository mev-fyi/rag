00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.640, Speaker A: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:10.850 - 00:00:14.750, Speaker B: All right, buddy. We are back. Season two. Ready to kick this thing off.
00:00:14.820 - 00:00:19.818, Speaker A: We are back. I'm super excited about season two. Yeah, season one was fun, but this is, this is where it really gets exciting.
00:00:19.914 - 00:00:34.520, Speaker B: Me too. You know why I'm excited about this? We, we tackled a pretty big concept here. Pretty big topic within crypto. And you just know we're sitting in the depths of a bear market because it was very hard to find anyone who had many positive things to say about it.
00:00:35.050 - 00:00:43.130, Speaker A: Yeah, not too many people wanted to join this season. I'll tell you, it's a little harder to get guests for this season than last season. That's how you know we're in the depths of the bear.
00:00:43.470 - 00:01:06.546, Speaker B: It was more just like we do a bunch of research before these seasons. We ask a whole bunch of people, hey, this is roughly what we're thinking. Does this make a lot of sense to you? And even the difference between season one and season two. Season one, people were willing to talk, people were excited, hey, I think this is going to work here's, this problem. But I'm super bullish long term on the future. Talking to people about this season was just like, yeah, this isn't working. This isn't working.
00:01:06.546 - 00:01:10.546, Speaker B: Hard to see any advantages to it. Yeah, I really recommend you don't dig.
00:01:10.568 - 00:01:31.346, Speaker A: Into that topic too deeply. Pretty bearish overall on the topic, but we are both bullish on the topic. We are both excited about it. I think you and I are feeling like, yeah, we're in the depths of the bear. But talking about this topic is important because it will be big in the next twelve to 18 months when the cycle returns. So I'm excited about it. So what are we talking about this season?
00:01:31.458 - 00:01:37.818, Speaker B: Okay, so season three is all about governance and we're going to be season two, season two, season Jesus, season two.
00:01:37.904 - 00:01:39.514, Speaker A: Season two, and go straight to season three.
00:01:39.552 - 00:02:20.678, Speaker B: Honestly? Honestly. All right. So season two is all about governance. To borrow a phrase from the first guest, actually of the show. Basically the thesis of season two is business governance fit. So dows are basically the subject here and we're going to be basically evaluating at a high level, when is it appropriate to be a dow, what type of advantages do being a Dow and that governance structure confer onto your organization and when should you be a Dow as opposed to a company? And we can break down this thesis into three different arguments, which is one, you need to find business governance fit. So there are different types of organizations out there and it makes sense to have different types of governance for each one of those organizations.
00:02:20.678 - 00:02:54.350, Speaker B: Two, most of the dows out there that exist today basically resemble a kind of a mix between a private and a public for profit company. And therefore we should be using corporate governance as our overarching thought process for these things, for how to govern these things. And three, at the end of the day, the advantages of a Dow differ depending on how mature the organization is. In the beginning, the advantages of being a Dow as opposed to a company have to do with distribution and the community. And at the end of the day, when a Dow is mature, it will be dependability. So that's the overarching thesis of the season.
00:02:54.430 - 00:03:10.262, Speaker A: Let me pick into a couple of those because I want to better understand this and pull some of this stuff out. So the first one, you said Dows are one solution to the problem of business governance fit. Can you tell me just a couple of different types of organizations and what that actually looks like in maybe the non crypto world?
00:03:10.396 - 00:03:56.146, Speaker B: Yep. So we're going to get into this in episode one with Hasu and Chris. But the way that Chris breaks it up in his piece, which we'll link in the show notes here, is there's almost a two by two matrix of different types of organizations and public and private and profit and nonprofit. And you can see examples of some of the different types of organizations, right? So nonprofit organizations, you have charities, hospitals, things like that. And then in for profit organizations you have companies, right? Like Meta or Apple or whatever. I think the simpler way to understand for me is actually if you look at governments versus corporations, right? Because I think that's things that people understand. So if you're a Milton Friedman advocate or disciple, then you know that the point of a corporation is to maximize shareholder value and typically that refers to producing more profits.
00:03:56.146 - 00:04:22.234, Speaker B: Right. That is the stated goal of a company. So you can look at every decision that a company makes through the lens of trying to achieve that objective of generating outsized returns and profits. A government is very different. Right. You don't really have shareholders in the sense that a company does. And typically what a government is trying to do is kind of at a large level organize society in a way that's beneficial for the users of the country, which are its citizens.
00:04:22.234 - 00:04:25.526, Speaker B: Very, very different things. There's no profit to generate.
00:04:25.578 - 00:04:25.746, Speaker A: Really.
00:04:25.768 - 00:04:58.698, Speaker B: What you're trying to do is raise, basically maintain a good enough lifestyle for each one of your citizens so that they can keep voting you into power. Very, very different end states almost at a philosophical level. As such, we have very different governance for a country, for the United States as opposed to a corporation. Right? In a corporation, we have very distinct sets of understood stakeholders. We've got our board of directors, we've got our managers, we've got our investors, we've got our users. In the government, it's very different. Even within the United States government.
00:04:58.698 - 00:05:33.654, Speaker B: We have different organizations based on what that branch of government has to do. We've got judicial, legislative, executive, executive, very top down autocratic type design, right, which is optimized for fast decision making in the legislative branch because so many of the laws that get passed by there impact the lives of each of its citizens. It's far more distributed. It's far more decentralized. And finally, we have the forward thinking, long term decision making, which is the judiciary part of the government, and that is appointed by the executive branch. And they are for life, which allows them to think very, very long term. Right.
00:05:33.654 - 00:05:52.250, Speaker B: And not necessarily be subject to the whims of the mob and the public or making good decisions on a quarter over quarter basis so that they can keep their jobs. So even if you look at the United States purely as a governance example, you can see different forms of governance for what each part of the government needs to do, right?
00:05:52.320 - 00:06:36.460, Speaker A: So I think one of the things that's important that we'll be exploring this season is what is the intent behind your organization? Right. If you take a protocol, if you look at someone like an ave, for example, is the intent of ave more like a company in the Milton Friedman sense? Is it to drive as much shareholder value as possible and to generate as much cash flow as possible. Or is the intent of Ave to be this thing that maybe kind of sits in the background? Is just this protocol for borrowing and lending? Other folks can build on top of it. In which case, the governance fit should look very different in those two situations. So we're going to explore over the next what? Six, seven episodes? What that actually looks like? But your argument seems like, Mike, that it's all about the intent, right?
00:06:36.830 - 00:07:22.466, Speaker B: So there are two key things that I think organizations should consider whether to be a dao or a company. Basically, one is the intent of the organization. Right. So is this just maximized shareholder returns and profits, or is there some other intent? Right? You can even look at DAOs. There's, like, Ukraine Dao, right? To raise funds for Ukrainians, that type of thing. So it depends on the intent of the organization overall. And then the other thing that is very accepted in corporate governance, it's kind of taking for granted, but I never see discussed within the concept of dow governance is how mature is your organization? Right? What is the lifecycle? If you take the example of a company for instance the governance at a very early stage always private company is extremely different of what the end state of governance looks like for for profit corporation.
00:07:22.466 - 00:07:36.362, Speaker B: In Dows. We almost have this one size fits all. This is when you should be a Dow. This is when you should be a company. And it never takes into account the maturity of the organization. So it has to do with two things the intent of the organization and the maturity of the organization.
00:07:36.506 - 00:07:54.082, Speaker A: Yeah. You remember Variant had that post maybe two years ago about exiting to the community? Reminds me of that. Right? You start very centralized and then you start to eventually exit to the community. All right, so that was kind of point number one about different types of companies and organizations. Governance Fit. Tell me about point number two.
00:07:54.136 - 00:07:54.306, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:54.328 - 00:08:11.718, Speaker A: You said most dows today. In our opinion, broadly fit. The term for for profit entities kind of fit into that bucket. In which case, corporate governance is the correct lesson to borrow from. Is this kind of a thesis that you believe? Is this something that you want to explore with the guests? Tell me more about this.
00:08:11.804 - 00:08:47.918, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think I'll just put my hand up and say this could change over time. I think if you look at most of the DAP layer of dows that exist today, these things look like for profit entities. You can quibble about whether it's public or whether it's private or what stage of development they're at or whatever it is. But in my opinion, the implicit, if not explicit, promise of these organizations is that they're going to generate profits. And I think the way that you can one of the things that you can test the litmus test for that is that they've issued a token which is worth something. And I know there are regulatory reasons for not promising access to any of the cash flows that the protocol generates.
00:08:47.918 - 00:09:17.534, Speaker B: In many cases, they actually bend over backwards for the protocol itself, not to generate any revenue. Right? Because they don't want it to be a security. But at the end of the day, I think most of these things look like for profit entities that resemble business. In that case, I think the canon for governance that we should be borrowing from looks more like corporate governance as opposed to something like sovereign level, very governance, which is kind of based more on fairness, I would say.
00:09:17.572 - 00:09:24.986, Speaker A: Yeah. And Then the last thing I Think that You And I both Feel strongly about is that the Advantage Of Dows is ultimately Based On The Stage Of The Dow.
00:09:25.018 - 00:09:25.166, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:25.188 - 00:09:30.126, Speaker A: You were talking about Maturation. There's two different things to determine. Kind of why dow or when dow.
00:09:30.158 - 00:09:30.354, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:30.392 - 00:09:37.134, Speaker A: One is intent and the second is maturation. This third bucket that we're exploring is that the advantage of DAOs is very dependent on the stage of the Dow.
00:09:37.182 - 00:09:37.346, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:37.368 - 00:09:58.442, Speaker A: In the beginning. It's Kind Of the Value Of The Dow is really the community. You get distribution, you get this rapid product iteration, and then later on, maybe if you're just becoming that, you want to become that protocol layer for others to build on top of. Actually, something like Ossification and Dependability might really be the benefit of becoming a Dow. And You Can look at things like Ethereum and Bitcoin as an example here, right?
00:09:58.496 - 00:10:43.718, Speaker B: Yeah. Before we get on to that, I want to get into the idea of decision making in organizations and how many different people should be involved in decision making. So there is a reason at a very early stage of company where you want nimble management teams that don't have to have a lot of decision. One thing that I see over and over and over in literature around Dows in what people talk about with the community is this idea of crowdsourcing ideas and somehow greater access to ideas and opinions is going to lead to better decision making. That is simply not true. It is the opposite of that. The vast majority of good decisions over basically, I think, human civilization have been through small groups of people who've been empowered.
00:10:43.718 - 00:11:33.354, Speaker B: There are good reasons to involve more stakeholders in the eventual outcome of organizations. But that is a separate topic from crowdsourcing decision making. I just don't think that's how you make good decisions. Think about even internally use an example in Blockworks, right? Like think about how you and I have talked about how decisions get made as we've gone from eight to ten to 25 to 50 people. Right. I think a lot of what good leadership is, especially at a very early stage of a startup or organization, is figuring out which people should be involved in making decisions, trying to limit that to making it as few people as possible, and even deciding what is the appropriate time for people to know information, to make decisions, all of that stuff. Is that's a process which should be governed by a small group of highly motivated, highly competent people.
00:11:33.354 - 00:12:24.178, Speaker B: And I think over a greater period of time when you have more and more people, first of all, after the organization has seen some success, but after the impacts of the decision making in that organization reach more and more people, that is when you give voice to more and more people, I think. And you're supposed to qualify the people that just have access to this information. I can't tell you how many times I've been lurking in governance forums. And a really qualified service provider to a dow, for instance, will say, hey, I put together this proposal oftentimes. It's extremely detailed, very well thought out, ten page proposal. And they kind of just put it out there and someone from the community just comments, too expensive. On what basis? Man, you're looking at that.
00:12:24.178 - 00:12:47.922, Speaker B: You have no idea what the market cost is for that. You don't know what the return is for doing that. You don't know what the risks of not maybe it's a risk management type proposal, right, where you're simulating different scenarios or outcomes. It's just uninformed people commenting on there's not only no value from uninformed people that are commenting on complex decisions, there is negative value, intense negative value.
00:12:47.976 - 00:13:09.082, Speaker A: I would say yeah and I think it's very dependent on that maturation phase. Right? Where are you in the protocol? If it's maybe later on that is okay for the whole community to be making decisions and you see this with something like some of the kind of earlier protocols in crypto but if it's something like a ten person startup you should be running a centralized playbook right there.
00:13:09.216 - 00:14:11.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. And I think then that aspect of decision making that kind of leads into what are the advantages of being a Dow at an early stage of a Dow like how should it look versus a later stage? And I've thought about this quite a bit I think when it comes to a Dow right now, the current state of Dow governance first of all it varies very differently based on Dow to Dow. But basically first of all, there's a lot of shadow stuff that takes place off the forums. But in theory the way that it kind of works is every major decision for a Dow is put to a vote in front of everyone and token holders vote on it and the decision gets passed or it doesn't pass. And that's both financing decisions and it's very technical sometimes product decisions. And I'm going to make the controversial step of saying capital allocation decisions especially in the early stage of a community. I think the community should have no say over whatsoever.
00:14:11.398 - 00:14:56.758, Speaker B: I think you see this in treasury management. I think one of the reasons why Dows were late to preparing for this downturn and bear market was this idea of not wanting to be front run by the Dow. So they didn't want to sell native token into USDC or something like that which was 1000% the right decision but they basically didn't want to get the idea of getting front run by the Dow is hilarious. But that is a great example of why capital allocation decisions should be made from financial professionals and not by bank holders. Basically. And I think there should be a way for the community to contribute to product decisions but you should essentially have to prove that you're a user. There should be some steps of qualification before you can have input.
00:14:56.758 - 00:15:08.942, Speaker B: I don't think you should basically just be able to permissionlessly join the community and start giving advice day one. It's just not helpful. But I think where Dows? Sorry? What do you think about that?
00:15:08.996 - 00:15:21.330, Speaker A: Well, just on that is I would probably push back. I think that it is fine for anyone to weigh in on decisions just like people weigh in on blockwork stuff all the time. I mean look at our ruthless YouTube comments. It's just that you don't listen to them.
00:15:21.400 - 00:15:21.682, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:21.736 - 00:16:07.570, Speaker A: And you don't have to listen to these things. Where it gets interesting in Dows is different voting mechanisms are still really early stage, right? So if you look at a lot of the protocols it's like one to one token to vote. But if you actually look at where people's tokens are coming from, oftentimes they don't have the capital to buy the tokens themselves, so they're getting delegated by someone. And if you actually follow the flow of the delegation, usually it's coming from one or two people. So one massive whale will control the delegation of the ten most important voters. So really it's actually quite a centralized system even though you have like 20 important people voting on these things. That is a system where you do have, quote unquote, the most important people, the people who own the most amount of, in this case equity tokens voting on things, who have the power.
00:16:07.570 - 00:16:14.418, Speaker A: But really sometimes I've seen they don't want to upset the person who has delegated tokens to them so they vote a certain way.
00:16:14.504 - 00:17:10.486, Speaker B: What could you be referring to here? Is there a very well known bellwether type dow where this situation might be applicable? I wonder? You know, what I think is going to get put to the test, dude, is this idea of the shareholder and the user being the same thing in the token holder? We will see because there are definitely companies that I in my little personal portfolio that I'm great at losing money in. There are definitely companies or tokens or whatever that I like and for that reason I want to be an owner of that company or protocol, but I have no interest in being a user and vice versa. There are also products that I love and use, but I don't think their business prospects are particularly good. And there has been this idea that aligning having the users and the shareholders be the same thing is going to be this extremely great alignment of incentives and interests and I think that is still up for debate whether or not.
00:17:10.508 - 00:17:42.378, Speaker A: That ends up happening frankly and tangentially, we saw with Lido like the dual class, the dual governance scheme, right? Which isn't really users and investors. I think in Lido's case they were trying to prevent validators from amassing undue power by giving Steeth holders veto powers over proposed changes to the See. And dual class voting exists in corporate governance all the time, right? So we're starting to see these things that do look kind of like corporate governance.
00:17:42.554 - 00:18:36.014, Speaker B: That's the hottest topic in, I would say corporate governance and probably finance. So at the time of us saying this, probably the most interesting experiment in governance or development in governance is actually happening outside of crypto. It's happening with Mark Zuckerberg over at Meta, who famously has dual class voting shares, is embarking through Reality Labs, their Metaverse unit. I saw on a podcast episode, if you basically chart out what Meta says they're going to spend on Reality Labs, which is something to the tune of like they've said, it's going to be 10 billion next year, but that's drastically going to increase, right? So maybe let's call it like 25 billion or something a year. If you plot that out and then compare against ten years, so say they're going to spend $250,000,000,000. If you compare that to previous capital allocation programs in history, inflation adjusted, that's about what the US. Spent to reach the moon on the Apollo mission.
00:18:36.014 - 00:19:07.814, Speaker B: So it's like an extremely tremendous amount of capital allocation that's happening through one person and it's making people upset. Right. But I want to say the advantage that I think that Dows have as opposed to early stage companies is distribution. I think that is the key advantage that they have. Because when you're a young company, you might not have access to a whole bunch of funds. You don't have a brand name, anything like that. Usually the way that you grow for many young companies is word of mouth.
00:19:07.814 - 00:19:41.378, Speaker B: Right. Creating evangelists. This is a lot of what the modern kind of function of growth is based on, especially at an early stage. The ability to issue tokens and potentially make people wealthy and then have them talking about you and creating this virtuous flywheel is enormous. And I would actually say issuing tokens and getting people wealthy is how every single crypto product that exists today that arguably has product market fit has achieved distribution, I think every single one and vice versa.
00:19:41.394 - 00:19:54.410, Speaker A: It's the reason why some of these newer layer ones might struggle because they came out at such a high valuation, right. So they won't have that core base of users that they make wealthy. Do you want to talk about some of the episodes we have coming up?
00:19:54.560 - 00:20:51.206, Speaker B: I want to just say then the end state, basically. So that's the advantage that I have in the beginning. I think at the end what's very important, and this was another post that you and I drew on for inspiration for this season, was a post that Vitalik wrote vitalik Buterin on why DAOs are not corporation and there's a different form of governance. So you should definitely read that, which is the counterpoint to a lot of what we're saying right now. But I would say that the end state for why Dows will be good. What successful Dows will look like is product that have very minimized surface area so they don't do a whole bunch of different things and have such a distributed governance that it takes very, very long to make decisions to the point where other companies, organizations, protocols will feel safe building on top of it. And what I mean by that is if you think about the US government, people say this all the time, it takes a long time to make decisions.
00:20:51.206 - 00:21:30.182, Speaker B: Is that a feature of a bug? In some instances it's a bug, but in many cases it's a feature because we have very well established property law in the United States. We have a functioning justice system and judicial system and courts that enforce those property laws. You and I as entrepreneurs. It makes us feel very safe and secure in the idea that we can build a company and another group isn't going to inherit power in four years and say, oh, yes, I'm going to grab this and take it from you. So we feel very safe building something meaningful here. We don't even think about it. As opposed to, let's say you are a company and you're thinking about using a vendor or a selection of different vendors to build a product on top of.
00:21:30.182 - 00:21:47.790, Speaker B: And your selection of vendor is going to be critical to building the product. If there's only one vendor that you can use to build a product on top of, you might as well not build that product, right? Another great example of this is Zynga, right? Building on Facebook. Unilaterally. Boom. They ripped it out from under you.
00:21:47.940 - 00:21:52.222, Speaker A: That built on Twitter using the Twitter API. And then they just shut down. And then they shut it down.
00:21:52.276 - 00:22:12.098, Speaker B: Right. And companies have internalized that and learned that lesson. So I think one of the features of DAOs that people complain about so much now. Right. It was really hard to get anyone to say a positive thing about Dow governance. To summarize what most people said, there are no advantages. What are the advantages of Dow governance? People are like, there is no advantage.
00:22:12.098 - 00:22:57.460, Speaker B: But I think at a mature stage, what people find so frustrating right now, which is I can't get anything passed. There's a whole bunch of people weighing in. Blah, blah, blah. I think in a mature stage of dow, that ossification actually becomes an advantage because it will make things. The changes will come so slowly that other protocols will actually feel safe and comfortable building on top of those dows. So what does that mean for capital allocation in those Dows? What does that mean for the return on tokens of those dows that start to look more like utilities and public goods than anything else? I don't know. But I do think at the end of the day, it is the ability having decisions come very, very slowly in a very equitable, fair way.
00:22:57.460 - 00:23:34.270, Speaker B: There is an advantage to that in some cases, and I think that's just for mature dow. So a lot of the friction that we see today, I think, with people complaining about Dow governance has to do that. What we're trying to borrow is the end state of Dow governance versus the beginning and again to just repeat in corporate governance. It's an accepted, known thing that in a small company no one expects, like in many cases, a board of directors or all this distributed decision making. It's the explicit expectation that the founders are supposed to make all the decisions and then it gets distributed over time. Because people understand that in a large corporation with a lot of stakeholders, that is beneficial.
00:23:34.430 - 00:23:56.518, Speaker A: Yeah. Eric Voorhees said this thing on stage at Permissionless. This past year he said that Dows are simply regulatory arbitrage. Today I'm curious how much you want to explore the regulatory side of Dows and whether or not regulation is driving these Dows or if you just want to avoid regulation in general.
00:23:56.684 - 00:24:22.442, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I do want to talk about that because I would agree with that. I would agree with that idea. I think one of the lessons that we learned from season one is we had a very specific thesis. I know what I just outlined was pretty specific as well. But I think what we want this to be is an exploration of this topic of Dow governance. We wanted to come in with a perspective and a point of view on Dow governance. Not to say, hey, we're going to explore Dow governance, but I fully expect a lot of what we're saying to get pushback from our guests.
00:24:22.442 - 00:25:18.894, Speaker B: And I would hope that at the end of this season we are proven wrong about some of how we're looking at this topic. In the beginning. I do think today mostly we didn't really talk about this angle. But the other advantage dows have probably is a global audience and it is regulatory arbitrage which by the way the internet got the internet is basically a whole regulatory arbitrage play a I think that's a massive so topics we'll explore outside. What I just explicitly outlined is we're going to do a whole bunch of work at looking at treasury management. Basically, we're going to try to categorize like, okay, these are a lot like what buckets exist for dows, right? Like what are kind of more social clubs and what at their end state should be almost like for profit public companies. We're going to be looking at regulatory arbitrage, we're going to be looking at treasury management and we're going to be explicitly talking near the end of the season about what are some of the explicit changes that DAOs are already undergoing.
00:25:18.894 - 00:25:28.818, Speaker B: Right? So what are some of the experimentation that's happening within Dow governance and how do we think Dows are going to look in the next bull market versus where we currently are?
00:25:28.904 - 00:25:49.980, Speaker A: Yeah, we have some great guests lined up. We've got the team at Reverie, Larry and Derek coming on from Reverie. We've got Hasu and Chris. We've got Mika Honkasalo tarun, chris Berniski, Jules rosenberg, Charles St. Louis. We've got some really great guests so we're excited about this one. Anything else about the show, about the season? I want to give a shout out to two of the sponsors for the season, but anything else before we do.
00:25:51.550 - 00:26:05.666, Speaker B: Just like this is an exploration of your and my interest. So guys, please give us feedback. Would love it. A lot of people give us assistance and support in developing these theses and ideas and we'd love to hear back from all of you what you think about this.
00:26:05.768 - 00:26:24.854, Speaker A: Yeah, big shout out to this show. Is completely free because of the sponsors. So I want to give a shout out to Avalanche and Reserve protocol, Avalanche. Hopefully everyone knows Avalanche by this point. If you're listening, I'd assume you know Avalanche blazingly fast. Amazing. L1, they've had some incredible developments in the bear market.
00:26:24.854 - 00:26:36.618, Speaker A: They rolled out the Core wallet. It's like a competitor to MetaMask. I've been using it. It's amazing. It's really, really fast. They worked with I think it was Paraswap to do swaps inside of the wallet. It's really nice.
00:26:36.618 - 00:27:02.610, Speaker A: You guys should check it out. There's also a bunch of cool DFI stuff happening on Avalanche right now. They also have the Avalanche bridge. You can move Bitcoin natively into the Avalanche bridge. I think it was like $70 million worth of Bitcoin were bridged over to Avalanche in just the first month since the bridge launched in the Core Wallet. So this is an example of a team who's just been really heads down building in the bear market. And what they have going on with Subnets is super interesting.
00:27:02.610 - 00:27:28.086, Speaker A: So we're going to keep talking about Avalanche throughout this entire season. But if you don't know Avalanche, hopefully you do know them. But if you do know them and you haven't looked at what they're doing recently, you should go check out the Core Wallet, should bridge some assets into it. And yeah, go check out Avalanche. The second one is reserve. Reserve is super interesting. So Reserve Protocol is a platform to build, deploy, and govern asset backed stablecoins.
00:27:28.086 - 00:27:29.194, Speaker A: So I've known their team for a while.
00:27:29.232 - 00:27:31.142, Speaker B: I spoke on a no bear market and stables, baby.
00:27:31.206 - 00:27:58.510, Speaker A: No Bear Market and Stables. And their thesis is that the world would be a better place if anyone could go create their own stablecoin. And you let the market decide. You let the free market decide where capital should flow into. So they have just launched a protocol to give anyone the ability to go create these custom bespoke stablecoins using the Reserve protocol. So you can build a stablecoin backed by maybe specific USD stables. You can get more complex.
00:27:58.510 - 00:28:19.670, Speaker A: You can use, like, inversely correlated assets, right. The branding, the governance, the composition, they're entirely up to you. We're going to talk a lot more about Reserve in the show, but yeah, I've known their team for a long time. Spoke on a panel with Nevin back at I think, SF Blockchain Week in 2019. Been excited about what they're doing and have wanted to work with them for a while. So, yeah, go check out Reserve. We'll put some links in the show notes.
00:28:19.670 - 00:28:20.666, Speaker A: Sweet, budy.
00:28:20.698 - 00:28:26.158, Speaker B: Looking forward to the season. You guys are the real ones. Appreciate you. Yep, let's get into it.
00:28:26.244 - 00:28:26.940, Speaker A: See you next time.
