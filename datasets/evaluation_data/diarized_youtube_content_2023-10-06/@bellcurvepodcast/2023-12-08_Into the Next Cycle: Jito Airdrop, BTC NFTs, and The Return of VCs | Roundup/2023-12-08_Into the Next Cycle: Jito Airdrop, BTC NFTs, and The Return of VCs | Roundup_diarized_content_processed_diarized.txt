00:00:00.410 - 00:00:47.882, Speaker A: The Coinbase ads, we haven't really talked about this, but that series of ads I think is just so good because it really does, it hits an emotional chord with at least me and clearly a bunch of other people as well. It's just like, yeah, I see no viable path to it's really financial freedom. They talk about all these things like debt, and I just feel like that's a narrative that's going to emerge amongst young people as crypto is a more viable path to financial freedom than the boomer bags. All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, Blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of crypto. Goldman, JPMorgan, zero 72, all in one room.
00:00:47.882 - 00:01:12.274, Speaker A: So you can know what the big money is doing. So click the link at the bottom of this episode. It'll take you right over to the homepage and use Bell 20 for 20% off. And I will see you in sunny London town in March. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with.
00:01:12.274 - 00:01:31.782, Speaker A: Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two in advance. Fellas. How are we doing hanging out?
00:01:31.836 - 00:01:34.200, Speaker B: It's been a one.
00:01:34.750 - 00:01:35.654, Speaker A: It has, baby.
00:01:35.702 - 00:01:37.098, Speaker B: Busy end of the year.
00:01:37.264 - 00:01:41.574, Speaker A: I know. Yeah. We got to do a predictions episode.
00:01:41.702 - 00:01:45.754, Speaker B: I was just thinking of that. I got some good ones. I got a couple up my sleeve.
00:01:45.882 - 00:01:51.534, Speaker A: I do too. I went back and listened to ours. I think we did pretty well on the whole, actually.
00:01:51.732 - 00:01:58.482, Speaker B: I mean, we've just always been bullish. You're going to be right every once in a while.
00:01:58.616 - 00:02:23.306, Speaker C: Do you know what actually is really fun, Vance? I was talking to one of our lps about this when we had our fund three announcement we came out with and it's on our website. Anyone can go and check it out. We came out with some 2030 predictions and some of them are actually already starting to come true, which is super interesting. So maybe we sped run 2030 as well.
00:02:23.408 - 00:02:40.814, Speaker A: Let's go. We love to hear that. Actually I was reminded of something. Remember, I don't know, a couple of months ago, I brought up this predictions from Goldman Sachs, and it was like, money market funds moving on chain. And you guys were like, actually, some of that will, I don't want to front run. Actually, I don't want to front run the prediction. Yeah.
00:02:40.814 - 00:03:26.490, Speaker A: All right, so speaking of front running, Jito launched today. I know you guys are investors. I also have a bag of Jito, so I guess disclosure there. But you can go back on Bell Curve and listen to episodes that we've been doing with Lucas for the last year or so. Gigantic fan of that project, and I think we can talk a little bit about the airdrop today. But I really love the business model, and I'm starting to see this narrative now of Jito being lido plus flashbots. And I just want to do a descriptor of why that is and why I think it was really smart of the Jito team to pick up on the connection between Mev and liquid staking, because I feel like that's a really smart.
00:03:26.490 - 00:03:52.002, Speaker A: That's a really smart connection. But in terms of the airdrop, I guess just to give the overview the token. So we're recording this literally 30 minutes after it went live. So it's 45 minutes. It's 1145 now. GTO is just under $2. This was kind of an interesting airdrop because I think there were a lot of farmers that got a surprise to the upside.
00:03:52.002 - 00:04:35.780, Speaker A: Like, if you had been holding staking, even like a couple eth, like $100 or something worth of Salana through Jeto, you'd done pretty well. By some estimates, you might have gotten $5,000. And that's very different from sort of the very civil, almost like dos, sort of airdropping that goes on, on some of the l two s, for instance. So I think it was a very positive surprise for many of the people that were farming Jeto. Yeah, I'm just not really savvy enough to be like, this is where I think the token price ends up shaking out or anything like that. I've got no idea. But, yeah, I know you guys are, again, caveat investors in Jito, but what did you think about all this? Or happy to get into their business model, or why you think it's interesting?
00:04:36.410 - 00:05:24.094, Speaker B: On the liquid staking side, they're in the early innings of bootstrapping, what we think is going to be the biggest LST in Solana. And we can pull up like Jito, WTF? Or one of the analytics dashboards, but they're at about six and a half million sol. And they're running liquidity mining right now, which is kind of know, if you think about what Lido did with its tokens in the early days versus what Jito is doing with its tokens in the early days. Lido, as you remember the bridge, know, there was no withdrawals. So Lido had to spit all of its inflation at a curve pool to get the LST to be one to one pegged. And that was a huge use of tokens. And now what Jeto is doing is they're doing liquidity mining.
00:05:24.094 - 00:06:07.390, Speaker B: You're going to be able to kind of earn rewards by staking Jeto soul. And you're kind of in the early innings of what we think is going to be the aggregate stake rate on salon is about 70%. And so it's very possible that the aggregate stake rate for the winning LST is higher than that on Ethereum. The inflation is also on Salana, about 7% right now, compared to like 3% of Ethereum inflation, roughly. So there's kind of like a number of differences between the two. But I think the comp is pretty clean. And then I think kind of once that phase of growth is kind of conquered for Jito, I think what's next is building really robust lending markets on Salana.
00:06:07.390 - 00:06:57.140, Speaker B: And the thing that kind of sucks about not Salana specifically, but like a lot of chains that are not eth l one is that maker is just like this always on. It's kind of like the uniswap model where you want a stable coin at midnight on Christmas Eve and you need like 100 million of them. You can actually get that if you post collateral. There isn't anything that's that reliable, that cheap on any of these other chains yet. I think with the maker endgame, it will kind of make strides towards that. But I think that's kind of the next big thing for successful lsts is like, how do you build that looping dynamic of the LST? A lot of the Defi use case on existing ETh chains. Is that so? Maybe that's in the weeds, but that's kind of how I think about the first few innings of growth for what's going on.
00:06:57.750 - 00:07:43.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I think maybe just to give for folks who might not be, as in the weeds on Jito, just a bit of a history. So Jito actually started with mev use case. So they have a client which at the current time has about 42% market share in Salana. And the way that I would consider it's almost like there's an analogy to Mevgeth. So the client that flashbots developed, which has much higher market penetration, something like maybe 95%, I'm actually not really sure. But basically what that is very similar to Mevgeth and the original mev boost product from Flashbots is you're basically running an auction. So, not to get too far into the weeds, but block building on Salana is different than it is on Ethereum.
00:07:43.866 - 00:08:24.958, Speaker A: It's continuous, as opposed to these discrete twelve second blocks on Ethereum, which makes MeV a little bit more challenging. So basically what you're trying to optimize for in Ethereum is actually extending the amount of time that you have to run this auction that goes for every single, for 12 seconds. And at the end, some very specialized. At this point, block builder will create this block that gets distributed over this marketplace, that's run by flashbots to a specific proposer, they'll sign the header, the block gets propagated. What jeto essentially has to do is slow down time and create these. I believe that the auction time is 200 milliseconds, where they'll run a discrete flashbots like auction. So that was product number one.
00:08:24.958 - 00:09:08.060, Speaker A: Then I think very intelligently, they identified who their customer is, is Solana validators. Well, what else? What's like a cross selling opportunity that I could do to other Solana validators? I could sell them a liquid staking product. And the synergy in between those two products, outside of just an easy cross sell, is if I'm running this auction on behalf of my validator clients, then I can actually extract a little bit of mev and I can move up the yield that they're earning. So, easy cross sale synergy between the two products. And that's why people are saying it's this cross between lido and flashbots over on Ethereum. And overall, it's just a really intelligent product suite that makes an enormous amount of sense together, at least, I think.
00:09:08.910 - 00:10:21.598, Speaker C: One additional kind of variable that may be more aligned with the institutions. I think one of the critiques that we hear is, well, there's whatever it is, 70% stake rate on Salana. And one of the reasons why Lido became so popular on Ethereum is because there was that two year period of the beacon chain being launched. No liquidity for anyone who was a staker. If you were staking to earn the yields, you literally were kind of stuck until you had the opportunity to get liquidity with that state Deeth token or wrap state Deeth in the Solana instance, that's not the case, but what everyone has realized since. And one of the advantages of this token model is you're able to take all the things that you just said, the MEV components, you're able to take the yield, you're able to take the inflation, and you're able to wrap it in a token that switches basically the taxability and the way that income is generated into a single token that accumulates value over time in the same way that wrapstate eth does. And this is the difference between earning income every single day that you're earning some of those tokens, versus capturing that in a capital gain in the form of gdosol.
00:10:21.598 - 00:10:47.580, Speaker C: And so there may be easy onboarding, easy offboarding, there isn't the same waiting period for staking Solana tokens natively in the protocol, but you're subject to unfavorable tax and financial implications over time. And so institutions definitely favor a wrapped token model. And so the expectation as well is that some of that 70% starts to shift over into this favorable token model too.
00:10:48.430 - 00:11:51.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you're a sole bull, and I think investing in jeto has made us more interested in the ecosystem as a whole, and I think more specifically in DeFi, because if you don't have Defi on the chain, that's kind of like the base level primitive, what you need to have it be money. And if you think about how to build an ecosystem, the number one use case is looping. Like that is the bread and butter of what DeFi should be on Solana. And you look at things like blast, where they're like taking, say they took people's soul and then they staked it in Jeto's soul, and they're creating this sub ecosystem and it will have a token that launches on like, there's so many other cool combinatorial things that you can do once this ecosystem is real, and as I said before, the next thing is the lending market. But if you get those two right, you really do have a shot of having Defi. And I think maker, and especially the backend being put on the SVM is going to bring that source of liquidity closer to this, which is cool.
00:11:51.892 - 00:12:31.318, Speaker A: Yeah, really good points there. I think just to maybe underscore, Michael, something that you said a little while ago, there's a path dependence, which is pretty interesting difference in between Salana and ETH. So Salana started as a proof of stake network, Ethereum started as proof of work, and Cosmos and Salana both have really high stake rates compared to Ethereum, somewhere around 80 plus percent. I'm not 100% sure where they are exactly. ETH is much lower than that. But conversely there's like inverse adoption of liquid staking. So the liquid staking penetration for even with jeto and marinator, sort of the two on Solana is very low, as opposed to being very high on Ethereum.
00:12:31.318 - 00:12:47.182, Speaker A: It's because the pain point of being able to stake in Ethereum originally was very difficult, so Lido stepped in to fill that gap. So it's just an interesting thing to point out that Jeeto has a lot of room left to run, even on its just core liquid staking token.
00:12:47.246 - 00:12:48.020, Speaker B: I would.
00:12:49.990 - 00:13:29.594, Speaker A: Know. Vance, you mentioned something really interesting about the Defi ecosystem building out, and one thing that I have tried to think about a little bit and don't have great answers for is what is the know. Obviously fees are much lower on Solana. How is that going to impact market structure on Defi? So one interesting quirk, like you can already see this sort of playing out. So Jupiter obviously very successful as an aggregator of exchanges. That's not the case on Ethereum, right? You have uniswap, which everyone just goes to uniswap and the one inches of the world are like great, but not ultimately very successful. And I would point to gas costs is probably the reason why, right? Because you have to route one, you're just routing multiple hops and each one has gas.
00:13:29.594 - 00:13:36.318, Speaker A: So it'll be interesting to see, as DeFi gets built on Salana, how the market structure is different than it is in Ethereum.
00:13:36.494 - 00:14:16.640, Speaker B: You're not going to have the same gas wars from 100 different mev bots, creating a shit ton of fees to try to arb something. You're probably going to have a more professional mev operator set where the margins are a bit thinner. But those people are also part of the ecosystem. In a strange way, it's like the bots can actually be good for you in times where they drive network revenue to stakeholders, but we'll see. The judo people are just awesome. They could be building rockets or doing any number of crazy intellectual things, but they've just eaten glass for the past two years and it's awesome to see them kind of launch and have a moment.
00:14:17.330 - 00:14:42.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I would tend to fan just maybe to plug if folks want to get much more even in the weeds, just about a as a business model, I would recommend going back to we did an episode with Lucas and Xavier Megan, the CIO at Chorus one where you get like a super, it was like an hour and a half long episode, just super in depth on their whole business model. We did that a couple of months ago and we can link it in the show notes.
00:14:42.290 - 00:15:24.820, Speaker B: One last point I have is just like the hesitancy of a lot of people to use things as collateral. So a lot of how Michael and I feel about doing things actively on know strategies where you borrow, strategies where you farm, you need a very agile collateral, and you need to be able to borrow against it, and you need to be able to do different things with it, stake it, swap it, just do different things. Most tokens people will not take as collateral on lending markets. Most tokens people don't even really trade. And I think getting people to start using Solana for things doesn't really even matter what they are. It could be nfts, it could be defi. It could be borrowing, whatever.
00:15:24.820 - 00:15:42.650, Speaker B: That's what you're trying to create, because that is the path to money. And I think that's kind of like, there's going to be plurality of crypto money, but the thing that's going to distinctify them is just like, do people use it for anything? Because it can't really be money if you don't.
00:15:43.390 - 00:16:20.326, Speaker A: I think that's a really good point. And one thing that at least I've been thinking about recently is it feels like Solana at some point. I think they're doing what they should be doing in terms of their fees today. But there are a couple of holes, I think, with Solana's design. So even local fee markets, which we've talked about on this program, they're not really in implementation today. There are a lot of problems with how they're implemented, and I think people talk past each other on fees a lot of the time, because, again, protocols are at different points in their lifecycle. But it does feel like at some point in the future, Salana will have to do its version of 1559, something like that.
00:16:20.508 - 00:16:36.918, Speaker B: Nothing's perfect, by the way. No one has solved the scalability problem. The only people who've solved the fee problem is still eth and sustainability. And that gets glossed over, definitely. But all of these approaches have relative strengths and weaknesses or holes.
00:16:37.094 - 00:17:11.990, Speaker A: Yeah, I tend to agree with you. All right, I want to talk a little bit about nfts, but actually, specifically, I don't know if you guys have seen what's going on on bitcoin. These BRc 20s ordinals really taking off. I'd be curious. I have some thoughts on this, but I'd be curious, have you guys paid attention to that market at all? I know it's still a pretty small market today. I just added this now. But wait, what is this? I just saw and added? Oh, my God, that's so funny.
00:17:12.970 - 00:17:14.120, Speaker B: His name was.
00:17:17.370 - 00:17:19.110, Speaker C: We're still at free money. Yay.
00:17:19.270 - 00:17:26.086, Speaker A: Yeah. Free money. Yay. That's amazing. Yeah. Jito is at $2 now. Well, good for Jito.
00:17:26.086 - 00:17:28.426, Speaker A: Again, not trade or here.
00:17:28.608 - 00:17:42.000, Speaker B: We haven't done much in ordinals. We just did Babylon, which is BTc restaking. But I've seen the BRC 20 takes. They're hot.
00:17:43.250 - 00:17:52.562, Speaker A: Can I give you guys maybe a hot take on bitcoin nfts? And then you guys talk me down and tell me why it's a bad take? That's your take?
00:17:52.696 - 00:17:55.650, Speaker B: Didn't you go too much into nfts last market?
00:17:55.800 - 00:18:14.602, Speaker A: No, not at all. I've never made money on nfts, but I've turned pretty. Not financial advice. But here's my general framework for nfts. The l one token goes up. People look for what to do with that token, and they invest in art, culture, whatever. I just think that's the core use case for it.
00:18:14.602 - 00:18:47.774, Speaker A: And bitcoin is suffering from this problem, which is there's not actually that much to do. It's still the largest pool of wealth in crypto. And despite what the sort of maxi Twitter would have you believe, these people actually do like to do things. And what I would point to as evidence for that is centralized finance, or CFI. Right. You used to be able to park your bitcoin in blockfi and get a yield, but that all blew up. So now there's this gigantic pool of crypto native wealth, and there's nothing to do with it outside of these silly NFTs.
00:18:47.774 - 00:19:09.322, Speaker A: And I think you can see, like, you can look at what people are doing with ordinals. People are buying these things, and there's a bunch of bitcoin NFT projects that are launching soon. Taproot Wizards is my personal favorite, just because I like Eric and. But, yeah, again, not financial advice, but I'm kind of looking at that being like, I bet everyone's fading that, and it makes intuitive sense to me.
00:19:09.376 - 00:19:12.186, Speaker B: Why did you see, uh, comments in.
00:19:12.208 - 00:19:15.214, Speaker A: The thought I did.
00:19:15.332 - 00:19:16.270, Speaker B: Hilarious.
00:19:17.490 - 00:19:21.198, Speaker A: This was the Luke Dash comments about how calling it an exploit or a.
00:19:21.204 - 00:19:28.740, Speaker B: Vulnerability or something, he was like, thank you for contributing. You don't own the chain. Like, thank you for storing all of our jpegs on your nodes at home.
00:19:29.590 - 00:19:31.010, Speaker A: It was pretty funny.
00:19:31.430 - 00:19:58.202, Speaker B: But I do think that's like the bullcase is like, look, people were buying ether rocks for like a million dollars last cycle. I'm with you on whatever you're pitching. I'm with you. But I think the risk with bitcoin is Luke Das Jr. He is like a bitcoin core dev. And he was saying, don't worry, we're going to patch this bug and eliminate the spam. It's kind of like a dangerous place for a network to be in, controlled by just ideological people.
00:19:58.202 - 00:20:08.400, Speaker B: But we do own bitcoin. We've invested in the bitcoin ecosystem, so we're also exposed to it. We're rooting for taproot wizards and all those people, though.
00:20:11.010 - 00:20:31.160, Speaker A: When people talk about building even like Defi on bitcoin, I think NFTs on bitcoin make a lot of sense. Defi I'm less sure about. I love Babylon as a project, by the way. I think David is a great founder. He makes a lot of sense. He's been on the pod before. But I think, yeah, obviously not financial advice, but I think it's interesting.
00:20:32.170 - 00:20:34.610, Speaker B: We're excited to be able to do stuff with our bitcoin.
00:20:34.770 - 00:20:41.626, Speaker A: Yeah. Just right now, no yield, baby. People love yield. They really love it.
00:20:41.808 - 00:20:47.402, Speaker B: It really is tradfi or Defi gold. It just kind of sits there.
00:20:47.536 - 00:20:48.090, Speaker A: It is.
00:20:48.160 - 00:20:51.158, Speaker B: More use cases will be good for that, hopefully.
00:20:51.254 - 00:21:21.090, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, Blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of crypto. We are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers. So think tradfi, macro funds, crypto native funds, big allocators and financial institutions. So banks, payment processors, et cetera, all in one spot. It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan, zero, 72, whatever, all in one room.
00:21:21.090 - 00:21:41.894, Speaker A: So you can know what the big money is doing. We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of macro and crypto, where we are in the cycle, real world assets. So everything from stablecoins to onchain treasuries to tokenized assets, it's going to be a blast. But the other reason you really want to go is London, baby, center of the world at one point. You got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer. It's going to be a blast.
00:21:41.894 - 00:22:00.638, Speaker A: So because you're such great listeners to Bell curve, there's a code, Bell 20, that's going to get you 20% off. So click the link at the bottom of this episode. It'll take you right over to the homepage. You'll see all of our speakers and use Bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code. I will see you in sunny London town in March.
00:22:00.638 - 00:22:21.640, Speaker A: I have a question for you guys, actually, maybe on a related note for bitcoin, I had a conversation with someone this week who it doesn't feel like retail is really back yet. Like, not at all. I did see some people today. Coinbase moved up to, like, 300 on the Apple App Store. Like, a big jump. But 300 is still 300, baby. That's not here.
00:22:21.640 - 00:22:23.062, Speaker A: I would be curious.
00:22:23.126 - 00:22:29.180, Speaker C: I remember when it was either one or two. Any given week during 2021, that's when. You know, for a year.
00:22:29.630 - 00:22:30.940, Speaker A: Yeah, for a year.
00:22:32.190 - 00:22:37.550, Speaker B: I'm already noticing people getting fatigued by the bull run, the early stages of a bull run.
00:22:37.700 - 00:23:02.262, Speaker C: So maybe this is the direction you're going, Mike. And sorry to jump in, but I've had the same experience. Friends or friends of friends who are not in the space, who are basically in the mindset of, like, wow, you're still doing crypto. Interesting. I didn't realize it was still happening. It's like, best performing asset this year. I don't know where you've been living.
00:23:02.396 - 00:23:25.840, Speaker B: But the normies are not back yet. Only small. Like, the forward deployed ones are the adventurous ones, but nowhere close to real retail. I think that happens when you break the all time high. And think about last cycle when we broke twenty k, it was on and it just became a frenzy. I don't think you can expect that until the all time high.
00:23:26.930 - 00:23:43.266, Speaker A: That was going to be my question to you guys. Is it around the all time high? And that, to me, feels like. Because I remember what it felt like last time when it broke the all time high. It was just like, oh, shit, we are back. But I didn't really feel like it before that because maybe I just wasn't as in it as I am.
00:23:43.448 - 00:23:45.582, Speaker C: Did we break all time high last cycle?
00:23:45.726 - 00:23:49.170, Speaker B: I think it was December. I think it was December 2019.
00:23:50.230 - 00:24:09.930, Speaker C: No, 2020. Right. Okay. But then just think about it after that. You still had another year of price discovery. And then there was another, like, six months after that post all time high, where things were just kind of, like, consolidating. Obviously, we had structural issues six months after that with Luna Celsius and then everything else that happened.
00:24:09.930 - 00:24:44.886, Speaker C: But to say that we're back in the bull market from a perspective of Normie realization and coming back, that's the furthest component that we're seeing right now. I think about the timelines, and it seems super rudimentary, but we are in December 2019 times right now. Just every single week that goes by. I am furthered with the point that we're reliving the cycle and it's not going to look the same. It's going to be different ways. It's going to happen in different ways. It's going to rhyme, but it's not going to be the same.
00:24:44.886 - 00:24:54.620, Speaker C: And if you just keep your mental map of here is where we are in the timelines, it's a pretty good barometer for what to expect.
00:24:55.390 - 00:25:30.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I think about the people that are doing or moving the markets around. It's probably crypto natives and then institutions. We have lots of lps now, kind of like reaching out again. We have people at the office this week. People are re energized about the space at the institutional level in a way that hasn't been the case. Know two? Yeah. I would also expect the cycle to be slightly different in the sense that maybe the Coinbase App Store ranking is not the most relevant thing if most of the bid is coming from people like etfs or hedge funds.
00:25:30.150 - 00:25:59.600, Speaker B: Right. It's always different. I was even thinking about, what does the crash look like after this cycle? And there will be one. Crypto is just, like, prone to these things, but I could see it being like a traditional institution that accidentally blows up or like a staking, slashing incident. But it's tough to relive the last cycle unless there's the same level of outright fraud and scams. And I think the whole point of the past year is making sure that doesn't happen again.
00:26:00.450 - 00:26:01.840, Speaker A: I hope so, too.
00:26:03.170 - 00:26:48.720, Speaker C: I also think this cycle, I mean, fingers crossed, but it seems like with all of the moves that are happening in DC, there will be some regulations that happen this cycle. I don't think that we're just going to sit and let that pass. I think stablecoins is probably going to be the first to move fit for the 21st century. Bill probably needs some adjustments to it before it's ready for primetime. But all of those things moving in that direction are like exogenous factors that we couldn't even have imagined in 2021 or in 2017. So, I mean, there's also a lot of positive catalysts that could totally change this four year structure that we've been reliving over and over again like Groundhog Day. But yeah, to Vance's point, it's not going to be the.
00:26:48.720 - 00:27:26.300, Speaker C: So to take it back to nfts, I think nfts will get a bid. I think that is just kind of like the natural thing like you're talking about. But the really big thing too is we're going to see bitcoin and probably ETH every two weeks just get a natural bid of people who are allocated 1% to 5% of their retirement accounts or their managed accounts that every two weeks when they get their paycheck, allocate whatever that money is into those etfs. That is a structural market change that we absolutely haven't seen before.
00:27:27.150 - 00:28:14.714, Speaker A: I agree with you, and I agree with you that I think institutions have been. It looks like if you just look at CME volumes, it looks like around July is sort of when they started moving in a little bit or some of the quicker moving ones. So, yeah, I still think it's not financial advice. I just feel like it's still pretty early. Even one of the things that at least I pay a lot of attention to because it's relevant for our business is we primarily monetize via ads from companies that have had a really rough 18 months or so. And the cycle that I see starting to happen now is vcs are raising again, vcs raise again. Maybe that happens by like December, Jan of this year, but then that takes some amount of time to deploy out into the market and then even then it takes a little while for people to start spending again because they need to think about marketing for the first time in twelve months.
00:28:14.714 - 00:28:47.530, Speaker A: So that to me is still like six months out into the future, I would guess, even if the market really takes off. So I don't know, my whole feed is filled with people calling for local tops. And I will just say that's not the type of thing you see when it is a local top that tops. You see everyone saying this thing is going to go to the moon and infinity. And I still think there's a lot of healthy, I would argue it's healthy PTSD in the market. And yeah, I just kind of feel like it's early and anyway, a lot.
00:28:47.540 - 00:29:28.994, Speaker B: Of them to run, it's early. We have a lot of the markers of kind of leading the bear as well. One of the classic ones was in 2020, people were overriding options on crypto because they would write covered calls and they would think that crypto wouldn't go up. And some of it obviously was passive income on crypto that you hold. But sometimes you can get into the naked realm of writing options on crypto that you don't hold. And last cycle, three AC bought all these options. And I think those were like some of the legit trades that they did do, but just like cheap fall and then crypto exploded and then they kind of reaped the benefits and you kind of had that same thing happen with fall has gone way up.
00:29:28.994 - 00:30:00.390, Speaker B: People were selling crazy amounts of options throughout this year. And just like a recognition that that strategy is no longer going to fly kind of removes a lot of the ceiling that you see on these crypto assets, because at a certain level, you're just not going to be able to overpower a trad five bid if you're writing a lot of these calls. So that activity is largely ceasing is kind of like one of the markers that at least I have for. Okay, it's not maybe like a bull market yet, but we're just seemingly slowly drifting higher.
00:30:00.560 - 00:31:14.066, Speaker C: And that last point, I think, is the crucial one when you don't have as much naked call writing going on. What was it? It was right before Thanksgiving, I think, when this whole thing kind of came to a head. Maybe it was the middle to end of October, and we kind of had heard that there was a large option seller call, option seller for ETH in particular, and this is right when it was around 1400, and that they had these price points, these strikes at the end of October around the like 16, 5017, 1750. That violent move up in our estimates was basically a covering of that option seller. And so when you're selling all these options and you're trying to make yield and maybe partial coverage, but partial naked, you're not going to have the violent moves up. And that violence, I think, is not having that, I think, is a testament of a real kind of solid institutional market as well, where you don't have an unexpected 10% day or 15 or 20% day. Maybe over the course of a week or a month, you move up ten to 15% to 20%, but it's not going to be over the course of 24 hours.
00:31:14.248 - 00:31:48.334, Speaker A: Yeah, well, even last time, what this reminds me of is actually like the 2020 period post the massive sell off. I would call it like a steady grind price action. It was just like, every day was just like up a little bit more. There were a couple of dips, but they quickly got bought. And that's what I. My memory is kind of looking at bitcoin around, like being like, oh, wow, this is the highest it's been in a long time. And then it just kind of steadily got up and as it got closer to the all time high, people started looking at it more.
00:31:48.334 - 00:31:52.080, Speaker A: And that's what it sort of feels like a little bit, at least to me.
00:31:52.530 - 00:32:25.818, Speaker C: And what I would say is the two things that you didn't have back then is the institutionalization and the product availability. You didn't have the CME, the ability to write or buy calls and puts. So you didn't have that violence. You also didn't really have. I mean, you had some perps, but those are pretty much contained into the finance ecosystem or FTX at the time. But I think that natural bid was mostly just Covid because remember, that was summer 2020. People realizing, oh, wait, maybe there's a different model.
00:32:25.818 - 00:32:45.780, Speaker C: People are stuck at home, they're getting free paychecks. That was sort of what a natural spot bid looks like in a progression into a bull market. And then it got over its skis and all of the above. But I think that that's right in that as we start to see that slow grind higher, that's the marker for the start of an interesting bull market.
00:32:46.230 - 00:33:23.900, Speaker A: I agree. One thing I wanted to get your guys take on is I'm curious. So my mental model for this has always been price sort of moves. First there's a bunch of raising money, and then on chain activity really takes off. And that has implications, at least for DeFi. And one of the things that I saw this week that I thought was pretty interesting is synthetics. They are voting to not only stop their inflation, but they're actually voting to considering a burn, a burn mechanism, which would be pretty unthinkable, I guess, like a couple of years ago.
00:33:23.900 - 00:33:49.730, Speaker A: That was not something that I feel like was even in the cards. And I know you guys are pretty positive on protocols that have sort of like a burn mechanism. And I'd be curious to get your thought. And I know you guys are like synthetics, ogs as well. So obviously not financial advice or anything like that. But I would be curious to get your thoughts, maybe on the synthetics proposal. Is this something that we're going to see much more in ethereum moving forward? Yeah, I would just love to get your thoughts.
00:33:50.310 - 00:34:37.010, Speaker C: I mean, can't speak to what other protocols will do, but I think other protocols will look at the success found amongst protocols that do have some sort of value distribution model. And to be clear, there's two separate proposals one is to stop inflation. And inflation has been a mainstay within the synthetics ecosystem, basically, since for the last four years. And it has turned into what I would call terminal inflation. It started off really high to bootstrap liquidity, and it slowly, week by week, went down over time, and then it hit this like two to two and a half percent terminal inflation. And that's where it's been for the last three or four months, really. Turning off inflation is just turning off that terminal inflation.
00:34:37.010 - 00:35:36.840, Speaker C: That's vote number one hasn't gone through yet. Vote number two, which I actually don't know if it's gone through, but I think it will, is to test out a lot of these mechanisms on base. And so to build the perps model on the base ecosystem, bootstrap liquidity have fees partially flow to the lps on base, fees will also partially flow to integrators who build Uis on top of the ecosystem. And then fees will also flow into this buyback and burn mechanism. So really, it is a test of that. It's not let's flip the switch and steer the ship completely to the right, but it's a test in that direction. And this is coinciding with a ton of work that the team has done to change the token economic model, to change the collateral model, to change the usability and the product suite that they have.
00:35:36.840 - 00:36:12.100, Speaker C: So this is not just happening in a vacuum. It's all part of the same plan. But I think we're going to start to see the models of decentralized long term protocols who are cash flow generative, looking to change their token economics to be more favorable, and we'll see how all this works. Can't say whether or not it will even, or even get integrated into the main protocol, but these types of tests, I think, will be good canaries in the coal mine for what could happen.
00:36:13.110 - 00:37:03.140, Speaker B: Yeah, they found product market fit with perps, obviously, and that product is really growing, and the deployment on base will even make it more so. And as volatility returns, we see the open interest growing daily, which is cool. And I think now the impetus is, what do we do with this token? Like the synthetics token and the synthetics token is interesting in a number of regards. Most people don't know that about 60% of it is staked. And what asset, other than base layer cryptos that are proof of stake networks are staked. It's kind of unheard of, in a strange way, but that's the collateral that backs all the trades and more collateral types and specifically like economics flowing back to the token. That's kind of like the last piece of the puzzle in my mind.
00:37:03.140 - 00:37:14.440, Speaker B: And yeah, I think it's going to be a huge year for Defi purps with kind of binance kind of fading in relevance a little bit.
00:37:15.290 - 00:37:18.166, Speaker C: There's just a huge market to take.
00:37:18.188 - 00:37:18.874, Speaker A: It all the way back.
00:37:18.912 - 00:37:30.830, Speaker C: One of the predictions that we had in our 2030 fund three launch was decentralized markets overtake centralized markets on both spot and futures.
00:37:32.690 - 00:37:35.760, Speaker A: That'd be awesome. Yeah.
00:37:36.450 - 00:37:56.770, Speaker B: I feel like so much of this price action as well as the bid is just like the real work that's been done and there's maybe not like 30 teams that have done real stuff, but like 20 I think in DFI at least. But that's enough. That's a whole ecosystem.
00:37:57.350 - 00:38:27.918, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm with you there. We talked about a little bit just even what's gone on on NFT marketplaces blur and tensor but know have put in tremendous work. So whether that's synthetics with, you know, we just spoke to Antonio over at mean. Antonio is a great example of a guy who's just very, he lives in the future and I think is a really good bellwether of where the industry is going. I think almost the risk might be that he's a little too early on some stuff, I think, but. Yeah, I think.
00:38:28.004 - 00:38:42.366, Speaker B: But he's been doing this for like seven. Like we were trading on DYDX when you were literally trading the tokens, the leverage tokens. He's just going to be around forever and he'll figure it out. Yeah, I'm positive.
00:38:42.558 - 00:38:57.510, Speaker A: Me too. Me too. But I agree with you, Vance. I think there's been. That is the cheesy thing that everyone says about bear markets. But it is true. If necessity is the mother of invention, a lot of companies had to do layoffs.
00:38:57.510 - 00:39:26.882, Speaker A: You have to focus a lot more on your product, what's working, what's not. It leads to results. So hopefully that's what we'll see. I guess maybe just to start to wind down here, one thing that we haven't talked about, I saw this chart today of the percentage of stocks that are owned by generation. And you look at it and it's like here, I'll grab it here. But basically it's just super heavy. I mean it's exactly what you'd expect.
00:39:26.882 - 00:39:59.878, Speaker A: It's like extremely heavy boomer and then a little bit Gen X and this really tiny percentage. Millennial and like non Gen Z basically. And one of the things I thought was interesting is, like, the Coinbase ads. We haven't really talked about this, but that series of ads, I think, is just so good because it really does. It hits an emotional chord with, at least me and clearly a bunch of other people as well. It's just like, yeah, I see no viable path to. It's really financial freedom.
00:39:59.878 - 00:40:13.034, Speaker A: They talk about all these things like debt, and I just feel like that's a narrative that's going to emerge amongst young people is crypto is a more viable path to financial freedom than the boomer bags, which is like stocks.
00:40:13.082 - 00:41:03.090, Speaker C: And also, I'll summarize this article real fast, but I read an article, I think it was in Business Insider. I sent it to Vance and a couple of our other friends that had Gen X, Millennial, and Gen Z broken down by what income and what net worth they expect to be considered, quote unquote, wealthy. And Gen Z was like $130,000 and like 400 grand. Millennials was like $572,000 in income and like $1.7 million in net worth. And then Gen X was, I think it was like $131.1 million.
00:41:03.090 - 00:41:47.294, Speaker C: Basically, millennials is completely out of whack with expectations of income and net worth. And I think that's the symptom of the root cause of millennials are now. We're all millennials. It's at the age where people are starting to look at buying homes, people are starting to look at starting families, people are starting to put that foot forward in terms of the life progression of settling down. So to say, Gen Z is like, happy go lucky. They're still having fun, just getting out of college type. And obviously, Gen X, they're set because they bought houses 15 years ago, 20 years ago, and got married 20 years ago.
00:41:47.294 - 00:42:20.470, Speaker C: And it's going to be a real issue, I think, for our generation, where you could look at any of the sociology or psychology studies, and people are just generally way unhappier now. And I don't think that it's because we have less, but I think it's because we want more. And that difference is leading to general unease and unhappiness. But the financial outcomes or financial realities of what everybody is staring at are real and impending, and they're not changing.
00:42:22.170 - 00:42:36.958, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to summarize this chart, which is, for those of you who are listening, the silent generation owns 17%. This is, as of 2020, 17% of the stock market. Baby booners own 53%. Gen X, 27 millennials. I think that's 3% down there.
00:42:37.044 - 00:42:41.422, Speaker B: Did you read the Galaxy research report on the wealth transfer this week?
00:42:41.476 - 00:42:42.030, Speaker A: No.
00:42:42.180 - 00:42:46.866, Speaker B: Thought it was really good. Something Thorne wrote it.
00:42:46.888 - 00:42:47.950, Speaker A: Alex Thorne?
00:42:48.110 - 00:43:25.882, Speaker B: Yeah, that guy. But it kind of gets into this with a lens to where does the money go? And obviously, millennials are. So the way it'll work kind of cyclically is this. 53% of baby boomers, they will pass on their money to millennials, like our parents, I think, are all probably baby boomers. And that's the largest wealth transfer in history from an inheritance perspective. And then you have Gen X, the generation after the baby boomers, who gives their money to the zoomers, and generation alpha, which is the generation that's around right now. And so if you think about it from what happens perspective.
00:43:25.882 - 00:44:04.246, Speaker B: So by the end of this decade, millennials will control five times more wealth than they did by the start of the decade. And you're going to have. If you think about crypto, it's a demographic phenomenon. It's more popular with young people. It's also a geographic phenomenon, it's more popular overseas, there's higher adoption rates in developing countries. And so it all kind of leads to this question of if you believe in a super cycle, if you believe in that concept, it's largely made up of kind of generational change and generational preference shift. And the Galaxy report, it has all these amazing facts.
00:44:04.246 - 00:44:57.914, Speaker B: You should definitely go read it. But at the end of the kind of article, the net net of everything is that if you assume all these numbers are right, there's going to be about $28 to $29 million of daily buying pressure from millennials. But mostly millennials, because it's where most of the wealth is. And that's a lot of buying pressure. And so it's a crazy world. Do I think a million dollar per bitcoin at some point is possible? If a lot of these demographic phenomenons play out and the world gets crazier and alternative store values really kind of like pick up. I don't think that is out of the question in terms of the price targets we hear today are like, it's going to go to tradfi people, whatever, but it feels like that's kind of only the short term horizon that people think about.
00:44:58.112 - 00:45:29.142, Speaker C: So to tie these two things together, the wealth transfer is absolutely real. I read the same article. The thing that I would say is it's not happening in the next two years. It's happening in the next 20 years. And all of that is absolutely true. But from a generational perspective, if the vast majority of wealth that that generation has, is passed on through inheritance. That means that, a, it's not going to be spread evenly, and b, it's not going to happen all at once or frankly, happen evenly as well.
00:45:29.142 - 00:46:10.370, Speaker C: And so I think there's going to be economic realities of what's your day to day, what's your job, where do you live? All of that stuff that people are going to have to sort out and figure out. And that will probably drive them into more, in our minds, not the case, but more esoteric things like crypto versus the S and P 500 stock index or treasury bills and bonds. They're going to look for more advantageous ways of creating wealth, which means they're going to get brought into the ecosystem. And then as they start to receive more wealth through inheritance, I think that will just double and triple down in terms of where they will be deploying that and how they'll be looking at financial markets.
00:46:10.790 - 00:46:15.940, Speaker B: Think about millennials buying small cap value stocks. It's just not going to happen.
00:46:16.470 - 00:46:50.238, Speaker A: That's how I feel, too. That's exactly how I feel, too. And actually, this, I guess, isn't a front run, but this is what I was going to say about the Goldman thing. Like money market funds, all that stuff moving on chain. I think that was directionally correct. Like the equivalent of a money market fund will be built on crypto, but it's not going to be a one to one copy. It's like there will be a crypto native version of that built, and it will be like our new money market fund, not your boomer money market fund, and they're serving the same purpose, but I think they end up getting sort of rebuilt, and it's this gradual shift over time.
00:46:50.238 - 00:47:04.378, Speaker A: And actually just, Michael, to just underline what you were saying about expectation, there's a great. Wait, but why? Or whoever, Tim Urban, his blog on this, a very simple definition of happiness is like happiness equals reality minus expectations.
00:47:04.474 - 00:47:09.782, Speaker C: For some, it's what you, it's what you want over what you have.
00:47:09.916 - 00:47:18.406, Speaker A: Right. Exactly. So all good stuff to note. All right, guys, unfortunately, got to end it here, but this was a really fun one. See you next week.
00:47:18.508 - 00:47:19.062, Speaker B: Later.
00:47:19.196 - 00:47:19.586, Speaker A: Bye.
00:47:19.618 - 00:47:19.940, Speaker B: See you.
