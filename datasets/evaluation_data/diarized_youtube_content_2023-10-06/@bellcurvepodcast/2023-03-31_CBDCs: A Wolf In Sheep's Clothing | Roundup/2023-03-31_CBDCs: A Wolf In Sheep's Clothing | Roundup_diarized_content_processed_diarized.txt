00:00:00.090 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.730 - 00:00:33.618, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's, one and two, vance and Yano. What's going on, fellas?
00:00:33.714 - 00:00:38.594, Speaker A: Yeah, you guys were roasting me last week. I listened in. I was getting shredded.
00:00:38.642 - 00:00:40.140, Speaker C: You weren't supposed to hear that.
00:00:40.510 - 00:00:49.100, Speaker A: I was getting shredded on Bell Curve. We didn't think that was recording a nice little roundup. And you got to talk about my bald head. My God.
00:00:49.470 - 00:00:52.678, Speaker D: Yeah. No, I'm sorry. It's awkward to have you back here.
00:00:52.864 - 00:01:08.530, Speaker A: Well, what's awkward, Michael, is the big hair reveal that you're about to do for us. So I think I got to get you back, my friend. You're looking baby. Busted. Bustin'dana taught me a new word I'm supposed to know, which is snatch.
00:01:10.310 - 00:01:11.390, Speaker D: In what context?
00:01:11.470 - 00:01:13.140, Speaker B: In what context? Friend.
00:01:13.510 - 00:01:22.230, Speaker A: No, see, I don't even know how to use it's. Like Michael's looking snatch. I don't know. We need some gen zers to tell me how to do this.
00:01:22.300 - 00:01:32.140, Speaker B: I'm not 100% sure on that one. You might want to wait on that until you get further confidence. I actually learned another gen z one this week, which is a brick. You guys know what that means?
00:01:32.510 - 00:01:35.814, Speaker C: Like failing kind of like it's freezing basketball.
00:01:35.862 - 00:01:38.086, Speaker B: Like it's cold as brick. Like I was going to come visit.
00:01:38.118 - 00:01:39.094, Speaker A: You, but it was brick.
00:01:39.222 - 00:01:40.586, Speaker B: It was brick out.
00:01:40.768 - 00:01:48.462, Speaker C: It's cold. Okay. I heard risen. You ever heard of risen? Like I'm risen over don't.
00:01:48.516 - 00:01:49.982, Speaker A: I don't know that one you got.
00:01:50.116 - 00:01:50.510, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:50.580 - 00:01:53.120, Speaker C: Yeah. You're excited? You're like feeling good?
00:01:53.810 - 00:02:02.980, Speaker B: I went to a bar trivia night here in New York and the whole category was riz. And for the whole 1st 2 minutes we're like, what did they say?
00:02:03.670 - 00:02:04.980, Speaker C: What is that word?
00:02:06.250 - 00:02:09.720, Speaker A: Could you spell that for us, please? Yeah.
00:02:10.090 - 00:02:14.950, Speaker B: Whole English language out here getting reinvented right from under our feet.
00:02:15.770 - 00:02:16.246, Speaker A: All right.
00:02:16.268 - 00:02:49.940, Speaker B: I actually want to make this a non macro podcast for a change and get some thoughts on crypto specific stuff. So I would love to get your thoughts on kind of the two dominant stablecoins, USDC and Tether. So we've kind of seen some pretty significant outflows from USDC and Tether is ostensibly kind of looking at tether dominance is going up. It's looking like the safe haven. At least that's what it looks like on the surface. So I'd be very curious to sort of understand what you guys think about this.
00:02:53.590 - 00:03:56.770, Speaker D: Obviously since know, Silicon Valley situation issue, whatever we want to call it, had a number of conversations with portfolio founders, I would say uniform across the board and also in surprise to us, the move was to put it into Tether. Basically like take all the cash that you had, banks were not safe, USDC was not safe, put it into Tether. And that was kind of the safehold of where you wanted to put value for a short duration. Obviously everybody else has now moved to some sort of banking solution or banking infrastructure. But it was very surprising to me, at least over the last two weeks, that uniformly Heather was the thing that everybody immediately went to and said, this is the place we want to keep our value. I mean, obviously we saw USDC de pegged. You saw all the truffleuffle around that also talked to a couple of people over the last week who were trading USDC as it was de pegging.
00:03:56.770 - 00:04:12.982, Speaker D: And it seems like that was a pretty awesome yeah, it just, it feels know there is an opportunity to have something be the reserve currency and in a lot of ways it seems like Tether has been that by default.
00:04:13.046 - 00:04:45.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm just looking at the total market cap, looks like it peaked at 56 and now it's at 33. Peaked at 56 billion in July of 2022. It's kind of the same thing you see with the bank runs. Right. And it's not just the speed of mobile phones, it's literally just two ethereum transactions away, 24 7365. So you're seeing like finance at the speed of the internet and it's not surprising that there's this much volatility. I also think there's probably a lot of latent USDC that was just sitting there for one reason or the other.
00:04:45.798 - 00:05:10.478, Speaker C: And this was the event that woke people up to either getting to a new stablecoin or putting it into T bills or things that are on chain like ondo but I kind of wonder where this stops. Like 30 billion seems like you can't really do ta on this chart, but seems like a decent place for it to stop if it were going to but yeah, USDC kind of getting killed here and circle as a result.
00:05:10.644 - 00:05:22.814, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to give people some numbers, it's down from peak or about 90 days ago is about 43 billion in terms of market cap. Say it's 32. Rough math says 1111 billion in outflows.
00:05:22.942 - 00:05:39.910, Speaker A: Well, does it have something to do with where they invest? What it's collateralized by? One of them is invested. If you knew nothing about the backstory of Tether and nothing about like, oh, USDC is more reputable. It's like on paper, one of them invests in US bank deposits and the other invests in short term treasuries.
00:05:39.990 - 00:06:22.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's some additional hair on the frankly, we have a lot of USDC. I wouldn't trust Tether with our balances just because it's kind of indefensible for us to go to our LPs. If something were to happen to Tether and say, yeah, this offshore banking operation that has this checkered pass versus something that's holding T bills and us systematically important banks. So I continue to think the institutions are just going to be USDC. But I think what you're seeing is just asia does not have that same understanding and frankly probably just has a bit more history with USDT versus something that looks a little bit more regulated like USDC.
00:06:23.370 - 00:06:35.866, Speaker A: Is there any chance that Tether is interacting with you? I don't really understand how Tether's mechanism or whatever, like the burning and stuff like that. It never really made sense to me. Is there any way that Tether is interacting with USDC in some way?
00:06:35.968 - 00:06:36.810, Speaker B: Doubtful.
00:06:37.230 - 00:06:42.142, Speaker C: Doubtful. I think they would need to keep pretty clean lines between each of them just in order.
00:06:42.196 - 00:07:13.350, Speaker B: I think if you own Tether, you need to have a very strong thesis about why it has been able to stay so steady despite all the turbulence out there in the market. You need to have a good explanation. Are they that much better at risk management? Are there bond traders just dodging every bullet that exists out there? I don't know. I've never been able to construct a compelling thesis for why it's been so solid. It doesn't make much sense to me.
00:07:13.420 - 00:08:11.110, Speaker D: We had a conversation with a market maker and granted, this was like probably April 2020, so take it with a grain of salt as a lot of shit has changed since then. We had a conversation with a market maker, a very large reputable market maker, and they said, listen, you got to understand what Southeast Asia is like. When you go to Kalan and actually see some of the FX prices in the International Currency exchange, they're quoted in Tether, they're quoted in the base currency, which is USDT. So I think there is an infrastructure and it's probably not an infrastructure that we're used to seeing that has Tether as a core component where it's the base currency, it's the base trading pair. And I think that is really kind of mike, to your point, where is this happening? Why is this happening? I think that's a lot of the infrastructure that props up this currency.
00:08:11.190 - 00:09:09.802, Speaker B: So one little data point that I would throw at you guys is blockworks also puts out a lot of macro content. I'm actually the host of a small macro podcast called on the Margin. And what people were talking about a couple like probably 18 or so months ago, I forget the exact timeline, was, do you guys remember when there was a big Chinese real estate firm called Evergrande that was imploding? Yeah. And the concern at that period of time was because all of the macro kind of trader folks, what people always say about Tether is I have never met anyone who trades for like that's what all the bond traders would say, right, in US based banks and stuff like that. It's like for an entity that supposedly has a gigantic multi billion portfolio of bonds. I've never met anyone that trades for Tether. So then the thought was, all right, well, maybe what they're doing, they have exposure to Chinese paper and then evergrande happened.
00:09:09.802 - 00:09:34.546, Speaker B: And then that was actually dispelled. And Tether came out and said we had no exposure to evergrande. Which basically meant that you couldn't have exposure to China at that point. So then the question becomes, if you're not trading in US. Treasuries and you don't have any exposure to Chinese debt, where is that? However big it is now, 45 $50 billion bond portfolio sitting, they do have.
00:09:34.568 - 00:10:28.898, Speaker C: Attestations it's on paper somewhere. I don't know what the exact locations of the money are, but assuming those attestations are good, I see a compelling reason for people to use this. There's also different one of the different things about USDT versus USDC is there's a pretty robust culture of trading USDT OTC, which sounds a bit strange, but that's how people, first of all, off ramp from a lot of Chinese exchanges, you will go into these kind of like OTC markets. And they used to be more active when China was really running strong with crypto. And I assume they're active again now that Hong Kong is back. But you would really kind of use your account as a bartering chip to get stablecoins, which you would then convert into bank deposits. And that's how 90% of people that trade in China that at least I know, have actually used this.
00:10:28.898 - 00:10:43.946, Speaker C: So a little bit different of a use case as well. And there's a network of brokers which will do this for you. And who knows how active they are now. But there's a pretty robust culture of trading peer to peer USDT, as strange as that seems.
00:10:44.048 - 00:11:05.602, Speaker B: I have no special information. It has never made an enormous amount of sense to me. That's why I think you need a very strong thesis as to where that money is and why they might have been so impervious. But it's actually almost 80 billion in market cap, which is larger than I thought. And if you look at the charts of USDC versus tether market cap, they're basically inverses of each other.
00:11:05.656 - 00:11:31.434, Speaker D: Think about this pretty incredible business model. No matter what USDC, Tether, any of these stablecoins, if you're able to take deposits in to the tune of 80 billion or $100 billion, earn three, four, 5%, whatever it may be, or maybe less sure, but like two, three, 4%, and then you're not paying out any interest. Pretty awesome.
00:11:31.632 - 00:12:02.660, Speaker B: It's pretty awesome. But tether should have the same honestly, I kind of feel like all of them should have similar problem that the banks had in that when they were originally generated all that market cap and had to put it in Treasuries. They were doing that at a time when yields were pretty low. But I don't think USDC should be totally fine. That's why I'm with you guys. USDC is completely audited. They're very transparent, like a high degree of confidence that there's legitimate backing there.
00:12:03.270 - 00:12:31.870, Speaker D: It's not the same thing because USDC, I think the average tenor of all the fixed assets that they have backing up the USDC is like three months. They cycle these very rapidly. So it really matters what the short duration of the yield curve is in terms of what their yield is, in terms of what the revenue will be. But it's not like they're going to get stuck with these hold to maturity securities. They're not the same issue as the banks.
00:12:32.530 - 00:13:33.406, Speaker C: Ultimately, I hope the T bills end up on chain and instead of stablecoins as the base foundational layer of DeFi, you have something that's yield generative just because if you have something that's yield generative, your ecosystem is going to default grow by whatever that yield is year over year. And so you at least have a little bit of a tailwind and people are a little bit more enfranchised. And there's a cool product out there called Ondo which does OUSG, which is I think, like two or ten or whatever year government fixed income. The problem with those products is that you can't actually get wide distribution because everyone that buys them needs to be an accredited investor or a qualified purchaser. Which, if you don't know what that means, it usually means there's, like, a net worth threshold, which is bullshit we don't agree with, but there is a threshold for people who can actually buy these things. And so as a result, you're signing up with Ondo to create a registration in a security, which is a fund. You own an LP stake and so I don't know how you ever solve that.
00:13:33.406 - 00:14:01.698, Speaker C: But my hope is that we can. And I don't think you can do these things synthetically either. I feel like that would just be a lot of risk for the people who are on the other side of the trade. But my hope is that this is where this goes and maybe we see it come out of a different country. Maybe Europe has different laws around who can own government fixed income and who can trade it and things like that. Maybe it's like Asian bonds. But someone's going to start doing this just because the stablecoin business model to Michael's point, is just extremely juicy.
00:14:01.698 - 00:14:18.698, Speaker C: And I'm happy they have the business right now. I'm happy they have the revenue because they're going to need it to fight a lot of lawsuits and lobby and do a lot of different things to make the future of finance happen. But it's my hope that it trends the other way over time more towards giving yield to the ecosystem and consumers.
00:14:18.794 - 00:15:06.334, Speaker A: Did you guys read Coinbase's? Kind of almost call to actions, I guess I'd call them for builders, the four things that they wanted folks to build. No, what was so Coinbase launched base basically has like an ecosystem fund and they just put out the four things they want to see built. One was like, things that help enable safe for DeFi. Another was reputation. Another was like on chain limit order books. And then the last one was what they called flat coins, which are basically decentralized stables. And specifically they brought up we have a request for builders to go build decentralized stables that track that are like inflation hedged or track the growth of inflation, whatever you want to call it.
00:15:06.334 - 00:15:08.526, Speaker A: And yeah, I'm curious what you guys think about that.
00:15:08.628 - 00:15:42.618, Speaker D: Sounds like an amazing concept in concept, exceedingly difficult to execute. Mean to Vance's point, ondo exists. There are real world asset pools. Maple is a great example of this. A portfolio company, a framework. There are also on know, insurance pools that you can put money into that are like literally insuring tow truck drivers and crop insurance. There are ways to get yields that I think are interesting.
00:15:42.618 - 00:16:37.530, Speaker D: The problem is that you literally need to sign documents or do some sort of signature on chain such that you're effectively an LP in a fund. That doesn't work if you're not someone who can pass KYC. That doesn't work if you're not from the jurisdiction and frankly, just like doesn't work if you're an individual that doesn't want to sign LP documents. There is a need for KYC and all of the process around fund formation and the like. But the entire point is that there isn't really an opportunity to have someone access this product without effectively signing LP documents. Which is, and just to be clear, that's way different from, for instance, having a brokerage account where you can get access to these money market funds. That's way different from anything that we have on chain.
00:16:37.530 - 00:17:06.034, Speaker D: If you're using ondo finance, you literally have to effectively sign to be a qualified purchaser, which is a wealth threshold of $5 million. So there are high levels of access constraints that affectuate whether or not you can have access to this product even in DeFi. So I agree, it's awesome to conceptualize, but very difficult to have.
00:17:06.072 - 00:17:39.274, Speaker B: I've heard a couple of VCs say they're not necessarily fans of early stage companies holding their treasury in even something as safe as T bills. Just because you don't have an enormous amount of financial competence at an early stage company, and it doesn't happen super often, but if you held Treasuries, depending on the duration, in 2022 you might have lost 25% of your treasury. So I'd be curious what you guys just kind of think about holding Treasuries. What is treasury management supposed to look like for early stage startups?
00:17:39.402 - 00:18:18.246, Speaker C: Don't do that. Don't just hold your money in cash in a replay. This is my opinion, just to replay FTX. Okay, you're a startup, you had your money in FTX. What was the money doing in FTX? Well, we were trying to buy Euros because I had to pay people in Euros or we thought we could get some yield. It's like, okay, are you running a hedge fund? What are you doing? That's at least my perspective. I don't think the risk, the reward can really ever outweigh the risk if mission One is getting your product to market and keeping your team alive.
00:18:18.246 - 00:18:30.910, Speaker C: If you're the CEO of the company, you really have two jobs keeping the company funded and keeping everyone in line. And if you blow your company up because you put all your money in, I don't really care where that's your fault.
00:18:31.650 - 00:19:33.122, Speaker D: So one of the things I was going to add to this is a month ago I would have said absolutely 100%. That makes total sense. After the last month, everything we've seen with Silicon Valley Bank. Imagine replace FTX with Silicon Valley Bank and replace the situation that happened versus what could have happened, which is depositors don't get 100% of their money back or it goes into receivership and you have to fight for it over the next 24 months. The thing that I think is important to note is there is a very huge difference between $250,000 of FDIC insurance versus how much money your company probably needs to raise to be able to pay operations over the next two years, which is what you should have. There are cash sweep accounts, there are money market funds. You don't have to go off and buy T bills, but there are places where as interest rates ebb and flow, you're not going to lose value on the actual value that you have in your account.
00:19:33.122 - 00:19:47.558, Speaker D: And in fact, you probably will gain value. But I think keeping it in a money market fund is probably the best opportunity here, given everything that's going on, as crazy as it sounds in the banking center.
00:19:47.724 - 00:19:56.998, Speaker A: So then how do you grapple with the fact that a lot of the protocols that you guys invest in still hold a decent chunk of their treasury in their own native token?
00:19:57.094 - 00:19:59.670, Speaker D: Their own native token or USDC?
00:19:59.830 - 00:20:02.126, Speaker A: Their own native token? From what I've seen, yeah.
00:20:02.228 - 00:20:39.718, Speaker D: I mean, you kind of think of it as like operating expense versus incentive fund. You have USDC or you have cash stablecoins as the way to pay people and that's the salaries that are coming out every two weeks or whatever it is. And then you have tokens that are incentivizing the team, incentivizing the community to go off and be aligned with the rest of the community, with the rest of the protocol. And yeah, sure, a lot of Treasuries are denominated or effectively denominated in the currency that they have. But it's kind of like saying the employee stock option pool is denominated in the company stock.
00:20:39.814 - 00:21:02.190, Speaker B: That makes sense. That makes sense. All right, guys, let's talk a little bit about I know you guys flagged a report that was written this week on CBDCs that was by Citi and kind of the combination of that in real world assets or the sort of real world asset real estate tokenization trend. We've been seeing you guys talk a little bit about that.
00:21:02.260 - 00:21:45.774, Speaker C: I personally have a pretty negative view on CBDCs. I don't think we all have digital money in our bank accounts. Every time we use Apple Pay, every time you use a credit card, we have digital money already. The only reason why you would have a CBDC on the consumer payment side is to be able to have not only read permission, which the government already does, into basically every financial transaction, but also write access and be able to reverse things, to be able to block things, to be able to subtract money, to be able to add money. I personally just think that's a pretty slippery slope and I think it's pretty cool that Ron DeSantis banned CBDCs in Florida. Big shout out to him for realizing that this is probably not a path that we want to go down.
00:21:45.972 - 00:22:28.902, Speaker D: I think it becomes another veneer a layer of privacy control. Frankly, in my mind, we already have a CBDC and sure, it traded off Peg, but USDC is redeemable for a dollar as long as you have a bank account that can receive it. And in my mind that's really kind of the fastest, the best. It's also really interesting that Fed now is apparently launching in July. We'll see what that is and what that does, but I do generally think there is definitely going to be competition from the public sector that's coming to the private sector, which is Circle and USDC the expectation.
00:22:28.966 - 00:22:40.960, Speaker A: I don't know if you saw that if you guys dug into the paper, but I think the number they floated out was like 5 trillion of CBDCs circulating in the economy within seven years.
00:22:41.570 - 00:23:42.660, Speaker C: The one thing that I would say is an interesting use case for central bank. I don't know if it's like central bank digital currencies, but I'm going to tie the macro to the crypto. Like if you think about things like the TGA, which is the Treasury Journal account, or the RRP, which is the reverse repurchase facility, those things have trillions of dollars in them. And the Fed is trying to get this money through incentives to move into or out of these programs, or into or out of the banks, or into or out of the financial markets. And it all kind of seems like it's pretty manual and stuck together by duct tape. If you had all of these assets, say like the central bank issued all the T bill auctions on chain and had all those assets on chain and maybe they had read and write permissions, and maybe they could give people incentives to move into these places or penalize them to move out. If you assume that monetary policy is one of the most important things that the US is doing today, it kind of doesn't make a whole lot of sense that we're running on probably, like, 1960s technology.
00:23:42.660 - 00:23:52.630, Speaker C: So I think, like, central bank digital assets, not central bank digital currencies, are pretty interesting. Imagine if the RRD was on chain.
00:23:54.090 - 00:24:10.282, Speaker A: But then you're basically trading off efficiency. It's like, yeah, they improved the antiquated ACH system, obviously drastically. Right. Imagine there's another global health pandemic country shuts down. You're out of work. Government announces a stimulus plan. Same day stimmy checks could hit your bank account.
00:24:10.282 - 00:24:41.000, Speaker A: Like, yeah, that's a big improvement. But what you're trading off is privacy control and surveillance. Because in that same world, the government could then block your transactions. If you attend a protest that they disagree with, or even worse, they can shut down your entire account. If you post let's say you post on social media in favor of some riots or something like that, then they can shut down your account. And I think it's not that's why I think CBDCs have a potential to be one of the most dangerous things.
00:24:42.490 - 00:24:45.954, Speaker C: This is already happening, too. People are already getting financially deplatformed.
00:24:46.002 - 00:24:48.390, Speaker A: I'm like. Very anti CBDC.
00:24:50.490 - 00:24:51.670, Speaker C: He's the truth.
00:24:53.790 - 00:24:56.330, Speaker A: Are we starting that narrative this early? Vance.
00:25:01.870 - 00:25:13.360, Speaker C: The caucuses start in January. It's like seven months away. Once if DeSantis announces in the next couple of months, that's all people are going to be talking about for the next 18 months.
00:25:14.530 - 00:25:17.070, Speaker D: Once if he announces.
00:25:20.150 - 00:25:51.740, Speaker B: I was actually a little worried about we're moving our Das event to Washington, DC. And we've been kind of doing our I mentioned you guys a couple of times. We've been doing some research and talking to people down there, and it's been a little worrying to hear that what everyone wants to hear about and what people think are going to be relevant is going to be relevant. A year from today is CBDCs. And I would say the majority of people there view it as inevitable that it's happening on a relatively shorter time frame than I think most would be.
00:25:53.070 - 00:26:05.966, Speaker D: This news kind of flew under the radar, but I think it's one of the more interesting pieces of news over the last week. Did anyone see what happened with Matt Taibi the day that he went to go testify in front of Congress?
00:26:05.998 - 00:26:07.326, Speaker A: Yeah, the house arrest.
00:26:07.518 - 00:26:09.106, Speaker C: No, no, not a house arrest, but.
00:26:09.128 - 00:26:09.700, Speaker A: Like.
00:26:14.150 - 00:26:19.942, Speaker C: Some IRS agent rolled up to his house and left him, like, a note, which was like, call the IRS in the next four days.
00:26:20.076 - 00:26:42.570, Speaker D: Yeah, not just that. His existing tax returns were refuted. Basically, the IRS said over the last three years, the tax returns that you have, we're rejecting them, and we are reopening forensic audits into your tax returns. The day that he was supposed to go and testify in front of Congress on the Twitter files.
00:26:42.650 - 00:26:46.446, Speaker C: Imagine if they could automate that and just take all his money and just be like, sorry.
00:26:46.548 - 00:28:12.746, Speaker D: There is an executive control that I think cannot go understated here that we need to protect and this is the entire conversation around CBDCs? Yes, ron DeSantis, you know, pro anti CBDCs, but the fact of the matter is any sort of control left unchecked, I mean, who's going to be the one who regulates the CBDC? Who's going to be the one who actually controls whether or not these things and these powers can happen? Did you see the Twitter? Sorry? Not the Twitter, the TikTok proposal. And granted, it's a proposal that's not going to affect it's not going to go into effect 20 years imprisonment. If you access the application from a VPN, the Secretary of Communications, which is a new cabinet position that the President would appoint, an unelected person would choose a council of people beneath them to decide which application should be banned, which countries are foreign adversaries. How are we going to have any sort of checks and balances into that control? And there is a governmental overreach that I think is kind of the core to what CBDCs represent. But it's happening not just on the financial side, it's happening on the communication side as well.
00:28:12.928 - 00:29:04.406, Speaker B: You know, what I think is particularly dangerous about this is look at what's happening with regional versus big banks. There's already a natural economic trend that flows towards this anyway. Like our whole fractional reserve banking system is basically levered bond funds in a way, and those are inherently risky and they kind of blow up from time to time. And every once in a while, when these bank failures start, people are like, well, I should just be able to park my money in somewhere that I don't have to risk it getting losing my money. That should just exist as a product. And the benevolent, imagine a very benevolent kind of technocrat in charge of this and it's like, well, how could I give people what they want and also make my life easier? And that all roads lead to CBDC. Or even if it's not a CBDC.
00:29:04.406 - 00:29:35.774, Speaker B: I'd argue that there's not a gigantic difference in between a world where there's a CBDC by our definition versus the Fed. And like five or six big know, because that's just to use crypto terminology. That's just a base layer with one node and then a layer two with four or five. No, I don't know what the difference really is. I kind of agree. I think we're not that far away from a CBDC. And yeah, I find it extremely concerning.
00:29:35.774 - 00:29:40.886, Speaker B: I echo all those concerns that you made, Jason. It's a massive overreach, I think, from.
00:29:40.908 - 00:29:59.850, Speaker D: Government, just to be clear. We believe that there will be some sort of legislation that gets bipartisan support, therefore approved in the next call. It 18 months for stablecoins. We don't believe that there will be anything that happens in the next 18 months on CBDCs.
00:30:00.670 - 00:30:08.218, Speaker C: Oh, my God. The CBDCs are going to move at the pace of government. Like, how long have we been waiting for Fed? Now it's. Going to be a while until this is a reality.
00:30:08.314 - 00:30:28.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember we had a call with Christopher Jen Carlo, I think was his name, the CFTC chair. And like, when was that, Mike? We were talking about Das. I don't know if you were on that call. It was like mid 2020, and he was explaining to us how, like a tokenized US dollar is going to be built and how it's going to happen faster than we realize. And that was three years ago.
00:30:28.376 - 00:30:34.454, Speaker C: Yeah. The same people that brought you the Post Office are going to build this GBDC and it's literally going to go zero place.
00:30:34.492 - 00:30:36.658, Speaker A: I will say post office. Very impressive.
00:30:36.674 - 00:30:40.790, Speaker B: Post Office is pretty good about the DMV.
00:30:43.210 - 00:30:45.110, Speaker A: Post Office got kind of wild.
00:30:46.330 - 00:30:48.200, Speaker D: DMV estate bro.
00:30:50.290 - 00:30:51.742, Speaker C: Same difference to me.
00:30:51.796 - 00:30:52.640, Speaker B: I don't care.
00:30:54.850 - 00:30:57.680, Speaker D: Faster than you Expect means less than 25 years.
00:30:58.290 - 00:31:18.490, Speaker C: Yes, it's kind of interesting this week. We've both seen the CBDCs are too powerful for humans, and also the AI is too powerful. Humans echo sentiment. It feels like we're getting to this point where maybe we can't control all these power tools. Maybe these aren't good for so here's.
00:31:18.510 - 00:31:48.926, Speaker D: What I think is going to happen with CBDCs just to capstone this point. They're going to happen elsewhere. And the US is going to be probably one of the last places that would implement a CBDC. We're going to see test cases in South America, we're going to see them in Southeast Asia, we're going to see them in Europe, and those are going to be the examples that we use and leverage and identify to test and see. But it's not going to be something that happens in the US, at least for the foreseeable future.
00:31:49.028 - 00:32:23.660, Speaker B: I hope you're right. I don't know if I really tried to put myself in the shoes of a technocrat in charge of this stuff. It's very easy to say, I'm solving people's problems, I'm giving people what they want, and I get to make my life easier in the first place. And the thing that I would just say that's a little bit different this time than Jason, when you and I were talking to that person three years ago is banks weren't blowing up in that period of time, and that can hasten these sorts of solutions. It's a really elegant solution for solving the problem, in a way. Do you know what I mean? It gives people what they want and they get this thing that they really want.
00:32:24.830 - 00:32:50.210, Speaker A: I think what will speed it up is not the collapse of SVB and all that kind of stuff, but the narrative that the US is losing its global reserve currency status is not in the mainstream yet, but it will be in like a year from now. And I think if you go back and read that, the Gian Carlo paper that they wrote, one of the main points was that a CBDC would help the digital dollar remain the global reserve currency.
00:32:50.870 - 00:32:57.098, Speaker C: Fareed Zakaria was on CNN screaming bloody murder about how the US dollar was going into the tubes.
00:32:57.134 - 00:32:57.622, Speaker A: Really?
00:32:57.756 - 00:33:01.062, Speaker C: If CNN is covering it, it's already over.
00:33:01.196 - 00:33:07.746, Speaker B: I saw it on Hood Ratchet. Hood Ratchet News Instagram account anymore.
00:33:07.938 - 00:33:13.254, Speaker A: Mike, what is your content diet? You must have such a good content diet. Hood Ratchet.
00:33:13.302 - 00:33:16.294, Speaker B: Just a lot of zero headgeist, I like to say. Zeitgeist?
00:33:16.342 - 00:33:16.602, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:16.656 - 00:33:19.894, Speaker D: Did you know that CNN is not a top 20 news organization anymore?
00:33:20.022 - 00:33:27.086, Speaker A: Based on page? Based on total based on what Ron DeSantis told you or no, based on.
00:33:27.108 - 00:33:31.290, Speaker D: Total viewership across all their platforms.
00:33:31.450 - 00:33:36.740, Speaker C: It's all about newsmax now. True social.
00:33:37.430 - 00:33:44.740, Speaker B: Have you heard of this little gem called Bright Bart? I'd never heard of this, but really, I just found it on that. It's a little gem on the web.
00:33:46.010 - 00:33:49.590, Speaker D: We tried so hard not to make this a macro podcast.
00:33:50.090 - 00:33:53.590, Speaker A: 540,000,000 page views a month on CNN.
00:33:54.170 - 00:34:20.766, Speaker C: Good God. So if optimism and Arbitrum are like the canonical two L two S, and you're a successful application that builds on either of them and has a lot of success, why would you stay on that L two versus just building your own thing? Like Coinbase is the model for L two S going into the future just like these two big kind of monoliths with a bunch of L three S? Or as a project, would you prefer to be an L two?
00:34:20.868 - 00:34:35.826, Speaker B: I think it's a really good question. I don't really understand why? Yeah, I think that's already kind of happening with even the Op stack and Coinbase's decision to not launch as a layer three, but as their own competing layer two, I think says a lot.
00:34:36.008 - 00:35:31.574, Speaker C: I had a conversation with somebody today and they were like, these L two S are going to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. I was like, okay, how do we get there and what are the assumptions that you need for that to be true? And the crux of it is, do you eventually just want to own everything as an application? The few games that we're very excited about in terms of that are launching soon, that are high quality, that have a chance to bring on tens of millions of users. They want the whole stack. They want the DeFi, they want the mev from the transactions, they want the fees from payments that go back and forth. I'm increasingly convinced that it's A, going to be a different model than we think and B, just the pressures of people wanting their own L two S and the ability to just cross layer message and be wherever you want and access whatever you want. Any other L two is going to change the entire landscape of investing in this type of stuff. That's kind of what I was thinking about this morning.
00:35:31.692 - 00:36:42.898, Speaker D: It sounds reductive to say this, but I think it comes down to two variables. Number one, it's cost. And number two, it's essentially like feasibility. What is the layer two versus the app chain versus the layer three versus whatever infrastructure stack you're proposing? What does that enable versus the other options? When I was at Dropbox, one of the biggest things that we went through and Dropbox from 2007 2005, when it started until about 2014, was 100% based around AWS. Think of it as like cloud storage brought to you by Amazon Web Services. And one of the big things that the team went through in 2013, 2014 was, do we go off and build our own infrastructure to be able to, when Dropbox is down, pick up the phone and call a Dropbox employee versus an Amazon employee? There were so many different net present value calculations done. There were so many strategic analyses.
00:36:42.898 - 00:37:36.782, Speaker D: Ultimately, we moved in the direction of building our own infrastructure. Also, fun fact, you know, the fastest way to move that much data, you literally rip out the hard drives, put them on trucks, and drive them to a new data center. That's the fastest way to move that much data. The fact of the matter is, ultimately, the NPV positive analysis that was done was MPV negative when all was said and done, because Amazon just kept on getting faster, it kept on getting better, it kept on getting cheaper. There is an element where I think it really comes down to what is the infrastructure stack and what is the cost to build the application that it's hard to project out which L two, L three app chain is going to work? Which one of those models is going to be the best? But it really comes down to what do you need as an application and how much is it going to cost you?
00:37:36.836 - 00:38:20.694, Speaker B: I think you're right about that. I think one thing, we've talked a little about ETH and Cosmos on this podcast and this whole app chain thesis that got born kind of in Cosmos and has now migrated its way to ETH. And the game is all about execution. So I can totally see the kind of bull argument for what's playing out on arbitram and optimism. I do think, though, that one thing that crypto hasn't really had to contend with yet is users, frankly, to just be totally honest. And one different starting point, just having gotten in the weeds with a lot of people that are know, I'm not meaning to throw shade. It's just very different perspectives.
00:38:20.694 - 00:38:48.102, Speaker B: Like, people from the Ethereum Foundation tend to approach things from when you're designing an economic system like mev a lot of times, from the perspective of Ethereum, like, what does Ethereum the network need to be in order to be this decentralized, neutral base layer? But people in Cosmos approach things very differently and they say, like, what is the best user experience? And I actually think that ETH should be approaching it exactly the way that it is.
00:38:48.156 - 00:38:48.566, Speaker C: Now.
00:38:48.668 - 00:39:28.882, Speaker B: But that's not to say that there isn't another perspective. And after the job of building that neutral, censorship resistant base layer is done, there's an enormous amount of wood that needs to get chopped on just building for users. And I think a lot of teams will figure out, to your point, maybe Vance, these layer twos won't be worth hundreds of billions. They'll be worth a lot of money and they'll be able to raise a lot of capital. And they'll probably say to themselves, like, I'll recruit my own network of sequencers or whatever it is. I need to have 100% control over my product and my user experience. So I think there probably will be a lot of teams that go out and say that.
00:39:28.936 - 00:40:22.180, Speaker C: It just feels a little bit weird right now that it's like the L2 S that Arbitrum and Optimism have built are ostensibly what everyone will build in the future. And so that is probably not their real product. It's like these L3s S where you use Arbitrum or optimism to settle on. And I think that's the question you really have to ask these developers is it like, do you want that or do you want to build on ETH? Assume all the costs are equal? And I think that is going to be probably just a war of BD and bringing people on, or the branding of the chain itself. But it's unclear to me how it all resolves because congratulations, Optimism, arbitram, you've created amazing copy paste networks that we can just deploy for things like Base and for things like consumer app chains and stuff like that. So kind of hard to understand right now.
00:40:22.870 - 00:40:48.106, Speaker D: I think, Mike, you hit the nail on the head in that we've never had to build infrastructure for a mass of users. We've also never had to build applications for massive users. The whole model of everything that everyone has ever built in crypto gets thrown out the window the second that you go from thousands of users to millions of users. It's going to be really fascinating to see that transition single.
00:40:48.208 - 00:41:00.990, Speaker A: Mike, what are your updated thoughts on now that Arbitrum and stuff and optimism have pushed forward? This kind of like L3s narrative and app chains on ETH is becoming a thing. But then I know you were pretty bullish on Cosmos after that season.
00:41:01.410 - 00:41:34.300, Speaker B: People in crypto tend to make a lot of very technical arguments about stuff, and I understand there's good reason to do that. There's a lot of soft stuff that I think gets totally glossed over. Things like Brand, things like culture, that kind of thing. Ethereum built the culture that it needs to build. They are very, very focused on solving this problem that's I think actually not to be. I think it's important for the future of humanity. I think it is a good but they have a very specific mindset for how they approach designing systems cosmos just starts from a totally different vantage point.
00:41:34.300 - 00:42:15.030, Speaker B: They just have a different set of problems. Like, Ethereum now probably has built the winning chain that has the most momentum and consensus behind it. The question is, can you change the way the influential people in Ethereum think from, okay, we've built what we need to build here in terms of an economically neutral, credible system and start change to how we need to change to attract a whole bunch of users. And then Cosmos needs to they got to figure out the thing that Ethereum has perfected. They got to figure out economic security. They've got their own cold start problem to solve. They're converging on the same thing.
00:42:15.030 - 00:42:21.538, Speaker B: They just have different starting points. Ethereum's in the lead, that's for sure. But I don't know how it all.
00:42:21.644 - 00:42:39.854, Speaker D: Let me ask you this. If you have a million new Blockchain users, someone who has never touched a chain before, doesn't even know what MetaMask is, et cetera, where do you think they aggregate? What is the thought process? What's the mechanics of them getting?
00:42:39.892 - 00:42:46.340, Speaker A: I think they aggregate to whatever I don't think they aggregate to an Ethereum or something like that. I think they go to whatever application is the best application.
00:42:47.030 - 00:42:55.394, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. That was going to be my perspective as well, which is it doesn't matter which chain they're on. It matters which applications they're getting.
00:42:55.512 - 00:44:05.418, Speaker A: Driven towards Blockchain, I heard the most left bell curve, like Occam's Razor take of why someone chooses Cosmos versus building an L three on Ethereum. When I was in San Francisco and met some of these founders. Is it's kind of like starting your website with when we launched Blockworks, we started on Squarespace and then we went to webflow, and then eventually we built a full stack like web app. But only after in year four when we needed to service millions of users. And so what the founders were telling me, their thought process, they're like, oh, we're all just going to build on the Op stack or Coinbase Base or Arbitrum because they give us a full suite of developer kits. But they're like, that doesn't mean that in three or four years, if we're successful, if the ETH people like the Base and Arbitrum and stuff can't support us being able to build more and more of the stack, then we'll be forced to go to Cosmos just like Blockworks was forced to. Like, Webflow and Squarespace weren't able to give us what we wanted, so we were forced to go build our own thing, even though it's much harder to do that.
00:44:05.584 - 00:44:31.122, Speaker D: This exact effect is happening with Games right now. And I'd say games is the canary in the coal mine for maybe not millions of users, but like tens to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. They're trying to build on top of mainnets or L two S, and it's sort of like Main net. Okay, that didn't work. L two, like Polygon, maybe, but now they're like, okay, we need our own app chain. There's just no question.
00:44:31.176 - 00:44:33.582, Speaker C: Tell them why, Michael. Why do they need their own app chain?
00:44:33.646 - 00:45:21.422, Speaker D: The toss are prohibitive, but also, the blockchain itself is not capable of running that many concurrent transactions. If you have hundreds of thousands or millions of users concurrently, you either need to have almost zero interactions with the blockchain for that interaction. Like, you're playing the game, you win something great, this thing gets dropped into your wallet, blah, blah, blah. Whatever that blockchain interaction is, is a transaction that exists on chain. Well, if you have millions of concurrent users, that's going to be hundreds of thousands of concurrent transactions. That's just not going to work on a blockchain. So you either need to design the chain or design the game in a way that interacts with the chain in kind of a weird way, or you need to run your own infrastructure.
00:45:21.566 - 00:45:39.158, Speaker A: Yeah, there could be a sweet spot here. We're talking about it like it's black and white. There's a sweet spot between app specific, like an app chain and a roll up. Centric future could just be like Sovereign roll ups, which, I don't know, you.
00:45:39.164 - 00:45:55.486, Speaker B: Might have missed something. That exact spectrum was the whole point of last season. It's like L3s is on Ethereum on One over here, full Sovereign Cosmos app chains over here, and then in the middle is like, what Sovereign Labs is kind of doing, or Celestia or something like that.
00:45:55.508 - 00:45:57.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably the Celestia.
00:45:58.026 - 00:46:00.878, Speaker B: And there's honestly, that's probably why it.
00:46:00.884 - 00:46:03.694, Speaker A: Was in my head then. Yeah, because I remember you talked to Celestia guys.
00:46:03.732 - 00:46:12.722, Speaker B: A um, I find compelling reasons for each one of these. Just it's hard to know yet. It's hard to know yet.
00:46:12.776 - 00:47:00.370, Speaker C: Let me give you the biggest left of the Bell Curve take on just why ETH l One will continue to be dominant. All of these L2 S, which I generally think we have a consensus that even though the long term future is potentially uncertain, there are going to be massive, fully diluted valuation outcomes for these L2 S. They're all launching their tokens on Ethel One. Ethel One is like the Nasdaq of crypto. If you launch your token on some other chain, not to shit on Polygon, say you launch your token on Polygon, you don't have nearly the same access to whales, to institutions, to individuals that you would as on Ethel One. And so all the biggest assets are going to continue to be there. And I think over time, you build a real financial moat as a result.
00:47:00.370 - 00:47:07.134, Speaker C: Like, do you want to IPO on the Nasdaq, or do you want to IPO on the Belgium Southern Division?
00:47:07.182 - 00:47:08.334, Speaker B: Toronto Stock Exchange.
00:47:08.462 - 00:47:08.914, Speaker C: Of course.
00:47:08.952 - 00:47:12.018, Speaker D: You don't want to stop saving the TSX.
00:47:12.194 - 00:47:14.210, Speaker C: Hey, don't make fun of the TSX.
00:47:14.370 - 00:47:16.470, Speaker D: That is a stock exchange.
00:47:18.730 - 00:47:37.310, Speaker C: The TSX is the Toronto Stock Exchange. It's known for basically, like, back in the day, people would wildcat oil wells and kind of dig their own oil pits, and they would IPO these pink sheets on the TSX, and it was, like, wild and crazy. And Canada is pretty buttoned up now, but the TSX is still kind of like a degenerate stock exchange.
00:47:37.650 - 00:47:38.494, Speaker B: They keep it real.
00:47:38.532 - 00:47:39.230, Speaker A: Totally.
00:47:39.730 - 00:47:44.302, Speaker B: I didn't mean to disparage the TSX. There are about 15 companies that are super happy to be listed there.
00:47:44.356 - 00:47:45.760, Speaker C: Galaxy is listed there.
00:47:46.530 - 00:48:42.500, Speaker B: I know. I think it's like these are interesting debates to watch to watch play out. I don't know what actually, you guys got me thinking, by the way, about now that we're just talking about some of these things with brand. And so we had a podcast maybe like a month or two ago talking about, is ETH money? Is there a monetary premium there, or is Bitcoin going to win that monetary premium? And I still think that my opinion back then was bitcoin has this brand that's very easy to understand, and it's much simpler, I think. But I think it's a little bit more complicated than that because I think in an ideal world, the problem with bitcoin as the base money is that there's no elasticity to it at all. I actually think ETH's monetary design is much better. Like, it makes more sense.
00:48:42.500 - 00:49:34.642, Speaker B: But I also think putting it in the context of where we are in the world right now in the macro, I think things basically move in intense overreactions and then intense corrections to fix those overreactions. And the big problem with how everything works on the Fiat L one is that there are no checks and balances, and it's grown to this crazy growth and way oversupply of credit. And I think it overcorrects to Bitcoin, even though you guys kind of did make me think about it. And I kind of do think that the monetary policy of ETH is maybe better. But I still do think bitcoin ends up and bitcoin they're talking about exporting bitcoin or properties of bitcoin within roll ups. It's a way to export bitcoin timestamps to Cosmos chains to prevent reorg attacks. That's pretty interesting.
00:49:34.642 - 00:50:21.198, Speaker B: Like, one of the problems for a tendermint consensus is it's sort of vulnerable. There's instant, finality, but you're sort of vulnerable to these long range reorg attacks, which is why there's an unbonding period of I'm pretty sure it's 21 days in Cosmos. And that's a problem for liquid staking in Cosmos, where the way you're supposed to balance that out is through an arbitrage. If you have a 21 day withdrawal period, it just makes it very difficult to run that sort of trade. So if you could pay a little bit extra to ensure against a long range could, you could reduce the unbonding period and make it much easier, like, add a whole bunch of liquidity to that protocol, that's stride protocol in Cosmos, which is super cool. Shout out Aiden.
00:50:21.214 - 00:50:24.850, Speaker C: Mike, you're going deep, man. You're getting deep in the weeds of this, dude.
00:50:25.190 - 00:50:26.290, Speaker B: I've been deep.
00:50:29.990 - 00:50:34.200, Speaker A: Mike, tell us how much mev content you've consumed over the last, like.
00:50:38.750 - 00:50:42.778, Speaker D: Sister pod. It's been good.
00:50:42.864 - 00:50:46.540, Speaker B: I actually got to shout out, hasu he's been great?
00:50:47.150 - 00:50:47.894, Speaker A: He's a good dude.
00:50:47.942 - 00:51:02.880, Speaker B: Smart guy. Mev is one of those things where there's like, rabbit holes and then there's like, Alice in Wonderland rabbit holes and then there's it's just you can go so, so deep. And it's pretty complicated stuff, but it's good. It's been good.
00:51:03.730 - 00:51:05.870, Speaker A: Any takeaways from the mev learning?
00:51:05.940 - 00:52:08.086, Speaker B: So that I think that wallet right now, a lot of the discussion in mev is based around block space auctions, and people have been worried forever about centralization on the validator level, whereas really, what you're where you're going? To have to worry about. Centralization is around the wallet level and everyone's going to move to I think private order flow is probably inevitable. And then the way that MBB is going to get allocated is through order flow auctions instead of necessary. Block space auctions will still exist. They'll just be smaller and a less significant portion of mev. And I think that the worrisome layer for centralization is going to be wallets, probably, but you might actually get rebates for trading on these platforms because that's how there will be mev that's redistributed back to users to the point where you could sort of be getting paid to trade, which would be a cool user experience. Can we get a check on where you guys think we're at in terms of markets and whatnot? We got a handy chart here.
00:52:08.086 - 00:52:35.600, Speaker B: Shout out Garrett, who put this together. But it's been a very good start to the year for crypto in general, but because this is a macro pod, it looks a little dicey out there still for macro. So I know we kind of ask you guys this each week, but what are your sort of latest thoughts on where we're at?
00:52:37.890 - 00:53:16.858, Speaker D: We had a conversation yesterday with one of our core LPs for one of our first funds, and I think the salient quote from that conversation was and he's a reputable hedge fund manager from the has just seen markets over the last three, four decades. So just like, very well attuned to what's going on. And it's always great to talk with them and just get a sniff test of what's happening kind of broadly. He said that amongst the conversations that he's having, there are absolutely zero people that are bullish except for him.
00:53:16.944 - 00:53:58.134, Speaker C: He loves to get in the mix when things are looking dicey, and he's just seen this so many times that appreciate his perspective, but he's, like, basically the last and he's like in the New York circle of those types of people, but he's kind of the last bullish person. And I think that's kind of what you need for these things to, like I think we've largely seen the snapback rally just because we were so beaten down last year. But the real question is, where do we go from here? And not a whole lot of people believe the Bullish case, the Bearish case, is very easy to make. But I don't know, the bank stuff has kind of slowed down, it seems. Doesn't seem like we're going to be talking about that in a month.
00:53:58.332 - 00:54:27.810, Speaker D: I think the bank stuff has slowed down. So I think of it in terms of categories. If we take venture capital, you can separate that into growth, equity and sort of early stage. Early stage, I think, is pretty much limited from the exposure of what's happened over the last 18 months. Just given that you're investing in an earlier stage investment pace has slowed down entrepreneurship. A lot of people aren't jumping in to figure out what company they want to build. They're trying to fight for their jobs.
00:54:27.810 - 00:55:09.040, Speaker D: Growth equity, I think, is in a very troubled state. But we've known that literally since like middle of 2021 when everything started to hit the fan. The things that I think are relatively new are commercial real estate where you have $1.5 trillion of commercial real estate debt that needs to be refinanced by the end of 2023. The fact of the matter there is you've got hard assets. You also have sort of like this need to refinance versus not financing. There are elements where that could really blow up, that could really get bad.
00:55:09.040 - 00:55:37.074, Speaker D: The thing that I am tracking now, which has kind of been over the last couple of months just thinking about this, the one thing about commercial real estate is it's fixed rate lending. So all of the terms of those loans are generally fixed at whatever the interest rate was when they made those 710 15 year loans. The thing that is not fixed, that has gone skyrocketed.
00:55:37.202 - 00:55:38.490, Speaker C: Private equity.
00:55:38.990 - 00:56:30.738, Speaker D: And you think about taking the exact same concept, which is a company, you lever it up 5710 times where you're putting 10% equity down. That company then has to pay Libor plus 500 basis points. Libor plus 400 basis points. Those are usually the leveraged finance terms for how you're leveraging these companies. So you've got a simultaneous effect of, number one, growth and revenue prospects subdued and declining. Number two, you've got interest rate increases that are making it such that the debt service alone is the entire cash flow for the company. And so you kind of have this effect of Blackstone, Apollo and not specific to them or their portfolios, but the major private equity firms and the portfolios that they put together.
00:56:30.738 - 00:57:08.520, Speaker D: These companies are levered to the hilt and you've got increasing interest rates and decreasing growth. Something is bound to break at some point. And we're starting to see that obviously, with the Blackstone real estate portfolio that I think is a little bit more fickle than what I'm talking about. But you ultimately do have these companies that are just not going to be able to make their debt service. And what do you do when high yield debt at a corporate level gets blown out? Keep in mind high yield debt is superior to equity. Like what happens to the companies and the equity beneath it? There's a lot that's going on.
00:57:08.970 - 00:57:48.690, Speaker B: Yeah, the commercial real estate thing is interesting because first of all, it's so large and I actually heard there was a good amount of variable rate financing that happened for commercial real estate and they have fixed yield on the asset. Right, like the cap rate. And the other thing about commercial real, at least like offices, is that I think the jury is kind of out now that work from home hybrid work is going to be a thing forever. So these assets need to get rerated. So not only are you going to be underwater on the financing, but the assets themselves need to get rerated. And I think that's the problem.
00:57:48.760 - 00:58:13.578, Speaker C: My good friend is a commercial real estate developer in a major city and I was like, how does this work, this whole process? He's like, well, I've never repaid a loan, I've always just refinanced it. There's never been a time where he's had to I've borrowed x and here you go and there it is and it's paid off just like always revolving. And this is the Michael Howell thing. Exactly.
00:58:13.664 - 00:58:14.502, Speaker B: Got to get the role.
00:58:14.566 - 00:58:31.674, Speaker C: Exactly. And I was like, well, which banks are doing these know, pretty big banks, like bank of the like deutsche bank is in know these random banks I've never heard like I don't know anything about commercial real estate. I was like, this is going to be a disaster.
00:58:31.722 - 00:58:32.880, Speaker A: I'll call you and.
00:58:35.830 - 00:58:38.062, Speaker B: Know bank of the Ozarks.
00:58:38.126 - 00:59:00.200, Speaker C: Yeah, apparently they're deep in it. But I also went to a school, I came out of undergrad, I went to USC where the cool thing to do coming out of school was become a real estate cause. Like people think Los Angeles is the city of entertainment. It's really like the city of just like never ending sprawl and never ending developments. It's gonna be a rough one for that.
00:59:00.810 - 00:59:05.990, Speaker D: Also, we also graduated into a decade of zero interest rates.
00:59:06.150 - 00:59:18.000, Speaker C: Dude, when I graduated I was like, you guys are just printing money. How is it this easy? They're just like, yeah, you just build physical stuff and then people come in and they'll pay for it and you levered it up nine to one. Man, that sounds great.
00:59:18.610 - 00:59:31.042, Speaker A: Here's. The argument to this being like a huge catastrophe is that it's really not in the interest of cities to see a whole street of office buildings basically just completely wiped out.
00:59:31.096 - 00:59:33.090, Speaker C: Have you been to San Francisco recently?
00:59:36.550 - 00:59:43.538, Speaker A: I was on market, I went on market street and was going to walk to your guys'office and I was like, I'm getting an. Uber. This is you go to Market Street.
00:59:43.554 - 00:59:45.960, Speaker C: And you're like, something sinister has happened here.
00:59:47.130 - 00:59:51.498, Speaker A: What did that taco place next to Market Street? And I was like, you guys want.
00:59:51.504 - 00:59:56.934, Speaker B: To get the Jess? Guess what percentage of commercial real estate loans are held by small banks?
00:59:56.982 - 00:59:57.580, Speaker C: 70.
01:00:00.290 - 01:00:01.760, Speaker B: Yeah, 70%.
01:00:03.330 - 01:00:27.590, Speaker D: Guess what? Okay. I will say, like commercial real estate, there are five different categories that you could broadly put into commercial real estate. One of them is offices. A lot of the value is offices. So it's not like commercial real estate as a whole is getting screwed over. No, if you own warehouses right now, you're doing really well. If you own offices, it's a tough time.
01:00:27.590 - 01:00:56.842, Speaker D: But within offices, do you know what the entire United States vacancy rate is? And this isn't like we have a lease and we're paying it, but people aren't coming into the office. This is like zero leased office space. Do you know what that is? Hit the highest mark in history. 18.7%. One in 5 sqft in the United States of office space is unleashed.
01:00:56.986 - 01:01:06.850, Speaker C: Commercial real estate feels a little bit like crypto, where it was just like, anything goes for a full decade, and now it's like, okay, half of you are in trouble.
01:01:09.350 - 01:01:10.626, Speaker D: We just don't know which half.
01:01:10.648 - 01:01:50.990, Speaker A: Okay, so you guys want to hear? So there's going to be a weird second order impact of these vacancies, which is that there are all these green rules that got put in place a couple of years ago in Europe that said, if you're under a vacancy if you don't have let's call it like 80% vacancy in your place for two years at a time. You're not allowed to operate that building. And I think they just didn't think about this and didn't think about COVID Obviously those I have to look up those rules, but I remember those rules were put in place, I think in London, for example. So I wonder if you could see those going into effect. What do you do with the building?
01:01:51.060 - 01:01:54.160, Speaker C: Just like pack it up. Just like the EU demo.
01:01:57.190 - 01:02:07.140, Speaker A: This is what I was getting at before. You start to offer extreme the government starts or the city starts to offer extreme incentives to renovate the building or convert the building, that will work.
01:02:10.070 - 01:02:16.520, Speaker C: Just like make the office more open and put like a smoothie machine in. That's not going to get people to come.
01:02:17.050 - 01:02:18.978, Speaker A: I'd come in for some cold brew.
01:02:19.154 - 01:02:21.740, Speaker C: That's also a very European solution to that problem.
01:02:22.830 - 01:02:25.974, Speaker A: You guys are out here serving coconut water, so you guys get the incentive.
01:02:26.022 - 01:02:29.290, Speaker C: Game we got from Japan.
01:02:30.930 - 01:02:33.230, Speaker B: Flex on them, men of culture.
01:02:35.490 - 01:03:11.260, Speaker D: The line from our investor who we're referencing earlier was that he has never seen this in decades, but people are literally walking away from buildings. That means like, you own the building, the bank forecloses on you. And they're just like, all right, that's it, I'm done. I'm out. That means that every single person who works in the building, they don't have an owner, every lease terminated, every single person who's janitorial operations or has like a retail establishment in the building, potentially gone.
01:03:13.230 - 01:03:34.334, Speaker A: I was wrong about the green rules, basically, but I was right in a sense. It has nothing to do with the vacancy. It's that every like three or to five years you have to upgrade the building. And it's always just been like, oh yeah, we'll upgrade the building. But now there's no incentive to upgrade the building because no one's actually staying in these buildings. So it is London. London is already starting to do this.
01:03:34.334 - 01:03:45.646, Speaker A: I guess they started to do this six months ago. They're shutting down buildings because they don't meet the green standards, but there's no incentive to improve, to hit the green standard anymore.
01:03:45.758 - 01:04:01.500, Speaker C: Fire them into the sun. Like, imagine you're trying to make your office work and it's like not going according to plan. And someone's like in your ear talking about how you're not green enough because you didn't upgrade the building.
01:04:01.950 - 01:04:03.338, Speaker D: Can you give me 5 minutes?
01:04:03.424 - 01:04:28.654, Speaker B: You are not green enough. Oh my God. While we're on just random subjects here, do you guys see the announcement from Dune that they're integrating some form of LLM or whatever? So now you won't need to know SQL. You can just type in plain English what you want to see and you'll be able to pull that info.
01:04:28.702 - 01:04:32.046, Speaker D: Learning brutal for all those juniors.
01:04:32.078 - 01:04:55.626, Speaker C: Learning SQL is like learning cursive now. You really do not need it. And I had Token Terminal up on one computer yesterday and I had Chat GBT up on the other and I was like, man, I'm supercharged right now. And if I can just get Dun Analytics to work with just natural human language prompts, there's going to be a lot of genre analysts that are looking for something to do.
01:04:55.808 - 01:05:03.450, Speaker A: We all thought that white collar jobs were going to remain and the blue collar jobs were going to get crushed and boy, yeah, it is the opposite.
01:05:06.290 - 01:05:09.086, Speaker C: The creatives went first, we killed all the artists first.
01:05:09.188 - 01:05:17.342, Speaker B: Yeah, New Water is creatives go first, white collar second, and the third people are like the guys who weld your pipes and they're going to be living like kings.
01:05:17.406 - 01:05:34.518, Speaker D: I was having a conversation last week with the head of some game company here at GDC and he goes, yeah, we used to have a creative team of eight people. Now we use mid journey. Boom, gone.
01:05:34.604 - 01:05:45.654, Speaker B: Did you see that? Elon Musk called for a moratorium on AI research for six months. You never know with that. It got reported on in the Wall Street Journal and pulled the article.
01:05:45.702 - 01:05:51.126, Speaker A: But no, it wasn't just 10,000 or like 1000 AI big brains.
01:05:51.238 - 01:06:12.820, Speaker C: I'm worried about this stuff. I've definitely sat up a couple of nights and been thinking about AI and where it could go there is a non zero chance that something bad happens. I also think Elon might be talking his own book a little bit because I do believe he has a startup in this race somehow. Now. No, he didn't get funded or what happened to it.
01:06:13.670 - 01:06:14.146, Speaker D: He did.
01:06:14.168 - 01:06:31.020, Speaker C: It's called no, he's starting to know. It's called based AI or something. It's like something stupid, some dumb name. But what is this proposal? We stop, we all just put our hands up and go home.
01:06:34.110 - 01:06:35.050, Speaker D: Vacation.
01:06:36.830 - 01:06:42.860, Speaker B: When you're playing through some of these scenarios in your head, what are some of the things you find yourself? Because I've also done that.
01:06:43.410 - 01:07:24.700, Speaker C: The one that I was thinking about is like, okay, cool. The education system, which is totally broken now, if you can get the best tutor on the planet, it really is somewhat of an equalizer in that regard. But then I was thinking about if this machine knows everything and knows it to a more insightful extent than you could ever and it's better at everything, and it's faster at math, and it's better at writing, what's the point of you even learning? It is the new education. Be the best prompt engineer possible. That feels literally like a wage cage style scenario where you're just paid to press a button every 5 hours. I don't know. That was kind of the stuff that I was thinking about.
01:07:25.470 - 01:07:27.180, Speaker B: I have a more optimistic take.
01:07:27.790 - 01:07:30.780, Speaker C: Okay, what's the more optimistic take?
01:07:31.390 - 01:07:32.170, Speaker A: I'll tell you.
01:07:32.240 - 01:08:04.230, Speaker B: The optimistic take. You guys have probably heard these criticisms, right? America is falling behind in math. Like, these liberal arts colleges, they teach you nothing, and instead, really what we should be doing is teaching math and engineering, because those are where all the jobs are. Yeah. Again, the irony of this might be that those programming languages you don't need to learn, because a computer will learn that for you, maybe. At the end of the day, what this stuff still can't really do is reason particularly well. Like higher level reasoning, critical analysis.
01:08:04.230 - 01:08:12.518, Speaker B: Frankly, I think life would be a whole lot better if everyone was forced to take human history as a major. I think it would improve.
01:08:12.694 - 01:08:18.730, Speaker C: Should you still learn math in a world where Chat GBT exists?
01:08:20.510 - 01:08:23.850, Speaker D: Yes. Because how do you know that it's accurate? How do you know how to apply?
01:08:23.920 - 01:08:33.354, Speaker A: Vance. It's not just chat, GBT. We don't need to do math. You're not doing math every day. You can just Google. You can just type it in on a calculator. But it's still important to learn math.
01:08:33.402 - 01:08:45.810, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess it's important to learn things in order to be able to reason through them and be able to prompt this thing. But I don't know, it just feels like the human input is less and less valuable over time, and that's here.
01:08:45.960 - 01:09:03.560, Speaker A: Let'S go back 20 years or let's go back 30 years or something, and someone's like you're one day going to be able to search the Internet for literally anything, and it'll just answer it immediately for you. You'd be like, well, what? Why would we ever learn history if you could just search this stuff? And that's Google.
01:09:05.050 - 01:09:06.694, Speaker D: I viscerally remember?
01:09:06.892 - 01:09:14.842, Speaker A: I'm just trying to justify my history major here, guys. It's a liberal arts major trying to justify it to himself.
01:09:14.906 - 01:09:15.422, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:15.556 - 01:09:17.210, Speaker D: How much time do we have on the pod?
01:09:17.290 - 01:09:17.920, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:20.610 - 01:09:50.102, Speaker D: I visually remember I grew up in Palo Alto in the visually remember Google happening and being like, oh, great, now all our kids are just going to Google their homework. No, okay. You can use Google as a tool to do your homework just as everybody does, and everybody did. But it's not like it's going to do your homework for you. You still have to be able to reason. My personal perspective is the reason why you go to college. The reason why you study something is not to learn that subject.
01:09:50.102 - 01:10:22.942, Speaker D: It's to learn how to learn it's. Just like you're using that subject matter as a placeholder to be able to understand how to reason through things so that when some technology comes along and it's like, okay, great. This now gets 20%, 50%, 100% easier. You can actually use it, but you know how to reason. Like the history major or personally the economics major, classics major. It's not like I'm using that every day. Well, maybe more so than history or classic Jesus.
01:10:23.086 - 01:10:29.800, Speaker A: I remember walking downstairs into the basement, it's like 04:00 A.m., and Mike's just like, reading the Iliad. Like locked in, tapped in.
01:10:30.730 - 01:10:33.160, Speaker C: You guys are just finger painting the whole yeah.
01:10:34.490 - 01:10:38.662, Speaker A: What are you doing, budy? He's like translating the iliad. Let's go.
01:10:38.796 - 01:10:51.134, Speaker B: That was like, a huge portion of my college experience. Like translating yeah, like the like, Aristophanes and these, like, ancient Greek texts. That's like my college experience, so I put that to use every day, obviously.
01:10:51.332 - 01:10:54.240, Speaker C: Where are the rest of your classics major colleagues today?
01:10:55.730 - 01:10:56.494, Speaker A: Couldn't tell you.
01:10:56.532 - 01:10:57.840, Speaker B: There were nine of us.
01:10:59.090 - 01:11:12.930, Speaker A: The history department at Emory got defunded full 17 of us. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I'm bullish AI.
01:11:13.830 - 01:11:20.770, Speaker C: I think it'll be bullish on all the crypto people. You have to reach AI first, too. Like, the crypto people are going to get superpowered by this first and foremost.
01:11:20.850 - 01:11:41.340, Speaker A: Because everybody's going to get super powered by this. And also, once you put a new technology out into the world, you can't pull it back. And that's why this open letter is a stupid thing. It's like when we invented the printing press, it's like everyone was scared about commoners getting access to books and being able to read the Bible for themselves.
01:11:42.590 - 01:11:44.926, Speaker D: Whoa, whoa, whoa. They don't know how to read that.
01:11:45.108 - 01:11:46.640, Speaker C: Look at where it got us.
01:11:48.130 - 01:11:50.734, Speaker B: Church had a pretty thing. They had a good thing going for a long time.
01:11:50.772 - 01:11:52.350, Speaker A: Yeah, they honestly did.
01:11:52.500 - 01:11:58.820, Speaker C: General ability to read really kind of did not do them a good service, but did not.
01:12:00.230 - 01:12:02.946, Speaker B: People started asking questions that they were.
01:12:02.968 - 01:12:03.922, Speaker C: Not prepared to answer.
01:12:03.976 - 01:12:05.060, Speaker B: Prepared to answer.
01:12:05.990 - 01:12:11.986, Speaker C: I don't think people are going to stop building AI. I kind of think this is going to fall on deaf ears.
01:12:12.178 - 01:12:51.154, Speaker D: So we've gone down the rabbit hole in a couple of different ways on just like AI concepts. From a venture investing perspective, the thing that is undeniable is that there are hundreds of thousands of people, individuals, who are on these betas or on these waitlists. There is such a thirst for being able to test out these different tools, to be able to try these different systems. I think, sure, crypto will be an early adopter just because it's crypto and we're the earliest adopters of everything. But there's so many people that just want to play with this stuff that are going to experiment with it.
01:12:51.192 - 01:13:02.438, Speaker A: It's the fastest growing user base in the history of any product in the world. It's the best launch in the history of any consumer product. It's the fastest growing. Everyone wants to use this stuff.
01:13:02.524 - 01:13:03.014, Speaker C: Crazy.
01:13:03.132 - 01:13:04.914, Speaker A: This is why we need WorldCoin.
01:13:05.042 - 01:13:07.080, Speaker D: I'm sorry, how did you tie that together?
01:13:07.930 - 01:13:09.430, Speaker A: You don't know the thesis?
01:13:10.330 - 01:13:10.982, Speaker D: No.
01:13:11.116 - 01:13:13.654, Speaker C: No one man should have all that power, you know?
01:13:13.772 - 01:13:15.090, Speaker B: All right, this is a fun one. Cheers.
