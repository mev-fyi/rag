00:00:00.250 - 00:00:08.640, Speaker A: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:11.170 - 00:00:54.538, Speaker B: Like the point of a token to some extent, and this is not legal or financial advice, but it's to some extent like allow you to not have to distribute any share of earning things but always have some sort of ability to say you have a claim to it indirectly. But I think the idea of businesses that actually don't want to have a token so the two ones that I think of most prominently for this are like Flashbots or Eigen layer. You do actually need to distribute cash because you don't have any way for people to speculate on the future cash flow of your thing.
00:00:54.624 - 00:01:13.922, Speaker A: Huge shout out to our sponsor Reserve. If you don't know Reserve, we're going to talk more about them later in the show. But Reserve is the easiest way to design, deploy and govern stablecoins, backed by a diverse set of assets with access to DeFi, yield and insurance. Super interesting. Very excited to partner with Reserve. You'll hear more about them later in the show. Should we get into it?
00:01:14.056 - 00:01:15.058, Speaker C: Let's get into it.
00:01:15.144 - 00:01:32.314, Speaker A: All right, see you on the other side. All right, we have a new episode of Bell Curve today we are recording with Tarun. Hopefully you're not watching on video because Mike is not looking his best today. So I would recommend this one on Apple or Spotify would be preferable for this one. So Mike, what are we talking to Tarun about here?
00:01:32.432 - 00:01:58.770, Speaker C: Correct. I do have a face for radio, so we're talking to Tarun all about Dao Treasury management. So the reason why this is coming up know one of the key talking points when it comes to Dao governance is how these DAOs should manage and allocate their treasury. So Tarun is going to lay out basically a couple of frameworks for how he thinks about treasury management, like what kind of phase. One, two, three. We even get to 4.0 of what Dow Treasury management should look like.
00:01:58.770 - 00:02:11.794, Speaker C: He's also got a new product, Ara Finance, which basically helps Dows manage their treasuries. So we get into all about the definitions of what it means and we ask him some of the tough questions about how Dows should be managing their treasuries. It's a great episode.
00:02:11.842 - 00:02:25.274, Speaker A: Yeah, really good episode. For those who don't know Tarun, he runs Gauntlet and Gauntlet is basically a risk manager for protocols. So really hands on with a bunch of different protocols and has seen a lot of the treasury management issues that have cropped up over the last like twelve months.
00:02:25.312 - 00:02:28.086, Speaker C: He's also got the best style in crypto. Hands down best style.
00:02:28.198 - 00:02:34.522, Speaker A: I think he's wearing a kimono for this episode. I was like, great shirt. He's like, it's not a shirt, it's a kimono. So I mean, who does that?
00:02:34.576 - 00:02:38.320, Speaker C: Who does that? I don't know, man. Guys with better style than me, I'll tell you that.
00:02:38.690 - 00:02:40.302, Speaker A: That's not saying much, but that's okay.
00:02:40.356 - 00:02:55.630, Speaker C: No, it's not. It's an extremely low bar. Basically laid the bar on the floor for Tarun to hop over there, but he does it with grace. All right, let's get into the episode. There's been an update. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Today, Jason and I are joined by Tarun Chitra.
00:02:55.630 - 00:02:57.074, Speaker C: Tarun, welcome to the show. Hey.
00:02:57.112 - 00:02:57.954, Speaker B: Excited to be here?
00:02:57.992 - 00:03:08.802, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks very much. All right, so we're going to be talking about a pretty hot topic in crypto, which is Dao Treasury Management. I think there are a lot of misconceptions about how Treasuries are supposed to work in sort of Dao.
00:03:08.866 - 00:03:11.866, Speaker A: Is that really a hot topic right now? Is that the hottest topic of in.
00:03:11.888 - 00:03:14.060, Speaker C: My mind it is. In my mind it is.
00:03:15.150 - 00:03:17.930, Speaker B: We could say the hottest on chain topic.
00:03:20.350 - 00:03:42.082, Speaker C: For the on chain maximalists out there. We're all thinking about this. I think there are a lot of misconceptions about what this might mean. So, Trin, maybe could you actually just give the audience sort of an overview of when we talk about Treasury Management, maybe as it traditionally looks like in a more corporate environment, what does that function kind of mean? And then we can transition into what do Treasuries look like in Dow land?
00:03:42.136 - 00:05:02.300, Speaker B: Yeah, for I mean, I think just generically, right? When you think about the function that, say, like a CFO or head of accounting or anyone who didn't work at FTX kind of did. Given that it seems like there was no one doing this, there a lot of what they do is they take in the cash flows that are coming in and the accounts payable going out and they have to figure out how to manage that money. So maybe sometimes it's like if I'm Treasury Management for, say, like someone manufacturing physical goods involves basically figuring out how to you might be getting one really big payment when I deliver the chips or I deliver a house or whatever, but I need to somehow manage my cash flows before that. And that might mean basically borrowing, or it might mean holding excess cash in bonds because I need the yield. It might also mean that I need to think about liabilities I have, like, holding out money for interest payments and things like that that I have. So that's like sort of the most bare bones thing that every business that is a business that ever has cash coming in, money going out has to think about that's. Like the basics of 101 treasury management now, software is sort of different.
00:05:02.300 - 00:06:21.442, Speaker B: And in a lot of ways that's sort of the reason I think, for instance, private equity firms didn't invest in software until the 2010s is because they didn't understand how to think about how to manage those treasuries couldn't figure how to do that. And software is interesting in that you get these kind of like subscription like payments where you might get a bunch of them and it's sort of growing. And if you're thinking about how to manage that treasury you have to think about a should I be diversifying? B should I be investing in new products? C should I be buying back stock or issuing dividends? And so there's sort of this interesting trade off of how much do you invest in future growth versus how much do you invest in sort of financial management of your portfolio versus how much do you sort of give back to existing investors. And so that's, I would say Treasury Management 201 is that you have those three functions. You have to think about how to manage those. It can be hard. And I think in the 2015 to 819 range there were tons of companies, there are fintech companies that were trying to basically do treasury management for startups because usually you had to be a big enough company for it to be worth hiring someone, paying the financing costs, having the banking relationships.
00:06:21.442 - 00:07:20.402, Speaker B: Things like, you know, companies like modern treasury were sort of like fintech companies built around giving startups access to the same type of tools. And then I think the final thing, the hardest type of treasury management is when you're an exchange or a financial asset purveyor like a bank. Because you have to think about money that's coming in. That's technically income to you money that's other people's money that you're holding and managing and you can't treat that as your treasury and then liabilities of things you're lending out and basically giving people some types of loans on and that's sort of the hardest type of management. I would say that DeFi protocols kind of fall in the last camp. Other parts, other types of Dows are probably closer to the middle camps. They're a little bit like tech companies but broadly speaking you have this pool of capital.
00:07:20.402 - 00:07:37.680, Speaker B: You have these cash flows coming in, cash flows going out and you need to figure out how to allocate to future growth, sustainable management and then also servicing debt, servicing liabilities. Those are like the top three things. So I know I went through like a hierarchy of things but hopefully that gives us some grounding to talk about it.
00:07:38.450 - 00:07:54.466, Speaker C: No, I think that's great. So maybe if I could just summarize what you talked about there. Treasury Management 1.0 at its most basic form is just manage your cash flows, make sure you have enough on the finance. The financing part of the business should basically support the operational part of business. You don't want to run out of money. Then maybe 2.0
00:07:54.466 - 00:08:46.246, Speaker C: which is more applicable to software. There's a little bit more of a capital allocation question that goes into it, right? Which is how do you balance kind of investing in future growth or maybe like returning cash to shareholders or looking at what are the different opportunities you have for managing or allocating your cash. And then there's even like a third complication when it comes to fintech or DeFi and banking, which is like you sometimes have assets on your balance sheet which technically aren't yours. Right. So maybe the most obvious case, just because you referenced FTX before is sort of customer deposits. But maybe if that's Aave or Compound, those are your pools, right, and those aren't really owned by the platform, but you're sort of responsible for them. Is that maybe kind of an accurate yeah, so maybe let's talk a little bit about how do you think about kind of that solving that 2.0
00:08:46.246 - 00:09:10.730, Speaker C: part of things? And how are Dows right now kind of trading off? They've got this big pool of assets often that's in their sort of native token. And what do those kind of conversations look like? Are they sophisticated conversations from the most part about managing cash flows and investing in future growth versus not? Or what are some of the internal discussions about treasury management from your perspective sort of look like?
00:09:10.800 - 00:10:19.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the case studies in a lot of ways are the things that failed and then looking at sort of what would have happened counterfactually had they actually been able to sell part of their treasury. The Sushi swap case where they tried to sell Sushi for dollars, sushi was at like six or $7. I think it might actually be more. But last time I did this calculation, it was like if had the vote passed, the Dow would have had $60 million, which is much more than it has now to spend on sort of operations. And most of the reason for that was that people who were how does a Dao spend money? Well, people who own the Dao tokens have to vote on having the Dao, one of the larger owners of those tokens, sell its tokens for ETH or USDC or some other asset. And there's obviously very bad incentive if you're trying to say, hey, use this token to vote on selling the asset you own. So like, I'm voting with this asset, I'm voting on making its price go down.
00:10:19.220 - 00:11:23.960, Speaker B: That's already always going to be a little bit of an incentive misalignment in a lot of ways. So I think because of that, you really need to think through how Dows are supposed to incentivize things. Right now, I think the majority of Dao spending that is not on people who are direct service providers like auditors or people like my company Gauntlet or others in that world is via grants. And the grants are sort of like a community pool. And then people in the community, the community votes on sort of a grants committee and then the Grants committee distributes money. That's the only way these Dows are funding growth. I think uniswap, in particular, some of them have funded charitable donations, I think especially around the Ukraine invasion time and also in Uniswap's case they donated to this lobbying group called the DeFi Education Fund.
00:11:23.960 - 00:11:51.242, Speaker B: But more or less I think the conversations around how to spend this money are pretty unsophisticated. Although everyone now realizes they should have been having those conversations nine months ago. So I think the reason this is such a hot topic is everyone has buyers or lack of buyers or they have remorse for not being a buyer or seller.
00:11:51.306 - 00:12:26.940, Speaker A: Strikes me that the two big issues today are one is just that the community manages that. There's a community of a protocol, they own the tokens. So let's use Ave for example. Ave has a bunch of Ave tokens. I don't know the exact scenario at Ave. I'm just going to make this up and use Ave as the example here. Sorry Stani, but Ave has a bunch of need to the proper treasury management solution would be to hold your treasury in something like USDC in a stable US dollar coin, something like that.
00:12:26.940 - 00:12:43.234, Speaker A: But then you have a bunch of people who don't want the price of Aave to go down. So if Ave comes out and says hey we're going to sell a bunch of Ave, the community basically freaks out because they want to see the price of Ave go up not down.
00:12:43.272 - 00:12:43.426, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:43.448 - 00:13:18.682, Speaker A: So that's the first big problem. And then the second problem is that you are basically trying to optimize for decentralization and you're doing capital management around. Capital management is really like a one or two or three person game. A lot of hedge funds, a lot of VC firms are managed, a lot of capital allocation, even CFOs, those are usually pretty small teams. They're like two or three or four person teams. But we're trying to basically keep decentralization the D in the Dow but that doesn't really work for capital allocation. It seems like those are the two biggest problems.
00:13:18.682 - 00:13:20.170, Speaker A: Would you agree with that turn?
00:13:20.240 - 00:13:58.422, Speaker B: I think the third problem I'd add to that is that Dows don't have good KPIs for what their treasury management strategy should be. It's not like they are like okay, our Treasury Management strategy is like we want to invest in growth at all costs. If they did that then that would be great. Even if that might not work out and the Dow dies, at least having a clear goal like that makes a lot of sense. Or like hey we want to be conservative and earn yield but in a very conservative manner. Or hey we want to be risky. And one thing to remember if you think about it is Dows are supposed to be online native institutions.
00:13:58.422 - 00:14:39.894, Speaker B: Institutions like a BlackRock in a lot of ways, right? They have a bunch of capital, whether it's sort of capital as equity or capital as dollars and they need to deploy it. But anytime they deploy it they actually cause other people to go trade against them or chase it. So there's always some adverse selection. But their goals are not necessarily to just maximize return because in a lot of ways that's actually quite hard for them to do in a decentralized way. Right? So I think the idea that Dows are institutions, and in the normal world, institutions have very complicated and not obvious goals in a lot of ways is extremely important to keep in mind.
00:14:39.932 - 00:14:40.086, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:40.108 - 00:15:27.042, Speaker B: It's like, why do pension funds invest in venture, right? In theory, that's because part of their goal is diversification. Also part of their goal is to fund things that other people won't fund because you get locked up for five to ten years and there's some premium for that and you're a pension fund, so your time horizon is like 30 years. And so I think there's a lot of stuff like that that Dows have. I think their thoughtfulness and care and deciding on that first will help you figure out how to do steps one and two. And right now, Dow's goals with their Treasuries are very unclear for the most part.
00:15:27.176 - 00:16:20.280, Speaker C: Do you think? Know, we had Derek and Larry from Reverie on one of our earlier episodes and they wrote this great piece musings on governance and they had a couple choice words. And we actually talked about very briefly at the end of our episode with them about recommendations on treasury management. And they had a very pointed recommendation for Dows, which is that Treasuries are not hedge funds or endowments. They're not supposed to be run in the same way with the same objectives. And sometimes you see these discussions on forums and you do get the sense that you're trying to maximize a financial return because you have this pool of capital. So again, just maybe being a little bit prescriptive for some of these dows, like if someone's sitting there and maybe either you're a contributor to a dow or you have some say in terms of how treasury gets managed. Maybe through the Grant program, maybe in some other way.
00:16:20.280 - 00:16:33.370, Speaker C: How would you talk to that person about how you should be thinking about even if you don't get rock solid KPIs tomorrow, how should you change your thinking a little bit from managing a pool of capital like a hedge fund to how treasury is supposed to function?
00:16:33.520 - 00:17:47.300, Speaker B: I'm not sure about the endowments comparison because endowments are, first of all, not one size fits all. Right, MoMA's, endowment invests in things, not for financial return often, right? Because it has an institutional goal of supporting art via its endowment on top of the goal of institution. So I think throwing endowments under the bus maybe is like, okay, fine, ivy League school endowments are one thing, but there are other endowments in the world that are still hundreds of millions or billions of dollars that have social missions or fund a nonprofit or things like that, which are closer, hopefully in spirit to a Dow. And in that scenario, those institutions do have sort of some cultural goals of the ethos of the institution that needs to show through in what they are actually doing, which I think these grants committees are trying to do. I'd say that's like the de minimis thing they're trying to do is basically figure out what the cultural values of this community are and distribute based on that. Of course, the problem is most of those cultural values still have some financial portion in this industry. There's sort of no getting around that.
00:17:47.300 - 00:19:03.914, Speaker B: But I think for DeFi protocols in particular, their Treasuries should really be thought of as bank balance sheets. And that means that you need to be careful about insurance costs or how much you can cover liabilities of users in your protocol and also the trade off between how much of your treasury you're willing to make a capital buffer so that you can offer more competitive products like higher interest, higher amounts of margin, or higher amounts of risk. And those trade offs are extremely financial. I would say in those cases you actually do need to think of it a bit more like a bank. I wouldn't say it's a hedge fund or an endowment, but you really need to think about management the way a bank thinks about assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. And in particular, you need to think about it in a way that doesn't get you to insolvency. Arguably, the Mango markets hack shares some sort of abstract similarities with the insolvency at FTX in the sense that they had a token that was worthless backing most of its insurance fund.
00:19:03.914 - 00:20:15.120, Speaker B: And so the insurance fund was very easy to make insolvent via price manipulation on top of being able to be borrowed against. So it's sort of like actively managing your treasury to ensure that if there is leverage against your equity, in the same way that you could try to have leverage against a bank equity and go short on it around a capital crisis, is extremely important to maintaining the safety of your protocol, even if you are. The number one benefit of DeFi is in traditional finance banks, corporate debt structure is such that if they went bankrupt, the customers are not guaranteed to be first in line. Like debtors might be first, preferred, shareholders might be first, et cetera. On the other hand, in DeFi, the core tenet is that the customer is always the first one allowed to exit, right? You can always withdraw from the protocol. However, whenever you use your own governance token as a lending asset, or in the case of Mango, they just didn't optimize their parameters. Like when Mango's price goes down 90%, you shouldn't allow people to get the same leverage on Mango as you do sol.
00:20:15.120 - 00:20:53.958, Speaker B: It is very similar to FTT in that way, and I think this is one of those things where you do actually have to think about a DeFi protocol's treasury as an insurance fund and insurance funds need management. There's just kind of no way around that. But I do agree for DAOs that are not purely financial instruments like maybe like a game Dao or NFT, Dow, they definitely have more of this quality of like what's the cultural values that we want to imbue in our treasury, in our spending of our treasury, and how do we kind of do that safely?
00:20:54.054 - 00:21:49.822, Speaker C: Do you see let's use the example of something like Aave or Compound or this would be like what a bank looks like as well, right? There's a balance sheet there where you have assets and liabilities. Even for something like Coinbase, you'd have customer deposits show up as an asset, but that's not something you can necessarily use. Do you think that's in what sense is that a liability of the protocol and how should that inform your treasury management? Right? Like let's just use the example of a hack or something on Aave. It hasn't really happened yet, but you could make the case that Aave shouldn't necessarily be responsible. It's a software. I would probably make the argument that Aave should compensate users if a pool is compromised, basically. But how do you kind of think about those assets that are not technically owned by the protocol or Dow? And how does that kind of build into or factor into the treasury management strategy that you select?
00:21:49.956 - 00:22:40.634, Speaker B: This has happened on Compound. Actually, I guess we can start with Compound first. So I think in December 2020 there was this thing where the chain link Oracle sorry, the Compound Oracle, because they had a separate Oracle at that time was manipulated and a bunch of loans got defaulted because die was marked at a dollar $0.30, but it was actually basically a dollar. And basically what happened was people went through governance and then the protocol eventually compensated people for those losses. In Aave, there's an explicit version of this, which is the Ave safety module. Now in the bull market, comp and Aave prices were high enough to support actually being real coverage.
00:22:40.634 - 00:24:01.050, Speaker B: Right. But the problem is, without active treasury management, the liabilities of the protocol can change. Arbitrarily right. Like anyone can come and take a loan and create a liability for the protocol, but the assets aren't being rebalanced. And that's sort of the key, is that without some notion of active management, you may actually have assets that suddenly decrease when your liabilities increase, which is the worst thing to have happen because if your asset values are plummeting, right, when your liabilities are growing, you basically can't cover what's there. And this type of shortfall event, whether it's FTX, whether it's Mango, whether it's other protocols, can happen if you're not managing A, the sort of amount of leverage and the risk parameter of the system, but also B if you're not managing the treasury very carefully. And in the case of Avian Compound, between having a risk manager who's conservative, but also basically not really offering crazy leverage in other ways and not allowing you to rehypothecate their token too much, like borrow against their token they were able to effectively escape pretty much unscathed.
00:24:01.050 - 00:25:29.318, Speaker B: And I guess my point is these treasuries are part of that story, right? If you do want to get to the point where on chain protocols for perpetuals or lending can achieve the same capital efficiency as an off chain protocol like a centralized one, you have to have some way of having a capital buffer that is able to make sure that assets are always greater than liabilities. That boils down to treasury management. So this might seem like a nuanced thing, but I do think that if we want to get to the world where there's more volume and perps on chain or in a layer two, like dYdX, which I'd call sort of in the middle of pure DFI and not, you really need to actually get good at treasury management. That's the key. And the other important thing, and this might be the ultimate time to emphasize this goal, is that the transparency of DeFi means that you can have infinite comfort in both proofs of liabilities, like how much the protocol is actually giving out in leverage and proof of assets. And one of the things that's a little bit of a LARP right now is a lot of the proof of reserve stuff. It's basically asking someone to be a third party auditor to say like, okay, these are my wallets, I've signed transactions from them.
00:25:29.318 - 00:26:08.434, Speaker B: Here's proof that I control the private key. And then them just saying like attesting, that's your address. But that doesn't mean they've shown you anything about their liabilities. In fact, their off chain liabilities who you know, in the FTX case is the like, even if they did proof of reserves, you never have seen that loan. Honestly, you need proof of reserves plus proof of liability. Proof of liability is really hard. I think one interesting thing is a lot of times when you talk to exchanges about proof of liabilities, they don't include a lot of liabilities that they have on their balance sheet that they don't think about.
00:26:08.434 - 00:27:25.494, Speaker B: For instance, Binance, for instance, helps you put customer funds into BSc protocols. So like putting money into Venus or Pancake swap, if there was a hack, kind of like the bridge hack, those assets are technically went from customer assets to liabilities because Binance has to get them back, right? The proof of liabilities that most people call proof of liabilities does not include things like that, especially around hacks. And in DeFi, that's the opposite. You do really know the full loan book at all times. You know what Aave and compound's exposure is always and I think that should be the gold standard, right? Obviously we have a long way to go to get the efficiency of that to be equivalent. But the reason it's the gold standard is the proofs of liabilities and assets are built into the protocols and zero knowledge proofs plus DeFi will be obviously the mechanism design is not complete in that world yet, but the moment that actually works, you should be able to get close to CFI with active treasury management. Active risk management and an ability to preserve some privacy.
00:27:25.494 - 00:27:28.010, Speaker B: Because I think privacy is still extremely important.
00:27:28.160 - 00:27:28.618, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:28.704 - 00:28:33.182, Speaker A: One thing I can't help but thinking about so earlier at the beginning of the show you mentioned Treasury Management 101 is like making sure you have enough cash to service the business. 201 is starting to get into dividends and share, buybacks maybe some M and A, things like that. 301 is basically when you're like a bank and you have to separate customer deposits versus your own balance sheet, things like that. There's also, I'd say maybe like 401, which is what we talked about over lunch last week of if you're united, for example, and you have to hedge out the risk that oil might go up or something like that. Or it's kind of like what Fortune 500s do with their balance sheet, right, which is hedging out commodity risks usually. It does sound like when I think about all of the startups that we know, really what they do is Treasure Management 101, let me make sure that I have enough cash in the bank to service my business. But now what you're telling me is you have all these startups that are 1020 30 person startups that need to become really adept at doing Treasury Management.
00:28:33.182 - 00:28:35.300, Speaker A: 401 am I.
00:28:37.990 - 00:29:32.706, Speaker B: Crypto projects? Makes you actually skip. You don't actually even need 201 because you don't really care about M and A or dividend go straight to 301 basically. So yeah, the 401 piece is actually the most important part in the normal financial markets. And this might be the point where I sort of probably disagree with Larry and Derek a little bit is that institutions have a role in making markets more functional and liquid, not necessarily in the same way that a hedge fund you know, for instance, let's say I'm an institution, i, for some reason, ended up buying a bunch of airline stocks. And airline stocks are just anticorrelated to gas prices. So I start buying gas futures with the idea that, hey, I'm hedging some of that exposure. If gas costs go up, my airline stocks go down.
00:29:32.706 - 00:30:00.646, Speaker B: But at least I still own some exposure to gas and oil. The thing is, most institutions that do that type of stuff don't care a lot about their exact execution price, right. They're fine paying 2%, which if you talk to a trader, especially a quant trader or like a desk trader, they would just be like, oh, that's too expensive. And that's because they're thinking about the purely speculative reasons to buy derivatives.
00:30:00.678 - 00:30:00.826, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:00.848 - 00:30:48.300, Speaker B: They're not thinking about I'm actually hedging some commodity I own. Or is somehow related to the assets I own. They're just like, how can I flip this quickly? Right? And you're not going to make a profit at 2%. Right? The same thing with the NFT royalties thing, right? There's a reason that those fees go down, but institutions are fine with that because they want to have long term exposure and they have a bunch of assets on their balance sheet that they have to hedge. They have no choice. Right? And so DeFi protocols, Dows are very similar. They have a bunch of assets on their balance sheet that they want to hedge their own governance token, but they also don't want to give up a lot of rights to those, right? Because they ostensibly want to still make sure the Dow has a lot of ownership in the protocol itself.
00:30:48.300 - 00:31:52.074, Speaker B: And so Dows actually function a lot like these institutions that are the long term buyers of derivative products, whether it's futures, options swaps, et cetera. And I think an interesting case study of how this market sort of still isn't mature enough yet on chain is that we have this huge burst of interest in these Dov vaults, which are like the options vaults, like ribbon finance really great in a bull market, right? Because you basically are capturing some type of certain option strategies that do well when there's at least some sort of sideways behavior or slightly positive behavior. Not so great in a bear market. And if you saw these vaults when the prices went down, everyone pulled all their money. And when they pulled money, they caused this bad liquidity crisis. People removed money from dov vaults. The protocols panic removed liquidity.
00:31:52.074 - 00:32:42.982, Speaker B: It's not even panic removed. They're just defined to like, hey, if you're redeeming, we just remove liquidity instantly. And then that caused the option prices to get more expensive. People stopped buying options and you have this bad feedback loop. On the other hand, in normal finance, you have this positive feedback loop where institutions who are long some assets buy the hedging products even when the market is down. They keep hedging their exposure to oil even when the market's down, because they're not trying to just sell their assets and speculate on their treasury and in that sense, DFI protocols and Dows. But DFI protocol Dows in particular need to get good at treasury management 401, which I think is the next stage of the on chain evolution in finance.
00:32:43.146 - 00:32:50.242, Speaker A: Do you think there's any way this can be done in a decentralized way? Like in the forums? Basically, yeah.
00:32:50.296 - 00:33:07.090, Speaker B: So obviously I'm going to, at this point, talk my book about this because I've spent the last year thinking about how to build protocols for this problem after having watched and participated in many unsuccessful diversification discussions.
00:33:07.250 - 00:33:15.098, Speaker A: Wait, Turin, before you plug era, which you should definitely do, can you just explain how it's currently done? Right?
00:33:15.264 - 00:33:45.390, Speaker B: Oh, the way it's currently done is someone makes a forum post says like, hey, we should do X with the treasury. People discuss for two weeks, then they do a snapshot vote and then maybe they'll vote for it. Oftentimes if the sentiment isn't very good in the forums, it'll never even get the snapshot. Often it gets a snapshot. A lot of people don't vote in the snapshot that doesn't pass. And then also if the snapshot passes oftentimes, once it's on chain, the bigger holders are like oh no, I don't want the Dow to sell. And they vote.
00:33:45.390 - 00:33:47.838, Speaker B: They realize at the last minute there's.
00:33:47.854 - 00:33:49.106, Speaker C: Lots of ways, and I would add.
00:33:49.128 - 00:34:10.720, Speaker A: The second way that it's being done is now there are a lot of funds who are coming in and asset managers who are coming in. Saying, hey, you a bunch of 22 year olds don't know how to manage your treasury? Let us, the hedge fund, the professional hedge fund with some gray hairs, manage your treasury for you. Which is also a bad option because now you're just giving your treasury to a fund.
00:34:11.330 - 00:35:43.366, Speaker B: And if we haven't learned anything from MakerDAO's proposal where they lent to Gemini Earn and then now have exposure to Genesis, which I'm sure the Maker people who were very anti the strategy are extremely angry about being extremely careful about keeping your assets on chain as a Dow, I think, is really important. I think the moment you move any Dow assets off chain, you basically are not actually growing the ecosystem around your protocol or users. And we've seen that happen before. So I think after 2017 and 2018, a lot of the layer one foundations, they raised these ICOs, they had these Treasuries and they would sort of delegate their treasuries to trading firms either via token loans or other types of structures. And the trading firms just took them and traded on binance and FTX and stuff like that. They didn't use much of the on chain mechanics in those layer ones and so then they didn't really grow the on chain network of the layer ones. Like there's tons of layer ones who they probably should have been spending their treasury on being liquidity providers and protocols on their network, not doing token loans to trading firms who are trading on binance or FTX.
00:35:43.398 - 00:35:43.546, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:43.568 - 00:36:18.294, Speaker B: They're not generating real transaction volume for your network then, right. Whereas in DeFi, I think the network effect of DeFi comes in when protocol A uses protocol B. Maybe its treasury diversifies puts part of in protocol B. Protocol B uses protocol A with part of its treasury. And the net actual productive output is that by both of them providing liquidity on each other's protocols, they actually lower their transaction costs for both of their protocols. So more people use those protocols. Right? There's this synergistic effect of protocols using each other.
00:36:18.294 - 00:36:38.422, Speaker B: And that network effect is the beauty, I think, of a lot of the early ETH DeFi. I think that was when people really understood what composability meant and why it was important was really understanding how you could loop these things together. I think Treasuries also need to do the same thing, not just traders using these protocols.
00:36:38.486 - 00:37:03.870, Speaker C: All right, everyone, brief break in the show here to talk about our newest sponsor, Reserve. So it's looking pretty bleak out there. It's not looking that great. We know the one thing there's no bear market in stablecoins stables, baby stables. We love those stablecoins, which is why we're excited to partner with Reserve Protocol. So let's just start with the basics. What is reserve? It's a self service platform to build, deploy, and govern asset backed stablecoins, which can be integrated with DFI or within the real economy.
00:37:03.870 - 00:37:37.258, Speaker C: So the cool thing about reserve is basically, anyone out there permissionlessly can take any set of ERC 20 tokens and use them to collateralize their own stablecoin. So the long term goal of the reserve protocol is to create a noninflationary currency that is stable on a month to month basis, but also a century to century basis. In the meantime, though, they're open sourcing design decisions for stablecoins, which is just super, super cool. I think one of the benefits that you get there is diversification. You hear it all the time in Finance 101. No such thing as a free lunch except for diversification. That's what you're getting with reserve protocol.
00:37:37.354 - 00:37:47.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I've known the team for a long time. I spoke on a panel at SF Blockchain Week with Nevin? With Joe Carlson and Alex Gladstein. Really impressive growth that they've been able to have so far.
00:37:47.352 - 00:37:47.554, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:47.592 - 00:38:15.082, Speaker A: Their premier stablecoin is RSV. It is backed by three other stables. It's already used by over half a million people, transacting over $300 million a month. Right now, like Mike was talking about, anyone can go create a custom bespoke stablecoin using the reserve protocol. You can back it by maybe specific USD stables, or you can get creative and maybe build something more complex, like inversely correlated assets. The branding, governance, and composition are completely up to you.
00:38:15.136 - 00:38:43.778, Speaker C: And lastly, if there are any builders who are listening and you aren't interested in issuing your own stablecoin, what you can do is you can stake reserve's governance token against your favorite stable strategies. So what you're doing there is you're providing backstop insurance to stablecoin holders. Not riskless, right? Not financial advice. There's definitely some risk in doing that, but it does allow you to earn yield, especially now in crypto when there are so few ways to do that. It's definitely worth checking out. So at the very least, you should click the link at the bottom of this episode. Go check out the reserve website, see all the cool stuff they're up to.
00:38:43.778 - 00:38:50.822, Speaker C: Most importantly, though, click this link. Got to give Jason and me some credit here. Give us some love, baby. Give us some love. All right, now back to the show.
00:38:50.876 - 00:38:52.040, Speaker A: Let's get into it.
00:38:52.410 - 00:39:50.582, Speaker C: There was a proposal a little while ago, just use an example of to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying. Even between GMX and Rage trade, I remember where there was some sort of token swap. I mean, one of the other benefits of that as well know, Dows kind of miss the boat a little bit on diversifying out of their native token, right? The big problem that also we haven't talked about is most of these dows are sitting in their own native token and there's no liquidity on their native token, right? So they've got these liabilities denominated in USDC, which you need to pay the people that are contributing to your dao. And you don't have the ability anymore to transfer your native token into USDC. But one of the things that you can do with an illiquid token is swap for another illiquid token if you get some service in exchange for it. So that's kind of what you're describing right there, too. I'm not actually sure how often that occurs in traditional corporate finance.
00:39:50.582 - 00:39:51.882, Speaker C: I haven't really heard of it.
00:39:51.936 - 00:40:15.520, Speaker B: People do it, but in a weird way, which is they make a joint venture that they own. Equity swaps are more expensive in the traditional world, which is exactly one of the benefits of DeFi in some ways. Interesting, the fact that you can do these things relatively cheaply with no lawyers and no excess legal costs to do some type of thing like this.
00:40:16.610 - 00:40:38.438, Speaker C: So maybe this would be a good time to pivot into I mean, you've built a solution here, right, having been sort of boots on the ground and in your own words, participated in some unsuccessful diversification efforts. So maybe this would be a good time to talk about what is era and what parts of the we've outlined so many phases one, two, three, and four. Where does era kind of fit in that framework?
00:40:38.534 - 00:42:14.834, Speaker B: So a different way of looking at 401 is the allocation, is how do you solve the allocation problem in a decentralized manner? The allocation problem means I have portfolio X, like 50% governance tokens, 25% ETH, 25% USDC. And I have some notion of a KPI or objective of I want to diversify, I want to have more yield, I want to supply to protocols that are generating fees. I want to make my assets always greater than my liabilities. And the question is, how do you get people to optimize that metric or change your portfolio so that it keeps improving that metric even as market conditions change? And in that sense, there's a bit of similarity between sort of the approach I've been thinking of and we've been building out and sort of something like numerai, which is, if you've heard of it, haven't heard of it. As sort of this thing where people give like they crowdsource trading models and then numerai. The corporation sort of aggregates their trading models and then trades on them and then based on how well they do, they get some profit. The difference between something like Numerai and this is that a this is meant to be fully transparent.
00:42:14.834 - 00:43:13.100, Speaker B: Like you can see that the Dow token holders vote on an objective they vote on we want 20% of our treasury to always be spent on making sure assets are greater than liabilities. And they can see the measurement and calculation of that and they can see the execution of that. So all of the trades that are done, all of the portfolio changes are done on chain. And the idea is people submit their portfolios on chain, they get aggregated, they build an on chain track record. And then based on how good they are, how their recommendations over time work, they get fees paid for by the Dow. And so the idea is sort of making it so that this thing that you see in every treasury diversification, which is if you go to the forums, there's like someone who says it should be 90 ten, like it should be 90% dollars, 10% governance. Someone else says it should be 50 50.
00:43:13.100 - 00:44:19.742, Speaker B: But none of them have skin in the game, right? They're just saying like, hey, this pool of money should be changed this way, but they have no skin in the game. And the idea here is you have to put up some skin in the game. You make a portfolio and build a track record of improving these KPIs that a Dow wants to improve. Now, does that mean that can cover everything that is in treasury management? No. So like, things like grants, things that are qualitative, like what does it mean to invest in the business, which in Dows is very nebulous, right? Arguably even the grants are not clearly investing in the business of the Dow per se. But I think the idea is that anything that is quantitative, that a Dow can give a quantitative answer to this is a way of allowing you to get your participants to have skin in the game and vote on how your treasury should look and then get rewarded or penalized based on how well they did. And so that in a nutshell is what era is.
00:44:19.742 - 00:44:24.320, Speaker B: I try to give a very high level overview, but we can dive in to any level of that.
00:44:25.570 - 00:44:51.020, Speaker A: Can we go a little deeper, actually? Because I tried to fully understand it last week, but I want to keep going deeper. So let's use an example. So Lido has I'm just looking at this is from Deep Dow. So I'm looking on deep dow. Lido has, according to Deep Dow, 200 million in their treasury. You guys come in, how does this work now? How does that 200 million get allocated? Who manages it? How do you basically incentivize the management there?
00:44:51.550 - 00:45:48.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so let's say in Lido's case, as a staking derivative, there's sort of implicit safety issues like people might not be able to redeem right at some point in the future. And the Lido dao technically insures that to some extent. And so some staking derivatives like Marinade on Solana, I believe, explicitly have a staked insurance fund. I think Lido doesn't right now, but has definitely talked about it. But let's say Lido is like 20% of let's just make it simpler. Let's say 50%. So $100 million is allocated to making sure that if there's ever any reason someone can't withdraw or some validator misbehaves and causes a loss to people staking in Lido, that people will get covered.
00:45:48.330 - 00:46:51.306, Speaker B: 90% of that treasury is in Lido, so it's in LDO. So they would probably deposit LDO, and then people would say would vote on hey. Based on how much ETH there is staked in Lido and how much Lido is earning in fees versus how much it's liable for, there'd be an objective function on chain that says, like, okay, currently Lido's liabilities are $200 million, and currently our assets are $100 million of LDO. If we had to sell it, maybe we'd only be able to get $80 million of ETH. So we are at a deficit of $120,000,000. So what would happen would be people would vote on portfolios like, hey, maybe we get some yield on LDO with 10%. We vote on selling some fraction of the LDO into ETH, some fraction to USDC, and then people get measured on how much that difference between asset liabilities decrease.
00:46:51.306 - 00:47:14.914, Speaker B: So suppose the three of us submit portfolios that are different, but Michael's was the one that was actually like, the best portfolio of the three of us. Then he would get rewarded from the Dow. So the Dow would pay some fees for that, and the two of us would get slashed potentially because we gave bad portfolio. But the idea is everyone's getting graded.
00:47:14.962 - 00:47:19.174, Speaker A: Repeatedly for best portfolio based on highest return.
00:47:19.372 - 00:47:26.262, Speaker B: No. So that's the key thing. It's done in a way where the Dow provides an objective dow provides their goal.
00:47:26.326 - 00:47:28.406, Speaker A: Best portfolio based on the Dow's goal.
00:47:28.438 - 00:47:43.166, Speaker B: I see best portfolio based and you're graded based on how well you do on that goal. And it needs to be an on chain measurable goal. So you can write a function that just takes on chain state and says and can grade you and give you a yeah.
00:47:43.268 - 00:47:45.614, Speaker A: You ever talked to Richard from Numerai about this?
00:47:45.732 - 00:47:48.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I tutored him in know, Richard.
00:47:48.958 - 00:47:56.340, Speaker A: Actually had an amazing call. Richard came on the podcast like six months ago and was like, I'm selling all my ETH. We're like, Richard, you're crazy. Looks pretty good.
00:47:58.570 - 00:48:02.040, Speaker B: Been he's been very negative on crypto every time I've talked to him.
00:48:02.490 - 00:48:03.190, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:03.340 - 00:48:53.654, Speaker C: Yeah, he did kind of also call the return to market neutral hedge funds. And I think a lot of honestly, not that I really want to talk about Alameda, but you go back and look at some of Tribuco's old threads and you do see this change in market neutral and clipping spreads to taking directional bets. And that was probably a big part of the downfall of that particular fund. But I want to get a sense as well, tarun, I really like this framework that you have about treasury management making it so that your assets exceed your liabilities, preferably entirely on chain. I'd be curious. The one maybe little warning bell I have in the back of my head is some of these financial products are very complicated and it's very difficult to try to figure out how to incentivize people. Right.
00:48:53.654 - 00:49:23.410, Speaker C: Maybe the most basic thing I could see happening in this particular scenario is say, hey, we want to maximize return, but you should be doing risk adjusted return. Right. Which is a more difficult thing to do. But something, I guess do you worry about kind of the level of current financial know how in the space and do you think we need to see more financial know how kind of come in for this product to be successful?
00:49:24.390 - 00:50:39.798, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the interesting thing is if we look at the last two years of funding in DeFi, there was quite a bit of money spent on basically building every financial product that exists in traditional finance in some form or another. And arguably the most successful DeFi protocol is uniswap. And uniswap doesn't look like a normal traditional finance. After many months of writing papers, I think people like us proved some results that it does look like some very complicated traditional product, but it's not obviously like a normal financial product in some ways. But one interesting thing, and I think this gets back to the idea of like institutions are really important at being the baseline liquidity for a lot of derivatives products. Every options protocol in DeFi, every perps protocol in DeFi. They don't have any long term buyers and sellers like people who want positions that they're holding for months and that is not super sustainable.
00:50:39.798 - 00:51:38.074, Speaker B: That's fine in a bull market when there's enough speculation based demand to keep liquidity there because it can earn yield. But in a bear market you need to actually have these kind of long term buyers and long term sellers to make sure that these products are liquid enough to make sure that they're safe enough. And I think the goal I think of this bear market in my mind for DeFi is to figure out how to make these products that are very popular in centralized finance, have the ability to have similar pricing, but without any of the problems of the centralized versions, which are like, you have no clue what their real liabilities or assets are. And I think the goal of this is to help Dows bootstrap that. In my mind. There's a lot of ways that Dows are supposed to bootstrap this network growth between Dows. Right.
00:51:38.074 - 00:51:58.946, Speaker B: Like almost like b to b in a way that we haven't really done. Yes, there have been small token swaps here and there. But facilitating that allocation of Dow assets to other Dows is the only way you kind of get this network of Dows supporting each other and making the overall costs a lot cheaper, which then.
00:51:58.968 - 00:52:01.218, Speaker A: Creates this nice feedback loop, correct?
00:52:01.304 - 00:52:42.190, Speaker B: Yeah. Instead of being these know, parts of the world, part of sometimes how I describe DeFi to people who are in finance but don't know much about it, is the goal of DeFi is to unbundle the investment bank. Instead of having to like when you go do M A or IPO investment bank sells you 5 million products, you probably only really wanted two out of the 5 million, but they'd sell you the whole bundle. Right. In a lot of ways you could think of each DeFi protocol as like a desk at a bank. Right. But there are obviously synergies that banks extract out of being in the same unit where you can bundle these things.
00:52:42.190 - 00:52:54.350, Speaker B: And I think the key thing is to make tools such that people can create their own versions of that without having to get stuck with the package deal you're always sold at banks.
00:52:54.430 - 00:53:39.298, Speaker C: So maybe to just continue in Jason's line of questioning being a little bit is this is era a solution where you would recommend it maybe specifically for DeFi protocols like your Lidos or your Aaves or your compounds of the world, does it apply to every know? I kind of want to focus on those a little bit more just because I feel like maybe treasury management is a bit simpler if it's like a group of friends, a smaller thing with less complicated structure. But I guess what sort of recommendations would you make for Air? Is it sort of a one size fits all or is it specifically geared towards DeFi now, but you see it expanding into different verticals over time?
00:53:39.464 - 00:54:49.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the two main objective functions we've worked on are one, this asset liability mismatch of making sure that your treasury can adjust to the liabilities in a decentralized manner. The other is runway management and sort of ownership in the network. So DAOs that are not necessarily DeFi DAOs generally have some notion of runway that they have, right? Like how much do we need to spend in USD on contributors, on marketing, on whatever it is. They also have some notion of how much they want the Dow to have ownership in the token. Like we want the Dow to never have less than 10% of the network or we want the Dow never have less than 20% of the network. And then they also want some notion of either some type of diversification now that diversification can be either market beta to the rest of crypto. So like, maybe they want to own a bunch of ETH and ETH and their governance token are the two things they're trading or they want some type of fully uncorrelated thing and they own a bunch of USD.
00:54:49.210 - 00:55:48.694, Speaker B: And so those types of things are actually I gave you four components, maybe to your Dow you care 80% about ownership and 10% about diversification and 10% about market beta. But for another Dow, it's like 50 25, 25, right? Those types of optimizations can still use the same framework and that's sort of generic to many different types of Dows. It's not just strictly this asset liability mismatch. Part of the reason we came up with this was as we were constantly running these simulations, we would run these simulations under different conditions and then noticed that some of these insurance funds were insolvent that existed and couldn't handle an event. I guess this was like a year and a half ago. So at that time, no one really cared that much. When you're like, hey, look, if your thing goes down 80%, you're insolvent.
00:55:48.694 - 00:56:51.434, Speaker B: Of course, I guess Mango was the one that learned that lesson the hard way, but it was just this glaring hole to us while we're analyzing things. But I think the long term goal is to make it so that if you have an objective like something like we said, like I said earlier, you can optimize that. So someone like ENS is a perfect candidate for that, right? They're like, maybe we want the Dow to always be owning at least 25% and we want to make sure we have enough USD and ETH for X years of runway. And that's something that where people compete to do that, right? Versus people writing in the forums like, here's our allocation. There's a lot of adverse selection because you're kind of telling everyone what you're doing like weeks before the Dow even votes on doing the thing. B, there's no skin in the game. People aren't actually putting up capital to make these claims.
00:56:51.434 - 00:57:34.480, Speaker B: And I think the key is to make people have skin in the game in these things. Because the worst scenario is someone tells the Dow, hey, dump all of your governance tokens and only buy USD and then the same person goes and takes the other side of that. So they buy all of the governance tokens from the Dow and then now they own outright ownership in the Dow and they can just keep voting on paying themselves, right? There's sort of a very weird thing that happens if you don't force the treasury managers to also have skin in the game, they can extract more control over the Dow in the long run. And so being extremely careful about avoiding that scenario is one of the main things we try to focus on.
00:57:35.010 - 00:58:22.602, Speaker C: I know we've got a wrap here soon, but closing question, and I know this isn't what we've largely talked about, but actually focusing on sort of the 2.0 part of it, which is how much do you redistribute to shareholders in TradFi and token holders in crypto and how much do you invest in the future. We actually, jason and I did a recording on Empire with Kane Warwick and we talked a lot about just like, what's the correct balance? Know there was a big nerd of a little while ago, cash flowing protocols, right? Protocols that return funds to token holders. And I'd be curious, know what's your framework for kind of thinking about that, because I understand the preference for that. Right. But ultimately I think it's an allocation question of wherever you can produce the highest return. Right.
00:58:22.602 - 00:58:43.938, Speaker C: Compound value, you should be doing that. And for some of these earlier stage startups, it's like, why are you giving money back to token holders if you're a two year old company? Can't you find opportunities to invest in there? I don't know if you see that outside of the realm of treasury management or if you have an opinion on that, but I'd be curious to see what your internal framework kind of is for that whole question.
00:58:44.104 - 00:58:57.362, Speaker B: Argue that Uniswap sort of beat out its competitors by never turning on its fee switch. And if it did turn on its fee switch, it may have incurred a lot more adverse selection.
00:58:57.506 - 00:58:58.200, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:00.250 - 01:00:46.018, Speaker B: I think it sort of depends, like the point of a token to some extent, and this is not legal or financial advice, but it's to some extent allow you to not have to distribute any share of earnings, but always have some sort of ability to say you have a claim to it indirectly. But I think the idea of businesses that actually don't want to have a token so the two ones that I think of most prominently for this are like Flashbots or Eigen layer. You do actually need to distribute cash because you don't have any way for people to speculate on the future cash flow of your thing. Right. And at some level, all markets that have these securitizations turn into something where you're either speculating on future cash flow or it's like a zero sum game, like a derivative, where I buy one side, someone else takes the other side and that's it. So I think there's sort of this weird thing of like I think if you are able to build up a sustainable community and fees, even if the fees go down, yeah, you should probably just be reinvesting everything as long as possible in a growth industry. But if you're someone who's really antithetical to that and people view you as a sort of public good, you probably need to start charging fees and returning them faster.
01:00:46.018 - 01:01:17.626, Speaker B: That would be my trade. I think there's certainly this interesting thing, crypto, where a lot of things are called public goods or try to be public goods, but I think the value of a token is it actually ironically allows you to fund your public good for way longer. If you have no token, you probably need to start charging fees sooner. Like someone like Flashbots. I think that. Will be more salient for them in a few years that they effectively have to start charging fees.
01:01:17.818 - 01:01:20.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're probably right there. Trin, this has been great.
01:01:21.112 - 01:01:21.906, Speaker C: Thank you, man.
01:01:22.008 - 01:01:22.466, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:01:22.568 - 01:01:27.454, Speaker A: Appreciate you enlightening us on crypto's. Most interesting topic today, which is treasury management.
01:01:27.582 - 01:01:28.686, Speaker B: Most interesting on chain.
01:01:28.718 - 01:01:34.470, Speaker A: Topic on chain, yeah, exactly. That's been great, man. Thanks for coming on and yeah, we'll talk to you soon.
01:01:34.540 - 01:01:34.966, Speaker B: Sounds good.
01:01:34.988 - 01:01:36.902, Speaker C: Cheers. Thanks. All right, buddy, what'd you think?
01:01:36.956 - 01:01:54.566, Speaker A: Great episode. I knew that would be a good one. Really liked his framework for, like, treasury management 1.02.03 .0 and then 4.0, or like, what was it? 101? Two, 1301, 401. And that was my biggest takeaway.
01:01:54.566 - 01:02:25.438, Speaker A: Is that normal startups not in crypto need to know. 101. You're lucky if you get to 201 and you get into share, buybacks and dividends and things like that. 301 that you have to deal with that and then 401. No one has to really deal with 401 unless you're like a public company or like a Fortune 500 or something in crypto, that's kind of flipped on its head where you really don't have to do the 201, but if you're a protocol, you go straight to the 301 and the 401. And that's probably my lasting takeaway from that episode.
01:02:25.534 - 01:03:00.314, Speaker C: I would actually say that I would have pushed back a little bit on Tarune. I think the 201 is always important at a high level. What you're doing as a CEO or on the exec team is everyone's a capital allocator. At the end of the day, it's just kind of like, where should we focus our resources, so to speak? And I do think there's not enough discussion and we're going to be talking a little bit in a later episode with Chris Boninski about that. But for the most part, I thought the way that Turin thinks about things were very know. I think there are kind of two schools of thought when it comes to treasury management. And maybe I could lay it out with, I feel so bad for whoever's.
01:03:00.362 - 01:03:04.242, Speaker A: Listening to this outro. Just listening to babies screaming in the background, it's like, what are you doing?
01:03:04.296 - 01:03:14.374, Speaker C: It's pretty classic airport. This is like two days before Thanksgiving. I've got like a whole family of, like it sounds like I'm not getting like 15 little kids, like, screaming directly into my ear.
01:03:14.412 - 01:03:15.746, Speaker A: All I need is a poopy diaper.
01:03:15.778 - 01:03:19.266, Speaker C: And this is perfect Thanksgiving travel FOMO.
01:03:19.378 - 01:03:20.546, Speaker A: That sums it up nicely.
01:03:20.578 - 01:03:21.734, Speaker C: That sums up the year.
01:03:21.852 - 01:03:23.014, Speaker A: Sums up the week.
01:03:23.132 - 01:03:50.526, Speaker C: Okay, so I think there are kind of these two schools of thought, and I think both of them have a lot of merit. So there is sort of what Larry on one of our earlier episodes, talked about, and he talked about this in Musings on governance as well, which is a very straightforward approach to treasury management, which is that treasury management is a boring function. It should be a boring function. It's all about just preserving your cash flow. And I think that's extremely appropriate to a lot of the different startups that you see in crypto today. Right. It's kind of how we think about Treasury Management.
01:03:50.526 - 01:04:35.680, Speaker C: Like we don't have customer deposits and all that kind of stuff. We don't need to hedge our risk out. We're just like make sure we've got enough money to meet our expenses for some predetermined period of time. Then there's the more complex requirements of something like Compound or Nave where you do need to be taking into account, right. Treasury Management is really making sure that your assets outstrip your liabilities and that your assets are denominated in the same way that your liabilities are. So if you're something like Compound and you've got a pool between Ethereum and USDC, something like that, then you have a liability that's denominated in Ethereum and you need to have some part of your assets in that. So I think that is where Treasury Management gets a little bit more complicated and where Tarune structure was frankly very interesting.
01:04:35.680 - 01:04:46.340, Speaker C: I also thought we only talked about this for a little bit, but I thought it was very cool when he kind of brought up these partnerships like token swaps between Dows. Did you catch on to that?
01:04:47.030 - 01:04:50.690, Speaker A: I heard it, I followed it. 70%, I'd say.
01:04:50.760 - 01:05:38.770, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's just say right now, let's try to put ourselves in the shoes of a Dow. We have maybe somewhere between 80 and 100% of our native token are Dows in our native token. And maybe our native token has like some cases a million dollars worth of volume traded. So basically I've got this enormous pile of basically my native token and extremely limited liquidity and ability to get out of that. That's not great, right? You probably have people that you're paying largely in USDC, but there are some things that you can do with those tokens. One of the things is you can use that token and basically swap it with another protocol to create a partnership, right? So like let's say you're GMX or something like that.
01:05:38.770 - 01:06:07.758, Speaker C: And there's another platform where you're trying to source liquidity from. One way that you can do that is like, hey, I'm going to spend dollars on marketing which converts you'd have to convert your native token into USDC and then spend it on marketing. Or you can just go to other pools of liquidity, do a token swap and then incentivize basically being part of the partnership to bring liquidity onto the platform. So I just think it's a pretty interesting way of leveraging an otherwise a liquid asset that's probably worth something. I thought that's pretty cool.
01:06:07.764 - 01:06:12.010, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. And that creates that nice positive feedback loop that he was mentioning.
01:06:12.090 - 01:07:14.606, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the way I was listening and maybe Tarune's going to listen to this and tell me that I'm not thinking about this in the right way, but almost the way that Tarun conceptualizes some of these things. And he actually did push back on when we said it's not necessarily appropriate to view these things as an endowment. The way Tarun seems to think about Treasuries is they do sort of look like endowments, right, which is basically an endowment for a school. You are trying to make your assets, which is the pile of capital that you're managing as an endowment manager for school, exceed your liabilities, right? Which is kind of like what you need to put out every year for the school to pay for financial what's the word I'm looking for? Like, you need to offset some of the tuition for the school for financial aid, basically. Then there's also like, donations where you can only use assets to build a certain thing. So all these kind of walls in terms of what that money actually looks like and the way that endowments try to grow their assets that it exceeds the liabilities is every endowment has a different strategy. But they leverage managers like money managers.
01:07:14.606 - 01:07:32.118, Speaker C: And it seems like that's what Tarun solution is basically doing, where these pools of capital kind of have the ability to optimize for certain KPIs based on the business, but they're kind of farming it out to different managers who will help you grow assets that you exceed the liabilities of the protocol. It's kind of just a different way of looking at it.
01:07:32.124 - 01:08:20.082, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think that was a point that Tarun was really trying to hammer home, is that there are different goals and KPIs for each protocol, right? And I always think of KPIs in the gross sense of the word. You have revenue goals and marketing goals. I guess it's a really good point. There are a bunch of different treasury management strategies, right? Like the treasury management strategy of a company growing at 5% a year really, really different than a SaaS company who's trying to double every single year. And I think when people think about treasury management solutions in crypto today, they think about, okay, you have a native token. You should probably get that native token into something like USDC, or you should get that into something that earns yield. It's like these very simplistic strategies.
01:08:20.082 - 01:08:36.906, Speaker A: And I think Tarun's vision of the future is the correct vision, which is that there are a bunch of complex strategies going on here. You're going to eventually it's not all about earning yield. It's not all about protection of the asset into something like USDC. There are a bunch of different strategies that people need to deploy here.
01:08:37.008 - 01:09:10.066, Speaker C: Yeah. I kind of think the most basic tenant of treasury, you need to make your assets match your liabilities. So even what he was sort of describing, know, where corporate treasury management gets a little bit trickier, right, is if you're a large corporation with exposure to a lot of raw materials. So say you're a BMW and an enormous amount of percentage of your gross margin is dependent on the price of copper or steel or something like that. Steel will go up or down 50% to 100% every year. You'll notice that the margins of BMW don't do that. What's the reason for that? They go out into the markets.
01:09:10.066 - 01:09:14.954, Speaker C: They use futures to hedge that exposure to their raw materials. I think the crypto equivalent of that.
01:09:14.992 - 01:09:18.838, Speaker A: Is basically big steel consultant here, dude.
01:09:18.934 - 01:09:50.222, Speaker C: I haven't mentioned this entire series that I used to be a consultant. So I get so few opportunities, so few bites. I get to plug that right in. I got to plug it, I got to plug it, you got to plug it. So I think the crypto equivalent of that is probably the more appropriate way to think about it is almost like a bank, basically, and you're managing different durations, you're managing different currencies. I suppose that you denominate your risk in. I thought it was interesting he also made the point that you and I have talked about that proof of assets, proof of reserves.
01:09:50.222 - 01:10:06.134, Speaker C: The way it's being thought of right now is basically just proof of assets for an exchange. Assets alone are useless. That's like a balance sheet. All you have is the asset lineup. You've completely negated the liabilities. Right. What matters for these exchanges in terms of their solvency is the ratio of assets to liabilities.
01:10:06.134 - 01:10:47.126, Speaker C: Right. So I thought he made a very interesting point there. He also brought up I never really thought about it like this, but some of the harder to measure liability for some of these exchanges and it's probably applicable to Dows as well. So if you offer a service to your customer base, like giving them access to financial product X, Y or Z, if that access results in the loss of customer funds. Even if it wasn't your fault, even if you were just facilitating it. That probably should be a liability that you should be thinking about, because you don't want to lose that business or you don't want to damage your reputation. You're going to have to make your customers whole.
01:10:47.126 - 01:11:10.286, Speaker C: So I think that should be factoring in, frankly, to more people's thoughts. And you know what on ave. Do you remember a little while ago, about two, three months ago, you started to see these proposals crop up in the governance forums where they were offboarding certain layer ones, right? Like phantom and stuff like that. They probably are thinking like, yeah, that's interesting.
01:11:10.388 - 01:11:44.630, Speaker A: Yeah. Who do we have coming up next? We have Charles. I think it's Charles St. Louis. And Jules, just talking about this is going to be a really interesting episode talking about the cutting edge of Dow governance and experiments in Alpha happening in not just Dow governance, but just Dows in general right now. And I think a lot of the experiments what I want to get out of this episode is a lot of the experiments and weird stuff that you see in bull markets, like the successful crazy stuff ends up it starts as these small little experiments in bear markets. Usually there's like a group of 50 people paying attention to these experiments.
01:11:44.630 - 01:11:49.290, Speaker A: And Charles and Jules are the two people who are paying attention to these experiments closest.
01:11:49.790 - 01:12:43.946, Speaker C: Well, I would say the structure. So Jules is at she's at Orca and Charles is at Element Finance. And those two projects, the thread there between those two projects, I think they have some of the most especially element the structure that they're trying over there is very, very innovative, I think, just in terms of thinking about Dows. And from a first principle standpoint, jules, she's one of the, I think, foremost voices, basically, on that line of thought. So that's what we're going to be. So far, we've sort of talked about, okay, what are the apt analogies and comparisons that we can make between Dao governance and corporate finance, and how should this work? And now I think this next episode is going to be okay. What is possible in crypto in the form of Dows that was not possible before, and what are some of the cutting edge experimentation that's going on? So that's why we've got them coming on.
01:12:44.048 - 01:12:45.322, Speaker A: Awesome. True.
01:12:45.376 - 01:12:48.440, Speaker C: Wrap, wrap, wrap, baby. All right, see you guys next week.
