00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.310, Speaker A: Did you see the ledger? The Ledger? Memes of what? People were watching the chat. Ledger definitely closed drawers with his hips.
00:00:11.490 - 00:00:21.680, Speaker B: I listened to a podcast where he defended it. He's like, everyone does that, right? I was like, I do that too. Yeah, for sure, man. It's like, Ledger's the kind of guy who says after a rain, the plants really needed this.
00:00:28.170 - 00:00:36.520, Speaker C: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:39.630 - 00:00:46.970, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. Here we got Michael's, one and two, yano and Vance. What's going on, fellas?
00:00:47.390 - 00:00:58.074, Speaker D: How's it going? Big night. Just stand up, watch the merge hit the tub. After the hot tub. After all the festivities.
00:00:58.202 - 00:00:58.746, Speaker C: The tub.
00:00:58.778 - 00:01:02.126, Speaker B: We're honored that you dragged yourself out of the tub just for a little old us.
00:01:02.228 - 00:01:10.500, Speaker D: Listen, no better way to celebrate some of the boys in the hot tub. It's been an awesome 24 hours.
00:01:10.870 - 00:01:23.000, Speaker A: I was also saying I thought it was the most anticlimactic thing you could possibly celebrate, where everybody's huddled around a laptop waiting for the first block to finalize. And then it does, and everyone's like, cool, high five.
00:01:23.930 - 00:01:27.606, Speaker B: Everyone kind of, like, tap their knees. They're like, all right, but isn't that.
00:01:27.628 - 00:01:36.290, Speaker C: Kind of what all like, isn't that kind of all celebrate? It's like New Year's. Think about New Year's. It's like, all right. It's like 1159. All right, it's midnight.
00:01:36.450 - 00:01:39.930, Speaker A: Total block. At least there's fireworks for New Year's.
00:01:39.970 - 00:01:41.630, Speaker C: That's true.
00:01:41.700 - 00:01:55.446, Speaker B: Yeah, you get a nice visual of the ball drop. Speaking of balls dropping, actually, there were some fireworks postmerge. That's the last time I tried to.
00:01:55.448 - 00:01:56.580, Speaker C: Do a segue on the.
00:02:02.230 - 00:02:21.258, Speaker B: All right, all right. Let me pull this chart up. All right, so what do you guys I mean, there was a lot of speculation going into the merge about what was going to happen. Obviously, things are lower. Vance, I know you said in our chat leading up to this, we just need a couple more liquidations, then it's up only from here. What do you guys think about price heading into the merge here?
00:02:21.424 - 00:02:28.010, Speaker D: I mean, that was Kyle Davies tweet a couple more liquidations than up only. So it's kind of like, oh, really?
00:02:28.080 - 00:02:28.886, Speaker B: Oh, shit.
00:02:28.998 - 00:03:06.694, Speaker D: Yeah. I miss that. I think, you know, without commenting on the specific price of ethereum and more of kind of all of the positioning changes that happened overnight, where the funding rate went from heavily negative to basically flat or in contango. Now, if you watch futures, you had a bunch of people shorting ETH. You had kind of all these unwinding of all these positions. And now I think going forward is really this is so much flow kind of wrapping up in the last 20, 412 hours that now we have kind of like the tactical people out of the market, for better or for worse. And now.
00:03:06.694 - 00:03:47.880, Speaker D: It's like you can really assess the long term impact of the structural change of ethereum's proof of stake dynamics. So it's kind of like we're going to need to wait and see and the effect compounds over time and yeah, I mean, proof of stake is not something that the switch flips and everything changes overnight. It's more of something where it has a time based impact. If you're removing 800 to a billion dollars of net issuance or sell pressure within a month with the combined burn and issuance reduction, the more months that occur, the higher that impact gets. And so it's kind of like a wait and see game. But the biggest thing is that the chain didn't go. Like, maybe it was boring, but Michael and I, there's like a picture of us last night.
00:03:47.880 - 00:04:00.934, Speaker D: We're just looking at our phones and it's not super intense, but all of our net worth is on one chain and if it goes down, what happens? And so just the absence of a loss, I think is a pretty big win.
00:04:01.052 - 00:04:05.930, Speaker A: The other thing I'd say, which has been interesting to track, is just like what's happened with ETH. POW.
00:04:06.990 - 00:04:10.506, Speaker B: I was going to ask you guys what has happened? I haven't even heard anything.
00:04:10.608 - 00:04:23.946, Speaker A: And that, I think, is kind of what's happened. There hasn't been really any news. There hasn't been any activity or very much at all. 71. I'm just pulling up the chart right now. 71. 72 million of 24 hours daily volume.
00:04:23.946 - 00:04:49.786, Speaker A: It's down 60% over the last 24 hours. I think a lot of this was people wanting to hold on to ETH. The borrow rates on Ave yesterday were up to like 360% annualized. People wanted to hold ETH on base layer to try to go after this fork. And now that trade is over. So things kind of settle naturally because of that. And I think to Vance's point, this will just all kind of settle out in a little while.
00:04:49.888 - 00:05:09.710, Speaker C: What is this, though? Do you see this announcement on the renaming of the Ethereum fork token ETHW. As ETF. Poloniax has decided to choose the fork chain ethereum Fair. I can't tell if this is a joke or not. Which is supported by the community's majority and more proof of work computing power as the main chain. Is this a joke or is like Polon?
00:05:12.130 - 00:05:16.580, Speaker D: Click on the pie chart. Click on that pie chart. Yeah.
00:05:21.350 - 00:05:22.722, Speaker A: I think this is something different.
00:05:22.776 - 00:05:23.540, Speaker C: All right.
00:05:24.390 - 00:05:43.274, Speaker D: Yeah. So this is not a fork. This is like Justin's son just like doing funny money things where he's like, okay, bitcoin people get this much. The doge people get that much. I don't know why this is called Ethereum Fair. This just seems like kind of absurd and like a sideshow. Justin sun just like, always delivers on just like doing things like this.
00:05:43.274 - 00:05:48.140, Speaker D: So not super surprised. Yeah. Good luck to everyone who holds Ethereum Fair.
00:05:49.550 - 00:05:52.314, Speaker B: I know. I like things that are fair. Sounds good to me.
00:05:52.352 - 00:05:52.814, Speaker D: Sounds nice.
00:05:52.852 - 00:05:54.010, Speaker C: I like the branding.
00:05:54.170 - 00:05:54.910, Speaker B: Sounds nice.
00:05:54.980 - 00:05:58.798, Speaker C: Big middle of the better than make things fair.
00:05:58.964 - 00:05:59.486, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:59.588 - 00:06:32.470, Speaker B: I will say it's kind of funny that Poloniax is doing this. I think we've talked about this on Past Roundups, but they were the ones, you know, their kind of history around ETH Classic and everything, because this was the exact same thing right when there was the hard fork back then and actually very similar thing. It kind of just trended down to nothingness after like three days and then listed ETH classic at like 12:00 p.m. On a Saturday, just sent it on this huge epic run and they prepared for it better than the other exchanges and they kind of fucked a bunch of their competitions. It was a pretty savvy move. I don't think that they're doing the same thing, but it's just kind of funny that this is coming from Polonia.
00:06:32.550 - 00:06:50.666, Speaker D: There's also been a huge speaking of Ethereum classic, there's been a huge ramp up in hash rate on the E. I saw that. Yeah, I don't know if that matter. It doesn't seem like that matters at all. It just feels like the miners are figuring out what the kind of next thing that they're doing is. But good luck.
00:06:50.858 - 00:07:28.582, Speaker C: This was my favorite part of the merge here, I'm going to share the screen again is if you're watching on YouTube, you can see this is like the stories from mainstream media about green ETH. This has just been it didn't hit me, I would say. I think going into the merge, a lot of people are talking about structural differences and supply and demand and the differences in just like proof of stake versus proof of work. And I think the narrative didn't really at least for me, I didn't realize how strong and impactful the green ETH merge would be. Green ETH narrative would be and it was just interesting. I was looking at how mainstream publications covered this. You have CNN, the world's second biggest crypto just got a lot greener.
00:07:28.582 - 00:07:49.410, Speaker C: You have The Verge ETH will use a lot less energy. Now, Forbes, here's what you need to know about the hotly anticipated upgrade turning the crypto player green Politico. Right. The list just kind of goes on like green crypto, ethereum wins applause in Washington. And this is just like this has got to be one of the best narratives I've ever seen, not just for ETH. But for crypto.
00:07:49.750 - 00:08:35.360, Speaker A: Totally agree. I mean, think about this narrative with the backdrop of everything that's going on to the anti proof of work perspective as well. Just earlier this week, you had the I think it was the Treasury Department had to respond to the presidential order to assess cryptocurrencies, and one of their big takeaways was we should potentially look into regulation of proof of work chains. It doesn't mean that they're going to it doesn't mean that proof of work is not going to be favorable or at least looked favorably in the US. But it does mean that they're going to start looking into it. And this at the exact same time as the merge and this 99 plus percent flipping of ESG and environmental concerns. I think it's just the dichotomy and the Jeff's position of the two is huge.
00:08:36.690 - 00:09:13.082, Speaker B: I will say I don't love that narrative getting pushed, because, again, just like, fundamentally, I don't think it's a negative thing necessarily, that Bitcoin uses proof of work. I actually would prefer them to use their proof of work because I view them as this money and they're not really supposed to have utility. I think that's fine for Bitcoin. So I don't really want this get brandished like a stick and used to beat Bitcoin. But I will say we just did our Das conference, which we've been doing for the last four years. And one thing that struck me is I kind of remember different points of time from when we've been doing it in past years. And I was just kind of remembering when we initially did it back in 2019, that was like rolling off of that bear market.
00:09:13.082 - 00:09:42.198, Speaker B: And the consensus view very much at that point was, all right, all these ICOs were like something that was either way ahead, or the market was way ahead of its skis or fraud or not great activity. And bitcoin was the only thing that was sure. And there was, like, this consensus rallying around Bitcoin, basically. And now that we're in a bear market, you couldn't be further from that, right? Like, no one's really rallying around Bitcoin at the current time. There's a market difference from how it's felt in the past. I don't know how you guys respond to that.
00:09:42.284 - 00:09:59.686, Speaker D: I'm trying to just remember how it felt last time. Was there really the strong BTC, I guess there was. ETH. Had, like, a really weak consensus. There almost wasn't, like, a group around ETH. That was distinguishable from the other L ones. Like, in retrospect, you could probably see the differences, but at the time, it felt like ETH.
00:09:59.686 - 00:10:36.950, Speaker D: Was just like another chain, and we kind of have this collective instinct to group around one thing when things get harder and when things just need to kind of be more fundamentally justified. But it felt like in the last bear market, we didn't know what Bitcoin could be justified based on what narratives we could explore with it. And I think in the last Bull Run, we really explored a lot of those narratives. We explored it as kind of like a medium exchange. Like, okay, there's no fees on the chain. We've had enough cycles to tell that that's probably not going to materialize. We explored it as this inflation hedge through the Michael Saylor saga and all the super cyclers.
00:10:36.950 - 00:11:02.160, Speaker D: And I think now it's just kind of like we've learned that it probably doesn't work on a store value basis. Just like it's not rallying when inflation is high, we've learned that it doesn't really work on a medium exchange basis. There's no fees on the network. And I think this is the first bear cycle where people have been like, okay, cool, we now know these things, so by process of elimination, we should probably go look for something else. And that's reflected in the quality of the people who are in the communities right now.
00:11:03.250 - 00:11:53.182, Speaker A: The other thing, too, in the last bear cycle, ETH obviously was being used basically as a fundraising mechanism for all the token sales that were going on in 2017, but there weren't really any applications built on top of it. You didn't have a single real stablecoin that was built on Ethereum or built on a base layer blockchain. The application categories really didn't exist in a way that was scalable or frankly usable by the mainstream consumer base. And you had to kind of choose Bitcoin as the one prevailing narrative because this stuff was supposed to be money and you could use it as a medium of exchange, you use it as a store of value. It could be even like a balance sheet capital asset that companies would be able to put on their balance sheet eventually. As Vance said, all those things have been tested. But that period of time, 20 17, 20, 18, 20 19, was when all the funding rounds for the alternative base layers happened.
00:11:53.182 - 00:12:19.590, Speaker A: So you had, once again, the juxtaposition of Ethereum not really working. No applications are built on top of it. We've got stuff in the works where we're going to have other application categories, but they're going to take years to mature and get to the point of usability. And bitcoin kind of is the remaining thing. Whereas now I think that narrative is completely shifted. You have applications, you have stablecoins, you have DeFi, you have games. Yeah, I mean, it kind of does leave the bitcoin narrative in the dust.
00:12:19.930 - 00:12:52.398, Speaker D: Yeah. The last thing I'll say on that is the ESG and climate change stuff is super important, whether you agree with it or not. That's generally the way if you believe in climate change or not, or ESG or not, it doesn't really matter. The world is gradually gathering evidence that suggests it's real and the rest of the world is reacting by going distinctly in this. And like, if you're not moving with the crowd, you're kind of moving against the crowd. And hearing that the White House might ban proof of work technology is the first shot across the bow of what I think will be many. And to your point, Michael, you have to pick what is valuable.
00:12:52.398 - 00:13:07.960, Speaker D: You can spend energy and put carbon in the atmosphere for some reasonable thing that everybody wants, but it has to be justified. If Ethereum can do a better job with less emissions, there's just going to be a natural consensus that converges around that.
00:13:08.730 - 00:13:29.566, Speaker A: That was exactly what I was going to say next. Nobody really talks about the energy consumption of the internet, but it's because you have this value to it that is just inherent in the usage. YouTube probably. I don't even know what the actual number of megawatts per hour, but I would imagine it's probably more than the bitcoin network. But nobody ever talked about that.
00:13:29.588 - 00:13:30.590, Speaker B: I've tried to find that.
00:13:30.660 - 00:13:31.038, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:31.124 - 00:13:39.566, Speaker B: It's actually hard to find statistical information on it. And I assume it's because no one even questioned it. Right. No one was like, we should probably figure out how much energy this shit's consuming.
00:13:39.678 - 00:13:40.290, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:13:40.440 - 00:13:41.934, Speaker B: Yeah. This is clearly useful.
00:13:42.062 - 00:13:42.546, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:13:42.648 - 00:14:24.286, Speaker C: Yeah. I wrote this thread on green ETH and brought up the bitcoin narrative and how the bitcoin narrative really turned and how that was detrimental last year and a bunch of bitcoin maxis piled on the tweet. And I think the consensus of their argument was the like let me actually just read one that got like, the most likes, it was like every time you use Ethereum, you're giving ETH voting power to those who already hold the most ETH. Every time you use bitcoin, you're giving bitcoin to those that put in the most work. You're basically like driving centralization by supporting this ETH proof of stake. It's basically just like the anti proof of stake argument, which I'm just curious how you think about something when you read that.
00:14:24.468 - 00:14:59.354, Speaker D: You know, what else has centralizing tendencies like running large proof of work? Electricity miners that are hooked up to an electricity grid. You can't just do that in your backyard and realize any sort of economic efficiency where the cost of the bitcoin will be less than what you can actually sell it for on the market. It's naturally going to go to these places like China, like these big industrial farms. Michael and I, one of our first investments out of framework, and this is something that we obviously pivoted away from with retrospect was Coinmine and Farb's. Great. Shout out to the team. It's just like an idea that didn't really work.
00:14:59.354 - 00:15:21.166, Speaker D: You can't do at home mining and have the same distribution of economics as you can with the proof of stake system. It's just like much more costly and much more computationally intensive. So I don't know. Who do people think are running the bitcoin chain? Is it like a bunch of people with hydroelectric dams in their backyard? It's just like, not happening. So I just don't find that to be very logical.
00:15:21.358 - 00:15:28.066, Speaker C: I remember we had a Coin mine in our office. Throwback coin. Yeah, good idea. Those are some pretty looking rigs.
00:15:28.098 - 00:15:29.026, Speaker A: I've got one in my closet.
00:15:29.058 - 00:15:33.910, Speaker D: They look like an Xbox if you've never seen it. I got my Christmas.
00:15:34.970 - 00:15:47.174, Speaker B: Our COO, Julie, is actually a helium whale. Take that joke. But she bought a minor, like super early, like a bunch there. I was there when she bought it. And I was like, I can't believe you're buying.
00:15:47.302 - 00:15:48.106, Speaker C: I don't know if you can see.
00:15:48.128 - 00:15:49.290, Speaker B: This one on me.
00:15:49.440 - 00:15:53.726, Speaker C: This guy down there, I've got a helium, I've got a hotspot. I've made like $0.27 from it.
00:15:53.748 - 00:15:56.398, Speaker B: I was going to say one of.
00:15:56.404 - 00:16:05.550, Speaker A: The people on our team bought a helium minor, started mining it and made three times his money. By selling the minor, not by actually mining the helium network.
00:16:06.610 - 00:16:10.290, Speaker C: Yeah, made like a whopping $0.27. I'm like, are you kidding?
00:16:10.630 - 00:16:36.374, Speaker B: Yeah, julie did better than that. I don't know. I hear all the arguments about it. I guess I kind of feel the way about it almost like I look at some of the libertarian type political spaces in the US. And even though it's not necessarily my cup of tea, I am kind of glad that it exists as a counterbalance. And I do see the value in it. I don't think it's totally useless.
00:16:36.502 - 00:16:38.842, Speaker D: I don't want to spend normal as counterbalance, for sure.
00:16:38.896 - 00:17:12.566, Speaker B: Yeah. I want to actually get your guys opinion on Cosmos. Actually, there's like a whole bunch of different ways that we could take this, actually kind of depending on how you look at it. I know it's only less than 24 hours, but sort of disappointing price action post merge for ETH. But Cosmos has just, like, been on a tear recently. There's a lot of excitement around Atom 2.0, which there's kind of an adjustment around the monetary policy there and a whole bunch of they've kind of teased what's going to go on there, and I guess they're going to lay out their whole master plan at Cosmoverse or whatever that is, down in Columbia in the next two weeks.
00:17:12.566 - 00:17:33.706, Speaker B: But I thought actually Delphi laid out something pretty interesting because they basically marked that as the next ecosystem that they're really going to invest in. I know. Vance, you had some thoughts on just what they wrote about and how you kind of view the trade offs of building and investing in ETH versus maybe Cosmos and IBC.
00:17:33.898 - 00:18:41.106, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the first part is kind of the nature of tokens and both kind of like their economic and regulatory implications. So on the regulatory side, we have actually pretty decent precedent that something can become, as a base layer, sufficiently decentralized to the point where that token in the past week this came out where Gensler is allegedly open to having this regulated by the CFTC ether. That is, you can get to a point where you're kind of like beyond the regulatory apparatus and you can operate as this decentralized network. And so that same concept doesn't exist for DApps, doesn't exist for derivatives exchanges or money markets that you slap a token on. But if you have a token that secures the fundamental security of the chain that seems to be some sort of carve out or some sort of area where you have degrees of freedom to issue a token and have it be valuable and accrue fees from the network. And so within that context, it's not surprising to see dYdX a token which doesn't have any real value, cruel. Right now, all the trading fees go to a company, shift its model to being a base layer chain so that it can actually have the fees that it generates flow through the token in a regulatory compliant way.
00:18:41.106 - 00:19:38.002, Speaker D: I think that's one part of it, and I think the other part of it is, from a tam standpoint, if you're building a base layer chain versus a DeFi app, it's probably arguably larger in the former category if you're really successful. So those are kind of the two things that I see right now. I think Delphi did a really good job of describing kind of all the things that they want to have within the superpower DeFi app and why it should be built on Cosmos. For me, I have a little bit of trouble seeing that fundamental case. Their whole argument is it's going to be one big DeFi super app, it's going to be a universal credit account where you have derivatives and borrowing and spot trading. To me, I kind of can't see that versus just like an aggregator on an L Two with cheap fees, like rolling up all the existing protocols. Why are those two things fundamentally different? So I don't see that argument as clearly, but I do understand the power of Cosmos, but it doesn't have to do directly with like, you can do things here which you really can't do other places.
00:19:38.002 - 00:19:40.918, Speaker D: I don't think that's necessarily so.
00:19:41.004 - 00:20:53.230, Speaker A: One of the other takes that I think Vance probably shares some of the same perspective, but to kind of riff off of what he was saying on DeFi, I actually don't think that their argument should be focused on DeFi for having Cosmos be the central application category or sorry, having DeFi be the central application category built on Cosmos. Actually think a better model might be games. And basically the argument here is, well, I agree, I don't think that we need individual blockchains for individual applications for DeFi, but I do think that having individual blockchains for games allow you to have the transaction throughput to where you be able to actually have millions of concurrent players playing on that blockchain. And you can control the economics, you control the security model, you control the token economics to the point where gaming actually has the necessary throughput or the requirements for throughput to where this model actually might be the best use case for that concept. And yeah, I think having an aggregator on existing protocols versus a single monolith is probably the way that DeFi goes, whereas games, I think, is actually completely separate.
00:20:54.370 - 00:21:34.022, Speaker D: Super important point. I want to add to what Michael just said. So right now, if you look at all the games they're launching on, like Polygon and Immutable and Solana and first time game developers trying to pick a chain, they don't really know which one. They're kind of just going whatever way the wind blows wherever they get more incentives. But a lot of these chains have fundamental scaling thresholds that they can't really get past. Like Immutable X is nine K transactions per second. If you get one, Dark Forest blew out the XD Gnosis chain and completely used up all the block space and halted the chain, there's a really good chance that not all games can actually live on the same base layer.
00:21:34.022 - 00:21:49.534, Speaker D: They're going to actually just need to be on their different app layers. And so right now, all these games are building on these base layers, but it feels like it's going to be a short hop from like, we're a successful game. We have a token. We don't know how it increase value. Okay, cool. We're going to go build an app chain. I think that's more of the bullish Cosmos thesis than the DeFi one.
00:21:49.534 - 00:21:56.862, Speaker D: But Delphi Lab says that they're only focused on DeFi. So it kind of makes sense they're focused on that.
00:21:56.996 - 00:22:02.990, Speaker A: They kind of mentioned gaming in their post, but they definitely didn't go into it, whereas I think it should have been their Converse.
00:22:03.070 - 00:23:30.960, Speaker B: Well, I think the reason they focused on DeFi specifically there is because a big point that they kind of made is that when you have a generalized blockchain, you have all sorts of different sectors or applications there. So there's like NFTs and DeFi and gaming to your point, and it really sucks, especially for financial infrastructure, if something clogs up the chain and then the financial infrastructure can't work because board apes doing their land sale, right? And to your point, gaming, if they bring on an order or two orders of magnitude more users than currently exist, you're kind of constantly, no matter how fast you scale, going to be dealing with this issue of clogging up block space. And so I think one of the advantages that Cosmos offers is like, okay, you get to go launch your own app chain, and there's definitely drawbacks to that, right? It's more expensive and time consuming up front because you need to bootstrap your own network of validators and do all that kind of stuff. But you do have kind of the advantage of, okay, then you can kind of customize different things within that app chain as well. Like dYdX, when they're building their own chain, they'll have the ability to change transaction fees, and I think they'll be able to do more with mev on their own chain as well, which I actually think is a critical point because seems like mev is going to be the way that block space is monetized. It seems like that's going to be the dominant model. So if you have more transparency or more ability to direct and order mev within your own ecosystem, I feel like that's an enormous advantage, frankly, but once again, I wonder if that's why actually.
00:23:31.650 - 00:24:09.482, Speaker A: Yeah, the mev is a huge component. But once again, aren't all of those examples just even more important for an ecosystem like gaming versus DeFi? DeFi has already existed on chain at pretty decent scale for a while in the ethereum ecosystem, and it's just getting cheaper. I mean, everything with DeFi is going to be just a cost trade off and usability is going to get better over time. Aggregators are going to get better over time. But the other thing that's implicit within having your own base layer chains is that you have to have transportability cross chain bridging and cross chain swapping of assets. And that is at least so far. And we'll see.
00:24:09.482 - 00:24:22.042, Speaker A: I mean, IBC is nice and we haven't really seen any issues with it. So if that becomes the dominant solution across the board, maybe this is not as important of a point, but I don't trust to put my financial assets in a bridge.
00:24:22.106 - 00:24:22.394, Speaker D: Period.
00:24:22.442 - 00:24:34.718, Speaker A: End of story. And I think gaming is going to be a different story because it's a game asset. It's worth $5. It's worth $10. I'd feel much more comfortable swapping that versus an ETH token.
00:24:34.894 - 00:24:35.426, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:35.528 - 00:24:57.930, Speaker D: Is this going to enable the next generation of DFI? Probably not. Is this going to be a model that people move towards once they're super successful and want to get more monetization? I would say probably that or nell, too. But yeah, it's easy to say, like, OOH, this new thing, we're just missing this piece. And it's like, well, maybe it wasn't that actually transformative.
00:24:58.830 - 00:25:45.590, Speaker C: There's this small piece of history that I do wonder if it would have changed things, which is compound's decision to build on polka dot. I don't know if you guys read that delphi piece, but there's a screenshot of rob leshner. So basically compound and I think earlier it was either last year or like at the beginning of this year was like, yeah, instead of building compound on a bunch of different l ones, we should build the compound chain. And they decided to use their basically, I think it came down to either building on cosmos or polka dot, and they chose polka dot is my understanding of the story. And it just completely flopped and they hated polkadot, so they pulled out of the plan. But if compound had built an app chain on cosmos, then dybx did it. I feel like history could look just like that one decision.
00:25:45.590 - 00:25:47.338, Speaker C: Things could look a little different, maybe.
00:25:47.504 - 00:26:09.586, Speaker A: I agree. The other one that was built on cosmos is luna and terra. And I think you do have some history there as well. I don't think that will pervade and I think you have to control your own chain, essentially. But I do think that it is an interesting revisionist history. If compound would have chosen cosmos, would that have moved more of kind of like DFI 1.0 over to.
00:26:09.586 - 00:26:10.674, Speaker A: Cosmos as well.
00:26:10.792 - 00:26:47.440, Speaker D: We've had a couple of portfolio companies have really bad having to pivot away from polka dot and not trying to dunk on polka dot or whatever, but I just think it was the first to kind of conceptualize this app chain model at scale and raise a bunch of money and really bang the drum. But it feels like the developer experience tendermint versus polkadot, like totally different developer experiences, but also the pair chain model just doesn't really seem to really resonate with people. If you're building something that's supposed to last forever, why am I having to re up my rent every six or twelve months?
00:26:47.810 - 00:27:30.640, Speaker B: I have another reason why polka dot might not have taken off because it never pumped and made anyone rich, which is like really what you kind of I'm borrowing this theory that I heard from other people. But really, if you think about the model of blockchains, like the distribution mechanism, you want that base of really early adopters who buy in early. They get wealthy off of buying Bitcoin or ETH or Solana or whatever it is, and they become these diehard evangelists that just pump it from here to the moon. The common theme of these kind of VC ghost chains is like, they set the price way too high, they got all the gains and they never got any of those evangelists, even though the tech might have actually been really good. It.
00:28:11.920 - 00:28:21.036, Speaker C: That'S why NFTs on Solana are booming. That's why NFTs on solana are booming. And it's with the Gen Z crowd. No, I'm not even kidding. Like the Gen. Z's go crazy for solana.
00:28:21.068 - 00:28:24.248, Speaker D: NFTs, you're a poet.
00:28:24.364 - 00:29:27.556, Speaker B: That rhymed. You're a poet. I'd be curious to get a sense of how you guys think about the model, like even the revenue model for even like an L one blockchain, because I think it actually plays into the generalized blockchain versus app chains. Because I think if what ETH is trying to do is sell block space, if we can agree that's kind of the business model for ethereum or other layer ones, then the other question is how do you monetize that? Or what is the correct fee structure for monetizing or what is the market going to accept? So to give you guys an example of kind of what I'm trying to get at here is in traditional finance, right, the way that fees get extracted from connecting buyers and sellers has gone from just like, hey, pay $5 or pay like $100 or whatever to buy or sell this stock down to zero. And now it's ostensibly zero trading fees, but a similar amount of money is still getting extracted from doing that. It's just kind of hidden in payment for order flow. So I kind of feel like the model of blockchains is you're selling block space.
00:29:27.556 - 00:29:41.784, Speaker B: But the way that that's ultimately going to get monetized is this sort of known sort of hidden mev right because that's the ability to order transactions within that block space. Do you agree with that overall model.
00:29:41.902 - 00:30:33.932, Speaker A: Or no generally agree with the overall model. I'd say one of the discussions that we have all the time is it's not really sort of what's the business of the base order blockchain. I'd say what's the user experience is sort of the bigger question when you're talking about payment for order flow, robinhood versus commission fees for a traditional brokerage, that feels like probably the right direction for where retail flow will go. You're still getting paid or the blockchain is still getting paid for those transactions. It's just getting paid through an indirect model. And for things that are higher value, higher costing, you're probably going to have some fee associated with it just like you would expect if you were doing any other type of transaction that was high value or complex of the like. I think generally you're going to see fees go down, revenue go up because of that.
00:30:33.932 - 00:30:56.390, Speaker A: Because you're also going to have new application categories that just become viable when you have lower transaction fees. If you decrease the dollar transaction fee on Ethereum from one dollars to would assume that at each one of those breakpoints you would have more than a ten x increase in the number of transactions and therefore revenue would be higher at each one of those price points.
00:30:57.640 - 00:31:02.150, Speaker D: Have we talked about the arbitram and optimism mev models? I feel like we might have.
00:31:03.000 - 00:31:05.208, Speaker B: I don't really understand how it works on no.
00:31:05.294 - 00:31:06.920, Speaker C: Can we get into that? Can you explain that?
00:31:06.990 - 00:31:41.196, Speaker D: So they take opposing ideological positions on mev. The optimism camp basically says they kind of phrase mev like this mev is like a small tax on every user transaction. We take that small tax, we put it into a communal pot, which we manage and we use it to fund public goods, we use it to fund development for the chain. It's kind of just like a tax that we put. It's kind of like how the government just taxes you and we're going to use it to build all the infrastructure and make the chain better. So that's the optimism perspective. The arbitrage perspective is the polar opposite.
00:31:41.196 - 00:32:14.110, Speaker D: Mev is bad, taxes on users are bad. We should do everything in our power to avoid this happening. And so they have this fair ordering, fair sequencing model where they basically try to eliminate all of mev and that's not going to be their model. And it kind of begs the question like, well, what is their model? Especially when their token isn't being used for gas and that's kind of like a TBD. But I think the thing also too so those are the two differing ideological positions. The east position is even more nuanced with mev. The east position is basically like mev is bad.
00:32:14.110 - 00:33:04.044, Speaker D: You should optimize your apps to basically not have quite as much of it. But if there is mev. We're just going to give it back to people who are aligned with the community, aka those people holding and staking ETH. And so that's like, yet another position. I think the things that we think about when we think about mev are apps were so poorly designed in 2020, 2021 that we've learned lessons and they're going to get a lot more efficient, specifically on the mev side. And you have mev as kind of like a category and that kind of really directly relates to things like AMMS and just higher latency transactions that happen on chain. You also have models that are coming in kind of like above the AMMS things like payment for order flow and Dflo is a protocol that does this that basically just sells order flow ahead of time to whoever wants it.
00:33:04.044 - 00:33:21.744, Speaker D: Market makers, DAOs, and they monetize and fill the volume that's going through it. And there's no mev in that model. And so it kind of remains to be seen. And it depends on what the dominant Dex model is, whether mev is a really big factor in the future or not. And there's certainly some models which don't have that in it.
00:33:21.862 - 00:33:39.912, Speaker C: But here's my understanding of it. What Arbitrum is inherently saying, if you're pulling mev out of the system, is that they know the fairness of the blocks. It's like up to Arbitram to tell people what the fairness of the blocks is. So then you're taking the auction system out. Yeah, I guess I just don't get that.
00:33:40.046 - 00:34:13.744, Speaker B: I think you need a way to even the way you were positioning that. Michael I think Ethereum should charge a lot for its block space. It's got arguably the most valuable block space out there. I feel like what it's saying is it's got these L two S, right, that that's where it's really cheap to transact. So you can spread a whole bunch of transactions on the L two S across the expensive block space and then that's what makes that model kind of work. Right. But ideally, you would like to see Ethereum and Ethereum stakeholders find a way to value that block space properly at a relatively expensive rate and then extract that value through validators.
00:34:13.744 - 00:34:40.148, Speaker B: But if that's the dominant model for blockchains writ large, then I can see the value of moving onto your own app chain, where if you're an app building on top of either ETH or like a layer one or a layer two, then it's not flowing to your validators, it's flowing to ETH validators, basically. And I kind of think that's the two business models that are emerging here. So I think it's more of a game of leverage.
00:34:40.324 - 00:35:18.836, Speaker D: Yeah. And app chains don't have to be Cosmos, right? Like you have things like boba and Mayti that have forked l two s. And kind of what you do with an l two as far as a business model is you just say, all right, there's one person who's the sequencer, who's sequencing the transactions, and you get to decide basically how much mev is there and how much do you extract. You're auctioning that role off and you're basically saying like, okay, stake, whatever your app chain token is on the L two. And every once in a while you're going to get it selected to play the sequencer role, and you're going to get mev from that. And so this is a concept that works both on ETH and on Cosmos app chains. I think the concept that's important is you're now allowed to be more opinionated on this idea.
00:35:18.836 - 00:35:31.230, Speaker D: Is mev bad or is it good? Should we give it to the community or should we give it to the user? Should we use it to bootstrap things? Or should we just deny it as basically like a regressive tax? And that's like an interesting design space.
00:35:31.920 - 00:35:34.030, Speaker C: Do you have a take on what's the best model?
00:35:36.560 - 00:36:27.336, Speaker D: I think they're really unique. I generally think that if you gave someone a dollar or if you gave some really high quality capital allocator a dollar, that could make their lives better by investing that they'd probably realize more value out of the latter. Situation where someone is kind of like taking money from them a little bit and using it to plan and execute long term strategic goals that can make their lives better. That's the model that I feel like I'm most philosophically aligned with. The last point about mev, and this is orthogonal to what you just asked me, is I feel like there's a strike price at which mev turns back on. And so if you've ever traded in coins on crypto exchanges, you know, below a certain price, the liquidity gets worse just because the market makers kind of turn off and just say, like, I don't want to do this anymore. With mev.
00:36:27.336 - 00:36:50.484, Speaker D: It's kind of like the same thing. If we have enough volume, if the prices are high enough, like these mev shops turn back on, they start competing against each other. They're sending all these super high gas value transactions. They're failing, they're adding fees to the network even though they're not really subtracting anything. There is a strike price above which mev turns on a lot more. And I feel like we're like below that right now. So that's a take, I guess.
00:36:50.602 - 00:37:17.324, Speaker B: I think the market, whether it's good or bad, the market will just decide basically that's what I kind of think. I don't know. I think people will display you could right. ETH holders could basically just decide. I actually don't mind there being inflation. And people who stake and validate, they will get that inflation right? And everyone who's a part of ETH could be like, okay, that's fine, and I'll just get diluted. But what they're saying is, I don't want that to happen.
00:37:17.324 - 00:37:33.200, Speaker B: I don't want it to get it diluted. But validators are still saying, like, I got to get paid for what I'm doing, then a way that they're going to get paid is through mev. And I think that choice has already been made. So I don't think it's even bad or it's good. It's just the way that people are going to prefer.
00:37:34.020 - 00:38:10.780, Speaker D: If you've looked at the yields or just like the estimates of yields. I forget who put this paper out, but right now it's about 6% with transaction fees and inflation. But if you turn on Mev boost and you're in a validator set that has that, that's probably another three or four or 5%. To your point, Michael, there's an argument that this is like 40 50% of yields and is structurally important. And it's crazy to think about because last year it was so much crazier and mev was so much higher. And you probably would be yielding like 2030, probably more than that percent when that was at its height. So it can become really meaningful.
00:38:10.780 - 00:38:23.280, Speaker D: And yeah, we didn't even really know mev existed until a year ago. It was kind of this thing that people talked about, but no one really knew what the deal was. And then flashbots and that dashboard just blew the door open.
00:38:23.430 - 00:38:50.584, Speaker B: All right, I want to pivot away, actually to talk about. There was an announcement. There were a couple of big piece of news this week, actually. One came from Rob Leshner over at Compound Treasury. So I actually want to connect this to a story that we covered a couple of weeks ago. But compound treasury just launched the ability to borrow. So last year they launched this institutional cash management solution and that's powered by Compound protocol.
00:38:50.584 - 00:39:39.540, Speaker B: So treasury is the thing that's building on compound. The protocol which offers 4% Apr on USD and USDC starting today, I guess yesterday when they rolled this out was the ability to actually borrow from compound at like a 6% Apr. And you can borrow USD. Or USDC. They've got a partnership with Circle on the back end as well, that they help them source the USD if need be. The way that this kind of rolls into they're sourcing liquidity either from other clients on compound treasury or they're actually going to the $3 billion locked in compound protocol. So the reason this kind of flows into Compound Three is remember compound kind of rolled out this thing where actually they really simplified their protocol, right, where instead of basically being able to post any collateral to borrow any other type of asset.
00:39:39.540 - 00:40:40.632, Speaker B: What they said is like, hey, you can still post a smaller range of collateral, and the only thing that you can borrow is USDC. And the reason for that I actually caught up with Rob yesterday to talk about this was he's like, look, when we started five years ago, we thought people were going to want to borrow all sorts of things. Now, what we believe and what we've seen over the last couple of years. Everyone just wants to borrow dollars. So basically the way that it works on their back end is if 90% of the demand is just to borrow dollars, then if you're trying to collateralize lending, basically you're trying to establish a ratio, right? So if you have some collateral that's really volatile and you're trying to borrow something else that's very volatile, that's really tricky to maintain that ratio. It's much simpler if you have volatile collateral but you're borrowing something that stays the same. So basically they're trying to do really capital efficient borrowing so you can basically do much more leverage at a much cheaper rate and they're trying to basically just simplify and attack that borrowing USDC use case and then that feeds right into the announcement from compound treasury.
00:40:40.632 - 00:40:58.710, Speaker B: This kind of gives me like circle. We shouted out Jeremy Lair on the last one where they really just simplified their product. I really like what they're doing. I think they're just attacking a big use case and being like this is the only thing that we're going to do. But I don't know what takes you guys have on what they've rolled out.
00:40:59.480 - 00:41:59.960, Speaker A: I generally think that what this does and we've talked about this on previous bell curves is adds more institutional firepower into the lending and borrowing ecosystem for crypto writ large. And I also was checking out compoundtresury.com and you can basically borrow USD USDC against Bitcoin, ETH and other ERC twenty S up to ninety percent. It's just open term, you can pay it back whenever you want. This is a new construct that frankly just hasn't existed in the space yet and having more of these products and product categories will institutionalize and having to be on chain which is going to be a really important component talk about this versus the centralized lending platforms that have gone bust over the last few months. This is just a step in the right direction generally, but broadly this is going to be a big driver for growth in the space I think, in the next cycle.
00:42:00.860 - 00:42:04.600, Speaker C: Michael, why is this something that hasn't existed before? I think I'm missing something.
00:42:04.750 - 00:42:28.432, Speaker A: The exact product of open term on chain fixed rate lending just is not something that you've had an open term variable rate and you've had some fixed rate but not really at scale and really kind of as an institutional product. I mean ave you've obviously been able to do fixed rate for a while but I think the scale is kind of just the difference. Major here.
00:42:28.486 - 00:42:29.136, Speaker C: Got it.
00:42:29.238 - 00:43:00.700, Speaker B: I think the question that and this is one that I can't really wrap my head around because we talked about this on last week's episode, too, was just that the short term I'm sure this will reverse, but, like short term headwinds of TradFi yields being higher than yields that you can get in DeFi, I think that's a really tough problem to overcome and I don't know what they're going to do in the short term there. Because that was supposed to be like the Trojan horse, right? That was supposed to lure capital in because you could chase a higher yield and it didn't really work. Honestly.
00:43:02.480 - 00:43:06.936, Speaker C: It brought a shit ton of money and it just like there's like no it didn't.
00:43:07.048 - 00:43:07.710, Speaker B: No.
00:43:10.240 - 00:43:10.940, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:43:11.090 - 00:43:41.240, Speaker B: It brought degenerate yield in, right, which caused crypto equity prices to explode. There weren't like banks being like, oh yeah, I'm only getting 3% here, I see 8% in crypto. Let me earn yield in this safe way. Because they were all like, these yields aren't real. And they were all kind of right about that. So yeah, it attracted a lot of people, but there weren't institutions and big hedge funds and fixed income money market type things that are like, let me take advantage of the spread in yields being offered in crypto versus TradFi.
00:43:41.820 - 00:43:43.032, Speaker A: Don't make me the bear here.
00:43:43.086 - 00:43:47.450, Speaker B: No, come on, don't stare at me like that.
00:43:47.980 - 00:44:21.712, Speaker D: I mean, bull markets, a race to see who can import capital into crypto feels like bear markets are kind of like who can export capital faster through Coin shares or Coinbase. If USD yields are lower on chain than a T bill, that's going to be difficult. But if you think about ETH, the yield is nice. We'll take that. But the thing that's interesting is that you get paid to hold an asset that has a potential venture scale return. And that's just something that Tradfied could never offer. For better, for worse.
00:44:21.712 - 00:44:31.560, Speaker D: Same with a lot of these, call them like longer tail coins. Sure the yield is nice, but a lot of people are just buying it because of the lottery ticket.
00:44:32.220 - 00:44:37.050, Speaker C: Yeah. And the extra 4% on Lido is just a little kicker, right?
00:44:42.000 - 00:45:07.444, Speaker B: So bravo. Again to Rob. That's really exciting, what you guys are know in terms of governance proposals, a super light, super light week actually. But there was actually an update too. So we talked about know coinbase institutional rewards. They submitted a proposal on Maker to actually take some of their PSM, some of the USDC that's just sitting in the PSM and basically custody it with Coinbase and earn 1.5% on that.
00:45:07.444 - 00:45:30.468, Speaker B: So one thing that I didn't understand, we were talking about it last week, but looking deeply into it. What they're actually doing is there's center consortium, that's the issuer of USDC. That's a partnership in between Coinbase and Circle. And there's a revenue split there. So the 1.5% people we pointed out that was below what you could get, like Fed Funds is going to 4%. We were kind of like, how is 1.5%,
00:45:30.468 - 00:46:14.452, Speaker B: where are they getting that? So Circle is earning, USDC is earning whatever they're earning, right? It's like probably around three or 4% because they're putting it in short term government security, short term corporate bonds, that kind of thing. And then there's a rev split in between circle and Coinbase and it depends on where they're custodied. So if the USDC is custody at Coinbase, then they get a bigger percentage of the split. So basically what Coinbase is saying is, hey, if you guys move that USDC over to Coinbase and custody it with us, we're going to get a higher percentage of that yield. We're just going to share some of that with you. And the advantage there is that's why they're able to not even unwrap the USDC. So it's still super liquid for Maker.
00:46:14.452 - 00:46:45.990, Speaker B: And then there's this new proposal from Coin shares which is they're saying, hey, all right, that's a good move for you guys. Take a smaller amount, 500 million USDC, give it to us. We're actually going to unwrap it and invest it basically in this portfolio of different really short term securities. And the way they structured is they're going to give them sofa, which is like now 2.25% plus some upside. So whatever they outperform on sofa, it's like one third goes to Maker. So they get some upside on the 2.25%.
00:46:45.990 - 00:47:18.540, Speaker B: Coin shares, gets the other third, and then the other third Coin shares is allowed to buy MKR from Maker. So it's just a more variable fee structure. And I think the trade off is it's less liquid because you don't have like inter block liquidity there because you're unwrapping it. You'd have to unwind that position. But you do get more yield and it's frankly, it's variable yield, which is probably pretty good. They probably want that because if yields go up, then probably their token is going down. So it's probably a pretty good hedge, honestly.
00:47:18.540 - 00:47:23.996, Speaker B: So I kind of like it, actually. Shout out to coin shares. I thought it was a good proposal.
00:47:24.188 - 00:48:00.812, Speaker D: DeFi is back. That's my take. I remember when you had that narrative like a year ago and I forgot what happened to that. But it feels like this. Like you pair one corporate entity with one protocol, like Coinbase and Maker, you have compound treasury. And like it feels like that's going to be a real lever, especially in a world where the protocols who don't have access to the outside world are just going to be less able to generate real cash flow if that's where the yields are at least. But it's cool to see everyone kind of like it felt like in the bull market we didn't have the proper time to kind of introduce everyone to each other.
00:48:00.812 - 00:48:19.984, Speaker D: Like Coinbase meet Maker, okay, you should get to know each other, start working together, build the muscle memory of taking in USDC or die and lending it off into the TradFi markets. And I think that makes the crypto ecosystem stronger and more resilient as a result. So I like that this is kind of back as an idea and I think it's an interesting growth alley for.
00:48:20.022 - 00:49:31.770, Speaker A: Avenue for DeFi Anecdotally as well. We've been seeing a lot of pitches recently in the direction of what we've called before public permission DeFi where you have some regulated institution or set of institutions that are going to be wanting to build into the DeFi ecosystem. They don't really know how yet or they don't know how to integrate. So maybe they're going through a custody provider or maybe they're going through like a coinbase and they're trying to get in but now they want access and now they're going to start interacting in ways that they just haven't been able to thus far. And I think that we're also going to start to see new layer twos pop up regionally which are focused on these different ecosystems because Latin America EU us all different rules and you have to abide by those when you're a regulated financial institution. And so I think you're going to have to also have regulated regionalized chains as so I think CDFI, whatever we want to call it, public permissioned DeFi. I think this combinatorial effect of having institution with large customer base, larger balance sheet, whatever it may be interacting on chain now is going to be the narrative of a lot of what DeFi is for the next couple of years.
00:49:32.860 - 00:50:02.976, Speaker D: Last thing I'll say is it's good to see these all the DeFi protocols basically have business models that are endogenous to the on chain world and they work really well when the on chain world is popping off and really bullish. But having another tool in your toolkit for when the markets are bearish and you can start exporting instead of importing it just helps build like a countercyclical business model which is what a lot of crypto needs right now. And building the counter cyclical business model just helps you integrate everything with TradFi and just make it more sticky, which.
00:50:02.998 - 00:50:26.840, Speaker B: Is good, I would say. I think one of the other benefits of this in general is they probably should have been doing this stuff from but it's like during the bull market, right? I mean, who has time, right? Like why are you trying to eke out 3% on your treasury? The whole world is at your fingertips and you'll probably get some financial professionals in there as well that manage this stuff for them, which I think is good.
00:50:26.910 - 00:51:04.252, Speaker C: I think this eventually becomes a service. I think there's a unicorn company built here where instead of just going to a Coin shares or these one off, it almost feels like Coin. Yeah, I just think that it won't look like this in a year or two or three years from now where maker sends it to Coin shares, then they send some other stuff to Coinbase and then another protocol sends it here. Basically whoever's winning the sales deals, it's like someone's going to end up winning like building a business just to manage these treasuries or it goes in house. Although it probably doesn't go in house actually. It's too much capital. Nope.
00:51:04.416 - 00:51:10.660, Speaker B: I bet circle launches. Either Circle launches or someone else launches tokenized Treasuries.
00:51:10.820 - 00:51:14.216, Speaker C: We told this to Circle's product team, like a year ago, right?
00:51:14.398 - 00:51:48.756, Speaker B: Circle should definitely do this because that's what you want. You would rather have that you'd rather actually have because this is all indirect, right? Like circle's, like internalizing. They're managing that off World and on World Connection, but really what you'd rather just do, and they're earning all of the yield for that, which is like, amazing for Circle, but people are going to look at that and be like, I want some of that. So basically what someone's going to do is either launch a competitor Circle, or if Circle could get out ahead of it, they should just do what they're doing with stablecoins but for Treasuries, and then they should just manage the liquidity in between that. And that would be like, an amazing business, I feel like, for them.
00:51:48.858 - 00:51:52.230, Speaker A: If I were them, would that need to be a regulated product?
00:51:53.720 - 00:52:13.548, Speaker B: I would imagine. But that's where this is all going, right? Like, this is all going towards permissioned DeFi? Totally, I would guess, or at least a large swath of permissioned. It but I don't think would it need to be any more regulated than what they're doing at the USDC because they're just providing a portal for dollars.
00:52:13.714 - 00:52:21.020, Speaker D: Once you get into money management money, like, that's like extra bonus points, regulation.
00:52:21.840 - 00:52:25.968, Speaker B: Do those guys get regulated a lot? Money market funds. They pay attention to that.
00:52:26.134 - 00:52:33.510, Speaker D: The people you meet who do that stuff, they talk about regulations. It's just like they hate it. It takes up like 60, 70% of their day.
00:52:35.160 - 00:52:46.512, Speaker A: Yeah. There's also a huge difference between who is regulating dollars versus who is regulating Treasuries. You're talking about the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency versus the SEC. Two very different conversations.
00:52:46.656 - 00:53:00.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really good point. All right, actually the last two stories basically on the agenda of Fidelity potentially launching Bitcoin and their brokerages and then Polygon partnering with Starbucks. I don't know. Do you guys have a preference between the two of us?
00:53:00.880 - 00:53:28.390, Speaker A: I mean, the Fidelity potentially launching Retail Crypto, I think we talked to someone on their product team or something in 2019 and they were like, oh yeah, next year we're going to be able to have Retail Crypto. I feel like this product has been years away. It has been a year away for years. And it's great to see it come to fruition, but yeah, tough to have it come to fruition in the bear market.
00:53:29.000 - 00:53:34.216, Speaker B: But it's hilarious how this all got leaked, which is Mike Novograd, a little.
00:53:34.238 - 00:53:35.000, Speaker C: Birdie.
00:53:36.860 - 00:53:37.720, Speaker B: Dude.
00:53:39.980 - 00:53:42.890, Speaker D: Christmas party, saying random shit to people.
00:53:43.980 - 00:53:57.980, Speaker B: Yeah, seriously. Getting tattoos, blowing up people's spots on stage. Oh, my God. So he said this on stage at Salt. He's like, a little birdie told me that Fidelity is potentially launching Crypto on their brokerages.
00:53:59.440 - 00:54:04.850, Speaker A: And then he tries to back out of it, where he's like, well. I hope the birdie's right, but I don't know the birdie keeper on, too.
00:54:06.900 - 00:54:40.724, Speaker B: This birdie is highly unreliable. That would be a pretty big deal to give Fidelity a little bit of credit. I know they move super slowly, but they also, in terms of a big regulated institute, they manage over a trillion dollars worth of assets. They've done a lot, I think, for advancing the legitimacy of this entire space in the minds of the greater world, but certainly finance in general. It'd be a huge deal if they rolled bitcoin out when I think it is bitcoin, by the way, is it crypto or is it bitcoin?
00:54:40.772 - 00:54:41.936, Speaker A: No, it's just bitcoin.
00:54:41.988 - 00:54:58.748, Speaker C: That big of it. It's just bitcoin. I think they will do ETH stuff later, but they are just bitcoin. Yeah. ETH is a decade from now. I don't know. I don't think this is as big of a deal as you're making it out to be, Mike.
00:54:58.748 - 00:55:00.130, Speaker C: I mean, I guess it.
00:55:01.860 - 00:55:02.416, Speaker D: I'll take.
00:55:02.438 - 00:55:30.008, Speaker B: The other side of that I'll take the other side of because in terms of retail brokerages in the US, it's like E Trade, Fidelity I'm missing one of them. It's enormous distribution. Basically what you're saying is this is like the third biggest distribution pipe and you're going to put bitcoin smack in the middle of and that's I think that's an enormous I think it's an enormous deal because that's basically the way bitcoin has to scale. Bitcoin isn't going to scale through utility in crypto. You have to get people outside of crypto to like no, you have to.
00:55:30.014 - 00:55:46.370, Speaker C: Ask the question of, like, what is the percentage of people who use TD Ameritrade and E Trade and Charles Schwab and Fidelity who want to own bitcoin, but haven't bought bitcoin yet because they're not comfortable opening a coinbase or kraken or and that's that's the opportunity for.
00:55:48.500 - 00:55:55.252, Speaker B: Look at the premium on GBTC. That is kind of what fucked everything whole. That that's the whole thing.
00:55:55.306 - 00:55:56.660, Speaker D: Now there's a big discount.
00:55:57.240 - 00:56:02.708, Speaker C: Yeah. This is like a product for my uncle. It's like for the literally thought of.
00:56:02.714 - 00:56:04.804, Speaker D: My uncle as well, like a guy.
00:56:04.842 - 00:56:07.380, Speaker C: Who my uncle will eat this up.
00:56:07.530 - 00:56:14.648, Speaker D: Yeah. I've tried to get him to set up a Coin discount for, like, 40 years. He refuses to do anything that isn't through the Morgan Stanley wealth management platform.
00:56:14.814 - 00:56:17.096, Speaker C: Actually, you know what? If Mike was 20 years later, this.
00:56:17.118 - 00:56:28.956, Speaker B: Product would be I was going to say that's why I yeah. Because I don't love figuring this shit out, man. Mike yeah. 1000%. This is me in five years. But I think that's how most people are. I think you should be judging it.
00:56:28.978 - 00:56:33.020, Speaker C: Based on how most people out of Coinbase is putting it on Fidelity.
00:56:33.540 - 00:56:47.910, Speaker B: I am thinking about my dear old dad. Honestly, whenever he has to make a transfer on his account, he's, like, messaging me, like, am I doing this right? And it's like, that's how most people are. I think I buy that. It's fair.
00:56:48.840 - 00:56:59.320, Speaker C: My dad still uses the local bank, the local town bank, because he's able to get on a call with them when he wants to do something. That's awesome.
00:56:59.390 - 00:57:34.544, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, my visceral reaction to any announcement of like, oh, this institution is coming into crypto has just historically been a nothing burger. When all said and done, I'm hopeful that this is not that this was probably one of, if not the biggest potential financial providers are potentially getting into the space. But yeah, just historically my visceral recall is great. What was it called? The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and all the institutions that were coming in. Yeah, it's tough to see sometimes.
00:57:34.742 - 00:57:36.390, Speaker B: I mean, I'm with you on that.
00:57:37.720 - 00:57:42.150, Speaker C: It's never one thing in a silo, right? It's all these things just end up compounding on each other.
00:57:42.680 - 00:58:25.508, Speaker B: I actually have a question for the two of you guys. When someone comes up and you probably get a lot of pitches like this, right? Like, hey, I've got this idea, real estate on the blockchain. How do you guys respond to stuff like that first? Do you think that eventually ends up happening? But the reason I'm asking is, again, just because we had this conference yesterday and I was getting almost like this visceral sense of deja vu where all this stuff that I hadn't heard in the past two or three years, but it was basically like new iterations on blockchain, not Bitcoin or Enterprise blockchain or whatever it is. And it always kind of resonates with new people who haven't been around and heard that before. So I'm just curious how you guys respond to when those sorts of ideas get brought up.
00:58:25.594 - 00:59:19.510, Speaker A: So I don't think it's not going to happen. I think it's just a question of when and how. We had the whole security token concept whenever that was 2018 securitize harbor, that model definitely was tried, but I don't think you had the capital nor the scale to pull that off. And frankly, that was also at the time when you're talking about securitizing as we're talking about like mortgages and commercial loans that were going to yield you four, five, 6% when you've got WiFi and all these crazy DFI summer token economics happening in the background and you can get thousands of percent APY, right? And so you kind of have to choose the right market cycle and the right customer base. And I think at the time it was just a mismatch of customers and product. Whether that's we're talking about getting 2.28 sofa plus a third of the variable on top of that, maybe now is the right time, I don't know.
00:59:20.680 - 01:00:16.168, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the other thing is if you see 100 pitches now, our job is probably like the first thing we do is disqualifying 80 just based on like you haven't really thought through this idea maze. You haven't really thought through how complex the regulatory implications are. You haven't really thought throughout how competitive the vertical is. And I would say most of the disqualified pitches that we see are things like neo banks or things like we do see a lot of real estate on the blockchain style pitches, but real estate is one of the most regulated sub industries of the financial sector that exists today. And so I think a lot of the stuff is just easier to build endogenous on chain where everything sits on chain and it's not connected to the real world. But hopefully we get to a point where the regulations are easier enough that we can actually make those pitches viable. But right now, I would say that they're pretty far away.
01:00:16.334 - 01:00:27.320, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough. All right, let's talk about Starbucks and NFTs on polygon. Yeah, you want to take us through this? I feel like you have been looking at it.
01:00:27.470 - 01:00:54.260, Speaker C: You love Starbucks. This Monday, Starbucks announced a partnership with Polygon and they created a new rewards program. I actually honestly don't know too much about this. I don't know why I'm taking it. But here's what I know. They announced this new rewards program, starbucks Odyssey, starbucks Rewards loyalty program. Members and Starbucks partner employees are going to be able to earn and purchase these NFTs, which Starbucks is calling Journey Stamps.
01:00:54.260 - 01:01:13.690, Speaker C: And it's built on polygon. That's what I know about it. But I think the important thing to think about here is just I think it's fascinating that Starbucks is doing this. Starbucks is not just a coffee brand. They are one of the biggest financial institutions in the US. They have $1.6 billion in deposits just sitting around.
01:01:13.690 - 01:01:45.296, Speaker C: They use that to they don't have to go borrow when they want to go build a new place and they want to do a huge ad campaign or upgrade equipment. They don't go borrow from a bank at 2% or now 5% or whatever it is. They dip into their $1.6 billion in deposits. And the deposits come from their rewards program. So their rewards program is really interesting. They rolled out basically in 2008, a loyalty program with physical cards.
01:01:45.296 - 01:02:12.536, Speaker C: And then in 2014, they rolled out the mobile app and they put the gift cards onto the mobile app. And you get one star if you purchase something. I don't really go to Starbucks, actually, but I think if you purchase something at Starbucks, you get one star. And if you purchase something with royalty points, you get two stars. And then the stars get you things. So then you're heavily incentivized to use your royalty points. So then it's like, hey, just dump $100 into Starbucks.
01:02:12.536 - 01:02:39.990, Speaker C: You know you're going to spend $100 this month on Starbucks. You'll get double the points if you're spending your royalty dollars. Essentially, it's like SUSD, right? You get double the rewards if you spend SUSD. What that has caused is there's over $10 billion in rewards dollars that are added to starbucks every single year, and right now, they have an excess of 1.6 billion. That's just like prepaid, right?
01:02:40.760 - 01:02:43.060, Speaker A: It's like the prepaid. Okay.
01:02:43.210 - 01:02:48.180, Speaker C: Every single year, rewards members load $10 billion onto Starbucks cards.
01:02:48.340 - 01:03:05.550, Speaker B: Over half of Starbucks that's bought in the US is done from this program. 25 million people in the rewards program. It's pretty nuts. Is it a huge because I first heard this well before I what did you guys think about this? Because I first kind of heard this, I was like, I'm not really sure. But it's interesting.
01:03:06.240 - 01:03:54.220, Speaker A: I'm not a huge Starbucks loyalty user, although if I pulled up my app right now, I probably have like $20 sitting in there because I just forgot about it or something, which is, I think, where that 1.6 comes from. But I think this sounds kind of like a Pokemon Go game for Starbucks users customers. And I think having an NFT that you can earn and you can sell, it's an interesting component. But once again, it kind of goes back to the question of, like, what's the overlap of Starbucks customers and NFT fans? Maybe it's a bunch of know Gen Z, Gen Y, Gen A on Solana, or maybe now it's going to be polygon. So it does kind of feel like it'll be interesting to see what the overlap is of those two customer bases.
01:03:54.720 - 01:04:10.700, Speaker C: It's funny, this is a good segue from the real estate on the blockchain conversation, because this is the same group of conversation. You're at a party in 2017. Guy number one says to you, hey, I'm putting real estate on the blockchain. Guy number two says to you, hey, we're putting loyalty points on the blockchain.
01:04:10.780 - 01:04:14.156, Speaker A: And like, we're putting Starbucks rewards on the blockchain.
01:04:14.268 - 01:04:14.930, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:19.960 - 01:05:01.456, Speaker D: The numbers behind Starbucks are staggering, but even when I was at Netflix, the gift card program was kind of like this thing that was run by people who weren't know, core entertainment industry veterans, but it drove so much of the business that everyone had all this reverence for them. And it works in the US. It works even better in South America in emerging markets, where the financial ecosystem isn't quite as stable. And you can earn and basically acquire a ton of customers through this. And sure, maybe you're giving them three or $4 in these imaginary rewards points that you have them spend, but that's far lower than the CAC to acquire a new customer and keep them loyal and buying stuff in general. So you bring on people onto the blockchain. You're cool with me.
01:05:01.456 - 01:05:16.810, Speaker D: I think the risk to Polygon is basically that you kind of have all of these dead experiments that just live on your chain and slowly get wound down, but you have to take swings, and they're going for it, and we definitely respect that. So we're definitely on board with it.
01:05:17.420 - 01:06:04.020, Speaker A: One of the interesting questions that I think would be fun to see is just, can polygon keep up with it? Let's assume this is really successful or frankly, just like 1% of Starbucks customers end up using this. That's going to be probably the largest application on a blockchain period. And can Polygon keep up with that scale? There is a game that did an NFT drop to its Twitter followers and they had to mint 400,000 NFTs on Polygon. That was about 40% of the entire activity for like a month period on Polygon at the time. The numbers that are going to be an interesting mismatch is just like, can the scale of Starbucks be put on a blockchain right now?
01:06:04.170 - 01:06:31.388, Speaker D: You've seen pretty deep reorgs in Polygon already happening and I'm going to feel a lot more confident in Polygon when they switch to whatever the ZK technology is that they're building out. But what they have right now just feels like, yeah, you've scaled for the number of users that are on a blockchain today, but if it gets ten X bigger, you have real problems. And I think that's not just them, by the way. It's a lot of people probably other than like ETH and the L two S. But it is concerning, I would say.
01:06:31.474 - 01:07:08.650, Speaker C: Let me do a thought here's. Maybe unintended here would be like best case scenario of the Starbucks thing, I think, is that if you look at all loyalty programs, they're in these closed systems. So it's like if I get airline points or something, they just sit until I end up using them. And like, Starbucks points, you can't really do anything with them. Maybe there's like a cash out thing, but you can't really do anything with them. I do wonder if this like because you've got the 800 pound gorilla in loyalty programs, which is Starbucks, there's probably like who are the other big players in Loyalties? It's like, I know H and M has a big program with like 100 million people. Like Amazon Prime is a huge like Amazon is obviously one.
01:07:08.650 - 01:07:31.232, Speaker C: Sephora has a big one. But I feel like Starbucks is really the 800 pound gorilla in the consumer side of things. This could drive like, what if this sparked moving loyalty programs into an open system? Brands are not incentivized to do that, but maybe consumers start demanding it. I'm trying to think through other options.
01:07:31.286 - 01:08:12.960, Speaker D: Here, but the benefit of it being a closed system is that if somebody forgets about their points, it's just like deleted. Basically to Michael's point, he's probably got $20 on his phone that he's never going to use. But if you establish market for that, there's a clearing price and there's more incentives to sell it, there's more incentives to use it. Your gift card program gets less effective rather than more effective. And so I think you have to go back to what are the first principles reasons to do this and blockchains. Being cool is, I think, a valid reason, but what economic value does it either Ascribe or subtract to this whole process. The subtraction side seems pretty visible.
01:08:12.960 - 01:08:36.548, Speaker D: The NFT stuff kind of seems like the linchpin. If those NFTs are actually cool and you're creating something of real value that does not just allow your customers to draw more on your inventory for free, that feels like you're creating value and that could create an ecosystem. But it can't just be the loyalty points. I don't think I agree, though.
01:08:36.634 - 01:08:40.840, Speaker A: It's got to be consumer demanded. It can't be supplier pushed.
01:08:41.980 - 01:08:43.320, Speaker C: A brand would never do that.
01:08:43.390 - 01:09:09.616, Speaker A: Right. But if you can pull one on in the same way that Fidelity is probably going to have the same effect here in their own ecosystem. If Fidelity has it, then Schwab is probably thinking about this, working on this. ETrade is probably doing the same. If Starbucks is successful with this and Starbucks customers like this, I think 100% right. You're going to have to start considering this as a strategy for if you have a large loyalty program and customer base that wants this.
01:09:09.798 - 01:10:03.548, Speaker B: Yeah. Did you guys listen to that? The all in where I forget, Friedberger would have like, all brands are going to die in 30 years. Do you hear that explanation? I actually thought it was kind of an interesting exercise. I'm not sure if that was a pretty hot take, but it did kind of make me think because I was also thinking I think a lot of it comes down to the NFTs. And if you actually read the text on Starbucks press release, they're like people, users can go through fun quests to learn more about coffee and Starbucks history and it's like nobody wants to do you know, maybe it could work for Nike, honestly. And you know what? You know who's actually basically trying this? At like there's another odyssey that's going on right now. That's the Arbitram odyssey and that's about to get restarted.
01:10:03.548 - 01:10:19.240, Speaker B: That's a really interesting example of Old World and new World, right. They're kind of trying the same thing, right? They're trying to engage a user base and get them to go and do all of these different things using NFTs, I bet one is going to be way more successful than the other. I know they're trying to do it at a different scale.
01:10:19.660 - 01:11:10.152, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the first odyssey for Arbitrum literally broke because of lack of scale. So they had to go back and fix it and make it better to be able to keep up with the scale. I just once again question, do you have a product customer mismatch? And with Arbitrum, obviously you don't because you're talking to web three native, potential customers and users. With Starbucks, you might have some overlap, but it does feel like your tuti aunt and uncle being like, hey, I'm cool, I'm on the blockchain. And it's kind of like trying too hard sometimes. If they can do it in a cool way and consumers are enjoying it and like, the think, you know, it'll be interesting and could have massive effects pulling in other brands. But yeah, it's just a question of can they pull it off for this customer base?
01:11:10.286 - 01:11:29.452, Speaker B: Did you guys see the coinbase launched? They basically took a page out of Uber's Playbook and they made it extremely transparent. They were like, hey, here's basically a map. And you can see how politicians in your area think about crypto. Just going to throw that out there. It was a genius move.
01:11:29.506 - 01:11:30.348, Speaker C: I love that move.
01:11:30.434 - 01:11:34.000, Speaker A: It was awesome. Hats off to Brian and the team for pulling that off.
01:11:34.070 - 01:11:35.040, Speaker B: Hats off.
01:11:35.190 - 01:11:42.450, Speaker D: Yeah, I think they're the good guys. I wouldn't say they haven't done anything cool. I generally conceive of them as, like, good guys.
01:11:43.700 - 01:11:45.830, Speaker A: I mean, they're definitely fighting the good fight.
01:11:46.680 - 01:11:51.424, Speaker D: Yeah, they're suing the Tornado cash people. They're doing this. They're putting money behind political efforts.
01:11:51.552 - 01:12:00.504, Speaker B: Well, now I'm feeling bad. Now I'm feeling bad about my statement. I've ashamed. Tornado Cash is cool, actually, too.
01:12:00.542 - 01:12:02.744, Speaker C: That's good. Can we do Memes of the week?
01:12:02.942 - 01:12:04.730, Speaker D: Yeah memes of the week.
01:12:05.340 - 01:12:12.270, Speaker C: I just have a picture that I thought was really funny. You guys see the avalanche? KKR News?
01:12:13.280 - 01:12:14.076, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:12:14.258 - 01:12:27.740, Speaker C: Avalanche is helping KKR put things on the blockchain. This was just like, KKR makes history. We're preparing and building towards a future in which securities are traded on public blockchains. Web three's ability to manage digital identities.
01:12:27.820 - 01:12:31.452, Speaker A: That's not even a meme. It's literally just an ad asset ownership.
01:12:31.596 - 01:12:42.390, Speaker C: These guys are a meme. This is hilarious. This is like the most antithetical Web three crypto image I've ever seen. I just love this. This is making me crack up.
01:12:43.160 - 01:12:52.410, Speaker D: Interesting selection. Yeah, that's an interesting shot. I'm trying to think of what the best Meme of the week has been.
01:12:54.300 - 01:13:00.060, Speaker B: Leo got a new girlfriend. She's 27. So inflation affects everyone, including Leonardo.
01:13:00.560 - 01:13:02.510, Speaker A: That was literally going to be my main.
01:13:06.240 - 01:13:07.404, Speaker C: Good for him.
01:13:07.522 - 01:13:09.160, Speaker B: Yeah. Back on his feet.
01:13:09.240 - 01:13:14.720, Speaker C: I do think, actually only met Ledger. I was big. Kobe met Ledger.
01:13:15.460 - 01:13:27.990, Speaker D: Kobe's really nice guy when you meet him in person. Yeah, he's good for the space, too. Even when he throws bombs on Twitter. I'm like, if Kobe ever comes for you on Twitter, just move to a different country and change your name. It's over.
01:13:29.160 - 01:13:41.370, Speaker B: I agree. I thought that was kind of a heartwarming picture, actually. I thought that was really nice. I was like, they're meeting in know. Ledger just looks like the nicest guy on the face of the planet. Honestly, they're both great.
01:13:42.860 - 01:13:52.220, Speaker A: Did you see the Ledger memes of what people were? Ledger definitely closed drawers with his hips.
01:13:54.400 - 01:14:16.672, Speaker B: I listened to a podcast where he defended it. He's like, Everyone does that, right? I was like, I do that too. Yeah, for sure, man. Ledger is the kind of guy who says after a rain, the plants really needed this. Yeah, there are a lot of good ones. I do actually just to return to the coinbase thing for a second. That's just like a savvy move and everything.
01:14:16.672 - 01:14:44.860, Speaker B: But I do think that's like a move really in the right space. Because if we do want to move the ecosystem forward and mean you have to get politics involved, right? I don't think it's a particularly smart strategy to just flip the bird to everyone and be like, I don't need you and I can go live in the do. I'll advocate for what I said a couple of weeks ago. I live in America and I like living in America and I think just engaging politicians and it sucks. Nobody likes to do this, but playing the game is the right way to move the space forward in the right way.
01:14:44.930 - 01:15:20.280, Speaker A: I don't think the industry is flipping the bird and saying we're going to go live in the metaverse. I think the industry is knives out right now. And ever since whatever that bill was last summer or maybe two summers ago, I can't even remember now, where the industry basically got out the vote and started calling everybody. At least in California you couldn't leave messages on our senators phones anymore because literally the inbox was full. That type of stuff I think was a rallying cry for what we need. And now you've got PACs being set up left and right for going after these opportunities.
01:15:20.620 - 01:15:27.800, Speaker D: We like it. It's a movement. You got to be behind it. You can't just be flipping shitcoins. There's more to it than that.
01:15:27.870 - 01:15:32.220, Speaker C: Speaking of flipping shitcoins, do you see that board Ape is coming out with another NFT collection?
01:15:33.920 - 01:15:41.376, Speaker D: So G Money told me this. Do you know how many different individual pieces of NFT IP that Board Ape has?
01:15:41.478 - 01:15:46.720, Speaker B: Wait a SEC, I think did you mention like 250,000?
01:15:46.790 - 01:15:47.388, Speaker C: Ridiculous.
01:15:47.484 - 01:15:51.724, Speaker D: Maybe I said this before. Do we need more?
01:15:51.862 - 01:15:52.500, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:52.650 - 01:16:05.050, Speaker D: Is now the right time? These are questions that I would be asking but yeah, I don't know. I don't know if more land is what we need now. More metaverse land.
01:16:05.660 - 01:16:19.290, Speaker C: More land. The other side. The other deeds were just sold for like a million bucks last week. Who's buying other space land?
01:16:20.720 - 01:16:22.152, Speaker B: It's a good inflation edge.
01:16:22.296 - 01:16:56.136, Speaker D: There's so many times I ask myself, who is doing this? Like the ETH proof of work trade? You're telling me like tens of billions of dollars of notional exposure thought that they were going to make like a billion dollars from ETH proof of work? That's unbelievably silly. I can't figure out who that is. Who's buying other deeds for a million dollars each? Is it like a fund? It doesn't really seem like it could be one of our contemporaries. Is it like a rich retail whale? That doesn't seem right either. A lot of these things just like maybe they're just like from China and it's just like a different participant set. But I don't get it.
01:16:56.158 - 01:16:57.240, Speaker C: Blame it on China.
01:16:58.460 - 01:17:15.532, Speaker B: Blame it on Chinaman. Wow. Looks ugly on you, Vince. Looks really ugly. Last question for you guys. Do you guys see Doodles raised this week too? Doodles did a raise. What do you guys think of that?
01:17:15.586 - 01:17:22.800, Speaker D: Companies and just doggy on them. I don't know. Congrats.
01:17:27.220 - 01:17:27.824, Speaker B: Hats off.
01:17:27.862 - 01:17:30.800, Speaker A: To raise in this market is the only sentiment that I have.
01:17:30.950 - 01:17:45.936, Speaker D: I think he was like a $750,000,000 valuation, which implies that there was some sort of bidding war, which implies that there were multiple parties who thought this was a good idea. Maybe it is. Maybe I'm just wrong, but it seems kind of silly.
01:17:46.048 - 01:17:49.850, Speaker C: That was like the kindest way to say that you don't think this is a good idea.
01:17:50.700 - 01:17:59.530, Speaker D: I mean, listen, we didn't invest in it, nor were we offered allocation, so let's not get it twisted. But we didn't try to get it either.
01:18:01.120 - 01:18:16.850, Speaker B: I have a question for you guys, actually just on NFTs in general, do you think because there was some pushback to this, which was like, hey, if these VCs want to exposure this project, they should have just bought the NFT, right? They didn't actually need to raise equity capital to fund. You guys think about that?
01:18:18.660 - 01:18:20.050, Speaker D: We've heard that before.
01:18:20.580 - 01:18:25.812, Speaker A: Yeah. So I don't know who did this deal. I think one so messed up.
01:18:25.866 - 01:18:28.816, Speaker B: I got a bag. You don't like this bag? I don't like this bag.
01:18:28.848 - 01:18:30.790, Speaker D: Looks right here.
01:18:33.400 - 01:19:03.212, Speaker A: Here's some of the inside track of what probably these funds had to go through. Many of these funds literally can't hold on to Tokens. Unless you're a registered investment advisor, you can't buy Tokens or Token NFTs and hold them in your fund. So you have to buy the equity of the company behind it. And I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case here. And I don't know who actually did the raise, but depending on who it is, anyone can go on FINRA and look up whether or not they're in. Yeah, that's probably more of the like.
01:19:03.266 - 01:19:30.664, Speaker C: My take on this is on what you just said, Mike, of people being like, buy my like they should have bought the NFTs is people are miss understanding what they're getting. When they get an NFT, they are thinking that it is an asset that they are investing in and assets should go up. It is a consumer product. It is a collectible. Like, when you buy a watch, you're like, I buy this watch because I like the watch. If it also goes up, that's nice. If you buy a rolly and it goes up, that's nice.
01:19:30.664 - 01:19:40.044, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, it's a consumer product and it's a collectible. And that's what NFTs are, are just consumer products. They're not these assets that should go up.
01:19:40.082 - 01:19:42.750, Speaker A: And they definitely don't represent equity in the company.
01:19:43.520 - 01:20:28.616, Speaker D: No. Let's say that Rolex raised a huge round and you own a Rolex. Are you going to be like, why did nobody buy my rolex for 1.5 X with some of those doesn't make any sense. And so I don't think that that makes sense for people to think in this context. I think the promise is that if Rolex raises a billion dollars, it'll up the brand profile, it'll up the lendiness, it'll make in time what you hold more valuable, but it won't be through a direct purchase. So I kind of don't have a lot of sympathy for that perspective because if you think this is a long term asset, you're not like, why are you not buying my bag tomorrow? And that's really how you should be investing at the end of the day.
01:20:28.798 - 01:21:05.988, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a concept in crypto that seems like kind of flipped to me, which is the opposite of what you guys do, early stage equity investing, which is you buy and you're very concentrated at the beginning, but then you basically get a smaller part of a larger pie as things go on. And I kind of feel like there's this pervasive idea in crypto specifically, where it's like I should be rewarded for being very early and keep getting a larger part of the pie and not necessarily a larger part of the pie, but that reward should continue accrue to me passively. And I fundamentally don't think that's necessarily true, to be honest.
01:21:06.074 - 01:21:53.460, Speaker D: I demand employment forever my money. It's just like I don't understand that perspective. For us, it's always like when you buy equity in a company, every single round that you raise after that round, you get diluted, you have enough chance to put in more money if you want and re up, but you don't get anything for free. And generally everyone is lined with you have a smaller piece of a larger pie as time goes on and you monetize through that. Having a larger piece of a smaller pie is just like, cool. You own 100% of zero at the most extreme case and it feels like that's where a lot of these things go, where if you can't think communally and build things from a value perspective on a community basis, nothing's really going to happen anyways. So I don't understand that perspective.
01:21:54.120 - 01:21:57.844, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, guys, boys, cheers. Some spicy takes we're had this week.
01:21:57.882 - 01:21:59.476, Speaker C: Enjoy the rest of we'll let you.
01:21:59.498 - 01:21:59.970, Speaker B: Get back to the top.
