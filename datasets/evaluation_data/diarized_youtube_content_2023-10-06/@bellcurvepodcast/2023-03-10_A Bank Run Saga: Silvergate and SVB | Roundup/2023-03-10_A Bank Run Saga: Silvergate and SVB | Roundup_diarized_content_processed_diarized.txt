00:00:00.090 - 00:00:25.640, Speaker A: Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co hosts today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode week.
00:00:26.730 - 00:01:02.110, Speaker B: Another roundup here Michael's. One and two vanciano fellas, welcome to Show. We were just getting into it before you got on here, so maybe we just fire right in. I mean, the big story of the week is obviously silvergate, but as we're recording here, it's also Silicon Valley Bank. So Silicon Valley Bank, their shares open down something like 40% today, so we're going to get deep in the weeds on silvergate. But I think kind of the theme of this is that it's a broader issue and not just one that's relegated to crypto. So Michael, can you explain what you were just starting to explain to me about what's going on with Silicon Valley Bank?
00:01:02.610 - 00:02:17.814, Speaker C: Yeah, so Silicon Valley Bank and is like the bank for tech startups, especially in the Bay Area, I think across also the New York area, and basically just tech startups writ large. What they provide is a more friendly experience for businesses that have maybe raised a bunch of venture capital but don't have three years of audited financials, or they don't have sort of the things that you would expect that a business opening a bank account at one of the Wells Fargo's, JP. Morgan chase et cetera. One of those banks would likely look for when evaluating bank or customer ability to be a bank customer, whatever their controls are. So they've kind of taken this approach of these businesses. Companies that are growing, that are highly charged venture capital opportunities for them have the potential of not only just putting the money that they just raised the tens of millions or millions to tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars that they just raised and putting that into our bank. But also if on the outside chance that they become the next stripe, google, Facebook, et cetera, they're going to be the banking partner that they go with because they've been with us the entire time.
00:02:17.814 - 00:03:21.914, Speaker C: And so it's sort of the buy low process of getting access to the next wave of large companies, what Silicon Valley Bank does, and there are a number of others that do this as well. But one of the things that they have also built out is a practice around services additional to just like general banking services. So they've got an entire venture debt business and they look at having venture debt offerings for a lot of their clients as well. They allow for potential for illiquid borrow. So you as a founder or an early employee at one of these businesses, can put up your equity in that business that is the banking partner to Silicon Valley Bank and actually draw a line of credit against that. They also do this for venture firms and venture firms allow some venture firms, you can go to them and actually get a borrow against your GP stake in the venture funds. And so there's just like a lot that's tied up in the tech industry, whether it be on the company side or the investment side.
00:03:21.914 - 00:04:13.654, Speaker C: And so there's a lot that looks similar, I'd say. There's also a lot that's different between Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate. Silvergate was sort of the equivalent specifically for the crypto side of the world, where it was the place that would bank the crypto companies. It was the place where you could, as a crypto client, I think they had the business of you put up your bitcoin or crypto as collateral and you could borrow against that. They also had the Silvergate Exchange Network. And so I'm not an analyst when it comes to financial institutions, but we've been digging into this for the last bit. And so what it's looking like, at least with Silvergate and the reason why they're shutting down operations is really, at this point, not having anything to do with crypto other than the fact that it seems like the crypto.
00:04:13.654 - 00:05:14.810, Speaker C: Crowd and the customer base that they had and the deposits that they had was a very fickle group where as soon as FTX blew up, you started to see massive withdrawals of cash from silvergate because everybody was afraid that the same thing was going to happen to FTX. I think a lot of the same contagion concerns were there. And so what does this mean? So when you're a bank, you put cash into the bank as a depositor. What the bank does and their general business model is they take that cash and use it productively. Now, this cash can go towards a lending operation like I was describing. Whether you're lending it out to customers who are putting up their illiquid capital or collateral up or the other use of that capital, the deposits is you can go off and buy marketable securities and there are a ton of rules around what you can buy. Historically, this is some form of fixed income product, whether it be Treasuries, whether it be mortgage backed securities.
00:05:14.810 - 00:06:18.198, Speaker C: Sometimes you can buy corporate debt. There's sort of a plethora of different options that you have as a bank. But there are also very clear rules about levels of risk and levels of liquidity at each one of these different risk thresholds. This is why ratings agencies are so important. And so as you start to see the massive withdrawals going into end of Q Four for Silvergate, you start to see them having to meet those withdrawal demands, which means that they're having to sell a lot of the fixed income that they had bought over the last few years. Now what happens with fixed income when you see rates rise in the way that we've seen over the last twelve months, it means that anything that was purchased prior to then has an inverse relationship in terms of the price that you can sell it based with the yield that the market is currently demanding. So if, when you go to zero to 5%, the price that you're able to sell those marketable securities for is priced as if that bond was yielding 5%.
00:06:18.198 - 00:06:53.600, Speaker C: So you have to sell those assets at a loss. And that's effectively what happened. And that was the reason why Silvergate had to delay their ten K. They identified losses, they did the out of normal cadence reporting that contagion led to further bank runs, further selling. That's generally what happened. I think in the case of Silvergate, what we're seeing now though with Silicon Valley Bank and this is happening in real time, and I do want to emphasize, I think there's a lot that's different here. There's still some things that are the same.
00:06:53.600 - 00:07:37.530, Speaker C: Silicon Valley Bank over 2021, their deposits went from 102,000,000,000 to 189,000,000,000. And so think about the customer base of Silicon Valley Bank. A lot of them are tech companies, startups that raised a ton of money. And in 2021 you saw a lot of that money raised from venture capital or other offerings. That where did the money go? Well, it went to the bank and they were sitting on cash. And in 2021 the bank has to do something with that cash. So what Silicon Valley Bank did, at least as far as we can tell, is that they went out and bought a lot of mortgage backed securities with a long term duration.
00:07:37.530 - 00:08:37.940, Speaker C: And when you're holding these assets on the bank balance sheet, you basically have two camps of assets. There's available for sale and then there's hold to maturity. Available for sale are assets that the bank has deemed marked to market and we could sell if we needed to hold to maturity is we're holding these to maturity. We don't have to realize a loss if the price of those assets change, but we're just going to hold them until they expire and we're going to continue to earn the yield that we were earning based off of the agreements until we hold them to maturity. And so what happened yesterday was Silicon Valley Bank announced that they had sold off 80% of their available for sale securities, which was a total of $21 billion of assets, but they sold it at a loss of $1.8 billion. And at the time of the announcement, the entire market cap of Silicon Valley Banked was around $15 to $16 billion.
00:08:37.940 - 00:09:29.234, Speaker C: Now they don't really have that much more if they've sold off 80%, but they're taking the assets that they have and they'reinvesting them into shorter duration assets that obviously will have a higher yield given that they sold off lower yielding assets and now we have higher yield. So now they're going to be able to buy higher yielding assets. And so what is now happening is now there's a concern that the bank doesn't have enough liquid capital to be able to service withdrawals or the lending business if they need to. This, I think, is a solution that is solvable. And they have announced that they're going out and working with Goldman Sachs to sell Common and Preferred in a secondary offering to the tune. I see two reports. They're either 1.75
00:09:29.234 - 00:10:14.006, Speaker C: or $2.25 billion. And if they can do that and they're successful at raising that capital in short order, they should be able to fill the gap and meet any demands for withdrawals. The bigger kind of elephant in the room is what happens with and you just had this on the chart, what happens with the hold to maturity assets? The hold to maturity assets are also long dated assets, but they can't sell them because the estimates are that if they were to sell them, they'd have to mark to market them. They'd go from hold to maturity to available for sale and mark to marketing those assets. The loss that they would incur is actually greater than the market cap of the company. And so this means that they're stuck and they're having to hold on to these assets.
00:10:14.006 - 00:11:06.974, Speaker C: And every quarter I think three to 4 billion of these hold to maturity assets are coming due and they're maturing out. So it's just going to take time. But the solution here is raise quick cash by doing a secondary offering and wait out the hold to maturity assets until they're mature and kind of shore up the bank's balance sheet. But I think the overarching point here, and I know there are senators out there that love to point that Silvergate was potentially complicit in illegal activity. I think the bigger issue, frankly, is just there were a lot of deposits at a time when there were low interest rates and a lot of withdrawals at a time when there were really high interest rates. And that really causes consternation from a bank balance sheet perspective because you're forced to sell at lower prices than when you bought. So I think it's not super complicated.
00:11:06.974 - 00:11:13.998, Speaker C: There's a lot more nuance that, frankly, I don't necessarily understand. But we'll leave it there and that's kind of the storyline.
00:11:14.174 - 00:11:25.014, Speaker D: Do we know how much cash they have to meet withdrawals or available to sell assets? I guess they have none now. But what would be the cash balance that they have to well, so they.
00:11:25.052 - 00:11:41.150, Speaker C: Sold $21 billion worth of available for sale assets. I don't know if it was 21 at their cost basis or 21 at their sell price, but there was a $1.8 billion loss incurred from that selling.
00:11:41.970 - 00:11:43.470, Speaker D: And then how many deposits?
00:11:44.370 - 00:11:47.742, Speaker C: I actually don't know that off the top of my head, guys.
00:11:47.796 - 00:12:29.510, Speaker B: Just before we go to there was actually a really great piece written about this. The guy's name is Jesse Austin Campbell, which was how banks fail. I didn't know who this person was, but apparently I think they worked at Morgan before this. And basically it's kind of a helpful understanding. And there are pictures here to kind of describe a lot of what you were saying, Michael. This is an example, if you're following along in picture form of what a bank balance sheet looks like at a super, super high, very simplified level. So one of the rules for folks who are not familiar with financial statements is when you're looking at a balance sheet, your assets equals liabilities plus equity.
00:12:29.510 - 00:13:09.580, Speaker B: So what that actually means for a bank is when you give them money, what they do is they turn around and put that into loans. They either make direct loans or they buy securities, like mortgage backed securities, which is basically securitized mortgages, or they buy US. Treasuries and that's like an asset for the bank. Their liabilities are what they owe you in terms of deposits. And then there's some small amount of buffer and basically the buffer which is the equity capital that's in a bank is supposed to cover any what he calls, uhoh but basically loans going bad. So that's, again, kind of what this is.
00:13:11.070 - 00:13:14.330, Speaker C: Loans going bad or securities that you have to sell at a loss.
00:13:14.990 - 00:13:54.406, Speaker B: It's both, right? It's the direct lending that they make. People can default, right? So they actually reserve a little bit to account for that. And then there's also securities selling at a loss. So you were getting into this, but I have a five year old brain when it comes to math. So there's just inverse relationship in between yields and the price of a bond is what I always go to. And so when you see these yields going up and up and up, it means that bond prices are going down down. So when there are deposits, which are the liabilities of the bank that basically customers get worried about and they all call in at the same time, then you need to sell your assets, which is your portfolio of liquid securities, which is what Michael was talking about before.
00:13:54.406 - 00:14:41.106, Speaker B: If yields have been going up, that means the price of your assets are going down and then something that's an unrealized loss on paper becomes very real. And that's what happened to Silvergate in the beginning when there was concentration around the types of depositors that were parking money at Silvergate, all of them, because they're all in the crypto industry, basically they were all facing the same trouble at the same time. Everyone needed their money at once. So it wouldn't have been a problem, right, if there was diversification among the depositors for silvergate. But the problem is that they were concentrated and they all had a very similar set of needs which made them pull money at the same time. Which made them realize that loss. And I think that's a similar problem with what's going on with Silvergate or Silicon Valley Bank, right? Similar set of customers, similar set of lending activities.
00:14:41.106 - 00:15:23.006, Speaker B: And I got a question for you and you alluded to this, Michael, but the broad criticism about the management at Silvergate is that they mismanage their duration, right? That's the criticism. You're supposed to within your portfolio of assets, you're supposed to have diversification across duration. So instead of just a ten year right. In terms of us. Treasuries supposed to have more short dated debt, even more long dated debt, you're supposed to have kind of a spectrum there. The question is, though, you would have to imagine a lot of these deposits came in in 2021 for Silvergate, and at that time, if you remember, Fed Funds was zero at the very front end of the curve. Actually, I'm pretty sure nominally, like the three month Treasury, I'll look this up, but I'm pretty sure it went nominally negative.
00:15:23.006 - 00:15:32.390, Speaker B: So am I missing something here? Like, there was no yield to be had in the front end of the curve. I don't know how they were supposed to take duration risk or diversify.
00:15:33.290 - 00:15:38.150, Speaker C: Yeah. So I don't know how they were supposed to be diversified and also still be profitable, essentially.
00:15:38.230 - 00:15:38.860, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:39.310 - 00:16:56.046, Speaker C: What that forced you to do is look at further dated, further duration options sorry, further duration bonds, not actual options, but go out on the yield curve to actually get some yield, which meant that your duration is a lot longer. And I think you could justify this, especially with in 2021 where you look@the.net inflows and outflows and you say, okay, let's do a distribution model and say three standard deviation, withdrawal month or quarter is going to happen. At what chance? How do we model out what liquidity we would need in that case? It's just we've been meeting these black swan level events of lack of liquidity and consternation in the crypto industry, and then when you call out a specific bank for having potentially illicit dealings with someone who looks like they're going down for fraud, of course there's going to be an actual run on the bank. And of course people are going to get concerned, just like they got concerned as soon as FTX or Voyager or Celsius blew up and they wanted to get their cash off. So I think you're able to justify this from a management perspective, saying, listen, we modeled this out. This was outside the bounds of what we had ever been able to forecast.
00:16:56.046 - 00:17:44.606, Speaker C: And so therefore we felt fine with the duration risk that we were taking. Also, it was the only option at the time. And yeah, I think that's generally kind of how I would look at it. The other thing I'd say about Silicon Valley Bank is just think about who their customer base is. Their customer base is a bunch of startups who in the last twelve months have been depleting their deposits because they have to pay operating expenses and there haven't been that many new massive swings of investment for a lot of those businesses. And so the cash deposits that went from 102 to 190 in 2021 have just been slowly dissipating out in the form of payments and withdrawals without new capital coming in. And you're also hit with the same affliction.
00:17:44.606 - 00:18:30.430, Speaker C: I think it's more slow moving. So once again they're doing a secondary right now between common and preferred. Reuters is reporting that General Atlantic has committed $500 million to the deal. I think Silicon Valley Bank will live to fight another day. The people who will probably get hurt the most are the shareholders of Silicon Valley Bank who are going to have to take on the dilution of this capital fundraise. So very different scenario from what we saw yesterday and over the last few weeks at Silvergate. But it is kind of the same root cause, which is massively increasing yields in a very short period of time after a year of massive bloat of cash deposits.
00:18:30.430 - 00:19:03.466, Speaker C: This also isn't just going on with these two banks. Wall Street Journal reported earlier today, a few hours ago, that the top four banks in the US or four of the top banks in the US. Have lost $47 billion worth of market value just today. I don't think that there's contagion, I don't think there's massive risk, but there is a question as to where does this stop? Is this going to be a risk for the entire financial sector? I think it'll just be tough for the financial sector because they're going to have to deal with this.
00:19:03.488 - 00:19:53.094, Speaker D: I think you're starting to see this pop up in a couple of places though, like the Blackstone REIT stuff when people try to know the money isn't Silicon Valley Bank. Sure they might have a more concentrated set of customers that's depleting their cash balances on hand, but this was probably the similar investment tactic deployed by most bank CIOs and they're probably all holding similar duration Treasuries that have had similar levels of losses. I don't know. Everyone's saying we need this big credit event for things to really settle down and then recover. It kind of feels like this has now played out in crypto, this has now played out in tech banking, this has now played out in commercial real estate. Maybe it's not going to be this economy wide credit bubble, but it certainly feels like this is starting to happen more frequently.
00:19:53.142 - 00:20:09.630, Speaker A: Guys, I'm trying to think about the second order impact of this. Silicon Valley Bank dominated the venture debt space. Does this freeze the market for new venture debt? And if so, does that then accelerate the cycle of startup failures because they can't access venture debt?
00:20:10.770 - 00:20:12.742, Speaker D: I would assume that market died.
00:20:12.826 - 00:20:14.290, Speaker A: Probably it's already dead.
00:20:15.590 - 00:21:00.830, Speaker D: People just aren't even capital. Call lend letters for venture firms that kind of died around that same time period for crypto, definitely, for broader tech, probably there are some gems in their Financial Times report where they are doing venture debt, they're doing fund to fund investments into managers. They're doing things that I guess a normal bank wouldn't or wouldn't have access to at the least. And so there's probably some stuff on the margin that gets a little tougher to do. But I think and I put this in our group chat on Telegram, if you want to throw that little chart up there. I think that is more indicative of what's happening to venture than anything else.
00:21:00.900 - 00:21:01.520, Speaker C: Where.
00:21:04.130 - 00:21:38.714, Speaker D: Once you put this up, you have deposits that are going down, there's less private investment, and you have cash burn that's going up. And I don't know, maybe there's a lag, but I certainly would have expected probably the deposits to have gone down, but I also would have expected the cash burn to cut in a similar proportion. But even in that Financial Times report, they're basically saying it's not getting cut in that proportion. That's not how it's actually working. People are just spending and spending and spending. That also strikes me as something that the general economy is probably going through.
00:21:38.752 - 00:21:44.366, Speaker C: As lot of there's a lot of ticking time bombs that have yet to go off.
00:21:44.468 - 00:22:14.562, Speaker D: You're Silicon Valley Bank on Tuesday, you've just seen Silvergate go under on Monday and then go into liquidation on Tuesday. You're sitting there on a bunch of bond losses on increasing customer withdrawals and picture like there's five guys in a room. What are they talking about? Do we need to do this? Yes, we need to. Okay. They're watching the stock price. They're trying to find buyers first. This is not, uh, business as usual.
00:22:14.626 - 00:22:46.334, Speaker C: For so Silvergate that we're recording on Thursday. Didn't Silvergate announce their official shutdown yesterday on yeah, I got the days wrong. So the Wednesday announcement of Silvergate I think, just happened to coincidentally fall on the day that Silicon Valley Bank was going to have to announce $1.8 billion in losses from sale of assets. Because that press release that went out on PR newswire went out at 04:00 p.m. Eastern. So it had to be teed up beforehand.
00:22:46.334 - 00:22:51.810, Speaker C: And they had to have done this already. Just happened to fall on the same day, which is just really unfortunate timing.
00:22:52.310 - 00:23:02.518, Speaker B: Super unfortunate, but also okay, so Credit Suisse, which is one of the famous banks that everyone will know if you had to take a guess, what do you think their market cap is?
00:23:02.604 - 00:23:05.106, Speaker C: It's down 90% from all time highs.
00:23:05.218 - 00:23:05.746, Speaker D: 10 billion?
00:23:05.778 - 00:23:32.666, Speaker B: 11 billion. It's 11 billion all time lows and continues to make all time lows. Here's the point that I want to hammer home, because the opposite has been kind of made popularly. It's reached the mainstream. This is not a crypto problem. This is a direct result of policy that has been enacted for the last two years. So the explicit intention of quantitative easing is driving down rates to push people out on the risk curve.
00:23:32.666 - 00:23:54.306, Speaker B: That's the explicit intention. They want people to spend money. They want investors to take risk. That is their solution for growth. So if you make interest rates zero, then you make the most conservative, most risk averse actors in the financial system. Banks take more risk. That's what they have to do, right, in order to be a solvent institution and be profitable.
00:23:54.306 - 00:24:07.002, Speaker B: So this is a result of a zero interest rate regime, more so than anything else. And Vance, you connected this to the B REIT redemptions that Blackstone is facing. You're absolutely right. It's the same exact problem.
00:24:07.056 - 00:24:14.990, Speaker D: Even credit suites, right? It's like people need their money back. The money isn't there for one reason or the other, or the things aren't liquid or they're not marked properly.
00:24:15.570 - 00:24:18.986, Speaker C: It's like Mike to just hammer.
00:24:19.098 - 00:24:30.740, Speaker D: Of course it's going to happen to less liquid asset classes first, like real estate. But I think what we're finding is that the bonds that people own are not actually that liquid. And if they are, they're sitting on pretty massive losses that they would be able to clear them at.
00:24:32.470 - 00:25:11.118, Speaker C: The zero interest rate policy yes, is definite. That's the first step in this process. But the second step is how do you take risk as a bank? There's only one way to really take risk as a bank and do it in size, which is to put on more duration. And so now you're seeing the effects of that, which is you have a mismatch of duration, and it's just going to take time. And that means that in the meantime, you're going to have to shore up the ship and get the balance sheet liquid so that if you have continued withdrawals, like I'm looking at it right now, silicon Valley Bank is not down 40%, it's down 60% today. That's a scary fact.
00:25:11.204 - 00:25:33.190, Speaker B: That's a scary fact because if you go back to that little chart that we're drawing, which is the assets, and then there's the liability plus equity. The equity is the buffer. That's the buffer, right. It's the ability to sell equity, to raise cash. That's what's going to solve the problem here. So when the market cap and the stock price is falling, we're watching the buffer get vaporized in front of our.
00:25:33.340 - 00:26:08.446, Speaker C: And also, just to be abundantly clear, I actually think that Silicon Valley Bank will be able to shore up the ship. I think Silvergate was an unfortunate, much smaller cap bank with a very concentrated set of customers as well as just not the same track record as Silicon Valley Bank. So I think that there's going to be people to step in, just as we saw Citadel and BlackRock and a number of other participants step in to Silvergate. I don't think we're necessarily there yet, but there will be people who step in for Silicon valley bank.
00:26:08.478 - 00:27:14.886, Speaker D: I love how George Soros was on the right side of the Silvergate short. Even after all those people piled in, he literally just drove it to zero. I do think it's not to go like full macro but there's a good actually he was on forward guidance with Jack Farley, this guy Michael Howell, and he wrote this book called Capital Wars and Amateur Armchair Macro, Economists, whatever. But the gist of his book is basically the Fed's job has gone from setting interest rates to managing this massive pile of high quality collateral in T bills or bonds or things like and like, of course, when you're buying all the collateral and you have a very liquid market, you don't have many losses. And when that goes away, the opposite tends to happen. And I don't know that's the only macro framework that I found be able to tie everything together, even relative to last year, where you had a terminal rate that was a lot lower, but you had crypto and stocks that are higher this year, even though the terminal rate is a lot higher and things are a lot more aggressive. It seems to me a lot of the market seems to be functioning on just pure liquidity and that's why bonds and stocks are moving in a more correlated way.
00:27:14.886 - 00:27:47.330, Speaker D: That's why PES are going up even though the economic picture is darkening. That's the only thing that I have found that can really tie things together for me, also coincidentally is calling for more liquidity and this could be the foundation of a new bull run. So that plays to my naturally bullish bias. But I do find it has been pretty consistent in just thinking through all of these things. And again, I don't know what the difference between Credit Suisse and Blackstone or Rock is, but these things all generally seem like the same problem not enough liquidity.
00:27:47.670 - 00:28:39.714, Speaker C: This is like a foregone conclusion post 2008. It's just the bigger are going to continue to get bigger, consolidate and frankly kind of surprised. So just as like context, I don't know exactly when Silvergate, the regional bank that it was prior to getting into crypto, actually got started. I think it had been around for a while but really in real capacity. 2013, okay, they got into crypto probably in the 2015 1617 era because I remember being customers of Silvergate when we were doing hash leads. Silicon Valley Bank has been around since 1994. They've been around for three decades, which means I think that they have a stronger case and they have a stronger user customer base.
00:28:39.714 - 00:29:09.930, Speaker C: They just have a lot more track record and understanding of how to navigate these different cycles. I'm also kind of surprised that with their success over the last few decades that they're not consolidated into a larger operation and maybe this is sort of one direction that they'll have to choose whether or not to go. But it does. Feel like the ones that just got started, the ones that are relatively less strong compared to the large banks or compared to the banks that have been around for know the first one to fall is silvergate.
00:29:10.270 - 00:29:29.460, Speaker D: From Tom Schmidt reporting live from Twitter. Silicon Valley bank CEO Greg Becker on Thursday told top venture capitalists to stay calm. He added the bank has ample liquidity to support our clients, with one exception. If everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge. Where have I heard this before?
00:29:30.470 - 00:29:31.118, Speaker A: Dude?
00:29:31.214 - 00:29:33.090, Speaker B: Yeah, dude, that's tough.
00:29:35.590 - 00:29:40.962, Speaker D: This is like the first of four posts that lead to them being like we're getting withdrawals on the bank.
00:29:41.026 - 00:30:00.558, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It feels pretty like you guys have portcos who bank with probably silvergate and like that's kind of the combo if you work in crypto or like silvergate and are you send? Where do you send? Like are people just like racing to open Morgan accounts right now?
00:30:00.644 - 00:30:01.950, Speaker C: Common practice.
00:30:02.290 - 00:30:13.694, Speaker D: Bunch of banks in Europe that now want our port codes business like BCB, places like Cignum. There's also a few other European banks we just haven't done diligence on yet.
00:30:13.732 - 00:31:03.940, Speaker C: The hindered operating procedure is to have three bank accounts once you get to a certain threshold of deposits and frankly separate out to make sure that you have an operating account, you have a high yield, maybe savings account where you don't need to touch the money very often. But that's generally, let's say once you raise over like five to $10 million, what we kind of advise. So it's not really that hard unless you have other intrinsic ties in business lines with one of these banks. It's not really that hard to ship your fund somewhere else if you've got two others. But yeah, it just depends on whether or not you can find that. But I do think most of our portfolio companies probably have an account with silvergate. Whether or not it's sorry, with Silicon Valley Bank, whether or not they're using it and it's their main account or only account, I think very few.
00:31:04.310 - 00:31:08.500, Speaker D: You know, they're halting the stock. It's like trading right now. They keep halting it.
00:31:09.110 - 00:31:11.650, Speaker A: Yeah. That's so wild.
00:31:12.150 - 00:31:14.820, Speaker D: That was $20 billion bank a week ago.
00:31:15.590 - 00:31:26.514, Speaker B: Look at the other stuff. Like what is the other ones? JPMorgan, bank of America. Those are both down over 5% today as of the time of this recording.
00:31:26.642 - 00:31:49.930, Speaker D: Can you imagine the size of problems that some of these bigger banks to our points earlier, these are all niche banks, but I don't know. You have the mega banks, but also what about all the ones where they're a small town bank and the factory closed or they're laying people off or there's more industries that are correlated than just like technology and crypto.
00:31:50.090 - 00:31:56.160, Speaker A: I mean also we're only into six to nine months into non zerp policy. Right?
00:31:57.410 - 00:32:08.082, Speaker D: Yeah, everyone's like, yeah, the economy is so resilient. It's like, no, bro, this has just started. Yeah, it's not like instant feedback loop.
00:32:08.226 - 00:32:08.920, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:11.530 - 00:32:55.166, Speaker B: Someone, I can't remember who this was, but provided a helpful analogy here when it came to the price of oil. So remember when oil was spiking and everyone was really worried about it? And as it turns out, the thing about oil that kills people is not the spike, but it's the area under the curve. So if you have elevated prices for a long period of time, then that's when that's a problem. And so I could think of the same analogy being true for interest rates, right? There's some amount of spike that you can kind of deal with and that's like the analogy would be look at what happened to all of these banks, right? When they bought a whole bunch of bonds at very low interest rates, interest rates went up. Their bond portfolio was underwater. But it's unrealized. It's an unrealized loss.
00:32:55.166 - 00:33:23.322, Speaker B: So it took something, a spark, which is a bank run in both of these scenarios in order for that unrealized loss to become a realized loss. Also, I'm pretty sure regulators monitor this pretty closely and carefully and I think regulators get spooked about unrealized losses. I don't know what that is. But this could be signs of stress, right, for this could be the area under the curve when it comes to interest rates. And yeah, maybe the economy was not as resilient as people thought.
00:33:23.456 - 00:34:01.962, Speaker C: You're available for sale securities. You have to mark to markets, you have to every quarter have to come out and say what are the value of those assets? Whether or not you realize them is a question. What Silicon Valley Bank did, it seems, is that they realized it to shore up the liquidity to shore up the balance sheet, also raising more capital in the form of an equity financing. Those are good facts. What now you have to figure out is what's the value of the assets and do they need to tap into the hold for maturity securities? Because we know that those are underwater, but it's just a question of how long it'll take for them to have to dig into that and hopefully they don't have to.
00:34:02.016 - 00:34:49.270, Speaker B: Could be tough. The other thing just to put the bookend on the consolidation of finance, that's also why it's possible for Janet Yellen to go out and say, hey, we want to monitor every transaction over $600. That's a lot easier for so I'm not one of those people who's like, oh, this is all some big conspiracy. But I do think it makes everyone's lives easier when there's a very small number of very large banks. And I think it's just way too early to call if this is the stress. But this has been the thing that people have been kind of waiting for on the macro side of things, people thought something was going to break when they did this super aggressive pace when it came to interest rate hikes, and everyone was kind of surprised that nothing really bad happened. But this is definitely signs of stress, and it's not localized to crypto.
00:34:49.930 - 00:34:56.060, Speaker D: This is not just a sign of stress. This is two banks blowing up in a period of, like, 24 hours.
00:34:56.750 - 00:34:57.500, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:57.950 - 00:34:59.066, Speaker A: If I told you that there was.
00:34:59.088 - 00:35:11.680, Speaker D: Going to be a $30 billion so the all time high for Silvergate is 750. It's at 110 right now. It's a $6 billion market cap stock. If I told you a $70 billion bank would go down 90% to 95%.
00:35:15.990 - 00:35:17.474, Speaker A: What do you think is going to happen?
00:35:17.672 - 00:35:22.180, Speaker D: Silicon Valley Bank, the old all time high is 750 yeah.
00:35:26.390 - 00:35:33.894, Speaker A: For SBB. What do you think happens? You think they end up raising this money? They'll be fine, but shareholders will get screwed. Yeah.
00:35:33.932 - 00:35:41.820, Speaker D: There's enough people like General Atlantic that have a vested interest in the Valley continuing to win that will back this up.
00:35:42.590 - 00:35:50.886, Speaker C: The other dynamic, too, is like General Atlantic, and it's out of the private equity firm or funds. They're not a historical distressed buyer.
00:35:51.078 - 00:35:52.666, Speaker D: Yeah. They're like a growth venture firm.
00:35:52.698 - 00:36:20.150, Speaker C: Right, exactly. They're looking at this as a discounted value. They're not looking at this as a distressed opportunity, which probably, and once again, not a banking analyst, don't really pretend to be one. This is just me reading the tea leaves in a lot of Wall Street Journal, but I think generally there will be others that step in to fill the gap. If not others like General Atlantic, there's going to be an opportunity to sell equity to maybe more distressed oriented players.
00:36:20.810 - 00:36:28.920, Speaker A: Also, they've got to be one of the biggest banks in the US. Like, top 20 in the US. Right. I think they're at that size. Top 2025.
00:36:29.870 - 00:36:31.782, Speaker D: They have hundreds of billions of deposits.
00:36:31.846 - 00:36:34.250, Speaker A: You got to imagine the government would step in.
00:36:34.400 - 00:36:54.900, Speaker D: No, the government was freaking out over silvergate had, like, what, 20 billion, 30 billion of deposits. This is a real big people are like, oh, yeah, it's the Silicon Valley. California has, like, what, twice the GDP of Canada. This is a huge bank. So I don't know.
00:36:55.270 - 00:37:10.840, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, looking at this chart, 211,000,000,211 currently last year. Yeah. So last year is do you mean 2022 or 2021?
00:37:11.370 - 00:37:15.046, Speaker A: I don't know. This is end of 2021. 221.
00:37:15.068 - 00:37:15.894, Speaker D: They're at 750.
00:37:15.932 - 00:37:23.610, Speaker A: No q four. 2022. 212,000,000,000 in assets. Yeah. 342 of total client funds.
00:37:24.110 - 00:37:27.510, Speaker C: This gets into the weeds of analysis.
00:37:27.590 - 00:37:30.940, Speaker B: I think that's yeah. There's part of me yeah.
00:37:34.510 - 00:37:35.950, Speaker D: I'm just watching it go down.
00:37:36.020 - 00:37:48.020, Speaker A: The equity ratio is two times the required amount, so they have a 15% equity ratio versus the required amount of 8%. So they could lose what does that mean? They could lose half the shareholder equity. And.
00:37:51.030 - 00:37:56.580, Speaker C: The question is, was that two to one ratio before or after today?
00:37:58.230 - 00:37:59.666, Speaker D: I'm going to guess before.
00:37:59.848 - 00:38:03.126, Speaker B: I'd guess before, too. By the way, do we think this.
00:38:03.148 - 00:38:05.320, Speaker D: Will be the last one of these.
00:38:09.210 - 00:38:35.042, Speaker B: Um, I don't know about banks. I'm just not smart enough. But what I what I do think this is my like, again, general high level knowledge is that the regulation that got passed post GFC made a lot of the more risky assets pass out of the banking system and move into kind of the broad like shadow banking system. I would guess that if there are signs of stress, it would come from there.
00:38:35.176 - 00:38:38.130, Speaker D: Yeah, shadow banks are like blackstone side.
00:38:38.280 - 00:38:38.738, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:38.824 - 00:38:58.518, Speaker B: It's basically anyone that gives leverage, extends leverage to investors, or takes more risky collateral than banks are capable of taking. It's a gigantic industry and it's kind of a broad definition, but that's where I would guess if there's problems, that's where it comes from. I know that's a funny name, but that's what it's referred to.
00:38:58.604 - 00:39:01.500, Speaker D: No, I buy that.
00:39:02.110 - 00:39:19.518, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I would guess. I don't think it comes from I mean, I wouldn't have said that this was going to happen, but I just don't know. Do you think regulators have to policymaker? Do you think that Jerome Powell is going to say something about this?
00:39:19.604 - 00:39:50.220, Speaker C: Nothing has happened yet. Literally nothing has happened yet. A bank has dropped in share price. Unless there's anything else that happens where you have withdrawal gating or liquidity issues. Listen, I read the same statement from the CEO. I don't think you can make those statements publicly if you don't feel like the liquidity is strong. I would actually say this is probably going to be one PR news cycle and they'll raise the capital and then we'll move past it.
00:39:53.630 - 00:40:07.694, Speaker D: I don't know if you see a multinational bank drop 60% in one day, I don't think that goes unexplained. Like you have to go somewhere and testify in front of somebody. That's my guess. I don't know how this works though.
00:40:07.732 - 00:40:14.286, Speaker C: I mean, whatever's going to happen is going to happen really quickly. It's going to happen in the course of the next week, maybe two.
00:40:14.468 - 00:40:36.550, Speaker D: I also think it's more of a price thing. If you see this go under 100, which would be like 65 or 70 or 80% down, then I think it's also a different story because who's holding shares of SVB Financial? Probably like retirees, older people, people looking for safe investments. Probably part of their nest egg.
00:40:38.410 - 00:40:39.160, Speaker C: Question.
00:40:40.250 - 00:41:10.980, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm not smart enough to guess how the Fed or different regulators might think about this, but I'd have to imagine they'd look at this and at least be worried. I don't know if a public speech is coming, but even though politicians might point the finger of blame in another direction, I think they're smart enough to know what really caused this and that it's probably not the last of it. I'm generally in the camp that these people are smart people and they know what they're doing. So I think they're smart enough to be pretty worried about this. I'd be worried about it.
00:41:11.350 - 00:41:20.550, Speaker D: Just tell them only one game in town. It's just like buying bonds and then you get smoked in like a once in a decade or once in a century occurrence.
00:41:21.450 - 00:41:57.310, Speaker B: So the Jerome Powell spoke this week, and I think that's probably what sparked a lot of this off. I mean, he basically reiterated higher for longer. And the FOMC that he gave at the beginning of last month surprised a lot of people. He came off as pretty dovish. And the general interpretation without rehashing that was that he was convinced or he thought that he might get his soft landing because there was still pretty strong unemployment or strong employment and retail sales and all of this stuff that might indicate that. And I think the market reacted super positively to that. That's why there was a big bump.
00:41:57.310 - 00:42:07.566, Speaker B: And now he basically walked that back. If you look at the terminal rate that spiked this week, that's at I think, 5.7 or something like that, 5.8 climbing.
00:42:07.758 - 00:42:14.454, Speaker D: It feels like people are having deja vu for when he started hiking 75 and it was like, oh shit, this is actually happening.
00:42:14.572 - 00:42:23.850, Speaker C: Well, the big thing that happened too is the chances, the market chances of a 50 basis point increase in a few weeks went from 30% to 80%.
00:42:23.920 - 00:42:41.102, Speaker D: We're looking at Cleveland inflation. Yeah, I mean, February looks kind of hot. Says like zero point 54. CPI, it's usually like 0.1 to 00:15 over it generally overestimates. It thinks CPI is too hot. So that's like zero point 54.
00:42:41.156 - 00:42:49.634, Speaker C: Here, I'll put this. Let's just be zero point 54 would imply greater than 6%. Inflation rate almost six and a half percent.
00:42:49.752 - 00:42:59.094, Speaker D: If it's 0.5, it looks bad. If it's 0.4, it looks good. I think that's like the very simple way of phrasing this. So maybe it's 0.4, maybe it's 0.5.
00:42:59.094 - 00:43:27.790, Speaker D: It kind of like depends how overestimating it is. But then March looks pretty cool. Zero point 27. My sense of people right now, and this is not macro, just like reading people's emotions is like, oh my God, it's just like before where they hiked it to 75 and they wouldn't stop. It's going to be terrible. I don't know, I don't think the inflation numbers would back that up in terms of like, oh God, they're going to like 7%.
00:43:27.940 - 00:44:34.226, Speaker C: That being said, the other data that's been coming out, and I know you've got all kinds of official metrics when it comes to employment, labor, wages. All of the official statistics look like unemployment at an all time low, job growth, wage growth seems to be in line, reasonable. But if you look at any of the private data, some of the indeed, all of the different private metrics that are obviously not used by the Fed, but usually indications, just like we've been using home prices and some of the private data markers for the inflation numbers, all of those look like we're seeing terrible data. It maybe just hasn't populated through the official data sources yet. February had the largest decrease in job opportunities and job openings based on indeed.com, since June 2020, back when everything basically halted for COVID. So February was the worst month over month change, and I can't remember the number.
00:44:34.226 - 00:45:19.570, Speaker C: I think it dropped like, 6.3% or something along those lines. I would broadly say that I think we're also going to start to see unemployment creep up, which means that we actually might have a tougher macro scenario from just an economic metrics perspective than everybody expected. Maybe these credit crunches and liquidity issues are the canary in the coal mine. Just as higher federal funds rate is intended to do that slows down economic activity, which leads to layoffs, which leads to potential recession. And at least the macro people that I follow the general consensus seems to be sometime in the summertime we'll be able to say that that was the start of a recession.
00:45:22.390 - 00:45:37.206, Speaker D: What we're seeing is obviously crypto is rebuilding. Tech feels like it's really in the middle of this gnarly layoff cycle and people aren't hiring PMS people aren't hiring from business schools. That's what tech feels like.
00:45:37.388 - 00:45:38.070, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:38.220 - 00:45:46.826, Speaker D: Curious. Yano michael, what do your friends think? Some people, I guess, think it's like a really robust economy, but most of.
00:45:46.848 - 00:46:27.320, Speaker B: Our friends want I feel like I've been talking a lot this episode, but I don't think people really know what I think. If you work in tech, like I keep referencing, I've got one friend that works at salesforce, but the way that I hear it, it's that Elliot Management, that board seat that they took, has actually worked quite a bit. And you guys were dead right about their kind of strategy for layoffs. It's not just a once and done cut. That possibility is kind of hanging over everyone's head. They're smart and they're a well managed company, so they've kind of divided things up and been like, hey, you're on the right track. Right? They've kind of put people in the good box and then the penalty box, and I think that's a pretty smart way of doing it.
00:46:27.320 - 00:46:32.230, Speaker B: But I think that adult daycare.
00:46:32.310 - 00:46:33.180, Speaker A: Time out.
00:46:34.030 - 00:46:34.986, Speaker C: Five minute time out.
00:46:35.008 - 00:46:35.610, Speaker A: Dude.
00:46:36.030 - 00:46:42.800, Speaker B: Adults are just children, too. Honestly, it's like the biggest realization of being an adult is we're all just kids.
00:46:43.490 - 00:46:47.550, Speaker A: Garrett if you're listening to this, we got to clip this with Mike saying this didn't.
00:46:51.650 - 00:46:52.062, Speaker C: Show.
00:46:52.116 - 00:46:56.826, Speaker B: They're putting microchips in the actually, I can't say that. We're going to get taken off YouTube.
00:46:56.938 - 00:46:57.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:58.290 - 00:46:59.302, Speaker B: Making the frogs.
00:46:59.386 - 00:47:05.890, Speaker A: No YouTube views from this one. Wait, Vance, what was your original question? What was your question? Do our friends think that we're in a bull market or a bear.
00:47:07.910 - 00:47:08.334, Speaker C: The?
00:47:08.392 - 00:47:11.110, Speaker D: Are the worries about inflation or growth?
00:47:11.610 - 00:47:26.362, Speaker A: Most of my friends believe that we are in hard times right now. All of my friends who either work in tech or consulting or PE or wherever it may be, no one's company is doing great right now.
00:47:26.496 - 00:47:31.398, Speaker D: Consulting is a great barometer for this too, because generally it's companies that don't.
00:47:31.414 - 00:48:00.754, Speaker A: Have okay, so consulting is interesting right now. Consulting friends at like McKinsey or BCG or whatever, when things are really good, their business thrives. When things are in the total shitter, their business thrives. But right now, everyone's on the beach. Yeah, everyone's on the beach because companies have kind of come off the rebound, but they're in this weird middle zone and it's not like all hands on deck.
00:48:00.802 - 00:48:11.740, Speaker C: Like it was 2009 and 2020, I believe, or maybe 21, were some of the best years for consulting firms just from a number of hours of work.
00:48:12.670 - 00:48:14.650, Speaker A: Mike spent a lot of time on the beach.
00:48:21.150 - 00:49:01.590, Speaker C: The other thing that I'll say, and this is a bias that probably I have just based on a ton of friends who work in private equity, number one, the ability to sell to a sponsor, dead. That market completely gone. The ability to IPO a company, dead can't do it, so there's no liquidity whatsoever. You also have a lot of these companies that just were levered to the hilt in terms of maybe Librar plus 500 basis points. And so you've literally gone from 6%. Floating, floating, floating. All of this is floating when you do a sponsored levered buyout, it's all floating.
00:49:01.590 - 00:49:27.906, Speaker C: So it goes from 6% that you have to pay every year just to service the debt to 11%. Most of these companies are going to have a really tough time just being able to debt service based off of their cash flows. And so there's going to be another shooter drop here, which is all the companies that are private, so you don't get to track them every single day or every single week that are not going to be able to make their debt service. And those are going to become issues as well.
00:49:28.008 - 00:50:02.958, Speaker B: Could I try to make a guess of what I think people like the I think this has happened broadly across a whole bunch of different sectors. Because a guy who is decently high up at this consulting firm that I know, he was like, oh yeah, we were going to do a whole bunch of layoffs, but then the year started a little bit better, and now we decided not to do layoffs. And I think broadly what happened is we ended last year, everyone was super bearish, and they were like, we're going to wait and see what happens in January, February. And then the market rallied and people were like, thank God we're out of this. I knew it, we're back. And now I think people don't it.
00:50:02.964 - 00:50:04.654, Speaker C: Was transitory all along.
00:50:04.852 - 00:50:31.350, Speaker B: It was transitory all a this is, this is anecdote so take it for what it's worth, but there's a guy, James Devolos, who told this story on the margin. He's a portfolio manager at Horizon kinetics, which is a great hedge fund. They're pretty early in crypto. He told me a story about a guy who was at a commercial real estate conference. By the way, I know that was flying around Twitter this week. This predates that.
00:50:31.420 - 00:50:35.234, Speaker C: But basically, was that the original? Because I saw about 15 different versions.
00:50:35.282 - 00:51:17.682, Speaker B: It wasn't the original. It wasn't the original, no. But what he said was this was, I think, multifamily specific, but what he said was what everyone did was they bought basically a bunch of assets that were priced at zero interest rates. Everyone was underwater. But what people did was the thing that people want is basically a one year term loan, like an extension loan. And everyone's like and he was like, well, why only one year? And the general consensus was because the Fed's going to pivot. So the other thing that happened this week is the expectations of a Fed Pivot, which was getting priced in for September this year, has gotten pushed out till mid 24.
00:51:17.682 - 00:51:41.786, Speaker B: So if you did a one year financing, you're shit out of luck. You were like, okay, I've got my solution here. I'm going to wait until the Fed pivots. Now the Fed's not going to pivot. You are in trouble. And I think that general sentiment that the Fed is going to pivot and we're out of the woods here, that was pervasive across not just finance, but a whole bunch of different things. So I think that's the zeitgeist right now, if I had to try to put my finger on it, I think.
00:51:41.808 - 00:52:14.630, Speaker D: You'Re seeing just like the fear trade come back. Yeah, there's like the fear trade and then there's like the greed trade. Those are kind of like the two. It's like people are either like longing Chinese coins that they heard about from their friend or they're trying to get into T bills. There's like, no middle ground. But if you look at this Cleveland Fed report, I don't know, doesn't really seem like inflation is going to be that big of a deal. And I think when you see all the headlines go from inflation to growth concerns, that's when you're going to know it's like, okay, it's a different type of trade is back.
00:52:14.630 - 00:52:21.030, Speaker D: But if there's like an interlude of a bunch of banks blowing up, that's going to be pretty bumpy.
00:52:21.530 - 00:52:33.120, Speaker C: Yeah, I was about to say we're also only nine days into March, so this March data, you also may bump around a bit.
00:52:34.290 - 00:52:47.566, Speaker D: One of my friends just texted me, large cap banks aren't supposed to trade like dogecoin. I did not do this. I did not cause this problem. Now everyone thinks blowing up these banks.
00:52:47.678 - 00:52:57.042, Speaker C: T minus how many days until we're talking about how crypto speculation has come over into the traditional financial market and is driving these banks down.
00:52:57.096 - 00:53:04.578, Speaker B: I know. Well, that's why we're trying to be very clear about what the root cause of the problem is here, and it's because I agree with you, Michael, that's.
00:53:04.594 - 00:53:05.460, Speaker D: What'S going to happen.
00:53:06.010 - 00:53:28.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw Mike Isaac tweeted out what was SVB's exposure to web three. Clearly trying to draw some correlation there. Mike Isaac also, please tweeted out that I was two years ago. Mike, do you remember this? He's like, Jason Yanwitz is nothing but a crypto scab or something. Do you remember that he got called.
00:53:28.356 - 00:53:35.570, Speaker C: Out by yeah, I mean, listen, it's still happening. Vance, can I tell the story of yesterday?
00:53:36.470 - 00:53:38.546, Speaker A: Yes, you can tell it. I'll approve it.
00:53:38.728 - 00:53:39.940, Speaker B: Tell the story.
00:53:43.910 - 00:53:53.880, Speaker C: Vance went to go send a payment at Chase Bank, and the banker looks at his account and says, into web three. How's that been going?
00:53:55.850 - 00:54:00.490, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll never forget my retail banker trying to ratio me. IRL.
00:54:03.550 - 00:54:09.622, Speaker B: You looked really concerned there. What did you think that story was going to be? What did you get up to yesterday?
00:54:09.766 - 00:54:10.902, Speaker A: What was yesterday?
00:54:11.046 - 00:54:14.602, Speaker D: Busy schedule, man. That's fine. You can tell that story.
00:54:14.656 - 00:54:17.402, Speaker B: Oh, we didn't even ask you about ETH denver. How was ETH. Denver?
00:54:17.466 - 00:54:38.070, Speaker A: Oh, ETH, Denver is good. It was great. I mean, there were 35,000 registrants, like 12,000 attendees. It's a massive event. Let's see, what are some takeaways? Every other panel was about ZKS. So, like, ZKS were super pervasive. Privacy stuff was like yeah, all these panels on privacy, which really reminded me of 2019.
00:54:38.070 - 00:55:01.366, Speaker A: Like, too much privacy stuff, honestly. Roll ups. There's like ZK EVM ZK roll ups. Just like ZK everything roll ups were all over the place. In terms of specific projects that were talked about a lot, like Celestia and Eigen layer. Every conversation was like Celestia and Eigen layer. In terms of other ecosystems, I mean, it's ETH denver.
00:55:01.366 - 00:55:22.642, Speaker A: So obviously, ETH. Was know everyone's building on, but, like, if I had to pick one other ecosystem that was in the narrative a little bit, I'd say Cosmos. People there either love Cosmos or they hate that. So that was interesting. No consumer stuff. No NFT stuff. Actually.
00:55:22.642 - 00:55:50.090, Speaker A: Some really good games. There's a whole gaming section there, which I know, Michael, you and Vance are much deeper into games than Mike and I are, but there were some really I don't remember the names of them, but there was a whole gaming section where you could play these games, and there were, like, tier one games. This could be an Xbox game, but they're crypto native games. So that was pretty cool because I haven't seen a crypto game in like, 18 months. And they were really good, really good gameplay.
00:55:51.790 - 00:56:53.978, Speaker C: Just to touch on to that point. The games that we're seeing are going to be interchangeable with web two, web three. It's just what happens on the back end in terms of where is the ownership sitting. The other anecdote that we're seeing with some of these games is that the retention, which then feeds into lifetime value, is three to four X. What you would see traditionally with an equivalent web two game. So the suspicion and the theory and the thesis was right, that if you imbue value into gaming ecosystems, there's going to be a lot larger desire to stick around. I think the one question is like, and this is a fair question, is it causation or correlation? Are these like, the early adopters who are coming over from free to play? Or like, web two gaming that are already high lifetime value customers and they're just like there to play and test these things out and therefore the monetization looks really positive? That's a fair criticism.
00:56:53.978 - 00:56:59.950, Speaker C: I think it's something that we're going to be testing and figuring out, but at least early signs look positive.
00:57:00.110 - 00:57:39.838, Speaker B: Guys, I really want to make sure that we've got enough time to talk about Coinbase wallets as a service. I just want to do that before A, this was, I thought, a super cool announcement. And by the way, I feel like we keep shouting them out, or at least I do, but it has been wild to watch the turnaround of Coinbase over the last year. The story going into 2022 was way too bloated. All these shipping a whole bunch of products but getting traction on none. And the story of Coinbase, at least for the last and I know that there was a roadmap, I'm sure, that lined up with this, but the last three months, it's just like hit after hit after hit and they've trimmed their team down. It seems like they've got their head on straight, a very cohesive focus.
00:57:39.838 - 00:57:55.734, Speaker B: They did the launch of Base and now wallets as a service is a massive win. I think, Yano, you know a little bit more about this than I do, but basically it's whitelisted wallets, right? So they provide the infrastructure that allows anyone to basically just say, hey, here's a wallet that we can use.
00:57:55.772 - 00:58:38.914, Speaker C: Let me just step in and maybe not counter, but at least provide some opposing opinion. And granted, Coinbase is our dominant partner from everything that we do, from custody to trading, et cetera. We have others as well, but we love to work with Coinbase. But also they have done a lot of major launches that haven't worked. I think the proof will be in the pudding. In terms of what does the uptake from Base look like, what does the update from Coinbase wallet look like? But the fact that NFT Marketplace literally went nowhere, that was a miss. I think they're going to take a shot at all the different layer two ecosystems, and that's what Base is, and they're going to take a shot at fireblocks and that's what their wallet is.
00:58:38.914 - 00:58:41.922, Speaker C: But I agree, it's really sadden to see them take real shots now.
00:58:41.976 - 00:58:42.206, Speaker B: OOH.
00:58:42.238 - 00:59:26.074, Speaker A: I don't think that's what their wallet is, actually. So, first off, I think the NFTs failed because of who they hired and because of who the team was behind. The so, like, here's the main difference when you talk to the Base team versus the NFT team. The NFT team was like, at least the people I interacted with was a bunch of web, two people who had never worked in crypto before and they hired to come build this thing. And their strategy, which I actually really understand at the time, was like, let's go hire a bunch of people from Instagram and those kind of places and they'll be able to do consumer tech really well, whatever. And that thesis definitely didn't play out. I'm really biased because I ended up spending a lot of time with the Coinbase team in Denver.
00:59:26.074 - 01:00:01.870, Speaker A: So I hung out a lot with Will, who's their VP of Engineering, and Jesse, who's leading Base. And he kind of gave me some insights into where Base is very they're thinking about it in a very crypto native way, and I think they're thinking about it in the right then and then just the last thing, Michael, to touch on the wallet as a service. I don't think wallet as a service is a competitor to Fireblocks at all, actually. I think wallet as a service is a developer toolkit, APIs and SDKs that allow anybody to go build a wallet and just basically white label a wallet.
01:00:04.210 - 01:00:48.598, Speaker C: That is definitely the case. And I think the positioning of it externally is developer focused tooling. We had a call with Coinbase yesterday and talked to them about the wallet and the different offerings. Their positioning for the institutional side of it is this will be an MPC enabled fireblocks replacement where everything will know the assets that aren't supported by prime will be able to be stored in Coinbase wallet with an NPC like solution, frankly, like we have now with Fireblocks. So I think it's actually like it's definitely positioned as a developer tool for anybody who wants to go build a wallet service into their app or into their ecosystem. But I think the business model behind the wallet will be more like a fireblocks.
01:00:48.694 - 01:01:18.750, Speaker A: Well, there's Coinbase wallet and then there's Coinbase like wallet as a service. And those are two different things. Well, it's the same technology, but two different things. So here's my mic, Mike Ibolito, because I know you were optimistic on my mic. Yeah, you were as bullish on the wallet as a service as I was. And I was trying to pick holes in this. I think if you wanted to pick a hole in this and say this maybe won't work, is because Coinbase has so many products, there are a lot of people who actually compete with Coinbase.
01:01:18.750 - 01:01:39.100, Speaker A: And do you want your entire backend, your entire tech stack on the wallet side of things, which is where you own the relationship with the customer? Do you want that to be owned by your competitor? So if you're another exchange, you would never use this. If you're someone in the NFT game, you would never use this. If you're someone who does staking, you probably wouldn't use this. So there are a lot of competitors there.
01:01:40.030 - 01:02:10.070, Speaker B: Let me lay out this is why I like all of this. Let me lay out how I think about Coinbase as a business here. I think you are going to see the unbundling of the crypto exchange. I think basically Coinbase has two different directions that they can go. They can either become Morgan big financial institution, heavily regulated, or they can take the new path. And I think you have to unbundle. There's actually very good reasons why in TradFi you don't have prime brokerage and custody and the exchange all lumped into the same thing.
01:02:10.070 - 01:03:00.382, Speaker B: Those are in different organizations for very good reason, I think. So the way that it works right now is non sustainable over a long period of time. The reason I like what Coinbase is doing is because I think what they're doing is positioning themselves as kind of a thin application layer, a very crypto native thin application layer on top of a bunch of these services. But they're making sure that they take their piece right. So the way that base as a chain and Coinbase as a wallet go together is I think the bet that they're making is right now a lot of the trading is happening on centralized exchanges over a period of time that's going to move to decentralized exchanges. And the value that's going to get extracted there is either fees from the chain base the chain or it's swaps in wallet swaps from the wallet or it's mev that gets extracted at the sequencer level. That's a fascinating business that Wall Street just doesn't understand.
01:03:00.382 - 01:03:57.270, Speaker B: I think it makes a lot of sense, the wallets as a service. The reason I think that's interesting is Michael, you said this there's still a wallet problem when it comes to crypto. I think that a potential use case that we don't all see is that a lot of really big so Michael Bodley on our team, one of our reporters, has been breaking these stories about Amazon. It seems like the initiative at Amazon for crypto is actually quite real and they're all very interested in NFTs. I think there's a really good chance that corporates that have enormous user bases and distribution might they are going to want to play in web three crypto and the first thing that they need to do is get a wallet. So I actually think that corporates might end up indirectly solving our wallet problem, get a whole bunch of people in crypto and the wallet as a service. The white labeled wallet solution from Coinbase is what's going to help them get there.
01:03:57.270 - 01:04:02.826, Speaker B: So that's why I think it's just interesting. I'm just interested to watch how it plays out.
01:04:02.848 - 01:04:55.494, Speaker C: But that's interesting. It is interesting. And so to touch on the Coinbase business model as a whole, I continue to believe that there is a broader strategy here as I think we're discussing. I also think that it's a bold move to effectively disintermediate your core business. It's not the same, but an interesting analogy might be just the fact that in 2007 when the iPhone was launched, you effectively killed the entire ipod business as well as a lot of the use cases of the personal computer business by putting it all into one device. Also, there were a lot of people who were not positive from a Wall Street and analyst perspective on Apple at the time. So I think that it's going to take time for this strategy to play out and for the data to be undeniable.
01:04:55.494 - 01:05:23.300, Speaker C: But I agree that I think it's a step in the very much right direction and then I think on the rest of it, yeah, I believe that they're going to be able to move in this direction and that there's going to be major changes. And I can't remember my last point, so we'll skip there.
01:05:24.230 - 01:05:27.346, Speaker B: Did you know a fun fact about Apple is that when it did its.
01:05:27.368 - 01:05:42.140, Speaker C: IPO sorry, there's a new action that I just saw coming in kucoin just got regulated by the Attorney General of New York.
01:05:42.510 - 01:05:47.782, Speaker A: Oh boy. Who uses kucoin?
01:05:47.926 - 01:05:55.806, Speaker C: I don't know, but part of the complaint, at least from what we're talking about internally, is that it appears to purport that ETH is a security oh yeah.
01:05:55.828 - 01:06:00.670, Speaker A: New York AG claims that ETH is a security in the Kucoin lawsuit.
01:06:01.890 - 01:06:05.460, Speaker C: Yeah, that headline distracted me.
01:06:06.070 - 01:06:09.700, Speaker A: Michael, where do you get your headlines like that one, like flow of news.
01:06:11.110 - 01:06:12.900, Speaker C: That one was sent by our.
01:06:16.870 - 01:06:17.522, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:17.656 - 01:06:24.950, Speaker C: Okay, that wouldn't be was your what was your second point after the broader coinbase?
01:06:25.930 - 01:06:55.060, Speaker B: I was just going to say one of the funny things about Apple is that when it IPOed back in, I think it was 1987 or something like that, 76 regulators were actually 76 regulators were really concerned about it and the regulators in the state of Massachusetts actually banned it from being sold to retail. Largest, I think, one of the most successful companies in the history of the world. Isn't that funny? So funny little piece of history there for you.
01:06:55.670 - 01:06:57.250, Speaker C: Thank you for the protection.
01:06:58.070 - 01:07:36.730, Speaker B: Feel protected? Extremely protected. Yeah. The other thing that happened this week that may or may not end up being significant, but I did want to flag it, is there was a judge that overruled the, I think, initial action from the SEC and actually allowed the sale of Voyager to go through to binance us. So I would keep in know the SEC is obviously on the warpath when it comes to crypto, but it doesn't actually become law or precedent or whatever it is until all this stuff gets adjudicated in courts and there's a chance that the legal system or judges or whatever won't end up going with what the SEC complaint.
01:07:36.890 - 01:08:53.538, Speaker C: So yes, also I remember my second point but we can skip it. The thing about this type of a process and why we've seen so many of these settlements is you basically have two options. When there's a regulatory complaint against you, you can go and fight it out in court, which probably will cost way more than what the settlement might be, and you have a chance of losing and then paying the settlement anyways, or you can just settle and move on. And in this specific situation, it's different because you're talking about a bankruptcy estate who's complaining against the complaint that the SEC raised, and so it just goes straight to a judge who's adjudicating the entire bankruptcy proceeding. But I think the broader point is, what does this have in relation to all the other lawsuits that are going on? And the other big thing that happened this week is there was initial proceedings in the Grayscale versus SEC complaint. And at least I've just read the secondhand opinions or secondhand perspectives of people who were there in the room. But it seems like Grayscale, there are three judges that were listening to this and it was expected that one of them would likely be on the side of Graysdale at the beginning.
01:08:53.538 - 01:09:54.038, Speaker C: And it seems like two, if not three, were more on the side of Graysdale, at least based on their line of questioning following the initial discussions during that proceeding. So, yes, this is great for Voyager customers because it means that and they've already started doing this, they've started the process of rebalancing, they've started the process of distributing to Binance US. That's great because customers will get their assets back sooner. But then the other thing that's going on too, is all the different other battles that are being fought at the SEC on all different fronts. And it doesn't seem like at least initially, the grayscale one is going in the direction that was expected. Now, this doesn't mean anything from a bitcoin spot ETF perspective, it's very possible that the rejection gets thrown out by the judges, but then that goes back to the SEC and then they just decide whether or not they're going to come up with a new reason for rejection. But it is interesting to follow how all these court proceedings are progressing.
01:09:54.134 - 01:10:03.834, Speaker B: Well, the other thing that happened this week, I don't know if you saw the Biden administration proposed a whole new slew of changes to the tax code. You might be getting a 40% capital.
01:10:03.882 - 01:11:01.982, Speaker C: Gains tax, which would be, listen, he went for it. I don't think there's a single thing that has been proposed from a new tax increase that was not included in this leaked budget plan. So I think what this is, is a recognition. And the reason why this isn't massive news right now, I mean, it's kind of news, but not like major news, is because everybody knows that there's no way that this thing ever has a chance of passing. I think it's just an initial it's an initial play in the negotiations that's going to come down in a few months for debt ceiling increases and broadly leading into the election in ten months or election year in ten months. So I think this is more of just like a shot and basically a scarecrow to be able to say, hey, this is what I stand for. But yeah, man, there would be a lot of upset people across the board if this were to become law.
01:11:02.036 - 01:11:13.662, Speaker B: I don't know too much about politics and what the game theory is and everything. It does seem like there's an enormous amount of posturing that goes on, but I agree with you. I don't think it doesn't seem like there's probably a super realistic chance of that passing.
01:11:13.806 - 01:12:05.810, Speaker C: I think the big one in there, and this is going to be probably a huge topic of your conversation starting soon, but also in ten months in election proceedings is what happens with support for Medicare and expanding increasing taxes to continue to fund Medicare. Because I think right now the trust is set to run out in 2025 or 2026. And at that point you'd have to go down to like 80% coverage, which would obviously be 80% coverage, but it also reduced some of the more less central health services that Medicare recipients are expecting. So any changes to that I think are very tough, but I think that's like the meatiest kind of toughest one in the slate of changes that is supposedly going to be proposed.
01:12:06.150 - 01:12:12.790, Speaker A: Powerful political tool weaponizing medicare. I feel like Republicans did that to Dems for a while and then now Dems are doing it to Republicans.
01:12:13.210 - 01:12:46.718, Speaker B: Those are entitlements that you cannot I think that's the if you go back to our analogy of a balance sheet, that's definitely a liability of the US government and you can print all the money that you want, but at the end of the day, a human being has to go and deliver that care that was promised to Inflate. If you keep printing money and there's more inflation than the cost, it's indexed to inflation. Sorry, that was the other thing. And so is Social Security. So you're not saving any money. That is a fixed cost that the government owes. So just worth saying for sure, man.
01:12:46.804 - 01:12:50.846, Speaker C: Yeah, a lot of fun stuff. Let's see how next week turns out.
01:12:50.948 - 01:12:52.958, Speaker B: We shall see. Yeah, we'll see.
01:12:53.044 - 01:12:58.040, Speaker A: I just got a notification that Token dumped like 60% in two minutes.
01:12:59.690 - 01:13:00.342, Speaker C: Great.
01:13:00.476 - 01:13:01.400, Speaker A: We're moving.
01:13:02.330 - 01:13:04.226, Speaker B: Excellent. Excellent.
01:13:04.338 - 01:13:05.302, Speaker A: Phenomenal. All right, guys.
01:13:05.356 - 01:13:06.482, Speaker B: Phenomenal work, fellas.
01:13:06.546 - 01:13:14.130, Speaker A: Nicely done. See you guys next weekend.
