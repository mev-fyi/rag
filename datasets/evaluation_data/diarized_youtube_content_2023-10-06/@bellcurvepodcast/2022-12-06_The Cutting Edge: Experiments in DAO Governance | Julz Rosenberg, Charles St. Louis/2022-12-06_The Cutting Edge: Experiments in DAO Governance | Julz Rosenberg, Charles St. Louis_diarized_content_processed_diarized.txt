00:00:00.090 - 00:00:30.642, Speaker A: Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. Everyone, before we jump into this episode, super excited about our newest sponsor, Reserve.
00:00:30.642 - 00:00:46.426, Speaker A: Big shout out to reserve. They are the easiest way to design, deploy and govern stablecoins, backed by a diverse set of assets with access to DeFi, yield and insurance. If you don't know Reserve, we're super excited about them here at Bell Curve. You'll hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:46.528 - 00:01:08.718, Speaker B: Community is bullshit and it is a overused meme around launching tokens. And I think the part that is very frustrating for me is that who are you even talking about when you say community? If you can't clearly define a sequel to Group within your organization, then they are not meaningful enough participants.
00:01:08.814 - 00:01:12.850, Speaker C: All right, buddy. Another episode. Another good one.
00:01:13.000 - 00:01:16.850, Speaker A: This is a great episode. Excited. All right, buddy.
00:01:17.590 - 00:01:28.150, Speaker C: Well, I'm switching from coffee to tea. I've got some matcha green tea here. I think this makes me it's not that I'm not excited, just me more balanced.
00:01:29.450 - 00:01:31.010, Speaker A: Just rip the tea solo.
00:01:31.170 - 00:01:32.230, Speaker C: I put milk in.
00:01:32.300 - 00:01:33.462, Speaker A: I put milk in.
00:01:33.596 - 00:02:07.874, Speaker C: All right, I'll drop it in the show notes how I make my tea. You can all see that. But for now, let's talk about this episode. It was a great episode with Jules and Charles St. Louis. This was all about what are some of the new and exciting innovations that are being done in Governance Land and specifically with DAOs. We wanted to do an episode so far, we sort of looked at what is the current status quo for DAOs, how does governance look like today, what are some of the big problems, what lessons should we borrow from corporate governance, et cetera? I think we wanted to dedicate an episode to what are some of the Edge case experimentation that's happening in Dao land, in Governance World.
00:02:07.874 - 00:02:19.378, Speaker C: And these two, I would say they're two of the people that are on the very frontier of that. And we got to hear a lot of the experimentation that's being done in this episode. Also, the banter, it's just flowing. Both of them can't speak good flow.
00:02:19.394 - 00:02:39.886, Speaker A: To the charles St. Louis has this really deep experience. He was at MakerDAO for a while in the early days and just working on some really interesting experiments at Element. And then Jules is like pushing the frontier, I would say, of what's possible in on chain organization. So, yeah, this is totally agree. Yeah, really like this one.
00:02:40.068 - 00:02:44.554, Speaker C: All right, for more information about how I make my tea, stick around. You'll get it at the end of the episode.
00:02:44.602 - 00:02:46.254, Speaker A: Stick around. That's why the folks are here.
00:02:46.292 - 00:02:54.098, Speaker C: Let's get into it. All right, guys, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Today Yano and I are joined by Jules and Charles St. Louis. Guys, welcome to the show.
00:02:54.184 - 00:02:55.762, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks for having us.
00:02:55.896 - 00:03:00.550, Speaker A: Thanks, Mike. An episode where you clap every time you ask a question. Is it?
00:03:00.700 - 00:03:04.118, Speaker C: I am an Italian, I speak with my hands. You know this.
00:03:04.204 - 00:03:07.350, Speaker B: We're big Clappers in Metropolis. So I approve of it.
00:03:07.500 - 00:03:19.974, Speaker C: Yeah, I love it. I'll do a clap. I'll do a bow. I've got all manner know body language that I'm willing to bust out. All right, for those of you on video, beautiful. Jules, I warned you about this before the call. I'm going to put you on the spot.
00:03:19.974 - 00:03:36.866, Speaker C: Fair warning to everyone listened. I listened to Jules describe her sort of vision for DAOs and what the important context was to understand around them a little while ago. I haven't been able to get out of my head since. So with that high bar, jules, could I just start from your 10,000 foot view on how you think about Dows in general?
00:03:37.048 - 00:03:41.822, Speaker B: I'm worried that I'm now going to undercut this grand explanation I have of Dows.
00:03:41.886 - 00:03:43.650, Speaker C: No pressure. No pressure.
00:03:45.190 - 00:05:06.202, Speaker B: It was probably me going on like a little bit of a rant in the frustrations around what a dow is. And I think in the last cycle we had like 10 million articles come out of like, what is a dow like Dao? Let's get down into it. And none of them really got to the point of it. And I think just generally we Built A Lot Of Misconceptions around Dows and on chain organizations in sort of the last Twelve to 18 months in which Dows had like a Little explosion because it was more based around the social implementations around these organizations like Holocracy, like Co Ops. And it was more attached to these social implementations rather than the technical implementations, which is essentially building on chain organizations. And so that is sort of the view I come to it now, which is these are organizations that are built on this novel concept called the blockchain, which we are all very familiar with. And at its core that means that the very makeup of these organizations is defined by their on chain structures, activity and permissions that exist on chain.
00:05:06.202 - 00:05:18.406, Speaker B: So I think there's probably a lot less Dows based on that definition that exist than what we probably think of. So that's kind of how I like to think about Dows.
00:05:18.538 - 00:05:48.054, Speaker C: So maybe let's try to flesh out some more details about what that really means. So the pretty famous theory of the firm the theory of the firm is just a nexus of contracts. So when I hear you say DAOs are an on chain organization, it's a nexus of maybe smart contracts or smart contract code. Can you kind of walk me through the ways in which an on chain organization which know smart contract executed is different from what we have today with Kosa's theory of the firm.
00:05:48.102 - 00:07:26.330, Speaker B: This is another little mini rant that I love to go on is a few months ago I listened to this wonderful podcast from Planet Money I think, and it was talking about productivity in the United States. And essentially over the last hundred years productivity has just been skyrocketing. We just become more and more productive as a workforce every year and there's a lot of obvious answers to that like industrial revolution, like computers, the internet, these are all things that make us increasingly more productive over time. But what's super interesting is that in the last ten to 20 years when technical innovation and software is at an all time high, we've actually be like our productivity levels in the United States at least, have completely plateaued. So we have lost our ability to become more and more productive and so we've kind of hit the ceiling in our ability to grow and become more effective as an organization. My sort of theory around that is that in the last ten to 20 years, what we've been innovating on is the measurement of activity in these organizations rather than the execution of actions within these organizations. So we're pushing people further away from the decision making abilities of an organization rather than bringing them closer to that meat space and as a result creating much more transaction costs because we're involving so many decision makers and so closely trying to monitor and measure the activity within these organizations.
00:07:26.330 - 00:08:18.378, Speaker B: Which isn't to say like measuring activity and KPIs and all these things isn't beneficial, but that is kind of like the direction that traditional organizations have grown in in the last, again, ten to 20 years. So I think that's where we have a really unique opportunity with Dows is that we're actually allowing ourselves to bring us closer to the execution meet space. That is what the blockchain enables is execution abilities in a trustless format. And I think that's where there's like a real opportunity with on chain organizations is that we get to rely on this new trust mechanism and create more executable formats and we are more easily to monitor and measure those things since everything is open and public.
00:08:18.464 - 00:08:28.414, Speaker C: Jules, I could keep going down this line of questioning for you. Charles, I'd love to get your thoughts here and if you agree or wildly disagree and tag you in here.
00:08:28.532 - 00:08:37.540, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in general there is a lot of pressure on the term Dow to kind of emulate or.
00:08:40.150 - 00:08:40.514, Speaker C: N.
00:08:40.552 - 00:09:20.990, Speaker D: Plus one certain organizational structures from traditional finance or tech and whatnot kind of have those different hierarchies. And a lot of people do dream of having the idealistic flat organization of a Dow. But what I'm starting to realize is that I think the working group format for Dows in general might not be the most scalable because they're kind of like Siloed. And then the channels or the communication channels between these groups is often fragmented. So when certain groups work on other things, it doesn't really work efficiently. And yeah, everything has to go on chain or be recorded somehow. But I like the idea.
00:09:20.990 - 00:10:16.890, Speaker D: I'm not sure how familiar you all are with runes from MakerDAO's endgame plan. There are parts of that that are very complicated. And yes, it can be kind of broken down. Better? But the idea that you have actual teams working in kind of competitive nature or together versus having working groups separate so having a team with a marketing person, a couple kind of protocol devs and different teams like that can actually make things push forward more faster. And I'm starting to kind of appreciate that model more as I've seen kind of working groups from ENS Gitcoin even element, for example. Bit of a tangential point from what you asked, but that is something that I've kind of noticed on a lot of people see Dows as more automated on chain transparent organizations from the past. But I think maybe we should probably define something newer and not just follow on that path.
00:10:16.890 - 00:10:29.254, Speaker D: There are things that work from the past. I'm sure we'll get into it later. But like council models with board of directors, I do see that kind of scaling decision making in DAOs. We don't want to take everything from the past and kind of emulate it.
00:10:29.292 - 00:10:49.930, Speaker A: Charles jules laid out this really nice framework for just like, what is a dao? I think at the beginning, maybe take what Jules said one step further. And what is the benefit of being a dow in your mind? Is it the transparency? Is. It like it's an organization that's built to be global from day one. What is the benefit?
00:10:50.830 - 00:11:35.658, Speaker D: The global nature is something that kind of comes with the Internet being accessible to everyone. That's awesome. It's more of a high level point, but what I really like with dows is in traditional tech and finance and operations, whatever you have the ability of founders to continue working with their company in private, make a lot of money, and have the company grow internally and so on. Or you can have an IPO. Or you can get acquired. But with the concept of dows, it now allows your founders and core team to actually pass over, or at least support control from your entire most active users and community. So it's not just like the founders and the team that built this thing.
00:11:35.658 - 00:11:42.060, Speaker D: Now everyone gets to build it together and shape how they want it. Whether the vision changes or continues, I think that's really awesome.
00:11:42.450 - 00:11:59.858, Speaker C: So I've got maybe a couple of different lines of questioning here, and maybe Jules just talking about let me ask actually, both of you, a high level question. Do DAOs have to be? Are they the appropriate form? Can you have a Dao without it being based on a crypto protocol. Maybe. Let's start from there.
00:11:59.944 - 00:12:33.680, Speaker B: I feel like, again to my earlier point on what a Dow is, I am more focused on on chain organization. So I think that is the key element of it is again, what's our trust assurance that we're operating off of and that's what defines the organizations that I'm interested in. We sometimes call them dows but I'm more focused on on chain organizations. So yes, I think that it is an essential part of it.
00:12:36.050 - 00:13:16.186, Speaker C: Let's dig in about how that on chain structure could minimize trust. Let's call them trust interactions. Right. So I'm just trying to piece that onto my own experience of trying to manage a small business basically which blockworks and some of the areas that have really surprised me. First of all, when you're joining a company, there's some element of trust that when you're going through the interview process, you have to trust that the vision that you're being painted from the people that are trying to recruit you is an accurate one. Maybe to say something that we take for granted. But this does happen sometimes you have to trust that your employer is going to pay you for the services that you actually perform.
00:13:16.186 - 00:13:51.080, Speaker C: Right? That's supposed to be like a baked in assumption but sometimes people don't end up getting paid. You have to trust that the other participants of the organization that you've been hired are capable at doing their jobs. Right. There are all these different trust assumptions and interactions that are built into getting recruited at a company. I'd love to know how that might be different because those are some of the first things that I thought about, especially around payments. One thing that has amazed me is that you can just not pay your bills and there's nothing that you can really do if it's under a certain threshold. Which shocked me and upset me deeply when I found that out.
00:13:51.080 - 00:13:59.846, Speaker C: But what are some of the other ways that an on chain organization might minimize some of those trust requirements?
00:13:59.958 - 00:15:06.318, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is something that we have talked a lot about at Metropolis. We actually wrote an interesting framework around what we call socialware and trustwear which is kind of trying to get at the meat of this and just to lay it out. The way that we think about socialware is a mechanism that creates assurances through human relationships and as a result it has like a very high social coordination cost of maintaining. Whereas Trustware is a mechanism that creates assurances through technology and as a result has a much lower social coordination cost. Basically, traditional organizations are completely reliant on socialware. There are very few instances in which they have, again offboarded some of those execution or decision rights into trustwear. So again, also just to create a parallel, you can kind of think of socialware as a lemonade stand.
00:15:06.318 - 00:15:55.290, Speaker B: Like it's $5. I'm agreeing to give you $5 and you're giving me a lemonade in exchange. I'm just assuming that we are making a benevolent contract here and we are both going to uphold our end of the agreement whereas trustworthy is more of like a vending machine. I put my $5 in and I am automatically and pretty much guaranteed to get a lemonade unless there's some technical flaw in the vending machine. And basically, as I kind of said, traditional organizations sort of over index on socialware and that is kind of like you joining a company and saying we're going to pay you. These are the values and this is the mission that we abide by. These are the sort of policies of our organization that's all just socialware.
00:15:55.290 - 00:16:47.722, Speaker B: You're just trusting those people to maintain these agreements that they've made to you or these promises they've made to you. But we've also seen a ton of problems with that and I think that's where we see a ton of problems in Dows today is people not implementing the trustwear element of it. A trustwear example is like a governor contract. That is the contract that allows you to do token voting on chain. That is a binding agreement and there's no way to really go around that. We've seen a ton of fatal examples in which that has actually worked against organizations, for example, compound themselves, having a technical vulnerability and them essentially just watching money be drained over a seven day period. That the time lock governor contract was waiting for those technical changes to be implemented.
00:16:47.722 - 00:16:58.418, Speaker B: These are trusted executable contracts which are backed by technology and code rather than us trusting on individuals as people.
00:16:58.504 - 00:17:36.720, Speaker C: Here's another something that kind of springs to mind is maybe some of you who are listening might have had the experience for getting recruited for a company of oh, you're going to oversee X, Y and Z things and you're going to have all this stuff blah blah blah. But then when you join maybe the reality doesn't match up to what you were sold and maybe you have less buy in and say so than you were otherwise promised and that would be maybe an example of socialware. Could the trustwear analog to that be? Well actually you are given some amount of tokens which guarantees you say over X, Y and Z things. Is that an example of that or is my five year old brain going?
00:17:38.050 - 00:18:50.770, Speaker B: Your question is essentially around the difference between ownership and control. Basically hearing, yeah, well I think that's kind of the unsolved problem is we've kind of created the solution for simple ownership and that with simple things, ownership and control are one to one. But as we get more sophisticated in the systems that we're creating, the relationship between who owns something and controls something is increasingly complicated. And I think the point you're sort of getting at is that governance tokens don't represent that very well or maybe you're actually making the opposite agreement or argument. I'm arguing that governance tokens do not represent control very well. Sure, they might represent ownership, but just because you have a certain stake in the company or a certain token allocation in the organization you're participating in, that doesn't really guarantee your control in the organization. But I think that's more because of the current state of Dows.
00:18:51.370 - 00:19:28.754, Speaker D: I do think there are ways to have your governance token be a denomination of voting power in your entire Dao, though. For example, we denominate everything in Whey in certain areas in Ethereum or USD, in the States or CAD if you have a certain kind of denomination of voting weight in a system, I think a governance token is really great for that. The only way to kind of split it up is using different voting techniques to have multipliers on that for different audiences, different people, different working groups and all of that. I think that would be a really cool use to see move forward with governance tokens. But yeah, I agree with you. There are a lot of problems with it now based on what you said.
00:19:28.952 - 00:19:40.360, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think it's just like fundamentally these systems weren't intended for this. Governance tokens are just regulatory arbitrage. They are saving everyone's ass.
00:19:41.050 - 00:19:43.622, Speaker A: Someone said it on the podcast. I've been waiting for that one.
00:19:43.676 - 00:19:44.440, Speaker C: All right.
00:19:46.730 - 00:19:48.450, Speaker A: Only took five episodes.
00:19:48.610 - 00:20:01.658, Speaker C: Yeah, Jason and I, so we were talking about this before we got on here, and we were like, what's your big takeaway? Like, we've done four episodes in this series so far. He's like, it's regulatory right now at.
00:20:01.664 - 00:20:16.900, Speaker B: The current I feel like hasu said that, though he might have not said it directly, but he was talking around it. A big part of Dows is regulatory arbitrage. And I think sorry. You go, Yana. You had a.
00:20:20.470 - 00:20:47.770, Speaker A: Happy that I'm just happy that you brought that up. But I did have another question for you, Jules, on the social wear versus trustwear thing. Okay, I read the piece. I think it was a couple of months ago that you guys put it out, maybe over the summer or something. I'm trying to remember. So little foggy, but I like the way that you laid out. Where my mind goes, though, is the reason that startups specifically and companies do socialware instead of trustwear is because it's really easy.
00:20:47.770 - 00:21:23.618, Speaker A: Like, socialware is super flexible. It's really easy to implement. Let's say when blockworks was starting, we didn't have a bunch of engineers. So sure, trustwear sounds great, but A, we didn't have engineers who could go implement this, and B, what blockworks looked like in Q one of 2018 was like a world of difference from Blockworks in Q two of 2018, which was different than Blockworks the next month even. So, if we had implemented trustwear in 2018, well, blockworks in 2019 would have been like a disaster. So I'm just curious how you think about that shift from socialware to trustwear?
00:21:23.794 - 00:22:09.554, Speaker B: That's a really good question. And you're completely right. Trustwear is expensive. It's way easier to be a lemonade stand instead of building an entire vending machine that is expensive. It's complicated, there's risks involved, all those things. So we've also internally debated the transition from social wear to trustwear. But I think a lot of what we sort of landed on when we were writing that framework is that you need to have basically governance market fit or social market fit around the socialware before you can implement the trustwear.
00:22:09.554 - 00:23:17.446, Speaker B: Because I think a huge problem that we saw even in Dows today is that they too quickly jump the gun on the trustwear and then it didn't match the social systems of their organization. So Token governance is a perfect example of that to make sure that they were credibly decentralized, especially in regards to regulation, people launch a governance or sorry, people launch a Governor Bravo contract for token weighted voting and then no one shows up to vote. And it's like, what's happening here? Why is no one voting? But again, there were never social systems around a plutocratic system. Like there was a core team that was running the show behind the scenes and then decided to invite a community into the process of it at an arbitrary date. And now we're expecting everyone to catch up with the social system of plutocratic voting.
00:23:17.638 - 00:23:18.186, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:18.288 - 00:23:25.178, Speaker A: Charles, how do you think about Adelemon and Charles before this? You were a maker, if I'm remembering.
00:23:25.274 - 00:23:36.740, Speaker D: Yeah, I was the decentralized governance architect there and before that was just a technical engineering consultant helping with so pretty.
00:23:37.350 - 00:23:54.600, Speaker A: Relevant, I would say, to this. On the maker side of things, how do you think about when almost what Jules is saying here, when do you implement this? When do you implement the social contracts to become real technical contracts or move from social work?
00:23:55.130 - 00:24:36.374, Speaker D: Maker is an interesting case because the Token existed before the actual protocol. So you can't really retroactively shift around supply. I mean, yeah, there's mint and burn functionalities in the system to increase decrease supply, to increase voting weight. But with Maker, I mean, they had a governance contract. It was the first on chain voting system in Ethereum and they introduced this over a long period. There's like a voting portal. I think earlier, in the earlier days, they just had kind of team speak calls every Sunday where people would talk and give updates on building.
00:24:36.374 - 00:25:31.094, Speaker D: And then after a couple of mean, after MCD launched, they then decided to create a proposal framework much like VIPs EIPS, inspired by Python's enhancement proposals, PEPs. And that's when the actual process that had been kind of occurring with just token voting was formalized into stages and proposal frameworks and who's involved in different people. That's what I worked on. And looking back, I think still working today, the only thing that I would probably change is introduce less process up front because this thing was extremely thorough, robust, like stages for everything, different stakeholders. It was almost too much to handle right away. And I think that is one of the kind of things that Dao should learn from makers in that early stage of launching a Dow. You need to be open, you need to be lean like a startup where you can work together in a small group with very little process and get stuff done.
00:25:31.094 - 00:26:01.022, Speaker D: And I think a lot of dows too early set, too early social frameworks with processes especially for asset onboarding. That stuff bogs down so many protocols and then once you've learned that got the training wheel shaken off, you can then put a process in place that reflects the most optimal and efficient in many cases, you don't even need processes for asset onboarding because it's like a permissionless deployment. But yeah, my recommendation and lesson from that is that too much social process early on actually slows down.
00:26:01.076 - 00:27:00.062, Speaker B: And I think that's such a good point charles too, because I think everyone knows bureaucracy is the killer across any type of organization and too much process equals bureaucracy. And I think it's kind of an interesting pattern we've gone into Dows is that we over index on the upfront processes and we don't pay enough attention to the more consequential actions. What drawback measures do we have? And it's kind of like optimistic governance. Why are we not assuming people are acting benevolently and then have drawback powers in case they make a bad decision or there's veto actions? And instead we've done the reverse of like let's put all of this bureaucracy and rules up front and then make people go through these really lengthy processes in order to make a decision.
00:27:00.206 - 00:27:43.150, Speaker D: I think in part it's definitely due to laziness and not as much of a prioritization on governance being important, when in reality governance is the backbone of your protocol. Once you've launched it, it's what's going to make or break your protocol in the future, whether you like it or not. And I think too many projects, especially like DeFi summer when things were just like cranking up, they just forked, like whatever. They used snapshot, multisig and they put very little tension to it and they just expected people to do these things. They didn't think about the actual use case of governance in their system, they just took the quick route, lazy route and pushed it forward. They said they develop it over time, but in many cases they just kind of left it and never innovated. Which is why governance innovation has been lacking until kind of this year.
00:27:43.220 - 00:27:53.138, Speaker A: Charles, can you talk about just the governance element and how you've taken everything that you've learned at Maker and what you set up there and you've implemented some really cool stuff. So can you just expand on that? Yeah, for sure.
00:27:53.144 - 00:28:21.854, Speaker D: I love talking about it. I might talk a bit too much, so cut me off. Yeah. So learned a lot from Maker. I mean, obviously the system is still working today, there's definitely a lot of improvements to be made, but it's still robust and working in many ways. But the main things we wanted to do kind of with Element is to first of like make governance way more inclusive. So, as Jules was saying earlier, the one token, one vote is just not an inclusive thing.
00:28:21.854 - 00:29:19.146, Speaker D: It's like plutocratic, it just doesn't really scale either. So we introduced this concept called voting vaults which essentially allow you to assign voting power to any use case. And that's very vague. So a couple of examples would be if you have a governance token and as opposed to in Maker where you just stake your MKR in the voting contract and all you can do is vote, there's a huge opportunity cost there, there's a lot of capital inefficiency. So what you could do now with the voting vault is have essentially an LP vault where your governance tokens in an LP position and you can still delegate or vote in the system or like borrow in Maker Compound or Aave and still be able to do that. But the coolest part is you're actually allowed to use a voting vault to do things like NFT ownership and it's all based on a denomination of voting power of that governance token, like I mentioned earlier. So for example, for all the core team in Element with the core team, investors, advisors, they're in a vesting vault with a lower multiplier.
00:29:19.146 - 00:29:56.170, Speaker D: I think it's like almost more than half. So for everyone in the system who has one L five governance token, all the voting power of those core team members is half of that. But the ones that I really want to see unfold is like an L one, l two synthesis. So you can vote on L two, like Gaslessly and then a post L one. The last one is like an identity verified vault. So you can assign voting power to your GitHub contributors, your discord members, your people who run like governance calls and give them voting power on the system. The more voting vaults you have in the system, the more equal your whole ecosystem is weighted in terms of voting power.
00:29:56.170 - 00:30:33.554, Speaker D: So it's not just like the token holders who can buy on the open market having a say, it's like kind of balanced through everything. That's my favorite part of the system. The other part that we kind of mentioned earlier is the Governance Steering Council, which is kind of inspired by board of directors and traditional companies. And the idea there is that we didn't do it on an election style because it's really hard to offboard people once you've kind of elected them through an election model. You'd have to put up a proposal emergency offboard them, which would take weeks and whatnot. So we did a delegation. Threshold.
00:30:33.554 - 00:31:08.530, Speaker D: So if someone meets the delegation threshold, they can opt in to be a GFC member. And what that comes with is authority. Because in a lot of Dows, a lot of teams who are voted in paid by the protocol don't actually have authority or the area of expertise to get shit done. They basically just kind of go through the regular process. Everyone has to and that's really inefficient. So the GFC members can spend part of the treasury up to a certain limit, they can put proposals directly on chain instead of the whole process and they can be assigned many other powers as they kind of gain respect in the community. And we have in element right now I think we have nine GSE members.
00:31:08.530 - 00:31:50.080, Speaker D: They push forward a bunch of proposals, they've done some asset diversification and things like that. But the cool thing here is that the GSC contract is actually a voting vault which assigns a certain amount of voting power to them and makes it cyber resistant. So everyone in the GSC only has one vote. It's not like their delegation vote kind of outweighs the other GSC members. They each have one vote and a certain threshold for them to pass things. So that model can be used for other councils as well. If you want to have people have expertise over protocol engineering and push fixes up in emergency situations, you could have a council for technical experts where they're there, something bad happens, they can push things something right away and fix it.
00:31:50.080 - 00:31:56.114, Speaker D: So that's kind of where we're at. Those are my two favorite parts. I can keep going, but I'll probably pause here.
00:31:56.312 - 00:32:05.860, Speaker A: No, it's really interesting when you think about the system that you set up, what is the main thing that you're trying to solve for with this system?
00:32:06.550 - 00:32:45.138, Speaker D: I think there's a few things. I mean, one is liquid democracy just doesn't scale. Why does everyone have to have a say in something? It doesn't even work in the real world. It just results in poor decisions often. So why can't we have that more representative democracy model where you're trusting these people to make decisions, scale things faster and so on. So one is like scaling decisions in Dows, I think scalability, excluding the concept of scalability from blockchains in Dows it's like scaling the amount of decisions that can happen per period of time in a Dow. So that is the number one thing we're scaling for.
00:32:45.138 - 00:33:36.690, Speaker D: Two is the problem I meant with inclusivity and plutocracy in the blockchain world is actually making your Dows like people in your Dows be able to vote no matter what position they're in. And the third is kind of more on the funding model, which I didn't really get into around optimistic grants. So play on the optimistic roll ups, but also governance where you assume the best in a grantee because every grant system I've ever encountered assumes that the grantee is going to fail. And the way the compensation is kind of set that way and also their milestones. So this way, if no one calls this function that they're not getting their stuff done, the funds are basically given to the grantee. If not, you have the ability to claw it back through governance. But I think that model hasn't really been tested yet, but I'm really excited to see that happen.
00:33:36.840 - 00:33:42.050, Speaker C: How would you rank the success thus far of the Element Governance experiment?
00:33:43.030 - 00:34:35.390, Speaker D: I think it hasn't been enough time to really gauge all these different things. Like, the GST has nine people, which is awesome. I mean, they're actually putting votes forward, there's working groups, but I don't think it's been through a tough situation yet, and I think it definitely needs to do that before I can answer that question. The one thing that I really like about the model is it is built for experimentation. So the Governance system has one core voting contract, core system, and everything else is a module on top of that. So, like, the GSC, like a time lock, a treasury, like a spender contract, voting vaults, they're all kind of like tools in your tool belt that you can kind of plug into this core voting contract. So if the GSC ends up not scaling the like, you can basically just cut ties with that and go back to normal delegation.
00:34:35.390 - 00:35:04.698, Speaker D: Or if you don't want a time lock, I don't know why you would, but you can remove that. And the whole system is kind of just built. So it's a modular aspect that can be kind of shaped to whatever dow or use case that you want, whether it's like a certain type of governance model of democracy, representative democracy, whatever you choose, and remove that. But for now, the GSC is working. But who knows, if it doesn't end up scaling, we might just kind of deprecate it and go back to delegation.
00:35:04.794 - 00:35:06.320, Speaker C: There was a tweet from.
00:35:10.770 - 00:35:13.120, Speaker A: Me. Why you tell me why you say that, though?
00:35:15.270 - 00:35:52.234, Speaker B: I think it's just so sad. I have so much respect for the Element team and what Charles has done in just continually creating experiments and trying to create new knits rather than just defaulting to what we already see in front of us. And so that's why I say that even if it does fail, which, I mean, who knows? I think it's been really successful so far. I think that just further proves another avenue for people to explore rather than continuously falling back on what we know are extremely broken methods, such as the traditional delegation model that we have.
00:35:52.352 - 00:36:00.826, Speaker C: All right, everyone, brief break in the show here to talk about our newest sponsor, Reserve. So it's looking pretty bleak out there. It's not looking that great. We know that the one thing there's.
00:36:00.858 - 00:36:03.466, Speaker A: No bear market in stablecoins stables.
00:36:03.498 - 00:36:40.186, Speaker C: Baby stables. We love those stablecoins, which is why we're excited to partner with reserve protocol. So let's just start with the basics. What is reserve? It's a self service platform to build, deploy, and govern asset backed stablecoins, which can be integrated with DFI or within the real economy. So the cool thing about reserve is basically anyone out there permissionlessly can take any set of ERC, 20 tokens and use them to collateralize their own stablecoin. So the long term goal of the reserve protocol is to create a noninflationary currency that is stable on a month to month basis, but also a century to century basis. In the meantime, though, they're open sourcing design decisions for stable coins, which is just super, super cool.
00:36:40.186 - 00:36:51.178, Speaker C: I think one of the benefits that you get there is diversification. You hear it all the time in Finance 101. No such thing as a free lunch except for diversification. That's what you're getting with reserve protocol.
00:36:51.274 - 00:37:01.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I've known the team for a long time. I spoke on a panel at SF Blockchain Week with Nevin? With Joe Carlson and Alex Gladstein. Really impressive growth that they've been able to have so far.
00:37:01.352 - 00:37:01.506, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:01.528 - 00:37:29.082, Speaker A: Their premier stablecoin is RSV. It is backed by three other stables. It's already used by over half a million people, transacting over $300 million a month. Right now, like Mike was talking about, anyone can go create a custom bespoke stablecoin using the reserve protocol. You can back it by maybe specific USD stables, or you can get creative and maybe build something more complex, like inversely correlated assets. The branding, governance, and composition are completely up to you.
00:37:29.136 - 00:37:57.730, Speaker C: And lastly, if there are any builders who are listening and you aren't interested in issuing your own coin, what you can do is you can stake reserve's governance token against your favorite stable strategies. So what you're doing there is you're providing backstop insurance to stablecoin holders. Not riskless, right? Not financial advice. There's definitely some risk in doing that, but it does allow you to earn yield, especially now in crypto when there are so few ways to do that. It's definitely worth checking out. So at the very least, you should click the link at the bottom of this episode. Go check out the reserve website, see all the cool stuff they're up to.
00:37:57.730 - 00:38:04.822, Speaker C: Most importantly, though, click this link. Got to give Jason and me some credit here. Give us some love, baby. Give us some love. All right, now back to the show.
00:38:04.876 - 00:38:47.702, Speaker A: Let's get into it. Do you guys think that remember, after DeFi, summer is like, every single startup raising was raising as a was. Everyone was raising as a Dao. And then if you look at the startups that raised in the last several months, really, like, no Dows. I would say everyone was kind of like, maybe the Dow model doesn't make sense. Maybe it's like you start as a centralized company and then you figure out the Dow thing later. I'm curious, when you look at the next cycle, maybe how will folks raise as a Dow? When will people pivot to become a Dow? Or maybe, Jules, you'd be happier if I said on chain organization basically how will this look?
00:38:47.756 - 00:39:34.174, Speaker D: If you look at the facts of all these teams raising that way, you'll probably see more teams that are actually just like research and development studios, for lack of better terms, that are building really cool stuff like they're building protocols, whether it's like DeFi infrastructure and so on. And they're releasing these things into the wild and Adao will help govern those individual projects. I think we'd probably see more teams that are just like engineering powerhouses that are very kind of good at building things and then after that, once it's kind of been released, they'll be core contributors but it's up to governance to allow them to keep contributing. I think that would actually help the idea of Dows grow as well versus raising as a Dow and remaining like a core team as a Dao forever.
00:39:34.302 - 00:39:49.980, Speaker B: I also just think that we potentially just over index on this north star of the Dao. I still think that there are a lot of really valuable things that.
00:39:51.870 - 00:39:52.234, Speaker C: For.
00:39:52.272 - 00:41:16.274, Speaker B: Example, my team is working on that can help just like any organization that is interacting with crypto in some way. And I think obviously I really believe in on chain organizations and Dows because I think we have the potential to build very similar patterns like we see in the traditional world with legal patterns and these are very common tools that are used by traditional organizations but we don't really have that for crypto native organizations. But we have a very unique opportunity because we're building it on this new trust mechanism which is the blockchain. And even though I made a whole fuss of this earlier, I do believe that what Tokens did for ownership, dows will do for enabling new and different types of control. But I think there's been a huge bearishness around Dows recently because a lot of them have failed. There's been so many problems and a lot of the protections that we see in the traditional world don't exist on chain or on Dows. Like, for example, fiduciary duty is like a concept that whoever controls this thing must control it in a way that benefits the owners of that thing.
00:41:16.274 - 00:42:15.446, Speaker B: It's very abstract and it creates a mechanism for us to bridge that separation between ownership and control. But you can't really codify fiduciary duty on chain and this has been a theme in MakerDAO is know Andreessen stepping in and saying, like, okay, who's actually running this? Like, who is looking out for our interest? And I think a big part of this is just we need new primitives to sort of bridge that gap. And I think that's just like where we have a lot of work to do, such as what Charles has worked on with the element team and a big part of what we're working on at Metropolis too. So I think it's just like we need these new mechanisms and primitives to be able to start to bridge the gap between ownership and control and some of the responsibilities there.
00:42:15.548 - 00:42:54.100, Speaker C: Look, the theme, to be honest, a little bit of this season is that we've been struggling to get people to say super positive. This is a very positive conversation. It's easier to point out the stuff that isn't working at this particular moment in time than what is working and what we're starting to get at. Chow Wang had a great tweet where a lot of crypto's detractors. It's very easy to point out the 99 things that crypto doesn't do as well, but they don't focus on the one thing that it does better than anyone else. And that would be very difficult to replicate on the example that he used was mobile, like mobile tech. It's smaller, you don't have as much control over the screen, but it ended up winning because convenience, it did that better than anyone else.
00:42:54.100 - 00:43:55.042, Speaker C: And so that's what I'd like to I think what Hasu meant was kind of this idea that especially at the early stage of an organization, you want the people that are making decisions to be the most competent and incentivized people. But the way governance is being implemented today is this one token, one vote. Let's distribute the tokens as far and wide as possible and it's a hindrance on decision making. So if you're just optimizing for what's good decision making right now, you would want to limit the surface area of your governance, say, hey, I know we want this, and we kind of need this for regulatory purposes, but we don't want it actually be able to touch a lot of core parts of what we're doing with this protocol. Because if we have to submit everything to a vote, we're never going to get anything done. So I don't want to totally speak for Hasu, but I think that's what he meant when he said so I'd love to maybe just respond to that whole soliloquy.
00:43:55.106 - 00:44:46.210, Speaker B: I also think what's in the background there is hasu is also speaking from his experience with Maker that has been extremely frustrating in the last year or so. And he's been very vocal in saying, who is defining our strategy for Maker? It's kind of like this untamed beast right now, which he's been very vocal about. So I think that he's also very much speaking from, like it actually has been a huge risk to Maker because I think Maker's governance expanded so robustly that it became, to Charles's earlier point, like, a little bureaucratic and overly robust. And they might have kind of, like, foot gunned themselves, as in, like, they shot themselves in the foot and bottled their own footgun capabilities. Such a way of saying that favorite term.
00:44:46.290 - 00:44:47.720, Speaker A: I'm definitely taking that.
00:44:51.850 - 00:45:50.970, Speaker D: Think the I'll speak to what Hasu said about Liabilities after this. But with Maker, for example, I think it's just this huge debate between scaling the efficiency of the like through the model that Heesu and a few others tried to propose, which it was like basically a board of directors council. And so the group of people in the ecosystem that want to scale the Dow, make decisions, have a vision and push it forward like an organization. And then the people who are kind of true to OGS of crypto like Ethos, flat organizations, very complete autonomy and all that. And the governance system in terms of voting weight is split between those two. So every decision is kind of like 50 50 almost or marginally close on each side. So that's why it's really tough to get any kind of vision or kind of more scalable processes in place because the 50% on the other side disagree with it.
00:45:50.970 - 00:46:45.950, Speaker D: And that's definitely where his frustration comes. In terms of the liability side, I think that right now we have the training wheels on for all our governance systems. We're doing a lot of things very manually and that's really important. It's not a liability, but it sucks and it causes voter apathy, voter fatigue, even like people just leaving the ecosystems. But it's really crucial to kind of have those people be here now, train and maybe some of them leave, but the ones that stick around are going to be there to understand everything. And once the whole governance system understands these things, you can then automate as much as possible, which is the goal of Maker and always has been, is to automate as much of governance as you can, but still have the ability for humans at the end of the day to step in in emergency situations. So they've done things like this with the automated Debt ceiling module where a certain threshold is hit, it increases the debt ceiling and anyone in the community can sign a message.
00:46:45.950 - 00:46:59.902, Speaker D: It doesn't require a vote. So I think governance needs to be automated as much as possible, but you do need to have that dedicated aspect for humans to step in. When it's like once we get to that level, I think people are going to complain a lot less about governance as a liability.
00:46:59.966 - 00:47:41.440, Speaker A: There's this guy, I think his name is like Georgie Agarov. I think he does managerial economics and decision making at Northwestern. He wrote this paper that basically he laid out the argument that who is in power matters much more than what system of government you have. And there's this thought that democracy should perform much better because politicians are accountable, right? And in dictatorships, politicians are not accountable to anyone. So they should hypothetically perform worse. But this is not actually how the world works. And when you actually look at countries that perform really well, it's much more about who's in charge, less so about the system of government.
00:47:41.440 - 00:48:06.886, Speaker A: That theory ends up breaking down, actually that's only in good markets. Basically when things really like shit hits the fan, that's when dictatorships usually turn bad is what this paper argues. But anyways, do you think that Dow should look more to have? Should they look at this paper as an example and say like, okay, we do need some leaders internally more?
00:48:07.068 - 00:48:11.690, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Oh, Charles. Go ahead. You disagree?
00:48:13.230 - 00:48:15.340, Speaker A: Hell no. Jewel's like, hell yeah.
00:48:17.390 - 00:48:56.838, Speaker D: I don't think decentralized means that it's like flat or spread across too much. There can be leaders that emerge. I mean, that's like how natural kind of selection works anyways. Leaders emerge and kind of show up when they need to be. I think we almost focus too much on the some Dows just focus way too much on one of the three letters. It's really obvious when a Dow focuses way too much on the organization, making it like a traditional organization. And when some are like, for example, Rye, they focus way too much on the autonomous part where everything's automated and it causes problems and you can't make a whole lot of changes and things like that.
00:48:56.838 - 00:49:34.674, Speaker D: So I think, like I said earlier, with decentralization it is a spectrum. So, I mean, when you first launch, maybe it's not going to be as decentralized as you want, but it allows you to actually get the structures in place, make the right decisions for a base foundation layer, and then kind of spread it as you go. I think decentralized is more the idea that anyone can join if they want to. Not like an initial voting distribution. It's like this is a decentralized workforce where people can come in and if they're accepted, they can join. It's like permissionless to join versus the other definition. Yeah.
00:49:34.674 - 00:49:35.674, Speaker D: What do you think, Jules?
00:49:35.742 - 00:50:32.214, Speaker B: I don't actually think it's about making it open to everyone. I think that's how we've probably ended up in a bad situation. And I think that's a whole other tangent. But to workforces in dazz But Yana, to your point around over focusing on decentralization, I think a lot of this too comes back to who actually needs to decentralize because decentralization is still very important in a lot of cases. You decentralize because it makes things durable, robust and uncapturable, which is very important in a lot of cases. And I think even though I know Vitalik's articles are like sometimes just kind of a mindfuck and overly dense and complicated, his concave and convex article was.
00:50:32.252 - 00:50:34.870, Speaker C: I thought that was great. That was a light bulb.
00:50:35.450 - 00:51:06.818, Speaker B: It was really good because he talked about first order organizations and basically organizations that need to decentralize. It's not like a cute, fun option where we're like, let's do this decentralization thing. It's like a must have. And the three reasons he gave for why you must decentralize are censorship, resistance. So it cannot be captured by a single actor, like a corrupt actor. It can't be captured by a government like regulation, et cetera, et cetera. These are super, super important.
00:51:06.818 - 00:52:03.982, Speaker B: Like in the case of maker, there's also credible fairness which is making sure you have a diverse ecosystem of many stakeholders and that there's a robust governance. There's provable robustness in that ecosystem that can be ethereum or ENS. These are ecosystems that are providing a very important public good and if that infrastructure becomes compromised, that's massively problematic to the value that they're providing and creating. And then the third reason he gave was the concave decision making, which is kind of complicated. And also I think yeah, it's not as clear where the lines are there and I think a lot of people try to bucket themselves into the concave decision making, which is essentially like the middle area of decision making. There are better outcomes when more people are participating. It rather or like the middle ground of decisions rather than the extremes, which is like iffy territory.
00:52:03.982 - 00:52:12.710, Speaker B: But I think the first two are like there are very clear requirements around that of who needs to decentralize in those cases.
00:52:13.370 - 00:53:06.360, Speaker C: One thought to share and then a question that I want to put back to you, Jules or Charles or you too. But I think the convex concave decision making when I was listening to him describe that, I actually think that has to do more with the maturity of an organization and kind of like expected value bets because in the beginning there are a couple of big decisions that you want to be convex. It's like you sort of at a really early stage of a startup. I don't want to say you bet the farm, but you kind of bet the farm. And the reason why that makes sense is because if the decision fails or you make the wrong decision, you end up failing. But if you make the right decision and you pivot your business model or hire the right person or whatever it is, there's like 100 times upfold. And then as you get older and older in an organization, you don't want to be making as many convex decisions because you're never going to get that.
00:53:06.360 - 00:53:47.538, Speaker C: Apple's never get 100 x from where it is today. Right? So all the decisions that Apple makes at a certain point because of its upside potential look more concave, I would venture. But the question that I want to turn back to you is do you think that in terms of censorship resistant, what makes sense to be a Dow is actually a societal decision. And the example that I'll give to you is like power companies. We talked about power companies and utilities. If you just let power companies, those are natural monopolies. If we didn't decide that everyone should have access to power, those companies could have infinite return on their capital because everyone's going to pay for that.
00:53:47.538 - 00:54:21.342, Speaker C: It's completely inelastic demand, right. If we just let that roam free. But as a society we've said we don't think it's right that these companies should just be able to choose essentially the market rate or price it at essentially the market rate. So we're going to regulate it because we think it's a societal good to provide cheap power to people. Almost the opposite is true in terms of financial infrastructure. I could sit here all day and Eric Voorhees does this more eloquently than I could do it, but he'll go and say this is why it's a public good. It's a right, it's a fundamental human right, why we should have neutral financial infrastructure on a societal level.
00:54:21.342 - 00:54:42.434, Speaker C: Clearly Washington does not believe that. They just don't believe know, we could kind of sit here and be like, this is where it makes sense. But how much do you think that what ultimately ends up becoming infrastructure? What ultimately derives value from being decentralized or censorship? Resistance is less a technical thing but more of a societal choice.
00:54:42.562 - 00:55:38.810, Speaker D: Ultimate adoption of crypto and DeFi will ultimately be like a social thing and I think that will creep its way into the hierarchies of social governments, politicians and so on. And I think the underlying thing that would probably push us through is that it's like permissionless, access to financial support and tools that is currently at a price point for a lot of people getting boxed out. So I think, I mean, the solution there to actually make that a real thing is that this is an open finance system, is a social solution. They don't think the technology will always be there. And I do think that in this industry we do focus way too much on having a technical solution to absolutely every problem when in reality a lot of it is just solving problems for humans. So I do think that society is definitely like the focal point for anything that you just mentioned.
00:55:38.880 - 00:56:52.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like a lot of it is also just trust. Something I always come back to is that a huge part of DeFi is that we no longer have to trust these centralized institutions that have traditionally failed us quite massively in the past. And I think that is where there's a societal change or difference is like the trust element of it. And I think that's kind of like the direction that we're heading in too is we have seen bad actor after bad actor continue to create problems because they're obfuscating information. And creating these black boxes like FTS is a perfect example of like trusted socially by many in the ecosystem. But they basically were able to create these complex webs of legal entities and personnel that were involved in this that completely obfuscated what was actually happening under the hood. And so I think eventually this type of legibility will not be an optional nice to have, it will be a requirement.
00:56:52.910 - 00:56:58.574, Speaker B: And I think that is a huge part of Dows as well is building out this legibility.
00:56:58.702 - 00:57:26.534, Speaker C: One final kind of line of questioning for both of you, which is this is where people get also divided a little bit, which is just in the value of the community. And you heard people talking about this a little bit more twelve months ago than you might today. And I'd just be curious what you both see the pros and cons of having a strong community are and where you ultimately see communities contributing to or what place do they play in a dow long term?
00:57:26.662 - 00:58:01.346, Speaker B: I have a hot take on this and I take no credit for this. I give credit to my friend Toby from other internet, which is that community is bullshit and it is a overused meme around launching tokens. And I think the part that is very frustrating for me is that who are you even talking about when you say community? If you can't clearly define a SQL to group within your organization, then they are not meaningful enough participants.
00:58:01.458 - 00:59:06.780, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think the community is definitely a broad way to just generalize your users, your kind of contributors, researchers. Early on with Element, our community was just researchers helping us build and answer tough questions and they were doing that because they wanted to be future users. So I think in many ways there are different types of communities, but it does exist and there's communities around Nike for example. What's the value of that? I mean, I think that's what gives it the true value is like the people who actually support it, they rep it, they do things for it, they believe in it, and that's the kind of center point of every company, whether it's in this industry or not. So I do think community is important, but I do think it has become a meme and it's more of just like there's a very huge difference between a community and governors. Some people are just there to use your product and promote it or do whatever, but then there's people actually care about shaping the future of it. So I think it could be kind of more focused on the actual types of people as like Jules said.
00:59:07.230 - 00:59:54.918, Speaker B: Yeah, and I feel like a lot of it too is just that we're not giving community any discrete powers or control. So I think that just creates a lot of problematic behavior around it. And I think people also generally take advantage of benevolent, maybe community members that are eager to participate or support your brand and don't actually invite them into the process. I think we just got in this really weird place of community is the moat, which to me feels like you're taking advantage of people or you're not actually empowering them in your organization. It's like a way to keep them at a far enough distance.
00:59:55.014 - 01:00:21.474, Speaker A: Jules, I gave a presentation like a month ago and it was called they asked me to give the presentation on how to build community and I don't know. How to share screen on this. Or I'd share screen or my share screen is not working. But I basically was like, first slide is like how to build community, then next slide was like how to build community with a huge red X through it. And then it switched to how to build and then it switched to how to build a cult. And I was like basically the whole.
01:00:21.512 - 01:00:23.106, Speaker B: Thesis of it was that energy.
01:00:23.288 - 01:01:02.414, Speaker A: Yeah. I think a community is like a group of people who like your they like your business, like blockworks, they like the what behind your business. So for media, it's content, they support your business, they're your fans. They hang out in a discord, they hang out in a telegram, you host some events for them, they buy the tickets to the events, they buy your merch voila, you have a community. But the problem with community is that community used to be you might have two communities in your world. In the meet space world, you had like your Thursday night softball game and your church on Sunday or something, but now yeah.
01:01:02.532 - 01:01:07.230, Speaker C: Are those your communities? Those are our communities.
01:01:07.310 - 01:01:41.542, Speaker A: No, but you had like two communities, but on the internet you have an infinite amount of communities. And what happens there is that communities are great when things are going well, but when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And so I think communities are really, really quick to build but even quicker to disband. And I think Charles, you mentioned like, Nike didn't build a community, they built a cult following. And I think that cults are when that group of people like a community is when they're focused around the what like for media businesses it's like the content. For Nike. It's like shoes.
01:01:41.542 - 01:02:02.002, Speaker A: But people who are devoted to Nike, they don't care about the shoes, they care about what Nike stands for. It's the idea behind the business. And so I think that a cult is just this devoted attention to a particular idea of belief. And I think that any company, crypto or not, can benefit really greatly if they put themselves at the center of that idea.
01:02:02.056 - 01:02:13.906, Speaker D: Like the link. Like that's definitely a cult that are like it's like a toxic community. They'll back anything that they'll chain link, people will say, that was a definite.
01:02:13.938 - 01:02:19.160, Speaker B: Have you guys read Toby Shoran's life after lifestyle piece?
01:02:19.610 - 01:02:20.214, Speaker A: No.
01:02:20.332 - 01:03:25.322, Speaker B: It's kind of like congenitally related to this. His is more of like a commentary on cultural production and how we've attached that to products. The argument is that cultural production has become this service for the supply chain. Like we just keep attaching these communities and like cultures around like white label products that we just shove down people's throats. But I think it's interesting when you think about kind of furthering that argument is that I think where we're starting to circle back on is that culture, community isn't the product it's Organization. And organization is a huge part of the byproduct of that. And there's potentially not only a shift in culture, but a shift in how we organize.
01:03:25.322 - 01:03:50.306, Speaker B: And that culture is a means of how we proliferate the effort of organizing. And that is when it becomes most powerful. Because who wants a random group of superfans? Sure. That's awesome. And, yeah, they're going to buy your tickets and your T shirts and all these things. But when you actually invite them into the process of organizing, that's when I think things start to shift.
01:03:50.418 - 01:04:18.734, Speaker D: I think that really emphasizes I mean, bring you back to Dows is like the dow needs a vision. Without a vision. You can't have a cult or a community or users who actually support the future of it. And I think a lot of dows are lacking vision because of the immediate decentralization from the core team passing over ownership to everyone who's leading this. Now we're all confused. We're running around with our heads cut off and we just can't make things happen. Yeah.
01:04:18.772 - 01:04:46.194, Speaker B: I mean, that's the power of meme. Like Kevin Owaki has done that so beautifully. Gitcoin doesn't even have a protocol yet. Their dow isn't a protocol, Dao. But their Meme is so powerful of public goods. That is the mission and core ethos of the Dao. And if you're not participating in the meme of public goods and that culture, there's no way you're part of that organization.
01:04:46.194 - 01:04:51.022, Speaker B: Every single person that's part of Gitcoin Dow is bought in on that culture. And meme.
01:04:51.106 - 01:04:55.260, Speaker D: You're basically a bad person if you don't support public goods. You can't really argue with.
01:04:58.190 - 01:05:16.334, Speaker A: Community. Right. They have a cult that's based around this idea of public goods. So I think every crypto company was like, we have just I just skimmed Toby's piece like this life after lifestyle, and he nailed it's. Like the lifestyle brands. Yeah, I want to actually read it. I'm not giving it justice.
01:05:16.334 - 01:05:41.580, Speaker A: But the idea that every brand was a lifestyle brand when really there were just these white labeled D to C products is the same idea that every NFT project was a community. It's the exact same idea just five years later. One in a thousand will be the next big brands of the future if they can put themselves at the center of this big idea. Like a public goods type of.
01:05:43.390 - 01:05:44.620, Speaker C: Know to your.
01:05:49.310 - 01:05:50.106, Speaker A: Know.
01:05:50.288 - 01:06:13.970, Speaker C: I did not even mean to do that. That's just my cleverness coming out of my pores. Yeah, but if you think about analogs, too, what are some of the biggest brands in the world? I mean, look at what Elon Musk has done with Tesla. If that's not the definition of a cult, I don't know what is. I think Apple the largest company in the world. You could ultimately say it's kind of a cult. These people do wacky.
01:06:13.970 - 01:06:31.160, Speaker C: You know, there was the whole Steve Jobs. And he would go and he had the same dress, right? It wasn't a high priest gown, but it was black turtleneck and blue jeans and people would camp out every time there was a new iPhone and stuff like that.
01:06:33.230 - 01:06:41.834, Speaker A: I really wish I could share this presentation. I literally have a slide in the deck. It says it's the Western Wall in Jerusalem next to an Apple store.
01:06:42.032 - 01:06:45.082, Speaker C: You got historically, you got historical on this.
01:06:45.136 - 01:06:47.646, Speaker A: It was a Fire presentation, honestly, pretty good.
01:06:47.748 - 01:06:54.910, Speaker C: You know, it's a history major for those of you who might not be aware. So that's a nice touch. That's all I can bring to the table.
01:06:58.710 - 01:06:59.858, Speaker A: Good wrapping point.
01:06:59.944 - 01:07:08.386, Speaker C: Yeah. You both have been super generous with your time. If people want to find out more about the work that you do or follow you or whatever, what's the best way to do that?
01:07:08.488 - 01:08:02.120, Speaker D: One thing that I do want to kind of plug at the end is what I was talking about earlier about the governance system council that we built. We've actually really started focusing on building it as a standalone product. So that's like the full governance protocol that you can fork, but it also comes with a reference UI that you can copy as well and documentation and SDK and all these different things because there's no governance framework out there that has all the bundled together to make it easy to fork, which has decentralization at the forefront in mind. The only thing that was really easy to fork before was like setting up a snapshot or a multi. SIG and Compound has a great model, but it doesn't come with everything. You have to build your own UI, you have to work around your software development kit needs and documentation. So we are really excited to start working with tons of partners on that and have them actually use our governance system and test it out and experiment for themselves.
01:08:02.120 - 01:08:08.046, Speaker D: But, yeah, you can reach me at Charlie St. Louis on Twitter and at element. Phi.
01:08:08.178 - 01:08:47.350, Speaker B: You can also find me on Twitter, Jules Rose with Z's and also check out what I'm building with Metropolis. I didn't really give a TLDR of Metropolis, but basically we're building a protocol to manage on chain relationships and permissions and pods, which is like our core product, are the sort of nuclear unit of formation that you can build this sort of relationality between. So creating better assurance mechanisms and accountability systems and ensuring that we're building safe, secure.
01:08:49.130 - 01:08:52.710, Speaker A: Organizations who's like the dream customer that you could get in front of right now.
01:08:52.780 - 01:09:38.446, Speaker B: Honestly, we've been pretty picky about who we actually work with. I think, as you probably notice on this podcast, I'm pretty opinionated about the future of Dows and organizations. So we're most focused on working with organizations that need to credibly decentralize and have auditable and provable decentralized power relationships. So I think you start to look at a lot of wonderful DeFi Dows and protocols and ones that have something very valuable that is worth protecting, essentially.
01:09:38.558 - 01:09:40.310, Speaker A: Charles, Jules. Thank you, guys.
01:09:40.460 - 01:09:41.606, Speaker D: Thanks, guys, so much.
01:09:41.708 - 01:09:48.162, Speaker C: All right, budy, we're back, and this time, we've got matching shirts. For those of you who are following along on video long sleeve.
01:09:48.226 - 01:09:50.294, Speaker A: It is the season, baby. Hey.
01:09:50.332 - 01:10:00.682, Speaker C: The classics are classic for a reason, all right? Although I am feeling a little bit self conscious about this computer setup. We've got a very HD camera. I don't think I'm good looking enough for this.
01:10:00.736 - 01:10:02.330, Speaker A: Bringing out the know.
01:10:02.400 - 01:10:08.506, Speaker C: Yeah, I know. I got to tell Rito we actually got a downgrade on the HD quality here because I've got a face for radio.
01:10:08.618 - 01:10:09.790, Speaker A: Did you get a haircut?
01:10:10.690 - 01:10:13.150, Speaker C: You're the second person to ask me that today, and, no, I did not.
01:10:13.220 - 01:10:15.280, Speaker A: She, like, blow dry your hair today or something.
01:10:15.890 - 01:10:19.410, Speaker C: Can't confirm or deny. I got to look good. I'm going on camera.
01:10:20.870 - 01:10:21.726, Speaker A: All right, budy.
01:10:21.838 - 01:10:39.350, Speaker C: You're not supposed to pick favorites just like your kids. But I got to admit, this was one of my favorite interviews of the season. I think it's been tough to find people who are willing to say or genuinely feel positive about the Dow landscape. I think both of these people did, and it was a breath of fresh air, honestly, and I just really enjoyed the conversation.
01:10:39.430 - 01:11:12.750, Speaker A: In general, I love the combo of Jules is such a deep thinker with why on chain organizations should exist in the world and is obviously building metropolis, but has really thought deeply about it. And then, obviously, Charles is just like charles has implemented a lot of this stuff at scale first at Maker, right? Which was, like, the first to really do it, and it was just a really nice I thought they bounced off each other really nicely. You always ask me first, so I'll throw this to you. What were some of your takeaways?
01:11:12.830 - 01:11:38.442, Speaker C: Okay, so I really like the way Jules and I was hoping that she would do this at the top of the episode. She defined Dows as on chain organizations. Yeah, I think that's a lot cleaner. I'm still deciding to what degree. I really deeply agree with that. But it was a very clean, nice explanation. It was a good impetus for Dows to exist, and the more that I think about it, the more that I like her definition that she spelled out.
01:11:38.442 - 01:11:40.140, Speaker C: And I think that.
01:11:42.450 - 01:11:43.146, Speaker A: What she laid.
01:11:43.178 - 01:12:34.014, Speaker C: Out in between socialware and trustwear was also a big takeaway for me. And I thought you made a really good observation. To use her analogy of socialware versus Know, we talked with Hasu in some of the earlier episodes, the earlier episodes of the season, know, where is it appropriate to become a Dao and what maturation of the Dao do we really want? Decentralization know? I think in her definition of socialware and trustwear, you kind of want socialware in the beginning because you point out it's a good way to bootstrap, right? It's easy and cheap and cost effective and just makes a lot of sense in the beginning. But as you get larger and more mature as an organization, you want to be investing in tools that sort of ossify that trust and remove the need for trust in an organization. So you kind of get trustwear later in a DAOs development. So I really liked what she had to say about that. She really got me thinking, the more.
01:12:34.052 - 01:13:24.702, Speaker A: I think about what Jules said about that, the more I like it. And the reason for that is I still do agree with what I said about social. I think you need to have just like social wear at the beginning, or you don't want to put in place these hard coded trust systems at the beginning. But if you actually zoom out from just building a startup, it's like trust in society is and like, we this week, the biggest thing that happened this week was like, SBF interviewing at the New York Times'dealbook Summit with Sorkin. And it's like, you just look at like, I feel like trust in governments is eroding. Like trust in large financial institutions is like trust in kind of mainstream media outlets is eroding a bit. And when you think about what makes societies, amazing societies, it's really, actually not governance stuff.
01:13:24.702 - 01:13:52.200, Speaker A: It's trust. Like trust is the backbone of society. And it's like if on chain organizations can bring more trust to society right now, it might seem kind of crazy to put organizations on chain, but you could see this world where that flips one day, and it's like, you can't have an organization if it's not on chain, or else people won't trust it. It'll take time, but you could see that happening.
01:13:52.730 - 01:15:01.740, Speaker C: I think it was Selkus who originally pointed this know, in one of the ways that he's described Masari over the years, which was it's not even the Bloomberg for crypto, it's the Edgar database for crypto, which is almost one layer of infrastructure below the Bloomberg of crypto. And back in that we talked about this during the episode, but when Benjamin Graham was famously know, the intelligent investor or whatever, it was very difficult to actually procure good information about companies. But when Edgar launched and became a thing, eventually it was like, oh, this is actually really helpful. And that morphed from, oh, this is good and helpful, to companies actually have to do that, because we view this as something that this is the best way to get information out there to everyone in a transparent way. That was sort of an overton window shift. And one thing that I've sort of been thinking about internally, and this gets to where we were talking about how much of these things are actually just societal choices. I'm starting to wonder and play with this idea that we might need an overton window to shift for a lot of crypto to work and I think that was a big question that I walked away from this episode with.
01:15:01.740 - 01:15:32.326, Speaker C: How much of this stuff do we need to just is it just a matter of time before some of these overton window shifts that yeah, you wouldn't trust an off chain organization because why would you? It's opaque. You could see a future where everything being on chain is demanded of people. But I also wonder, zooming out for a second talking about this neutral financial layer that we're trying to build. I wonder society doesn't seem to want or value that at this particular moment in time. So I'm wondering how much we need an overton window to shift for a lot of what we're building to make sense.
01:15:32.508 - 01:16:20.722, Speaker A: So when you look at how the Internet was created, it took like 50 years, right? Like protocols start getting built in like the then it doesn't really take off until the mid ninety s. And then you don't get Facebook until 2004, and then you don't get the Ubers and Lyfts until 2008. And that's like a 30 year window do, depending on how you look at it, like a 40 year window. And I think we always said with crypto, we're just going to speed run all of that because we have web, two social networks as the distribution layer. The Internet didn't really have that native distribution layer baked in. And so crypto is just going to go much, much faster. But I'm starting to rethink that it will go much faster, but I'm just starting to think that some of this stuff just takes time because you need society to actually catch up to what the technology is, the problem that technology is trying to solve.
01:16:20.722 - 01:16:22.838, Speaker A: And I think that's what's going to happen here.
01:16:23.004 - 01:16:26.626, Speaker C: I think so, too. I thought you made a really good point about cults.
01:16:26.818 - 01:16:29.080, Speaker A: First time for everything. Yeah, first time for everything.
01:16:29.690 - 01:16:33.706, Speaker C: I like that little rant that you went on. I found myself nodding and looking up.
01:16:33.728 - 01:17:11.046, Speaker A: Like this and pondering, well, you know, it's funny. I don't even know if I told you this. I got asked by it's like, Adam Ryan's organization is another media company to give this presentation to a bunch of media execs in New York. And I kicked off this event and the conversation was about how to build community. And because we've built this community with permies. And I sat down on Sunday to make this presentation, I was like, I don't believe that that is a good strategy for every company to just go be like, I want to build a community, but building a cult the few companies that can build these cult followings, really powerful. So glad you enjoyed it.
01:17:11.068 - 01:17:29.450, Speaker C: You know what it also made me think about was one of the ideas that I forget who said this, but it resonated with me. And we've talked about over the years is one of the advantages of having a dow in the community as an extension of the dow is you get to run ideas by them. So in theory, right, it's like, hey, I'm thinking about rolling out a new product feature. What do you guys think?
01:17:29.520 - 01:17:29.754, Speaker A: Hey.
01:17:29.792 - 01:18:02.374, Speaker C: I'm thinking about potentially taking the business in this direction. What do you think? You might be able to, A, get somewhat useful product feedback, but B, avoid these disasters. Like when Netflix rolled out Quickster and they far too early separated the streaming part of their business from the legacy DVD, shipping and rental part of their business and their stock cratered and all that kind of stuff. They right of the ship, but it just took them a long time. And it's a distraction. But one of the business things that you hear a lot of the time that is kind of right, but also really kind of wrong is just talk to your customers and they'll tell you what they want. You can't really do.
01:18:02.374 - 01:18:36.510, Speaker C: How many times have we done that? Where we sat down, talked to our customers, maybe 25 of them, and got 25 different pieces of advice? Because the step that there needs to be some sort of filter there. You have to pick the market and the type of customer that you want before you just start listening to all of your customers. So one of the benefits, maybe, of having a cult is there's some uniformity in what you're trying to do, because there's a bunch of different ways to skin a cat, right? I'm blank on the express. There's a lot of different things you could do. And having a cult with everyone on the same wavelength is probably more useful than having a whole bunch of different disparate opinions. Sometimes that makes sense.
01:18:36.580 - 01:18:59.414, Speaker A: No, it does make sense. And so one of the parts of this presentation I didn't talk about in the episode is I kind of laid it out in three ways to build a call. It's like first you have to define your beliefs, right? Define your beliefs. And usually it's like the founders. Or if you're using startups as an example, like the founders define the beliefs of the company. Then you have to take those beliefs. You have to take them.
01:18:59.414 - 01:19:35.330, Speaker A: Internal. Basically, you have to get people internally at the company on board. The third thing is then you can take those beliefs and share them externally. The fourth thing, though, that few and far between, it's really hard to do or there just really aren't opportunities to do it is what Tesla's been able to do, which is you align the cult financially and you kind of give them financial incentives. And one of the reasons Tesla's got such a strong cult is because people buy the Tesla stock. So they're super bought in. And that's one of the ways that crypto can incentivize these cults a little bit more is like there are tokens.
01:19:36.710 - 01:20:19.810, Speaker C: So that we didn't I didn't really want to get into this because we're all already going down a couple of different tangents. But not to be annoying about this, but I see a bull and a bear case for that. The bull case is there are these examples of communities or cults that have been built. So Tesla and Apple being two really famous examples. Here's another example of where community has actually been a moat in the you know, there's a million if you Google what's this Excel shortcut or how to do this on Excel, there's a bunch of people on these forums that are just dedicated to being there are all these how to videos and how to do it, et cetera. And that's actually an enormous moat for your business because then you don't need to pay people to go and type up how do you do model Question XYZ. People are just doing that for free, so there's a lot of value there.
01:20:19.810 - 01:20:57.294, Speaker C: And I could imagine if you could financially incentivize that stuff by non cash compensation, the form of stock, give people upside, man, those are some really powerful levers that you could start to play with. On the other hand, even when I just heard you describing that Tesla example, something inside me went, OOH, maybe that's not a good idea. And pretty famously, Enron did that with stock, right? They had their stock price in the elevator, and now that's a very famous warning sign that you don't necessarily want everyone motivated by the stock price. There's something to be said about intrinsic value of work and stuff like that. So it'll be interesting. It's a new experimental playground. And that's why I actually have a lot of respect for Charles St.
01:20:57.294 - 01:21:30.780, Speaker C: Louis and the work that he's doing at Element, because in addition to building, we didn't even talk about Element, the protocol at all, which is trying to strip out, hey, that's a harkening back to season one, right? Fixed versus variable interest rate borrowing in DeFi. We didn't even talk about that. He's not only trying to build that ship, he's reinventing the ship of, okay, how do you organize a company or a Dao or whatever. So he's trying to build two planes as they're falling in the air. So just a tremendous amount of respect to Charles and the pioneer, the work that he's doing at.
01:21:33.710 - 01:21:37.898, Speaker A: That'S it. Yeah. Anything else from the you know, the.
01:21:37.904 - 01:22:10.626, Speaker C: Point of this episode, and I think we really got that was this is what is some of the experimentation that's being done in Dow land that wouldn't necessarily have been possible in corporate governance, corporate finance land. And I thought Jules example of socialware versus trustwear was really powerful. An example of trustwear being the governor. And the experimentation that Charles is doing with the council model at Element and some of the voting vaults that he described in the episode was really great. Who do we got coming on for the next episode?
01:22:10.738 - 01:22:13.526, Speaker A: Kevin. Owalki. Coming up next Great.
01:22:13.708 - 01:22:14.440, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:22:15.210 - 01:22:17.240, Speaker C: What are we talking to Kevin awawe about?
01:22:18.170 - 01:22:23.626, Speaker A: We are talking to Kevin awakee about Dows in the next bull cycle. But you tell me what that really means.
01:22:23.808 - 01:23:09.046, Speaker C: Well, what it means is I mean, Kevin owalki got brought up, actually, in this episode by Jules. We didn't even ask her to do that. But it's a great example of someone who's built a very strong meme brand. So we should definitely ask him about your building a cult versus building a community question. But I think Kevin is an example of someone who has been able to maintain he's been sort of a face and brand of a dow without necessarily overpowering how the dow is run. So I think he sort of walked the tightrope balance of early leadership days of a Dow while actually having it be something that's relatively decentralized and keeping that ethos very down. Pat So we wanted to get an understanding from him of okay, this is what dows look like today.
01:23:09.046 - 01:23:17.030, Speaker C: What are the problems? What are the sort of green shoots? Promising areas? How do you expect them to change in the next bull cycle? So that's what we're going to be talking about.
01:23:17.180 - 01:23:18.246, Speaker A: Pumped. Cool.
01:23:18.348 - 01:23:18.706, Speaker C: Sweet.
01:23:18.738 - 01:23:19.334, Speaker A: On the other side.
