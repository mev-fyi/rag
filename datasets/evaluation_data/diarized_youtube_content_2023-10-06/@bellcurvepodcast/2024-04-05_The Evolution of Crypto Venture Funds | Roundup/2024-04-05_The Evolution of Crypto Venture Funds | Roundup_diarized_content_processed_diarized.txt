00:00:00.120 - 00:00:34.776, Speaker A: The one that won the most were like the massive major buyout, low interest rate private equity firms. Like there is sort of a dominant asset class to investor analogy. And I guess what I'm saying is I think there's some model here that's a hybrid of both trading and venture that probably is the dominant, but we haven't seen yet the Paul Turtle Jones stuff style, being able to make it across market cycles, make it across decades. But my hypothesis that it's going to be somewhere between venture and trading hey.
00:00:34.800 - 00:01:05.432, Speaker B: Everyone, wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Solana, Sui, Ethereum, L2s, and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom Bell curve nfts which you can get and mint for free.
00:01:05.432 - 00:01:41.224, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right guys, on with the show. Hey everyone, wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode sponsor Flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that Mev is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with fludd on this season. Flood is the only gasless and Mev free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap. Now this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you flood and back to the show.
00:01:41.224 - 00:02:10.252, Speaker B: Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by uniswap delivering the best on chain trading experience in crypto, period, bar none. One thing I want to call out is the Uniswap extension, so say goodbye. These days are these annoying as our pop up wallet extensions. You lose your place trading, you have to open it back up. Uniswap now has a nice sleek sidebar that persists no matter where you are on the web. It's much easier to use if you click the link at the bottom of this episode. You can join the waiting list and I'll see what I can do to get you moved up that waiting list.
00:02:10.252 - 00:02:36.494, Speaker B: But definitely go click the link. Check it out. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer, the views expressed by my co host today are their personal views, and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:02:36.494 - 00:02:45.826, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell curve roundup. You got Michael and Vance today, and maybe Michael one or two will join us.
00:02:45.930 - 00:02:47.010, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see.
00:02:47.082 - 00:02:47.482, Speaker B: Late.
00:02:47.578 - 00:02:49.426, Speaker C: He's late. We're starting.
00:02:49.610 - 00:03:30.822, Speaker B: Yeah, we could just jump right into it, actually, and I want to get your take on. We were just chatting a little bit before we hopped on here about this maybe brooding drama a little bit in between Aave and maker. So earlier this week, we saw Mark Zeller, who's an extremely important delegate or a stakeholder generally to the Jave protocol. He was tweeting about what he viewed as reckless behavior from. So they've got this partnership with Athena, which also launched this week. Pretty successful launch, I would say. And they're sort of loaning out died to be farmed on the Athena protocol.
00:03:30.822 - 00:04:17.826, Speaker B: And the Mark Zeller take was, hey, this is basically a non battle tested protocol. Weak oracles, asset, hypersensible to market conditions. I'm just reading some of the quotes of his, his tweet, and initially they were talking about proposing an LTV reduction in Dai and Aave today. But then I saw even potential talks like Stani retweeted about, maybe not like, seriously limiting DAi on the AAVE protocol in general. And I think maybe to editorialize a little bit or give some context is there were kind of these three protocols that I would have called the hallmarks of DeFi 1.0. I mean, uniswap. But Uniswap is in its own sort of little corner where I would say, like, curve maker and aave each sort of had their thing.
00:04:17.826 - 00:05:20.178, Speaker B: There was a stablecoin, stable swap and borrow lend. And a little while ago, it seemed like each of these protocols started to infringe on each other's territory a little bit. So Aave launched go, curve launched CrV. USD Maker is expanding its own remit a little bit. And what started as kind of this very neat narrative about money legos, where they each, like, Aave and Maker, I would say, were key components in each one of, like, the Aave adoption of die was a big component in dai adoption in the early days, but now its starting to look like theyre a little bit competitive with one another. And it kind of raises this question of, okay, Ave, is this really, are you putting your risk mitigation hat on here or are you putting your strategy hat on and youre trying to limit dai in some way, shape or form? So I'd be curious what, hey, Michael, what's going on, buddy? I'd be curious what your guys read on this whole situation was, so let.
00:05:20.186 - 00:05:46.126, Speaker C: Me give you a little bit of backstory before we get into it. So this kind of like kerfuffle has been brewing for probably a year. Spark is a fork of Ave V three. There's a revenue share there. There's still some like, chippiness about, you know, it's open source, but like, only if we use it on the Aave side. And like, I don't think that's exactly the right take. Obviously, when you see something like Spark grow, it's probably at like three or four.
00:05:46.126 - 00:06:20.064, Speaker C: No, I think it's higher than that. It's probably like 5 billion TVL in the protocol that's share that, frankly was stolen from or not stolen, but just gained from Aave and go. Obviously, Aave launched go, which is the other part of this. They have competing stable coins. But I think the crux of the issue is there's kind of this, there's two sides of the lending marketplace, at least in ETH Defi. It's like the Aave centric lending style. And then there's the Athena Morpho maker, Spark camp.
00:06:20.064 - 00:07:15.058, Speaker C: And the two camps are obviously separated by, number one, the stablecoin, that's the base unit of account, and the latter ecosystem of Athena Spark maker, they're just growing dye supply. The other crux of the differences are what is the best construction of a lending market going forward, or for really any defi. If you think about what happened last year in Abe when curve was pretty close to getting liquidated, and they, in a lot of people's eyes, were pretty responsible with just how they were setting governance. And there's all these back room communications trying to situation. That's one camp. The other camp is Morpho, which is like isolated lending markets. Kind of looks like Rari from last cycle, where you have people underwriting specific markets that are individually collateralized.
00:07:15.058 - 00:08:08.744, Speaker C: And the benefit there is if it blows up, it only blows up that one market, whereas with Aave, they were looking at significant negative debt. That would have been pretty, probably a haircut across all depositors if curve ended up blowing up. So I think the specific concerns are mostly like a massaging of the information to make her look bad. And I think this is in the face of, a, them losing a lot of share to the other ecosystem, and b, frankly, I don't think the Aave model is the future of lending. I think it has to be these isolated markets, because that's the only way that you're going to be able to scale to like the long tail LRT's and all the collateral that people want to use today in a safe way. So I think it's like kind of sour, sour grapes a little bit, a little bit of coke from the aave side.
00:08:11.364 - 00:08:48.764, Speaker B: I don't know if, Michael, if you had anything to add, but I'm curious to get. And just for folks, when you talk about the more isolated markets, like Morpho's model, to be honest, I'm not an expert, but I understand that sort of a p two p model like layer that sits on top of AAVE and actually directly matches people. And the advantage would be it's more capital efficient, because on the aave side of things, you obviously have to over collateralize the loan. So there's some amount of just idle capital that's sitting there. And in a p two p matching sort of environment, you don't have to plan for that type of thing. Is that roughly right? Or could you say a little bit more about your p two p vision of the future events?
00:08:49.614 - 00:09:23.884, Speaker C: You can do other stuff. Like, if I'm an underwriter of one pool, I can choose to automatically underwrite other pools with either similar collateral or people that I know and trust who have underwritten them. And so you do have like the cross collateralization of markets. I think a lot of what it comes down to is also just governance. Like, are you voting on, are you getting the whole community to vote on every single change to every single interest rate curve and. And new type of model that wants to be accepted. Cause like that increases the vector for politics and like, you know, self dealing to happen.
00:09:23.884 - 00:09:58.636, Speaker C: And like the curve scenario was like, totally. Like, if we wanna talk about risk management, like, that was the closest that Defi has gotten to a serious body blow in the past couple of years. But like, if you have these individualized markets, like, it constrains the risk, but also the governance surface area, which is like generally the area that we should be moving towards. Less human intervention in these markets and less room for political attacks from one competitor to the other. That's just, I don't think has a place in crypto not to say that.
00:09:58.660 - 00:10:53.998, Speaker A: I agree with this, but to strawman the other side, I will say, to your point on Athena in particular, there is a lot of human intervention at this point. I think Athena will be able to de risk a lot of this as they move towards decentralized perps. And I know that that's the plan. The plan is to eventually have Athena run off of something like a synthetics, perps, or any other options that live on chain. But right now, they can't get enough of the funding rate to be able to farm that just with centralized. So I think that there's a move where a lot of this consternation, a lot of the sour grapes gets de risked as things like Athena or any other qualms that may come up eventually on the individual lending side get squashed over time. But I think that that move right now, it's kind of an easy target, and it's moving in the direction of decentralization.
00:10:53.998 - 00:11:03.714, Speaker A: But just calling that out is something that. It's not a non zero risk, just given the construction that they have right now, but I think they're moving in the right direction.
00:11:05.534 - 00:11:54.148, Speaker C: The ultimate risk for Athena that has 15 or 20% of open interest on these exchanges is like, somehow the money is lost, and they use custodians that are industry standards, don't want to put them here, but we use some of these same custodians. They have insurance. They have all this type of stuff. Also has an insurance fund in case anything were to happen. But I think what could happen is basically these centralized exchanges, effectively to hunt Athena in some way. Like, something happens or there's some slippage, they try to close out a position, and the exchange just says, you know what? Like, you've got a couple billion on this. Maybe I'll just clip 100 million from you and see if their account gets locked.
00:11:54.148 - 00:11:54.428, Speaker C: Like.
00:11:54.476 - 00:11:56.424, Speaker A: Or there's the.
00:11:58.644 - 00:12:06.636, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. But if it. To Michael's point, if it happens on decentralized perps, that removes most of this ability, but then you.
00:12:06.660 - 00:12:09.292, Speaker A: And that's the direction that they're moving, right.
00:12:09.428 - 00:12:20.292, Speaker C: You do introduce smart contract risk, but, like, if that's the ultimate criticism, we all have smart contract risk. So, yeah, I'm not quite sure where that is from.
00:12:20.468 - 00:12:41.444, Speaker B: I've got a question for you guys. Here's another. I haven't heard anyone articulate this, so maybe it's just a stupid idea, but one other risk that I see with Athena, and by the way, I'm in the camp, that a lot of these risks are sort of overpowered. Like, you see all these people comparing Athena to Luna, and that's just. I just think that's totally different. Ballpark. I don't know where you guys sit on that, but doesn't seem like the same thing at all to me.
00:12:41.604 - 00:12:43.020, Speaker A: It's not the same thing.
00:12:43.212 - 00:13:17.386, Speaker B: Yeah, not the same thing. But you know what, one of the, I mean, basically what they're doing, right, is they're democratizing access to the basis trade. And I think it's really smart because we had this interview will air next week, but Nick from Cumberland, Drw. I chatted with him earlier this week. That was a great intro. Thanks, Vance. And we were talking about Athena, and what he mentioned was part of the reason why this basis trade still exists is there's just an imbalance of supply and demand of capital to actually that's willing to close this spread down.
00:13:17.386 - 00:14:07.470, Speaker B: I guess the question from me to the Athena team is what happens when you fix that supply demand imbalance, right. There's like a v one of this, which is really easy, which is just like, keep all your assets in, like staked ETH, right. And then you either do like some mix of centralized or decentralized exchanges to go short the perp. But then what happens once that revenue kind of goes down? Like you, the Athena team is going to have a choice to just shrink the protocol, right, and assets are going to leave, or you're going to look for more risky collateral potentially than Steve or some other way to, like, keep the growth engine going. And that, to me, once they've maxed out the natural amount of yield that comes from that basis trade, that's going to be a really pivotal strategic question for Athena. The protocol, that's one of the risks that I see, actually, we're in a.
00:14:07.502 - 00:14:57.774, Speaker A: Structural bull market right now, which means that, and there is always a natural bias towards the funding rate leaning more towards the positive skew either way. But right now, the positive skew is much higher. Just given that there's much more demand to go long than there is to go short, the thing that we won't have ever tested, it's like what we used to say back in 2020 or 2019. We haven't seen crypto exist when we had interest rates above zero. We haven't seen Athena exist when we've had a negative bias for a long period of time. It's happened in short periods of time over the last couple of weeks, months as it's been live and scaled. But to your point, Mike, if you get to tens of billions of float, and that 1015 percent of funding actually gets to be like 50, 60, 80%.
00:14:57.774 - 00:15:08.334, Speaker A: There is a big question as to whether or not the yield is going to be worth the risk, and that's where we'll find an even middle ground. But at that point, it's still pretty massive.
00:15:10.794 - 00:15:46.730, Speaker C: When funding goes negative, they basically turn off the short position, and then they just get the staking yield, which is, like, considerably less, but it's also denominated in ETH. So, like, maybe you're getting 3% in a bear market, but you think that 3% will go to 12% if it quadruples. That's kind of what you're playing for at that point. But the closing out of the short is the interesting part. Like, just a scaled down example. Like, say you were trading, like a defi coin or a gaming coin, and you were 12% of the open interest or more, and you tried to close that out. Like, that would be very hard to do.
00:15:46.730 - 00:16:12.474, Speaker C: You might incur significant amounts of slippage, which would eat into the yield that you're giving people. And you wouldn't know until you tried to withdraw. Right. Or until they tried to fix the issue and close up the short. So, like, there are risks for sure. But I also think, like, the. Just to get back to the original abate point, like, the maker model is taking more risk now.
00:16:12.474 - 00:16:25.674, Speaker C: That's the point. We're in a bull market. The yields are extremely high. This is the time where you have to do that. But to say it's an existential risk, I don't think that's true at all.
00:16:26.534 - 00:16:43.190, Speaker B: That's where I sit, too. People have to remember the Luna model. The whole stablecoin was collateralized by equity in the protocol, which is to say, it's not collateralized by anything at all. Right. Like, so there.
00:16:43.222 - 00:16:47.434, Speaker A: There's apparently a billion dollars of bitcoin, though, that was backstopping it.
00:16:47.854 - 00:16:49.074, Speaker C: What happened to that?
00:16:50.174 - 00:16:53.314, Speaker B: The Luna foundation guard. Whatever happened to those guys?
00:16:55.534 - 00:16:57.078, Speaker A: I think they're on trial right now.
00:16:57.166 - 00:17:01.026, Speaker C: They broke up. They didn't make it.
00:17:01.190 - 00:17:43.480, Speaker B: Yeah. Damn. I want to give a shout out, actually, to. I guess this has been a little bit of an open secret for a while, but it's like, Semi. I've seen him tweeting about it, so I guess we could talk about it, which is Cobie's new thing, which is Echo XYZ, which I think some of our analysts are early beta users of it. But from what I understand, Kobe's trying to create a platform which is going to democratize access to seed stage or very early stage deal flow in crypto. So I guess the idea is that in addition to raising from the frameworks of the world or whoever, blue chip investors and angels, et cetera, you would also have a community portion, and maybe in the most charitable way.
00:17:43.480 - 00:18:19.644, Speaker B: The benefit is that you still have the cap table that you want the frameworks or the paradigms or whatever, and angels, for all the strategic investor helping stuff, but it's actually nice to engage a portion of the community as well and have the community on your side. So maybe you have some kind of allocation to them, and maybe that's the way that you also avoid some of the adverse selection problem that crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter typically has. Because from the founder perspective, you don't want your entire cap table to be like 10,000 random degens on the Internet. That's not a good idea either. So it'd be a cool idea if it worked. I'm rooting for it for sure.
00:18:20.024 - 00:18:20.424, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:20.464 - 00:18:21.364, Speaker B: What do you guys think?
00:18:24.024 - 00:19:05.690, Speaker A: Well, let's just say this. I think that there's a pretty common practice right now where you have a known person, influencer, round of individuals later in the process, kind of close to launch. And I think that what that does is it builds a group of people that are able to be knowledgeable, be invested, and be able to talk about it right before the product or service, whatever it is, launches. I think that there is a room for that. I think doing it in a, like, really transparent way, it'll just be interesting. This stuff has been tested before. You know, there were syndicates that were put together in 2017.
00:19:05.690 - 00:19:47.014, Speaker A: There were. I mean, we've invested alongside, you know, groups of people that have pooled capital together. And I think a lot of that does work. I think it's hard to have a really, like, angels play a distinct role in any of these, you know, investing ecosystems and opportunities. I think it's hard for angels to necessarily. It's hard for projects to find a massive group of angels that are going to be really bought in specific to that product or service. And so that's where I think being able to discern, like, who are going to be the right fit for whatever it is that I'm building, who are going to be the ones that can represent this, who are going to be the ones that can talk about this the right way.
00:19:47.014 - 00:20:09.664, Speaker A: That, I think will be an interesting test to see if echo can cover all the bases versus just, like, be a generalist angel platform. But, I mean, I think that we are in the world of financial innovation, and if this becomes a new model for capital fundraising and getting it into hands of a bunch of people that are going to use it and talk about it, that's a great thing.
00:20:11.444 - 00:20:51.234, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we, like Kobe, support him. I think also, you know, maybe this cure some of, like, the, we only do projects if they're like these totally ironic meme coin vibes. Because I'm assuming you'll have to have a real project if you're ipoing ICO ing whatever on this platform. And yeah, if you can figure it out, you know, regulatory wise, I think it's cool. And I think ICos did bring something to the whole game. It was more so, like, you read the white paper, there was like, at least like, some veneer of, like, trying to accomplish something. So maybe this helps that.
00:20:51.234 - 00:21:14.030, Speaker C: I think it's cool. I also hope that it's not the same influencers getting the allocations. I don't think it will be. But we've just, we've seen so many of these, like, influencer rounds. Not that this is related to echo specifically, but, like, it feels like there's the VC rounds, the influencer rounds, and then public. So there's like, room in there for something else. Yeah, we like coinless too.
00:21:14.030 - 00:21:18.444, Speaker C: We think. We think getting tokens into the hands of real people is important.
00:21:19.184 - 00:22:08.930, Speaker B: Yeah. I think there is a why this has been a challenge model in the past is like, from the founder perspective, I mean, even those, like, those two groups that you mentioned, like, VC's add value, like, good VC's. I think that's another part of this conversation is, I'd be curious from your guys perspective, like, what percentage of crypto VC's today do you think are, like, good value add VC's versus, like, slightly less so maybe, maybe a slightly smaller portion than the total stock of crypto VC's that exist. But there's. But generally, if you get good VC's, they're super, super helpful, right? And like, angels for the most part are helpful. Like, I don't know, I think people tend to look at this from the perspective of, like, what is fair, right? And, like, it feels like retail should get access to the same opportunities. But for, from, like, at least my perspective is like a builder.
00:22:08.930 - 00:22:30.962, Speaker B: You know, blockbuster doesn't have a token, but there's, like, keeping your cap table simple and small is beautiful. Um, and I would prefer to optimize towards that than almost anything else, to be honest. Um, and so that is, I think the challenge that you run into, at least from the, from the builder standpoint. Um, but I don't know, it's a.
00:22:30.978 - 00:22:35.344, Speaker A: Lot of communications with investors. If you have. And you go from ten to a thousand.
00:22:35.804 - 00:22:37.732, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:37.908 - 00:22:47.824, Speaker C: Different regulations, too. I'm curious how this is being done. I mean, if there's, like, an interesting structure here, maybe that enables just more people to, to take part in it, which is cool.
00:22:48.364 - 00:23:13.144, Speaker B: Kobe, if you're listening, man, come on the show, because I know there are these things like channels, apparently, and you can, I guess maybe there's. I'm really speaking. I don't know if this is the case, but my, my assumption would be that maybe you could, like, copy invest. You know, once you're on the platform, you can kind of set up a channel. And if you're like, oh, like, Vance, like, this is really good taste. Like, I want to get access to the stuff that he's investing in early. Like, maybe you could do some of that.
00:23:13.144 - 00:23:17.924, Speaker B: But I don't know. We should get Kobe on the show to talk about it.
00:23:18.084 - 00:23:18.772, Speaker C: I like it.
00:23:18.828 - 00:23:51.178, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the title sponsor of this season of Bell Curve, the wormhole foundation. Now, if you are an on chain user, which I bet you are, if you're listening to Bell Curve, you know that the cross chain experience in crypto still sucks. Let's just call a spade a spade. We talk about it on this program all the time. Interop is still a big problem, which is why we specifically wanted to team up with the wormhole foundation. They are a decentralized interop platform that powers multi chain applications and bridges. So that could be anything from Defi to nfts, governance, oracles and more.
00:23:51.178 - 00:24:21.054, Speaker B: So if you are a developer and you're building cross chain assets, apps or data or anything like that, I highly recommend that you click the link at the bottom of this episode and go check out to see what you can build on wormhole. And wormhole. First of all, this is a fun team. They did something really cool with us. You can actually go and click the link at the bottom of the screen, which is going to send you to a landing page where you can claim your own unique wormhole NFT. So we're doing this with me, and we're doing this with Jason, my co founder. So help a brother out.
00:24:21.054 - 00:24:54.932, Speaker B: It's a super cool NFT, I promise. Go click the link at the bottom of this episode and fill out your po app. Get your free NFT. And if you're a dev, head over to wormhole and check out to see what cool cross chain stuff you can build. Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, fludd is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because fludd is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season, and this is relevant for both traders and devs. So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to flood swap and start trading because they solve three massive problems.
00:24:54.932 - 00:25:29.056, Speaker B: One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run mev free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price. Head over to flood swap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes. We're going to send you right there for the devs. Out there you can leverage floods, flexible hooks, allowing you to make swapping a first class primitive by adding custom order types like or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of bad mev. If you want to reach out to them, go to devslood bid or just jump right in the discord.
00:25:29.056 - 00:25:55.106, Speaker B: All right guys, thanks very much. Appreciate you flood everyone. This episode is brought to you by uniswap, delivering the best on chain trading experience, period, bar none in all of crypto. Here's how I would divide the protocol today. There's a web part, a mobile part, and an extension part you can say goodbye to. The pop up wallet extension was just not great from a UX perspective. Now what they've delivered is this nice clean sidebar where you can just very easily track swaps, sign transactions, send or receive crypto anywhere.
00:25:55.106 - 00:26:19.566, Speaker B: Just a huge UX improvement on the web part of it, huge improvements here. You can buy and sell 700 plus tokens at your price on your terms. And they've got limit orders which are powered by Uniswap X. And there's gasless. They've also got real time charts, transaction logs, pool data, project information, all this cool stuff that just really improves your UX trading on the web. And again, all this is powered by the smartest protocol in terms of Uniswap or Uniswap X. Click the link at the bottom.
00:26:19.566 - 00:26:54.146, Speaker B: Uniswap extension is in alpha right now, and we'll see we can do about getting you moved up that list. Thank you very much. Uniswap. All right, maybe we should talk a little bit about, I don't know if you guys saw the story that the United States, which is one of the largest holders of bitcoin generally, maybe, maybe sold a little bit of bitcoin this week. This was, I do feel this was telegraph from a long time ago, actually. They filed to sell like $130 million worth of bitcoin for at least like three or four months ago. So I don't think it should be a wild surprise.
00:26:54.146 - 00:27:08.782, Speaker B: But maybe that has a little bit, a little bit to do with the recent price action that we've seen. Or frankly, maybe it was just. This is one of those things that happens in bull markets and we were always going to sell off a little bit range because it can't be up only forever. But what do you guys make of this news?
00:27:08.878 - 00:27:12.634, Speaker A: I mean, the government's got to find a way to replenish that SPR.
00:27:15.254 - 00:27:19.114, Speaker C: Any of the other shit that they properly finance.
00:27:21.174 - 00:27:26.622, Speaker A: Dead pirate Roberts. Dread pirate Roberts. Funding. Funding the government.
00:27:26.758 - 00:27:27.222, Speaker C: I know.
00:27:27.278 - 00:27:41.954, Speaker A: I mean, do we know, like, I didn't track it other than the movement to Coinbase, I guess. And that was sort of, I think that was 2000 bitcoin. Bitcoin. Is it like, for sure that it was sold? I never really kind of followed the end of the trail.
00:27:42.654 - 00:28:15.928, Speaker B: Not really, no. It's honestly, I kind of have, I feel like by the. There's. I think there are supply, like, supply in the market matters an enormous amount. But I sort of feel like by the time that it also is, you know, every once in a while you'll hear, remember about a year ago there was all this, like, oh, the, you know, Mount Gox claims are finally, you know, gonna make their way to market. And there are a couple Twitter accounts that were like, this is super bearish and yada yada. And it's like, I feel like by the time the supply fud reaches like this, like, when you're hearing about it on a podcast, like, you probably don't have to worry about it that much.
00:28:15.976 - 00:28:44.608, Speaker A: I mean, the other thing too is I feel like people are still living in the, like, 2018, 2019 days of liquidity in markets where, like, the market structure has fundamentally changed. I mean, we have Blackrock and fidelity ETF's. We're about to get options on them. There's about to be more ETF's in the next couple of months. I don't know, like, the structure of this industry has fundamentally changed. We're selling $2 billion of bitcoin in some way, shape or form. Maybe it's a forward contract.
00:28:44.608 - 00:29:12.754, Speaker A: Maybe they bought options to hedge the price. Like, who knows how they're doing this? But they also have a duty to make sure that they get the best execution and they're not dumb. They're going to be talking with maybe the galaxies of the world who are going to help facilitate this type of transaction. This stuff, I think, is actually a lot more easily absorbed by the market. And we should stop thinking a $2 billion sale of bitcoin market sale on Coinbase is going to kill the entire industry. It feels a little bit hyperbolic.
00:29:13.454 - 00:29:17.314, Speaker C: I mean, BTC traded 30 billion over the past 24 hours.
00:29:17.614 - 00:29:18.634, Speaker A: Precisely.
00:29:19.334 - 00:29:44.614, Speaker C: Come on. There is the signaling of more supply in the market. I remember when these things used to drop the market, like 15, 20% and it would stay there for a few months. This didn't drop below 65, and it's like 68 almost today. I think it just underscores the persistent bid that you have from a variety of sources, one of which is the ETF's.
00:29:46.754 - 00:29:57.176, Speaker B: It's just a larger, more mature market than it used to be. I agree. It's just totally different structure. You know, they're good. Have you guys ever read this book, Market Wizards?
00:29:57.360 - 00:29:59.724, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, of course.
00:30:00.104 - 00:30:23.810, Speaker B: So I just saw that it was for free on, I guess, Spotify now has audiobooks and they're giving some amount out for free. And I saw there's a free audiobook, so I just, just kind of listened to some of the old interviews. Dude, so some of these guys have totally blown up. I don't know if you've looked at. I've like, looked up like, what happened to these guys? Post market wizards, and the majority of them, like, blew their. Blew their whole stack. But a Paul Tudor Jones is in there, and there's.
00:30:23.962 - 00:30:26.346, Speaker C: With an accent, too. With the southern accent.
00:30:26.450 - 00:30:28.266, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's.
00:30:28.330 - 00:30:29.018, Speaker C: Dude, it's.
00:30:29.066 - 00:30:53.070, Speaker B: There's some timeless wisdom there. And I do think there's an analogy. Like, if you hear these guys, they're talking about trading soybean futures contracts in like, the seventies, but there's a lot of analogies to what it sounds like trading crypto today. So I don't know, just timeless stuff about, like. Like what you were saying, Vance. Like, you can't get out at the top because there's no liquidity at the top. So, like, basically just if you're trading in size, get out while you can.
00:30:53.070 - 00:30:56.614, Speaker B: There's some great, as they'd say, lessons in there, you know?
00:30:56.654 - 00:31:02.794, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. But, like, I think the other, the converse side of that is, like, all of these experiences happened once.
00:31:03.094 - 00:31:03.758, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:03.886 - 00:31:26.664, Speaker C: Like, Paul Tudor Jones was trading, like, soybeans and cotton and then, like, currencies and, like, that's where he came from. Like, we're definitely in a different branch of finance. If people want good books. I think the three or four best ones that I know on trading are market wizards. Soros on Soros. More money than God by Sebastian Mallaby. But to your point, most of these guys have blown up.
00:31:26.664 - 00:32:06.004, Speaker C: Some of them have systematized. Paul Tudor Jones is interesting because they literally tried to document what he did and reverse engineer a programmatic strategy to trade like Paul Tudor Jones, and they couldn't do it. It's just like, it's all feel. And his whole thing is like, I only trade the inflection points, and I trade it with a lot of leverage, and if I'm down 10%, I cut. So all these guys kind of have different strategies, but I think more money than God is probably the best multi cycle view on the best people. And to your point, most of them have blown up. Tiger was revered for its strategy at the time of writing of that book.
00:32:06.004 - 00:32:08.744, Speaker C: Now the jury's kind of out.
00:32:09.084 - 00:32:27.532, Speaker A: Also, a great doc on. I can't remember the name of it, but there's a great doc on Paul Tudor Jones where he goes down to his house in Virginia and he's trading over the phone that's connected to the wall, and he's waking up at 05:00 in the morning, east coast, so they can trade Asia hours. He's a legend.
00:32:27.708 - 00:32:55.894, Speaker C: And the role of technology and where information sharing happens now is so much different than it was before. Before, like, yeah, to Michael's point, like, the Soros on Soros book, he's like reading a newspaper in a gondola in Switzerland while he's skiing. And he gets, like, an idea from it. You know, these people are reading newspapers like, there's no twenty four seven real time information flow. It's a different game. All those guys would trade crypto if their career started today, but they would be way different.
00:32:56.514 - 00:33:30.248, Speaker B: I agree. There was actually a guy in that book, Richard Dennis. I don't know if that name rings a bell, but he was one of the inspirations, like, early inspirations to PTJ. And he actually, to prove a point with a friend that you could teach traders, brought these, like, 20 or 30 analysts on that he called the turtles, and he gave them, like, a simple trend following strategy, and it all worked. And it was like, it's just funny because he. And it proved at the time of this reading that you can teach someone to be a trader, and then like a year after this, he had to close all of his funds. He just lost it.
00:33:30.248 - 00:33:36.564, Speaker B: And none of those turtles ended up being successful. They made like $200 million in a couple of years. And then it just, none of it worked ever again.
00:33:37.104 - 00:34:34.684, Speaker A: Here's a question. Here's a question, and I don't even know the answer to it, but I'm still thinking about it. Why is it that there aren't any people in crypto if this is, you know, let's put this to the, like the electronification of the stock exchange or trading commodity futures in the eighties and late seventies, why isn't there a Paul Tudor Jones of crypto from a trading perspective? Someone who has systematically beaten the market consistently, hasn't blown up yet. I mean, in every cycle you have, like, you would have said three arrows maybe, but like, it turns out they actually didn't know what they were doing the whole thing or didn't do risk management properly. But I don't know, just a hypothetical. Why isn't there someone who you can point to and be like, oh, that's the Stephen Ako and the Paul Tudor Jones, the blah, blah, blah of this cycle, of this asset?
00:34:35.424 - 00:34:41.792, Speaker C: I think we're getting there. But Paul Tudor Jones was like a multi decade phenomenon. Same with most of these guys.
00:34:41.928 - 00:35:25.194, Speaker A: I mean, sure, but he, PTJ started in like 83, 84 and kind of like, you know, I guess he started trading a little bit earlier than that, but like he built his firm in the eighties and survived crashes and everything. I'm just saying because I think my hypothesis is that it's a totally different market structure again. And trading in the same way that they did is maybe not the best system or the best strategy for participating in these markets. It may be a short term way to participate, but I think a liquid strategy or a trading strategy may not be the thing that works, just in the same way that Paul Tudor Jones is as a venture investor.
00:35:27.534 - 00:36:05.406, Speaker B: Michael, maybe there are Paul Tudor Jones. You just don't know them yet. Because even at the time of this 89, I think, was when market wizards was, was all those interviews happened. I think the net worth of most of these guys was anywhere from like 3 million to like, yeah, hundreds of millions, right? They're not, it's not like the billionaire, you know, that Paul tutor Jones was. There are probably like, frankly, like these, some of these like anon accounts, right? Who just like, maybe, you know, they're Twitter, maybe they're not on Twitter. But they probably just, like, kind of quietly traded their way to, like, you know, mid to low nine figure stacks. And, like, maybe one of those guys or gals just ends up, like, making it for the next 30 years.
00:36:05.406 - 00:36:06.926, Speaker B: Right. Then you'll know who they are.
00:36:07.110 - 00:36:08.594, Speaker A: The Obi wan wallet.
00:36:09.334 - 00:36:10.114, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:11.334 - 00:36:20.554, Speaker A: I don't know. I mean, you can see these things on chain. We can track them on chain. There hasn't been someone who has been able to consistently make it across market cycles.
00:36:21.934 - 00:36:48.314, Speaker C: One of the more meta points is, like, if you added up all the crypto that all the big funds own, how much do you think they would own relative to the total market cap? So call the total market cap. 2 trillion of crypto assets. How much do all the crypto funds own? 30 billion. It's, like, not that much. It's like 1%, 2%, maybe 3%. I think probably one or two.
00:36:49.454 - 00:36:54.514, Speaker A: I mean, there's a trillion of that as bitcoin. And you assume 20% to 25% of that is lost.
00:36:55.134 - 00:37:22.774, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. You can definitely haircut it. But none of the funds are big enough yet to be the Paul Tudor Joneses of the world. Like, the super brief summation of more money than God is like tigers trading equities in the eighties. Paul Tudor Jones is trading commodities in the eighties. They kind of do this relative value trading of each. Those markets get constrained, then they all move to trade macro.
00:37:22.774 - 00:37:44.914, Speaker C: And that's kind of like when Paul Tudor Jones really kills it. Tiger does really well, but less on the currency side. That's like when George Soros really comes on the scene, is like the king of the macro traders. But these are huge markets. And I think it, like, you know, the peak tiger was, I mean, 50, 60 billion aum in 1900.
00:37:45.814 - 00:37:48.406, Speaker A: I mean, in 2021, there were hundreds.
00:37:48.470 - 00:38:01.554, Speaker C: 50, 60 billion, probably in the nineties. But, like, relative to today's value of the dollar, that's probably like 100 billion. And they were just levered. So these ones are huge. And I think until we get there, it's going to be hard to see the Paul Teeter Joneses.
00:38:02.934 - 00:38:31.134, Speaker B: I agree with that. There's another angle that you could take on this as well, which is like, there's a hedge fund sort of trading component to this, which looks like some of those, like, Paul Tudor Jones guys, currencies, commodities, et cetera. But then there's, like, a venture. There's, like, a venture thing. And, like, one framework that stuck with me is there's a guy, Ron Chernow, who writes biographies of famous people, and he did one on John D. Rockefeller called Titan and John dude. Probably one of the cooler business stories of all time.
00:38:31.134 - 00:39:17.724, Speaker B: But if you go back to this is like 18 hundreds when he was building Standard Oil. But at that time, also a lot of parallels to crypto industry. It was like oil was the new sexy thing. There was super, super cyclical because they'd find a new geyser of supply, oil prices would crash, there were towns popping up overnight, millionaires, all that stuff, then lost all their money. Tons of similarities. Everyone had a really short term mindset on it, but he just took a super long term mindset and his strategy basically was like, he was great at operations, that type of thing, but he had really good relationships with banks. So when the industry would like blow up, he would go get credit from the banks, buy up all his competitors and then wait for like the tide to come back, make a ton of money, wait for people to blow up, acquire them, and like they're probably going to be a couple power law winners like that in this business.
00:39:18.544 - 00:40:25.870, Speaker A: This is kind of what I was getting at, which is I think for each asset class, for each period of time as well, there is a dominant investment thesis, investment strategy that takes advantage. If you were going to be the best investor from just taking a step back, who are the ones that won the most at a period of time? You've got the tigers in the eighties, maybe the early nineties. You've got maybe the Paul Tudor Jones on the same timescale with some of the macro trading as well. But in the late nineties as the people that won the most were like the Silicon Valley venture capitalists. In the two thousands, the one that won the most were like the massive major buyout, low interest rate private equity firms. There is sort of a dominant asset class to investor analogy. I guess what I'm saying is I think there's some model here that's a hybrid of both trading and venture that probably is the dominant, but we haven't seen yet the Paul Turtle Jones style, being able to make it across market cycles, make it across decades.
00:40:25.870 - 00:40:29.794, Speaker A: But my hypothesis that it's going to be somewhere between venture and trading.
00:40:30.774 - 00:40:58.680, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, just interesting facts. And benchmark is way more. Compare benchmark to Brevin Howard. They've roughly been alive for the same amount of years. Benchmark obviously has crazy multiples on its fund. Brevin Howard is more year in, year out, 1020 percent, but it's liquid and you can withdraw and all that good stuff about hedge funds. But I think benchmark is generated somewhere in the neighborhood of like 30 billion total profits.
00:40:58.680 - 00:41:15.614, Speaker C: And Rev and Howard, since inception, has generated like 28 billion. And so the aggregate profits are the same. One is just way more capital efficient. And frankly, if you're more capital efficient, that's more performance for, for the people who run it.
00:41:16.754 - 00:41:55.374, Speaker B: Preston, I mean, what do you guys think? I sort of see what it feels like. The most sophisticated funds are structured framework or a paradigm or something like that, where there's a more traditional vc portion of the book, which is just direct equity investments in companies, but then there's a liquid portion of the book as well. I actually don't know how you guys structure, but I know some funds are like, this is our. And they have, like, different teams, right? Where it's like, hey, this is our team that only does venture. This is our team that only does liquid. And the liquid guys kind of look more traditionally like hedge fund guys, and then the more traditional venture are venture guys. And I think Tiger actually, today in its modern instantiation.
00:41:55.374 - 00:42:00.358, Speaker B: Chase Coleman. Right. There's a. I can't remember if he's the public market guy. Public.
00:42:00.406 - 00:42:01.278, Speaker A: Public guy.
00:42:01.406 - 00:42:04.398, Speaker C: He. Now, since Scott got left.
00:42:04.566 - 00:42:06.354, Speaker B: Oh, really? Interesting.
00:42:06.994 - 00:42:08.134, Speaker C: He's in charge.
00:42:08.474 - 00:42:13.066, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I guess Scott had a little tough run of it.
00:42:13.090 - 00:43:00.620, Speaker A: Yeah, he did. But Scott was the private, the venture investor, and Chase, historically was the public, I think. I mean, the way the framework is structured may be slightly different from how other funds are structured. Our view is that over a period of time, crypto moves so fast that you have to be able to take advantage of whatever it is that's happening at that point in time. The way we say it is, you have to be able to play the game on the field. And if you are doing multiple funds, doing multiple strategies, have multiple teams, it's hard to course correct, because invariably, you're going to have some group of people at the firm who are like, well, wait, I can't do any liquid stuff because this stuff's way too overpriced. Or, wait, I can't do any venture stuff because nothing is working.
00:43:00.620 - 00:43:22.494, Speaker A: I think you have to morph and change to be able to adjust with the times. And I think a lot of the funds also have, like, the hedge fund structure and the venture fund sidecar. It's really tough, frankly, from, like, an LP perspective to do that. So, you know, our take is to have one fund at a period of time.
00:43:23.634 - 00:43:24.154, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:24.234 - 00:43:56.468, Speaker C: And we're. We're like a founder driven fund. Like, we do all this stuff, and I don't think. I mean, it's weird. Maybe it does work for some people, but it's weird to think about, like, I got my long short guy. I got my guy who only does this one section of venture. I got this guy who's smaller, is better in a market like crypto, where you can keep it all in your head at once, as long as you're, frankly, on the ball 24/7 some of.
00:43:56.476 - 00:44:23.014, Speaker A: The best DeFi investments have been buying tokens of protocols that have launched at low valuations. Some of the other best DeFi investments have been buying, you know, an equity with a token warrant before they've launched. It's all deFi, and it just. The mechanism in and of itself, I think, is the question. And that's where you see opportunities. And if you're someone who wants to cover Defi, you should be able to do both. It's not like you need to be able to do one, and you can only do that one.
00:44:23.634 - 00:44:53.864, Speaker C: I'll also say, coming from a retail background, trading coins on exchanges and flipping icos way back in the day, all that stuff, that's where all of our instincts come from. And obviously we have the venture background, but we also know how to trade. If you've never made money in crypto before and you're coming at it from a pure venture perspective, it's probably hard to imagine what being on binance actually feels like. And that's just background that you need.
00:44:55.004 - 00:45:41.430, Speaker B: I've got a question for you guys. On the founder side of things. What do you think? Like, if you looked at the dynastic founders of the early Internet era, there were some common factors there. It was like, guys that looked more like Jeff Bezos. And I don't know, we've talked about this before, but one of the challenges that I think is maybe there's a lot of analogy to, like, a lot of comparisons maybe, between early to mid nineties Internet and crypto now, because there's kind of this separation between got, like, kind of young, more inexperienced founders, but they get it. They're like crypto natives versus, like. But they don't have some of the operational chops to, like, grow and manage, like, you know, at some point, thousand person teams or whatever, you know, thousands of employees versus some of the.
00:45:41.430 - 00:45:51.034, Speaker B: I don't know, some, like some of the web. Two founders I meet, they're, like, so polished, but I'm like, it doesn't feel like they're close to the metal on their, like, product or anything. You know what I mean?
00:45:51.514 - 00:46:05.494, Speaker A: So let me ask you this. What's the most. What's the most successful example that we have? Let's say Amazon, maybe one of the most successful from 1993 when they started. What's the most successful example that we have.
00:46:08.234 - 00:46:08.826, Speaker B: In crypto?
00:46:08.850 - 00:46:10.254, Speaker C: You mean in modern?
00:46:10.554 - 00:46:47.626, Speaker A: Yeah, like in crypto. Like, what's the most successful, I mean, just to speedrun, I would say Ethereum and probably something like Solana and maybe something, you know, like the base alt layer, ones that are doing really well, that have a lot of attention, a lot of activity. But look at them. Look at the model of Ethereum. If Jeff Bezos is the canonical example from the nineties, Vitalik is the example for this era. It's a totally different construct where you're building a protocol, you're not building a company. Like eventually you want to be able to hand over the tease to the decentralized community and have it run by itself.
00:46:47.626 - 00:47:13.694, Speaker A: And, like, you get to be someone who, you know, writes thought pieces and helps, you know, steer thought and direction like that. That I think is, is kind of, I think if you're a web3 founder, what you need to be aiming for now, if you're building a product or if you're building something that's built on top of a protocol, like, that's a totally different equation. But I think if you're, you know, you're targeting something, you're, you're kind of targeting that.
00:47:16.004 - 00:47:44.248, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say more international, for sure that too. More risk on. From a regulatory perspective, I would say some of the Defi founders are on the cusp of it. It's just like the market caps. I think you need to kind of get to be like 10 billion market cap to be like the. And frankly, some of these were there last cycle, and it looks like they could be going back. So I think there will be a time for a different type of founder archetype to emerge.
00:47:44.248 - 00:48:36.644, Speaker C: But the web, two founders in San Francisco, I don't know, they just don't seem built for crypto and the strangeness of it. And frankly, it's a weird time in tech in general. What are the things that are working in a traditional venture funds portfolio? Definitely not fintech. The last real consumer tech hit that we had was b real, but that has effectively been subsumed by the larger networks. You've kind of got AI, but that's like you're hunting elephants. These are like $10 billion seed rounds or a billion dollar seed round or something. It's definitely like there isn't as much opportunity in technology as there once was or it's very changed into a different form, form of being like crypto AI and then maybe like hard tech.
00:48:36.644 - 00:48:48.524, Speaker C: I do say, you know, people are building fucking defense companies and they're like, Palmer Lucky is the archetype. Like, it's really stratifying the types of founders that make it.
00:48:48.984 - 00:50:03.928, Speaker B: Here's something else that maybe is a little bit unique to crypto is like, if you just look at the last 15 years of tech or something, it's been a pretty steady grind upwards, right? There haven't been like, it's like a little cyclical. Startup life is always super hard, but it's just something that I've noticed with founders that come from tech a little bit more is there's like, the strategy is kind of like you just want to load up with as many engineering sort of resources possible, raise a bunch of money, and then the assumption is like, there's going to be some variability in your revenue, but not a ton. Whereas like, the crypto founders that make it cycle over cycle, it's like you have to deal with like, I don't know, anywhere from 50% to 90% drawdowns in your revenue, like multiple times, and then you have to bring your entire team along with you. And there are other businesses out there that are extremely pro cyclical, like construction or gold mining and semiconductors or shit like that. But there's no overlap between people with a tech background that are used to working in procyclical businesses versus like a lot of the pro cyclical businesses are really like capex heavy, you know, kind of commoditized businesses today. That's another. I don't know how you guys think about that or how you've like, coached founders around those inflection points, but I.
00:50:03.936 - 00:50:05.456, Speaker A: Mean, look, that's another one, dude.
00:50:05.480 - 00:50:06.232, Speaker B: It's just tough.
00:50:06.328 - 00:50:07.864, Speaker C: I kind of disagree with that too.
00:50:07.984 - 00:50:33.268, Speaker A: I was going to say I'm not sure I totally agree with that. Think about the arc of Amazon. Like, there were years where they were at 90% drop from their ipo price and no revenue. They're selling books over the Internet. Nobody even cared about the Internet. I mean, I also, I worked at Snap before the ipO. We had a great run up in the ipO.
00:50:33.268 - 00:51:28.828, Speaker A: It dropped 60, 70% after the ipo. I happened to leave right about then, and then it went on this massive run up until 2021 and then it dropped 90%. Like, the tech industry is kind of is known for these cyclicalities, whether it's something that's brought on by like the crypto macro cycle, drawing everything else, or dragging everything else down, or, you know, interest rates and inflation getting out of hand in 2021, and COVID and craziness. I mean, I think if anything, like the tech industry is probably the most calloused to it. Sure, maybe it's not a 95% drop, but I think it's pretty common for people to experience that. It's much more uncommon for people to be on a Google like rocket ship, where every single quarter from your ipo is just up and to the right. That is not normal.
00:51:28.996 - 00:52:02.474, Speaker C: Same thing happened at Netflix, went down 80, 90%. Same thing happened at Facebook where it was like, are they going to make the mobile wave? And then even if you look at the attrition rates of startups, I would say as a whole, if you thought about all the startups that were funded in 2021, probably 90% of those are dead. And that's just like when you're in tech or you're an entrepreneur, that's the risk you take. If you don't want to take that risk, you can go sell mayonnaise at Procter and Gamble, but everything else, there's going to be some ups and downs.
00:52:03.324 - 00:52:08.796, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. That's a really fair point. You know, Netflix was the first stock that I ever bought way back in the day.
00:52:08.940 - 00:52:09.716, Speaker C: Wow.
00:52:09.900 - 00:52:10.452, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:10.548 - 00:52:11.344, Speaker C: You knew?
00:52:12.044 - 00:53:04.240, Speaker B: Yeah, hold on to it. Actually, I sold it at like the absolute picotop, like five years, so correlation, but I rolled it into Roblox, so that was not really, that was not a good choice. Yeah, I was honestly, like, my thought process there was just, if you listen to young kids, I have a story that my dad hates telling, which is when I was in 6th grade, he was like, pick a stock and I'll put like 1000 or $2,000 into that stock for you. I picked Apple at the time, which was like, dude, it was like $18 pre all the stock splits. It's probably 200 x ago. And my dad thought it was overvalued fib to me about it being buying Apple and bought like polymer tech something or other, which like, was. And my, and my sister did the same with Google.
00:53:04.240 - 00:53:14.752, Speaker B: The company she picked is Google. It was like, honestly, little kids kind of have a decent read on, like, anything that young kids are super obsessed with. Like, can't live without a decent barometer of the future, to be honest.
00:53:14.848 - 00:53:27.728, Speaker C: Everyone has these stories now of the thing they didn't buy, or they did buy, or their friend bought that went 200 x if they would have just held onto it. I feel like nobody had these stories, like, a decade ago because these companies weren't that big.
00:53:27.896 - 00:53:48.432, Speaker A: I've got a quick story. Vance knows this. My dad has a friend who played for the 49 ers, won the Super bowl in 95. Gets like a 25, $50,000 bonus check for winning the Super bowl. He was a backup tight end. Like, didn't even play, got traded. The following year, takes the entire Super bowl bonus check.
00:53:48.432 - 00:53:52.416, Speaker A: All of his teammates are, like, buying cars, going on vacations, going to Vegas.
00:53:52.480 - 00:53:53.992, Speaker B: He's like, eh, I don't know.
00:53:54.008 - 00:54:17.328, Speaker A: I'm just going to put it into something that I know. And he's like, I've got this Apple computer. I'm just going to put it all into Apple stock. Well, it gets traded the following year away from San Francisco, and ultimately forgets about this brokerage account. Like, they're trying to send him the paper slips. His address has changed. He gets called back to become the offensive coordinator at UC Berkeley, and they're finally like, we found you.
00:54:17.328 - 00:54:29.814, Speaker A: We've been holding onto this brokerage account for the last 30 years, or however many it's been at that point, 20 years, and, like, what do you want to do with it? It has $22.5 million worth of Apple stock in it.
00:54:30.994 - 00:54:35.694, Speaker C: I mean, that's literally the best investment strategy is just coma.
00:54:36.634 - 00:55:05.206, Speaker B: Yeah. I think there was a study that got published by Fidelity a while ago. This is going to sound a little morbid, but the people, you know, who. The cohort of people who did the best investing in fidelity was? People that died. Yeah. So I guess, like, last. Last thing is, I would love to get your guys perspective.
00:55:05.206 - 00:55:49.850, Speaker B: I don't know if you have any exposure to this at all, but, like, the liquid restaking space. So this is like, obviously, there's been an enormous amount of TvL that's gotten sucked into Eigen lair, and everyone's extremely excited about whenever they end up launching. But there's this new we've talked about on Bell curve a number of time, but there's, like, a liquid restaking layer. So in the same way that you can get, like, a liquid voucher, which represents your share of a staking pool, like Lido, you're going to eventually be able to get, like, a sort of essentially deposit certificate of wherever you're restaking to. And the dynamics of that are pretty different. Much more heterogeneous construction under the hood than like, a liquid staking token. But, yeah, honestly, if you look at the valuation of something like Etherfi, I think it's the leading one.
00:55:49.850 - 00:56:02.734, Speaker B: I mean, that's trading at like a seven or $8 billion valuation. I would just, like, be curious how you guys assess this whole space. I'm not sure if we've ever really talked about this, but what's your read on the whole LRT space?
00:56:03.874 - 00:57:28.180, Speaker A: So I think let's take a step back and talk about what an LRt is. And essentially, maybe in the parlance of Athena, what you're talking about doing is you're taking state ETH as the base layer, and then you're adding another layer of yield on top of it. And the expectation is that other layer of yield will be worth the additional risk of you taking that asset and restaking it and putting it up as the capital asset to be the security module for a new, whatever, AV's new protocol, whatever the big question is, I checked yesterday, eigenlayer has 4 million ETH in it, and the expectation is that you're going to be using this ETH as the security layer to backstop these new avss that are going to come about. Well, what is the yield required from those avss or those new protocols such that it compensates stakers or restakers enough, in addition to the state ETH rate for the additional risk that they're taking? My guess is that, you know, 4 million ETH is, is probably slightly too much for there to be a nice democratized yield that is worth it. And so I think what we're going to see here is, and really, I think, you know, Etherfi, it's kind of a proxy right now.
00:57:28.212 - 00:57:28.396, Speaker B: It's.
00:57:28.420 - 00:58:30.474, Speaker A: It's sort of like the world coin equivalent to an ADR for Sam Altman. I think Etherfi is kind of acting as like a proxy for what they expect Eigen layer to do based off of the points that are being assumed and getting exposure to this restaking environment. We'll see where all of this lands. It just launched, so it's kind of hard to assess real value of something that has just launched. But I think that there's a ton of other restating providers that are going to be launching in the next couple of weeks, and we're expecting that Eigen layer is going to launch in the next couple of months. I also wouldn't be surprised if we start to see other restaking platforms that are competitive to idean pop up. And I think that it'll be a question as to how do you keep the TVL? And that question is really answered by what's going to be the yield that that TVL can actually assume is it going to be an additional 4%, 5%, 6%? Instead of getting three or 4%, you're getting 10%.
00:58:30.474 - 00:58:54.784, Speaker A: Maybe that's something that keeps it, but that means that you have to artificially limit the amount of yield that can go into it. Otherwise, it drops the percentage yield for everybody. It's this fine balance of what's going to be the inflection point. How much value is iDEN going to lose once they do their airdrop and launch everything? And once people see that apy a lot of open questions.
00:58:56.104 - 00:59:59.524, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we think that there's probably at least one other approach that's going to be compelling in articulating, like, what is the end game for, even, like, liquid staking protocols. Is it a smaller amount of restaked ETH? Is it, like, higher quality avss? Because there's a lot of AVss on Eigen. Like, I'm sure some will be good, some will probably be okay. Or is there kind of, like, other vectors of, like, economic alignment that they can offer, maybe even similar to something like a cosmos, where they're kind of like, the original vision of Cosmos was like this venture kind of fund. And I don't think it's like a venture fund, but something like, people take mantle seriously because they've got the big treasury and it's shared community, and if you're in, you're kind of part of that sector versus something that's permissionless and hard to kind of ascribe the alignment to. So I think there's going to be a lot of interesting opportunities to earn yield on ETH, but it's not just going to be, like a unipolar. It's just Eigen layer approach.
00:59:59.524 - 01:00:07.764, Speaker C: We think there's probably going to be at least one more. And, yeah, we've got a portfolio company announcing, and hopefully the next week, kind of what they're doing, which will be cool.
01:00:08.824 - 01:00:22.730, Speaker B: There'll be multiple. Well, here's a question. They'll probably be most likely different ecosystems. Like a. I don't know, like a. Yeah, you've already sort of got shared security on the hub. Like, the cosmos hub.
01:00:22.730 - 01:00:46.006, Speaker B: Is that. To, like, some degree. But, like, maybe you'll get one in Celestia, maybe you'll get one in Solana. And the idea would be that, like, even, like, a good example of why this might be necessary is it depends. It's like a balance sheet management thing. Like, if your liabilities are denominated in Solana, like, you could imagine a bridge, right, where, like, your liabilities would be denominated in Solana. So you would actually need Solana restaking as opposed to ETH.
01:00:46.006 - 01:00:48.994, Speaker B: So it kind of makes sense to me that there would be.
01:00:49.334 - 01:00:50.054, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:00:50.134 - 01:01:07.446, Speaker B: I know. I guess there's one which is sort of an open secret that's launching, that's going to try to be all token restaking. And then I think there are a couple that are launching in specific other ecosystems. But we could end the year with like five of these things. I would say, like, who knows which.
01:01:07.470 - 01:01:08.514, Speaker A: One'S the open secret?
01:01:09.894 - 01:01:18.090, Speaker B: I don't, but yeah, but we'll let that be a secret for a little longer. So. Yep. Yeah.
01:01:18.202 - 01:01:19.094, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:01:20.634 - 01:01:33.394, Speaker B: Have you guys listened at all to Hasu and John Charbonneau on Common Core? Did a really great episode on the whole ETH staking, like targeting a certain percentage of stake debate. Like, I don't know if you guys are.
01:01:33.554 - 01:02:03.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not taking this seriously until it's like, you know, I'm glad that we have like the immuno response of people throwing up all over this. I don't think they should touch the issuance curve. They should just leave it alone. But this is so far from even becoming like potential reality that kind of ignores. You kind of got to pick which CT debates you're going to get involved in versus not. We've kind of made our position clear, but I don't think there's a big risk of this actually going through.
01:02:04.234 - 01:02:35.592, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an interesting intellectual divide. I see that. I see that. I be on the don't touch the issuance curve either, but I see where they're coming from and it's like you can debate how real the dilution generated yield really is. Like the block reward type yield. So I get it. Maybe there is a world where Ethereum network people want you to hold more canonical ETH as opposed to wrapped, but I feel like that ship has already sailed, so we're so far past that.
01:02:35.592 - 01:02:36.616, Speaker B: I agree.
01:02:36.800 - 01:02:47.184, Speaker C: So quickly that politically that's going to be hard to push through. I also think, frankly, demand matters a lot more than supply.
01:02:47.564 - 01:02:48.504, Speaker B: Totally.
01:02:49.924 - 01:03:05.244, Speaker C: Growth, abundance mindset. We'll find people to buy it up. Let's just make it as good as possible. And that's where the community is getting at in the fullness of time, which I think just means not touching it. So we're not, not really concerned.
01:03:05.704 - 01:03:32.792, Speaker B: I've got one more question for you guys, is just in general investors here. So I've started to see this argument pop up. So we just had wormhole that had a massive airdrop. And I saw these arguments around Jito as well. Basically that it's a stimulus check for a particular ecosystem, right? Like when the jito rare drop happened. That's a ton of wealth that got sort of created overnight. And theoretically, people are going to, some people are going to hold Jito and some people are going to maybe rotate that into meme coins or something like that.
01:03:32.792 - 01:03:47.240, Speaker B: Do you view these large airdrops as wealth creation events? Do you view it as maybe dilution? Because then, I don't know. How do you just view these big airdrops? Or is it just, are people just trying to make something out of nothing and it's just a big airdrop and that's it?
01:03:47.432 - 01:04:19.574, Speaker C: It's a big airdrop. We're not doing, like, the planet here. We're airdropping coins, roughly, similar type of people that we've been dealing with for the past few years. And the concentration of the wealth is what makes it real. And the fact that people will trade it for meme coins or other stock or other coins or other, you know, the borrow against it. Like it's a wealth creation effect. But I'm so sick of the thought pieces about meme coins and airdrops and, like, guys, like, we don't need the, the expose.
01:04:19.574 - 01:04:21.254, Speaker C: We get it.
01:04:21.754 - 01:04:37.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm with you on that. I actually, Michael, I loved your take on meme coins last, last podcast that we did. But, dude, it's like my entire feed. I just. I just wanted to stop at this point. I'm just begging these people to, like, just something more interesting than this. It's just not that.
01:04:37.154 - 01:04:39.306, Speaker C: Maybe echo. Maybe echo helps.
01:04:39.490 - 01:04:52.904, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, because the ICO thing actually was, it did feel more fair. Like these FTVs. I know you guys were on this page, but like, maybe it doesn't matter now. It will matter at some point. I don't know.
01:04:53.064 - 01:05:19.644, Speaker C: Yes. Also, I think the worldview of you can only have meme coins, or more fundamentally, coins going up and you can't have them at the same time. It's just so untrue. Just looking at our portfolio, we're doing fine. If you're not invested in meme coins and you're not investing in fundamental coins, what are you invested in? I don't know who the upset parties are in this market. It's kind of hard to tell who they are.
01:05:20.304 - 01:05:23.632, Speaker B: I don't know. Maybe people just want to chat. Shit.
01:05:23.808 - 01:05:30.336, Speaker C: I think it's people whose coins are not going up as, like the daily top performer, which we've talked about. Don't do that.
01:05:30.520 - 01:05:31.432, Speaker B: I agree.
01:05:31.608 - 01:05:33.124, Speaker C: You'll be miserable forever.
01:05:33.584 - 01:05:39.164, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, fellas. Should we call it here? This is a good one.
01:05:39.704 - 01:05:40.472, Speaker C: Later.
01:05:40.648 - 01:05:56.358, Speaker B: See you guys later. Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we are incredibly excited to have teamed up with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol.
01:05:56.358 - 01:06:06.734, Speaker B: And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. Take you get your free nft.
