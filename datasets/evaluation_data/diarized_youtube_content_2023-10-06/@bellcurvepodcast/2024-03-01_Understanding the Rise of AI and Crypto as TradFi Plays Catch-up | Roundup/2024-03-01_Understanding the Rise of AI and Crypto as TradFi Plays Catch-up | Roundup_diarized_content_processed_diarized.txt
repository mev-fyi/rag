00:00:00.090 - 00:00:09.760, Speaker A: I don't know if you looked at the Reddit s one as they prepare for their s for IPO. Oh, almost 10%. Oh, we got the answer.
00:00:10.770 - 00:00:13.402, Speaker B: Such a nice surprise dance. What's up budy?
00:00:13.546 - 00:00:17.786, Speaker C: Sorry guys, just got off Bloomberg. You know, doing God's work had somewhere.
00:00:17.818 - 00:00:19.118, Speaker B: More important to be than, you know.
00:00:19.124 - 00:00:24.142, Speaker C: Your humble work, that little local tv station called Bloomberg. Not sure if you've heard of it.
00:00:24.196 - 00:00:55.082, Speaker D: Hey everyone, wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, sui, Ethereum, L2s and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts which you can get and mint for free.
00:00:55.082 - 00:01:14.722, Speaker D: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. Alright guys, on with the show. Hi everyone. This episode is brought to you by Swell, a team leading the restaking future with their liquid restaking token Rsweep. Now I've talked about liquid restaking on this program before. I think it is going to be a massive tectonic shift for Ethereum and I am super, super excited about it. And I like the swell team a lot.
00:01:14.722 - 00:01:35.030, Speaker D: Goes without saying, do your own research. This is not financial advice. You guys all know the drill. Again, I like this team. And if you stick around, I'm going to describe how you can restake your eTh in swell, earn pearls, eigen layer points, and a whole bunch of future rewards. So thank you very much for swell, for making this episode possible. Hey everyone, wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator.
00:01:35.030 - 00:02:01.794, Speaker D: Now, if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that Mev is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with flood on this season. Flood is the only gasless and mev free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap. Now this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you Flood and back to the show. All right everyone, welcome back to another.
00:02:01.832 - 00:02:03.054, Speaker B: Episode of Bell Curve.
00:02:03.102 - 00:02:08.386, Speaker D: Before we jump in. Quick disclaimer, the views expressed by my co host today are their personal views.
00:02:08.418 - 00:02:10.418, Speaker B: And they do not represent the views.
00:02:10.434 - 00:02:12.886, Speaker D: Of any organization with which the co.
00:02:12.908 - 00:02:22.666, Speaker B: Hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal.
00:02:22.768 - 00:02:24.650, Speaker C: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:02:26.590 - 00:02:34.234, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another weekly roundup edition of Bellcraft. Today you're joined by Lego's one and two. Just for two of us. Hold on. Before it, Michael.
00:02:34.282 - 00:02:49.378, Speaker A: How you doing, budy? You know, doing well. Doing well. Getting Denver foMo. Excited to hear how that's been for the last. Yeah, you know, we trim the fat, we just continue forward and better, faster, stronger. Just the two of us.
00:02:49.544 - 00:03:12.934, Speaker B: Lead and mean, baby. Lead and mean. Yeah, Denver's been great. I was just telling you off air, but I did get a surprise right when I got here, which is that the Airbnb I'm staying in doesn't have heat. How many of you know, dude, the story about how this happened, though, is so funny. So, you know, like a little, what? Like 24 hours before you get to an Airbnb, the host like, hey, here are some details that you need to know for your visit. Here's the lockbox.
00:03:12.934 - 00:03:27.406, Speaker B: Go in the back door. Here's the wifi password. Oh, by the way, there's no heat. You got to leave with that, my man. Also, how is it even possible that.
00:03:27.428 - 00:03:29.498, Speaker A: Someone has a house in Denver that doesn't have heat?
00:03:29.594 - 00:03:30.750, Speaker B: I don't understand that.
00:03:30.820 - 00:03:31.950, Speaker A: It's February.
00:03:32.610 - 00:03:48.070, Speaker B: It's like 15 degrees out. Yeah, literally, there's like one space heater in this place, and it doesn't work. So I dragged into my bedroom last night. I went to the other bedrooms. I grabbed the blankets there. I slept in this, and I fetal positioned in the bed. But that's fine because we're live.
00:03:48.140 - 00:03:52.150, Speaker A: If someone's listening to this and still in Denver, someone get Mike and you're.
00:03:52.650 - 00:04:37.874, Speaker B: Yes, please help a brother out. I'll give you a quick update, though, on the conference. So I've only been here for 24 hours, but I was expecting a little bit just because we'll talk a little bit about markets. But I was curious to get the overall sentiment and vibe because this could very well be a period of euphoria. Obviously, with bitcoin and eth doing what they're doing right now, it really doesn't feel like that at all, actually, if anything, I talked to a lot of folks who joined the industry over the last couple of years. And they're in this really fun period where their faith is basically being affirmed. So if you're someone who's listening to this and you joined a couple of years ago, right in time for the bear and you were thinking about leaving, shout out, this is your time.
00:04:37.874 - 00:05:21.086, Speaker B: And this is actually one of the more fun times to be in your crypto journey. So there's a lot of that, but it really didn't feel too fomoy or anything like that. With the exception of two areas, I would say to a lesser degree, I would say restaking is like really starting to pick up steam. Tons of restaking events, not even just Eigen layer specifically, but other types of solutions. And I think that's definitely going to get pretty hot. There's a lot of speculation about when token for Eigen layer what it's going to come out at in terms of FTV stuff, we've maybe briefly touched on the show. The area that does feel like there's a lot of interest and potentially hype is AI and AI to mean you see it in the private markets.
00:05:21.086 - 00:05:51.678, Speaker B: Right, Michael, I started hearing this a couple of months ago from friends. They were like, yeah, it was like every other round. And then there were the AI rounds and they're raising ten times more at a way higher valuation with way less product and all that stuff. And my personal take on it is that I think this stuff is actually very real, but it's probably going to take a little bit longer to play out than everyone thinks. But it's shaping up to probably be the hypeiest area of this cycle. Maybe similar a little bit to nfts where last cycle nfts were clearly real, but they just ran away so hard.
00:05:51.764 - 00:06:01.214, Speaker A: So that's my kind of really nfts. There was an NFT collection that hit almost 100 billion FTV last cycle. I don't remember that.
00:06:01.412 - 00:06:19.070, Speaker B: Yeah, actually that's a really good point. Honestly. We're already kind of at. Yeah, you're talking about world coin here. But yeah, they were at the point of the cycle where I did this post about how ridiculous that is. And I'm just getting called actually pretty funny mid curve, Mike. Pretty funny nickname.
00:06:19.070 - 00:06:28.902, Speaker B: I was like, all right, just getting called mid curve here for pointing out that this shouldn't be at 100 billion dollar valuation. They got you on your own podcast title.
00:06:28.966 - 00:06:29.820, Speaker C: They did.
00:06:32.670 - 00:06:34.380, Speaker B: What do you think about that though.
00:06:36.670 - 00:07:38.798, Speaker A: Just to further the point, I had a check in with one of our founders yesterday who started Allora, which for those that don't know about it, it's a new platform for AI technology and model proliferation. Excited about what they're doing. They haven't launched yet. We've been a partner of theirs over the last few years and seen all the progress. For those that remember, it's the original upshot brand that is now developing and sound developing its own l two to take the upshot technology as the first model within the Allora ecosystem. And Nick was telling me that he made some merch that said something, and I'm going to butcher the exact phrase, but like the first self healing, self replicating AI l two. And he was walking around Denver and people were just coming up to him saying, how can I invest? Can I give you money? What is going on here? So I think two things are true at the same time.
00:07:38.798 - 00:08:34.618, Speaker A: Number one, the excitement and all the attention I think is warranted to a certain extent. There is real technology here. There is real applications that are going to be developed. There's real use cases for blockchain technology that fit within the AI ecosystem writ large. And to your point, I think we're also probably furthest away from this being real in terms of all the other application categories that we're talking about that are launching. For anyone who can develop something that works right now and something that has applications right now, there's going to be that real attention grabbing, the real kind of capital grabbing elements. But I do think that maybe this is something that when we looked at last cycle or two cycles ago, everybody was investing Alt layer ones kind of at the bare at the bottom, and it took basically another three years for all of that to be realized.
00:08:34.618 - 00:08:59.190, Speaker A: And that's kind of what we saw in 2021. The recognition of all of that, maybe AI is the thing that people invested in in 22 and 23, and it'll take until 24, 25, 26 for it to actually materialize. So in terms of sort of like the investment phase, the application phase, and then sort of like the adoption and recognition phase, I think we're kind of in the application to adoption phase.
00:08:59.530 - 00:09:47.558, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree with that. And it's one of the reasons that I actually came to eat Denver this year is to learn more about this, because I don't know that much. But from my understanding, there's a couple ways that you could approach it. And you probably know more than me even just from talking to the two. There are different layers of the stack where it makes sense to intersect AI and crypto, but the two use cases that people are pretty excited about is agents. So you could consider like we've talked a little bit about these intent type frameworks where right now a user of crypto, you kind of interface directly with a smart contract or a protocol. We're moving to this world where you actually interface directly with a searcher or solver or filler, which is really just a market maker, and then they will do this complicated cross chain transactions and just abstract all that away from you.
00:09:47.558 - 00:10:27.758, Speaker B: You could imagine a world where you're not actually interfacing with a market maker, you're interfacing with one of these smart AI bots that just does all of that for you. And it makes a lot of sense for this to be in crypto because it's much more permissionless. These ibots can just use ETH as money and do all this stuff, whereas in a more tradby type world, there are just way more frictions around that. So there's the agent angle, and then there's the decentralizing ownership of the model's model. And this is where I'm just so early in learning about this. I still don't fully understand it, but the way that I would think about it is everyone saw the Gemini images that Google has been generating. Right? And whatever your politics are, you could probably agree there's definitely a strong bias or worldview.
00:10:27.758 - 00:10:48.300, Speaker B: You can say it's a good thing, you can say it's a bad thing, but it's definitely there. And if AI becomes as important as everyone thinks that it's going to be, you probably want it to not reflect the biases of one particular centralized entity. You'd want it to be a little bit more, the governance structure should be a little bit more distributed. And so I think people are trying to figure out how to do that in crypto one.
00:10:48.830 - 00:11:20.978, Speaker A: Yeah. Not to make this a total AI pod, we got to sit back to our macro roots here. But I think about it in terms of the value chain, right? And it starts at the hardware level. And right now, that's frankly why Nvidia is ripping. That's why OpenAI is going after the $7 trillion raise to build their own fabs, build their own chips. All the things that kind of go into the creation of H GPU capabilities to do this actual work. That's one angle.
00:11:20.978 - 00:12:02.434, Speaker A: And there's a couple of protocols that are working on how do we democratize access based off of supply demand marketplace for the actual chips themselves. I think that that's pretty interesting, frankly. Right now, we're just so, the entire world is so supply constrained for these chips and these capabilities that it's really hard. Like you have Mark Zuckerberg talking, know in a Facebook post about how many chips they're buying from Nvidia. It is becoming a moat if you know those assets, those physical assets. But over time, if you assume that supply kind of catches up with demand, you're going to be able to have a sort of decentralized marketplace for that chip capability. That's number one.
00:12:02.434 - 00:13:16.902, Speaker A: Number two is there's model creation and model proliferation, which is exactly what you're talking about. I think my personal opinion is that the jury is still out as to whether or not private proprietary models retain the value. Or to your point, if it's going to be more an open source model creation, model generation, and the value doesn't accrue necessarily to the model itself. It could be something where we've talked about this for years, where it's like the Facebook algorithm versus an open source algorithm in terms of what content you see, and everyone would say, oh, well, we don't want the bias of Facebook, or we don't want the bias of whoever that proprietary company is creating that algorithm and feeding us whatever content it is that we actually see. And I think about the same way with model creation, it's possible that chat, GBT or Gemini, they have some biases, but they're also the biggest, and they're the ones that are getting the most trained and the ones that are most useful, therefore. And so I think we're still in this phase of like, we don't know the value accrual for models yet, or how that will look and feel. But then there's also the inference side, which is sort of like the output side of the models.
00:13:16.902 - 00:13:44.994, Speaker A: And I think that's actually probably one of the most interesting. It's like, what can you do with all of this backend and have it applied to something? And there's actually like DeFi protocols that are working on stuff like this right now. I know Rune has talked about doing governance through AI. There's going to be some really interesting applications of this that will touch on the back ends of decentralized compute and decentralized model creation. But the inference side, I think, is one of the areas that's probably sitting forward right now.
00:13:45.192 - 00:14:41.622, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think one of the things to consider as well on the value proposition of making it more neutral and more decentralized in terms of ownership than a company that has a bias like Google. Keep in mind, Google owns YouTube, which is one of the largest proprietary data sets that you can feed into an AI algorithm on the planet. And the other thing is, at some level, no matter what, you're going to have to make decisions about the answers that these things spit out. Because as soon as you, just to use really extreme examples, right. You don't want on something like Google to be able to search like snuff films or something like that, right? So as soon as you have that sort of decision, then you're operating on a spectrum of like, someone has to make decisions about where the line exists. Someone's going to have to do that for these AI models as well. And I agree with your point about the inference level being super interesting.
00:14:41.622 - 00:15:08.720, Speaker B: And frankly, I think it's just going to take a really long time for protocols today to experiment with what's actually useful. So I'm not an expert on this at all. I'm just learning about this too. But my best bet, I think there's going to be a lot of money thrown at this. There are going to be a lot of ideas and manpower thrown at this. Some of it's going to work, a lot of it's not. But I would guess we're on like a four or five year timeline here for actually building pretty useful things.
00:15:09.890 - 00:15:11.422, Speaker A: Two thoughts coming down to that.
00:15:11.476 - 00:15:12.078, Speaker B: Number one.
00:15:12.164 - 00:15:34.280, Speaker A: So yeah, you're exactly right. The data ingestion is sort of how you define a lot of what that model will say at the end of the day. And that business, I think, is actually flying kind of under the radar right now. I don't know if you've looked at the Reddit s one as they prepare for their IPO, almost 10%. Oh, we got Vance here.
00:15:35.130 - 00:15:36.370, Speaker B: Such a nice surprise.
00:15:36.450 - 00:15:36.754, Speaker C: Vance.
00:15:36.802 - 00:15:37.682, Speaker B: What's up, budy?
00:15:37.826 - 00:15:41.158, Speaker C: Sorry, guys, just got off Bloomberg doing God's work.
00:15:41.324 - 00:15:43.318, Speaker B: Had somewhere more important to be than.
00:15:43.404 - 00:15:48.934, Speaker C: Your humble origin, that little local tv station called Bloomberg. Not sure if you've heard of it.
00:15:49.132 - 00:15:51.306, Speaker B: Brings you to the good word to the boomers.
00:15:51.498 - 00:15:58.480, Speaker C: Been doing a lot of that recently, both Michael and I reconnecting with our boomer friends.
00:15:59.250 - 00:16:05.280, Speaker A: Nice, sorry, step into our AI office.
00:16:06.690 - 00:16:08.400, Speaker C: Better late than never, but.
00:16:09.570 - 00:17:07.262, Speaker A: Well, last two thoughts on this, Mike. So number one, Reddit, almost 10%, or I think a little bit over 10% of their revenue in the past twelve months has been data selling, basically like selling all of the data that they have in Reddit for AI model generation. I think this becomes, for anyone that has a proprietary data source, this becomes a huge business model. And I think also people, it's kind of like when at and t had the unlimited data plan for the iPhone they didn't know how to value it because they were, oh, like, what are people going to do with data on their phones? And then the app market came out and all the different apps became richer, denser, and at T was like, okay, kill that. We can't have that. I think we're kind of at that stage of data within AI where all the companies that have proprietary data are like, wait a second, we can make more money just by selling the stuff that's in our databases. And they're totally undervaluing it because that's exactly what is the most important ingredient into what generates these model output.
00:17:07.406 - 00:17:44.638, Speaker B: Can I ask you a question about that? Do you think there is an analogy here to the more traditional, I'm not even sure the word for these types of business, but like, the CBS and the NBCs that used to license their content to Netflix, where it was this juicy revenue stream in the short term, but ultimately ended up creating an enormous amount of equity value for Netflix, and then they were able to just vertically integrate their own content studio. I wonder if it could be the same thing for these AI platforms where it's like, hey, give us your data to train ourselves on. Then we can create so much that you become sort of commoditized. Do you think there's a, well, it depends on, I mean, you have to.
00:17:44.644 - 00:17:58.246, Speaker A: Keep the data fresh. And the reason why Reddit is so interesting is because you can continue to have that refresh rate really high with all the different subreddits and the moderators continuing the conversation. That element is important. But if you're talking about a look.
00:17:58.268 - 00:18:00.246, Speaker B: Back, it's like, who wants to buy.
00:18:00.348 - 00:18:12.380, Speaker A: The rights to every single previous news article or publication, blah, blah, blah? But it's not relevant if you're trying to get chat, GPT or Gemini to be up to date with what happened last week.
00:18:12.830 - 00:18:49.670, Speaker B: So what I was thinking about was, I actually remember, do you guys ever watch 30 Rock, the show? That's a silly, stupid reference. But remember Seinfeld Vision, where Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy, because they own so much ip around Seinfeld that they could just get Jerry Seinfeld to say anything that they wanted in every tv show. It was a funny, it was just a funny plot. But actually, here's something pretty cool. I don't know if you guys are Abba fans, but in the UK, in London, right, there's, dude, this exists. You can go. I love ABBa, dude, you can go.
00:18:49.670 - 00:19:18.158, Speaker B: And they are holographic performances of like, you will go and they just projected these four people, and it's like a live concert with ABBA in their prime. And apparently it's awesome. And so I do wonder if there's a need to stay current with sources like Reddit or something like that. But there could be these weird niche use cases where you can do a one off data set and then produce something super valuable like that. But maybe you don't need all of.
00:19:18.164 - 00:19:22.818, Speaker A: This is to say the starting gun has been fired, but we're at the.
00:19:22.824 - 00:19:36.002, Speaker B: Very start of the race. Yeah, maybe that's a good transition. Speaking of starting guns being fired, let's talk a little bit about we crashed up. We crashed up. We crashed up. The market crashed up.
00:19:36.056 - 00:20:06.910, Speaker D: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including salana, Sui, Ethereum, L2s, and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:20:06.910 - 00:20:37.526, Speaker D: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right, guys, on with the show. Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by Swell, a liquid restaking protocol and the issuer of the R suite, liquid restaking token. Now, if you're a listener of Bell Curve, you know that I am just so fascinated by restaking and liquid restaking. I think it is going to be one of the most important trends in Ethereum. And I am really excited for the benefit that it unlocks both users and also Ethereum, the protocol itself. Now, disclaimer, whenever there's yield involved in a product, do your own research.
00:20:37.526 - 00:21:00.842, Speaker D: This is not financial advice. You guys know the drill. But swell is a great team. They have a non custodial product and they are mission driven on giving you the best liquid staking experience. If you take one benefit away from using liquid restaking, make it be capital efficiency. Now, you can earn passive yield from Ethereum, you can earn yield from multiple actively validated services that stack on top of that. And then you can still use rsweep as collateral in Defi.
00:21:00.842 - 00:21:20.646, Speaker D: And because I know y'all are a bunch of dgens, there's a points angle here as well. But in swell we call them pearls. So pearls equal points. And if you stake your eth with swell, you can earn pearls and future Eigen layer rewards. And when there is a token generation event, you can swap your pearls or swell tokens. Head over, click the link at the bottom of this episode. Again, just pause what you're doing right now.
00:21:20.646 - 00:21:24.086, Speaker D: Go click the link at the bottom of this episode. Check out swell. Thank you.
00:21:24.108 - 00:21:24.486, Speaker C: Later.
00:21:24.588 - 00:21:57.134, Speaker D: Hey everyone, want to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, Flood is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because Flood is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season. And this is relevant for both traders and devs. So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to Floodswap and start trading because they solve three massive problems. One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run mev free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price.
00:21:57.134 - 00:22:22.570, Speaker D: So head over to Floodswap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes. We're going to send you right there for the devs out there you can leverage Flood's flexible hooks, allowing you to make swap a first class primitive by adding custom order types like twaps. Or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of that MEP. If you want to reach out to them, go to devs at flood bid or just jump right in the discord. All right, guys, thanks very much.
00:22:22.640 - 00:22:52.306, Speaker B: Appreciate you. Flood, big price action this week. Obviously bitcoin is now trading somewhere around think in the last couple of days, bitcoin is up over 10,000 eth following, Salana following and people are feeling pretty excited. Obviously we're flirting with all time highs. I actually just saw bitcoin is at an all time high in terms of market cap. We have more supply than we did last time. And I guess a question that I would have for you guys is do you think retail is? This is a big question that people within crypto circles like to ask.
00:22:52.306 - 00:23:24.006, Speaker B: Like is retail coming back? There's a great, I'll pull it up actually. But there's a great bot that actually just tracks where Coinbase is in the App Store and they'll tweet out like every 6 hours or something like that where it is and it's been pretty aggressively climbing the ranks. And anecdotally, I haven't had people reach out to me this entire time about crypto, but I'm just starting to get friends and acquaintances, those first early texts. So we'd just be curious about what you guys make of this market action and whether or not retail has sort of returned.
00:23:24.198 - 00:23:43.298, Speaker C: Let me tell you something. You know what the boomers see? They don't even know that the price of bitcoin is like $63,000. All they see is that ibit is making new all time highs every single day. Well, in the world of boomers, bitcoin is $33 apiece. They're already at an all time high.
00:23:43.384 - 00:23:49.620, Speaker A: Like the bull run has already, which is the price of the blackrock. Yeah.
00:23:49.990 - 00:24:11.920, Speaker C: Just to be clear, also, the other thing I'll say is, like every other currency on the planet, bitcoin is now at a new all time high. So the boomers and all these other countries are living in the future. It's like crypto people who haven't broken the all time high in USD yet. So it's funny. It's great to see.
00:24:13.330 - 00:24:33.460, Speaker B: Yeah. And to give everyone a sense of what inflows are these. The volume, I think, actually, yesterday, Eric Balkunis tweeted out that ibit, the know, Blackrock ETF, had more volume than QQQ, which is bananas, which is absolutely.
00:24:35.030 - 00:24:37.650, Speaker C: Of the. That's the most popular Nasdaq ETF.
00:24:37.730 - 00:24:44.658, Speaker B: That's. Yeah, sorry. That's what I should say. Yeah, the Nasdaq ETF, we beat the Nasdaq.
00:24:44.754 - 00:25:16.260, Speaker C: And. And one other thing is there's news that Morgan Stanley and UBs are going to approve these things. And all of the other national prime brokerage accounts and warehouses are still kind of dragging their feet. Like, UBS has a. Or Morgan Stanley has, like, a 90 day product approval thing that apparently has been cut to 45 because people are just fighting and clawing and asking their advisors for this product. So it's like somebody said, 1% to 3% of all assets are going to be in crypto from these ras. It's 150,000,000,000 of money.
00:25:17.430 - 00:25:18.834, Speaker A: How does that work?
00:25:19.032 - 00:26:04.754, Speaker C: How do you put that into crypto? Again, we've said this before, but we've bought nine figures of crypto over the past few years, and it's actually hard to get the coins on a mechanical level. And people are offering us, like, it was 4% to lend out our bitcoin overnight, like, four weeks ago. Now it's up to 15%. And that lending market is driven by. You have the ETF inflows on, call it Thursday, and they can't figure out how to buy coins, or they don't have balance sheets, so they borrow bitcoin, theoretically from us, if we'd let them, and then they'd give it back to us the next day. But it's like a repo market, and it's just like an indication of how tight this market has become. And think of what happens if that 150,000,000,000 is real.
00:26:04.754 - 00:26:21.800, Speaker C: And think of what happens if the ETH ETF happens, which we think it will, at least this year. That's pretty wild to think about. This is the difference between any prior cycle. We never had Larry Fink buying 85,000 bitcoin in the past 20 trading days.
00:26:22.570 - 00:27:01.390, Speaker A: Well, and the other thing too is like that money that goes in, it's a black hole. It doesn't look like it's going to be anything that is flighty, especially given the board of Stanley's, the UBS, when you're talking about getting. And the other one too is fidelity has gone across all of their sort of, like, target allocations. I don't know if you guys saw this chart too. It was like 60 40 stocks is what they've been assessing previously. Now it's like 60 40, whatever it is, 59, 38, three. And the three is crypto, and it's across all of their different platforms.
00:27:01.390 - 00:27:23.660, Speaker A: They have one to 3% allocation. And what I'm meaning with that specifically is if you have one to 3% allocation into those types of funds, that money is going in. But that's a retirement account that's not changing. It's not like they're rebalancing and changing it and all the above. So I think we also have the inflows, but we also have the sedentary nature of what those inflows mean.
00:27:24.430 - 00:28:06.214, Speaker B: So just to give folks a sense, by the way, in terms of order of magnitude, when we say flows, how much are we talking about? Yesterday, it was record flow day for the newborn nine, or the Kintucky Derby, or what James and Eric are calling these new ets. But ibit took in alone 612,000,000. The net for the entire group was 673,000,000, which is a record. And that's despite a pretty big outflow day from GBTC at 216,000,000. So, yeah, these are real dollars coming in here. I've got two questions for you guys about this. Maybe just to add some context for folks in the audience who are listening, we talked about this a little bit before, but there's a bit of a debate going on about where this money is actually coming from.
00:28:06.214 - 00:29:11.114, Speaker B: Is it from hot money hedge funds or these rias? And the other question that I had for you guys is, do you think this is around the time where people say this is all going to go into bitcoin? But I do wonder as well, especially if coins are really scarce, if some of this ends up bleeding over into something like Coinbase, like crypto equities or miners or Ethereum or alts in crypto, like what does the spillover look like? And maybe to just frame that first question up about who's actually investing in or buying these etfs. One thing I did since the last time we talked, I talked to a budy of mine who works at Galaxy, and his take was it actually takes a little while for these wirehouses and everything to get set up. And he actually didn't think it was mostly ras that were buying these for the time being. So I think probably there is a really good argument to be made that it is the hedge fund community, but I don't really know that that really matters very much. The groundwork has been laid at this point on Fidelity and Blackrock and others. I don't think it's just going to take a little while. I just think it's kind of a meaningless question to even be asking, to be honest with you.
00:29:11.152 - 00:29:58.138, Speaker A: Well, it's not meaningless in terms of who's the net buyer right now. I think that that's kind of a relevant question. I just think that that net buyer profile changes in what we're talking about the next 45, 60 days, because I think you're probably right. The people that are buying and have been buying now are basically the people who are front running what they know is impending, which is all the people who are watching this happen and not able to access it. The Morgan Sandalay's, the UBS, the RAA platforms. I think last week Hunter Horsley had a tweet saying that Carlson, which is a $30 billion RAA platform based in Omaha, they just added it to their platform. You're going to have to clip off these tens of billions of dollar ras one at a time, and then they add it to their platform.
00:29:58.138 - 00:30:00.906, Speaker A: They add the allocation waiting and then.
00:30:00.928 - 00:30:01.978, Speaker C: They start to buy in.
00:30:02.064 - 00:30:41.580, Speaker A: And so I think the more liquid, the quicker who are able to buy in now. But the number one thing that we have seen in terms of market psychology is when markets go up, people want to invest. And maybe it's not the smartest people, but it's the people who are more following the markets only because the price action is happening. So price action begets more price action. I think the fastest moving are in right now. The people who are watching on the sidelines are the ones who are going to be buying and holding, and they're coming. And frankly, this price action will pull more of that second category in because they're excited and want to get in as well.
00:30:42.510 - 00:30:43.900, Speaker B: I agree with that.
00:30:44.430 - 00:31:22.146, Speaker C: I mean, Baltunis did this analysis of the individual trades. He's like, there's a bunch that are like one to $10 million tickets. Maybe those are funds, maybe those are high net worth, whatever. There's a bunch that are like, there's a ton that are like $1,000, $5,000. Think it's people like my mom and dad. My dad has been holding ETH since I think 140. Used to hate crypto, and I just got him to buy ETh.
00:31:22.146 - 00:31:56.114, Speaker C: And now that he's up a bunch, he's like really pilled. And now he's like looking at all these products and he's saying, why not? And when you're making daily all time highs, that's a pretty compelling marketing message. So I think it's true what you said. Most of the Ras and warehouses don't have access to this product. That is even crazier to me. What are we going to see in terms of daily net inflows? If we're already at a billion dollars, is it going to be like $10 billion? We're already at a million bitcoin per year pace. There's only 1.9
00:31:56.114 - 00:31:58.450, Speaker C: million BTC across all these exchanges.
00:31:58.790 - 00:31:59.346, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:59.448 - 00:32:03.954, Speaker C: Unless we start rehypothecating coins, there's just not going to be enough to go around.
00:32:04.152 - 00:32:52.178, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so that begs the question. I was just having this debate yesterday with a buddy, but do you think, because this is around the time where, and you're already starting to hear these arguments where bitcoin, this cycle is going to be different, bitcoin is going to outperform everything because it has these etfs, and this argument was made last cycle, too, right? Money printer, go burr meme only applies to bitcoin, and that's where all the liquidity is going to flow. But we all know that bitcoin did really well last cycle, but it underperformed all these other assets. And so I guess what I'm wondering is, especially maybe Vance and Michael, to your guys'point. If bitcoin ends up becoming really scarce, I feel like one thing where I've seen people consistently get this wrong is they're just going to drive that infinitely higher, whereas they look for alternatives. Maybe that's eth, maybe that's coinbase and the miners, maybe that's other things.
00:32:52.178 - 00:33:04.310, Speaker B: But ultimately, that money that wants to speculate ends up pouring out into other assets. And I wanted to get your guys perspective about, do you think that's going to happen similarly this time, or how would you be thinking about that dynamic?
00:33:05.530 - 00:33:45.700, Speaker C: I think the question is between eth and bitcoin. I think broadly, if you have all of these flows, they matter like financial gravity, matters of the buying pressure. There is a wealth effect, like in crypto fund managers. If bitcoin is at, they're looking at l one blockchains at like two or 3 billion, they're going to do that math pretty quickly and rotate. But bitcoin probably goes higher than people think. Like, Fundstrat has a target of year and people are ragging on him for that. But look, something's got to give if they're buying this much crypto at the end of the day.
00:33:45.700 - 00:34:53.100, Speaker C: But I think the real question is ETH. It's a much smaller asset, I guess there's 11 million ETH on exchanges today, so there's even less ETH available than bitcoin. And if you see even a fraction of the inflows from bitcoin, or if there's like a 50 50 ETH bitcoin ETF, or if the ETH ETF is popular, and a lot of Wall street trading houses are already shelling this as their trade. I think that is the question of, do these flows matter five or ten times as much for ETH than they do for bitcoin? Because bitcoin is going to be a lot bigger by the time the ETH ETF gets approved. And so, yeah, I just think all the models are broken, to quote Michael Saylor, like, how high this goes. I mean, Michael and I have recently kind of like, recalibrated just based on the etfs alone. I don't think even the wildest expectation for bitcoin flows, this is beyond that pre ETF versus post ETF, so we'll see.
00:34:53.100 - 00:35:13.150, Speaker C: The other thing about ETH is like, it's all locked up and restaking and staking and defi and nfts and bridges and all this stuff. Bitcoin doesn't really have that, and so there's just a lot less of it. And their flows are probably going to be higher than its prorata share of its market cap relative to bitcoin.
00:35:15.410 - 00:36:10.882, Speaker B: Not sure this really matters either in terms of where bitcoin's price is going to trend. But one thing that I just like a lot about what's happening in bitcoin right now is there's a little bit of a renaissance in terms of building new tech on top of it and being more open minded than I think people have been in a long time. And there is a little bit of an investing angle here, because when you have these things like ordinals and the BITVM, et cetera, you're packing more transactions onto the blockchain that's directly relating to more or translating into more revenue for miners. But just as someone who's really loved bitcoin for a long time, it was kind of frustrating for me to see this pretty religious kind of laser eyed crew really take over the dialogue, and it made me less interested in it for a little while. But it's been cool to see that there's a real resurgence in terms of open mindedness and pushing the boundary in terms of innovation. And yeah, it's happening in a pretty cool way. So not that that really matters for the overall, but I think it's cool at least.
00:36:11.016 - 00:36:42.038, Speaker C: The other thing I'll say is it does feel like the ordinals, people had a moment as the main narrative of bitcoin, but now it's like tradfi. And I think that's kind of interesting. Tradfi is just buying all the coins. It's kind of sad, too, because all the ogs are maybe selling their coins or the coins are maybe just sitting on exchange. But Tradfi is going to take most of this run upwards. If we're starting at. If we started at goes to 250 or whatever, Tradfi is taking most of this run.
00:36:42.224 - 00:37:10.550, Speaker A: So the meta narrative that I think applies to this is not necessarily tradfi being the victor here, but Tradfi changing its tone in terms of the entire industry. And one of the things that happened this week, I know we all saw it was a changing, almost a complete about face of Elizabeth Warren and her talking about how she wants to start working with the industry. So long as everybody follows roles and people don't forget, you wanted to start a crypto army.
00:37:12.650 - 00:37:16.200, Speaker C: She did start a crypto army. It's just wrong side.
00:37:16.730 - 00:37:48.530, Speaker A: But I do think that. Yeah, exactly. Here we go. One of the meta narratives about tradfi winning in this bitcoin gambit right now is that we're going to get them on our side. And I think this is, Mike and I were talking about this before, but this is one of, I think, the trends that is becoming more and more obvious. And frankly, one of the reasons why everyone is getting excited about things like the uniswap. Pswitch.
00:37:48.530 - 00:37:59.558, Speaker A: The trends of regulatory wins for this industry are heading more positively now that we're seeing success within a collaboration between the crypto industry and the tradfi people.
00:37:59.644 - 00:38:30.538, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say just a couple of notes here as well. So I actually have the sort of fortunate or unfortunate experience. I've been hosting podcasts for a long time and actually started the first podcast I was hosting on the margin in March of 2021. So all of my views are, like, on the record at that time. And I will say a lot of those views do not hold up particularly well with what ended up playing out that cycle. So this is a time to have fun. It really doesn't get better than this particular span of time before it gets totally ludicrous.
00:38:30.538 - 00:38:51.000, Speaker B: We're winning. All this stuff is trending in the right direction. But also, I don't know, just because last time I lost my head a little bit. Keep your head on the swivel, right. Nothing has changed too much. I heard you like a little bit of word. Yeah, I had some dumb takes.
00:38:51.690 - 00:38:52.530, Speaker A: Honestly.
00:38:52.690 - 00:38:53.382, Speaker C: So did we.
00:38:53.436 - 00:38:57.014, Speaker B: Yeah, we all do, right? I mean, it's part of the fun. It's part of the fun of going through this.
00:38:57.052 - 00:38:59.320, Speaker C: Gaming was going to happen in 2022.
00:39:00.090 - 00:39:12.570, Speaker B: But you guys were just a little bit early on that. I mean, that feels like we were talking about AI is kind of the next narrative. I don't know. I feel like gaming is. We have Robbie on gotten much more bullish since that episode.
00:39:12.730 - 00:39:15.662, Speaker A: Do we have another hour to talk about gaming? Because I do.
00:39:15.796 - 00:39:41.814, Speaker B: I know. Yeah, he is a killer. And I think gaming is going to be huge this year. But to just call out, like, Warren here, we're looking at this article, and it's just funny that she says this. I want to collaborate with the industry. What I don't understand is why the industry seems to be saying that the only way they can survive is there's plenty of space for drug traffickers and human traffickers, own terrorists and ransmire scammers. She doesn't want to collaborate with this.
00:39:41.814 - 00:39:50.454, Speaker B: Literally, it was the title you guys were referring to. I'm building an anti crypto army. How does that say collaboration? That doesn't say is.
00:39:50.492 - 00:39:58.374, Speaker A: This is the equivalent of Gary Antser being like, come in and register. We're open for business. We saw how that worked. Yeah, it's frustrating.
00:39:58.502 - 00:40:19.060, Speaker C: It's so weird that we don't like her, given that she just tried to kill our industry for the past four years. It's like, I know, look, we've gotten approximately zero bones thrown to us by the party. Like, this shouldn't be a mystery as to why we don't want to work with you. All of the rules that you've put forward are not.
00:40:20.950 - 00:40:52.634, Speaker B: Come. I grew up in Massachusetts. I like Warren. Like, there was a period of time where I really liked her, and I thought she had a really rational, like, she did a good job then. She did a good job in Massachusetts before all this. And now, yeah, I'm just totally flipped on. You know, I was sitting next to, I don't want to blow this spot up, but a guy from Coinbase on the flight over here, and he was describing interacting with regulators and, well, actually, I don't know if I want to get into the story, but basically these people do have a really good understanding of the technologies they're regulating.
00:40:52.634 - 00:40:59.520, Speaker B: But there are really. I'm not sure our interests are fully aligned. I think they will be in the long mark of.
00:41:01.570 - 00:41:02.078, Speaker C: Mean.
00:41:02.164 - 00:41:35.260, Speaker A: Listen, from the way that the democratic party, or frankly, like any government official, purports itself to be wanting fair markets, to have open transparency, egalitarian ecosystem, like, all the things that are literally the tech and ecosystems that we're building should be represented by what they're talking about. It's just that there are ulterior motives at play, and they put up a good facade to be able to win elections. But in reality, there's stuff that's deeper that's going on.
00:41:36.670 - 00:42:09.430, Speaker C: I do feel like it's shifting, though, with the Fed coming out positive on stablecoins. It's also an election year, and I think this bleeds into crypto where it's like, look, crypto is popular no matter what you think. A lot of people own it, 70, 80 million Americans. It feels like a lot of the pace of the enforcements and the court cases have slowed. At least that's kind of my perspective. The bitcoin ETF obviously step in the right direction. But if crypto keeps ripping, I think it's really hard to be.
00:42:09.430 - 00:42:39.134, Speaker C: It's easy to be bearish or crack the whip regulatorily wise on an asset class that's like fucking imploding. People forget. But 2021, they were kind of positive on the space 2022 when we blew everything up. They were like, all right, let's go after these people. But now it feels like we're kind of in up only mode. And I don't know how much room politically there is to be trying to reign on that parade. Basically, that's my thought process at least.
00:42:39.134 - 00:42:53.460, Speaker C: And I think that will influence things like the ETHF decision, not the Coinbase court case, because that's like in the court of law. But there's a lot of levers that this type of positive price action and environment can.
00:42:56.790 - 00:42:57.106, Speaker A: Think.
00:42:57.128 - 00:43:25.494, Speaker B: It's a. I think Matt Levine actually wrote a really great article about this. But you can think about it from the perspective of a regulatory agency. There's sometimes demand for them to do their job. Like when coins are going down and everyone feels like they lost a lot of money, they know they've got public opinion on their side, so they're going to do everything they can to get that through. But when prices are going up and everyone's making money, there's just not much political appetite out there to crack down on an asset that people are liking and holding. So I agree with you, man.
00:43:25.494 - 00:43:26.990, Speaker B: I think it's a good perspective.
00:43:28.130 - 00:43:32.720, Speaker A: It's so much fun thinking about how much coke Ben Mackenzie and Jim Bianco have. Right?
00:43:36.470 - 00:43:40.130, Speaker B: Know I like Jim a lot, and he's been constructive on this space for a while.
00:43:40.200 - 00:43:50.920, Speaker C: He's twisted himself into an intellectual pretzel like, bro, stop, stop. Stop shooting. They're not going in.
00:43:51.610 - 00:43:52.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:52.332 - 00:43:55.218, Speaker B: Did you see Citron?
00:43:55.394 - 00:43:56.694, Speaker A: Yeah, Citron research.
00:43:56.812 - 00:43:57.574, Speaker C: These people.
00:43:57.692 - 00:43:59.858, Speaker A: Short coin, long BTC.
00:44:00.034 - 00:44:00.470, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:00.540 - 00:44:42.770, Speaker C: Talking about, yeah, this is the best tradfi will see an asset class like crypto ripping, and they'll do things like short tether and pay funding to do that. Maybe just sharing what I did this week. So I was at this pension fund conference, two day pension fund conference in Austin, and a really great conference put on by great people. They have like a crypto specific one that they do kind of like once a year, and it's well attended. But this one was the overall, there's like private credit, there's long only. There's long short. There's energy, there's real estate, there's all the asset classes, and then there's crypto.
00:44:42.770 - 00:45:11.630, Speaker C: And me and Haseeb did a panel at 830 in the morning. We got a half hour. Everyone's like drinking coffee and eating danishes. It was well attended, but the crypto people only got a half hour. And this is like a two day thing. And a lot of the younger people who work at these pension funds, and the more tech savvy ones had meetings with them. They're super receptive to it, but the vast majority are extremely skeptical.
00:45:11.630 - 00:45:45.626, Speaker C: And we did like a show of hands in the audience, like, who has exposure via crypto fund or owns crypto on the balance sheet of the pension fund or whatever, maybe 10%. Maybe those people will have to chase at some point as well. Because if you miss the birth of a new asset class and you're like a strategic, you've got scholarships that you need to pay for and people's fucking pensions that need to be paying. If you miss a new asset class, I think you're probably going to get.
00:45:45.648 - 00:45:46.906, Speaker A: Fired at some point.
00:45:47.088 - 00:45:54.160, Speaker C: And so it's starting to come around. But these people are not like, they don't even know what the price of bitcoin is, basically.
00:45:54.930 - 00:46:46.906, Speaker A: I think that it's dual wielding what you're kind of talking about, Vance, which is both on the LP perspective as well as the GP perspective. If you are a crypto GP and you're under allocated to liquid crypto over the last six months, it's going to be a really tough ride. And if you're an LP and your job is to find new emerging alternative managers and new asset classes to your points, it's going to be a really tough ride. And you have no crypto, it's going to be a really tough ride. We've talked to a number of them, but there are a number of major endowments, foundations, institutions that most people would know the names of who have actively said, listen, we're going to wait one or two fund cycles to be able to see how this industry matures. Oops, we missed 2021, but good. We missed FTX.
00:46:46.906 - 00:46:58.242, Speaker A: That's great. And now they're coming back in. So there are people who are reengaging at a very high level, and I think broadly, the smartest ones are the ones that are going to be the first to do so.
00:46:58.376 - 00:47:00.654, Speaker B: But that's kind of the other signal.
00:47:00.702 - 00:47:23.466, Speaker A: That I think we've been picking up as well, which is the excitement around smart lps. Investing in smart managers is back. And we're kind of at that point where it used to be like, going to have to stick my neck out at our ICA to be able to invest in this crypto manager. Now it's more like, if we miss crypto again, we're going to be in trouble. You know what?
00:47:23.488 - 00:47:51.826, Speaker B: I think maybe just have a little bit of a contrarian opinion. It's actually good that lps take the time to build conviction in this, because the worst thing you can do. How many times have you guys seen this from retail or professional investors alike? You wait, you don't buy during the bear, it breaks out on the all time high. You finally are like, all right, I'm just going to close my eyes and buy. And you don't build any conviction. And then you buy the all time high and just sell it as soon as it dips. I mean, how many times have you guys seen that play out?
00:47:51.928 - 00:47:53.026, Speaker C: So many times.
00:47:53.208 - 00:47:54.260, Speaker A: All the time.
00:47:55.270 - 00:48:00.354, Speaker C: They buy EtH at 4000, then it goes to 1000 and they can't get approval for their IC to back up the truck.
00:48:00.482 - 00:48:01.160, Speaker B: Right?
00:48:01.690 - 00:48:07.240, Speaker C: And they're just sitting there with that ETh. It's like you got to help yourself.
00:48:08.010 - 00:48:36.558, Speaker A: And equivalently, on the LP side, for all these managers, foundations and Dallas, et cetera, who missed funds one, two and three, potentially for these different firms, it's going to be hard for them to get allocation to fund four. That's the other sentiment, too. I mean, if you're not in already, you're going to have to build relationships and hope that you can get in in a size that matters for you. There is a risk on the LP side for missing out on these ups.
00:48:36.574 - 00:48:38.046, Speaker B: And downs as well, because you haven't.
00:48:38.078 - 00:48:42.638, Speaker A: Built relationships with managers that are going to perform totally.
00:48:42.734 - 00:48:49.700, Speaker B: And it's not a massive world of super sophisticated managers in crypto. You guys know that better than most?
00:48:50.390 - 00:48:52.230, Speaker A: No, there's less than a handful.
00:48:53.050 - 00:49:43.590, Speaker C: But what is good is that most of the fund managers that are good are kind of on their fourth funds now. And so you have track record and you can tell that they have their reputations intact and they didn't do anything sketchy with internal politics or dynamics or there's all these things that just over time, you can get a read on. And even two years ago, remember all the crypto funds that launched two years ago? Hundreds. How do you decide between those? But now it's kind of starting to shake out where just like traditional hedge funds and ventures, you have kind of like the five or ten name brands that are somewhere between a safe pair of hands, but also extraordinarily risk on and crypto savvy.
00:49:44.490 - 00:50:15.178, Speaker B: Yeah, well, there will be some new fund managers who make their career on this cycle. There'll be some people who lose their head and blow up all the same fun stuff that happened last time. I'm sure we'll get another dosage of. But yeah, I guess, especially if you've made it just, I had this conversation with a budy of mine who he literally started at a protocol that you guys would know the name of two years ago, right during the absolute peak. And I've been talking to him recently. He's like, I'm not sure. Feels like we're treading.
00:50:15.178 - 00:50:27.362, Speaker B: Go inside. And I was like, buddy, just stick it out. And I saw him here yesterday, and we were both like, let's go. And it was just a great brother. Let's go. Yeah. So it's just nice.
00:50:27.362 - 00:50:31.478, Speaker B: And so if that also applies to you, congratulations. This is definitely the fun part.
00:50:31.644 - 00:50:32.514, Speaker C: Pretty rich.
00:50:32.642 - 00:50:36.902, Speaker B: Pre rich, baby. All right, fellas, I got to run, but this was a fun one.
00:50:37.036 - 00:50:37.718, Speaker A: Later.
00:50:37.884 - 00:50:38.418, Speaker B: Cheers.
00:50:38.514 - 00:51:00.222, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we are incredibly excited to have teamed up with the War Hole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:51:00.222 - 00:51:03.050, Speaker D: Click the link at the bottom of this episode. Take you get your free nft.
