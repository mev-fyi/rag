Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.730 - 00:00:37.570, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another Bell Curve roundup. You got the four ombre's back today. You got Vance and Yano. We missed you guys last couple of weeks. And Michael's, one and two, welcome back, guys.
00:00:37.740 - 00:00:40.838, Speaker A: Can't say I missed you guys. I wasn't thinking too much about Belkirk.
00:00:40.854 - 00:00:45.770, Speaker C: I'll be honest, but good to the absolute closet.
00:00:48.270 - 00:00:50.800, Speaker B: Like Harry Potter coming to us.
00:00:53.650 - 00:00:54.602, Speaker C: It's not lighting.
00:00:54.666 - 00:00:56.682, Speaker B: Jeez copper under the stairs.
00:00:56.746 - 00:00:58.986, Speaker A: Yeah, truly.
00:00:59.018 - 00:01:03.118, Speaker B: Whole new view. We don't have the nice studio lighting for your message.
00:01:03.204 - 00:01:05.646, Speaker A: Definitely watch on Spotify and Apple, not on YouTube.
00:01:05.758 - 00:01:10.660, Speaker C: Yeah, Jack Farley needed the big boy room. We're giving up a little piece of that.
00:01:11.910 - 00:01:13.278, Speaker B: The little kids table.
00:01:13.374 - 00:01:14.510, Speaker A: Yeah, truly.
00:01:14.670 - 00:02:00.302, Speaker B: All right, you guys want to get into it? I think it makes sense to start with the uni fee switch. So for the last couple of weeks, there's been, I think it's the second or maybe even third attempt to turn on the fee switch for uniswap. This was a proposal that was put forth by Getty Hill over at GFX Labs. It had pretty broad based support. The broad strokes of the proposal were that there was essentially going to be a test deployment on univ, three on polygon. So I think when the proposal was written, it's about $50 million of volume or something like that on a daily basis. But yeah, so basically it was basically sort of like a lower stakes test on polygon, and the proposal failed, unfortunately, by a relatively slim margin.
00:02:00.302 - 00:02:08.630, Speaker B: So, just curious what you guys think, if you're surprised about the result of the vote and just your high level thoughts.
00:02:09.690 - 00:02:18.360, Speaker C: I'm surprised we're this close. Honestly. It feels like they're getting closer over time. I'm just looking at the comments on.
00:02:21.870 - 00:03:05.174, Speaker A: The whole vote, I think was structured incorrectly because if you actually look at the vote, the uni fee switch is going to fail, or did fail, even though there are more votes in favor of adding a fee than not adding a fee. So if you look at it, the no fee had 18 million uni. The one fifth had 17 million and 110 had 5 million. And then one six had 16K. So there was really 22 million in favor of turning on which 18 million didn't want to turn on the fee. So there should have been two separate polls here. There should have been a yes or no fee switch, and then if it said yes for the fee switch, it should have been how big should the fee switch be? So I actually think the whole vote was set up incorrectly would be my feedback here.
00:03:05.212 - 00:03:28.142, Speaker D: Yeah. And just to add to that, they said there's going to be three polls. The first one is the fee options for V three, and then the second poll is the initial deployment chain and then the third poll is asset to be held in treasury. But Yano, to your point, the first poll, and there should have been four, was whether or not to go forward with this. And that's what they should have been voting on here.
00:03:28.276 - 00:03:45.010, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really telling. I think fee switch is getting closer. This is now what? This is a failure each time Uni fee switch is coming and I think it's just like this is the most progress they've had towards the fee switch.
00:03:45.590 - 00:04:12.906, Speaker C: One of the bad takes I see is like if your protocol doesn't have fees turned on right now, it's never going to turn on fees. I just think that's a bad take. This has got every single vote. The snapshot process is robust, there's the ability to revote. It seems like the consensus is building, I think about Uniswap on the path to this vswitch. And then what they will do with it. Not like whether this is going to happen at all.
00:04:12.906 - 00:04:16.080, Speaker C: That feels not the right thing to focus on.
00:04:18.610 - 00:05:13.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the reasons why, if I had to speculate this is getting held back is I think the individual delegates at Uniswap are worried about personal liability. So one of the benefits of something like an LLC or a C Corp is sort of this liability protection in between management at the company and the actions that the company takes. Right. So you can't be personally sued. And there was a decision, I think at a court with LBRY, whatever the name of that Dow was, which implicated that actually that limited liability protection that you get in corporate America doesn't necessarily extend to DAOs and there can be personal liability. So you're more treated as like a general partner. And I think what delegates are worried about is if a fee switch is turned on, then you need the token ends up looking a lot more security like than it does today.
00:05:13.198 - 00:05:17.780, Speaker B: If you have fees that are being streamed to a Dow and then distributed in some.
00:05:19.510 - 00:06:03.870, Speaker D: To just to be careful with that, that hasn't been decided yet. That is still in process. But the argument is that instead of it being an LLC or C Corp like where, you know, LLC literally stands for limited Liability company or corporation. So that's the entire premise and structure of that legal entity in the United States. The argument that is put forth is that in fact, these Dows are more like unincorporated partnerships which don't incur the limited liability protections that you would have with these other legal entity structures. So it's not a said and done case and that decision isn't official but it is something that people are tracking because it is a pretty robust change to how you would think about participating in Dows.
00:06:05.330 - 00:06:54.850, Speaker C: Also not a general rule, depends on where you're based, depends on what type of product you've built. There's not a notion of security or non security in very many countries. The existence of a Dow or a legal entity is different in very many countries as it relates to liability. So I think this is like you should kind of view this as a startup working in the most punitive jurisdiction in the most probably punitive potential asset, I guess type of startup that's swapping assets and doing know. I think it's pretty interesting and bullish and optimistic that they're going down this path despite all of that. And there's places like Texas which have dao as a legal entity protections that have the ability to hopefully facilitate this stuff. But I think this is pretty optimistic in my opinion.
00:06:56.870 - 00:07:09.480, Speaker B: Let's say you lay aside legal concerns. Do you guys think that this is the right time to turn on the fee switch for Uniswap and what would be sort of your pro and con case for why? Why not?
00:07:10.570 - 00:08:09.990, Speaker D: So what I would say is it really depends on what the intention is for what you do with the fees that are generated because what you're effectively doing is you're trading off protocol treasury fees which you kind of have a couple of options to do with once they're collected. But you've got the treasury that would be assuming some fee collection and that's taking away from LPs and that kind of give and take is really kind of the question here. Meanwhile, you've got what seems to be the bulk of the Uniswap Labs team has moved into a direction of building, as we talked about in this podcast a couple of times, moving in the direction of building a centralized wallet and service on top of the Uniswap protocol. And maybe there's going to be a fee element there as well. So I think you can't just look at this as a binary yes or no. It really has to do with what is the use of the fees once they're collected or is this going to be the only fee that's incurred within the entire value flow of Uniswap?
00:08:10.650 - 00:09:02.074, Speaker C: Yep, I mean, it depends what you do with the fees. To Michael's point, I don't think the Dow is just meant to accrue fees and hold on to them forever. These things are not meant to be banks, these things are not meant to be capital allocators in my opinion, that doesn't make any sense. So you should either have a plan to reinvest it in the growth of the protocol immediately, hopefully in a programmatic way, or distribute it to token holders. I think it's also balancing this idea that Uniswap is finished with the reality that there's probably better, more sophisticated models of trading coming to the market and so do you eventually need those fees to fight off a challenger? Probably. But I also don't think you should just accrue them indefinitely to the Dow and risk your position potentially winning the LPs that are facilitating this trading. So you have to balance a lot of different things.
00:09:02.074 - 00:09:06.220, Speaker C: But ultimately it's really not up to them. It's up to the entirety of people who hold this.
00:09:07.390 - 00:10:00.506, Speaker A: Uh, I would say that Uniswap should turn on the fee switch eventually, but I'd be pretty hardcore against turning on the fee switch right now. One is I guess it's like, why would you turn on the fee switch right now? Think about turning on the fee switch in a bull market. That is a huge token catalyst that you are just like wasting that big opportunity in the bear markets. That's one reason. The second is you're turning on a fee switch at the most risky time in the history of crypto regulation. And I think the legal and tax implications of turning on the fee switch right now are massive and it's like, why take that risk? And then yeah, like Michael and Vance were, I i think the Dow has not been a super great allocator of capital in the past. And so it's like why maybe they need to show a little bit that they can allocate capital better before turning that on.
00:10:00.688 - 00:10:23.490, Speaker B: All right, hold on. I would push back on. Sorry, both of those actually. First of all, the legal and regulatory stuff, absolutely. But one of the advantages of a bear market is that you have cover, right? The stakes feel much higher when it's a bull market and everything is growing super fast and competition feels really fierce. This is the period of time that you have to experiment. Like if you don't take risks now, you're not going to do it during the bull market.
00:10:23.490 - 00:10:39.320, Speaker B: So I kind of think you're just blowing it. And as this whole Dows can't allocate capital, they've clearly done it pretty well so far. Capital was allocated. We got uniswap. Then we got v two then we got v three. It's the leader in the market.
00:10:40.890 - 00:10:45.590, Speaker D: That wasn't the uniswap foundation. That wasn't the uniswap treasury. That was uniswap labs.
00:10:46.650 - 00:10:47.254, Speaker B: True.
00:10:47.372 - 00:11:03.626, Speaker D: Very different. They're very different entities where you've got different governance structures, you've got different equity holders versus token holders. There is a pretty large difference between what I would assume is the Uniswap Foundation I don't know the full name. Versus uniswap. Labs incorporated.
00:11:03.818 - 00:11:05.566, Speaker B: Okay, so but then play that out.
00:11:05.588 - 00:11:05.726, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:05.748 - 00:11:24.502, Speaker B: So we've got these great primitives in crypto. They were for the most part created by operating companies, by Labs teams. So is the idea now that innovation is just going to stop and the primitives that we have exist because we have Labs teams that built them and then Dows are just going to return money from this point on? Or what's the sort of way forward.
00:11:24.556 - 00:12:01.054, Speaker C: Path from here it's a good question. I think you have to assume that Uniswap Labs will be incentivized to build. In my mind, Uniswap Labs has built the wallet but their monetization and the big outcome is still tied to the token, which is tied to the AMM. And so their incentives are to keep that competitive. What I do agree with is you should figure out these things before they become huge problems. Because there's always this scenario where either there is a dow with a bunch of money or there is the potential for a dow to get a bunch of money. And when the stakes get high, you're just, like fighting over these magical Internet coins, and it just gets really contentious.
00:12:01.054 - 00:12:30.300, Speaker C: And it's generally better to do everything before it becomes a big problem or the stakes are too high. So I like that idea. I don't know if the Uniswap Dao is ever built to allocate capital and the times they have done in the past, the DeFi legal fund I think was a good idea. But there aren't too many one offs like that where you can just give someone a huge pile of money and it was actually effective. I think it's always better to just go back to the stakeholders of the Dao itself.
00:12:30.910 - 00:12:38.160, Speaker A: So Mike, you would turn it on now for one pool, test it out Dabble, see how it goes. You would do it for all of.
00:12:39.330 - 00:13:21.370, Speaker B: I think, to be honest, I think what's tricky about this is if I was in the position of being a large stakeholder in Uniswap, then it would be very hard for me to press the button because, yeah, I would be very worried about my own personal liability. And I just think it's the most fair thing in the world to say. And we could all sit here and say, yeah, I would totally do that. But like I've said before, I like living in the United States and I honestly don't want to leave. But that said, I do think this is the time to push experimentation. And Miles, who's been on this podcast a bunch, wrote a pretty good piece at Reverie about Know. If you think about these Dows as software marketplaces, you have a demand side and a supply side.
00:13:21.370 - 00:13:46.520, Speaker B: The LPs are the supply side of Uniswap. I would love to see which DAOs actually have pricing power over their supply side. I think that's a pretty good indicator if you have a commodity business or a business that actually has a moat. So from the standpoint of a pretty interested observer, I would love it if these experiments got run. Now, frankly, I'd just be interested to see what happened.
00:13:48.330 - 00:14:17.854, Speaker C: I like that. I remember when Uniswap segregated out the pools like 30 basis points. Ten basis points. I think that was V two. That certainly opened the aperture of pricing power and how much leverage you actually have over TVL in your protocol and what you can charge people before they leave. I think frankly, AMMS are this strangely captive market with a lot of stale liquidity where the LPs are the ultimate end consumer and they seem to be pretty price insensitive. They get run over sometimes.
00:14:17.854 - 00:14:33.218, Speaker C: They get different things done to them when their positions are out of range. I don't really know how to think about the uniswap LP set. It doesn't feel like the most professional traders. That would be my guess. They would be less sensitive to pricing in my mind.
00:14:33.384 - 00:14:42.038, Speaker B: Do you have an understanding of the pareto of univ three LPs? Like how dispersed it is and who those entities are?
00:14:42.204 - 00:15:17.854, Speaker C: My sense is there's a bunch of latent liquidity that's just kind of sitting there, but there's also a lot of people who are doing like just in time mev to these separate pools. A lot of the flow is rebalancing flow, so prices move on centralized exchanges and people rebalance. I would say that's probably most of the flow. And we've done some analysis and I think I forget what it was, but like 30 or 40% or maybe a little bit less than that comes from the uniswap front end and the rest is all programmatic trading. So like, people who are not clicking.
00:15:17.902 - 00:15:22.990, Speaker D: Buy or Sell yeah, that data might be outdated.
00:15:23.150 - 00:15:26.530, Speaker C: Yeah, that data is very outdated. It's probably a year outdated.
00:15:28.310 - 00:15:53.920, Speaker B: The sense that I get is that it's actually quite concentrated and that there was a thread that got put together on Twitter about this. I'll see if I can go back and find it. But I think it's about like ten entities that provide liquidity for the majority. There's definitely like an 80 20 rule in effect with liquidity provision on univ three. I'd just be very curious to see what their motivation is for doing that.
00:15:54.450 - 00:16:15.970, Speaker C: The univ three customer set very different than the univ two customer set. Univ two is kind of what I think of when I think of DFI. Like a lot of people just throwing in cat like pool twos, like initial bootstrapping pools for tokens, things like that. V three is more of like the latent liquidity that's just sitting there and then the ten pros that are doing just in time liquidity provisioning.
00:16:16.310 - 00:16:20.786, Speaker A: Not because people realize that it's very hard to make money on univ three.
00:16:20.968 - 00:16:23.494, Speaker C: I mean, we couldn't do it.
00:16:23.612 - 00:16:24.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:24.730 - 00:16:40.220, Speaker C: And we worked at it for a long time. Univ two is very profitable just because easier to make money on univ three is. Yeah, I mean, you need a very low latency, very just high reliability system to trade that.
00:16:41.230 - 00:17:16.200, Speaker D: To be clear, you can make money, you just have to have a strategy that incorporates an element that's off of univ three. And this could be on chain centralized hedging. This could be using that to farm assets. This could be, like France is saying, a low latency system that was auto hedging over time or potentially participating in any arbitrage between centralized and decentralized exchanges. There's a lot of ways of making money. It's just if you're only going to be an LP in Uni V Three, it's very difficult, if not impossible to have a net positive effect.
00:17:16.810 - 00:17:35.840, Speaker C: Our style of on chain stuff is more doing using very simple D Five primitives at scale to do ideas that we're high conviction on. It's not like, let's go, do mev just in time. Liquidity provisioning on UDB three. It's like maker vaults and large scale staking and things like that.
00:17:36.210 - 00:18:37.442, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe this would be just to return to that question they were sort of asking like when is a project in crypto done? And one of the things that I struggle with a little bit when it comes to something like uniswap is for some of these dows, it feels like the dow structure of it flies directly in the face of the value proposition of the product in that. Hey, we probably could make a better product here if we just had a company that was shipping updates. Here where I maybe want to transition to Lido here. Lido is actually a very interesting project in DeFi for me in the sense that the decentralization of it actually is a direct value proposition of Lido. And the more decentralized and dao like it is and the more they limit the surface area of what they do, the more valuable the product is. So we can get into why that is. I think it's sort of unique actually in that sense.
00:18:37.442 - 00:19:13.790, Speaker B: But before we get into that, I would love to get your takes. Vance, I saw you had sort of a spicy tweet about this, but basically the idea that people are getting worried about Lido again and it has an enormous amount of I think it has more TVL than any other D Five protocol. This standpoint, I think it's almost twice actually what maker is over 12 billion of TVL, something like that. And it's just very close to the metal of how ethereum works and there's a lot of stake that's locked up there. Vance, you said that people are maybe a little bit worrying unnecessarily about this. What are your sort of thoughts on Lido?
00:19:14.130 - 00:20:05.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, what Lido is basically serving to people is a validator set. And right now the discussion is, is that validator set decentralized enough or not? And the reality is basically everything at the moment is permissioned validator sets, if it's fracs, if it's rocket pool, if it's Coinbase staking, if it's Lido, then the discussion is basically how do you broaden that? And this is something that Lido acknowledges, this is something that they know. This is basically the entire roadmap. And what it's being developed towards is basically in the future, probably Q Four or Q One. And this is enabled by what they just shipped in Lido V Two, which is called Distributed Validator Technology. You'll go from the 40 50 lido validators that are validating today to clustering validators. So what I mean by that is you're going to have one institutional node operator paired with a bunch of self stakers that can permissionlessly just use lido as middleware to go off and stake their ETH.
00:20:05.914 - 00:20:53.498, Speaker C: And so by doing this, you allow the smaller people to get in and validate. But you also have the backstop of if something, god forbid were to happen, you can rely on that institutional node operator to be validating correctly and effectively save that cluster. And so the answer to all of these concerns is we need to do a better job of decentralizing lido. But that's kind of already on the roadmap and I just see that as still probably not being acceptable to other staking protocols. Certain ethereum influencers that lido in providing this middleware service would still potentially have leverage over ethereum. I just don't think that's the right way to think about this. I think the right way to think about this is lido is providing something that is critical infrastructure to the protocol.
00:20:53.498 - 00:21:59.250, Speaker C: It's far better and far more aligned than miners ever were and it's moving on a path towards not only decentralizing the validation process with DVT and having solo stakers, but you're also going to transition the governance to be steth based as well. And what I mean by that is right now lido LDO is the token that effectively validates everything in the future. You're going to have Steeth have a second order governance perspective over the protocol. And if there's a vote that's contentious, if there's something that they want to block, Steeth holders will literally be able to go off and block a vote. And so what does that mean from a governance perspective? Well, it means that the 7th largest asset in crypto Steeth is now going to have governance over the underlying protocol of lido, which is very aligned with Ethereum. If you have, I think it's like 13 or 14 billion of TVL locked in the protocol today. How can you say that if all of those people have a say over at the governance of the protocol and validating is permissionless that that's not aligned with ethereum? I just really don't understand that perspective.
00:22:01.350 - 00:22:57.080, Speaker B: Yeah, it might be worth doing a little bit of a history lesson as well for just why lido exists. There was initially a decision to not do something like delegated proof of stake. Right. The Ethereum foundation basically took this stance that what they actually didn't want was people delegating their stake to a limited set of validators that would therefore have outsized control over the protocol. Kind of just shows you that sometimes market forces will just take over despite whatever mechanisms you try to put in place. But the worry after that decision was made was that the centralized exchanges would become they would allow people, their customers to stake, they would stake on their behalf and therefore the Coinbases and the krakens and the Binances of the world would effectively control ethereum. So Lido is actually created to obviate some of that control.
00:23:00.730 - 00:24:40.520, Speaker D: There's a bit more nuance to that in that the limitation specifically was that a node operator would have to have 32 e on the node to be able to operate and start validating the blockchain as opposed to the delegated model where you could have basically these sync of assets where it would be like the coinbase node or a subset of coinbase nodes that would be able to assume massive amounts of ethereum and that would be a centralization risk. And so the fact that you put in this 32 e limit meant that you had basically two options, and then Lido became a third. The two options were to self stake where you would be operating your own node, running your own infrastructure simultaneously to the Lido conversations on Twitter. I've read a number of threads this week around how self staking is still an exceedingly difficult thing to do, which is why you see a lot of attraction from centralized Staking or LSDs. And then the other one was the Beacon Chain, launched in November, December 2020, and until April of this year, two and a half years later, you had no liquidity on the assets that you chose to put up for that staking process over two and a half years. And so that's where the advent of LSDs came about, because you wanted to be able to stake and earn and validate the blockchain, but you also wanted to be able to have potential for liquidity in the form of a receipt token like Steve. So I think there's a couple of elements to it, but Lido coincidentally took off in that two and a half year period when self staking or centralized staking were the only options.
00:24:40.520 - 00:24:46.550, Speaker D: And I think it has to do with liquidity just as much as moving away from delegated proof of stake.
00:24:47.610 - 00:25:15.600, Speaker B: Yeah, you might be absolutely right. Could you actually either you or Vance, could you explain why there are generally when you ask people about the projected market structure of something like LSTs, if not win or take all, it's certainly winner take. Most or most people don't think it's going to become a fragmented marketplace. Can you just explain some of the returns to scale that you get as an issuer of a liquid staking derivative or liquid staking token? Yes.
00:25:19.110 - 00:25:37.590, Speaker C: It'S kind of like path dependent in terms of how we got here. But Michael's description was right. Everyone wanted liquidity for staking. ETH Lido was the first one to provide that at scale. It partnered that with a smart token incentive program and curve to keep it at peg. Sometimes it fell off, sometimes it was stable. They just accrued a lot of rewards.
00:25:37.590 - 00:26:11.826, Speaker C: As I mentioned, the product they are serving to people is the validators. People will use the Steeth, but that's a tokenized representation of a validator effectively and they managed to get a bunch of very effective validators and just basically have a lot more individual nodes than anybody else. And so what that means is you get a higher share of the lumpier mev style fees when they happen and so that boosts their Apr. They're also the lowest fee protocol. They're at 10%. Rocket pool is at 15. Coinbase ETH is at 25, believe it or not.
00:26:11.826 - 00:26:41.066, Speaker C: So there's a lot of different things that they did. Well DFI integrations and the Dow is just well run too. We know a lot of the people there, we trust a lot of them. They're good people that's kind of hard to find in crypto. So they did a bunch of things right, basically. I will say, just on a different note, liquid staking is not actually an idea that originated within Ethereum, it originated within Cosmos. And this probably shows how dated this learnings are.
00:26:41.066 - 00:27:14.082, Speaker C: But this was invented by Zackie and a lot of kind of the Cosmos folks at that time. Ethereum was very anti proof of stake, anti liquid staking in a different context for a long time and eventually got convinced. So it's not surprising to see that this has been contentious in terms of ethereum was a protocol designed to basically have no partners, everything would be internalized. And I think along the way there's two things that kind of got out of the ethereum foundation that they wish they would have internalized. One is flashbots. That would be one that I would say they probably would like to figure out a way to enshrine mev a little bit more effectively into the protocol they're doing. Proposer builder separation.
00:27:14.082 - 00:27:49.634, Speaker C: Things are like after the fact efforts to change that. And I think Lido and liquid staking as a whole is probably another how would you set up self staking and these other things in a way that would be more effective for ethereum holders, people who want to stake ethereum, but it didn't happen that way. And I think a lot of the narratives around Lido being too concentrated are a little bit of the result of people just wanting to kind of wind back the clock and do it differently. But that's just not how the market played out. I wish everyone was just had a solar generator in a box of granola and just self staked all over their ETH in the woods somewhere, but that's just not how this played out.
00:27:49.832 - 00:28:52.722, Speaker D: Well, just to further the point, the flip side and the second largest staker, if not the largest, I think from a total percentage of stake is Coinbase. And the way that coinbase works is you put your ETH into a staking address or staking vault and you have to have increments of 32 E. And the only difference between delegated proof of stake and what they're doing is effectively their software, their system separates out each validator into 32 ETH and then. They manage the keys, they manage the controls, and they distribute your ETH in 32 ETH increments to your collective staking vault staking address. And that's how the staking process works with Coinbase. And so it's still a very centralized process on the flip side, and you're putting a lot of trust in the software and systems of Coinbase, which is something that we trust as well. But there is a better solution to that, I would say, which is liquid staking.
00:28:52.722 - 00:29:16.618, Speaker D: And we can debate the relative market share of lido versus others. And I do actually think it's not going to be a winner take all market. I think there's going to be different flavors of staking that have different token models, different kind of growth strategies and therefore use cases. But I do think that what we're talking about here shouldn't be how big is lido, it's Lido or how big is liquid staking versus centralized staking.
00:29:16.714 - 00:29:20.720, Speaker A: Michael, why don't you think it's a winner take all market or winner take?
00:29:22.610 - 00:30:01.980, Speaker D: I think there's going to be a lot of different I mean, we're already seeing Steeth is very different from some of the token models that are more akin to wrap steep, which means that you have the composability elements much easier assumed when used in DeFi. You're also starting to look at some of the different token incentive models and growth strategies of these protocols which will drive adoption. I would say there's just going to be novel ways of distributing value back to token holders for some of these ecosystems that are willing to do it. That may boost liquidity and interest more so or in a different way than lido or any of the other big ones.
00:30:02.670 - 00:30:35.926, Speaker C: The thing you have to think about with Lido is like, there's two things going on. Number one, lido is validating the chain. Number two, there's Steeth on chain, moving around in DFI, buying stuff, swapping, whatever that's generating fees for those validators. So it's an application phenomenon. It's also like a middleware phenomenon. And the thing I like, I love 99% of ethereum culture and ethereum influence in people, but the things I really don't like are a little bit of like you're either blessed by the EF or you're not or you're like a pleb or you're harmful to the protocol. I don't think that's the case here at all.
00:30:35.926 - 00:31:04.506, Speaker C: Like the EF and Lido need to kind like, figure out a way to work together. Not that they aren't already, but these things are only going to become more pronounced as liquid staking protocols. Not just lido, but others grow. Like there are some liquid staking protocols out there with really shitty validator sets, like three guys with different costumes on running the same validator. Those are the things which we should be looking out for, not things that are actively trying to decentralize. That's just my opinion.
00:31:04.538 - 00:31:24.022, Speaker A: I think that's a good point, Vince. I mean, I think you actually create a really bad incentive system if the Ethereum Foundation or anyone else is asking people to basically self limit the growth of the protocol. Because that's kind of saying, like, if you build on Ethereum and you win too big, we may go against you. Right.
00:31:24.156 - 00:31:25.346, Speaker C: Until we gatekeep.
00:31:25.458 - 00:31:31.318, Speaker A: It basically disincentivizes teams to build these value add projects on top of ETH.
00:31:31.494 - 00:31:44.282, Speaker C: Does anybody think that having less Steeth would be beneficial for fees and the underlying economics of the blockchain? No, it's like you're giving people a reason to use things and generate fees and make it secure. So I don't know.
00:31:44.336 - 00:32:29.900, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think the reason why people get concerned is if there was something like some sort of bug in Lido and there was a catastrophic slashing event right. Where an enormous part of state sort of got vaporized right. What would end up happening? Vitalik sort of wrote about this and he used the example of if there was some sort of slashing event on a layer two or a catastrophic not a slashing event, but like a bug on a layer two, would the chain get rolled back? And he heavily implied, no, it wouldn't get rolled back. But if there was a real big problem with Lido that I think is sort of the one application on Ethereum where there would definitely be a discussion about it if you roll the chain back. I think that's what people get concerned about.
00:32:30.510 - 00:33:03.718, Speaker C: My questions are like, what are the risks of that happening? So far there haven't been any slashing incidents that have been at scale. But I do think about that, frankly. I think the slashing incidents think about the framework for DeFi hacks. It wasn't really ever maker, it wasn't really ever ave or curve. It was like the hundredth clone of those that got killed. And if you add enough of those up, those become serious issues like Axie losing like $650,000,000. Just people who probably shouldn't have TVL in them, with TVL in them.
00:33:03.718 - 00:33:26.814, Speaker C: And so look at all the LST farms that have been popping up. There's some huge ones. Someone was 400 million in it the other day. What happens if that gets hacked is more of a question for me. So that's like relative risk and then alternatives to Lido that are outside of staking, which are risky. We'll see how restaking goes. But that's on my calendar for potential catastrophic event.
00:33:26.814 - 00:33:32.654, Speaker C: If something does happen, probably happens with people trying to rehypothe Steeth in some way.
00:33:32.852 - 00:33:33.600, Speaker A: Right?
00:33:34.050 - 00:34:38.120, Speaker B: We talked about that pretty adnault in one of the other episodes. I don't want to go too far back down the but just rounding back know, sort of connecting the dots, the uniswap discussion. The reason Lido I find so interesting is the value proposition of Lido is very much based on the sense that they have dual governance and that they're permissionless, right? Like the lower the surface area of what they try to do and how decentralized they actually are doesn't fly in the face of the product. It is additive to the product. If the community is assuaged that it is very decentralized and not super riskless, then yeah, that's actually good for the market share of something like Lido as opposed just I totally hear you, Vance. I'm not trying to be argumentative for no reason, but I just find it very hard to get behind the idea that, yeah, we can't allocate capital, so might as well just give it. Just I find that sort of uninspiring, to be honest.
00:34:38.120 - 00:34:47.320, Speaker B: But that's why it sort of works with Lido, right? That's why they're so obsessed with the staking router and dual governance, which dual governance is in the work.
00:34:48.010 - 00:35:38.360, Speaker C: So I do think there is now this paradigm shift where before you just had the miners and you could kind of beat up on them and push whatever soft grade upgrades and they couldn't really do anything because they were just a kind of incompetent B, they were just like tethered to the network no matter what. But now you do have real constituent sets. 7th largest asset in crypto is teeth. You're going to have to talk to those people at some point and hear them out if they want. For instance, 80% of the ETH fees go to burn, 20% goes to stakers. I may have that backwards, but correct me if I'm wrong, does that become 70 30 at some point? 50 50? I think there's a lot of interesting questions that you start to ask now that you have real stakeholders. And yeah, I don't think just the old governance process of ethereum is necessarily purpose built for that.
00:35:38.360 - 00:35:47.900, Speaker C: That governance process is more like the dev side. Push the upgrades, the miners just eat it now it's a lot different.
00:35:49.550 - 00:36:29.260, Speaker B: I agree with that. I agree. What do you think just before we move on to just social consensus, and I would love to poke at your guys opinions about the John Chard piece that he put out, but what do you think about the relative adoption of something like Steve Even versus ETH in something like LP pool or something like that? I guess the idea being if you totally derisked Lido, like, let's just say all the stuff that we've been talking about, basically some smart contract bug that wasn't a concern. I guess all things being equal, you'd rather own Steeth than ETH, right? Because Steeth is just yield bearing and ETH isn't. So what do you think about that?
00:36:29.870 - 00:37:02.078, Speaker D: Only caveat I'd say is that you'd want to own wrap Steeth most likely, which is effectively the same thing, it just has a non rebasing element. But yeah, to your point, why would you not own wrap Steeth versus ETH? There's not really any point. Well, on the same vein, maybe the one caveat would be if your ETH that you would be swapping is highly appreciated, depending on your jurisdiction, there could be a taxable event. But that's really kind of the only argument.
00:37:02.254 - 00:37:30.714, Speaker C: The way I think about it is the most active capital is Steeth for one reason or the other. For the past year, I think like 6 million or 5 million have been added to Steeth. That capital woke up. Think of like the bear market, the hibernation, whatever analogy you want to put through. It was kind of hibernating noticed. There was yield, it swapped its teeth and now it's kind of a bit more awake than a lot of the dormant ETH. I think that's how I think about basically everything right now.
00:37:30.714 - 00:37:47.698, Speaker C: It's like, that's the capital that's going to bootstrap things. That's the capital that's going to do all the interesting stuff. It's kind of got this community going. That's how I think about it. And I just like earning yield. I hate when things are not productive. And it's nice when you go to sleep and you wake up with a little bit more.
00:37:47.698 - 00:37:48.660, Speaker C: That's cool.
00:37:49.750 - 00:38:24.542, Speaker B: It is cool. Yeah. It actually reminds me of, I think maybe a month ago, or a month or two ago, we were sort of playing out this hypothetical. The stake rate for other chains that were proof of stake from day one, like Solana, are much higher than it is for Ethereum. And I think it was you, Vance, that said, yeah, I mean, sort of the way that you go is first you stake, that's like the very first thing that you do and then you go do other stuff from there. And Ethereum sort of made this transition after the merge and now people are staking and then you've got liquid stakes so you can go and do stuff with that. And the yield is actually pretty good.
00:38:24.542 - 00:38:39.794, Speaker B: So, yeah, I sort of agree with you. I think there is some interesting experimentation being done in Lstfi. There are stable coins that are being used to cloud. It's interesting. There are yield bearing stables that are getting created, but it's cool.
00:38:39.992 - 00:38:55.938, Speaker D: And this is even further in. The point of experimentation is going to be why it's not a winner take all market. Because I don't think you're going to have long tail of LSDs, be able to move as fast and experiment with things. And if something really hits, I think you'll be able to see some market share adoption.
00:38:56.114 - 00:39:29.138, Speaker C: Yeah, like you have Fracs doing this weird stablecoin lending. They're adding treasuries. I saw it's all going to be part of the same FRAX ETH. I think yield, you have rocket pool which is doing whatever they're doing. I kind of see there's going to be a long tail of really aggressive, like we're running one validator stake, a million ETH with us and that's how it blows up. And they're just going to subsidize that with a ton of tokens. So you'll probably see the rise and fall of a lot of these LST protocols, which we called out.
00:39:29.138 - 00:39:35.780, Speaker C: I think we said that last year, but it really is happening exactly as we drew it up.
00:39:36.470 - 00:40:03.550, Speaker A: Is this a fair thing to say? And then we can move past Lido. That the main critique on Twitter right now is that Lido is becoming kind of this staking monopoly. That is the wrong critique to make. And that the thing that people actually should be looking at is that you've got this protocol that's kind of controlled by 50 addresses and that the number of addresses should go up and should increase and that there's probably too little addresses or you don't see any problems across the board right now, I see problems.
00:40:03.620 - 00:40:41.414, Speaker C: I see the problems as we should have as many people staking, self staking as possible. We should have them paired with institutional backed node operators that can be the stopgap if something went wrong. But we should also acknowledge the reality of, like, people aren't going to set up their own self staking in the current context. They would have already done that if that was a viable option. And so the things that are going to make it easier to add more nodes such as DBT, where if your node gets up and it crashes, there's a fallback that is a lot better of a solution and a lot more practical than everyone. Spin up your kernel. We're going to go self stake.
00:40:41.414 - 00:40:42.826, Speaker C: It just doesn't make any sense.
00:40:42.928 - 00:40:44.234, Speaker A: Yeah, cool.
00:40:44.432 - 00:41:04.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree there. Can we talk about actually before we get to the John Chard piece, you interviewed Rune, the founder of Maker. Could you give a sense of just kind of a high level of what the end game is and maybe we can segue that into the Dai savings rate moving up?
00:41:05.490 - 00:41:41.718, Speaker A: Yeah, basically there's five phases of the end game. I'll give you like the TLDR on each phase really quickly. The first phase is this beta phase, which is, I guess could be summarized by building a unified brand. So in Rune's mindset, there's Maker and then there's Dai. And he believes that this is limiting the future of MakerDAO because first off, it's like very crypto y brand. And then there's like two separate brands. So he described creating this almost Robin Hood like brand that's very consumer friendly, not really a crypto brand that uses the protocol of Maker, uses the stable like uses Dai.
00:41:41.718 - 00:42:11.990, Speaker A: But consumers don't really understand and in his mindset, not that they don't understand it, but they don't really care what's happening behind the scenes. It's just like Robin Hood, like very consumer friendly. So that's the first phase, is this beta launch focused on establishing this unified brand. The second phase is the launch of the subdows. So in his mind, there are two classes of subdows. There's facilitator dows and allocator dows. There'll be, I think it was five or six different subdows that are each very focused on doing one specific thing.
00:42:11.990 - 00:42:46.410, Speaker A: And then each of those dows will get a token. So there'll be five or six new tokens launching each one for the subdow. The third phase is what he calls the Governance AI launch. These are AI tools for governance monitoring. And in his mind, the why behind this is like to reduce the asymmetry of information. In his mind there are about 30 people in the world who really understand what's happening with Maker, but people who really want to get involved with Maker, but those people and actually I was kind of giving him some shit here. But I do understand this.
00:42:46.410 - 00:43:33.930, Speaker A: I tried to getting involved with Maker and been trying and there's just so much information and so much going on with Maker and nowhere to really search for this. So in his mind, kind of what GitHub did with GitHub Copilot, he wants a Maker co pilot that knows all the overarching rules that the main protocol Dao sets. Like they set the risk parameters, they set the rules, they give you all the information. It's kind of like how teams create Wikipedia pages and notion pages with all the information. He wants to build an AI that has all that information. So that's phase three. Phase four is like governance participation, incentivization launch, like voting mechanisms, locking mechanisms, a 15% exit fee, basically trying to get more people to participate in governance.
00:43:33.930 - 00:44:08.460, Speaker A: And the fifth, the end game is launching a new chain. So launching he's just calling it the new chain. New chain is this blockchain that houses all the back end logic for the subdow tokenomics, all the MakerDAO governance security. Yeah, I think he described the key feature of the new chains, this ability to use hard forks as a governance mechanism to recover from catastrophic governance disputes. I didn't fully understand that part. Anyways. How long will this take? Years.
00:44:08.460 - 00:44:10.800, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:13.330 - 00:44:44.706, Speaker C: The reason that I like Maker are all the rules in the existing protocol are extremely battle hardened. They have value capture figured out. I think they still do the buy and burn. I'm not sure if they're still doing that, but they're not doing it. Yeah, they're not doing that anymore, but they used to and I guess they can turn it back on. I like it because it's simple and large and you can do big versions of ideas with it. I don't know how much this subdow I would be interested in as a user.
00:44:44.706 - 00:44:58.118, Speaker C: Maybe it kind of seems like a DeFi Summer style playbook where you just start spewing tokens of different projects. I would just need to understand more about what they're actually building in the near term to kind of he talks.
00:44:58.134 - 00:45:22.302, Speaker A: A lot about the original DeFi summer. He thinks I made the argument that we're not going to have another DeFi Summer until there's like big bull run even like macro, pump some money into the markets again. And he's like, no. He's like, Maker will kick off the next DeFi summer. Like Maker, the yield farming mechanisms we're putting into place. That's his belief.
00:45:22.446 - 00:45:49.980, Speaker C: I think the points in his favor are like these big LST farms that are happening there's clearly like hotballs of money that are trying to go somewhere and maybe he can just catch enough of that to make it a wave that he can ride. But I don't know, I feel like right now is the time for I think you could make Maker just super successful as is, honestly. And I would probably focus on the simpler things but what do I know?
00:45:50.750 - 00:46:17.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess my problem with it I mean I really respect anyone who tries to take on anything this ambitious. My problem with it is an incredible amount of focus on governance. No focus on distribution, marketing and product. I didn't really hear many conversations about the product for example and how you're going to make the product better than any Maker competitor. And I don't know that's what I would want to hear.
00:46:18.810 - 00:46:24.546, Speaker D: One question. I mean you were a delegate or still are one. I'm not exactly sure the status.
00:46:24.738 - 00:46:26.230, Speaker B: How's it going buddy?
00:46:29.210 - 00:46:43.660, Speaker A: I think there were like 5000 Maker delegated to me. I just got all my maker taken away because I voted in the wrong way. Voted in a way that the Maker God did not enjoy better watch.
00:46:45.170 - 00:46:52.400, Speaker D: Would you say that participation and inertia in the governance process of Maker so far has been strong.
00:46:54.630 - 00:46:57.650, Speaker A: Participate? There's not much participation.
00:46:58.070 - 00:47:14.738, Speaker D: So that was generally my point. How is it that splitting off this level of participation into five new Dows is going to somehow increase that level of participation to the point where those Dows will be governing aspects?
00:47:14.834 - 00:47:20.410, Speaker A: I know what you're walking answer. The easy answer is like it obviously.
00:47:20.480 - 00:47:22.460, Speaker C: Doesn'T right you do that.
00:47:24.350 - 00:47:39.600, Speaker A: The counter would be that trying to participate in Maker is so overwhelming because one day I'm voting on an interest rate increase and the next day I'm voting on where they're going to take their offsite and how much money it's going to be for the offsite and the next day I'm voting on it.
00:47:40.530 - 00:47:44.640, Speaker D: You're saying separation of concerns will streamline the process?
00:47:46.530 - 00:48:06.406, Speaker A: That would be the argument is that you should have people who are only thinking about the marketing of Maker. This would be the argument I think in the way that at Blockworks if you work on marketing you're not also trying to sell sponsorships and build the engineering, build the research product. That would be the it just seems.
00:48:06.428 - 00:48:07.880, Speaker C: Like the governance is all.
00:48:10.010 - 00:48:12.266, Speaker A: I mean, I have a lot of respect for.
00:48:12.288 - 00:48:16.700, Speaker C: Rune but this just feels a little bit like theater. A little bit.
00:48:17.630 - 00:48:23.590, Speaker D: My visceral reaction listening to this and I also listened to the interview. It's just one word. Complicated.
00:48:23.750 - 00:48:24.890, Speaker A: It's complicated.
00:48:24.970 - 00:48:49.880, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like everyone's being very polite on this. This makes no sense guys. This doesn't make any sense. I think it gets crazier the more you actually peel back the layers of this. There's a plan to have subdows and each subdow is going to have its own token, which it can then use to farm Maker. Guys, doesn't make any sense.
00:48:51.770 - 00:49:04.934, Speaker C: Devil's advocate. We're talking about the uniswap fee switch and everybody being scared to turn that on. This is like one guy who wants extreme agency over the direction Maker is heading in. I respect him. Willing to put out new tokens.
00:49:04.982 - 00:49:40.340, Speaker D: No. So I agree with willing to mix it up and change things. I think that this move is actually to disaggregate that control and actually disintermediate it from him. Because you're not going to be like someone who gets a certain number of vote share on a specific subject. It's going to be people who are elected to these Dows who then have to make the decisions on behalf of which means that you're going to have to know an OD number of greater than three people for five different Dows who are participating in decision making in five different areas of Maker. That's a lot of people just to be participating in this ecosystem at that level.
00:49:41.110 - 00:49:55.580, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, Michael, I don't know if you picked up on this, but there were a couple of times Rune was like, yeah, and then I tried to step away from the Protocol, and then I tried to step away and it does really seem like Rune. And then he's like, yeah, he talked a couple of times about like, yeah, I really want to go do something else. Basically.
00:49:57.230 - 00:49:58.698, Speaker D: I'm sure that's his end game.
00:49:58.784 - 00:50:11.198, Speaker A: He said that in passing, which yeah, I do think that Rune doesn't want to necessarily be working on Maker full time for the next several years. You don't have to.
00:50:11.284 - 00:50:13.854, Speaker C: The Protocol is like, I feel like you can just leave it.
00:50:13.892 - 00:50:41.900, Speaker A: Well, that's one of my concerns. That's probably one of my biggest concerns about endgame. Mike said it best, it's too complicated, it's too confusing. You can't align internal people or external people, but also that this is not a three year thing. This is like a seven to ten year thing in my mind, just with everything that they're trying to build. And you need a founder who's locked in and very committed there. And Rune seems to be like, in for two years, out for a year, in for a year, out for two years.
00:50:42.510 - 00:51:23.400, Speaker C: Kane is a decent analogy here. He stepped away from synthetics for probably half a year more and yeah, probably like closer to a year and recruited a whole new team of amazing guys. They're the whole team that's behind this new resurgence of perps and V two and V three and actually generating real returns for the Protocol. I think it's just like they did well because they were told to focus on one thing and do it really well and nail that and after like, you could expand. And even Kane's most recent blog post is like, the team's really killing it. I find that there's not enough time for these crazy ideas. And so here's a few things that I'm excited about.
00:51:23.400 - 00:51:52.110, Speaker C: It's helpful to have the core team day to day, grinding towards a tangible KPI, tangible goals, big market that's immediately addressable. And then Kane can kind of feel free to come in. He's on the Treasury Council now. He's doing some of the highest level governance stuff. He's doing recruiting, he's doing ideas. He doesn't necessarily need to be involved every single day, but there is still a role for him. And I think the role is like a combination of just having agency and wisdom and having the mentorship over this core team.
00:51:52.110 - 00:51:59.540, Speaker C: But if there's no one following you up the hill that you're charging up, that's usually not a great sign.
00:51:59.990 - 00:52:28.060, Speaker D: Well, what I'd add to that is a lot of the perspective that he shared in this blog post and he talks about publicly and in Discord is frankly just like we don't need to go that much further to get to disintermediate and dissolve these things and move on and kind of like the protocol will be done perspective, whereas it seems like this is the complete opposite approach, which is like we need to amplify and multiply so that we can be done with this thing.
00:52:30.850 - 00:52:32.480, Speaker A: Mike's not having any of.
00:52:34.690 - 00:52:40.830, Speaker B: This. Would any of you guys work here? Would any of you be like, I'm going to full time contribute to Maker?
00:52:42.450 - 00:52:43.200, Speaker A: No.
00:52:44.550 - 00:53:24.570, Speaker C: One of the points in Kane's blog post is like, we have to incentivize all the new core contributors just like they were founders of the Protocol, right? And so it doesn't mean that every five years you're going to get new core contributors and you need to keep paying them every single five years. It's probably like, we have three or four years of work and then we're going to be done. So this is like the last class of founders. I don't think there's a maker for those people. I don't think they would be paid that much. And B, I don't think the vision is super credible. So I probably wouldn't, honestly, Synthetics, I probably would if I was like a young kid coming out of college just like, looking for shit to do, I would probably work for Synthetics.
00:53:25.070 - 00:54:01.900, Speaker B: I think one of the drives of bringing a people on a team is that they want to work with other A people and they want to be doing the work that they were hired to do. They don't want to be worrying about all of this nut stuff that's happening around them. And I do think for a project, be it a crypto, primitive or a company, I think you want to limit the surface area that you're choosing to compete on. And I think Maker started with this really bold, audacious vision and goal. I am not sure that this is in service of that goal. And I just think it feels way too chaotic and complicated at the end of the day. But I could be totally wrong about that.
00:54:04.670 - 00:54:13.100, Speaker C: Would have been different probably if the token was a bit more distributed, if there was a bit more of like this is our thing versus this is his or my thing.
00:54:16.270 - 00:55:03.360, Speaker B: And the last thing I don't mean say this to be I also am in the camp of I respect anyone that takes a big, bold swing at something. And I don't mean this as a shot at ruin at all. But I also think this is just my opinion, looking at it from the outside. But they're raising the Dai savings rate as well, which it basically raises the cost of borrowing across other stables, which could be interesting. It actually kind of brought up an interesting discussion at Blockworks, which is I'd be curious if you guys think there is a notion of a risk free rate in crypto, or if it's just treasuries, or if there are kind of two different risk free rates that maybe move in tandem across crypto and TradFi. What do you guys think about that?
00:55:03.970 - 00:55:23.042, Speaker C: I think we're going to see a bunch of risk free rates or like risk free rates curve ave Maker, they're all going to put out probably heavily subsidized stablecoins and those are going to be like a tier below like even liquidy that's 0% funding. You basically just clip a coupon at the start, you give it to them, there's no liquidations, you don't have a funding rate.
00:55:23.096 - 00:56:05.478, Speaker D: My take on what we've hypothesized as a potential risk free rate in crypto is the price hedged rate of return of staking ethereum, which basically means and you can do this centralized, you can do this decentralized, you one for one hedge with long short and it's really simple. You basically hold steep on one end or wrap Steeth on one end and negative ETH on the other, and you ARB whatever that rate is. So you have to factor in the cost of whatever it takes to go short. But that I think is around 4%, four and a half percent right now, give or take, depending on where you do it and matches up pretty decently with federal fund trade.
00:56:05.514 - 00:57:01.634, Speaker B: I think it's sort of an interesting question. I think you could make a like the reason why the Dai Savings Rate is going up is because Maker has a bunch of exposure to short dated treasuries. So there is some amount of transmission. I would say there's like kind of a weak linkage in between the risk free rate of treasuries like TradFi and crypto, but ultimately yield comes from growth, right? Some entity says, hey, I think I'm going to be able to grow XYZ and therefore I'll take on debt and that's where the yield ultimately ends up coming from. And I do kind of think that using from that framework it kind of makes sense that. There would be ties in between crypto's risk re rate and the TradFi risk re rate, but it'll probably be slightly different. I would say moving forward, it'll depend because I don't think crypto and the economy grow in a perfectly correlated way.
00:57:01.634 - 00:57:17.954, Speaker B: I'm not sure if you read the John Charboneau piece about roll ups and how they actually actually sort of work, but I could sum it up. It was an interesting piece because I think the point can you guys hear me?
00:57:18.092 - 00:57:19.066, Speaker A: Yeah, we got you.
00:57:19.088 - 00:58:18.838, Speaker B: Okay. I think the point that he was trying to draw attention in sort of TLDR fashion to there is a very important difference about where an asset is issued and basically if an asset is issued natively on a chain or if it gets issued through a bridge and it's mostly relevant to something like roll ups, where you could imagine, like, let's just say again, fast forward two years and Arbitrum, or optimism, has a whole bunch of TVL. And let's say it's got USDC issued on there. Well, let's say there's 3 billion of USDC and one and a half billion comes from it was bridged from Ethereum, so it's using that trust minimized bridge. And then the other half of that USDC 1.5 billion is issued from natively issued on the roll up. And then let's say there's some sort of catastrophic bug and the roll up ultimately needs to get forked.
00:58:18.838 - 00:58:54.520, Speaker B: In that instance, what you can safely fork is the USDC that was issued natively on the roll up, whereas the other USDC is much more in question. So if you've been kind of reading and saying, oh, is an L two, an L one, that's kind of a tongue in cheek way of saying really the most important thing to consider is from the perspective you really want to hold. From a safety and security perspective, there's a strong incentive to hold your asset on the chain that it was issued. I'd be curious just what you guys thought about that or if you've given it much thought.
00:58:58.590 - 00:59:48.134, Speaker D: So not a ton of additional thought, just other than the fact that we rarely keep assets on layer twos that are not natively issued there. And it's not really because we don't trust in the situation, but as fiduciaries we just have to be really careful about the ecosystems that we play around in. I think this is also one of the reasons why so much TVL is still locked on ETH l one versus the L two S. And that may change. I know USDC just came out and said that they're going to natively issue on Arbitrum. And so that may change as partnerships like that really start to scale. But being able to segregate something that you've bridged and something that you just own on a native issuance, I think it'll be interesting to see what the UX is there, frankly.
00:59:48.182 - 00:59:48.780, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:50.670 - 01:00:14.762, Speaker B: I think there are interesting implications for CCTP as well. Which is that's an actual mint and burn model and mostly what people want to use. There's obviously a strong desire to use stablecoins. So I'm not sure what percentage of bridge assets are ultimately stables, but a mint and burn model like CCTP could be huge for Circle.
01:00:14.826 - 01:00:22.718, Speaker D: Frankly, I was going to know there are a number of different cross chain communications protocols. I know chainlink has CCIP.
01:00:22.814 - 01:00:23.122, Speaker A: Obviously.
01:00:23.176 - 01:00:45.770, Speaker D: Circle CCTP socket is sort of the bridge connective tissue that powers a lot of the bridging. So far that's bridging information and bridging messaging. But the mint and burn of a native asset could be the best solution that we have so far. So that would be in reference to CCTP.
01:00:48.190 - 01:01:15.140, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, I mean, those are basically all the crypto takes. We could end on a non crypto one. And there was something that was circulating on Twitter. I think it was Sachs, David Sachs that retweeted basically work from home policy with the gist of saying that work from home is a failed experiment and need to get butts back to the office. What do you guys think about that?
01:01:15.750 - 01:01:34.310, Speaker C: It's funny. He's ready to call. It like a year after we started the experiment. Didn't really get a lot of time to play it out, but I have two minds about it. First one is when we started Framework, we lived together. We didn't have an office. We were either in Michael's parents basement or in this small apartment in San Francisco.
01:01:34.310 - 01:01:52.542, Speaker C: But we were working at the kitchen. Know things going right, things going wrong, like you're brushing your teeth and your business partner comes up to you. It's like, yeah, we got to fix this. It's like that type of lifestyle. And I think that does help. And we didn't just do that for a year. We did that for probably three.
01:01:52.542 - 01:02:19.590, Speaker C: And we were roommates before that. So I do think there is a lot to that, especially the activation energy of starting something new, bigger companies. I think the cat's out of the bag, honestly. Like two or three days in the office, something like that. A day or two at home. It just feels like workers, whether it be more or less productive for the business, are going to make that stand. And sure, some of them will get fired, but I think there's enough slack at these companies where they'll get rehired.
01:02:19.590 - 01:02:23.740, Speaker C: But yeah, I think startups should probably be together.
01:02:24.510 - 01:02:50.370, Speaker A: I think the reason this is so tough is because the Twitter takes are always black and white. And this isn't a black and white thing. It's like there are a lot of different kinds of companies. Like Sachs being like this has failed. It's like, failed for who? I completely agree with Vance. Blockworks never would have worked if Mike and I were remote at the beginning. Blockworks today most of the company is remote, but if we were five people, we would 100% be in person.
01:02:50.370 - 01:03:28.320, Speaker A: Because I don't think you can get a company off the ground anymore. Let me say that differently. It's much harder to get a company off the ground when you're like sub ten people if you're remote than being in person. But as a company scales, I think most companies will be like three days remote, two in person or two remote, three in person. I also think there's a lot of companies who hired remote during COVID and then the majority of their employees are now remote. So it's very hard to walk that back. You could either let everyone go and start over again, but you're not going to do that.
01:03:29.570 - 01:04:24.186, Speaker D: So two things I think to your point, it is incredibly, if not completely dependent on what the type of company is. Blockworks is very different from Framework, which is very different from a technology startup. And I think that as you're starting up, it's really important to be in person as you need to access more levels of talent. It's probably a lot easier to have some elements of the team be remote just because you can access people who are not in the same geographic location. But there are going to be elements completely within framework. For instance, where we have investment committee meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, if you're not in the office, it's kind of hard to get your points across and it's kind of hard to have a real debate and conversation. And I think there's a huge bias towards having those in person versus not just like you would have major staff meetings or major product decision discussions.
01:04:24.186 - 01:05:42.620, Speaker D: There are elements that still require in person. And so the hybrid model I think is going to be probably the model that most employ for the foreseeable future. But to your latter point, it's going to be really interesting to see what happens to the large corporations who started maybe in an in person specific mode, went to work remotely, or work mostly remotely and have to make the decision now that things know potentially shifting to decide how they're going to know going forward and who's going to be allowed to do what, what days people are going to be allowed to do what. There's protests literally outside of I saw Seattle's headquarters over work from home and forcing people to come back and I mean, there was a bunch of things that were tied into that protest, it seemed like. But I think that it's going to be a painful process for a lot of these companies who have switched back and forth. I really wonder if we're talking about Blockworks and not to put you guys completely on the spot, but Blockworks three X from now in terms of headcount, is that all going to be remote? Is that going to be really hard to manage all remote? I do think that there's an element of what becomes the best process once you hit a certain breakthrough size, whether that's mostly in person or not?
01:05:43.950 - 01:06:34.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I will say I don't know obviously is the answer right now. But another big part of this, and I think frankly, one of the reasons why management has been so resistant to this is it requires managers to actually flex new muscles and say, how could we make this work in a remote environment? And to call out, we brought on a director of people recently who's been frankly kind of a game changer for us. And I think you sort of go through these stages, right, which was, all right, everyone went remote in the pandemic and everyone said, oh my gosh, this is totally fine. There's no change in productivity whatsoever. Then the market conditions kind of changed and everyone was like, wait a second, hold on, maybe we're actually not being that productive whatsoever. We need to get everyone back in the office. Then everyone realized workers really cared about not getting into the office.
01:06:34.074 - 01:07:12.520, Speaker B: And now we're sort of going through stage four where people are trying to figure out what actually makes sense. And I will say there are some really small things that you can do that make a world of difference for making people feel bought in. Be that small team onsites that happen on a somewhat regular basis or more structured sort of team calls that happen on a weekly basis. There are really little things that you can do to get maybe 80% of what you had before. But managers have to learn and adapt on how to do that.
01:07:13.290 - 01:07:47.478, Speaker C: I'm pretty sure the correct take is not that work from home doesn't work. Yeah, I feel like David Sachs probably struggles with like he's just at such a high off place know, politics and all that stuff, that unless someone's right in front of him probably struggles with information, it also comes from this perspective, or at least what I hear is these gen z's and millennials need to work harder. Yeah, that may be one problem that's like one of many, especially in the context economy.
01:07:47.674 - 01:08:30.334, Speaker D: I actually think it's the opposite. I think most people who are under the age of like 27, 28 want to be in an office setting at least most of the time. And I think it's the people who are older than that who are occupied at home or have other obligations that are the ones who are pushing for the more work from home environment. I remember when Marissa Mayer took over Google or Yahoo in 2012, I think, or maybe 2013. I can't remember when she took it over, but there was this article and she published an internal report of on average, and this is way before work from home was a normal thing on average, people were working from home three out of five days a week. And on the days when they were working from home, they were getting 2.2 hours of work done per day.
01:08:30.334 - 01:09:05.482, Speaker D: And that was the catalyst for her to say, okay, now everybody is coming back to the office and a ton of people left. And I think that's just because Yahoo in the mid 2010s was like a bunch of middle managers that didn't really have a product strategy and probably weren't really incentivized to see whatever they were working on come through. But there is an element of, like, it really depends on the company. And I agree. I think David Sachs, his take is not 100% correct, but I do think that there's an element of you have to have some element of in person contact for you to build a successful company.
01:09:05.536 - 01:09:12.320, Speaker C: I like the age thing. I like that young people should be in the office. I would have been just such a miscreant if I wasn't in the office all the time.
01:09:16.130 - 01:09:16.974, Speaker A: You know what it is?
01:09:17.012 - 01:09:56.906, Speaker B: It's kind of like one of those things. So if you have unlimited vacation policy, that gets billed as something that's very employee friendly, but it's actually not employee friendly at all. And on average, people use those vacation days less, and there are accounting reasons for doing that. I think also, it's one of those things that comes across as very young employee friendly, like from wherever you want, but there's so much formative stuff that you get being in an office your first two years in the workforce. You just learn how to be a functioning adult, somewhat or maybe not a fully functioning adult, but from an absolute miscreant to somewhat respectable, you learn what not that's what.
01:09:56.928 - 01:10:05.920, Speaker D: I think if you're someone who's young or early in their career and you're not in the same location in the office of wherever the CEO or the management team is, there's a.
01:10:08.290 - 01:10:45.580, Speaker A: Has. Michael Bloomberg's biography is called Bloomberg, and he talks about how basically what set him apart from everyone else that he went to college with. And I think he got an MBA. Everyone else is that he stayed at the office later than anyone else, and he always got to ride home in the same car as the boss's boss's, boss's boss. And he got that FaceTime. So he would literally be the first into the office to say hello to that person because they were always there early, and then he would stay later just to get a ride home with that person. And that basically set his career off.
01:10:45.580 - 01:10:55.278, Speaker A: Guy's also like 80 years old, so obviously he thinks that no one should work from home. But I think there's something to be said about just that FaceTime with people.
01:10:55.444 - 01:11:10.820, Speaker D: I literally just had this conversation with my cousin last night who is now going to be reporting directly to his company's VP of sales because he happened to be at the office while the rest of the team was out, and he started working on a special project that got rolled into a new role. And now the new role is reporting to the head of sales.
01:11:16.310 - 01:11:17.554, Speaker A: It's not black and white.
01:11:17.672 - 01:11:18.546, Speaker C: It's not black and white.
01:11:18.568 - 01:11:19.790, Speaker B: It's also very young.
01:11:19.960 - 01:11:38.266, Speaker C: Show up, and there's things that you can learn, like public speaking, not being shy. Those are all things that I had to learn. It is valuable to be in person, even if you just you were a shy kid. I was surprised about that at one point. I was definitely very shy and didn't want to do public speaking or anything like that. But yeah, I mean, you look at.
01:11:38.288 - 01:11:41.722, Speaker B: You on a podcast, I'll grow it up.
01:11:41.856 - 01:11:44.282, Speaker C: No, show up. You learn something.
01:11:44.336 - 01:11:44.890, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:45.040 - 01:11:50.158, Speaker C: Even if your boss is terrible, then you'll learn even more. And that's the gift that keeps on giving.
01:11:50.324 - 01:12:00.510, Speaker A: My first year in New York, I asked my boss if I could go home for Christmas break, just, like, as a formality. And he says, depends. Do you want to work here in January? Oh, my God.
01:12:00.580 - 01:12:04.966, Speaker B: We could do a whole podcast on Yena's first bosses in New York. That was pretty great.
01:12:05.108 - 01:12:08.260, Speaker A: I learned the hard way. All right, guys. Good app. Good to be back.
