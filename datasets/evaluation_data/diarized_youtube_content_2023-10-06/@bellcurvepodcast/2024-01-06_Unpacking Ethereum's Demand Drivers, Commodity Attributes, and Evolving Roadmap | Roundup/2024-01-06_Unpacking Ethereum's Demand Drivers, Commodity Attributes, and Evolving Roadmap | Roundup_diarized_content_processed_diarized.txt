00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.958, Speaker A: There's a societal impetus for commodities going lower, which is we use commodities. So if the price of oil goes to $100 or $200, our policymakers will move heaven and earth to make the price of oil go back down. They won't do that with the stock market. It's the opposite with the stock market. If the stock market is too low, they'll move heaven and earth to make it go back up. And so in some sense, asset prices are determined by what society needs. And I think the same incentive match in the long term is going to play out with these l ones.
00:00:31.958 - 00:01:01.626, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment, but before we do, I want to share something that blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, Blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of crypto, Goldman, JPMorgan, zero 72, all in one room. So you can know what the big money is doing. So click the link at the bottom of this episode. It'll take you right over to the homepage and use Bell 20 for 20% off. And I will see you in sunny London town in March. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve.
00:01:01.626 - 00:01:32.518, Speaker A: Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. First of the new year got me and your boy Miles.
00:01:32.518 - 00:01:35.610, Speaker A: Hold that down. Miles. How's the break, buddy?
00:01:35.950 - 00:01:47.370, Speaker B: Great. Got some sun with the family down in know. Acted like a retiree for a few days, which is great. The usual. The pickleball.
00:01:47.450 - 00:01:52.570, Speaker A: Some golfer told me you tried to swing out of your shoes.
00:01:52.730 - 00:01:53.438, Speaker B: I did.
00:01:53.524 - 00:01:56.238, Speaker A: Really wanted to get a piece of it on one of those drives.
00:01:56.334 - 00:02:11.080, Speaker B: Reminded that, like, very old and then actually felt like a retiree for about three days with damage I did to my back. But all right, we're back on the horse. Feeling good.
00:02:12.650 - 00:02:21.500, Speaker A: So I also was reminded of my. I went out to Montana. I tried to ski for a couple of days. Didn't do my warm up stretches before.
00:02:22.190 - 00:02:23.178, Speaker B: Never do.
00:02:23.344 - 00:02:29.740, Speaker A: Pulled the old back. Was walking very gingerly for about a week.
00:02:31.490 - 00:02:35.482, Speaker B: It's a worthy effort. It was a good shot.
00:02:35.626 - 00:02:59.634, Speaker A: Yeah, man, it really sneaks up on you talking like we're but yeah, it's the sitting all the time. The sitting does not help you. And every time I see a pt, they're like, do you sit a lot? I'm like, yeah, I'm required to for my job. Well, don't sit so much like, okay, cool, I'll just figure out I have to do that.
00:02:59.752 - 00:03:05.670, Speaker B: Exactly. Well, it's surprising, and it's not since we both had back problems for the last ten years. But anyway, that's a good point.
00:03:05.740 - 00:03:06.486, Speaker A: Yeah, sure.
00:03:06.508 - 00:03:08.310, Speaker B: The audience wants to hear more about this.
00:03:08.460 - 00:03:32.650, Speaker A: Exactly. Let's jump into it. I think the first topic that I want to address for you happened, I guess technically last week, but that's okay. I wanted to get your take on Vitalik's most recent piece. So make Ethereum cypherpunk again. And I also wanted to get your take on. He released an updated version of the Ethereum roadmap.
00:03:32.650 - 00:04:37.122, Speaker A: And I think that's the one that actually makes more sense to focus on, a, because I got reminded of what that actually is, but b, I thought the reaction to it on Twitter was really telling. And maybe we can use this as an opportunity to dissect a little bit the current state and narrative of Ethereum. So why don't we start with this roadmap? And just to give folks, and here, I'll actually share my screen, I've got it pulled up. But for those of you who might not have this right off the top of your dome, there are multiple stages to the Ethereum endgame. But Talek's actually been posting this at least since last year, and just sort of had a minor update to us. So I guess it's six stages is the merge, which is the merge, the transition from proof of work to proof of stake consensus. The surge, which is the goal to scale to 100,000 transaction per second beyond on roll ups then is the scourge.
00:04:37.122 - 00:05:30.018, Speaker A: So that's mitigate centralization concerns in Ethereum, particularly around Mev, liquid staking, that sort of thing. The verge, which is verifying blocks should be extremely easy. The purge, which is to simplify, basically reduce technical debt and I guess state growth, things like that. And then the splurge is just fix everything else. So a little bit of a cop out right at the end there. But other than that, an extremely detailed actually, as we were looking at this before, I guess from Vitalik's standpoint, we're at the verge where we're working on making proofs and verification extremely easy. But if I just sum this up, and I have a lot of empathy here, because for six years I've been getting the feedback at blockworks that we don't have a clear vision.
00:05:30.018 - 00:06:31.474, Speaker A: So I think we do. It's clear in my head, but I understand how difficult it is actually not just one years out or two years out to describe what you're going to do, but in a cohesive, detailed enough, but also simple and easy to understand, inspiring way, describe what you're doing on a five to ten year basis. If you haven't tried to do that to a group full of more than ten people, it is a daunting task. So I have a lot of empathy for the guy to just put this out there. But it was interesting to see the split because there were a lot of people, and definitely historically, when Vitalik has said basically anything, it's met with sort of adulation and oh my gosh, this is so great. And there was definitely some of that, but there's definitely some pushback, I would say, on the complexity and some people kind of bemoaning a, this stuff feels still very far out, or b, this just feels very technical or it didn't really have the parts that I really cared about, which is reducing gas costs or whatever. It know.
00:06:31.474 - 00:06:37.594, Speaker A: Miles, what did you kind of think about this update and then just the reaction to it?
00:06:37.632 - 00:07:44.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the order that these two were put out was that the blog post was put out first and then the roadmap came out second. Yeah, I almost wish it was reversed because I think people have a pretty understandable knee jerk reaction to looking at something this complex. And it's so daunting given how early we are in that roadmap. And I think the post speaks to a lot of the values that Vitalik is saying, hey, this is like what justifies the complexity of this roadmap. Like, if we actually care about these values like we say we do, this is kind of rationalizing this roadmap where if you just compared to something like Salana, I would say it's not like they don't share the same values, but it's much more straightforward roadmap. You understand what they're optimizing for. You understand that there is going to be issues along the way and we're just going to tackle them as we go.
00:07:44.020 - 00:09:04.330, Speaker B: So I would say that first, and then I guess second is, I think a lot of the pushback that we heard on it is kind of a reflection of the current state of Ethereum and this awkward stage of where it is in its longer term roadmap. We're at this stage where we're beginning to see, I guess, the key pieces of infrastructure that are going to fulfill this roadmap, whether that's roll ups themselves or zkps and lots of other items that were listed on here. But they're not the best version of themselves. And frankly they're worse in many ways than much more, I would say, like straightforward platforms, like what you can get on a monolithic chain. Like, yeah, I do think that Ethereum will be fine. I don't necessarily think that this roadmap is going to play out the way it looks right now. And I do think Ethereum should take more of maybe listen to the apps building on their chain and iterate this roadmap, refine it based off some of that feedback.
00:09:04.330 - 00:09:41.030, Speaker B: Sometimes I do feel like there is a little bit too much of a disconnect between the objectives of the core developers roadmap versus what I think the customers. Again, the builders of Ethereum really want. And sometimes with any business, right, your customers will tell you they want something and you know the bottom of your heart, that is not the right thing to build. And that's okay. But I still think that there probably needs to be more of that incorporated here. I'll pause there, but curious to hear your thoughts.
00:09:41.450 - 00:10:39.350, Speaker A: I agree with that, and it's actually one of the simplest things that people tell you all the time that I don't fundamentally believe is true. With a little bit of nuance, you obviously have to talk to your customers, but especially a, if you're really early stages and you don't have any customers to ask, you've got to do it based on your own intuition. And then b even with a small subset, if you don't have something like product market fit or your perfect customer identified, you're going to listen to a cacophony of voices that are often directly at ods with one another and you're not going to get any useful information anyway. And even at the very highest levels, you've got quotes from these. I don't even know if this is true, but this is the, you know, if I gave people what they wanted, I'd have faster horses and Steve Jobs certainly didn't listen. Anyone that all came directly from his mind. Now, we can't all be Steve Jobs, but I think there's an element of listening here and yeah, I think that hasn't been done as well as it could have.
00:10:39.350 - 00:11:42.474, Speaker A: On the other hand, though, I think where I have to defend Ethereum and Vitalik here is a just my personal empathy of the difficulty of sharing long term visions in a cohesive way, but b because I think what we've seen over the course of the last, certainly year is a convergence in the architecture of various blockchains and stuff that looked really distinct even a year or two ago is now starting to look very similar today. So that could be something like Cosmos and Ethereum. We've talked about it ad nauseam almost on this podcast about very similar visions just starting from different points, but even something like Solana, I think, and Solana is getting a lot of the benefit of, hey, we're the underdog now, and we've got this much simpler narrative of going fast, but they're probably going to have to deal with this stuff eventually as well. I listed it in one of the predictions for this year, but I think eventually Salana is going to get l two s as well. And it's not going to be a cost thing, it's going to be a sovereignty thing. That cosmos has been pretty directly right on in the beginning. So a lot of these architectures are heading towards the same way.
00:11:42.474 - 00:11:55.938, Speaker A: And maybe some of the criticism that Ethereum is facing right now is maybe there's an element of they're getting squeezed, but maybe they're just the furthest along. And this is something that basically every l one is going to have to deal with at some point.
00:11:56.024 - 00:12:33.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. It's interesting. I don't know. We were chatting about this earlier. It does feel like Ethereum is trying to thread the needle between, I guess, offering a lot of what bitcoin does at its base layer and with its native asset and eth and the qualities that those represent, as well as the plurality that Cosmos offers without a lot of the pain. Right. And I think that that's a super compelling vision if they can pull it off.
00:12:33.280 - 00:13:30.720, Speaker B: What does the role of Ethereum l one become in that world, and what does it need to be? I think that's where there is some difference of opinion, because just expecting there to be zero activity on Ethereum l one, but also expecting Eth to have the moneyness of bitcoin. I'm not sure you can have both of those things. It would be interesting, though, we were also chatting about this before. What if Ethereum l one is just used for staking and restaking and posting proofs basically as a bulletin board? That might be a way to get there, but I don't think that that is the vision of the core devs that are creating these roadmaps. In fact, I think we've heard many times how concerned they are about restaking and putting more stress on the consensus layer, right?
00:13:31.170 - 00:14:47.794, Speaker A: Yeah, man, there's so much to dig into here. Okay, so on the one hand, I think I'd break this discussion into two different parts, which is, does the Ethereum as money idea and meme ultimately end up making sense? And then there's the concept of, okay, let's just ignore if it's money, if it's a commodity, if it's just an operating system, a new model for an operating system, where is going to be the demand to buy Ethereum? And is a settlement for roll ups? Like, is that ultimately sufficient? Let's talk about the first one first. I think people talk past each other quite a bit on this, and this has always been the case within crypto. There are people that care about the money side of the use case, and then there's the people that are in it for the tech unironically, and they just talk right past one another. And you know what's funny about this, Miles, because I know you're a little bit more in the tech camp, and I find myself defending the monetary components of it to you, but then right on the other side, I will often be like, hey guys, maybe this ultrasound money means a little too far and doesn't. That was another one of my predictions this year. So I feel like I'm in the middle of this and I kind of see the merits of both a little bit, but I find it difficult because it's tough.
00:14:47.794 - 00:15:28.902, Speaker A: I have this mental framework that maybe we can get a little bit more into, but maybe we are shifting towards something that looks more like multiple commodity monies, in which case, yeah, maybe you do have like bitcoin and eth and all of this stuff, because bitcoin has basically with no demand, right. We can see outside of ordinals, transactions have been a one way stream down, but people are still adopting it, and it's the furthest along in its use case of money. That's a pretty strong data point. But on the other hand, maybe just bitcoin is the only money, and the rest of these things are things that look like operating systems. And it was silly to try to get squeezed. So I can kind of see both. But I think it's that talking past is a lot of the confusion here.
00:15:28.956 - 00:15:51.900, Speaker B: It is, and I think the folks that are most influential think that they can have their cake and eat it too. And I think that's definitely a possibility. But if you're optimizing to be a money, you're going to make very different decisions than if you're optimizing to be a development platform, right?
00:15:52.350 - 00:15:53.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:53.890 - 00:17:21.820, Speaker B: If you are trying to prioritize the base asset and the money, then you're going to want to basically put constraints on what the L1 can do and also constrain anybody building on your platform to have to use your asset in some way and have that actually be significant in terms of value accrual versus I think like a development platform doesn't necessarily even need a token whatsoever. And you can give ultimate sovereignty to all the builders on top. But as we've seen with Cosmos, you go too far that direction. Just as somebody who's been very active in cosmos for a while, we could use a base layer money that's kind of know rising tide lifts all boats sort of deal at the same know. I think trying to, I guess, pack everything into one monolithic think. I do think Solana is going to struggle a little bit at some point and they're going to figure out fees, but that's totally, they're going into this with eyes wide open of, yeah, we know this is not it, this is completely iterative, but I think it is just even more difficult when the further along the roadmap you go, the more success you have, the harder it is to make any of these decisions that may be optimizing for very different things because there's so much at stake. Right.
00:17:21.820 - 00:17:51.650, Speaker B: And that's where Ethereum finds itself on top of being at just a generally awkward stage of this roadmap. But yeah, I do think that there's so much to come. I do think a big question of this is like, what is the role of Ethereum l one in five years? And based off of that, we can kind of have more informed decisions on, or at least opinions on some of these roadmap items.
00:17:52.230 - 00:18:34.910, Speaker A: The rising tide lifts all boats is a very interesting, and I think, accurate way to phrase it. Every once in a while this debate will crop up about how gas is denominated in the native token. So guay or lamports or whatever. And people make the argument that there's a fundamental misincentive because as the price of the token goes up, it becomes more expensive for developers. However, I would argue that the best thing for developers is for the token to go up, because token goes up leads to more people buying, more people moving on chain, more users for you as a developer. So whatever incremental cost you're incurring by the price of the native token go up. I think you're making it back tenfold in the amount of new users.
00:18:35.070 - 00:19:34.290, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a mind share type of, type of deal. Absolutely. Though if we are optimizing to have a base layer money that's used for lots of different purposes, that volatility at some point is not a great thing for the actual usage of it beyond, I would say just b to b use cases where roll ups need to hold some to post data. Yeah, I think the money versus tech crypto debate surfaces itself every couple of years, especially as we get to major roadmap item decisions. The original being kind of like the block space wars, I would say with bitcoin and ethereum is kind of having that moment too. Right now. I don't think Solana will necessarily have as dramatic of a debate, but they will eventually need to face some tough decisions.
00:19:34.290 - 00:19:57.610, Speaker B: I still like, to your point, think they will either have to deal with roll ups or find other ways to satisfy apps that want to control more of their block space economics within the same monolithic chain. There are some interesting avenues there, and of course they have to figure out their own fee market dynamics.
00:19:58.750 - 00:20:42.794, Speaker A: I have a long term theory that might satisfy or tie some of these paradoxes in. And one thing that I think you have to get comfortable with if you work in crypto full time is the presence of irrationality for sustained periods of time. There was a pretty funny thing that was happening during yield farming. There was an irony where these markets were behaving in a way that was very rational and irrational at the same time. So really what you're doing with yield farming for a new protocol is you are issuing a ton of equity. And what traditional efficient markets theory would tell you is that when you issue more equity, the price should go down. Of course, that's not what's happening.
00:20:42.794 - 00:21:30.886, Speaker A: The price went way up. And that was actually rational because you could have surmised as a trader that when people yield farm, a ton of new users come and buy the token to yield farm, which makes the price go way up. And then there's a thing you can do. You can contribute to a pool and farm and get rewards, but there's this very irrational and simultaneously rational thing that was happening. And then eventually what ended up happening is real rationality kicked in, everyone dumped the tokens, and now most founders look back at that as sort of a mistake or something to be improved on. And I think the same thing is basically going on with L1 tokens, which is that right now you can make these logical arguments about long term incentive mismatches. And I think there is a long term incentive mismatch.
00:21:30.886 - 00:22:08.614, Speaker A: But the best thing to happen is for you to have this sort of memetic narrative driven, no cash flow, very difficult way to value sort of thing go up. You gain a lot of mind share. Developers, builders, create a lot of wealth and have people build on it. But long term, and I think that's going to happen for the next five years. I think the framework to keep in your mind is a commodity boom, because that's what these. I think most of these things are digital commodities, but eventually incentives will kick in. And I think that point, this is just like commodities in the real world.
00:22:08.614 - 00:22:46.782, Speaker A: The reason commodities aren't a long term buy or they tend to trend sideways or down is because there's a societal impetus for commodities going lower, which is we use commodities. So if the price of oil goes to $100 or $200, our policymakers will move heaven and earth to make the price of oil go back down. They won't do that with the stock market. It's the opposite with the stock market. If the stock market is too low, they'll move heaven and earth to make it go back up. And so in some sense, asset prices are determined by what society needs. And I think the same incentive match in the long term is going to play out with these l ones.
00:22:46.782 - 00:23:11.286, Speaker A: So we could argue that these things are commodities today and they would be good for the developers if they're lower, but they're going to continue to go higher. But eventually, once we get businesses that consume that block space with product market fit, the leverage is going to change. The incentives are going to kick back in and eventually the Daps will have the leverage at that point. And my guess at that point is that these l ones start to trade more like commodities.
00:23:11.398 - 00:24:13.678, Speaker B: That's interesting. I think whether it's a DaP or whether it's an l one, this is a little bit more of a simple take. But I think there's always a period where you have a chance to be early. And what I mean by that is going all the way back to yield farming. As a retail participant, I would never be able to get to own anything that looks like equity of a private startup at maybe what was probably a series a, series b stage. And you add that with a risk on sort of macro backdrop, and that's when you see this speculative mania. I would look at Jito right now too, right? I don't think there's anybody doing DCF charts of and saying, that's why, like buying more or not throwing my airdrop, right.
00:24:13.678 - 00:25:07.230, Speaker B: It's just that I have the opportunity to get in at this stage and it seems like we're back in terms of the market. I'm probably going to make money by holding this for some period. And then when that risk return profile goes down, now we see projects even at the DAP level again, just to get the commodity out of it. Maybe just focus on Dapps where you have maker Lido Dydx. You look at the PNLs and it's really impressive at this point, it's like they've actually gotten to that stage, and yet they're unfortunately being priced like a real asset. Like other people are looking at fundamentals D IDX is offering. If you stake it, I think it's like 20% APY and pure USDC from protocol Revenue alone.
00:25:07.230 - 00:26:25.510, Speaker B: And you haven't heard anybody talk about that. I think that's insane that we're now at the stage where these like, there are a few projects that have kind of crossed that chasm into the point where even a fundamental investor would see value there. So that's not to say that it's like at a certain point where being early is kind of like, you miss the window, now all of a sudden all these emissions, these yield farming, continuous airdrops, looks like cost. And I would also just point out, like, there were some airdrops during the bear market. Those guys just bled equity without any of the benefits for a year and a half sometimes, right? They just had the wrong timing, whereas there were a lot of projects that said, actually, it's probably not the right time to, I guess, pull that card. And now the ROI per se of that ICO or token launch is order of magnitude higher than those that. Just purely from a timing perspective, then, unlike the assets longer term, to your point, on the commodity side, the l ones, the assets that you actually need to use that to me, feels like a bit of a different animal.
00:26:25.510 - 00:27:05.558, Speaker B: I do wonder at what point you and I debate all the time whether l ones can or should have pnls, right? And it's much more hazy. I will admit that even though I might be on the side, that you could probably have a good understanding of the fundamentals if you're not overly creative, I do think that that's a much more interesting question. Whether or not it actually detracts from the platform, like, the volatility or speculative nature of it does detract from the platform. Yeah, I'll pause there. I don't know.
00:27:05.644 - 00:27:22.780, Speaker A: No. We had this conversation today. If you had to guess what percentage, let's call it maker synthetics, uniswap ave are off their all time highs. What do you think?
00:27:23.390 - 00:27:28.410, Speaker B: Probably still pretty high. At least 50% for all of them.
00:27:28.480 - 00:27:34.014, Speaker A: Maybe 75, 70 to 85, 90%.
00:27:34.212 - 00:27:41.310, Speaker B: Right. I was like, maker didn't get insane. Maker was like eight. Now it's at two. Okay. Yeah. And that's probably the best one.
00:27:41.310 - 00:27:42.602, Speaker B: Uniswap is at 40.
00:27:42.676 - 00:27:43.300, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:45.190 - 00:27:56.850, Speaker B: That's not to say that those assets were ever worth those ftvs at the time, though. Right. And not to say that they will be repriced now that they're in a new stage of maturity.
00:27:59.110 - 00:28:45.790, Speaker A: Okay, I have a thought for you on the FDV. This is also something you and I have talked and puzzled about, and I don't think we ever came to a super satisfying answer. So one of the quirks of crypto, as compared to just traditional equities, like a private company, is that you have a concept of market cap and fdv as just opposed to enterprise value that you'd have in a startup. And I think that FDV, first of all, I think it's a holdover from bitcoin. We need this many bitcoin, and this is the number until the heat death of the universe type thing. But I continue to say that inflation is absolutely a cost, but if you are getting a return in excess of what you're paying out, inflation, it's a good deal. You should do it until you can't do that anymore.
00:28:45.790 - 00:29:25.646, Speaker A: But one of the thing that's funny about a startup is if I just asked you to do the FTV of this startup, you'd be like, that doesn't make any sense. It's infinite, because at various rounds, you reprice and issue equity. The FTV is infinite. You have this infinite pool. And it's just so funny, optically, that these early stage startups have basically been like, okay, here's what we're issuing today, which is essentially a small funding round. We have this other pool, which we're going to use for other funding in the future. But the fact that it's just so there and visible reminds everyone that you can get dumped on, and everyone's like, oh, the FDV is real, but you're getting dumped on all the time.
00:29:25.646 - 00:29:35.586, Speaker A: If you're an early stage equity investor, it's called dilution, it's called raising around. And they're kind of the same thing if you squint at it. But optically it feels very different in crypto.
00:29:35.618 - 00:30:36.690, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. I think it was this great piece from Hasu and Monet supply from a while ago that talked about treasury assets as the closest equivalent is being like, authorized but uninissued shares. And I just think. I'm not an expert by any means, but I just think the relative difference in terms of float to authorized but uniissued shares is much lower or much like there's probably just a little bit of authorized but uninissued shares than what we see with a lot of crypto projects where it's 5% of the supply is representing the market cap, and the FDV is some insane number that no one knows what it would look like when those tokens are actually issued. I think I'm completely with you. I don't know if and when this is ever going to change, but there's only been really one major vote to issue new tokens through governance.
00:30:36.690 - 00:30:47.158, Speaker B: And it was, I think it was yearn from a few years ago. And that's this crazy, scary thing that shouldn't be that crazy and scary.
00:30:47.334 - 00:30:48.262, Speaker A: It shouldn't.
00:30:48.406 - 00:30:49.100, Speaker B: No.
00:30:49.550 - 00:30:59.610, Speaker A: This whole space is too focused on the supply and not focused enough on the demand. Again, I think a psychological holdover of bitcoin.
00:30:59.690 - 00:31:00.126, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:00.228 - 00:31:32.186, Speaker A: Okay. I wanted to ask you about the Ethereum. Okay, let's take this from the perspective of. I would be probably on the side that it's slightly less appropriate to put a PNL around Ethereum, because you were the one who gave me this framework, actually, multiple different intersecting pnls of. So the analogy would be oil. If you think about Ethereum as oil, oil itself doesn't have a PNL, but the Exxon certainly does. Right.
00:31:32.186 - 00:31:53.840, Speaker A: And whoever else is involved in that ecosystem. Same thing with. And the intersecting pnls around Ethereum would be holders, stakers. If you think about one of the narratives that has come out around Ethereum is very similar to bitcoin. It's the settlement layer. So I think it would be interesting if you treat eth like a commodity, let's say. I don't want to try to value it in a PNL form.
00:31:53.840 - 00:32:31.174, Speaker A: I want to look at it as a model of supply and demand, in the same way that you might try to anticipate what the price of oil is going to do. I don't really know how you do that for oil. I would guess it's like this is how much is coming out of the ground, this is how much OPEC holds on the supply side. And then on the demand side, it's like I try to aggregate cars and jets and things like that, and you try to shake out where supply and demand is going to do. So let's do that for Ethereum. So for Ethereum, on the demand side of the token, you've got whatever roll ups are going to have to pay to Ethereum for settlement, which is not very much. Settlement is very cheap.
00:32:31.174 - 00:33:16.026, Speaker A: There's whatever roll ups are going to have to pay in terms of data availability, which we know are going to start to get outsourced to Celestia or eigenda, which has an interesting restaking connection. There is the gas fees that get paid by users on layer one, which I think this was one of the criticisms of the roadmap for Vitalik. He removed something about reducing eth costs. We know that they're trying to move, so we should expect that to go down. And then there's another one, which is restaking. I would argue if restaking really takes off, it's incremental demand for people to buy Ethereum and then stake it on the chain, which has implications for the supply. So ultimately we can say whatever we want.
00:33:16.026 - 00:33:39.074, Speaker A: And then I guess there's the delta between the supply and demand versus. I guess the other reason why you hold EtH is because it's this store value money type thing. So am I missing something on the demand side for the reason to buy eth? Which do you think will be the most significant drivers on the demand side? How do you view that?
00:33:39.112 - 00:34:21.680, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a super good question. And I guess there's two ways to look at this. There's the sort of like commodity with those separate different p ls. The marketplace sort of economics have always resonated with me as well. And marketplaces also have three different p ls, depending on whether you are the suppliers or whether you're one of the consumers on the other side, or whether you're the marketplace itself taking a rake. And I think that a lot of those dynamics still apply here. I think we can look at all those things that you just listed are true.
00:34:21.680 - 00:35:54.814, Speaker B: The bigger questions for me is, is there this wagyu da wagyu block space for something like token issuance or just really price and sensitive users settling very high value trades? Again, I think this migration off of l one is going to take much longer and maybe will never fully happen, and that's just another demand driver to think about. And then the restaking side, I don't know where I would put that necessarily, because see it as basically, one way to look at it is if you're like me and you look at, let's just say, because it's the cleanest self. Solo stakers, right? Solo stakers to me are like the most clear cut case where you could argue this is a service provider to Ethereum as well as an Ethereum holder. But from the service provider side, they are literally performing a job. And the only reason they're performing a job is because they're getting paid enough either through a combination of emissions and revenue share from the protocol, either MEV fees or just priority fees, right? And if they weren't getting that revenue, they would stop. And if the network was just solo stakers, the network would no longer run. Right? So that's why I consider that a cost.
00:35:54.814 - 00:37:05.720, Speaker B: But it's almost like you're looking at the supply side, which is this weird hybrid of service providers and actual holders of whatever asset you could argue represents. Value is correlated to the value of the network, and it's almost like it's repurposing a lot of the existing costs and a lot of the existing services that it's running for other networks. I think in some sense, yeah, I think it will drive the demand for Ethereum to a small extent, but in a lot of ways I'm not sure there's going to be more demand for ETH necessarily, but there could be more demand for staking, which again, I don't think that changes the economics of ETH. Right. It just dilutes the total yield that all of the supply side operators get if the staking ratio goes from what it is today to something well over 50%. So I know we differ on a few of these points. No.
00:37:09.770 - 00:37:58.214, Speaker A: The future that I think we both agree on here playing out is. It's funny because I don't think this is what the Ethereum foundation wants to happen, but I think the future that ultimately ends up playing out is the stake rate goes much higher. 56. It starts to look more like a traditional proof of stake chain. One of the funniest discrepancies is in between what like Salana or Cosmos might think of as the target stake rate, because from their eyes they want the security. Higher stake rate means more people are staking, you have more security, whereas Ethereum wants it lower. And I think the reason they want it lower is because if you are paying more out to stakers, if you have more people staking, you have to pay more out to stakers and you're favoring the stakers as compared to the holders of ETH, and you're, I think, diminishing some of its monetary properties and.
00:37:58.412 - 00:38:28.000, Speaker B: Lsts just add a whole nother element to that. You're right, because now you have something that can compete with liquid eth from a money ness and a utility standpoint that actually is like the stated goal of Lido, is to become as ubiquitous and as useful as ETH itself. And there's mixed feelings on that. I mean, some people just see that as like an inevitability, or some version of that is an inevitability, given just the incentives apply here. Right?
00:38:28.370 - 00:39:00.086, Speaker A: Yeah. There's a comparison to be made if people care about things like this, but I think it's directly relevant. In between a country's currency market and its bond market, there is a natural reflexive relationship and tension in between them, and the tension being the way a country. There's a lot of debate around this. To oversimplify funds itself is to issue bonds. And that allows basically the government to spend money into existence. And people argue about the order of that.
00:39:00.086 - 00:39:29.620, Speaker A: They say they spend money and then they issue the bonds, whatever, it doesn't really matter. That's the basic relationship. And then what ultimately ends up happening sometimes is country will sell bonds to a bunch of other entities that hold those things, like money. And actually, most people that are monetary scholars would argue it's very difficult to even define what money is. Money is different things to different people. When corporations say they have money on their balance sheet, they're not talking us dollars, they're talking about bonds, they're talking about yield bearing money. So I think there's a distinction between yield bearing and non yield bearing money.
00:39:29.620 - 00:40:07.434, Speaker A: But there's a tension in that. And this is something the US is probably going to have to face eventually. We have so many bonds outstanding that people are going to say we can never repay our debt. Well, we can repay the debt, but what we ultimately have to do is print more money to do that. And so the US will probably have to make a decision at one point, do we prioritize the bond market or our currency market? And countries always, always prioritize the bond market. So I guess I understand that from the perspective of Eth there. But I think that is the ultimate idea, as they see this tension in between the derivative, in this case steeth, and eth itself, and they want to prioritize eth.
00:40:07.434 - 00:41:10.594, Speaker A: But I think inevitably what's going to happen is that people are going to want to stake keeping the issuance rate low. I think has the risk of actually doing the opposite of what people want, which is they're not going to stake less because you offer less yield. They're going to go out on the risk spectrum and do things like restaking and find ways to opt into additional incremental yield. But Miles, I'm not actually sure, like, I'm front running our episode that's coming out on Tuesday, but I do think an asset that these networks have outside of the security of its block space, is this group of validators that people and entities that they've convinced to do work on Ethereum's behalf and to receive rewards denominated in Ethereum. And you're starting to see this with both Eigen layer and PEPC. But if you were to ask validators to do more, do you could build a lot more cool, very decentralized products. So I don't know, you're right.
00:41:10.594 - 00:41:22.134, Speaker A: Maybe that's not necessarily accretive to the price of eth, the asset, but you could get a lot of cool stuff if you readjusted your definition of what a validator is supposed to do and.
00:41:22.172 - 00:42:41.594, Speaker B: All of that cool stuff that's made possible by not being beholden to the constraints of literally building as a roll up or on l one, right. But still being within the Ethereum ecosystem and providing value back to the Ethereum ecosystem. I think the whole point of eigen layer, their main thesis is that that does ultimately grow the pie much more than you could if, first of all, everything was horizontally scaled, completely separate, like cosmos, or if everything was basically constrained into one sort of execution environment like we see Solana today. I think that obviously the downside risks of any sort of debt rehypothecation are significant. I do think if and when Eigen layer is used irresponsibly, it will lead to a blow up. But I do think net, it's going to be very positive and we'll see. I think Eigen layer is definitely more of this sort of tech crypto sort of mindset, right? It's like, okay, we're constrained by Ethereum, but we love ethereum, the asset.
00:42:41.594 - 00:43:29.040, Speaker B: It's got amazing qualities, this huge asset of their supply side, right? It's the most decentralized in the world. Let's build things that wouldn't be possible without necessarily adding all these new trust assumptions. That has the downstream impact of raising the staking know significantly, right? Because it will drive demand for staking, which in turn it makes the premium of liquid eth less significant versus staked ETH. And in fact, you could imagine staked ETH coming the far more popular way to have exposure to ETH. So there probably is a tension there. And this is just another example of that tension playing out. Right?
00:43:29.410 - 00:44:21.118, Speaker A: Yeah, I can certainly see, know, I looked this up at one point. I looked this up. Actually, you know what? There is a great interview from a guy, Sir Paul Tucker. He used to be a Bank of England, head of, head of the bank of England's central bank. And he described the monetary policy of when he was, forget if he was the head of it or like the know, the chairman type thing, but he described it, know, because I've looked at, this is like an issue that a lot of people talk about that got them into bitcoin. Why do we have so much debt? And he described it not in terms of really managing the finances of a country, but the relative demand of yield bearing versus non yield bearing money. And he said there's just so much more demand for yield bearing money than non yield bearing money.
00:44:21.118 - 00:44:30.314, Speaker A: And probably, yeah, that would probably be similar to, probably be similar in this case. So who knows?
00:44:30.442 - 00:44:37.606, Speaker B: I agree. I think it'll be interesting to see how they handle this over the next couple of years.
00:44:37.708 - 00:45:07.502, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, Blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of crypto. We are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers. So think tradfi, macro funds, crypto native funds, big allocators and financial institutions. So banks, payment processors, et cetera, all in one spot. It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan, zero, 72, whatever, all in one room.
00:45:07.502 - 00:45:34.182, Speaker A: So you can know what the big money is doing. We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of macro and crypto, where we are in the cycle, real world assets. So everything from stablecoins to onchain treasuries to tokenized assets, it's going to be a blast. But the other reason you really want to go is London, baby, center of the world at one point. You got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer, it's going to be a blast. So because you're such great listeners to Bell curve, there's a code, bell 20 that's going to get you 20% off.
00:45:34.182 - 00:45:49.306, Speaker A: So click the link at the bottom of this episode. It'll take you right over to the homepage. You'll see all of our speakers and use bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code. I will see you in sunny London town in March. Let me ask you this, Miles, one more question.
00:45:49.306 - 00:46:07.200, Speaker A: I had a good back and forth on this with Victor Boonin on Twitter because actually there was a long discussion, I think it was Sam Hart and David, and then there was some back and forth about whether or not Adam was a monetary asset compared to.
00:46:09.490 - 00:46:09.854, Speaker B: You.
00:46:09.892 - 00:47:04.800, Speaker A: Know, people always knock Adam for not being a monetary asset, and for some reason EtH is, but I'm not actually 100% sure why that is so much. And if the idea for ETH is to be a monetary asset, is the assumption that all these roll ups are going to want to use ETH as their native currency, or do you think it's more likely that they'll try to use their own native token as their currency? So, cosmos, their explicit design is that anyone can be fully sovereign. We've talked about this. I think Cosmos has gone probably too far down that route or is just too ahead of their time a little bit. But I do think a lot of people are assuming that the rollups are going to want to use ETH as a currency, and okay, base is doing that because of regulatory reasons, most likely. But I think a lot of these other roll ups, don't you think they're going to want to use their own native token or how do you see that playing out?
00:47:06.890 - 00:47:48.050, Speaker B: Think? I don't think that there's going to be one dominant model, actually. If anything, I think for a long time it will be majority EtH. You can still have your own token. All that ETH revenue from sequencer profits, whatever that accrues to your treasury. And at some point, once you're large enough, you start paying out real yield eth to your token holders. That's a pretty good outcome, I think, maybe just to touch on Adam versus EtH. Just the clear difference is like, you need Ethereum, you need to hold ETH to interact with Dapps on Ethereum, you need to hold ETH to onboard to Ethereum.
00:47:48.050 - 00:48:46.462, Speaker B: It's very hard to onboard to Ethereum without having any ETH. I think it's probably going to change over the next couple of years, but at the very least, even if the roll ups abstract that all away, they need to hold ETH to post data. Adam, in optimizing for sovereignty while it's still like the most widely held asset in cosmos. You can see the latest projects that arrived in Cosmos have really no interest in associating with Adam because that's not why they chose cosmos in the first place. And so I do think I would call out that distinction. I don't know to what extent necessarily it's the utility of ETh that has really grown. The moneyness versus, I'd say, like their early stage beginnings as everything being on one chain.
00:48:46.462 - 00:48:54.440, Speaker B: I guess those are kind of the same thing you need eth. Right. Versus just the memetic sort of value and momentum that both of them have.
00:48:54.810 - 00:49:04.060, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a little backwards looking, I think, because I'm making the assumption at least that most roll ups are not going to pay for.
00:49:05.470 - 00:49:10.618, Speaker B: Is your assumption that most roll ups will use their own token as gas, right?
00:49:10.784 - 00:49:40.662, Speaker A: Yes, I think the vast majority are going to try one other. Maybe subtle, but I think important difference between Adam and Eth is that there's token governance in Adam, and that has led to slightly different ideas, like redirecting some funds, like the community fund. Right. That's not something that exists in ETH, although I guess you have the EF, but you do have the ICF. Anyway. There is a difference between, I think, the governance aspect of it as well.
00:49:40.716 - 00:49:42.120, Speaker B: Oh, huge. Yeah.
00:49:43.290 - 00:50:22.286, Speaker A: But I also think it's going to be a slightly more nuanced thing. My guess would be though, is that most. I just try to put myself in the situation of one of these roll ups. And I think if you. I'm assuming I'm a mid to high tier roll up here because I believe in myself and I would try to use my own token as gas before I. And I know you can do restake security and maybe that's the. I think the end state is probably that all of these tokens try for optimized for sovereignty, but eventually they're going to end up having to have some form of reserves.
00:50:22.286 - 00:50:23.220, Speaker A: Sure.
00:50:23.750 - 00:50:47.420, Speaker B: But can I give the counterargument or like a word of caution here, let's think about. So the upsides of using your own token for gas is that there's utility. Right. You actually have to hold some of this. Right. I don't think they actually think that has anything to do with staking. Right.
00:50:47.420 - 00:51:51.310, Speaker B: You could have staking as part of that too, but that's just kind of continuing the sort of mapping over of l one tokens. And that I think doesn't really make a difference. So the trade offs are, I think three things come to mind. One is onboarding friction. So if you're building on Ethereum part of that decision, is because Ethereum offers a great distribution channel, right? And now you're making people who will hold eth go, maybe buy another, buy your asset, which maybe that hurts your funnel metrics to some degree. So that's number one. Number two is the economics get really complicated where you need to hold at least seven days worth of ETH on l one to pay for data posting fees, basically your sequencer ops, right? And you are then having to gauge that against the price of your token.
00:51:51.310 - 00:52:15.190, Speaker B: And if you want to keep the price of your token flat and the price of eth moves, now you're dealing with potentially a shortfall. Or if the price of ETH stays flat and you keep your token flat, your gas price is flat, but your token goes up. Now, users could be paying $5 a transaction, right? It just gets complicated from an economic standpoint.
00:52:15.770 - 00:52:21.050, Speaker A: Does it change your mind if most of these roll ups don't end up posting DA to Ethereum?
00:52:23.870 - 00:52:38.190, Speaker B: No, because then if anything, you might have even more complexity where you have to hold some ETH, some tIa, but then you're converting your token into those two cost buckets.
00:52:39.170 - 00:52:40.110, Speaker A: That's a good point.
00:52:40.180 - 00:53:12.060, Speaker B: Then the last thing I would say is you don't want gas revenue to be a big, I would say revenue driver. In the long run, standard transactions are going to be driven as close to zero as possible. Or if you don't, then you're going to get undercut. Now I think there's probably $0.01 versus like fractions of a cent. Doesn't really matter as much as people might think. That's the first half of that.
00:53:12.060 - 00:54:40.190, Speaker B: A significant portion of revenue could be high value block space though, right? So if you have a proposal builder separation of some kind, or you're auctioning off the highest value block space that people are actually willing to pay for it. It's not a drag on users, it's actually pure profit for them, and so they're willing to give you a piece of that profit. That all becomes much more complicated when you've got especially these shared something like suave, right, where everybody's trying to price the opportunity and you have maybe one auction, shared auction for multiple roll ups that's priced in ETH, but then you're going to have to pay for that block space in whatever roll up token is. And so if you want like a really competitive searcher sort of environment that is paying you and paying you as much as they possibly are willing to pay for that block space minus some profit for themselves, the more complexity you add to that, the less they're willing to pay, because that adds risk to their PNL as well. Those would be why I think there will be a couple of the big general purpose ones that try this. Super interested to see how it goes. But it does feel amazing that you can have a token or you don't, or you can't have, or it doesn't really matter.
00:54:40.190 - 00:55:43.740, Speaker B: You could be base and not have a token and still be making a ton of revenue in ETH, right? Or you could have some token but still just charge Eth as your base fee. And I think at the end of the day, token holders for any sort of asset, a great outcome is getting that capital returned to them and having that capital returned to them in the asset that they're likely going to. If it's ETH, they'll get like x token dividends and sell that back to ETH probably anyways. So I do see, obviously it's in ETh's best interest to be pointing out all of these downsides, but once you really start thinking about it, it's one thing to say, okay, users can pay in USDC and ether like whatever they want. It's another thing to force a token on them. But I know there will be many that do.
00:55:44.670 - 00:56:35.338, Speaker A: I think that's the point that I was trying to make, is that they will try to. But you are convincing me, first of all, you're convincing me that it's not going to work faster than I probably thought it wasn't going to work. Although in a bull market, these token prices will probably go up more than eth, so it'll work for them, the foreign exchange risk that they're essentially taking on. But this also explains why Cosmos is God, cosmos just so ahead of its time on all these. That explains the sort of describe it, the localizing, the unit of account to, because this is the argument I was trying to make the other day. The onboarding flow today, I think, of most users has been when there were fewer assets and this environment was less complex. And actually, I still think this is going to be for a while.
00:56:35.338 - 00:57:17.634, Speaker A: How most people get onboarded to crypto on a centralized exchange. You buy bitcoin or ethereum or solana or atom or whatever. Okay, then it realistically takes how long? Two years maybe. It depends on what stage you get in. In the cycle I got in in a bear market, it took me longer than probably you did to take your assets off the exchange, to get a wallet, to start doing things on chain. And so I'm sort of making the assumption that many users are going to their first foray into this space is going to be to buy a major l one token and then to go from the l one into other things, as opposed to something like USDC. That assumption might change within the context of L2 s.
00:57:17.634 - 00:58:03.506, Speaker A: Maybe they don't do that. The longer term pushback, though, that I would have on you for what you just described, is the benefit that you have of having your own token is again, something that Cosmos has just been dead right on since the beginning, is the pull of sovereignty. And I do think on a long enough time horizon, that ends up trumping a lot of other things and dealing with complexity. Whatever. Countries have shown that they're willing to do that in order to have their own control, and people will actually accept people, companies, whatever, they will actually accept objectively worse circumstances to have control over their own destiny.
00:58:03.618 - 00:58:37.742, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say, though, having your own token doesn't necessarily have to know that is the gas token. That's a good point. In some ways, yes. In some ways, no. With Cosmos, from the user's perspective, you can use any token, osmosis will just swap that back to Osmo on the back end. And yeah, I think that that gets so complicated so fast. I don't think people like jumping around cosmos from token to token.
00:58:37.742 - 00:59:19.066, Speaker B: I guess on the sovereignty piece, I'd say it's really more about the technical architecture and how you choose to build your roll up that gives you more sovereignty or less. Or if it's your own chain, then tons more sovereignty versus your choice of what the token itself does and what it's used for, what it controls. Because a roll up that token is governed by a token can still, I would say, have like 80% of the sovereignty, or maybe some portion of the sovereignty, a good amount that a cosmos chain does, but that has nothing to do with the staking or gas token.
00:59:19.258 - 01:00:09.006, Speaker A: So one thing I know, you know, in much more granular detail than me is the adverse selection problem with shared security and with basically the really high quality projects in somewhere like cosmos. They don't need to rely on something like the hub, but sometimes they do anyway for this kind of alignment reason. And I do wonder if that same dynamic applies to ETH. I was just sitting here wondering to myself, as an interesting hypothetical, if arbitrum decided tomorrow to become its own layer one, what would that look like? Would it be that hard for them to recruit at this point, their own set of validators? No, not at all.
01:00:09.188 - 01:01:29.880, Speaker B: I think sovereign roll ups on Celestia although things you do have this token that everybody is unified under and you need to hold at some capacity, whether that's making your users users, or at least you'd be back. But they do strike that middle ground of not having to beholden to the rules of the l one, that they're posting to make their own ordering rules and things like that. The role that the token evolves once we do something like have decentralized or at least a distributed whitelisted sequencer set, that maybe they need collateral posting needs, there could be more types of flashing involved as these roll ups kind of evolve their own roadmaps. Whether that's provers or sequencers, it's all very in any one. There's probably more to be done. I just don't know if the gas token is the only use.
01:01:30.990 - 01:01:40.070, Speaker A: You might be entirely right after this. I think you've changed my mind much more bullish on the idea of eth.
01:01:40.150 - 01:01:44.874, Speaker B: First time ever. That's not true.
01:01:44.912 - 01:02:31.102, Speaker A: You've influenced my thinking a lot. To sum this up, because I want to conclude here, talking about the stride liquid staking proposal that went live on the celestia forum, the last thing that I just want to say is I really do think that people have flipped way too hard on Ethereum. I kind of think they got the model right and they're still in pole position no matter what this narrative says. And if it feels like they're struggling with things or it feels disjointed, I think that's coming for everyone and you can already see it in cosmos and it probably doesn't matter that much. Your design. Everyone's going to have to deal with this eventually. So I don't know.
01:02:31.102 - 01:02:33.242, Speaker A: I go into the new year optimistic.
01:02:33.306 - 01:03:18.122, Speaker B: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. It's a product of the maturity of the project, the amount at stake, and there is probably a little bit more of a monetary versus tax sort of divide, I think, in Ethereum than other ecosystems. That actually raises a lot more debate in terms of what you should be optimizing for. The roadmap totally comes out and says, yeah, we'll fix things that they need to be fixed. If there's something that can make this go faster, we'll probably add it and we'll go from let's talk.
01:03:18.176 - 01:03:42.226, Speaker A: Let's just close here discussing so there's a big proposal from call mutual friend of the pod stride. So Aiden and team over there put together a very thoughtful proposal about liquid staking on it's similarly to we saw.
01:03:42.248 - 01:03:42.706, Speaker B: This a little bit.
01:03:42.728 - 01:04:14.330, Speaker A: We had Aiden on, actually, to talk about the liquid staking module over in Cosmos land. Obviously, very different architecture, but they sort of had the benefit of looking at how liquid staking played out on Ethereum and Solana, I guess, in a sense, and deciding like, hey, how do we want it to play out here and now Celestia is really building this from scratch, and they are incorporating a lot of data points that chains before them didn't necessarily have. So, can you kind of walk us through the highlights models of what this proposal?
01:04:15.310 - 01:05:57.066, Speaker B: If you're interested in liquid thinking, I highly recommend taking a look at this proposal, because I think it one of the best jobs I've seen at really laying out the spectrum of different models, even outside the context of celestia. And then thinking about, within the context of celestia, we have an ll, one that does not have an execution environment. What are the models that are possible? And then what can we do today, and then what can we build towards as the dream end game? Right. And to give some more context, the normal way or the way that liquid staking typically works in Cosmos is using something called a component of IBC called interchange accounts, where you can basically use the IBC protocol to open and control accounts on other chains, but then they can take your assets on another chain and your assets that are sitting on stride really inherit, like, the full security of the stride validator set or the atom validator set. That is not part of the initial implementation of Celestia. This is a project that is trying to be as minimalist as possible to its core use case, which is a data publication, and retrievability for roll ups. And anything added to it really is a huge debate that's outside of that core sort of value prop, right, or could potentially take away from that is something that's kind of like how Solana.
01:05:57.098 - 01:06:02.990, Speaker A: Is with anything that extends the block time or reduces latency or increases latency.
01:06:07.510 - 01:06:10.626, Speaker B: We can draw that parallel bitcoin, right?
01:06:10.728 - 01:06:11.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:13.110 - 01:07:14.994, Speaker B: Here's the landscape. Here's the design space of what's possible. Here's why we think an ICA based solution, the one we offer today to other cosmos chains, is currently one safe to add to Celestia, to a much better interim solution than other solutions that have any form of slashing. It's not very small subset of the validator set. Here's why we think we should implement ICA for this interim solution. But by the way, we've been talking to some of the leading builders and thinkers within the celestial ecosystem. We've been looking at Celestia's own roadmap and then backing into what we think is the liquid staking endgame for Celestia.
01:07:14.994 - 01:08:58.854, Speaker B: What could that look like? And then that's where they get into some future looking, forward looking designs that would leverage snark once accounts are implemented on. Don't necessarily need to dig into the details of this, but the goals here are really interesting to think about, too. It's perfect world. You want your liquid staking protocol to come as close as possible to inheriting the same security properties as base ll one, to mitigate that sort of principal agent problem, right? But at the same time, an NLST, which is just like the literal way of doing that, leads you to the delegation problem, which is, okay, so we solved the safety issues with this llst, but now we have to actually be opinionated. If we're assuming this llst is going to become very popular, then we're now having a large influence over the makeup by deciding who gets delegated to and who doesn't. That said, if you think about the possible solutions for that, obviously you can do something pretty straightforward. A council of celestia ecosystem participants that are very aligned with the long term vision of Celestia, have them do some sort of selection, maybe you do dual governance.
01:08:58.854 - 01:10:27.094, Speaker B: So we brought up ideas from right now to appease in some way, which is just adding checks and balances that mitigate governance attacks of the actual third party liquid staking protocol by letting the CD holders veto certain types of proposals. Very unique. Celestia is like Ethereum in that it is very opposed to total holder governance in general. Maybe just quickly with a celestia improvement proposal. If it was a normal cosmos chain, would just go to a governance vote to upgrade the chain, but handles chain upgrades much more closely to how Ethereum does, which is largely off chain, rough, social consensus based decision making. I think it in line with that. If you care about those values to something and apply them to something as close to metal as liquid staking, then you would want to err away from any sort of council or like token based selection of delegation at the same time.
01:10:27.094 - 01:11:08.740, Speaker B: What's the obvious answer to that? It's a copy staking. Anything that goes into stride, just delegate it in the same portion as the current reflects the current makeup. This is also problematic. This does not allow the liquid staking protocol to be a healthy driving force of centralization. Even you may not like being opinionated, but if you end up delegating a ton of LST deposits to some fund with a white label validator that has 100% commission that's already in the top ten validators. That's a terrible outcome. In fact, you're missing an opportunity, right?
01:11:11.030 - 01:11:56.830, Speaker A: No, you're just digging into a point where again, we talked about this during the liquid staking season. But to underline one of the issues with having delegation in protocol and a lot of proof stake networks have this look like is a very top heavy validator set because of how users tend to behave, right? When as soon as someone gets a lead, it's like, well, I'm going to stake with a top validator. So we've talked a little bit about, and I think John Charbo has done a good job of giving the example of how these outside staking pools can actually be, if they have the right aligned values, forces of decentralization for the network, because they have the opportunity to actually rebalance the validator set to something that looks more decentralized than if you left validator selection purely to market forces.
01:11:56.910 - 01:13:11.766, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Not even just like the most popular validators and giving them love to the more grassroots validators that are equally performant but at the bottom of the set, not big brand names. There's literally like funds in this validator set that should not be receiving external delegations. That was never their intention of setting up a validator, their own t assets by giving those delegating board to those validators as well as the product, because all that yield doesn't code. It's going to be an interesting needle. I've seen on liquid staking protocol design, a lot of the big, big concepts, and then liquid staking, not just broadly module, which is really interesting. Now looking at we built this as a roll up in the most trust minimized fashion.
01:13:11.766 - 01:13:18.060, Speaker B: How do we have governance and processes objectives that you're trying to do?
01:13:21.310 - 01:13:52.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. We should also probably disclose reverie is an investor in stride. And actually I'm personally an investor in stride as well. But the reason for that is because just how much work they've done in the last year or so and just an incredible team and definitely I think they've got a bright future on Celestia, hopefully. So great to see that from Aiden and co. And I think Miles, we can wrap it there. Yeah, I think that was a good.
01:13:54.090 - 01:13:55.400, Speaker B: Episode because.
01:14:00.090 - 01:14:05.194, Speaker A: Hopefully it was mostly ETH based and I think Ethereum in 2024.
01:14:05.232 - 01:14:06.042, Speaker B: Or something like that.
01:14:06.096 - 01:14:18.106, Speaker A: I don't know the bull and bear case for ETH. I think it's mostly bull, but I don't know we will rely on our crack team of producers.
01:14:18.218 - 01:14:18.880, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:14:20.290 - 01:14:36.934, Speaker A: This was a fun one, buddy. I will see you soon. We'll plug for folks. We're going to plug our episode that's coming live on Tuesday. It's a surprise, but definitely tune in for that one. That's going to be. That one's going to be a lot of fun.
01:14:36.934 - 01:14:42.130, Speaker A: It's been a long time in the making. Cheers.
